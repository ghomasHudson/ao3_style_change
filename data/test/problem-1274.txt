"Right" Harry began positioning his own cock against Draco's arse "You're just a filthy fucking plaything... and you belong.. to me" and with that Harry instantly slammed into Draco hard, holding onto his hips and pushing deep
"I said-" Harry forcefully grabbed his jaw, yanking his head up to face the mirror "look at yourself" he ordered, and Draco winced seeing his reflection
"I know" Harry kissed his cheek "But you have to let me look after you. I won't do anything physical if you don't let me take care of you"
"Or... we could stay under the covers all day?" Harry added, a look of mischief glazing his face. He nuzzled into Draco's neck and planted more kisses
"I... I..."
Draco froze. He span on his heel with a forced smile "Back to my room?"
"I'm starving" Draco moaned
Harry leant in closer and kissed Draco passionately on the lips, Draco was barely kissing him back, he was lost in moans and cries of pleasure as Harry caressed him. He slid over to his ear and whispered softly, their hot sticky skin pressed together "Cum for me"
Both boys slowly turned to meet each others gaze, Ron as usual was biting back laughter, Harry meanwhile was flushing red
"Hey.." Pansy hushed, pulling him into her arms as he cried softly
"You opened up to me, you told me you wanted it-"
"How does this feel?"
Draco nodded desperately
"Alright, we're sorry but you're miserable darling, we want to find someone for you" Pansy took a sip of her tea
Harry entered the room of requirement to see Draco was already there, naked on the bed on his hands and knees, his arse gorgeously on display ready to be touched and used.
"I wasn't crying" he lied "It was just hurting ok?" Draco snapped, pulling his hand away from Harry's
Draco groaned in pleasure, unable to control his yearning for it all
"Who knew I could make you come undone so easily"
"Why not?!" Ron groaned, even Hermione looked disappointed
Harry looked at him plainly "Party?"
Harry was bad at playing it cool. Really bad. He was practically gawping at Draco with a mixture of arousal and longing. This Draco sitting before him, with the half exposed chest, the jewellery, the style, surely this wasn't the same Draco that dropped to his knees and submitted to Harry's every demand. The fact that this really was the same Draco made his cock stiffen instantly and the heat shoot straight to his groin
_______________
Finally, he took Harry's hand by smoothly linking their fingers together and turned, slowly guiding him from the floor, weaving in and out of the shocked students who were staring at both of them in total disbelief
Ron laughed at that scenario in his head "Or... he'll get drunk and remember his true feelings and stumble over to you from across the room, declare his love for you again and snog your face off"
Harry knew he had to tread carefully. Pissed off Malfoy was impossible to talk to and he cringed at how awkward he felt. Why was he suddenly so shy when he'd spent weeks dominating him to pure filth with ease?
"Your fuck toy... master"
"You look better" Pansy encouraged, watching as Draco pined over him, she brushed a speck of hair from his eyes and smiled "You're an absolute ten out of ten, darling! You could have any boy in this room if you wanted"
"I know" Harry rested his forehead against Draco's temple, his arm around his back holding him tight "I'm sorry, I thought you wanted this"
One by one the people around them began to catch on, turning to see Harry and Draco lost in a desperate heated kiss. Suddenly all eyes were on them, people pointing and whispering, others gasping in shock. Some students began wolf-whistling as the room filled with excited cheering and cries of surprise over the loud music
"Dreaming of a certain someone...?" she queried
"You have
"You're lips taste sweet" Draco whispered, smiling softly
Harry just huffed a smile and kissed his forehead
"What about... that guy?" Pansy discreetly pointed to a Ravenclaw boy sitting on the bench opposite them in the great hall
Draco froze dropping his mouth open in surprise feeling the cold cream touch his skin. He glared at Harry who was grinning to himself, holding back laughter "You little bitch"
"Ohhh, someone wants to be fucked, do they?" Harry said in a patronising tone, looking down at him like filth. Draco dropped his head and gasped feeling Harry's slicked fingers circling his hole "Tell me why you want to be fucked, Slut"
"That was an illegal move and you know it" Malfoy called out across the room.
Draco kissed him again, holding onto his t-shirt with his fist as their heads tilted side to side and soft moans escaped their lips. They were locked together for a while before they finally broke apart. Draco kicked his legs out, resting back on his palms while Harry remained cross-legged beside him
"Liar. You're such a dick sometimes, Malfoy" Harry spat
"I can tell.." Harry lifted the covers and looked down at Draco's erection already standing proud. Draco leant forward and caught Harry on the lips in a soft kiss, their tongues met and soft moans escaped as they held each other, sucking and licking in a passionate embrace
"I've spent my whole life being told I'm above everyone else, that I'm better than others in so many ways.. in here.. I finally get to be vulnerable"
Draco nodded reluctantly and did as he was told. His cock was already rising, the heat of Harry's dominance arousing him as usual
"Oh what's wrong slut?" Harry teased, he licked his finger then circled it around Draco's hole "You don't like being spanked?"
Harry had barely let the words slip his mouth before Draco began climaxing hard, hot cum shooting across his stomach and chest as Harry pumped his cock fiercely. Harry caught his lips once more and held Draco there in a heated kiss, as Draco moaned beneath it, jerking and pulsating, kissing through his orgasm
Harry slid his fingers slowly away from Draco's mouth. Draco groaned feeling his saliva drip down his own chin while Harry continued to stroke his penis from behind. Harry brought his other hand back, still wet from Draco's tongue and groped his arse hard, smacking him over and over again
Draco twisted back to face him "You didn't call me your slut"
Draco growled through his teeth, unable to hold himself together
Draco blushed seeing Harry looking his way. They hadn't spoken since their last encounter and tensions were growing. Harry tried to distract himself with his breakfast, pouring cereal into the bowl and completely missing, sending wheat puffs everywhere
"I think you're the weak one here, Malfoy" Harry teased "Wouldn't you agree?"
They entered the common room as if they owned it, which by now after seven years, they felt like they sort of did. All eyes darted to them as they stood at the top of the steps that lead down to the seating area, they were like the mean kids of the school, the popular ones, once they arrived, the party really got started.
"You want to be tied up?"
"I love doing that to you" he smiled
"You want me to get you on your knees and punish you?" Harry asked seductively
Draco looked at Harry for a moment, wanting to trust him so completely. His lips were parted slightly and he studied Harry's face, finally seeing him properly for the first time
Harry tugged on Draco's underwear, exposing his cock which was leaking with pre-cum and twitching. He bent down to lick the head but stopped just before causing Draco to gasp in desperation. Draco dropped his head back into the sheets and struggled against his wrist ties
"Apparently.. just.. apple and soda!" Seamus answered, all of them still having to raise their voices to be heard above the noise
Harry climbed off the bed and walked in a circle around Draco, who felt ridiculous being in that position while Harry remained fully clothed above him. Draco's eyes fixed on the floor, feeling like an animal being watched, his cheeks flushed and hot
He barely had a moment to breath before Harry pounced on him, pushing him up against the wall in a heated kiss that caught Draco off guard. He muffled a cry of surprise beneath Harry's hot lips and brought his hands up to caress his arms as the two boys became wrapped together
Draco raised his brow and shot him a snarky look
The voice from behind him made Harry stop in his tracks. Draco had picked the perfect moment where they were alone in the long stone corridor beside the courtyard. Harry had just left the library and was making his way back to the common room for another night of wallowing in self pity
"Mmph!"
"You've been so bad!" Harry growled, thrusting his cock against the back of Draco's thighs, one hand grabbing Draco's hip anchoring him, the other doing the spanking
Draco nodded "It feels... so good.."
"Exactly" Ron grinned
"And I know you're struggling to adjust to the fact that this is happening, believe me, I still have to pinch myself when I remember it's you too" Harry joked, trying to crack a smile out of Draco, who's eyes were still at his feet "We're both new to this, and pushing new boundaries and learning.. trusting one another.. and you're doing amazing"
"Didn't mum tell you?" Fred asked
*SMACK!*
"What the bloody hell are you two doing here?!" Ron erupted, pointing across at Fred and George who emerged from the crowded floor, bouncing with excitement and high-fiving fellow students
"Sort of. I don't know. I just.. I pressed him for answers on what we were and he got mad"
"Seriously, what are you doing here?" Ron repeated, his face still transfixed in shock
Draco's smile slowly faded while the others laughed between them, the pain still washing over him like waves "Everything about him..."
"You're worse than I am" Harry teased
Harry smacked his arse hard and grabbed his chin in his hand, holding him in place "What do you call me?"
Draco sighed. Resigning himself to Harry's probing "I feel ashamed, and before you tell me I shouldn't... I know, alright? But I can't exactly just shut that feeling off. I feel... regret"
Harry scanned the crowd for Draco but with no luck. "I see Dean and Neville over by the window!" Ron waved, taking Harry's arm and guiding him through the crowd
"Oh aren't you just gorgeous" Harry smiled wickedly. He pushed the tip of his cock against Draco's lips, smearing pre-cum over his face "Now you can touch me"
"Mm!" Draco groaned as Harry's hot breath sent shivers through him. He felt his entire body electrify with ecstasy as his orgasm came crashing over him. His arms were shaking with weakness and his entire body sent spasms of exhilarations through him
"Look at yourself" Harry ordered, tugging on the leash yanking Draco's head up to make eye contact in the mirror. His cheeks flushed seeing the position he was in "You always thought you were better than me, didn't you. Better than all of us. But look at you now. Look at what you beg for. What are you?"
"I... um... I thought maybe we could talk?"
"You said: 'I belong to you'... did you not mean it?" Draco's bit, his voice faltered a little but the nastiness remained, and for the first time Harry could see the pain behind his mask
"Why are you so desperate to know how I'm feeling?" Draco finally asked
"Please... "Draco breathed
"Good" Draco whispered
Hermione frowned, turning back to her morning paper, Harry looked awkwardly at Ron who simply shrugged in return. He looked back across the the Slytherin table where Draco met his eyes. He needed to get him alone again.
"Please come!" Ron begged "We had so much fun last year"
Harry entered the Great Hall the following morning and sat down at his usual bench surrounded by his friends. He peered across the room to see Draco, looking like he hadn't slept a wink. Harry's eyes kept darting from the blonde, to the table below him, to his friends and back, making sure no one caught him looking.
He watched as the boy moved closer to him so effortlessly, his dark eyes fixed on him as though they were seeing into his soul
Pansy and Blaise both nodded in agreement, tears were welling in her eyes too seeing her best friend so broken. Until now Draco had never shown much interest in others, his attitude toward girls was almost indifferent. For the first time she was seeing the pain that consumed him. He was falling in love, and it broke her heart to see him so hurt
"You did so well, Draco" Harry kissed his cheek tasting the salty tears "Please don't be upset" Harry produced an ointment with his wand "Let me look after you"
"Draco! Wait.."
Harry kept his gaze low but still fixed on Draco. A million thoughts rushing through his mind; the kiss, the passion, the exposure, and where was Draco leading him now? Like walking into one of his dreams he followed Draco close behind as they made their way across the common room floor and gradually up the steps toward the dormitories
Draco bit his lip, stifling a moan of sudden arousal. He'd never considered food play in the bedroom before but now he was interested. Especially how degrading it would be getting messy for Harry. His cock stiffened, and he imagined how it would feel to lick whipped cream and cum from Harry's hard cock
Harry positioned himself over Draco's hole, one arm pushing Draco's thigh against his chest, keeping him balanced. He lubricated his cock and stroked himself before aiming for his hole and pushing against the entrance
"Yup. The match next weekend, Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw, biggest one of the term!" Neville chuckled
"Harry!" Hermione interrupted, irritated that the conversation continued to flow back to the sex "I understand you're hurting right now but you have to accept that whatever it was that you two had is over"
"Ah! Fuck! Ohh!" Draco gasped, clenching his eyes shut and dropping his forehead to the wall. He bit his lower lip to stifle the cries of pleasure and pain
"Are you honestly gonna let him kiss someone else? Right in front of you?"
"Hm?" Harry pulled his attention back to him, fearing that his pining for the Slytherin was becoming obvious. How the hell did Neville know?
"Maybe..."
Draco pushed into the kiss and brought his hands up to Harry's face, holding him close until suddenly he stopped
He tried to calm himself, taking slow inhales and closing his eyes letting his head drop back.
Draco launched forward wrapping his hand around Harry's neck and bringing him crashing onto his lips. Harry pushed into the kiss, sliding his own fingers across Draco's cheek
"Do you think I could pull off eyeliner?" Ron asked
"So why can't we-"
Blaise furrowed his brow and shot a look at Pansy who in return reciprocated the look "So no different than usual then?" she smirked
"Ugh just piss off, Malfoy"
"and you want that?" Harry asked, taking a pastry from the tray
"Good boy" Harry whispered in his ear "Make anymore noise and I'll gag you, understand?"
Draco moaned again, since he was unable to respond due to, well, his mouth being a little preoccupied
"Pretty much" Draco rubbed his eyes to rid the final tears, still sniffing occasionally but his breathing had calmed now he was surrounded by his friends. "I never even considered being with men before but now..."
Draco was panting and moaning and cursing every possible sound from under his breath, having Harry behind him somehow intensified the whole thing, as he couldn't see what would come next. He begged for more and sang his name over and over, furrowing his brow and gasping out through parted lips, still feeling the tug against his wrist ties every time Harry fucked him deeper
Why was Draco Malfoy making him feel this way?
"Mmm and I love yours" Harry smirked, sliding his grip up and down Draco's leaking cock. Draco moaned out, dropping his head back into the pillow and desperately stifling his cries of pleasure
"But you were crying.. when I-"
"Umm... yeah, I'm sleeping fine"
"Fine, I admit at the start I just wanted to get back at you... I enjoyed putting you in your place and taking it out on your through the sex. I never had any intention of getting close to you personally and I'm so sorry that I was so ignorant before. I should've considered your feelings. I should have made an effort to see that you have changed but I chose to ignore it. I'm really am sorry Draco" Harry admitted, feeling disgusting as he spoke
"Well what makes him so special to you?"
I'm really nervous about posting this chapter, I'm feeling very doubtful of my writing at the moment and I don't want to disappoint anyone x
He panted and cried through the gag, jerking beneath Harry feeling the sticky cum stripe the sheets below him. Harry panted and grinned, wiping the sweat from his brow, looking down at Draco coming totally undone beneath him, his arse still gripping Harry's cock tight as his whole body spasmed with pleasure and tensed over and over
________________________________

"Either of you want to do it for me?" he pointed. They shook their heads fiercely. "Didn't think so"
Another flick of his wand made Draco's underwear melt away, exposing his rock hard erection and the shame that rose up inside of him
"I know you have feelings for me, Harry" Draco uttered under his breath "They way you look at me when we're together, the way you hold me. You can't deny that"
"You really want to talk about people getting on their knees for me?" Harry asked, raising an eyebrow and Draco stopped realising what he just said
Harry then wiped more cum and smeared it across Draco's cheek "Good slut"
"And so Freddie sent an owl to McGonagall asking if we could visit you and Ginny for the Christmas break"
Harry dropped his head back in pleasure as Draco ripped his shirt from his chest and began dragging his tongue across his collarbone
"How long has it been?" Blaise asked
"Just show up at the manor looking like you do now, that'll tell him" Blaise teased
"Mm-wait-" Draco paused "if we're just a casual hookup... why are we kissing? I mean... most flings just meet up, fuck and leave"
He made his way across to the shower block in his towel and threw it over the hook on the wall, turning the water on. As he waited for it to heat up, he heard footsteps from the corner of the quiet room, where he turned his head slightly to see Malfoy striding in, a towel around his waist and nothing more
Draco couldn't form the words to describe how he felt right then. He opened his mouth to speak but nothing came. Harry could tell by his reaction that he felt everything he desired deep down. He could see the shame in his face, the humiliation seeping from him. It was gorgeous.
Draco jerked himself away from Harry and turned back to the door "My heart isn't safe here. I can't be here.."
"All for you, Master" Draco managed to look up through the strands of platinum hair that fell over his eyes, the vulnerability in his expression meeting Harry's.
Thank you everyone who sticks around for this story and leaves lovely comments - you guys are the best x
Draco nodded but showed no sign of eagerness so Harry cupped his chin and pulled him close, kissing him softly onto the lips. Draco's stomach was twisting with a mixture of nerves, confusion and arousal. He wanted this so badly but couldn't shake the feeling of being vulnerable at the hands of Harry Potter, of all people.
"Because it would never work" Harry objected. His heart was ripping seeing Draco's hopes falling apart in front of his very eyes "We're just not meant to be... I don't want a commitment... I just wanted... sex"
"Exactly" Harry blurted out "And you did that because...?"
"You did amazing, Draco" Harry spooned him from behind, sliding one arm around him, their legs interlinked. "That was more than enough for today"
20 minutes passed by while Draco remained on his knees, which by now were painfully sore and red, his naked body getting colder. He moaned quietly under his breath, a combination of discomfort, shame and pleasure running through him. He adored being on his knees for Harry, he'd never felt such degradation and he craved every moment of it. Left to stew in his mess like an object, tossed aside by Harry for being so useless. He could feel the heat still pulsating in his groin
Their lips were hot and wet and desperate, and Draco found himself moaning with pleasure.
Malfoy froze at the sight of Harry coming over. Both of them completely naked and wet. Harry had been riled up and had stopped caring. He was tired of Malfoy running his mouth, he needed to be daring to show he was serious
"You want me to fuck you?" Harry asked through hot breaths
"Phew! That's strong!" Fred winced "More?" he held out his glass for a top up and Dean obliged
"You could've told me, I've been waiting here like an idiot"
"Mmmph!" Draco moaned biting down on Harry's shoulder as Harry slammed into his prostate. Draco's knees were almost beside his head now, folded in half.
"Ohh look at you" Harry stroked the hair out of Draco's eyes as the blonde squirmed beneath him "so pretty when you're begging"
Draco resting his head against Harry's chest as they drifted together into sleep
"Besides, the more I wind you up out there, the more I pay for it in here" he smiled
"You don't cum until I say so, Slut"
Harry smiled "Good boy. Get on your hands and knees"
"There's some cute guys that would definitely date you Draco, what about him?" she pointed at a Hufflepuff boy who was dancing in the centre of the room and making regular eye contact with Draco
Harry kissed his lips urgently and held him there for a moment, giving Draco time to recover
Harry stared at the door. Overwhelmed by how many different emotions he had just felt in the last five minutes. He kicked his legs off the bed, and brought his hands to his face, rubbing away the confusion. He ran one hand through his hair and collapsed back onto the bed, his erection still aching for Draco's touch
"What are you gonna do, Potter?" Malfoy bit. He was trying to uphold his usual bitterness in front of his friends but his words were shaky, his confidence faltering. He felt transparent, as though everyone around him knew what he really did with Harry
Draco looked at her unamused "Pansy... at least let me grab a drink before you spike the whole thing" but as he reached for the ladle Pansy tipped the remaining powder into the bowl and watched as it shimmered like glitter, swirling through the concoction.
He knew his friends we're just trying to encourage him to move on but he knew deep down that no one else could make him feel true happiness and acceptance like Harry could. He yearned to feel vulnerable again, submit to Harry's every command, to feel so dirty and ashamed and love every moment of the filthy, filthy pleasure.
"If I was weak would I be touching you like this?" Harry asked, gripping Draco's wrists in one hand above his head while his other hand stroked up the side of his chest. Draco shuddered at the sensation
Harry shrugged focusing on his coffee "Who knows? I mean.. I imagine we'd be at each other throats if we were together too long"
"Well congratulations, Malfoy. Now you know, I like men." Harry mocked. There was a pause "Do you?"
Harry began caressing and clawing all over Draco's skin, leaving his marks and he scratched onto his back "oh fuck!" Draco cried as Harry slammed into his prostate. Draco brought his arm forward, biting down onto his forearm, to stifle the screams and moans of pleasure.
Draco was ready to argue back but closed his mouth at Harry's orders. He pushed off the bed and pulled his jumper off. Harry kept eye contact the entire time, wearing a mischievous smile as he watched Draco strip down to his underwear. Draco stopped, hesitant at exposing himself so plainly
"M-master... s-sorry.." Draco whimpered
The entrance to the room was compact and crowded until suddenly the ceilings shot up and the room became ten times bigger. The dark stone walls expanded at the sides, where towering glass windows stood from floor to ceiling, under the depths of the lake which filled the room with an ominous teal glow which shimmered and reflected off every surface.
Draco frowned watching her fill the glass and take a sip so casually, as though nothing had happened. She blew a kiss and waved at Blaise, heading back over to join him. Draco looked down at the glass and the silver sparkles that were fizzing in his drink. It felt wrong. The Slytherin parties were always a blast, but he'd never experienced so much usage of illicit potions, not that he knew of anyway
Harry noticed Draco's eyes close with the pleasure and tugged on his hair once more
"Nothing... just a h-hole for you t-to fuck.."
"Y-yes.. M-master.."
"I'm safe with you"
Draco, in his bewildered state, couldn't help but catch a glimpse of Harry's cock, hanging between his legs as he marched over. His body was slim but toned, with golden skin and slicked back hair. Malfoy had never paid any attention to him like this before, but now he was interested
"Harry, just leave it.." Hermione cut in, reaching for Harry's arm but he shook her off, still closing in on Draco who was now backing away from him
Draco looking longingly into Harry's eyes as he handed over all of his trust and submitted to Harry's every need
The others, who up until now we're totally oblivious to Harry and Draco's secret fling, were stunned seeing the two boys making out with such passion as a mixture of drunken, overexcited cries filled the room
"That's a load of bollocks!" Dean laughed
_______________________________________
Draco faltered, not entirely sure what to say to that compliment. He thought Harry was attractive too, he'd never thought about it before, but recent circumstances had made Draco see Harry in a totally new light
"Because?"
Harry began buttering his toast angrily, scratching the knife against it so hard he was sending crumbs everywhere until a large chunk of butter fell onto his lap and he slammed his knife down on the table
"Come on mate, the rest of us are all going" Ron pointed to all the other seventh year students in the common room. The end of term parties were only ever for the oldest students, and sixth years if they we're granted permission. Alcohol and potions were prohibited but students always found ways to sneak them in which made the whole thing much more exciting. "We'll sneak in some drink, have a laugh and maybe you'll even get to flirt with some other guys"
HOWEVER, if this is too over-stimulating for you, and you prefer reading peacefully without music then PLEASE ignore the music suggestions that I've added
Harry sucked on his neck hard leaving a mark and causing Draco to whimper softly. He dragged his tongue down his jawline slowly before planting kisses across his shoulders and collarbone. Draco smiled feeling the tickle of Harry's hair brushing across his neck and chin. Harry finally stopped and returned to his position behind the blonde, whispering gently in his ear
Draco nodded and did exactly as he was told. He placed his hands against the wall and stepped back, exposing his arse for Harry who was eyeing him up like a feast.
"No we don't"
"Which one?"
"I don't care. You belong to me? Understand?" Harry pushed into him, gripping the back of his neck and Draco's chest tightened "Get on your knees" he ordered, standing back from Draco to watch over him. His face snarled as though the sight of Draco disgusted him
"Right.." Draco muttered, his heart sank as he realised he still hadn't received a proper answer. His yearning for Harry getting stronger
Harry linked his fingers with Draco's and kissed his hand softly, they were sitting inches apart
"Fuck yes... oh Draco... fuck!" Harry panted and Draco sped up, still locking eyes and moaning while Harry lost himself in the heat. Draco sucked and licked desperately despite the restriction of having his hands bound behind him
"Was that you getting rude again, Slut?" Harry mocked, poking his tongue out revelling in the joy of teasing Draco. Draco dragged his finger through the cream on his cheek and sucked it off seductively
Draco opened his mouth to respond but faltered, his gaze dropping once more to his fingers, twirling the loose thread on his jumper sleeve
"and that's a problem because?? I would love for someone to bake me a cake" Pansy gave a disparaging smile "Idiot"
Hermione and Ron both burst into laughter, Hermione dropping her head onto Harry's shoulder in fits of giggles and while he wasn't impressed, he couldn't help but feel better that his friends always made him smile
Harry stirred slightly, blinking himself awake and taking a moment to let reality fall into place
Draco huffed
"How do i know you're not judging me for my desires? I get my kicks out of degrading people, making them feel humiliated and worthless. How do I know you won't spread that around the school, tell all your mates, poke fun at me for it?"
"I don't understand.. what we are now?" Draco finally spoke
"I don't suppose you could magic up some coffee, could you? I have double history of magic today"
"But it not like that, Harry-" Draco snapped
Hi lovely readers! :)
Draco climbed off the bed, wiping his sleeve across his eyes in the the process. He stormed across the room filled with anger, biting back the pain. Draco grabbed his jacket and shoes and Harry clambered off the bed after him
"You're such a whore, watching yourself get fucked in the arse"
"You're so brave" Harry whispered "You did so good, Draco"
"We've noticed the way you've been looking at him during classes, it's... different" Blaise admitted
The centre of the room was home to two large black leather sofas and coffee table, which sat beside a huge stone fireplace with an elaborately carved mantelpiece, where the flames flickered generously behind the metal grate, feeling like the only source of warmth in an otherwise cold environment.
"Please... please...."
"That good was he?" Ron teased
Harry pulled back, adoring Draco's shallow breathing through moans of pleasure. Draco opened his eyes and the two looked at each other intensely "I want it" Draco whispered regaining his breath
"I'm done with you" he hissed, close enough to Harry's ear for him to feel the breath from his words on his neck "Tell anyone about what we did... and I'll never forgive you"
"It's just a little pink powder, you know.. to spice things up a bit" she smirked, looking over her shoulder, keeping an eye out for anyone watching
"Because you are an idiot" Harry grinned
Hermione was lost amongst the sea of students, dancing and singing graciously with Ginny, Katie, Romilda and other girls from various houses she'd only met in the last hour or so but regardless, they were all friends now and loving every moment
"I'm not so sure. I really hurt him" Harry muttered feeling a fresh wave of guilt
"Mmm you're are a little slut, aren't you Draco" Harry smiled "who'd have thought?"
"Don't know" Draco bit, dropping the ladle down and taking a harsh swig, his eyes still fixed on the wall opposite "Don't care". He found it much easier to display his frustration above anything else. What he wouldn't show was the hammering in his chest as Harry spoke to him. The rush of adrenaline seeing him so close, hearing his voice again. The sickening wave of feelings that choked him. Yes, showing the harshness was far less complicated.
"Draco-" Harry grabbed his wrist again. Draco bit his tongue to stop from snapping "I won't do this with you if you're going to shut me out" Harry was serious. He looked almost sad. Draco took a moment to consider and shrugged him off, making his way back across to the bed
"You fucker!!" Harry yelled across the courtyard as Malfoy appeared around the walkway with his friends an hour later.
"Ohh!" Draco cried out. His cock ached it was so stiff with arousal, just a passing touch would surely make him explode
Draco nodded, feeling the arousal burning though his entire body
Draco's breath caught in his throat. He saw Harry almost every day anyway and couldn't understand why this felt so much more terrifying. He couldn't peel his eyes away, seeing the boy that had taken his heart so easily
Draco nodded, his eyes meeting the floor feeling ashamed for asking
"Would they shame you, Draco?" Harry asked teasingly, feeling Draco twitching beneath him "Would they laugh at you? Call you a filthy whore? Tell you what you are?"
The room was fairly small inside, with redbrick walls and a dark wooden floor. Draco was pleased to see a large plush rug laid across the floor, knowing he wouldn't be too uncomfortable if he spent any time on his knees
Draco rolled his eyes and pouted, muttering under his breath "We never agreed on anything..."
"and I wanted to wipe that smug look from your face and it worked... in ways I never predicted"
Harry nodded
That stunned Harry, who had nothing to say back
Draco clamped his eyes shut and bit down, masking the curses under his breath as Harry slowly pushed inside of him. It was painfully tight, especially with his knees against his chest, he felt so open and exposed for him compared to previous positions "Fuck! Harry!"
"- and degraded-"
"Good Slut" he bit down on his exposed neck and pulled out his fingers "Would you like to feel more?"
"Have you earned that pleasure?" Harry asked, still thrusting inside him, but a little slower now, growing tired
"Whenever you're ready, let me know"
"Why did I come here? This is his territory, of course he's going to be confident in his own space" Harry groaned, embarrassed at how awkward he was in front of him, Draco was probably laughing at how uncool he'd been
"Ohhh fuck!" Draco moaned biting down on Harry's shoulder to stifle his cries of pleasure. Harry pushed forward, pressing his own aching cock against the hardness in Draco's trousers. He brought his hand down, groping him through the material causing Draco to gasp at his touch
Draco faced him with an unamused glare and Harry thought he was about to spit his usual bitterness but instead he broke into laughter and relaxed "We're really bad at this communication thing aren't we?"
Draco perched on his elbows looking down at him, admiring his first time seeing Harry without his glasses. He looked peaceful.
"What the fuck?! How could he do tha-"
Harry faltered. He did have feelings. Strong feelings. It was all too conflicting and confusing and he was too scared to admit it. He felt like a coward, watching Draco open up and take the pain head on while he kept himself hidden, denying what was there, realising Draco was stronger than he could ever be
"Just a hole for you to fuck" Draco muttered through shaky breaths
"Please... master.." Draco writhed beneath him, his eyes wide as he witnessed Harry's orgasm and felt him climaxing hard inside of his hole
Draco then pushed off from the armchair, finished his drink and placed it on the table as the other boy lead him to the dance floor. They were holding hands, and Harry's heart fell apart as though he'd been stabbed over and over and left to bleed
*SMACK!*
"I saw you. Flirting with that girl in Divination class yesterday"
Draco whined, biting his lip, his cock leaking pre cum beneath his legs "I want that"
He could feel his cock throbbing already, and Harry had barely even started yet. Their arms were around one another locked together, Harry pushing his cock against Draco's groin still in his boxers. Draco slid his hands down Harry's back and slipped them under the waistband of his underwear, stroking and groping his pert arse
Thoughts flashed across Harry's mind
"You said you're getting there.. a part of you still cares! I understand you're angry with me-"
"Ugh, what a snooze-fest" Harry chuckled. He waved his wand and the room provided as usual. A large jug of black coffee appeared on a new silver tray on the bedside table, along with two mugs and a small pot of milk. Harry poured a mug for Draco and passed it over, then made a cup for himself, sinking back into the cushions, hugging it to his chest
Draco rode out his climax, collapsing onto the bedding as his arms gave way. His arse was still exposed for Harry who was on his knees behind him, smirking to himself at seeing the wonderful display of pleasure writhing through the boy. He watched as Draco panted breathlessly, the side of his head against the pillow.
"-and so ashamed-"
"I deserve.. to be.. punished" Draco's breath grew ragged as Harry stroked him harder, his arms were growing weak as he tried to hold himself up.
Harry lifted Draco's head with his fingers and traced one across his parted, drooling lips "I'll definitely have to gag you, you're such a moaner"
"You belong to me. You're mine to fuck"
Harry tugged on the leash causing Draco to moan out "Come on, I want you to look at yourself in the mirror" He lead him over to the wall, Draco couldn't bare to look at himself he felt so ashamed. He crawled on his hands and knees behind Harry
"Can't wait to get them on the shelves!"
"Look at you, so desperate, so exposed. Such a filthy whore for me, aren't you"
He vanished the cuffs from Draco's wrists and helped him crawl back up. Both of them slowly got back into their clothes as the heat began dying down and the cooler night air nipped at their skin. Harry rested back against the headboard, running his hand through his hair while Draco sat casually in front of him, undoing the tie from around his neck and running the soft material through his fingers
"Please... Harry-"
"You've been such a naughty Slut, haven't you?" Harry stood over him, unbuckling his belt and sliding it from his trousers
"I'll get you hogtied, or bound in a spread bar, exposing that pretty little arse for me to fuck"
"I know what you're distracted by Harry" Neville smiled shyly
Harry nodded "I give you full permission to tell everyone my naughty little fetish if I expose yours. But that's not going to happen because you can trust me. I don't think you're weak, Draco. The courage it takes to let yourself be vulnerable, to put your trust in someone, that's not weak at all, that's brave"
Draco cleared his plate and placed it back on the tray. He moved over so he was sitting beside Harry, both of them with their knees close to their chests, Harry still hugging his coffee. He linked his fingers with Draco's
If you leave comments, please be kind :) x
"Because I do want you to.. spank me more"
"Mmm!" Draco was falling apart
"Harry!" Hermione gasped
He sucked and licked gorgeously, caressing the shaft and teasing the tip, moving up and down all the while watching Draco beg and moan and gasp underneath him. Draco fisted the sheets, arching his back to push himself deeper down Harry's throat
"Because you're a filthy fucking, cum-hungry animal, aren't you"
Harry pushed in slowly, feeling Draco's warmth envelop around his cock. He thrusted deeper, their bodies together holding one another. Harry wanted to feel every part of him, his arms were caressing his torso, shoulders, neck, arms, everywhere
"You're a dirty, filthy animal" Harry spat, pulling down the waistband on his sweatpants and reaching for his cock
"What are you gonna do about it?" Harry breathed into Malfoys ear, his hot breath sending shivers through his entire body
"Good boy"
"Really?" Pansy raised her brow in a disbelieving smirk "So you're telling me all the silly name-calling, the teasing, the constant talking about him.. that's not a crush in disguise, no?"
Draco swallowed, his heart sinking in his chest. He'd never felt so vulnerable in his life, putting himself out there so freely in front of the one person he never wanted to show weakness in front of. The mask of pain was naturally replaced by his usual bitterness "This just feels too complicated right now... I thought you actually cared"
Draco quietly slipped from the common room, making his way to the room of requirement for his usual meet up with a certain Gryffindor. Harry had been occupying his mind every single day; during classes, over mealtimes, particularly through the nights alone where he would use a silencing charm on his bedroom and proceed to scream out Harry's name as he stroked himself to orgasm
He stroked his hand across the brickwork and stepped back as the wall began to transform into a large door. As it settled, Harry clicked open the handle and walked inside. Draco watched Harry from behind, taking a steady breath and encouraging himself to follow, unsure on where on earth this would lead him
"So basically we have the ability to use each others secrets against one another" Draco said plainly
"Are you climaxing without my permission, Slut?" Harry asked, but Draco was already gone, lost in the intense pleasure
"Well, I didn't expect that" Harry joked, but Draco kept his eyes to the floor. He didn't have it in him to be snarky or blunt. He had totally exposed himself, he was vulnerable and felt weak at Harry seeing him in this state
____________________________________
"Morning" Draco whispered. Harry just smiled drunkenly "You slept well?" Harry nodded, stretching his neck to one side "I dreamt about you last night"
Pansy noticed this exchange and looked between them both, her eyes darting from Harry with a look of distrust, then back to Draco, but she said nothing. Hermione and Ron also noticed Harry's change in expression and shared glances, surprised to see he was looking at Malfoy
"Look..." Harry stuttered "I know I'm probably.. well definitely, the last person you want to speak to right now but honestly... I miss you"
There was a long silence while Draco considered all of their points. His gaze did always drift to Potter during classes, his daydreams filled with thoughts of the gorgeous brunette. The subtle glances across at him in the great hall, the distractions he unknowingly caused during quidditch games, the way even during their petty arguments among friends Draco never really seemed  angry at him, it was difficult to look that way considering he really just wanted to kiss him hard on the lips instead
Draco woke the following morning in a tired haze. He was still wrapped up with the gorgeous brunette beside him, only a little more ragged after eight hours of sleep. One arm was above his head bent under the pillow, the other splayed across Harry's chest. Their legs wrapped together, skin hot and sticky under the heavy duvet.
"What are you?" Harry asked, tracing his fingers up Draco's cheek
"I care for you... a lot..." Harry whispered, eyes to the floor
Harry continued spanking his arse, the hard leather connecting with his backside in a series of cracks that echoed around the room. Draco's cries grew louder and louder, whimpering softly against his arms as Harry beat him from behind
"And I don't want to be responsible for sending anyone else there either!"
"I have never judged your desires and I have never made you feel ashamed of what you're into. I would never do that to you"
"Here" Ron handed him a glass filled with the mysterious glimmering liquid. Harry didn't even question it before he snatched it from Ron's grasp and necked the entire thing, gasping and wiping his mouth on his wrist "Bloody hell! Feeling better?"
Harry lunged forward, grabbing Draco's wrists and holding them up against the tiled wall behind him, pinning him there. Draco gasped at the sudden movement and Harry pressed his own wet naked body against Draco's, who squirmed in shock as Harry's heavy cock poked into his groin, he felt ashamed that his own body was betraying him as his own erection was begging to be touched. He saw pure lust in Harry's eyes and it turned him on. It was madness, total madness. Harry Potter naked in front of him, advancing onto him, and he wanted it
"I get it" Blaise empathised "You're Draco Malfoy. You're confident, charismatic, stylish... everyone knows your reputation. And it's fine if you want to show that side of you to the world but we're your best friends Draco... and we know you're only human"
Harry jumped down from the desk and stood in front of Draco, moving in closer to him causing Draco to step backward until he hit the door. Trapped again.
"I'm not getting soft. I nearly beat you off your broom didn't I?"
Draco didn't speak, he closed his eyes with his head in his hands.
"God.. you really are such a fucking slut" Harry shook his head looking down at the blonde
Their tongues met instantly, sucking and biting and lost in one another. Their bodies pressed together as though they were melting into one, arms wrapped around one another in a gorgeous embrace. Harry could feel the heat radiating from Draco's skin as he held him close and the instant hardness that had grown in his trousers too. He slid his hand along the back of Draco's neck and pulled him even tighter while their lips remained locked together
"Good boy" Harry groaned. Their bodies were hot and sweaty and Harry's legs were growing weaker "You're so gorgeous right now, Draco. I'm gonna cum again"
"It doesn't matter. Whatever messed up relationship we had before is over so.." Harry sighed
Draco glared at Harry, annoyed at how he always managed to send heat straight to his cock.  He rolled his eyes and slowly kicked off his shoes, walking over to the bed and sitting down beside him
Their eyes locked together, his throat tightened, butterflies in his stomach, his heart beating rapidly.
"Just admit it, Potter. You're not that great anymore. You don't have the drive, or the courage. You're getting soft"
"He looks so gorgeous, why does he have to look so gorgeous?!"
"Open your mouth, Slut. I want you to taste my cum" Harry bit, jerking his cock in his fist, panting through moans of pleasure. Draco opened his mouth obediently and Harry felt his orgasm riding through him
"Would you like to cum, Slut?" Harry teased
Draco nodded, eyes still fixed on his filthy reflection
Harry pushed slowly, feeling the resistance against his cock but the slickness allowed him to feel as Draco was stretched. Harry's cock sliding into his hole gradually, the feeling of being filled and stretched overwhelming him
"I don't see why not" Harry smiled, acting coy
They lay in silence, both sweaty and flushed with lazy smiles plastered across their faces. Draco closed his eyes and savoured every moment of what he'd just felt. For the first time, he didn't feel the shame. Harry tilted his head to the side, looking at Draco lying so peacefully
"Flogger or paddle?"
Draco felt as though he'd forgotten how to breathe. One moment he was alone, the next Harry was approaching him, looking at Draco like he was stalking prey, ready to pounce and claim him. He was getting closer every second, pushing through the people around them and Draco realised Harry had no intention of stopping
"I've admitted I have feelings for you now!"
Harry smiled. He stood up from the bed and dropped his sweatpants to the floor, stepping out. Draco walked over to the door to check that it was locked with his wand then undid his own trousers, pulling them off
Harry stroked his cock harder, pumping fiercely watching Draco moan underneath him. He looked fucking gorgeous. He was dirty and degraded and Harry was enjoying every sweet moment of his humiliation, having the superior Slytherin on his knees for him, drenched in his own cum
"Honestly.. when we started this I just wanted to get one over on you. Wipe the smug look from your face. But.. what we're into.. you being submissive, me wanting to be in control. It's like we're a perfect match for each other.. sexually, I mean. I honestly thought we would just make out once and be done but... here we are"
Harry stepped back, grinning smugly at Draco's state of arousal, his cock was twitching, unable to contain himself "I think it's time you pleased your Master, would you agree?"
Harry dropped his food and came over to him, sitting in front of him with one hand on his arm, he'd never comforted a crying Draco before, it was strange, but he actually felt for him. "No, don't feel that way.. please.. you're not"
"Yeah, and thoughts of his- ow!" Ron got suddenly caught off by Hermione elbowing him in the ribs to avoid hearing what she knew Ron was about to say. Harry shared a second-long glance with him indicating he had pinned exactly what was going through Harry's head, and Ron smiled back silently
Harry pounced onto him pushing Draco down onto his back, their lips came crashing together, wet and hungry. Harry ran his hands over Draco's arms and settled on his neck, holding him close as he nipped and sucked his lower lip. After several moments he pulled away, both of them breathless "Like that"
"Mmm.." Draco groaned, tugging against the leather straps that were digging into his wrists. The spread bar was cold as the metal rested on the back of his shoulders, across his lower neck, his hands spread out at his sides above him
"Mmm-ohh--mmphh!" Draco moaned, still pressed against Harry's lips. Harry was caressing his flushed cheeks and holding him tight as waves of total bliss filled every single part of him
"Ohhh" Harry soothed in a teasing tone "someone likes being treated like a dirty little whore?"
Harry pulled back and looked at Draco dead in the eye, wearing a devilish smirk "If I was weak, Draco... would I kiss you like this?"
Harry pressed his lips and smiled "I guess so" he took a slow inhale and closed his eyes "If he's  happier moving on then I'm happy for him"
Harry thought it was rather fitting how the glow from the lake above the dungeon gave a green-ish tint to almost everything in the room which perfectly reflected the Slytherin colours against the black furniture and silver treasures.
Draco smiled, feeling genuinely happy to open up to Harry. He had always masked it before with thoughts of sex and kink but for the first time he was ready to let Harry look after him. It was strange, but he wanted it
He would've been able to take more in if the common room wasn't flooded with partying students, screaming and singing to the music that was blaring from a set of speakers on the table to the side. He could barely take a step forward without bumping into a body somewhere, the room was so dark with only the deepest teal glow shimmering over the students and the faint flicker from the firelight. He imagined this was similar to those muggle nightclubs his cousin mentioned once
"Any more trouble from either of you two and you will be banned from all future Quidditch games" McGonagall barked at them, pointing her finger furiously
"I'm so angry... for letting myself be vulnerable around him.. opening up for nothing" Draco cried softly, Blaise wiped the tear rolling down his cheek "He's probably laughing at me right now. Telling all his friends about what we did" the thought made him sick with shame and regret, humiliated at sharing his darkest desires to someone he once hated
"Ohh!"
Harry cocked an eyebrow "You're not wrong...". He looked across to Draco and realised how strange it felt seeing the boy so timid for once "Are you sure you want to go inside... with me?"
"So you want the sex to carry on but you'll push me aside when you find someone better" Draco bit
Draco let a moan escape feeling his cock stiffen instantly. He closed his eyes and bit his lip as Harry devoured his neck, their bodies pressed together getting hot and sweaty. Harry's tongue graced the sensitive skin on the side of his neck, it was wet and sloppy but Draco melted, feeling every nerve on his body intensify at Harry's hot touch
Harry stroked his fingers over Draco's cock, remembering how gorgeous it looked the day before in the showers, all wet and hard, sticky with pre come
"Are you sure?"
Harry kissed the tip of his nose and pulled back, looking into Draco's glassy eyes "What are you, Draco?"
"Er.. not as much as I'd like.." Harry half smiled
Draco nodded, nuzzling his head into Harry's neck to repay the kisses
Draco nodded
Draco swallowed and steadied himself, plucking the courage to talk back "I'm weak, am I?" he asked
"Get on your knees and show me your tongue" Harry ordered, tugging on the leash again. Draco scrambled up, his cock dripping threads of cum between his thighs
"And I just want to get breakfast so.." Draco stood up ready to leave again
"You going to cum, Slut?" Harry asked between thrusts
"Exactly. You're nothing to me. You're pathetic and worthless and a disgrace. I should just cum on you and leave you here ready for next time"
This takes place in the final year of Hogwarts. Most characters are canon, with maybe a few slight tweaks to their personalities, the rest of the story doesn't quite follow the books. Voldemort isn't back from the dead in this story so there's not really a divide between "good" and "bad". Draco is not a death eater or on the opposite side to Harry and his friends, though his father is still a nasty piece of work.
Hermione pushed herself from the sofa and took a seat beside him on the floor "Unfortunately Harry you'll just have to get used to him being around, I'm sure in time it'll all blow over between you two"
Harry wrapped his hands around Draco's waist and spun him over, Draco steadied himself with his palms against the bed and slowly spread his legs, his groin was pressed against the edge of the bed as he leant over it, arching his back and exposing his naked hot body for Harry to admire
"Draco, I have my desires just as much as you have yours, you can trust me" Harry looked at the floor, kicking the dust. Despite his confidence even he wasn't used to this newfound kindness between them "Making you feel amazing is the best thing I've ever felt"
"I suppose that's me then, isn't it?" Draco smirked
He slid quietly though the common room door, hopeful that most of the students would have gone to their dormitories by now, and he was pleased upon entering to see he was right. The room was large with tall ceilings, dimly lit with only the faintest teal glow coming from the lake on the other side of the towering iron-rimmed windows. The fireplace was glowing lazily, a handful of students dotted across the room, some engrossed in books or studies, others too interested in their conversations to even notice when Draco entered.
"and you'll get more, Slut. I promise" Harry kissed up to his forehead
Seamus and Dean were necking shots and climbing the furniture, Fred and George were engaging in some suspicious transactions in the corner with a handful of innocent sixth year students. Luna was freely wandering through the party offering tonic for people's drink while Neville followed close behind nervously trying to discourage people from actually taking it
Harry scanned his face for the right thing to say but hesitated "I... don't know"
"You don't think what I'm into is weird?"
"Pity. I'm surprised you haven't found someone else to satisfy your stingy sexual appetite. Have you not found another poor soul willing to drop to their knees for you for a no-strings attached fuck?" Draco retorted "That's all you want isn't it?"
___________________________________
Hope you enjoy this chapter! this was a tricky one to write but so happy I finally got to include the others! You'll be seeing much more of them. I've had the idea for the next chapter since I started writing this story and I'm really excited to post it soon! Enjoy & happy reading you lovely lot x
"You have no idea what I'm going to make you do" he kissed Draco's lips hard savouring every moment of Draco writhing in pleasure "But trust me when I say, you will be so humiliated-"
"I just did over thirty minutes of cardio with you" Harry winked, biting into a chunk of pancake "I get why you wouldn't be hungry though... seeing as I just filled you up myself" he grinned smugly
Draco scowled at her though puffy pink eyes "I don't constantly talk about him"
"You said you loved it" Draco uttered, barely audible  under his breath
"Are you getting rude with me again? I might not be so kind to you next time" Harry teased and Draco rolled his eyes. "Exactly, Slut. Be nice to your Master" Harry added, playfully scooping a blob of whipped cream off the plate with his finger and smearing it across Draco's cheek
Harry admired that. He stroked his hand across Draco's back and caressed his lower half softly. He then waved his wand and watched as the implements appeared beside him; a crop, a leather paddle and a small flogger
"You need to understand, Harry.. what we do.. you're in a position of power. You're dominant and it makes you look sexy and strong" Draco swallowed "But me... I'm weak and small and... degraded" he blushed saying those words, he couldn't meet Harry's eyes anymore "It's not who I am, you know that"
If you leave comments, please be kind :) x
"Sure... as long as we're not fucking in the dark, I guess"
"Good boy. You are mine, understand?" Harry growled
"I wanted you to not be ashamed of me! To not be embarrassed to be seen with me. God forbid the famous Harry Potter dates someone like Draco Malfoy, son of a Death Eater, a Slytherin. It's ridiculous, even you said so yourself. You clearly care too much about what others think of you that I just wasn't important enough"
"Right..." Ron spoke, completely unconvinced by Harry's sudden change of heart "So it wont bother you that I saw Draco kissing that boy out the back ten minutes ago?"
"C-cause'... 'm a dirty little.. w-whore... for you.." he muttered through ragged breaths
"and?"
Harry smiled looking down at him "Look at you, so helpless for me. So exposed. The things I could do to you right now while you're bent over begging for your hole to be fucked". Draco's moans were becoming wilder, the dirty talk did all sorts of things to him. "What would everyone say? If they knew you were a filthy little cum-slut? Getting on your knees and bending over for Harry Potter... what would they say, Draco?"
They broke into laughter that lasted several minutes "I take it back, you haven't changed a bit" Harry smirked
"I just want to stay here for a while" Draco whispered, barely audible. He felt so small. So worthless
"And you're fucking hot as well" Harry added, looking serious but melting into a smile "I very much liked what I saw, I always have..."
Draco nodded against the wall, his mind racing knowing he'd never done this properly before. It was new and exhilarating and terrifying but he craved every part of it. He needed to please his Master, it was his job.
He smirked at the sight that lay before him and began fisting Draco's cock harder as Draco tugged against the ties, eyes closed and panting desperately. Harry was touching him in all the right places, sliding his hand up and down feeling his foreskin slipping back and forth over the head of his leaking cock
Harry held his gaze for a moment, ensuring he wasn't just being played for an idiot, but Draco's reaction to him was real, and he loved it. He brought his hands down to his waist and held him against the door, Harry stood with one leg between Draco's, their groins pressed together, he could feel Draco's aching cock
"Is he wearing eyeliner?" Ron asked, squinting discreetly to get a better look
Harry held the belt in his hands after sliding it from Draco's trousers "Mm... I might use this on you later" he smirked, looking up at Draco with a wicked smile. Draco moaned harder and dropped his head against the wall in arousal. He'd always dreamt of being whipped with a belt
Harry grinned to himself as he continued to stroke him "Ohh you are so hard for me, aren't you?"
"Hi Draco.."
"You look exhausted" Hermione added "are you sleeping properly?"
Draco whimpered silently, he felt his chest tighten and flushed with embarrassment at being confronted so personally. At first he thought Harry was going to hit him and braced for the impact but nothing came. Instead, he had a hunger in his eyes, his smirk almost arousing.
Harry closed in on him in the shower cubicle and Malfoy backed up against the wall, wincing slightly as his back touched the cold tiles. His eyes were wide with uncertainty as Harry stopped merely inches from him, he could feel the heat radiating off his wet body
"You want it so badly, don't you" Harry moaned. Draco nodded, looking back up at him. "This is what you deserve Slut. You belong on your knees, touching me. Nobody else"
He hated this feeling. He was so used to being in control, being the one to make the demands and dominate, all of a sudden Draco seemed to have the upper hand. The boy who crawled on his knees and begged Harry for more was now calling the shots and he hated it. He was right before, Draco belonged to him and no one else, and this time he really meant it
"We only ever speak about how I'm feeling... what about you? How are you feeling?"
It wasn't even the sex that he missed, not the kink or the fetishes, not even the pleasure. It was feeling Draco's beautiful body under his fingers. Nuzzling into his neck and smelling the subtle cologne and musky scent. Kissing his soft lips and feeling him smile into it. Those memories hurt the most.
"Like something has changed between you two"
He passed the black leather sofas with his head down, biting back tears and heading toward the dormitories
"Alright, what was so important that you just had to meet me in a smelly old bathroom?" Draco moaned, locking the door behind him
Everyone looked up to them as they effortlessly oozed style and sass. The girls and guys crushed on all of them, Pansy noticed a group of Ravenclaw girls ogling at her in admiration while the boys did their usual wolf-whistling and winks, though she kept her gaze forward, totally unbothered
Hermione broke away from the group and wandered back to Harry and Ron, slinging an arm around either of their shoulders and slumping "Come with me to get more punch?" she smiled drunkenly
He felt waves of pleasure rising inside him, his cock gripped tight by Draco's tight hole as he fucked him deeper and deeper. Just the sound of Draco moaning beneath him was driving him crazy, he loved hearing the cries of pleasure slipping the blondes lips
Blaise chuckled "Honestly mate... we never really cared for him much. We were just pretending we didn't like him because we thought you hated him. Sure, he's a little annoying at times but if he makes you happy then you don't need to convince us"
Harry leant in and pulled Draco closer until their lips met in a passionate kiss. His hands graced the sides of Draco's face, feeling the soft skin and damp tears beneath his fingers as he then brushed his blonde hair back and slid one hand around the back of his neck. He broke the kiss but remained close, their noses touching. Quiet breaths and closed eyes
Draco buried his face in his hands, his tears turning to anger "Ugh it's so stupid!" he growled, growing increasingly more annoyed at himself "I just.... I think I want more... and he doesn't"
"-at being such a filthy little cum-slut"
They danced slowly, their bodies almost pressed together. Draco's mind was a total blur, the darkness and the flashing lights made everything blend together in one smooth movement. The alcohol was seriously kicking in, and whatever Pansy spiked the punch with was making him feel all the right things
Draco nodded and prepared himself. He was uncertain on how far he could take it, but aching to feel it all. He placed his arms out in front of him and shifted his weight onto them, lifting himself from the bedding until he was on all fours, looking down at his hands
"Oh oh right, yeah the match..." Harry stuttered, his eyes flicking occasionally across to the blonde
"You were daydreaming, again.." she criticized, slamming her book shut on her lap
"Try me" Harry threatened
"Come on, Draco" Pansy gestured, reaching her hand out to take his arm. Draco held his gaze with Harry a second longer, and Harry hoped it was because the feelings were still there. He knew they were, regardless of Draco's attitude. Draco finally turned back and headed down the hallway with the others, leaving Harry by himself once more
Draco hesitated. His first instinct was to respond with "Yes, Master", but he remained silent, blushing red and feeling hot with irritation and arousal. He sneered as usual and pushed past Harry, walking back to the castle with his head down, his friends following close behind
Draco stayed still for a moment, still bent over leaning against the sink as Harry pulled his trousers back up and fastened his belt
"No touching" Harry snapped as Draco reached underneath himself. He groaned in frustration, his cock was throbbing and leaking onto the floor below
"Was he that good?" Pansy smirked
Draco looked up with a half smile "The best we've ever had?"
"Maybe" Harry twisted his mouth. He supressed the feelings that were growing in his chest, unable to place what it was exactly, but he knew he wanted to be around Draco all the time, to look after him, make him smile, give him everything and more. Draco was important to him, and yet somehow that scared him. Getting hurt by him was not an option. "I don't see any reason to pressure ourselves. We don't have to label it. Let's just enjoy the amazing sex we're having"
"What do you want, Potter?" Draco bit
"So you still care?"
Pansy shot a glance at Blaise and cocked her brow "Draco.. you can be honest with us, we won't judge you"
Draco couldn't navigate how he was feeling. Years of loathing toward the Gryffindor made him want to punch him, yet he felt comforted by him too. He hated how shy he'd become now even though he wanted to kiss and touch and taste him.
"Ugh, just.. sod off and stop complaining. You lost, deal with it" Draco bit, shoving past him
"Malfoy has caught the snitch! Earning 150 points and the win for Slytherin!"
"Bloody hell" Ron breathed "I've never seen Malfoy speechless before, what did you say to him Harry?"
He stroked one hand across Draco's cheek gently and pulled out of him, still panting softly, his skin was hot and clammy, cheeks flushed and messy hair thrown back. He cast a cleaning spell on his cock and admired the look of shame that covered Draco's face
Harry faltered, his smile faded and brow furrowed "Do I mean it?"
"We're not in a relationship, Draco..."
They had fallen asleep in the room of requirement. He hadn't planned to, realising he must have been so drained from their session the night before that he drifted off while he was recovering. Harry was still fully clothed lying on top of the covers, lost in a dream of his own.
"You've said that every day" Hermione moaned "and every day its the same. It's not fair to take it out on us"
His skin was blotched and red, Harry knew that would bruise soon. He swung his arm once more in a strike and Draco groaned desperately into the sheets
__________________________________________________
Harry was on the brink of climaxing again, the sight of Draco Malfoy, bent over naked and exposed with a spanked arse, taking Harry's throbbing cock while gagged and bound, drove him totally wild to the edge of orgasm
"Please..."
"But right now he's hurt you so in my opinion he's the biggest arsehole ever" Pansy bit
"I'm not talking about the sex... I miss
He ran up the steps, his heart hammering in his chest, until finally he caught sight of Draco
He pushed himself off the bed slowly as to not wake the sleeping boy. Sliding on his shoes he headed toward the door. He wasn't even sure of the time. Hopefully he could sneak back to his room avoiding all questions
Ron nodded in agreement "Probably more of Luna's bloody tonics!"
Draco remained tearful, hearing what they were saying but having nothing to give back. He knew deep down they would never judge him, but breaking the icy exterior that he put out there was difficult, especially after mastering the art of hiding emotions for so long
"Fuck!"
"I said.. strip." Harry ordered, and Draco obeyed. Sliding a hand under the waistband of boxers and peeling them off, stepping out and tossing them aside. He stood awkwardly in front of Harry, totally naked, still not used to the sensation of exposure in front of his so-called 'enemy'
"Good" Harry whispered with a smirk
"Ugh will you just shut up for once in your life?" Harry moaned, feeling a heat growing through him, shame at being caught looking but also arousal at what he saw. Frustration was rising in him, mixed with their recent quarrel and Malfoy pushing his limits, he had had enough, he stepped away from the shower and turned back to him
He entered the room quietly, pleased to see that Harry was already shirtless on the bed, looking across at him intently. Closing the door behind him, he kicked off his shoes and felt himself smiling timidly the minute he met Harry's gorgeous green eyes
"Yes!! Harry!! Ohh fuck-"
"I'm going to show you what a pathetic little slut you are and then I'm going to cum all over your face and make you sit in it"
Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at the floor in front of Draco. There was the sound of a quiet pop where a black leather collar and leash appeared in front of him. Draco's mouth dropped open and his cock stiffened instantly.
"Impressive" Harry smiled as he looked down at Draco's throbbing cock. He turned back around and swiped the towel from beside him, walking off casually into the changing rooms, pleased with himself

"So... yesterday..." Draco began. Harry was looking smug. "I... I didn't realise you were into... that"
Harry was lost in a total high. Draco's hands on his body was electric on his skin, his warmth enveloping him like a poison spreading through his body. His heart ached for him, his already throbbing erection desperate for his touch. Draco moaned deeper into the kiss, sliding his fingers through Harry’s messy hair, both of them panting softly as their lips came together over and over again, claiming one another
"Do you want to be?" Harry raised his brow
"I need to warm you up" Harry spoke, stroking his hand across Draco's backside. He groped and caressed him gently before bringing his hand down hard with a smack
Harry slowly pulled out, feeling his cock slick against Draco's backside. Draco winced in the moment but watched as Harry cast a cleaning spell and rolled onto his back, sliding in beside Draco
Harry moved further into the bed and rested his back against the headboard, his legs kicked out in front of him while Draco laid at his side curled up facing the other way. He stroked his fingers through Draco's hair, caressing him sweetly
Blaise thought for a moment then sprung into life "That sixth year Slytherin girl is attractive, you know the one with the black curls..."
"How did this even happen?" Blaise asked, plucking another chocolate mint from the bag and slipping it into his mouth
Harry's eyes dilated with pure lust as he locked onto Draco's and lowered his lips over the tip of his cock. Draco was teetering on the edge of orgasm already, the teasing alone driving him wild as the sensation of Harry's tongue enveloped his entire existence
Draco swallowed another wave of humiliation as he inhaled slowly and parted his lips. Harry smiled, bringing the tie down and forcing it across Draco's mouth, tying it around the back of his head making sure it was tightly held in place, but still loose enough to be comofortable for him. Draco moaned instantly, biting down on the fabric and feeling it force his lips apart, unable to speak, only soft cries and whimpers escaped him
"Seriously.. mate, he's not worth it" Ron added sheepishly
"What the hell is that?" Draco bit, suddenly concerned
I'm starting to navigate a shift in this story now but it's a slow process getting it all out into words. The writers block is heavy at the moment! I hope you enjoy this chapter and I promise there is definitely more to come!
Harry looked from Hermione to Ron then back to her, making no comment
"As hard as I'm gonna spank yours?" Harry smirked. He loved how easy it was to get under Draco's skin
Draco remained on all fours patiently waiting for Harry to begin. He could feel Harry's hands caressing his skin that sent shivers through him.
"You're going to watch yourself get fucked" Harry whispered and Draco stifled another moan. He couldn't move his head as Harry held him up. He slammed back into him harder "Look at you, Slut. Getting fucked by the famous Harry Potter. How degrading for you" Harry smirked as he forced his cock further into Draco's tight little arse
"It's giving me serious bisexual vibes" Pansy added, applying her deep purple lipstick
Draco nodded indicating he understood and moaned through the gag
"I don't care" Harry spat, still slamming into Draco from behind "Open. Your. Mouth"
"Gee, thanks!"
Draco stifled a moan of arousal. Just the thought of that sent pleasure straight to his cock
"I know" Harry smirked with a dashing grin, he blew a kiss at him mockingly to receive as smack on the arm "Ow!"
There was another long silence. Draco picked up an apple and began eating it. His chest felt tight with raw emotion. He wasn't good at talking.
"I need a drink" Draco added, heading over to the table filled with an array of colourful punch bowls and nibbles
"Is there anything.. you don't like?"
"Was that a noise, Slut?" Harry spanked his arse hard. He was positioned behind him, pressing his own throbbing cock against Draco's backside. He reached around and slid two fingers sideways across Draco's mouth, gagging him. Draco bit down onto Harry's fingers desperate to suppress the moans escaping him but was falling apart beneath him.
"Well, tell the room what you want and see what happens"
Harry looked deeply into his eyes, his hands still caressing Draco's face
"I never said that!"
Harry tried his best to mellow into the atmosphere but was still feeling apprehensive. He didn't want an ugly confrontation or any further heartache, especially around so many people. He took a further sip from the glass and bared his teeth at the bitterness that came. How did people enjoy drinking this?
"Relax darling! It's just a little pick me up! Nothing serious" she smiled, pouring the sparkling punch into her glass "Trust me, tonight is going to be a-mazing"
Harry thought that as they grew older, him and Malfoy had come to an unspoken agreement to be more civil at school. He noticed that Malfoy teased him less, stopped pestering him and his friends and assumed that the Slytherin had outgrown his boyish bullying days, until moments like today reminded him that he was still an arse.
Draco thought for a moment, then smiled as a tray appeared on the bed beside them. There were two plates filled with pancakes, covered in an assortment of bananas, cream, syrup and strawberries. Draco eyes lit up and Harry adored how in that moment Draco looked so cute, filled with excitement over food
"I know that" Draco cut him off, the uncertainty in his mind kicking in. He felt almost disappointed "But.. this feels a little more intimate than just causal sex, wouldn't you agree?"
"Sore" Draco mumbled
"No. I just-"
If you leave comments, please be kind! :)
"Mmmm!"
"I don't hate you, Harry"
Draco's eyes scanned the floor but he couldn't bring them up to the mirror. He felt more cum drip off his chin
_________________________
"Why? are you scared, Potter?" Draco suddenly grew a little confidence
________________________________
"I don't know!" Draco snapped
"But that would be far too easy, wouldn't it?" Harry cocked his eyebrow, revelling in Draco's desperation
"You.. master.."
"What do you want from me, Draco?" Harry growled "Please, enlighten me"
"Go on boys!!"
Their bodies were closer than ever. The front of Harry's thighs sticking to the back of Draco's. He was leaning right over him, his chest against Draco's stomach and throbbing cock. The further he leant down the deeper he trust into him. It was rough and hot.
"I know" Harry nodded to the ground, pressing his lips to bite back the emotion rising inside him "I don't hate you either. I haven't for a while now..."
"Barely" Malfoy laughed "You don't have that fight in you anymore and its pathetic. Face it, Potter. You're weak, you have no backbone"
"Spread your legs for me" Harry whispered and Draco complied. He was bent over facing the wall as Harry grabbed his hard cock and pressed against Draco's hole. Draco winced at his touch while Harry held him close with the other hand on Draco's hip
The thought of touching someone else made him cringe, even worse his chest filled with dread at the idea of telling someone else about his submission kink. How he had managed to spill his darkest desires to Potter he had no idea but it had all worked out so naturally, so gorgeously
Draco moaned through his nose, feeling Harry totally fill him. It was a lot to take, he was rather gifted and Draco felt himself overcome with heat as Harry slammed continuously into the back of his throat
Draco snaked through the crowds on his way to find another drink, anything at this point would suit him fine. The darkness made it almost impossible to see what was even on offer, all the punch bowls looked the exact same and the table was littered with spilt glasses and puddles of drink. He began ladling more punch into his glass when a familiar voice appeared beside him
Draco looked down at Harry, a nest of brunette curls on his knees, desperately tugging his belt from his waist. Draco shrugged his shirt off his shoulders, leaving it hanging off his arms, ripped apart. His emerald green tie still hanging around his neck and his bare chest exposed
"Absolutely" Harry chuckled but his smile dropped seeing that Draco wasn't reciprocating, worried that the uncertainty was filling his mind again "Draco.. what's wrong? you're safe here, remember? You did so well" he held out his hand and felt Draco take it, linking his fingers and squeezing tight
Draco smiled to himself. He was filled with happiness, enjoying a private breakfast with someone he never dreamed he would want to be with. He was content, and realised he loved spending time with Harry. He was kind, and gentle, someone Draco needed in his life
Please be kind in the comments! I'm feeling fragile lol x
"Ugh. I don't want to see him" Draco groaned
"How do you know?" Draco exclaimed. He chuckled sadly at the ridiculousness of it all "You're so set on how you think you should be feeling about me outside of these four walls that you're ignoring what's really there-"
Draco wanted so badly to feel exhilarated but instead felt sad and confused
Draco sniffed, closing his eyes
"Y-yes... Master"
"You're a filthy fucking, whore, Draco" Harry dragged his finger through the mess between Draco's thighs and sucked it off slowly "I think I might just leave you there to sit in your mess"
"It was Potter's fault! He had it in for me from the start! Bloody cheat" Draco snapped
"You called me Harry Flopper for a month"
Draco closed his eyes and moaned into Harry's shoulder. Harry sucked hard on his pale skin and he whimpered out at the sting of his lover making his mark.
"Sweetie, it's okay to cry-"
"That's the one! Elsie..? Ella..? Something?"
"I love it when you beg" Harry smirked, biting down "But you're so fucking loud, Slut. I make the demands" Harry grabbed his Gryffindor school tie from the floor below him and slicked it through his hands, holding it tight. He reached over Draco from behind and slid it down in front of his face
Harry hadn't taken in a word of that. He hadn't really been paying much attention for the last hour in fact. His mind was occupied with thoughts of Draco, who just so happened to be sitting three desks in front of him and Harry thought even the back of him looked bloody gorgeous
Draco relaxed a little and felt a warmth in his chest knowing Harry actually cared about more than just sex. He realised he missed him
Draco turned slightly and noticed Harry moving towards him. His smile dropped as he instantly froze, forgetting the boy beside him and feeling his chest drop to the floor
The two of them were fucking hard, and it was hot and sweaty and messy and everything they'd ever wanted. Draco was getting weaker, his arms starting to falter unable to hold himself up in front of the mirror
Draco stepped away, lowering his wand. Tears flooded his angry eyes, the scowl upon his face masking the unbearable pain that crushed him. He turned and walked away, holding himself together until Harry was out of sight
"You feel so good!" Harry moaned, throwing his head back "Gorgeous Slut! Fuck! M-m s-so close d-draco... mmmm yes!!"
"I swear I wasn't flirting, I-"
"You're safe with me"
Draco swirled the spoon a few times, watching the coffee steam "What about you?" he asked
"But you've developed feelings for Potter, and now he doesn't feel the same?"
"Would I be breathing down your neck like this?" Harry leant forward and whispered into his ear, sending shivers throughout Draco's body
"Alright stop being cocky, Harry"
"What?" Draco asked, taking the plate and sitting it on his lap "it's my favourite"
Harry stuttered, unsure on what to say next. Their eyes were locked together in the icy silence "I just meant.. it was good.."
"Please touch me, Potter"
Harry sipped his coffee admiring Draco's gorgeous bed hair and cute smile "Noted"
Draco didn't respond. His chest felt heavy. He couldn't meet Harry's eyes
There was a long silence, Ron and Hermione's confused expressions remained the same until finally Ron spoke "Well we already sort of figured that out, mate" he moaned, rolling his eyes at still having no real answer behind his friends foul mood
Harry's focus flew back to Hermione, who was sat opposite him on the couch of the Gryffindor common room. Harry was below sitting with his legs kicked out on the floor, his back against the fire place feeling the warmth spread over his body
"I'm shit? Potter you couldn't even see the snitch when it was right in front of you... that's just embarrassing really-"
"You crashed into the end of my broomstick! You made me fall!" Harry cried. He stormed up to Draco in a rage, Hermione and Ron behind him looking fretful
"I'm sorry that must be so hard for you" Harry mocked sarcastically
"Oh.. right. Sorry"
Draco nodded in agreement, sipping his coffee slowly. His eyes were fixed on Harry's, pushing him for more
Harry laughed "I have.. no idea... but I'm f-feeling... tipsy as hell!"
"I rewarded you"
"P-please... I want to-"
"And so you two began hooking up?" Pansy probed
"I know! I know" Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed "I know you've changed, Draco, I can see it, I've noticed how different you are now since we became... since we started... this"
"Your cum-slut" Draco said, aching to rub himself
Draco smiled softly, feeling the warmth in his chest from Harry's words. He settled deeper into the pillow and let himself rest, safely knowing Harry was there
Harry slid his arm around Draco's waist pulling him back but Draco's eyes remained on the floor, he couldn't let Harry see him break. He felt the shame stinging his chest from the vulnerability, embarrassed at putting himself out there and being shot down
"Taste me, Harry" Draco managed through gasps
"You seriously shouldn't, Pans"
Draco nodded silently and Harry smirked, enjoying every last drop of Draco's submissive state.
"We're back!"
"Well-"
Harry stroked his erection fiercely, biting down on his lip. His cock was inches from Draco's mouth and Draco's eyes were fixated on him
"M-m s-so clo-se..!" Draco cried
Draco pouted at Harry pointing out the crying part again, then he settled, reluctantly opening up  "It felt incredible.. what you did. I suppose I need to learn how to handle the feeling.. tell you what does and doesn't feel good for me"
Draco could feel every pore in his body radiate with ecstasy. He had never felt such euphoria before, pleasure so intense that every fibre of his body was electric. He dropped his head forward onto Harry's shoulder as he felt the orgasm pulsating through him.
"Well stop! I don't want anyone, ok?" he snapped. They closed their mouths and nodded, settling into an uncomfortable silence
Draco's mouth dropped open and his eyes widened at the abruptness of Harry's demand
"Incarcerous" Harry whispered, leaning closer to Draco's ear causing black rope to bind its way around Draco's wrists. The ties wound tightly around his flesh and trailed up the sheets to the headboard, restraining him to the bed "You're mine"
"Shall I stop?"
Yes, it was shit. And Harry hated it. Yet somehow he knew that Draco was troubled and conflicted and deep down never really meant any of the things he'd said before. The more he thought about it, the more he realised that Draco was remorseful now, he'd stopped making nasty remarks. He no longer bothered Hermione or ridiculed Ron. Draco had softened in the last three months
"What does he want?" Ron moaned, scowling across the hallway to Draco
"Draco!" Blaise called from behind him "There you are, mate! been looking for- what's wrong?" his expression dropped as Draco turned to look at him, the realisation hitting him instantly that his best friend was hurt
"Please don't walk away from me, I want to be here for you afterwards. Making sure that you're okay. Making sure you're not hurt"
"Fancy meeting up again tonight?" Draco asked
"Because we would never work as a couple!" Harry sighed, pinching his brow feeling confused by the sudden intrusion of questions
Suddenly Harry was caught off guard by the sight of Draco entering the great hall. He walked in with his head down, trailing behind Pansy and Blaise before taking a seat at their table. Blaise handed Draco a cup of coffee which he cupped in both hands, sipping cautiously before he finally looked up and caught Harry's gaze
Draco pressed his tongue to his teeth to supress the urge to snap, slowly turning his head to meet Harry with the foulest glare. Harry's smile dropped as he saw the bitterness seeping from him
She turned to Blaise, who simply shrugged at her with a worried smile, indicating he was clueless too
"Pick one" Harry ordered, gesturing towards the toys
Draco bit his lip as Harry spoke, feeling pleasure pulsating to his groin, desperate for release. Harry didn't realise that he was describing Draco's dirtiest little fantasy
"Your slut"
"Oh lighten up! I would say you have a stick in your arse but you enjoy that"
"Guys I'm not interested" Draco bit, growing irritated with their attempts at playing Cupid
"Riding crop.. please"
"What?! Absolutely not!" Draco lied "Why would I have feelings for bloody Potter? That annoying little twerp wishes he could get someone as good as me" he rolled his eyes looking annoyed but was masking the panic of them pin-pointing Draco's crush so easily
"Fuck! Potter!.. fuck!" he cried. His cock pulsated in Harry's hand as hot cum shot across the sheets beneath him. Harry smiled to himself seeing the Slytherin totally weak at his mercy, panting and moaning his name beneath him
"Jealous are we, Harry? Draco smirked, but his smile dropped upon seeing Harry's icy stare. Harry wouldn't admit that he actually was jealous. He couldn't give Draco that satisfaction. "I-I wasn't flirting! She's just a girl from my house.. we were talking.."
"P-please.." Draco begged, his voice was now ragged
Harry slid his cock back into him slowly and Draco cursed under his breath at the sensation of being filled. He then leant in closer, his sweaty chest pressed against Draco's back. He slid his fingers through Draco's hair, forcefully tugging his head up to face the mirror that hung in front of them
Draco just stared at him "... good morning?"
"Tell me you don't feel something for me then"
Draco's smirked melted to a reluctant smile, shaking his head. "God you're so cocky"
Draco was yanked up and watched as Harry slammed into him from behind, the image alone drove him to the edge
"Ohhh Harry..."
"My first proper time... I've been practicing though.. with toys" Draco trailed off, looking down at the floor feeling embarrassed
_________________________________
He felt his cock release inside of Draco, riding waves of pleasure feeling his cum shooting into him. He grunted under his breath, jerking as the climax washed over him. He was hot and sweaty, panting out of breath. The moment his orgasm finished he broke into a grin, wiping the sweaty strands of fringe out from his eyes and brushing it back through his hair
Hermione nodded "Never thought I'd say this but it works on him.."
"I'm not angry, I'm hurt!" Draco spat "I'm hurt and humiliated and no, not the good kind of humiliated, the shit kind. The kind where I can't even look at you because I know you'll see me and forever be reminded of all the filthy things I let you do to me, and that's all you'll ever see when you look at me and I'm so filled with shame it hurts to even think about it!" he gasped, unleashing everything he'd been holding in for so long
Hermione yanked Harry by his arm over to the drinks table and they huddled together tight enough to keep their conversation private, even though the loud music did that for them anyway
Draco was on all fours, his back arching up as Harry demanded. He hung his head beneath the arms holding him up while his shoulders pulled back, his shoulder blades poking through the milky skin on his back
"You... m-master" Draco voice wavering slightly, desperate moans escaped his lips, his cock was aching to be touched and every strike of Harry's hand electrified him with shame and humiliation and pleasure
Harry forced a smile and nodded accepting what he was seeing, completely masking the urge to fall apart. "Whatever... we're not together so... whatever"
Harry cast the wrist ties away slid his arm around Draco's back, pulling him up and spinning him onto his hands and knees. Draco was panting at the sudden movement, he looked down at the sheets beneath him and felt a wave of gorgeous shame at letting himself be used. He slowly positioned his legs wider, feeling awkward at exposing his arse for Harry
"Look at yourself"
Harry crawled forward and dragged his tongue across Draco's cheek, gliding it up to his earlobe and licking slowly. Shivers radiated through Draco feeling Harry's hot breath and wet tongue over his weak spots. He leant into Draco's ear to whisper "I'd love to smother you in cream and lick it off every.. single.. part of you.." he pulled back with a smirk, eyeing down to Draco's cock
"Maybe, one day"
Harry hadn't really considered his feelings much, in fact he was so invested in indulging in the kink aspect that he hadn't given it much thought
"Don't go, Draco" Harry pushed himself up, sitting with his legs crossed and placing his glasses back on
Harry thrusted harder and more desperately than before, he dropped his head back feeling waves of pleasure approaching as his orgasm teetered on the edge. He suddenly pulled out and climaxed hard, shooting hot cum across Draco's arse and back
"I hate crying" Draco bit angrily through the tears "I hate having fucking feelings. Fuck this" he dropped his head into his hands sobbing. Pansy shared a worried look with Blaise as they tried their best to comfort but with little luck
"You're eager" Harry called out as he turned the corner of the castle to see Draco standing nervously outside the room of requirement
"Are you perving on me, Potter?" Draco called finally, opening his eyes from the water
"Mmm, yes you do"
Harry felt a wave of sickening jealousy and took another swig from the glass, by now he was eight drinks in and feeling it, a terrible mixture of tipsy, horny and emotional. His confidence had grown but the sense of logical thinking had vanished and after everything that had happened he was more desperate for Draco now than ever
Draco scowled "God you're annoying sometimes" he was frustrated and anxious, though he loved his little meet ups with Harry, he was never quite sure what to expect
"Open your mouth, Slut" Harry ordered. Draco's eyes widened a the realisation and he shook his head
"Draco... what we did... I don't blame you for feeling conflicted. I told you before not everyone can handle it and that's okay-"
"No Hufflepuff slander here, please Draco!" Blaise chimed in, lost in the music and already half tipsy "I won't tolerate Puffle hate" he laughed and Draco shook his head with a grin, downing the rest of his spiked punch to mask the growing ache in his chest
The Hufflepuff boy was still beside him, grinding slowly against Draco's body and Harry felt sick with jealousy
"No.. I'm fine.. fuuuck" Draco groaned
Draco nodded
"How dare you look at other people behind my back?"
"Wow you really don't like them dancing together, do you?" Ron probed, standing at Harry's side and expecting to see a red mist descend over Harry's eyes
"No idea" Harry replied. He knew.
"Why do you think! Because
Harry thought back to the jealousy he'd felt before, when Draco simply spoke to another person and was reminded of the fire that riled up inside of him. Harry was fuming that day, he punished Draco so severely for something so harmless and now he was letting him get away with this. No way.
"And by 'that' you mean - men?" Harry added
"Of course you do, you fucking slut"
Harry remained silent
The music thrummed straight through his body feeling his bones vibrating but all he could focus on was Draco in front of him, everything else became invisible
He pulled his knees to his chest and began fidgeting with the hem of his jumper "I... I... think I did something really stupid.."
"Maybe you could tell him how you really feel, now that you've actually had time to process everything. You could tell him that you're having second thoughts..." she suggested
Harry grabbed hold of Draco's legs and pushed them back, trusting into him deeper. Draco's soft cries filled the room as he panted and begged, writhing beneath Harry
Draco remained silent
Harry brought his lips up to Draco's ear "You've really earned yourself a punishment tonight, Slut" he whispered, feeling Draco tense underneath him
Harry and Draco were standing before Professor McGonagall at the side of the Quidditch pitch. The game had just ended and all the spectating students were leaving the stands with a buzz of excitement while the two boys had been kept behind for their questionable gameplay
Harry kissed him hard on the lips, and Draco to his own surprise, melted into it. Harry moaned  and released the grip on Draco's wrists, bringing his hand to his neck and holding him there
"Well tough because I'm getting over you"
Even Blaise, who usually kept to himself, didn't mind the gawping looks he was getting from everyone around him as they checked him out on his way past them. He winked at one girl and saw her blush into a fit of giggles
"Pray for me" Draco teased
Draco felt his cock stiffen instantly as Harry's cock pressed into his groin. They began walking backwards, still locked in a passionate kiss, arms caressing and legs intertwined until Draco hit the back wall and Harry held him their with his body.
"And did you agree to become boyfriends at any point?"
Harry took a sip of his coffee first "Two years ago? I think? I can't really remember" he took another swig "I've never been attracted to girls though, so I suppose it's been clear to me for a long time now"
Draco exhaled again, reluctant to submit to Harry's cockiness "Because I'm an idiot"
"I'm not awkward" he argued back "I'm just so used to pranking you and calling you names I give myself the creeps when I'm nice to you. It's so unnatural"
"What's wrong? What's happened?" Blaise asked, but Draco remained silent. He peeled Draco off gently, holding him at his shoulders and looking deep into his puffy red eyes with an expression of both worry and sympathy
"Sluts like you don't get pleasure that easily" Harry teased and got back to his feet as Draco whimpered against the wall. He was facing him now "I was far too generous before, letting you cum so quickly" he traced a finger over Draco's parted lips "Allowing you to feel such pleasure when you haven't even earned it"
"I know" Harry bit "But this is crazy! It's us! It's you - who hates my guts and ridicules me at any moment he gets and its me - who can't stand your twisted views and your pathetic superiority! How can we actually work together?"
"You remember our safe word?"
"I want to cum" Draco begged
His cock pulsated as hot cum shot out the tip, covering Draco's face. Draco clenched his eyes shut and moaned as Harry's cum splattered across his chin, cheeks and nose, even some in his hair.
"Yes.. master.. so much.."
"Open your mouth, Slut. Your holes might have some use to me" Harry ordered, his tone remained cold. He unbuttoned his trousers and slid them down, placing one hand under the waistband of his underwear and pulling out his already throbbing erection
"You look fucking gorgeous right now, slut" Harry praised, biting his lip as Draco was bound and desperate at his mercy. His own cock was rock hard and he pulled it out of his boxers, stroking the shaft up and down and sliding his thumb over the wet tip
"We were in charms class and you sneaked in under your invisibility cloak and started giving me a blowjob under the desk" Draco smiled, Harry cocked his head excitedly "Then I kept moaning and moaning so you dragged me out to the corridor and bent me over the stone staircase and we fucked"
"You little slut!"
Draco just glared at her while chewing
"Oh shut up!"
"You'll pay for that. Tonight. Our usual place"
Harry sped up, tasting Draco so sweetly in his mouth, feeling his body trembling under his touch. He began to suck harder and watched as Draco reached the edge of orgasm through cries and moans of ecstasy
Draco cried out, louder this time. His body jerked and he buried his head in the sheets to stifle the moans
"That would help" Harry joked
So far the general break down of the party was this: Ron continuously downed mysterious drinks then proceeded to dance like his life depended on it, would then begin to feel sick and then stupidly fix it with another drink thus letting the cycle continue.
"Of course" Harry smiled, taking a moment to brush the dishevelled hair out of Draco's eyes. For the first time he was looking at Draco in a different light. His features were softer when he wasn't sneering or spitting hate. His eyes filled with desire and a longing to be touched. Harry then ran his fingers through Draco's hair and gripped it hard, tugging him up so his ear met Harry's lips where Harry whispered softly
Harry sat down next to him and placed a hand on his back "Please don't feel ashamed, Draco. We both want this"
"It.. it was a part... I was just being dominant... playing my role... you know that"
"Because you came onto me!" Draco cried, feeling pain surfacing so heavy it was suffocating him "You started this! I never asked for this but I guess that doesn't matter to you, does it? You play with peoples feelings and never feel the consequences because you're 'perfect saint Potter' who can do no wrong!" he spat, stepping back from Harry. He wiped the kiss from his lips with his sleeve and stood before him, overwhelmed and hurt
"Call it whatever you want"
"Tell me if it's too much"
"You didn't punish me for the way I spoke to you today" Draco asked, looking up at him
Harry turned to face him, sensing Draco's hesitation "I know we annoy each other to death most of the time and I really want to punch you in your smug face but... I won't hurt you, okay? We won't do anything you're not comfortable with"
"I guess you've still got a bit more exploring to do then" Harry joked but Draco didn't laugh. He realised that what had happened with him and Harry occurred so naturally. The frustration and biting at one another lead to kissing which lead to sex. It felt easy, and right. The thought of actually seeking out someone new was daunting
"I... what?"
The words were stabbing Harry like knives but what hurt him more was he couldn't even deny it. He felt so guilty for starting this
Malfoy was growing irritated with Harry's smug attitude, snapping back "Look, I don't exactly know what I felt yesterday, alright?" he crossed his arms in frustration "but... I liked it. I...I sort of, maybe... want to feel it again"
Draco took a breath and turned his head to the side, looking behind him. Anything for Harry not to see the pain rising in him but he still caught on. "Are you crying?" Harry asked. Draco looked down at his feet and took another steady breath. Placing his food to one side he rubbed his face in his hands and sniffed. Tears began welling in his eyes
"You don't want to touch me?" Harry teased
"No, no you didn't"
Harry opened his eyes more, caught by intrigue "Go on.."
"No" Harry shook his head with a sympathetic smile "Tonight I wanted you to be looked after"
"Class dismissed! Please all of you, remember that your parchment must be handed in at the end of Friday's class and I will not be accepting anything later!"
"So... what about you, Draco?"
In that moment, time completely stopped when their lips met. Draco's heart wanted to burst from his chest and his knees fell weak, his mind blacked out into nothing but pure bliss. Every touch from Harry was like pure ecstasy, he was addictive and Draco hadn't realised until now how badly he craved every single part of him. He felt starved as his hands ravished Harry's body desperately wanting to rip every piece of clothing from him right then and there.
"And some of the mornings too..." Blaise added
Draco nodded
Draco nodded biting down on his lower lip
"It's not- look, I just want you to open up to me more"
"What are you drinking?" Harry asked
"Yes Master"
"Am I going to have to gag you, Slut?" Harry growled, leaning down over him to meet Draco's face. Draco was red and flushed with humiliation, he couldn't bring himself to meet Harry's eyes "Am I?"
Harry slid his hands around Draco's waist, pulling him close into his body and caressing him tenderly. Sucking and biting his lower lip, heads tilting side to side as Draco ran one hand up the side of Harry's cheek and held him close, both of them moaning softly and aching for one another
Draco nodded
"Wha- you mean... Lily Carlson? That girl?" Draco panicked slightly, despite knowing he was totally innocent
"Fine! Fine. I won't run off again... I got scared, alright?"
Harry shook his head with laughter "For the record I much prefer this kinder Draco. Who knew you were so easy to get along with?"
He felt butterflies fill his stomach and his chest tightened every time he approached their secret room, a part of him still couldn't believe that it was Harry Potter, of all people, making him feel this way. It was madness.
Maybe he could make Draco jealous? But no, he didn't want that. He never wanted to hurt him. After everything they had done together; sharing their deepest desires, trusting one another completely, longing to make each other feel passion like never before, he couldn't see himself with anybody other than Draco Malfoy.
"Don't give me that look Draco Malfoy, you loved every minute of that!"
"Eeee-xactly!" Harry grinned, receiving a playful shove from Draco
Harry slowly pulled out and stroked his hands across Draco's back, caressing him softly while the Slytherin lay beneath him, recovering. He laid down on his side and Draco crooked his head up to meet him, his silver eyes filled with vulnerability. Harry caressed his cheek, then slowly stroked the strands of hair from his eyes as Draco looked up at him tenderly.
Harry allowed his friends to leave them be before slowly approaching Draco, checking the hallway was empty before opening his mouth
"Good boy, Draco" Harry kissed his abdomen, tracing his finger down to his groin teasing him
They finally pulled apart breathlessly, Harry pushed himself up so he was sitting against the headboard, Draco in front of him cross-legged. Harry ran a hand through his hair and reached for his glasses.
"You're still really awkward around me, aren't you?" Harry probed, smirking at how Draco always went quiet when the conversation got soppy
Their eyes met again, and this time Harry could see the wanting in Draco's. "Please don't feel ashamed Draco" he brought his hands to Draco's arms and pushed his body against him
"I'm not sure"
Both boys broke into grins. Draco sat on the bed and crossed his legs, digging into a chocolate croissant. Harry sat back against the mound of pillows and plucked grapes from the small bunch on the tray, tossing them into his mouth one by one
Harry held his tongue in a flash of anger. He exhaled through his nose and gave Ron the worst death glare "You're an arsehole"
Draco glared at him "You wouldn't do that. We made a deal"
"Oh fuck yes I love it when you call me that"
"Why is always you that has the forbidden stash hidden in your room? I swear Snape will search this place one day and you'll be expelled immediately" Draco pointed out, looking half concerned for Pansy's frequent smuggling of illicit items, and half intrigued by the mysterious concoction
Harry closed his book slowly and placed it to once side, he climbed off the bed and made his way across to Draco who was following his every move. He knelt down and met his eyes with a smile, before casting a cleaning spell for him. Draco shivered at the sensation but relaxed into it.
"Mmmm your gorgeous cock is so hard for me" Harry bit is lower lip seductively "Already leaking at my touch, you're getting my fingers all sticky, slut"
"Well!.."
"It's looking good! There's a few more things to iron out but looks like we may partner up with Zonko's Joke Shop. Freddie and I have been inventing a tonne of new products all year and we have so many ideas still!" George explained
"Really? Cause a few hours ago you seemed pretty upset that he was flirting with someone else.."
Harry thought about it for a while, laughing to himself "You're such a wind-up though"
"More..."
Harry lay in the sand for several moments before rolling onto his back, looking up at the chasers flying way above him. His vision was a little foggy, but coming back into focus. He sat himself up on his elbows, his face red, boiling with anger
"What's new with you guys anyway?" George asked, looking between Harry and Ron "Anything juicy happening at Hogwarts this year?"
Harry lips curled to a subtle smile as he checked over his shoulder one last time and gestured toward the wall
His slim legs fit gorgeously into a pair of black cropped trousers and Italian leather shoes, his shirt half tucked in and out loosely fitting his slender frame.
*smack!*
Draco made more noises. He was desperate. Biting down so hard he was close to drawing blood, his mind racing with pleasure, his body writhing for touch while filled with shame and humiliation
"Draco.." Pansy shuffled forward, stroking her hand across his arm as a way to comfort him, she hated seeing him so miserable "What did he do?"
Hermione raised her brow and shot him a look "You've been going there more often because a certain Slytherin is there, haven't you?"
"You want to cum?" Harry asked, cocking his brow
Draco faltered, he was unsure "Well... I never really gave it much thought but then yesterday, when you...well... I didn't exactly dislike it either..."
"Doesn't it" Harry smirked "Unless you're planning on recreating your sex dream then by all means, Ill meet you in there". He sat back up and reached down the side of the bed, picking up the unfinished pancakes that he'd left earlier "Besides, we can get whatever we want in here" he grinned, stabbing his fork through a strawberry
Draco took a steady breath to control his emotions and though he was practically forcing his eyes to the floor, he couldn't resist glancing across to the Gryffindor table. It was like getting his next fix. He was elated seeing Harry for a split second before the hurt and heartache resurfaced and took over
"And you will be punished" Harry leant in closer to Draco's ear from behind "For being my filthy, little whore"
Harry let a satisfied smile melt onto his face, he wiped the cum from Draco's back with his finger and held it in front of Draco's mouth "Suck it"
"Ugh! N-no Master... I l-love it" Draco whimpered through the shock
He dreamt about the way Harry touched him so tenderly despite dominating him with pure filth. The way he held him close after degrading him to nothing. The way he looked so deeply into his eyes after every forceful kiss
"Harry-"
Draco closed his eyes and leant into Harry "I want more"
"Fuck!"
Harry continued striking for over twenty minutes before trailing the end of the crop up Draco's back and placing it down beside him. He leant in close behind, and Draco could feel the hot breath in his ear
"Talking to other people behind my back-"
He sat down on the bed and looked across to Draco who was still standing awkwardly by the door
"You were right, Draco.. I do have feelings for you-"
He kissed his lips
____________________________
Dean poured two glasses of punch and handed them across to the twins who necked them together
"Please..." Draco begged but Harry just continued teasing him, stroking up and down gently and fondling his balls, before leaning forward and gliding his tongue up the shaft of Draco's cock "You're dripping now, Slut"
Draco was still smiling wickedly which was winding Harry up more "Poor Potter! How terrible for you not getting your way like you always do" he rolled his eyes
"Sort of... not intentionally... I just... I don't know what to do, I shouldn't be feeling this way" Draco snapped, angry with himself for letting Harry see him at his weakest
"Anyone?"
He picked up the collar and unfastened the clasp at the back, pulling it around Draco's neck and clicking it back into place. He tightened the leather around his neck, just enough for Draco to feel it dig into his skin and held the leash that attached to it. He stood back up, looking down at the blonde who was at his feet
"Well I've been with people, obviously... just... the kink stuff... being dominated" he blushed saying the words out loud "I know I want it... so badly"
"Why did you kiss me?" Draco muttered with furrowed brows "In the showers... before? Why me?"
"Avoiding you? I spent half the night on my knees for you. Ill see you later" Draco turned back to the door but Harry leapt off the bed. He caught Draco's wrist pulling him backward and Draco yanked his arm away, frustrated "Look, I know we enjoy doing what we do but I would also appreciate some alone time as well, thanks"
"I feel the same" Draco whispered, looking down at the floor
"Fuck.." Draco cursed under his breath
Harry came closer, keeping an eye out for passing students "Draco, I never planned for it to go this far... I thought we would hook up once and move on"
He finally relaxed into the sheets, dropping his legs back down, breathless and filled with ecstasy. He closed his eyes for a moment to gather himself, then reopened them with a smile, he looked almost drunk with happiness. Harry began grinning back, admiring the sparkle in Draco's silver eyes that were so filled with lust
"No..." Draco answered, unsure on where to go next "This whole thing is just-"
Malfoy didn't make eye contact, but there was a smirk on his face. Harry hated admitting it, but Malfoy looked good in just a towel. His body was pale and slender, his arms and back toned slightly. He was in shape, most likely from the Quidditch, and his long legs carried him gracefully as he walked
"You did so well, Draco" Harry whispered, stroking a finger along his cheek  "You don't need to feel ashamed"
She marched off back to the castle along with the final stragglers of students. Harry headed back to the shower rooms with Draco close behind him. He was furious and didn't want to spend another second in his company.
Harry bent down coming close to Draco's face, gracing his cheek with his fingers and Draco shivered at his touch. Harry flicked his wand producing the same leather collar he'd used on Draco before, and saw as his eyes lit up
Draco did as he was told, he began unbuttoning his shirt, exposing his milky white chest and the muscles that flexed underneath as he moved. He tossed it aside and stepped out of his trousers, lowering himself slowly to the floor and looking up at Harry feeling his cock twitching tight in his underwear. He got to his knees, thankful to be resting on the woollen rug to soften the ground.
"It could be worse! Cheers boys!!" Fred and George clinked glasses and took another swig
"I want to fuck your tight little hole and make you scream my name"
________________________________
"Please Master.. 's feels.. s-so good.." Draco moaned, barely forming the words together
"Obviously not" Harry rolled his eyes "Draco, join me"
"No, not really"
"Last night.. did I upset you?" Harry asked
Harry kissed him again urgently and Draco moaned into his lips, sliding his fingers through Harry's hair and grabbing tight
"Quiet Slut, I make the demands"
Draco was whining in arousal now, his cock pressed against Harry's groin. Harry looked down with a smirk, enjoying Draco's desperation. "You're not allowed to cum, are you Slut?"
Pansy hastily joined them on the bed, sitting cross-legged and placing a comforting hand on Draco's leg, leaning in and looking deeply into him as though trying to read his mind, waiting for his response
Please be kind in the comments :)
Draco sniffed, and calmed his breathing, eventually looking up at Harry "You're not judging me?"
No one else existed in that moment, they didn't care about the risks of being seen or the repercussions that would surely come after this. The only thing that mattered was each other, realising what they had lost and how much it hurt to be apart
"Maybe. I'm not sure. I haven't exactly figured out myself what I am yet anyway. Besides, if I am gay I have no idea how I'll break the news to my father"
Draco looked back over his shoulder, biting his lip in anticipation. His cock was already stiff just being on all fours for his master. He nodded and turned back to facing the headboard. He could hear Harry kicking off his shoes and tossing his clothes on the floor behind him
" Harry growled
Draco stifled more cries against his gag and pushed back hard, feeling his hole totally stretched and used by Harry. He felt as Harry sped up more aggressively and began cursing under his breath. He dropped his head back and slammed inside him hard feeling his orgasm pulsating through him. Draco's hole was slick and tight and gripped Harry's cock perfectly. Harry felt overcome with waves of pleasure as he cried out. "Fuck! Draco! Yes Draco! I love this! Oh fuck me!"
He stroked it slowly, peering down towards Draco at his feet, totally naked aside from the collar and cuffs. He tugged his cock harder and positioned it in front of Draco's reddened lips, which was already dripping with salvia from their heated kiss
"I don't..."
"Going silent on me and running away doesn't sound like handling it to me"
Draco licked heavily up the shaft and felt Harry arching his back, climaxing fiercely and shooting his load deep into Draco's mouth. He slid his fingers through Draco's hair and gripped down hard, thrusting and jerking through his orgasm "Fuckkk yes... suck my cock you little slut" Harry gasped and cursed, feeling every nerve radiate with pleasure before breaking into a smile feeling the sensation wash over him
Harry went back to sitting and Draco sat up on his elbows, looking up at Harry "You would kiss me in front of all those people?"
Draco tried to find the words but the growing silence said it all
Harry slid his hands down the side of Draco's body until he reached his arse, he squeezed the skin hard between his fingers and simultaneously bit down onto his neck. Harry could feel Draco's throbbing cock aching against his own groin
"Your eyeliner is fucking hot" Blaise commented, admiring Draco's look "It pairs so well with your all black outfit too"
"Draco, why are you doing this? What we just did was incredible, please don't ruin it now" Harry pulled his hand away, bringing his arms to his chest. Draco looked at him with longing but his throat felt tight, tears stung the back of his eyes
"Say it" Draco growled
"No, I'm talking about earlier today, when you we're antagonising me in the corridor, and again yesterday calling me and my friends names in charms class-"
"Sure!" Neville turned back to tag along with Seamus and Katie Bell while Harry headed toward the door, noticing that the Slytherins had already left the classroom
"In front of everyone?"
"How?"
"I'm just playing-"
"Are you enjoying your spanking, Slut?"
Draco swallowed feeling panic setting in. Would Harry really expose him just like that?
Draco nodded slowly in a way that showed he understood
"You look really good"
"You want to feel degraded and ashamed for being my little whore?"
Harry sucked Draco's lower lip before dragging his tongue up his jawline and onto his neck where he nibbled his ear and whispered "Is this proof enough for you?"
"Are you gonna stand there all night or...?"
"that does sound sooo much more enticing than charms class"
Draco said nothing, he halted on the spot, his eyes scanning the floor for something to say but the pain began to overflow, crashing over him causing tears to well in his eyes, his lower lip trembling
"No" Draco moaned, taking another bite of his toast and barely looking up from his plate
"I have to go" Draco muttered, throwing his trousers on and swiping his tshirt from the side.
"You're so desperate for me"
"Please... fuck... Potter..."
It was Harry
Harry slid his fingers through the back of Draco's hair and tugged his head backward, bringing him closer. He thrusted deep in and out, moaning under his breath feeling Draco's heat wrapping around his cock gorgeously
They repositioned, Draco laying over the bed, his arms stretched out in front of him, his legs spread apart. Harry had laid out the implements in front of Draco as a reminder of what was coming. Draco stifled his moans of pleasure as the hot arousal filled every inch of him. He loved being in this position, especially for Harry
"No touching" Harry ordered, and Draco moved his hands behind his back
Draco nodded fiercely "I've b-been so good, Master" Draco pleaded
Draco began making his way back to Harry who caught him off guard by pouncing onto him, pushing him against the wall. He forced himself onto Draco's lips desperately and caressed up and down his torso, feeling the bulge in his pants growing tremendously. Harry then kissed up to his neck fiercely
Harry then reached around from behind and began stroking Draco's throbbing cock causing Draco to yelp at his touch, ecstasy rippling through him
Harry hissed at the sudden contact, feeling the heat from Draco's mouth engulf his hardness. Draco's tongue licked him up and down his shaft gorgeously, teasing the tip before sucking hard and taking it all. Harry thrusted into his mouth, pinning his head in place with his hands
"How does that feel?" Harry asked
Harry pushed his groin harder between Draco's legs, he stroked his stinging arse cheek once more and slid his fingers down between his legs, teasing his balls and touching his cock
"And you're not gonna expose us?"
"Quiet, Slut. You're to be fucked, not heard" Harry bit, grabbing the back of Draco's head with one hand and forcing his mouth down onto his hard, leaking cock
"Oh! Shit! Um.. my bad... still half asleep" Harry uttered, scrambling up the runaway cereal. Ron chuckled as he tucked into his toast
"Will you show me.. next time?" Draco asked "I really loved what you did before.. when you spanked me"
"I swear to Merlin, Potter... if you breathe a word about this I will hex your arse so bloody hard-"
"You know what would be prettier?" Harry whispered, leaning down into Draco's ear seductively
*SMACK!*
"and?"
"As you wish" and with that another fast smack came down on Draco's arse, causing a muffled cry as he bit down onto his arm. Harry traced the end of the crop along his skin, teasing him with it before bringing it down across his pale flesh in quick succession.
Harry bowed his head fumbling through his mind to find the right words to say "I-I'm sorry that I upset you"
"Ah fuck! L-lumos!"
"Which is?"
"Mmm you like that, slut?" Harry moaned in his ear, Draco nodded desperately with wide eyes, his cock twitching below
There was a long silence that filled the room. Harry stroking Draco's hair while he lay with his head on Harry's chest, surrounded by the warmth from both their bodies pressed together
Their eyes locked together and for a moment they couldn't break apart. Harry noticed how sad Draco looked, instantly feeling a yearning in his stomach to comfort him, to hold him and kiss him. Every feeling from before resurfaced upon seeing the beautiful blonde
He kissed his cheek
Draco bit down onto Harry's neck and sucked hard causing Harry to yelp at the sudden sting from his lovers teeth. He let another moan escape feeling Draco licking up his jawline before teasing his earlobe, his hot breathing sending tingles through every nerve on Harry's body
Harry slipped his fingers underneath the tie around Draco's mouth and pulled it down, leaning forward to catch Draco's lips with his own. He kissed him gently, their eyes closing in a moment of quiet reflection before smiling together as Harry stroked Draco's cheek
Draco walked across to the door and opened it, checking there was no one outside. He turned back to see Harry, who was still kneeling on the bed naked, confused at his eagerness to leave. He met Harry's eyes and with a wistful smile which masked the shame burning into him and walked outside, closing the door behind him
Harry closed his eyes and tried to distract himself but Malfoy's words were ringing in his ears. He wasn't weak, not in the slightest. Maybe he wasn't as bold and brazen as him but he certainly wasn't weak. He felt himself growing more irritated as the thoughts ran through his mind
"Sounds like you're doing well for yourselves then" Harry beamed
Draco just stared at him, still overwhelmed
"Oh! I almost forgot!" Pansy burst out, striding over to her dresser and opening up the last draw on the bottom right. She pulled out a small glass bottle filled halfway with a pearlescent green liquid that shimmered with stardust and swirled by itself
"Harry! Oh! Fuck Harry! You're amazing! Yes! Ahh Harry!" Draco cried
Pansy smiled "And the way you bicker with him lately... it's as though your heart isn't in it anymore"
"I don't care" Draco moaned "Please.. fill me"
Draco closed his eyes again and dropped his head back against the door as Harry closed in on him once more. Harry's hands slipped around his waist, up his shirt and he dug his nails into Draco's back causing him to cry out and bite down onto Harry's shoulder
"Yeah. It was kinda... hot" Draco grinned
"That's not what I said-"
"I'll see you around"
Harry leant in beside him and noticed his face was streaked with tears, his eyes red and glassy "Draco?"
"I know" Harry stroked the hair from Draco's eyes, caressing his cheek
"love y-your cock" Draco breathed
"Yes" Draco muttered, barely audible
"You don't have it in you anymore? You were just putting it all on for show?"
He admired how grand it felt to be standing in the space that Draco had spent his youth growing up in. He could understand now why he took so much pride in his house and what it stood for, everything around him screamed 'Draco'. The room was stylish and extravagant, flaunting expensive treasures and oozing charm and he imagined this is what the inside of Draco's mind looked like. As well as daddy issues and handcuffs.
"Absolutely nothing!" Harry interrupted with a forced smile and Ron pressed his lips together with a nod
"Draco, I didn't-"
"Always carrying her books with her" Pansy added
"I'm not using you-look, if you want to leave, Malfoy then leave. I'm not going to force you into anything... unless you want me to" Harry said plainly
Harry gradually joined him, sitting carefully beside Draco on the bed. He slipped his hand over Draco's and linked their fingers together. He then turned to face him
"Enough! I don't want to hear it. I will be keeping a close eye on both of you and if i see even a hint of foul play I will not hesitate to ban you. Now, shower, get dressed and I expect to see you both back in the Great Hall in time for dinner, no exceptions"
"Draco.. please.. you're always safe here.. with me"
Harry leaned forward, placing the tip of his fingers on Draco's chin, pulling him up until their eyes met. He was close to him now, their bodies almost touching
"Either" she grinned, and finally Harry cracked a smile too along with Ron
Harry climbed into the bed behind him, placing one hand on Draco's shoulder and gestured him up into a kneeling position. Draco sat back, feeling Harry's torso press against his back, their thighs touching, Harrys erection pressing into the top of Draco's arse
Malfoy simply smirked at him "Sore loser much?"
"'M s-so c-close, please M-master, fuck me... harder" he moaned out barely able to string his words together
Harry's smirk twisted into laughter as he ridiculed him for his current submissive state "Look at yourself"
Harry broke the kiss with a wicked smile, seeing the surprise on Draco's face, satisfied that he had found a way to shut him up. Draco stood there totally aroused, his cock was aching and he had no idea why
Draco laid for a moment in the silence, letting his orgasm wash over him, trying to regain his breath. He was filled with total shame and humiliation. Nobody had ever seen him weak before, or vulnerable, or submissive.
"My cum suits you, Slut" Harry smirked, running one hand through his sweaty hair
He suddenly pulled back with a smirk "Ohh... you want it so badly, don't you?"
"There was one night... I fell asleep in his arms. I just felt so loved. I've never felt like that before. Everything in that moment was so perfect.  They way he held me.. and kissed me... that's more than just a causal hook up..."
Draco nodded against Harry's head then pulled back breathlessly "As long as we keep this just between the two of us?"
"Ohh poor Draco.." Harry mocked, crouching down to Draco's level but the blonde still couldn't meet his eyes "You're such a mess"
Draco was instantly aroused, and he could feel Harry's hardness also poking into his stomach
Draco gathered himself, regaining normal breaths and wiping stray tears with the back of his palm. He felt the heaviness of shame and embarrassment knowing he was crying over Harry. He dreaded their reaction
"Ah!" he winced
"Well you're never gonna get over him if you're stalking him, mate!" Ron laughed
"Didn't he tell you he was falling for you?" she asked "People don't change their feelings that quickly"
Within seconds Draco had exploded. His cries and moans of pleasure filled the room and Harry watched as he climaxed hard, shooting cum all over his stomach and thighs. It dripped off of him slowly as he regained himself, reality of his state sinking in
"It's so hard" Draco smiled "The willpower it takes not to smack your stupid head sometimes Is unbelievable"
"Tosser"
"Ah! Fuck" Draco winced "Please... f-fuck me.. "
"No... master" Draco moaned
"You look gorgeous when you climax, Draco" Harry whispered, caressing the hair out of Draco's eyes, Draco kept his face to the floor, he actually felt bad for him, not used to seeing him so quiet
"I know" Draco agreed
Draco faltered for a moment "This is our secret, right?"
"Is it.. Potter?" she asked timidly. Draco shot her a look of both confusion and panic, realising he'd masked himself terribly
Harry was still asleep, his breathing was shallow and head tilted to the side facing Draco, who  perked up, sliding his arm carefully from under the pillow which held Harry's head. He propped himself up on one elbow and looked down at the sleeping boy, stroking his cheek softly
For those of you, like myself, that are immersive readers (you like to set the mood with sounds/lighting/smells etc) I've decided to try something. If you want to get into the 'party' feel whilst reading this chapter I have included names of song titles that are playing throughout the scenes (just suggestions, by all means put on your own Slytherin playlist). This helps me get a stronger feel for what's happening in the chapter, so If you're into that then plug your music in, set your green LED lights and enjoy lmao
They rested in silence for a moment before Draco let out a long sigh "Ugh, we should really get to class now, we're gonna be late"
Harry was irritated now. Biting his tongue to stop from snapping. Why was Malfoy antagonising him? And why did he have to do it in the showers of all places?
Draco shook his head with a painful smile that concealed his breaking heart, tears glossed his eyes "I trusted you, Potter"
Draco shook his head. Pansy joined Draco in staring at his occupied fingers while Blaise spoke on behalf of both of them, asking the questions she had too
"Meet me tonight? I can really give you what you want" Harry said, closing his eyes and resting his forehead against Draco's, the two of them confused at how they'd ended up here so suddenly
"I never thought.. I would t-tell anyone... a-about my fantasies.. let alone y-you" Draco spoke through tears
Draco's eyes were wide, his mouth dropped open trying to comprehend what had just happened. Harry laughed to himself as he released Draco's wrists and caressed his hip, wrapping his hand around and squeezing his arse cheek playfully
"Are we getting wrecked tonight, boys?" Seamus called, swigging his drink and bouncing to the music "I think so!" he necked the rest of it with wild eyes, grinning from ear to ear. The other boys joined in with their cheers, buzzing with adrenaline as the music blared out, vibrating through their bodies. Harry downed the rest of his drink hoping to feel the effects of calm washing over him
Harry dropped his head into his hands and rubbed his face in despair "I can't stop thinking about him! That's not normal is it? I mean, we weren't even dating"
"No..." Harry's smile dropped as he span around to face the room and saw Draco, resting against the armchair next to another boy. He was tall with dark blonde hair and was eyeing Draco up like a treat. They we're laughing together, Draco placing his hand on the boys arm, his body language open and inviting. Harry's heart smashed to the floor and Hermione and Ron turned around to see what had caught his attention
"Please.."
"I'm sorry!" Harry said raising his hands in defence "I will tell you guys, I promise.. just-"
Harry was kneeling beside Draco at his hip, he ran his hand across him gently, stroking from his arm down his body before smacking him hard on the arse
Harry darted back to the wall, flushing with embarrassment at being caught. He wasn't sure if Malfoy knew what he was into. He'd told his friends that he was into men, and figured they wouldn't really spread it around, but he couldn't be sure. Did Malfoy know he was gay?
"My mistake" Draco hissed, shoving his glass back down onto the table ready to walk away but Harry's frustration bit back as he grabbed Draco's wrist and pulled him close
Malfoy began lathering up soap between his hands as he carried on talking, still facing the shower wall "I get it, you're a sore loser, it's fine-"
"You won't!"
"Look at me" Harry called
"Soon, Slut. I want to make you beg for it. You haven't earned it yet" Harry threw his shirt over his shoulders and Draco slumped against the sink. Harry walked back over to him, running one hand through his messy hair and span him around so they were facing. He held his arms and kissed the tip of his nose softly
"Yes, you do Harry" Draco huffed, still smiling as a way to keep the tension low "I ask you time and time again what this is, and you make it very clear that it's not a relationship"
"Just something for you.. to cum on.." Draco whispered
Draco nodded, taking a slow inhale and looking down at his feet again. His chest tightened as he felt Harry looking into him "Do you really mean it... when you say.. 'you belong to me'?"
Harry chuckled to himself, looking down at the floor "I wanted to shut you up"
"See you at dinner, Harry" one of the Gryffindor boys called out
Harry exhaled slowly, collecting himself "I don't want to talk about it, ok?"
"Please what?" Harry asked, striking his hand down on Draco's arse in another harsh smack
"Malfoy's kissing Potter!!"
Harry looked up at Draco with is mischievous smile, gliding his tongue across his teeth seductively. He planted gentle kisses across either side of Draco's thighs, holding him against the wall with his hands. Draco moaned out as he then held his tongue in front of the tip, making Draco wait painfully for his touch
"Oh please! I wasn't even facing you! I didn't know you were behind me"
"Something's happened and... I'm annoyed at myself and unsure on what to do now..." he answered
"I'm kidding!" Harry broke into a grin. He pushed himself off the wall and walked over to Draco, who had furrowed his brow in annoyance "Well, actually I do still want that as well but really I wanted to make sure you we're doing okay"
As realisation hit him, he slumped back into the sheets, still panting and sweaty from the exhilaration. He pulled back the covers and saw that his cock was throbbing, pre-come leaking over his stomach
"Ohhhhh!" Draco was so close to the edge, holding back seemed impossible
As he reached the top of the steps away from the main crowd, Harry caught sight of Draco and stopped dead, seeing him perched on the side of the leather armchair, one leg kicked up by his chest, the other swinging loosely at the ground as he sipped his drink with ease and met Harry's eyes
Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes. He stood back under the shower and turned the water to cold
"Did you tell him? That you want more?" she asked
"You did so well, was that your first time?" Harry asked
He kissed his neck
"Nice to see you too" Harry smiled
"Oohh!! And Potter's lost control of his broom! Crashing down into the sand below! Looks like Gryffindor are going to be out of the points in this game after all! What a loss!" Lee Jordan's excited voice bellowed across the quidditch pitch amongst the cheers and boos of spectating students
Harry hesitated, turning to Hermione to gauge her opinion. She broke into a smile and shrugged "It could happen"
Draco scoffed, tongue in cheek at Harry's remark "Of course you did" he whispered
Draco pulled his wand from his back pocket and sharply pressed it into Harry's neck. Harry flinched and held his breath seeing Draco's darkness emerging
____________________________
"You just want to be covered in my cum is that it?"
All three took it in turns to swig from the bottle, wincing at the sharp sweetness that hit the back of their throats. There was an instant kick and Draco could feel his entire body relax, his racing heart calming and he was filled with a sense of tranquillity
Harry couldn't help by smile smugly, feeling pleased with himself "I think your erection spoke for itself really..."
"Yeah. I want to be here. I love being tied up but tonight I want to feel like I'm in this position out of choice, not because I'm trapped"
"Sometimes?" Ron added under his breath
"I feel so disgusting" Draco whispered through ragged breath. His voice cracking as Harry saw his eyes glassing over with fresh tears
"You're just a cum-rag for me, aren't you" Harry breathed into his ear looking at him in the mirror
"Fuck me... please... harder"
Draco thought for a moment, his eyes closed and lips parted with pleasure "spanking.. please"
Their sex was hungry and desperate, as though they were animals starved of any speck of intimacy. Their minds and bodies filled with a mixture of pure adrenaline, ecstasy, passion. Every touch made Draco crumble with pleasure, every stroke made Harry moan for more.
"How are you hungry right now?"
Draco just stared at her, pouting in frustration, still twirling the thread of his jumper sleeve that he'd pulled down over his hands
"Yes"
"W-what... was in... that punch??" Ron asked between throwing his arms around
"If I find out you touched yourself, you will be severely punished"
"If I have to" Harry smirked, "Now get off the bed and strip for me"
Pansy beamed with happiness, squeezing his hand and Draco laughed along with Blaise "honestly the sex is just... mind-blowing"
Draco bit down onto Harry's shoulder, his cock was painfully hard and desperate for release. Harry was describing every dirty fantasy he had
"Yes...?"
"You're a coward, Harry"  he whispered, dropping his head back against the wall as the tears arrived. Little did he know, that it was far from over...
"That's it slut, beg for me" Harry fisted his cock fiercely, admiring Draco squirming at his feet completely powerless
"This party is terrifying!" Neville exclaimed
"I know I do, Slut"
There was a large, round bed at the back, covered in silk sheets and mounds of soft pillows. The room was dimly lit and cosy. Harry kicked off his shoes and pulled his t-shirt over his head, his unruly hair bouncing in all directions. Draco thought he looked cute as his brunette curls flopped over his forehead
"Would you like me to restrain you tonight, Draco?" Harry asked, stroking up his thigh and along his back as he too positioned himself behind him
Harry reached around and grabbed Draco's arse cheek in one hand, squeezing hard then smacking it, at the same time he launched himself onto Draco's exposed neck and bit down, sucking the skin hard enough to bruise. Draco cried out at the sharp pain, dropping his bag to the floor and lulling his head back against the door
Wow this one took a long time to write!
*SMACK!*
Draco woke up the following morning still curled into the sheets. His hair had flopped over the pillow and he scrunched his eyes as the morning light invaded the room. He stretched his arms a little, rolling onto his back but feeling something solid against his side
Draco thought for a moment "P-paddle.. please"
"Yes, Draco?"
"You're just a fuck toy for me" Harry whispered, letting his cock slide between Draco's legs, touching his arse and balls "A filthy little cum-rag to toss aside when I'm done with you"
"I never broke your trust!" Harry shot back "I've kept this whole thing a secret! I haven't told anyone about your fantasies and desires and I never will!"
Harry smiled in awe of him and took the other plate, waving his wand beside him where a pot of coffee appeared too
"You are a good sex slave aren't you" Harry smirked "Preparing yourself for your Master"
Draco just looked at it with a plain expression, annoyed that Harry always had one over on him "You just won't let me leave, will you?" he bit, but the corner of his mouth slipped to a smile
"Soon?" Draco asked
They stopped outside of the door that Harry was sure lead into Draco's bedroom. His heart was pounding in his chest because everything he'd been dreaming of since the day Draco left was to be right back here in this very moment, knowing that Draco wanted him again was like a wave of pure adrenaline
"Look, Draco... if you're having second thoughts about this-"
"And I'm going to slap him in the face regardless for upsetting you"
"Exactly, and?"
Harry had never been in the Slytherin common room before (that Draco knew of anyway) and finally here he was. Draco thought of how easy it would've been to get Harry into his bed now, only a short distance away, lock the door behind them and fuck all night. Nobody would even hear their cries of pleasure above the music anyway. It frustrated him that the one time Harry was actually here, was the only time Harry was no longer his
"Don't you understand how mortified I am right now?! I exposed my deepest darkest desires to the one person who could've easily used it against me and now you'll always have that over me! It's humiliating knowing you've seen me like that... on my knees in front of you... being degraded by you... I can't look at you the same anymore!"
"Because we never agreed on that" Harry said plainly, his stomach knotted with uncertainty
"It's not that easy, Hermione" Harry bit "Especially living in the same place as him. When I go to breakfast; he's there, when I'm in my classes; he's there, when I visit the library; he's th-"
Draco looked back up to Harry after several moments. His smile faded to a distant look, knowing what was coming
_________________________________
"Please what?"
Harry, Ron, Dean and Seamus were lost in the crowds, dancing poorly to the music that was thumping through the air, singing so loud they could barely hear themselves, continuously bumping into others in the darkness and spilling their drinks with little care whatsoever
"You know you want it" Harry finally whispered in Draco's ear causing him to shudder at the sensation. Harry then bit down on Draco's neck
His eyes were fixed on Harry's, taking in every reaction as he withdrew his mouth slowly, teasing the tip with his tongue before going down deep again. He could see Harry's legs beginning to tremble and his eyes fluttered with the intense pleasure building up inside of him
"Sort of.." Draco admitted
But he left. Walking out without even a second glance back, hiding the hurt and anger that consumed him. Harry watched painfully as Draco passed through the doors, which slammed shut with a bang leaving him standing alone in the silent room, his own heart aching.
"Will my Slut let me fuck his hole?"
"Fuckkk" he moaned, clasping his eyes shut, arching back into the mattress. Harry smiled to himself watching Draco thrust and beg beneath him. He placed his knee between Draco's thighs and spread his legs open wider
Draco sighed, tongue in cheek "Because I ran away before you could sooth it"
Harry sighed, running his hand through his hair to push back the strands that kept falling over his glasses, resigning himself the fact that his whole heart was hurting and it felt as though nothing out there could make him feel truly happy again. He considered the idea of easing himself in with some forbidden drink, regaining his recently diminished confidence and chatting up another gorgeous guy in the darkness of the party.
"Get on all fours"
"Come on, Harry" her voice softened "It's been a week now, you must find other ways to distract yourself from thoughts of... Draco" she whispered that last part
The boy leant in and whispered something in Draco's ear, causing Draco to smile back enticingly. Harry felt himself seethe with jealousy, he could barely peel his eyes away
*SMACK!*
"So you don't actually care if I flirt with someone else?"
"It's pathetic" Harry smacked his arse hard and Draco cried out in shock
Pansy and Blaise both grimaced at the idea
"Or cake hate!" Pansy teased "C'mon Draco, he's cute, dressed well and clearly showing an interest in you... if you don't snag him up I will"
Draco swallowed his food, clearing his throat "I um... I'm still rather foggy on those details to be honest. You're the first guy I've been with and.. I really like it"
Draco held his tongue and glanced back at to the crowd past her shoulder to check they were still alone before whispering "We've already had the forbidden potion in your room now this! I don't want to end up in the hospital wing tonight!"
Harry chuckled at his cluelessness "Because you're avoiding me"
Draco nodded, stifling cries of pleasure as Harry stroked his cock and balls from behind. He so desperately needed to beg and moan and cum right into Harry's hand, his touch electrified him, like every hair stood on end, ever nerve on fire. His cock was already leaking, pre-cum falling from the top of his erection
"I never thought I'd say this but... giving you what you want... making you happy.. makes me happy too"
"Mmm.. I fuck you good.. don't I?" Harry groaned between thrusts
Harry's breath caught in his throat, and this time Ron couldn't stifle the laughter
"Don't push me.." Harry growled, stepping in closer
Draco looked out past the crowd and locked eyes with Harry who was across the floor, absent-mindedly watching Draco enjoying himself. Harrys expression stopped when he realised Draco was looking at him, kicking himself for being caught but he couldn't pull his gaze. As though his thoughts could penetrate Draco's mind, he looked at him with eyes of longing, and Draco felt the pit of his stomach drop. He so badly wanted to forget Harry but it was impossible. His mind was filled with every memory of him, every emotion
Harry was sat beside Dean and Neville, engrossed by something in Neville's textbook. He was glad Harry was distracted, it allowed him more time to fixate on his perfect features that Draco missed caressing so much
Harry's heart was hammering in his chest at being so impulsive, knowing that any moment now Draco might scream and punch him but it was worth it, worth it just to see the reaction on his face, to watch him squirm beneath him for once
*SMACK!*
"Hm?" Harry looked up from his drink
"No way are they snogging?!"
"Have they hurt you?" Pansy asked
"P-Potter...?"
"At least you'll punish me for it in here" he winked
"And you know you can use that certain word whenever you need to.." Harry's voice softened as his fingers stroked him delicately. Draco remained quiet, caught up in the intensity of their bonding but Harry was sure he saw a smile grace Draco's lips as he bit down on them in arousal
"I always get my way??" Harry repeated in disbelief, almost laughing
Harry moaned as he thrust further in and out, gradually speeding up and gaining a rhythm. Draco looked down at his cock that was leaking pre-cum onto his stomach already and Harry began stroking it
"Will you take it slow?"
"You saw him didn't you.." Ron grimaced
"Really boring this year" Ron added in the most sarcastic tone "Nothing interesting happening at all...."
I really hope you guys enjoy this chapter <3 :)
"That's right" Harry smirked, stroking Draco's cock with one hand and gracing the entrance to his hole with the other "What are you?"
Draco looked unbothered. Raising his brow and scanning Harry up and down with his eyes before turning his gaze away. Harry felt a lump in his throat. Draco looked hot, really fucking hot and even worse, he looked disinterested which drove Harry crazy
Pansy nodded in agreement, taking his hand "It's okay to show feelings"
"Like you're making a mistake?" Harry asked, feeling the pit of his stomach twisting
"You keep saying.. that I 'belong to you' but.. when I ask you where we're really going... you change the subject"
"You're still fucking annoying though" Harry moaned "I swear, if you make fun of me one more time I will not hesitate to put you in your place, right there in front of everyone"
"That proves nothing" Draco spat, yanking his arm away. They stood staring at one another, riled up from the heated conversation but no words came. Harry felt horrible for the way he'd behaved and Draco felt sick knowing how badly he missed him. He wanted to grab him and kiss him and scream at him for letting this whole thing happen but he never wanted to lose it either.
"Harry, what's the matter? You've been moody and irritable all weekend" Hermione huffed, growing annoyed at his negative state
"And this whole breakfast in bed thing isn't so bad either" he added
Draco shrugged "I'm just keeping up appearances. People will think it's weird if we suddenly start being nice to each other"
"You guys really are terrible dancers!" Ginny teased from beside them, dancing freely with Hermione amongst the crowd, the girls having far more rhythm then any of the boys put together.
"I said... Get. On. Your. Knees"
"Y-yes Master... I'm just a.. pathetic... worthless cum-slut.. for you" Draco whimpered. He scrunched his eyes shut letting his head lull back, the arousal alone was making him weak
Draco paid no attention to people staring at him. He knew what he was doing and felt no shame. Everybody figured that Draco would leave the party with someone, after all, it was Draco Malfoy, half the teenagers at school had a crush on him. However, Harry Potter was definitely the last person anyone would have expected to be snogging him. Draco smirked to himself, he always was one for going against what everyone else thought
Draco looked around to make sure they really were alone before speaking "I thought about showing up late but figured you'd have your way with me regardless"
Draco looked at him in the mirror, mouth hanging open, sweaty and exhausted
"Fuck Harry! Please!" Draco gasped
"You're nothing to me" Harry whispered in Draco's ear from behind. His trousers and underwear pulled down exposing his hard cock that he pressed between Draco's thighs
"Good" Harry spat, tugging again on his leash jerking Draco's eyes away from the floor "Maybe I'll cum on the floor and make you lick it up"
I thought I'd add some context here seeing as I haven't really clarified much in this story:
Blaise moved up the bed until he was sitting next to him, placing an arm around Draco's back. "Can I ask something?". Draco nodded. "When it started, were you two just having casual sex?"
"Harry! You were basically drooling back there! Right in front of him!" Hermione snapped
Draco parted from Blaise, climbing onto the bed resting his back against the headboard. Blaise joined him, sitting down on the sheets with his legs kicked out to one side, resting on his palms. He pulled out a bag of chocolate mints from his bag below him on the floor and offered one to Draco who declined. It was merely seconds later when Pansy knocked and entered, stepping into the room with her usual air of confidence
"Of course" Blaise smiled, wrapping a comforting arm around Draco and guiding him to his bedroom "No one wants to see you ugly crying anyway" he teased, and Draco jabbed him in the ribs with his elbow, finally breaking a smile through the tears
Harry hung his head back, tongue in cheek. He wasn't about to start an argument now. Especially while he was naked
______________________________
Draco was writhing in pure ecstasy. Every touch electrified him, he had lost his sense of being as Harry penetrated him hard and kissed him desperately
"Mmmm!" Draco whined against Harry's fingers, clasping his eyes shut and throwing his head back
He sucked down hard on Draco's pale skin, leaving harsh marks across his neck up to his ear. Draco cried out softly, closing his eyes as Harry caressed him, owning him
"Fuck" Harry spat, glaring down at the table in a panic
But the shame, the shame was stronger than anything. Feeling a sick guilt in his stomach at exposing his darkest desires, even a hint of regret stung him as he sat there afterwards. Harry Potter had done this to him and that was it. There was no changing it. He could no longer play the tough guy, the bully, not when Harry had seen him like this. But he knew deep down he would always come back for more.
Harry stepped closer until him and Draco were face to face, Draco could feel the heat radiating off his body. Harry leant in, whispering to his ear "I'll tell everyone what I did to you last week..."
Everyone else was holding their breath, watching as Draco's eyes shot open as Harry whispered in his ear. He had no comeback and remained silent
Draco thought for a moment. His mind was conflicted on whether or not this was the smartest decision to make, but his heart wanted this, he wanted Harry. He wanted his touch, his lips, his cock. What Harry had done to him in the last two days was like nothing he'd ever felt before. He was all he could think about in the last forty-eight hours
"Fine. We're indifferent to each other"
"I'd rather not" Draco bit, looking at Harry as though he were a piece of dirt on his shoe, but the icy exterior faltered, just for a second, and Harry caught a glimpse of the wounded boy who was simply holding himself together. Harry wondered if Draco missed him, and he did. Though he would never admit that he'd touched himself almost daily to thoughts of Harry and that maybe, just sometimes he'd cried himself to sleep, the memories had a hold of him and he couldn't let go
Harry finished his last grape and took a swig of juice "So you're going silent on me because...?"
Harry lowered himself enough to kiss Draco hard on the lips and suddenly it was hungry, desperate kissing. Wet and sloppy with no rhythm whatsoever. Kissing, sucking, biting one another, Harry's hands caressing Draco's cheeks, sliding from his neck up to his hair where he tugged him back and exposed his neck, biting down further
Draco was breathless, moaning senselessly with his back against the wall as Harry kneeled inches away from him
"Don't you think you've got enough of your cream on me this morning?" Draco smirked
Draco grabbed Harry's hair, deepening the passionate kiss and backing up towards his bedroom door where he kicked it open and pushed Harry through. They stumbled through the threshold of Draco's room, both still wrapped together in a heated embrace as Draco cast a locking charm and they finally found themselves alone once more, nothing else in the world mattered besides each other
"I have?"
"Alright. Sorry. You don't have to tell us any more" Pansy soothed and Draco gave an apologetic look
More soft cries escaped Draco's mouth as Harry sped up, pounding him into the sheets. Harry gripped down on Draco's thighs and dropped his head, his body was weakening as he came close to orgasm
They headed down the corridor where Harry found an empty classroom, they entered, closing the door behind them where Harry pushed himself up on the desk, swinging his feet below and  looking across to Draco as he waited for him to speak
Harry continued spanking him with the palm of his hand, the sound echoing through the room along with soft cries from Draco. His backside was red and hot and Harry could feel Draco's cock twitching against his thighs
"Then say no more!" Ron nodded with a grin. He took Hermione's hand and headed through the crowds, pushing past and squeezing through until they reached the top steps that looked down onto the centre of the common room. Ron was still dancing as he walked, and Harry followed behind him, apologising awkwardly to the people that were being hit by his flailing arms.
Draco sighed, his shoulders slumping. "Why not?"
"Incarcerous" Harry whispered, sending black rope around Draco's wrists. Draco bit his lip in pleasure and moaned out loud, unable to stifle the arousal at being helpless.
"You're lying to yourself, Potter" Draco snapped, biting back tears. Harry's chest stung hearing Draco refer to him by his surname again, like the progress they had made was regressing
"I wouldn't even know where to start. He avoids me at every chance he gets"
______________________________________
"It does feel amazing" Draco admitted, breaking into a smile
"I know"
"Wha- Potter what the fuck?" Draco muttered as Harry marched over
Draco made his way back over to the others but Pansy stopped him with the back of her hand. "Look who's here" she said, nodding toward the other side of the room where Harry was standing casually in the corner by the window, lost in conversation with his friends. The light from the lake outside was reflecting off his golden skin casting a blue-ish glow over him, the darkness carving at his sharp features
"I can handle it" Draco cut in
Draco shot up. He was still in his bed, still in the same position in fact, but it was the middle of the night, and Harry was no longer in front of him
Draco dropped his head back, closing his eyes and biting down on his lower lip filled with uncontrollable arousal "I belong with you"
Harry's eyes widened in realisation as dread set in "No. Absolutely not. I'm not going"
Harry smacked him again and watched as Draco jerked beneath him, his head buried muffling the cries, his upper back was trembling. Harry brought the paddle down again.
"You call me, Master!" Harry smacked his arse hard and Draco cried out suddenly. He pressed forward, grabbing Draco by the back of the neck and forcing his head against the wall so Draco's cheek was pressed into the stone. He leant forward into his ear "Don't you?"
"Mmm" Draco breathed as he sucked on Harry's skin, desperate to take him
"God you're so cringey" Draco huffed
Harry thrust harder into him, letting out grunts and soft moans "You don't get to cum, Slut. I get to cum, understand?"
"Good boy" Harry smiled wickedly, biting down as his hand connected with Draco's arse over and over, the sound echoing off the walls "You're only here to be used"
Harry stroked Draco's cock harder "Look at you... squirming beneath me, totally helpless... I love seeing you tied up and begging for me"
"Of course. And this time we'll take it nice and slow and afterwards I'll give you whatever you need. It's important to me to make you feel comfortable"
"It's not stalking!" Harry dropped his gaze again and began fiddling with his shoelace as a distraction "It would just be a lot easier if he wasn't everywhere all the time"
"Well, not exactly super chummy but I can't keep navigating between pretending I hate you outside of here and then dropping to my knees whenever you enter the room. It'll be easier if we're just civil all around"
Harry took a slow sip of his coffee "And I don't like spanking you until you cry"
He turned to finally face Malfoy who was busy washing himself under the water. Harry looked across the room to him, ready to argue back but his words fell short. He froze, catching sight of a naked Malfoy from behind, his perfectly toned arse and slender legs, shoulder blades poking out from his back as he scrubbed up his arms and the water ran down him gracefully. Fuck he looked good.
"Not to brag or anything.. but we looking fucking hot" Pansy said, examining herself and the boys through the full length mirror in her bedroom. She readjusted the thin strap on her lace mini dress that she'd paired with knee high black combat boots. The music from the other side of the door was thumping through the walls as the party was already in full swing and as per usual, they were fashionably late.
"I thought he was sexy in school robes and a baggy jumper but now..." Harry pinched his brow in frustration and tried to hide the growing erection in his trousers
Draco shook his head and Harry waved his wand making a mirror appear on the wall opposite. Draco moaned as his eyes met the reflection. Naked and hard on his hands and knees, the collar pressed around his neck like an animal
"Please touch me.."
Draco looked at them both, his eyes darting between them as they spoke in turn. His stomach felt sick with embarrassment knowing his friends already had some idea. How long had they known? Had he really become that weak? Draco Malfoy wasn't sensitive, or sweet, absolutely not
"You're clearly not so what is it?" Ron moaned, taking a bite of his eggs
"I go... a lot.." Harry replied, unsure of his own response
"How was your arse the other day?" Harry asked, perking up
Harry shook his head
Harry took a bite of his toast and watched as they both stared at him, waiting for some sort of response. His chewing grew slower and his eyebrow raised higher until finally he sighed in frustration
"Is someone getting tipsy?"
"Good boy. I want to see you cum, Slut" Harry said, and Draco looked at him for reassurance "I give you permission to cum" Harry cast a spell and the spread bar vanished, Draco's arms fell to his side, one hand moving onto his cock desperately
"Hi boys, I was jus-Draco? Darling, what's the matter?" Her tone instantly changed upon seeing Draco's tear-stained cheeks and pink eyes. He was still crying quietly, gulping back ragged breaths and crunching his eyes shut, dropping his head down in front of him
"This feels good?" Harry panted
Harry cocked his eyebrow in surprise and chuckled to himself "I don't think that's the best idea, Malfoy"
"It.. hurts.."
"My Slut wants me to touch him there?"
"Fuck!"
Harry didn't respond, he carried on scrubbing his arms with the foamy body wash
Harry pulled Draco in closer, the two of them were holding each other, Draco's head resting on Harry's chest with his arm hugging him close, his mind filled with a million more questions that ate away at him. Harry could feel the soft breaths on his skin while Draco felt Harry's heart beating softly in his ear. Harry pulled the covers over them as they snuggled together under the warmth, he kissed Draco on the head gently and closed his eyes
"Fuck... Harry..."
Harry began kissing down Draco's neck, licking across the love bites he'd already given him earlier in the day. He could hear as Draco was breathing heavy beneath him, stifling moans of pleasure. Draco was aching for more as he tangled his fingers through Harry's hair feeling his cock pushing against him
Draco slumped against the door, exhausted and confused about how he was feeling. He was already craving more from Harry. He'd never once mentioned anything about his submission kink. Spending countless nights touching himself, fantasizing about being somebody's bitch, being helpless and humiliated and fucked generously. If Harry was willing to give him everything he'd dreamed of and more, how could he say no?
Harry ran his fingers through Draco's hair, gripping it and yanking his head up to face him, Draco gasped at the sudden movement but Harry caught him off guard with a forceful kiss on the lips, biting, sucking and moaning into him as he tugged on his hair tightly. Harry sucked his lower lip, then dragged his tongue across Draco's cheek and up to his earlobe, nuzzling into his neck
Draco cried and groaned through each spanking. Desperation was coursing through him knowing he wouldn't last much longer.
"Jealous of my moves, Sis?" Ron cheered and Ginny cringed, rolling her eyes
"I want you over my knee"
"Wait!" Pansy called, striding over and nudging beside him, their backs to the rest of the room. Draco looked her curiously as she pulled a tiny paper bag out from somewhere in her dress "Let's make this party more exciting shall we?"
Harry pulled back and grabbed Draco's shirt at the chest, ripping it open sending buttons pinging in every direction. Draco gasped and bit his lip desperate to be touched. Harry hadn't even managed to get Draco's shirt off of him before he dropped to his knees and began undoing his belt.
Harry grabbed Draco's knees and brought them up to his chest, his arse was totally exposed for Harry as he lay on his back, trembling with arousal
"I'm kidding!" Ron blurted, throwing his hands up defensively with a pressed grin "I'm sorry... I just needed to see how you really felt"
Draco nodded gently, panting and resting his forehead against his arm that was restrained above him
His heart was so full feeling Harry loving his body once more. He'd lost all sense of being, knowing only pure pleasure and bliss
"Fuckk.. fuck!"
"And that move was totally fair! You're just a shit seeker" Harry cut in, angrily scrubbing his chest, neither of them actually looking at each other
He ran his fingers through his hair which he had grown out more than previous years. Still short on the back and sides but far longer and scruffier on the top of his head, strands of platinum blonde bouncing from his fringe and falling loosely over his forehead, forming loose and messy curtains above his brows, his usual side-parting and slicked-back style were a thing of history
"I am"
"Who do you belong to?"
Draco nodded looking down at his food "I am"
Draco huffed a laugh and buried himself in his drink trying to stifle the uncertainty ripping through his chest. He felt out of place, as though he was suppose to be having the best time and yet he felt more lonely than ever
"Definitely not boyfriends... that would be ridiculous"
"I like to... dominate" Harry said, apprehensive about Draco's reaction "Spanking, degradation, humiliation... it's my kink..." he kissed Draco's neck "and I'm not doing any of that with someone who's not ready to endure it, understand?"
"You did so well" Harry whispered. As he leant in to kiss his neck, Draco pushed up from the bed and collected his clothing from the floor. Harry could see the redness across his arse cheeks, his skin blotted from each strike of his hand "Draco?"
Harry slumped against the table, dropping his head back with a resigning sigh, feeling even more confused and desperate than before
Harry closed his eyes and took a long breath, attempting to piece together the conflict "What we have here is amazing, Draco. I never planned to be here with you but it's happened now. Why can't we just enjoy it in the moment and leave it at that?"
Harry stroked Draco's cock suddenly causing him gasp
Harry brought his hands up to Draco's cheeks and grabbed him in a hard kiss, their lips biting and sucking one another. Draco was flushed, hot shame rising through his chest at not only climaxing in front of Harry, but coming undone just from a little dirty talk
"What about the party?" Ron asked
"It's not like you to be nervous, Harry! Have you not been practicing as much?"
Draco didn't look up. "Potter"
"Wh-what's wrong?" Harry paused, and dropped the paddle as soon as he heard the word. His heart sank as he moved over to Draco, still laying into the sheets, avoiding Harry's eyes. Draco clumsily moved position, bringing himself back up to sitting on the bed, wincing at his sore backside
"Of course"
His heart was hammering his chest with each step forward. Everything had fallen into slow motion, it felt like an eternity as he drifted closer toward Draco, everyone around him was alive with the music, the air so thick with the flashing from the fireworks and heat of the bodies they might as well have been underwater
Harry stopped touching himself and grabbed his wand, casting a spell in front of Draco where his hands became locked in a spread-bar that sat behind his head. Draco's arms we're forced up and there was nothing he could do. His cock stiffened at being rendered helpless and a desperate moan escaped him as he looked up at Harry
Draco squeezed her hand a little tighter "so you guys aren't freaked out by the fact that I'm falling for.. Potter? Like the actual Harry Potter?"
"Such a filthy whore, aren't you? Such a dirty little animal on the floor for me. Maybe I'll cum into your food and make you eat it. Eat it off the floor like a fucking animal. Would you like that slut?"
He jerked against Harry's body while his cock twitched in his trousers, climaxing hard "Fuck Harry! Mmmmph!" he cried, his orgasm crashing down on him. Harry watched in delight as Draco trembled against him, moaning his name into his neck and panting heavily.
"Come here" Harry growled, sharply pulling out and tugging Draco by his hair across to the bathroom sink. Draco steadied himself placing his hands on the sink edge while Harry backed up behind him.
"Wow" Harry mouthed to himself as he closed the door behind him "I see you're ready to apologise for the way you spoke to me earlier?"
"You love pleasing me, don't you"
"I opened myself up to you! Do you have any idea the position I put myself in for you?! I've been so vulnerable, allowing you you see my most private fantasies, sharing myself with you and trusting you!"
"No climaxing until I say so, Slut" Harry whispered into his ear
He felt Harrys arms slide around him, caressing his chest and slowly moving down his abdomen, teasing him. Draco was hot with anticipation and feeling Harry so close behind him was driving him wild. He dropped his head back where his neck met Harry's lips, being kissed and sucked gently. He raised one hand and slid his fingers through Harry's hair behind him, holding him close
"Oops did I make you hard?" Harry teased, looking down at Draco's throbbing cock "Looks like you're the weak one here, Malfoy"
Draco dropped his head back against the headboard with a sigh. Guilt and regret flooding his chest. He shouldn't be here. Not with him. Now that the mask of arousal and lust was gone it was awkward and wrong.
"For what?"
"Yes.. master" Draco gasped softly against the bed, his arse still firmly on display and reddening rapidly
Draco moaned as Harry thrusted deep into him, he was grinding down on his hips, holding him in place against the wall. The pace was picking up, Harry slamming harder and faster as Draco let all sorts of noises escape him. Moans and begs and cries of pleasure. Wincing occasionally at Harry's thickness but in total bliss at the pleasure pulsating through every pore
"Good Slut" Harry slammed into him harder "I'm going to cum inside of you"
Draco pushed up from the bed and walked over to join her in the mirror, straightening out his outfit one last time. He was wearing an oversized black silk shirt, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and half the top buttons were undone which teased his toned chest from underneath, subtle silver chains hung loosely around his neck, matching the rings on his fingers.
Neither of them spoke as they both regained themselves, melting back to reality together. Harry gradually let the mask of dominance slip, opening up a safe space for Draco to recover. Draco navigated the emotions running through him; pleasure, shame, lust, humiliation, longing.
"Did you sneak back into the school or something?" Harry asked pulling George into a friendly hug, exchanging pats on the back, he was totally dumbfounded by their appearance but thrilled to see them
"Oh shut up" Draco nudged him. Harry placed his coffee down beside the bed and rolled over so he was on top of Draco, his knees either side of Draco's thighs. Their lips met instantly in a passionate kiss as Harry caressed his hands over his torso and up his neck, pulling him close. Draco moaned between kisses, which Harry planted from his lips to his chest and everywhere in between
