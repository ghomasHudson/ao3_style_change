Potter rolled his eyes and reached into his pocket. A snitch broke free from his hands and flew in between the two. "If I win, you eat this with your bare hands. If you win, I'll walk all the way back to the castle to get you a fork and knife."
"How thoughtful of you." Draco shifted his weight so that he rocked his hip towards him even more. "But, I'd rather wash you. Get up."
Following the weekend, Harry came home and spent his time catching up on classwork and dealing with adjusting to being in classes, which was more overwhelming than he thought. It did set him back, and he had to eat on his own, but he did it and continued his potion regimens. The only time Draco and Harry spent together was at night, when they shared a bed in Harry's room, doing face masks and sleeping.
After the door closed, Draco and Pansy came out from behind the arch in which they were hiding and laughed hysterically.
Then Harry wiped his face, a spiral of thoughts taking him back down. He was exhausted trying to fight it back constantly.
Draco allowed himself to smile as he sat on the edge of his bed, trying to hook the jewelry around his wrist. There was a sudden small knock at his door. "Come in."
She met his red, puffy eyes. Any humor on her face disappeared, and she grabbed Draco's arm, pulling him into her room and closing the door.
"No he's actually pretty loving, and he gets really jealous really fast so I suggest you back away or he might attack you," Harry tried getting away from him.
"I've had a nightmares practically every night, but that's just from being back here I presume. They weren't too bad. What about you?"
It wasn't a few minutes past 5 that Harry wrestled his way through the thick vines that was cutting them off from the rest of humanity. Draco didn't look up, he just continued drawing in the sand as Harry walked up to him. Harry lay down on his stomach his elbows propping him up, digging in the sand. They were so close Harry could put his chin on Draco's knee, who was in a crisscross position.
Woah woah," Harry exclaimed, pulling away the towel completely, "Scarface, not scarhead," he corrected.
Because Harry would have grabbed him, and the other Death Eaters would have seen. And even if they tried apparating away, Draco had the Mark. It was an instant locator to him. He really would have tried to save him. And it would have blown their cover. The Death Eaters would have taken him back to Voldemort. And Voldemort would kill Harry because of Draco.
Draco’s new existence was relentless. Every morning, he would escape the dormitory early, but ensure he was in position to be greeted at the entrance of the Great Hall, where Potter’s beaming smile would be stunning enough to brighten the lives of the other students gathered in the foyer.
Not really listening anymore, Harry mused that he was better at interior decoration than he’d given himself credit for. His recent and spontaneous magical adaptations to the headboard which provided sturdy vertical wooden spokes for the handy anchoring of his new restraints had worked out fairly well. Granted, only one spoke had been required to thread the handcuffs around, but he was sure Draco would find uses for the others in the future. He might keep the bed like this.
want to. But I also don’t want you to be… disappointed. If it turns out not to be… what you’d hoped for.”
Draco let the temptation to respond with a cutting jibe wash over him with the water, instead he opted for simplicity. “Are you coming?”
Their torsos pressed together as Potter’s mouth and tongue slid against Draco’s. Nice, although predictably unimpressive, but then Potter’s hand snuck its way to the nape of Draco’s neck, not precisely restraining, but firmly suggesting that Draco stay exactly where he was.
Keen to explore further, Harry moved his fingers from Draco’s shaft to sink into the curls of his pubic hair, teasing, stroking, learning. He curled his hand around Draco’s balls, cupping and weighing them, teasing that weight with a little more pressure, rolling the shapes between the pads of his fingers.

Potter didn’t provide an answer. Not that it had really been a question. Stepping back, Draco allowed Potter space to make his escape.
Harry thought he might not have seen anything cuter in his entire life. But pointing that out to Draco would probably be a mistake. He almost suggested that Draco keep Jemima out of his pocket, but Draco’s pride might not like that. And if Luna spotted the Puff, they’d never get home.
Soon, they were seated together on Harry’s squishy couch, thigh to thigh and hands still clasped. Harry rested his head on Draco’s right shoulder and stared into the fire.
Harry cast his gaze around the room; examining shelves filled with ornaments, books, and mysterious shiny objects which Harry couldn’t identify. Anywhere except Draco’s eyes. “Ron cut me off before I could tell him. He didn’t want to hear about anything… personal that happened between me and Michael. He told me that he wasn’t going to get involved and it was my responsibility to sort it out if I’d done something wrong.”
Harry dreaded what the question might be if it was causing Draco to be this nervous. But whatever it was, Malfoy evidently wanted to voice it, so Harry resigned himself to hearing it and said, “I’m learning today about the value of communication. So, ask.” Watching Malfoy’s uncertain expression, Harry hoped he wouldn’t regret that instruction.
Harry’s latest meltdown was forcing Malfoy to kneel on the floor again. Knowing how much Malfoy valued his pristine clothing, Harry’s guilt spiked.
But Michael wasn’t the only man who Harry had disappointed in that way; he’d simply been the only one to take direct action, because Harry had been able to mostly fool the others into thinking he was the person they’d wanted him to be.
Harry Potter was becoming a stalker. There was really no other appropriate word for it. Everywhere Draco went, there was Potter. In the side-lines, lingering, watching. Standing with his friends, not talking to them, but watching Draco as if he was the most fascinating thing within the vicinity.
bloody idea why he’d decided it should be ten and a quarter inch in length and even less clue why the handle should be tightly bound
They rocked together for a while, indulging in the pressure of groin against groin, mouth against mouth, building mutual appreciation. A more usual scenario would be Draco between Harry’s spread legs, but Draco hadn’t amended his straddling position, instead using it as leverage to push down. It was nice, this unhurried filling of their cocks.
Draco’s shift onto his back successfully dislodged bodily contact with Potter, who was forced to retreat essential inches to prevent himself being knocked over the edge of the bed by Draco’s elbow.
Harry silently agreed. Their previous interactions with the portrait had not gone well. A shouting match wouldn’t remove the stress of this. Harry extended an arm, trying to offer his hand in comfort. Draco’s hands remained firmly in his pockets.
He did not cheer when he heard Malfoy kneel back into position behind him, did not whoop with joy when the hands again spread his arse cheeks, did not beg when he felt the wet tip of Malfoy’s cock nudging at his entrance.
“I need to go,” Harry announced, rising from his seat. At the sight of her startled expression, he said, “It’s been great seeing you. I’ll owl you next week, if you’d like to have coffee again?”
Harry didn’t deny it, hiding further into Malfoy's shirt instead. Malfoy was there every day after all, and he saw everything. “That’s beside the point,” he mumbled into the fabric.

“Uhuh. Or we could go now. For a look.” It’s not as if Harry had anything better to do with his time. And he needed a distraction from his thoughts.
There was no obligation here. Harry had the right to refuse. Twisting back in the direction of the Weasleys’ voices, he shouted, “I don’t owe you
Worry for Potter was rising again. Draco’s life since the end of the war had improved at least enough that he’d decided to live just to spite them all. But
“Yes, it is. Or maybe not. I don’t know. But I feel… nervous. Anxious. Most of the time,” he admitted. “Always looking for… Michael now that I’ve spoken to him again. That’s why I can’t sleep. One of the reasons,” he amended.

Here,” he said, thrusting the bottle at Potter’s chest, “do whatever you want with it.” Potter grappled clumsily for the bottle, but successfully caught it between two hands. “Or don’t bother,” Draco finished, laying back down on the mattress, amazed by his own foolish persistence.

The obligatory sigh, then Potter replied, “I don’t know what to do. What’ll… help. I’m trying to figure it out, but I… don’t know.”
Draco felt the wet softness of Potter’s mouth contrasting with the scratchiness of an unshaven jaw, his mind both unusually fogged and focussed with pinpoint clarity. He didn’t know how it’d happened, but Potter was suddenly above him, straddling Draco’s hips, pressing him down into the mattress. And instead of fighting to reclaim the dominance he’d intended, Draco’s arms wrapped around Potter’s body, his whole being wholeheartedly agreeing that
? Draco had feared that Potter was dead not even a minute ago, but now he began to consider many ways to achieve that demise.
, after what Draco had so recently faced… it didn’t sit well with him. But perhaps he was overthinking, creating an issue out of nothing. He nodded.
As always after he was denied for so long, releasing the built-up pleasure seemed to go on for a while.
Once he was feeling slightly more in control and the floor was steady, Harry continued. “He told me to start… fucking him. To do it
“No, I think I’ll rest here for a while. You can show me where your bedroom is later. I’m sure I can think of something fun to do in there.”
“I’m… not sure. Maybe nothing. But I had an… inkling that you wouldn’t want him to succeed any more than I did. And when you agreed to recommend him, I thought I was right.”
Harry nodded in agreement. He was trying to think of a natural transition into another topic when Malfoy spoke again.
Draco turned his back to Potter, retrieved the blanket and wrenched it over his body to prepare for a night of petulant brooding, but after a long moment of silence, Potter spoke, hesitant and quiet.
The instant that Harry heard the familiar demand, previously spoken during too many occasions which he would rather forget, his already tenuous confidence shattered.
Malfoy took a visibly deep breath. “Well, I’m worried now that what we… do together might be due to some sort of… adverse reaction to your past.”
It took Harry what he thought might be an embarrassing amount of time to whittle the wood to the required length and shape. As he smoothed the surface, he tried to come to peace with the fact that he had
to Harry that a rip appeared vertically down the middle of the canvas as the portrait swung forward and banged heavily back against the wall with a loud thump of cracked wood against stone.
The fingers inside Harry didn’t thrust, but the digits separated and contracted, separated, and contracted… stretching and relaxing the rim of Harry’s anus in precisely the way that Malfoy knew Harry adored.
let himself screw this up by disobeying Malfoy’s order for silence. Harry would be quiet… Harry would be still, Harry would… would… bloody fucking
Harry gulped down his worry, tried to view his existence as Draco viewed it, and hesitantly spoke. “Yes. I… deserve that.”
bad.” Unobservant as ever, Potter didn’t recognise the need to let go of an unessential issue as he continued, “I mean, you seemed to… like it. Didn’t you?”
But Harry’s gaze kept drifting to the empty spot on the wall over Draco’s shoulder, which he noted that Draco hadn’t looked directly at since the destruction of the portrait.
to; Malfoy’s erection was dragging over Harry’s prostate on every stroke, and the resulting enjoyment was more than enough after his recent orgasm.
Michael dropped the useless stick of charred wood to the ground and started to back away from Harry.
“I’m not taunting you, Draco. You’re right, no exam results can change anything on their own. But you can take what’s sure to be your perfect grades and then walk away.”
Content to do as Potter wished for the moment, Draco didn’t protest. Not yet. But investigating fingers soon moved upwards to mingle with his hair, and the kiss deepened into something which Draco hadn’t been prepared for. Teeth nibbled on lips and lips sucked tongues as they fell together onto the mattress, and it should’ve been a clunky, over-eager mishmash to showcase Potter’s inexperience, punctuated with glasses digging into Draco’s cheek, and it
. You’re not the Minister anymore. Umm… the wording isn’t the most polished, but the meaning is certainly clear. And it’s magically sealed. They can’t coerce you into doing anything.”
That was now the third time that Ron had stood in a doorway and caught them about to be inappropriately intimate. It was beginning to become a habit. The second time had been in Hermione’s bathroom, after Draco just couldn’t
Beginning to feel on edge, Harry lifted his hand a few inches higher. The tug grew stronger. It wanted him to
He’d been expecting some guidance or supervision today, but Luna had simply smiled her dreamy smile, proclaimed she was confident Harry would do a delightful job and skipped out to the front of the shop to spend her morning serving customers.
To his ears, Harry's despairing laugh sounded more like a sob. He wished that Malfoy would touch him, but also prayed that he
As Draco released him, Harry allowed himself to be guided to the bench and sat, unsure what to do now that he’d asked for assistance. Draco sat as well; body angled towards Harry as he again lifted Harry’s hands and appeared to be assessing the damage. Harry supposed that it was understandable that Draco was primarily concerned about the state of his hands, but that wasn’t really what Harry needed assistance with.
.” Draco’s attempt at tone moderation was a tenuous thing. “My father will be waiting for me, when I leave here.” Lucius didn’t need a Dark Mark to hurt Draco if he didn’t comply.
“Don’t worry about it,” said Draco, folding his trousers and adding them to the pile. “Just… no. I’ll never be Master of anyone. And
. Harry wondered what other adult products George had invented. Maybe Draco would pick out another one from the shop to play with… or a whole range of toys to keep nearby for whenever the urge struck Draco to make use of Harry… but again, not a very calming thought.
“Then why didn’t you use…” Draco gave up. It was too early in the morning for trying to interpret Potter’s actions. “Never mind. Give me that,” Draco huffed, snatching the scroll from Potter.
“No.” Distracted by the conversation and the rain, Draco didn’t register Potter’s nimble swerve of direction until Potter had manoeuvred himself directly in Draco’s path, forcing Draco to an abrupt, squelching halt. “I’ll ask you again, Malfoy. Why did you want me to come out here with you?”
At those words, it occurred to Harry that this was something that he’d never experienced. Men had wanted Harry on top of them, yes, but not like this. Not for
Harry kept sliding his erection tentatively along Draco’s cleft and Harry’s hand recommenced his explorations. He returned to the shaft, holding it more firmly as his fist moved up and down the length, gradually speeding up until Harry’s hips were thrusting at the same rate as his hand, a continuous rocking,
Feeling buoyed by his earlier boldness, Harry wrapped his legs around Malfoy’s hips and hung on tight. Technically, he hadn’t been forbidden to.
Fine. Harry would try again by throwing in an honest reminiscence for emphasis. “All right… how about this? Have I ever told you that George
“I most certainly did. He’s keen to hear a report on the product, to pass a consumer review back to his brother.”
And that was one of Harry’s worst fears. He’d been worried about the same prospect with Draco before the first time they’d had sex.
A second after Harry had replied, he recognised with horror what he’d said. The word had escaped his mouth entirely of its own volition.
As he frantically maintained his mangling grip on the pillow under his head to curb his growing urge to reach out and touch Malfoy’s hair, maybe for a more intimate connection, maybe to encourage a fast pace, Harry bit his lip even harder, and realised that he was in trouble.
? Which Weasley?” Harry asked, learning that he needed to differentiate now that all the Weasleys were part of his and Draco’s life.
And the wood covered by his fist was beginning to pulsate within his grip now, the uncovered handle almost vibrating as the tendril descended.
With abrupt resolve, Harry made the decision for them. Aiming for greatest efficiency within this precarious situation, Harry let his legs drop and planted the soles of his feet into the deep pile before he spoke loud and clear.
“Do you want to run it?” Harry didn’t answer. “Fine, don’t admit it. But if you don’t want the position, quit.”
"Harry, would you focus," Hermione scolded. "You're never going to be able to pass your NEWTs at this rate!"
It took several minutes for them to calm down, Draco laughing into his knee, Harry clutching his aching abdomen.
"Silence, Potter! Draco, I do not approve of this," he hissed. "This is exactly why we made the contract. You have a future wife and a child to bear! You must continue the family line! Even if you are gay, which you aren't—"
Harry shuttered, and kissed him again, sweetly, romantically. Then, Harry got up off of him and grabbed the back of his thighs and lifted Draco a bit. He found a pillow, and put it under the small of his back for leverage.
“Marry me.” Harry kissed him, and Draco felt that feeling that they both felt during intercourse: the opening up to each other. His heart jumped at the thought- let alone the feeling- that Harry was inside of him, touching him in a way no one would ever be able to. Not even his wife. Not the way Harry touched him, no matter where he did.
Harry avoided Draco every second since the incident in the library occurred, and although the two weeks since had passed in pain, Harry let up no remorse. It's not that Draco didn't try to make things up to Harry, oh no, his hand was still cramped from the letters he wrote to him, but Harry threw them away before he could even read them.
"All the safety spells from that book that I thought we'd need. There were more, but I figured these were good to start with."
"Bloody hell, yes you did! You might not have actually leaned in, but you let it happen. You could have pushed her away! Did you use your mouth at all? Unless she had you tied up, and even so, you were hit by a freezing spell and didn't move any bit of mouth, then you're right, you didn't cheat."
Draco wasn't sure, but he was reluctant to report it to his friends that night, for sake of not being made fun of, rather he focused on something else. "Potter hates compliments."
As the world shattered around me, this story became my only constant. And my only safe place to process my feelings
"Hey Mum and Dad," Harry said. "Just wanted to say hi and let you know we have a new Potter in the family. His name is Draco." Draco rested his head on Harry's shoulder, wrapping his arms around him. "He's a Slytherin. Yeah, I know. I'll hold it against him the rest of his life." Draco snorted. "He was actually the first wizard I'd ever met, and he was a total brat. It took us both four years to figure out we liked each other, and dating didn't go well in the beginning. He tricked me into falling in love with him. Our first kiss was in detention as revenge for each other. But then we grew up, and we snapped out of it and we gave it a real shot.
"Which is Harry-Speak for you forgot to get me anything and this is last minute," Draco raised a brow.
"Yes I am telling you," Draco lied in a large voice. He ripped himself from Harry's embrace and backing up to the other side of the hall.
Harry let out a dry laugh. "Right. You know, I thought that would have been the worst pain in my life, knowing you were a death eater, or seeing every father figure die right before my eyes, or even losing the most important people in my life to a bloody snake... nah... that's like a paper cut compared to this."
Most chapter headings will start with this warning, as they all build on each other. Draco's memory is obliviated of him leaving Harry obsessively trying to find out answers. His eating disorder voice convinces him to believe that this happened because he has been eating food (despite restricting). Thus, he begins starving himself. Ron and Hermione try to convince him to eat and bring him food as he begins searching for answers but he either only eats that one thing or he doesn't even eat that. Harry wears clothes that Draco gave him which feature sizing capabilites so that they are always tailored perfectly. He hides behind that because it doesn't look like he is losing weight for quite a while.
"I love you so much," Draco mumbled into his neck. Harry smiled, "I don't think you understand how much this means to me."
Draco's heart raced as he waited for the First Year students to get out of Potions their next class, and when Hughs came out, Draco rushed to stand next to him. "I need to talk to you."
Draco staggered backwards against the glass shower walls and his knees gave. He slid to the floor and brought his knees to his chest, his entire body shaking. Harry sat down next to him, putting his head against his shoulder. He tried holding Draco's shaking hand. "T-They w-were all dead." He cried a bit more. "I-I saw the pictures on their the wall. They had a plaque, The Jones family. Most of the time I don't know their names."
Hermione wiped her eye as McGonagall stood at the front. Draco found Harry's hand and held it, but more because he needed the support more than Harry. He sniffed and Harry squeezed his hand back.
They let him settle back in and he returned to his room, passing George on his way up. He'd stayed there longer than George did?
"Draco Malfoy, did you just spank me," Harry's mouth dropped as he tried to hold back a chuckle, his left butt cheek stinging.
"Oh no!" Harry dropped them both in the water, heads going under. It was quite visible and Draco gave Harry the death stare. Harry just laughed and signaled for them to swim deeper. He kicked off and began to paddle with his feet, leaving Draco the ability to see his untouched, unmarked bottom of his foot, which hadn't stepped on anything. The Slytherin went up for air and Harry did the same, confused on what was wrong.
Draco's immediate instinct was to punch whatever was there and rather than his hand going through straight air, it connected with something solid.
"I'm excited about the honeymoon," Harry said. They were going to New Zealand, staying near a Fiord there while it was their summer. They'd made plans for kayaking, whale watching, stargazing, and diving. Draco packed a broom, so they'd be able to fly through the fiords as well.
Harry inhaled and exhaled angrily before breaking out laughing as well as Draco. Everyone eyed them as if they were bonkers, but then started sniggering too.
Finally, Draco couldn't take it anymore. He let go of Harry, crossed his arms over the desk and buried his face into them, crying out a muffled, "Potter!" as he orgasmed.
"You know what they say, albino cobras have a hard bite," Harry said before practically throwing himself at Draco, wrapping his arms around him and kissing him. Draco practically forced Harry up on the counter top and pushed his tongue down his throat, who openly responded.
Tears slipped Harry's eyes, and the fake Draco tried to wipe them but couldn't. That was true. That was completely true.
"But y-you were dead," Draco hyperventilated, yet again. His doe eyes: Harry loved them. It made him look so innocent.
Draco headed down to the lake at 11:45, his stomach rumbling. Harry was already there with a basket of food next to him, his feet in the water as he sat at the end of the dock.
They were traveling again, this time they made their way up to the Room of Requirement. Harry practically ran the whole way, Draco being dragged along, his eyes flickering as more memories surfaced. His head hurt more and more.
"Just trying to make small talk," Draco said before turning back to Harry, so close their noses were touching. "How long has it been?"
“I should let you go back to class though. Want to eat lunch in my office? Meet me down in the kitchens.”
"That's what makes me angriest. Okay, this whole thing is for 'my safety', but what about your wellbeing? Where does the line stop? Me, then Granger and Weasley, then your godfather. Until you're alone and scared. That's no way for you to live. It's not fair." He wiped a tear from Harry's eyes. "I don't want to leave you. I just... don't want to know who I'd be without you."
"It doesn't matter," Harry grit his teeth. "Go to your prefect's post. There's no need to get yourself in more trouble." Instead, Draco wrapped his arms around his arm, hugging his bicep, and fitting his head into Harry's shoulder. "I swear to God if you get us caught in the middle of detention with Umbridge—"
"Ah ah ah... come here," Draco grabbed Harry's cheek and stared into his eyes, "I need a real good morning kiss."
The platform was crowded with kids, teenagers, and adults alike. Friends were meeting with each other, saying hello and giving hugs. Parents were saying goodbye to their little first years, siblings fighting for first hug.
"Stupid Slytherins..." Harry mimicked his tone. The blonde just rolled his eyes and continued on, pushing past all the rubble and stone, Harry after him. "You okay?"
"Is this some sort of game to you," he growled. It wasn't a question. It was a statement. And his lips quivered as he said it. Tears slipped Harry's eyes involuntarily. They weren't happy tears.
Harry heard the distinct sound of broken glass tinkle from somewhere within the room. At least it hadn’t sounded like a window but to Harry’s imagination, it’d sounded
“Don’t even tempt me,” chortled Harry. “I think you’d meet your match with Luna. Mainly because she wouldn’t care if you were trying to be clever and witty.”
Draco rocked his hips again and Harry automatically responded with a roll of his own. Just one though. Harry was so
“Maybe. Yes. I do. I think it’ll be interesting. And it doesn’t need to be a long-term thing. I could just see how it goes. He deals with a lot of international sellers though, that could be challenging.”
It… tickled, he decided as the tendril increased its speed and wrapped around his wrist. Tickling didn’t mean it was
Harry kept his arm locked in place at the higher point, ignoring the strange perception of silent but persuasive urging which was emanating from the open box. A pinpoint of white light appeared within the marble space, growing bigger, brighter, more appealing… and suddenly Harry was inexplicably standing by the window in the bedroom again, looking at his charred hands. The image was so startlingly vivid, and the accompanying emotions which Harry hadn’t had time to properly process yet were so shocking and
It felt like both a few seconds and an eternity before Harry managed to fully comply. Sitting still, full of Malfoy, Harry was beginning to better appreciate the possibilities.
He bit his lip to keep himself quiet so he could hear Draco’s increasingly loud breaths behind him. Displaying like this was another kind of thrill. Bringing himself off for his own pleasure but also for the excitement of knowing that Draco was watching his every move.
?” Embarrassed by his sentimental concern, Harry stayed silent. “Bloody hell, you do. Don’t worry about me, Potter. I don’t
after Harry topped. All his partners had done the same. He hadn’t experienced anything else. Harry hadn’t ever personally felt the need to critique anyone following sex, but he understood that people felt it was required with him. Harry did think he’d become skilled through necessity, but there were always a few elements he didn’t get exactly right. Always room for improvement. It was just one of those things.

of it, it was still the middle of the night. There was plenty of moonlight to appreciate all the attractive intricacies of the man next to him though.
Quickly returning to the bed, Harry arranged his body with his head on a pillow and his feet pointing towards the footboard.
As he prepared to rise, Draco’s attention was caught by the scroll on the nightstand. Remaining seated, he reached out to lift it towards him. Draco stared down at the rolled parchment, tracing the edges of the wax seal, the design of which proudly announced the Malfoy family.
The physical contact from Draco helped. Although it was against Harry’s better judgment to follow advice delivered by Lucius Malfoy, Harry was aware that his judgment was often skewed. And this could be another opportunity to reclaim the life he used to have.
Still gasping with his unresolved arousal, Harry relished the solid body that settled atop him as Malfoy tucked his head into Harry’s shoulder and breathed heavily into Harry’s neck.
“I just… like to have my wand somewhere near and… safe, when I’m sleeping,” Potter sighed. “And it’s not like I snatched your mail and ran.”

With his sweaty hands struggling to keep their hold on each other, his thigh muscles burning, and trying to ignore the demands of his own need to come, Harry rocked faster. Faster,

Ron had requested to visit the Manor under the guise of the Ministry ensuring that all dark magic items had been removed. Harry hadn’t bought that for a second and neither, he thought, had Draco. As previous Minister for Magic, Harry was well-versed in standard legal Auror practices, and an assessment for the possible existence of dark magic required an attendance of at least two Aurors. The complete lack of official Ministry paperwork in Ron’s possession during this ‘inspection’ also reinforced the true point: Ron was simply being nosy. And Draco was
Tentatively, Harry sent an invisible nudge of magic out to clear a section of floor. Malfoy obligingly knelt in the space, close enough to lay a hand on Harry’s right shoulder.
Draco’s arms rose briefly as if he’d wanted to tug Harry back to him but had thought better of it before he cleared his throat again. “Anyway, I didn’t remember that I wasn’t dressed until it was too late.” At least Draco had the decency to visibly cringe at the memory. “And I think you told Weasley the rest.”
Michael looked furious. And Harry had experienced first-hand how anger could cloud Michael’s judgment. Yes, Harry had witnessed that look before; it had been the outcome after a series of expressions beginning with excitement, growing into lust, to disappointment, to frustration. And finally, to this.
“Umm…” answered Harry, not wanting to inadvertently cause a mass blacklisting if he answered incorrectly.
“Luna!” He shouted in the direction of the door leading to the front shop, confident that she wouldn’t have gone far.
Very impressive for an inept lion. Draco wondered if Potter might be taking notes from the Slytherins.
Draco grinned. “Faithful loyalty in the face of utter betrayal. There’s another item for my list. So many things. Although your attempts at public bathroom rescue missions need work before they can be catalogued, if you’re only going to stand beside me and watch all the copulating men.”
Malfoy reached out, his hand tantalisingly close to Harry’s groin as he plucked the glass from Harry’s hold and set it on the table. Harry hadn't been drinking from it, anyway.
“Nah. Not just now, anyway. I’ll probably need to in the morning though, so I can sit down while what’s her name from Italy yatters on about how our import regulations are too stringent.”
. “What?” Harry asked again, quieter this time. The look on Malfoy’s face and an ominous silence was quickening Harry’s heart rate. “Draco, what’s wro -"
been curious, and enough to rapidly connect the dots in Harry’s story, even if he’d been one person out with his conclusion. But of course, Harry had since confirmed the truth. And now he was standing naked in his bedroom staring down at an envelope in his hands which surely contained the dreaded invitation to family dinner at the Burrow, without a plausible excuse not to attend and feeling nauseated.
Despite his inner turmoil, Harry laughed. Lucius Malfoy’s portrait would make a lovely inferno. But no, Harry wasn’t going to burn it. Unless Draco wanted him to.
“Yes, you did. Should I try again?” Draco shrugged. Harry decided that if Draco objected, he would have said so. Harry hoped. “Lucius,” Harry called to the wall. “I’ll give you one more chance. Do you want it?”
Harry had told Molly and Arthur. It’d been horrible to watch their expressions change as they’d begun to understand, as Harry’s words had irreparably altered their perception of someone they cared about. Harry felt dreadful that he’d done that to them, but Draco’s presence at his side had kept him steady, kept him talking.
The sound which left Harry’s throat was a strange hybrid groaning scream, long and loud enough to surely be audible even from downstairs.
anything great… if Harry could trust that he wouldn’t be pressurised or judged… it might not be as bad an experience as it’d been.
"Harry, I have another test today. I need to study." By test, he meant mission. By study, he meant prepare.
"Whatever lets you sleep at night! Anyway, you said you two were in the Room of Requirement," he cocked his head. "And yet you say you've never mentioned the Room of Requirement. That, and instead of being genuinely confused, you just accepted that there was such a thing as a Room of Requirement, which you wouldn't have if you didn't know about it."
"Potter," Draco bit, regretting the name choice. He couldn't help but use it, he was so used to it by now.
Tears fell down his face. "Why are you making me talk about this? I don't want to think about him living without me."
They began to play the latest hits and all the Weasleys danced. Draco took Harry's hand, spun him, and then held him as they rocked to the beat, gentle and steady.
"You don't know how to cook. You leave you clothes around as if I'm your bloody servant! You're not open minded. Your smirk makes me feel uneasy sometimes. I hate that you're a liar and you deceive me and everyone you know in one way, shape, or form. I hate you! I hate so many things about you.
"Yeah, you know, when you try things out and the person you're with ends up being a huge jerk and you never want to see each other again and you just have a horrible time."
. "Someone who works with hair and makeup." He turned on his heel, but Harry stopped him. "Do you want to go on a picnic?"
He collapsed on the grass staring at the stars, angry at the Universe and hateful of his life. Tears welled in his eyes. When he stood, sore, he stared at the bond. It cracked and split like hair on rope, but there was still a main bond there, thick and thriving. Out of curiosity, Draco reached out and touched it. An addictive feeling of safety and warmth traveled through his body and healed him of his woes.
“Draco!” Harry got up, chasing after him. Draco got halfway down the hall when Harry grabbed him by his waist, spinning him around. “Kiss me!”
"Really? Fine? That's it?" He paused and started right back up again, not wanting a response. Draco knew that, still wearing a look of confusion. "It was your fourth year? If I am correct, you should be fifteen now."
Harry smiled. "I changed you. And if I were to ask you to marry me, I would want you to take my last name."
"It was. Doesn't matter. I'm calling you a virgin tonight no matter what you say, and we're having a safe word."
Harry nodded, and they ate their lunch together. Afterward, Draco crawled next to Harry, and they cuddled again, laying back and listening to the music and the water dripping from the ceiling.
"I don't feel safe," Harry let go, slumping his shoulders as tears stroked his cheeks. "He's back, Draco. And there's already a casualty, and it was all my fault!"
Draco thought he arrived first, and when he walked through the ropes into their secret cove, he began fixing his hair and straightening his clothes. He heard a
"It doesn't matter. Because once he finds out, everything is at his mercy. He could make me go mad. Hell, I could be the one to hurt you."
"Not if it means you die," Draco said. "I'll do this for decades if it means you don't die." He swallowed. "You're the only thing getting me through this. The only reason I've survived this long." Harry rubbed his back. "Why are you comforting me? I should be comforting you. You're the one who almost got murdered."
"Okay," Harry started, and he pushed himself inside the rim of his arse, and Draco clenched right away. Harry grasped his hand so Draco could squeeze it. "Shh, it's okay, shh," he cooed shakily as he pushed further inside of him. "I could never hurt you, shh. You're safe."
He kissed down his neck, bit down hard on his sweet spot, and sucked. Draco made a noise that went straight to Harry's groin, and his body reacted... well, his body did not react smoothly. He jerks his hips against Harrys, and Harry shoved a leg in between his, so the friction of their thighs rubbing together could drive them both crazy.
"Is the same fact that you know what I've been through. You've been there. You've experienced it all, so you know how to comfort me like no one else. You know what I need and you're there for me with genuine authenticity, not like someone who doesn't understand what I've been through and is just doing their best." Harry rubbed Draco's back.
"I won't until you come here with me. The view's amazing. Hurry up, I have a headache. Besides, you have a knack for climbing trees."
Blaise laughed, too. "Finally, Potter. You don't understand how much this boy has masturbated to you—"
Draco did drop him and he landed on the grass again, the thud sending a red hot spark up his spine. Fuck, his body was not in the shape to be able to fall this way. "I didn't mean to... make it weird."
"Pansy got that for me in case we didn't work out," Draco rolled his eyes. "I was for my fifteenth birthday."
He wanted to punch his face in. He wanted to scream at him, he wanted to maim him. Draco just thought of Harry though. If he was here, he would ask him to calm down he would hold his hand. Pumblechook decided he wasn't going to stop there and brought up another dialogue a few silent minutes later.
The group walked up numerous passageways, corridors, and stairs before they reached their final destination: a wall. That's it. A wall. Draco was utterly confused as he loosened his grip slightly on the Chang girl, whom he had dug his nails into the whole walk, probably resulting in bruising.
Harry smiled. "Not really." He blinked. "Wow. Not at all actually." And then Harry added, "Happy Anniversary."
That made a wave of pleasure go straight to Draco's cock, the thought of Harry screaming his name. "I want to hear you do it."
"What's strange," The Dark Lord spoke, silencing everyone, "is that you use Occlumency quite often. What is it that you want to hide from me?"
"It's okay," Draco choked, his throat closing and eyes watering. He never believed anyone could ever love him with those scars. He never believed anyone could care for him after what he almost did, how he almost murdered someone, and how he was almost killed in the act of it. But his premature-murderer was the one loving him for it, and that thought made him want to cry.
Kingsley gave him a blank glare. He had to be attending raids right now, and Draco and Harry were delaying him. "Answer the question."
"Oh hey," Harry replied much more rushed and scattered as he hopped out of the water, splashing some of the liquid on the pavement and Draco shoes. His hair was actually brushed to Draco's surprise, and was gelled up as recommended.
"You thought that I wasn't going to be punished for not killing Dumbledore. I can't believe that I'm alive."
Ah. Potter was looking for sympathy. He needed a stroke of the ego. "You'll do great. You're Harry Potter."
But Draco’s expression was turning to anger. At himself, Harry suspected. This was confirmed as Draco rumbled, “You shouldn’t have
Harry nodded. Then tried to form words to eloquently explain his bizarre desire to do this. The best he could come up with was, “Uhuh.”
As he’d stood at the kitchen counter and diced and chopped, the topic of Harry’s working day had been raised by Draco. The conversation had quickly developed into more wand innuendos, then a discussion of best polishing practices, so Draco had helpfully demonstrated an efficient buffing technique to Harry which took the form of a fantastic but incomplete hand job. Incomplete, because a debate about wood stiffness and proper balancing had arisen and that had somehow led to… this.
Then Potter did the simplest thing; he laid a palm on Draco’s stomach as they kissed. His hand rested an inch above the waistband against Draco’s covered navel, just five unmoving fingers, exchanging body heat through the fabric of Draco’s shirt. It was exhilarating.
Clenching the glass on his lap with both hands, Harry steeled himself and spoke. “The same problem I’ve had with all my relationships. Since…
A shove to the centre of Harry’s back brought his chest flush with the wood and Harry’s feet were kicked apart.
Remembering that expression, Harry shuddered. If Draco wore a similar look by the end of this, Harry didn’t think he’d be able to cope. But he needed to keep going.
Exasperated, Harry rolled his eyes and swallowed his next retort. Instead, he snuggled into Draco and aimed to steer the subject back to where it’d drifted from.
“Right… before this gets all sappy… did you get up to anything fun last night?” asked Ron in an obviously urgent attempt to avoid watching more kissing. As if Harry and Draco hadn’t had to witness Ron’s tongue down Hermione’s throat when they’d walked through the door of the cafe.
Potter shook his head and continued to examine the drapes. “It feels like they’d be satisfied with me doped up, as long as I at least
“That’s the second time you’ve asked me that today. I’m beginning to think that I maybe don’t talk enough. About… the important stuff.”
“I’ve been hearing some delicious sounds from you, Potter. I think you like my gift. Are you prepared to be a good whore for me now? You may answer,” he added in response to Harry’s cautious silence.
Draco walked over to the wall beyond the desk where only one frame still hung. Harry had been trying not to acknowledge it. Heart rate rising, Harry followed.
much. Reining back his orgasms while he couldn’t see Malfoy was usually hard enough. Being able to watch was going to make the task much more difficult. Draco’s ability to be a sadistic git was one of the many reasons why Harry loved him.
Nervous, Harry searched Malfoy’s expression for any hint of mocking, but found none. With shaking hands, he unbuckled his belt and undid the fastenings of his trousers, sighing with relief as the pressure eased. Malfoy’s gaze was fixed on Harry’s groin as Harry adjusted his clothing to expose his cock and balls at Malfoy’s eye level.
Draco’s head swung in his direction and his eyes widened. It was possible that Harry wasn’t presenting his best self.
Malfoy suddenly dropped to kneel in front of him, placing the scroll carefully on the floor beside Harry’s knees. Cautiously, Harry raised his head to meet Malfoy’s astounded gaze. Harry’s vision became blurry as Malfoy leaned forwards, brushed hair from Harry’s sweaty face and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead.
,” he snarled, his temper close to cracking. “I was intending to slick my cock with it and ride the crease of your arse.
“Society likes a label though. Something that people can be referred to. I usually hate to pander to the masses, but… I don’t know. Maybe it’s not important what we refer to each other as.”
Harry hadn’t earned a scone, but he had determined that maple wood and a fine sliver of Devil’s Snare caused Madame Deetry’s magical frequency to both settle and amplify.
“I’m sorry about that,” Draco sighed. “I screwed up. And the… ottoman thing was really inconsiderate. Sorry.”
When Potter spoke again, faltering over words, Draco didn’t interrupt. “I thought… I didn’t think that you had it. I mean, I did once, but I thought I was wrong. I didn’t think that they’d let you come back, if you did. If you were a…” Harry’s voice faded into silence but despite his fear, Draco wasn’t prepared to let an accusation such as that remain only half-voiced.
Thickening just for Malfoy. After all, this part of Harry’s existence was only for Malfoy. No, he corrected himself; this was as much for Harry as it was for Draco. Harry gladly gave all of himself during these moments, Malfoy welcomed what Harry offered and made use of him, and Harry was provided with what he needed. When Harry occupied the space which Malfoy was adept at creating for him, life was simpler. Submitting was
And Draco wouldn’t let Potter go to waste either. If Potter needed help, support, therapeutic insults… that’s what Draco would give him. No matter what else did or didn’t happen between them.
Potter stood awkwardly a safe distance from any of the beds. Draco was enjoying himself already. This was Potter’s territory, Potter’s
Lucius’ insults reached a new fever pitch of volume as Harry's hand stroked the wood, so, naturally, that was the moment when Draco walked into the room.
so. Harry paused. Put like that, the difference didn’t seem as clear. “I…” Unsure what his words were going to be, Harry failed again to get the sentence out.
Harry squirmed within the grip, enjoying the restraint. “To see what we can eat for dinner? You said you were hungry.”
“For fucks sake,” Draco soon said, interrupting the staring competition before it could get properly underway. “What do you
Harry’s mind reeled. A part of him was aware that Malfoy was still talking to him, that the tone might’ve changed, that Malfoy’s hands were still touching him, maybe trying to encourage him to turn around… but he couldn’t concentrate on it anymore through the rushing noise in his ears. So, here it was. Finally bored with accommodating what Harry enjoyed, Malfoy was going to turn into all the rest of them. Into
Draco could clearly see that it wasn’t fine, but he didn’t press for information. “Good,” Draco said. “Library or sunroom?
“I’m not going anywhere since you keep giving me more reasons to stick around. And now… I’m going to approach this subject extremely carefully… lest you think it’s in any way coercive or expected.” A knot of worry started to twist in Harry’s chest. “But I’d be amenable to doing that again, on occasion.”
“Beg me for it,” Malfoy growled as his fist sped up at Harry’s side. “Show me how much you want it.”
With a start, Harry only realised that he had been staring at the blurriness of the moonlit ceiling in blank shock when Draco curled in beside him and laid his head on Harry’s chest. That was too much for Harry; rolling carefully over to his right, he gently readjusted them both until Draco was lying on his back with Harry’s head on
Well, Draco could attest to that this year. He tried to hold onto his anger, attempted to feel insulted. Affronted. Betrayed. Belittled. Anything other than the sense of gratitude which was growing in his chest.
“You might’ve mentioned something about my arse.” Looking over his shoulder, Draco caught sight of a sheepish blush colouring Potter’s cheeks. It was frustratingly endearing.
was, Draco thought as Weasley abruptly shunted him aside to pass, and Potter dutifully followed the ginger into the Hall.
“Attach and treat the handle now, Harry. Then be sure to give it all a good thorough polishing and you’ll be done.” She giggled. “And you’ll have a
. Harry had been surprised when he’d first seen it, and wrong in his earlier assumptions tonight; it was not made of silicone. No, it was a thick length of ridged glass, delicately imbued with pale blue and pink curving swirls throughout its interior. The form and decoration were stunning to look at, and Harry was trusting Draco’s reassurances about the safety of being penetrated by
Feeling frighteningly tempted, Harry wrenched his hand away from the box and hugged it to his chest. With a nudge of his magic, the lid slammed shut.
Harry decided to try to get ahead of the upcoming criticism. “I’m sorry the active penetration didn’t last longer,” he offered, feeling guilty about that part.
“You’re in my bed, Potter,” Draco whispered, sighing inwardly at the proof that even cunning Slytherins could occasionally state the obvious.
He swiftly decided that it didn’t matter. As their relationship progressed, the lines often became more frequently blurred. In the end, it was all Draco, and it was all Harry.
“We’re not putting him in with a boggart, Draco.” Harry would burn the portrait first; that’d be kinder.

Harry watched as Malfoy released his grip on the chair, shoved it aside and straightened to his full height, shoulders shifting back and chin lifting as he no doubt prepared to take a stand against Harry’s fury. Harry was also aware of what

Harry had sent an Owl to Ron asking him to meet him and Draco at the Burrow, somewhat surprised when Ron had quickly replied with ready agreement. Through his rattling nerves, Harry wasn’t certain what he was going to say to Ron, but he hoped that the setting would tamper the possibility of too much shouting. Or other… unfortunate reactions from Draco, who’d insisted upon being present. Harry hadn’t objected because he did want Draco with him.

Having no clue as to the answer, Harry deflected, “I’m not the only newly-appointed man of leisure around here. What do
“Charms first,” Potter announced as if Draco wasn’t well aware of his schedule. “You’re good at that. Maybe you could give me a hand?”
Harry stroked his fingers along the grain. He could definitely feel moisture. As if it had just been submerged in water.
“See you tomorrow for Sunday dinner, you randy rascals.” Ron winked as he waved and exited with a flourish of red robes.
At least Harry wasn’t kept waiting long for the next smack. His teeth rattled with the impact as he exerted much effort to keep the rest of his body motionless.
Blinking his bleary blink, Harry examined Malfoy’s relaxed pose and finally asked, “Shouldn’t you be… I don’t know, making some sort of… assertive move?”

Harry decided to ignore the claim of love; it was meaningless when applied to him. “That’s not what I’ve been doing.”
Draco extended a hand and Harry grasped it, feeling secure as he linked their fingers together and led Draco out of the bedroom.
“Oh,” she said, as if that hadn’t been the whole point of this exchange. Harry smiled back, pleased to be on this familiarly unpredictable ground. He’d missed Luna. Now that he had time to have a personal life again, he should try to see more of her. “I’d like to know if I should sell Michael Corner a new wand,” said Luna, puzzling Harry on several levels.
Draco wasn’t sure whether or not the question had been a badly executed attempt at humour, so he replied with almost seriousness. “No, but apparently you’re going to.”
Thrown out on impulse, Harry immediately regretted his reply. He needed to learn to think before he opened his mouth.
“Implications are inaccurate things to gauge on. Don’t be such a ruddy girl,” Draco tutted. “In fact, it occurs to me that I’ve yet to see proof of your masculinity. You’ve seen mine twice now. As equality goes, this situation is sadly lacking and I feel that the imbalance needs to be rectified.”
A couple of hours later, Draco and Harry were standing surrounded by piles of tomes and Draco did indeed look happy as he chattered about the books they were organising. Harry was content to follow Draco’s packing instructions, noting that far more books were allocated to be kept than sold. Just as Harry had expected. The contents of this room obviously meant a lot to Draco.
Harry had shaken his head in exasperated mirth but hadn’t protested. He was pleased to see that his ward keeping Lucius within the frame was holding strong. Although Lucius didn’t look as pleased about that as he noiselessly ranted. Harry suspected that the portrait’s existence had a timescale dependent upon Draco’s tolerance, and he wondered if he should explain that to Lucius, giving him the chance to improve his behaviour. But he decided against intervening. It was up to Draco if he kept the last remaining painting of his father. Harry would stand by him either way.
The white smoke was only about an inch from his skin, so Harry felt compelled to ask, “Should I put it down?”
Thankfully, Malfoy seemed to accept that. “I suppose people can be fickle enough to wander off to live their own lives. And
But Draco was feeling a little too shaky to prise himself up from the bed and proceed with that cunning plan.
“This is pointless,” Draco said. “We can’t make it through most conversations without resorting to arguing or insults, anyway. Is that what you want?”
“Actually, no. I’m sure it’s another magical reader, and it doesn’t feel… hostile, but it also doesn’t feel like the

wear clothes.” Neglected request or not, Harry decided it was essential. “I had the presence of mind to insist that he bring dinner as penance for disturbing us in our home while you were busy being buggered by a piece of glass.”
. Reminding himself of all the reasons why that was, Harry tried to hang onto the brief flash of desire. Tried to reclaim the fading intensity of that
“I… burned a letter,” Harry explained, wiggling his painful and stiffening fingers in a typically unsuccessful attempt at visually describing his accidental magic.
Malfoy sighed. “Hands back behind your back. Raise your head and look at me.” Harry did, trying to take comfort from the resolve in Malfoy’s stare. “You are
Fuck, Draco was really getting into this. Harry knew that he could stop this absurd venture into insanity before it went any further, but it had been
Harry slowed, but kept moving throughout Malfoy’s shudders, milking as much as he could, hoping to gain some favour.
“I know.” Harry leaned to his right and kissed Draco’s cheek. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”
Harry jerked in Malfoy's grip, gulped in a startled lungful of air, and came in violent spurts over his stomach. To Harry, the intensity seemed to go on for a while.
As Draco pondered that, a thought occurred to him. And the foolish honesty which he appeared to be embracing lately urged him to ask, “But isn’t that what I did today? Interfering?”
It was immensely reassuring; soft, tender, and careful. Their kisses tended to be like this, a stark contrast to their other sexual interactions. Malfoy’s lips moved with Harry's, encouraging his mouth open to allow a light caress of tongues, and Harry’s arms found their way around Malfoy’s torso, holding him tight as he was held in return.
Harry briefly dropped his chin into his hand with tired resignation even as he chuckled. It wasn’t going to be a big deal; it was
There may have been a glimmer of hurt in Potter’s expression. Excellent, Draco could use that to his advantage.
… us. And you know having Ron around again is still… newish. So, yeah… I’m nervous. Not brooding though, I promise.”
Torn between arousal and concern, Harry suggested, “Maybe we should wait until we’re back home for this?” The last word came out as a hiss as the delicate skin of Harry’s neck was sucked between Draco’s teeth.
“So, shall we be relating this tale of non-rug humping to Ron tomorrow?” Harry asked, both to reinforce that sex was not about to commence and attempt to encourage the return of Draco’s laughter.
Harry sank to his knees in front of Draco, rested his palms on his thighs, and bowed his head submissively.
But Draco’s life was screwed anyway. He decided to rescue Potter from his descent back into awkwardness. And hopefully please his own disappointed cock in the process.
“Acceptable behaviour requires a reward,” Malfoy declared. That was fine with Harry. “So, I might let you play with my cock. Are you grateful?”
Harry hadn’t confirmed it either, but he knew that wasn’t a whole lot better. Guilt. So much guilt. It was
Potter stopped and swallowed noisily, visually composing himself. “I tried… to prevent your father’s light sentencing. The Wizengamot refused.” Potter’s eyes flashed as they rose to meet Draco’s astounded stare. “
That didn’t help Harry’s level of rising nausea. Swallowing down bile, Harry dropped his gaze to the carpet, but a tiny nudge to his shoulder from Draco brought his attention back up to focus on Ron. Harry gently squeezed the thigh still under his palm and the contact with Draco helped to ground him; it always did.
“No…” she said slowly, as if Harry was being dim. “He can be blacklisted. It’s a wandmaker safety system,” she added, possibly due to Harry’s incredulous expression. “It’d stop him from purchasing a new wand. We don’t advertise it. People would be upset. But I don’t like to blacklist someone unless it
Draco privately agreed that it was a bizarre situation. “Us being together is a bit strange, I suppose.”
that, he felt a more pressing need to sit down. With Malfoy occupying the only chair in the study, Harry sank to the floor. What Malfoy had said last week had been right, after all… Harry
Harry was mulling over this fact when something hit the side of his head. Glancing down at his desk revealed the offending item to be a bound file of papers. Glancing back up revealed the likely culprit to be the smirking man he could see sitting at the desk in the adjacent office. Stupid interconnecting door; Harry should close it. But he made no move to do so.
“It would seem so,” Draco muttered, reaching for the bacon as a lifeline. Perhaps the Slytherin table would be a safer option than this, even with the death threats.
give him enough. Maybe one day Harry would understand why that was. It seemed entirely implausible that Harry could have Draco. But Draco was holding him without a trace of patronisation. And Draco had altered his plan at a moment’s notice because he recognised something that Harry needed.
?” Harry spat, utterly affronted. “If that’s even an accurate description of what was happening there.”
Keen to do his part, Harry lifted a hand fractionally from the mattress to clean Draco, himself, and the vibrator. And the table it rested on, for good measure. “Clean now,” he announced with a tired yawn.
Malfoy sighed, bringing his head nearer until Harry could feel Malfoy's breath ruffling his hair. “Do we need to do this
Grinning, Ron leaned against the doorframe. “That thing doesn’t look all that sturdy with those spindly legs. So be careful. Safety first.”
His cock throbbed harder in appreciation of Draco’s harsh tone. Harry tried to discreetly rub the tip against the sheet.
Draco forced his breathing to slow. He wasn’t prepared to acknowledge that possibility. Draco did not compromise his position, for anyone.
The following morning, Harry sat in the second drawing room, pondering on what he’d seen. Not Michael, that was… interesting. Over a year ago, when Harry had accidentally walked in on a boggart within an old part of the Ministry, it’d become Michael. And Harry had been presented with a first-person view of himself fucking Michael into the mattress upon the king-size oak bed in Michael’s flat, screaming inside his head that he didn’t
Harry felt as though his muddled emotions had taken an unexpectedly sharp bend down an alternate route, but he didn’t question it as he sought out the warm wet of Malfoy’s mouth. Deepening the kiss further than before, feeling Malfoy respond in kind, Harry wasn’t in a hurry to go anywhere. Malfoy wrapped arms around him again, less in comfort this time and more in gradually increasing urgency as fingers grasped the back of Harry’s t-shirt and pulled him closer. Harry’s arms found their own way around Malfoy: his left hand slipping beneath the soft wool of Malfoy’s jumper, exploring skin as it smoothed up Malfoy’s back; his right seeking out the narrow gap between waistband and skin, sliding down to claim the curve of Malfoy’s arse as he became breathlessly aware of the meeting of two thickening cocks.
Malfoy looked like he was desperately praying that it wasn't his. Harry knew that Malfoy was very aware of what Harry was capable of when he was angry. And Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd been
“It’s going to be fantastic fun. Granger will no doubt delight us with brain-numbing legal jargon and Weasley with his daring Auror deeds. And I shall be the pinnacle of charming company.”
. If you move again without permission, I’m going to hang you by those cuffs from the ceiling and leave you there all night.”
Barely able to speak with increasing anticipation, Harry resolutely pushed words out with his breath, but his volume was faint. “Yes, I’m very grateful. Thank you.”
me. Everything we do needs to be consensual. It’s the whole basis of our dominant and submissive roles. You can
Harry removed his hands from the wall, straightened his back and slowly turned, not sure what reaction he’d be faced with. He hadn’t used his word before and didn’t know what to do now that he had, but as he met Malfoy’s concerned frown, they weren’t left in silence for long.
“Are you enjoying unemployment, Mr Potter? It would suit your brand of failure quite aptly, I should think.”
him be. He was starting to feel sick again. Couldn’t get air…  Malfoy was saying something else now, quieter… Harry couldn’t hear him properly… something was resting on the back of Harry’s neck, stroking… he wanted to retreat from the touch, but couldn’t make himself move…  Harry knew that he wasn’t supposed to object to instructions within these roles. He was meant to comply without question… and he hadn’t ever
A private interaction with Potter was exactly what Draco wanted. So, that didn’t explain why his stomach plummeted.
Pulling his hips back, returning forwards, repeating… Harry employed all that he’d learned, building it into a steady rhythm, appreciating the sight of strong, lithe muscles and rippling skin as Draco began to writhe beneath him.
There was a small twitch at the edge of Potter’s mouth. Draco didn’t think it was going to form a smile.
, I would’ve. And I still don’t have much patience for people who remind me of my parents’ illusions of grandiosity, so a few tips might come in handy. Because you’re
it… and at the core of that desire was a longing to feel what it would be like to bury his cock in Draco’s arse.
? Harry hadn’t thought that was a given. The hand on Harry’s buttock stroked lightly, caressing the curve like the most careful lover. Harry suspected that tender care wasn’t going to last for long. “Do you understand what I’ve told you?”
Harry cut off that line of thought. None of those ideas were the least bit quelling to his rising excitement.
“You conveyed that point to them very effectively. That file clerk seemed grateful that he didn’t disintegrate along with it. But they can’t do anything to
his latest role of responsibility. Just because one bad word from Potter could result in Draco’s expulsion didn’t mean that they needed to be friends. Unfortunately, Potter seemed to be finding it difficult to grasp this essential fact.
He didn’t know how long Malfoy had let him float in bliss before he stepped back, gradually removing his cock from Harry’s mouth. Harry missed its weight on his tongue.
Malfoy didn’t ask him to. “I can probably guess. He’s wasn’t exactly approving of certain… aspects of me. Used to call me a disgraceful fag. Or a ponce.”
Harry had absolutely no intention of doing that. But Harry’s letter should effectively destroy Michael’s beloved career before then. If Harry expressed his enthusiasm strongly enough, he might even manage to get Michael the sack entirely. And if he tried
The room became extremely quiet as they both regarded the covered frame. But Harry had a question. He turned to face Draco.
“O – one,” Harry stammered, hastily tagging a “Thank you,” to the end before he earned himself an additional smack.
Since Potter had been the sole supporter of Draco’s return to the school, he had subsequently become Draco’s sponsor. Draco wanted to scream.
There was definitely a glint in the green as Potter’s head swivelled in Draco’s direction. Draco held his silence for a few seconds, waiting. Potter’s gaze found Draco’s face, slid down briefly to Draco’s mouth and back up to meet his eyes.
After Malfoy’s breathing had steadied, Harry moaned when the softening cock was slowly pulled from his anus.
Harry understood that. “Restrictions do sometimes help me feel… safer,” he admitted. “I needed the rules for that, I think. Even though I broke them.” Reflecting on his words, Harry frowned. “My mind is a weird place, I think.”
“If you wish to prevent someone from purchasing a new wand, consult that insanely ludicrous female who owns Ollivanders.”
him to be, then things would’ve turned out differently. It didn’t matter that Harry wouldn’t have been happy; that was entirely inconsequential.
“Thanks, mate.” Ron beamed and Harry’s anger grew. “You know, Hermione’s been trying to get us together for a while. She says you’ve been busy.”
to irreparably rip that dream away from him. It was more vindictive than Harry usually liked to be, but he was willing to make an exception. If Michael was so
had caused Harry to forget it again. The belief in his own lack of worth or importance was so deeply ingrained that sometimes he tended to regress. He doubted that it would ever completely go away.
When had Draco spoken to Luna today? But for all Harry knew, they could’ve been having loads of interesting confabs when Harry had been working.
“I’m sure we’ll have many other erotic tales that you can disturb him with later. Or we can just pick one from our archives,” suggested Harry.
“Uhuh. So much t’do,” Harry murmured as his eyes closed, but a small complaint suddenly occurred to him and nudged him back to alertness. “That was
Harry linked his fingers with the proffered hand and stepped into Malfoy’s space, tucking his other arm firmly around Malfoy’s waist.
Trying not to kiss the smile off Potter’s mouth, or perhaps to broaden it, Draco distracted himself with highlighting an obvious fact. “They’ll never really be my friends, you know. They
Bent over the table as he was, it took some tricky arching of his back, but Harry sank his index and middle finger through the mess which Malfoy had deposited into his anus. The rim of his hole felt loosened and extremely tender. Mmm… the best kind of sore. Battered. Used.
Draco brought his attention up to the portrait. “Ah. See what you mean.” Draco gave his father a sarcastic little wave. Lucius glowered. “Sod him,” was Draco’s verdict as he refocused on the book in his hand.
“Why not? We could leave the outer door open. Public indecency, Potter. What a way to end an illustrious Ministerial career. I’m sure the Wizengamot couldn’t justify condoning that kind of behaviour from their esteemed Minister.”
“I’m sorry that it doesn’t meet your expectations,” Draco muttered, tugging to reclaim his arm. Potter held on tight.
Malfoy’s eyes ominously narrowed before he visibly took a deep breath of restraint. He looked like he wanted to hit Harry. And Harry
This time, it had been Draco who met Harry as he walked through the door. Unprepared for that, Harry had been momentarily confused, thinking that perhaps Draco had come in here after all. It had taken Harry only seconds to understand what was happening, but that hadn’t made it any easier to deal with.
hurt; but the extent of pain was well within Harry’s personal preferences. And he knew that Malfoy would stop in an instant if Harry spoke his safe word. But Harry had no desire to do that. Instead, he revelled in being put in his place. Physically and verbally admonished for his actions.
Or rather, he stared at grey ashes staining his hands, sure that he’d been holding crisp white parchment only moments ago. Harry remembered reading the letter, reading it again… and once more through oddly blurry vision before he had gasped in a panicked lungful of air, and everything had gone a bit… bright.
“What?” asked Harry. “What? Get to it!” He prompted, impatient with Malfoy’s abrupt muteness and lack of assertive action.
Draco strolled down the stone stairs which led from the entrance. He continued for a couple of paces on the flat path before pausing to allow Potter to catch up.
Harry debated the issue. He was being undressed by Draco, and less clothing when he was with Draco was a fun thing. So, yes. It was okay.
Encouraged, Harry rocked forwards and up, back and down, forwards, back, swivelled and hissed in exhilaration as he hit his prostate. Oh,
The room was filled with Malfoy’s grunts and growls, and a rising, whining noise that Harry thought was coming from him.
An increasingly urgent confliction of fight or flight was making it difficult to keep hold of his magic. He
At any other time, Draco would have objected to the effeminate description, but he presently didn’t care. As long as Potter’s lips made contact with Draco’s cock soon, Potter could describe it however he wanted.
But Harry tried to put that out of his mind for the moment. Talking with Molly and Arthur around their worn table, Harry felt like he’d never been away. The only difference was the man now sitting by his side. Who appeared to be as taken by their friendliness as Harry was.
of his tiny hole being forced open to receive something larger than it was intended for was one of Harry’s favourite things. The familiar sensation reassured him a little about this unusual position.
Ron appeared hesitant but began to speak, fingers clenching on the padded armrests of the chair. “It’s been… weird, since you broke up with Michael. Not all the time, but… sometimes. Mostly the times when I tried to talk to you.”
Perceptively, Malfoy commented, “I seem to remember that you don’t like this building any more than I do.”
Potter’s jaw set as the expressions around them indicated that Draco’s implication had been correctly interpreted by the other occupants of the room. Much better. Draco could work with anger.
Harry didn’t care either way about Michael’s finances; he’d already made his point today. But something about this information didn’t ring true.
Harry felt stupid standing there with his hand poised a foot above a marble box, Draco and Ron watching him intently and apparently anticipating some sort of wizened declaration. He thought that twelve inches was possibly too far away, but Harry was reluctant to get closer.
“Yes, but I failed to think it through properly.” That was becoming a worrisome habit. Potter looked confused, so Draco expounded. “You’re… you, and I’m Marked. The fact that they’re allowing me to attend the school doesn’t mean anyone trusts me. Even if I did do you a favour in Potions one day. Everyone will soon forget that.” Draco knew that one noble act wouldn’t change the outcome for him in the long run. “And Death Eater or not, I'll always be a despicable Malfoy. And you’ll always be their Saviour. The two will never be complementary or acceptable within society.”
that kept returning the man to Harry’s side. Malfoy had an exquisitely handsome, confident gait to him, and Harry was… well, Harry. Not much to admire once someone saw beyond his notoriety. But he reminded himself, he was best not to question it in case he inadvertently brought Draco to his senses.
Draco shifted across until he was kneeling by Harry’s left hip and reached over to lift his wand from the small table on that side of the bed. After a softly muttered spell, the cuffs obligingly clicked open, releasing Harry’s wrists. Draco retrieved them and set them down on the table.
But the one remaining constant was Potter’s attention to Draco. Potter remained persistently keen to involve Draco in unwanted social common room interactions, but this was becoming a steadily more difficult task due to Potter’s strange reluctance to converse with his housemates.
Draco tightened his grip around Harry, probably predicting his imminent departure. Harry allowed it, but only just. “And you didn’t correct me.”
Finnigan’s gaze met Potter’s, swept to Draco and back to Potter. Awareness of the perilous situation which he was so close to becoming embroiled in was written all over Finnigan’s face.
them!” Harry protested, even as he internally acknowledged that he had. “I did keep in touch with them.” Most of them, he silently corrected himself.
Michael do anything. No matter how disappointing Harry had been, Michael didn’t have the right to force him.
Today, the lengthy walk to Gryffindor Tower didn’t seem nearly so tedious as Draco pondered the many ways which he could assist Potter with his self-destructive tendencies. Unfortunately, he also ruined most of them with methods of subsequent rescue.
“I most certainly have been interested. You decorate the office very well. I’m merely subtle about my appreciations,” preened Malfoy. “Your ego doesn’t need any help from me. Or, I hadn’t thought so.”
Still not able to accept a description of ‘talent’ when applied to himself, Harry shrugged. “So you and Luna seem to think. But that’s not the point. We’re talking about
approached Ron a few times after the… incident with Michael. Ron’s reactions had deterred him from trying again.
Malfoy chuckled. It didn’t help Harry’s esteem. “You’re kidding, right? That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. You’re
Potter snorted, beginning to twiddle his wand between the fingers of both hands. “Feels like it. They want me to take
to do, after all, under the pressure of expectations due to his supposed status and the resulting obligation he’d felt within his previous relationships. Pleasing people without regard to what
When Ron had left the room, Harry regarded Draco, wondering about the shift in atmosphere surrounding him.
Part of him thought that was exactly what he should’ve done. But that possibly wasn’t very logical, in the long run. “I don’t know,” Harry shrugged.
Not Weasley, then. Thankfully. That mental image would be enough to ruin anyone’s libido. But apparently, there was a possibility that Potter had already accepted his attraction to males. Draco would let the subject of past dalliances drop, for now.
In truth, Draco was exhausted. Both mentally and physically from all the recent events. But of course, he presented a lie.
He swallowed around a lump in his throat and somehow managed to speak. “Did you… ask Hermione for help?”
to, he would be a good whore for Draco… oh, for… what the bloody fuck was that blasted damned piece of glorious glass doing
He gasped as he felt Draco’s right hand follow suit and burrow into Harry’s briefs. However, Draco didn’t stop at an arse cheek. Instead, Harry felt a finger sneak into his crack, looking for his hole.
“I don’t. It’s a bit of a mood killer. Not that the mood hasn’t be decimated already. In fact, I think we’re doing entirely too much talking. And you’re not too skilled in deflection.” Draco reminded himself that criticism wasn’t likely to lead to a sexual encounter. “The important topic at the moment is why you left me on the bed by myself.”
Calmer or not, Harry had a schedule to force himself back to. “How long have I been sitting here? Someone’s going to come looking for me soon.”
Instead of finishing his sentence, Draco lifted his head, lowered his gaze, and stared blatantly at Harry’s erection, appearing to consider something. Although Harry’s worry increased in the interim, his cock rose further under Draco’s visual scrutiny.
“What?” As Malfoy turned, Harry took an instinctive step backwards at the sight of him; Malfoy looked
Draco opened his eyes. Potter hadn’t moved anymore than Draco had. They both lay close together, and Draco thought the places where their bodies casually touched was providing a surprisingly grounding type of comfort.
“Yeah. Weasley’s Wizard… Whatsits. Can you believe that the owner tried to foist a pink Pygmy Puff with green spots onto me? I mean, have you ever heard of such a pointlessly preposterous thing?”
“It is only prudent to glean advantages from any situation. People are not nearly as careful in conversation around paintings as they should be, therefore their carelessness does often provide invaluable information.”
Desperately gathering both breath and composure, Draco’s only consolation was that Potter looked as flushed and rumpled as Draco imagined himself to appear. But Potter was a blushing
And this exposure couldn’t have come at a worse point. Draco hadn’t mentioned the specifics since Harry had revealed what happened, but he’d been disturbingly cautious around Harry afterwards. Harry had
limits. But then again, he probably needed all the help he could get if he didn’t want to be stuck in this role for the next four years. At least he’d finally accepted that he
too soon to be contemplating such a thing. And there was nothing marriable about Harry. Draco probably wouldn’t even want to.
Harry waved off Draco’s worry. “I’m fine,” he assured again, pushing himself backwards to rest his spine on the headboard. Although his arse was protesting, it was still enjoyable in its own way. He squirmed through his next words. “Winklepick asked you to
Harry lowered his head further. He wanted to bury it into the floor. “That I’ve let people down. That I’m selfish. That I’ve abandoned the country. Strolled away from the Ministry and my responsibilities without any notice and
Harry hastened to alter his position as instructed, the added weight of his hands forcing his head to remain down. He heard the clinking of Malfoy’s belt being unbuckled, the rasp of a zipper lowering.
His father wasn’t here though. With considerable effort, Draco froze the motion of his feet directly in front of the door. He could do this. His father viewed him as pathetic, but Draco didn’t need to conform to that belief. His hand grasped the doorknob, knowing that he wouldn’t be burned, but still surprised when he wasn’t. Before he could further analyse this, he turned his hand and pushed.
progress. He gave Hermione a tiny nod and was rewarded by a one-armed hug around his shoulders from Draco.
“Burn it,” Draco interrupted. “Like you did with the box. It’s the most… fool proof way of ensuring that the magic is destroyed.”
Harry focussed on the wand in his hand and the magic swirling in ever-tighter spirals around the wood and his wrist. Okay… what
Potter sat mutely during meals, responding to direct questions or comments from the other diners, but determinedly ignoring all aspects which concerned Draco.
Even Snape appeared inattentive to this frothing danger, although Draco had long suspected that Snape didn’t care anymore what occurred in his classroom. Snape liked to bellow and billow to maintain the facade of a diligent and imposing Potions Master, but since the end of the war, Draco had noted a distinct underlying apathy in the man’s demeanour. The removal of House points and frequent application of detentions was as predictably rampant as before in this class, but student safety or education didn’t appear to be high on Snape’s agenda. Draco thought that it may be an after effect of Snape’s near-death experience. Having a giant snake chomp on your neck probably brought many things into perspective.
As he started to seriously debate whether he should deal with the hob issue and the possibility of rampant fire or at least the tragedy of burnt sausages, Harry pushed the thought away; it was inconsequential.
Draco shook his head. “No, that’s not the problem. The world would be better off without a portrait of my father. I just don’t want… to be the one who gets rid of it.”
Malfoy leaned forward to whisper in Harry’s ear, “You’ve been such a good whore today.” The ache in Harry’s cock ramped up a notch. “A tight, filthy hole for me to use.” The hand restraining Harry tightened its grip. “I’m going to shove my fist in there one day, Potter.”
you to say,” Potter shrugged. “So basically, we’re both screwed.” Draco thought their conversation was about to come to an ugly conclusion, but Potter continued, “It’d
Harry lifted the long, wavy section of wood from the table. Weighing it in his right hand revealed it to be much lighter than its appearance indicated. It also felt soft and hard at the same time. Like the whole length could be easily bent into a curve, but also as if it… couldn’t. That made no sense to Harry.
Winklepick’s offer of employment wasn’t likely to make Draco happy. “I didn’t mean the Ministry thing.”
Sweat beading on his forehead, he opened his eyes. The scroll and his hand appeared unchanged. Not knowing what to expect, if anything, Harry unrolled the contract to examine it. The alteration was immediately obvious. A new addendum had been added to the top of the parchment in bold, curving, deep red script.
It was too much to absorb. Draco couldn’t wrap his mind around the concept. Perhaps an overabundance of Potter’s company was rotting Draco’s usually sharp comprehension skills.
“You arranged a future for me but didn’t bother to arrange one for yourself.” Draco didn’t phrase it as a question since it was becoming an evident fact.
“Fucking hell,” Malfoy whispered from above him. He seemed to be attempting to recover from shock. “Umm… that was bracing. You really
Harry wasn’t sure if it counted as shopping when Draco was only selling stuff. But yes, he’d had plenty.
He needed to improve the situation. If Potter presented a bad report to the Headmistress, then Draco’s time at Hogwarts was over. He didn’t want to think what might happen to him then. Draco would be nineteen when he graduated, and with suitable qualifications behind him, he should have a chance at independence. But that wasn’t going to happen for Draco. Employers in Britain would still view him as an untrustworthy Malfoy, and he had no financial means of venturing elsewhere.
He’d agreed to attend Hogwarts for one reason only, because his only alternative was to remain at the Manor. A third option didn’t exist. He couldn’t bear to live in the Manor anymore; it was tainted beyond repair. His mother had asked him to stay home, ostensibly for his own protection, but she’d also made her priorities clear. And those priorities were not Draco.
A thin tendril of bright white smoke was emerging from the tip of the wand which he held in his right fist by the unfinished handle.
Harry locked his lower body in place, savoured the firm but insufficient grip on his penis and awaited instructions. It felt lovely to have his arms around Draco’s shoulders. His fingers caressed the layer of soft woollen jumper covering the strength which Harry knew was beneath. He was secure here. Safe.
Harry’s cock was thickening. He wondered if Draco would allow him to play with it and decided to find out. Harry bowed his head, but not yet in submission. Instead, he gave himself a lovely view as he wrapped his right fist around his rising penis and treated it to a few delicious tugs.
Draco tugged Harry close and dropped a kiss to his forehead. That action always made Harry feel safe. “Of course, I would. I don’t want to be here without you, Potter.”
The urgency with which Harry’s request was immediately granted betrayed Draco’s true level of arousal; there was nothing calm or restrained about this kiss. Harry soon lost himself in what became an almost desperate need for intimacy. He wanted to be closer,
“Harry. Look at me.” Turning his head, Harry did as instructed. “I think…” Draco audibly and deeply inhaled. “That you’ve shagged a whole lot of
An unsettling suspicion grew within Draco. “Are you merely looking for a distraction, Potter? Something to brighten your dull days?”
. Sponsors reported directly to the Headmistress regarding their subject’s conformance to the mould of perfect, non-threatening student, and the Headmistress in turn related that information to the Ministry.
“I think we’ve been over the issue of ‘mattering’ before.” They had. A lot. Harry was still working on it. “But Weasley did… something, didn’t he?”
, for not asking me ages ago. Surely, out of all the people in the world, I could be relied upon to properly disparage you. I’ve put years of effort into it.”
The focus of Malfoy’s gaze switched back and forth between Harry and the room around them as the walls started to buckle outwards.
that.” Draco’s right hand slid across the sheet, over his hip and towards his groin. Harry lightly batted it away. With a huff, Draco returned his hand to the mattress, wriggled his bum against Harry’s erection and said, “Fine. Just as well that I have no expectations of greatness here. You
Luna was looking up at him with such faithful expectation that Harry felt obliged to at least say something vaguely useful. But nothing was occurring to him.
Harry’s eyelids fell closed, he needed to concentrate. It was simply an issue of mind over matter… mind over matter… mind ov – oh,
“It’s easier to dish out advice than it is to heed it though. I feel like I should be doing something more important. I’m the last Malfoy. Intentionally. So, unless you squeeze out a child, that’s it for the family line.”
.” Harry jumped as he heard what he thought was splintering wood behind him. A quick glance revealed a split in the large front piece of the bureau. The left leg also now had a deep gash running down the length of the polished surface.
enjoy it. If I worked it into our roles. Topping under my explicit instructions, that type of thing. I thought you might like that. The whole being in a position where it
The inanity of these morning encounters was sucking the life from Draco’s soul. He often prayed that the Weasel would take a swing at him, just to offer some relief from the monotony of this recently mundane existence, even though Draco couldn’t hit back. Draco missed it, the satisfaction of a good fight, the fulfilment of parrying insults, fists or hexes back and forth.
A response in the affirmative seemed redundant. But as Draco curled his arm into his chest, and the seconds slowly passed, he was aware that he needed to say
Malfoy was clearly surprised too. Oops. Harry wasn’t supposed to be making decisions within this context, let alone using accidentally helpful wandless magic. He bit his lip again and blinked up at Draco, hoping for a positive reaction. After a short hesitation, the only reaction Harry received was a shrug before Malfoy pushed in.
. Not only had Harry utterly and irredeemably humiliated himself, his reward had been withdrawn. And Harry so badly wanted to play with it.
there anymore?” Ron noisily inhaled through his teeth. “There’s so many things that I struggle to keep track.”
The gleam in Draco’s eyes told Harry that he knew everything there was to report. Luna and those nargles had a lot to answer for.
When Harry’s back hit the bed, he released the wrist and used his legs to grip Draco’s waist instead when Draco began to properly bugger him into the mattress.
those friends, he reminded himself. Well, most of them. But he hadn’t let them assist him much of late. Harry shouldn’t need to bother people with his problems. He'd always taken care of himself when no-one else had wanted to… and it had become his job to take care of other people. Except, except
Draco’s silence continued as he surveyed the black fabric, and it occurred to Harry what might be causing the hesitance.
“Don’t insult me, Potter,” Draco warned. “You’re the one who always wants to be wherever I am. So, I’m just letting you know that you’re welcome to do exactly that. Hang around, if you like. But I have terms.”
wanted to. Using his fist to coat his shaft, Harry’s cock and indignation reached new heights. Draco was going to feel this for a
Harry should clean up his own messes. “No, I’ll do it. Still… wobbly. I’ll give myself a minute, then I’ll get to it. Don’t want to bring the ceiling down or something. Was trying that… breathing thing you taught me.”
Draco got to organizing the books by name and class, and was about halfway done after an hour or two. He wiped his sweaty forehead before realizing—shit, he still had to organize all the books in the trunk before getting to everything else.
They went in separately, well kind of. Harry told Draco to stay behind for a few minutes and they could say they were gone for separate reasons, but as Draco put it- he got cold- he was about two seconds behind him.
The train blew it's ear banging whistle, signaling that they reached their final destination. Ron and Hermione had come back to meet Harry off the train. The platform was empty except for them a pompous group of Slytherins walking their way. Harry tried not to smile, but he didn't have the edge to after Draco kept a malicious stare.
"Oi," Ron said, "why did she only say Pansy and Hermione? That's not fair, Draco is a partner to Harry."
"Yeah. It wasn't as familiar as I wanted it to be," Harry said, his voice deep and smooth, although he started to babble. "I was always so nervous, and the director, Jaycee, she said I had the best form, and I completely doubted that until she put me in front of the whole class, and I stepped on Brady's ankle and she twisted it... so embarrassing..." Draco couldn't help it, and he let go of Harry completely before grabbing Harry's cheeks with both hands and kissing him deeply. Harry, although startled, relaxed and put his hands on Draco's biceps, and rubbed them along his shoulders.
"I don't," Harry said. "I've never believed in a happy ending. I'm too trusting. I know that's my weakness."
"Take it," Draco said almost sheepishly. Harry kept staring as if he had grown three heads. Draco scoffed and did they only logical thing he could do with the least embarrassment. He threw it at him, Harry almost dropping it as he caught it last minute.
"May I kiss you? Your skin? I owe you nine-hundred more kisses." Draco bit his lip. "Please. I want to take care of you."
Harry took the fiery-black book and opened to the first page to see neat, cursive writing in green ink. Draco's handwriting. The date was scribbled the top right corner of the paper: November 16th 1994. Directly below that was an entry that took up the entire page, sitting there, ready for its secrets to be revealed.
Narcissa walked in with a tray of food, only to find two boys sitting crisscross, adjacent to each other. Their faces were flushed and red, but she tried not to notice that Draco's shirt buttons were messed up. She kept back a smirk as she placed the food on their bed.
And without thinking, Draco draped an arm around Harry's neck and buried one in his hair, pulling on it, because fuck it felt so good to. And Harry was so warm and safe and
"Harry, don't worry about it. You're saying good bye to your family. Take your time. I can have you all I want after."
Draco had on a nice shirt and a tie, a suit jacket to cover it. "I'm trying to impress them. I want to dress nicely. I'm basically meeting my fiancés parents."
"Actually Professor, I didn't think I was eligible to take this course and I'm afraid I've come unprepared."
The kiss they were sharing in the mirror grew heated as mirror-Harry grabbed mirror-Draco's tie, pulling it loose and ripping off his robe. Mirror-Draco moved his hands through mirror-Harry's hair and within a blink of the eye, they were both naked, pressed against each other,  and mirror-Harry jumped on mirror-Draco's waist, wrapping his legs around his hips.
"What, am I making you nervous," Harry asked, stroking his left arm. Draco pulled away but stayed. "I'm not going to judge you, Draco, just think! Anything!"
Harry just leaned his cheek against the bar, falling in love with Draco’s eyes, which still seemed watery. “Do you kiss all your prisoners,” he asked quietly.
"Professor, We aren't plotting against anybody-" Draco said rushed and terrified, but McGonagall cut him off.
Those were the words that circled in Harry's brain over and over and over again during breakfast the next morning, and later throughout the day.
Draco couldn't help but moan, a fuzziness and warmth there that was almost unbearable. He took Harry in his arms and kissed him back, equally passionately, because for a few months now, Harry was too scared to let him enjoy this, to be any part of his true self. And this felt true and honest and damned good.
Draco felt terrible as well. How come the mudblood gets a hug from Potter and he doesn't? That wasn't fair!
"You wanted to study." Harry paused. "I'm sorry that our three hours a week is so detrimental to your study schedule."
"I'm not wasting time. Not with you," Harry ran after him. "You're not a waste of time! You're the only person I care about right now, war or no war! Draco please, I can't lose you again!" Harry stared at Draco's back as he walked away, thinking of a way to stop him. He grabbed his arm and spun him around.
Harry walked down the path, seeking a certain, special person: Draco. The steam was making it worse for sight.
"He left me this morning! He said he'd stay with me until I woke up and he left me alone," Harry felt hot tears drip down his cheeks, blocking out the noise of people coming in to the common room. "He left me. He would never leave me if he remembered me. Please. Just do it."
Harry put a hand on Draco's cheek and made him look him in the eyes through his tears. They were mercury.
"Excuse me, Weasley. You snuck into the Slytherin one in Second Year," Draco argued. "And accused me of being Salazar Slytherin's descendant when a murderous snake was running around the school—which don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you think so greatly of me to be able to do such a thing, but you're not innocent. Yes, I went into your dorm once and never wanted to go back because this shade of red is a nightmare."
Anger boiled in his stomach enough to turn his face red. A fist connected with Draco's jaw and he was on the floor. Draco grasped his bone in siring pain, looking up to see a teary eyed Harry.
“You are so demanding,” Draco shouted with a smile on his face as Harry stopped spinning them, but still his arms were draped around his hips. They were so close, Harry’s chest was up against Draco’s back and he could feel the curve of it, and the blonde could feel his lover’s speedy heartbeat. He pulled him closer, his chin stabbing into Draco’s neck as he snuggled up to him. “How do you want me to kiss you?”
Then he put it down on the table and flipped through it. The rest of the individual profiles filled the second and third page, but they were much smaller than Potter's. On the fourth page, there were pictures of all the champions together, and as the picture moved, it showed Potter looking up at Diggory.
Draco, rather than getting angry at him, deflated. "I hope you find peace with yourself with this. I don't think you should lose sleep over it. But my opinion shouldn't matter. I'm messed up. Apparently."
"You know he's just going to go see him, they'll probably break every rule in the book, and then come back here and act like he really did go to the bathroom, right?"
And then like that the sensation was gone. He smiled to himself it was over, and footsteps led away from him. He was going to move when suddenly they were coming back and another pair of lips were capturing his and he felt himself melting in pleasure.
"Yes, Harry. It's fine. I was fine. He's just worried about my future is all. I'm not serious enough."
"Of course," Draco answered, "I feel like before every fight or insult there would be a brief pause and we would look into each others eyes and ask ourselves if the other was being real or not. Most of the time we had good communication though."
“Before our last first date, that week, me and her hung out… and she just got on top of me and we started snogging, and at the time I was really angry I even agreed to going with you, so it’s not like I knew what I was doing and-“
“Go in one by one,” Harry suggested, greedily taking in the heat next to his body. Draco tried thinking of another idea- at least making time go by so the rush of the crowd wasn’t as thick. “If we go in together, even a few people will notice and spread rumors.”
"Bloody Gryffindors..." Draco stepped up but suddenly a piece of rock crumbled beneath him causing him to lose footing. If Harry wasn't there, he probably would have fallen.
"It's not my fault, it's my job." Harry kissed him again, too short. Then, still sitting on him, Harry turned around and grabbed one of Draco's books. "This is for Flitwick's essay, right?"
They were quiet most the walk and the corridors were empty, considering everyone was probably partying like a manic at the dance. That's a good one. Harry Potter doesn't even attend his own ball.
"I promise to challenge you, and I probably will challenge you every day, and I will openly accept your challenges in return. I promise to make you feel safe. I promise to make love to you and always be yours. You brought so much color and fire into my life and I promise to never let that burn out. And," Draco took a big, shaky breath and looked deep into Harry's eyes, a tear falling from his own eye, "I promise to remember you even if I forget you. And I promise to find you if I ever lose you again. And above all, I will love you until time runs out, freely and unconditionally, and endlessly and hopelessly."
"No. But I want him to live his life. I'd hate if he kept obsessing over him all day every day. Something has to give."
"Well if you hadn't noticed, Harry, neither of us are healthy people. We don't know what's okay and what's not. I'm your first boyfriend, and you're mine. We're figuring things out."
"We're not going to argue about this now. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring it up." Draco pinched his nose. "Harry, you need to leave. Permanently."
There was an empty cell just before Lucius's. Draco stared at it. He whispered. "This was mine. It had to be." Harry rubbed his back subtly. "You have no idea how happy I am that I'm not here."
"Yeah, Malfoy, let go of him," Ron shouted, and they approached them, Draco only letting go when he had to, giving Harry a squeeze before pulling away.
Under his fingertips, Harry's breathing became shallow. Draco could have asked him about it, but he didn't want to ruin anything, especially with the way Harry tightened up.
Sometimes they would go broomstick riding at midnight, or the two would hang out and talk, kiss a little... okay a lot, and at the end of each meeting, they would choreograph their next fight, insults and all. Their deceit was at an all time high, and fooling everyone was simple and grand.
“Alright then. Girl next to her, blonde, tall, a lot of make up,” Harry took a glimpse. “I’d give her a five and a half just because she looks like a clown. Possibly without the make up, an eight.”
Draco bit, "It is our business because you stole our power to come out on our terms. When we were ready."
Draco accepted more kisses, which were sweet and lovely, but there was also a part to him that was absolutely terrified. Harry's friends were great to Harry.
"I still can't believe you have feelings," Ron said abruptly. "I never even thought about you... in a relationship," he furrowed his eyebrows, not wanting to at all. Draco Malfoy was a toad. A gross, ugly toad that Ron hated. No. Draco Malfoy was a spider. Spiders don't feel. Spiders kill. "I would have never thought you were gay."
"Do you think he's really killing him in there," Neville asked, more concerned than he should have been. They could hear a crash of furniture and suddenly everything went silent in the hallway.
"That's why I've been so scared to date, too. I don't want to be taken advantaged of. But I figured I'd try it with you because I know you. You're a bloody prick, and it must've been really hard for you to even admit that you had feelings for me. Not because I'm famous, but because you don't care about me for my name—well, I think you kind of do, but you also see me as this dumb git who you have a crush on and would like to get to know."
Draco shut the door and closed it behind him, locking it as Harry pulled off the cloak and surveyed the room. He had one of the windows that mirrored the atrium, large and ceiling high, peeking into the black lake. It was adjacent to his bed and lit the room with a blue tinge. Still, there were several candle holders along the walls that helped counter the glow with red. They helped with warmth, too.
Just as promised, they reached the forest walking with their palms connected in front of the whole student body- although they didn't know it; however it's not as if the gait wasn't dangerous. They had to remain silent the whole time, for students were practically everywhere. And trust me when I say they had to cover their mouths to keep from laughing when Harry tripped on a branch right in the middle of them all.
Draco didn't break. Frankly, he didn't know why he started this fight, except he was actually jealous. "Anything else?"
"I think we all know that," Draco said cheekily as he stepped in the room and gave Harry a quick kiss on the cheek before taking his hand and encasing it in his own. "What's going on?"
"They were being cheeky. He nudged her shoulder... wiped hair out of her face. He said she looked nice. Stuttered, blushed when she said the same."
"Oh, but Harry, don't you ever think about what could have happened if I just was a little more careful? If I'd just have buttoned my cuffs with different clasps?"
"I love you, too," Draco said without even thinking it, and that's what made him go over the edge with a cry, with hands gripping Harry tightly, and with tears rolling down his face. Harry sobbed before, too, reaching climax. And the lay there together, naked, blushed and sweaty bodies against the cold unforgiving wind.
"I don't give a damn about the spell. I'm talking about not listening to me. I'm talking about you abandoning me when I needed you. I'm talking about you destroying me when I was holding onto you. I'm talking about right now, refusing to listen to me, being so concerned about your pride that you can't even help someone who needed you."
Harry gave a small laugh. "I just... remember growing up thinking that no one would ever want to do anything with me... The Dursley's... they made me hate me, and when you're a kid growing up like that... it can really mess with you."
"Harry, tell it to close! Shut it!" Hermione, who must've came out of the tent to check on him, went to him, rubbing his back.
"So we will be running on no food, no sleep, and no sex all day." Draco smiled slightly at that, a half-smirk so to speak, before frowning oh so faintly as he massaged Harry's head.
Then he kissed Draco's cheek—the second time he'd done so—and left. When he did, Draco immediately wiped the tingle where Potter's lips touched him.
Harry just shrugged and smiled at him before kissing his cheek, but Draco anticipated it and turned his head last second. He grabbed Harry's cheeks to keep him from leaving. Harry wanted to push him away and tried to, but Draco held no avail, and forced his way into Harry's mouth. The hand that was applying force upon Draco relaxed and was still placed on his chest.
“Yes! So when I lost my memory I never hung out with Harry and since I was a death eater, I was hated by everyone in the school, except Harry, so one day I was walking and the captains of the Hufflepuff quidditch team came and beat me up,” Draco said all too excited. “So I ran into Harry in the hallway, like literally and I had a black eye and Harry saw it and took care of me. He said he was going to the hospital wing to get me medicine, when really, he went and beat the crap out of him! He beat up people for me, isn’t that fantastic,” Draco exclaimed. He received wild eyes in return.
Then he moved his fingertips to Harry's earlobes and gently massaging them. "Mmm, that feels good," Harry said.
"Well, somewhat sir. When the third task came along he was too concerned about me to focus and that's how he ended up with you in the graveyard. He didn't notice where he was until you captured him. We were simply aiding you."
a traumatic thing. More traumatic than himself being nearly beaten to death. Because physical wounds can heal, but when you're forced to hurt the person you love most, it burns your soul. It stays there forever. Not even the forgiveness of the person you loved will get it off.
"Remind me, again, why I ever agreed to play quidditch with you," Draco called from other side of the pitch as he flew to the Gryffindor.
"Harry, please," Draco cried, trying to get him to let go, but Harry's eyes were glued to it, and the grip on his wrist was so strong Draco's hand was turning numb, and his clasp on the ring box was faltering. "Harry, it's not what it looks like-"
No. He felt it in his soul that this couldn’t possibly be. It was too early. And he didn’t want to do it.
A sudden force knocked Harry to his knees, and Bellatrix grabbed him by his hair. Footsteps walked towards him, and through glossy eyes, he saw white blond hair and mercury eyes.
The potions classroom came back to Harry despite his yearn for it not to, because now he had to deal with an explosion at hand. He felt sick. His knees felt weak and throat burned and closed; and his mouth went dry and eyes watered and stomach twisted.
Draco tried jerking him awake, calling for him, shouting his name and kissing his hand. Nothing worked.
Peering into the room to see Draco cuddled in a blanket donut, a small smile on his face. He was "too cute" as Harry put it whenever he found him like this. Ever since that day, Harry or Draco would wake each other softly of kiss them to make sure the other was happy. Those days were the best.
Draco licked his lips, his heart skipping a beat. "It would be mean to make fun of your boyfriend, wouldn't it?"
"How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you!" Don't you know how hard I've had to work? How miserable I've been? How I'm a ghost of a person, an empty shell. I've been robbed.
Then Hermione hugged him sweetly, and then went to Harry. Ron stood there and eyed him, only to have Draco raise an eyebrow at him.
"I wrote to Aunt Andromeda. She said the eye color thing... it's more true than not. At least, according to her. I don't really want to believe her. Could still be a fairy tale."
"I don't want to be a normal couple," he continued. "I like what we have. I want what we have now. But when I think of you, I want to think of you as my boyfriend. That matters to me. Unless you don't want it."
Snape gave him a glare made of daggers, but then realized he wouldn't be saying it, or moreover, he wouldn't be saying it in that way if the only thing he had cared about was in a risk of peril. "You listen to me. You should have ended it when you had the chance. Voldemort got to him in the Department of Mysteries. Somehow Potter snuck out and he was founded in the Ministry of Magic."
"How did we get together," he finished for her.  He could see her shoulders were tense, and she still hid halfway behind the book case. Draco bit his lip. "It's a long of a story."
“Worse than when you broke a plate in your back? You were out for almost 3 months! I thought you’d be paralyzed.”
"No, I do," Draco sighed, turning so his neck was open for him. Harry aimed for the throat, but felt cold metal along his chin and look to see the necklace he'd given him resting on the skin. Harry went to find the clasp and started undoing it, however, Draco grasped his hand, causing him to stop. "Harry, I've never taken this off."
What if his plan didn't work? And by plan—which fucking one? He had become a mastermind at making them by now.
Draco rushed to his bedroom with his stomach in his throat and a heart beating too fast to handle. He locked his door and paced for several moments, though his body felt sore and weak. And for the first time in his head, Draco said
"Okay," Draco said in place of greeting him. He lay in the bed the Room of Requirement gave him, pulling back the sheets for Harry to crawl under, even if he didn't quite feel it. "Er..." He tried to think of other things that had happened, but frankly, his days were quite boring. "Oh! Did you know Finnegan and Thomas are dating!"
"Are you mad? It's the middle of October, I'm expecting the snow to come soon, and you want to go swimming in the lake?"
"I think I know how." Draco rolled over on top of Harry and leaned in ready to devour the boy with his lips but the click on the door handle and Draco's first reflex was to punch Harry in his stomach, receiving a yelp from the other boy.
"I'm not stupid. Your friends aren't your friends, Harry, they're your family. Making you choose would be stupid. You can have us all."
"Come on." Draco grabbed his hand. They handed them to random children they found along their walk to Blaise and Pansy, who were outside Gladrags Wizardwear. Most of the kids were thrilled, some of the parents asking for pictures or autographs, which they respectfully declined.
It set his blood aflame. He stood, but immediately his spine jolted, the disks in his spine touching his nerves and sending lightning vibrations down his legs. "Fuck you, you snake."
There were three bodies hanging by their ankles in place of the chandler, all of whom were dirty and bloody and
"It's sweet you want to protect me, but please don't forget that you're the one that he's after. Not me. I'll be fine. How are you going to protect yourself?"
"Umbridge gave me detention. It was completely unavoidable and I know I'm a terrible boyfriend for not telling you. Like I said, I got angry."
"It's not broken. It was stuck on 1260 for the past five months. And its been one week since you got your memory back, which means you love me again, or at least remember it."
And then Harry frowned. Because it wasn't a good day for him. It wasn't a good day for Dumbledore's Army, nor Dumbledore, nor any of his friends.
"What? I'm in pain Pansy! How am I supposed to focus on my date with Harry if I'm undergoing a heart attack!?" His voice broke every few words. He was freaking our over a certain warm and fuzzy feeling feeling in his chest.
"Mr. Potter, I'm pleased to meet you." Harry shook her hand but didn't say anything. "Let's start with a few questions. What brought you here today?"
"Friday the Thirteenth," she moaned in despair, "Danger! Mortal peril!" Harry glanced at Draco when his friends looked away, and they locked eyes again before the blonde lost complete control and chuckled. "This is it! This is my end!"
"The door to the pantry was broken off one of the hinges, which meant it had a large gap that I could see through. I watched my parents die right before me. I saw them laugh. I saw one spit on my dad's body. And to this day, I remember the name and the face of every single one of those Death Eaters. Bellatrix Lestrange. Barty Crouch Junior. Igor Karkaroff. Evan Rosier.
"Oh, Harry, how bad could it be," Ginny asked the rhetorical question before turning to Hermione to read it. It could be bad. It could be a vivid sex fantasy, it could be a vulgar inside joke, or even worse, a generic wizard pick up line.
“When I woke up next to him after the war. I wanted it to be like that for the rest of my life, and I love doing it. We work for each other,” Draco told, “We love each other, we balance each other out, and I could never see myself loving anyone as I love him.”
Draco and Harry looked each other in the eyes, blushing and smiling bashfully. Then Draco said, rubbing his arm, "Don't worry, we don't have to. We're on a break."
Roger studied Mike’s face for a few seconds. The man wasn’t stupid; he’d worked in pubs too long to not be able to tell when he was being told only part of a story. Harry may not have seen Mike’s onslaught coming, but he doubted Roger would be fooled by the man’s supposed innocence.
“No, not this time,” Harry said conversationally, peeking his head round the wall very quickly to see if the crowd had eased off. It hadn’t, there was still a swarm of cheering, shouting, occasionally crying manic witches and wizards surging through the main street of Hogsmeade, congregating outside The Three Broomsticks and The Hog’s Head
“Do you want to know a secret,” Malfoy said, lowering his voice to a whisper so Harry had to lean in even further to hear him.
“I already know him though,” Harry pointed out, “I’ve known him since I was eleven. I’ve literally met his parents and been to his house.” Well, had altercations with his parents and been held prisoner at his house, but it was the same thing technically.
Harry drummed his fingers on the bar as he considered his answer. It wasn’t that he was unwilling to share with Malfoy, Merlin knows the other man had been open and forthcoming with him, it was just such a long and complicated story he wasn’t sure they had time for it. He glanced quickly at the clock and noticed there was only ten minutes until midnight.
there; something that made him smile at Malfoy’s jokes, even if they were insulting Harry, a reluctant appreciation for his skill, and a comfortable camaraderie between them. Being with Malfoy was like pulling on an old, warm jumper after years of forgetting it existed.
him the way he did at school, Malfoy found it funny the same way Harry found it funny whenever Ron tripped over and sprawled on the floor. Harry couldn’t see any sign Malfoy was about to draw his wand either so relaxed slightly, strolling closer to the blonde with only a quick glance down at his hands to make sure he wasn’t up to anything. He stopped in front of Malfoy.
“The dung bombs, well, Weasley – the fun one - doesn’t mind bulk buying from his shop and was glad of both the business and the implications of a massive chaos-causing prank happening.”
Harry turned his head to the side, his cheek pressed into the sticky bar top and sighed dramatically, self-pity seeping into him. He frowned as his eyes fell on a full pint glass sitting right where he left it. That wasn’t right; Malfoy had five drinks on his tray, Harry had counted, so why was there still one here? Had he forgotten it? Should Harry give it to one of the waitresses to take to his table?
Harry sucked in his bottom lip and clamped it between his teeth, trying for quiet, aiming to please. He needed to come, longed to obey, and hoped he could be buggered upon this mattress forever. But that wasn’t likely to happen; Malfoy was speeding up and Harry sensed that at least one of their orgasms was imminent. Biting his lip harder, he tried to ensure that it wouldn’t be his.
“He shouldn’t be able to purchase a new wand,” Harry decided. Technically, that wouldn’t prevent Michael from nicking one from someone else, but it would hopefully hamper his efforts to use magic.
that he hadn’t fallen over yet despite a couple of close calls. Malfoy’s hitching breaths and moans spurred him on; he
At the thought of receiving Finnigan’s slobbering assistance, Draco imagined that he could feel the blood draining from his face. But no matter, Draco could play this game with much more skill than Potter.
That hadn’t been very reassuring. Even as Draco’s arm embraced him, Harry still sensed a degree of hesitancy. He brought his own right arm up around Draco’s shoulder. Maybe Harry was making something out of nothing, he knew that was a tendency of his.
The room didn’t have any resemblance to the last time Draco was here. Instead of burning stacks and walls, Draco stepped into a bedroom. The room was subtly decorated in shades of cream and beige, an unimaginative but inoffensive choice of decor.
“After graduation, the sponsorship programme will extend for one more year,” Potter announced. “With funds for living costs, getting you set up… and all that.” Potter waved his hand in a vague gesture which was evidently meant to convey whatever ‘all that’ consisted of.
“Sorry,” mumbled Potter, before immediately returning to his important task of gazing into nothingness.
Events continued very rapidly from that point. Harry rested his left cheek on the table and gratefully took the fucking he was given, shoving back the best he could to meet Malfoy’s brutal pace while trying to ignore the pleasure of his cock trapped and sliding against the wooden surface. Again, Malfoy had made it extremely clear at the outset of this session that Harry was not permitted to come.
“I’m… tired. Shut up.” He closed his eyes, rubbing his temples with weary fingers as he tried to block out the world. Harry would dearly love it if he could skip today all together. And possibly the rest of the week.
“Yeah.” He lifted his head to look at Malfoy again, keen to show that he was serious. “Like you mentioned, I have a fair bit of time on my hands now. Maybe a project will help me not to dwell on the… other stuff.”
Yes, Luna was. Not everyone could recognise that quality beyond her unconventional exterior, but Luna could achieve anything she set her mind to.
“I am… it’s fun. There’s much less international conferences about pointless details. And I don’t miss the endless schedule-juggling.”
were a bit busy too for a while there. I was just lucky to be invited into the exciting foray of your political career.”
That was ridiculous. And troubling. It wasn’t like Draco to doubt his own merits. Deep down, Draco might not be the epitome of self-confidence which he liked to portray, but he didn’t usually defer credit for something he’d earned to anyone else. Clearly, Draco didn’t believe that he
But Malfoy didn’t seem keen on that plan, if the rapid removal of cock from Harry’s hole was any indication. Harry let out an embarrassingly loud whine as his upper arms were grabbed and he was tugged upright, off the edge of the table and onto his unsteady feet.
“Presumptuous, Potter. On your back in the middle of the mattress.” Harry deliberately remained seated long enough to prompt a growled, “
Draco was going to climax very soon though. From the extent of Draco’s trembling, combined with a litany of swearing and other noises he was making, Harry estimated that it wouldn’t take many more thrusts. In fact, Harry used to be pretty good at getting a countdown right when his cock was driving the outcome. And it might make an interesting bet with Draco one day.
fifty-four inkwells? My family was crazy. I’m going to sell them to that weird bald bloke on Diagon Alley. He likes this kind of stuff.”
Harry was imagining a set of heavy steel handcuffs and how they might feel as Draco clicked them cruelly into place around his wrists when a sudden jangly metallic soft whump behind him made them both jump slightly.
Harry nodded. He did feel better. Steadier. During the last couple of months, he had become accustomed to feeling safe under Malfoy’s alternative brand of care.
Harry was grateful that Malfoy was one of the few people who understood when ‘then’ was, without any explanation. The instant of Voldemort’s demise had been as notable an event for Malfoy as it was for Harry.
looking. But he knew that wasn’t what Draco meant. He let his gaze roam upwards to seek Draco’s face. The smile was still there.
“Buggery, Malfoy. You’ll need to bugger the insolence out of me.” Draco’s eyes shone with interest. “And it’ll need to be
But Malfoy didn’t appear to think so. Malfoy’s hand extended towards the bedside table to lift his wand and lazily wave it in the direction of the light hanging from the ceiling above them as he uttered a charm. The room was bathed in soft illumination before the wand was placed back down.
Since it was difficult to hear Draco over Lucius' bellowing, Harry waved his hand dismissively at the portrait and silence reigned. For good measure, he also willed a swish of thick black material into existence to drape over the frame, hiding the complete image. That was better.
As a sponsored student, it was required that Draco reside in the same dormitory as his sponsor. The Ministry had decreed that it would enable the sponsors to carry out their duties with greater ease. But as far as Draco could tell, he was the only sponsored student in Hogwarts. Draco assumed that others had either declined the offer or their sponsors were more subtle than Potter. Lack of interaction with students in other Houses wasn’t conducive to gaining information. And Draco wasn’t going to ask. No, he was keeping his head down, aware that he was being carefully watched.
All Harry was required to do was stay were he was and take it. As he became caught in the onslaught of being roughly impaled, the tip of his erection rubbed against the underside of the desk with each of Malfoy’s inward thrusts. This increasing friction wasn’t helping Harry to maintain what he knew would be required self-control. He clutched his fingers together where they rested behind his neck and silently prayed to whatever deity might be out there that he wouldn’t come. It was a standing order that Harry was never to orgasm without Malfoy’s permission during these interactions.
“Thank you so much,” Harry offered to the man seated above him, relishing in the squish of come in his tender arse and wondering when he had last felt so grateful.
As Harry moved, the sheer size of the vibrator was re-established when it rubbed and prodded his insides. But Harry complied, wincing when he stretched his legs out and lowered his body. His winces turned into a sigh of pleasure as the full length of his cock settled on the mattress beneath him.
Potter shrugged. “It’s difficult to keep hating someone when you see what their life is really like.”
Hearing that judgment, Harry was struck by a strange epiphany. People may not have a high opinion of Harry, but it couldn’t
name which no-one in Britain is going to want to be associated with. No money. No assets of my own. No friends to assist me. No lovely house to retreat to and live a peaceful, beautiful life. Nowhere. To. Go,” he repeated, hoping that Potter’s useless excuse for a brain could grasp the concept.
Draco refocussed on Harry’s face as he replied, “Yes. I have a big vibrator somewhere around here. That’d take the pressure off you.”
“Oh, right.” Potter looked nervous, but determined, his gaze lowering briefly to Draco’s groin. “Do you want to… now?”
He watched Draco all the way down, anxious to ensure that this was okay. But Harry saw no trace of objection. Draco’s eyes were heavily-lidded, his lips slightly parted enough for Harry to hear pants of excitement, and Draco’s gaze was fixed on Harry’s face, examining Harry’s reactions as closely as Harry was monitoring Draco’s.
Harry gasped with a dizzying spike of guilt that he’d managed to ruin the hope of finding evidence by destroying Michael’s wand.
Malfoy’s hands tugged Harry forwards a little, lifting him partway up the shaft inside him. Harry’s hips were urged to rotate at the height of the lift, pressing Malfoy’s cock against his prostate and nearly causing him to lose focus. Malfoy brought him back down to sit, then released him to instead rest both hands on the mattress, arms spread wide.
Although Draco’s grin was still in place, it was wavering. Draco knew why Harry didn’t usually ask for that. Wanting Draco’s confidence back, Harry nodded fervently and the grin returned in full force. When Draco’s eyes twinkled with mischievous calculation, Harry even had the sense that he was about to be outmanoeuvred. But he would expect nothing less.
As he leaned back slightly in Draco’s embrace, the arms around Harry didn’t move, but also didn’t restrain him. Harry had cultivated a faint hope that Draco would never directly ask. Foolish to dream, he’d known. And if Harry wanted an honest relationship with Draco, then he had to be completely honest. But honesty, Harry was discovering, took strength. Harry’s strength felt debatable at best.
to come, but the conflict created by his desperate desire both to climax and to obey the instruction
As Draco’s wand had been raised and the beginning of the word uttered to enslave him, Harry had destroyed the boggart. The amortal being had just… ceased to exist when Harry screamed at Draco.
“Something very important,” Draco said as he rose. It amused him greatly when Potter hauled himself to his feet as well.
“Very good, Potter,” Draco said in a lower volume as he walked down to stand next to Harry. “We’ll knock that false sense of duty and obligation out of you yet.”
Harry should be taking advantage of that. And he could. Probably. “I need to… now that I’ve started this. It wouldn’t be fair if I disappoint you.”
When Harry was roughly pulled up and off and he could gasp in air, he was belatedly amazed at how calm he’d been; it hadn’t occurred to him that he might be held for too long. He had trusted that Malfoy wouldn’t.
,” Harry hissed as he yanked the lid off the jar again with considerably more force than necessary and threw it over his shoulder. A tinkle of glass from behind him suggested that it hadn’t landed well. Harry didn’t give a shit.
Harry silently accepted the inkwell and placed it into a nearby box which Draco had already packed some into. Sorting through the contents of Malfoy Manor had become a regular pastime for them both over the past month. And Harry was enjoying the process of discovery and organisation more than he’d thought he would.
. With effort, he called his magic back to him, forced it down. But the images that Lucius’ words had dredged from Harry’s memory weren’t making the control of his power any easier. Harry had a nauseatingly clear suspicion of whom Lucius was referring.
An eyebrow was raised, either due to curiosity about the reasons behind Harry's choice or the speed with which Harry had provided it, but Malfoy didn’t comment. Instead, Malfoy was peering at him as if he might be having an internal debate. Harry opted to sit in silence and see what would happen.
Draco rolled his eyes, but his continuing enthusiasm was evident by the aforementioned ‘wand’ twitching in interest near Harry’s hip. “I can’t believe you just said that.”
What Harry needed was to burrow underground and hide. He didn’t think the centre of the Earth would be far enough.
“She probably doesn’t want to give me much of a chance to back out of it. I’ve given her a lot of feeble excuses over the last few years.” Harry was ashamed to admit it.
