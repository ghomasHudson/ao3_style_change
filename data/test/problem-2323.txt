Juliet stood back up with a sneer on her face which she couldn't help as she began to arrange the books once again onto the bookshelf, being sure to stay at the end that he was not at.
''Are you tucking me in?'' she smirks and I can't help but smile humorously down at her.
''Yeah yeah'' she sighed with a smile.
''Ooo not very friendly'' he smirks conceitedly before turning lounging on his bed and grabbing his book off the table as I button up the front of my dress ''Bye then. Shut the door on your way out'' he says with the open book rested in his hands not bothering to look up at me.
''What are you doing?'' I breathe out as his hand flattens on my stomach and I turn my head slightly to look at his face.
''My parents died'' I whisper looking down at his hand and I feel his eyes tilt to my head.
''Fine'' he says grabbing the door handle and opening the front door before quickly closing it again and turning back around to look at me slowly ''It's a bit cold actually. Think I might just go to my bedroom instead'' he smiles back at me, that entertained smile.
The letter said she could come for an interview tomorrow at 1pm which she was actually very excited for.
I lick my lips savouring the taste on them that is hers, closing my eyes and resting my head against the wooden door with a shaky breath out.
''No need to be nervous, I don't bite'' she told me making me let out an awkward chuckle under my breath ''So, any experience being a maid for anyone?''
''What if I'm not happy enough to smile?'' he asks with a slight tilt to his head ''You ever thought of that? Has the smiley, happy girl in front of me ever thought of the fact that other people might just not be happy and never will be? To smile?''
''I think I should just apply for it, go for an interview-''
''Don't put words in my mouth-''
''We've touched before'' I say watching how he swallows deeply.
''I need to owl them'' she moaned making him look at her with a mocking pout ''Who doesn't have a phone these days?''
He radiated such domineering energy that I couldn't seem to get my head around. How this boy who was the same age as me, seemed to have the power and personality of someone older, someone with more experience maybe.
''Thank you'' he smirks lifting his hand to my hair and brushing a piece out of my face.
Silence.
''I'll give you four because I have to clean downstairs still'' I say crossing my legs and looking up at him with a smile which he soon returns.
I carry on cleaning his room without him saying a word to me. He just sits there peacefully in his desk chair. I catch him staring from time to time but he quickly reverts his gaze to which I think he actually believes tricks me into believing he hadn't been staring at me for almost this whole time.
''Right'' I say under my breath feeling agitated at the boys attitude and beginning to walk over to the cupboard where the cleaning supplies were and grab the polish and rag out only to turn around to see him staring at me as he sips his whisky.
''Why-'' I moan before I can even finish my sentence ''Why don't you want me around-around other boys?'' I ask through my breathless moans having to grab his leg and squeeze it tightly.
''What about?'' he asks letting his head rest near where mine is on his chest.
She smacks my chest with a groan ''You're such a fucking prick'' she snaps and I can only laugh at her.
''Shower's warm'' she smiles before stepping back and walking towards the shower, dropping her towel just before she walks in.
''Is this how you wanted to take your frustration out? To mock and make fun of me?'' I hiss at him.
I smile down at her and push a piece of hair behind her ear ''Do you want to repay the favour?'' I ask her, watching how she stands still in front of me.
''You think you're funny don't you?'' he says to me with a straight face and I walk back towards him.
I lift my arm to push him off me but instead I end up grabbing his shoulder and pulling him into me even more, causing a groan to escape his lips as he nibbles on my skin.
''Good girl'' he whispers beginning to circle his finger on my clit again as I let out another soft moan lifting my hips as he presses a finger into my pussy.
He walked back towards her as she stepped back until he pushed her against the library door with a slam of his hand on the wood beside her head making her flinch to the side.
''How are you sorry? You did nothing wrong'' I mutter back at him then tilting my head up to look at him ''Sorry, I just hear that a lot'' I smile kindly at him and he smiles back down at me.
''Fuck that's hot'' he breathes out looking down at me with eyes full of lust ''Come on, I know you want me. Even if it is just the one time'' he smirks placing his hands on either side of my waist and letting them glide down my side all the way to my thighs, his one hand smoothing to my ass and squeezing it tightly making me gasp.
''We most definitely do'' Astoria said joyfully, carrying on talking about whatever boring shit it was, I didn't care to listen very much to her.
I look behind me to see him watching me with a stern face.
He looked drained around his father with a lack of life. He was playful from what I had seen, maybe even funny at times around me despite how irritable he was. However, with his father, he was anything but.
''I'm not sure'' I reply quietly as he nods, my eyes scanning the side of his face.
''Y-yes'' I stutter, secretly enjoying the pain he had just put me through.
''You and Theodore are friends? Small world we live in'' she said flicking out her wand and casting a spell to allow my bags to float up in the air and through the open window upstairs ''That shall be your room, would you care to come see?'' she smiled moving out the way of the door to let me through.
''You offered-''
''Well, can I touch you, Juliet?'' he said through a husky voice, beginning to actually turn her on which she hated herself for as his hand glided down her arm softly.
''So where are you going now then?'' I ask with a smirk and a squint to my eyes seeing how his lips curl up.
''Yep. You proud of me?'' I smiled widely at him and he chuckled down at me letting his head tilt to the floor.
''Surprisingly not, no'' he murmurs looking down at his rings.
''Ah'' I wince grabbing the back of his head and playing with his platinum locks between my fingers.
Lucius had never said a word to me or any of his other staff unless he needed something in the hour he would be seen by our eyes. So all in all, it was good.
Although, I quite enjoy the way he's speaking to me right now.
''Yes'' she manages to whisper through a slight choke.
She grabs my thighs as she sucks on my cock, bobbing her head up and down in fast movements as I let out another moan thrusting myself into her mouth slowly.
His nose brushes mine before he lowers his lips to my cheek and places a kiss there causing shivers through my body as his hand grips tighter on my hip pulling me right into his groin.
''Carter?''
''I must be off, just came to drop Juliet off safely'' he said placing his hand on my lower back and smiling towards Narcissa.
My breathing shakes as my legs do the same, his one hand running up and down my thigh before squeezing it tightly.
''Goodnight'' he says before going back to his bedroom door and walking in there, closing the door gently behind him.
''Well-''
''Myself mainly, if you must know'' I answer naturally, not really caring how I come across to him anymore.
It's just me and him here now. Who's to say he's not going to murder me and hide my bones somewhere so no one can ever find me?
''I don't have a girlfriend'' he says quietly back in concentration.
''Actually, no. But I have been a waitress'' I smiled hoping she would accept that as a reasonable type of experience.
''Calm down darling. Relax''
Idiot.
''Right'' Narcissa rises herself from her chair ''I better go help clean the kitchen-''
I breath out and nod up at him. He then released my hand and placed them back on the desk looking down at me.
He chuckles as he watches me before cumming inside of me soon after and pushing his cum further into me with his cock.
I wonder what he thinks of me. Why he looks at me so often and why he is all of a sudden a little more bearable to be around.
''You keep looking away from me when I'm talking to you. It's rude'' he sneers down at me.
''Four and a half?''
''Something better than nice'' she mocks looking to the side of the room.
''Mother'' Draco says quietly shaking his head to tell her to not speak anymore.
''Quite cold out-''
''I'm gonna-''
''Can you just sit down?'' he snaps, my eyes widening at him at the audacity of him being annoyed at me for not sitting down when he literally tricked me out of my seat.
I pull her mouth open with my thumb and spit in her mouth closing it afterwards.
''Shut the fuck up'' I smirk pulling the covers over her arms and brushing a piece of hair out of her face ''Ok?'' I ask to make sure she has everything needed before I leave.
He sighs as he looks down at me as if I'm lesser of worth then him.
''Thank you'' I say stepping through the large black door in to the hallway as she walks ahead of me upstairs signalling me to follow her.
Her one hand reaches to the back of my hair playing with it between her fingertips.
And again,
''Why do you keep doing that?'' He snaps at me making me tilt my head up with a frown.
''You like something about me?'' I ask quietly trying not to fall to my knees at the boy letting his fingers stroke down a strand of my hair right now.
He smirks and lets out a breathily chuckle.
He pulls himself out a little before thrusting back into me in one harsh slam causing me to scream and lift my head up to bite onto his shoulder.
''Oh, erm, as soon as possible''
''I don't think'' I say with a curl edging my lips.
I began packing some of my things that I found to be necessary to take with me, such as clothing and valuable possessions being sure to pack as light as possible.
''I'm not in the mood'' I mutter to him with a pleading face for him to just leave me alone.
It's not until I almost trip up the stairs that I notice I had been staring at him for a little too long, causing him to grab me to keep me from smacking my face off the hard, wooden stairs.
I walked slowly towards the living room seeing Draco sat there with his head in his hands on the sofa in front of the large fireplace which crackled with orange flames.
He licks his lips looking down at mine before flickering his eyes back on mine ''I'm sure you'll find a way''
''What?''
''So beautiful'' he breathed out before lifting her up onto the kitchen counter and pulling her skirt back up again to grab her panties and pull them down, letting them drop to the floor.
''I know, but it can't harm to call you once in a while. I miss ya'' he says.
''She is to be your wife, you need to get to know her''
''Why's that?'' I ask flatting out the duvet onto his bed and tucking it under the pillows.
''Excuse me?''
''Loves yas'' he mocks making me shake my head at him.
Draco then turned around with pushing his fingers through his hair before his eyes locked on mine.
''And why's that mother? Hm? Enlighten me'' he snapped at her clenching his hands into a fist on the edge of the dining table, so strongly that the veins in his hands became more prominent, being easy to see from where even I was standing.
''It was-'' he looks over to the painting rested upon his wall ''A painting'' he says looking back down at me rather sure of himself as my body twists to look at him.
He looks back down at me licking his lips with a smile before pulling me up by my chin to sit up and look at him coming very close to my face, close enough that I could easily press my lips on his if I dared to.
A true depressive expression with not one ounce of happiness.
''I-I don't-''
''You, just now'' I say throwing his old sheets onto the floor and picking up the new ones.
I'm beginning to feel that being a maid may possibly not be for me since my back is killing from standing straight for so long without being able to sit down and my feel are beginning to ache from the flat shoes I wear against the stone floor. It was also cold, very cold in this house and my dress only did so much at warming me.
''And why should I smile Carter?'' he asks me tiredly.
''Hello Draco, how are you?'' she asked in her sophisticated tone.
''You literally accepted payment before we started-''
He smiles cheekily and nods over to his desk table beside his bed.
''Comfy'' I smirk up at her leaning my hands behind me.
''Just go and do it, what do you mean try? Just walk outside you dick head-''
''Swallow'' I assert her and swallows with a light hum closing her eyes and snapping them back open again to look back up at me.
''No'' I say clearly back to him finding my confidence at the boy who's nice persona had suddenly now changed once again.
''You smell nice'' she says and I roll my eyes with a smile.
I stand there to see if he will even give me at least a proper goodbye.
His arm instantly grips around my stomach to keep me from falling once again and turns me around quickly to push me against the wall and drop the belt to the floor.
''Fine by me, I could do with a break'' I smile only making him look at me even more pissed off that before.
''I can do anything you like. Nothing is a problem'' I smile back at her as she nods at me.
I turn around and look up at him with a frown ''Mr Winkles?'' I say with a look of disbelief and he nods down at me seriously ''Ok then'' I sigh and turn back around placing the quill back to the paper.
''No?'' he laughs at me then pushing himself out of his chair and bang his hands on the table making me flinch ''Get me a fucking drink-''
He's gentle but firm in all the best ways.
''Don't call me that'' she whispers into my neck as I clench my fingers on her waist ''I'd hate to soak your trousers''
''Fuck'' I moan throwing my head back then back forward to look at him as I suck on my bottom lip.
''Fuck, you taste impeccable'' he smiles into my pussy as he presses two fingers into my entrance thrusting them in and out in fast pace causing me to suck in a breath and moan through the pleasure.
''It's like you have a million mood swings a day'' I say and I feel him touch my thigh again making me look at him.
''Yes'' she replied, feeling completely vulnerable in this moment.
He stays leant against the door just staring back at me with a stern expression as I tap my toes together as they dangle over the desk.
''Because I'm interested-''
''Good little girl'' he whispers close to my lips as he picks up the pace with his hand again ''Such a pretty little fucking slut'' he hisses watching how my chest rises and falls as he pleasures me then looking back into my eyes before pressing two fingers into me and pounding me with them mercilessly.
''So you agree?'' he asks and I sigh not bothering to answer him ''Who's is it then?''
''I hate you'' Draco hissed at her ''you know that? I'll never stop despising you, you pathetic excuse of a mother''
I shake my head at the thought of her, wishing she would just stop lingering on my damn brain.
It's nice, however I just wonder how long it will last.
''I mean you are a slut in the bedroom, but not in general'' he says and I huff at him humorously ''Shall we continue walking?'' he asks and I nod in reply.
''No, no more drinking'' Narcissa snaps at him making me swallow harshly at the side of the room.
''Red lace?'' he asks huskily.
''You smell like cologne'' he suddenly says making me turn my head to look at him.
She felt him smirk into her skin before his hand was soon finding its way to the hem of her skin tight skirt she wore, dragging it up to just below her stomach as his hand brushed over her lace, black panties which were soaked already.
I smile and lean forward grabbing her by the waist and pulling her to sit on top of me. Her legs now straddling each side of me as my hand rests on her back to keep her held up securely.
Before I know it he's brushed my panties back to the side and licking a stripe up my pussy, then flicking his tongue on my clit.
''Charming'' I roll my eyes before pushing him out of the doorway making him stumble back a little and walking over to his bed.
''That doesn't matter. I'm used to people treating me like shit when I was a waitress with all those drunks looming around me-''
''You are dishing the compliment out today'' I say sarcastically. She shrugs down at me sucking on her bottom lip which I really hope she'd stop doing considering how hard I am right now.
''Thanks Malfoy I'll be off now-''
I stroke my hand down her waist enjoying the way she begs for me to kiss her.
''Now look who's following-''
I hate him still.
''Wait'' he says trying to sound as clear as possible through his sleepy voice and I turn back around to look at him ''Come in-''
He came climbed on the bed and grabbed the top of my panties yanking them down with one swift movement to throw them across the room. His hands stroke up my leg slowly as he looks down at me.
My heart must have just skipped 10 beats at least when I find that I have to suck in a harsh breath.
''700'' I smirk up at him trying to be a little more confident as he smirks down at me with a small chuckle.
''Your father won't be joining today. He has a heavy work load'' she puts simply as Draco rolls his eyes to his plate picking up his fork and pushing his food around.
Juliet moved out of the way of he door to the side, bowing her head to the floor to resist looking at him for any longer than she had already.
I stand there not knowing what to say opening my mouth then shutting it soon after.
''Well, some thin black stockings'' I smirk stroking my fingers in a circle against the side of my thigh.
''I-we just-''
''Mmm'' I hum with a smirk before wrapping her one arm around my neck for her and lifting her up into my arms and carrying her to her bed.
''Are you trying to kiss me Carter?'' I smirk through a whisper and she rolls her eyes at me then sucking on her bottom lip.
''Pretty please fuck'' I snap at him making him chuckle down at me.
Romeo and Juliet. He's hilarious.
''And underneath, I wear your favourite'' I almost whisper.
''Coming'' he said back before looking back at Juliet.
''You so want to kiss me right now'' I say with a smirk looking at her hair flowing between my fingertips.
''What's this?'' he asks brushing his fingers over the bite Draco had left on my neck again only yesterday making me wince.
''We should shower then'' I whisper and she nods causing her nose to brush even more against mine.
''I like watching you squeal'' he smirked lowering his head to my inner thigh to place a kiss there ''I like hearing you moan'' he whispers against my skin while pressing another kiss on my thigh getting higher to my pussy with his lips ''It calms me'' he says softly before licking a stripe up my pussy and humming through the taste.
''Just checking on you babe, wanted to see if everything was going alright''
My mind brought memories of simpler times, when they were alive. Of course it wasn't simple in the way of money or possessions, but it was simple in the way that we knew, as a family, that love would be all we needed to be safe and happy.
''Why? Does it make you feel like a lady of the night'' he mocks.
''This was a mistake '' I say heading to walk out of the bathroom door.
''I smell nicer'' he says, completely sure of himself.
''So wet for me'' he smirked into her lips causing her to let out a shaky breath as soon as his fingers brushed her panties to the side.
I face back forward and pull my one hand up to rest on the back of his head clenching his hair in my hand while he sucks on my clit in fast pace and his 2 fingers curl up inside me, pumping me rapidly.
''Stop doing that'' I rush out and she widens her eyes at me.
''Who's to say you have to be happy to smile?'' I ask and he frowns at me ''I smile and I'm not really all that happy, not entirely''
''I don't keep track of time Carter'' he says cutting me off.
''It's fine'' Draco breathed out as he looked into her eyes before letting go of her waist and stepping back.
''They're old fashioned'' he said with a yawn ''Not into the muggle shit''.
''Positive''
He leans up quickly and slaps me over the cheek then yanking my chin to look at him, the stinging on my skin beginning to burn from the harshness of his hand.
I look down to see his hand is bleeding which I widen my eyes at.
''Why are you so interested in my friends?'' I say back at him with a frown and he looks at me.
''Thank you, that's really kind of you'' I smile before walking towards the stares to make my way up to Draco's room.
''Ok'' he whispers letting his hand dip into my panties which my breath shakes at ''shhh''
Merlin I hate her.
The same one he holds every time around his father.
''Yes, I do'' I poke him in the chest as his thumb strokes over my cheek softly.
I open the library door not bothering to keep it open for him with him having to put his hand out to stop it from hitting him in the face.
''Why thank you kind sir'' she smirked before slipping her panties back up her legs and pulling down her skirt as he watched her in awe ''Why are you staring at me?'' she smiled awkwardly.
I smirk with a hum coming from my mouth ''Darling'' I whisper again making her bring her head out of my neck and look down at me daringly.
''Fuck Carter'' I breathe out lowering her head down slowly to take more of me.
''Oh, is that who you live with? The-''
It's like his words had such power because as soon as he said that my hand clenched harder around his hair as my hips jolted almost rocking the chair off it's legs. My teeth bit down hard on my bottom lip to keep me from screaming at the top of my lungs at the intense orgasm I had just experienced with a breathily 'fuck'' falling through my lips.
''Like what you see?'' she asks making me smirk and suck in the one side of my cheek.
''Car accident'' I say dabbing at his hand gently ''Not anything extraordinary. A car crashed into them and they died'' I simply say then placing the towel back onto the bathroom counter.
“Why?” Albus asks, feeling utterly bewildered. Yes, the girl definitely is what he described earlier, but why would she lie to bloody
“Mr and Mrs Travers are in my office, waiting news about the investigation. They were also asking to see their daughter’s body after the scene has been searched,” McGonagall says wearily.
Harry blinks, realising how he has been staring at Malfoy’s fingers, knowing how he bloody well needs to get a grip of himself!
His father gives him a sharp look.
There’s a long silence. Albus sits in the middle of his bed, his eyes trained at the schoolbag he’s filling with the books he will need later in his classes. He swallows hard as he sees Scorpius’s frame in his peripheral vision.
Albus frowns at him, looking confused. “N-No?”
Quinn nods slowly. “Do you think she was speaking ill of you?”
it’s about Albus’s brother. But before he can question his friend further, Julian, Cory, Cecil and Zachary sit down on the other side of the table, all red-faced and windswept, evidently due to a fun afternoon spent outside.
“What is it?” Scorpius whispers, his eyes moving between Albus and Rose, his features guarded.
Potter eyes Draco thoughtfully. “Anything else?”
Here it is! The great reveal! Eeek! I'm so excited (also cracking up) and I can't WAIT to hear what you guys think of this! :D
James grunts, leaning away from his mother, who tries to soothe his hair back. “’m fine, mum. Just want to rest for a b–” his voice trails off, as his gaze locks to somewhere behind Harry’s shoulder.
Potter is quiet for a bit before he replies, rather tightly, “Ginny’s not staying in the village. She’ll come straight to the school for the questionings.”
“Haven’t seen you in a while, Mr Potter,” the Fat Lady says with a kind smile.
“I was in the impression that you didn’t want to discuss the matter. That you swore it not to happen anymore.”
Draco’s mind whirls. Potter’s younger son – Albus – has recently dated the victim?
“Let’s start with Miss Westen, shall we?” Harry tells Quinn with a low voice, as they stop in front of a pile of large barrels.
Fox sits in the corner, while Quinn retakes his seat behind the desk.
Albus nearly snarls at Harry, jumping up from his seat and glaring at Harry and Ginny. “Betrayed?
, was saving his life during the final battle, perhaps even more times than the two Draco can remember.
Harry tries to give him a reassuring smile, but Malfoy’s expressionless face doesn’t falter, and then he too has disappeared into the room.
Potter chews the corner of his mouth. “The book; she could’ve been holding it, or tried to grab it before she lost consciousness…but the door…” He says, and glances at it, performing the detecting spells again.
“It doesn’t matter. We’ll be fine,” Albus says tersely, glancing at her. “Don’t worry about it.”
There’s another silence, longer this time, and Albus wonders what is happening, especially, when James continues, his voice now a bit muffled, “You don’t understand,” James murmurs. “My career…Char…everything will be ruined,” He says, sounding…something between hopeless and emotionless.
Harry nods. “I’ll floo you tonight.”
It is close to midnight, when they finally finish their sum up. Most of the Aurors stay in the school, and less than half go back to the village. Harry, however, makes his way back to the crime scene. He needs to see it once more, needs to be there, needs to look at it, in case anything comes up, anything he might’ve missed earlier.
Draco clears his throat. “Could you show me the bathroom?” He asks, rather stiffly.
His thoughts linger in the girl’s sad fate – how it all could’ve been prevented. Harry feels resigned as he thinks how something like that can happen by an accident. He thinks it wasn’t an accident, though, which doesn’t really make him feel any better about it.
“Code Green. Report to Headquarters,” Harry speaks calmly to the silver stag, feeling quite the opposite, before flicking his wand at it, multiplying it before sending it away.
Harry gives him a small scoff. “He
James clenches his jaw. “It’s not anyone’s business. Not even yours, Albus,” he says coldly, resuming to his pile of bedpans.
Last night was…horrible. Draco barely slept after learning the worrisome news about his son. Scorpius. He knows whatever it is, Scorpius cannot have anything to do with Travers’s death, he
Ginny lets out an outrageous gasp, her eyes moving sharply from Quinn, to Harry, to Albus, and back to Quinn.
“Sit down, Nate.” Moonstone says sternly. “We don’t think anything, yet, isn’t that right, Auror Potter?” Moonstone says with a calm voice, his eyes narrowing at Harry’s.
James grins back at him. “Will do, dad,” he says, before Harry leaves the dormitory.
Albus should know – as he himself is the least like anyone else in his family, compared to James and his Quidditch-stardom and brilliance, and Lily with her fiery and reckless Gryffindor nature. It’s almost funny, when Albus thinks about it – his siblings are so much like their parents, and their grandparents. But Albus… Albus is the black sheep. The one that doesn’t really belong. The Slytherin of the family. He only looks like the spitting image of his father. While both James and Lily share some similarities in their appearance with their father – James has bright green eyes, and Lily wears glasses – Albus still thinks his siblings have more Weasley characteristics than anything; Lily’s hair is long and flaming red, and her eyes are brown, just like their mother’s. James’s hair is more coppery tone, but paired with his freckles and the mischievous grin, there’s no doubt that he’s a Weasley.
Quinn glances at his notes. “You think James’s actions were not acceptable, even after what Travers had done to his brother?”
Groaning inwardly, Albus runs a hand through his unruly hair and turns to walk towards the Great Hall, knowing that dinner will be soon served, and deciding that there’s no point of going back to the dungeons.
“W-What the fuck, Albus?” Scorpius manages to stammer, through his surprise and annoyance.
And naturally, Harry wonders, if either the younger Miss Scott or Miss Westen and Albus are, or have been close – why else would they have lied in order to ‘protect’ Albus? He wonders if the witches are those kinds of girls his sons had described; chasing his son because he looks like Harry, which, truthfully, makes Harry’s skin crawl.
Their father looks from Albus to James and back, his brow creased. “Why didn’t you tell me that you dated her?” He asks again.
His father lets out a wavering breath. There’s a deep frown between his brows as he studies Albus’s features, somewhat helpless.
Draco watches as Potter continues the inspection. “It could be possible. That her locking spell was simply…weak. However, I doubt it could leave the signature to the door, and
He takes a deep breath, steeling himself. “Can we talk about last night?” He asks, very quietly, watching Malfoy’s reaction carefully.
“What did Myrus – Longbottom – say? When did this happen?” Potter asks hastily.
Slughorn shows up a moment later, panting slightly and gives the Headmistress a nod as she greets him, before he accompanies Fox and Flitwick.
Draco watches him expectantly, until, it must be at least ten minutes later, Potter gives Draco both a harsh and an eager look.
, between them. He wonders, if they will ever go back to that.
have some working brain cells, after all.
Harry ceases to rub the bridge of his nose and lifts his head up to meet Peele’s inquiring gaze with his own weary one. “Yeah, long day…” Harry mutters and pushes his glasses back to place. “Thought I came to rest here, but evidently I was wrong,” he jokes feebly, and adds with a small smile, “kids went back to school today.”
Quinn nods at her. “How did Miss Travers seem to you? Distressed? Peaceful?”
“Sir?” Quinn asks quietly.
“Hey, guys,” Albus says and slumps next to Scorpius. “What’s going on?” He asks, glancing from Scorpius to Julian and Zachary.
James looks at Albus, chewing the inside of his cheek, looking somewhat regretful. “Both, I think.”
“You didn’t answer my first question,” Albus says, scrutinising his friend. There’s something Scorpius is not telling him, and Albus feels a flicker of doubt when his friend looks at him.
“Yeah, instead you decided to fucking lure
Moonstone hums, looking thoughtful. “Not…outstanding, but good enough. Her grades were decent, and had she kept those up during her final year, she probably wouldn’t have had any problems receiving the entry-level position in the Ministry she was aiming for.”
For a moment, he tries to remember that night, at the pub. He tries to remember how it ended, tries to remember what had happened after the bathroom, after he had sucked Potter off, and after Potter had – but he can’t. All he can recall, is the feeling of emptiness the next morning, when he woke up from his bed at the Manor.
Harry wonders for a moment, what is going on between the father and son.
Malfoy merely gives him a brisk nod, and grunts a simple, “Potter,” before he leaves the room in a flutter of robes.
Harry thinks that other than the thirty minutes during which James was not in his compartment, his story seems perfectly unquestionable.
“Should they not be aware of it?” Draco asks simply.
“How did you react?” Quinn asks carefully.
– like that?!” Ginny yells, shaking her head in disbelief.
Harry feels anxious, briefly wondering if Scorpius and Albus had wanted to keep their relationship in secret so vehemently that they had…acted upon it?
It's the same look Harry has received from Draco multiple times. He snorts quietly, moving to open the window. The eagle owl drops the letter to Harry’s head, turns swiftly around, flapping its wings to Harry’s face as it does, before flying out of the window.
“During the train ride, she argued at least with three people. And found out that she was the victim of a prank,” Harry says.
Most of the students are in their dormitories, which Harry thinks is better, as they are only questioning the Prefects.
“Umph! Pamela!” Albus gasps and wrenches himself away from her, stumbling backwards. “W-What the hell?” He breathes, gaping at her.
“Is it because what happened?” Draco asks, finally putting in words the thought that has been swirling in his mind since that morning. If what happened between him and Potter is in fact the reason Potter is divorcing his wife.
“Because he’s my friend!” Albus yells exasperatedly, throwing his hands up, “Why do you think, arsehole?”
Potter takes off his glasses and buries his face in his hands, rubbing it anxiously. “And if that’s not horrible enough, I’m fairly certain my children know that their parents are going to divorce soon,” he says with a quiet voice, the heels of his palms pressing against his eyes, while his elbows are propped against the table.
Quinn tells them that he talked with Albus’s father, who told him what Albus had said this morning – that Albus did see the victim on the train. “Why don’t you start by telling us about the train ride? What happened and who were you with until the moment you saw Miss Travers?”
going to question Potter’s sons as well. So, perhaps he is the best. Still, Draco cannot stop the unease crawling into the bottom of his stomach.
Draco stares back at her with an equally expressionless look. He wonders if she knows. “Mrs Potter.” He replies with a miniscule nod, since he’s not bad-mannered. Just irritated by her presence.
Albus gives her a frown. She’s an example case of those fame-seeking witches, along with her sister, and Albus doesn’t really want to talk to her. But he’s curious to know if she was the one lying to the Aurors. Lying to his father.
Draco watches Potter, seeing how wrecked he looks. He knows there’s a lot of pressure upon the Head Auror, as the Minister and the school governors are all watching his every move, expecting him to solve the case in a record time. In addition to that, both his sons are being questioned, and regarded more of less as suspects in this investigation. His irritation towards the messy-haired wizard diminishes somewhat, as he sees the flicker of overcome behind his eyes, as Quinn continues to go over Rose Granger-Weasley’s questioning.
“Yes.” Albus says indifferently.
Scorpius watches him steadily. “It does.”
Draco’s eyes flicker to the book, and then back to meet his gaze. What the hell is Potter playing? “No recognisable traces of magic inside the room other than the door, which you examined and confirmed there to be traces of a locking spell – matching to the last spell performed by Miss Travers’s wand.”
Draco’s eyes follow the movement, wondering briefly what exactly is going on in his mind right now. His focus swiftly moves to the door as there’s a knock before it opens.
Because he’s quite certain he might be in love with his best friend.
They all watch Albus carefully, but Albus merely shrugs. “It was fine. Nothing special. I’ll be back in a bit.” He grunts, and then turns around, disappearing into the hall leading to the dormitories, and finally, stepping into the fifth-year-boys dormitory.
Scott takes in a shaky breath. “You wanted to come here, and I – I thought that…after the questioning, what I did…that you’d be grateful…”
“Repeat what Scorpius told us he asked from Travers, before the dispute in the corridor,” Harry says faintly.
The Headmistress clears her throat. “I have summoned you here, as it has come to our attention that all of you,” she says, glancing each of the students in turn, “have had some contact with Miss Travers either during the train ride, or before that.”
Albus gives his friend a grim nod. “I know. I told my dad what happened, don’t worry. And I’ll tell them the truth now. I just wonder…who would’ve told them such a lie?” he says.
“W-What?” Their father says quietly. “What kind of advances?”
“The train’s wards were not breached. Miss Travers’s compartment did not display anyone else’s magic, but her own, as didn’t her body in the post-mortem-scan that was performed a day after her death,” Harry says, feeling weary, feeling… disappointed after realising how easily Travers’s death could’ve been prevented. After all, the evidence to that small little detail still pulses nastily on the back of Harry’s head, obscured by a basic concealing charm.
Harry closes his eyes and lets out a long breath. He thinks about the previous night in the compartment. He thinks about drinking the potions, remembers the feeling of lightness surrounding him. He remembers the darkness, the emptiness and the blood, he remembers Draco’s face: horrified, panicked, looming over him in the compartment. He remembers waking up in the hospital wing some hours after it had happened.
There’s a short silence, before Harry speaks, “Aurors Peele, Prone, Higgins, Bletchley, Walter, Parkinson, Bones and Smith will be stationed in the school during the night, patrolling the common rooms and corridors.”
what I was thinking after I learned what you had been doing
“– Night,” Zachary says quietly as he hops into his own bed, opposite to Albus’s.
Draco watches Potter for a moment, thinking back at Scorpius’s questioning, and the way his son spoke about the incident between him and Travers. “No,” he says, his eyes fixed at Potter’s fingers that are wrapped around the bottle.
“No.”
She steps into the lift when the doors open. “Please…try to get along,” She says with a small grimace, and before Harry can ask her what the bloody hell she is talking about, the lift’s doors close and she is on her way back to the Minister’s office.
“I…took something,” James mutters, stretching out his hand, clutching a
know it had been important, but, as her friend’s sister – Pamela Scott – had asked both her sister and Westen not to say anything about it, claiming Albus would’ve been in trouble, Westen had promised to not say anything about it.
Zachary gives him a meaningful look. “McGonagall informed the school about Travers,” he says blankly. “She said that everyone who saw Travers during the train ride, should come forth for questioning.”
“Dad?” Albus presses on, his green eyes expectant.
he can’t think of that right now!
“W-What?” Ginny whispers, and Harry knows even without looking, what Ginny thinks.
The Ravenclaw tower is closest to the dungeons, at least with the shortcut Harry knows exists one floor up, behind the tapestry with the dancing monks. He walks in silence again, thinking of apparating to London and back to retrieve the Marauder’s Map, since it could provide the Aurors at school some help; they could monitor the students more easily with it, and see if someone moves in the castle at night.
How they had stumbled into the bathroom some time later, is still beyond Draco’s grasp. He doesn’t remember much of the night, but he remembers that. He remembers the intensity of that tragically bright green gaze and the concern in Potter’s eyes, that quickly turned into something else. It was need. It was urgency. It was hunger. He remembers Potter’s fingers pressing against his shoulder, his lips crashing against Draco’s, greedily taking what they wanted. He remembers Potter pushing Draco against the door, keeping him in place, his hand against Draco’s jaw the other one bruising his hip, and Potter’s leg between his.
Albus chews the corner of his mouth, glancing around him. “Yeah, fine. Let’s go somewhere private,” he mutters, and then walks with her to the nearest classroom. He definitely doesn’t want to be seen with her.
“When you talked to her in the corridor, you mean?”
Harry is relieved, but at the same time, puzzled and distressed regarding James. What was his son thinking? James is happily together with Charlotte, soon to be engaged, if Harry has understood correctly. James is also soon to be picked into one of the teams in the Quidditch league, where, Harry thinks with regret, being gay would definitely not be tolerated. James could lose the contract if it would come into public knowledge that he’s seeing men. Harry is grateful, however, that his eldest has a strong alibi, and that James’s questioning under Veritaserum had gone as Harry had both hoped and expected – since it seems that James would have had the best motive of all the students they have questioned.
He spends a good ten minutes carefully inspecting the girl – a sixth year Hufflepuff, he was told. He notices the way she is positioned; in an odd angle on the floor, slightly curled into herself. Next to her is a bench that has a wooden edge streaked with blood. Aside from the obvious cause of her severe head injury – the one from which the pool of blood surrounding the girl is originated – there’s a thick book behind her, lying on the floor. His eyes flicker to one of its corners that is facing the ceiling and not in contact with the blood on the floor – that too is darkened with blood.
Moonstone opens his mouth but before he can say anything else, Harry continues, “Quinn will continue with the rest of the Hufflepuff Prefects and the Head Boy. I have to check on the kids and then I’ll meet my Crime Scene Investigator in the village.”
Harry gives the parents a moment to collect themselves before he continues, explaining that he didn’t find any traces of magic of anyone else except their daughter’s in the compartment.
Their lunch break is silent; both Quinn and Smith know to leave Harry to his own devices. Harry steps outside of the classroom after forcing down a couple of forkfuls of shepherd’s pie, and sees Ron pacing along the hall, nervously biting his fingernails.
“Mr Riley,” Harry says kindly, taking note of the ghostly pale and frightened expression on the student’s face. “Take a seat,” he says and gestures at the seating area with three armchairs, two facing one.
Decided to put the last two chapters together, so there's only 1 chapter after this :'(.
Moonstone gives the bloke a small smile. “Thank you for that, Mr Riley,” he says, before lifting a brow at Harry. “Would you like to ask anything else?” Moonstone asks from Harry, evidently meaning for Harry to speed the fuck up, since Riley starts to look rather worn out by the questioning.
“I wish to be present when this questioning occurs,” Draco says stiffly.
“Thank you, sir,” Peele says modestly.
Albus tries to question Scorpius, to make him tell Albus how his questioning went, but Scorpius shrugs him off, simply telling him that nothing particularly interesting came up. Albus has a feeling that his friend hasn’t told him everything there is to tell.
“Malfoy.” Albus’s mother says coldly, her eyes at Scorpius’s father, who trails behind his son.
Quinn schools his features and clears his throat. “We would like to know more about the party that took place in your home, on New Year’s Eve,” he tells James, and Harry is bloody relieved he had the time to speak to Ginny about that little bit of information, as he practically feels her bristling on James’s other side.
Ginny gasps, and Harry too stares at his son in shock.
McGonagall looks at Harry with a steady look. “Yes, I understand. Do you really think one of them did it?”
But Scott seems to understand it wrongly. Very,
her scream covering whatever Albus had answered.
Ginny looks outraged. “I was
“Yes.” Draco grunts, and with a curt nod, Potter walks up the rest of the stairs, dragging Draco with him by his hand.
“No, I don’t!” Their father yells. “So, tell me, and I might even understand you, Albus!” He says desperately.
For once, he can’t read Scorpius. For once, Albus doesn’t outright
“Why is Scorpius going to be questioned?” Albus asks instead of replying.
seen Travers and one of them is a friend of Travers’s boyfriend, it seems. The prefect in question had been with Travers’s boyfriend almost the entire hour before the train had reached Hogsmeade.
Albus wonders who the hell had told the Aurors that it was
Potter finishes the update of the situation, at times murmuring to Granger quiet enough so that Draco doesn’t actually hear what they say.
“They’re gonna be all right, Harry,” Ron murmurs, as they pull away from each other. “It’s
But who was it? Someone who hates Scorpius? Albus doesn’t think there are students – or Prefects – who’d hate Scorpius, since Scorpius doesn’t really ruffle anyone’s feathers as he rarely even talks to people other than Albus and their dorm mates. Albus doesn’t think anyone would want to harm Scorpius and downright
James starts by telling how he had agreed to spend the night with some of his friends, and how it then somewhat expanded into a party when his friends brought their friends, and Albus had invited his friends. He tells how one of his classmates took Muggle Studies with Travers, and how Travers had been disliked by many of his friends. How she had been disliked by James as well, after she had messed around with his brother.
His father gives him a nod. “She will. Now, I want to talk to both of you before you go to breakfast,” he says seriously. “Come on,” he adds, walking along the corridor, and stepping into the nearest class room – Muggle Studies, Albus thinks, but is not sure since he’s not taking the subject – and throwing some charms against the door after both James and Albus have walked inside.
“Erm, yes. As you know, I’ve worked there for a few years now to help out George with the new addition to the business…” He snatched the toy from Malfoy’s pale hands, ignoring his inner thoughts comparing the length of his long fingers to the toy itself.
Harry blinked twice and looked at Luna as she stared him down in her usual thoughtful way, almost as if she could look straight into his soul with those wide eyes of hers. He honestly wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what she was actively doing.
“Oi! Is this that bloody karaoke bar you keep talking non-stop about?” Dean yelled to Seamus over the crowd’s noise, who was looking entirely too smug for his liking.
The letter in question had been haphazardly dropped on his dining room table by a tawny owl in the middle of breakfast one bright Sunday morning, with nothing written on the black envelope.
The fleshlight seemed to mold even further, tighter around his cock, and Harry gasped as it began stimulating his sensitive skin right away.
Yet, never knowing when to quit while he was ahead, Draco leaned forward once again in his seat, ears trained on Potter in front of him.
He just has yet to find out how to do that.
No relation to that either mind you.
“No need to look so put-out, Potter. You didn’t let me choose earlier when I was going to come during class, so I don’t believe you deserve that privilege either.”
But Draco had to remind himself that he was invited, after all.
After what seemed like ages, Malfoy slowly turned towards the shower stall, facing Harry in the same movement, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
Draco leaned down again, caressing Harry’s face with his other hand, “Turn around on your stomach for me, love.”
“Have you still not learned how to properly walk without running into things, Potter?” Malfoy asked, clearly unimpressed, his eyes never leaving the cauldron in front of him as he stirred the potion delicately.
The idea of doing the same now tastes less sweet and much more bitter and nasty. Harry was too tired from last year; the emotions were flying high, and still are to an extent.
Malfoy himself took that as a cue to leave, only to come back seconds later with a clean, fluffy towel, which Harry graciously took from him with a nod.
Draco blinked the wind from his eyes as he eyed Harry, pretending to rub some snow from his eye. “Well, here I am looking. What would you like from me now
Harry sucked in a breath. “Yeah, don’t remind me. Can I go now?”
“Later, I will explain to you proper BDSM protocols, but for now, all I want you to do for the remainder of the night is to say your pathetic ex’s name anytime you want me to stop. Does that sounds reasonable?”
He chalked it all up due to him being gay and all of that.
Malfoy looked up, unconcerned as Harry finished his coughing fit. “I would much rather you wait until after our study sessions are complete before dying on me, Potter. I’d hate to have your death on my record.”
Harry had a feeling it wasn’t going to be work-friendly, that’s for certain.
Then again, maybe Ron was right, and he was barmy for letting this go on for as long as it has.
Since the War ended last year, a slow integration with the Muggle world had started trickling through; even some of their past classmates had elected to live in the Muggle world rather than coming back to Hogwarts for their final year.
"Slytherin green." Malfoy smirked, before tracing the plug down Harry's body, toying with his nipples and Harry whined at the feeling. The plug still felt cool to the touch even though it was just in his mouth, his nipples hardening instantly at the feeling.
"Well, it must hate Christmas then. You should see the mangled wreath on my door and let's not even mention what happened to the garland."
Seamus still hadn’t shut up about that first night when they saw him months ago. Harry had to threaten to hex his bollocks off on the way over when Seamus kept asking everyone to sit at the table closest to the stage.
touch, even though he felt as though his legs had been
It all suddenly came together in Harry’s mind, Hermione’s earlier explanation and Luna’s description of what was happening. And he truly wanted the ground to swallow him whole at that moment.
!” Seamus drunkenly whispered loudly, as the sounds around the bar went down a couple of notches, awaiting whatever horrible sound was going to emit from the man’s throat above them.
A few seconds passed after that, and a thought occurred to Harry, and he knew he had to get it out before it completely ate away at whatever sanity he had left at this point.
Draco’s eyes widened for a split second before taking the offered hand.
He had managed to get Hermione to help with researching for a bit, to Ron’s exasperation, investigating as much as she could on the name. At one point, Hermione had a look of pure exasperation on her face as she sat across from him.
Harry’s body wholly melted into the bedding, not caring in the slightest about the mess he made on himself and Malfoy, his breathless whimpers cutting into the blond’s own rough panting.
“Hexes. And jinxes. Bad ones.”
Oh. Right. I'd forgotten that Luna was held prisoner there.
“Nothing. Let’s watch the movie.” He turned away and kept his eyes firmly on the screen until he was sure Potter’s gaze had moved away.
“How can I be dumb and a nerd?”
"Hey, I don't think I caught your name." Ron said.
“You think Pansy”s into Greg?”
“Yes.” Draco replied simply.
"Don't beat yourself up about it, you were kind of terrible at it anyway."
Next stop: Dress robes.
It was Potter.
Draco nearly answered, but remembered that it was only a letter. His fists clenched tighter.
“BECAUSE WE’LL NEVER BE WRONG TOGETHER - We can take to the end of the night! Because your love is like a shadow on me all of the time!” They sang out dramatically in unison.
“Nah, I’ll be fine. This way the reveal with be even better! No shoo while I work my magic!” She yelled at Octavia and she grinned.
"Huh?"
They both told him off before being hushed by Pince.
“Wouldn’t that mean it’s faulty?”
"Ah, no, I don't believe it... I've lost my wand!" Potter shrieked. Draco spun round.
He might find Potter’s heroics entertaining and exciting to hear about.
"I know." Terry responded promptly. Draco was thrown off for a second.
"So, what do you think about the tournament?" Vince asked the group as they walked.
“Yeah-NO. You aren’t drinking. You’re 11. Go be with your friends.” She scowled up at him.
And the game was on!
“You might be the type if I play my cards right. I'll find out by the end of the night.” He winked, causing the audience to squeal a bit.
After I put on all my clothes, I looked back into the foggy mirror. Wow. Huh? Um...
Draco could faintly hear the Weasel and Granger talking one cart over and remembered something he promised himself he'd do. He sighed loudly and said "I'll be back, I just have to say something to Potter." At that the entire group groaned in unison.
“Oh, obsessive am I? To want my friend to feel good in a relationship-“
Where you ought to be.
"I am Meredith Stewart, and  will be your prefect this year. You will follow me up to the Ravenclaw tower where your luggage will be. You will be separated into girls and boys, and will get to pick out your dorms if you are friends with anyone. And let this be a warning, if you can't sort this out between yourselves I will get you a dormitory plan and no one will get to be in a dorm with their new friends! Got it?" She gave them all  look. It was a rather frightening look. At the students' collective nods, she smiled brightly again. "Great! Now let this be known that we are all a family in Ravenclaw, and we treat each other with respect. I don't care if she pulled your pigtails or he threw your book, save the animosity for being better than the other houses, and getting the house cup!" Some of the first years smiled at this. "Now follow me, and watch your steps on the staircases!" She turned around and all 15 students followed in her trail.
“But I just thought I could have a bit of freedom-“
“I apologise Zabini, but I have already accepted another heart, you’re too late!” Pansy rejects, equalling dramatic. Draco was caught in the middle of them.
"Oh go fuck yourself, Malfoy!" Weasley called.
Draco looked like he was thinking for a second, before spinning round and kicking Sirius in the nose. Sirius growled at the stupidity and determination from this stupid fucking twenty year old who didn’t know when to fucking back down.
"What?"
“Please don’t Auntie.” He begged quietly, wand tightening in his grasp so much it dug into the skin slightly. “Please don’t curse me-“ he was cut off by an harsh slap to the face. Aunt Bella was standing over him with a new crazy in her eyes.
"Ugh, fiiiiiiine fine fine, I won't prank him. Let's go to dinner." Anthony gave in disappointedly.
“Well I wish you luck with that. I’m sure you have a good chance of being picked.”
“Well don’t let him destroy your hair, it looks nice as it is.” Draco went on his tip toes to pat Blaise on the head. “No go have a shower and get dressed, you look filthy.”
They’d met a nervous Danny twiddling his thumbs outside of the dorms, dressed as what she guessed was a pirate. He’d waved when he saw them.
The return of Malfoy and what's been going on with him since the trial.
“If that’s his first name then yeah.”
"What the fuck?!"
He does the same steps as before, only flying a bit higher. He releases one arm and leg and floats for a couple of second. Those couple of seconds feel incredible. He can see
On top of that, classes were getting a bit more intense, and as well as his workload, he had at least half of Greg, Vince and Pansy’s.  Thank Merlin Blaise could handle his workload. He loved those three, but they were terrible procrastinators and had an absolute shit work ethic. And because of his brotherly needs, he was practicing magic and tutoring Octavia as well. She claimed she “didn’t need his help” and that he should “get some sleep” but that was humble poppycock.
“Uh, hey Octi, me and Theo were just um-“
He looked down at her as if she the most perfect being in the world. To him she was.
I walk to the door to walk down as well with Narcissa walking beside me.
Elara jumps up and pulls me into a tight hug ''We have to go out again sometime'' she says hugging me tighter then pulling away and placing her hands on my cheeks ''I've missed my girl'' she smiles and I chuckle at her.
''Says the one caressing my hand'' he says with that smug look on his face.
''Has he been talking to you?'' she asks with eyes full of hope and a happy smile which I don't think I've actually seen her perform before now.
I should have known he didn't actually care when he didn't even bother kissing me. I was just an outlet for his anger, his frustration as he said. He did tell me. So why do I feel so let down? So incredibly angry at him? I was nothing but a body for him to use.
He shuts his door and leans against it looking over at me ''You go from timid to rude real quick. Has anyone told you that?'' he frowns as I begin to change his bed sheets.
''Then why? What's so bad about me?'' I let out an awkward chuckle trying to lighten the mood, but inside my stomach feels sick at myself.
''I'll just come in then yeah?-''
''You said yesterday-''
''Louder-''
What the fuck am I even thinking right now? Read to her? Why would I want to read to the girl? How moronic.
''It's only 7, I'm sure you'll get there'' she smirks looking at me deeply before sighing and standing up straight ''Come in'' she suddenly says making my eyes widen at her ''Wellllll, are you coming in or not?'' she smiles kindly.
''I visited my friends'' I manage to breathe out through the tingles I'm getting right now.
''Killing'' he says back.
He hated himself for even looking at her in that way. He'd only found out a week ago that she was a half-blood, which was nothing but absolute filth to him. He was disgusted in himself for even touching her in the way he had done just moments ago.
''Just kissed''
Narcissa stands slowly from her chair and turns to look at me.
''Shit, forgot about that'' I mutter looking back at the tear on the hem on the bottom.
I button up my shirt and trousers and walk back over to her not being able to resist the urge to look back over her body, feeling myself get hard again.
His nose brushes mine coming closer to my lips with his.
I feel him stand behind me and pick my dress up revealing my ass for him.
I twist her back around and grab under her ass to pick her up, her legs wrapping around me and hands rested on my shoulders as I press her against the wall and shove my cock back into her, fucking her up the tiles furiously.
''You're'' he pauses and shakes his head down at me making me frown ''Incredible'' he breathes out.
''What's wrong baby?'' he whispered coming forward to kiss her on her neck again, all the way to the top of her ear ''Tell me what you want'' he whispered, her eyes flickering shut at the sound of his husky voice in her ear.
I arrived to the Malfoy Manor the next day right on time, being sure not to disappoint, at least not straight away. The gatekeeper let me in and told me to walk straight through and await them in the dining room which made me feel a little scared if I'm being honest. Walking into a strangers home without them actually letting you in themselves did feel strange.
''See you later princess'' he smiled only making her smile more then turning back to Narcissa to give her a small smile before turning his feet to walk back up the trail to the front gates.
''Where are you going?-''
''Red lace''
He grabs my leg lifting it over his shoulder giving him more access to fuck right up into me as I moan through the pleasure.
''Good pay too'' she said glaring her eyes over the words ''Really good pay and, it says here it's a live-in job''
''No-''
He smirks down to the table then back up to look in front of him.
''No, I would not'' I almost shout at him making him smirk at me.
''Just one more'' he whispers stroking a hair behind my ear and I nod at him with a small sniffle which he smiles proudly at, as if the sight of me crying in front of him right now was something he was extremely proud of.
He lets go of me quickly when the library door opens making me walk to the other side of the room as if I had been looking at the books on the shelf the whole time; to which we both knew was utter bullshit.
He looks down at my hand which is placed in front of his pleading for him to place his on mine.
I grab each side of the seat of my chair clenching my hands around the wood to make sure I don't scream when he begins thrusting his fingers in and out of me violently under the table.
If he's really propositioning this, then I may as well. I get two benefits in one.
''Why are you calling me anyway?'' I ask him, jumping onto the desk to sit down and play with the hem of my dress.
''My lady'' he playfully said in his poshest accent as she took them out of his hand.
''Love you dick head'' I smirk back seeing how he lets out a breathily chuckle before I leave the block of flats and get into a car to get back to the manor.
''No no I can do that. Thank you so much'' I rushed out at her as she walked around the table to stand in front of me.
''You going to disown me, father?'' Draco asks as his fathers eyes turn red.
''What now?'' I ask and he smirks back at me.
''Because?'' I ask and she licks her lips at me.
''Six what-''
Anything.
''Whose is what Malfoy?'' I sigh and I feel him lean forward in the chair and place his finger tips around a strand of my hair playing with it between his fingers.
''You better fucking come here still from time to time or i'll disown you'' he smirks into my neck as I let out a chuckle.
I almost scream at the force his fingers fuck me at but he clasps his other hand around my mouth before I can.
He's vile, a nasty, vile, ignorant asshole with no care for anyone but himself.
''I understand-''
But I could do with some air.
''Malfoy'' I breathe out before letting out a small moan when he begins to kiss down my neck and closing my eyes.
I didn't know why I felt the need to come in here and check on him, but something made me compelled to do so.
''Of course'' I whisper before he pulls his head out of my shoulder to look at me and place his hands on each side of my arms brushing them down comfortingly.
He was mysterious and never seemed to talk to anyone. He just sat there and minded his own business. He would barely speak to his mother other than to shout at her, which I found not the best to hear.
''Remember how I said one of my mates was involved in the whole death eater thing?'' he asked and she nodded slowly back at him ''Well. Draco Malfoy was his name, so''
''Shhh'' he hushes me placing his finger on my lips which he then lets drop slowly to my collar bone making my breath hitch, his head leaning froward to whisper harshly in my ear through so much hatred ''You talk to me again without being spoken to first, I will place a knife against your throat and let the blood pour to the floor along with your lifeless body''.
Her legs begin to shake almost unwrapping themselves from my waist as I fuck her harder, her head coming forward to drop into my shoulder and bite down on my skin which I smile at, enjoying the pleasurable pain of it.
''Yes mother!'' he shouted back down the stairs, his eyes still stuck on Juliet's as his chest rose and fell then shaking his head to the side to look away from her quickly feeling like an idiot for even touching her.
''Darling, even if you did take the money I offered you, I really wouldn't have thought anything bad of you'' he says unbothered with a humoured smile ''I would have taken it'' he smirks and I shake my head at him with a smile finding my lips.
My hand comes down to grab the back of his hair but he slaps it away and presses my wrist into the bed in a harsh hold, his veins prominent in his hands and knuckles a pale, flushed red as he clenches his hand around my wrist.
''That's funny. I've been working here quite a few weeks now and I recall dusting that painting quite a few times. I believe it's been there ever since I first came here'' I smirk up at him causing him to shake his head with a frown back down at me.
''No, I need words not actions'' he sighs awaiting me to respond for him to continue.
He's striking.
''5 minutes'' she smirked making his lips curl up as he walked towards her, taking in her whole figure bit by bit ''and then I have to apply for this job'' she made clear as he towered over her placing his hands on her waist licking his lips down at her.
''Oh stop it you stupid girl'' he shakes his head with knitted brows.
''Malfoy'' he says sternly looking up at me ''You call me Malfoy Darling. You're not privileged enough to use my name'' he smirks then lowering himself back to my clit and placing a kiss there making my legs hips jolt.
''Were you never taught etiquette?'' He frowns and I feel my temperature rising at him ''You lack modesty. You don't care to avoid impropriety, do you?'' He asks looking deeply at me.
''I fucking love your tits'' he bites his lip as he chases his high, fucking me more and more vigorously into his silk sheets.
''Bitch'' he hisses before kicking his chair back with his foot and walking upstairs leaving me stunned.
''I mean-'' I place my hands on her skirt, dragging it down her legs and off her and doing the same with her panties before lifting myself back up in front of her ''what do you want me to do for you?'' I whisper placing my hands behind her back to unclasp her bra,
I line my cock with her entrance and slam myself into her, a scream coming from her mouth making me smirk devilishly down at her and pull her by the hair as I start violently thrusting into her pussy.
''How about I sit here for a few more minutes until you've fully woken up? Then you can fill the holes in your lies a little bit better''
''Now, you're going to be a good little girl for me and never do that again, yes?'' he says suddenly stopping his hand still in my panties making me turn my head to him as he looks at me with tensed jaw and a stern, threatening face.
''Just get out'' he snaps, his eyes flashing to look at mine full of anger and vexation, turning back to that stone cold, grey shade.
Theo did say to get some fresh air and who says I have to speak to the boy.
''You want me to talk?'' he asks in a hushed tone, his fingers still tracing along my skin gently making me throb.
''I don't know'' I breath out, his hand still lingering on my hair.
''Is what a hobby of mine?-''
''I think you like my mood swings'' he smirks dragging his hand back up my thigh but I place mine on top of his to stop him going any further ''Don't you want to go again?-''
''These fucking curves'' he shook his head closing his eyes before snapping them over again onto my figure, his hand then tracing to my panties and stroking over the front of my clothed clit ''Like a fucking goddess'' he mumbles under his breath making my heart flutter.
''No, we're just friends'' I say, humoured that she'd think me and Theo were together after so many years of us being friends.
I lift her up off the bed as her arms dangle around me and I carry her to the en-suite.
''Fuck Malfoy'' I moan and he smirks down at me, clenching his hand now around my leg above his shoulder.
His hand then reaches down to grab my hands and pull them apart gently.
''Hmm, not really'' she says before looking down at me with a smile ''your face is nice though''
I'm sure I could hear a small cry echo through the walls.
''I thought Juliet didn't have a Romeo?'' he smirks at me with squinted eyes.
''I hope you're not saying I have sweaty hands Malfoy'' I smile up at him with a squint to my eyes.
He walked up the stairs gesturing me to follow him and I did, every step I took behind him watching the back of his figure.
''Are you just going to stare at me?'' I ask while polishing over his desk being careful not to move anything out of place.
The final hit. A moan coming from my mouth as I only drip more in my panties from arousal. My panties are so soaked that I was beginning to wonder whether I'd just came from just him spanking me.
I walk over to his desk and sit down ''Of course. Only because you're being less of a dick today'' I smirk picking up the quill on his desk as he towers over the back of the chair looking down at me as I grab the parchment in front of me and I await for him to tell me what to write.
''I think it smells nice. Don't you?'' I rase my brow at him before turning back around to look in front of me.
A tear trickles down my cheek which makes him come forward quickly and brush it away for me ''I'm sorry, fuck I didn't mean to make you cry-''
I can't help but fight back a smile at this idiot.
Possibly that he said something at the dinner table without screaming and shouting or scowling at everyone in his sights. She smiles, obviously thinking he was being kind by his previous sentence.
''You didn't know me?'' he turns his body more to face me with a confused look on his face ''Me. You didn't know me, Draco Malfoy?-''
''I can just imagine you in it'' he almost whispers through the phone.
''You need to keep that imagination of yours under control darling'' I snap back with a sneer as I notice her wrap her arms around her body timidly causing me to relax into a frown ''I can't be doing this with you'' I say calmly.
''Maybe you should be a gentleman and help me'' she says and I swirl my tongue on the inside of my cheek just looking at her and hearing that silky, smooth voice that's enough to lure you in.
''Well, goodnight then'' I say with a smile and she smiles back up at me.
''How so?''
''I will not be spoken to like that by an ignorant little prick'' she snapped making him chuckle darkly at her before snapping his neck slowly side to side as if he was tense and needed to calm himself down.
''Cramp, in my hand'' he says still rubbing his one hand with the other ''And I really need to write a letter''
''That's a little different'' he tilts his head down to look at his hands.
''I don't have to make you feel good, nor do I care if you do or don't'' he whispers harshly to me ''So do as I say, and I'll give you your ounce of pleasure back. I'm a gentlemen like that'' he says smirking down at me with a tilt to his head as his thumb grazes across my lip.
''Yes''
_______________
She's unbelievably annoying. Extremely infuriating.
He towered back over her, pulling his cock out of his boxers to line with her entrance teasing her with his tip until he slowly pressed it into her allowing him to come back forward to her lips and motion them back on hers to surpress her moan.
He then takes his hand away from me and pushes his chair out making me look up at him in confusion before he kneels down with a smirk.
I pick up the whisky and walk to where Draco is sitting ''Whisky?'' I ask him quietly making sure not to interrupt the conversation between his mother and the person who seems to be his girlfriend.
Then suddenly he whips his black, leather belt across my ass causing my knees to buckle and for me to scream in pain to the point he has to grab me and pick me back up to take my previous position against the wall.
''I better get ready'' I say and he nods back at me.
I don't understand what I'm even doing or why I'm doing it, but I would really love to just feel his skin right now on mine.
He places his finger to his lip with a hushed chuckle and I chuckle back at this sudden burst of silliness he has before he gets under the table and in front of my legs, yanking them apart causing me to suck in a breath.
I then saw Narcissa walk out of the living room and flee for the front door, grabbing her coat and slamming it shut.
He pushed himself in bit by bit until he finally pressed all of himself in me with a shaky breath out as he did so.
''Draco listen to your father'' Narcissa says pleadingly beside him and he shakes his head with a breathily laugh and a smirk.
''That's it, take my cock you little bitch'' he hisses at me tightening his hand more around my throat causing me to almost choke when I moan at the feeling of his tip hitting my G-spot over and over again, feeling like I'm about to cum all over again.
''We're not 10 mother'' Draco scoffs turning his head away from her as she walks over to him and leans down to press a kiss on his forehead which he scrunches his nose at.
I was starting to wonder whether the happy, smiley expression she held was really true at this point. It seemed far too forced.
The fact that they aren't here anymore.
He pulls me forward slowly so I'm sitting on top of him, both of my legs straddling his as he wraps his arms around me burying his head in my shoulder and placing a kiss on my shoulder.
''Mmm'' he hums back tiredly before lifting himself from the floor and placing the needle back in his draw ''Done''
''Thank you''
It's like he's toying with me every chance that he has.
His hand trails behind my back to unclasp my bra and throw it onto the floor.
''Because I like it when you're all feisty. I've noticed just how fierce you are over the last few weeks'' he smirks walking with his hands in his pockets which I can't help but find incredibly attractive.
''Here's the pervert-''
''Fuck''
''I'm really really very sorry for my son'' she says with a sad look on her face.
''The gift he got you'' I say with a humorous smile finding my lips.
''No'' she said firmly to him.
She smirks back at me walking closer to me to place her hands on my thighs and clean over with her face right near mine. My eyes glance down at her cleavage making me instantly hard before looking back at her face and into those big, blue eyes that are gracious and glistening.
''Oh, would you like me to write it for you?'' I ask coming closer to him fiddling with my hands at the front of my figure.
She walked towards him placing her hand on his chest which he turned his head to the side at with a disgusted face.
She sighed as she felt his eyes burn onto her back, having to place her foot on the bottom shelf to lift herself a little higher as the boy behind her simply enjoyed the view with a snicker escaping his lips.
Yeah, I should check on her.
''Oh, ok. Goodnight then-''
He sucks on his bottom lip for a moment as if he's thinking hard about something.
''Yeah'' he says making me shake my head at him ''Am I not aloud to stare at you?''
He's big.
''Four and a quarter'' I say and he nods down at me biting the inside of his cheek.
He stands from his chair and comes behind it ''It would be much appreciated if you could'' he says gesturing his hand for me to sit down at his desk.
She then swings her arms around my neck pulling me closer to her.
I feel him nod beside me.
''Please sit down lovely, there is really no need to stand before me'' the woman said and I simply nodded with a smile before seating myself back down in her chair. A lump arose in my throat, not knowing what to say at all in front of this woman.
It'd been a couple of weeks I'd worked here now and the time passed by. I was getting more used to the job day by day. Narcissa was extremely nice to me, as for Lucius, he wasn't really ever around much and I don't believe we had even talked.
I hear the library door open and glance behind my shoulder to see Draco walking in dropping the books that I held in my hand onto the floor which he sighs at and walks over to the bookshelf to grab a book as I begin to pick back up the ones I had dropped while looking at his irritating face.
''Not many'' he answers rather quietly ''Not anymore''
I turn around slowly in front of him as he bends down to level with the bottom of my dress, his fingers picking up the bottom piece which is torn between his fingers.
''We've missed our girl'' Theo corrects her with a smile coming up to me and hugging me soon after ''I've really missed you'' he whispers then pulling away from me.
I stand up from my seat and so does Draco making me turn to him and cross my arms.
Just because you're handsome doesn't make you a nice person.
''The bed Juliet'' he hisses harshly at me making me nod and walk over to the bed and sit down on it hesitantly.
''I really don't understand you'' I whisper to him looking in front of me instead of his face for fear I may stare at him forever.
I hear him chuckle from his door and look over to see him looking at the floor with a smile and his hands behind him as he leans against the door to probably keep himself from falling asleep standing up.
Tears stream down my face as my body is shaking uncontrollably.
''What?-''
''She's gone out for the day anyway'' he almost whispers softly to me.
With every move I make around his room I feel his eyes burning holes into the back of me.
''Why you sitting down there?-''
''I don't recall you having a degree in clinical psychology, because that's certainly not what you're here for'' he says not tilting his head to look back at me ''I believe your shift is finished''
Just think of something to say.
''Juliet could you grab the other bottle please'' Narcissa calls out to me making me snap out my thought.
I fuck her harder, rougher and faster than I have done before against the shower tiles ''Bratty little bitch'' I hiss.
''Hm?'' he squints down at me confused at my question.
''I admire that dress you're wearing'' he suddenly says catching me off guard and making me turn to him again ''and the tear in the back of it'' he says with a smile.
He turned around opening the top cupboard where the mugs were ''Coffee?''
JULIET POV
''Fine, I'll be back in a minute with your milk'' I say before stepping away from the door to walk away until I notice it swing open from behind me making me turn back around on my feet to look at him in the doorway.
''So so bloody tired'' Elara sighed closing her eyes as Juliet and Theo looked at each other with annoyed faces at the girl now laying on her lap.
''Lucius stop please-''
''It's ok Narcissa. I understand. He doesn't want to be a part of the family anymore, that's fine with me-''
''Just, well, a friend'' I shake my head not knowing what else to say and he huffs at me and looks back down into his lap ''Do you have any friends?'' I ask kindly to him.
''You held your left hand when you said you had cramp-''
His lips curl up into an evil smile throwing me back down to lie flat on the bed and he stands up causing me to lean up on my elbows to look at him.
He smirks looking down at me devilishly, my eyes head tilting to the floor as I begin to feel intimidated by him.
''Hey'' I say to him making his head pick up to look at me with a sigh ''Smile'' I say with a smile myself and he shakes his head at me with a huff looking back down to his hand.
''Sometimes'' I simply answer and he begins to tap the desk with his finger as he stares at me ''Stop tapping''
''Really?''
''Lovely'' she smiled again ''I must inform you before you work here that he can get quite, shall we say, frustrated at times. Mostly with the world'' she rolled her eyes to the floor then looked back up at me,
He's so cold but his skin on mine just feels like something else.
This is just embarrassing now.
JULIET POV
''You roll your eyes a lot'' he says.
I really shouldn't be doing this.
I would wonder to why I'm the only maid, but it's pretty obvious considering who the Malfoy's are.
''Fuck my fingers princess'' he whispers then nibbling at my neck.
''Goodnight dick head'' she says and I let out a soft chuckle before standing up straight and walking towards the door, giving her one more quick glance before leaving.
''Quite a brat aren't you?'' He asks and I can't help but scowl up at him as he chuckles down at me ''Do you have a Romeo, Juliet?'' He says mocking down at me and I shake my head at him.
''I don't'' I mumble ''Not that it's any of your business'' I say with a roll to my eyes.
His mother stands there looking between us with a kind smile.
No answer, once again.
When we arrive upstairs she opens the door to a beautiful, large bedroom with a four poster bed. Everything was still extremely dark and dreary, even the sheets on the bed were a dark, rich purple colour. However, it was still a nice room and very pleasing to the eye.
''Take your clothes off'' he asserts me still holding my chin and looking into my eyes as if he's awaiting a response from me.
''I-'' I cut myself off not actually knowing what on earth I was going to say.
Juliet was out of her depth after leaving Hogwarts. She had left too soon, in year 5 to be exact. Therefore she never completed her studies. However, there was reason to this.
''Really?'' I ask him with crossed arms and he nods with a smirk ''You're hilarious Malfoy, you should be a comedian'' I say with a straight face before turning around and grabbing the polish to begin polishing around his room quickly.
He looked back up at her and stood up from his chair throwing his book onto the table beside him ''Are you trying to pick a fight with me, little girl?'' he scowled at her from the other side of the room ''Come here then'' he asserted her tensing his jaw.
''I'm sorry'' I breathe out just wanting him to put his hands back on me.
''Reading'' he says and I look up at him.
''Yeah, I'll have the money put into your bank tomorrow'' he says naturally as if what we did was nothing.
He opens his bedroom door making me frown at him in confusion as he steps to the side putting his hand out in a gentlemanly like fashion to let me go first.
She shuffles forward on her knees and wraps her lips around my tip lowering herself on my cock inch my inch making me tilt my head back with a moan.
''You and Elara can't support me as well as yourselves'' she mumbled taking a deep breath ''I'm going to have to either get some income for us all, or move out-''
He pulls his trousers down then his boxers, his cock springing up to rest on his stomach.
''You didn't want to with me''
''Let go for me'' he whispers, placing a kiss on my clit and thrusting me harder ''Cum in my mouth darling. Let me taste you'' he whispers with an obvious smirk before licking at my clit again.
''I wouldn't mind it'' she whispers almost into my lips and my eyes flutter closed as my hands lower down to her ass to squeeze it tightly causing her to let out a small moan.
I feel Theo's hand drop from my back making me look at him with a frown.
''Of course. That's very kind of madame'' I smile kindly as she looks back at Draco who rolls his eyes then starts to walk out the library to go down the stairs before turning around to look at me while his mother's back is to him and sucking his two fingers that I assume still had my orgasm on with a small smirk while his other hand rests in his pocket.
''Awah, that's kind of him. When did he get you that?'' I ask with a kind smile, knowing full well he's talking utter rubbish.
Please just kiss me already.
I felt bad for the women, being treated so badly by her own son with such vile words. He's lucky he even has a mother at all.
I tried to keep myself from smacking the bottle of wine over the girls stupid face, wondering how it would be to turn that red lipstick on her lips to blood instead.
I drop his hand out of mine and stand up out of the chair ''I think you're fine to write your little letter now'' I smile before walking to the door.
''Why on earth are you asking me that?''
''I think you should leave'' she smirks down at me.
He presses an extra finger into my pussy thrusting it in and out in moderate pace as his thumb flicks at my clit.
But isn't that the deal with every job out there anyway?
''Are you stuck on repeat?'' he chuckles smirking back at me and walking back over to me to pick up my clothes off the floor and put out his hand to hand them to me.
''You obey me. When I tell you to stand, you stand. When I tell you to sit, you sit'' He says and my eyes glare across the other side of the room finding his gaze nerving before he yanks my face back to look at him by my chin ''when I tell you to look at me, you look at me'' he says before smirking down at me and letting my chin go.
''No'' he shakes his head ''I just-I didn't want to''
I close my bedroom door and lean against it brushing my fingers through my hair.
''So you'll do it for free?'' He smiles with a squint to his eyes and I shake my head at him with a tut.
''Yes Mrs Malfoy-''
''I'm obviously not going to sit on your lap Malfoy'' I snap back at him closing my eyes for a moment as my only form of peace right now.
''It arrived yesterday. He's a very kind man who's been a friend of the family for years. He paints them himself'' he says rather confidently gripping the back of the chair.
''So what then? You want to shout at me? Scream at me?'' I ask getting impatient at how he's letting this drag out.
She moans loudly letting her hands rest flat against the marble tiles letting out a few curses under her breath.
''You should go inside now'' he quickly says and I stand up and look over to the car to see Astoria get out of it.
''You were going to pay me to fuck you?'' I snap at him taking a step back.
''Death Eaters don't really exist anymore though since the war. So no harm? I'm guessing'' she said as if she wasn't actually too sure, but all she could think about was the pay of this job and the good it could possibly do for beginning a new future of some kind and the chance to live in a manor out of all the places to live, surely it would be perfect.
My other hand picks up to grip my hair then slam back down in front of me, not knowing how to hold myself together in front of him as he pleasures me in this silent, dim-lit library.
''Look, babe. I know you're looking at the pay more than anything right now, but just think a little more about it. The Malfoy's aren't the most welcoming and compassionate people-''
''I'm sorry for the way I spoke down there'' I whispers, his breath warming my lips as my chest rises stupidly fast ''I'm vile''
I really couldn't understand what his deal was today. It had been a week since we had sex and now he's suddenly acting all annoyed at me without reason and keeping me hostage in an old office in his house. He hadn't even spoke to me until now after that day.
''Incredibly proud as always'' he said walking towards me and sitting on the bed while I scurried around the room finding everything I needed to throw into my case.
As soon as Draco steps into the darkened room – Potter’s room – and the moment the door closes, Potter slams him against it, pinning him to the hard wood with a tight grip on Draco’s waist.
“Hey dad,” Albus says blankly.
Harry nods. “Her, then Mr Woods, then Mr Riley,” he says, and when Neville frowns slightly, Harry adds, “Quinn will accompany the students there and back.”
Octavia scoffed. “That’s my thing. We are way too old to be doing the sibling double act. Get your own idea.”
“Pfft, okay.” He did! Every time the book turned to a sex scene he just flicked through uninterestedly until it was over and back to romance. He admittedly did love romance novels, especially the enemies to lovers trope. He adored the slow burn, but hated the characters obliviousness. Like come on! It was so obvious they have feelings for each other! Just kiss already!
"We don't anymore! Well, most don't. Some do, but they're just idiots." She looked down sadly for a moment. "And as if you're the one to talk about muggles being weird, what about you wizards? Yesterday on the train, I distinctly remember you explaining the 'blood purity' and how some people are considered 'lesser' because of not being a pureblood. Last time I checked, both of our blood was still red." She argued back.
Jeez!
A they continued, the camp site continued to take on a greener theme, until it was completely covered in green and Irish themed decorations. Octavia grimaced.
“I-I think Moody was making Draco draw the uh, the Dark Mark. With a quill and ink.” Greg replied. Draco’s scratching started to become more frantic before Pansy grabbed his hand and held it.
Draco copied Narcissa's over protectiveness, being glued to her hip for the week. He was still quite shaken from being blamed for the Dark Mark by Barty Crouch, and Octavia spotted him absentmindedly rubbing at one of his forearms often. It was due to this that she didn't tell him to leave her alone, instead letting him help her with Hogwarts packing.
Octavia speechlessly went towards the glass and tapped it softly, before sprawling both hands out on it, looking into the beautiful view. Large seaweed sprouted up from a lake bottom she couldn’t see. Fish and other creatures swam and scuttled past unknowingly, reacting infinitesimally when Octavia rapped her nails on the glass gently. She smiled in awe of the room.
“He stuttered! That’s his tell!” Blaise yelled at he exited his dorm room, Greg and Vince in tow.
"No thank you, I think I'm going to take a walk. Excuse me." Draco picked up his book and held it tightly to his chest as he exited past the trolley lady.
As soon as he was out of earshot, Pansy and Blaise turned to each other.
"The Messed Up Group."
"Oh god, a Howler. That's rough buddy." Michael said unhelpfully. 'Rough' was an understatement. "You may as well open it, it's worse if you wait." The entire Ravenclaw table seemed to have quieted down to hear the Howler. Dracpo could hear some giggled and pity from the older years.
"Why do you need a stim?" Michael asks.
“Can’t wait until I tell Hermione you’re joining the house elf liberation movement.”
"Uh, Hermione? As much as I like listening to you two talk about libraries, We kind of need to get to History of Magic in 10 minutes." Neville told the bushy haired girl.
“Well I should expect so, I brewed it.” Draco bragged slightly, pleased with the surprised look Potter gave him. Then Potter snickered.
"Are you feeling better Potter?" His voice was soft and his eyes were kind and I could hardly take him in as Malfoy, especially with the newly dyed black hair. I nodded shyly and he gave a small but calm smile. "You were yelling and thrashing in your sleep so I thought I'd better wake you up. Do you want to talk about it?" My eyes widened and I shook my head as no. "Okay, that's fine. Do you need anything else?" I shook my head again. He got up off my bed to walk toward his bed and I noticed how dark my side of the room is. Dark like tar. Dark like the cupboard.
"What's our next lesson?" Terry asked the other 4, uncurling himself.
“Let’s stay on topic Draco, I can tell you about your own prudishness after we get to the bottom of it.” He waved away Draco’s huffy scowl. “Anyway, since he isn’t embarrassed about that, it’s more about who he hung out with on the quidditch pitch. May I please call Miss Parkinson to the stand?” Pansy pushed Blaise out of the way and stared down Draco.
“Yes, that, so you cant summon him. And it’s considered very rude to just summon the dead out of nowhere! The dead who can be summoned all had pretty traumatic deaths, so I wouldn’t bother them. Purgatory is far better than you kids wanting a scare!” Greg continued to scold the kids. The girl who’d raised the board tried to hide it inconspicuously behind her back.
Octavia waved nervously at them. The mermaid waggled their fingers back. Octavia knew that she was gawking, but couldn’t seem to care. They were
"What's going on out here? I here magic!" A girl from another carriage burst into the hallway. She had dark brown skin and lighter brown hair. Her hair was bushy and seemed to be trying to get of off her head, curling around in stray locks. She had slight buck teeth and a bossy sort of voice. Draco liked her already.
Draco took this seriously for a second. “Are people really giving you that hard of a time?”
They continued to walk with the golden trio, the atmosphere very awkward and stilted. Draco was trying to pretend they didn't exist, while Octavia was interviewing them one by one. Then she got to Potter.
"Can people stop calling me that! I'm not mini! I'm the average height for my age!" She told them crossly.
thing?!”
It was their second year at Hogwarts. Pansy was far more grown up this time. And she thought Draco was too.
[][][][][] [][][][][] [][][][][]
Draco seethed. “I am not a Malfoy!” His wand pointed at the intruder. “Now tell me your name!”
"Better than being a Gryffindor with a savior complex."
He dropped his wand in front of him on instinct and put one of his hands up, the other one carrying Octavia.
He’d left it in his satchel.
And they’re not as green as a “fresh pickled toad” Weaslette! Learn how to write poetry you poor sod. Draco didn’t even need to try with an insult that day, she gave him the content right there!
"I'm a Pureblood. So is Neville." Draco nodded his head towards the other boy as he sat down.
"He was in his box in my carriage. He escaped somehow, and I already searched the entire carriage top to bottom, so I tried looking out here. Oh, he could be anywhere!" The boy said, panicked.
“You only dislike me because I’m not a house elf.” Draco said, and felt relief when his fingertips began to feel their normal weight.
They sat in silence for a couple moments.
"Do you know how to get through?" She smiled down at him understandingly.
“I am certainly not pretty!” Draco spluttered when he was greeted to a large arm being swung round his shoulder.
“I would so love if a person could steal you away from this home. You do not appreciate it properly. I know you wish to leave.” He hissed and Draco rolled his eyes.
"Hey, hey what's the matter Via?" He asked her.
Octavia flicked through the book in silence, sniffling occasionally.
“Thanks Martha. I don’t need a whole lot of help though.”
"Yeah, that's not going to work." I stared at Malfoy aghast. What had he done?! Hermione's face pinched slightly in anger.
“Glad you’re finally having fun!” Draco didn’t have a response.
"Hey Draco! I saved you a seat!" Hermione called out to him. Her and Neville were sitting next to each other on a bench near the front, each seat having a feather in front of it. The other two kids were H-Potter and Weasley. Draco blocked them from his view. He walked over to Hermione's table, the Ravenclaw boys trailing behind.
And Draco had to admit, under the influence of alcohol, Potter was a lot more tolerable. He could almost be considered funny at times.
In truth, Gale had managed to make him and Rowan the first wandless magic users, and they lived out the rest of their days in house beside the sea,  helping muggles. Secretly but happily.
"Draco. Draco Malfoy. And he's Terry." Draco pointed to the boy on the opposite bunk.
"Who's that? What are you doing in here, all alone?" Bagman asked them, squinting.
“Of course. I have just been going over transfiguration.”
"He came up to me during Herbology and asked if he could join our tutoring group. He wanted to work on his Wingardium Leviosa. He also mentioned that he didn't want to be kicked out if he wasn't good enough...can they do that? Will they kick you out of Hogwarts if you're not good enough?" Hermione asked him fearfully, her brown skin taking on a hint of green.
Then a knock at the door.
--------------------------------------------
“And are you not the ‘smoking hot’, ‘breathtaking’, ‘incredibly spicy’ and ‘kissable’ Blaise Zabini?” Draco’s fingers hurt from the overuse of quotation marks. “So are you not going to march up to Nott and get a dance with him? Are you not going to do this confidently and proudly while in that stupid red leather costume I transfigured for you?” Draco ramped up. “Are you going to do that, or are you going to deflect the issue and hide away from your problems like an emotionally constipated toddler?” Blaise snorted at that and Draco grinned.
"Yeah yeah, I'll see you later Draco!" She waved him off. He rolled his eyes and walked to Arithmancy early.
“Right, well we all got pretty plastered! It was amazing.” Blaise recovers, telling the Durmstrangs who were listening in. “I don’t know whether you’d be able to party with the Slytherins.” He taunted.
“Damn it, I forgot about the eyes. A vampire’s are supposed to be a soulless black. I wonder if there’s a charm...”
"Draco? Can we go with them?" Octavia asked him quietly. Granger still managed to hear her and turned the three around.
"Whoa!" Draco steadied himself, gripping his book tighter. "What are you doing on the floor?" He asked the crouched figure. The person jumped up alarmed, and turned to face him.
Potter glared at him, before turning away. "If that's really the case, it would be safer..."
Draco looked at Octavia and then pointed to their father, swirling a finger round next to his head to indicate craziness.
“Wait...he put the Imperius curse on him?!” Octavia shrieked in horror.
"And you say you're not the best big brother ever!"
“I think he thinks Granger’s pretty. Which is totally ridiculous in every way, and I probably read it wrong, and maybe I should go back to library-“ Octavia grabs his arm to prevent him form turning round, quickly giving the password to the entrance statue.
"No sorry." Said Draco apologetically. "It has to sizzle out before the next ingredient."
