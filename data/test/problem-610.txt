As he sat alone at the half-empty Slytherin table, Draco let his eyes wander around the Great Hall. He recognized many of his batchmates but few of his friends had returned. The others who sat at the Slytherin table were limited to Pansy, Blaise, Theo and a few others whose names he couldn’t remember. He started thinking about who he had bumped into on the train. He had been surprised to see Potter while looking for an empty carriage. He hadn’t had the energy to muster up a usual crude comment and had figured that if he kept his mouth shut, he could keep a low profile for now. The last thing he wanted was to get noticed and hence bothered by too many people. Alas, it had only been a few minutes sitting in the Great Hall and Draco could already feel the many piercing glares that felt like blades in his back.
Draco nodded frantically, supporting Harry’s claim. “Yes, I didn’t feel too good after smelling some of the herbs. Reminded me of the porridge.”
It was Hermione who responded first, but Ron’s anger became more apparent when he slammed the fork he was holding with a death-grip down onto the table, startling the students sitting beside him. Always one for dramatics, Harry thought to himself, resisting the urge to roll his eyes.
Unbeknownst to Harry, Draco was suffering from the same afflictions as him. The other boy couldn’t erase the image of his parents’ sad expressions and Voldemort’s icy glare from his mind.
“I’m sorry, I must have missed that,” she said politely, indicating that he should tell her again. Her tone, however, implied that she gathered the two must have knocked themselves on the head on the way to the infirmary.
Harry stared at both his friends. He almost saw them in a completely new light, disbelieving of the fact that they had no care at all in the face of someone so obviously injured, and so desperately wanting to have something to blame Malfoy for, even though the boy hadn’t done anything to Harry during the match.
Harry stared blankly as Ron’s face turned increasingly red. The stares the trio had attracted with their argument must have multiplied tenfold by now. The absurdity of the situation left Harry feeling helpless, his earlier anger dissipating.
“Thanks.”
It had been 122 days since the war ended. Harry had counted every single day since Voldemort died. Things in Hogwarts had changed. McGonagall was the Headmaster now and she had decided to let those affected by the war retake their classes. Seventh Year was now the Eighth Year.
“Isn’t yours like this too?”
“Hm?”
Before long, Harry dozed off, the tinny chatter of Hermione and the steady hum of the engine lulling him to sleep.
“Do you guys not care the slightest that he almost died that day? Does that mean nothing to you?” Harry all but shouted at the two. They looked up at him and Harry saw Ron’s fist clench around the fork he was holding. Good, Harry thought, satisfied that they now felt the same anger he felt.
“Hogsmeade? Now? Are you out of your mind? We have classes!” Draco protested, shocked upon hearing Harry’s suggestion.
Harry mindlessly poked his fork at his plate of mashed potatoes, idly watching Ron and Hermione feed each other. They hadn’t stopped talking to one another the whole time since Harry had joined them on the train. It was almost like Harry was completely invisible to them aside from the greetings they had offered him on the train. What about their once unbreakable bond as the legendary Golden Trio? It was more like Ron and Hermione plus Harry, he thought bitterly.
He ran off without another word, leaving Draco standing confused in the dimly lit corridor. Not that Potter noticed but Draco had actually found his hair rather adorable. It showed him just how chaotic and forgetful Potter could be and he did look far better like this, instead of having his hair plastered to his head like a common Ministry worker.
“Ah, hello my dear boy! Do take a seat.”
Malfoy didn’t budge. Harry was stunned, did his archnemesis just
Harry didn’t want Malfoy to suffer any more because of his carelessness. After all, he had more than enough on his conscience after the sacrifices so many had made for him during the War.
Draco had been the Seeker on the Slytherin team since his Second Year, and no one had challenged his position even though he had a black spot on his reputation. He might not have been the best player when he’d joined but by doing the team a favour and replacing their pathetic school brooms, he was helping them improve. They’d thank him one day. It wasn’t his fault that the Gryffindor team had acquired a Harry Potter and became impossible to beat.
Apologies for the long wait, comments are greatly appreciated!
Hermione tossed her hair over her shoulder indignantly. “Harry, I don’t understand why you’re so upset when Malfoy was the cause of this. He’s to be blamed! He doesn’t deserve any of your pity.”
He watched over him the whole day until the sun began to set. His tea had gone cold and his back was stiff from sitting in the small chair but he could put up with it for a while.
He was fortunate to have his own room. McGonagall had allowed him to have his own common room and bedroom which was nice. At least carrying the burden of being the perfect saviour came with some perks, Harry supposed. Maybe having special privileges wasn’t so bad. He had time to reflect each morning and he knew that if he slept with everyone else in the Gryffindor dorms, he would wake his roommates up with his sleep talking and pained cries.
you back down,” Harry snarled.
“Hello,” He replied, walking alongside Harry now.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he realised he was unharmed. It felt too real to him. Thank Merlin he’d been given a separate room from everyone else in the common room. Slughorn must have done so so suddenly due to Flitwick telling him about the current soul bond situation between him and Potter. Yes, the disadvantage was that he was near to that arse but it was better than humiliating himself in front of all the Slytherins. Hopefully, Potter didn’t hear him from the next room.
But that was a long time ago, and they’ve all changed immensely since, forced to grow up faster because of The War. Once, Harry would’ve confidently said that Ron and Hermione were the only people who really knew him, through and through. Harry felt a wave of sadness when he realised that they haven’t truly been close since the day they defeated Voldemort.
Hermione followed behind Ron, looking at Harry with a slight frown on her face. They must’ve followed Harry from the Quidditch pitch.
“Pinky will bring your belongings to your room.”
“Death Eater strikes again!”
“Hi.” His response was short and awkward and no one really knew what to say afterwards. They ended up sitting down and as Ron and Hermione chattered away about what they’d been up to since they last saw him, Harry could only gaze outside the window, watching the blurs of green and blue as they sped past the fields.
As Harry wiped away his sweat and tried to calm himself down, his thoughts subconsciously drifted to Draco Malfoy and his eyes that were a mixture of stormy lightning and calm cloudiness. Pretty pink lips enunciating melodious word after word. Beautiful.
They shuffled into the room awkwardly, avoiding each other like the plague. “So, what’s the matter?” Flitwick asked, glancing at the two boys who were presently shooting glares at each other in an attempt to make the other speak up first and explain the problem.
Harry grinned at that, it was nice seeing Draco happier and more relaxed. It had barely been a few weeks since their awkward encounter on the train and their friendship had really evolved since then. He also appeared much healthier and less pallid. Spending time with Harry certainly seemed to calm the effects of the soulbond.
Hermione seemed to sober up upon hearing Harry’s words, narrowing her eyes as if she was in deep thought. Ron, however, gave Harry a look of disgust and stood up abruptly.
Not everyone returned for the Eighth Year, however, and Harry only recognized a few of his batchmates. He had agreed to return because he felt that it was the only place he had ever truly belonged, and staying at Grimmauld Place had only forced painful memories of Sirius to resurface in his mind.
Harry scoffed, rolling his eyes, “Your opinion counts for nothing, you’re a sleazy little scumbag!”
Harry paused to lean on a wall outside the Great Hall, catching his breath and trying to regain some of his calm. He’d go to the bathroom in a minute, just in case anyone had decided to follow him out.
“It’s alright, as cheesy as it sounds, all you two can do now is work together to solve this problem.”
Draco looked like his usual composed self again. If Harry hadn’t been there, he would never have guessed that Draco had had such a close brush with death mere days ago.
, heroic saviour of the Wizarding World, selfless and perfect, idolised by the masses. It would be ridiculous for him to even think about settling for Draco, a boy who couldn’t move on from the past when everyone else had, a boy so broken he was constantly a minute away from breaking down.
Draco quickly shut that window of thought. He was not going to let himself go there right now.
Draco felt like Harry had just stabbed him in the heart with that statement. A Death Eater? No, he could not believe Harry had just called him that, no. No, no, no, he did not want to believe Harry had said that to him. It was just too gut-wrenching.
The crowd booed when he said Draco’s name and he rolled his eyes, unperturbed by it. He wiped the sweat off his brow, clutching his head when it throbbed. It was getting worse but he wasn’t about to make everyone hate him more by quitting the game. He had to push on.
“Malfoy? What the hell are you doing here?” He screeched, pushing his glasses up and frowning at him. No one was usually lurking in this corridor, especially since he was the only occupant in the hidden dorms. As far as he knew, there were only two rooms and he occupied one of them, meaning Malfoy was either stalking him or stalking him. There was no other option.
The plump man chattered, unaware that the two boys weren’t fully listening to him. Harry stifled a snort, nodding while Draco blushed furiously. The other boy was not used to this attention, it had been far too long since a professor had taken an interest in him. Merlin, it was humiliating to see that so many teachers knew about their predicament.
“Harry, boy, you said that you were the only one who could hear Mr Malfoy when he spoke about his symptoms?” Flitwick frowned as he summoned a dusty book from one of his shelves.
“I can’t bloody say it, Potter! Remember what happened with Madam Pomfrey?” Malfoy huffed, leaning on one of the room’s pillars to steady himself.
“The magic from the soulbond is ravaging his body, specifically hurting his lungs and heart. He should be avoiding all strenuous activity, I cannot believe you let him go out on the field! I expected better from you, Mister Potter.”
As they traversed the corridors, Harry did their best to make sure no one saw them, but as they were turning the corner, they bumped into a Hufflepuff First Year who held back a small shriek when she saw the blood on Malfoy.
“Something’s happened to you. I don’t even know who you are anymore, Harry.” Ron muttered. “We were always there for you, supporting you through thick and thin. We had to put up with all your pain and suffering and have you ever cared to think about what we feel? How have we been impacted by your destiny? No. I bet you haven't and I bet that you’re not going to do anything about it either. I’m sorry Harry but you need to fix yourself.”
“Murphy’s a nice guy, don’t tease him too much. But it was pretty funny,” Draco agreed, bumping Harry with his hip cheekily.
He wanted to run after the blonde boy but it was pointless. He was certain that Draco would not accept his apology and rightly so. He had done something so horrible to the already broken boy.
“You can wear my shirt,” Harry offered, “They’re far more comfortable than your fancy clothing.”
” He cried out, knowing Harry would easily block it and he did. Draco wasn’t quick enough to react when Harry simply flicked his wand, a large force punching him in the gut and sending Draco crashing back into a tree trunk.
Harry suddenly felt rather silly, as he wasn’t prepared to answer any questions asked. He looked at Draco sheepishly, and back at Murphy, unsure of what to say. He must have been silent for a while because Murphy was starting to get a little impatient, judging by the way he tapped his shoes on the ground. There was no way of escaping his question so he might as well answer the boy. He also felt somewhat obliged to do so, since Arnold was a good lad and Murphy seemed like one too. He leaned over, whispering into his ear.
“You’re the reason why my parents are dead! Don’t tell me I’m the one acting like a hot-headed brat!”
Harry was already at his breaking point of the night and the fact that Malfoy was here taunting him, at his mercy, was almost comforting in a horrific way. He could let himself take his anger out on Malfoy, it would be so easy. Harry stopped repressing his emotions and let the anger take over him.
“I don’t think you should say that, Mione. Especially when you know what happened to him.”
They went silent afterwards, just enjoying the other’s company and trying to forget the horrors of the war.
“Did Malfoy try to attack you or something? I knew the git was up to something today, he probably knew we were going to win,” Ron said, snorting when he saw Draco lying limp in Harry’s arms.
He sprinted towards the nearest bathroom and found Malfoy hunched over the sink, coughing harshly as blood trickled out of his mouth and into the grimy sink.
“Chicken? I’m not a chicken! I’ve gotten away with loads of things before, probably even more than you have,” Draco sneered.
Malfoy began to speak again, articulating each word carefully and emphasising how everything was Harry’s fault. Harry nodded along with him helplessly, crossing his arms and ready to defend himself. It couldn’t
Harry, even if Harry didn’t love him back. Soulbond or not, Harry was always going to despise him. Thinking of that, he really couldn’t stop his tears from falling and he crumpled at the roots of a tree, sobbing softly to himself. How did this ever happen to him?
“Thanks, Honky,” He said, talking to the empty air. Who knew, maybe the house-elf could hear him all the way in the kitchen.
He wouldn’t get an answer. Not now, not ever. He was just fated to have bad luck.
“I can, but whenever he starts speaking of whatever you mentioned just now, I can’t hear anything! All I can do for now is give you a Pepper-Up Potion to make you feel better, you’ll need to consult a professor to see if this is a curse of some sort. Until I know your symptoms and their origin, I can’t give you anything in case it harms you.”
Harry watched them leave and scoffed at Ron’s words. It was ironic how Harry could’ve said the same thing about him. Checking his timetable for his first lesson, Harry left his uneaten bowl of cereal and walked out of the Great Hall.
“Agreed.”
He lurched forward, vomiting onto the floor, almost puking on Harry’s shoes but he jumped back at the last moment, pitying the boy as his heaves sounded painful. Tears began to flow freely from his eyes and a bout of coughing took over the puking. Not only was there vomit on the ground but blood as well. Harry decided that he shouldn’t be so unhelpful and rubbed a supporting hand over his back, telling him it would be alright.
Harry was awoken by Hermione shaking his shoulder, letting him know that they had reached their destination. He forced his eyes open and stood up groggily, bumping into the door on his way out. He saw Malfoy in the corner of his eye once again but his former nemesis did the exact thing he had done earlier today; stare at Harry then walk away. It was slightly infuriating to Harry, how Malfoy treated him with such indifference when taunting Harry used to be the boy’s biggest obsession. One could argue that Malfoy himself was also  Harry’s biggest obsession in the last few years, but Harry certainly wasn’t going to ever admit that.
His heart rate slowed down and he eased himself back under the covers, eyelids growing heavier and heavier until sleep dragged him under.
He supposed he would have no choice but to confront his friends at breakfast today. He’d been avoiding running into anyone he knew over the weekend, having Honky bring him his meals over the weekend - the elf was an unexpected blessing. However, he didn’t want anyone to come checking on him after skipping meals in the Great Hall for two days, so he reluctantly got out of bed for breakfast with the rest of the school.
He wanted to get over this so badly. He wanted to not care but he couldn’t. He
“You were such a prat, a right royal stuck-up one,” Harry laughed, “I bet deep down you still are one, eh?”
Being reminded of his godfather was painful, and the argument was also his fault. It seemed like everything was his fault. He never apologised to Sirius for that and it would forever weigh him down. Merlin, he needed to make that change and make it soon.
He was awoken from his dream by his cat rubbing itself against his face. Reliving those memories was painful and he was glad that he was free from the prison his dreams kept him in.
The Great Hall was almost prettier this time, floating candles now replaced with exuberant chandeliers and cutlery embedded with small jewels. It seemed as though it was a brilliant fresh start for Hogwarts. Harry knew better than to hope that returning would allow him a fresh start as well.
Harry looked up as Slughorn entered and waved his wand at the board, revealing this lesson’s instructions.
Draco lay on his back, staring at the ceiling while fiddling with thumbs in annoyance. Goddamn Potter and his stupid spells. He refused to dwell on it any longer, simply hoping the curse would die down on itself soon. Flitwick hadn’t seemed overly concerned just now, so whatever other effects the curse was going to have on him was probably not going to kill him.
“No, I don’t think I did,” Harry lied, alarmed that he had let that slip.
“Yes, we’re sorry,” they said in unison.
“Oh, dear! What has happened to Mister Malfoy now?” She cried, helping Harry set the unconscious boy on a clean bed, grabbing potions and cloths. She removed his cloak and boots, magicking his Quidditch robes into a set of simple cotton clothes. She dabbed the blood, sweat, sand and dirt away with a clean cloth, whispering unintelligible charms over him. Harry could feel her healing magic practically emanate from him.
Draco was lost in his thoughts and paid no attention to the names being called out, nor did he notice the numerous glares he received as the list fell upon his name. Draco was used to the dirty looks sent at him by now but they still stung. He couldn’t believe that he used to be popular and adored by his housemates, it all seemed like a faraway myth now.
“Look at the freak.”
. Stupid Potter and his dumb privileges.
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, “I’ve made the Alihotsy Draught many times before and I. Did. Not. Die.”
Despite the extensive healing spells Madam Pomfrey had performed that had taken effect in his sleep, Draco still winced slightly in pain while trying to stretch and reach certain parts of his body while showering. He hadn’t completely understood Harry’s suggestion to help him last night, but he realised now that it certainly would’ve been painful for him to bathe himself before the healing spells fully kicked in overnight.
. If you won’t back down, I will
“Expel us,” Draco grumbled moodily.
It was meant to be a light-hearted joke but unfortunately, it came out spitefully and Harry knew Draco had picked up on his true meaning. He had tensed up and his smile had begun to contort into a frown.
bad stomach ache. I had a bad reaction to, uh, the porridge I ate that morning.”
Malfoy threw his hands up in frustration and looked at Harry expectantly. “Aren’t you going to help me up, Potter?”
“A what? Potter, you’re bonkers.”
Harry barged into the hospital wing, searching miserably for Madam Pomfrey and calling her name before she appeared, clasping her hands in horror.
Harry looked at Malfoy, utterly confused. “Can you not hear him speak?”
Malfoy tried to push him away the entire time, succeeding in doing so once but nearly falling down the staircase. Harry gave him an ‘I told you so’ look and helped him up again, much to Malfoy’s chagrin.
(See the end of the chapter for
When they finally reached the hospital ward, the pair heaved a sigh of relief as they weren’t spotted by anyone. Except for that one First Year. Hopefully, she wouldn’t be too traumatised or worse, tell others what she saw. That would certainly bring up many unwanted questions.
It was only when Draco realised earlier this year that he had always been in love with Harry, that he’d understood that weird attraction being around Harry always brought him. He used to try to ignore that feeling as much as possible, too scared to confront the fact that he liked the Gryffindor boy. Being increasingly unkind to Harry and throwing himself at anyone who showed interest in him during his Seventh Year hadn’t been effective in making those feelings go away, and even now in their Eighth Hogwarts year, Draco still undoubtedly loved a boy who could never love him back.
He gazed wistfully at the window, watching the raindrops trailing down the glass. As his cat settled down in his lap, he thought to himself, at least I have one friend with me to make it through this school year.
Harry pumped a few handfuls of his spiced cinnamon shampoo and began to lather it over Draco’s locks, ensuring that none of it got into his steadfast and penetrating eyes. He massaged his fingertips along his scalp and temples, working his roots and then rinsing it off with cool water. A pump of vanilla-scented conditioner and he made sure to really work his way through Draco’s hair, knowing that he was extremely particular about it.
Harry turned beet red and tried to flatten his hair down, realising that it was sticking up in ten different directions. He had completely forgotten about combing his hair in his rush to get ready for practice. Oh, Merlin, he was really going to be late for the match if he continued to argue with Malfoy outside his room.
It had taken them years to get this far, to finally bury the hatchet of their rivalry. Draco wasn’t going to screw it up - he’d even play extra nice with Harry if he had to. It felt refreshing to be able to call Harry his friend now, he’d never particularly enjoyed taunting Harry every time they ran into each other. It was mostly just for show, simply what everyone expected of him as a Malfoy and a Slytherin.
, Harry recalled. It had been so long since he’d seen some of the Gryffindors in his year that he didn’t recognise the familiar voice instantly. Harry had been so caught up in his own world and the situation with Draco that he’d barely focused on catching up with the people around him, passing through each class and meal with his house as if he was living his own life vicariously. The fact that he no longer spent time in the Gryffindor common rooms after getting his private dorm didn’t help the matter either.
“I did not know Master Harry and Master Draco were together. Honky was given instructions to bring food to Master Potter and then to Master Draco, forgive Honky’s intrusion!”
He held Malfoy’s head up so he wouldn’t choke on his own blood as that would be a truly horrible way to go, collapsing in a dingy Hogwarts bathroom. Merlin forbade he became the male counterpart of Moaning Myrtle. Sworn enemy or not, Harry couldn’t just leave him to die alone in a bathroom.
“Shut up Malfoy.”
He closed his eyes, resting peacefully as he breathed in Harry’s scent, a comforting aroma which helped him sleep.
“You’re such a biscuit.”
He shook his head and tugged Hermione up, leading her out of the Great Hall without another look at Harry.
Malfoy’s slender pale hands scrabbled at his neck as his grey eyes were flooded with panic and Harry kneeled next to him, holding his head up as blood splattered onto both their uniforms. It reminded him of Sectumsempra, and how Malfoy was on the ground with blood and water surrounding him. A beautifully painful scene.
The kid choked out a quick ‘sorry’ before looking back at his table and laughing. He evidently thought he was some hotshot and would be ‘cool’ in the other Gryffindors’ eyes if he targeted an ex-Death Eater. Draco gave him a pained smile in annoyance before striding out of the hall to clean himself up in the bathroom. It would do no good to his already wrecked image if he fought back and he didn’t want to give the Gryffindors the satisfaction of seeing him crack. His father had always taught him that Malfoys would never sink down to the level of those unworthy of their attention. As Draco walked to the bathroom, he didn’t notice Harry stood against the wall outside the Great Hall and the other boy didn’t notice him either.
The hand that wasn't around Harry's length was still twirling and tugging at the coarse curls around his base. The gesture felt oddly comforting to Draco, so he kept going at it. It was a good thing for him because Harry couldn't get enough of it.
The two boys didn't dare to stop and think about what was going on. This was so unlike anything they've ever done before. It was so out of their element, but it was also oddly natural between the two of them. They slipped into their roles seamlessly, almost like they did this every night.
Harry climbed onto Draco's bed, hunger written all over his features. He stopped right before Draco and towered over him, causing Draco to shrink back in on himself.
He slowly lowered himself and stopped abruptly when his cock began to roll against the fabric. He let out a small whimper. Harry knew exactly what was happening and Draco looked back at Harry with wild, pleading eyes.
, but nowadays he didn’t mind the boys presence at all.
"Come on." The impatience in his voice was salient now. He needed to write back to Harry to let him know that he got his message.
Draco, of course, didn't like that he wasn't being taken seriously and he shot daggers back at Harry. They were meant to be intimidating, but to Harry, it looked far from it. It made him want to laugh out loud again, but he suppressed it in the back of his throat.
"Yes, alright." Draco mumbled. He attempted to brush the hand off of his upper thigh, but Harry didn't budge. He only squeezed tighter in response.
Draco whimpered under Harry's intense stare and his hips spastically rolled about the sheets. Harry reached out with a finger and ran it along Draco's jawline before situating it right under his chin.
"Good thing I've got another one." Harry said, leaning over towards his bag to open the flap.
acting like a child.
about drinking every last drop of his seed and how dare Harry come in and try to steal that from him.
Draco's curved length bobbed against his abdomen, twitching deliciously at the thought.
"Alright pick up the knife. Remember, it is best if you crush the bean with the side of the blade." Slughorn guided and Draco reached out for the tool with a shaky hand.
"Want you." Draco whined and lightly pounded on Harry's sternum. He was desperate to taste Harry at this point. Ever since he got a taste of Harry's pre-come after licking it off himself, he's been dying for more.
Draco whimpered, letting his eyes fall shut. He was hyper aware of Harry's warm touch on his face and the way his fingers brushed back and fourth in attempt to sooth him.
"Yes. Indeed
"No, my love.
"Potter!" Draco gasped, obviously startled by the newfound audience he acquired. His moves grew frantic as he tried to hide as much of himself as possible, but it wasn't like it
Harry lowered himself onto one knee, directly in front of Albus, and slipped a towel around his tiny frame before engulfing him in a tight embrace. He placed a loud kiss on his left cheek, then his right, one on his forehead and finally two soft pecks atop his button nose. It was a ritual he did every time he got off of work, whether it was him coming back from the Ministry or him coming out of the home office.
When eighth year began, he felt sorry for the boy. It was like the Malfoy he once knew was dead and all of the life was drained out from behind his eyes. For some peculiar reason, the sight of him looking so fragile strained Harry's heart.
"Shit." Draco muttered under his breath and discreetly fumbled to shove his swollen cock back in his pants and button it close.
"Want."
Draco keenly wrapped both of his hands around Harry's right thigh and Harry looked down at him with a confused expression. He decided to not interrupt the man on a mission since he was quite curious to see where Draco's mind was going.
Ron's high-spirited expression transformed into one more sombre when his friends words registered in his brain. It was a delicate subject within their small group, rooting from the many scares they've had over the years. It was a natural instinct for Harry to assume the worst, and sometimes that fact slipped Ron's mind.
He knew Malfoy would be asleep, that was for certain. He
"Wow, two words now? Don't get too ahead of yourself." Harry joked, leaning in to place a small kiss on Draco's nose to ease the frustration his taunts have brought along.
"Hurry 'Corpus!" He chortled out, letting his guard down for a beat. Draco took this temporary moment to remove his foot from Albus' grip without hurting the little boy.
Draco Malfoy was one
"Hey! What happened to the 'I miss you so much, Harry! Please come home now! Fuck the Ministry tell them to bring my husband home!'?" Harry mimicked Draco from his letter. This earned Harry an extra punch for swearing once again in front of their children.
"Bossy too." Harry observed, smirking back at the pout forming on Draco's lips. Draco stared back at Harry with wide pleading eyes.
"Oh fuck." Draco's head sunk back to the bed, his eyes fluttering closed in pure bliss. The silicon prick pushed through the first ring of muscles slowly, careful not to hurt the body it was intruding.
"Grab the lube." Harry directed and again, Draco obeyed. "Such a good boy, you know that? You listen so well." Draco never thought he would be one to fall apart over praise. He was the kind of person who didn't know how to take compliments, but the way Harry made him feel so godlike was utterly
He used his lips to swirl his spit around the slit before seductively looking up at Harry through his eyelashes and taking the full head into his mouth.
"That's fair." Draco innocently leaned in closer to get a decent view of the lines he was creating and it made Harry's body physically tense up.
"Can we still put carrots on Daddy's plate?" Scorpius' voice chimed in, holding onto his Papa tighter.
"And what do you plan on doing when I get up, might I ask?" Harry cocked an eyebrow, demanding a response. He knew what Draco had in mind, but he wanted to hear him
In his head, he was desperately trying to relive the conversation that unfolded moments ago, but he couldn't. He was too busy entertaining the idea of Malfoy sucking his cock to be engaged in the conversation.
Draco's only response was another whimper, quiet this time and Harry found himself feeling proud of his control.
! I don't even know why the hell I was in the bath! One moment I was sitting at the edge of the tub and I blink once, and the next thing I know I'm sitting inside with my swim trunks on pretending to be a Princess!"
"Come on, up you get,
"Touch me, Harry." Draco breathed out. "Please."
Draco jumped, feeling the warmth of his professors touch on his shoulder that sent him back into reality. "Sorry for cursing. I uh—Sometimes I go into shock when it hurts so badly." Slughorn seemed to buy the lie and he guided Draco through the next step.
It was then when he noticed the red phallic shape situated next to Draco's body on the bed.
"'Corpus, who you gonna be?" Albus asked, pushing over Draco so he could see his brothers face.
He looked
"I only swing from Daddy's arm for now, okay?" Albus peered up at Draco, staring at him with wide, innocent eyes.
"Hello?" Slughorn tried again and the room bursted into millions of whispers, all wondering what was wrong with Draco Malfoy.
"Drop your hand, Draco. I want you to stay just like that, can you do that for me?" When Draco moaned a quiet approval and lowered his hand, Harry casted a spell on the phallic shape. It was a charm to let an object work on its own, but Harry was still able to have some control over its movements. Harry read about it in a book one afternoon while being forced to sit in the library with his friends. He knew it would come in handy one day.
"Mhm." Draco purred and Harry smiled down at him.
So instead, he preferred to talk them through the wrongs and the rights of their actions.
Harry caught Draco's bouncing leg out of the corner of his eye and the repetitive movement made him feel increasingly anxious.
Draco shook his head and he forced himself to stop thinking about the
"Daddy should not be saying those words, they are not nice. Don't repeat words you do not know like that. Come and ask me if you are not sure and I will tell you. Do you understand?" Draco asked, trying to suppress the anger that bubbled in his chest resulting from Harry's carelessness.
Harry could feel the uneven jerks of Draco's chest as he breathed in and out and he knew something was wrong. Draco's breathing has steadied since they climaxed so he knew it wasn't from overworking himself.
He lifted Scorpius out of the tub and continued with the same pattern of movement, drying him, hugging him, then kissing his face.
"S'good. Fuck, so good Draco. So good for me." Harry praised, transitioning from a gentle teasing on his cock to palming himself through his jeans. He watched Draco squirm about the bed, desperately rolling his hips up into the air.
Harry held his head down for a few moments while Draco gagged around him. The sensations felt too good to let go so quickly. He eventually let Draco pull himself back up his shaft, tugging up his foreskin as he sucked in his cheeks. He twisted off the tip, letting Harry's cock bob against his stomach.
Harry ran his tongue over Draco's bottom lip, coating it with his own saliva. For a moment, he forgot about his erection completely. He was too worried about Draco to care about his own pain.
Wrong.
"Harry, can you recall from herbology how we would handle the plant in preparation to cut it at the root?" Of course Slughorn would ask him a question in this very moment. Harry had no idea, of course, but he'd be damned if he didn't take a wild guess.
The glowing smile across the boys face said it all.
"You're on a rainbow road! See Papa?" He held his legos out in front of him, giving Draco a good view of it.
Harry's arm covered his closed eyes and his opposite hand threaded itself in Draco's hair. Draco hummed in appreciation, leaning into his touch with a soft smile on his face.
Harry soon found that Draco's presence was shockingly enjoyable when he let his guard down. Surprisingly, their personalities flourished together when they weren't shoving hateful comments down each other's throats.
"Do you think Daddy will like my dance I did for him?" Scorpius asked, his hands gripping the sides of the dark oak desk. Draco made sure the ink pot was set aside and out of reach. That was a disaster just waiting
He wiggled his bum up in the air again and let out a stubborn whimper, moaning Harry's name repeatedly. He hoped he would look too irresistible in Harry's eyes to say no again. He hoped Harry would give in and pound him into the mattress until he saw stars.
"Do you think he's cursed?" Harry heard one of his classmates whisper to her partner.
Draco hooked his fingers around Harry's shaft, giving it a tight squeeze.
"Now Papa has no feet." Draco pointed out and Scorpius began to giggle at the thought of his Papa without feet.
"Still not a princess?" Draco joked, referring back to the Little Mermaid. Scorpius roared with laughter, his wet curls now sticking to the side of his face. Draco absentmindedly combed his fingers through the dripping locks, slicking his hair back and off his forehead.
Harry's hands were gripped around the arms of the chair, his knuckles white. He refrained himself from stroking his cock any more, saving his erection as a treat for Draco after he was finished. He knew he wasn't going to have to wait much longer, but the agonizing pain he felt was growing unbearable.
sound, he lifted the soft fabric of Albus' hippogriff t-shirt (a joke Harry came home with one day. I mean really, it's been
"Harry—" Draco gasped, leaning into his touch. The tears threatened to spill from his wide eyes and Harry finally noticed his emotional state.
Harry's foot steps echoed down the empty corridor every time the sole of his shoe crashed down against the stone floor. He frantically raced through the castle, moving so quickly that he was practically levitating through the hallways.
Harry. Harry.
The same classroom he sat in as an eleven year old boy years ago, whose intentions were completely innocent as he took in his environment with amazement.
Harry leaned in and placed his first kiss, right under Draco's eye on his left cheek. He pulled back and instantly shifted to the right side, touching his lips to the softness of Draco's skin.
"Look, that ones Daddy. I even put his belly!" Scorpius pointed out with excitement. He dug his head face first into the couch and kicked his leg over onto the cushion, crawling up next to his Father. Draco always thought it was a peculiar way to get onto the sofa, but to each their own, right?
" Draco wedged his hand under Harry's to gain access to the waist band of his pants. He swiftly tugged them back and watched as his cock hit the air of the classroom once again.
•——————•——————•
He popped off his member again and watched it slap against his stomach before shifting his gaze to Harry, who was now groaning at the lack of touch.
Going back to the task at hand, Draco kicked himself over Harry's propped up leg and spit directly into his hand, coating Harry's flesh with a layer of it. Draco proceeded to spit into his hand again, this time wrapping it around his own cock to lather it up.
Harry repeatedly brushed back the sweaty silver locks of hair that clung to Draco's forehead. As Draco rode out the aftershocks, Harry shushed him through it, whispering praises into the thick air of the room.
"It's not good to hang from things like that, Albus. It's not safe. You could've gotten hurt, or your brother could've gotten hurt." Draco's voice was soft as he calmly tried to explain the situation to his boys. He could see the cogs turning inside of Albus' brain. As he desperately tried to process the information, Draco remained silent in order for him to put the pieces into place for himself.
He ran his forefinger gently over his slit, pulling it back and watching the string of his precome grow longer the further he drew it back. It was utterly fascinating and it was all because of
Draco lowered himself down onto the freshly wet surface and lined up his erection with the flesh beneath him. He flushed his bare chest against Harry's thigh and situated his face back in front of Harry's cock.
He sunk onto his knees, sandwiching Draco's face between his callused hands. His face was now inches away from the teary boy and Harry's eyes ate up every inch of his face in hopes to figure out what was wrong.
"Sorry." Draco breathed out and his hot breath lingered against Harry's cheek. His eyes automatically fluttered shut and a sigh escaped past his lips. The hot sensation made his hard prick twitch in interest.
Harry's eyes were squeezed shut as he cried out. He was overstimulated and hyper aware of the tongue greedily swirling around his slit. His legs were squirming against the bed and the extra movement against Draco's erection sent him straight into his second orgasm.
"Want you." Draco let his head fall to the side, too tired to keep it upright. The expression on his face screamed pure arousal and the beauty of it felt overwhelming to Harry.
"Come here, Scorp." He gestured towards the red cheeked boy who was still perched inside the refrigerator in silence. He was hesitant with his movement, but soon enough he scrambled out of the cold air and stood next to Albus with wobbly knees.
Prince. I explain, okay?" Albus drew in a breath of frustration and his eyebrows scrunched together.
"Yeah! We bad guys!" Albus' added, hanging off of Harry's neck while chewing on the edge of his towel. Draco sheepishly stared back, wondering why the hell he hasn't made an effort to move yet.
Draco was squirming atop the sheets again, hopelessly trying to rut his erection against every surface possible. He knew he was still not allowed to touch it and it was screaming at him to be taken care of.
Harry melted under his stare, eyes rolling back and mouth parting in pure pleasure. He was close to coming fully undone, right in the back of the potions classroom.
Scorpius let out a frightened shriek and dashed down the hallway to safety. He wanted to get as far away from his Papa as possible.
"Sorry love. I couldn't help myself."
He heeded the soft stomps of Scorpius in tow, desperately trying to catch up with his brother. "Albus! Albus!" He tittered through heavy breaths. He was already worn out after ten minutes of chasing Albus around their country home.
"Piss off." Harry groaned, pitching a throw pillow in his general direction. The action triggered screeches from both of his friends, dodging the cushion at the last second.
"Pretty in pink, I see." Harry gestured towards the lace panties that were hugging Draco's hips. His face grew almost as red as the
It was only Draco. They were safe.
was at this hour, the curtains of his four poster bed drawn tightly with a silencing charm on for good measures.
Disregarding the insistant pain in his chest, Harry's hand slid back up to his prick as it bobbed against the fabric of his button up shirt in excitement.
"I didn't say you could touch that pretty prick of yours, did I?" Harry vocalized while tracing the head of his cock with his finger. The soft sound of his jeans being scratched fell quietly into the background noise, the sound not even being registered by the two boys.
"Albus, can't I be like the Little Mermaid? She had legs, didn't she?" Ever since their Auntie Hermione, also known as Auntie Nee by Albus, played the Lion King for them, Rose, and Hugo, they've been obsessed with all things Disney.
"...showed him how to crush it the other day. Mr. Malfoy, would you please be so kind as to demonstrate how to prepare the sopophorous bean for the potion?"
At the beginning of the term, Harry was livid
Harry's eyes opened and found Draco's. They were already staring back at him with an intense, lustful hunger.
raising them to be strong, polite young men. I think you make one hell of a Father." Harry reassured, squeezing Draco's shoulders in his hands.
"Nothing Sir. I just have a bad knee. I need to take things slow." Draco fabricated and Harry was quite impressed that he came up with such a lie on the spot.
and Draco has never been more excited to have a cock in his mouth in his life, but that had nothing to do with the size. It was the fact that it was
"Untouched? Harry are you
Harry stared back with dark eyes, fisting the locks of hair tighter in his hand. Draco whimpered and his eyes faltered back to his prize ahead.
They ended it abruptly when their kids began using the tub for bath time. Sex in the bath their kids splashed around in hours before was a
, which almost sent it spiraling towards the floor. "Careful, Scorp."
"Uh, yeah. Got it." Draco replied warily. He lazily waved his arms around underneath the water, feeling the silky liquid graze upon his skin.
you." Draco replied, only mouthing the curse word so the kids didn't hear, but Harry heard him loud and clear.
Draco finally let his mouth off of Harry's cock, which was already growing flaccid under his touch. He rested his head on Harry's hip, catching his breath and trying to calm himself down.
She is the strongest person Draco has ever encountered in his lifetime. She did everything to protect Draco. She wasn't just hearing the muffled sounds of a meeting from two floors down and occasionally picking up on real words. She was living in it. And it was all for
"I think Daddy would want some carrots on his plate, Papa." Scorpius giggled. It was only fifteen minutes ago when the dynamic in the household shifted drastically. The sugar from their 'desert before dinner' was rushing through their veins and Draco was finding it very difficult to keep them still at the table.
"Not quite yet, darling." Draco quickly found himself shifting positions so he was on his hands and knees. He
"Yes, Sir." Draco saluted him, causing a small giggle to escape past his lips. "Alright, Prince. What is your name?" Draco hoped that was the right response. He didn't know if he could sit through the explanation of the game
Draco's eyes flitted down to the floor before he made his way after his children, and he spotted the pink fluff of Iggy once again abandoned on the floor.
"Papa, look what I made!" Scorpius held up his new invention with a proud smile painted upon his face. Draco blinked back at his son with a blank expression, confused as to what he was being presented with. He stared at the abstract sculpture for a few moments in hope that an understanding would dawn on him, but it never came.
The sight of Draco in a swim suit made the two boys
"Alright, alright! I surrender!" Draco gave in, placing a giggling Albus back down on the floor, which seemed to be a bad idea. Albus' interest instantly diverted to what his brother was doing. With a soft
Draco stared at the man for few moments, trying to process his words in his foggy mind.
"I will be right here next to the tub to play, okay? See I can still see you guys when I'm sitting here." He demonstrated by sitting on the damp rug that was placed at the foot of the bath.
He was an over thinker and he knew he was going to crumble under the silence of the room.
Draco, lost in his own world of bliss, rolled his head to the side, feeling the soft silk sheets caress his cheek. What he didn't expect was to see Harry Potter staring back at him.
Since Harry still had the vial of lube next to him, he silently accioed Draco's dildo over to him. Just like the last time Harry used the spell, Draco was oblivious to it. He was more focused on his own hand snaking back between his crack.
Draco's climax rippled through him, riding out his high as his body jerked with pleasure. He could feel the hot spurts of come shoot out of his pulsing member. He continued to roll his hips into the sheets, making a mess of his seed beneath him.
"Princess Papa! We come to take over!" Scorpius shouted, hanging off of Draco's right shoulder. Albus was clutching onto the opposing one in a similar stance as his brother.
"Good boy, Draco. Stay quiet for me."
Draco stuck his tongue out further, laying it flat against his skin. He closed his lips around it and left behind small wet kisses, all the while still holding intense eye contact with the boy in front of him.
He was sprawled out on the loveseat, reading some book he found hidden away in the side table drawer. He toyed with the edge of the page, a bad habit he picked up on when he was old enough to enjoy the wonders of reading. Although tonight, he barely payed any mind to those said wonders.
Draco bottomed out with a cry and squeezed his eyelids shut. Before he knew it, the dildo was sliding back out and ramming into him all over again.
The scene of the fridge toppling over and trapping Scorpius inside was on replay in his mind. He knew Albus' weight was probably not enough to send the appliance tumbling toward the floor, but he wasn't going to wait to find out.
"Draco. No." Harry's expression was stern, his eyebrow raising in challenge as if saying: 'Go on, do it. See what happens, then.'
"Happy now?" Harry asked, referring to his previously 'grumpy' mood. Draco nodded his head against Harry's warm skin.
swim trunks?" Harry commented, tugging at the waist band as if he was inspecting them to make sure his observations were correct.
"I'm sorry I yelled." Draco started, closing the heavy door behind Scorpius who was shifting on his feet in discomfort. Draco let himself examine him for a moment. His whole face was contorted in thought. Rosy lips were puckered in concentration, eyebrows furrowed and twitching about. He was contemplating something and Draco knew it. "What's on your mind, little one."
"I'm wizard too, 'Corpus!" Albus added to the conversation. For a second it startled Draco. He completely forgot he was present in the room. The next second he reprimanded himself for forgetting about his own child.
"It's just easier for me and I'll be able to make you feel really good, I—" Draco spiraled into an explanation. He shouldn't have asked. He knew he shouldn't have asked. He was making a fool of himself.
Harry.
"Papa!" Albus whined, dragging out the '
•——————•——————•
He bit down on his lip as he pushed his finger inside, breaching past the tight ring of muscles. He only allowed himself to go down to the first knuckle before pulling it back out slowly.
Draco hummed again, but didn't make an effort to move. He just laid there with his eyes closed and a blissful smile on his face, not a care in the world.
He scanned the room once more to ensure that nobody caught him in the last second. Still, not a single soul was glancing their way or staring at them with wide eyes. They were safe.
"Daddy!" Their collective cheers echoed throughout the hall, and Draco finally felt the two boys scurry off of his feet. Before he could process his next move, he found himself staring back at two boys who were tripping over air in attempt to be the first one to the office.
Draco's glossy eyes honed in on Harry's movement and he instinctively licked his lips. The sight looked utterly delicious.
He thought to himself.
"You taste delicious, Draco." Harry praised after sucking on his last finger. "I wonder what you would taste like around my lips."
that's what he was supposed to do.
"So this is where all the action is tonight?" A voice cut through the sound of screams and laughter, and the noise instantly died down.
"Daddy! You have to see the lego I made!" Albus giggled, still clawing at the air to get Harry's attention. Harry quickly spelled the floor clean and picked Albus up out of the tub.
Draco experimentally rolled his hips against Harry's skin to test out his makeshift toy. His foreskin pulled back and Harry could feel Draco's soft head rub against him.
Harry's right hand was completely soaked in his own bodily fluids and it continued to be coated in sticky liquid as he discreetly thrusted into his tight fist.
His little hand found it's way to Draco's knee and he rested it there. His chubby fingers twitched gently against the fabric of his trousers and it soon became the only thing Draco's senses could focus on.
"That's it, Draco. So so pretty." Harry praised, raising his head to appreciate the beautiful image of the boy leaning over with his lips hugging his cock.
This time, Draco didn't miss a beat before slicking his fingers up with more lube and bringing them down between his cheeks. He pressed the tip of his pointer finger down onto his pink hole, rubbing small circles around it. He could feel it puckering beneath him.
is ready to be approached, Draco?" Harry couldn't help but jokingly ask. He saw the opportunity and how could he
"Harry, please." Draco pleaded to him. He didn't like the games Harry was playing at.
He arched into his own touch, urgently seeking out for more. His feet dug into the mattress, frantically flailing them about. An overstimulated Draco was certainly a sight to see and Harry found himself lucky enough to witness it.
Draco's body instantly grew frigid and he couldn't imagine how chilly Scorpius must be feeling. He instinctually wrapped him in a tight bear hug and pulled him closer to his heart.
" He tried to tell him to stop.
He felt a chuckle rumble in the depths of his chest and escape through the smile on his face. He closed his eyes, shaking his head in amusement. "Yes, only from Daddy's arms from now on."
Harry bucked his hips up, desperately fucking his own fist. He needed to slow down. He was already so close to spilling over and he had no intentions of stopping their fun any time soon.
"Harry, Harry—Oh fuck—Harry." His name kept rolling off Draco's tongue like a mantra while he drowned in self pleasure. Draco made a strangled noise and he reached out to clutch the sheets beside him.
As Harry took in the sight, he concluded that this was a new kink of his: watching a completely debauched Malfoy under the attention of a full audience.
. He could already see tomorrow's headline:
He would grip his hips so tightly that Draco would wake up with his fingerprints bruised into his pale skin. He wanted nothing more than to mark what should be rightfully
"Add another. I know you can do it." Harry ordered, wordlessly summoning the lube for his own needs. Draco didn't seem to notice. He was too dazed out while fucking himself on his fingers.
Draco whined in protest, lowering himself on his fingers a few more times before reluctantly pulling out. Harry made sure he was staring right at Draco's swollen hole, not wanting to miss the way it repeatedly clenched around the air.
He doesn't recall ever being so
"No Papa! It okay, please! Papa don't have fat feet! See? All gone." He frantically took apart the long pieces of legos attached to the base and hid them in his palm, fingers curling around the colorful plastic.
The small whimpers escaping his mouth sent Harry over the top. His erection was painfully hard, but he wasn't going to let himself have the pleasure of stroking it quite yet. He needed to cater to Draco's needs before himself.
"Albus Severus, get off of the refrigerator door right now!" Draco ordered, scrambling towards them in panic. Albus was hanging off of the door handle, lifting his feet up in the air and swinging back and fourth, completely oblivious to the dangers that could unfold. Scorpius was now sitting
"Touch yourself. I want you to fuck yourself on those pretty fingers. I want you to pretend it's me."
"Not right now. We will talk about it in the morning. Right now I just want to lie here and take care of you if you'll let me. Does that sound alright, Draco?"
"Fuck Draco." Harry breathed out, his head falling back along with his eyes. "So hot. So so fucking hot." His mouth was talking for him now, not allowing himself to think before he spoke. "You look absolutely delicious."
." Draco cried, drawing out the last syllable of his name with a long groan.
Harry's hard member bobbed against his shirt, coating it with pre-come as it hit the fabric. He continued to stroke it leisurely, knowing very well that if he succumbed to fervidly slicking his swollen prick with his fist, he would ejaculate within seconds.
As Harry approached the door, he couldn't help but detect a slight adjustment to the usual atmosphere that hung over the entryway to his dorm. He could hear quiet movements in the room, but he couldn't discern the exact source it derived from. He knew it obviously had to be from Malfoy, but that's as much as he could gather.
his mother was seated right next to him.
"What is it, sweet boy?" His voice was strained, trying incredibly hard to not be disappointed by the lack of attention on his prick. Draco's needs came first, but it still didn't help that he was excruciatingly erect, on the verge of being downright painful.
He looked unbelievably beautiful and Harry couldn't hold back any longer. He came in his own hand with the thought of painting Draco's sharp features with his seed. Thinking about spilling inside of the warmth of Draco's mouth.
Draco gave the painted boy, Raphael, a firm nod. At the gesture, the wings of the key he was holding fluttered a bit and left his hand. Not even a second later the portrait swung aside, revealing the compartment he had slept in the night before. But, to Draco's relief, everything was a bit expanded as well. The bed was wider, the desk as well and he now even had a wardrobe accompanied by a standing mirror. Everything was decorated in shades of pale blue, gold and white; the colors of Beauxbatons.
As if the word
Draco shook his head. '
We have heard so much about you!' They both took ahold of one of his hands and brightened their smiles.
His words seemed to upset his father even more, especially because they were once again said in French — a language his father had never truly been able to speak nor understand. 'We are in England, Draco. You must stop talking in that daft language of yours.'
'By flying Thestrals, of course,' was Luna's answer.
While the Wizengamot had had a discussion in whispers about possible punishments and/or a sentence to Azkaban, Draco'd felt a terrible itch on his arm for the first time. It had been more like a stab, really, than an itch. It had been so painful that he had to pull up his sleeve, scratch his skin to just do
,' he mutters to himself. He could've known about the curse already 5 years ago!
Ron held the first watch; sat outside the tent's opening with the fire still burning brightly. His silhouette was clear on the other side of the canvas, and Draco often traced it in his head like a drawing; trying to make time pass faster. Harry's heartbeat had slowed down a bit, and his fever was dropping — yet Draco was still worried, and hadn't left his side for even a moment.
. And-'
Harry shook his head, his watery eyes staring in Draco's — eyes that showed he was telling the truth. 'You did
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco felt heat rise to his head at Ron's words. He knew very well who Cho Chang was. Ravenclaw seeker, beautiful girl with Asian eyes and hair as black as that of a raven. Beside from a sudden anger he also felt disappointed and almost… heartbroken. 'Oh,' he could only manage to say as he looked at his feet.
Visions of orbs of glass in a cold blue light doomed up in front of Harry's eyes. Faint smoke swirled through them as if it was trying to take Harry into someone else's dream. Was that vision that of a prophecy? 'You think that the prophecy is kept in those glass orbs I keep seeing? The ones we use at Divination?'
Harry seemed utterly shocked by Draco's words for a second but as he shook his head, Draco saw the glimpse of a smile again. ‘Well, that’s not only my fault. You always seem to feel better than me.’
, Hogwarts. Never thought I'd see you again this early,' Draco said out loud as he stepped through the gates and entered the school's grounds.
Harry fidgeted on his seat a little, eyes pointed at an intricate silver object on Dumbledore's desk. 'I'm not angry with him, sir. At least — not anymore,' he admitted. Draco could just feel Harry's green eyes glance over to him but he didn't dare to answer the look, kept his eyes locked on Dumbledore's extremely long beard instead.
Probably never would Harry understand how this boy could stay so calm about his own powers — about something so out of this world. Perhaps one got used it after all these years. Who knew Draco'd been surprised and shocked by his own powers at first too. “I am truly amazed at what you can do, Draco. It’s...
man that he was-'
'Yeah. Heard him talk about this Ravenclaw girl earlier this week. Cho Chang, or what's her name? Think he's gone out to find her and ask her to the bloody Ball.'
!' Harry had taken a step closer to Draco, his index finger poking into his chest. With each word followed a painful poke full of hate. 'You're just like your father, Draco; the
'I will indeed,' the headmaster replied. 'And therefore you shouldn't worry anymore, Draco.'
Confused, Draco shook his head. '
'Wouldn't you want me to win?'
'You had to save him again?' Ron interrupted him.
'Harry,' the same voice whispered again — louder this time, but still Harry ignored it and lifted his right hand to point his wand at Voldemort's laughing face.
Draco explained. 'Would you like to meet them?'
'Pureblood,' he explained in the simplest way.
So, I decided to give the story a little twist and give the locket to Draco as it will completely change his behavior. I also just wanted to change the story a little more so it wouldn't be too much like the real one. The weddings parts and such are short but I found them necessary to keep up with the story and remember everything that was going on.
Draco raised himself on his elbow and looked at Harry with shock readable on his face. 'The dungeons? They were going to lock you up like a mad person?'
a few strands of my hair to use in a Polyjuice potion. Their
, he told himself, and hurriedly ran to his bed to get a pillow and blanket for the boy. But when he turned around again, he had crawled up to his feet, his covered-in-blood back positioned towards Harry. It made him swallow, drop the blanket and clutch the pillow, trying not to feel sick again.
'A copy of Celestina Warbeck's autobiography!' she announced, showing off the book with its elaborate cover.
With the portrait door shut again, he let out a deep breath he didn't knew he had been holding in. He reached forward with his hands and felt the smooth fabric of the invisibility cloak beneath his fingers. He clutched his hand around it and pulled it off Harry's body. The boot stood with his back towards Draco, head turned the other way to look around his room. 'So, this is where you sleep? It's quite nice,' he commented.
Hearing the anger in Snape's voice, and seeing his hand slowly point itself at Harry again — the black wand clutched in it — Harry knew it was definitely time to leave. He didn't want to; but he had to, if he didn't want to be hit by a Jelly-Leg Jinx or something far worse as well. He left the dungeons feeling utterly exhausted yet wide awake by his new discoveries. Not only had he found out his father used to bully other students, he had also found out about Snape being friends with Draco's father.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco adjusted his hat a bit and pushed a wet lock of hair out of his eyes. 'Why need many when one can do the job? Now,
As she stepped aside to let the Champions enter the Great Hall, Harry quickly turned himself towards Draco. 'That gives me an idea,' the boy said, before he snatched Draco's hat off his head and tossed it somewhere down the hallway. Draco's silver locks fell over his robes like water as he gave Harry a shocked expression.
Descending the many stairs again and walking through hallways with legs still wobbly from them — Draco finally told the secret he had been keeping for over a month to Harry and his friends. The twins were lingering behind them as well; still trying to convince Hermione that Beauxbatons' moving staircases were pretties and better than those at Hogwarts — even though they had never seen the ones at Hogwarts before. Hermione shut their mouths as Draco opened his to explain how he helped Dumbledore hide from Umbridge and the Ministry overall. 'Well,' Draco started. 'I happened to be the one to see Headmaster Dumbledore appear outside Beauxbatons' golden gates. He had just apparated there; landed with a soft sound but one that my ears had caught nonetheless — that had drawn my attention. On his arm was his beautiful phoenix; blinking its yellow eyes and getting a few pets from its owner before flying away into the sky and disappearing out of sight. Shocked, I was, of seeing Dumbledore in France, but I approached him anyway,' Draco continued. Everyone was looking at him with huge eyes; waiting for him to go on. 'You see; only Beauxbatons' teachers and elected students can open the golden gates—'
day of school at Hogwarts had been terrible for him. Not only did he have to wear the awful black school robes with matching red and golden tie — he also had to face a lot of students that seemed to be disgusted by even a single glance at him. Rumors had spread fast and everyone seemed to know the son of a Death Eater was staying at their school for the rest of the year. But fortunately there had been some that had greeted Draco like an old friend and had welcomed him to their school; helped him get rid of pestering students and guided him to all his classes. Harry had followed him every second and had seemed to be sticking to him like a piece of spello-tape. Every few minutes he would say how glad he was to have Draco by his side; to have him safe and out of the hands of the Dark Lord.
He let go of Draco's hands, his gaze leaving Draco's eyes and staring at the floor beneath their feet. 'Your fault?' Draco managed to ask, his voice trembling. Nowhere in his memory he could see Harry a part of his pain, of his scars. He only remembered him to be gone while he suffered — to be somewhere, trying to get to him.
'It has,' was his mother's answer. 'But you won't be returning to school any time soon.'
So that was the reason of his whole getting-closer-to-Slughorn affair; he had to obtain the same memory he had seen but the real one — not the one the professor himself had changed to clear his own name. They had left Dumbledore's office a few minutes ago, and even though Harry had been extremely hungry — Draco had asked if they could go for a walk as he was in need of some fresh air. As they sauntered through the fresh snow that had fallen only the day before; Harry made a plan in his mind on how he could obtain that memory exactly. 'Maybe we can make him very drunk and get it out of him that way; he's hosting that Christmas party of his very soon so perhaps that's the night we should do it,' Harry suggested as he looked at Draco.
'It's Harry's jumper.'
Nothing had Draco remembered from his trip to the bottom of the Lake.
Exposing his hair to Harry felt like a huge step in their friendship, and to him it felt like a sign of trust. Wether Harry could understand that or not.
return; they quickly found out who helped him with that exactly and are taking all of those people in,' his mother explained. She wiped a strand of two-toned hair out of her face and balled her pale hands into fists. 'But he hasn't helped him return, has he? I mean—'
But he was only able to let out a soft whine.
"So good, Draco. It's so good." Harry praised under his breath and watched as Draco's innocent eyes peered in his direction, almost as if he heard his approval.
He was still able to recall the words Harry spoke when they walked through the open house. They were the only people in the vicinity at the time, not considering the realtor who was hidden away in the kitchen. They strolled through house making comments like, "when we have kids, they can use this room to play!" or "this would definitely be your office."
The movement of his palm faltered and the color on his cheeks deepened. "Just fine, Potter."
Draco tried so hard to keep the scowl on his face, but as soon as he saw the cheeky smile on Harry's face, his lips went against him and the corners curved upwards.
He remembered Harry joking the first time they heard Albus speak his 'name'.
"Up." Draco whined, pulling harder at his top, but it was not effective considering how weak he felt after the ejaculation he just experienced.
for Harry. He needed to be.
Harry, who looked like a deer caught in the headlights, could feel the beginnings of his own arousal as he ate up the delicious sight ahead.
"Mm—yes! Ready." Draco was a slut for Harry's magic abilities, he always has been whether it was the feeling of his magical aura when he was nearby, or the way he always seemed to flawlessly execute his charms.
Draco's heart fluttered at the fact that Harry was still using the pet names he called him during their impromptu play. It made the situation feel more real, and not like it was just a one time thing or that Harry was just using him to get off. It made him feel cared for and appreciated. It was all Draco could ever ask for.
"Harry! Please—nghh!" Draco cut himself off with a moan that got caught in his throat. In the midsts of Draco's whining, Harry lowered his wand, letting the dildo work for itself, causing it to collide with the now loose muscle between Draco's cheeks.
Ignoring Draco became arduous when he caught onto the small whine coming from his mouth. If there was anything Harry learned from knowing Draco for years, it was that he is incredibly stubborn and he hated not getting his way. In this case, he despised not getting an answer.
Draco leaned into his touch, nodding his head lightly against his warm skin. His cheek grew cold when Harry's hand left his face in order to fulfill his promise.
I need you to touch me.
"Yes, Harry. I'll be quiet, I promise." He quickly agreed and let go of Harry's hand so he could roam freely over his body.
"Give me a break. I was finally able to sleep well last night." Harry muttered back, matching Draco’s quiet tone. He bent over to take out an ink pot, a quill, and a few pieces of parchment from his bag and turned back to face the front to line the items up on the tabletop.
"Do you think you could?" Harry's hand faltered against the waist band of Draco's pants. Now that the idea was engraved into his mind, he couldn't seem to get it out.
He decided to sit back and enjoy the show.
The cogs in Harry's brain finally clicked into place as he mapped out Draco's movements.
"Me first, Daddy!" Scorpius chimed in mimicking Albus' movements.
Albus seemed to like that idea and so they started their little game of Merpeople.
"No! 'Corpus help me!" Draco mimicked with a wide grin plastered on his face directed towards Scorpius.
He feasted his eyes on Draco's cock, watching the way his glistening head rutted between his skin and the fabric. He was mesmerized by the way it slipped in and out from under his knickers.
Suddenly he became very aware of the fact that he was sitting in a bath with two 4 year old boys.
"So hot." He breathed out, not being able to tear his eyes away from Harry's lap. Harry teased at Draco's slit with the pad of his thumb, swirling around the bead of precome that spit out.
you're
"Up." Draco repeated, too embarrassed to ask for it. Harry knew he would be, but if there was one thing everyone knew about Harry, it was that he doesn't give up without a fight.
and it's related to the lily.
"Don't get all shy on me now. You've been asking for this for the past few minutes. I know how desperate you are for my cock, Draco." Harry's voice seemed to drop an octave and the vibrations made Draco moan.
Harry distinguished the slight outline of Draco's erection growing more prominent by the second and he forced himself to tear his eyes away from the image.
Draco couldn't help, but think. Coming up from the base were two tower like structures, made of blue and purple legos.
With every movement forward, Draco's erection rubbed against his skin, causing him to shiver in response.
"Harry." Draco drew back, breathlessly whispering his name. Draco on the other hand, still had images of Harry playing with his hard prick on the forefront of his mind. He wanted to show Harry how much he meant to him. He was never good at expressing his emotions with words.
to live with Malfoy, but for all the wrong reasons Harry never dared to envisage previously. But at least him and the boy got along now, that should be good for something, right?
Draco's right hand feverishly clawed at the air before coming into contact with the sheets and gripping onto the silk in an attempt to stabilize himself. He was up to three fingers now and his body was greedily devouring them all.
Draco crawled out of the way to let Harry comfortably situate himself and patiently waited, readily eying his cock.
It was a deep shade of red and Harry could tell just by looking at it that it
And with that, Draco drew in a deep breath and sat up on the couch, placing the book beside him.
He could feel Harry's hearts beating underneath him, drawing more attention to the reality of the situation.
His hip movements grew spastic as his prick jerked across the hair covered skin. He was a moaning mess, which was doing a number on Harry's overwhelmed erection.
It was clear that Draco was lost in his own world of arousal, completely forgetting the location they were in. A wave of panic crashed over Harry and his whole body went hot. He acted quickly and clasped onto Draco's wrist, putting a stop to his careless motions.
"What's got your knickers in a twist? It wasn't like I made a joke about the birds nest that resides on your head." Ron questioned, adding a cheeky remark at the end. It wouldn't be Ron without a tantalizing comment. All in good fun, of course.
This is it. This is where they are going to be caught.
"Sorry mate." He shrugged, his head hanging low with guilt. On the contrary, Harry didn't like how his friends had to walk on egg shells around him because they were afraid of triggering him. They should be able to rile each other up and poke fun, but instead they're always hesitant.
"I think I'm quite cozy on the floor here." His hands fell from Draco's cheeks to rub circles into the carpet beneath him. He knew this would frustrate Draco. All of the years of bickering and learning how to get under each other's skin was starting to come in handy.
"Hey, over here." Harry whispered, placing his index finger against Draco's chin and gently guiding his head back towards him.
His mouth found its way back to Harry's member and it immediately closed around the head, his tongue back to lapping up the sweet flavor of Harry's pre-release.
He sensed the change in texture when his palm reached his lace knickers. He let his hand linger over his bulge for a moment, tickling the head with the pad of his finger. A wave of moans drew out of his own throat and his legs dropped from above him and on to the bed, his skin rubbing against the silk sheets.
"Shit." Harry cursed, overly aroused by Draco's words. It was all too much for him. Draco eating him up like he was starving, him savoring every last drop of liquid that dribbled down Harry. It was so hot and erotic, Harry was sure he wasn't going to last much longer.
He didn't have the heart to tell Scorpius that Harry wouldn't actually see his dance. He prayed to Merlin and anyone else listening that Harry would go along with it. He could be quite dense sometimes.
Moving his ears away from the source of the
The boy's light headed movements were sluggish as he returned to his previous position on his back. Sweaty tufts of blonde splayed across the emerald pillow case that was propped up against his headboard. The subtle leverage of his head granted him the alluring view of Potter.
The delectable whimpers pouring out from Draco's throat was music to Harry ears. He loosened his firm grip on his cock and lightly shook it around, focusing on the feeling of his sensitive head tapping against his shirt.
"Draco, what the fu—"
"I'd rather keep to watching you. It's what I do best."
Draco's foggy eyes met Harry's through the gap between his legs. They were now fully unbent and lifted high above his head. Draco knew it would hide the view of his cock from Harry while he slipped his panties off. He knew it would drive him
"Can you lie down on your back?"
"I'll try." Harry chuckled, knowing it was inevitable that Draco would find himself left alone with the kids once again.
"Harry." Draco whined, drawing out the last syllable of his name. He was achingly hard and desperate for Harry's touch to be back against his thigh.
. Whatever you need, it's yours."
He leaned in and placed a soft kiss on Draco's nose, not being able to resist the urge. At the same time he reached around Draco's backside and pinched his cheeks. Draco jumped back with a yelp and scrambled down towards Harry's legs.
"Want your cock." Draco mumbled, still looking down at the sheets. His grip on Harry's shirt tightened, eagerly pulling at it once again.
"Come here." Harry gestured towards Draco, who looked pretty content where he was, gently twisting away at the wiry curls.
"No one will be saying that word, ok Albus?"
Harry could sense how plump Draco's cheeks were as they slid across his unclothed skin. He was hit with the sudden temptation to grope them in his palms and knead his bum until they turned crimson under his touch.
After a moment of regrouping himself, he sauntered across the tiled floor of the kitchen and carried himself out through the doorframe with ease.
His tongue swirled around the digit, greedily licking up Draco's salty arousal. He quietly let out a moan of appreciation before popping his thumb back out. He continued to clean up all of his fingers and Draco's eyes absorbed every erotic movement.
"Up you get!" Draco's ears caught on to the soft laughter lingering below. Albus wriggled his bottom closer to Draco's leg in order to latch on tighter. He wasn't going
These days it was incredibly rare to stumble across the famous Harry Potter roaming the long corridors in the ministry and Draco preferred to keep it that way, although he had a feeling they would be seeing him more frequently in the future.
"Papa, no! You have to pretend, ok? Me and 'Corpus are bad guys. You aren't 'upposed know." He explained. "Got it?"
Who was Harry kidding, Malfoy wasn't even an insufferable git anymore. He just pretended to believe it so he could stop fantasizing about what other tasks Malfoy's mouth got up to other than blabbering nonsense.
He was almost just as loud as Draco, grunting and spewing out praises directed to the boy pleasuring him.
He stroked his hand along Draco's spine until his fingers grazed upon the short hairs on his neck. he brushed through the knots until his hair felt soft to the touch.
He shifted uncomfortably on his stool, subtly trying to rearrange the placement of his erection so it wasn't straining against his pant leg. Something about Draco's low tone was not helping his problem in the slightest.
Draco's erotic gaze had Harry stuck in a trance. He wasn't able to do anything, but gape at the filthy movements Draco was performing on the bed.
were slightly more important.
The idea dawned on him quickly and he bit back a smirk. He reached over and pat Draco's upper thigh in a friendly manner, before giving it a light squeeze.
Harry poured a decent amount of the sticky liquid onto his hand and lathered up the silicon prick, getting it nice and wet for his
And even though he still executed his infamous eye roll, he couldn't help but grin down at the ink painted parchment placed in the palms of his hands. It all just
"Wouldn't dream of it, Malfoy." Harry chortled back and Draco slowly removed his hand. Harry followed suit, detaching his own contact from Draco's erection. Draco whined softly in displeasure, ready to seize Harry's hand once again and position it back on his cock.
"—and then Prince 'Corpus will come in? Got it now Papa?" Albus finished and Draco realized he just missed the whole of Albus' explanation.
"I know how it feels, Iggy." He breathed out and stepped over her, making sure he didn't stumble over her again.
"I thought you came here to be a Prince? You're already one?" Draco hesitated. He has never felt so lost in his life.
"Harry." Draco tried again. When he didn't receive a reply, he leaned over and snatched the quill right from Harry's hand, snapping it in half. "Listen to me."
Harry felt the hand detach itself from his and he heard the screech of the stool slide out as Draco sat himself back down again.
Previously, Harry would have been livid if he was ordered to sit next to
Draco nodded excitedly, instantly getting to work. He took a moment to gather up the blankets so he could bunch them up beneath his crotch.
"So beautiful, my love. You did so good. Shh, my sweet boy. I've got you."
The only noise Harry could hear was the muffled requests coming from Draco, but he didn't understand a single word he was saying. The sight made him laugh inside of his mind, but he didn't dare to let it sound out loud. He knew it was hard enough for Draco to vocalize his desires, and he wasn't going to make him feel even worse about it. Even if it was a humorous sight to behold.
Draco's body shivered, the erotic words slipping off Harry's tongue were definitely taking a toll on him. Draco's moves were hesitant. Harry was definitely the one with all the confidence in the room right now. He pushed the thought to the back of his mind though, knowing it would only cause him to spiral if he dwelled on it for too long. He
"Almost got it, Harry! What an extraordinary guess! The last thing you would need to do is, most obviously, cut it at the base of the root."
His fingering on the page was more harsh than the previous soft flicks of the parchment between his fingers. He didn't even realize his change in movement until he felt the paper rip beneath his grip.
"Hurry!" Albus held his arms out in front of him and grabbed at the air in Harry's general direction.
Draco's breath caught in his throat and he let out a strangled moan, arching his back against the bed.
Harry presumed that he would stick his nose in the air and tell him, 'please cease your idiocy for the next hour so I can attempt to retain the information being shared.'
Draco cried in frustration, dropping his face into the bedding keeping his bum high in the air. His head rolled to the side and he rested his check against the soft fabric beneath him.
Draco arched his back into it, lifting his arse up high before humping back down. He could feel the slime of his own pre-come coating the sheets underneath him, creating a slippery friction.
Harry didn't have a direct view of what he assumed would be a glorious sight, but still, the image of Draco laying on his stomach and knees with his arse propped in the air was doing a number on him.
"Need you." Draco reached out his arm in front of him, grabbing at the air towards Harry's cock. His hand hovered a foot away from where the boy was lounging back in his seat.
The worst aspect of the situation, Harry concluded, was that he had no time to rid himself of his morning erection. With every step he felt his prick rut against his trousers, teasing him inappropriately. It was not the time nor place to be aroused and Harry was well aware of that.
So in the end, he would do it all again if it meant he was to be blessed with two wonderful boys and one handsome husband.
"No, I guess not." Draco breathed, his voice timid and small. Harry could sense that Draco was unsure with himself. Even though he agreed with Harry, he still made no effort to act upon the aching lust he felt.
Draco's head whipped towards the front of the room, ripping his eyes away from Harry. Harry's thumb faltered for a moment before continuing to tease the cockhead between his fingers.
He silently reprimanded himself for feeling aroused because of someone else's distress.
Harry's eyes met Hermione's for a brief moment and her face held a confused expression. He shook his head to brush it off, but she still looked deep in thought as she turned back towards the front.
Draco grabbed ahold of Harry's hand and placed it back where it was just moments ago. His own hand held Harry's down, trapping it so he couldn't move away.
And that's exactly what he did.
Harry stared straight at the moving photos Slughorn was presenting and he could feel the heat of Draco's glare on his face.
"Fuck Draco, such a good boy. Doing such a good job. Fuck." Harry breathed, letting another moan rip out of his throat. The feeling of Draco's tongue slithering around his length alongside the feeling of Draco's cock rutting against his leg was overwhelming.
This intense craving and need to be loved, not just by anyone, but by Harry, has been brewing ever since the day he met the small boy on the Hogwarts Express, he just didn't understand it then. It just made him angry.
"Touch me. Need to come."
"I have to write to Dad, Scorpius. How will he know how much fun we're having if I can't tell him?" He hoped the mention of Harry would reroute the boys focus entirely. It usually always did when Harry had to go the Ministry for day. They were so used to having both parents in the house.
There was precome on his trousers and where his cock continued to tap against his shirt. He must reek of pure sex and knowing that others could probably smell him, made him even more painfully aroused.
They were all seated at the stations in front of his and Draco's, leaving a row of empty ones in between. It was normal for Draco to situate himself in the back of the room. He preferred to keep a low profile nowadays.
. I'll take care of you, yeah?" And with that, all of Draco's worries drained out of his body and were replaced with a deep unfamiliar feeling that painted his skin with gooseflesh.
"Harry. Close." Draco trembled and Harry's eyes instantly fell down to the prick in his hand to watch his sweet release.
the greatest wizard of all time.
Dousing his cock with more lube, he grabbed the base and squeezed firmly causing him to let out a strangled cry. With his opposing hand, he trailed his fingers up his shaft, pressing his thumb on the nerve point just under the head.
"Ok, Papa. I sorry." Albus apologized and his joyful splashing faltered.
"Great." Harry quickly peeked at the rest of the room before noting that nobody was paying them any mind. He acted fast and placed a brisk kiss against the corner of Draco's mouth before pulling away completely.
His eyes flutter shut, the last image of Draco imprinting on the back of his lids. He's so close, just a few more strokes and he would be coming, coming and—
Harry when he got home.
"You try standing in front of an audience fully erect while making eye contact with a man who's masturbating to the sight of you." Draco said while fumbling with the fly on his trousers.
He let spit leak past his lips and the warm bubbles ran down Harry's erection. It shuddered inside of his mouth and Draco whimpered in response.
I swear to Merlin himself, if you don't get your hands on me in two seconds—"
"It looks incredible, Scorp." Draco smiled, rubbing his hands back and fourth on his thighs. He focused on the rough material of his trousers underneath his palm. He continued this action until he felt himself coming back to the ground, further away from the episode he just experienced.
"Yeah, I guess." He said, absentmindedly tickling the end of his quill against his bottom lip. His eyes flickered towards the other boy and he noticed that Draco's gaze was drawn to the movement. He shook himself out of his trance and his eyes jumped up to meet Harry's.
"Soil your trousers. Come untouched. Do you think you could?" Harry questioned, eager to know the answer.
"Ok, ok, I'm sorry." Harry held up his hands in surrender and that goofy grin featured on his face once again. "It's only me, remember. You can tell me what you need and I'll give it to you. I'm not going to make fun of you for it." His joking tone shifted into one more serious, letting Draco know he meant every word he spoke.
"Yes, mon petit Prince?" Draco responded, seamlessly transitioning from English to French.
"I am not going to feed Mr. Malfoy to a throng of angry wolves, Mr. Potter. You are the only one I can confide in to ensure his safety. I assumed I could trust you with a task as great as this, was I wrong?" Was all she had to say to shut Harry up. He had something to prove now and he wasn't known to ever back down from a challenge.
"Fuck, even your magic feels
And each time their eyes locked, Harry's chest felt so warm that it suffocated his insides. He was falling for the git and nothing in his life would've prepared him for that.
Draco felt like an
"Such a pretty cock, Draco. Wish I could see the rest of your body. Want to see your pretty little hole clench around the air, begging for my cock." Harry's voice was hushed, almost inaudible in fear that someone would overhear him, but it was still loud enough for Draco to pick up on his seductive words.
The small blissful smile across Draco's face as he looked up at Harry with wholesome eyes was what almost made Harry succumb to Draco's wishes.
Draco felt himself let go completely, not letting himself be embarrassed by his actions. He propped himself up on his knees with his arse still high in the air, while the side of his face pressed into the mattress. Harry's view just kept getting more glorious by the second.
"Yeah?" Harry replied, now rubbing soft circles on top of the fabric with the same finger he was using previously. He wasn't directly touching Draco's erection just yet, but it was enough to tease him.
"I just think it would be very unhealthy for you to not relieve yourself of that tension, that's all." Harry's voice was lower than usual, more ravenous. There was no hiding the fact that he was genuinely feeling aroused, even in Draco's hazy state he could recognize that.
Harry clicked open the lid to the lube and directly spilled it onto his angry head. The contrast of the cool liquid as it hit his heated member sent waves of pleasure up Harry's body. He took his prick in his right hand and stroked it up towards the head, letting the pad of his thumb circle his slit.
Without wasting anymore time than he already has, he let his fingertips graze his skin as he slid his hand over his stomach, making his way down his pale physique.
"Hey! Mine!" Draco whined, crawling back over to Harry and slapping his hand away selfishly. He was offended that Harry would attempt to ejaculate and take it all for himself. Draco has been
"Fuck Harry." Draco moaned as his hard prick bobbed from from its restraint, bouncing against his school uniform.
"You started it here, you end it here. Please, for me Harry?"
Draco laggardly worked his mouth lower, letting his tongue explore the new territory. The tip of his nose brushed against his hand he had wrapped around the base and he pulled back up, sucking his cheeks in.
"What the
"Hermione didn't finish her revisions. Someone contact the Auror's, this is an emergency!" Ron dramatically gasped, his hand holding his chest in despair.
There was a cough towards the front of the classroom that caught Harry's attention and he turned his head towards the source of the sound.
"I am a grown man, thank you very much!" Draco lifted his arm and lightly punched Harry's shoulder, which only catered to the fact that he
"Mr. Malfoy. Come up closer to the table, I promise, it doesn't bite. Only unless you want it to!" Slughorn joked, being the only one to laugh at his attempt at comedy.
"Oh my—
"Gods Draco—You don't know how many times I've—" He cut himself off, choking back his spit, and then continued. "I've thought about this for so long. You for so long—Merlin you're gorgeous, Draco. Look at me, my love."
"That's quite alright, boy! I'll be here to walk you through it." Professor Slughorn grinned back and gestured for Draco to accompany him in the front of the room.
He caught a glimpse of Harry's arm jerking discreetly and Draco's legs instantly felt like jelly.
"Gods yes." Draco moaned and with that he leaned forward to get a taste of his craving.
since the incident and he still found it funny?) and blew raspberries on the soft skin just above his belly button.
Draco melted into his stool and his hand attached to his forgotten cock, not being able to disregard the aching need for attention any longer.
" Draco moaned and Harry raised his eyes to meet his.
"In you go, boys." Draco gestured, still feeling slightly annoyed with himself that he agreed to this. '
!" Albus screeched, still splashing around and unraveling into a fit of laughter.
"What are you doing?" Draco hesitated, staring at the other boy with wide eyes.
He maneuvered around Draco's body, settling himself back in the same position he found Draco in when he entered their room. Images of Draco withering on the sheets ran through his head like a flip book and his hand automatically drifted down towards his erection.
The warmth of Draco's mouth was intoxicating to Harry. Amazingly for him, Draco loved having it there. His tongue tickled every surface and swirled laps around the inflamed skin. His taste buds were on high alert, taking apart and examining every unfamiliar flavor.
"Look! 'Corpus! I found Iggy! See?" He beamed, shoving the pink ball of fluff in Scorpius' face causing the poor boy to go cross eyed.
the feather dancing across his lip.
Harry, on the other hand, was loving every moment of this situation as he pumped a tight fist over his cock.
at it too. He needed to get Harry to budge.
They already finished devouring their meal (with a fourth of it still on their faces), and Draco decided to get a start on creating Harry's plate for when he arrived home. A simple task, really. At least that's what Draco thought it would be. '
"They get stepped on!" Draco's voice roared and bounced off the walls. He shifted his weight to his left leg and hovered the other one over Albus' stomach as if he was about to squash him.
Harry was mesmerized by Draco's hands, he always has been. But seeing them disappear inside of him and come out slicked in lube was by far his favorite state he's ever seen them in.
The feeling of dread turned into embarrassment and he could feel his face suffering the consequences. He silently pleaded that Hermione wouldn't notice his newfound flustered state.
Harry gave him a week before Draco found himself back in the same situation again.
Harry's fist twisted along Draco's length, coming almost fully off of it before plunging back down. The hand on Harry's thigh subconsciously inched towards Harry's balls, desperate to feel the heavy warmth in its palm.
"Ah yes, the draught of living death." Slughorn remembered upon looking up at the projected photo on the screen.
The sounds that filled the room were exceedingly indecent. The slapping of skin coming from Harry, the slick wet squelches echoing every time Draco sat back on the phallic object behind him. Not to mention the incoherent babbles spewing out of Draco's pretty lips every few seconds.
They laid like that for a few minutes to regroup themselves, but soon Harry grew awfully uncomfortable with the feeling of Draco's cold come against his leg. He wordlessly summoned his wand and casted a few cleansing spells, making sure the other boy felt as clean and comfortable as possible.
Harry's hand traveled towards the button on Draco's dress pants and he swiftly unhooked it from its loop. The noise from the zipper sounded deafening in the mostly quiet room. It was almost as if it was trying to inform Slughorn about the indecent behavior taking place in the back of his classroom.
"Daddy!" Albus cheered, frantically swimming to the edge of the tub to get out and greet him.
Harry ran his fingertips over the outline of Draco's bulge and he watched as the boy shuddered underneath his touch. Harry was truly fascinated by the way he was able to make Malfoy melt with just a simple caress.
Slughorn gave him the most peculiar expression, his top lip twitching with curiosity.
"Turn yourself over for me, I want to see that brillant arse of yours." Harry ordered and Draco obeyed. He naturally pushed his bum up and wriggled it around. The thong to his panties caught between his cheeks and rutted against his pink hole. It made his whole body tremble with pleasure.
The fluctuation of his sing song groan brought Draco back to earth. It was then when he began to remember why he was in the bathroom in the first place.
Harry slid his hand further up Draco's leg, pausing where the inseam of the trousers met at his crotch. He gently tapped a finger against the stitching and Draco swallowed back a groan.
Harry's mouth watered when he noticed the pre-come dribbling onto Draco's skin. He had the sudden urge to lap it all up with his tongue, but he suppressed the feeling.
"Draco, we're in class." Harry said, although he didn't exactly
Draco's inner self spoke and Scorpius clambered towards the couch, carefully holding his masterpiece in his hands.
"No, it wasn't. Those little guys are a riot in the tub, I will admit. It is true that I have a hard time saying no, though. I guess that's one parenting trait I latched onto from the great Lucius Malfoy." Draco joked before going wide eyed with realization
The base of the creation was built with all different colored legos, not having any real pattern to it. '
He's had some pretty ludicrous ideas in the past, but Harry thinks wanking in the back of a classroom takes the medal for his worst.
He noticed how his head hung low and how his face was beet red. His eyes scanned lower down his body and stopped at his hands. They were still sat atop his groin, but instead of twisting his fingers together, they were now pressing against his crotch.
"That was pure
, and sure enough there they were. '
him, especially after he had his talk with his kids.
"Are you alright?" Harry finally spoke up and swiveled his neck towards Draco to give him his undivided attention. Harry devoured the sight in front of him, looking for any hint to help him solve the boys distress.
Draco used his left hand to swipe up as much of the viscous liquid as he could. At the same time, he brought his knees up towards his chest and spread them wide, letting his legs hang comfortably in the air. His most vulnerable parts were on display for Harry once again, still hidden under a thin string of lace.
With a little help, he still let Harry lift him up and out of the tub and their two brats instantly latched back onto Harry like leeches. Harry picked up the last towel and wrapped it around Draco's shoulders, repeating the same exact process he went through with his kids.
Tears of happiness, tears of affection, tears of adoration.
Where Draco had the opportunity to bother him every hour with obscenities.
He was growing grumpy quickly. He was sexually frustrated and Harry was not cooperating with him.
He felt proud of himself when he heard a low groan coming from Harry's direction. Unable to hold them up for much longer, he let his legs fall to the side and his extremely erect prick was now on full display.
Even with Harry's reassuring words, he was still quite embarrassed to express his wishes out loud. He rolled his head off of his elbow where it was propped up against and stuffed himself face first into the covers.
"Mine too! I made you and Papa!"
The ritual he did with the kids wasn't something Draco ever partook in. It was Harry's special greeting for them and he never found himself on the receiving end. Harry's moves were graceful and gentle, and he understood why the kids loved it so much. He felt special.
"Harry." Draco whispered against his neck, breaking the silence of the room. Harry shushed him, knowing he was going to want to talk about what just happened.
Harry drew lazy circles on the back of Draco's hand, slicking it up with left over lube and pre-come. Draco's own hands were fairly dry at this point, but Harry still noted that he was holding onto the hand that Draco fucked himself with at the beginning of the night.
Harry stared down at their two hands like it was a foreign object. Yes, Harry was completely aware of what his previous actions meant, but he didn't believe they would go very far. He didn't consider the option that Draco would want
It was a difficult task though. If Harry could get away with it, he would be bending Draco over the lab bench and fucking him senselessly into the cold metal tabletop.
"Sweet boy, there's no need to be embarrassed,
"What are you playing at?" Harry's ears picked up on Draco's whisper, but he pretended he didn't hear the question.
"Stop marveling and fuck me with your fist already." His whine was soft and the tone of his raspy voice was doing a number on Harry's forgotten cock.
He quickly realized how off schedule he was when he stepped into the eighth year common room and noticed there wasn't a single soul in sight. It was then when his muscles began working on their own and they swiftly carried him to his destination.
Harry thought.
Draco sat achingly still, not daring to move a muscle. He desperately tried not to think about Harry's previous movement, but his breathy sigh was still echoing around in his head.
Harry could feel his body shutting down as the clock in the eighth year common room neared twelve. The thought of rising off the velvet love seat and carrying himself to his dorm sounded far from pleasurable, especially when Malfoy was behind those closed doors.
Harry's eyes honed in on the movement below Draco's waist and he let out a low possessive growl in response. "Come on, love. Did you already forget what I asked you to do?" Harry's voice was patient, but he definitely felt far from it.
"And this." Harry trailed off, his hot breath lingering on Draco's ear lobe. Draco swallowed heavily, feeling the flush of his skin run up his neck.
"Of course that's what you would focus on." Draco laughed, breaking his character of a damsel in distress.
"It's you and Daddy, see?" It took everything in Draco not to burst out laughing. '
"Fuck." Draco breathed as Harry slowly milked out the last of his seed into his hand.
"Of course, but sometimes even the big
in his life. His whole cock was glistening with a beautiful shine under the dim light of the projector.
"I love it." Draco made sure he looked interested enough for Scorpius' liking. He had an intense focus on keeping his laughter at bay. He blurred his vision in attempt to hide the image from his mind. He was so close to accidentally letting out a cackle right in his sons face and he wasn't trying to break any hearts tonight.
"I want you to come for me Draco. I need you to come for me, darling. I don't want you touching yourself, okay? Just let your hips do all the work."
Upon seeing Harry, Draco immediately forgot that he was supposed to be angry at him for swearing in front of the boys.
With shaky hands, Draco poured the sticky liquid onto his palm, not caring that it spilled over onto his sheets. He found himself staring at the pool in his hand for a moment, oddly fascinated by the beauty of its reflective surface.
With hunger in his eyes, he began crawling towards the edge of the bed, keeping his eyes on the prize: Harry's prick.
His grip tightened on the desk chair and he pivoted it around on it hind legs so that it was facing Draco's bed, giving him the best seat in the house. With swift movement, he slipped into the chair and spread his legs wide in a dominant position.
Harry finally let go of the softening prick and tucked Draco carefully back into his trousers, cleaning him up with a wandless cleansing charm before quickly fixing himself up.
"Hey." Harry cut him off. He took Draco's cheek in his hand and caressed the smooth surface with his thumb. "Of course I can do that for you, there's no need to worry. This is all for you, remember? I'm here for
His cock twitched in his hand as he stoked upwards towards the head, pulling his foreskin up in the process. It rolled over his cockhead, covering it in an erotic embrace.
He would reply. Draco knew this was probably not true—to an extent at least. The relationship they had through Hogwarts was something Draco still couldn't quite explain.
A trickle of pre-release beaded atop his slit at the sight and he massaged it in with the lube. He viewed Draco as his pale fingers wrapped around the lace that was hugging his hips. He took his time, sliding the knickers down painfully slow. Harry was on the edge of his seat in anticipation.
"Was it really all that bad? I mean you sounded like you were having a
Harry threw his head back and his skull collided with the plush pillow beneath him. His guttural moans cut through the humid air of the room as Draco continued to tease him.
The way he
His arms draped over the end of the bed and he rested his tired head against his elbow for support.
"You can grow them back. You are wizard Papa, did you forget?" Scorpius gazed up at him with the brightest smile across his face. Draco couldn't help but lean over and plant a wet kiss on his rosy cheek.
anymore. Potter already saw everything he had on display.
"I can't allow it! This is my Kingdom, Princes! You can not dethrone me!" Draco fought back, pretending to put effort into pushing his clingy children off of him.
take it.
"You're very talkative right now, I see." Harry laughed again and Draco felt the vibrations through the hold on his chest.
"I don't exactly remember, sir, but if I may guess, I would assume you would start by gripping it at the base." Harry lowered his fist around Draco's cock until he reached the base, giving it a firm squeeze.
!" Draco set his knife down on the counter with a long breath.
He rubbed two fingers down the front of Draco's cock until he reached his balls. He pressed into the heated flesh, feeling them move underneath his touch.
innocent lives.
Draco didn't like yelling at his boys, it reminded him too much of his own Father. Staring back at a frightened Scorpius made him feel like he was looking back at his own four year old self. He had to remind himself:
•——————•——————•
. I heard him when he got hurted!" Oh, he was going to
Draco grunted in frustration and stubbornly tugged at Harry's shirt. The only thing his gesture was doing was lifting the cloth up and exposing Harry's midriff to the room.
Harry had to refrain the urge to vigorously pump their cocks as the wet sounds would be a dead give away as to what they were up to.
"Wait! You have to examine it first! That's one of the most important steps! If the bean is no good, you'll soil your potion. We're looking for girth and discoloration, remember."
"There's no saving you now!" He bent down and scooped him up, attacking his round cheeks with a plethora of kisses. Albus' screams crescendoed into a thunderous roar and Draco began to hear faint ringing resulting from it.
as if the Dark Lord was the most
"You really know how to keep a dick wet,
He could identify the fact that they were still holding onto their sugar high from the chocolate he let them have hours before. He was just waiting for them to crash, which he felt might be soon considering the show of tears they're putting on right now.
His tongue ran gently over Harry's slit, lapping up the bead of pre-come that threatened to spill out. The bitter taste mixed with the salty flavor of Harry's sweat created the perfect concoction. Draco was salivating profusely.
"Let's start with the first ingredient, the powdered root of asphodel. You should have learned this in herbology, but I'll jog the memory for those of you who might've forgotten. It comes from the plant asphodel, also known as
The gesture was innocent, but at the same time so incredibly erotic that it made Harry's member twitch. It wanted nothing more than to be under Draco's touch.
"...right again Miss Granger. Moondew is used in liquid form as the next essential ingredient to the draught of living death. Can anyone remind us how we might prepare that flower?" Slughorn's voice was mere background noise, fading in and out of Harry's conscious.
"Harry, I said I'm fine." Draco snapped back, grabbing ahold of his robe and draping it across his lap. Harry furrowed his eyebrows in frustration.
"Albus! I save you, okay?" Scorpius hesitated for a moment and then he began to shift back and forth on his feet, thinking about his best plan of attack.
It wasn't like he had a big stomach, although that wouldn't matter to Draco if he did. What he did have was a small beer belly growing in and to Draco, it was all the more for him to love and cuddle with.
"Brat." Harry chuckled and subconsciously flattened his leg back down against the sheets.
The longer he viewed Draco, the more intense the feeling grew and he was oblivious to the origin of the pain.
He watched as Harry lifted himself up, his erection coming into view once again and it made Draco salivate instantly.
"It's good that you got some rest." Draco's whisper cut through Slughorn's voice and Harry's attention was instantly drawn back to him.
Draco let out a small cry of pleasure as a second finger entered him. He curled his fingers upwards, hopelessly trying to search for the bundle of nerves to send him over the edge.
"Stop." Harry heard a small whisper coming from his left and he was so overcome with relief that he almost stood up right then and kissed the very lips that spoke that word.
Draco looked lovely up there under the light of the projector, appearing almost ghostly as his pale skin glowed underneath it.
Draco's flaccid member began to pique in interest once again at the thought of servicing Harry Potter. Instead of dwelling in that fantasy, he decided to make it a reality and get to work right away.
"Did you fall inside trying to get them in?" Harry chuckled. He noticed the pink flush of Draco's skin, but he couldn't discern if it was from embarrassment or the warm bath water.
A hand on his wrist stilled his movements and Harry's whole body was consumed in hot fiery embarrassment. He was
His tongue darted out to coat his lips, preparing them for Harry's swollen cock. Harry was
Draco rode it out against Harry's leg, continuing to drain every drop of Harry's seed from his prick. The come felt hot on his tongue and it tasted utterly divine.
"It is best to not approach the plant until it is standing fully erect. It will comply to your touch more easily, giving you full reign to its root for harvesting." Slughorn continued to speak as Harry gently stroked Draco's erection through the fabric of his trousers. The boys hips bucked up in his chair, searching for more pressure to relieve the ache.
"Papa, come on!" Scorpius stood at his feet with his small hand held out to Draco's. "It okay, Papa. It will be fun." Oh how Draco hoped Scorpius wasn't lying.
Draco succumbed to Harry and finally crawled over top of him, relocating himself across Harry's chest. He snaked his arms around Harry's neck and hugged him tightly.
The whole bed started rocking back and fourth with Draco's body as he began to pick up the pace. His hips moved in sync with the silicon object, meeting it half way as it hit against his sweet spot every time.
"What a lovely lesson we had today!" Slughorn preached, signifying the end of class. Harry was aware that everyone around him was packing up, but for some reason Draco and Harry couldn’t tear their eyes away from one another. "We will continue where we left off next class."
Draco hoisted himself up onto his knees, straddling Harry's legs. He bent over at his waist and his mouth desperately searched for Harry's thick cock.
" Draco groaned and he let his forehead fall onto Harry's shoulder.
"I bet you would, my love, but that would be interrupting you from
"Look how wet you are." Harry said, fascinated by the slick shine that coated his full member and the string of cloudy precome that dangled from the slit.
"Iggy, Iggy! Fluffy, Fluffy, Iggy!" Scorpius sang out while bouncing on his feet in an attempt to dance. It was his go to dance move currently, but Draco wasn't sure if you could even call it a dance move.
Soon Harry was withering under Draco and his balls clenched in his grip. The white spurts of Harry's come hit the back of Draco's throat and he moaned at the taste. He suckled on Harry's opening and the second wave of Harry's ejaculation hit.
The hand that was around Harry's length dropped down to fondle his balls. This gave Draco's mouth access to the full length of Harry's phallus and he couldn't wait to sink further down on it. So that's exactly what he did.
It was the way his own cock twitched inside his jeans with every whimper that fell from Draco's spit coated lips. It was the way his voice enclosed around Draco's body as if they were ropes tying him to the bed while his words teased every inch of his skin.
"Daddy! That not nice to say, Papa says so!" Albus scolded, stomping his foot against the tile. Harry only laughed at his sons attempt to reprimand him.
Draco couldn't help but stifle a laugh at his sons pronunciation of 'Scorpius'. He knew they had to work on it, but Harry and Draco couldn't bring themselves to fix it quite yet.
Sure, Draco had no idea why Harry had such a reaction; he believed it was out of discomfort from him being so close, but that didn't mean it wasn't
And he wasn't.
"Papa. We Merpeople. Me, you, and 'Corpus." He stated, pointing to everyone as he acknowledged them. Draco instinctively turned to glance at Scorpius when Albus' tiny finger waved in his direction.
His hand wasn't even on it yet, but he could already feel the heat radiating off of his swollen flesh.
by the time the light permeated the room.
"Quiet." Harry warned and with that, he began working his fist around Draco's member once again.
Spreading his knees further apart, he slithered a gentle hand past his hard cock and pressed a single finger to his already pulsing hole hidden under the lace string. It didn't feel as pleasurable as it could have, considering he wasn't lubed up, but he mostly did it for the visual effect. He was putting on a show, was he not?
As he sank further into the kiss and felt the sudden stir between his legs, he was instantly reminded of his own arousal.
Draco mewled, still scraping the mattress with his feet and lifting himself of the bed. He dropped his hand to the side, obeying Harry's orders beautifully. His eyes were tightly drawn shut in attempt to ground himself.
lying next to him. Harry was tempted to point that out as well, but decided against it. "Sit up then, let's get a good look."
Harry snaked his hands around Draco's ribcage and settled them underneath his armpits.
Understanding where this was going, Harry wordlessly locked the door to their dorm and activated a silencing charm. Draco felt Harry's magic coarse through his body and he shivered as it caressed his skin.
turn off for them, as it rightfully should be. All good things always come to an end anyways, Draco supposed.
Harry plopped himself down on the stool adjacent to Draco's and carelessly dropped his bag on the ground. He subtly glanced down toward his lap and rearranged his robes to hide the bulge that was currently tenting his trousers.
"I don't want to hear a single word from you, alright? Do you understand me, Draco? Not a single sound from those pretty lips of yours." Harry warned and Draco's face instantly lit up. He wanted to chuckle at the humorous sight, but swallowed the sound back down before it could come out.
"I think I'm gonna call it a night." Ron announced, his words slurring drowsily. Hermione followed with a quick agreement, stretching her arms above her head and yawning.
Slughorn's giddy expression faltered when he took in Draco's appearance. He looked ill, sweat trickling down the side of his flushed cheeks. Slughorn brushed it off, knowing it could be quite humid in the back of the room on occasion.
He recklessly pumped into his fist, rocking his hips against his chair. His back arched into his slick movements and he let himself go, right in the middle of a potions lesson.
His legs grew unbelievably weak and they began violently shaking on their own as his bollocks drew up. His free hand grabbed onto them, massaging them with a heated passion and reckless drive.
"Yeah." Draco breathed out unsteadily. He felt the familiar nauseating clench of anxiety claw at his stomach. Draco didn't want to talk about it in the morning, he wanted to talk about it
They both remained silent afterwards, taking notes in their respective books. Finally, it was time to brew the potion. Alihotsy Draught, rather simple for his standards, Draco thought. It was ironic since inhaling its fumes induced hysterical laughter and Draco desperately needed a laugh right now. He hadn’t laughed since Voldemort had come back barging into his family’s lives.
Chapter updates may be sporadic but do stay tuned.
He had changed, both physically and in terms of behaviour. His skin was paler than usual, hair so blond it was almost white and he had grown much taller. He was less lanky and more buff, clothes fitting him perfectly. The elegance and pride he once carried himself with were nowhere to be seen. For a brief moment, Harry let himself wonder if Malfoy no longer saw himself on a level above everyone, but could not imagine his former arch-nemesis possessing even a shred of humility.  Harry knew his calm demeanour was all a facade, he was probably broken inside, just like himself.
Harry had spent his weekend cooped up in his room, only leaving once to find a book he needed as a reference for his Defence Against the Dark Arts essay. He had been feeling perturbed since he had yelled at Ron and Hermione on Saturday. It was unpleasant to have left that encounter on such bad terms with his two closest friends, but learning that their hatred of Draco was so strong that they barely even cared that the boy nearly
Slughorn raised his eyebrow questioningly but waved his hand in dismissal. The moment he did so, Draco sprinted out of the classroom and toward the bathroom, slipping on the smooth marble and bumping into walls in his hurry. No one could see him like this.
The hour flew by quickly and before he knew it, Potions was over. Harry picked up his books and waved goodbye to Draco, heading off for his next class. It was kind of Draco to back him up when he spoke to Murphy.
For a moment, Draco feared that he was going to bleed out on the ground again. This spell sounded far worse than Sectumsempra to him but surprisingly, nothing happened after he laid there waiting for a moment. In fact, he didn’t feel anything at all.
Draco stood at the sink, scrubbing his face and watching as the cool drops of water trickled down his face, tapering as it ran down his neck. The man he saw in the mirror had a calm, proud demeanour but deep inside, Draco could see the torn brokenness of his soul. The only physical signs that ruined the whole facade were his dark purple eye-bags and sunken eyes.
Potter didn’t say a word through the walk across the school, seemingly deep in thought. He was probably trying to figure out what kind of intent he had behind his curse. Whatever it is, Draco thought, it couldn’t have been anything good. Potter was clearly angry at Draco when he’d performed the curse, and Potter’s made his immense hate of Draco crystal clear many times through the years. Not that Draco cared, of course, whatever Potter felt towards him was the least of his concern right now. Unless it was directly tied to the pain Draco experienced earlier today, which he certainly hoped it didn’t.
His nostrils were flared and his knuckles had turned white from gripping the mug so tightly but Harry was not about to back down. He did have a few inklings of distaste for Malfoy, even though he had thought he had gotten over his hatred. Part of him needed to vent his anger out as the arguments he was having with Ron and Hermione were just too much to bear.
Making a decision, Harry cleared his throat. When he’d gotten Ron and Hermione’s attention, he spoke. “Look, guys, I know just as well as you do what Draco was like in the past. He’s still an annoying git, sure, but he suffered from The War too. He’s just as human as we are, and you should think about why you’d give no care at all to another person who nearly died.”
Draco’s thoughts were interrupted when he suddenly felt a stinging burn on his chest. He looked up to see that a younger Gryffindor kid he didn’t recognize had spilt his cup of warm tea on his shirt. The kid had clearly done it on purpose to spite him but Draco couldn’t do anything but tiredly glare back.
“You’re suffering from shock. Here,” She said, wrapping him in a thick blanket. She asked if he was going to stay with Malfoy and he said that he would.
As Draco began to stir his potion, he felt his throat clench up. He could only describe it as the feeling one got when about to cry and unable to speak. He coughed into his silk handkerchief, the itch in his throat too persistent to ignore. He was horrified to see flecks of vermillion dotting the pure white cloth. He began to cough violently, rasps shaking his whole body.
“Hold his hand for me, Mister Potter. I need some of your magic to help heal him and not interfere with the effects of the soulbond.”
The crowd went dead silent and the game stopped, all the players running towards the two boys. Harry sat up, frantically searching for Malfoy’s heartbeat and brushing the bloodstained silver hair out of his eyes. Thank Merlin, he found his pulse. Though it was weak, it was better than nothing.
Harry was his friend now, Draco reminded himself, despite how badly he had treated Harry in the past. This was already more than Draco could’ve ever wished for, and he should be grateful for it.
“You hit me with a curse you read off a random scroll? You’ve truly lost your mind!” Malfoy yelled, looking absolutely horrified. Bugger, had Harry said all that out loud?
“No worries, Honky. Just leave the food on my table, yeah?”
“Anytime.”
Malfoy could tell that Harry was staring at his arm and brought it down quickly and almost defensively, slinking into the carriage without a word with an obsidian coloured cat at his feet. He hadn’t realized that Malfoy had acquired a new pet. Harry had never seen a cat that’s looked so poised and elegant before. It was a very tiny cat as well, and much like Malfoy. Small but carrying a lot of grace. Harry gawked at Malfoy through the glass of the carriage’s sliding door in surprise. He had been waiting for Malfoy’s snide retort since he had spotted that pale, pointed face and felt a pang of disappointment when Malfoy had left without one. The sense of normalcy Harry yearned for felt even further out of his reach. Malfoy had never once walked away without having the last word, most often an insult aimed at Harry. The shutter of the blinds down the carriage window that Harry was mindlessly peering through snapped him out of his thoughts. Malfoy must have caught him staring again. Looks like Harry had to find another carriage for himself.
Draco shook his head, “Mine doesn’t look as cool as yours.”
Harry would’ve had to deal with Ron and Hermione sometime today anyway, seeing as they shared a couple of classes together. When Harry had chosen his NEWT level subjects, he’d wanted to share as many classes with his friends as possible - partly since Ron made boring classes fun and partly since Hermione would be able to help them both with their assignments.
Draco was pleased to see that he would be working alone for today as the seat next to him was empty. He would have to do twice the amount of work compared to everyone else but it was more than worth it to not have to deal with a pesky partner. Potions were his expertise anyway.
He left the bathroom, leaving Harry missing his touch. Was he actually attracted to Draco? No, he couldn’t be. This was just the result of curiosity and it meant nothing. Draco and he were friends now, nothing more than that. He continued to relax in the tub, closing his eyes and taking a moment to breathe after the hectic day. He stayed there until his food got cold, but it was alright. He just needed some time to think.
“Fuck it,” He said to himself, ditching the Snitch and diving after Malfoy. He was falling so gracefully, an expression of peace on his face and hair flying around gently in the wind. He was getting so close to the ground, Harry wasn’t sure he could save him.
Finally, Harry headed to Potions class with a small skip in his step, as he looked forward to seeing his partner. It was their first Potions class since the incident and well, Harry needed to catch up on what he had missed. He sat next to Draco, smiling and raising his eyebrows as a greeting before flipping through the pages of the textbook, waiting for other students to arrive.
“It’s the best I could do. Like I said before, the magic from the soulbond prevents me from fully healing him. I’ve done my best to heal the head wound, but do you want to hear what other conditions he’s suffering from?”
“I thought you weren’t like everyone else but you’re just the same. You think that you’re better than me and well, the truth is, maybe you are. But don’t make me the villain and cause of everything bad that’s happened to you.”
“Malfoy? You’re playing? Are you insane? Your condition…” Harry said while wiggling his eyebrows. He was obviously referencing the soulbond and his illness but nothing was going to stop him today.
“What the hell happened to you? He’s a Death-” Ron choked on his sausages mid-sentence, coughing violently into his plate.
“If you’re taking me to the hospital ward, I do not want anyone to see us on the way. Is that clear?” Malfoy commanded.
- suffering internal torment in Latin (we aren't sure about the accuracy though!)
“You called me Draco. Right now and back at the pitch,” He murmured, licking his lips to moisten them as he tried to sit up but ended up laying on his back, too tired to move.
“This reminds me of that time when you wore your Invisibility Cloak and dragged me down the hill,” Draco murmured, looking deep in thought.
Harry dismissed that thought. He’d rather be left alone for now anyway.
Malfoy stayed silent on their way to Flitwick’s office - the boy was probably tired from grumbling about Harry nearly killing him for the past hour. They had decided to consult Flitwick as Madam Pomfrey had confirmed that he had no classes to conduct this afternoon. The fact that Flitwick had a vast array of knowledge regarding charms was just a bonus.
Ron snickered and everyone at the Gryffindor table went on with their conversations, some still whispering about Malfoy and his public breakdown after the War. For some reason, Harry felt a sudden and immense need to stand up for the blonde. This wasn’t like Hermione at all to be this cruel, even to Malfoy. But then again, Harry reminded himself, people change.
His snark had seemed to return at the sight of Potter’s stare and he was going to take advantage of that. He wasn’t about to be belittled by perfect saviour Potter.
to you, Malfoy! How can you be sure that it was my spell? You could have had an allergic reaction to, I don’t know, the alihotsy or something!”
As the elf disappeared, Harry let Draco sling his arms over his shoulder and put on his shoes, leading him back to their rooms. As he led them up the stairwell, he contemplated taking him into Draco’s own room but in the end, settled on bringing Draco into his larger dorm. It was time for him to get rid of his unnecessary hatred for him and to move on.
Draco turned around to face Harry and his lips parted slowly. They made eye contact and Harry tentatively placed his one hand on Draco’s cheek and the other on the nape of his neck. They leaned closer to one another, tilting their heads slightly and Draco’s soft and flirtatious lips were centimetres away from Harry’s sweetly curved ones. Was this really about to happen? Harry thought. Was he about to kiss the person he thought he hated the most? They could feel each other’s breath on their faces, lips so near the others and just as they were about to kiss…
Luck was on his side and as the pair turned a tight corner, Draco managed to overtake Harry and his nimble fingers reached out to grab the golden globe when a Bludger came out of nowhere. He heard someone scream his name but it was too late. The solid ball slammed into Draco’s temple and another yell came from behind him.
They were silent once again, the only sounds in the room were muted scrubbing and an occasional splash of water. He let Draco rest his head on the crook of his shoulder and he washed with one hand, the other hand wrapped around the boy’s thin waist.
“I didn’t do all of
Harry sat up with a jolt, panting heavily as he blinked away the images of Sirius’ stunned expression right before he fell through the veil to his death. Lost, never to be seen again. He’d been afflicted with similar nightmares since the day they’d lost Sirius, but they seemed to be worsening as of late. He couldn’t think of the last time he’d woken up after a peaceful and full night of sleep since the War had ended.
As he ran through the hallways of Hogwarts, he heard Hermione’s voice call him from behind. “Harry, what was that back there?”
. Slughorn didn’t say anything to Draco before walking to observe another desk, lest Draco snapped back at him and caused a scene.
Harry stared at him in surprise, not expecting that from him. He nodded, dumbfounded by Draco’s proposition.
“As if I’d want to be seen around with a bloody blonde crumb!” Harry bit back.
“Yeah yeah, I know what you’re thinking right now but you’re no chicken, are you?” Harry teased, flapping his arms wildly as a friendly jibe towards Draco. He knew it was going to make Draco stand up for himself and was pleased with the response he got.
Just like that, Harry felt like he was back in the hallway, carrying a bloodied Draco in his arms as Ron and Hermione stared down at him, looking disgusted. A surge of white, hot anger filled Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes, unwilling to reply to his jibe. He subconsciously knew that he would accidentally let slip something bad and he didn’t want to ruin the lighthearted mood. Harry could sense that something was a little off from the way Draco’s smile momentarily disappeared. It could possibly be due to Draco’s misadventures and the things he had to do while working under Voldemort, such as the accidental poisoning of Ron and the cursing of Katie Bell. No, Harry told himself, the past is the past, do not let these mishaps ruin your impression and friendship with Draco.
“Voldemort. It was a punishment.”
Harry greeted Seamus as enthusiastically as he could manage, promising to grab a butterbeer with him soon. He headed over to Ron and Hermione who’d been staring at him ever since he stopped by the Gryffindor table and sat down opposite them. Ignoring the odd looks they were sending him, Harry looked over at the Slytherin table for a familiar blonde head of hair.
Both boys gaped at the professor in shock. Flitwick didn’t seem to notice and continued, “Don’t worry about it, Mr Malfoy. Since you know who the caster is, all you have to do is figure out Harry’s intent behind the curse. The curse simply amplifies it and hurts you until whatever Harry wanted is fulfilled. All you need to do now is figure out Harry’s intent and resolve whatever issue laid behind it, and the bond will be broken on its own.”
saviour of the Wizarding World we were talking about.
He’d spent his weekend trying to make excuses for Ron and Hermione’s utter lack of concern for Draco’s life, believing that they would’ve realised how wrong they were by now. Harry had felt the same about Draco once, but their recent encounters had changed his mind. Draco was just as much a victim of The War as the rest of them were, the physical scars Voldemort had inflicted on him proved as much.
Madam Pomfrey’s eyes widened and she magicked away the mess, giving Draco another healing potion to help with the nausea he was experiencing. She helped him sip some water and encouraged Harry to stay with him as much as he could. The closer they were, the less damage the spell would cause to Draco’s body.
“Fuck off Potter,” He snarled, climbing onto his broom and flying away.
Harry manoeuvred his way around the train carriages of the Hogwarts Express, trying to find an empty carriage so he could wallow in his thoughts by himself. Just as he was about to enter one, he spotted a familiar blonde. Draco Malfoy.
