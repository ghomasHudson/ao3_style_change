Severus, suddenly feeling older than he ever had before, rubbed his eyes with his arm, his hands still damp with the succulent flesh of aloe before turning his attention back to the bubbling cauldron in front of him.
"I am a bit nervous, but I'm no kid. I-," it stuck in his throat, but Harry went on, "I want to do this."
Draco giggled, before slapping his hands over his mouth, but Harry was left shaking his head in denial.
Snape rose from his seat by Draco's bed and both he and Harry left the infirmary, leaving the blond Slytherin to sleep.
"I don't know Harry. You've never been able to hold your liquor," Draco's voice bubbled with laughter, "I still remember that time you got all giggly after a few butterbeers, and I had to tell you they were non-alcoholic!"
"Piper. Leave the kid alone. If he can't eat anymore, he can't eat anymore," Paige said, grabbing Chris's sleeve and pulling him behind her as she let go of Severus and moved closer to the food.
Harry looked at him and Draco shrank back against the fiery look in his vivid green eyes. "You shut up. I'm not letting you die."
But in a way these dreams were worse. Harry always knew in some tiny part of his awareness that the nightmares Voldemort sent were outside of him, but these tortures came from his own life, his own heart.
Since that night Severus knew to be prepared. Whenever there was a long battle, whenever soldiers, students, died on either side of the battlefield, he would find Harry in his chambers, sitting in front of the fire.
Draco started sobbing and Harry wanted to rush forward, but he had to be sure it was true before he gave in and chanced his heart again, but as Draco' sobs grew harsher he began to mutter 'I'm sorry's' with every spare breath and Harry had to do it. He threw off the Invisibility Cloak and stepped forward into the firelight.
Together the group made their way back to his quarters and Severus offered both of them a seat as he settled on his wingback chair, wondering at how much had happened in one evening.
As soon as it was secure, Severus opened his mouth to speak, but before he had the chance the vampire cut him off.
"My head is killing me and I feel like I threw up an internal organ shortly after being electrocuted. Par for the course, I'd say." The bleached blond, Spike, grinned at that, and Harry went on, "Now what were you talking about before? Dragon?"
At the same time he saw the room, everyone in it saw him and Draco. Alex and Spike began whistling while Hermione was yelling for them to 'do it,' and 'take it off.' Her part-time job at The Meat Market had shown a marked effect on her normally sensible behavior. Finally the girl dissolved into giggles, as did most of the others and Harry burst into a fiery red blush as Draco pressed his face into his neck.
He wandered around the attic for a while, studying the dusty remnants of other people's lives and speculating on what the Charmed Ones and their family must have been like. Anything to keep a specific image out of his mind.
That night as the other workers made their way to the ballroom, Draco hid, and when the coast was clear he returned to the pump house and changed into the suit made to challenge the noonday sun.
Paige grinned wider, and opened her mouth to speak. Based on the grin and the light in her eyes, Draco shook his head, "You know what, never mind. I'm too young to hear about that kind of thing."
As Draco collapsed on one of the sturdier and more thickly padded chairs, a curious and sated smile on his face, Harry came out to a stuttering applause.
Severus struggled up from the pillows, pushing away Paige's restraining hands. "I am not vulnerable, Potter, and I will help you figh-"
Things continued in this fashion for months until one day the level of excitement in the castle spiked. Draco wanted to know what was going on, but since Harry was unavailable, he had to ask one of the kitchen crew. Moving furtively he grabbed the hem of a maid's shirt. She gasped in shock when he spoke, but then told him what he wanted to know.
The sound was harsh, grating to Harry's ears already ringing from the sound of explosions and endless screams, and in the moment, he wanted to kill the man for that alone.
When the young brunet white lighter wasn't hanging around to be at his mothers beck and call he was traveling through the demon realms. He said he knew what would turn Wyatt evil. And wherever Chris went, Draco was following.
"Bearskin, where have you been? The fire in the audience chamber has died and the prince and his advisors are cold."
Afraid I beefed it and posted chapter 13 last night in place of chapter 12..fingers crossed it is fixed now
Blaise had asked this question twice every day since he found out he was pregnant, so that had been approximately 64 times.
The young white lighter on the couch whined softly as Piper brushed his hair off of his face. A thin trickle of blood trailed down from his mouth, and Piper dabbed at it with a tissue.
The voice was soft and low, and it almost sounded like Narcissa. Lucius moved closer. The figure was still half-hidden in the shadows, but the form, slim and tall, was much like Narcissa's and they way it moved taunted him with memory.
"Everybody? Or just Severus," Phoebe asked, a wry grin making its way past the pained grimace on her face.
"I didn't know you were coming, but I recognized you as soon as I saw you and so could some of my customers if I hadn't had a friend of mine cast a glamour over you."
He looked at Draco, then felt the sharp sting of a slap as his face was whipped to the side. Pressing his hand to his stinging cheek, Harry looked at Draco, mouth agape, as the blond stood up.
Draco's laughter faded into harsh breaths that Harry felt against his skin and they stood there in silence faces only inches from one another.
A few moments later, and glass in hand, he returned to his seat and faced the now visibly upset Harry. "Perhaps I should. Perhaps that is my role, that of supportive mentor now that Dumbledore is dead. But I find I do not have the energy for it. I cannot give you reassurances or predictions because I do not know what will happen. No one does. Your friend Hermione has consulted the seers available, hasn't she?" Harry nodded his head. "And what has she found?"
Blaise was panting heavily, his face red-tinted and sweaty. Paige sat at his side, holding his hand and blotting at his forehead with a towel. Another towel had been laid across the couch, but Draco could see hints of a pinkish liquid seeping through the fabric underneath.
Pushing the door open wider, but still staying behind it, Severus said, "Still engaging in dramatics, Mr. Potter? I thought we had outgrown this sort of behavior."
A pregnant silence followed, each man picturing an endless, frozen future, one with hope that his protégé would never age, never die, and the other with dread of those same things.
Paige scrambled out of the entangled sheets at the sound of panic in the boy's voice. Grabbing her emergency kit, a vanquishing potion, two crystals, and travel sized packages of pain killers and hand sanitizer, just in case whatever it was blew up in a really messy way, she threw on a robe and she was ready to go.
Even in the face of mortal danger, Harry had to roll his eyes in the face of blatant cliché. "Yes, well, apparently it was destined, Tom. We didn't have much choice in the matter."
That was the main reason Severus had changed his focus to the subject in the first place. It gave him an hours long excuse to be left alone.
The Dark Lord held up his wand and Harry felt the hot sizzle of a cutting curse run across his chest, opening up his shirt and the skin beneath, but his momentum kept him moving forward and he fell on Voldemort, knocking him to the ground.
Ron, who had been dragged along as well, pushed past Harry. "Blaise? Baby, are you okay? Is it—Merlin, is it the baby?"
The room was tiny, maybe it wasn't a classroom, but some professor's quarters, back in the days when there had been more students, and more teachers needed for them. Tattered couches rested against the walls, and a small balcony opened out into the sky.
Granger and Neville were standing at the stereo, arguing good-naturedly over the music selection, while Spike and Alex swayed together in the corner. Their hands were wandering but Severus didn't want to know where they were going, so he averted his eyes.
Draco hissed as Harry wrapped an arm around his waist. His ribs were protesting fiercely. But even through the pain of his broken ribs Draco relished the warmth of Harry's arm around his waist and he indulged himself by leaning a little heavier on the green-eyed man as they walked towards a pile of rubble in the corner.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and thought about it. But he already knew what his answer would be.
Paige saw Phoebe's eyes misting up and she felt tears building in her eyes as well. It was just too tragically romantic.
After the vomit gave way to dry heaves, which faded slowly to deep shudders, he was able to turn and face the rescuer of his hair.
The war was going well, if any war could be said to. Attacks were planned meticulously by Ron and a crew of others, and carried out with a ruthless efficiency by Harry and his team.
Draco stepped away from the storm clouds of the impending fight and went downstairs. In the darkest corner of the basement he found his many-times removed uncle sitting cross-legged, a small blond boy perched on his lap. Draco smiled, remembering his own time in that position, listening to stories about love, and history, and epic battles in exotic places. Then he cleared his throat, "Uncle, you may want to return the boy before Piper frets herself into a heart attack."
Past the smoke, on the other side of the room, Severus found Zabini slumped over his work table, a cauldron sizzling beside him. From the smell, he almost knew what was brewing, and if he was right there were only a few seconds to spare before it would reach the most volatile point.
Harry pressed his ear against the door, but the music was loud and the bass was thumping, so he couldn't hear anything that was happening inside.
"Tomorrow, I think. I told Hermione and a few others that I was going in case they want to get letters together, so I thought I would extend you the same courtesy."
Though Blaise was known for his 'friendliness' he was a good bloke and he and Ron might even be happy together. The two had been sniffing around each other for years, but giving in to pale substitutes until now. Harry wondered how they had finally gotten together.
"Now, I notice you come from England , not that it wasn't obvious with the sexy accent and all," Harry blushed lightly as Alex went on, "but why did you move to the states?"
Draco felt another laugh bubble up in his chest, but it was beaten out by a strange ringing noise. Looking around the kitchen Draco didn't see anything that could produce the noise, but it was getting louder, almost painfully so, the sound vibrating the delicate bones of his ear.
Pausing, Draco answered Severus's questioning glance, "See, a 'chip' is a microchip, a muggle device, very advanced technology. It's a tiny bit of metal and plastic that is inserted into the brai—"
After a few minutes Harry looked up at Severus, the storm clouds in his eyes gone. "Did I really hurt him? Draco, I mean."
A head of platinum blond hair rested on the mattress next to him, and Severus patted the bed next to Draco lightly to see if he would wake.
Before Draco knew it, he found himself with his arms full of squirming toddler and his uncle nowhere to be seen. If he didn't know better he'd swear Spike had orbed, but the older blond had always been good at getting out of bad situations.
Draco turned away, staring at the embroidery on the quilt in his lap. "… I still have a link to Potter. I should have severed it when my assignment ended, but I—I wanted to be sure he was okay."
He opened his eyes but all he could see was white. There was a blinding light at the edges of his vision and as it cleared the whiteness came into focus.
The almost completely male crowd screamed as the sweat-shiny dancer onstage threw one glittering piece of spandex after another to their awaiting hands.
When Harry sat back into his chair, and Draco had had the chance to catch his breath, he said, "I had time to think out there, love, and I can't ask you to come out for me. It's not fair to you to lose the people you love. I can wait until you're ready. I'm strong enough, and if you don't want me anymore, well, I'm strong enough for that too-"
Alex leaned forward on the desk, motioning Harry to take a chair. Smiling, his regular smile now and not the insane rictus grin of moments before, he said, "Did you really think America was such a backwater that we wouldn't know who you are?"
Piper stood and rushed to the pregnant boy, "Nothing. We're just sitting. Why don't you go into the kitchen and have a glass of milk."
The vampire sighed, an ostentatious gesture for a creature that didn't normally breathe, and said, "Kid's name is Harry Potter. On a mission for The Order of the Big Sodding Bird. Bloke behind me with the sour face and pointy piece of wood is Severus Snape. The child in the corner is Chris. We need Potter's help."
He wasn't too hard to find, sitting on the old velvet couch in the attic with a small book in his hands. It looked like a photo album and as Paige got closer she got a glimpse of a girl with bright red hair before the cover was quickly closed.
"I wonder who he'll end up with this time. I believe it was Blaise last time, and Pansy before that. Or was it Pansy
Severus suspected that the short Slytherin had more lascivious things in mind, but he didn't care to think about it too much and refused to take any pictures that might even remotely be deemed suggestive.
Harrys' voice was soft and tentative. Severus beckoned him into the room, gestring for the boy to take a seat by the fire.
As the kitchen emptied again, Draco allowed himself a few brief moments to grieve. This was the last night he would be a prince. Once he left the ball tonight he would destroy the three suits and become Bearskin forevermore.
While Harry knew Ron had nothing against werewolves, he also knew that it would break the boy's heart. Weres couldn't marry, couldn't have children. Ron had been planning his wedding to Zabini for the past few months, and the family they would have afterwards. If that got stolen now, Harry wasn't sure what the red-head might do.
She orbed directly into the kitchen and found Wyatt's diaper bag right where Piper said it would be, on the chair by the door. She moved towards the kitchen doorway, but then she heard Draco talking and froze. The blond sounded upset. Paige assumed he was talking to Harry and decided not to disturb him, instead orbing directly to Ron and Blaise's room where Jamie's diaper bag was on the foot of the bed.
At this, Spike smirked and opened his mouth to speak before Chris cut him off, "None of this explains what you are doing in my family's house right now."
, in the tight grip and found himself facing Malfoy. Placing his hands, freshly buffed fingernails painted a deep indigo, around the blonds' waist, Harry peered through his artfully messy bangs at the other boy.
Harry took one and popped it in his mouth, enjoying the taste of lemon, pepper, and shrimp over the savory earthiness of the mushroom.
He knew what was coming, the Dark Lord was a predictable evil. Draco had been struck by the Killing Curse once before and it took his life then. Now it would take away this ephemeral un-life he had been living, but maybe...
"It would seem so," Severus said and walked over, his wand in hand. His eyes were soft but there was a businesslike expression on his austere face. "Blaise? Is it time?"
Voldemort was standing over him, and almost kindly expression on his lipless face as he held out his hand.
The man stalked forward, stopping just inches from the end of the wand, a bright amber light dancing in his eye.
And with that Severus could control himself no longer and he started laughing. After a few seconds Harry joined him and together they laughed until they were out of breath.
Some minutes later, exhausted and crying, he came back to himself again on the floor of the bathroom. He was cold and his hands were shaking. After his years of fighting he expected to grow past his fear of blood, but though the reaction had weakened, it never went away.
The closer she got to the argument, the better she could hear it, and the more she wished she had just turned around and gone back to bed when she had the chance.
Severus looked back at the picture, his eyes widening as he felt Paige press a kiss against his cheek.
The next morning came bright and sunny. Paige had tossed restlessly all night long, dreaming about war and green lights and a blond boy who was crying like his heart was broken. It was very disturbing and she hoped it wasn't an omen of a bad day to come.
"I'm not trying to. Is that what you want? Do you want me to tell you fairy stories? Once upon a time there was a boy named Harry Potter, who fell in love with his Guardian Angel. Against all logic, his angel loved him back, and the two of them lived happily ever after. The end."
A quiet snuffling sound drew his attention to the matching couch a few feet away and he saw Severus sleeping on the grey surface, a brightly colored afghan much like the one Draco had to push away, draped over the older man's torso.
Harry knelt down again to brush his fingers over Draco's cheek before rising and striding out of the Great Hall.
Turning to the woman who had been by his side since the day he was born, Draco said, "Are you sure you want to do this, Pomphrey? He will kill you."
The last was said in a whisper. Draco remembered now, those first few quiet moments where he could observe Harry and refix the image of him in his head, then when he woke up and they were Harry and Draco, friends and maybe more, before everything fell apart, again.
Paige shook her head, getting down on the floor to help Spike sit upright, "Yeah, sorry, it was an accident, I swear."
Paige was feeling a little uncomfortable as the frank way Xander looked her over, and she was thankful Blaise had given her a high-necked shirt.
Paige saw the brunette, Blaise, standing in the corner of the room, watching events unfold, "You know what happened, you said it was your fault. What was it?"
The dark haired man groaned and slumped in his seat and Paige looked away from her growing pile of orange peel to see him rubbing fitfully at his eyes. Setting the orange down, she looked at him.
Spike sighed. "He's an empath, love. He feels what we're feeling and the person he's closest to at the moment was crying, and then angry."
Ron nodded, grinning. "Me and Blaise have been talking about it for months. Figured it only made sense to name the kid after our best friends. James Narcissus if it was a boy, and Jean Parker if it was a girl."
Harry was finishing up at The Meat Market, giving the floor a quick mop before leaving when he heard someone banging at the back door.
The man's expression sobered and Severus watched a different face pass over the laughing one. Before the man had looked young, carefree, and vaguely threatening. Now he was serious and defiant, and most definitely threatening.
Pulling on the suit he felt like a ghost, like a spirit of the night. He felt beautiful. And with his heart in his throat he made his way back into the castle.
Bright orange sunset was streaming through the kitchen inches from his feet and Paige could see pale twists of smoke rise off of the vampire's boots, but he didn't back away.
Finally the suit was made and presented to the prince on the night before his birthday. In the preceding year Draco had received many presents from his father, but none so precious to him as stories about his mother. And with each story he received a token that belonged to the woman, a miniature golden spinning wheel, a tiny copper thimble, and on the night he was presented the shining suit of stars, a silver ring that the queen received from her own father when she was betrothed.
They left the boys alone, nothing could be done, and Harry wouldn't leave the blonds side. The green-eyed boy said something about 'weathering the storm,' and refused to leave as the wind howled around the Astronomy Tower.
Spike grinned at her, a flicker of shark sharp teeth showing through his human face, as he leaned back against the arm of the couch they were sitting on. "Well, pet, when a man and a woman, or a man and a man in a percentage of cases, or a woman and a woman for that matter, are in love, they…"
He didn't take the picture. He'd found it, or rather, it had been given to him in a plain white unmarked envelope slipped under the door of his quarters in Hogwarts.
So far he found out his boss was some kind of were-thing and knew who he was, he had been attacked by death eaters, he had been saved by Snape and a vampire, of all things, and now Draco.
Harry leaned in, letting Draco take a hot breath of his cinnamon scented shampoo and conditioner, and the sandalwood and orange cologne he had applied.
Six and oe haf days after Harry's return from California and subsequent collapse, Severus set a tray loaded with delicacies in front of the boy with a heavy thump.
Paige and Chris combined their skills. She had more natural whitelighter energy, including some healing power, but he had more knowledge of how to use it, so together they first evaluated Draco and found out he was mostly just drained and heartsick. He would recover with rest and quiet.
Draco nodded, his fists clenching at his sides as the guards moved forward to flank Severus. Silently they led the man out of the room, and after another kiss, the king followed.
Spike hissed at the brunette boy, cutting him off. "I don't want to talk about that fat bloody wanke—"
Harry yawned widely and looked for an empty spot on the table in front of him so he could put his head down. Another night of intricate and confusing dreams had left him half-asleep as he staggered through his morning ablutions and down to the Great Hall. All he wanted was to go back to bed.
Phoebe, recovered, glared at the vampire, and Paige said, "We can't think about this now. We need to figure out where Draco went and get him back. Fifteen, eighteen, or one hundred and two, he's our white lighter, and he's upset, and he could be anywhere.  Spike, you and Draco are friends, make a list of people he knows, or where he might have gone. Phoebe, you can scry for him. His jacket might still be in the closet, maybe there will be something there you can use. Piper, you can help Phoebe."
With that the blond turned and walked over to the couch not currently occupied by a furiously necking vampire and were-hyena couple.
But the fever had broken on the fourth night. Now the man was just sleeping, and so was Harry, one hand still clasped in his, head resting on the worn mattress.
"There, there, pet," Draco mumbled, rubbing the injured boy's leg gently. "You'll be fine and well in a minute. Just rest here while I go find someone to bring you up to the-" Draco turned to see who was available and saw Harry walking towards him. Seeing the Gryffindor covered in layer of dust and grime made Draco uncomfortably aware of his own appearance. "Oh, hey Harry," he said, standing up, nearly bumping into Harry as he did so.
The vampire grinned up at him, and pushed ahead until they found themselves in front of a large door. Severus watched Spike wave at it and with a shudder the door opened.
He arrived back at the Manor, slime free, to see Spike and Paige sharing the newspaper in the living room, wearing identical smiles.
"I'm sorry, I'm often told I take my responsibilities too seriously and I've heard such bad things about carbohydrates lately."
This time the third woman, a brunette with short hair, was the one to speak. "I'm Phoebe, that is my sister Piper, and my other sister, Paige." She said, pointing to first brunette and the red head in turn.
Draco was short. Not that it meant anything, as Harry was short himself, but the other boy still had the gangly arms and legs that heralded an impending growth spurt that would never come, and Draco's skin, so pale and smooth, would never need to be touched by a blade.
Severus knew Harry was still upset about Draco, and a part of him understood. But he knew his godson and if things remained like this between Harry and Draco neither one of them would be at their best. Severus could tell Draco was in love with Harry, at least as far as the blond understood the emotion, but judging by the green-eyed boy's behavior he wondered if Draco's feelings weren't returned after all.
At the far end of the infirmary was a curtain enshrouded cot and behind it Severus heard soft breathing in the otherwise unearthly silence of the normally bustling room.
The dour and dark-haired advisor flushed lightly. "In truth Lucius, Draco is the image of his mother, with her sweet spirit and quick wit. The resemblance is quite remarkable to see."
His voice had deepened into a man's round tones over the years, then grew harsher from shouting over the sounds of battle, but now it squeaked as it hadn't since he was the age Draco appeared now.
In her long conversations with the blond Paige heard the entire history of Harry and Draco, from their first meeting in the robe shop to everything that happened in the garden the night before Harry left. It was amazing that the two of them got together at all and Paige knew from Piper and Leo's example that it was difficult to have a relationship with a white lighter, but then she was sure it was hard to have a relationship with the Boy-Who-Lived as well. Still, she felt confident, knowing Draco the way she did, that if Harry felt half as strongly for the blond as Draco did for him, they would be together for a long time.
Dragging Draco's abandoned robes up around both of them, Harry transfigured two couches into a large fireplace and held on to his love as tight as he could. He knew they had to get to the Infirmary, but right this minute, he had to get Draco warm enough to be moved.
"Harry, you know we need an in here. Word has it that the owner knows everyone on the grey side of magical law, and Voldemort has been trying to get a foothold into America lately. If we can get close to the manager, we can get some answers, maybe a big advantage."
"What exactly happened? With Harry, I mean? Blaise told me we have a connection, and that's why something happened to me, but I don't remember anything."
Severus managed to reach them in time to hear Harry say, "I never wanted a lifetime with you either, you nasty little bastard," and watch him punch Draco in the face.
When he opened his eyes, which he'd closed in anticipation of a strike, he saw Chris staring at him quizzically, and then Draco gasped as the brunette white lighter pulled him close. In a shower of blue sparks they disappeared from the cave.
After a few hours, the boy remembered an appointment with Pomphrey, so Snape could finally sigh in relief and make his way to his quarters.
The bag reappeared in front of her and a cultured accent said, "I'm terribly sorry about that. Though I would be rather difficult to kill, unless… You're not a dark-lighter are you?"
"I meant my mate's place. Alex's club has an extensive underground level warded against everything up to and including magical and nuclear war."
Draco felt tears press and fought them back. "You may not die. The king is not so far gone into madness."
The thin reedy sound of a baby crying bled through the speaker on the coffee table, and Piper looked torn between Wyatt in his crib and the unconscious boy on her couch, so Paige stepped in, "I'll watch Draco and Blaise. You go check on Wyatt."
This wasn't a new situation; in fact it had become depressingly common over the past few years. So instead of reacting with panic he took a few deep breaths to keep the edge of the pain at bay and took stock of his condition.
Harry had watched the whole process with wide eyes. He knew the Slytherin was proud, but he still expected him to give up.
"A vampire, Chris? You brought that evil thing into our house? My house? Your brother is here, and he is a baby. Do you care at all? I can't believe you were so irresponsible!"
A feminine, thankfully, arm reached past him into the tortured luggage. "Here, Harry. Just wear those black jeans Draco bought you and this shirt," Hermione said, handing Harry a worn green tee shirt.
Draco nodded and took the bag he had prepared with the gifts and some food. Wrapping the bearskin robe around himself, he made his way to the hidden corridor Pomphrey had discovered months before, and without looking back he ran.
Harry sighed heavily and Paige felt tempted to do the same, but she resisted. "That doesn't mean we can't be happy. It doesn't mean we can't fall in love and get married and have children. I mean, just look at Ron. He's in love, engaged, and now they have that beautiful baby boy."
"Master," the female Death Eater said and as Harry looked over at her he saw her pointing past Harry, past Voldemort, to the blond figure in the shadows.
"No, they have to be tied to whomever is using the weapon somehow, though we didn't get much detail on that."
"Hey. Knock it off," Paige said, snatching the innocent banana to safety before slapping Spike's hand.
Ginny's mouth dropped open and she visibly forced herself to calm down, "The potion? How did you get it?"
The four wizards had been collecting information for just over a month. In all honesty Harry probably knew more about the sex lives of his co-workers at The Meat Market than anything else, but there had been hints that his manager might be more involved in the preternatural world than the one-eyed man let on.
Chris smiled like an angel. "You don't trust me?" He pouted, but Harry could see laughter in his eyes. "So come with me."
The voice was loud and it rattled his bones. Draco opened his eyes, carefully and painfully, squinting at the blurry pale figure before him.
The other men nodded, and Severus set his wand to detect magical signatures before taking down the shield and exiting the alley. Chris and Spike followed behind.
Severus grabbed a robe from his desk and threw it on over his muggle jeans and sweater, and followed the red-headed girl to his labs.
Severus was shifting slightly, Paige moved to adjust the blanket that had drifted down his chest, and a cold hand gripped her wrist in a steely hold.
She locked eyes with Spike before they both turned and ran into the kitchen, the vampire leaping over the couch easily.
And by the way, Godfather," Draco said with a smirk, "You will be explaining to me why you're complicit in the creation of a new generation of Weasleys."
Severus sighed, "Blaise, nausea is a natural side effect of pregnancy. It's the bodies' way of protecting the baby from harmful elements in your food. And as for your… chest. It is most likely a figment of your imagination as any… nipple sensitivity should not begin for several months—." The boy opened his mouth to speak, but Severus cut him off, "If it happens at all as most pregnant males never lactate."
Draco heard Voldemort shouting something behind him, but he couldn't turn, he had to try and figure out the machine. If they just destroyed it, even imagining that such a thing was possible, it would be the death of all of the wizards it was drawing power from, pulling them into the darkness with it. But how to turn it off?
As he disappeared in a shower of blue sparks, Harry could swear he heard Draco say, "I wish I could stay," but he couldn't be sure over the sound of his heart breaking.
Spike looked at her, meeting her eyes with a speaking glance before tilting his head in Draco's direction. Paige hoped Spike had an idea as she felt the air around Draco begin to crackle with tension and rage and trusted him, hitting Draco in the back of the head with her emergency kit, which contained several heavy bottles, charmed to be unbreakable.
Paige pulled her arms back as Draco stood up straight and moved closer to the blond vampire, a long thin stick in his hands. Paige wasn't sure what he meant to do with it, but there were very few options at the moment.
Moving towards the tent, Draco looked for an opening of some sort. Not seeing one, as he got closer, he pulled out his pocket knife. The Swiss Army knife was a death day gift from Spike and it had a knife blade and a saw. Draco picked the knife blade and pushed it through the thick canvas wall of the tent. It slipped in easily enough, and he switched to the saw blade to cut through the fabric and open a hole big enough to get into.
Even as Draco registered what he was seeing, that he was caught, he saw Harry jump from his knees and lunge at Voldemort, knocking him to the ground. As soon as he was down, Harry turned to the Death Eater.
It was a miracle that Draco had survived the exposure, barely breathing and with only a slight, soft heartbeat, he had developed severe pneumonia in the Infirmary, tossing in fever and nightmare for days.
"No, Dragon, it's just an exceptionally detailed and realistic dream." Severus saw the woman, Paige, smile slightly, and Draco seemed calmed.
"Ah, nephew. You can't take it so hard. My XanPet broke my heart a hundred times and look how happy we are."
"Werewolf attack." Neville's even voice came from behind Harry. The brunette turned to see his friend walk out of the bathroom, a dripping washcloth in his hand.
"Tell me what is going on, Harry. What changed you so much, you never said. I tried asking Paige, but she doesn't know, and Draco-"
He turned to face Severus and his relief faded. Though the man was more physically relaxed there were lines of tension on his face, and he was still absently rubbing his forearm.
Harry's face turned tomato red from laughing so hard and Paige had to pull over to the side of the road until he could catch his breath. Slowly his laughter died away, but Paige felt her own smile fade as the laughter turned into heaving sobs.
With a smile on his face, Harry closed his eyes and pictured the Halliwell house and a small niche just off the living room.
He took a few steps out, waiting for a break in the conversation the blond was having so he could jump out at him.
Draco looked alert and healthy and if she hadn't seen it for herself she would never believe that just twelve hours ago he was having seizures.
They looked into the shifting distance of a grey sky peering through the black trees of a snowy wood.
As he made contact with the calloused hand, he felt the same sharp sting he had felt the first time he touched Harry go through his palm.
Piper swallowed her complaint and stared into her juice as Paige set the can of soda on the counter and turned back to the fridge to find something breakfast-food-shaped.
Harry no longer visited Severus's quarters in the evenings, though the potion's master heard about the toll of the war o Harry. According to the House Elves he wasn't eating or sleeping. The Gryffindor had become more short-tempered, speaking out in anger when he deigned to speak at all, and that concerned Severus more because Harry had always been pleasant and garrulous.
Hermione sighed. "Well, you're in the hall because the infirmary is full. We sanitized the floor and laid out some blankets for the less severely injured students. And as for Harry…" Hermione's voice softened as her gaze drifted away. "He's doing what he does."
When the last few crumbs were wiped away, and before Blaise could grab another piece of bread, Paige moved towards him. "'They're going to kill each other' Blaise?"
Draco thought for a moment. As a prince he had been educated in everything under the sun, except the practicalities. He shook his head, no.
There were several blank pages that covered the years after their break and his joining the Death Eaters, and then the one picture that broke his heart.
"I can't Draco. I wish I could- wish we lived in a world where I could be with you, boy or not, Slytherin or not, Death Eater or not. But I don't. We don't."
She still heard from Severus through letters. Sometimes the dark eyed man's letters were nothing more than notes, more full of irritation towards the people around him than affection, but throughout the words ran a thread of humor and a wave of exhaustion. Paige could tell that Harry's letters were on the same theme. It looked like things in England weren't going as well as they all had hoped.
The red head turned away from a blown glass swizzle stick shaped like a snake and walked over. "Ginny said he was doing well. Pretty far along but healthy, why?"
Without turning from his place Severus said, "I know white lighter healing has a diminished effect on our type of wizard, but if you could focus on the baby while I take care of Blaise I would very much appreciate it."
Severus waved, irritated, "I know what a chip is. Living in the magical world is not the same as living in a cave." He sighed, "I suppose I just wonder how much I ever knew of you. I mean, you have family I knew nothing about, you went on adventures as a child, when I worried you were trapped in that monstrous house, and you were dead."
Severus stood and walked to the sideboard, very much needing that drink. As he uncorked the crystal decanter and caught the scent of the mucky amber within, he tried to collect his thoughts.
The baby shifted in his arms and Ron called everyone over to see his son smiling. Paige was pretty sure it was just gas, but she knew better than to say that to a new parent so she turned back to Harry who looked a little better.
Blaise snorted. "Fine, make fun of me. I'm in pain and you're going to laugh." His voice was rough and Paige bit her tongue as his brown eyes grew teary. "Never mind that I'm in labor. Never mind that I'm not even eighteen. Never mind that I'm all alon—" He cut himself off with a fierce sob and before she knew it Paige had her arms wrapped around his swollen and trembling form and she was muttering comforting words under her breath.
When the blond Slytherin offered his hand, Harry took it and stood, brushing the dust off of his robe with the other.
Another Elder stepped forward, but Draco watched as Shannon pushed her way past, coming to his side.
"Look, this chatter is all well and good, but Nephew is not at his best—." Spike was cut off as Draco shifted on the floor and whispered something unintelligible.
Moving towards the door, Draco looked over his shoulder, "You don't need me. You can do this on your own. I've always known that, and you should know it too."
Paige saw a distinct look of relief in Chris's eyes every time Piper complained about morning sickness or swollen ankles or how irritating it would be to have two small children, then turned to face the adult embodiment of the baby with a glowing smile and said it was worth it. The brunet white lighter's conception date was looming and Chris had confessed to Paige that he was worried he might end up never existing at all.
A giant of a man with a bristling beard came out of the stables and took the reins of Ron and Harry's horses before looking at Draco.
Tugging a sleeve over his scarred hand, Harry made his way to his own favorite seat, the low padded stool in the corner tucked next to, practically under, the heavy mahogany desk. After a childhood spent in a cupboard under the stairs, some things had stuck and in times of intense stress Harry had to fight the urge to crawl into a dark space and wait for the noise to stop.
Not the best news to a man hidden in a dark lab, well out of the line of fire. Snape knew that the soldiers, his students, on the front lines would die, had known it his entire teaching career, but it didn't make the reality any easier to bear.
With that Draco felt that heart in his throat drop to his stomach and land with a hard thump. He knew it must have shown on his face because Severus rubbed a hand over his face and turned away.
Draco watched Harry order the others with fascination. He'd seen the green-eyed boy in action before, but it wasn't like this. This Harry was in command and Draco felt a deep shiver travel down his spine.
Severus took a deep breath. "Go to Draco, Harry. Tell him that you love him and that you want him for whatever time the two of you have."
Paige heard her sister exclaiming over the baby and she held his breath as the tiny creature yawned and opened his eyes to reveal vivid blue eyes to match his still-blushing father's.
Hermione was grinning like a Cheshire Cat and Neville and Chris wore milder versions of the same expression.
That lost look returning to his eyes, Draco said, "I don't know. I got here, I wanted to go home, we were eating breakfast, and there was an accident in the lab. Sev tried to help, but he got caught. I was too late."
"There's no such thing Harry. That's just a fairy story my mum told you. Leave it be before it turns and eats you."
a voice in Harry's head repeated, he was different, quieter. He didn't pick as many fights, or throw as many insults. He just stood and watched while his cronies did the dirty work for him.
As it settled, he heard Chris's voice come through, "-ry should be fine, Severus. It took a while to get him stable, but he was awake when I left and I think Alex and Spike will take good care of hi-" Chris broke of as the shimmering orb faded. "Oh, hey Draco," the white lighter mumbled.
"Well, his hair did end up very shiny and smooth, and the color seemed a lot brighter as well," Chris added, also smiling.
Two months later, Harry caught a stray curse, not even meant for him, but he didn't fight it off. He smiled as the green light hit him, and people said it was the most peaceful he'd ever looked.
Harry smiled, but it was a weak and bitter twist of the lip. "The last person to call me 'boy' wouldn't let me eat."
"We never sent it Harry. Blaise tried to make it but there was an explosion. Severus was… Severus was hurt, and Blaise. If it hadn't been for Malfoy and his friends, they'd be dead. Snape might still—"
When he was done crying the boy began to speak, telling Severus about their plan of attack, how the fight progressed, how it felt in that one desperate second when he saw a Death Eater lunging for Neville and reacted the only way he knew how.
Severus sighed; another restless night hadn't left him in the brightest mood. "It's too soon for the baby to kick, so Madame Pomphrey is most likely correct. Considering the Weasley family, the child will most likely be born with a full head of red hair and an irritating personality." Snape smiled tightly, "However, considering the ties between the Prewitt family and the Malfoy's, and the fact that blond hair is recessive…"
Severus heard stories about the green eyed boy's temper from Hermione and Ginny and others when they came to pick up potions or order more, but it wasn't until after a raid that went badly that he saw it for himself.
Of course, there was the night Phoebe tackled a six foot tall, green-haired woman skulking around the bar… But Miss Demeanor was very nice once he got his wig back.
Rubbing a hand over his tired, burning eyes, Draco waited for the speech, the one he was so familiar with that started at 'I'm disappointed in you' and usually ended with a hard clout across the face. It was what he was used to, after all.
Severus sighed. "I'm not entirely sure what's happening," Severus said. He looked over a Draco who was sitting in his old seat on the rug in front of the fire.
Shutting off the lights with a sharp gesture and locking the door behind him, Harry followed Hermione back to their motel room headquarters.
But even as he tried not to think about it, it became more vivid and Paige's dark eyes turned bright leaf green, the baby's auburn hair turned black, and in his memory Lily Potter nee Evans was abandoning him again.
As he moved he felt the soft brush of the blanket against his skin, taking a moment to peer under the green fuzzy thing, he could feel a hot flush flood his cheeks. They'd stripped him.
Harry might be out there himself, with the right partner, but that chance had been stolen from him months ago.
Both were male, and both carried overtones of familiarity and concern, the second more than the first.
Regular clothes suited his long, lean figure well and she had to force her eyes away from the sight of his denim clad behind, much to Spike's amusement.
"Stands to reason, love. An empathic whitelighter with a crush on his charge is probably guaranteed to have this reaction. So, if Potter is alive and well, then Dragon should be on the mend as well."
Paige steeped forward, steadying herself against Severus quickly, "I'm Paige Halliwell. I've been dragging your blond over there to this club for the past few months but he never let us meet."
With a few dull thumps, Spike enticed the last man standing to trip over his fellow dark wizards and he knocked himself unconscious on the stone floor of the cave. Brushing his hands together though they didn't get dirty in the fight, Spike sauntered over to Severus and Chris.
When finally the song drew to a close Draco was the first and loudest to call for more, his hands sore from clapping.
Dark curls surrounded the tan skin, framing an average face highlighted by a black satin eye patch covered in dark blue sequins. The remaining eye shined an unpleasantly familiar shade of amber. The man, whatever else he was, was a werewolf.
"I can't really picture you as a teenager, Severus. I kind of imagined you being born the way you are now, over six feet of sarcastic sorcerer."
Draco shook his head again. After the events of those two days, when the baby was born and he and Harry had- done what they had, his head was a muddle of thoughts and events and feelings.
Harry followed the wavering voice out onto the balcony, to find the pale, shivering form of his love.
Beyond it Severus heard people, and a lot of them. A dull beat seemed to throb in the floor underneath him, and he looked at the vampire suspiciously.
"Go," Harry asked, hearing himself be echoed by Snape, who had stayed strangely quiet through the speech.
His head was throbbing and there was a thick metallic taste in his mouth that he didn't want to think about.
"Fine. We'll go to the address, but I want you two to keep your senses on high. Harry tends to go off on tangents and he could be anywhere."
The crowd moved excitedly back to their seats around the stage as the next dancer came out to a sultry and unfamiliar song. Tall and muscular, he was wearing black leather pants and a deep blue shirt. An eye patch added a touch of mystery, and something on it glittered through the man's curly brown hair.
Severus couldn't fight back a shiver at the tone of Harry's voice. The sullen mourning phase had passed, but Severus couldn't help but wonder if this was worse.
"Alright Gin, thanks." With a weak gesture, the mirror went dark and Harry was left alone with his thoughts.
Piper reversed course and pulled Blaise with her to the couch, pushing him behind the tall back. She held her hands ready and the air around them seemed to waver. Draco was still unconscious behind her on the couch itself, lying painfully still.
The last few words were aimed directly at Granger and the young Weasley girl. Both of them cared for Harry, but they expressed it through nagging and affectionate smothering. Severus knew a great deal about heartbreak, and he knew that that was the last thing Harry would need.
Paige leaned in but she couldn't make out what he said. She looked to Spike, knowing vampire senses were stronger than human ones, "What did he say?"
Harry looked up when he heard Hermione. The girl was standing in front of him and it looked as though Ron was now explaining the intricacies of Blaise's pregnancy to Neville.
There was that cajoling tone in Harry's voice that Draco had gotten so used to. The same voice that persuaded him to speak of what had happened with Voldemort when he first landed on the door step of Grimmaud Place. That same tone had convinced the boy into good behavior, into friendship, into bed with the green-eyed boy.
She watched as Severus guided the baby out gently. She grabbed a towel from the stack on the coffee table and held it out. Severus set the baby on the fabric and at his guidance she wrapped it up tightly, letting her healing power flow through the cloth, strengthening the child's lungs and immune system as Severus focused on stopping the bleeding and sealing the tears.
Harry rose to his feet and threw himself at the female Death Eater who had run towards them as Voldemort fell, her wand outstretched. With a quick worldess spell, Harry's wand was out of her pocket and back in his hands and the Death Eater lay unconscious on the floor.
Together, Paige and Phoebe carried Draco to the living room couch, laying him on top of some heavy towels as a precautionary measure, though the bleeding had stopped. Piper settled Wyatt in his room, then came back downstairs and the sisters sat vigil in the living room.
Wide windows let sunlight flood into the room, which looked very different under the bright light. Harry was relieved that it didn't look as seedy as it had appeared last night in his nightmares.
Draco paused. He didn't know what to do next, what was possible. He had his responsibility to his charges and to he Elders, and Harry had a war to fight.
This startled Chris, who had been watching the proceedings with an expression of mixed worry and amusement. "Wyatt's missing? Mom, what's going on?'
"Dragon? I know you're upset, but I'm all right now, or will be once that wench gets back with my trousers."
"Ronald Bilious Weasley this is your fault and if you ever come near me again I will rip your dick off!"
Draco rose stiffly from the low wooden chair and stretched. Rubbing at red-stained eyes he walked past Paige, nudging her shoulder gently as he passed. It wasn't the most enthusiastic expression of gratitude she'd ever seen, but the kid was exhausted. Hopefully Piper could waylay him in the kitchen and force him to eat something before he went from his current translucence to complete invisibility.
Severus saw the brief shimmer of light reflecting off of matching gold bands before the three men left the dim and echoing room for the neon bright, smoke-filled, maelstrom beyond.
Spike smirked, "Poor lad. Can't help it if he shares my good looks. All the women fallin' at his feet."
There was no clear border line in the forest and Draco opened his mouth to argue it, then closed it again. No peasant would know about the borders, which meant the green eyed boy and his angry companion were nobles at least, and if Draco argued they might suspect his rank as well and return him to his father.
Paige sat back on her heels as Draco moved to the edge of the bed. Harry took a seat next to the blond.
Still staring into the fridge, she said, "Chris, if you don't give those back, I may have to beat you to death."
Piper huffed, "This is what I was trying to tell you. Wyatt is missing and you two," she pointed fiercely at the white lighters," were nowhere to be found. I had to ask Spike for help and he just laughed and said, 'no worries, love.'"
Severus followed the cue and conjured a small circle of silence around them. The air shimmered briefly as the shield settled into place.
Paige snorted. "He's the chicken? You spent the entire time behind Blaise with your eyes clamped shut."
The Death Eater ground down again and Harry groaned at the pain, squeezing his eyes shut tightly. Then the pressure eased up, until the Death Eater had stepped off completely and Harry reopened his eyes and saw her standing a few feet away.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer- (as it pertains at this point.) Spike, or William the Bloody, is a vampire. In his quest to destroy the Slayer, a teen age girl given the responsibility to destroy vampire and protect humanity, he was captured by a government organization called the Initiative. The Initiative experimented on vampires and demons and implanted a chip into Spike which would cause a painful electric shock if he attacked a human being.
Piper huffed, "He said he didn't need to hunt for Wyatt and disappeared into the basement. I don't know why Paige insists he stay here."
Now Draco heard the king sigh. "I am doing what my wife wished. In her last moment she told me to find someone to love, just like her. Is there any other so like my Narcissa?" There was a pause, then Lucius said, "I will take your silence to be assent. You will see, Snape, this is how the universe has rewarded me. They have given me my bride back. Now leave me."
Harry's eyes were glazed and weary, but he smiled a bit. "An angel," he mumbled softly, almost too softly for Draco to hear. "My own angel."
The orange juice was almost empty, a few good gulps would finish the jug, and since she was in slouchy clothes anyway Paige grinned to herself and raised the jug to her lips.
Harry waved his hands wildly, tears in his eyes as he giggled. "Okay, no, that's nothing. The last time I went on a proper shopping trip Hermione dragged us to a garden center for some rose bushes and it turned out the whole place was infested with garden gnomes. We barely escaped and we had scratches up to our knees from the nasty little buggers."
"He was there. He was in the hall when Shannon was visiting. And now he said something about not wanting a lifetime with you? Could he have heard anything?" Paige aimed the question at Draco, who bit his lip for a moment as he stared into the pattern of the rug.
Paige heard arguing from the living room, and then Draco walked into the kitchen, still pale, grabbed several herbs and a small cauldron, and disappeared into the bathroom.
Merlin, please wake up. You were right, you weathered the storm. You won. Now please wake up. I owe you a dance, you have to wake up.
Harry looked up and Draco lost himself for only a second in the depths of those green eyes before shaking off the distraction. Harry had said something, but for the life of him Draco couldn't remember what it was. Hoping it was nothing important he nodded and brushed Harry's hands aside to stand.
The next morning he had woken up on the couch next to Draco, the blond sleeping at his side, pressed against the back of the couch. It was a bit of a squeeze, but better for that because Harry felt like he was resting and protecting the blond at the same time and it was a nice feeling, a content feeling.
"From what young Mr. Wesley told me, a man appeared out of a swarm of black with a crossbow aimed directly at you."
He didn't want to get too far away, he knew it was a delicate time for the baby and Blaise, but he couldn't stay there. He had cried in front of too many people already.
Blaise smiled. "No, he'll have his godfathers to take care of him. Uncle Draco will protect his little Jamie from all of the emotional scars his two horny fathers inflict on him, won't he," Blaise asked, grinning wickedly at Draco. "Ah," he went on, "But who will protect poor Jamie from being emotionally scarred by his two horny godfathe-"
Still watching him warily, she spoke, "My name is Paige Matthews and you're in sunny San Francisco. Your godson brought you here, you got burned or something when a potion exploded."
The red head nodded. "Of course I can." He motioned for Paige to take the baby, which she gladly did, then lifted Blaise gently.
Acting as normally as he could, he'd dropped the damp rag back in his bin and walked to the bar, slipping out the back door.
Paige began spending more time with Draco as the letters took a darker turn. Spike had gone back to Oxnard with Alex and everyone else was involved with their own lives, so the blond white lighter didn't really have anyone to talk to. Some nights Paige would sit up with him until the wee hours and talk. She learned a lot of things about Severus that she would have to tease her lover about the next time they saw each other.
Severus held his breath as he watched Spike shift into what the vampire called his 'game face' and move closer to the brunette's neck.
Severus felt his back tighten. It was Alex's voice and sure enough the brunet was behind him, about two inches too close for any comfort and moving closer every second.
The man laughed, releasing the younger man's hand and leading him to a small table by the bar. "Sure you're happy to be here. Come on, kid. You're as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of hedge clippers."
Harry stared at Alex for a moment, weighing his options. They were finally starting to make headway in this location and leaving before they obtained the information they came for would negate their entire effort and set the war back months.
"And nothing, mister. My husband is a white lighter so that isn't a reason. And the dead thing is just semantics anyway. I mean my sister married a demon, and the other one almost became queen of the vampires." Both Paige and Phoebe groaned at the reminders, but Piper went on as if she hadn't heard. "As for the age thing, I can almost see where you're coming from. But you have to remember that even if Draco is actually fifteen, he's still the most mature young man I've ever met, and if you love him like you say you do, he deserves a chance to prove he can handle it."
Then he caught the plump glossy pink flesh of his bottom lip between his chemically whitened and magically straightened teeth.
Chris grinned sheepishly and took his arm away from Draco, much to Harry's relief, before following the woman to the refrigerator. "Aw, mom. I was just having some fun."
The boy sighed, but coughed heavily on the exhale. Paige wasn't sure what to do and finally settled for awkwardly rubbing his back until he caught his breath.
Harry opened his mouth to say something, to ask—but his throat was dry and harsh and he choked on the words, coughing harshly.
Sixteen years later King Lucius, roused from his chambers by the maids who would freshen his bed clothes and restock his liquor cabinet, leaned against the railing of his balcony which looked over the Royal Gardens.
Together the two of them moved Blaise to the couch, raising his legs up on the ottoman and pushing a pillow behid his lower back. Draco searched the brunet's face for further signs of discomfort and saw none.
At once all of the strength seemed to go out of the man's limbs as his knees buckled. Paige managed to get up off the couch, over the coffee table, and to his side in time to keep him from falling completely to the floor. Staggering under his limp weight, she half-carried, half-dragged him to the love seat, laying his lanky form across it.
Before him stood the three high Elders, forbidding expressions on their faces. Just behind them stood Shannon, looking apologetic and sorrowful, and just beyond them stood the forces of Hogwarts.
"Apparently you care for him more than you know. According to Chris you picked up the pain he was feeling. You were trying to protect him from a distance as well so your body fought off even peripheral magic."
Again Harry felt the pressure of recent events, but there was no time to stop, no time to regroup as Severus began to groan and curl up again.
When the room was empty Draco stood up again on trembling legs and walked back to his room. The door closed by itself, and inside the bedroom an invisible presence revealed itself to the blond.
The man smiled, and that smile seemed familiar, but Snape knew he'd never seen such a soft expression on Lucius's alabaster face.
At first Draco had fought against their destination, going so far as to drag his heels against the floors, protesting the entire cliché nature of it. But Harry insisted that he knew a room no one else would be able to find, even in the Tower, site of many a student tryst and possessed of no undiscovered niches. It would become their favorite spot to be together, arranging meetings sometimes weeks in advance, following hidden trails to the small room, avoiding all eyes.
"Just as well. They're both bent, this may be the closest either of them get to a namesake," Spike said.
Severus took a deep breath and stepped closer to the witch, pressing his lips to hers and swallowing the rest of the fumbled sentence.
"Yes, I think so," Draco said, closing the binder sharply. He loosed Harry's hands from his waist and turned to face the Gryffindor, taking in the view of his love in all his post-makeover finery. "I'm not going to be able to do this for a while, so enjoy it now."
His prayers were answered when Draco looked up and met his eyes fiercely. "Of course I love you, you idiot. I've been trying to tell you that for ages. We didn't get the chance to say it before you left and then you weren't answering my letters and-"
Snape was already there, waiting in his favorite chair, a threadbare green wingback kept a foot closer to the raging fire than Harry thought was safe, but the Potions master always said he was cold. The man had a brandy snifter resting in his palm, but Harry could see the strain in his knuckles around the delicate glass.
Draco tilted his head back, feeling it brush the wall as he stared at the framed pictures that lined the hallway. There were generation of generation of Halliwell women and men, and a few snapshots of Severus, and Draco and Blaise. There was even a sketch of Spike, as vampires didn't take well to flash photography.
Harry didn't have to fake the hitch in his speech, or, to his chagrin, the tears he could feel build up in his eyes.
The light in Ron's eyes dimmed at that, but came back when Harry grinned, slapped him heartily on the back, and waved down a waiter, "This calls for a celebration, Ron! Champagne !"
"Well how can I resist such an offer," he said, taking one of the bags and together they orbed away.
Paige stood in the doorway. Draco was sitting by his godfather's bed, the same place he'd been for the past week. The black-haired man was still unconscious, but most of the burns had healed.
She released Draco's hand as soon as they landed, just in case anyone saw them and got the wrong idea.
The boy sputtered a moment before sighing. "Look, Phoebe went to work and Piper had to take Wyatt on a play date. Chris is out researching again, and quite frankly I didn't want to be left alone with them when they get all snappy." The boy mustered up a few tears, and even though Paige was sure it was only for effect she turned to look at Draco and Severus who were now determinedly looking everywhere but at each other, Blaise, or Paige.
Harry stood frozen in the mouth of the hall. Draco was talking in the living room, but she couldn't make out what he was saying. Whatever it was it had the green eyed boy in shock, his shoulders slumped even as his back tensed.
Draco cut him off. "No! No, it's something-stabbing-" He couldn't say it. Chris was hurt, more than hurt, the emptiness Draco felt in his heart meant that his charge was dead. Harry and Chris had been injured before and Draco felt the ghost of their pain every time, letting him know when he need to heal them, but this was different. He felt Harry lifting his shirt.
Not knowing the gravity of his wife's condition, the King was overjoyed. Every day that Narcissa was pregnant was another day he adored her, a day that he found her more beautiful than any previous. But as she reached the end of her eighth month, she began to weaken. Her skin, already fair, paler to a sickly hue, and her eyes gained a strange fire as though they were the only thing keeping her and the child within her alive.
The Slytherin quirked a small smile at the sound, but it didn't reach his eyes. Harry though he saw tears form in the depths of the grey orbs, but as soon as they were spotted, they were brushed away and no trace of sorrow could be heard in the boy's voice as he replied.
"I expected better from the Boy Who Lived. Didn't they teach you anything at that fancy school of yours?"
Paige volunteered to orb home and get the bags, it was the fastest way to get there and back and Jamie's face was getting redder and redder as the little boy screamed his discomfort to the world. Piper agreed and while she and Blaise took a seat on a well-shaded bench by the gate, Paige found a secluded alley and orbed out.
Harry just wanted to get out. He brushed away the hand that had never stopped rubbing his back and headed for the first door he saw, hoping there would be an escape on the other side.
Draco froze, not sure whether to run or stand his ground, but before he could make up his mind Harry was there in front of him, offering his hand.
"Blaise stop," Ron said from the doorway. The red head's face was flushed with laughter, but Draco could feel his cheeks reddening from other emotions. "Poor Jamie won't have to bother with this for more than a few years yet, and right now poor Draco looks like he might spontaneously burst into flame."
"You're the one who doesn't understand, Severus. None of that matters. Draco has been acting and making decisions as an adult for years. I don't know a lot about his childhood, but I've seen the way he acts and I honestly doubt he had much of one at all."
It was the first time Harry had ever used an Unforgiveable. Cruciatis. And he didn't know how to stop it. His heart was full of hate and fear and panic and even with Neville, healthy and now-safe Neville, at his side, Harry couldn't stop.
"I was talking to Shannon. She asked me if I wanted- and I told her…" Draco's voice trailed off and when he looked up at Severus and Paige the tears that were threatening to fall had fallen, leaving thick trails down his pale cheeks.
At the first sip, Harry saw a shine in Draco's eyes, but the boy didn't stop. He tipped the glass up higher. A few gulps later, he had to support the globe with both hands, and the tearing in his eyes was obvious.
Chris looked up. "We have some problems right now. According to my demonic sources something big is coming. It might have to do with Wyatt or it might not, but it's too big to ignore."
At Ron's urging they broke up the sappy moment and Ron turned back to the room, keeping his grin under admirable control.
Hearing Draco, Harry gave up his pretence and threw the heavy blanket off. Hopping off of the cot, he walked over to the Slytherin's bed. The boy's tired voice had prepared him for Draco looking exhausted, but this was worse than he had expected. The Slytherin looked, he looked…
Paige snorted. "If half of what I've heard is true this is nothing." Passing Xander she dodged a solid pinch to the bottom and returned a solid slap of her own. Holding Draco's hand she orbed the two of them back to San Francisco , hearing Xander's merry giggle as they disappeared.
Finally she sat down with the boy and they worked it out. The last time Draco heard from Harry was the day of the zoo trip. Paige got Draco to confess what he and Shannon had been talking about that day. The possibility of his having a real life-long relationship with Harry.
Still he knew tears weren't entirely appropriate so he shoved his hands while he tried to think of a change of subject and internally cheered as his fingers encountered the pictures.
Once they were in there Severus swung the door most of the way closed. He didn't want to close it completely in case something else happened, but he wanted to give Harry and Draco their privacy.
But in the bright light of the morning both looked better. Severus looked well-rested and the half empty cup of tea and completely empty plate in front of him meant his stomach had settled.
An errant ray of candlelight fell on Draco's bag and caught the shine of the fine fabrics inside. Draco opened the satchel and ran his fingers over the three suits. They had been made for the wrong reasons, but they were beautiful and had never been worn.
"We—he needs some ice or something. Can you," she asked Severus and the man turned towards the kitchen.
The unfamiliar red head was sporting a blush as bright as his hair but he looked down at Blaise and the baby with proud tears in his eyes.
As the hit the floor, Harry caught sight of something just past where the man had been standing, a large metallic contraption, and crouching near it was a shadowy figure. But Harry thought he saw, the light caught on pale blond hair.
Both Severus and Xander said Draco had a 'gift' for destruction and he could only hope that gift served him now.
He dropped his spoon into the curry, sending thick droplets of gravy across the white tablecloth as he pressed his hands to his ears, hunching his back and curling into himself.
There was a bit more stuttering before Alex jumped in, "Dragon is Spike's nephew. He's been sick recently and we're worried about him. That's all."
Phoebe dropped her mocking position and Severus set his paper and pen on the table nearby before he apparated to the living room. Draco closed his eyes in preparation to orb back down but before he had the chance he felt Phoebe grip his shirt. He opened his eyes and met her even stare.
Hogwarts had become headquarters for the war after the attack that destroyed Grimmaud Place. The loss of Sirius' legacy had hurt, but Harry didn't miss the man's mother a bit. During the months of fighting, Harry had spent many evenings in Snape's rooms. It was the most peaceful place he could find in a castle packed too tight with students and their families and every hallway flooded with the stench of fear.
