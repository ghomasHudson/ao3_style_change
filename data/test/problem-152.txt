“Harry!” Ginny gasped, alarmed, “What is going on? Why do you think this organization is real?”
He looked up to see Aviary standing directly in front of him. She looked the same as she did last night; tired and worn down.
Harry sighed, “You didn’t make a mess of it. I’m sorry I overreacted.”
Harry watched as Aviary, still teary-eyed, locked eyes with Draco and nodded. Harry tried to focus on this solely and not the fact Draco had hesitated when talking about someone he would be devastated to lose.
Bill turned to the three kids and explained that the attacks they had heard about in Diagon Alley had happened again in a muggle village. When he finished, James spoke,
“Well,” Draco stood up and faced away from Harry as he took out his wand, “I need to get back home to Scorp. I have him this Christmas.”
Brayan was already at the front of the room. He beamed at Harry when he walked in and waved him towards his desk. Harry walked with only some hesitancy towards the desk; Harry wanted to seem eager to follow any directions given to him by his supervisor, but he didn’t like to feel the silent judgement from the rest of the trainees who already assumed much of his success in the program came from his fame.
Seamus shrugged, “Honestly Harry, I don’t know. They are just rumors, and while Boot has his moments, he’s not always the most trusty source of information,” Seamus stopped to think, then said, “But it wouldn’t be that surprising, now would it? I mean, about half of our year ended up being queer. There’s me, Dean, Lavender, Parv, Nev, Blaise... Malfoy wouldn’t exactly be a shock.”
“Ida was there?” Aviary asked bitterly.
Malfoy looked almost surprised at Harry’s sudden aggression. He hesitated, then said, his voice even, “I don’t hate you.”
Harry’s whole body stiffened. He turned away from Hermione without looking her in the eye and hugged Rose and Ron. He tried to ignore the lingering stress and sadness in Ron’s eyes and instead turned to his kids and Rose, who were laughing as they compared ugly Christmas sweaters, a Potter-Weasley Christmas Eve tradition. Ron and Hermione had been his oldest source of comfort and happiness, and now they reminded him of the two most challenging things in his life; his desire to end his marriage and his failed attempts to bring an end to the attacks afflicting muggles and muggleborns. The easiest thing for him right now was to impress Rose with his Christmas tree sweater that lights up and wait for his other guests to arrive.
Ron patted him on the shoulder, “Mate, he’s fine. He’s giving a statement as we speak.”
“That’s not a question,” Malfoy pointed out, but continued, “I still adore Astoria as a person. I’ll always love her, but just not in the way I need to in order to be her husband.”
“I need to go…” he stated, not daring to look at Draco as he apparated, books in hand.
“You think I would if I had a choice?!” Aviary asked fiercely, “There’s no other choice! She’ll know I’m on to her if I don’t go back!”
“Your solution to my personal crisis is the bar? Real original,” Harry joked.
“I wouldn’t put it past her,” Harry said, remembering the fierce Bat-Bogey hexes Ginny gave while at Hogwarts.
“Obviously not. This isn’t Hogwarts Draco we’re dealing with,” Draco shuddered, as if the memory of his old self caused him physical disgust.
“Yeah, mate,” Ron said gently, “You have no reason to feel responsible.”
Aviary countered with, “But it’s great evidence!” while Harry said indignantly, “To cover up the fact a group is performing the curses! A renowned group that could be connected to the crime!” He was positive this was true; it had to be Kareach! He needed to talk to Malfoy.
“Are they under suspicion?” Harry wondered.
“Why is everyone fixating on that?” Harry wondered desperately, “He’s my friend. It’s not the most insane thing that’s happened.”
“Harry!” Draco huffed. The use of his first name made Harry’s stomach lurch, “Didn’t you notice me? I’ve been making a fool of myself at the front of the canteen for minutes!”
Malfoy turned slightly and gave him a perfectly indifferent glance, before turning back to the menu and asking, “I’m a big pot pie fan but I’m reluctant to risk getting it at a hospital canteen. Is it any good?”
Harry could feel tears forming in his eyes, “I’m sorry. For everything I did that was stupid. Especially accusing Blaise. That was never supposed to be spiteful, I really need you to know that.”
“That girl is a fucking miracle,” Padma declared.
“Why is Kareach planning an attack now?” Draco asked, “Not many people besides the Aurors are left in the building, right?”
Scorpius and Rose went over to join Al. In a few moments, they had all begun a game of tag, seemingly over the fight they had had less than a minute before.
“He was always alive, twit.”
“Rose!” Hermione shouted towards them, “Watch after your brother!”
Harry laughed and began to tell stories about Molly’s own obsession with Celestina.
“What if someone else was in the room?” Harry asked, “Disguised so that no one knew they were there? That way all the Aurors were fooled. That was probably the same person who killed Remmins!”
He stuck his face in and was surprised to see the lights were still on. He looked around and spotted Ida sitting on the floor, papers stretched out around her. She was casting charms that created streaks of light across the papers.
“I know what I said,” Aviary snapped, “But there was no possible way for me to tell you! Not with Ida in the office!”
Harry nodded. That actually made a lot of sense. Not the Malfoy being gay part, but his reason for still having a great relationship with Astoria. He tried to think of what to say next, and thought of nothing. Finally, he settled on, “Well, good for you.”
Taking a fistful of floo powder, he threw it into the flames and shouted, “Ida’s apartment!”
Harry stared at Caser. There was a lingering sadness in his eyes that Harry hadn’t noticed before. So maybe Caser did have his mother to look up to while he was growing up. But he also dealt with an unspoken difficulty while his mother paid more attention to her profession than him. Harry, on the other hand, had endless love and support from friends and family. Harry had to remind himself that people’s lives can’t be based on who their family consisted of, but what their family consisted of.
The four fell silent, not knowing what to say anymore. Harry decided to do his best to alleviate their heartache.
“Because it is!” Harry jumped up, fully aware he was being rude but not caring in the slightest, “I need to leave.”
“Fred, there really is no need to scream,” turning to Harry, Angelina exclaimed, “Really, Harry, I am so sorry!” over the sounds of the shouts coming from the other side of the room as Harry’s kids greeted their cousins.
“Alright, alright, you two go and play with your cousins,” Draco told James and Lily.
Darius inclined his head towards the edge of Harry’s bed as if to ask if he could sit down. Harry nodded and Darius took a seat. He looked much more exhausted and uneasy now that he brought up his father.”
“I don’t have time to make us a more comfortable arrangement, so this should do,” Draco noted as he walked towards the fireplace and knelt in front of it.
“No,” Molly said, frowning, “They had business to finish at the Ministry.”
As the words left his mouth, he knew they weren’t even close to being what Aviary needed to hear. Nothing would be. What happened to her was something that could never be fixed with words.
“Harry’s best mates with Draco Malfoy,” Ginny said matter of factly.
“How’s it coming along?” Harry asked.
“What?” Ginny demanded.
“This whisky is terrible,” Harry slurred as he took another long sip and gagged.
“Then why act evasive and angry all the time?” Draco asked, his voice tired.
“I have real news,” Harry grabbed Malfoy’s arm and waved his wand, focusing on the street outside of Smith and Walton’s Cafe. After the brief compressing darkness, Harry and Malfoy reappeared outside of the cafe.
Molly moved towards the door, revealing an awaiting Hermione with her arms outstretched, wanting her own hug.
“Harry…” Ron began.
“How can you say that?” Ginny said, “I’ve had intense feelings of longing and confusion as well for a long while! I’ve fought them off for so long because I didn’t want to mess up what we have. You’re still my best friend, Harry. No matter what. And I made a mistake. But if you have feelings for some other woman, how is that any different?”
“In the park,” Al stated, as if this was obvious, “Scorp is in the park a lot with his mum. Whenever Grandma Molly takes us there she lets us play with him.”
Deciding to forget all about the fact that they technically weren’t on speaking terms, Harry threw his arms around Ron. He guessed that the whole Auror department was in panic mode, and that Ron hadn’t stopped to grief since he received the news. Or saw the news. Harry still had no idea what had happened.
“I thought you were dead, Harry,” he murmured into Harry’s shoulder, “When Ida told me you were hit by a spell, I thought the worst until she confirmed it was only a stunning spell.”
The room erupted in bouts of shocks and screams. Harry pointed his wand at his throat and said Sonorus to magnify his voice, “No one eat anything!” he yelled. He bent down to try and help Dean, but there wasn’t much he could do as an inexperienced trainee. Around the room, shouts rang as more muggleborns collapsed. Commotion was thick as he racked his brain for any available spells to keep Dean alive. He was keeping his panic internalized. What mattered now was his friend.
She rolled her eyes, “I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a million times. I don’t want to get married.”
Suddenly something occurred to Harry. As Ron went to answer Draco, Harry interrupted, “Draco! I need to talk to you,” he looked at Rose, watching intently from her position on the bed, “Outside.”
“Potter, Reyes!” Savant cried. He was a large man with a personality to match. Well over six feet with an imposing figure, he was a forceful man to have as the head Auror. Harry knew better than to be intimidated, however; if you were on Brutus Savant’s good side, he wouldn’t raise a finger towards you. Unless, of course, he was offering you one of his signature bear hugs.
“Fine,” Padma turned to Harry, “Just remember he’s just doing his job and there is no reason to turn it into one of your schoolboy showdowns.”
“Are you and Draco…” he trailed off and looked at Hermione, who shot him a look that clearly told him she was not helping in this.
“Group hug!” shouted Roxy.
“Harry?” Aviary asked. She was holding tightly to his arm, “Are you okay?”
“Actually, you are exactly who I have been wanting to see,” Molly walked towards him, “Harry, I am not upset at you.”
Malfoy laughed, a clear and light sound, “What did you think, Potter? I was going to let my Murr behave like any other ferret, or animal to be precise? You must know me better than that by now.”
Harry blushed slightly, “I do really care for him.”
“I have an interview to get to. A rather pointless one, at that, but I couldn’t let Healer Brayan get another day in the sun so I said I would do it,” she leaned in and muttered, “Harry, between you and me, Healer Brayan should not be in the position he is in here at St. Mungos. Do be careful,” as fast as she had said this, she pulled back and continued, “You will need to keep an eye on Mr. Haffer for the next hour or so. I will come and fetch you when I think it is safe for you to leave. Yesterday he had a near fatal episode from a negative reaction to the cure. It is not a full-proof cure. It’s rather poor, to be exact, but it’s all we got at the moment and it works almost all of the time. All I need you to do is watch over him and call for aid if he appears to have another attack. Now, I must go tell a reporter all I know on wolfsbane, a complete and good use of a Healer’s time,” she began to walk away at the end of this sentence, walking at her advanced speed towards the lift at the end of the hallway.
“Oh yes, you can,” Harry forced the door open and strode into the flat. He let out a small gasp as he caught sight of the room. The entire living room had been converted into an intensive investigation center. Papers and books were stacked on every available service, and where posters had once hung on the wall were list after list of what Harry could only assume was Draco’s ideas, thoughts and research. Although Harry had been helping to find out anything he could about Chann these past couple weeks, his main focus had been on his confusing love life. All Draco focused on was putting all his available energy into learning about Chann and Kareach.
Ron said nothing but slowly let the death grip he had on Hermione’s arms go. As Dean and Hermione disappeared into nothingness, Ron let out a wail that set Harry’s hair on edge. The last thing Harry wanted to do was turn away from his closest friend at his lowest moment, but he knew what he needed to do next. He turned around to make sure his kids had gotten away safely. To his relief, the only people in his family remaining were Bill, George, Luna, Neville, Hannah and Seamus, who were now all casting spells against Kareach members. Harry didn’t spot any green beams of light. The Kareach members were not aiming to kill innocent pure bloods or half bloods. Harry knew it would only be a matter of time until this changed. Sure enough, one of the masked figures spotted Draco and shouted. Without waiting to see what would come of this, Harry grabbed Draco and apparated to St. Mungos.
“Molly, I’ll leave,” he said, standing up. His heart broke as Lily shouted in protest.
“Harry, if I am being honest, I don’t want you and Ginny to break up. I love both of you and the relationship our families have. But more than that, I want you and Ginny to be happy. And if you aren’t happy, that will never be okay. I know that you can find a truer, more pure life, where you and Ginny are in each other's lives and mine and Ron’s lives without being together. If that’s what you need. Because it would never be fair to any one, not even your kids, if you stayed in a marriage where real love was absent.”
“Harry…” Ida trailed off. Then she began to laugh, “I know.”
For the first time since the attacks had begun, Ron’s voice sounded small. Scared. Unsure.
Ron opened his mouth to answer, but then glanced over at Padma.
“Uncle Harry?” he asked concernedly, “Why do you look upset? Is sure-i-gassy bad?”
“Wait… hold on. Draco’s in the hallway?” Harry asked.
“And I’m sorry…” Harry began.
To his surprise, Draco didn’t look angry. He just looked sad. Harry watched as he sat down on a large beam and put his face in his hands.
“Things will change, Gin. I promise.”
“Are you kidding me?” Harry shouted, “How is that relevant! I never cheated, and I’ve been dealing with tons more than you!”
“Ron?” Hermione’s voice sounded from over his shoulder. This caught Ron’s attention. He jumped up and out of Harry’s grasp and rushed to Hermione’s side.
“James? Albus? What’s going on?”
Harry turned to his sons and said, “Well, if either of you are feeling unhappy in any way, I want you to know you can come to me or your mother. We love all of you very much and will be here for you anytime you need us.”
Ida sighed, “Harry, as much as I would like to believe that, the family you are raised with has far too much influence on who you are for Malfoy to be a completely new person with no prejudiced views. Hate and ignorance just runs too deep.”
“My name is Harry!” Harry nearly screamed at Malfoy, causing a woman pushing her child in a stroller to speed up as she walked past them, “Harry fucking Potter!”
“What if we did?” Harry asked softly.
Harry looked Ginny in the eyes. He chose this moment to trust her, to stop lying. He told her everything, from the first time Harry and Draco really talked at the Leaky to the awful conversation they had in Conference Room B after Draco found out about Chann. He told her how he was involved every step of the way.
“Is Aviary okay?” she asked immediately.
Harry’s eyes lit up, “You are going to bug her!”
Malfoy looked like he was considering standing up and leaving, but he stopped and looked right back at Harry.
He pursed his lips, “I don’t know. Zabini has been a trusted part of this staff for a long time. I have never suspected any wrongdoing of any sort.”
“Sometime this morning,” Brayan said, “For someone who hasn’t slept in almost forty eight hours, he is a very good conversationalist.”
The third part of the plan was for Draco to go to the Puddlemere field and set out bug bombs in the stadium. It was the perfect plan to get Aries to the field: as the owner of the team and stadium, he would have to go and deal with the heavy amounts of smoke the bombs would release. The bombs wouldn’t do any damage, so it would take hardly any time for the smoke to be cleared. However, the release of the bombs would raise suspicion, especially right now, as the attack on the quidditch pitch was only mere weeks ago. At least one Auror would need to be sent down there to help clear up the pitch and inspect the damage, and Harry would bet anything that Ida would volunteer, out of suspicion and the fact it would give her a chance to talk to Aries in private. No, the plan wasn’t foolproof, but it set up the perfect way for Padma to hear a conversation between Ida and Aries.
“You’d be surprised,” Seb said, “And I could have said the same about you, Harry. At least when I first met you. But the more I’ve spent time with you, the more I’ve realized that you are one of the people who needs cheering up the most because you’ve spent your whole life cheering up everyone else around you.”
“The spell didn’t hit him, Harry,” Ginny explained, “Seamus noticed Ida was going back for her wand…”
“When can we do that, Av?” Seb pleaded with his girlfriend.
“I’m glad you approve,” Ginny snorted. She sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed, “But even with all this change, I want you to know that both your father and I will always be on the same team. We are both here for you, and we still love each other and you kids with everything we have. Now we’ll just have more people to love you.”
Harry nodded and looked desperately towards the conference rooms, hoping to see Draco emerge.
Seb laughed at his joke. The soft and airy quality of it was soothing and almost made Harry feel better, “I like what you did there,” Seb commented, “I always appreciate a good pun. I used to give Healer Patrick a new pun every time she came into my room. She then began coming into my room every five minutes one day until I admitted I couldn’t think up puns that quickly.”
“Draco,” she wrapped her hand around his wrist, “Is this a situation where I need to be ready to hex? Because I’m pretty pissed but I can try…” she trailed off as an attractive woman with long silky hair and a short dress beckoned to her.
Before his restless and anxious thoughts could go any farther, Draco reappeared in the doorway, a large stack of papers and books in hand.
“Yes,” Angelina said loudly, “Both of us!”
“He… what?” Harry asked, extremely confused.
“Oh, Aviary,” Harry whispered. He remembered the day in the hospital, after the attacks. The expression on Aviary’s face when Remmins had told her he loved her for the first time. Now he imagined her, rushing to the Ministry for help, only to return with Remmins dead.
“I’m still not sure that it is!” Ron argued, “At what point did it become okay to be chummy with the entirety of the Slytherin house!”
“Hurry, I am not getting on that woman’s bad side,” Blaise said to the group.
Harry couldn’t believe this. While he was fretting over whether or no Draco liked him or whether them having a relationship was even a good idea, his kids had decided for him that Draco was the right decision. When did his children become so wise, so mature? For goodness sake, Lily was only three, and she was processing a divorce and her parents’ new relationships much better than he was.
Without any intention of doing so, Harry gave a small gasp. The Malfoy who walked into the room looked nothing like the boy Harry remembered at Hogwarts or the man Harry expected to interview him today. Malfoy’s signature slicked back hair he had adorned for the entirety of his time at Hogwarts was gone, replaced by fine strands of wild blond hair that was falling into his eyes without Malfoy seeming to be any the wiser. His clothes were nothing Harry could have ever imagined a Malfoy wearing. He had on distinctively muggle clothes; a soft blue jumper paired with black jeans and grey pointed shoes. What possibly surprised Harry the most was the kid walking into the room behind Malfoy. He was obviously Malfoy’s son, but he was not the pristine and proper kid Harry had envisioned. He looked like he was around James’s or Al’s age, and dressed just as they would, in a simple t-shirt and pair of blue jeans. Malfoy’s vivid white-blonde hair and pointed chin were instantly recognizable in his son, but his eyes were a soft brown that screamed something new all together. Neither of them, Harry realized with a shock, reminded Harry of Lucius or Narcissa or any Malfoy-Black he had ever encountered.
Annoyed at Malfoy’s rude answer, Harry snapped, “I thought you were here for me. You are standing outside the conference room, excuse me for thinking there was some problem with my interview!”
“I knew it,” Ida said triumphantly, but something in her face suggested she didn’t quite believe him.
“What is happening?” Draco whispered, “Since when are those two interested in each other?”
“You sent my ex-wife’s new boyfriend to her house?” Harry asked, “I could laugh if this situation wasn’t so dire.”
Harry laughed, “None taken. Everything looks good Blaise, but I can’t clear you to leave, as I’m only a trainee.”
“Anyway, Draco explained everything,” Darius said, “About my father.”
Harry read the list and mentally prepared to do all the things asked of him. Then, bracing himself, he walked into the room.
“In private,” James said, standing up from the table.
“Not at all!” Harry answered a bit too quickly, making Dean raise his eyebrows, “I just wish he was a bit politer about it, that’s all.”
“We’ll just have to wait and see whose team comes out on top, won’t we?” Ginny sneered, “And I wouldn’t bet on a team captained by the biggest wanker I have yet to meet.”
Harry looked eagerly at Ida, “Did you all find some new evidence? Or discover anything about the attacks?”
“Back off, Seamus. I heard it took a good five years for you to propose,” Draco shot back.
Hermione looked at Ron with tears in her eyes, “I know what you mean. When Padma sent owls to everyone, letting them know what was going on at the Ministry, I felt like I was back at Hogwarts. When we never really knew if each day would be our last.”
“Oh, fucking save it, Potter,” Draco interrupted, “You blew any coincidences with this case and Blaise out of proportion because you wanted to spite me! I blew you off and you couldn’t stand that, so you took it out on my best friend.”
“Harry,” Padma whispered fiercely, “Calm down! We aren’t saying Malfoy wasn’t helpful! But he’s done something important for us, and now it’s our turn to take on the dangerous part by ourselves. It’s the way it has to be.”
“”Yes, Potter. I fall into the far “gay” side of the spectrum, unlike my friend Pansy who will shag anything with a pulse,” Malfoy said nonchalantly.
A woman walking with her kids had stopped behind Draco to watch them. Harry gave her a weak smile until she left. Then he pulled Draco underneath the bleachers when no one was looking, realizing they shouldn’t be talking about this at one of the most crowded wizarding functions of England.
“What…” Harry sputtered.
Aviary turned to Harry, “So this is why you were so upset the night we told you Kareach wasn’t real?”
A surge of energy passed through Harry. Another suspect? Already? How could they have found another likely suspect in a day?
When Harry finished, Malfoy sighed, “Potter, I told you none of the Aurors believed in Kareach.”
“The classic ‘go play with your cousins’?” Ginny said, “I approve, Draco.”
“Well, you said ‘we need to talk’” Harry said, “Which I took as you had something important to tell me.”
“Thank you, Hermione,” Harry gripped her arm to show his gratitude.
“The poison used in the Imperius attacks is called Chann. It’s a rare poison, native to Cambodia. I looked over all of Draco’s notes, and this poison fits the side effects of the attacks perfectly. Unfortunately, the purpose of this poison is to prevent anyone who ingests it from reproducing…”
Harry wiped his eyes and looked up to apologize to Draco, but he was gone.
“To tell her to place the bug,” Draco answered simply, “I gave her multiple ones weeks ago. If I have Aurors on the inside, I might as well give them all the tools I can.”
He apparated into the living room without warning, hoping that Hermione would forgive him for his rudeness. Listening for the tell-tale sound of frantic quill against parchment, he quickly found Hermione at the dining room table, papers spread in an array around her as she wrote fiercely on her nearly completely black parchment.
Harry smiled as Aviary began to talk about a woman she had a suspicion wasn’t straight as Padma shot her down continuously. Harry knew Padma well enough to know she wasn’t the type to hook up or even talk to a stranger in a bar. Over the numerous years he had known Padma, he had only seen her with a date twice. The first time was with Ron at the Yule Ball, which was now only mentioned as a source of humor for Padma, who liked to poke fun at how abysmal Ron and Harry were as dates (Parvati had her complaints as well). The second time was at one of the annual Ministry Balls. Padma had shown up with a kind and pretty girl named Stacia who Harry had instantly liked. Unfortunately, Stacia had moved to Albania only a few months into their relationship and Padma had stood firm against long distance. This was all in sharp contrast to her twin sister, Parvati, who Harry had seen date more men and women than he could count. It was only in the last couple of years that she reconnected with Lavender (it was only a matter of time until one of them proposed. Harry had never heard two people talk about weddings more). Padma, however, never seemed upset to be single. She was more sure of herself than most people and never seemed interested in seeing anyone. That, however, didn’t stop her from pointing out people for her friends to hook up with when at a pub. Harry was glad for this; he had missed these pub nights after a long day at the office with his Auror friends.
Harry felt a little guilty at these words; although the attacks were still at the forefront of his mind, his main reason for avoiding Seb had to do with the fact he was like a bright and over smiley version of Draco, and Harry hadn’t wanted the constant reminder of his seemingly one-sided love. Now, it stung even more to see Seb, but it hurt less than facing his friends and family at a time like this. They would all want to discuss the divorce and Harry’s sexuality and the hell that had become Harry’s life in the past few days, and that’s the last thing he needed right now. He was hoping Seb would just be a positive spin on his sadness and a good distraction from everything that was happening in his life.
Harry began to explain what had happened, but Aviary cut him off, “Harry, I need to know why I should trust Draco with this information. I have no reason to trust him as of right now, so I really don’t want you telling him something that could put me and so many other people in danger.”
Harry looked and gave an audible gasp. Two girls who were dancing together in a way Harry had not done since his early twenties were none other than Pansy Parkinson and Sani Silver, one of the Auror trainees he had helped Savant and Ida interview the other day.
Harry gritted his teeth, “You’re not serious? That’s it? A lapse of judgement? I didn’t get the kiss I’ve been waiting for just for you to tell me it was nothing but a mistake!”
Harry shook his head, “How on earth are you this perceptive? I was never this smart at your age. You are only ten!”
Lily, clearly intrigued, announced, “I’m co-spinna!” to the rest of the room, propelling herself off of Angelina’s lap to go and grab the rejected board from the ground.
Harry looked up to see Molly walk into the living area. Harry realized she must have been watching them for the day, as this was usually Harry’s day off in which he was at home with the kids. Her eyes expanded as she saw Harry hunched over, crying on the floor.
“You and Draco will be here to help, I hope,” Ron looked Harry straight in the eye, “Harry, I was a fucking wanker last week when you and Ginny told me about the divorce. Or when James told me, to be exact. I freaked out because I never pictured you and Ginny separating. I got super protective and weird about it, especially when I thought you had cheated on her, because she’s my little sister and I couldn’t stand the fact of you hurting her and, by extension, hurting me. It felt like betrayal. But,” he reached over to grab onto Harry’s arm, “I’ve been thinking about it. A lot. And talking to Hermione. A lot.”
“I’ll talk to all of them straight away,” he assured, “And I promise you, Ginny, I won’t sneak off to any more pubs without you knowing.”
“Yes,” Padma sighed, “I think we’ll have to pull an all nighter by the looks of these paperwork stacks.”
He looked back at his wife. He was surprised at her sudden loss of anger, but that was the least strangest thing to happen in this conversation. She looked tired but relieved, a relieved look he realized that he hadn’t seen on her in years. Ginny always looked like she was holding back a secret tension. Now she looked free, unburdened.
Harry internally began to panic; Malfoy, here? After their drunken conversation only a week ago, Harry had no idea where they stood. Malfoy had seemed to regret everything he told Harry about Kareach, so Harry wasn’t giddy to face the bloke again.
“Two days,” Draco piped in, a true smile forming on his lips.
“Harry?” Hermione asked searchingly, “You can tell me.”
“I… jumped in front of it. To protect Draco,” he looked up at Ron, fearing the worst.
Harry was surprised at the humility in Brayan’s words. Despite how much he had always admired Brayan, the man had never been known for his humbleness.
“Harry?” Draco asked from his spot in his favorite armchair, “What are you doing here?”
Ron shook his head, his eyes locked on Hermione. Harry looked around desperately and spotted Dean, who was arguing with Seamus.
Harry silently approved Ida of her choice. Sure, Aviary was a lot more outwardly enthusiastic than Ida would ever be, but she was clearly up for the job and not afraid after what was surely a crazy first day of work. Glancing at Ida, he noticed the look of determination on her face. He knew her well enough to know this meant she was excited to work with Aviary as well.
“How on earth did you hear me?” Harry asked, “Never mind. Can I come through? It’s urgent.”
“So you’re telling me that you, Ron and Hermione make up that easily?” Draco asked.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Honestly, Draco, you did what anyone would have done in that situation. You can’t blame yourself for any of this. And if it was a decoy, whoever left the letter would have erased any evidence of themselves or their magic in case you did figure all of this out beforehand and want to test it.”
“How did Ginny know?” Draco asked softly.
“We know, mum,” James said, “I’m sorry I couldn’t see that at first.”
“Listen, Seb,” Harry cut in patiently, “I really can’t talk about this right now. I potentially wrecked my relationships with multiple people today. What I need right now is just to forget about all of that.”
Harry watched again as Ida pressed her wound into a gash on Draco’s face. She ran her wand down the length of it, sending even more blood trickling down Draco’s neck and onto his shirt. All Harry could imagine was the internal pain Draco was feeling, all concealed on his unmoving face.
Moments later, the room filled with loud shouts of ‘Protego Maxima!’ as Auror after Auror cast the charm. A bright barrier was soon created around the Aurors. Their wands were connected by streaming beams of light, forming a dome of invincibility. The light from the protective bubble illuminated the room enough for Harry to see the large group of Aurors once again, holding their wands up as if one.
Harry laughed as Al said, “Of course! We all can. He’s the family kite we’re gonna use to blow the rest of neighborhood kids out of the water.”
Ron was far less than willing to give the care of his wife over to Harry. Ron attempted to cast another charm (one Harry knew won’t do much of anything), when Draco appeared at Harry’s shoulder. Without warning, he shoved Ron to the side and began a round of spells Harry never would have thought to use. Draco’s extensive research on Chann was coming into good use.
“Mr. Potter!” he exclaimed, “How are you?”
Ron smiled gratefully at his partner, then turned back to Harry. Harry couldn’t help but admire how quickly the two reconciled.
“Save it! How could you accuse Blaise! Haven’t you met the man? He is the least likely person to do something like this! What was this, a way to get back at me and Draco in one foul swoop?” Ginny screamed.
Now that he was here with Hermione looking back at him, he wasn’t sure he could tell her. Sure, he had told Ida, but that had been a moment of traumatic and frantic desperation. And, as much as he loved Ida, he didn’t have the same connection with her. Hermione had been his best friend since he was eleven. She knew him extremely well. Ida knew him well, but not in this way. He had been through hell with Hermione and she had always been there for him. This was the same girl he had brought on a hunt for Horcruxes. The same girl he had set a framed mass-murderer free with. The same girl who would do anything for him. Telling her this felt like what Seb had said: that it would change their entire friendship. Just like Seb, though, he needed to be brave enough to move past that and just tell his full truth.
“Let’s just get his statement done,” Remmins gestured towards the door, “We promise to keep it professional.”
“And the other day,” Malfoy continued, eyes bright, “He walked around the entrance to St. Mungos for a couple hours. I can guarantee there's a fat chance he was just window shopping in a rundown part of a muggle area just outside Mungos.”
“Could I explain that one?” Aries asked in a lower voice.
Draco nodded, “Yes. The person who takes the poison can never produce their own child. They also infect anyone they have intercourse with throughout their life.”
“Any last words?” Ida asked viciously, as Aries laughed joyfully from behind her.
“Why? We met one time!” Draco pointed out.
“He does,” Harry agreed, standing up as well. Aviary joined him a moment later.
“All those times you were out together…” she exclaimed, “I should have known! You’ve been so suspicious and dodgy about it all!”
“Angelina,” Harry said, shaking his head, “I don’t know how you do it.”
To Harry’s surprise and relief, the door swung open to reveal Hermione.
Draco looked alarmed but nodded to Ron and Hermione and followed Harry into the hallway.
“But that undermines their entire foundation,” Draco argued, “They’ve remained a rumor for so long because they never cast suspicion of otherwise publicly.”
“Another gay wedding for the Gryffindors,” Seamus said, “All those years Lavender and Parvati spent talking about boys, and here we are. I still can’t believe that out of our entire Gryffindor class, only two of us ended up being straight.”
“But…” Ida intercepted.
“What?” Ron said, “Oh… yes. The fighting has stopped and all of the muggleborns were either evacuated to you or taken with Healer Patrick and her team. Few casualties, too; only Youll and two muggleborns so far.”
“I work in the same building as Seamus Finnigan,” Ida responded simply, “It was only a matter of time.”
“That’s because you looked at him in your room for weeks, you nutter. I couldn’t find him when I needed to send a letter to Teddy!” James paused, then continued, “But nevermind that. This kite is amazing! Can I fly it?”
“Sweetheart, don’t ever think I could hate you,” Molly said as she pulled away, “Not for this, not for the divorce. Of course I am sad that you and Ginny will no longer be together, but I understand that not all couples can last forever. You both need something different, and it sounds as if you have come to that understanding together. Both of you will always have me, my sweet Harry.”
Ginny raised her eyebrows, “And this secret society you're obsessed with? What is it?”
After about twenty minutes of talking to Seb, Harry had to cut him short in order to head back to his job. He made plans with Seb to meet for a tea the following week before the man walked away to go to a nurse he recognized from his time as a patient. Harry watched Seb rush over to the nurse and immediately embrace the surprised man in a hug. He laughed softly; Seb really was the brightest man he had ever met. Turning away, Harry made his way towards the third floor, where the trainees were scheduled to meet in five minutes. He was walking towards the lift when he spotted Draco standing near the entrance of the canteen, scanning the room intently as if he was looking for someone.
He must have stared for far too long, because James whispered loudly to Al, “Should we leave now?”
“Did something else happen with your investigation?” Seamus said concernedly, “You can tell me, Harry. Dean and I are completely trustworthy.”
“What?” Harry snapped, “My personal life? Did you read the article that no doubt came out today, telling all of England that I’m getting a divorce and that I’m gay? Thank you, but I don’t need advice from a naive, over enthusiastic child who knows nothing about what’s really going on in my life.”
“What?” Hermione pulled him back to arms length and looked at him, “Are you certain?”
“I know, Harry,” Draco said, “Aviary and I figured that out.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “We are. But still, you thought instead of asking about that, it was a great idea to attempt to set me up with someone else?”
Harry barely registered the bang of the front door behind him as he paced on the porch.
“Well, I hope that works out. It’s an important thing, preventing prats like him from skating by,” Harry directed his words to Draco, trying to convey he felt this could be more than a fluff piece.
Relief was washing over Harry. So that’s why Draco was at the match! For his job. Another fluff piece.
“Harry, I don’t really have another husband-wife ‘let’s not lie to one another’ talk in me right now,” she said matter of factly, “I’m not mad at you. I don’t care if you're friends with Draco Malfoy, and I understand why you didn’t want to tell me about it. Just don’t fucking lie anymore, and we’ll be fine. And also, if there is anything more to this story that Seamus didn’t blurt out last night, I’d love to know about it.”
Harry stared at him. Draco’s voice was weak, weaker than he had ever heard it. Harry realized Draco must have been holding this feeling in for so long. The feeling of desperately wanting to atone for your past but knowing that may never be completely possible.
“No, not at all,” Harry assured, “Healer Patrick asked for my help for the day, and I can’t pass that up. Not when I want to work in her department.”
Harry froze at these words, staring at his friend in alarm, “What?” he whispered slowly.
Harry reached into his coat pocket and found the little bag of owl treats he liked to carry around for this reason precisely. He tossed a treat into the air, which Oba caught as she flew towards the window and away. Harry returned his attention to the letter, his head throbbing violently as he attempted to read Ida’s letter.
“Were your aunt and uncle Death Eaters?” Padma asked softly, looking tentatively at Ida. Harry quickly tuned back into the conversation.
“Like Healer Patrick?” Harry finished.
“Ron…” Harry tried again, pulling Ron back to arms length, “I need to know if Draco is okay. He ran into the thick of about a dozen killing spells.”
Ida raised an eyebrow as she spoke, “You reckon he should have sent a memo to St. Mungos?”
“He was still talking to Nott the last time I checked,” Brayan answered.
“And I like Draco. He’s fucking awesome. I don’t know where any of us would be without him,” Ron stated.
Seb smiled softly and leaned over to kiss Aviary. The two of them had begun dating, ironically, after Seb had come over to Harry’s house during a party to ask Harry if he wanted to give a relationship a shot. After the initial awkwardness as Harry explained he was dating Draco now, Seb and Aviary had gotten to talking. Now, here they were, about two years later, more in love than ever.
“My eyes are up here, Draco,” Harry said softly.
“What does that prove?” Luna argued, “Books don’t prove anything.”
Draco hit the table hard with his fist, “It’s positively evil. And it all makes sense. Instead of simply killing muggles and muggleborns, Kareach is stopping bloodlines in their tracks. It’s also spreading farther and quicker than it would if they were simply slaughtering hoards of muggles and muggleborns.”
Harry watched as Ron helped Hermione out of her chair and to her feet. As they made their way to the door, Ron turned around to face Draco,
“Or maybe,” Ginny said, “You have dealt with your own problems, by yourself, for so long that you refuse to take real help from anyone. I do the same thing. Every day. I have thought for so long that it made me look weak to take real, authentic help from people. That’s what scared me about Blaise for so long. He’s always so eager to help, to make things better,” Harry looked away at this, knowing the reason this felt foreign to Ginny is because he was never so readily available for Ginny to confess her own feelings.
The two locked eyes for a second before Draco looked down at his book and began to read in his usual focused manner. Is this what Ron felt? Looking at Hermione all those years? Admiring what a powerful determination and refusal to give up could do? Harry shook himself. Draco wasn’t his to admire. Ron and Hermione always belonged to each other, despite their weak attempts at romance before seventh year. He and Draco weren’t that. Harry had a wife who was supposed to be the Hermione to his Ron. She had been, for years. Or at least he thought she had been. But regardless of everything, he couldn’t sit here and admire the amazingness that was Draco Malfoy when he had a wife and kids at home. Suddenly he felt selfish and, well, just terrible.
“She didn’t have time to figure it out,” Ron explained, “She left immediately after hearing this in the hopes of getting help from the other Aurors. We all rushed to help as soon as she told us, but we were too late. Remmins was already dead by the time we got there.”
“Nicely put, Gin,” Harry said softly.
“Yes,” Scorpius answered, “He has started to work with muggle newspapers so it only made sense for him to start using their form of communication,” he continued, giddy now,  “I only wish I could have one! I mean, owl post is wonderful, but I have many friends in school who have never even heard of owl’s being used for delivering letters!”
“Harry, how are you?” Luna inquired, leaning towards Harry. He watched as her large earrings, shaped as hummingbirds, dangled wildly around her head.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and turned to look at James and Al, who were now fighting quite loudly over whether or not the triple back flip was possible, leading to Al grabbing James’s scarf and running away wildly.
Draco was looking around as well, his wand still gripped tightly in hand. When he noticed Harry, his eyes seemed to darken and he turned away and rushed to help a healer. Harry stared at him until he heard a familiar, and very frantic, voice coming from behind him.
His mind raced at an impossible speed as he considered this. Blaise? What in the hell? He had been telling himself for the past couple weeks that Draco and Blaise were a couple. Had he been wrong?
“What’s therapy?” Albus asked as he grinned at Lily and flung a bit of scrambled eggs on her plate using his fork.
“Ah,” Harry said, “Have fun then.”
“Why didn’t you two work with me?” Aviary asked, “I would have gladly bugged someone!”
“I’m here to apologize, Ginny,” Harry stood up to walk towards Ron and Ginny, “And to make sure you know that what I did was never out of spite. That nothing I ever do towards you will be out of spite.”
“You’re right,” he sighed, running a hand anxiously through his hair, “You’ve done nothing but listen kindly. I’ve worked hard to not resort to waspish and cold tactics when I’m upset, and I can’t revert back now that I’m at a low.”
“Kamusta, Harry,” Ida laughed as she set done the scones on a small jeweled table (she had also designed the table; the girl was a machine) and patted Harry on the shoulder, “Guess you lost those Auror-like reflexes, bes.”
Ginny laughed, “I’m nervous to ask what you think about Blaise.”
To Harry’s immediate amusement, Malfoy was leading a long, slender creature on a bright yellow leash towards him. As he neared, Harry recognized the animal as none other than the famous and previously unacquainted Murr, which Harry could confirm by the small collar along the ferret’s neck spelling out his name in bright, golden letters.
“I read in training about how stupefy can wear off quickly on people if they grow accustomed to it overtime! That’s something I wouldn’t be surprised if Aries was trained to do from a young age!” Harry exclaimed.
“You sure as hell won’t,” Ginny heaved a sigh and sat in a chair. Her anger seemed to dissipate as she stared blankly out in front of her. Finally, she turned to Harry and said, “Please don’t turn me into my mother. I don’t want to be the wife and mum that yells whenever anything goes wrong. Just let me know about things, okay? Stop being so distant. We’re a team.”
“We need to talk about this another time,” Ginny said stiffly. She reached for Albus and Lily and gestured for James to grab the floo powder, “Now’s clearly not a good time.”
Harry shook his head, “Not true! After I told you about Ginny and Blaise you lost your shit. After I told you about Draco you only wanted to talk about me cheating!”
“That’s what magic’s for.” Harry pointed his own wand at the offending mud and muttered “Scourify.” The mud vanished off the carpet within seconds. Turning back to Angelina, he said, “Ang, if I had known you had practice today, I wouldn’t have asked you to babysit. Ginny said it was your day off.”
To Draco, he said, “There. We can help from here, where you’ll be safe.”
“What? It’s what he wants to do,” James said defensively.
Awkwardly picking at his scone, Harry grasped onto the topic of quidditch and the upcoming match. Ida, thankfully, latched onto this conversation, probably just as relieved to change the topic as he was. But as the two joked about how ridiculous Aries looked in the robes he always wore for matches, Harry couldn’t ease the nagging feeling that Ida suspected more than she let on. And if she was upset with Harry being Draco’s friend, she sure as hell wouldn’t want Draco to be his… boyfriend? Love interest? Harry didn’t know. But he did know that not having Ida’s support would drive him mad. If one of his best friends in the world, who was intelligent and accepting, couldn’t get behind the idea of Draco, then how could he expect anyone else to?
Harry stepped into the fireplace and appeared fully in Ida’s living room. He glanced down at the papers she had been working on and noticed long lists similar to the ones has Draco made. One page had a large sketch of the quidditch pitch, labeled with places where the vendors were located and where most of the attacks happened.
Harry shuffled awkwardly, “I didn’t think non-work talk meant diving into my relationship. You do know I’m still married, correct?”
“But you weren’t… you…” Draco sighed, “You knew you… liked me. You could tell me straight to my face. I hid behind secret kisses and anger. You, on the other hand, were telling your kids we are dating.”
“Harry?...” the words sounded far away, distant, as if they were being said through water. But Harry knew that voice. It was Ron. But why was Ron there? Wasn’t Harry at work?
Harry sighed as he took a bite of his sandwich. The absence of Dean felt like a sharp pain in his side. It was a constant reminder of the terrific events of last week and what they had done to his dear friend. Harry began to feel a darkness spread over him; he couldn’t be here anymore. He could no longer stand sitting with his thoughts and feelings. Standing up, he grabbed his sandwich and threw the rest of it in the bin before heading back to the Ground Floor.
Astoria beamed and nodded in excitement, “Oh it is, Mr. Potter. Never boring.”
“Dad!” Al shouted.
“I had to!” Harry explained, feeling worse and worse the more he spoke, “There were too many reasons to think he was involved! I can explain everything. I did this all for the investigation, not for me.”
Seamus gave a small head shake. Harry looked at Draco, who was now crying softly too. He reached out and grasped Draco’s hand. Just then, the door opened and Ginny appeared.
Sure enough, after a moment of compressing darkness, he reappeared in Draco’s vibrant living room. Regret came slamming into him; what was he doing here? After the whirlwind of feelings he had just experienced, there was no way it was a wise idea for him to show up in Draco’s apartment, while his wife waited for him back at the hospital. What if Draco wasn’t even home? Harry had assumed he had gone home because he wasn’t in any of the conference rooms, but he didn’t know that for sure. He could be somewhere with his son, or at the pub, or Merlin knows where. Harry was considering apparating back to St. Mungos when a sliver of white came scurrying across the floor towards him.
She glared at Harry, “But you. You saved him! That’s when I knew… I had to take down both of you. I tried to prevent it, Harry. I really did. Despite all the lies, I counted you as a true friend. But I should have known I couldn’t trust you. The bloody Chosen One. You’ll have to die, just like the man you love. But don’t worry. I’ll kill him first, just to give you some time to reflect.”
“You think?” Harry said wearily, not wanting to associate any of his old colleagues with the actions of Kareach.
“She is going to be fine, mate,” Harry said sternly, although they both knew what had been done to Hermione was far from fine, “Go and help get others to safety.”
“Crazy how we’d like to hear that from him,” Ginny snapped.
“He is?” Harry asked rather faintly.
“No one’s betting!” Hermione piped up from Rose’s other side, “My child is not learning to gamble before she’s lost all of her teeth.”
Aviary looked at them both in shock, “Why? That’s not either of your jobs.”
Brayan beamed, “I wish I could stay and talk, but I have my own friend to get back to,” Harry watched as he waved at a woman a couple rows behind them.
“Don’t tell him that!” Ron chided, “He’s only just regained consciousness!”
Harry hung up the phone. The group looked at him, expecting him to say something.
Padma rolled her eyes at her sister while Lavender told her girlfriend,“Get a grip, Parv. Even if you have a crush on Blaise, you’re stuck with me.”
Harry opened the door of the Burrow to the smell of mashed potatoes, ham and something sweet (which Harry hoped was Molly’s blueberry crumble, his personal favorite). Weekly Sunday lunches at the Burrow never failed to be the highlight of Harry’s week. Nothing rang in the start of a new week quite like Molly Weasley’s renowned cooking and an afternoon of laughter.
“Calm down, Seamus,” Harry looked at him in surprise, “I’m beginning to think you actually have a crush on Blaise. If you’re having an affair with him as well, now’s the time to say.”
Harry let out a laugh at this. James had a point; Harry had never met a kid more at ease with who he was. James was confident and direct, but also kind, generous and thoughtful.
Dean noticed him as Harry made his way over, “Oi, Potter!” he said, gesturing to a seat next to him, “Come sit down!”
“Harry, you know that’s not true!” Padma said, “We all worked with Ida and none of us had any idea she was anything but an Auror and a friend. We can’t blame ourselves. The only person we can blame is her, for the people she took from us. Current and future.”
Laughing, James nodded, “Al says he’s got it. Which could mean Lily’s on fire or something worse, but we have to hope for the best,” he got up and started heading for the door. He paused in the doorway and turned around and continued, “And I’ll make sure Al doesn’t call Lily a wanker if that makes you feel better.”
Harry exchanged a look with Ron and Ginny and then crossed the floor of his living area to the front hallway. In his front entrance was Aviary Dover, a look of pure terror on her face.
“Noted,” Malfoy said, walking towards the line without turning back.
After Harry left Seb, he fire called Ginny and kids and told them he would be home after he made a stop at Hermione’s. He told Ginny he had a question for Hermione visa ve healing, which was a lie. Harry supposed that because of the real purpose of his visit, he was in the clear for a lie tonight.
A moment later, Angelina appeared in the doorway, one hand holding on to her five-year-old daughter, Roxanne, the other wrapped around what looked like the entirety of her quidditch equipment. Her long dark hair was barely held up in a windblown ponytail, and she was still wearing her bright blue and gold quidditch robes. At the sight of James, Albus and Lily, Roxanne abruptly dropped her mother’s hand and ran for the Twister mat. From behind her, another small figure pushed around his mother, brimming with excitement as he screamed, “James! Al! Lillllllly!” and disappeared into the thick of the Twister game.
Draco still looked shocked, but Harry cut in to whatever question he was about to ask by saying, “Let’s go and dance.”
Between Ginny and Blaise was their own daughter, Vella. Vella had been born about a year before, making her almost the same age as Lacey. Seamus and Dean had adopted Lacey a little less than a year ago.
“Wow, good one. That’s going to hurt for awhile,” Seb said sarcastically.
“No! My family deserves the truth! I can’t lie and sneak off with you all the time!” Harry was unsure why he was becoming so mad, but he felt out of control and extremely on edge.
The rest of them stood near the edge of Dean’s bed, holding onto each other. Dean looked like all the patients post- poison-- frail and tired, skin tinged with an odd orange that could be seen even with Dean’s dark complexion. The terrors of the attacks felt stronger than they had ever before as he looked at Dean. It was bad enough knowing innocent muggles were victims to their merciless attacks. Now one of his closest friends was lying weak on a hospital bed, when he should be out there helping victims. Harry began to shake uncontrollably. He reached for Ginny and she hugged him again, murmuring soft words in his ear. He needed to protect them. All of his friends, family. No other muggleborns or purebloods trying to help would die on his watch. He may not be an Auror any more, but he had Draco. He was going to help if it was the last thing he did.
Harry was stopped from responding to Caser as a Healer came hurrying over to him and the rest of the group, who had filed into the main room of the Ground Floor.
“So…” Draco gave Harry a questioning look.
Draco at the moment; what he needed to focus on was his friends. When Draco finished speaking, Dean was sobbing into Seamus’s shoulder while Seamus held onto his husband like a lifeline.
“I’ll keep my eyes peeled for anything suspicious,” Harry reassured Luna.
Seb turned around now to see what Harry was staring at. Draco turned around on his heel and walked out of the pub.
“I know, Harry,” Draco snapped, “We’ve looked through all the books and found nothing. But while you may have given up searching, I still look through books every possible day I can.”
“I thought so!” Ron exclaimed, “I thought you didn’t believe the whole ‘he’s changed’ mantra everyone has been saying!”
Parvati pulled a face and said simply, “Then I’ll be forced to ask Seamus to fill the position. I’m sure he’d be honored.”
“I will,” he lied. He watched as Padma went into the room and greeted Ida, who also gave her another big hug. He then walked out of eyesight and apparated straight into Draco’s apartment, banking on the wards being open to him.
“Harry!” shrieked Ginny, running the length of the hallway towards him, “What in the actual fuck did you do?”
“Yes,” Ron answered.
“If it were Blaise, or Pansy,” Draco whispered, “I’d probably have to tell them.”
Lily looked between her mother and brother, then shook her head softly, “I believe Al. I never liked Aunt Ida.”
“Don’t worry about it. Blimey, Ang, set your stuff down before you collapse!” Angelina was now trying to balance her knee pads while keeping a firm hand on her broom.
Ginny was still at practice (they were running longer and longer as they neared the tournament, which was now officially pitting the Cannons against Puddlemere United), and his kids were at Molly and Arthur’s for the evening. This left Harry plenty of time to crash whatever plans Draco had for the evening (which no doubt already involved Kareach) and ask him to take Harry back as his ally in eradicating Dark organizations. Now, Harry thought, that was a sentence he’d never could have imagined being anything but a ridiculous joke. Telling himself to focus, he grabbed a handful of floo powder and used his wand hand to light a fire. He then threw the powder into the fireplace and shouted ‘Draco’s apartment!” He stuck his head in and watched as a living area formed around him.
Harry stared at Draco, who was now breathless and running an anxious hand through his hair. He felt numb, his whole body was cold. Draco had been living in remorse for nearly fifteen years and had spent all of his career making up for the person he had been. Harry felt a sudden surge of pride to be his friend, to get to know this new Draco, however confusing he might be.
“Cheated!” Ginny burst, “I cheated on you!”
Harry checked the large clock on Ida’s wall, “They are? It’s 3:11 in the morning!”
“You know what?” Draco tore the curtain completely open and spoke directly to Walburga, “My parents taught me awful things. Do you know why? It’s because they came from awful ancestors with disgusting beliefs, just like yours! You should be proud that the Order was based out of your house. They changed the wizarding world for the better. This is where I wish I would have been throughout the war. And I realize I’m shouting this all at a painting, but I don’t care! I’ve wanted to scream at my ancestors for so long, and this is the closest I can bloody get!”
So when Harry walked back into the living room, where Ginny was sitting silently on the couch, he decided he would not tell her. Not now, maybe not ever. Their family deserved that.
“Yeah, after what?” James piped in, to which Ginny shot him a look and told him to take his siblings up to get ready for bed.
“Al, Rose,” Harry breathed, still taking in the magnificent replica, “It’s incredible! You got every single detail on Darren, down to his scar!”
Wizards and witches were passing every which way, frantically handing off paperwork and apparating into thin air. Many passing Aurors had a look of nervous triumph. There was no doubt in Harry’s mind a confession had been made today.
“That’s where I came in,” Padma explained, “I managed to escape through the lift and go down and bring in reinforcements.”
Draco nodded stiffly, “I know it was an accident.”
Harry let out a laugh; the first real one he had given in days, “Are you sure it wasn’t you staring at my arse?”
Padma laughed loudly at this, to which Parvati turned to her sister and snapped, “You think he’s cute, too!”. To her wife, she responded, “Blaise’s attractiveness has nothing to do with this! I am allowed to be curious about what Seamus has to say.”
Malfoy grimaced slightly at this and Harry immediately felt a twinge of regret. Realistically, if Molly and Narcissa Malfoy got together, they would talk about anything but something as colloquial as their love for a famous witch.
“And you cheated without telling me,” Harry said deliberately, “We’ve both been leading our own lives, haven’t we?”
“Where is Hermione Granger- Weasley’s room?” he demanded, his voice bordering on violent.
Ida frowned and began to undo one of the multiple braids swirling around her head, “No. That was a moment of weakness. I’m holding on to Filippino endearments, as they are far superior.”
Harry wondered what Malfoy was doing again in the hospital. He looked around for Astoria but didn’t see her anywhere in the canteen. Dean was now looking curiously at Harry.
Harry laughed, “That’s always a good thing.”
“I do, Harry,” Draco whispered, “I forgive you.”
Before thinking, Harry said, “Yes! I’ll meet you in ten.”
“Seb…” Harry warned softly.
“Thank goodness,” Darius breathed a sigh of relief, “I can’t believe you, and so many others, won’t be able to have any more children. And it’s all because of my own father. My whole life, I’ve never known my father, but I always imagined him as someone who was like me. Who worked hard for a greater good. I thought I couldn’t know him because my mom didn’t want to involve him in a life with a witch. But I was wrong, I couldn’t know him because he was the exact opposite of the man I have become. He is someone who wanted the destruction of others and went to great lengths to find a way to do just that. It’s just so… devastating.”
“Sorry!” Seb called, “I forgot to tell you my guest room was designed by a person with either no taste or no eyes!”
“Here’s the plan,” Draco began.
“Ron…” Harry said softly, “There were about a hundred things happening in the canteen at once. You were paying attention, and you were doing your job. Do not blame yourself.”
Harry froze. He and Seb had gone to get tea twice since they talked in the canteen. Harry had enjoyed himself and he had mentioned it to Ida, but he had been so obsessed with Draco and the investigation lately that he hadn’t thought about the tea outings as anything more than two new friends getting to know each other. He supposed he did find Seb attractive, but he was nothing compared to Draco. Yet as Harry looked at Ida’s expectant face, he figured it was best to let her believe Seb was Harry’s sexual awakening for the time being.
Dean and Seamus looked at each other, unspoken questions and answers in their eyes.
Blaise swatted him on the arm, “I’m not, you wanker! I’m just surprised! I’ve known Blaise for awhile now, and I had no idea he and Ginny were involved at all,” he made a face as if he were considering it, “Although, I suppose it makes sense. He did spend an awful lot of time at Cannons practice when I told him they had been monitored enough.”
Harry said goodbye again and backed out of the fire. He sat staring at the flames, listening to Aviary and Draco approaching from the side.
Harry didn’t have to. A moment later, Draco appeared in the center of the room.
“I’m not going to talk about it! I just wanted to say, I heard a rumor that you were gay, and if that’s true, I want you to know I’m here to talk. I understand what it’s like to come to terms with who you are, and if you ever need someone to hear you out, I’m here. It doesn’t have to be now, or soon, or ever, but it could be whenever you need it,” Seb finished hurriedly, looking nervously to the side.
“Harry,” Hermione reached for his hand, “You just told me you can’t do that anymore. Whether or not you and Draco ever work out, you need to tell Ginny. Everything. You can’t live a lie. We all know better than anyone that life is unpredictable and so, so fragile. We all managed to get through hell to have the lives we have today. You of all people deserve full and complete happiness.”
“What’s going on?” he asked desperately, “Who’s the suspect?”
“Where’s our explanation!” Draco demanded, causing Harry to kick him underneath the table.
Ginny turned to Harry and yanked him off the floor. She then turned to James, “Why would you say your father cheated on me with Mr. Malfoy?”
“No, don’t worry, Ron,” Harry maintained, “I want to know everything.”
“I’m always sure,” Harry said simply, starting as he realized Lily had fallen and scraped her knee on a sidewalk. As Harry rushed to her and used magic to carefully repair her wound, he realized that he meant it.
The score was now one-twenty to one hundred with Puddlemere leading. This was causing rather foul language from Ron, who at one point shouted that, “Angelina was too fucking good to be allowed to play!”, causing a laugh of triumph from George and a scolding from Molly. Thankfully the intensity of the match was lessened as the group spotted a man wheeling a concession cart. If anything was going to bring a family together and simultaneously distract Harry from his feelings, it was food.
Ron nodded, “We need to get ready. You two finish evacuating the first floor.”
Ginny nodded slowly, “I think so,” she shook her head, “I still get this feeling that I’m destroying our kid’s childhoods. I mean, Lily won’t even remember a time where her parents are together.”
“Save it,” Seb said harshly, standing up, “Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.”
“Mr. Granger- Weasley,” Darius looked Ron firmly in the eye, “None of this is your, or any of the other Aurors, with notable exceptions of course, fault. Ida knew what she was doing. From what Draco told me…”
Harry nodded, tears coming to his eyes before he could stop them. The thought of telling Dean and Seamus any of this terrified him. What if they were still seriously considering surrogacy? Of course they could adopt again, but what if that’s not what they wanted? They didn’t deserve to have this taken away, regardless of their situation.
“That one never seems to get old,” Ginny said, shaking her head at her brother, “Your level of humor never ceases to amaze me.”
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Harry said, “They like you. I think it’s mainly because they like Scorpius, but we’ll have to take what we can get.”
“And you didn’t think to tell me?” Ida snapped, her expression odd. She looked partly angry and partly… upset? Worried? Harry suddenly felt guilty for not telling her. Did Ida think he didn’t trust her?
“Many,” Reyes looked pointedly at Harry, “Your wife is a stubborn, tactless woman who should not be allowed to coach quidditch.”
“There’s no way that’s true!” Harry laughed, slamming his beer down in front of him, “It’s just too perfect, I refuse to believe it.”
“Harry, I can’t stop thinking about that. I feel like… a bad person! But Blaise…” she paused awkwardly, looking away.
Hermione cut off his ramblings with a hug. She pulled back and looked him straight in the eyes.
“There you go,” Harry said.
The next two weeks passed in a blur of unwanted conversations and desperate attempts to find normalcy before the holidays. Draco and Harry had gone to the Ministry together to talk to Ron and Padma. The two immediately recognized that the effects of Chann matched up perfectly with the observed effects of the attacks from the past year. With such a strong lead on what the poison from the attacks could be, Padma and Ron were readily willing to work with Harry and Draco. They understood how dangerous sharing their knowledge of Chann with the Ministry could be and agreed to keep the information between them until they could find out more about the potential culprits. Padma and Ron still refused to agree with the fact this was the work of Kareach, but that hardly mattered anymore. What mattered was they all searched for any signs of Chann being brought into the country. Which was substantially more difficult than it sounded (and it already sounded extremely difficult) because hardly anyone in England had ever even heard of the poison, let alone had heard of it being brought into the country. Draco believed that there had already been a stash in the country for many years, potentially brought in by someone the Ministry couldn't patrol. This left their investigation wide open and with too many loose ends to make much progress. Despite all these negatives, Harry found it was easier to be around Draco if they were all constantly in investigating mode. There wasn’t time to contemplate his complex and pesky feelings when he had a reproductive destroying poison to worry about.
“Malfoy,” Harry burst, slowly turning to look at him.
Tears welled up in Harry’s eyes as he looked back at his friend, “Thank you, Seamus. I can’t begin to tell you how much that means to me.”
“Harry!” she said abruptly, creating a path through the paperwork with her wand so that Harry could walk through the room and sit down besides her.
“I wouldn’t,” James piped in, “I’m pretty problem free.”
Harry felt numb with anger, “You are unbelievable,” he said harshly, moving past Draco and apparating in the hall.
Harry almost smiled at this, but then the reason they were all there came crashing around him. This wasn’t a meeting. He and Draco weren’t joking over tea. Aviary’s boyfriend had been murdered by one of his best friends. He knew the truth and he had no fucking idea what to do with it.
“You should be,” Lily piped up, “He could make it so you can’t move your body. Not even your eyes.”
“You always value hope above reality, Aviary,” Remmins spoke angrily, “And that’s why I fell in love with you! But it’s not always what I need!”
Aviary and Savant looked expectantly at Harry.
Silence followed Harry’s words. It took all that was left of his nerve to turn and look at Draco, who chose that exact moment to look back at him. Draco’s eyes were wide with an expression Harry didn’t quite recognize, one that made his stomach do cartwheels after one glance. Not knowing what to do, he opted for what he did best in awkward situations: talk.
“Fine,” he resigned, reaching out for his new glass of wine and taking a long sip, “But I want it to be noted I’d much rather talk about my pet ferret than the shambles of my career.”
Dean nodded as he slung an arm around Seamus’s shoulders, “Seamus has been waiting for this day forever. It would be impossible for him not to enjoy himself.”
He turned around and saw Luna. She was dressed in the most elaborate Christmas sweater he had ever seen (while Harry only had a Christmas tree on the front of his sweater, Luna was basically a living three dimensional tree, strung with lights and singing ornaments). She walked down the steps toward him and then waved her wand over her sweater dress to make it flatten against her so she could sit down properly next to Harry.
Harry sent her a side glare and watched as the room broke into confused questions. He reexplained to everyone how Draco was a decent bloke with good intentions and that they were just friends.
“Harry!” Remmins called groggily. He looked as if he hadn’t slept in days, “We are ready for you!”
Harry felt as if the floor had fallen out beneath him. Did Malfoy just say he was gay? What about his wife? His kid? What was happening? Had the rumor Seamus heard been true?
“You know you don’t mean that, Ron,” Padma implored, “You love this job almost as much as I do.”
“We are,” Rose shrugged, “But I wouldn’t mind it if you couldn’t talk or move.”
“I love you more, Gin,” Harry said, relief coursing through him, “And I’m sorry for being lousy.”
“I know what you are thinking,” Ida said, looking at Harry, “But she is a muggleborn who worked hard to get into one of the most challenging careers a wizard or witch can have. I know what it is like to be completely different from the rest of your family. I also know what it is like to work your arse off. She has promise, I know it.”
“No,” Malfoy said, slightly confused, “I thought you knew I got a divorce? Wasn’t it obvious before the interview?”
Sure enough, after a long painful couple minutes, in which Seb screamed almost continuously in agony as he finished his cure, Harry was re-introduced to the normal Seb as he laid back against his pillow and let his smile break out across his face.
He pats her on the arm, perfectly aware this is a lame gesture after the hug Draco gave her, and then pulls back to look at her. She straightens up and looks at both of them in turn.
Draco laughed lightly then abruptly pulled his arm away from Harry, his eyes darkening. He looked down at his arm. Harry followed his gaze to the faded dark mark printed on the underside of his arm.
He looked at his wife, the woman he loved and adored. The woman who he was raising three amazing kids with. Harry was a jumble of emotions and endless thought cycles. He couldn’t go on like this forever. The tears started before he could control them, running down his face messily and making Ginny wrap him in a fierce and protective hug.
As he reached the cook serving the pot pies, he gave his best smile and politely asked the witch if he could perhaps have two pies instead of one. The witch, whose name was Lacey, was one of the kindest people Harry had ever met. Harry had taken to talking to her oftentimes at the end of his lunch break when he finished with his food and the rush had died down.
“I worked with Ida for years and years and I never guessed any of this!” he pulled himself away from Ginny and went to stand over Ida, who was still lying stiff as a board, “I should have known!” he yelled down at her.
“James, don’t talk to your brother that way!”
“Yes, of course. She told me that you and her decided, mutually, that you would be better off apart. And from what she has told me, it sounds as though you are making the right decision. As for the accusation of Mr. Zabini, I don’t believe Ginny is completely in the right on that.”
“Dad?” James said softly, “Who did you accuse of the attacks? That’s what you and Grandma were talking about. And what mom was upset about last night, right? The attacks?”
“Because I heard you,” James explained, his voice much quieter than before. Harry knew he hadn’t expected Ron to get physical, “When you were floo calling the other day. You were saying that Harry was in love with Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco nodded, seemingly processing this, “So you don’t want to cut me out of the investigation and just work with Padma and Ron?”
“Get. The fuck. Out,” Draco’s voice rang out through the room, sending chills down Harry’s spine as he apparated to his home.
Harry beamed at the two of them, “I’m happy to see you are both enjoying your day.”
“Earth to Harry,” Dean waved a chip in front of his eyes, “What’s going on? You’ve been barely listening to me all break.”
Harry nodded, “Yes, okay. I should have started with that. Ginny and I talked on Christmas Eve and decided that we both were unhappy. She also told me that she had cheated on me with Blaise.”
Harry laughed shortly, “That’s true.”
Harry sighed heavily and drowned his drink in one gulp. Standing up, he moved to get one last look at the pub before heading goodness knows where. He couldn’t go home now, surely, when he was still too mad at his friends to apologize for his outburst. That’s when he saw it- blindingly bright blond hair reflecting the dim lights shining from overhead. Harry moved without thinking towards Malfoy.
Malfoy looked utterly confused. He stared at Harry for a moment, as if he was a puzzle he could never solve, and let out a loud laugh.
The three of them sat in silence, not knowing quite what to say. They had all focused on making sure this part of the plan went smoothly that they forgot the hardest part was actually waiting to hear what information they would learn from the bug. Harry supposed he could think of it as an opportunity to have intel on the attacks he had been helping work to stop for months and months, but it felt more like waiting for disaster to strike. What if they were too late? What if something was already happening, something they weren’t aware of? What if Ida had already given a message to her fellow Kareach members?
“Then we need a plan,” Draco said, standing up off the ground, “And lucky for you two, I excel with those.”
“Are you happy now? You got the full confessional and emotional breakdown of three drink Draco.”
Harry could feel his level of anger quickly rising. However, he was at work, and he couldn’t start a fight with one of his patients. He knew Aries knew that and would be trying to provoke him to get Harry into trouble. So Harry began to take Aries temperature and check his heart rate without another word while Aries sat with a smirk on his face. At least Aries wasn’t his cousin. He felt a pang of sympathy for Ida.
“Harry?” she whispered, stunned.
“So how am I alive? How is Draco alive?” Harry asked,
“Noted,” Healer Savant said briskly. He looked around at the Aurors, “I’m not paying you to stand around! We have a crime scene to finish!”
“Grab her,” Harry told James, who had already moved to stop his sister from escaping. Turning back towards the stairs, he yelled up at Albus once again, “We are leaving, Al!”
Draco paused, letting the name ring in the small room, “Harry, this poison has effects I had never heard of. It wasn’t intended to kill the victim. In fact, with proper spells, all of their victims were typically good as new after the ingestion. No, the poison was meant to do much more than punish just the one person. This community believed that if someone committed an offense, it was likely their offspring would cause the same problems. See, they believed criminal acts were hereditary.”
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Harry hung up the phone and threw it at the wall. He watched as the phone collided with the bright yellow walls and exploded, the pieces scattering across the floor.
“I’m not worried,” Al snapped, glaring at his brother, “I just don’t think he should threaten me and then get our little sister on board.”
“And I’m not the only one with an ex-Slytherin best friend, now am I?” Seamus asked, looking at Harry.
“Without you, Hermione could have been much worse off,” Ron said, “She may not have even made it. I can’t express my gratitude enough.”
“Well, I ought to be off,” Harry said, nodding at the two of them, “I can’t avoid the interview forever.”
Draco smiled softly, unexpectedly, “There’s no way Weasley believes you are reading these books for training. I didn’t get to witness your Hogwarts studying habits firsthand, but I’m sure they were abysmal.”
“I mean… the way she looked at Hermione. Or Dean. When she thought no one was looking. I chalked it up to general mistrust of people or just a resting angry face. She is an Auror, after all. But something always felt, like I said, off with her. Like she was holding back something,” Ginny finished.
“Like I said before, I’m not some gay rebound,” Draco spat.
Harry had spent all of the past two days at the hospital, working tirelessly to aid the Healers in the recovery of Muggles from the mysterious potion used by the Imperius attackers. Another attack had happened at a sports shop in the Greater London area. The attack had occurred only two weeks after the attack at the muggle shop in Yorkshire. Harry had been immersed in the consequences fully, as the scope of the attack meant the entire faculty of St. Mungo’s was instructed to help, including the trainees. He spent the entire weekend following rapid orders from Healers. Five Muggles did not recover from the poison, and over one hundred were infected and brought into Mungos. After coming home last night, despite his all-consuming exhaustion, Harry had called Ron, Padma and Ida to find out how they were holding up and whether they were any closer on leads. Technically, Harry knew it was not a wise decision to be calling the department's top Aurors looking for information on an open case, but Harry was desperate. He felt a large amount of guilt. Harry had left the Auror department while the Imperius attacks were still underway. Even though it had seemed the attacks were ending, Harry should have known better. Things like this never just disappear. Harry was part of the team working to stop the attacks that threatened Muggles and Muggleborns alike. It was irresponsible of him to leave before the case was solved. He was leaving Ron, Padma, Ida and the rest of Aurors a near impossible and dangerous case. Although he had no doubt they were the best team to bring justice to the attacks, Harry still felt like leaving to become a Healer was a reckless decision.
“It’s always personal with you,” Draco retorted, “Everything has to be about star Potter. So when you didn’t get the attention you needed from me, you used my friend as a scapegoat.”
Malfoy gave a short laugh and shook his head, “She’s done nothing of the sorts. As you can see,” he gestured across the bar, “She’s a little too preoccupied to talk to me at the moment.”
Ginny gave a sudden stiff laugh that caught Harry off guard, “I don’t think this is how these conversations are supposed to go,” she said feebly.
Rose and Hermione left (Ron had left hours ago, claiming a stomach ache), leaving Ginny and Harry standing alone in their entry hall. The silence that fell over them after the noisy affair that was Christmas Eve felt suffocating. All Harry could focus on was the gaping hole in their marriage, the one that told him they were missing something Harry never knew they needed. Something Harry thought wasn’t possible. Something that Draco made him feel every damn time he talked to him.
Harry was about to ask about a rather stunning necklace sitting on a pillow, when Draco said, “So, where’s the rest of my apology?”
Harry’s entire stomach dropped to his feet. He felt his pulse raising, the wall’s closing in around him. This couldn’t be happening. Them wanting a baby was a complete uncertainty, something they had been doubtful about for years. This was the worst possible time for them to make the decision. As the room broke into shouts of congratulations and hugs as Seamus and Dean explained further their decision, Harry sat in stunned silence, not knowing what to do or say. He barely registered Louis reaching for his hand.
“Wait!” she blurted. Harry stopped and turned around reluctantly, already knowing what she was going to ask.
“And you act as if she will be all alone,” Arthur cut in, feigning mock offense, “I am capable of helping, you know.”
Molly glanced over at Harry, her eyes suddenly filled with the warm concern he associated with his mother-in-law.
“Oh, there’s more. You also wouldn’t eat anything on the menu at any place we went besides blueberry scones. Not to mention the hour I spent listening to you rant about the lack of food you like in the canteen. It sounds as though you’ll eat about two meals out of the approximately forty they serve and you’ll only eat the blueberry crumble for dessert. That’s picky, my dear friend.”
“Blaise?” Ron looked up in surprise, “Why?”
“I trusted her!” Harry screamed, “With my life! She was one of my best friends! I told her things that I haven’t told anyone. I thought I knew her!”
“Well, I think Ron would have Ginny murdered if she left the Cannons, so I wouldn’t want that on your conscience if I was you.” Harry replied.
A moment passed and then the two came together in a passionate kiss. Harry turned away, not wanting to be an interlude to the moment. He wondered when this had begun. A numbness settled over him as he silently wished he had the bravery to confess his own feelings for Draco. What if the time was never? What if his crush was pointless and Draco already loved Blaise? What if he never possessed the strength to tell Ginny they weren’t right for each, that he needed someone that made him feel like there was fire building in his lungs? All of this came suddenly to Harry and he could barely breathe. He couldn’t leave Ginny. Was that the solution? It couldn’t be. He would have to ignore his feelings. He couldn’t hurt his kids, his family, or his wife.
As Hermione finished talking, Harry pulled her into another hug. She rubbed his back as he sobbed. He was right to talk to Hermione. She said everything he needed to hear and more. He needed to talk to Ginny, because he couldn’t keep asking her to live an incomplete life with him.
“You two been working all day?” Harry asked as they made their way towards Ron and Padma’s office.
Al gave him a disappointed look but said nothing. Harry was surprised at the lack of argument, especially since Harry had given no actual reason as to why Albus couldn’t go and talk to Scorpius. He could only assume Al didn’t want to push his luck on a day like this; he knew Harry wouldn’t buy him sweets later if he misbehaved now. Sometimes Harry forgot how diplomatic his children could be. Leaning back, Harry happily listened as Luna and Al moved on from the topic of Wrackspurts to talk about the origin of the Puddlemere logo (there was surprisingly a lot of murder in Luna’s version). After awhile, though, Harry couldn’t help himself. He shot a glance at Draco and his friends and family. To his surprise, Draco was no longer sitting in his seat. Harry quickly looked around and found Draco walking down the bleachers towards one of the side entrances. Draco was moving at a quick and determined pace, causing Harry’s stomach to turn.
“My friend Scorpius has read about every book imaginable on magical creatures and he had never heard of Wrackspurts,” Al insisted.
Harry looked at the portrait in surprise. He had never heard Walburga talk so kindly. She began to look almost excited as she realized who Draco was, something Harry could have never imagined on a face he had grown accustomed to having scream at him.
With that, the room sloped away from the topic of Draco Malfoy and back into the wedding planning of Parvati and Lavender. Grateful for the distraction, Harry mentally prepared to make up with Ginny, Ron and Draco later. If he ever figured out what to say to them, of course.
Ron nodded and he and Hermione left the room. Draco walked over to the bed and bent down, giving Harry a painfully slow kiss.
“I know what the poison is,” he said intensely, locking eyes with Harry.
Healer Patrick said a goodbye to Seb and gestured for Harry to follow her outside into the hallway. But instead of speed walking down the hall to a new destination, she stopped right outside Seb’s door.
“No more lies,” he said to her.
“Hi, Hermione,” Harry said, passing Lacey to Draco as she was reaching for him.
Harry felt a blaze of rage as hot as the flames build up inside him. Ida was sitting across from Savant, talking urgently with her boss. Harry had known that Ida being in the office was a strong possibility, but he still wasn’t prepared to see her sitting there, so at ease, acting as if she was legitimately concerned about saving the lives of innocent muggleborns. He couldn’t hear what they were saying; a charm was put on the fireplace that prevented any caller from hearing what they were saying until a person in the room lifted the charm. Everything in Harry was telling him not to break the charm. He wanted to back away and never see Ida ever again. Her betrayal felt like a fresh wound. He couldn’t believe that this kind and fiercely determined woman, who wove her hair in elaborate braids and liked to go to the pub with Harry as a post-Christmas tradition, was the same person who killed dozens of innocent people. For a moment, Harry considered the possibility that Aviary was mistaken. But then he remembered the steely sureness of her voice, the pure hatred and disappointment Aviary now held for someone she considered a great friend. Ida was guilty. Harry would have to deal with his anger and damaged emotional stability later.
“That’s why I was calling you earlier, before you grabbed me and took me to the dirty house of my ancestors,” Draco explained, “I found out something more about the case!”
Harry smiled, thinking of his wife pouring over plays late into the night; the fierceness in her eyes when she talked about her team, the Chudley Cannons. “That I can’t argue with.”
Harry caught his breath and shook his head, “I still have no idea what the very important life altering case is about. I feel like that’s a key detail to leave out of your rant.”
“Harry!” Molly cut in, looking relieved to have a reason to stop Fleur’s tangent. Molly and Fleur got along well, much better than they did when Fleur was first engaged to Bill, but Harry knew Fleur’s ability to talk without end could get to Molly.
Ron was giving him a strange look as they sat in silence.
Draco broke his eye contact with Harry and looked down at his feet, “It’s okay, Harry. What we are doing isn’t easy.”
“I mean, you talked about him all the time,” Seamus pointed out.
“I couldn’t agree more,” Harry concurred.
After the hug broke up, Harry whipped away the tears forming in his eyes.
Harry looked at him, laughing in the most un-Draco like way he could imagine, and began to feel himself lose his edge. Soon he was laughing too, reaching out a hand to balance himself on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry held up his hand to silence both of them, “Aviary,” he began, “We know the poison, but it is irrelevant right now. We can talk about it more after I catch Draco up. Draco,” he turned to Draco, looking in the piercing grey eyes, “I have a lot to explain.”
“Ten minutes!” Molly exclaimed, “You said it was less than two!”
“And who says I won’t be needing it myself?” Dean asked.
“But I would look so fine in dress robes,” Seb said, batting his eyelashes for emphasis.
Aviary nodded. Something flashed in her eyes: determination, resilience, injustice. She was ready to fight.
What they were doing. What was that exactly?
“Avada K…”
“Draco?” Ginny asked, “What are you doing here?”
Harry looked away as a blush formed on his cheeks, “So? What does this have to do with me?”
“Okay, yes,” Harry admitted, “I told Hermione.”
“How?” Harry whispered. Ron didn’t answer. He was shaking uncontrollably as he stared at the wall.
The joyous cheers were rapidly declining into one’s of fear, of pain. Instinctively, Harry reached down to grab his daughter. He then looked frantically around the stands, trying to figure out what was going on. From what Harry could tell through the thick commotion, many people had collapsed from their seats onto the ground. Imperius attacks. Harry grabbed his wand, ready to fight, when a scream he knew all too well rang out over the chaos. Turning towards the sound, Harry saw the thing he feared most; Ron, screaming and rushing towards a figure lying on the ground. Without hesitation, Harry handed Lily to Al, who was sitting in shock next to him. He shouted to Molly and Arthur to apparate his kids away. Then he rushed over to where Ron is crouched over on the ground, already firing spell after spell on his poisoned wife.
“Thank you for letting me cry,” she said, her voice soft and rough.
Draco nodded. Harry could tell he was relieved to see a room that wasn’t decorated like his childhood home. Aviary turned to Harry,
“I will never understand you, Potter,” Malfoy said in a strange tone, but thankfully he lowered himself back into his seat.
Harry shot him a hurt look, trying desperately to ignore how blue Draco’s eyes were. And they were so fucking blue.
If this were a couple weeks ago, Padma would have aired her doubts with Harry over a theory without any Auror found evidence to back it. But she didn't even bat an eye as she said, “Okay. What do I do?”
“Don’t tell me what to do, cheater!” James shouted.
After Hermione finished speaking, the room fell quiet again. Harry took in what Hermione was saying. She was right: he would always worry for his kids, his family. But he knew there was goodness. Just thinking about Draco; how someone that was raised in a home that valued the subjugation of muggleborns now almost died to bring down an organization that believed in just that. If something like that was possible, anything was.
She asked this as if she already knew there was someone else. He wondered worriedly if she suspected anything about Draco. Deciding to ride the Seb train and ride it hard (excuse the double entendre), he said, “You’re right, Ida. Don’t act so smug about it, but yes. I like Seb.””
“That sounds nice,” Al said thoughtfully, using his fork now to eat his eggs, “I would like some therapy.”
“It means life is a fucking disaster, but that doesn’t mean everything is terrible,” Padma shrugged, “There’s a good in the center of everything. You just have to get through the shitty parts.”
He waited impatiently for Malfoy to show up as Lily finally made her way to Rose and Al and the two gave Scorpius a turn with the kite. Sorpius clearly could not have been happier. Harry was watching Scorpius trying to complete the triple back flip stunt when a familiar voice sounded at his shoulder.
“That’s amazing,” Harry smiled softly as he looked in turn at both of his friends, “Truly. I know you two will make incredible parents.”
Ginny nodded in agreement. While Harry couldn’t deny taking on this job was a brave risk for anyone, something about the situation felt off. Blaise had been in Games and Sports the entire time he was at the ministry. Why would he suddenly want a position so vastly different from the job he loved? As Ginny and Hermione continued to talk, their voices faded around him as he continued to think about Blaise Zabini.
“With?” Harry asked.
Before Harry had to dive into this discussion, Seamus spoke, “Both Oliver and Ginny are the best coaches/captains this league has to offer,” he paused for emphasis, “Which is why I, personally, am beyond excited for the upcoming championship match!”
“Ida!” Harry said, but it was pointless. She had already looked up.
Arms wrapped around him, “He’s going to be okay, Harry,” Ginny murmured, “We’re all going to be okay.”
In all honesty, Harry had no idea how Hermione was doing now, but he nodded.
“I respect that, I really do. But it kinda seems as though you gave up after looking at one page of a name book,” Malfoy said.
Without another word, Draco raised his wand and disappeared into the blackness of the night, back to his son and ex-wife and another world Harry would never be a part of.
“None of this matters, anyway,” Angelina responded, “Because Oliver is the one actually making the plays. And, as I am sure George and Harry would corroborate, Oliver is a fantastic captain.”
Aviary said Ida’s name as if it tasted disgusting in her mouth.
Harry looked at Ida in shock, “You did? Why?”
Harry looked back at Seb, trying to figure out what he wanted. Many people he met only looked for friendship with him so that they could get in the Prophet for being associated with ‘The Chosen One’. Seb, however, had never seemed phased by the fact he was talking to Harry Potter. Maybe he was just a guy who needed some more good mates and Harry fit the bill. And Harry liked Seb a lot; he seemed like just the type of person Harry would be friends with.
Hermione nodded. She remained silent for a moment, and then she burst into tears.
“It was me, Harry,” Harry recognized the waspish voice as his wife’s.
“Is that even possible?” Harry asked.
Seamus leaped up, “I’ll take it! Paddy over here would be terrible.”
“Not when they are trying to attack St. Mungos! Not when…” he paused. He was about to say “Not when they are targeting Draco!”, but that would involve him explaining why Draco would be a target of Kareach. That would reveal to the Aurors that Draco was indeed investigating something they not only believed was fake but knew the Prophet wanted him to drop. He decided to stop trying to convince Aviary and Remmins at the moment. They weren’t going to believe his evidence, and they weren’t going to accept Draco’s position on the case. As of now, both the Aurors and Draco and Harry needed to continue what they were doing and hope someone could find evidence that actually helped then stop the attacks. The more he thought about all of this, the more he thought about how much danger Draco could be in. He needed to see him, make sure he was safe.
