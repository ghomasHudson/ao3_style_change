I open my mouth wide. I'm in shock, I really am. My tongue wags in my mouth, but I can't get it to move properly. I'm ready to spill everything, own up to the fact that I snooped around Mr Potter’s dirty underwear and smelly socks and found a very incriminating piece of evidence that proves that Mr Potter is up to no good, and not actually here to visit my father, but the tosser has the audacity to lay his hands on my father’s shoulders and smile at me as if I’m a poor simpleton child who can’t save his father from his inevitable fate.
Harry attempted to hide his shock, knowing that gawking would see him sent swiftly home, but the image was dreadfully frightening. The bark on Draco's back was alien, but workable. It was just an extra layer on the skin. Draco could still function, could still be himself in everyday life. He just had to wear a shirt and suddenly it was as if it didn't exist.
Draco's face turned white. Harry stepped forward, unsure whether to intervene or to listen to what the goblin had to say.
Malfoy seemed truly perplexed. He guessed he never heard of or had forgotten Hermione’s tirade on house-elf enslavement. She could understand the keeping of Kreacher as he was insanely loyal to Harry after the war, but after his passing Harry didn’t have the strength to convince Hermione that he needed another one. Plus he was used to doing most of the work himself anyway as Kreacher wasn’t really able to do much at all those last few years due to his age.
Once dressed, Harry exited his quarters, enjoying the sights and sounds of his crew working together on the
Draco yelled out 'Father' before turning loudly in his bed again. Harry rolled his eyes and adjusted himself in the bed, unable to stop himself from checking out Draco. This time Draco had pushed his sheet completely off, giving Harry quite a view.
Draco raised himself up a bit and bent down to kiss Harry. The kisses weren’t new, but the added benefit of being horizontal seemed to instantly take things to a higher intensity than before.
Once again the ship began to shake. All hands held onto whatever they could as magic zoomed around them as the ship returned to its wooden form. It then slowly lowered into the water smoothly, as if turning from a flying cloud into a pirate ship was a simple act.
'Harry's not old,' Luna interjected. 'He's only been on this earth thirty-two years, six months, and three days. Most wizards live more than a hundred years. My great-great grandfather lived for two hundred years and four days before he choked on a frog's leg.'
is a waste of paper that belongs in the rubbish bin. Do you know they fill their articles with quotes from me and yet have never actually interviewed me? My mother made a complaint once and the next day they printed that she liked to eat fairies raw.'
Snape walked outside, the bright sunlight blinding him for a moment. He walked toward the place where Draco had stood before.
‘He believed someone like you might come looking for it one day, but I can’t say I am pleased to hear it is so soon.’
Draco was leaning against his desk, his jean clad legs spread before him. They truly were never ending. His shirt, this time red, was still a t-shirt that belonged on a teenager in a garage band, not a professor. His hair was a mess, most likely he considered it "intentional disarray", but to Harry it looked as if Malfoy had just woken up from a nap. Harry was not the best person to be criticizing hair care, but he had heard it enough growing up from the blond that he was surprised to see the formerly helmet hair wearing person in front of him daring to allow his hair to be "messy" in public.
The island landscape continued to be astonishingly uninhabited. There was a relief to it, after living and working in crowded London, to be surrounded by untouched nature.
There were twelve houses on Privet Drive, six on the right and six on the left. Each was painted brown with one big window in the front and steps leading up to the front door. Number 2 had a window box filled with peonies, Number 7 had a bike lying on the lawn, and Number 4 had a tall lamp post in the front, its dim bulb shining in the dusky afternoon.
I trip over a side table, sending a kelp wreath flying to the floor. My cheeks feel hot and my eyes are suspiciously wet, so I'm having trouble seeing where I'm going. I hear my father shout my name, but I ignore it.
“Harry, the easel wasn’t the real gift to Teddy. My mother made me purchase it when she found out I wasn’t bringing a present to open to Teddy’s party. I spoke with my lawyers and they all advised me that this was the best thing for you and Teddy and Andromeda. I’ve brought over adoption papers and I think you should sign them.”
Snape was sitting at the small table reading the paper and sipping on his cup. Harry joined him, accepting the poured cup and adding a little honey to his.
My father shakes his head, a strange smile on his lips. He reaches out to grab my hand but I don’t want to be comforted, I want my father to see how foolhardy this all is.
"It also sounds like he doesn't know who took the Hat. Funny that they call it enemy number one, makes it sound like the Hat's a criminal."
Harry spun around, looking for where the sound came from. It sounded like Draco, but his mouth was now fully covered. How could he still hear him?
Harry didn’t know what to say. This had been Teddy’s request for the past few days but he couldn’t just tell Malfoy to go away.
While my speech certainly could have been better, Mr Potter is in for a real treat. When my father gets angry he's a scary sight to behold, and while I wandered a bit, the point was clearly stated. There is no way my father will allow Mr Potter to stay with us any longer.
“Don’t you want to try out your new bath toys? George bought you all those magical boats with singing pirates.”
And yet, it was surreal enough for Harry to walk into that forest many moons ago to face Voldemort, knowing that he was going to die.
Draco seemed to take Harry’s revelation very seriously. His face closing into a mask of deep concentration.
Well there was something new and exciting. He had come out to Andromeda and it didn’t seem really fair that she knew, and Malfoy knew, but Ron didn’t know. There never seemed to be a right time to tell him, but looking into his earnest face and the quiet around the house, he did the thing he had been doing for the last week: he opened his mouth and hoped for the best.
“Yeah, Andromeda’s already bought all the decorations. We also decided to invite some local kids that Teddy knows from that football class he took in the spring.”
He's wearing a black robe, loose and long. It's been years since I've seen something like that, and never in this house, my father trading his own fashionable robes for more casual wool cardigans and twill trousers. Mr. Potter's robe has no shape other than billowy and over Mr. Potter's wide shoulders it looks like a cape, the kind that comic super villains wear.
Harry looked over at Draco’s trousers that were crisp and ironed. His own clothes, dirty and dusty, seemed like a weight, slowly suffocating him. He began to panic until he saw Draco’s feet. They were bare, white, and knobby.
Harry suddenly felt very exposed. What did he want to know? Well the first things that came into his mind didn’t really seem like the questions he could ask Malfoy. He couldn’t see Malfoy explaining sexual positions to him. Harry blushed just thinking about it.
“I didn’t know what to do with it. One of my house-elves took it and framed it. They put it in my office.”
Then, a large cloud moved and suddenly the small blob Harry had seen far off in the distance bloomed into a large expansive land that loomed heavy in the sky. It was a mountainous island floating high in the air. The tree-covered green mountains were surrounded by a river of dark blue water that ended abruptly a few metres from its shore. And below the land was only air and clouds. It was an island suspended in the sky.
Harry had asked Hermione if she remembered if Malfoy had had a dark beauty mark on the back of his neck. She gave him a funny look before returning to her lecture on Harry’s bad hygiene habits.
"I don't really think those count. Just tell me where the Sorting Hat is and then we'll go back to shagging."
Draco turned. Harry had a hard time reading the look on his face. 'I'm not trying to pick a fight here, Potter.'
I skid to a stop, but the weight of the box is too much. I trip forward, the box precariously rocking in my arms. In order to save the box from a large, dangerous drop to the floor, I throw all my strength into my feet in order to move backward. I overcompensate and fall bum-first onto the hardwood floor.
It was a shame Harry couldn't say the same. 'It didn't seem like it. You have quite persuasive means of getting your way.'
During his search for the Horcruxes, Harry dreamt of a world without Voldemort and the constant attacks against his mind. The dream usually placed him back at Hogwarts, returning to the normal minutiae of schoolwork and Quidditch games. And yet now, when Harry imagined himself racing to class and searching for a clean tie underneath his bed, it all felt wrong. But what did that leave for Harry to do? He had never considered the possibility of not wanting to return to Hogwarts.
Harry patted the hull. 'It was better this way, old girl. But, I do have good news for you. We’ll be sailing again, you and me, and a few of the crew will be returning. But none of this action first, thought later business, okay? This time, we’ll make use of our heads before we get involved.'
My father slurps the rest of his coffee down and goes to put the empty mug in the sink. He comes back around to gather my dishes as well. "Finished? Or do you plan on poking at your cereal for the rest of the morning?"
Snape whacked Harry in the back of the head. “Next time write a letter. Go home, let us sleep, and come to visit Draco in the morning.”
Harry sat down in a chair petulantly. What was it today that made everyone treat him like a four year old?
Draco closed the book, smiling at his hands. “I think so. Some things need to be absorbed before they can be understood.”
"You are right on the first statement, she doesn't know about it because she doesn't care to. She hired me and forgot about me. She's never asked for a lesson plan and she's never observed my classroom. I've been doing things my own way for years now and I've never heard a word. Second, I doubt she would fire me. We are so short staffed right now she'd probably wave it off and tell me not to do it again, but I would because that woman can't remember a thing she says anymore."
Harry followed Dean to the quarterdeck, following where Dean was pointing. Far, far, into the clouds was a small black spot.
For a moment, Harry thought that Luna had just saved the day. Perhaps her presence would soothe the old man's fears.
Draco handed Harry a towel and Harry walked out of the bathroom. As soon as he dressed and left his quarters, Harry realized Draco had once again distracted him from asking any more questions about the quest.
“The interior of the home was destroyed, especially in the children’s bedrooms. One of the boys was about to go to a boarding school up in Scotland. His trunk was ripped clean in two.”
It was worse when we visited my grandfather and grandmother. My grandfather would curl his lip until it reached his nose when my father said it, and my grandmother’s eyes would fill with tears. My father would grab my grandmother’s hand, squeezing it in sympathy, until my mother gave an annoyed sigh and he let go.
'Listen to me, Harry,' Dean said firmly, his eye boring into Harry's. 'You may have made the decision, but if Luna or I didn't agree to it, we wouldn't have followed you. We all had the opportunity to leave you, and we didn't. We stayed on your ship, followed your missions, because we believed in you and what you fought for. We had no way of knowing Shiraq just wanted control of the country. We did what we thought was right.'

“You are the boy who was supposed to die! Had you, my parents would be would be alive and I'd be living the good life. Instead, I'm living in filth with filthy Muggles doing filthy things, and it's ALL YOUR FAULT!”
Harry looked down at the map Draco was holding and suddenly a large black dot appeared on the opposite side of the island. The goblin took a look at the map as well.
Feeling frustrated, Harry had grabbed a list and went door to door, hoping his instincts could guide him, like a divining rod, toward the right one. Rubbing his nose, Harry pushed on. Showing George Potter the badge, Harry hoped that this time this Potter would recognize it.
Nimbly, Draco slid over to the designated spot with his head hung low. He wrapped his arms over his knees and stared directly into my eyes. It was like he was trying to communicate with words left unspoken.
"Why don't you read it for yourself..." He placed two fingers on his temple and fell back onto the bed with a visual sigh.
I could tell it was earlier than usual when I woke up. The sun was barely over the Horizon, and the beds around me still had their curtains shut. Also-
Bending down, I explained to her the situation, "Hello! My name is Harry. If there's something you need you can ask one of the other workers, I'm afraid I lost my hearing and won't be able to know what you're saying."
It was a small crystal orb, with the night sky presented in the glass. The stars would change depending on the location of the magic, as well as the position of Earth. That way no matter where you were, it would always show the stars above. I figured that since it can be hard to see the stars, due to the fog, he might appreciate it.
He nodded and we threw out the wrappers on our way to the curb. We walked to find an empty alleyway to apparate back in, it was easier than earlier.
I don't even know what to say to that. I almost wish he hadn't been working on his sign language so much, that would have made this so much easier.
On closer inspection I noticed a dark clump leaning against a tree. I walked up to it and noticed that it was just a person wearing a cloak.
Draco had his head buried in his book. It was getting late so I thought it would be best to head to the dorms and get some work done.
All previous thoughts went out the window after my brief encounter with Mr.A and McGonagall. Once our classes were dropped off I booked it down the corridor. No, I have no clue where he was going, but it couldn't have been far right?
He really should be more careful about who he writes that kind of thing too. what if I left it on my dresser and Ron or, worse, Zacharias saw it?
He was probably just going on a walk or meeting with somebody else. I remembered the map was in my cloak. So, I headed back to the library.
I didn't want to be embarrassed further and I needed Draco to trust me that I wouldn't hate him for his past. It was something we never talked about. I'm still very unsure of how he sees his father or the things he was forced to do years ago.
He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. His eyes locked on mine and then down to his watch. In one fluid motion, he stood up.
We started out the door, "They really aren't that bad you know," I said in what I hoped was convincing.
He softened slightly, it was a beautiful sight. The sky was a murky grey, and the feel of people brushing my arms on the street made sure I knew I wasn't alone. It's times like these I really miss the ability to listen to my surroundings. My ears picked up a faint hum, but nothing more.
Later that night, as I was laying in bed, I couldn't help but smile to myself. Honestly, this year was turning out to be way better than I had imagined. Who would've thought that I'd be boyfriends with my arch-rival this time last year?
We still hadn't added every core class, but we were probably fine. The only cores left were Herbology and History of Magic. I could only take so much of Professor Binns's goblins and if I wasn't deaf I was pretty sure the Mandrakes would ensure I would never hear again. I didn't really like Muggle Studies, considering I was raised by them and there were about ten other classes that sounded better, but if it pissed Malfoy off it was worth it.
Before I knew it the scarf was around my neck. The Slytherin emerald and silver clashed with my robes.
I was hit with much more than just a spell that day. The realizations and experiences that would put my life on a much better track than they had been for years also came. These would start as problems and would morph into the most amazing things that could happen to me. I needed that constant in my life. The edge of always being imperfect and different.
Again just like the last morning, the dorms were practically empty except for three people. Ron soon left again, without a word.
He signed, before taking the necklace out of my hands. He muttered a quick incantation, and the snitch began to grow. The cord morphed into the outer wings of the ball, and it began to fly around Draco's hand.
Entering the common room felt nice. I could have slept by the fire if people wouldn't have judged me. We walked up to the boys' dorms and there were two rooms. About ten boys in each room. One of the dorms was entirely made up of Ravenclaws so we both knew we were put into the second.
There it was, an admittance of something he wouldn't have said in any normal situation. This was anything but normal.
I had a striped red jumper and a plain green one laid on my bed. They both looked fine, but I just couldn't decide. Ron tapped my shoulder.
I have to sit by Draco in front of all my classes, so we can see the interpreter, therefore I knew instantly something was off.
But she couldn't understand what was going through my head the year we had gotten together. I was going through a tough time and she was right in away. She was more of a distraction or an experiment. I felt sick at the thought of using her like that.
The Dark Mark was a very taboo subject in the Wizarding World. Several people that had it were allowed to walk free. Draco being one, though he was still on probation. Snape was given a few different awards for his death, claiming it as a noble sacrifice. Most, however, were in Azkaban.
The lights were off which wasn't strange because it was night. I yelled his name a few times, still nothing. I wouldn't give up though. I went to his bedroom and opened it. The bed was empty, in fact, it looked unused. The covers had dust on them and there wasn't a single wrinkle in them.
One thing that was the same, Draco was still sound asleep in the next bed over. I never really noticed how little sleep he got, but I knew his schedule wasn't what was recommended.
Draco and I were walking down the hallway to the library. He noticed his shoe had untied and asked for some light.
He collapsed into a seated position and leaned against the shelves. I took out my wand and cast all of the books back to their places.
I jumped when I felt the tap on my shoulder. Hermione stood there, arms akimbo, waiting for me to say something.
I thought it was our compartment so I went to open the door. What I found was Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zambini, and none other than Draco Malfoy. Pansy and Blaise both snapped there heads towards me, to door probably creaked when I opened it. Malfoy stayed gazing out the window. He looked much calmer than I remembered, he also looked less broken, freer. I saw a hand wave in from of my face and when I looked over it was Pansy. She had her hands on her hips and it looked like she was trying to tell me something. Probably asking why I was here.
Then it happened. The day I'll never forget and I felt the slight shift in the tilt of Earth's axis. I opened a new chapter in my life. This chapter wouldn't be told in the tales, nor in the history books. Who would want to hear this side of the story? Most would find this aspect of my life boring or may say it paints me in a bad light. I might have become weaker or lost things that made me who I am, but I am more myself than I have ever been.
Maybe my "Emotional Epiphany" wasn't so bad. I could get used to this, and I had a strong feeling I was going to.
Tonight was, thankfully, not a night I was meeting with Draco. I was just so exhausted that I couldn't wait to crawl into a ball and sleep until Ron pushed me out of bed the next morning.
I pulled the curtains away from the bed. I did not expect to have a person fall at my feet, but you see something new every day. After Seamus rolled off the bed, I reached out a hand and helped him up.
At that, he made a move to get up and stand. When his right knee buckled he let out a sigh and put his head against the wall. Ron tried to hide his sniggering with the back of his hand.
like I said my sentences were a little choppy but it gets the point across. Pansy looked over at Blaise again and he nodded to the unspoken question.
Leaning in I pressed a small kiss to his lips. It wasn't like last time, there wasn't that built-up tension or want. It felt needy, raw, different. Like he was afraid to let go. No tears fell from his eyes though, like with every second the need to do so vanished.
We walked in comfortable silence for another half-hour or so. Then we saw a faint blue glow coming from ahead.
"I know." He met my eyes, they were such a piercing grey it was hard to look away. My eyes did, however, wander to a little lower. "I didn't say anything either, Harry."
After what felt like hours and seconds all at once he looked back at me. That was the Draco I became friends with, not the one from years ago.
"You have such a way with words," I reached across the space and wiped a stray tear from his eye as he let out a weak laugh.
"An honour... from the famous Harry Potter, I'm touched." He snickered, I elbowed him back just as hard. He took the bag of chocolate chip biscuits without complaint.
His hands found mine, pulling them away from their position. I peeked at him, "You really think you can just mess with me?"
My brows furrowed, "I mean, I hope so. I just feel like we have nothing to show for it. We have no books, no ideas, and no help."
"I never said anything like that!" I really felt backed into a corner here. Why couldn't we go back to who she cheated on me with?
It was perfectly ok if other people were, that didn't affect me. It did, however, affect me if I was the one being attracted to that.
I got that funny feeling in my throat again as he bent down and lifted the candle and brought it to a table. With a wave and one last glance, he swept out of the dark library.
On the map, I found Draco on the third-floor on his way to DADA, our first class of the day. What made me nervous was he wasn't alone. I broke off into a sprint with Ron close behind.
why he was here. Apparently it wasn't to get a job like everybody else here. I may not have an idea, but I knew I was going to do something. He thought he wasn't going to be able to get a job? He wasn't really a Death Eater, if he was he'd be in Azkaban right now.
"Hey, Ron! Care if Malfoy joins us for class?" I didn't turn around to see his expression. "No? Ok great," and then I hoisted Draco off the ground and walked towards the classroom.
"Oh," he saw her die. She died at Malfoy Mannor, why didn't I figure that out. He didn't want to take Muggle Studies because he had to witness the old professor die, not because he had a simple grudge against muggles.
I saw the fatherly twinkle in Dumbledore's eyes, slightly masked by the magical paint. The second face was one that had been the temporary headmaster the year I wasn't present. Snape seemed less cold now like he wasn't holding in a thousand secrets. I wish I had known him like that instead of the rude potions professor that failed my every assignment. If only he had seen my mother in me instead of my father.
"Yeah mate, she's gonna be a mess. I don't know what's been going on this year, but she seems really shifty whenever someone brings you up. Try the Great Hall by... she might still be there."
Well, that was true I guess. Breaking into the same quarter two days in a row was not my ideal way to get to know the new guy, but when have I ever been ideal.
She looked wary but nodded nonetheless. I couldn't blame her for being worried considering it was now ten times harder for me to spot the danger that seemed to be attracted to me. She and Ron left the Great Hall leaving only one other person.
I knew it was rare for people here to hate me, especially after fifth year and before fourth. I became more self-aware in my time alone, that didn't mean I had to like it, but thinking didn't change anything. If Malfoy could show the world that even I wasn't perfect, then he would have those Slytherins wrapped around his finger.
He looked over to Hermione, signaling it was too much for him to sign. I sat down across from her and read her movements. "
Part of me wanted to be involved in their conversation, the other part didn't want to talk to anyone ever again. After Neville had tried to include me and Hermione had to explain I felt even worse. Maybe he could take my place with them. It could have been him. I've never been more thankful it wasn't. Never in my life would I wish that fate on somebody else. He had already gone through enough and my problems never seemed that big compared to other people's.
Apparently, Blaise is extremely quiet, according to Ron which isn't saying much, and the only thing they had in common was quidditch which caused a very lengthy conversation. His main takeaway from the encounter was that his mom had had just as many husbands as he has siblings. Let's just say Ron didn't hate this conversation.
It wasn't very long, I was kinda thankful for that. One can only handle so much at a time. He still had that protective aura about him, like he was holding my life-force delicately in his hands. I melted into his touch.
He stood up and brushed off his pants. It was the first time I got a look at him, and I hate to say it, but damn he looked good.
I knew Draco could tell me first, that is if he did like me back which is a very small probability, but his bravery was hard to come by. I was supposed to be the outgoing one and even this was too much for me. Voldemort was a walk in the park compared to this. (Maybe not, but you get the point)
After they insisted on changing the original groups, they also didn't sit together at lunch, so I sat with Ron and Hermione instead.
They had already read the article by the time I found them before breakfast. The plan was that Draco had been sick with a mild case of dragon pox for the past day, and I was with them last night, so there would have been no way for the story to be true.
Draco caught my eye and I noticed my pace speed up just a little bit. I halted in front of the three of them, my friends stopped just behind that. We stood there just for a minute, I suddenly had nothing to say.
A little girl, no older than seven, walked up to me and tapped my calf. I felt bad, little kids are really hard to lip-read and don't know sign language most of the time. I found a piece of paper nearby.
Alright, so I was a little (a lot) more awkward now than I was a few weeks ago, but can you blame me.
This surprised me. What on Earth could he have to ask me about? Almost all of my life was printed and published for the world.
When I got back to the common room I was somewhat surprised to see Ron and Hermione sprawled out across the floor, books surrounding them.
"It's about Voldemort," she grimaced, "I need to go into the forest. Before you can stop me, this isn't up for decision, I just felt like you deserved to know... in case... you know," I trailed off.
His eye roll didn't go unnoticed, but at this point, I couldn't care less. I just wanted to see Hagrid again.
I noticed a few of the beds already had the curtains closed. It didn't slip my mind that Draco's was one of them. I set the potion down on the table between our beds, hoping that by morning it would be gone. I hoped he got the hint.
After a while I noticed Draco getting heavier, his eyelids drooping. I pulled back slightly, "Do you want to go back?"
I woke up like any other morning. Ron rolled me onto the floor, I bruised my hip, and Draco was just a teeny-tiny bit kinder to me.
I carefully removed the hood and stood in shock. It was Mr. A, and he appeared to be sleeping. That must be why his room seemed barely used, but it didn't explain why he slept out here in the first place.
I wasn't sure what I wanted to see on the other side, but this was much more beautiful than I could have imagined. In the center of this clearing there lay and small blue flower. Obviously magical, yet still so enchanting, like I would never need anything else again.
One thing I love about sign language is that all you need is eye contact and a nice view of their hands. Meaning, people couldn't listen in and we didn't have to be close.
"Do you think we'll ever find a cure?" His hands snapped me out of my daze. Honestly, sometimes when I'm with him I forget I'm deaf. It's like speaking with someone from a totally different country, you forget not everyone communicates the same.
I finally made it to the teacher hallway and wondered if it would be weird to just knock on his private quarters. In the end, I just went for it and knocked. After a few knocks you might have expected me to leave, but when have I been one to do that? So after muttered a quick
there it was again, the pink tint in his cheeks. He looked away and I thought it was better to drop this concept before it got too personal. He had shared enough I guess.
Draco and I agreed to give each other our Christmas presents on New Year's Eve. It was his turn to come up with a date idea, so I was intrigued when I received his note the previous day.
His fingers nimbly reached around my neck and tied the two pieces of leather together. The snitch hung down by my collarbone and glinted in the moonlight.
I took my wand and snuck over to him. After poking him in the sides three times, he bolted upright and gave me the strongest death glare I had seen in years. I noticed Ron had left the room after shaking me awake. He probably was forced to wake one of us up and couldn't wait for food any longer.
I looked over to my right after getting up off the ground, to see green curtains closed around a bed. I ripped them open and tried shaking Draco awake. He sat up and gave me one of those half-hearted glares. I shrugged my shoulder in return and went into the bathroom to get ready.
We had settled into the aisle farthest back of the Library. A small can was flickering in between us casting a soft hue on Draco's face. It was times like these that I wish I had full use of my senses. I miss the loud sounds of silence.
That made him uncomfortable, I could tell. I didn't really care though, how could we overcome this stupid pettiness if we called each other by our last names?
I found that after a while it wasn't so bad. I was starting to get the hang of it and certain words were becoming very distinguishable. I would obviously need to test it out on more people than just Draco, but he was an option I definitely didn't mind.
Draco and I sat across from each other at our usual spot in the library. It was well past midnight now, it had taken quite a while to get there and come back.
I looked over and saw Draco with his back to the line, he had been packaging the same box for just a little too long. I tapped him on the shoulder, and as he turned around I noticed he had his wand in his hand. It was shoved up his sleeve in less than a second.
I was now completely off the original topic. He closed up again and looked at the floor. I felt like I had struck a chord somewhere and was being too personal. I half-wondered if he had told
I nodded my head and we walked over to the book catalog. The library book catalog wasn't on a computer, we didn't have those and I've never had to use one in the first place so I wouldn't be much help. It was multiple tables set to spin with a turn of a handle. The tables each had huge books on them, probably magicked to hold more than it shows. We each wrote down a list of all the books that could possibly help us. I went to find them and Hermione went in another direction.
Draco stayed close to my side, I could tell he was terrified. It was way too dim to talk, so I had lots of time to think.
Draco had been targeted greatly for being the only Death Eater to walk out on probation. Most didn't take too kindly to this, but luckily Hogwarts has been able to hold some of the more unsavoury opinions from being unleashed. He had already been attacked at least once, who would be there to help him once school was out? With a disability like ours, it only enlarges the target on our backs.
I feel like I might just be able to pursue him on this one. Smilingly softly, I lean back and take a sip of my butterbeer.
There was one thing I knew. Mr. A was fast. He was probably middle-aged and he didn't seem like the runner type. I was running at full speed, going corridor by a corridor and didn't even see a hint of him being there. Hogwarts is a huge castle, so it's not like he could have left.
I cut him off with a shimmering stag kneeling by his feet. He yelped, but then calmly composed himself as though nothing happened.
I closed my arms around his waist and stroked his back while he calmed down. Quite honestly, I don't care what was in his dream so long as he's safe. I've never been more glad someone came to me for help.
"Fine," I sat on the bed next to her. Placing my elbows on my knees I let out an exasperated sigh. "I don't know how to say this because I'm not even sure what I need to tell you."
He took out his wand and conjured up some parchment and quill. I offered to write, but he claimed my "chicken scratch" would be impossible for McGonagall to read and we would be stuck with Hagrid for every class cleaning up after the Thestrals. He wrote down potions first and I almost screamed at him, of course, he wouldn't have heard it. "
I reached out and touched his arm. He flinched, flicking his head up to meet my eyes. They got wide and I thought I could see his breathing visibly slow.
He smirked and then liked some frosting off his finger. He was going to be the death of me. I think Voldemort would be rather jealous of that.
Shaking his head he got out a small pot and set the milk to warm. I can't help but think that this is the most relaxed he's been all week.
We had agreed to tell McGonagall to change Muggle Studies to History of Magic. She didn't have any problems with it, nor did she ask why.
"Yeah, hang on." I walked over to him and tossed it next to him. He opened it to write and I turned around to get into pajamas.
Well, that was a relief. I'm not as upset as I thought I would be that he read that. It's just one less person who has to find out and he should know at some point.
When we started dating I knew that it would be rough. Our past, our experiences, our lives were never meant to intertwine this way. How am I supposed to protect someone for the rest of my life, when I can hardly protect myself?
"Well... I don't really need any girl advice." I could see the gears turning in her head, her mouth forming a small "O".
I would like to clarify: My previous statements still stand, we did not have sex in the dorm room. Throughout this story, I'm afraid you will not read those scenes. Draco and I would prefer our private lives to stay just that, private. PSA over.
The box I was handing them felt so small, even though I was meant to be helping I felt terrible. With trembling hands, I passed the box to them. The mother gave a curt nod and silent thanks, then went back to her children.
That made sense. I have no clue what could cause that kind of emotional epiphany, but I'm not sure if I want to find out.
Many will paint me as a savior, somebody who put an end to the worst time in any of our lives. Those who were born in times of war would thank me for giving them a new look at life. The people older than me would shake my hand and praise me for ending the decades of war, bringing back what they had once known. Though one person would disagree with those remarks. I am that person.
she responded while pointed to Malfoy. Did Pansy Parkinson, the Queen of Slytherin, just offer me help on behalf of my rival of 8 years to learn sign language? As if she could read my mind she responds with, "
The room stilled slightly when I entered, I could almost hear the noise level drop. They didn't seem that interested though.
I pointed to my ears and said "I can't hear what you said. I lost my hearing during the war," Pansy and Blaise exchanged a look. I couldn't read lips very well so I knew this conversation would be pointless. I was about to turn around and leave because the atmosphere became very tense. I couldn't help but wonder why Draco hadn't turned around yet. I would have thought he would love to torment me about this even if I wouldn't have been able to hear it. Pansy seemed to notice I was staring again and took a deep breath before gaining my attention and raising her hands.
After we were safely on flat ground, Draco took in his surroundings. We had landed by a small building with a line of people flooding out the door. The area was worn, and the people looked far too downcast for Christmas Eve. I lead him to a back entrance.
"Yeah, no problem." He wasn't allowed to use his wand in the hallway no matter what. We talked about it in one of our meetings.
When we separated, he leaned back on his hand and reached towards me with a similar package. His was much more elegantly wrapped than mine, and I almost felt bad about ripping it apart. Almost.
The sky itself was just starting to dim, and Moonbugs had just started to glow blue around us. He held it up to the sky, it blended in perfectly. He looked over to me, with a grin spreading across his face.
Zacharias Smith and Terry Boot aren't a typical pair of friends, but I guess lots of people are trying to make new friendships after the war.
He looked back over at the time and his eyes got wide before grabbing my hand and running through it so it dissipated. Any feeling of fatigue I had left was gone at the motion.
After we finished eating the schedules were handed out. Everyone around me had gotten one so I was worried when I hadn't. It was then, I looked over to Hermione to ask her what was wrong.
I really wasn't that late, but to him, it seemed to be like I had just compromised the most dangerous mission of his life. And I
he waved me over.  We were about a foot apart now, he leaned in a little, more like half a foot now. Slowly, he said, "Can you read them?"  I nodded.
Out of his wand erupted a miniature Hungarian Horntail. The silver whisp of a creature encircled us, I felt breathless. Draco was thrown back with momentum and landed flat on his arse. His eyes reflected the glow, he truly was beautiful.
I replied. I looked over to the small basket next to us and peeked inside. He couldn't cook much, but I could help but melt at his efforts. Two bacon sandwiches, pumpkin juice, and finger cakes; a perfect dinner.
Draco seemed to mutter something that was obviously a curse. After a quick cleaning charm and hastily put on robes, he moved to me.
The plant was definitely special. I didn't want to go near it as it may have been several different poisons. Draco, it seemed, did not share this same sentiment.
I pecked his cheek quickly before detaching my hand. Walking away I realized that this was still going to be a rough meal, even without Draco insight.
He loosed up and I was able to hold it, pulling his arm towards me. Carefully, I rolled up the cuff and saw the black ink fade into view. He looked away from it, so I used my other hand to move his chin towards me.
When I made it to our bedroom, it was well past dinner time. I hadn't realized I spend the entire day in the infirmary. My hand stilled on the doorknob, I almost thought it would be best to sleep on the couch. I ultimately decided to suck it up and walked in.
He had rolled his sleeves up to the elbows, seemingly he was getting warm. I guess he was used to the emptiness of Malfoy Manor where nobody would judge him for it. My breath hitched as I gazed at the black skull mark on his left arm.
Standing up again, I sent him a confused look. He shrugged, grabbed the first novel in sight, walked past me, and sat at a table.
I asked, nodding to the store, Harrods, in front of us. I had never been allowed to go into Harrods myself, the Dursleys thought it too good for me and the only other time I had been to London was with Hagrid and he certainly couldn't have taken me.
I walked over to a little island that was filled with different sweets and pastries, all packaged nicely. I knew coming here that Draco wouldn't be able to buy anything, so I made sure to bring some of my leftover money stash from when I lived with the Dursleys. It wasn't much, only about 15 pounds, or so.
Draco signed, a little too slowly. He struggled out of the bed, but his leg caught the covers and he fell to the ground. In end, he pulled everything off the bed. And by everything, I mean everything.
I picked up a lot of candy, and some biscuits too. I had only ever gotten candy if I stole some from Dudley's Halloween pile, so some of this was foreign to me too.
I dabbed some of the buttercream onto my finger as well and then proceeded to smear it on his nose. After going slightly cross-eyed, he glared down at me.
she snapped her head at Seamus, who was sitting next to her. After a small verbal lashing, by the looks of it, she turned back.
Draco leaned in closer, I could feel his breath on my face. "You sure?" Oh. My. Merlin. This was really happening, did my heart always beat this fast?
Taking his hand, I lead him out into the area outside of Hogsmede. After taking a portkey out of my pocket, Draco pulls back.
So it was top-tier or anything, but it's always the thought that counts. After we finished eating, in silence, I decided to speak up. Sign-up? Anyways.
See, Ron has this temper problem, I think it's a Gryffindor thing. He's pretty self-conscious of his friends leaving him so I think he's still a bit rattled after what Ginny told him. I'll add that to one of the reasons why I will not be heading to the Burrow any time soon.
“See? Even the Slytherins agree Sixth Year was an issue.” Ron’s voice was loud with suspected victory.
Pushing open the bathroom door, Draco found himself facing a very upset Harry rambling at a rather startled Neville and clinging onto his t-shirt for dear life.
“I agree, pyjamas and then we’ll go from there.” He forced himself to walk to his dresser and lift out a black t-shirt and a pair of grey bottoms. “I’ll change in the bathroom if that’s ok?” Then, without waiting for an answer, he went into the bathroom, closing the door securely behind him.
“I just—I was sick of everything I loved being taken away from me. My parents, my home, even my reputation, and then I found Atlantis, and I just loved him so much. He was mine, and then we came here, and suddenly I felt like I was losing him. I just couldn’t lose anything else. I don’t expect you to understand.”
“Well, the room obviously feels it’s doing something one of us wants,” explained Granger, rubbing her tired eyes.
Draco was feeling especially optimistic. He had help, notes, and a good idea of where to start. He was certain that he was not only going to get full marks for his project, but that he would live to see his graduation.
"Perfect," Harry answered with a strained smile. "I'm very happy that we're finally going to have all the sex."
As he reached the last lines of the song, he looked down at the ducklings and almost fainted in relief. They were asleep, all eight of them snuggled into the fur-lined hat he had taken off his own head once the warming charms of the enclosure had settled in. Draco found himself smiling at the thought that he would rather the ducklings sleep than risk waking them to retrieve his hat that had cost more than what most people spent on dress robes!
"Oh, fuck," Harry pulled out his wand, and Neville flinched, sure he was about to be Obliviated by one of his best friends. But Harry just spun his wand around and cast a Privacy Charm.
Sure enough, Harry was back within minutes, sighing about their mates being a bunch of idiots, but that all of them were still more or less in one piece. The fluttering inside Draco’s chest had turned furious, like a caged bird desperate to escape. He stared at Harry, unable to look anywhere else except into those confused emerald pools. Harry looked so unsure as if he were scared of saying or doing the wrong thing. Without realising he’d made the decision to move, Draco suddenly had his arms around Harry and was kissing him with a desperation he had never felt before. Harry responded immediately, kissing Draco back with enthusiasm.
“What benefit would come from finding my core twin? I don’t see how that would help my situation at all.” The whole plan seemed to lack any common sense and Draco wasn’t about to embark on a harebrained scheme, even under extenuating circumstances!
Before Harry could process the situation, Draco whipped his wand out of his sleeve and stunned him, taking care to cast a Cushioning Charm as he fell so he wouldn’t get hurt. Once he was sure Harry was safe for the moment, he let the rage he’d been holding back take root. He pushed his feet into his shoes without bothering with socks and threw a travelling cloak over his joggers and t-shirt, taking off at a run towards the Great Hall, determined to find Pansy before she could do anything else to make it worse.
“Yes, my son Draco is pregnant.” She confirmed slowly, like she was explaining an obvious concept to a young child.
"Yes, please, that would be lovely." Hermione smiled in a very un-Hermione-like fashion. "Something soft, but with a little bit of a rhythm."
And that did it. Neville might never have had the reputation as being the most clever student in school, or even the most strategic chess player, but Neville had a knack for listening to people. It often allowed him to make connections because he paid attention to details.
Feeling slightly giddy at the silence, Draco flopped onto his back, the dry ground slightly knocking the wind out of him. Holy fucking Hippogriffs. Ducklings were hard work and he’d only had them for less than two hours! He reached out for the book and quickly checked how long they would sleep for and only just managed to stifle a groan at the realisation that he would have to repeat the entire fiasco in about two hours. He hadn't felt this exhausted and totally terrified since Voldemort had become his housemate for a year. Merlin, was he in trouble.
He tiredly dragged himself out of Severus’ rooms and into the corridor, unaware that the Potions Master was watching him leave, his eyes heavy with sadness.
"Funny, Blaise. Really hysterical. Never mind that I've been harassed most of my day, as long as you're provided amusement."
Eventually, Draco managed to shake off the crowds and secure himself a very stiff drink. He’d lost track of his friends ages ago as they mingled in favour of seeking refuge in a corner beside the makeshift bar. Really, was there a better place for him to be? There was no one to force conversation upon him, and he had as much Firewhisky as he could stomach.
Draco pulled away from Harry and slid off his knee onto the bed. He looked exhausted, and Harry’s heart twinged for him.
“I doubt we have to go through the book right now,” he began gently. “Perhaps we can cover some basics just now, and then you boys can take the book upstairs to read? Then, if you have any questions, you can ask away.”
Draco could see the corner of the portrait’s mouth quirk at the old endearment Draco had called him in life. He swung his bag over his shoulder and strode out of the room. He had a few minutes to get to Transfiguration, and McGonagall wasn’t one to accept tardiness at the best of times.
“Now, see here. I appreciate that you’re all meaning well, but can everyone just bugger off? Some of us have stuff to do.”
The crowd of survivors after the infamous battle had seemed so small at the time. He remembered how they’d huddled together in groups of three and four, sparsely dotted around the Great Hall. Yet somehow, the number seemed to have swelled. Those survivors had brought their spouses and plus-ones, and it seemed to Draco that the entire hall was undulating with the sheer volume of bodies pressed within its walls.
And like a fool, he had listened. At home, there were no jeers or taunts. No glares or hexes. Worse than that, though, was the complete feeling of isolation.
“Yes, of course. I’ll keep whatever it  is to myself.” Harry murmured, feeling he might burst from the anticipation.
“I just want this to go well. I figured since they made it to this age and it never came up that we'd gotten away with it. I’ve never had to do this before, you know.”
on your owl?! Baz simply has better taste in men, let’s face it. I bought some owl treats for him, but he still let me cuddle him before I could even offer him one. I wish I could buy my own owl, but I can’t really afford one at the moment. Maybe at the end of my apprenticeship, if I manage to set up my own potions lab. I might settle for befriending Baz in the meantime, then I’ll convince him to leave you and join me instead, and force you to buy a new owl. Mwahaha!
body, and I’ll do whatever I want. If I want a hangover potion, then I’ll fucking have one. If I want to get pissed and shag a different guy every night of the week, then that’s my prerogative. Now, let. Me. Go. Or I swear, I’ll strangle you with my bare hands.”
“Oh, do shut up and occupy your mouth more usefully,” demanded Draco, seeming uncaring that his cock was hanging outside of his leather trousers for all to see.
Harry felt tired, too tired to do this any more. After a while, just what was the point in fighting all the time? If it wasn’t over blood status and megalomaniacal mass murderers, then it was over their pets. Harry suddenly wanted to hide in his room and never come back out.
“It’s not what you think. We were just— it was the heat!” Harry jumped to his feet as he babbled, snatching his clothes from the floor in panic. He was so painfully aware of everyone staring at them, at the sheer amount of bare skin on display between himself and Draco, that he couldn’t think straight. Panic was building inside him, like a swarm of hornets had taken up residence inside his brain.
It irked him no end to see Potter looking particularly hot, and not in terms of degrees. Life as an Auror had obviously agreed with him, filling out his previously skinny frame with muscle. The biceps on the man were unreal, and as he let his eyes follow the path of the beads of sweat rolling down the tanned skin, he thought he caught a glimpse of ink on Potter’s forearm. Draco found himself leaning forwards as he took in the enticing sight.
You need to get a grip, Draco. If you bothered to subscribe to the papers or poke your head out of your hidey-hole, you would know that the public is very much on your side, with the odd exception of one or two people. It turns out you weren’t the only person Orion screwed over, and they’ve all been coming forward in droves to testify against him. You’re really 100% in the clear.
“Pansy, of course. I fucking told her to stay out of it. What did she give you? Amortentia? Did she cast a Confundus at you?”
“It’s alright for you guys. Everyone you know that died was honoured. Remembered. They all got funerals and plaques and Orders of bloody Merlin. What did Vince get? Nothing. Not a bloody mention. There wasn’t even a body for us to bury so we could say goodbye.”
As Malfoy finally reached him, Harry noticed that his so-called friends had drifted off, leaving him to his fate.
Pansy pressed a kiss against Draco’s cheek and threw a deadly glare at Harry as she set off in the direction of the others.
Draco felt his eyes widen at Potter’s challenge, hyper-aware that the man was staring at him with a strange glint in his emerald eyes.
“If we get stuck?” repeated Pansy, looking at Luna as though she couldn’t believe this girl really existed. “How much more stuck could we get?”
At Draco's soundless gasping and gaping, Harry grinned and continued to explain. "We both need a holiday. It's been two years since we had a proper break. And so," he declared, pulling some printed pages out of his pocket, "I booked us a last-minute holiday to Malta — diving at Qawra Reef, to be exact!"
Harry sat for a long moment, watching Narcissa take deep breaths through her nose in an apparent attempt to calm herself.
“Mr Malfoy, if you do not calm yourself, I will have no option but to administer Dreamless Sleep, and then you will miss the opportunity to voice any concerns you may have once Mr Potter arrives.” The matron clicked her tongue against her teeth as she tucked the sheets back in around his body, ignoring the stuttering groans of indignation that fought to leave him.
“Because, you complete moron, I didn't want you to be around me just because I was having your baby. I’ve been waiting for you to come to your senses and kick me out, but instead, every day, you do these little things for me that make it harder to keep away from you. Subscribing to my favourite magazines, even though I know you never read them. You buy my favourite caramels and leave them for me in my room. The foot rubs you give me when my ankles get sore and swollen from lugging around your spawn all day.”
Draco creaked open his eyes wearily and made a grab for the bedside clock. He suppressed a yawn and held the clock in front of his face, trying his best to make out the time through bleary eyes. As soon as he was able to focus, he gasped, threw the clock onto the bottom on the bed, and leapt from the bed in a mad dash, cursing all the while. He had no time for his usual routine — not even time for coffee! He forced his legs into the first pair of trousers he came across and padded into the living room as he fought his way into a t-shirt and jumper.
He thought she would shout at him or order him as only a mother could. He never considered she would simply shrink in front of him. His mother, who had always stood so tall no matter what, seemed to crumble into herself, her eyes closing in what could only be defeat.
Draco looks sharply at Harry, searching his face for any hints of this being some kind of sick joke. “As a date?” The very words make Draco’s heart thud in his chest so aggressively he wouldn’t be surprised if he had a heart attack.
My Potion Master apprenticeship is going well, but Orion is a bit too forward sometimes. He has been hinting at the fact that I look fit and I’m single and that no one else would be interested in a Death Eater. His comments are making me slightly uncomfortable, but I’ll survive. Pansy says he just wants to shag me. I supposed I should be grateful that he offered me a job and a flat just above the lab, in spite of my not-so-spotless background. Beggars can't be choosers, as Orion likes to remind me.
“The others were too rigid, though.” Draco thought back to when they had tried ground marble. The vibrations from the resultant explosion had caused several of Severus’ shelves to shatter. He peeled off his gloves and goggles and cast quick, but adequate, Cleaning Charms to rectify the mess he’d made. Once the room was put to rights, he began to scoop his notes and books into his bag, his fingers struggling to fix the lid back onto his ink pot, barely managing to stifle a yawn. “I’ll do some more reading after finishing my homework. There needs to be something…maybe sandstone?”
“Yes Draco, as my date.” Harry’s fingers are twisting in his jumper, showing just how nervous he is, and it’s what gives Draco the courage to answer.
“Truer words were never spoken. Draco Malfoy, would you like to be my date to the reunion? You know, if we ever get out of here and back to the party?”
Speaking of love, it turns out Cho is hot for Ernie MacMillan! Do you remember him from Hogwarts? Hufflepuff and quite annoying. He’s working at the Ministry, and Ron and I walked in on them shagging in one of the equipment cupboards when we were getting suited up for recon training. Everyone knows Ron can’t keep a secret to save his life, so everyone knew by the end of the day. He was over the moon to have gossip, but I feel traumatised. Do you have any idea how many shots of firewhisky it took to get the image of Ernie’s pasty arse out of my mind? I feel like it’s burned into my bloody retinas.
“Rennervate!” Draco sat on his heels on top of the bedspread and watched as Harry began to stir. Luckily, Severus had one Amortentia antidote left, at least something had gone right for once. Slowly, Harry opened his eyes and smiled blearily up at Draco.
He heaved a heavy sigh and walked over to the large tank taking up over half of the wall next to his bed. He smiled at his new pet, a magical flying seahorse measuring just under a foot long, happily bobbing about riding the small currents from the water filter.
The knowledge that Potter had tattoos had Draco’s heart racing, and at that moment he knew he’d give all his gold in Gringott’s to see them. He flicked his eyes at Harry’s forearm, remembering seeing a flash of something there earlier on. Unfortunately, Harry had his hands in his pockets, his forearm hidden from view. Unwilling to trust his voice, he nodded at Potter and quirked an eyebrow in response.
“Now, Harry. I need it now!” demanded Draco, and Harry quickly pulled his fingers from his body with an audible squelch and lined up the head of his cock with Draco’s loosened hole.
Harry forced himself to stay calm, letting Draco rant as he pleased. He watched as Draco balled his hands into fists and raved aggressively about life and fairness and how he needed a bloody drink now. Harry stood and waited patiently, keeping quiet and still, until finally, nearly fifteen minutes later, Harry saw the fight seep out of Draco, causing his shoulders to sag. The look in his eyes was lost and sad, and Harry suddenly felt like he couldn’t bear to look into them.
After the longest ten seconds of her life in which Harry just stared at her, he finally began to lean in until their lips were finally touching and, Oh-Holy-Mother-Of-Merlin, Harry was kissing her! Okay, it was closed-mouthed — talk about small mercies — but his lips were on hers, all warm and thin not just a friendly peck, and it was wrong, wrong, wrong!
He remembered what she had said when he had first shown her the letter. He had expected her to look regretful but ultimately tell him to let it go. Instead, he’d sat at the breakfast table shocked as she ranted and raved, slamming cups and plates about as she got herself more and more worked up.
“Where did you get the flowers from?” Blaise asked suddenly. “If the room has flowers, it might also have some fruit or something we can eat.”
Once again, the image of Malfoy swam into his head, although he was mercifully fully clothed this time. The green light of the Slytherin common room giving the scene an otherworldly tinge as Malfoy sat in one of the larger armchairs, cuddling and stroking the birds in front of the fire. His intelligent eyes crinkling in affection as he cooed sweet nothings to the creatures. The soft, yellow feathers fluffing against the pale skin of his cheek as he snuggled them close, perhaps even pressing pink-tinged lips against their soft down— for the sake of the fucking founders! What the fuck kind of Firewhisky was this? Insanity-generating or something? There was no way Malfoy was canoodling with ducklings to improve his public image. The idea was the most ridiculous he’d ever heard, and he’d been party to some pretty shoddy schemes back in the day in the Gryffindor tower.
“Thought you could use something to keep your energy up,” explained Harry, leaning in for a light kiss which turned deeper in the blink of an eye.
He began counting under his breath as she bustled around, emptying the jug and filling it with her wand. “Thank you, Mother. You should sit down though; you look tired.”
Draco was lying on his side on top of the bed. He was still in the same clothes he’d arrived in and had clearly not washed in any way. His cheeks and eyes were blotched and red from crying. The rawness of the red only served to make the rest of his skin look much more pale than usual, verging on drawn and peaky. His whole body was quivering, letting Harry know he was awake even though his eyes were closed. His arms, though, were what shocked Harry the most.
“You can’t; I’ve warded it in case you get any bright ideas like making a sheet ladder.” He’d meant it to lighten the mood, but if he was honest, it wasn't far from what Draco would likely do if given a chance.
A pointed cough reminded him he wasn’t on his own and he turned to face the group, who looked less smug than before. In fact, their expressions ranged from pissed to pitying. However, it was when he saw Ron’s wince that he knew just how badly he’d messed up.
“I’m sorry, I should have knocked. It’s not my room anymore…but I need to talk to you. I miss you. I know I shouldn’t, but I do. I liked living with you, loved having you around. Miss your drama and tantrums. I miss your complaining and the scathing comments you make about my clothes and hair. I even miss reading stupid Potions articles to you.”
Harry pushed himself off the wall and watched with narrowed eyes as Malfoy grabbed a bottle of something from the bar and quickly left the hall, keeping to the edge of the crowds as he went.
He’d refused point-blank, voicing his many reservations and protesting any argument thrown his way, but he knew it was only a matter of time before he gave in. Pansy was a force to be reckoned with, and she always got her way. Especially with Blaise in her corner, they were a whirlwind of emotional blackmail and underhanded threats.
The new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor was currently droning on about the importance of always keeping your eyes on your opponent. While everyone else seemed to be hanging on her every word and taking notes, Harry was struggling not to emit the loudest, most obnoxious yawn ever seen in a classroom.
In lessons, he finds himself in Potter’s company a lot. If a partner is needed, Potter appears next to him as if it’s the most normal thing in the world. For weeks, Draco’s been having to work alone or partner with the professors, and now, suddenly, Boy Wonder is everywhere he looks. It’s not just in classes, either. When he’s studying in the library, Potter often finds him, sitting next to him in silence as they both work through their assignments.
The bell signalling the end of the lesson resounded throughout the room, but still, no one moved. Everyone was well aware that in Potions, the bell didn’t dismiss you, Severus did. Everyone sat, eyes transfixed upon the large portrait of Severus Snape behind the teacher’s desk at the front of the class.
think you're handsome," she cooed, leaning dangerously close to Harry, causing him to fumble his way out of his chair to his feet.
the Herbology professor, you know,” Neville reminded them with a friendly shrug before his voice switched into lecture mode. “They’re both quite similar in meanings, actually. The Narcissus represents rebirth, renewal, and future happiness. The Lilies are for love, new beginnings, and commitment. When you look at it like that, it really does seem like the room wants you and Draco to hook up or something.”
Draco looked at Harry, and Neville could feel it now, the tension between them. How had he not noticed? It was almost tangible.
By the time he got back to the common room it was after nine and most of the eighth years had headed on up to their dorms. Ron and Hermione were likely trying to snag some alone time, or at least, he hoped for Ron’s sake they were. Surely, Hermione wasn’t sadistic enough to have the poor man still working away in the library. Even Hitler took a break now and then. Apparently.
“Please, let me take care of you?” Harry could hear his tone was veering dangerously close to begging, but he found it hard to care. He didn’t know precisely why he needed to do this, just that it was what he was meant to do. He was built to look after Draco.
"Fine," sighed Hermione, feeling like this was way more trouble than she initially thought. "What can I do to kick it up a notch?"
After a few moments, Draco pushed himself upright and washed his hands and face, the cold water partially shocking him out of his self-pity. There was no point in hiding any more, the situation was what it was and Harry wasn’t just going to disappear. He dug deep and hauled his old mask of indifference onto his face, braced his shoulders, and forced himself to walk into the bedroom.
Without further ado, and to Seamus’ great delight, the bottles of Firewhisky were opened and passed around the circle.
Draco rolled his eyes and took his result, ignoring the smug snort from Potter at the instructor’s pointed comment. Whatever. He passed, and that was the main thing.
"It's only down the hallway. I think we can manage." He took her arm in his and marched towards the door. "Besides, we're taking a long lunch."
“Yeah, I know, the great Potter can’t possibly stand by and let rule-breaking reign supreme. Sing a new tune, will you?”
“I can’t keep you inside my head anymore,” Harry continued, ignoring Draco’s pathetic attempt at taunting. “You can’t tell me you don’t feel the same way.”
“It’s never worked for anything more than a Lumos before,” moaned Harry, as they began to leak pre-cum over each other, making the slide of their cocks that much better.
“What are you on about? Of course, she didn’t! She just told me to stop moping cause I was putting her off her Shepherd’s pie and then threw her drink at me.”
“Don’t tell me when to worry, Potter.” He glared at Harry so fiercely, he was suddenly very thankful that looks couldn’t kill. “Hand it over. Now.”
Draco whipped his head around at the mention of his name and was presented with the nauseating sight of the girl Weasley hanging all over Potter. The way she said his name, as if he was less than shite on her shoe, made his blood thunder in his ears.
A few minutes later, Neville had sorted his precious plant and settled himself on the couch with a steaming cup of coffee and the latest issue of Herbology Weekly. He turned to the advice column and chortled to himself at the problem some old woman was having with her rare Amourous Tentacula — apparently it kept smacking her visitors on the bottom at the most inopportune moments! He eagerly read on to the expert's response, curious as to what they could possibly advise her to do when he became aware of...noises...coming from Harry's bedroom.
"You'd think being a librarian would be relaxing," mused Harry, unaware that his words were causing Draco to glare at him heatedly. "What with all the silence and reading and whatnot."
? Wondered Harry. Draco had never bothered to come into his study before. The footsteps came closer, slow and light, until, finally, Draco was standing in front of Harry, the light of the fire making his fine blonde hair look like a halo.
“Definitely! Why else would he be skulking around books on magical creatures and yelling at the elderly?”
Draco strained to get closer to Harry, searching for more friction. Harry sucked and bit at his collarbone, and Draco found himself gasping for more. He dug his fingernails into Harry’s back and dragged them up and down, scoring the flesh, causing Harry to growl hungrily into his mouth. Draco wanted to get at him. He wanted to hurt him and mark him and — Merlin, help him — he wanted Harry to do the same to him. He wanted their consummation to scorch him from the inside out, cauterising the wounds that still seeped from the war, and his father, and all that life had thrown at him.
“Why bother,” chuckled Draco lightly, “you could always finish the job that what's-his-face started.”
"Fuck," Neville finally said. "I told them this would all blow up." He started pacing, his heels clicking on the bathroom tiles. "Pansy found out first when she opened a dirty letter Harry sent last week, and then Blaise and Hermione found out when they walked in on you two shagging at work yesterday."
"Oh, yes. Now I find myself thinking of you whenever I so much as touch my wand." Draco was never going to let him live this down. How the hell had he gotten into this?
“The room?” Weasley asked doubtfully. “It can’t do that, can it? It’s the Room of Requirement. It’s meant to give you what you want, not hold you captive.”
“Well, you have to admit having a stuffed duck doesn’t do much for the Death Eater image!” Seamus looked like the Kneazle that had got the cream as everyone laughed and agreed with his statement and Draco wanted nothing more than to hex the stupid big smirk off of his smug face.
“Are you feeling thirsty, Mother?” Determined to maintain some semblance of hold on his rapidly thinning patience.
As they walked towards the Great Hall, Harry could feel the thrum of anticipation coursing through his body. Yes, he was going to dance with Draco. He was going to dance with him, and kiss him, and hold him so close that no one would dare say a thing.
Mother is still trying to convince me to marry Astoria, in spite of me reminding her every other week that I’m gay. At least if I die a bachelor, I will still have the beautiful memory of that passionate kiss you and I shared the first night after we got bonded.
“Fuck off, Draco,” mumbled Blaise, but the smile on his face told Draco everything he needed to know.
He waited, searching Harry’s face for any signs of disgust, but Harry merely watched him, his lips quirked in a slight smile. He kept his eyes on Harry’s as he let the shirt drop from his arms to the floor. The air caught in his chest as he watched Harry’s pupils dilate.
He saw Narcissa roll her eyes ever so slightly and couldn’t help but feel indignant. It was a valid question as far as he was concerned. If guys could go around getting knocked up, then there would be loads of them waddling about Diagon Alley moaning about the lack of weird ice cream flavours.
“Wait, where are you going?” Called Narcissa, her voice suddenly shrill and strained. “You’ve not eaten all day.”
"This is a nice wine; where'd you get it?" As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he cursed himself. He was meant to be flirting, not planning next week's grocery list.
“Fine!” Harry practically yelled as he stepped out into the corridor and closed the door behind him. “Calm down for the love of Merlin. Two pets get along and suddenly it’s the end of the bloody world. Which one is it?”
“Not another word, Mother! I don’t want him involved. I swear, if you tell him, I’ll never forgive you.”
The eighth years had been housed in a previously unused section of the castle near the Owlery. McGonagall had allocated two students per room, and Draco had found himself rooming with Neville Longbottom of all people! There were sixteen returning students in total, all mulling around the common room and sitting chatting on each other’s beds. But Draco was bloody lonely. No one spoke to him — unless they had to, or wanted to throw a hex at him. No Slytherin’s had returned other than himself, all opting to earn their N.E.W.T.s at home instead. Everyone else looked at him like the Death Eater Wannabe Scum he was and he honestly couldn’t blame them.
“You have?” he breaths, unable to make his voice work properly. He’s kissed Harry Potter! Harry Potter is in the enclosure with him, surrounded by ducklings!
“Truth, Potter?” spat Draco. “You wouldn’t know the truth if it slapped you upside your stupid scarred head.”
“He was a fucking kid. We all were! We did what we had to do to make sure our parents weren’t murdered. Maybe they weren’t good people, but they loved us, and we loved them. Maybe they didn’t do anything worthy of a medal, but they meant something to us.”
“Reason be damned. It’s all well and good being reasonable, but passion is what drives us. And no one else but us has to accept it anyway.”
"Not that I'm complaining, but you've been hanging around here a lot lately." Pansy looked at Neville carefully, concern clear in her eyes. "Have you fallen out with Harry or something?"
I thought I was being sensible. I thought you would never be interested in me that way; that if you found out about my feelings, I would just lose you forever. Having you as a friend is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I couldn’t face giving up what we had.
It took every bit of emotional strength he had to suppress the eye roll that was itching to make itself known. Merlin, Malfoy was an arse. He forced himself to take a calming breath and write back what he hoped was a winning response.
The girls had gone to similar lengths to stay cool. Hermione had hitched up the skirt of her robes and was currently lounging on one of the sofas, her bare legs draped over Ron’s lap as she fanned herself feebly with one hand. Pansy had dropped all pretence at propriety and was currently sitting cross-legged next to Luna’s feet in her bra and panties. She seemed unconcerned that at least two of the guys in the room kept leering at her sweat-covered cleavage, her dress robes abandoned in a heap next to her.
…about the ferret. Having firmly anchored himself in a non-perving-over-one’s-nemesis place, in the end, he had to admit this idea was simply impractical.
From there, Harry moved to Draco’s left arm, lifting it by the wrist to look at the Dark Mark and the tattoo Draco had added there mere weeks after the war had ended. The tattoo artist Draco had found had worked wonders, turning the abhorrent mark into something positive, almost beautiful.  The mark itself was still intact, if a little faded, but the head of the snake at the bottom of the skull had been elongated, transformed into the nub of a raven’s feather. The topmost section of the feather broke off into several small ravens, all flying free towards the edge of his arm.
Harry's voice was firm. "Sorry, but it's true," He looked relieved to get it all out once and for all. "I love Draco. I love him."
“It’s not. I think about you all the time.” Potter grasped his forearms, forcing eye contact. “I had a nightmare the other night, and all I wanted was for you to sing to me like you do to the ducks. What is that song anyway?”
“Are you quite finished, or do you have a supporting speech to go with that? No? Well, I’ll be on my way.” Malfoy snatched his arm away from Harry’s grip and began to walk away, shoulders drooping tiredly.
I don’t know, maybe I should do this in some kind of order or I’ll be all over the place even more than I am already.
Automatically, Harry retook his seat and reached out for Draco’s hand, rubbing his thumb gently over the pulse point at Draco’s wrist.
You wrote that you forgave me. That it hurt so much when you woke up and you didn’t find me there, that you felt your heart breaking into a million pieces.
Draco scowled and plunged his hand inside his cloak for another Pain-Relief potion, swallowing the entire thing in one go. His chest was beginning to hurt again, and the last thing he needed was his core distracting him as he tried to operate Muggle death machines.
Draco sat cross-legged on the window seat, watching as Pansy and Blaise lounged on the sofa arguing over a game of Exploding Snap. Usually, their constant stream of bickering would drive him mad, but he hadn’t had much of a chance to spend time with his friends since he and Harry had been bonded — neither of them had — and Draco couldn’t help but watch his friends fondly as they bantered back and forth, each attempting to cheat and getting caught. Harry was out with Weasley and Granger in Hogsmeade, and Draco could only hope he didn’t come back drunk. Harry, as Draco had discovered on New Year’s Eve, had no stomach for liquor, and the last thing he felt like doing was holding Harry’s hair back as he retched up into the toilet like a bloody novice.
Draco lifted his eyes from the mocking note and began to survey the other students sitting at the eighth year table. They were all chatting with each other, eating their breakfasts, and one or two were even scribbling last-minute additions to unfinished homework assignments. No one looked suspicious or smug or inordinately interested in his mail. He scanned the other house tables for clues, but no one was paying him one lick of attention! Unable to cope with the idea that someone was in that hall laughing at his confusion, he quickly grabbed the letter and his bag and strode out of the room, careful to keep his head high the entire way. He needed to check on the ducklings before class anyway.
“Condom or protection spell, Malfoy”, Harry rasped, his cock aching the longer he waited poised behind the other man.
“No, Draco, don’t you dare write this off before you even give it a chance to work. I refuse to allow you to give up! I want you to promise me that you will fight this by any means necessary!”
He could imagine Potter looking sheepish when faced with the angry matron. Merlin, the woman was frightening. However, before he could try to decipher Potter’s mumbled response, his mother began to fuss with his water glass and jug, causing the ice to clatter against the glass as it sloshed around in the water.
“You have no idea how much I’ve wanted to bite that lip of yours. You know you nibble it when you’re concentrating?” Harry sounds just as breathless as Draco is, and Draco worries that if one of them doesn’t get a hold of themselves they’ll end up passing out from asphyxiation. But trivial things like consciousness and breathing doesn’t matter when he can have his lips pressed against Harry’s. Draco tugs Harry back towards him with a growl and seals their lips back together, both men grasping at each other more intensely with every passing second.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing, Potter?” Draco shudders at the sound of his own voice, the snarl curling around his words in a way they haven’t done in months.
to Draco. He hadn’t had a chance to read it yet, what with all the time he’d been spending working with Severus, and Harry had seemed determined to rectify that immediately.
“Basically, if a wizard saves another wizard’s life, they are held in debt until they can repay it. However, you’ve both saved each other so many times that you’ve become linked into a life bond.”
Draco sat cross-legged at the bottom of the bed with Harry’s foot in his lap. They’d opted to have a lazy Sunday and had asked the house-elves to send them up a breakfast tray. They’d kissed and talked and eaten, and then kissed some more, relaxing in each other’s company. Now, they’d struck an easy bargain — Draco massaged Harry’s feet, which were feeling sore from Harry’s frequent jogs, and Harry read the articles from
“I did.” she agreed, placing her teacup back on its saucer and fixing him with a severe expression. “I have something very important to discuss with you, but first, I must ask that you promise me your discretion regardless of what action you decide is necessary.”
“Wait, those aren’t weeds.” Longbottom crawled across the circle and looked carefully at the small blooms, before fixing Draco and Potter with a hard stare. “Hermione’s right. This is all about you two.”
Harry looked over at Draco, his eyes slowly taking in his lean body, the lean thighs, the taut stomach, all the way up to the brilliantly white teeth that were nibbling at that obscenely plump bottom lip, and knew there was no decision to make. He was doing this.
“Don’t you?” Draco couldn’t resist. The idea that Harry might not hate him was both ludicrous and comforting.
He scanned the immediate area around the bar and the small group that mingled and swayed on the dance floor but couldn’t see any sign of Draco anywhere.
Slow, he reminded himself, as his fingers itched to wind their way into Harry’s hair. They were going to take it slow. Slow was kissing, and so he tilted his head more to the side and opened his mouth a little more. Harry, who apparently had the same idea, slid his tongue across Draco’s lips, drawing a low groan from Draco as he felt it enter his mouth and curl around his own. The lust from earlier was bubbling away on a slow boil just underneath his skin and, unable to stop himself, he climbed to straddle Harry’s lap, the fluffy blanket still clinging to his shoulders, his knees bracketing Harry’s thighs as he hovered just above the visible bulge in Harry’s bottoms. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist under the blanket, causing Draco to shiver and gasp as warm fingers ghosted the pale skin on his back.
"You oaf!" giggled Pansy as Neville ambled around the kitchen in imitation of a security troll. "You fancy a movie before you take over my couch?"
“Merlin! Talk about having a death wish,” mused Blaise, obviously torn between amusement and admiration. “Figured we could skip lunch in the Great Hall and head down to the kitchens instead. I need sensible conversation after that horror of a class.”
Draco sat propped up in his hospital bed, his mother fussing with the blankets next to him. Healer Greyson had been unerringly professional and attentive in caring for Draco, and Draco found himself thinking he would miss that when he was finally discharged.
— a gay bar that was infamous for one night stands and bathroom fumbles. He’d already checked out three other bars in search of Draco and had had no luck so far. Merlin, he had to find the idiot before he did some permanent damage to himself and the...well, that was something they were going to have to discuss later on.
“Hospital wing with Neville. The idiot was experimenting with cross-pollinating Venus flytraps and Venomous Tentacula. Seriously, he was lucky Harry was running late on his morning jog, or who knows what would have happened to the great buffoon.
He watched as Harry pricked his finger with his wand and dripped a few drops of blood into a small test tube. “Where do you want me to put the tears?” Draco handed him another small test tube and watched as Harry lifted it to the corner of his eye and blinked a single large tear into the phial. As he handed it over, they locked eyes, fingers meeting around the glass. “One tear. That’s all I’ll give you. It’s all you’re worth.”
Draco merely grunted in response, unwilling to discuss just how wrong Harry had the whole thing. There was little point. If talking to a Mind-Healer hadn’t helped, he wasn’t sure how much good talking to Harry would do.
“Well, obviously,” agreed Draco with slight exasperation, “but getting yourself so worked up you spontaneously combust is hardly going to make this a resounding success, now is it?”
“I need some of your hair, blood, and tears. Your magical essence is my missing ingredient; it's been balancing my core, remember?”
“It’s wherever I am,” explained Harry, his voice low, almost hypnotic. “Maybe one day, I’ll have an actual place, but for now it’s enough.”
“You have to admit it doesn’t look very good, Harry,” agreed Hermione, her hands up in a placating gesture, as if she wanted to soften the blow.
“Sorry m-mate…just wanted…to check t-things…were good,” gasped Ron, leaning against Harry for support.
The air inside Severus’ room was becoming unbreathable. Perhaps it had been a mistake to experiment with an acid base and unicorn horn, mused Draco, as he vanished as much of the acrid smoke as possible with his wand.
“It’ll disintegrate…” murmured Draco, his eyes wide in realisation. “Okay, scratch that.” He felt like vanishing the whole project, but that would be simply cursing his toe to spite his foot and even he wasn’t that stupid. The list of rejected combinations was easily thrice the size of the potential ones — more than.
“I can assure you I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.” Pansy’s tone was cold, each syllable bleeding absolute fury.
The room narrowed down, the dark edges honing in closer and closer. As the last bit of light faded out, he found himself wishing he hadn’t been so hard on his mother — she meant well.
“What do you think?” whispered Harry, as he leaned in to capture Draco’s mouth with his, sweeping his tongue into Draco’s mouth as he deepened the kiss.
“You didn’t tell me.” Harry’s cold fury was almost palpable, and Draco couldn’t resist taking a step backwards. “This whole time, for months, you’ve been working on this and you never said anything!”
“It was nothing, alright?” Harry practically bellowed, shoving his legs into his trousers. “Like I’d do
He walked away, his shoulders hunched under the weight of the crowd staring, Malfoy yelled his final parting words.
Harry helped him back into the bedroom, pressed him down onto the small sofa and wrapped a large, fluffy blanket around him. Then, Harry quickly shrugged back into his t-shirt and pushed his bare feet into his trainers, before dashing off to the kitchens for ‘
"Harry's acting a bit strange, isn't he?" He kept his voice casual. "I'll just go and check if he's all right." Without waiting for an answer, he stalked off in pursuit of Harry.
Blaise grinned. "The palest naked arse in London that I can, unfortunately, identify from seven years of living in a dormitory, and it wasn't alone."
“I saw you, skulking around the Magical Creatures section and giving Pince a hard time. I don’t know what your problem is but I’m watching you, Malfoy.”
“What?” challenged Harry, trying not to laugh at Malfoy’s obvious distress. “I love treacle tarts, and I love her. I think it suits her just fine.”
“My eh…Potions project,” Draco answered shiftily. “You know Severus; he’ll expect me to get top marks for something impossible.”
Harry pulled his charms essay closer and tried to force himself to focus, but the library was much too quiet, and his heart was far too heavy. He really wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up flunking every class over this mess.
The welts were deeper than he first thought, some of which had begun to clot and others which were still bleeding freely.
“What’s happened?” Hermione immediately got up and pulled him towards the bed, peering worriedly into his face.
"Now, Draco, try not to have a conniption." Pansy smirked over the rim of her glass. "I'm sure it's just your raw animal magnetism at work. Besides, it's not like you're seeing anyone."
“So, I do believe you owe me the rest of your Sorting story. Why did you ask to be placed in Gryffindor?”
Adults indeed. They were eighteen! Draco was no more an adult than McGonagall was a spring chicken. What the eighth year basically consisted of was a jumble of students, all suffering from different degrees of PTSD, trying their best to sink or swim together. Some were coping better than others, of course. Granger seemed to be in her element, her nose in a book and back at the top of the class. Blaise had resumed his whorish ways, seemingly determined to double the notches on his bedpost by the end of the year. Greg appeared fine, but he wasn’t, that much was obvious. He barely slept, barely spoke, barely ate. He’d taken to following Draco around more than usual and Draco, for once, didn’t mind. They seemed to embrace each other’s company, and neither one felt inclined to push the other.
“Well yeah, you know what animals are like around him. Like a moth to a flame.” Malfoy pushed his hands through his hair in desperation. “I just don’t know where else to look.”
Draco tried his best not to wince at Harry’s bitter scoff, which was softened only by the self-deprecating smile he offered before continuing. “I’ve had so much useless advice on this whole thing I could cry.”
Harry stepped close to Draco and took his hand. "About six months now. Since we all went to Majorca."
"Yeah, you sound it." Neville glared at the oblivious couple. "Look, you two, we need to talk." He waited until they'd disentangled themselves before continuing. "I'm happy you guys are together and whatnot, but if you want me to keep this a secret, then you're going to need to stop dry humping each other all over the place." Draco looked ready to interrupt, but Neville didn't give him the chance. "I'm serious. You're causing me serious psychological pain, and I swear to Merlin, if you don't stop, I'll be sending my therapy bill directly to you both!"
As if sensing he had an audience, Draco’s eyes snapped open and fixed Harry with a penetrating stare. It was surreal, Harry decided, to have someone watch you as you watched them get sucked off. He could tell every time the brunette did something Draco liked from the way Draco’s lust blown eyes would narrow to slits, as if relishing the pleasure.
Her eyes flew over the messy scrawl, her mouth forming a comical circle as she read. It was Harry's handwriting; Harry's name scrawled at the bottom of the missive. It was
“If it's a choice between burning or drowning, it’s not much of a choice at all.” Draco rested his head against Harry’s shoulder, feeling suddenly exhausted. “We were all screwed either way.”
“You’re not, are you? You’ve not even listened to a thing we’ve said at all.” Pansy’s accusation fell flat and Draco couldn’t find it within himself to care.
“Buttered toast? Well, now I do feel spoiled,” said Draco sardonically. “And what the hell is a Kreacher anyway?”
"Neville," Hermione asked, finally regaining her wits, "why aren't you surprised that we just caught Harry and Draco...doing...stuff."
"Shall I put on some music?" he blurted out suddenly, desperately trying to control the furious blush that was surely spreading across his entire body. Fuck. He was never going to be able to look Hermione in the eye after this.
“I don’t need luck,” he grumbled, tucking his now buttoned shirt into his trousers. “I need a fucking filter so I don’t make this worse.”
“Should we not put our stuff on first?” Theo panted, trying to balance his shoes on top of the clothes in his arms. “I mean, we’re all practically half-naked.”
who was saying he couldn't wait until that night to put his tongue inside Draco's— Merlin! Harry...and Draco. Draco was fucking Harry. Her best friend, with whom she shared everything, hadn't bothered to tell her he was fucking another one of their closest friends!
“Do speak up, Mother,” yawned Draco with as much dignity as he could muster. “It’s rather difficult for those of us on our deathbeds to contribute if you insist on whispering.” His mother and Potter looked at him with varying degrees of surprise, and in Potter’s case, annoyance.
As soon as the toilet door swung shut behind him, Harry could hear the moans and cries of several couples in locked cubicles as they got each other off. Cutting clearly through the other voices, was Draco’s. Harry would know that voice anywhere, especially since he’d heard Draco make similar noises not too long ago.
"Wow, I can't believe we're finally going to have our first kiss," she stated breathlessly. She hoped to all the gods in the heavens that she sounded sexy and not terrified. Or disgusted. Because honestly, this was like kissing her brother.
He knew they were being sent by one of the students in the school, possibly someone in his year, and it was utterly driving him to distraction not knowing who.
Suddenly, Draco pitched forwards slightly and groaned painfully, his hands sliding over his bloated stomach.
“Come and sit down. It’s best to just get this over with, don’t you think?” He was aiming for calm and hoped the look on his face was more encouraging than it was weird.
It only took a few minutes before they had a whole strategy ironed out. Harry was going to flirt with Hermione until she broke, and Draco was going to flirt with each and every random person who called him for a date. Once they had sworn a reluctant Neville to secrecy, they all headed back to the table, taking turns pausing along the way so as to not appear as if they'd been plotting together in the loo.
be interested in dating you. I’m not saying you should shack up with one of the scary Howler senders who want to spank you into submission, but surely there’s more to life than watching it pass you by? I hate how you talk about yourself. You’re not below anyone else and, whoever this guy is you’re in love with, they should be bloody flattered. I know I would be if I were that guy. So stop selling yourself short and just ask the guy out. What’s the worst that could happen?
He found himself inevitably thinking back to when he was sitting in the parlour looking at a medical report from the family Healer. Narcissa had told him that Draco had allowed her to call the Healer when he was throwing up constantly every morning, seemingly without a cause. However, when the Healer announced that Draco was pregnant and proceeded to give a full report on the status of his condition, Draco apparently clammed up, all but threw the Healer into the Floo, and had refused to discuss the situation ever since. She’d only found out about Harry being the father when Draco had gone on a two-day bender, and she had stumbled across Draco’s journal while searching his room for clues to his whereabouts.
“Merlin,” sighed Harry, running his hands over his face. “This whole thing would be so much easier if we could just get pissed and be done with it.”
“Fuck off!” huffed Harry, uncomfortable at the sudden turn in the conversation. Taking another bracing slurp of whisky, Harry launched into a detailed recount of his list, much to Ron and Hermione’s delight.
“What are you trying to say, Potter?” The wild creature inside his chest was back, fluttering around, stirring up traces of hope he never knew were there. He’d dreamed of exactly this, of Harry coming for him and making everything better again.
’ for the next month at least, in order to ensure his depleted magic had fully replenished. After that, apparently, they could reduce it to once per week.
“No, that’s not what I meant. It’s just, I know you’re grateful for the help, but I don't want you confusing gratitude with something more.”
Who on Godric’s green Earth had thought it was a good idea to invite Malfoy to this thing anyway? It was bad enough that they saw each other from time to time and awkward as arse if truth be told. Harry was so sick of seeing that haughty face pale and those cold eyes droop as if steeped in guilt. He didn’t want to remember Malfoy refusing to turn him in at the Manor, surrendering his wand to Harry. The truth was Harry was one more awkward meeting away from obliviating himself of the whole mess.
she wearing? "I just realised that I love it when you correct my wand movements. Then, later on, when I was practising my
Every couple of minutes he found his eyes being drawn to Potter. Even in the heat, the git was animated, his eyes shining with amusement at whatever inane thing he and Weasley were talking about. Draco was surprised to see how tactile he was, always gesturing and bestowing small touches on the shoulders or knees of his friends. Potter looked at them as if there was nothing more important in the world and Draco found himself wondering what it would be like to be the sole focus of that intensity.
“I brought you some food, in case you're hungry,” said Harry redundantly, gesturing awkwardly at the tray. “I didn’t know what you were in the mood for, so I tried to keep it light and hot.”
Neville and Blaise were both openly laughing at her now. "Ages," Neville finally answered. "And now you guys know too, which is great, so they can stop sneaking around and we can just all talk about it!"
Once their plates were clean, Draco walked back over to the bed and climbed under the covers, curling up onto his side.
“What do you think, Scarhead?” growled Draco, as he leaned into Harry and caught his lips in a searing kiss.
Harry groaned in resignation, knowing that whatever was going on in the cubicle wasn't going to be pretty. He lifted his right hand and held it over the lock, his mouth tugging into a slight smile at his wandless magic. He’d been able to do it for a while, but it still never ceased to amaze him each time he used it.
You said we’re probably going to argue 80% of the time, but if this is what make-up sex looks like, then I’m definitely up for it.
Hermione dutifully froze as Pansy painted her mouth a rich red. Then, Pansy began to rummage through a pile of shoes, finally locating a pair of impossibly high heels. "Right, put those on and then let us look at you."
But the noise was more than enough evidence to prove that Harry was indeed returned. Neville ignored him and simply left his arm splayed over his face, wondering if he could catch a catnap before their friends appeared for dinner. The sound of another cupboard slamming disabused him of that notion, unfortunately.
Minutes later, or maybe hours, Draco returned to the bedroom and stopped in front of the mirror, his towel slung loosely around his hips, the reflection of his heat-blemished skin stark against the white of the Sectumsempra scars on his chest. All he wanted to do was get into something comfortable and hammer through the mountain of homework that was beginning to accumulate. He grabbed some matching grey pyjamas from his trunk at the bottom of his bed, and then froze. There was something on his bed. Something large and fluffy and obscenely yellow.
“Harry!” Hermione hissed, her hair beginning to frizz—always a danger sign. “You’re not even trying to pay attention, are you?”
The cries were growing in volume, if that was possible. The pitch was now in the high whistle range. It was a possibility that, very soon, only bats would be able to hear them, and wouldn’t that be a bloody blessing! It took everything in his body to resist cowering in the corner of the enclosure with his hands pressed firmly over his ears, but in all honesty, he knew that just wouldn’t solve anything. He peered into the box and squinted at the ducklings. They looked exhausted and upset, and boy did he know the feeling! They looked like they needed to be hugged or something, but how could he do that without bloody touching them! The damned book advised to initially handle them as little as possible.
Neville tried to make sense of everything he was seeing, but it was just too much. He needed to talk to Pansy and Hermione. "Who else knows?"
Jokes apart, send my regards to Granger and Crookshanks (don’t bother with Weasley). I can’t believe you let a cat destroy your teabags. Honestly, Potter? You defeated a Dark Lord and capitulated to a kitten? I can only imagine what the
He hadn’t cried when Voldemort seared the mark into his skin even though the agony was the worst thing he had ever experienced. When Harry had walked in on him in that bathroom he hadn’t been crying, but Merlin had it been close! There were tears, sure. But he hadn’t been crying. Crying inferred despair, but what he’d been feeling was something so far beyond that. He could remember the feeling of pure unadulterated terror churning through his body, nearly doubling him over. So no, he hadn’t cried then. He hadn’t even cried when his father had been led away after his guilty verdict to receive The Kiss. There was no way some vigilante lower years were going to make him cry now.
"Thor has his hammer! That's much better than a crummy old wand." Pansy's voice was beginning to rise as she got caught up in the argument as usual.
Anyway, I’m lying next to you, in your ginormous bed that smells like you and me and sex, and I’m writing to you. Because I didn’t actually send my last letter. You see, you always think I’m a coward, and I know sometimes I am, but yesterday I wasn’t.
Clothes began to drop to the floor as they ripped t-shirts off and tugged open trousers. All too quickly, they were naked and on top of the bed. They grunted
“Fine!” screamed Draco, and he slammed his foot as hard as he could on the left pedal. The car lurched and shuddered to a stop as the brakes screamed in protest. The air was filled with the smell of burning rubber. “Happy? We’ve fucking stopped! Oh!” Draco found himself sitting in utter surprise at the realisation he had managed to complete the circuit, the car currently stopped directly where they had started. “See!” he demanded triumphantly, “I did it! Better and faster than you!”
“I’m going to apparate us, are you ready?” He waited for Draco to nod before he spun them, picturing Grimmauld Place clearly in his mind’s eye.
Harry looked at Treacle, at how much she was clearly suffering, and hardened his resolve. He snatched up the letter and flopped onto his bed, determined if he had to read the thing, he'd at least be comfortable. After a moment’s hesitation, he broke the seal and began to read.
When we reached the entrance we agreed that I would go to dinner, and he would stay in the dorms to "recover" from his Dragon Pox.
We sat talking in the dim blue glow surrounding us for hours when suddenly Draco said something that caught my attention.
He put the parchment back on the table and whisked out of the library. Why was he so difficult? I watched him close the doors and my head dropped to the table.
I walked her over to Draco who was standing up from crouching by another box. He looked at me confused and I shrugged. I felt her shove the piece of paper into my hand.
I rolled my eyes and leaned in slightly, "Are. You. Corrupting. Me?" He put his hand on the desk behind him and looked around the room before responding.
Ron quite visibly cringed, his emotions going haywire. His eyes locked to mine, showing an intensity I didn't know existed.
"No, nothing like that." I had no clue how to start this conversation. "I think I might... I don't know Hermione. I need therapy or something at this point."
"Keep it. It has a charm similar to the catalogs in the library, so it shouldn't run out of pages." He gathered his things and reached a hand out for me to take.
I now had another reason to add to the growing list of why I should make amends with him. I needed to be kinder. He hadn't done anything this time, which was unusual. Normally he started everything we had a spat about. I realized it was probably for appearances and to show how much power he held over the Slytherins.
I smirked, "Very." I leaned down as to kiss him, and in that slight moment of panic on his face, I couldn't help myself.
It's no secret that a lot of people hate Smith and it's not like he ever liked me so it was a fair game. They both, however, were in the DA, so when I saw them using the spells I taught them outside of class I would have been proud. This was not that case.
I looked over to the Slytherin end of the table a lot. It felt oddly like sixth year. My friend's sent me questioning glances, but remained quiet.
Over time I would learn to deal with the status, the fame, whatever you'd like to call it. Throughout all of this, I would still disagree. For how can I be a savior if I couldn't even save myself.
so they weren't rumors after all. They had to be true, though it's not like I could outright ask him. Maybe later he would tell me, and maybe he didn't quite know yet.
I hopped up on to the counter and popped a gumdrop off my door to eat. He looked at me like I had just killed someone.
"Knock, knock," I wrapped the bedpost twice. Dean popped out of the covers, the blush wasn't super noticeable on his complexion, but it was obviously there.
Did he like any of the good classes? Plus, I wasn't sure if I wasn't even qualified for an advanced class.
What do you get for someone who you've only been dating for a day, but have wanted to date for months?
So that was four out of the ten books that I couldn't find. Before looking further I decided to ask Hermione what she found. When I got to her I looked over her shoulder at her list. All five books were crossed out. She turned to me and asked the question I had been going to ask her.
I can remember that day clearer than any other in my life. It's ingrained in my soul and has defined me in more ways than one.
Instantly, his hand flew to his left forearm and I moved closer. He searched my face as I reached out to brush my hand over the fabric of his sleeve.
"Usually when someone brings up things like that in an argument it's to draw attention away from what they've done. Be honest with me Ginny, because I never cheated. There wasn't any time to fool around out there."
He gestured to the middle of the page. There were the books we had been searching for, all in a row, all checked out on the same day by the same person.
"What did you expect Harry! You were gone for a year! Merlin knows who you could have met while you were out. You're the bloody boy-who-lived for Godric's sake." Her face was getting almost as red as her hair. I hadn't realized she felt this way. Then I noticed it.
Draco bent down and took the laces in his hands. Very quickly he tied them and then stood up. My breath hitched slightly, remembered my thoughts from earlier. He was awfully close.
Draco sat on his bed, the curtains apart, and staring into space. He didn't notice me until I crept over to his bed. I tapped his shoulder,
I stared at him, and he shifted slightly, looking awkward. I had honestly thought was a really good student, one of the best actually. He was no Hermione, but- "That's it!"
He was getting fidgety and I knew why. There was a lot that happened to both of us that we wouldn't want to talk to people about. I was kind of trying to answer those questions from earlier, but I didn't want to make him uncomfortable.
We had been looking through random books for the rest of the class hour. Only having two classes a day was fantastic.
There was one person though, that after everything, understood what I've gone through in a somewhat different light. I had never expected it to happen. I didn't want it at the time by any means. But, when the world dies down you have to spice it back up a bit. I still can remember that day when I died, correction, almost died. I escaped the inevitable, again. When I fell I heard the yell of this person and he came running, I didn't know why. He would later claim that he yelled to me because I was his only hope, his only sense that something so terrible could have a shred of light. When he ran, out of the grasp of the embodiment of death, he too was hit.
His hand found my cheek and I leaned into it. It was slightly awkward, but so were we so I think it fits.
Draco motioned towards me. I breathed, taking in my surroundings. This was a familiar place, with a familiar person. I could say what I wanted, it would be ok.
He jumped slightly, I guess he didn't actually expect me to be awake. He shook his head, but slowly it turned into a nod. What I would give to read his mind right now...
"Hey, it's ok. I'd love to go to Hogsmeade with you even if we don't know as what yet. I like you, like a lot." There I said it, proud of me?
And with that, we were alone in the library, practicing sign language for the next few hours. We would occasionally laugh, or our conversations would sidetrack. Just two boys that couldn't sleep and somehow made a neutral agreement not to kill each other.
Draco and I fight, all healthy relationships get in arguments occasionally, but we are far more mature now.  I only wanted to add this note because I care about you, and don't want you to use this argument as something that is ok in a relationship. This situation was not good on either of us.
This made him laugh. If you have never seen Draco Malfoy laugh, I would recommend it. It will make you forget about your stupidity and go right along with him. He looked genuinely happy for the first time ever.
I moved my lips, I was close enough for anyone to be able to read them. "You need to trust yourself. I don't hate you anymore, I've only ever truly hated one person. Become comfortable in your own skin, then push me away. Are you corrupting me?"
I lost many things that day, but I would give up a thousand more for everyone else to continue with their lives normally. I had no one to lose, which is why I never had a problem with risking my life. When I saw the lives around me fade away that was when it sunk in. Even though I had nobody left, I had nothing more to be taken, that wasn't the case for the hundreds of people there that day.
we hadn't been making any progress and I was beginning to care less and less about fixing our scheduling problems. We needed to pick ten classes by the end of this "meeting". The biggest problem with this was we had totally different interests. Maybe our job courses had something in common. There was only one problem. I didn't have a job course anymore because I had no clue what to do with my life. I did not want to hunt evil for the rest of my life, no matter what the rest of the world felt. "
With a story a big as this one, it is important to have eyes everywhere, and it's a good thing we do. One of our esteemed reporters was stationed in muggle London, just out of the apparition point. Little did she know that two unsuspecting boys would appear and give her the biggest scoop in months.
It was then he remembered why he was here in the first place. I don't think the Ministry of Magic would be too kind on an ex- Death Eater ranting about how evil muggles were. "
"These kinds of relationships are slightly different than, well you know. They just don't last, plus they probably don't even like me back." I furrowed my brows.
Shit, this isn't going to end well. In order to do this, I'm going to have to stare at Draco's lips for over an hour, and as nice as that might seem, it's going to be extremely difficult.
I walked ahead of him, my speed increasing the closer we came to the glow. There was a large ring of shrubs surrounding it, so I pulled Draco down and crept behind them.
Both boys had managed to corner Draco and he was entirely helpless. When you can't hear not only do you not know when an ambush may happen, you also don't know what they're ambushing you with so you can cast the proper countercurse.
I had expected a touching moment. On of those sappy romantic things where she cried and kissed me goodbye. I was somewhat relieved when she didn't, but I would have taken that over what came.
In my head, I thought that murder was totally realistic. I could probably just pull the Savior Card and get away with it. I looked at the pale eyes in front of me and realized how that would only make it worse.
He stepped back, not out of fear, but because of something I couldn't pick from his features. I just couldn't understand why he wasn't jumping at this opportunity.
Malfoy signed. Feeling my cheeks get warm,  I rolled my eyes, mentally cursing myself for breaking eye contact.
It was undeniable now, and I was scared shitless. I officially hate that list, nothing good came from fifth year.
"Wait until people find out. They'll hate you, you know that right?" I was about to take my leave just then. "If I see you again, I won't let you control me with this. Goodbye Gin."
I instantly had my answer clear as day, I needed to go back to Hogwarts. For everybody who had put faith in me, my friends,
The library owned ten books that included anything that would help to cure magical deafness. The fact that they were all gone was more than coincidence. Did someone know his plans? Were they going to sabotage him? Had Malfoy gotten them first?
He tends to get angry and leave situations that feed into these thoughts, I knew he would come around though. I still couldn't help but be furious with Ginny. The worst part is, there's really not much I could do about it.
It wasn't until I was out of the library I thought to dig in my pocket. Inside was a small note, written in the neatest script I've ever seen.
I had just finished telling Ron and Hermione I was going out into the forest. As they walked away, Hermione crying into Ron's shoulder, I yelled for him.
liked that person or when they were in a relationship. Sure I'm friends with Draco, but that's it. Just friends. Not even great friends considering how new a development this whole thing is and our large history.
Mr. A didn't scare me, not in the slightest. He seemed like a kind guy who just happened to have some extreme features. He may have been tall, had dark eyes, and never smiled, but that didn't mean I would cower in his line of sight. This just felt weird, maybe I didn't know him as well as I thought?
I was going to leave him be, but then I noticed something else. He was blinking behind his closed eyelids. He was faking sleep, he knew we were here.
I read the note from Ginny three times before it sunk in. Draco had read his and he obviously didn't enjoy it. It reoccurred to me that I was still planted a meter away from the table, unmoving. I signed a quick
Now, dear readers, I hope this situation has not upset you to much. Writing this scene, looking back, I realize I should have done things very differently. It was very difficult to relive this moment, which is why I will leave out some of the less glamorous moments in this chapter.
The largest explanation we at the Daily Prophet have been able to come up with is that this is all Draco Malfoy's fault. Mr Malfoy has a large history of dark magic and corruption, not to mention his public hatred of Harry Potter. It would not be wrong to suspect that there might be either a love potion or the use of Mind Control.
I really didn't want him pushing me away like that. It made it seem like he didn't care about me when I-, nevermind.
When I made it to the dorm half the people were either studying or in the common room. Ron on the other hand was reading the last issue of
"No, it's not why we dated. I only dated you so I could be normal again. I hate being different! It's been like that my whole life. Can't you see why I needed to date someone? People might have suspected."
I must say this was really testing my patience. Hadn't I just said he changed? Maybe he wasn't really mean, but his attitude was still just as strong.
He was lying through his teeth... hands? I don't know, anyways. He didn't feel like he could tell me. The strangest thing was, I felt hurt. I wanted to move past this hatred. How could we do that if he didn't loosen up a bit?
He seemed to struggle between rolling his eyes and being grateful. He just squeezed my hand and dropped them to his side, never letting go.
Ron and Hermione seemed concerned. Ron wasn't in the class, but Hermione had told him what she saw. They didn't even mention Draco though.
I signed back, laughing at his confused look I walked away from him and back into the chilly London air.
I went out to see Hagrid once over the past weeks. He hasn't changed much, but I do miss his voice. It was so unique and the book did nothing with his scratchy handwriting. I mention a few of the things that had been on my mind, not saying any names. Hagrid has always been a sort of therapist when I needed it. He's a great listener.
I suppose me being gay made sense, it was like something finally clicked. It would explain my nonexistent love-life, my strange feeling of attraction throughout the years, and everything that's been going on recently. I looked back to Draco, I hoped he would be fine, for his sake and mine.
My body had slumped into a state of shock, then the pieces clicked together. The fake smiles, the dark eyes, a room that appeared unused, and a scene, painted in moonlight, with a single person sitting in the woods night after night. How could I have been so stupid?
When I found Draco he was surrounded by books thrown onto the floor. He seemed stressed about something.
I had been waiting at the same table, for Hermione to show up, reliving my previous conversation. I really did think he was making a slight effort to change. He didn't call me any names, didn't call Hermione a Mudblood, and we agreed, somewhat, on our classes. His attitude seemed to be just as snarky, but as someone who's been around that for years, I know it was half-hearted. Even so, some of his words still hurt.
I remember when Ron asked me who I did fancy, I simply thought of all the girls I was friends with and picked one. There was no real attachment. The images that popped into my head were just a coincidence.
Is it bad that sometimes I don't want a cure? I know it's horribly selfish, but I like that we can really only communicate with each other. I get scared to lose that when we find the cure. Its something special, something only we understand.
