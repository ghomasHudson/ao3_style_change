After a couple of hours, and Leo being passed around like a game of pass the parcel, we decide to head home. We say our goodbyes and I pick up Teddy while. Draco pushes the pram.
“Olivia, please fetch Mr Malfoy a glass of water.” Blonde number two says. He sounds stern and I’m guessing Olivia is new to the job. She scurries to the door on the other side of the foyer.
knowing me?”
Draco Malfoy
Draco
“Wow, Draco Malfoy, finally falling for a man, and it’s Harry fucking Potter - hot, sexy, powerful, billionaire.”
“Hey.” He smiles and kisses me quickly on the lips. He then proceeds to say hello to everyone else and the group get chatting again. I go up to the bar to get Draco a drink, I’m still kind of apologising for everything but he's long forgiven me. After another few minutes Ron clears his throat and gets everyone’s attention.
“No.”
I shrug, feeling thrown by his sudden interest. Move to London with Pans, find a job hopefully in publishing or potions. I hadn’t really thought about it much. I just want to get through my finals.
“Right, we better get going. I’ll see you very soon little cub. Andy, thank you for the cup of tea.”
Pansy gasps.
“What the hell was that?!” I ask him.
I was very nervous for our date today. For one, I was going to his, aka Malfoy manor, so we had both had meals at each other’s. For another, this was date number 5 and with all the snogging and groping that went on last time, I’m pretty sure something is going to happen tonight. I’m not sure I want to even go to the manor let alone do anything there. I know it's Draco’s home but I don’t know how he can relax there with all the horrible memories. I've been agitated all week thinking about tonight. Usually I’m ecstatic before a date with Draco but I’ve been dreading this one. I've barely slept and my nightmares have been worse than usual and I can’t even bare to tell Hermione I’m going there, I don’t want her nightmares to come back. I just have to keep myself busy and my mind off it. I could do with cleaning the house up a bit, it's gotten a bit messy lately because I’ve been so busy. Actually I’ve hardly been home this week, I’ve been working late almost every night and when I’ve not been there I’ve been at Ron and Hermione’s and if not there then I’ve been to see Teddy. He’s 3 already and growing so fast, I see him as much as I can and I’m trying to be a father figure for him as he has nobody else. He’s a great little kid and I do see him as my family. He may have started out the same as me with both parents dying at the hands of Voldermort but he will grow up loved and knowing all about his parents and himself.
“Hi.” I say sheepishly. I forgot about the whole ringing me back thing he could do.
I wander into the kitchen to join Pansy.
3 days later and tomorrow was Nia’s birthday. She was spending the day with me and Draco at the house, where we would surprise her with her room. Then Hermione and Ron and Neville were going to come over for a small meal. After that she was going out with her friends for drinks.
Harry Potter
Hope you enjoy. All kudos and comments are much appreciated. Thank you! x
“Hi.” I wander out the kitchen and into the living room, away from Harry.
Holy shit, is he
tell them of those tricks…….
“S-sure.” I stutter, completely thrown by this. I glance at Pansy and blush, she just grins at me and winks. Then I notice Blaise, he is scowling.
It was nice knowing you.
“What paperwork?”
“What’s that supposed to mean? Someone like me!” I demand and move back so she has to drop her arms, which were on my shoulders.
I sigh and frown.
“You. Are. So. Sweet.” He says each word in between kisses and I try to grind against him to get some relief.
“So nothing to do with her.”
This chapter is kind of short, so I’m going to post chapter 5 as well this week. Which is also short sorry.
I nod enthusiastically against his back. It looks otherworldly, unreal, and I would love to take a picture. I bet Blaise would love the view. The memory of Blaise's attempt at kissing me haunts me. I’m starting to feel mean for not calling him back, but he can wait until tomorrow.
“Draco? Are you in there?” The door opens and I slip inside. I close the door and turn around, only to find Draco a mess on the floor. He’s curled up leaning against the wall and sobbing.
The submissive will not drink to excess, smoke, take recreational drugs or potions, or put himself in any unnecessary danger.
“You.”
“I know.” He says confidently and lifts his chin slightly.
“You left and it's my fault. I pushed too hard for all this and you walked out.” I continue to cry.
“When did you get back from travelling?” I ask.
I glance up and Blaise is still hovering, watching us. I groan and put my head in my hands. This is the worst moment of my life. The only thing worse, that I can think of, is Harry's rejection. I glance at him now and he is staring down at me giving nothing away. Then I turn to Blaise again and glare at him. I will be having words with my so-called friend tomorrow.
2 weeks later when Hermione and Ron come to collect crookshanks, Draco is here and holding him thankfully. We all say our hellos and Hermione takes crookshanks straight away.
“Would you like some?” He offers, his secret smile back.
Oh…..and part of me is suddenly insanely jealous - I’m disturbed by the depth of my feeling.
“Yes, I thought that was you. Not to mention I could hear all the whispers.” He chuckled. “Can I help you?”
“So Harry, what can I do for you?” Straight to the point as usual. I swallow some tea and take a breath.
“Ready?” Harry asks and squeezes my hand again. I find myself nodding back to him. “Let’s go.” He takes some keys out of his pocket and walks us over to the motorbike. He hands me a helmet and I just stand there staring, still not understanding. He takes the helmet back and places it on my head himself. He takes the strap and makes sure it is tight enough and the helmet is secure. He then puts his own on and sits the bike at the front. I stand there looking at Harry and then the bike and back again. Weasley comes over and offers me a hand to get on, mistaking my hesitation. I sit behind Harry and he takes my hands and wraps them around himself. Then I feel a spell invellop us and instantly feel a bit safer.
“You smell so good.” he murmurs, and closes his eyes, a look of pure pleasure on his face, and I practically convulse. He reaches up and tugs the duvet off the bed, then pushes me gently so I fall on to the mattress.
“Your welcome. I hope he did more than moan at you for not ignoring his birthday.” I say and we both laugh and make our way to the dining room.
“Something like that.”
“Come on cub, bedtime. Say goodnight.” He leans his head on my shoulder and wraps his legs around my hips.
I swallow. I feel my cock hardening. But I can’t have this. His most potent weapon, used against me again. He’s so good at sex - even I’ve figured this out.
“Come on. I think we both need a nap.” I start pulling him to the stairs and he doesn’t hesitate for a second.
“Let’s discuss this in my study. I want to show you something.”
“I like to build things. I like to know how muggle things work: what makes them tick, how to construct and deconstruct. Also I have a love of ships. What can I say?” He shrugs nonchalantly.
“I think I should go speak to Ron.” I tell Draco before we have a chance to sit down.
“Can you wrap this?” He says in a clipped tone. Fuck...have I offended him? I take a deep breath and take the plate to the kitchen. What the fuck is this guys deal?
I push the office door open and instantly trip over my own feet, and fall headfirst into the office. Shit! Me and my two left feet. I get to my hands and knees and then feel gentle hands around me. I feel so embarrassed and quickly get to my feet with the help of someone. I look up to see who exactly it is, guessing it must be Mr Potter, and am shocked to find a young handsome man.
I bend down and kiss his belly. I’m so happy and Draco Malfoy made me that way.
“I see. Is he your boyfriend?”
“He could laugh in my face and leave me.” I mumble mostly to myself but she hears me and elbows me in the ribs.
“Do you wanna hold him Molly?” I ask her. She nods and then steps back.
“Come on, let's celebrate. And both of you have to come to the opening.” He says it while looking at me and I blush.
Shit. I have no idea. I am completely stumped. He gazes at me and furrows his brow.
“Draco, you're lying.” I say as realisation dawns on me.
“Thanks guys, this has been a great birthday.” They smile at me and we all sit down to eat our cupcakes.
I want to touch him. I move my hands and rather awkwardly, given I’m restrained, feel his hair. He stops kissing me and glares up at me, shaking his head from side to side, tutting as he does. He reaches for my hands and places them above my head again.
I breathe.
At the foot of the bed, set apart a few feet, is a large oxblood chesterfield couch, just stuck in the middle of the room facing the couch. A strange placement...to have a sofa facing the bed. I smile at myself then because out of everything in this room that I could have found strange I pick up on the sofa, when really it’s the only mundane piece of furniture in the room.
25 minutes later we are sat in a waiting room in st mungos. There are a few pregnant witches around us and we are getting a few stares. Maybe I should suggest waiting somewhere else next time.
“I have to stay here and clean. There are still marks.” I start breathing heavily and scrubbing harder and harder. My knuckles are catching on the floor and starting to bleed but I can't feel it. I can’t feel anything and I can't breathe and I have to go to the Manor and that’s where he was and where Hermione got tortured and where Luna was held prisoner and I can't breathe. I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe.
“I wanted to.”
“I’m currently funding some research in crop rotation and soil science, so I was visiting the farming division.” He says this matter of factly. See! Not her to find me at all. My subconscious sneers at me, loud, proud, and pouty. I blush again at my thoughts.
His blazing green eyes still haunt my dreams but I’ve tried not to think about him. Why the hell has he sent me these? He told me I wasn’t for him.
6    Everything in this contract must be read and interpreted in the light of the fundamental purpose and the fundamental terms set out in clause 2-5 above.
“I don’t have any idea yet.” He chuckles into my neck again. We are still swaying together to the music. I have my eyes closed and am just thinking about Draco and the baby. We are in our bubble again even though I can hear the laughter and voices of the rest of our family.
She was watching us and smiling softly before we turned around and now quickly changed her expression.
“I know you don’t want to talk about him, but Draco, he is so into you. Warnings or not.”
“Why?”
Enjoy X
Me, Pansy, and Blaise all walk down to the main doors at 9:30 to meet Potter. When we get there though he is chatting with Mcgonagall and Sprout. Holy shit, he looks hot. He’s wearing a white shirt, open at the collar, and grey flannel pants that hang from his hips. He has a small cloak on top that's also open to show off his clothes underneath. His unruly black hair is still damp. My mouth goes dry and I’m pretty sure I blush. So fucking hot!
“He is more like family.” I say.
“How long have you known Pansy Parkinson?”
“Merlin Hermione, do I have to?” I moaned to the women in question.
“I understand. A couple of letters came for you, and Blaise has been floo calling every hour on the hour. He looks desperate.”
“That’s very clever uncle Harry.”  Teddy says and then runs to the furthest door. “This one?” He asks with his hand on the doorknob. I nod and Draco hands me Leo so he can cover Teddy’s eyes. I kiss him on the head and then smile from him to Teddy.
“Ermmm yeah, he’s good thank you. I’ll tell him you asked about him.”
“It's a pleasure, Draco. That colour suits you.” I blush and look back down at my tea. It’s the right colour now, maybe a bit over, so I take the bag out.
The laptop is on loan. Indefinitely, Mr Malfoy.
“Of course not. I like having you here.” He frowns as he says this and then glances at his watch. “It’s late.” And he turns to look at me. “You’re biting your lip.” His voice is husky, and he’s eyeing me speculatively.
“The only people who call me by my first name are my family and a few close friends. That’s how I like it.”
“Okay.” I agree readily, smiling up at him, relieved. The thought of Pansy with Harry’s balls is not something I want to dwell on.
15.10: Like loaning me out to someone else would ever be an option. But I’m glad it’s here in black and white.
“I look forward to it, Mr Malfoy.” I can picture the wicked gleam in his eyes. How can he reduce me to such a mess with so little words? I put my phone down and realise Pansy is standing right there staring at me wide eyed. My smile drops off my face and I turn around and pretend to be busy.
“Draco!”
“Okay, this evening.” he acquiesces. “Now eat your breakfast.”
probably not. Harry Potter is not famed for his sense of humour. But I know it exists, I’ve experienced it. Maybe I’ve gone too far. I wait for his answer.
“Mr Malfoy, what a pleasant surprise.” His gaze is unwavering and intense.
“Yeah, a few. But they only wanted me for my status as ‘the boy who lived’.”
“Okay that’s 5 minutes apart babe. Another hour and Katie will be here. Okay?” I hug him from behind and kiss his head. He nods and leans against me.
“Draco, Mollys having a party for Ron next week at the Burrow, and it would be amazing if you would join me. Molly has said you’re welcome and I know Ron and Hermione would love to have you there. And your mum said you didn’t have any plans. And well, I would love for you to finally meet everyone.” I shut myself up because Draco has gone very pale, more so than usual, and his hand has started to shake a bit in my hand. “Are you oka-“
It’s been 2 months since mine and Draco’s anniversary of a year together, and 2 months since we had the devil cat over to stay, which means Draco has been in my life now for 14 months. Yet he still hasn’t been to any of the family meals at the burrow. Molly and Arthur have been inviting him since practically the beginning, but he always squirms his way out of them. He always has work to do or plans he has made or people he has to see. But next week is Ron's birthday, and Molly has planned a birthday party at the burrow and invited everyone, including me and Draco. Draco is friends with Ron now, well as good a friend as they are going to be, so he can't say no to this. I’m going to casually slip it into conversation tonight when I go over to his. I told him I would come over for tea tonight because he always comes to mine, so hopefully he will be in a good mood and say yes. I already talked to Narcissa and she told me that he didn’t have any plans for the date of the party. So he has no excuse to say no really.
I get to the bathroom and tap gently on the door.
“Can I take this cap off now? I feel ridiculous.” He just gives a small chuckle and I take it off, shrink it and put it in my robe pocket. I also undo my robe down the middle so that my grey shirt and neck are showing. It’s a bit more skin showing than I am used to, but even I have to admit I look hot in it.
“Harry, what you fail to understand is that I wouldn't talk about us to anyone anyway. Even Pansy. So it’s immaterial whether I sign an agreement or not. If it means so much to you, or your lawyer….whom you obviously talk to, then fine. I’ll sign.”
“Oh no, just 17 hours.” He says sarcastically, then comes over and kisses Leo. “Worth every minute though.” He smiles at me and I pull him down to sit on my knee instead of Teddy who is enthralled by the baby. He puts his arms around me and kisses me softly.
“No I meant about the blood?” I point to the trail of blood. He waves me off and throws up again.
“Do you want me to stay or wait in the kitchen?”  Hermione asks. I look at her and open my mouth but I can't speak.
“Everything okay?”
After Draco told me he wanted to give birth at home, I put in extra effort and brought in extra help to get this place finished. Most of Weasleys, excusing new dad Ron, came over. Luna, Neville, Teddy, Dean, Seamus, and even Pansy and Blaise came to help. After Draco had had a stern talk to them about not being round enough.
“Wooo! I told you I’d win.” He says trying to catch his breath.
He doesn’t want to kiss me again? Why? I pout at the thought and don’t understand. His surname really should be Cryptic, not Potter.
“Draco, she’s not going to hurt you. She just wants to check the baby.”
“Yeah I’ve had fun too. I guess she was right.” He said and kissed me. I kissed him back and things got quite heated. He climbed onto my lap and kissed me deeply. Just as I was about to make a move, his stomach grumbled. I stopped kissing him and looked at his stomach.
“Hello sir.” I smile at him.
“Hello Severus.” Pansy kisses Sev on both cheeks, making him blush. “Have you met Draco’s boyfriend? Harry Potter.”
“Not Miss Parkinson.” He lifts his eyebrow clinically and extends his long-fingered hand to me. “I’m Harry Potter. Are you alright? Would you like to sit?”
“Tomorrow, then. You’ll call?” The hope in his voice twists my heart.
“I’m in London.”
The ceremony takes another hour to conclude. It’s interminable. Finally, McGonagall leads the other professors off through the side door to yet more rousing applause, preceded by Harry and Pansy. Harry does not glance at me, even though I’m willing him to do it. I pout.
“Goodnight, Harry.”
“Yeah, good luck with that!” I laugh and he punches me jokingly. “A little hermione with your hair. I can imagine it.” We both laugh at that then.
“It was. Do you think he’d like it?” I ask him.
“Uncle Harry said I can be the one to tell Draco about the horseys!”
Dear Mr Malfoy,
“I know. I never have.”
“Shit, Draco!” Potter shouts from behind me and I can hear the fear in his voice and instantly know where I have fallen. I look up and see, in slow motion, the whomping willow coming straight at me. I tuck my arms over my hair and say goodbye to the world.
Obedience:
I look forward to receiving your notes on the contract.
“Yeah, we had a quick look around to see what we got stuck with haha.” She chuckled with me now but still looked a bit nervous.
“Deal.” I tell her and laugh. “We’ll leave you to look around, this whole loft and everything in it is yours. Come down whenever you want, me and Draco are going to do some cleaning and de-weeding outside.” I tell her and walk towards Draco.
“I’m going to be 6 years old!” He points his chin and says proudly. That makes me laugh loudly because he looks just like Draco doing it. Draco glares at me and talks to Teddy ignoring me.
First thing I do is check my phone. It needs charging, so I hunt down the charger and plug it in before I can see my messages. I have four missed calls, one voicemail, and two texts. Three missed calls from Harry…..no voicemail. One missed call from Blaise and a voicemail from him wishing me all the best for graduation.
“I was actually thinking maybe...maybe we could tell them today? I mean it’s Teddy’s birthday in 2 days so I don’t want to ruin his big day, and with my mother and Mrs Weasley knowing already, she is bound to find out soon. Better to come from us right?” He sounds kind of shy about it but he seems serious about it.
“I tried when we came in.” I tell her but she gives me the sad eyes and I cave. “Fine, give me a minute.”
“Well Potter, it's been a pleasure. Next time, I’ll definitely be choosing where you take me.” He insisted and i stood in shock for a minute, and without thinking blurted out,
“Hey, Draco, my slytherin prince,” Sev croons. “Big day….yes? Would you like me to stay for a while and make some tea?”
He smiles at me. “I’m still at the hotel. I just apparated over.”
“Are you ready?” She asks when I’m finished. I nod and we go through to the sitting room where a small plump woman, who reminds me of professor sprout, sits quietly.
“Hey, I have interviews! The week after next, in London, for intern placements!”
“Actually, I was going to ask you the same thing. I think it would be nice.”
“We’ve all been here, perhaps not as dramatically as you.” He says. “You should know your limits Draco. I’m all for pushing limits but this is stupid. Do you make a habit of this behaviour?”
“That reminds me, why the hell did you make me ask him if he was gay! That was the most embarrassing thing I’ve ever done and he was definitely pissed that I asked.” I frown at her and the memory.
When it’s okay I get him back into bed.
“I’m doing okay. It was a lot to take in but it all made sense so I couldn’t not take it in.”  She looks sad again now, but we have to discuss it.
“It’s a little something, but every Malfoy has one. I’ve still got yours Draco.”
“Yes. but I don’t know about...the future.”
“That's a Dom/Sub thing. You’ll get used to it.”
“Pull your knees up.” he orders softly, and I’m quick to obey. “I’m going to fuck you now, Mr Malfoy.” he murmurs as he positions the head of his cock against my entrance. He pushes into me slowly now.
“Nice choice.” I say and take the bottle to pour the drinks.
“Why?” I ask when she’s gone.
Draco
“I’ll….ermm, see you inside.” Blaise mutters and slips back into the building. We both ignore him. Now I’m on my own with Potter though. Shit. What do I say? Should I apologise for the phone call…..and the vomit.
He frowns,
I don't know why I glance up, maybe I catch a slight movement from the corner of my eye, I don't know, but when I do, he’s standing in the doorway of my bedroom, watching me intently. He’s wearing his grey flannel pants and a white linen shirt, holding his broom to the side of him. I pull my earbuds out and freeze.
“Are you ashamed of me?”
“I would have been fine. I was with Pansy.” I murmur.
“Give me a moment.” I mutter quietly. He blinks a couple of times.
“It’s alright love, I know.” I say gently back. I get up then and look at him. “So, how about we go take some of that anger out on ripping our home apart?” I ask him and he smiles back.
“Dray, you okay?” I whisper to him and move his hair out his eyes.
Mr Malfoy,
I laugh, in spite of my tears. Tea is always the answer, according to Sev. I remember my mother complaining about him, saying that when it came to tea and sympathy, he was always good at the tea, not so hot on the sympathy.
“Hang me that phone right now.” Pansy says, coming out of her bedroom and holding her hand out.
15.3   The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with all necessary training and guidance in how to properly serve the Dominant.
“Very long.” I reply, my voice husky, too low, full of need.
“And if I don’t want to sign anything?”
“Don't apologise. It’s just that I want to bite it, too, hard.”
“You know, Draco, it’s been a weekend of firsts for me, too.” he says quietly.
“Are you hungry?”
“Oh, Draco, what I could do to you.” he whispers. He removes my other shoe and sock, then stands and removes my jeans completely. I’m lying on his bed dressed only in my boxers, and he’s staring down at me.
Harry Potter
“No,” he says firmly. Then he bends down and scoops me over his shoulder. I squeal loudly with shocked surprise, and he gives me a ringing slap on my arse.
“SO WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT FACE BEFORE WITH TEDDY?” Draco shouts over from his broom. I roll my eyes because I didn’t think he’d bring that up now.
“Okay good. You can close your eyes if it helps Draco.” Katie says and Draco nods and closes his eyes while holding my hand for dear life.
“Harry?! What’s going on? I guess we aren’t playing tag?” She says and hums to herself.
I grin back at him.
“Good evening Harry, I’m very well thank you. And thank you for leaving my son with me today, it's been lovely.” She smirks at me.
“Right I’m going to speak to Hermione then. And if she’s already told that prat, I’m going to kill you.” He gets up and leaves me lying there cold.
“Luna, calm down,” Lily admonishes softly. “Hello, darling,” she says as she kisses Harry on both cheeks. He smiles down at her warmly, and then shakes hands with his father.
“Enough,” he snaps.
“All of it.” He shouts.
Harry is leaning casually against the bar, drinking a glass of white wine. He’s dressed in his customary white linen shirt, black jeans, and a black jacket. His hair is atrociously wild as ever. I sigh. I stand for a few seconds in the entrance of the bar, gazing at him, admiring the view. He glances, nervously I think, towards the entrance and stills when he sees me. Blinking a couple of times, he then smiles a slow, lazy, sexy smile that renders me speechless and all molten inside. Making a supreme effort not to bite my lip, I move forward, aware that I, Draco Malfoy of Clumsyville, could fall over right in front of him. He walks gracefully over to meet me.
Happy to talk these through anytime.
“Ehhh you’re so soppy. My slytherin blood can’t take it.” He huffs at me but I can tell he’s joking and I know he loves it when I’m soppy. I change the subject anyway.
This chapter happens a couple of weeks before the first chapter.
I do own a broom….
“Are you calling me fat!” He backhandedly slapped my arm.
Soon though, my hot thoughts turn to something else. Does he want me though? He hasn’t made a pass at me. He wouldn't kiss me last week. I don’t even know for certain that he likes guys. I don’t know what his game is, or what he’s thinking.
“Okay, I’ll think about it.” She says and then picks her wand up for another go at the charm.
“Ermm, I have other customers.” She said and looked round at the two other tables that were occupied.
The next morning we are getting ready for our appointment which is at 11:15. We only have half an hour and Draco’s only just got out of the shower.
He stares at me, surprised.
“What do you want to know?” he asks, and raising his hand runs his fingers gently downy cheek to my chin, tilting my head back so he can look directly into my eyes. I squirm inwardly. I cannot lie to this man.
“The phone call, mostly. Being sick. The list goes on.” I chuckle dryly. Please can I die now?
And I immediately know who the parcel is from.
“Yes and yes. Thank you, I’m feeling much better.”
“What are your plans for the next few days?” He asks, voice low.
“Same.” I close my eyes and lean my head back.
I turn and hug her.
“What do you want to do first Teddy?” Draco asks. He’s holding Teddy’s hand and I’m pushing Leo in the pram. Teddys hair is the same blonde as Draco’s and Leo’s at the moment, while we are around muggles. At first he couldn’t decide between blonde or black but he went with blonde because he loves his new cousin so much. His words.
“She’d had enough time.” He sneers at me and turns back around.
“Harry….” he says breathlessly.
“I love you Harry.” He all but whispers. If I wasn’t so close to him, I wouldn’t have heard him.
“Yes, it is a simple butternut squash soup with chilli and crème fraîche.” I continue to stare and he smirks. “It’s nothing, I just wanted to cook for you.” He looks down now and blushes slightly.
“Errr…” he mumbles something incoherent and carries on eating.
“It’s okay Neville, and thanks. He’s just self conscious at the moment.”
Andy glances at me and gives me a funny look that I haven’t seen before. So I glance at Draco and he just smiles. He’s a lot better at telling lies than me, I tend to get fidgety and sweat a bit.
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
“Deal.” He says and goes to get his coat.
In control
“Thank you for tea Molly. Goodbye everyone.” And leaves just as Ron did, shouting Malfoy manor.
Today is Draco’s birthday, but he hates celebrating it and wont let me tell anyone else when it is. He told me not to get him anything but of course I ignored him like every year and I’ve gotten him a silver dragon on a chain. On the back I’ve engraved ‘I love you my dragon’. We are going to have dinner with his mother later and then we are coming back and I’m making him a bath with rose petals and lavender bath salts.
I couldn’t have been asleep long when I felt a warm body curl up next to me and a blanket placed on top of me. I squinted my eyes open as much as I could with how tired I was. And there he was, my Draco. This must be a dream.
The Submissive will keep himself clean and shaved and/or waxed at all times. The Submissive will visit a beauty salon of the Dominant’s choosing at times to be decided by the Dominant and undergo whatever treatments the Dominant sees fit.
“No Draco. By the sounds of all your symptoms, the...cherry?...is okay. So just lie down on the bed and let me check.” Katie says calmly.
“Draco, please.” He whispers in my ear and is pulling me closer.
“What are you sorry for, Draco?”
“Did I hurt you?” Harry asks as he lies down beside me propped on one elbow. He tucks a stray strand of my hair behind my ear. And I have to grin, widely.
“Wednesday.” I agree. “I’ll see you out. If you give me a minute.” I sit up and grab my t-shirt, pushing him out of the way. Reluctantly, he gets up off the bed.
“We are all ready to eat thank you.” The house elf bows low and with a click of her fingers the food is in front of us.
“He’s complicated, Pans. You know - he inhabits a very different world to mine.” Great excuse. Believable, too. Much better than: He’s got a Red Room of Pain, and he wants to make me his sex slave.
I call Pansy. When she doesn't answer, I leave her a groveling message to tell her I am alive and have not succumbed to Bluebeard, well, not in the sense she would be worried about - or perhaps I have. Oh, this is so confusing. I have to try to analyse and categorise my feelings for Harry Potter. It’s an impossible task. I shake my head in defeat. I need some alone time, away from here to think.
I notice now that he’s wearing PJ pants. He runs his fingers through his hair and stands. His pants hang from his hips, in that way….holy hell. My mouth goes dry as he casually strolls around the piano towards me. He has broad shoulders, narrow hips, and his abdominal muscles ripple as he walks. He really is stunning.
Oh no. I remember now. Those two were dancing and Pansy was all over him. And Harry's brother no less! What is she going to think of me being here? I’ve never stayed out before. And she’s still with Theo. She picks up guys in pubs and clubs all the time but hardly tries her best like she was doing last night. She’s going to think I’ve had a one night stand too.
“Pans, please.”
“Explains your food issues to me.”
“Ermm… I’ll have tea please, bag left out.”
“Yes.” I answer cautiously.

“You alright Draco?” Katie asks, looking a bit concerned herself now. She goes to do a spell and Draco jumps up.
“Oh Harry! He’s got your eyes.” Narcissa says suddenly, he must have opened his eyes looking for the cause of the noise. I chuckle at her.
“Fly? Why not just apparate? Or floo? Flying takes hours, trust me I’ve done it.”
“Can I eat my sandwich now?” Draco asks, ruining the moment. Me and Nia just chuckle at him, and she hands him the sandwich.
“Who?”
Great! The bloody estate agency was shut now. What was that woman's name again? Did she give me her number? No, I don’t think she did. Shit! I don’t understand why he’s so mad with me. I was so excited for this. I’d thought he’d like it. Maybe he doesn’t want more for us, maybe this is as far as he wants to go. Maybe he doesn’t even love me anymore. I have to get out of here, but where to go. Ha Rons of course.
Draco Malfoy
“Hey.” He sees me and calls a time out. When he comes over, he is out of breath and bends over.
He puts the phone back in his pocket and I stare at him.
“Please. This will only take a minute.” He insists. She nods and takes a seat next to me and opposite Draco.
“I love you Draco.” I need to tell him this right now for some reason.
“Is this
“Well it was mortifying and I’m glad I never have to see him again.”
We start walking then and don’t get very far before his phone rings again. Holy shit! Is this his life - constant nagging phone calls and messages?
“Merlin, I want you.” Something flies over to him and he catches it. Then his finger is back at my entrance but it’s cold and wet. He pushes in the tiniest bit and I whimper. He pushes it in and out slowly until his whole finger is in and I groan. With his other hand, he reached for my cock and starts stroking it back to life.
“Yeah, kind of.”
There are other pieces of furniture and things I don’t quite understand scattered throughout the room, but what dominates the room is the bed. It is bigger than a King sized, an ornately carved rococo four-poster with a flat top. It looks like a Hogwarts bed but much larger….and more leather. It had no bedding, just a mattress covered in red leather and red satin cushions piled at one end. There were more chains and cuffs attached to the bed.
He smiles slightly.
The waiter leaves hastily.
“Well you could have text, or called, or bloody owled.” I was too drunk for this conversation, “stay here, i'll be back in a minute.” I signed and I stumbled past him and up the stairs to the bathroom. I took a sobering potion, washed my face, brushed my teeth and put some more pants on as my others were clearly back downstairs and I was not going back down there without pants. As I came back downstairs, straightening my tie, I could see Draco was still in the doorway to the living room.
“Sounds good to me.” He smiles at me.
“Mr Potter, it’s Longbottom here. I have the information you require.” I hear a voice say. I don’t mean to listen in but it's silent where we are and the voice on the other side is quite loud.
“Excuse me.” Mr Potter rises again and exits.
“Nah she’s a hufflepuff and tonight will prove it. Also we have to celebrate angelina’s pregnancy!” Draco tells me.
“I’m sorry to interrupt Hermione, can i come in?”
“What’s that? Do you have one of the muggle Xbox’s in there or something?” I ask him. He laughs loudly at this and I feel embarrassed and blush.
Holy fuck, he’s not going to like my answer.
“Yes, most definitely.” I giggle. I love Pansy; she’s so loyal and supportive, sort of like a Gryffindor, but I love it.
“Is that normal? Or okay?” I ask just as Draco mumbles ‘lucky for you’. Thankfully Hermione doesn’t hear him.
“Well that is certainly helping! You're doing great! You’ll have graduated in no time.” I joke with her.
“I don’t really know Nia.” I tell her and look at Draco. “I think it’s time to get back in touch with McGonagall.” He groans but I know he knows I’m right.
Harry Potter
“Me too.” he whispers conspiratorially. My eyes shoot up to meet his.
Harry Potter
“Now here’s your pictures and I can get a recording of the heartbeat put into a teddy for you?” We both nod and she goes to get a teddy. Draco gets up and we both get our coats on.
“She’s 3 months/12 weeks.”
My heart sinks, and now I don't because I can guess.
He runs his hand through his unruly hair and I imagine doing it myself. That was a thought totally out of my control and my face flames. I bite my lip and look down at the table.
“I hope it's sooner.” Draco mutters.
How can he seduce me solely with his voice? I’m panting already - my heated blood rushing through my veins, my nerves tingling.
Second to last chapter! Enjoy! X
“A pub in Scotland.”
“We can’t eat money, Mr Malfoy, and there are too many on this planet that don’t have enough to eat.”
He steps back, and suddenly Sev’s returned, and the volume in the marquee gradually rises and fills my ears. We are not alone.
“Harry…” he nudges me again.
Oh...this is news.
“No, Draco, I’m not. I am monogamous in my relationships.”
“Oh, you know. The usual. The classics. British literature mainly.”
“Good. Now, how have you been doing since I saw you Draco?”
Hope you enjoyed. Next chapter gets steamy ;) x
He points his long boney finger to an icon on the scream and continues to huff out instructions to me, but it’s like white noise. I haven’t got a clue what he’s saying, and in all honesty, I’m not interested.
Harry Potter
“I know, but would it be okay if I nipped over there today? Will you be okay on your own?” I ask him and he stops folding the laundry we are doing.
“Congrats Draco! God this is weird.” Draco looks terrified and isn’t saying anything.
“Afraid I would have taken advantage of you Potter.” Draco teased while going through to the living room.
“Yes.” I say, short and clipped.
“I love you too Harry. And so does baby Leo.” I pull out of the hug and kiss Draco’s massive belly.
“Yes.”
When it got to 10 past 5 I started getting nervous, jiggling my leg, pulling a bit of cotton on the chair, and going through every possible scenario in my head. What if he didn’t like our first date, what if he didn’t like me. It's so like a Slytherin to not show up. Should I call him, should I go over to his? No I can't do that, I'll just wait for him. He must be stuck at work or something.
We worked together to get the floor fixed first. It was more difficult than we thought it would be and hence took longer than expecting. By the time we had finished it was almost lunch time, which meant it was nearly time to talk to Nia.
“How did you become this way?”
“You’re very quiet.” Harry whispers.
“Me, too. Men.” she says in mock disgust, possible forgetting that I too am a man. I roll my eyes internally. “They’re animals.” We both laugh.
4: As you are aware, you are my only sexual partner. I don’t take drugs, and I’ve not had any muggle blood transfusions. I’m probably safe. What about you?
“Yes. what you won’t do, what I won’t do, we need to specify in our agreement.”
Draco Malfoy
“Thank you Nia, this is a big help.” He says and she smiles widely.
Forty-five minutes later, we pause our packing for the house speciality, my lasagne. Pansy opens a bottle of wine, and we sit among the boxes eating, quaffing cheap red wine, and watching crap TV. This is normality. It’s so grounding and welcome after the last forty-eight hours of….madness. I eat my first unhurried, no-nagging, peaceful meal in that time. What is it about him and food? Pansy floats the dishes away and I finish packing up the living room. We are left with the sofa, the TV, and the dining table. What more could we need? Just the kitchen and our bedrooms left to pack up, and we have the rest of the week.
“It’s fine, at least she knows now.” He says and gets up.
I quail at the thought. I haven't signed that contract yet. Perhaps I won’t. Perhaps I’ll stay in France where he can’t reach me.
“What are you doing in London? Are you with him?”
“I’ll help you dear.” She says. As we are leaving I hear Draco ask where the baby is.
“Come.” Taking my hand in his, he leads me back to the car. This contact, flesh on flesh, it’s what is so unexpected from him, normal, intimate. I can’t reconcile this ordinary, tender gesture with what he wants to do in that room…..the Red Room of Pain.
“Why’s he sent you a laptop? You know you can use mine.” She frowns.
For the first time in my life, I voluntarily go for a run. I find my hideous, never-used trainers, some jogging bottoms, and a t-shirt, I put my hair up in a messy man bun, and I plug in my iPod. I can't sit in front of that marvel of muggle technology and look at or read any more disturbing material. I need to expend some of this excess, enervating energy. Quite frankly, I have a mind to run to the hotel Harry is staying at and just demand sex from the control freak. But that’s miles away, and I don’t think I’ll be able to even run one mile, and of course, he might turn me down, which would be beyond humiliating.
“Blaise, no, please.” My plea is lost as I stop breathing. You’re my friend and I don’t want this. I’m going to throw up.
“Ready?” Harry asks as we stand by the double doors to the foyer.
Enjoy X
“Why are you stopping?” I gasp.
“Thanks Hermione.” I crashed down onto their red comfy sofa, which always reminded me of the Gryffindor common room. “I think me and Draco are going to break up soon.” I blurted out, not being about to hold it in any longer.
We finish at 1 and I scourgify all of us clean of paint. Draco came down about half an hour ago and started helping. I help him up and take him and Teddy back to grimmauld to get changed.
I finish making his sandwich and hand it to him.
“Can we tell people next week?” Draco asks.
“You’d be willing to do a photo shoot?” My voice goes high again and I blush. Pansy will love me forever if I can pull this off for her. And I’ll be able to see him again tomorrow.  I dismiss that thought, it’s ridiculous.
As I’m heading out of London I still feel embarrassed and confused. I think about the answers that Mr Potter gave and how cryptic they were. It always seemed like there was something left unsaid - some hidden agenda. I’m still cursing Pansy for not giving me a brief biography. And those questions about adoption and whether he was gay! I shudder, remembering but I’ll deal with her when I get back. If I ever see him again I think I may die of embarrassment. Damn Pansy Parkinson!
“You. Since you bought it.” He reminds me and smirks. I splash water at him and regret it straight away. With more strength than I would think he had at 38 weeks pregnant, he grabbed my legs and pulled me in.
“I’m not sure that’s a good idea.”
“Like the constellation.” He raises his eyebrow and continues to stare at me.
Harry Potter
I follow him up to the first floor and into his study. It’s a spacious room with another big window. He sits at his desk, motions for me to sit on a leather chair in front of him, and hands me a piece of paper.
“Your situation. Draco, I’m going to make love to you, now.”
After about 10 minutes of Draco and Hermione talking, I interrupt.
“Good luck mate.” Ron whispers and sits back down next to Hermione and gives her the plate of food.
“Well why are you upset then?” I get down on one knee and hold his hands. “Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?” He starts crying more then but happy tears. Then finally nods his head.
“Sorry to keep you waiting Andy.”
“What for?” He asks, coming up the stairs slowly.
“Draco calm down, breathe, and tell me what you're talking about.” He takes a deep breath and then just as he’s about to say something, the door opens and in walks Katie Bell. Ohhhh, shit! It didn’t click when the nurse had said mediwitch Bell but here she was, Katie Bell. The same Katie Bell who Draco had nearly killed in his attempts to get a cursed necklace to Dumbledore.
I tell her everything then, how Draco’s been ill and what he said before we went to st mungos, how Katie was there. Then I told her what i had said and how idiotic I had been, and how draco had just left and not spoke to me since.
“Who’s with you?”
“Hi.” I smile at both of them on my return.
“Not everyone has an ulterior motive oh great slytherin.” Draco snorts and gets up.
A few hours later I step through his floo.
“Bring your wine.” he murmurs.
“Look...I’d better go. I really need to study.”
“Firstly, if you don’t want your wand tracked, then put a charm on it.” He snaps back at me and I shrink a little bit. “And secondly, if I hadn’t of been there, then you probably would have been waking up in the photographer's bed. And from what I remember, you weren’t entirely thrilled by his advances.” He is glaring at me furiously. And for some reason I burst out laughing.
“Yeah I’m fine now. It wasn’t much this time, probably because I didn’t eat much yesterday. Is breakfast done? I'm starving.” He says it so casually that I’m shocked. I don’t know what to say so I just point at the bedroom. He walks past me and says a quick thanks. I’m stood there for a minute longer thinking about what he just said and then I slowly walk back to the bedroom. Standing at the door I’m watching Draco tuck into his breakfast. Its like nothing just happened and he wasn’t sick. What the hell is wrong with him.
“I’m fine ‘mione. I'll be out in a second.” I don’t even know how long I’ve been standing here. I turn the water off and start to dry myself but I don’t even have the energy for that so it takes me some time to dry and dress.
The food is lovely as always and we all have a chat and laugh, mainly at Draco, but it’s all fun.
“It’s cooler now, don’t you have a jacket?”
Draco’s turns around then, noticing my absence.
“What?! Don’t you like it?! Did you think it was something else?” I ask him while getting onto my knees.
“10 weeks actually.” He says and I look at him.
“Yes it is.” I say to him.
“So how's this going to work?” Katie asks us when Draco is lying down.
“Happy birthday little cub.” I kiss the top of his head and stand back up.
After all the present we have a collection of nappies and vests and items of clothing. We have a pregnancy pillow for Draco. Some gift vouchers. Some reusable nappies and a baby wrap from Luna. Also a small mountain of teddies, including a niffler and another dragon. A couple of parenting books. A snitch mobile for the cot. And a cute keepsake book.
Just as I see Teddy, Nia comes through the floo carrying another box.
Enjoy. X
“Last time I checked, you didn’t play professionally Potter.”
“Why are you inviting him here?” I ask her and hand Teddy over.
“Listen to me Draco. Harry is good under pressure. He was brilliant when I was in labour. He did everything right and didn’t panic. Both of you are going to be brilliant dads. It may be hard at times but you’ll all be there for each other, I just know it.” I smile at that and then make myself known.
Teddy is playing with little lucy, who turned one last month, and Freddie and Molly II. While Bills kids, victoire, Dominique and Louis, are all playing together with Hermione. She has done the patronus charm and her otter is chasing them around. Nia is talking with Angelina and fluer, while Percy and Audrey are talking to molly and Arthur. Narcissa and Andy are standing off together watching Teddy playing. Bill, George, and Ron are setting up more fireworks. And me and Draco are sitting at the table, cuddled up together, watching everyone.
“A witch?! No I’m not. But yes I’m living in the old barn, I’m sorry. I've got nowhere else to go.” She was almost in tears now and still struggling in her seat. Me and Draco look at one another confused.
“We run an excellent internship program here.” He says this quietly and if I knew better I’d say nervously. My eyebrows shut up in surprise. Is he offering me a job?
he’s coming over now. I have to get one thing ready for him - the first edition Thomas Hardy books are still on the shelves in the living room. I cannot keep them. I wrap them in brown paper, and I scrawl on the wrapping a first quote from Tess from the book:
Am I submissive? Maybe I come across that way. Maybe I misled him in the interview. I’m shy, yes….but submissive? I let Pansy bully me - is that the same? And those soft limits, jeez. My mind boggles, but I’m reassured that they are up for discussion.
“Definitely.” I say while looking at him. He’s flushed and clearly wants this so why is he holding back. “Don’t you?” I stop moving for a minute to try and get an answer.
“It can’t have been that bad.” She laughs at me. “Anyway, he sounds quite taken with you, so maybe he is gay.” I roll my eyes at her even though she can’t see me, then proceed to make my cup of tea.
We are getting lower and lower and my anxiety is getting bigger and bigger. Merlin, I hope I don’t let him down. I can see the street we are heading for now and I squeeze hold of Harry. I hope this death trap doesn’t collapse and kill us both just as we get there. I can do this. I can do this. I keep chanting in my head and take a deep breath. Then we are landing. It’s slightly bumpy but we soon come to a stop and I release the breath I was holding. My heart is in my mouth and I can't decide if it’s from nervous anticipation, relief that we’ve arrived alive, or fear that I will fail in some way.
“I like my tea black and strong.” I mutter.
“I see.” My voice is tight. “So you have someone you can discuss your alternative lifestyle with, but I’m not allowed.”
“Yep, all sorted. I’m meeting Hermione in 10 minutes and then I’ll go get things ready for tomorrow.” He says walking by our side.
“Why haven't you emailed me? Or text me back?” He glares. I’m nonplussed.
“Nothing, Pansy.”
“Thank you but my mother is expecting me. Harry is free though.” Draco says. He still hasn’t been to the burrow once. Molly has invited him a hundred times but he always makes an excuse.
“What the hell is wrong with you today?!” I whisper in his ear and walk away.
“You did….I can tell.”
“The estate agency was shut, I’ll go in the-“ he cut me off with a delicate kiss and pushes me back down.
“Yes….overuse.”
“Yeah I’ll be there.” I eye Draco up and then turn and say goodbye to Ron and Hermione. Then I get down low and glare at crookshanks in his carrier.
When we have done, I go to check on Draco. He’s awake when I go in and he smiles sleepily at me.
And then there’s the Red Room of Pain. I rub my wrists reflexively - thin strips of plastic will do that to a guy. She taught him all that, too, or ruined him, depending on one’s point of view. Or perhaps he would have found his way there in spite of Mrs R. I realise, in that moment, that I hate her. I hope that I never meet her because I will not be responsible for my actions if I do. I can’t remember ever feeling this passionately about anyone, especially someone I’ve never met. Gazing unseeing out the window, I nurse my irrational anger and jealousy.
I notice the time and realise I should be studying instead of daydreaming.
“Oh ha ha. No, I don’t want your help. It's too dangerous and for your information I like to take my time to make sure I don’t miss anything. Like you missed that smudge over there.” I point at one of the windows but he didn’t fall for it and just glares me down.
“I’ll need to go home tonight - I need clean clothes.”
and this does strange delicious things to my insides. Not one of his fifteen, not Pansy in her little bikinis, not evil Mrs Robinson. Me. This beautiful man wants me. He stops kissing me, and opening my eyes, I find him gazing down at me.
“I think you’re toying with me, Mr Malfoy.”
I put my free hand on his shoulder and grin up at him, caught in his infectious, playful mood. He sways once, then we’re off. Boy, can he dance. We cover the floor, from the window to the bookcase and back again, whirling and turning in time to the music. And he makes it so effortless for me to follow.
“You obviously enjoy this.” I murmur.
I feel like going back to sleep, I am so tired, but instead think about everything he just said. If you were mine. But I’m not his because he made it clear he doesn’t want me. What I would do to be his though? He is the first guy to ever set my blood racing. But he is so antagonising; he is difficult, complicated, and confusing. One minute he basically tells me to leave him alone, next minute he is sending me ridiculously expensive first edition books and tracking me like a stalker! But without him I don’t know what would have happened last night, and despite him, I feel safe and protected. He cares enough about me to come and rescue me from some mistakenly perceived danger. I don’t know why he said he’s a dark knight, he is most definitely not. He is a white knight in shining armour — like in the classic romances, Sir Gawain or Sir Lancelot.
“Yes, I just want to get the nursery started.” A few people laugh at that and Neville nods along.
“No, Mother.” I am so not going there right now.
“I ain’t the ssstrange one, you are.” There, I told him.
“Why are you?” I return. We both stare at each other after I’m sat and then Andy sighs.
“Being a dork?” He looked up through his lashes and smirked. Then the song changed to a slow one and I pulled him closer. We both still had our paint brushes in our hands and paint on our clothes but neither of us seemed to care at this moment. After a couple of minutes of listening and swaying together, the song changed again to a faster one. Draco pulled me in for a kiss and whispered in my ear.
I switch off. How can he intimidate me when he’s miles away? I shake my head. My heart still heavy, I climb into bed and fall instantly into a deep but troubled sleep.
They seem okay. Harry is enjoying some private joke, and Sev looks unbelievably relaxed given he’s in a social situation.
“Oh, baby.” he murmurs, and strokes a finger down my cock, over my balls, and down to my entrance.
“He is not a good boy!”
We get to the elevator and wait for it. I look up at him and he looks at me through the corner of his eyes. This makes me smile and his lips twitch.
“I thought she might.” He laughs.
“It was horrid, and awful, and gruesome.” I said while smirking and shaking my head.
“Okay. If that’s the way you want to play it, Mr Malfoy.”
“All of them Harry! Me and Ron asked everyone we knew. We asked George and Angelina, we asked Neville, Luna, Ginny, my parents, Ron's parents, we even asked dean. They were either busy, allergic to cats, or just wouldn't put up with him.”
“Well I’ve been okay I guess.” He shrugs. I guess he’s still nervous around Katie.
“I want you to do four.”
“Thank you Nia. I’m going to take Draco to grimmauld now.” She nods and goes to leave. Then Draco frowns and looks at me.
“Fine speech you gave, Mr Potter.”
“If they want to keep their jobs they do.” He chuckles slightly and my heart skips a beat.
He’s just looking for a new toy - a convenient new toy that he can bed and do unspeakable things to. My heart tightens painfully. This is the reality.
Draco Malfoy
I frown at her and take his card out of my pocket. I take a breath and, with shaking hands, call his number.
“Then you
I blush. I’d forgotten my missing boxers. Fortunately, Weasley has climbed out of the car and is opening my door so he can’t hear our exchange. I scowl at Harry, who grins broadly as I turn and climb out of the car.
“It’s so good!” The twins say together.
“She interviewed me for the Hogwarts student Newspaper.”
“I’ve never brought anyone else up here, Draco. It’s another first for me.” His voice is quiet and serious.
“You think?”
It’s fine, I’m fine. I’ll get over it soon enough. Tomorrow is about Ron and I should have been the one taking him out all week, but as usual it’s all about me. Merlin, I’m a shit friend.
“That’s great! I hope you get it! What about the pub though?” I ask Hannah.
“Teddy cry’s all the time, he doesn’t even know me. He’s a baby.” She takes the quilt off my head and makes me turn around. We are both crying and I can tell she’s worried but I just don’t care right now. I know that’s a bad thing but I don’t care.
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
“Well I just thought with names like Draco and Andromeda, it would be a bit harder to pronounce.” She says back to Draco.
Harry glares at me.
“Mr Potter,” Sev murmurs, his expression indecipherable except perhaps for the slight widening of his big black eyes. They slide over to my face with a when-were-you-going-to-give-me-this-news look. I bite my lip.
“Does your family know about your….erm, predilection?”
I wrap the duvet around me and quietly pad down the stairs and towards the living room. Harry is at the piano, completely lost in the melody he’s playing. His expression is sad and forlorn, like the music. His playing is stunning. Leaning against the wall at the entrance, I listen, enraptured. He’s such an accomplished musician. He sits naked, his body bathed in warm light cast by a solitary freestanding lamp besides the piano. With the rest of the large room in darkness, it’s like he’s in his own isolated little pool of light, untouchable….lonely, in a bubble.
We get to the front door, that still needs fixing properly, and see that Nia has written on the back on the note I left her. It says ‘meet you here at 4.’ I’m glad she was okay and is willing to speak to us.
“Hello, Theo. You’re on speaker phone and I’m not alone.” Harry sighs and there may be a slight blush on his cheeks but that could be from the wind.
“Of course.” I laugh, which they both join in with.
After arguing with myself for a bit longer, I find myself at the front door ready to apparate. Okay let’s do this.
“No!” They both blurted. To which Ron added “and who’s Sherlock?” I rolled my eyes and recounted the night for them, leaving certain things out. By the end of it they were both smiling and so was I. I realised I couldn’t wait for the next date.
“Draco, it sounds lovely. Whatever you want love. We can decide when the time comes yeah?”
‘Hey! How’s it going?” He asks us.
His burning sincerity, his longing, is reflected in his eyes. This is fundamentally what I don't grasp. Why me? Why not one of the fifteen? Oh no….will that be me - a number? Sixteen of many?
“Wait! Can I say something to everyone before anyone leaves?” He asks while also getting up.
Harry Potter
“Might want to go keep your pregnant fiancé company mate.” I shout back over my shoulder to Ron.
“But we are always arguing.” He says with tears falling down his face.
“I want to know about you. I think that's only fair.” He looks alight with curiosity. Shit. Where’s he going with this? He sits back and puts his finger on his mouth once more. That’s so distracting…. I swallow.
“Yeah I know. I was actually thinking of asking her if I could teach Nia. What do you think?”
Harry’s going to give a speech. McGonagall touches briefly on Harry's achievements: CEO of his own extraordinarily successful company both in the wizarding world and muggle, a real self-made man.
“Only certain things are funny, Draco. I thought you were saying no, no discussion at all.” His voice drops.
“Oh...please.” I beg.
“Hmmm, I don’t actually know…” I look up to Draco to see if he has the answer but he just shrugs, “I’ll ask the healers.” I wink at him and get up. “Now who wants a piggyback?”
“Well, darling, I’ll be thinking of you on Thursday. I love you…..you know that, honey?”
“It’s a pleasure as always, Mr Malfoy,” he says politely, though he looks deep in thought, completely distracted.
“Pretty much what you did, though we had dinner first.” She grins at me. “Are you okay really? You look kind of overwhelmed.”
“Right, get down here now. I am not getting stabbed by a looney muggle while you're up there messing about.” He may be using humour but i could tell he was a bit freaked out. I stepped back and must have caught my foot because a sheet moved and revealed a few twigs. I bent down and took the sheet off altogether, and there underneath was a broom, an old looking one but still a broom. Maybe it wasn’t a muggle living here. I really needed to get back to Draco, and fast. Just as I was turning to leave, I saw a little glint of silver. When I looked over I saw a name on a tag. Just one name and a familiar one. Nia.
Please note the date of origin: 1580-90. I would respectfully remind Sir that this is the twenty-first century. We have come a long way since then.
Just then, he jumps down off me and looks at me with wide horrified eyes. He opens his mouth but instead of saying anything he abruptly turns around, grabs his broom off the floor and apparates out.
“Hello Harry. How are you? How’s little Leo here?” Hermione asks and kisses his cheek.
My initial feeling is one of relief. He’s willing to discuss my issues at least, and he still wants to meet tomorrow. After some thought, I reply.
“Oh no. If you spill the wine, I will punish you, Mr Malfoy.”
“Yeah we did.” I slurred and pointed at the clock, “over an hour ago, I didn’t think you were coming.”
“I’m really not hungry.” I whisper.
“Don’t speak to her like that! She didn’t know it was a secret!” Ginny stands up to defend Luna.
“You would have gotten a lot more out of him, I didn’t know what I was doing.”
Working for a living
8: I can terminate at any time if I don't think you’re sticking to the agreed limits. Okay - I like this.
I open my mouth and then close it again, twice. The joke is on me. Never in this or any alternative universe did I expect him to drop everything and turn up here.
I finally made it to the estate agent and Hermione had already rang and told them I was on my way to put a deposit down. I was so excited and confident in Hermione that I nearly didn’t even look at pictures. But when she pulled them out of the wallet I was nearly bouncing with excitement and happiness. I could really see us living here, all of us as a family.
Just then, the floo roared to life and Ron popped his head through.
I do as he asks, and he binds my wrists together with his tie, knotting it firmly. His eyes are bright with excitement. He tugs at the binding. It’s secure. What now? My pulse has gone through the roof, my heart beating a frantic rhythm. He runs his fingers down the side of my face.
“Potter?” Her eyes are wide with disbelief.
“No but it still leaves marks if I don’t do it by hand.” I stand up and go to get a cloth to start cleaning the wine marks off the tiles.
“You’re not dying. You’re fine. I’m here now.” I say shhhing him.
“It wasn’t my birthday before.” I shrug and chuckle. Teddy giggles next to me and then climbs onto my shoulders. Then he starts singing happy birthday loudly.
“Sit.” He points to one of the chairs, and I obey his command. If I’m going to do this, I'm going to have to get used to it. I realise he’s been this bossy since I met him.
Pansy is at the table when I walk in, with her laptop open and music blaring. It’s how she concentrates. She looks up and her welcome smile falls.
I’d like another A.
“France?” he murmurs.
Other names for us included: Sirius, Scorpios, Jamie, Oliver, Orion, and Perseus. Ginny was just trying for weird constellation names so therefore lucked out.
“Of course I’m coming stupid.” He snorts at me and pulls me towards the door. Then speaks in french to me. “C’est notre coeur et notre maison.” I don’t know what he’s saying but he sounds sexy saying it. Then off we go together holding hands.
“Teddy is going to be a great man someday.” I say gently with pride. Draco turns over and puts his arm over my chest.
“I’d give anything to know what you’re thinking right at this moment.” he murmurs. I blush further.
“Would anyone like to meet the baby?” I ask at the door. All eyes turn to us and go wide, then smiles appear. Draco rolls his eyes at my theatrics but he smiles too.
I blink at him. Holy shit…..we are going to go through each of these points one at a time. I just don't feel so brave face-to-face. He looks so earnest. I steel myself with another sip of my wine. Harry continues.
“Dray, I don't understand, you just let him make love to you?”
“Because I’m leaving now.”
1. Rebellious, disobedient.
Shit.
I head for the kettle. I need tea.
“Do you mind?” Ron goes over to Draco and offers him the baby. Draco looks shocked for about a second and holds his arms out without realising I think. As soon as the baby is in his arms though, he smiles and coos the baby.
“I’m sorry uncle Draco! I forgot!” Teddy is crying now and hugs into me where I’m holding him to my shoulder.
“Thanks Harry. By the way, can you tell me about this hat you want me to speak to?” Ohhh she means the sorting hat.
Inquiring minds
Harry is standing over me grasping his want which he has transfigured into a riding crop. He’s wearing old, faded, ripped jeans and that’s all. He flicks the crop slowly into his palm as he gazes down at me. He’s smiling, triumphant. I cannot move. I am naked and shackled, spread-eagle on a large four poster bed. Reaching forward, he trails the tip of the crop from my forehead down the length of my nose, so I can smell the leather and magic coming from it, and over my parted panting lips. He pushes the tip into my mouth so I can taste the smooth, rich leather.
“Hey Harry, where do you want these?” Ron asks before Hermione can start talking.
“Well today is all about you.” He tells him and pinches his cheeks to which Teddy giggles. “And maybe not everyone will be happy.”
“Yes,” I say quickly before Draco can have a go at the poor girl. “We’ve just bought a house a few miles out but it needs renovation before we move in.”
I look up and he is glaring at me. Have I offended him again? I carry on quickly.
“Oh Harry it was beautiful! The sea was so blue and the beaches so white. We went snorkelling and hiking and fruit picking and we saw some amazing things. We even saw some endangered magical beast’s that Luna had told us about. And we got to spend so much time together, it was amazing and so romantic wasn’t it Ron?” She looked at her boyfriend lovingly and he seemed to melt in her eyes.
HARD LIMITS
“Have you been offered any refreshments?” He asks, glancing at the table between us.
“Harrryyy.” He whines.
“Thanks Harry, anyway we must be going now. Be good crookshanks, see you both in 2 weeks.”
Draco Malfoy
“If you made it bigger, then probably. And some koi fish would be nice.” He smiles and puts his free hand on top of mine on the pram handle.
“Thank you.” He says to her and then smirks at me. He shows me what’s inside and I get why he smirked. It's a tiny silver bangle with a tiny snake running around it.
“Not if you really don't want to. You can make that a hard limit.”
“Really! Thank you so much Harry. This means so much.” I hug her back then.
“Not everyone has a beautiful soul like yours Teddy. Not everyone can see love like you. But as long as the people I love don’t care, then that’s all that matters to me. I don’t care what other people think because I have you.” I give him a big hug and kiss his head, while Tears drip down my face. “You are a sweet boy Ted, you make sure you always stay that way!” I wipe my face and give him a wicked grin. “You hear me? Eh?” Then start tickling him. He starts shrieking with laughter then and yelling ‘stop!’.
“Please Harry. I came to apologise, just hear me out.” I take a breath and stop trying to shut the door. He pushes it open. “Can I come in please? If you didn’t notice, I’m quite wet already.” I want to laugh but won’t give him the satisfaction, I’m still angry and hurt.
“Draco?” I say, catching up to him.
“How is Mr Malfoy? I was so glad to hear about you two, you were always staring at each other.” I go slightly red now and try not to groan and instead laugh nervously.
“Why can't I rub your belly?” I smirk at him and kiss him once.
I snap out of it and grab my towel.
“Oh yeah, it’s all about the money.” I smirk and both burst out in laughter.
“Will you dance with me?” I ask him and hold my hand out. To my utter surprise, he takes it.
Oh fuck...not the Pansy Parkinson inquisition. I shake my head at her in a way that says back off now. Of course, this is Pansy and I may as well be dealing with a blind, deaf and mute.
“What?” He looks up at me then and frowns.
Rules:
“So you do love him! Oh gosh Harry, that’s wonderful.” She says before I know what I’ve done. I smack my forehead with my hand and groan.
“I’ll make some tea.” Pansy scuttles off to the kitchen.
“No.” He frowns.
“Harry Potter! Don’t you dare ever say that to me again! I am not going to leave you here to… well I’m not going to leave you here. Now get up and get in that shower, you stink. Then get something to eat because you look skinnier than when you started at Hogwarts. Then you are coming downstairs and you are going to speak to the nice lady I brought with me.” She declares and gets up.
A few months into Harry and Draco’s relationship.
“I’m sorry.” He says in a small voice. I can tell he’s embarrassed by what happened.
“Let me examine you before i say anything for sure. Please lie down and lift your top over your stomach.” He looks at me so I nod and after he’s done that I take his hand and stand next to him. Katie comes over and waves her wand in front of his stomach and says a spell. Draco tenses up a bit at this, so I bring his hand to my mouth and kiss his knuckles. She lowers her wand and speaks quietly.
“Draco, are you okay? Your speech sounds funny.” Well no shit. He sounds concerned so I don’t say that out loud.
“Harry dear, I was calling you.”
“I love you so much.” I tell Draco and kiss his head, where it’s back resting on my shoulder.
“She said it's about 9 weeks old and about the size of a cherry right now.” He gave the tiniest giggle to that, only noticeable because I felt him laugh against me.
He leans forward.
He narrows his eyes.
“That I have called this place home since we bought it, but never managed to call grimmauld home. It was always that, ‘grimmauld’.”  I tell him. He swims slowly up to me, where my legs are in the water.
“How the hell is this guy doing it?” Ron thought out loud.
Pansy just melts. I have never in all my life seen her like this. The word ‘compliant’ comes to mind when looking at her. Complaint Pansy. Merlin, Theo must be good. Harry just rolls his eyes and looks down at me, expression unreadable mostly, although maybe mildly amused. He tucks a stray piece of hair that has come out of my bun behind my ear. My breath hitches at the touch and I lean into his hand. His eyes soften and he runs his thumb over my lower lip. My heart starts beating faster. Then, too quickly, his fingers are gone.
This time he doesn't stop at the knee, he continues up the inside of my thigh, pushing my thighs apart as he does. And I know what he’s going to do, and part of me wants to push him off because I’m mortified and embarrassed. Why is this any different from me giving him one?
Mr Potter,
Ginny and Luna were sat on the sofa the whole time and watched it unfold.
“Yes, thank you it was lovely.” She tells me how much and I pay her, then add some money to the tip jar.
I go back to my seat. Emails? He must have sent another. What did it say?
“Awww, I think your little belly is adorable.” Then she goes to touch it but Draco stops her by grabbing her wrist.
“You're like my white knight then.” I chuckle.
“It means I want you to willingly surrender yourself to me, in all things.” He says and I frown at him trying to assimilate the idea.
“I have a breakfast meeting tomorrow at the hotel. Besides, I told you, I don't sleep with girlfriends, boyfriends, slaves, subs, or anyone. Friday and Saturday were exceptions. It won’t happen again.” I can hear the resolve behind his soft, husky voice.
“Why?” He asks and I blink rapidly and blush. Concentrate, Malfoy.
“But what?” I sit up and look at him.
First we open our present from Molly and Arthur. There is a little blue knitted jumper on the top. Then some glass bottles for feeding, some baby grows, some sweets and chocolates, and a few knitted blankets. One green, one red, and one a mix of the two colours.
“Mr Snape, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” Harry says smoothly, warmly, completely unflustered by Pansy’s introduction. He holds out his hand, which Severus, all credit to him, takes, not showing a hint of the drop-dead surprise he’s just had thrust upon him.
As we finish our starters, Gretchen appears, and not for the first time, I wish I felt able to put my hands freely on Harry just to let her know - he may be fifty shades of fucked up, but he’s mine. She proceeds to top up drinks while the elves clear the table. She brushes up to Harry too closely for my liking. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to notice, but I am ready to blow.
“Let me know about tomorrow.” He pulls his wallet from his back pocket and takes a card out. It has his name, number, and floo network on it. “Call me via phone or floo, but before ten in the morning.”
I nod as nonchalantly as I can manage under his intense, amused scrutiny. His face splits into a huge grin, and he shakes his head.
“And that reminds me, why did you send me those books, Harry?” My voice is soft when I ask him and he soon puts down his cutlery and regards me intently. My mouth goes dry.
“Yeah he is, but he’s so happy. He’s just with Katie at the moment, I’ve got to take this little guy back in a minute.” I smile down at Leo and kiss his cheek.
“You have dreadful sex hair.”
Okay - I like him. Happy now, I’ve admitted it to myself. I cannot hide from my feelings anymore. I have never felt like this before. He is very, very attractive, but it’s a lost cause. I sigh with bittersweet regret, because him being here was just a coincidence. So, I’ll just admire him from afar, no harm done. And if tomorrow goes ahead, if I can find a photographer, then I can admire him in person. I bite my lip just thinking about it and then find myself grinning. I need to phone Pansy and Blaise and organise this photoshoot ASAP.
My name is Hermione Granger. I am best friends with your son. I was with him when he first found your graves on Christmas Eve 1997.
Harry Potter
“Hey,” I put my hand on his shoulder and unlike Nia, he doesn’t shake it off. “We have time to take Teddy to the flower park, if you're up for it?” He brightened noticeably at that, I know he loves coming to the park with us when he has a chance.
It’s 10 minutes before we have to leave and Draco is in absolute hysterics.
When she comes back I am just finishing my hair. I’ve not got enough energy to lift my hands for long though and she takes over. She is very gentle with me and massages my scalp.
“Are you going to kill me, like they probably killed my parents?” This was getting out of hand, we needed to get her out of here.
I glance around it, plotting an escape route. No - there’s still only the door or window. My room is functional and very slytherin. With dark wooden furniture, a big wooden four-poster bed with a canopy and a patchwork green quilt, my mother made me. The walls are covered in band posters, quidditch posters, and photos, muggle and wizard, everywhere. My desk chair is leather and the bed is covered with a variety of green pillows. There is also the bookcase which has a few plants on, adding to the green.
I go after Draco and find him in an empty waiting room with his head in his hands. His whole body is shaking from his crying. It may be silent but I can tell he is really upset. I sit down next to him and just hug him.
I pull my broom out of my pocket and unshrink it. Harry’s mouth drops open.
You’re welcome.
“Well, what do you want to do today?” I ask him, and I know what he's going to say because it’s what he always says.
“Why not?”
“Where did you meet Draco?” Luna asks him.
“Leo. Leo James Potter.” I say loud enough for everyone to hear.
“Be there in 5 Ron. Sorry.” He nods and retreats back into the chaos behind him and then he’s gone.
“The first thing we are going to do is guess the baby name. We obviously won't find this out until after the babies are born, but it’s fun and might give the parents some ideas.” He accios a white board over and a pen and then looks around. I see Draco discreetly turn his ring around so nobody can see the stars. “Who’s first?”  George asks everyone.
“It’s a picture…. of your new baby brother or sister!” He says and most the kids jump up. Some in protest but most in celebration.
“Not anymore. I won't be seeing him again.”
“Happy birthday.” I say seductively in his ear and mouth at his neck.
I nod, wide-eyed, my heart bouncing off my ribs, my blood thundering through my body.
Nia wanders off into the garden then and says she’s going for a walk. So me and Draco go into the kitchen and prepare tea. With everything sorted in here, we went shopping and stocked the cupboards and pantry. We even put a non-perishable spell on the food in the pantry as we stocked it like a bomb shelter.
“You have a very healthy baby, well done Draco.” She starts to redress him but Draco takes over.
“Yeah I agree.”
“I’m 10 weeks pregnant today.”
“All to be expected unfortunately. To go with that, from now on you may have sleeping problems and be more tired than you already are, you’ll get stretch marks, but you already seem to have a few of them so no need to worry, indigestion and heartburn, swollen feet, and also symptoms from early pregnancy may come back. Such as morning sickness, cravings, heightened sense of smell,and mood swings. So be prepared.” She winked at me then and continued to do spells on Draco and the baby.
“I didn’t want to wake you, but I’ve got an important delivery arriving at the shop and I need to sign for it. So i have to go.” He tries walking away again but I stop him.
At 4 o’clock I’m in bed with Draco. He’s between my legs and says he feels comfortable, so I've stayed like this for the last 2 hours. His contractions are getting closer now and I’ve started timing them on a stopwatch. He grabs my hand again and moans.
“Mr Potter.” I nod politely to him and walk closer to him. Weasley is stood to the side and I smile at him. “Hello, Weasley.” I say.
“Draco, I think he definitely likes you.” She says giddily. Blaise glazes at her with disapproval. “But I don’t trust him.” I put my hand up to stop her saying anything else, and by some miracle she stops talking.
“It’s alright, just breath.” I tell him and stroke his hair. When it’s over he leans his head against my hip. “Okay?” I ask. He nods and I get him back into bed.
“Oh, Draco, what shall I do to you?” he whispers as he lowers me onto the bed, lying beside me and raising my hands above my head.
“Good. Night.” He says and exhales.
“I’ll have what you’re having, please.” See! I can play nice and behave myself. Amused, he orders another glass of Sancerre and slides in opposite me.
Hermione comes over and sits next to Draco then. She places her hand on top of his and smiles.
Then there is another finger trying to gain access. I cry out and he squeezes my cock to distract me. He takes it slow and soon he has both fingers in and scissoring them to stretch me out. After a while I realise that there are three fingers in me and try to remember when that happened.
“Is cousin Draco poorly?” Teddy asks innocently.
Brought what over? What’s he up to now?
His eyes soften, and his lips turn up in a smile.
“Suck,” he commands, his voice soft. My mouth closes over the tip as I obey.
“whoa….Draco.” His eyes fly open, and I suck harder.
The interview is at 2 so I race down to see Mcgonagall and then get outside, get on the broom, and swiftly take flight.
“All these weeds need coming up.” I tell him and start tugging on one.
“My room is on the top floor, the next floor up. Come on, you must be hungry.”
“No way?! How old are you going to be?” I ask him just so he can tell us.
“Then why were you crying at the piano?” I ask him because he still hasn’t told me.
Harry shifts in his seat.
I stare at myself in the gigantic mirror above the sinks. Do I look different? I feel different. I feel a little sore, if I’m honest, and my muscles - jeez, it’s like I’ve never done any exercise in my life. You don't do any exercise in your life. I tell myself. So you’ve just slept with him, given him your virginity, a man who doesn't love you. In fact, he has very odd ideas about you, wants to make you some sort of kinky sex slave.
“I’ve got a bit of work to do on it yet.” I tell him, slightly embarrassed. I rub the back of my neck and look away. Neville slaps my back and laughs.
“Sit.” Harry commands, shocking me out of my worrying. He’s wearing a white linen shirt, collar and cuffs undone. He points at the table which I now realise has a LOT of food on it. I sit down opposite him and shit uncomfortably.
“Merlin.” He says still with shock on his face.
After telling Katie, she explains again when she will come.
We all turn and head into the living room. Luna has not let go of my hand. The room is spacious, tastefully furnished in creams, browns, and pale blues - comfortable, understated, and very stylish. Pansy and Theo are cuddled together on a sofa, clutching champagne flutes. Pansy bounces up to embrace me, and Luna finally releases my hand.
“And not touch you? No.”
“Still or sparkling?”
“Where’s the cat?” He asks me, although I know by the way he looks that he isn’t that bothered.
No acts involving urination or defecation and the products thereof.
“Yes of course, I Will try to come round more often. I apologise, I’m just so busy with the shop, but i'll try.” She smiles and just waves him off. In the meantime, Teddy has pounced on me with a hug goodbye.
“Hello baby, I’m Nia. You daddies are very nice people, so be good.” I chuckle and tell her his name. “Leo, we are going to be best buds. I’ll babysit you all the time.”
15.24     The Submissive will not touch the Dominant without his express permission to do so.
“Probably worse considering you are his daddy.” He smirks at me. I kiss him and then watch Rose for a bit.
“Well it better know me too, considering I’m the one that has to carry it around for 9 months.” We both laugh and I help him up then. “I think I want to know the gender.” He says and cringes, then quickly carries on. “I’m sorry and I know we said we didn’t but I’m sick of calling it an it. We don’t have to find out if you don’t want to, but it would be nice to paint the nursery a colour other than yellow.”
“Hi, Draco.” He smiles at me and his blue eyes twinkle. I like him already. He is obviously nothing like Harry, but then they are adopted brothers.
“That sounds very philanthropic. Is it something you feel passionate about? Feeding the world's poor?”
“Like… like what if we never get to meet the baby? What if the little cherry dies before their born? What if I do something to harm it? Or what if it’s born and then gets taken away from us?” Saying these things out loud has made him go worse again and he’s almost hysterical now. But now he’s said them, I’m thinking about them. What if we never get to hold our baby like we held Lucy. I can feel wetness on my cheeks and know I’m crying now too.
“He is an expert in potions and actually taught me.” I sigh.
“That’s better.” he murmurs, and smiles a wicked, knowing smile. He bends and starts undoing one of my sneakers. Oh no…..no….my feet. No. I’ve just been running.
“She knows you’re here and still alive. I text Theo.” He says with a slight smirk.
All of a sudden, Luna sits on Draco’s legs. She puts one hand on his belly and one hand on his head. He stares at her like she just escaped a looney bin.
“The tenacious Miss Parkinson. How do you do?” He gives her a small smile and looks amused. “I trust you are feeling better? Draco said you were unwell last week.”
“So you thought he’d reply by email.”
“Suppose I’ll have to now, thanks Molly.” He winks at her so she knows he’s joking and everyone laughs again.
Do you ever think you’ll be able to do what you’re told?
“It was, wasn’t it?” She beams. “Are you coming? He can be very insistent.” She rolls her eyes, and I grin.
“Absolutely.” I smile at him and kiss his hands. He smiles back.
May 24 00:02
“I've had too much to drink.” I try for a smile.
“Yes why do you have a problem with that?” He asked. And although he may have sounded confident I could see the tell tale signs of nervousness.
I remember what he said to me in that stern voice about flying carefully and I remember his intense green eyes almost warning me. And then I realise that I am flying more carefully than usual. I shake my head to rid the memory and lean forward to gain a bit more speed. Forget him, Draco! Although the experience was….interesting, I never want to see him again. I perk up a bit now and really start moving through the air. This is why I love flying, it's so freeing and I can go as fast as I damn well please.
“That’s fine.” He says carefully.
15.7    In training and in the administration of discipline the Dominant shall ensure that the discipline and the instruments used for the purposes of discipline are safe, shall not be used in such a way as to cause serious harm, and shall not in any way exceed the limits defined and detailed in this contract.
Sleep - I’ll agree to six hours.
We were there for another 2 hours, chatting and eating and laughing. Then we floo back to grimmauld.
“No potion. Didn’t know. Now he’s left me and won’t talk to me.” I continue to sob.
The doors open to our floor and he takes my hand, pulling me alongside him.
“I know but I don’t have pockets, plus I was coming to ask how the scan was.” She smiles at me but I take it further. Draco knows where this is going so takes a seat on the stairs. He won’t be able to get up from there without my help. His belly is huge now.
“Don’t be coy, Draco, show me.” he whispers.
“Okay, just a few questions and then I’ll examine you if that's okay.” Draco nods his head so she continues. “How long have you and Mr Potter been trying? And what potion are you taking?” At that me and Draco both look at each other confused.
“I’d like to do that again.” I whisper. For a moment, I think I see a fleeting look of relief on his face, before the shutters come down, and he gazes at me through hooded eyes.
“Come.” he murmurs.
She shoots awake when my phone goes off in my pocket. Unfortunately so does Lucy, but fortunately Audrey gets back at that minute and takes over.
“Owww! Harry, why did you do that!” Hermione complained.
He moves down my arms, then beneath them to my underarms, washing gently. His hands glide across my chest, and I inhale sharply as his fingers circle my nipples and tug on them. My body bows instinctively, pushing my chest against his hands. My nipples are tender. Very tender, no doubt from his less-than-delicate treatment of them last night. He doesn't linger long and glides his hands down to my stomach and belly. My breathing increases and my heart is racing. His growing erection presses against my arse. It’s such a turn-on knowing that it’s my body making him feel this way.
15.12    The Dominant will ensure that all equipment used for the purposes of training and discipline shall be maintained in a clean, hygienic, and safe state at all times.
Harry pulls me behind him, and I hesitate.
“Oh Katie, I almost forgot, is there somewhere private we can wait next time?”
“Certainly not. What does that have to do with anything.”
His mouth sets in a mulish line.
Oh shit! I’d forgotten that!
“You have a date with Harry Potter?” he says finally, once he’s over the shock. Disbelief is evident in his voice.
“You cooked, I’ll clear.”
“What’s this?” I ask him suspiciously.
“Thank you for the tea and the photo shoot.” I murmur.
“This is perfect!” I shouted down to Draco.
4 more chapter after this one! Enjoy! X
After helping me get dried and dressed, she helps me downstairs. I’m feeling a little better already. She sits me down at the kitchen table and slides a plate over to me. It has a sandwich on and some crisps and a chopped apple. I have to force it down but once I’m halfway through I start feeling how hungry I was. When I’m nearly finished Hermione offers me another sandwich, which I gratefully accept.
Pansy, of course, already has an internship set up at a big newspaper company. Her father knows someone who knows someone.
When we had finished, Nia came to collect our plates. But before she could pick anything up, Draco spoke.
“I told you, I have issues with waste food. Eat.” he snaps. His eyes are dark, pained.
“Yes. Please, Harry.” I beseech him.
"Rolf is Luna's one true love," he says with false puppy dog eyes and a hand to his heart.
We arrive at the house by apparation and it surprises me when Draco doesn’t throw up. We go into the house to find that Nia is finishing things up in the kitchen.
“Still with me?” he whispers, his voice rich, warm, and seductive. He takes a sip of his wine, his penetrating stare holding mine.
“Draco, you have your ring on!” She whispers and looks around to make sure nobody sees.
Flying...we are on a motorbike!
“Oh merlin, Pans!” I croak. That’s when Harry eventually looks up.
“I guess it’s all a little overwhelming.” I murmur.
“Draco!” He can clearly hear me but is stubbornly ignoring me. “Draco, wait please. Draco!” I catch up and attempt to grab his arm to turn him but he flings it out of my grip and turns with a look of murder.
“Stop, please.” I am stumbling behind him, unsteady as he pulls me.
“Bloody Merlin! Draco!” oh shit, it’s Blaise. He sounds desperate. “Where are you? I’ve been trying to contact you. I need to see you, to apologise for my behaviour on Friday. Why haven't you returned my calls?”
“Everything looks good Draco, but I’m a bit worried about your blood pressure. It’s lower than it should be. This is quite common and most of the time it will return back to normal. But it can be dangerous for you and the baby if you don’t listen.” Draco looks like he's not breathing and I’m not doing much better myself. “Some self-care things you can do are; avoid getting up too quickly, don’t stand for long periods, don’t take very hot baths or showers, drink lots of water, eat small meals throughout the day, and wear loose clothing if you can.” She takes a seat and shuffles some papers. She looks just as lost as us but she can handle it as she must do this everyday. “This might actually explain your dizziness and not the pregnancy. Other side effects are fainting, nausea, blurred vision, clammy or pale or cold skin, rapid or shallow breathing, and lack of concentration.”
She smiles, but her eyes crinkle at the corners with concern.
“It’s okay Teddy, we all make mistakes. Thank you for apologising, would you like to sit on the bed with me nicely?” Draco asks and pats the spot next to him. Teddy looks up from my shoulder and nods. I wipe his tears and snot and place him gently on the bed. Then I pull one of the chairs, from the corner, over to the bed and offer Andy the seat.
What a surprise. His black hair is tousled and sexy. He’s as beautiful as Pansy. The family resemblance is striking.
“Please….I have to.”
“Clause 2. Agreed. This is for the benefit of us both. I shall redraft.”
“Draco, you hate peanut butter.” I remind him.
I hang on to his hips as I’m tipped upside down, and he strides purposefully in the moonlight across the lawn.
“Don’t want the two of you to go into labour early, do I?” He says right back and we all laugh including Draco and Hermione.
When I got to work for the lunch shift, the place was quite busy. I groaned inwardly and started taking orders. Things started to calm down after a bit and I was able to discreetly read and eat my lunch at the same time, all while sitting behind the bar. Aberforth, my boss, doesn’t really care what I do as long as I serve the customers and clean the rooms at the correct times.
Draco Malfoy
“Just wait here a sec.” I tell them and go in, closing the door behind me.
4 o’clock come on quickly after that and people start arriving. Hermione and Ron get here first and give Nia some books, quills, and parchment as a present. Nia is beyond happy with that and thanks them.
Abruptly, I wake, gasping for breath, covered in sweat and feeling the aftershocks of my orgasm. Holy fuck. I’m completely disorientated.
The restaurant is small and intimate, a wooden chalet in the middle of a forest. The decor is rustic: random chairs and tables with gingham tablecloths, wild flowers in little vases. Cuisine savage, it boasts above the door.
“But harry, don’t you want me, in our brand new...lovely...house.” He struggled a bit with the ‘lovely’ but got it out in the end. It showed how much he didn’t want to see the rest of this house. I felt bad but this had to be done if he actually wanted a house in the end.
She lifts her eyebrow and I frown at her.
“Good boy.” he says proudly.
8    If at any time the Dominant should fail to keep up to the agreed terms, limitations, and safety procedures set out in this contract or agreed additionally under clause 3 above, the Submissive is entitled to terminate this contract forthwith and to leave the service of the Dominant without notice.
“Right, sorry, I keep forgetting.” She pulls her hand back and looks around.
“I’m really not hungry.” I whisper.
Yes. . . . . .
“No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.” I stare down at his rules. Waxing! Waxing what? Everything? Ugh. And no smoking!
“You made this?! You can cook?” I ask him totally gobsmacked. He dabs his mouth with a napkin while trying not to laugh.
“Well, we’ll have to see what we can do about that.” His voice is soft, challenging, a delicious sensual threat. He undoes the button of his jeans and slowly pulls them down, his eyes on mine the whole time. He leans down over me and, grasping each of my ankles, quickly jerks my legs apart and crawls onto the bed between my legs. He hovers over me. I am squirming with need.
“I’m so sorry Draco, I’m so sorry. Please don’t leave me.” I cry into his shoulder.
“And little cherry.” I remind him with a wet laugh and pull out the moving picture of our baby from the scan. The one I was going to give to Ron and Hermione. Draco takes it and kisses it and then kisses me and curls up tighter.
I got down the ladder as fast as I could and as soon as I felt Draco’s hand, I apparated us back to the house. We landed and I took a breath while Draco turned green and went to the nearest bush to throw up.
“She needs to push.” I tell her.
“He’s never brought anyone home before,” says Luna, silvery blue eyes bright with excitement.
All the blood drains from my face.
“She did.”
“For both of them! The muggle one and the wizarding one.”
“Nia this is absolutely amazing! Thank you so much.” I hug her tightly.
“Bed.” he orders again. I climb back into bed. He clambers in beside me and pulls me into his embrace, wrapping his arms around me so that I’m facing away from him. He kisses my hair gently, and he inhales deeply.
“Harry, if you don’t get this weirdo off me in 2 seconds, I swear to merlin..” before he can react though, Ginny has her girlfriend around the waist and is dragging her off.
“Do you still….erm….?” I flush.
“No, I’m staying in Scotland.”
“Yeah thank you so much Katie.” I tell her and take Draco’s hand as we are leaving the office.
“Anymore?” I ask him and he shakes his head.
“I don't have a computer. I usually use the ones at school. I’ll see if I can borrow Pansy’s laptop.”
“Goodnight Leo.” Then we both get changed and get in bed. Draco curls up against my side with his head on my shoulder.
“But I don’t really do people, Draco, more like places.” He groans.
“Perfect, more french.” I roll my eyes sarcastically and he punches my arm and laughs.
“No problem. Remember, if you need anything just call in.” We wave our thanks and head to the floo.
I’m going to see his parents, and I’m not wearing any underwear. In the relative safety of his house, it seems like a fun, teasing idea. Now, I’m almost outside with no boxers! He peers down at me, and it’s there, the charge building between us. The amused look disappears from his face and his expression clouds, his eyes dark….
Do the work!
“Of course you are.” I grab his cheeks and put my forehead against his. “But it’s not just that.”
When I come through Hermione is double over.
“You like that?” I can almost hear his smile.
Katie comes back with a dragon teddy.
12: I cannot commit every weekend. I do have a life, or will have. Perhaps three out of four?
“Oh, please.” I moan as he bites my little toe, the action resonating straight to my cock.
“Yep.” He says and pulls his top up. His belly is getting really big now, he doesn’t let me see it much nowadays.
“Yes…..good night, Blaise.” I shut the floo down, not waiting for a response, and cancel my spell.
“What house do you reckon Nia will be sorted into?” I ask him while it’s on my mind.
“And you decided that it was nice knowing me? Do you mean knowing me in the biblical sense?”
“No, we are not getting a dog.” He says it like it’s final but I’ll get through to him.
“I wanted to. You two have done so much for me so I just wanted to help out a bit.” She smiles at us and puts the paintbrush down. “Did everything go okay at the scan yesterday?”
“I take it you didn’t tell him yesterday?” I look at Hermione. She grins through her tears and shakes her head.
“What do you want to do with the ridiculously expensive first editions?” she asks.
“Dray, I did you a favour,” she calls after me.
“I need you fit and healthy, Draco.”
I finish with Nia and she gets on with the questions I set her. Then I take Andy and Teddy into the house. I take them to the nursery last.
“It’s nothing, it’s just hormones. I’m fine.” He says while trying and failing to stop crying.
“I don’t feel it.” I tell him, slightly upset.
I thought this was a negotiation?” I say and he purses his lips at me.
“Okay, i suppose i did promise.”
“Did you?” She’s fishing for information. I roll my eyes at the expectation in her voice.
“Yes.” Is all he says.
I want him, but on his terms? I just don't know. Perhaps I should negotiate what I want. Put those cunning slytherin skills to use. Go through the ridiculous contract line by line and say what is acceptable and what isn’t. My research has told me that legally it’s unenforceable. He must know that. I figure that it just sets up the parameters of the relationship. It illustrates what I can expect from him and what he expects from me - my total submission. Am I prepared to give him that? Am I even capable?
“Mr Harry Potter sir. How may I helps you sir?” It asks.
“I find it difficult to sleep, and I’m not used to sleeping with anyone.” he murmurs. I can’t fathom his mood. He seems a little despondent, but it’s difficult to tell in the darkness. Perhaps the tone of the piece he was playing. He puts his arm around me and gently walks me back to the bedroom.
I close my eyes, and drift into a heavy sleep with occasional dreams of a four-poster bed with shackles and intense green eyes.
He laughs. “Submissive R’ Us?” he says. I frown, not knowing what he is going on about.
“Hmm, don’t you mean a nest of broken things, and on top. That cat is king of any castle.” I agree and we both chuckle.
I go to get them and lead them upstairs, showing Molly things on the way up. She hasn’t seen the house complete yet.
“I will decide that.” She lifts the blanket and examines her again. “Okay, time to start pushing.” She takes the blanket off and puts a clean white sheet down instead. Then she put Hermione’s legs in the stirrups and sits in her little stool, with her wand and other instruments next to her on a tray. “Next contraction, push as hard as you can.” She tells her now.
“Mr Malfoy?”
“Are you ever going to tell me what that means? I could just look it up you know? But I’d rather you tell me.” He smirks and then puts his hand on my chest and grabs my hand to place it on his chest.
“Let’s get this jacket off, shall we?” he says softly and slides the jacket slowly down off my shoulders and arms. He places it on the chair.
“What?! What’s happened?!” He says, panicked at her crying.
“Draco, you must eat.” he chides. “I know a great place half way. We’ll stop there.” He squeezes my knee again, and then returns his hand to the steering wheel as he puts his foot down on the gas. I’m pressed into the back of my seat. Boy, this car can move.
“Thank you for coming around.” Andy says as we are waving goodbye.
“What do you mean?”
She grins.
“So that means Teddy and his grandmother got closest with James!” Ginny says looking at the board and Teddy jumps up and high fives her.
“Because we go every time, silly.” He says to me and then runs to get his shoes and coat.
“Would you like some tea?”
“Why are there no wipes in this bag? I thought you said everything was packed?” He says in a snotty tone.
“Draco?” I’m shocked he’s here, I don’t even know if this is real but then he speaks.
It’s international friendship day here in the uk! So happy celebrations! Hope you like the chapter. Enjoy X
“Whatever, where is my aunt Andromeda?” He says and turns to leave.
“Oh.” My brain has frozen, stunned into inactivity by this admission.
Before I know it I’ve spoken again and it’s not a question from Pansy’s parchment.
“She wouldn’t do that, and I wouldn’t tell you anything she tells me about Theo - if she were to tell me anything.” I add quickly.
“Yes. Call her in the morning. It’s late now.”
That’s the bottom line. I want to be with him. I sigh inwardly.
There’s an email from Harry in my inbox.
I open the door and run upstairs to Sirius bedroom. Luna chases after me but to no avail. I race into the room and slam the door, then I throw my strongest locking spell at it.
Luna giggles, and Harry rolls his eyes.
though it’s chilled and Harry’s lips are cool.
“It’s okay, I got you.” I go in front of him and he holds my shoulders. Then he bends forward and bawls.
“I like this.” He tugs at my pubic hair. “Perhaps we’ll keep this.”
As soon as they are gone, crookshanks leaps off my shoulder and starts chewing one of the pillows on the sofa.
Me and Draco had crashed as soon as we had gotten in last night from the burrow. It had been late and so we had slept in a bit this morning. It was almost 11 by the time we were ready to go to the house. Me and Draco had started calling it our haven. But Draco has been calling it something in French, ‘Notre coeur’. I have no idea what he’s saying but I hope it’s nice.
“Come on Harry, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Love!” She declares as if it’s nothing. I turn around and glare at her.
“Oh right! Sorry Harry. Shall we speak privately?” I nod and we go to the front room.
“I didn’t know it was an apple orchard, is there still apple trees there?” He looks like he’s thinking about something so I just answer him.
“No.”
“What do your siblings do?”
“Ahhhhh.” I panic and rush to her.
“Harry, Draco! Glad you boys could make it.” She hugs each of us and then pushes us together and gets a look as usual. She again stops on Draco’s midsection and looks up at him. “Draco honey, I’m going to be telling you to stop eating soon, rather than be eating more. Putting on a little podge I see.” Then she taps his belly. At this point I can practically feel his rage, but he could never shout at Molly. “To many takeaways with Harry maybe?” She questions and chuckles, not knowing what she’s done. Draco shoves me away and then points at me while screaming.
“What about Hogwarts? It’s familiar territory for him and the photos would look amazing.” I can hear her working it all out down to the last detail.
“Merlin. How far can you go?” he whispers.
“Oh Nia hey. Are you early?” I ask while checking my watch. It says 3 o’clock though, so she must be.
Oh….he’s still going and has added another finger, I’m close again. He stills.
Other names for Hermione and Ron are : Amelia, Isabelle, Emily, Monica after Hermione's mother, and rose after her grandmother.
“Do you think we could put ducks on our pond?” I ask Draco out of curiosity.
“Are you going to stand there all day or would you care to join me?” I smirk at him and take the hint. As I’m lying down next to him, he takes my hand and looks at me. In this moment he looks like a scared kid again. I squeeze his hand, give him a smile, and kiss him softly.
“You okay?” I ask him, a bit worried.
“So I do know what it involves, Draco.” His eyes glow with insight.
“Harry. Draco!” Hermione shouts over from one of the benches placed around the garden. We go over and Ron gets up and gives me a hug and then surprisingly gives Draco one too.
“Alright, take your time, bye.” She winks back, waves, and then we are gone.
“Just tell him to fuck off.” Pansy says, straight forward.
“Please, don’t let me keep you from anything.” I go to stand up but the look on his face stops me.
Thank you.
“Okay I’m sorry.” He got out between laughter. “It's just, you and Malfoy! I never in a million years would have seen it coming.” He said and then just as I was about to speak he urged, “you and Malfoy!” And looked utterly puzzled. I just shrugged because if i was honest I didn’t know where it had come from either. It had just happened, mainly thanks to Teddy and Andromeda.
I hope the rest of the night goes well though and I also hope I finally get to kiss Draco Malfoy.
He smiles wickedly, and his eyes glow as if relieved. “Yes, I am. Okay, agreed. Are you sure you don’t want to intern at my company? You’re a good negotiator.”
Sorry it's late guys, I've gone back to college this week and I've just not found the time. I'll try to upload every Friday but I apologise if it's late. Thank you again for all the kudos and comments! x
“Harry seriously are you okay?” He’s frowning now when I look over so I try to smile.
Is that what this all comes down to - trust? Surely that should be a two-way thing. I remember his snit when I phoned Blaise.
“Very much so Molly. Were any of your children this overdue?”
“Breakfast in bed?” I ask him, finally sitting up.
“No worries Harry, I just thought I’d wait in here for you. Lottie?” Andromeda’s only house elf appears then.
No doubt he thinks I’ve succumbed to Mr Potter’s dubious sexual habits. Not yet, just his exceptional sexual habits, or maybe sex is like that for everyone. I frown at the thought. I have no comparison, and I can’t ask Pansy. That’s something I am going to have to address with Harry. It’s perfectly natural that I should talk to someone - and I can’t talk to him if he’s open one minute and standoffish the next.
As I’m coming downstairs, I can smell something cooking. I don’t know when i last had something to eat but I wasn’t about to start now otherwise i would throw up. I come into the kitchen and Hermione’s plating up sausage and egg. Well if I was going to eat, I’m certainly not now. That was the last thing I cooked for Draco. I start crying again and sit down with my head in my hands.
“Harry, I have to think about this. I don’t know if I can have the kind of relationship you want.”
“Wow.” Is all I can say. It’s amazing, and it’s there and it’s alive. Me and Draco made that. I take his hand and squeeze it. After a minute it’s gone again.
“Draco, you’re pregnant. Ladders and mould definitely don’t mix well with pregnancy.” He let out his breath and turned around.
“That’s very considerate, Mr Potter.” I snap at him, but his smile only widens. I’m so glad you find me entertaining. I frown and continue walking. I’m surprised when he follows me out and both Oliver and Andrew look just as surprised as they look up.
The numbers refer to clause:
I walk towards the bed and run my hands down one of the intricately carved posts. The post is very sturdy, definitely got some magic running  through it.
“How’s the apple orchard coming along?” Ron asks then.
“By Mrs Robinson?”
“Oh, Pans, nothing I didn't want him to.”
“Yeah well, he keeps surprising me with his brilliance. I must ask Hermione where she got him.” He said out loud but was clearly speaking to himself. He still had his drink in hand and wandered into the living room.
“Why did you agree to this one?” I ask him, slightly confused as to why I’m here.
“Blaise, you know I can never stay mad at you for long. Just don’t pull that crap again.” I slap his arm.
My hands are on the brick wall of the flower bed but are hardly holding me up. I’m exhausted and need to lie down but something else is holding me up. That something then passes me a monogrammed handkerchief and vanishes all the vomit on the floor and walls. I cannot even look at him, I am so embarrassed. I’m disgusted in myself and swamped with shame. I feel like crying but don’t have the energy.
“Don't,” he murmurs.
“Good thank you aunt andromeda, how are you doing? And hello Edward, nice to see you again.” He winks at Teddy and gets a giggle out of him.
I find Potter by the main doors and we start our walk down to Hogsmeade. I suddenly realise that we have to talk to each other and my mind reales. What the hell are we going to talk about? What should I say to him? His warm voice brings me out of my reverie.
“You have been gone ages.” Pansy scolds me. “Where were you?”
“Excuse me? Why can’t we go?” Draco asks, crossing his arms and raising his eyebrow.
“Why? What’s wrong?” I sit next to him now and he turns to lean on me.
“Hello aunt andromeda.” Draco says and goes quiet. Guess I’ll be sharing the news today then.
“No Hermione we haven’t said it and it's none of your concern.”
“I’ve applied for some internships and I’m just waiting to hear back.”
“Never.”
“Again?” he breathes.
“I said, I can’t stop crying.” He said between sobs, much louder this time.
“For the house? Really? You don’t have to do this.” I wrap my arm around her shoulders and squeeze her.
would-be Dominant. Can this evening get any worse? I scowl at my hands in my lap.
“Say something.” Harry commands, his voice deceptively soft.
He loves and misses you very much.
“You were warm, don’t move.” He says and cuddles up to me, still a bit flushed. He always says he only gets close to me because I’m warm but Draco Malfoy is a cuddler. But I don’t mind, I like being close to him.
“Why don’t you call him?”
“For which publishing house?”
“I see.”
The cooker is huge, not like the small one we have in our rooms at Hogwarts, but I think I get the hang of it. I put the pancakes under a warming charm and start on the bacon. I put it under the grill, and while it’s cooking, I whisk some eggs. I turn around, and Harry is sitting on one of the chairs at the table, leaning on it, his face supported by his steepled hands. I jump and drop the bowl with the eggs in it, but it stops in mid air and Harry sends it over to the side. He’s still wearing the t-shirt he slept in. Just-fucked hair really, really suits him, as does his designer stubble. He looks both amused and bewildered. I blush, then gather myself and pull the headphones out of my ears, my knees weak at the sight of him.
Does the Submissive consent to be restrained with:
“I woke up and you weren’t there.”
“I need to be alone with you.”
“Yes happy Halloween Draco.” I groan and roll over.
“Aww….thanks, Severus.” Oh, I love this man.
“Oh.” Harry as a six-year-old boy….. My mind conjures an image of a beautiful, black-haired little boy with green eyes and my heart melts - a moppet-haired kid who likes impossibly sad music.
Blaise phones at eleven.
“Don’t worry about it Molly. Draco’s just in a bad mood tonight. But I wouldn't mention his weight again if I was you.” I tell her and give her another hug.
Holy shit! She’s so blunt. I go scarlet.
After nearly an hour of pushing we hear a cry. The baby has been born. Hermione is crying and laughing and kissing my hand.
“But if you work so hard, what do you do to chill out?” He smiles at this and reveals his brilliant white teeth. I stop breathing because wow he really is beautiful. It’s not fair and nobody should be this good looking.
“Tell me about Theo the overuser.” I ask when I’ve stopped laughing. Oh, I can feel myself relaxing for the first time since I was in line at the bar….before the phone call that started all this - when I was admiring Mr Potter from afar. Happy, uncomplicated days.
“Yeah, Katie said I might be sick when I’m in labour.” He wipes his forehead and looks up. “Sorry about the mess. I’m not fast these days.”
I look up then and we are by Pansy and Harry's brother Theo. Pansy is totally making a move with Theo and is dancing her arse off. She doesn’t show off like this unless she really likes someone. There might be three of us for breakfast in the morning. Pansy!
“You’re going to kiss him, aren’t you Harry?” She squealed out, while coming to sit next to her boyfriend on my couch.
“As well?” Harry’s eyes burn and he raises a questioning eyebrow. I blush. He lifts his hand and traces my cheek with his fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh ha right…. so… how far are you?”
“No problem. We just finished our dinning room and were about to start the next room but we can take a break. Right Draco?”
“Yeah well, I could have. I had offers.” He goes serious again then.
I get her settled in a chair at the kitchen table, which was put up yesterday. Then I open the first box I see and it’s filled with plates and bowls. So I start unpacking.
I sneak a glance at him and he looks cool and collected. What a prick. Is he totally unaffected by what just happened? He glances at me out of the corner of his eye and releases a deep breath. Hmmm, he is definitely affected.
“So, about this baby shower…” I laugh and get up then.
“What the hell was he doing in Hogsmeade?” I can hear her brain ticking and her curiosity taking over. I lean against the wall outside The Hogs Head, taking my break.
“Of course, darling. Draco, it’s been such a pleasure. I do hope we meet again.” She holds her hand out to me, her eyes glowing, and we shake.
“Yes.” He simply says.
“Hi ka-healer Bell. Draco hasn’t been himself lately. His emotions are all over the place, he’s always tired, he’s been throwing up for a couple of weeks…”
“Yeah he’s fast asleep in his room.” I tell him and kiss his head.
“Hurt you how?”
“Tell me then, enlighten me.” I say a bit harshly.
Greg is back again before he sets off back to America. His brother's party was the other day and Greg had spent the whole party following me around. Now he’s been sat at the bar since my shift started, asking me for a date. It’s annoying.
15.19    The Submissive shall not touch or pleasure himself sexually without permission from the Dominant.
He eventually gets in the bath and I sit on the toilet seat next to him, stroking his protruding belly. After I’ve helped him wash and made him feel relaxed, I sit back down for a while. Then I grab the small box off the table. “I know you're going to see your arse, but…. I got you something.” He frowns at me and stops playing with my hair.
The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions at times to be mutually agreed between the personal trainer and the Submissive. The personal trainer will report to the Dominant on the Submissive’s progress.
“I can’t do this Luna! I can’t leave this house and have a baby and get married! Sirius never did it! He stayed in this house!” I shout to her from where I’m sat against the door, panting hard.
“I’ve just been a little stressed, Pansy.” Thanks to a certain somebody.  “Do you want the photos or not?” I take the last drag and vanish the rest.
“I don’t know. He said he’d met me here-“ the floo roars to life just then and out steps Draco looking classy as always. “There he is.” I relax slightly at seeing him and move up a bit for Draco to slide in next to me. “Hey!” I enthusiastically say a bit too loudly. He sees us and heads over looking a bit embarrassed at my outburst.
“Really? Are you sure?” He nods and we kiss. Then Leo kicks again and we pull apart and laugh.
“Harry i really am sorry. I shouldn’t have walked out like that.”
It's a big plus having a potions expert as your boyfriend. I always have my cupboard filled with things I might need and he always knows what to use, I wouldn't have a clue.
“You’re agreeing?” His disbelief is evident.
I look up and stare at the ceiling seeing carabiners all over placed at odd intervals. I wonder what they are for but again wonder if I want to know. I glance back over the room and weirdly feel that all the wood, dark walls, moody lighting, and oxblood leather makes the room feel kind of soft and romantic…..I know it’s anything but. This is Harry’s version of soft and romantic. The room itself fits in with the old dark feel of the house though.
“Hiya Andy. Yeah we do. It’s not about the house and it might come as a shock to you, as it did to us.” I look to Draco and he’s smiling at me, then he places his hand on his belly. I follow his lead and place my hand on top of his. “Draco’s going to have a baby!” I say all in on.
Pansy lent me her new broom for two reasons. The first being that it is a fast broom! From Scotland to London is going to take a few hours but a lot less time on her broom than mine, and second being that my broom probably wouldn't even make it that far. It’s old and slow and on its last legs, but I still love it and it's been with me since day one of Hogwarts when I was 11. I’m now 21, so I’ve had it for ten years and it wasn’t new then.
“Hey Nia. They're going good so far thank you. We had a look around the rest of the land yesterday and saw some interesting things.” Draco said to her. At that she twitched her eyes and looked a bit nervous, I could only tell because I’d been trained to see things like that in the aurors. I kicked Draco gently under the table and gave him warning eyes. I cleared my throat and chuckled.
“No thanks love, not hungry.” I kiss him on the forehead and go to leave, when he grabs me and pulls me in for a proper kiss.
“Of course, you don’t even have to ask Harry, don’t be silly.” She smiled at him while rubbing his shoulder as he walked past her into Ron and Hermione’s house that they’d bought 2 years ago.
“Maybe we can have coffee or something tomorrow. I’ll call you.” I am conciliatory. He is my friend, and I’m very fond of him. But right now, I don't need this.
“Because I have other plans for you, Draco.”
Harry Potter
He’s even grumpy by email. Doesn't he understand that I may need to make a quick getaway? Not that my old broom is quick…..but still - I need a means of escape.
“Thanks everyone and thank you for coming.” Hermione says.
“Pansy made it.” I glance down at my grey shirt which is open neck and black open robe.
“Come, let’s have a bath.” He leans down and kisses me.
3    The Dominant and the Submissive agree and acknowledge that all that occurs under the terms of this contract will be consensual, confidential, and subject to the agreed limits and safety procedures set out in this contract. Additional limits and safety procedures may be agreed in writing.
As Blaise is taking his, I look at him.  He is tall, all shoulders and muscles, dark skin, dark hair, and burning dark eyes. Yeah okay, he’s pretty hot, but I think he’s finally getting the message that we are just friends. He puts his glass down and smiles at me.
The bath is a white stone, deeo, egg-shaped affair, very modern. Harry leans over and fills it from the faucet on the tiled wall. He pours some expensive-looking bath oil into the water. It foams as the bath fills and smells of sweet, sultry jasmine. He stands and gazes at me, his eyes dark, then peels his t-shirt off and casts it on the floor.
“Here.” Draco says next to me and passes Nia his photo. Good thing one of us remembers things. I smile at him and hug him to my side.
“Have a great time tonight Harry and tell me how it goes.” Hermione kissed my cheek and headed for the floo while grabbing Ron’s arm quite harshly.
“Worried, why?”
“Are you biting your lower lip deliberately?” he asks darkly.
“The ownership thing, that’s just terminology and goes back to the principle of obeying. It’s to get you into the right frame of mind, to understand where I’m coming from. And I want you to know that as soon as you cross my threshold as my submissive, I will do what I like to you. You have to accept that and willingly. That’s why you have to trust. I will fuck you, any time, any way I want - anywhere I want. I will discipline you, because you will screw up. I will train you to please me.
“What about our arrangement?”
“I’ll get it Lottie, it’ll be Draco.” I shout to the little house elf while jumping up out of my seat to rush to the door. I take a deep breath and straighten my T-shirt before opening it. And there he is, looking lovely as ever holding a broom-wait, A BROOM?! Did we agree to go flying and I’ve forgot? No I wouldn't forget that. Is he here to cancel our date so he can go flying? No, I don’t think he’d do that-
“We didn’t….?” I say into my hands, in mortified horror.
“It’s beautiful.” Hermione sobs on Ron’s shoulder. Then I say goodbye and head back upstairs.
“Call me Lily.” She grins, and Harry frowns. “So how did you two meet?” She looks questioningly at Harry, unable to hide her curiosity.

“Good things I hope. Oh and congratulations with the pregnancy! Have you got a scan picture? Harry and Draco have just shown me theirs.” Hermione looks at me with wide eyes then.
“Did you play quidditch while you were at Hogwarts?” I ask him curiously.
“Draco?” He sounds surprised, and I’m surprised I’m calling him as well. Then my brain catches up and I wonder how he knows it’s me.
“Told you.” Both Draco and Luna say to me and Ginny. Although Luna says it a lot nicer than Draco.
When we get back to the house we go into the living room. It's the only room that’s clean and the big bay windows bring in lots of light. Nia sits on the window seat and Draco sits in the middle of the floor facing Nia. I just stay standing.
“Ready to go?” He asks from in front of me. I didn't even hear him end the call or get up. I nod and he picks up his phone and keys and heads for the door. He opens it and turns to me. “After you, Mr Malfoy.”
His eyes narrow. “I would really like you to finish your breakfast.”
was that?” he asks through his gritted teeth.
Someone shows us to a room immediately and tells us to wait for healer Bell here. As soon as they leave Draco grabs my arm and squeezes.
“Well I like flying and it allowed me to think before and after the interview. Besides, the interview ran over so I made good time considering.” I drop my bag on the coffee table and take out the recorder for her. She grabs it out of my hand and beams a smile at me.
“sore?”
“Harry? What the hell are we going to do about...the termites.”
“I’d love to Greg!” I tell him honestly. It will be nice catching up with him and the family.
“Harry, is everything okay? Your floo is shut.” Hermione says down the phone. Me and Draco share a look and he nods.
My eyes widen, and I swallow again.
“You shut up.” I say back like a child.
“I thought the weather was particularly unexceptional today.” He smirks.
“Good. That’s all Andrew.”
I blink up at him as he holds it open, and as I hold my arms out behind me, I’m reminded of the time in his office when he slipped my jacket onto my shoulders - the first time I met him - and the effect he had on me then. Nothing’s changed; in fact, it’s more intense. His jacket is warm, far too big, and it smells of him….. Delicious. I don’t say to him that I could just use a warming charm; Harry seems to prefer to do things the muggle way, and I’m enjoying it if I’m honest.
“I know babe, but like I said, family is there to support and help you. I’m your family Dray, and your mine. And I kind of need you too right now.” I tell him and my eyes start watering. He softens on me and curls up next to me with his head on my chest.
“Like I said, you are welcome to borrow any. You can spend as much time here as you like.”
I am engrossed in my book, but then the bell on the door chimes and I look up. I nearly choke on my bagel when my eyes meet with the bold green eyes of Harry Potter, who’s heading towards the bar.
“Thank you so much Harry! Thank you!” He pats my back and releases me. I wave them goodbye with a smile and head to the closest floo.
“You don’t have to come up with excuses Draco, if you don’t want to do this anymore then just tell me? I know it's been awkward and daunting and-“
“How do I do that?” My mouth is dry and I wish I’d had more wine. Okay, I understand the pleasing bit, but I am puzzled by the Elizabethan-torture setup. Do I want to know the answer?
“So what can I get you guys today then?” She changes the subject.
“Yes…..a few things.” He takes a sip of his wine and doesn’t take his eyes off me. I can feel them following me as I look around the room.
“Please.” I smile at him. Mr Potter floats the bottle around and fills everyone else's glasses too.
“Don’t be sad uncle Harry, I’m still here.” He says and I tickle him till he giggles.
“See you next time devil cat.” I whisper to him. He got on a bit better after that first day but not by a lot. That cat will always be an evil genius and a pest.
“How many years ago was this Nia?” Draco said rather kindly.
For my birthday, Draco, Hermione and Ron took me and Teddy to the beach. Me and Draco love the beach and we love to swim. The first time Draco called me Harry was when we were swimming with Teddy at the local swimming baths.
“No.”
“Laters, babe.” He murmurs and gives me a wink. I laugh because it’s so unlike him and even though I know he’s joking, the endearment tugs at something deep inside me.
“What’s wrong?!” I ask him and look at Leo, but he’s fine. Draco looks up and more tears fall. Then he puts his arms around me and pulls me into a hug. I go willingly and thankful.
“You’re even saying the same things. Muggles believe that’s a good thing. I’ll get the drinks.” She scoots out of the room with a far off look on her face.
“Hey, you never told me, when’s this little one due?” I ask and rub his stomach.
“What’s got his knickers in a twist?” I ask Leo but he just giggles and babbles some more.
“It's alright Hermione, we will be fine. You go and relax a bit in Greece. I’ll look after crookshanks and everything will go swimmingly.”
“Good morning, Mr Malfoy. You’re very energetic this morning.” he says dryly.
The room is small but sumptuous. Beneath a shimmering chandelier, the table is all starched linens, crystal glasses, silver cutlery, and white rose bouquet. An old-world, sophisticated charm pervades the wood-paneled room. The waiter pulls out my chair, and I sit. He places my napkin in my lap. Harry sits opposite me. I peek up at him.

“Yeah, just tired and my back is killing.”
Clean clothes! That is an unexpected bonus.
“That’s a shame. Those apples from the tree in the back, that were in that apple pie, were bloody delicious.” He licks his lips just thinking about it. I laugh at him and shove him forward.
“There really isn’t anything mysterious about me.”
“Nooo.” We say again.
I show them to Draco and move both chairs next to the bed. I sit on the other side of Draco on the bed and he leans into me.
“Cool hair Teddy!” I say picking him up to hold on my hip. He’s getting a bit big for this now but I can't resist.
“Hey guys, you’re late. Everyone’s waiting…. you forgot didn’t you?” He said after taking one look at us. Me and Draco look at one another and sighed again because we did forget and we also knew we had to go. Molly had invited everyone round for tea today and we had promised we would be there. We had made that promise about 2 weeks ago though, and with all this house stuff, and baby stuff...and Nia stuff, i guess we just forgot.
“So there is a shop?” I ask, confused.
When we land in her bedroom I sit her on the bed.
“Yeah it is.”
“Draco…” I swim up to him and hold him up. He looks like he is either going to faint or be sick. He puts his arms around my neck and I grab under his legs and carry him out of the pool. I lay him on one of the beds and knee down next to him.
Draco is still bit down from yesterday's news but he is clearly excited about finding out the gender.
15.18    The Submissive shall accept without question any and all disciplinary actions deemed necessary by the Dominant and remember his status and role in regard to the Dominant at all times.
I get out of the castle and let the cold wind hit me. It cools me down and allows me to think. I look down the hill and I see Hagrid's hut, there is smoke coming out the chimney so he must be in. Before I can make a decision, my feet have started to walk me towards it. I get there and knock on the door. Fang starts barking immediately and I back up slightly.
“Draco calm down. It’s not your fault, Katie said it’s common with first pregnancies. If you do everything Katie said and take your potion, then this will all go away and everything will be fine okay.”
“Yes, and that broom has been reliable throughout my time at Hogwarts.”
I put my knife and fork down. I cannot eat any more.
Oh fuck. His words, he’s so seductive. He takes my breath away.
Internet research
“The baby needs stuff too.” She says and goes into the nursery.
“Stay down here, I’m gonna see what’s up there. I don’t want you going up there and the thing caving in.” I said and moved towards the rickety ladder.
“Oh.” Fucking hell, that’s young!
We take our places. Mr Potter is at the head of the table, while I sit at his right hand, and Harry is seated beside me. Mr Potter reaches for the opened bottle of red wine and offers some to Pansy. Luna takes her seat beside Harry and, grabbing his hand, squeezes it tightly. Harry smiles warmly at her.
“That was my dad's broom. He was magic. But he sent me away with it and an old chest and never came back.” She was crying now. “Please don’t hurt me.”
I pout petulantly as I plug my iPod earbuds in, blast music, and sit down at my small desk to reread the contract and make comments.
“My apologies Mr Malfoy. Olivia is our new intern. Mr Potter shouldn’t be long now, another 5 minutes or so.” He confirms my suspicions, smiles and returns to the desk.
Draco Malfoy
“Yes please!” He gets so excited by this that he ends up soaking me with bath water and bubbles. “Oops, sorry uncle Harry.” He looks upset but it was only an accident and I don’t mind, so I quickly use a spell to dry and look at him.
July 7th It’s been a month since we completed Nia’s loft, yet we still haven’t got far with the rest of the house. Since Nia’s room, we have only finished the master bedroom, the walk in cupboard, and one other bedroom. And we are yet to furnish anywhere else. By this rate, the baby will be here before we have a room for him. We need to finish the other 3 bedrooms, the laundry room, and the bathroom before we even think of furniture or wallpaper/paint. The outside looks a lot more presentable now. Neville is coming to finish the greenhouse with me today. Then it’s just the stables that need sorting but that can wait till last. As for all the fields and the old barn, where Nia lived, they will have to wait for when we are less hectic. I’ll get to them eventually but they aren’t my main concern as they are out of the way for now. That reminds me, the front of the house needs a new coat of paint and then weather and mould protection spells. As I’m coming downstairs, to get more cloths, I hear voices. “-have you got?” Draco asks but I only hear the end of whatever he asked. “There are probably about 100 overall. I’ve got this box and two more to go get, the rest are already in the greenhouse, then that's it. Just got to get them potted and placed.” Neville tells Draco. It surprises me that Draco isn’t hiding from him but this last month he has really taken to this pregnancy. I think last month really scared him with his low blood sugar, but we have seen Katie since and she said he is doing well keeping it under control. It’s still a risk but he’s doing well. “Wow, you’ll have to keep an eye on them. Make sure Harry doesn’t kill them off.” They both chuckle and I turn into the front room to see them. They are smiling and Draco has one hand on his baby bump and one hand on his back. They spot me then. “Speak of the devil.” Draco says and they both laugh again, which I join in with. “And I shall arrive.” I finish Draco’s saying and go and kiss him. “Hey Neville, do you want help with that?” I go over and take the box off him without waiting for a response. “Thanks Harry, I have 2 more boxes to get so I’ll be right back.” He says and goes back through the floo. “A hundred plants Harry? Really?” Draco raises his eyebrow at me but smirks. “Yep!” I say happily and walk towards the door. Draco follows me. “Why?” He asks. “Well some of them are pretty, some are things we will need, and some are for you. To carry on your potion inventions…..after you have given birth of course.” I tell him as he holds my shoulder for support coming down the porch steps. “Well… that was very nice of you.” He sniffs and points his chin up. “It’s why you love me.” I say winding him up a little, then kiss his cheek and put the box down outside the greenhouse. “Now you sit down in the greenhouse if you like, and I’m going to help Neville with the other boxes. I’ll be back in a tick.” He frowns a bit at that but I keep walking so he can’t start anything. Katie said his mood swings may come back and boy have they. The rest of the day is spent in the greenhouse with Neville and occasional Draco. We repot all the plants and place them in the best area. We have put a spell on the green house so that it is split into the 4 seasons of the year. One quarter is for winter plants, another is for autumn plants, another for summer, and the last for spring. Each plant has of course got it’s own temperature spell and self watering spell, but it’s best to keep the plants happy. Neville is just talking to me before he goes when Draco comes in to say goodbye. He looks a bit pale and clammy and I’m just about to tell him he should sit down. He starts to talk and then his eyes roll back and he falls to the ground. “Draco!” I shout and rush to him. He had fallen backwards onto the floor and I don’t know if he hit his head. “Merlin, is he okay Harry? Shall I call a mediwitch?” Neville asks, hovering over us. “Please Neville. Ask for healer Bell. Tell her to come now.” I tell him and try to wake Draco. A couple of minutes later, Katie arrives. By this time Draco’s head is resting on my lap and I’m stroking his hair. This is the only thing keeping me from panicking. “Harry what happened?” Katie asks and kneels down. I can’t talk and just keep shushing Draco while stroking his hair. “He just fainted. He came into the room, was about to talk, and his eyes just rolled back. Then he was on the floor. He may have hit his head.” Neville tells Katie, as they can both see I’m not going to talk anytime soon. “Okay. Harry, I’m going to do a couple of spells on Draco. I need to do one on his head, so I need you to put him down and move away.” Katie says slowly but I shake my head. “Harry, come on.” Neville says gently and pulls my arm up. I place Draco’s head on the floor softly and move away. As Katie is doing the spells I look away. I feel sick and I can feel my breath quickening. I place my hands on my knees and bend over. I try to slow my breathing but I won't be able to, not until I know he’s okay. There’s a buzzing in my ear now and can’t hear anything. “-okay. Harry? Can you hear me? I said Draco’s okay.” I stand up straight and turn to Draco and Katie. He’s sitting up and everyone is looking at me but I don’t give a damn. I rush over to him and fall to my knees next to him. I wrap myself around him and he does the same. “I’m okay, no need to get so worked up.” Draco says, half joking. I sniff into his neck and slap him lightly on the back. “The baby is fine too. I told you fainting could be a side effect. You obviously overdid it today and this was your body’s way of telling you to slow down and conserve your magic.” Katie tells Draco and gets up. “Now get some rest and I will see you both tomorrow.” “Thank you Katie.” I tell her and give her a smile. She nods and heads back through the floo.”I’ll leave you guys too. I’m sure I’ll see you soon” Neville says and gives a salute, then follows Katie through the floo. “Come on, let’s get you back to grimmauld.” Draco says to me and I frown at him confused. “I’m the one who should be putting you to bed, not the other way around.” I tell him and get up. “Yes but you just nearly had a panic attack and I’m clearly fine now.” He smirks and I help him up. “Whatever, let’s just get a chinese and go to bed.” He chuckles and we head for the floo. “How are you feeling after yesterday Draco?” Katie asks him as we walk into the examination room. “I’m totally fine thank you healer Bell, like I’ve told Harry 100 times over. It was like you said, I must have done too much yesterday.” Draco tells her, while sending me a glare and sitting on the bed. “How about you Harry? You okay?” She asks and looks at me. “Ermm..yeah I’m okay thanks Katie. I get panic attacks all the time.” I tell her with my head bent. “Yeah same. Who wouldn’t after what we’ve been through, right?” She smiles sadly at me and Draco and then starts writing things down. “So any other symptoms or side effects?” She asks Draco now, back to professionalism. “Other than fainting, I’ve felt nausea quite often but never actually been sick. I’ve definitely had clammy, pale and cold skin, sometimes all at the same time. My mood swings and craving are also back. Oh and I’ve been getting pains in the side of my stomach again, but you said they were normal so I’ve not worried.” He lists off. “Good, too much worrying is bad for chéri. Now at 24 weeks your baby is as big as a pomegranate. He’s still growing rapidly but is very comfortable for now.” She’s writing again and about to say something else when Draco interrupts. “Oh I’ve had nose bleeds as well.” He says thinking. Katie chuckles and nods. “Okay. Like I said, it’s all very common. Now, have you thought about a birth plan?” She looks from Draco to me then back again. We both have blank expressions though. “I’ll take that as a no. Things to decide are: where are you going to have the baby? At home or at st mungos? Do you want pain relief? If so, muggle or magical? Who do you want there? Also you need to keep in mind that we may have to operate if things start going wrong.” She stops writing then and looks at Draco. “With male pregnancies, we don’t like to do cesarean sections. Giving birth naturally really helps with the healing of your magic, and a cesarean can be quite dangerous. These are all things you need to think about Draco. Do you have any questions?” She looks at him and he shakes his head. She gets up suddenly then. “Good, let’s get on with the scan.” She smiles and Draco lies down. The rest of the scan proceeds as normal; we near the baby’s heartbeat, then we get to see him and get pictures to take home, then Katie does diagnostics. “Well everything seems fine. Remember to keep resting and I’ll see you in two weeks. If anything happens floo call me.” She says and opens the door for us. “Thank you healer Bell.” Draco says on his way out. “Thanks Katie.” I wink at her as I pass behind him. “Great, time to plan a baby shower with Hermione now.” Draco sulks at me on our way to the floo. “She’s probably already at Notre coeur by now.” “Well don’t ask for my opinion, I’ve got to get at least one of these 4 spare bedrooms finished today.” I shake my head. “You do realise one of those ‘spare bedrooms’ is going to be a nursery for our baby.” Draco says, using air quotations. “Yeah, I just don’t know which one yet.” Draco was right and Hermione was waiting for him when we got back. But what we didn’t expect was Nia. “Hey, you ready?” She asks me as soon as she sees us. “For…” I say, confused as hell. “For the meeting with mcgonagall…. you forgot didn’t you?” Shit yes. “No!” I tell her instead. “I’m ready when you are.” Draco snorts next to me and goes to join Hermione on the window seat. “Harry, you really need some furniture in here. These window seats are so uncomfortable.” Hermione says just as I’m heading back to the floo. “Yep, I’m on it Hermione.” I tell her, annoyed. The meeting with mcgonagall went great. Nia is learning quickly and improving everyday. She gave Nia more books and gave me a list of the next things that I need to teach her. We had a cup of tea with her and then off we went again. Hermione and Draco were on the front porch sitting on the steps. They each had a cup of tea which they must have got from Hermione’s house. I was just heading upstairs again to try get the bedroom sorted when Draco called me. “Harry? What do you think of this?” He shouted. I stopped and went back down the few stairs I had managed to climb. He’s telling me something but I can’t concentrate. This party stuff isn’t my thing. Then Hermione speaks. “Harry, you really should get at least a fridge for that kitchen. We couldn’t even make a cup of tea.” That's when I blow. “If you haven’t noticed Hermione, I’ve been sort of busy! What do you think I do all day? I’ve got a house to rebuild, decorate, and furnish, on my own! I've got a student who needs teaching magic from the beginning. I’ve got a 6 year old orphaned godson to keep up with. And if you haven’t noticed, I’ve got a very ill, very pregnant fiancé who fainted yesterday! So sorry if I haven’t had time to furnish to your liking yet!” I’m breathing fast and I stare at Hermione. She looks surprised and a bit upset. I cannot deal with another pregnant person crying today. I turn around and head upstairs. As I’m reaching the top I hear Nia. “I didn’t know you guys were engaged, congratulations.” Then I slam the door behind me. I was finishing my second bedroom of the day when Draco came to get me. I hadn’t even realised it had gone dark. “Hermione’s gone and Nia’s at work, are you ready to go?” He looks upset with me so I sigh and turn to him. “Draco, I’m really sorry for shouting. I-“ He cuts me off with a hand up and I think he’s about to start having a go but he surprises me. “Harry, it’s fine. I know how stressed you are, and it kills me everyday not being able to help you out more. Hermione has been nagging all day and it was about time someone told her off. She didn’t understand how much pressure you are under.” I get up and he hugs me. “I really do wish I could help, you know?” “I know love. But you just keep our baby safe and I’ll do the rest.” He smiles at me and we share a long sweet kiss. “Come on, it’s my bedtime.” Draco says and starts pulling me. The next morning Draco wakes me up with a blow job. I quickly return the favour and then lie down next to him again. “Happy anniversary.” Draco says, breathing hard. Shit! I forgot! Well I didn’t forget, and I got him a present, but I forgot what day it was today. “Happy anniversary!” I tell him and sit up. He pushes me back down and puts his arm over my chest to stop me getting back up. “Harry, relax. I don’t care if you forgot. Today you are having a break. We are not doing anything all day. We are going to stay in this house, watch tv, order pizza, and take a bath. Understood?” He tells me and strokes his belly at the same time, which makes the threat less demanding. “Okay then.” I breath out. So that’s all we do all day. We relax. First we had a bath together, so the day started off good. Then we had breakfast and watched tv with our feet up. Then we both did some reading for a bit. For lunch we warmed Mollys lasagne up and ate it in bed with the tv on in our room. After lunch we played a game of chess and then we both took a nap. By the time we woke up, it was tea time. We did as Draco said and ordered pizza. “What shall we do now?” I ask Draco about 20 minutes after finishing our pizzas’. “I want you to come to Notre coeur with me. Please? I have a surprise waiting for you.” He gets up and urges me to do the same. “Fine but this better not be a prank or I will have to destroy you.” I get up and give him a kiss. He snorts and leads me to the floo. When we get to the house, Draco takes my hand and leads me upstairs. “Dray, what are we doing here?” I whine to him. “Today was meant to be relaxing.” “Just trust me okay.” We get to the top of the stairs and he shoves me towards the master bedroom. “In there.” He points. I go to the door, open it and pause with one foot in. The whole bedroom is finished. It has been painted and wallpapered and furnished. I stand there gobsmacked. “What- how- what?!” I stutter out. My hand is still on the door knob and I’m completely frozen. “Happy anniversary babe.” He comes up behind me and puts his arms around my waist. Then he kisses my neck and places his chin on my shoulder. I can feel his belly on my back. “How?” I ask him. “Well after your outburst yesterday, Hermione gave me an idea. She said you need some help, so I spent the day talking to luna and Ginny and Fleur and George. I asked them for help and told them exactly what we wanted. They were more than happy to help.” I turn around and kiss him hard. “You are fucking amazing.” I tell him and turn back around to inspect. “I know.” He says. “We could live in here now if we wanted, but I’d rather wait till it’s finished if that’s okay.” I nod and go to see the bathroom. “Also, they said anytime you need help just ask.” He sits on the bed and watches me. “Draco, this is great and such a relief. Thank you so much.” I kiss him again and sit next to him. “What would I do without you eh?” I chuckle to him. “Die probably.” He laughs back. “Come on.” He gets up and grabs my hand. “I have one more surprise.” He takes me to the bedroom opposite the stairs, the closest to our room. He tilts his head in a way of telling me to go in. So I open the door and look in awe. This room which was nothing has now been transformed into a nursery for our baby boy. There’s a magical beasts’ theme and there are moving animals all over the walls. There is a white coat, a white changing table, a little white wardrobe and draws, and in the corner is an old looking white rocking chair which I recognise instantly, with the dragon heartbeat teddy on it. “Is that my mother's rocking chair? From Godric's hollow?” I ask him although I know the answer. I go over to it and run my fingers along the top. “Yeah, I asked Luna to go get it for us.” I have tears in my eyes now when I turn around to face him. “Draco… I… I don’t know what to say. This is so lovely and nice. Thank you so much.” I kiss him again and I put as much feeling into it as possible. “You’re welcome.” He says softly. He smiles back at me and is also crying now. “I didn’t forget about our anniversary by the way. I just forgot what day it was today. So, I have something for you to.” I go in my pocket and pull out the ring box. His eyes go wide and he gasps. “I wanna do it properly this time.” I get down on one knee and hold the box open to him. “Draco Malfoy, will you do me the honour of marrying me?” He’s crying more now and he nods enthusiastically. “Yes! Of course, yes!” I take the ring out and place it on his ring finger, then I get up and kiss him. He looks at the ring closer then and frowns a little. “Why is there a tiny diamond constellation?” He asks while still smiling and frowning. I won’t tell him the real reason right now, I'll save that one. “It’s my star sign. So I’m kinda always with you.” I smile goofily at him. He just laughs and kiss me. “I love it.” Then he gasps suddenly and his eyes shoot open. “What?!” I ask him panicked. He grabs my hand and places it on his stomach. I’m slightly confused and worried for a minute. Then I feel it, and I make the same reaction as Draco. “He’s kicking!” I say, amazed. “Yeah!” Draco say, also placing his hand on his stomach. “This is the best day ever.” I tell Draco and lean down to kiss his belly. “It really is.” He says stroking my hair. “Teddy is going to be so jealous he wasn’t here to feel it.” I say and we both laugh. “Merlin, I love you so much Draco. And you to chéri.” “I love you both too.” Draco says and pulls me up for another kiss. I really don’t know how I got so lucky.
“Why do you smell like a bar by the way?”
“Nothing!” Me and Teddy said at the same time. We chuckle at each other and I put him down so we can go into the house.
The doors open and he lets me go in first. Always the gentleman - except perhaps in rare, precious moments in elevators. I blush at the memory of his mouth on mine and then the thought enters my mind that I’d been unable to touch him. I would have given anything to run my fingers through his unruly hair, but I had been unable to move at all. I get frustrated at the thought.
Then it hits me like a brick wall. Everything comes back! Draco, the argument, the drinking, calling Ron and Hermione drunk and telling them to not be my friend, them coming over, and eventually putting me to bed.
“Well I was thinking, maybe we could keep it a surprise? I haven’t definitely decided that’s what I want to do, but I was thinking it would be nice. But if you don’t want-“
“You look different.” Pansy says fondly.
“Come in.” I shout. Nia pokes her head around the door.
“For saving me.” I whisper
We chat a bit and then Andy calls for Lottie to serve the starter. As we are eating Teddy starts talking.
mouth. He leans down, and I drink another mouthful from his lips….
“Okay, next we are going to guess the size of the bellies!” George announces and points to Hermione and Draco. He instantly looks furious and glares at George.
Soft lips brush across my temple, leaving sweet tender kisses in their wake, and part of me wants to turn and respond, but mostly I want to stay asleep. I moan and burrow into my pillow.
Draco comes over and takes Leo from Hermione, then just walks off.
“I’ve ordered already. I hope you don't mind.”
“Draco wait up!” I shouted to him while running to catch him. “What the hell do you mean Hermione hates you?!”  I demanded. He couldn’t just say things like that about my friends and get away with it. Even if my so-called friend did put us in this position in the first place.
“Forget about the rules. Forget about all those details for tonight. I want you. I’ve wanted you since you fell into my office, and I know you want me. You wouldn't be sitting here calmly discussing punishment and hard limits if you didn't. Please, Draco, spend the night with me.” He holds his hand out to me, his eyes are bright, fervent….excited, and I put my hand in his. He pulls me up and into his arms so I can feel the length of his body against mine, this swift action taking me by surprise. He takes the bobbles out my hair and then runs his fingers around the nape of my neck and threads his fingers through my hair. Then he gently pulls it so that I am forced to look up at him. He gazes down at me.
“Because I want all of your pleasure.” His voice is husky but determined.
“I’m so sorry Andy.” I deflate and sit down with my head in my hands. Then the tears come. “I’m so sorry I haven’t helped you with all that. I’m sorry I couldn’t help with the funerals. I just couldn’t. But you had to and I should have been a man and helped you. But instead I spend all my time in bed and can’t sleep through the night without seeing one of their faces. Tonks, Remus, Fred, Sirius, Dobby, Severus, Dumbledore, even Colin and Lavender.” I’m really crying now and think I’m on the brink of a panic attack. Then someone coughs from the doorway and I look up.
“I am. That was our original plan.”
“Were you collared?” I whisper.
I was having a wonderful dream involving a certain blonde, when I was rudely interrupted by someone shaking me awake. I snapped awake and shot up, just to slam into someone else’s head. The pain was instant and stung like a bitch.
“Yes well it’s always good to be prepared and prove you wrong at the same time. Now, I’m going to get a shower and get ready to redecorate more of our lovely home.” He says on his way out, then stops at the door and looks over his shoulder flirtingly. “You’re welcome to join me in the shower oh great Gryffindor.” He says the last bit just to get back at me, then walks off. Well I’m certainly not going to say no to that.
“Which Pansy edits,” I add, hoping to steer the conversation away from me.
“London?”
“Great, home it is. Now who do you want there?”
“It doesn’t matter. We are having a good time at the moment and I don’t need to complicate things with my ‘feelings’.” I use air quotes at her when saying feelings, to which she just rolls her eyes.
My subconscious is telling me I can do this - play this sex god at his own game.
Later on we are finally in bed and Draco is almost asleep when I start talking.
“I wanna see the scan!” Teddy shouts while jumping up and down. We all laugh and Draco pulls the picture out his pocket. Teddy goes to snatch it but Andy takes it first.
“You just need all your little nick nacks now and the tv.” I agree and sit down next to her. “Where did you say Draco was?”
“Thanks Teddy! I’m 19 today. Wow, you're 6!” He nods his hair and then comes over to me and Draco while Andy goes over to Nia.
“It will be fine, everyone’s emotions are just running high right now but I’ll deal with Ron and you deal with Draco.”
I put my head in my hands. Blaise and Harry, they both want something from me. Blaise is easy to deal with. But Harry…. Harry takes a whole different league of handling, of understanding. Part of me wants to run and hide. What am I going to do? His burning green eyes and that intense smouldering stare come into my mind’s eye, and my body tightens at the thought. I gasp. He’s not even here and I’m half hard. It just can’t be about sex, can it? I recall his gentle banter this morning at breakfast, his joy at my delight with the motorbike ride, him playing the piano -  the sweet, soulful, oh-so-sad music.
