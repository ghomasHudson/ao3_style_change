Harry was gaping at Teddy. Bloody Marauder kids. Had
“I said we went to school together, we never had a good relationship. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that every interaction I had with Malfoy over six years was disastrous. It’s hard to immediately ignore all that.”
“Anything else from the past along with that name that you just can’t seem to let go of?” Teddy had a satisfied smile on his face, and Harry was convinced that Remus had somehow managed to pass on a bit of Sirius’ soul into his son.

Harry clapped his hands together. “Alright, then! It’s settled, I’ll let Malfoy know, we can set something up.”
“Why would that be?”
Al groaned and dropped his head into his hands. “Teddy, please don’t insinuate that my dad wants to hook up with Scorp’s dad,
Al was surveying Harry with consideration too now. “You know, Teddy’s starting to get to me, you two are definitely so
it’d be good!”
An inexplicable expression passed over Andromeda’s face. “Oh. Of course.” Her voice sounded strange, as if it were trying very hard to hold back a good number of emotions she did not want released.
Teddy shook his head and leaned forward to pour himself some tea from the pot laid out on the table. “Tell him, then.”
Al frowned, trying to recall Teddy’s mother’s name. His dad had always called her, ‘your mother,’ when talking to Teddy about her, or Tonks, when reminiscing with some old friend or another. He’d never stopped to consider the peculiarity that his dad might have called Teddy’s mother by her last name, figured it was something of a fixture in the way he never called Scorpius’ dad anything but

“Al.” He repeated firmly. “Everybody’s calls me that anyway.”
Heathens. All his children were heathens, Harry decided. “I - I don’t have to stand and listen to these
around each other.”
Harry continued quickly, speaking fast in almost a hope that the others wouldn’t fully hear him. “I figured you might like to meet him, because having any family is nice, really.” He ignored the pressure on his heart, because he knew certainly well that if
Al, shut your ears - I do not want to ‘hook up’ with Malfoy.” Harry paused, frowning at Al. “Why do you know anything about ‘hooking up’, anyway, you’re twelve.”
Andromeda set her mug down hard onto the table. The boys jumped. She’d been so quiet, they’d nearly forgotten she was there. “Teddy, I think it’s a good idea. You should meet your family. I will also come. Let Narcissa know to also be there. I think I’d like to see her.” She’d looked straight at Harry when she said this, but with that, she stood from the table and walked back to the sliding glass doors, and then through it, without another word.
“I’n not
Teddy rolled his eyes. “Harry, I know you mean the best, but I really don’t know why I need to meet some first cousin once removed. I have enough family to keep track of as it is, with the billion Weasley cousins.”
“Well.” Teddy frowned after his grandmother.
Harry groaned and threw his head back. “I’m an idiot.”
“I don’t think Dumbledore quite reached the age of two hundred.” Al gave Andromeda a look so strong that only a twelve year old could have gotten away with it. She smiled, amusement setting in over the lurches and surprise. “My daughter - Teddy’s mother, of course - despised her name similarly. Refused to let anyone call her by it. Not that it stopped me or Ted.”
“Do you really think I don’t notice that every time Al announces that Scorpious is coming round, you don’t get all stiff and weird?”
. In a way, right?”
” Teddy’s muffled voice became clearer as he slid the glass doors aside and huffed over to where Andromeda and Al were seated at the garden table. “Oh, Al, thank god, my favourite pseudo-brother -“

of presence that may have been, Malfoy had been for a solid six or seven years of his life. Harry briefly pondered on the fleeting nature of experience and how his childhood had flown by so quickly and thoroughly. Teddy thought of other things. “I’m just saying, you seem a bit
Harry scoffed, “You know perfectly well you always have a choice.”
Al was looking around at each of them, confused. “What just happened.”

Which is weird, but. Why do you want Teddy’s to meet Scorp’s dad?”
Teddy rotated to face Al, ignoring Harry’s focus on him. “Al, please, you may be able to communicate with him, he did birth you after all,
Teddy clearly did not think this meant as much as Harry thought it did. It was hard to convey how much of a presence, whatever

Teddy snorted but his cheeks had gone a faint pink and once he’d felt the heat in his face, it was hard to stop the whole thing from turning a solid shade of bubblegum.
“Not that Victoire’s much of a cousin is she.” asked Al, eyeing Teddy with derision.
Al looked incredulous. “You really have to ask? Albus is a rubbish name, and it's not like I can go by
Andromeda must have seen the lost look on Al’s face so she added, “Her name was Nymphadora.”
“Technically, but -"

the bad. No-one’s going to hear me say Albus and see
names, there are a billion other Jameses and Lilys, so its not always the image of a two hundred year old wizard that comes to mind, is it.”
"Oh." Harry wants to tell him that this isn't a dream, but he instead replies, "Why?"
"Oh, fuck!" Draco shouts. He pulls out, and with two rough strokes on his cock, shoots his load all over the drapes.
"I removed it from the Brooklyn Bridge Lookout, the last thing I did before I left for Florida. I couldn’t leave it behind." From the pouch, Draco pulls out a paper, crumpled at the edges, but still well preserved. He smooths it out and presents it to Harry.
Harry gulps his tepid coffee and swallows thickly. Wincing from the aftertaste, Harry stares at the picture of Draco Malfoy on the Ministry file — Malfoy's mug shot, taken during his sentencing to Azkaban after the War: dishevelled blond hair, defeated grey eyes, healed-over wounds knitted on his cheek, and the black spider's scrawl of Azkaban's serial number tattooed on the right side of his neck. Harry had testified for both Narcissa and Draco Malfoy during the Trials two years ago, reducing Malfoy's sentence to a mere month and releasing Narcissa from custody. Ever since then, he hasn't heard anything about either Malfoy.
“He just looks pretty sick, is all.” The Irish boy looked a bit awkward. “You haven’t noticed?”
“Excellent, excellent!” Lockhart cried, clapping his hands. “Capital choice, Professor Snape! Mr. Nott, if you would come up here…”
Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy that he’d met in Herbology at the start of term, coming toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.
Harry spun around and scanned the crowd. He hadn’t realized that Malfoy was here.
"You're making fun of me," she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.
"I wouldn't bet on that," Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth.
The other Gryffindor boys nodded in agreement, and Harry chipped in his Knut.
“No, no- I’ve noticed- I was just wondering where you picked up that… turn of phrase.”
"Can we move? I feel sick," said Ron.
The ghostly girl sniffed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Wood's been teaching us new moves."
Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a three foot-long composition on "The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards."
"It's going to kill someone!" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps -
The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.
"Why do you want it?" Ron asked. "Thought you'd memorized it by now."
"What's that funny clicking noise?" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.
It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.
He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.
“Huh- Flitwick? Never would have guessed. Anyway, I’m just glad it’s not-” Harry cut off with a groan when Gilderoy Lockhart stepped onto the stage, dressed in horrifying robes of gold lame. Behind him walked Snape, almost refreshingly dressed in his usual black.
"Can't go in there," said Ron gruffly. "That's a girls' toilet."
"This is a girls' bathroom," she said, eyeing the boys suspiciously. "They're not girls."
". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . ."
"She haunts a toilet?"
Canon is truly diverging a bit now! More coming soon
Cold, dark eyes glittered. “What about Mr. Nott?”
Once they were inside, they plunked him into a chair and stared at him.
Harry jumped. No… it couldn’t be…
"What do you think you're playing at?" he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, the Hufflepuff had turned and stormed out of the hall.
"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!" said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. "I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead -"
“We know you’re not, Harry,” Hermione assured him. “But it may cause people to think that you really are some kind of dark wizard. Slytherin lived over a thousand years ago- for all we know, you two could be related.”
“That’s not why he’s a Parselmouth, you know.” Another voice came from over her shoulder.
The rest of the party passed without incident, and they were finally stumbling back out of the dungeons on frozen legs. Ron’s buoyant spirits, previously dulled by hunger and cold, came back in full force as the air grew warmer.
It was Theodore Nott, the Slytherin seeker. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.
"Now, Harry," said Lockhart. "When Theodore points his wand at you, you do this."
"How are you, Myrtle?" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. "It's nice to see you out of the toilet."
"Quidditch practice!" said Wood. "Come on!"
“Flitwick maybe?” Hermione suggested. “He was a dueling champion in his youth, actually.”
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he'd been burned.
"Never thought I’d say it, but I’m rooting for Snape!" Ron muttered in Harry's ear.
He herded Harry and Nott into the centre of the room, gesturing for Snape to counsel Nott while he took Harry.
Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, "Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone's mopped it up."
Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.
When she reached it she said, "Hello, Myrtle, how are you?"
"What makes you say that?" said Wood testily.
"Pudding might not be finished yet," he said hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.
"I know," said Harry. "I mean, that's only the second time I've ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard -"
The two professors turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.
Harry looked around Ron to see Parvati Patil standing behind them, smile toying at her lips.
"I - don't - like - spiders," said Ron tensely.
Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, "Plenty of room for all of us, Wood."
"Allow me!" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack.
The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.
"No," said Harry, "Have you, Ron?” No response. “Ron?"
"I'm a what?" said Harry blankly. This felt oddly familiar...
Parvati be like: you're a Potter, Harry
Beside him, Ron’s wand shot from his hand and hit Flitwick between the eyes, banishing all thoughts of Malfoy from Harry’s mind.
Harry stared after the unlikely duo in confusion. Beside him, Ron was dying from laughter, and Hermione’s face said that her thoughts were racing a mile a minute.
Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something.
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ' "Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works.” He gave an overstated wink, and Harry rolled his eyes. "Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape-” Merlin, did this man have a death wish? “He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about
“Well,” she decided as Malfoy disappeared back into the mass of ghosts. “That was interesting.”
dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry - you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, never fear!"
“That went well.” Ron said.
His eyes eventually lit on the familiar head of blonde hair. Malfoy was mostly hidden by the crowd near the back of the hall, and when his name had been called out, he’d gone entirely stiff.
Ron spoke first. “Why didn’t you tell us that you’re a Parselmouth?”
Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves.
demonstrating! Let’s get a student pair up here! What about… Mr. Harry Potter, and- oh who’s that premier Potions student you’re always going on about- oh yes- Mr. Draco Malfoy!”
Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.
For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone's minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn't guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like "breathing loudly' and "looking happy."
They made their way over, unable to read the parchment from over the heads of the other students. It didn’t matter, anyway; Seamus began to fill them in the moment they arrived.
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.
"But I booked the field!" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. "I booked it!"
"No," Hermione agreed. "I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here."
Malfoy didn’t resurface in Harry’s mind until the first Friday of term.
"What d'you mean? You were there - you heard me -"
for upsetting Draco, so I came in here to cry, but he followed and told me that it was alright, that he knew I hadn’t meant to bring it up. He’s always so understanding, you know.”
"You've forgotten pimply," Peeves hissed in her ear.
Harry didn't have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything as they dragged him through the halls toward Gryffindor Tower.
I apologize for the amount of stolen lines in this chapter... Canon's just begun to diverge, sorry.
Snape's upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if the Potions Master had been looking at him like that he'd have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.
"What's going on?" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. "Why's that first year taking pictures? I don't like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program."
The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for her to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.
Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: "Expelliarmus!" There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light, and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.
"What, you reckon Slytherin's monster can duel?" said Ron, but he, too, had an excited glint in his eyes.
The bat-like professor moved closer to Nott, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Nott smirked, too.
But Lockhart wasn't listening. "Three - two - one - go!" he shouted.
"It's not funny." His tone was fierce. "If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick. You wouldn't like them either if you'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and... " He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh.
"My dear friends," he said mournfully. "Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased you could come. . . ."
"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight," insisted Hermione, glaring at Peeves.
You think I’m going to betray the only person who’s ever been nice to me just to satisfy your curiosity? You’re horrible!” She let out a wail and rose above the toilet, turning a loop and diving in. Water sloshed over the rim, and the Gryffindors jumped back.
Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches.
"What's that thing - hanging underneath?" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.
"Can you taste it if you walk through it?" Harry asked him.
"I don't mind them dead," said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. "I just don't like the way they move.”
The next development came as soon as the next morning, on the Quidditch field.
"Miss Granger was just talking about you -" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's ear.
Hermione smacked a hand to her forehead. “Of course! It’s considered a great ability to be able to speak to snakes, isn’t it?”
No wonder Malfoy looked so sick all the time, Harry mused. It was a miracle that the whole of Slytherin house didn’t have colds all year round.
“Harry, what're you -?"
“Yes, I made friends with one of the… Ravenclaw boys. He’s very shy, so we study in a little alcove in the library where no one can see us. According to him, Salazar Slytherin built the Chamber of Secrets to contain some sort of monster that could be unleashed by his true heir and purge Hogwarts of all he deemed unfit to study magic. Anyone like me, really.”
When he'd found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and left Gryffindor Tower, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder.
The idea of Malfoy helping someone, much less a Gryffindor, much less
it. But I want it for the same reason everyone else wants it," she explained. "To read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets."
"Is that supposed to be music?" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.
The rest of the disastrous “practice” was a blur of slurs and slugs, but this time, Malfoy didn’t disappear from Harry’s mind. He spent all of Lockhart’s detention (at least up until the strange voice that the professor apparently couldn’t hear) puzzling over a couple of questions that were slowly forming in his brain.
"But I'm not evil," said Harry, with a panic he couldn't quite explain.
Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.
The blonde relaxed a little, yet again in defiance of truth five (Malfoy would show Harry up whenever possible), and Lockhart smiled sportingly. “Oh, we certainly can’t have that! Who would you recommend instead?”
"Nibbles?" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.
His stomach lurched -
"Hello, Peeves," said Harry cautiously.
Neville nodded vigorously. “One time he even helped me in Potions! Stopped me from blowing up my cauldron again. I asked him why he did it, and he told me that he was too tired to deal with any explosions right now.”
"An absolutely miserable ghost- she haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor."
"She did -"
She shook her head. “I don’t think so, but I’ll give you the book if you want to find out who in your family could.”
Harry frowned as the two captains began to bicker, zoning out a bit as he argued with another fact.
"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
Mrs. Norris, the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.
Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris's fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.
For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, "Let's get out of here."
The next week was a blur of plans and preparations. Malfoy and Nott were both staying over hols (the latter in blatant conflict with truth eight: Malfoy was simultaneously a mummy's boy and a daddy's boy), so the trio decided that they’d use the potion then. A Filibuster Firework into a Swelling Solution during Potions had provided an ample distraction for Hermione to get the ingredients they needed from Snape’s cabinet, though Harry did think it odd how horrified the professor looked when Malfoy got hit with a face of it. (It became clear a moment later: no one else saw in the resulting chaos, but the boy hadn’t had the strength to hold his head up and had collapsed onto the floor.)
The others listening to the conversation nodded too, and Neville seconded Dean’s question.
Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.
“How much do you know about your family history?”
The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn't matter?
The boy wasn’t at meals, and anytime Harry saw him in the halls, it was when he had another class to get to. He couldn’t even tail the suspicious Slytherin after Potions because of how long it took to get to History of Magic from the dungeons!
"D'you want to tell me what's wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin's head?" he said. "What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn't have to join the Headless Hunt?"
"Whassamatter?" said Harry groggily.
"Ask her if she saw anything," Harry mouthed at Hermione.
“Who do you suppose is teaching us?” Harry asked as they wormed their way through the crowd, trying to find a good spot.
“So the thing about ‘enemies of the Heir, beware’- does that mean Slytherin’s heir?”
"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -"
Harry gaped at him.
"Flint!" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. "This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!"
Harry looked into the stands. Colin Creevey, the first year who’d taken to following him around, was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture. The sound was strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.
"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out," she said, sitting down next to Harry. "And there's a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn't left my copy at home, but I couldn't fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books."
October came swiftly, the days seeming to pass with a lot more ease now that Malfoy had decided to stop tormenting everyone who crossed his path. Charms and Transfiguration were easier without someone constantly heckling him, though Potions only got harder as Harry became more and more distracted with the increasingly ill health of the ex-bully. Others were starting to catch on as well.
Why did Malfoy look so sick? Why wasn’t he attending classes? Why didn’t he join Quidditch? Why hadn’t Harry seen him in the hallways?
“Oi, what d'ya think’s goin’ on with Malfoy?” Seamus randomly said over dinner a few nights before Halloween. “I didn’t notice for a while since the bloke’s been gone from most of our classes, but he looks like death’s head on a mop stick, doesn’t he?”
"This way," he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.
He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it.
The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.
"It was about here," said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch's chair and pointing. "Level with this door."
“I can lend you a book about Indian pureblood families if you’d like to know more,” she said matter-of-factly. “But the big thing is that the Potters have been one of the most prodigious lines when it comes to producing Parselmouths.”
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but the next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,
“Hey!” Annabee leaned back and glared.
Lily flinched again, “Harry, I lo-“
It was a fast friendship.
“Piers!” Hadrian blinked. “Nuture versus nature, do you know the answers?”
Lucius shooed Severus and the women out of the door swiftly after that and made his own greetings to the first-year students. “I’m Lucius, Draco’s father, and your mothers’ new lawyer. Do you two know why you’re here?”
“Kindergarten? I’m so proud of you, did you have fun my darling, darling?” His voice bounded and bounced with a doting tone. The red haired girl smiled dreamily as the little girl cheered, still holding onto her son’s arm as the three migrated out of the office. Alex following as soon as Lily nodded her ascent.
“Christmas, when he was nine. You screamed when I told him to let her wreak havoc on the neighbor’s mouse problem.”
Snape raised a brow and Draco blushed.
Draco grinned and Hadrian grinned back, before Severus cleared his throat.
“I will one day, and you won’t stop me.”
“School isn’t over yet; do you remember now?” The man shook his head.
“Laney used the distraction to catch an extra episode and stay up later. So far Anna’s keeping the tradition. Though more creatively. I found it in the freezer last night.”
Creeping out of bed, his body protested the movement. Especially his leg. The joint screamed at him viciously, and a peek under the sweatpants he knows he never put on revealed the abused flesh. His knee joint was a swollen and angry red mottled with dark purple near black bruising. Hadrian grit his teeth, a foggy recollection of a boot stomping on his leg.
“I’m home.” The humming stopped,
Sara walked closer and gently massaged her wife’s arm. Leaning into her partner and humming quietly. “Hush my love. We adopted Hadrian legally and have provided for him and raised him since he was seven. If they want to fight us. They can fucking
Or was that just when you thought I was a muggle-born gypsy oh great one.” Alex winced and wilted under her harsh sneer and Lily pulled him closer to her before giving a small smile.
-Bragging rights
-James is an auror and I could get destroyed
“No. Now get out.” Crabbe as the one closet to the door and on alert with Draco’s attention and aggression rose up and slammed the door back shut easily with one hand. Silencing her yelling and protests. “Good job Crabbe. You were saying Hadrian?”
“I’m Laney Esmerelda Dragma and he’s Hadrian Piers Dragma.” Snape gave a sharp nod.
“Worry not child, I won’t allow the Potters to interfere with your life. That’s why I’m here as your mothers’ legal counsel and I assure you in any legal battle I will win quite firmly. Draco would be rather cross with me if I didn’t. So, try not to worry. Be a child and have fun, study hard. I’ll finish up with your parents.” The red head girl grinned happily and bounced up and away, dragging the raven haired boy with her. Long ponytail flicking behind him like a cat tail.
“The two are siblings, both are first years in my house.” James said nothing behind his family but Lily gave another tense smile.
The ginger snorted, “Watch this, Suni. Kiss your daddy!” Immediately like a reptile on a mission Suni launched at Hadrian and coiled around his shoulders before pressing her snoot against his cheek. Hadrian just looked ahead with a fondly exasperated look, not running away from the snake kisses at all.
“He has an anxiety disorder, however we put him in weekly therapy for it. Have since we found out after we adopted him, and he showed trauma from his past abuse. Otherwise, I can’t see anything. He’s a normal kid, played football, went to school, played in the park with his baby sister and his twin. Got phenomenal grades, Sara was quite proud.”
“No, you shut the fuck up. The day you lay another hand on my son is the day I hand feed you your own internal organs!” The threat was a vicious hiss, her eyes glowed harshly as she slammed her hand on the desk. Severus mused. She was the magical influence then.
“You are with Crabbe, Goyle and I, I presume so. Laney can stay with us and her brother for the night.” The two siblings nodded easily, Hadrian’s arm slung around her waist and she grinned brightly.
If Dumbledore had adopted his child out to the Potters and twisted his mind almost beyond repair. Nearly killed him with muggle relatives and hardships at that blasted school, almost made Tom kill his own child. It wouldn’t surprise Tom if they learned Albus was the reason that he and his husband couldn’t remember their own son.
“Because Alexander and Potter are right di-“ Hadrian elbowed his sister swiftly in the ribs, making her wheeze. “very annoying people I meant. I’m assuming something happened with the Potters and our parents?”
Alex was nearly vibrating in excitement. When Harry had gone missing, he’d hounded for stories and pictures from his mother when his father failed to procure his brother back or give any descriptions. He was a little annoyed that he got ignored so easily, but maybe Harry was just shy. His mother had always said Harry was quieter than he ever had been. Soon enough Harry would be in Gryffindor with him and Ron though! Then he could room with his twin and they could catch up. Alex could just picture the stories they could tell each other deep into the night, Harry could apologize for leaving him.
Screaming, Hadrian grabbed onto his core with both hands and felt when the accio snapped off of him and something else tore at him. It felt like his atoms were being tore apart and shoved through a small tube before they were forcefully packed back into his body. Weightless, for a moment. Then he crashed back to the ground.
“Bodies are fluid, so I tweak myself depending on my mood. Kinda like when I’m working out and I get rid of the dick to be more comfortable. As for me now… sort of effortless, my scars are ugly so I smooth them over. But everything else is
The two were a sight to behold. The shorter woman was more stout, with caramel skin and brown curls that seemed to bleed warmth like a beach sun, her smile was easy and bright as another woman loomed over her. This woman was lean, with skinny but strong limbs and pin straight blonde hair that was held in a high ponytail on her head. Her eyes were cool and lips firmly in a blank scowl. Snape had to pause for a moment when the resemblance got a little two uncanny towards his newest duo of troublemakers. The shorter woman reached a hand out to him.
She missed her brother dearly already.
“Ah, and what’s your favorite classes?”
“Or what?” Hadrian smirked back.
Severus’ letter had come as a surprise to him. Meeting with him through the floo had been a meeting with an equal amount of surprise. A meeting that had filled him with equal parts hope and outrage. Hearing that James had lost custody and proceeding then to simply take it, it had infuriated him. When he’d tried and failed to gain custody as James abandoned his beloved little godson Harry. Harry-Hadrian who was no longer just a child.
Laney herself right now was kicking a football, dodging between Greg and Vince as she both taught them football and proceeded to curb stomp them at the sport. He knew later they were going to be teaching her Quidditch and it’d be their turn to dominate in a game.
Didn’t stop him from nearly crawling the walls the day the trial was set to begin.
“I spent months ruining Alex, fully prepared to target James next. And he did it for me. I’m almost disappointed.” Laney grinned and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist with an conspiratorial grin.
“What if that doesn’t work James?”
“That’s a bit like basketball on brooms, right? Not really, but sort of? Hadrian, I think has been interested in the dueling club, he doesn’t like heights. Laney however I think likes the idea of fly tackling someone in the middle of the air. She was quite good at football when she and Harry were on their pee-wee team. Oh, how cute they looked in cleats and Harry wore his hair in braids. I miss those days.” James smiled finally.
“Malfoy Manor is out of bounds. The Prince Manor will probably be under close watch, and our other properties have been sold or destroyed.” His lord sighed softly. “I can’t think of anywhere that would be inconspicuous. An inn could turn us out, anyone have a house, not on the records?”
-Ruins what’s left of the Potter standing (even without accusation and trial)
I'm going to be working on a new project, however, the difficult part is deciding which project I work on first. So I'll give you two summaries and if you have an opinion. HMU in the comments! The summaries will be in the chapter notes, I'm running out of room here.
Potter Manor stood proudly just as it always had when Sirius was younger. The wards curling and embracing him like an old friend, even where they were scorched at the edges. His godson’s brilliant work. The sky was dark, but when Sirius closed his eyes for a moment, he could still hear Charles’ laughter as he sat on the porch. Dorea yelling at them to come inside for dinner. James and him flying on their brooms and giggling madly as only misbehaving children could.
The tears fell silently down his partner’s tan cheeks as they always have. Draco took a step back to give his partner some privacy as his Uncle, Hadrian’s
Hadrian shot up and got to the other side of the room as James forced himself in. Alex grinning behind him and waving cheerily as if they hadn’t invaded his prison cell. Lily followed a bit more calmly and warily. She tried to smile calmly at him.
Hadrian stared, and stared, and
“Lady Potter and the Potter tweedledee and tweedledum trying to get their grubby hands on my brother and trying to wreck our family in the process is a little more than distressing. I want to punch her son in his smug little face half the time.”
Bitterness and anger and hate hate hate hate
If Alex really wanted to run around lying, Hadrian would enjoy
"Are you okay? I’m sorry you had to see that.” This boy, was more worried about him witnessing his memories of abuse then he was about being forced to remember what was probably a traumatizing time in his life. Severus grabbed the teen’s forearm, firmly but not aggressively.
Harry could use his guidance in seemed, spending so much time away from home had changed him for the worst. The girl next to him, he would have to phase her out of his brother’s life and the Malfoy’s son. Malfoy had been a death eater, one of his inner circle, before Voldemort’s demise and so he was both arrogant and dangerous. Alex also couldn’t deny the curl of jealousy and anger that rose up when Malfoy stepped closer to his brother. Occupying the space that should be either his or Ron’s. The girl he didn’t know, but he did know that he didn’t like the way she was hanging on his brother. Holding hands and wrapped around his arm like an octopus. It was shameless and disgusting, especially when she whispered next to his jaw and hoarded his entire left side. She was probably a muggle born that was hoping to leech off his fame through his brother and that just would not do. Especially as Alex watched his brother lean closer to her when she spoke and roll his eyes playfully. Gifting her all of his attention.
It was supposed to be better now!
An icicle had formed in his chest, sharp, cold, and aching as he held his husband. His magic lashed out dangerously, shattering one of Severus’ empty vials while leaving the impromptu cauldron alone and brewing in the corner of the room. His baby. His son had suffered, and Tom was going to make sure every guilty person was punished thoroughly.
Everything would be righted soon. He just had to wait.
“Mother, Father, Uncle Sev, My Lord. This is Hadrian, my boyfriend.” Understandably, seeing as none of them had known he was gay or taken, his father and the dark lord were shocked and still. His Uncle Sev was more reserved, but curiosity was in his dark eyes as he appraised Hadrian with careful eyes. His mother had no such hesitation. Reaching out immediately with a hand.
“I was hoping you’d know!” Sara laughed again. “He’s such a sweet boy, Laney’s a little devil. He really blossomed you know? When I met him he was this skinny and quiet, so quiet little boy. Bones that jutted out of his skin like they were trying to run away, bruises all over his face, and a glare that honestly unsettled me. I knew though, I knew that hurt people hurt others, usually not on purpose. So I pulled him into my fold, gave him a home, and watched him stitch himself back together. I never regret it. I love him so much.”
“With all the respect in the world, why are we here? You say the Potters regret their actions, but it was to protect Hadrian. But what child below Hogwarts age needs magic for protection? Alexander was at much at risk in their care, yet he was the one they kept. There is also the fact that we are trying to tear a child away from two mothers who have raised him and housed him with no aid from his parents who even after the adoption sent no letters, no yule gifts, no visits. Here we are trying to tear a son from the family that raised him legally and uncontested for four years and who is vocal in wanting to stay with his mothers. One who has even protested visitation with the family who abandoned him to muggle relatives without a glance back. Parents who are trying to use the effect their neglect had on him as a weapon in this trial against the parents who have done nothing by heal and treat Mr. Dragma as their own. Do you really want to destroy a family and return a child to a place they are afraid of going back to?” Albus looked enraged, especially as the thinly veiled ideas of disregard and the blatant proof of neglect had many of the Lords glancing piteously at the two mothers who were holding their three children tightly. Lucius suppressed a smirk, he was certainly confident off the get go Hadrian thought.
It looked exactly like Alex’s room.
The raven grinned as doors flung themselves open ‘by themselves’ and then slammed shut behind him. He’d stunned James, but that had really slowed him down in his desperate flight. He needed to just get past the wards, past the wards James would be caught if he cast a curse and Hadrian would be immediate apprehended for accidental magic. Either he’d escape and call the knight past, or he would catch the attention of the Ministry and let them handle it.
. It was unnerving really when Alex tapped on his shoulder and received that look. His eyes held nothing in them, not even a twinkle of the bright light that was in his mother’s eyes usually. He was unfocused, and Alex felt particularly insulted when instead of talking to him, the girl basically glued to his brother answered for him.
His mind wandered and pulled up his first memory with his little sister’s grey eyes.
“I wanna finish eating after we’re done.”
“What did you need me for? The rooms perfect!” Hadrian rolled his eyes and shoved Draco to sit on the end on the bed. Plopping down onto Draco’s lap so he couldn’t escape.
“Lucius please.”
“Annabee, been a good girl for Mama and Mother baby girl? Have you? Have you!” The girl squealed happily. Grinning when her brother nuzzled her cheek, soaking up his attention and love as their Mama and Mother walked in closer, stopping to stand beside Snape.
Immediately upon discovering where he was Hadrian pulled out his wand and locked the door. Whipping his head around his eyes caught onto a trunk at the end of the bed. The letters
Ah, Hadrian didn’t notice the mini circle that had formed around Alex and them. That was nerve wracking. Still, he pushed it away in his mind to focus as name after name was called until Crabbe was the first one up, heading to Slytherin and quickly followed by Laney who was happily Slytherin with Draco and Goyle. The red head threw her legs over the bench next to her with a cheeky grin. Ever confident he’d follow her.
Draco gaped and Severus’ hands shook. One reaching out to cup Hadrian’s jaw who was still confused, but perceptive enough to know something was happening and to stay quiet. His uncle stepped closer to Hadrian, letting the paper fall to the ground, which Draco’s father snatched up quickly, and held Hadrian’s face with both hands.
Hadrian cocked his head. “I don’t believe I know what that is, but it sounds like a decent idea. I called my mentor last night and took this week off in case you all needed me. Let’s say I had a feeling when you called me last night. So, my schedule is free.”
“I didn’t know Parseltongue was a kink.” Hadrian smiled sunnily at him.
“We’ll take care of it. It’s all a misunderstanding that can be cleared up nice and quick.” Sirius felt ill listening to them plot and plan against his innocent godson. The child who did nothing wrong, at least, nothing bad enough to warrant the abuse and the
“Twitches has a completely different context, different age, was a muggle movie of magic and I’m a man if you hadn’t noticed?” The red head giggled into her brother’s shoulder.
Why I don’t… Who would do this to you, to me?”
“This may not offer much comfort, but all my charges are under my care. They are my snakes and as such I won’t let anyone hurt them. Hadrian may have been my godson when he was a Potter if Lily had forgiven me for my mistakes. I owe him for not seeing what they’d done and letting my hatred of his father blind me to shielding him.”
“Mama!”
“Then buck up and act like it. C’mon.”
Snapping back, Hadrian bit his tongue hard. Shit. Maybe he did need more therapy after all if this was what happened when he stopped going… The raven shook it off. He just needed to survive this meeting with the headmaster and take it one day at a time.
“I think it’s stupid they don’t let you drop your last name if you don’t want it. Did you see the way Potter and the Weasels were looking at you like you were their next victim? It was like indoctrination, it was barbaric.” The girl, Laney Dragma from what he remembered scowled.
Even Lucius seemed shocked, before a gleam of delight filled his eyes. The final nail in the coffin.
“His name’s Hadrian, take a hint lady.” Hadrian gave a near silent snort and Snape patted her head.
Settling down. Hadrian stripped to just his thin button up and his slacks. It was better to do it naked, but if he needed a quick escape he’d need clothes so he didn’t streak through Potter Manor. (Though the idea of escaping James while buck ass nude did inspire a delirious sort of hysterical amusement). These were the lightest clothes here. Plus, he couldn’t bring himself to put on the hand-me-downs in the closet. He’d rather feel disgusting physically than subject himself the mental torture the past would conjure up in his mind. The circle was blood, but just in case, he held his hands up and keep his weeping injury skyward and began to mutter, feeling the circle closing and encasing him. Unable to move until it was finished.
All he had was a snapped wand with no core, and more bruises than he knew what to do with. Luckily, Hadrian had a good memory or his late night sneaking into the library would be for nothing. Drawing a ritual circle was easier if you had a picture, but he would make do, they either worked or they didn’t. Even so, disowning yourself from an old family bloodline was complex and complicated work-
“That would make a scene! I almost want to see that. But I rather like you two, so I think sticking with me would be in both of our best interests. I’ll teach you how to mix with the right sort. Are you… muggle-raised?” Draco said it with a slight grimace, but Hadrian appreciated the effort. A lot of pureblood families like the Malfoy’s had strict beliefs that would take time to break down. Laney spoke first.
“Really, well, I suppose if anyone bothers you Suni will put them in their place.”
“You act like our son isn’t just as pussy whipped by his baby sister. I seem to remember him insistently taking some of her midnight fusses, even if we were already awake.” Albus quickly interrupted, this wasn’t going the way he’d planned at all. He was going to have to recollect and regroup. Perhaps a little more forcefully this time.
The platinum blond looked so bewildered it made Hadrian tear into loud giggles, a hand clasped over his mouth to be as quiet as possible. Obviously understanding that he wasn’t getting it, Draco blushed a bright red all the way to his ears as Hadrian and Laney laughed hysterically, tears glittering in the brunet’s eyes when he finally calmed down and placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. The touch felt searing in the best of ways when he got a crooked grin.
Hadrian leaned back and examined his lists. Every second here was a chance for him to be injured. And even complying meant suffering under the hands of James cruelty and Lily’s ignorance. What did you pick when there were no good options left?
“I know, I know, desert lad. But, in the highlands of Dicia in the mountains, there is deep cold and snow. My mentor taught me how to ice skate there and I fell in love. I also burn like a white boy in the desert sun, so this is better yeah?” Severus spared the teenager a smile, examining the area, before looking under the ice itself. The area was oddly blank, normally teenaged minds were complex with memories and emotions. Severus could see the chunks of life that were missing, but the ice is what scared him.
The blood would stain deep and wouldn’t smudge when he had to throw the rug over it again. If he were to keep this a complete secret and only work at night, he would need at least three nights with clear skies and moonlight to finish painting all the runes. Then one night to do the ritual and run.
Malfoy takes the lead, walking past the Room three times. When the door appears, Harry wrenches it open and they crash through it, only to be greeted with an enormous bed. It's the biggest four-poster Harry has seen; big enough for four people, but what's even more surprising is the sprinkling of red rose petals, a contrast to the pristine white sheets. Even though there are no windows, the gauzy bed curtains ripple, as if welcoming them.
. Maybe I'll find out tonight.
"I navigate by sight and scent. Each part of the castle smells different." She fixes Harry with a beady look. "So what are you going to do about your biped?"
He takes it like he's Potter's own personal Slytherin slut, because he
"No, not like that!" Draco insists, looking up and clutching Harry's hand like a lifeline. He coughs, and Harry shushes him at once, gesturing for him to take a long drink of water. Draco does so, and a long, silent moment passes as Harry waits for him to recover.
Ron, Hermione and Dean are milling about the studio. Although Harry will need a few more pieces for a full exhibition, he has always invited his three closest friends for a preview and to gather preliminary feedback, especially from Dean.
Draco ignores him and continues walking.
"Perhaps you could clean yourself in the prefects' bathroom, and then get some food from the kitchens?" Draco suggests. "In the meantime, I'll think of something, maybe transfigure a few tables in empty classrooms into beds..."
“What if I never went to France? What if I stayed?” Malfoy wonders, a tinge of regret in his voice.
Speechless, Draco simply flaps a hand in the air. He has never been one for last minute surprises. "Because..." he trails off, noticing the impatient way Harry’s fingers are drumming against his thigh and the defiant tilt to his chin. Harry's phone chimes, but he pays it no attention; he’s so focused on Draco and his answer.
His heart racing, and a tingling shiver rippling through him, Harry props himself up on his hands and begins to thrust, hips rocking back and forth. Malfoy is a feast for his senses: his vanilla scent, the sound of skin slapping against skin echoing in the Room, jacking up Harry's pleasure to greater heights. The addictive warmth around his cock is overwhelming, and Malfoy looks so fucking good—blond hair on the pillow, that familiar flush building on his chest, which will eventually spread to his neck, even his cheeks, when he finally comes. His rosebud lips, so lush and plump as he cries out Harry’s name, and all of that glorious pale skin on display, just for Harry, only for Harry.
He doesn't know how long they stay there like that, Potter sucking him slowly and sensually, at the perfect pace and intensity so he doesn't come, coaxing moans and gasps from him. With every passing minute, Potter familiarises himself with Draco's cock, until he's mapping out Draco's sweet spots on the underside and just beneath the ridge of his cock.
Draco pulls the bag of crisps closer to him and fishes around for a decently sized piece. "I haven't had the time. Even if I do leave London, it's for work or to visit my parents in Florence. Paris is just one of those things that I like to think of. I'll visit it someday," he says, popping a crisp into his mouth.
"Sure, you’re all about minimalist bliss, cleansing your past and letting go. You're always so put-together," Potter's open hand slices through the air, gesturing to Draco's attire, "All neat, organised and so bloody proper, when your crumbling, abandoned Manor is still there. You might live in London now, and you can pretend everything's fine, but I’m not fooled. Are you ashamed of your own home, Malfoy? Ashamed by something that you were so proud of?”
And also, their last.
Harry knows that Kingsley's right. This is the major case — amongst other smaller cases — that they've been working on for more than a year. It's like a multi-headed Hydra, draining their energy and sapping their resources.
Rainwater trickles down between Draco's shoulder blades, and a shiver trembles down his spine.
He's not desperate to get engaged, but Draco's never been particularly good at waiting for presents. It's like waiting for the other shoe to drop, he thinks and stifles a sigh. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Harry edge a curious glance at him as they stroll along the river. They've just had dinner in a fancy restaurant, and Draco had thought that Harry would pop the question there and then.
“I’m Marjorie,” she says. Her strawberry blonde hair is tied into a neat bun, and her twinkling blue eyes, which remind him of Dumbledore, dart between Malfoy and him. There’s a small tattoo of two intertwined red roses on the inside of her wrist. She nods at his empty glass. “Can I get you another one?”
He spent two months here looking for inspiration, but he ended up finding so much more.
Hermione's gleeful grin softens into a smile. "Not to everyone else. I was wondering if you'd ever tell him."
For once, he doesn't know what to say.
"Can't stop, won't stop-"
There's a look of rapture on Ron's face as he polishes off his mousse heartily, making small moaning sounds the entire time.
And then Malfoy asks a question, the exact question that Harry so desperately wanted him to, all those years ago in the Room of Requirement when Harry had his hand on the doorknob with his heart breaking and Malfoy looking so lost, that question that Harry thought he'd never have the privilege to answer—
Harry breathes in the heady scent of vanilla and cherries, he can hear the noise of the crowd and the music but all of that fades away because right now, right here,
Harry sat down beside him.
Draco smooths Harry's hair back, but he's startled when there's a movement under the duvet. Harry's fingers wrap around his wrist.
It’s a romance that started across the pond, so far from home, and now Draco is back home, back in Harry’s arms, where he truly belongs. An emotion, so strong, so certain and so
"I want your come, every drop in me, come for me, Draco—" Harry pleads, his hands still locked around Draco's wrists and their eyes locking. Harry looks so fucking good, Salazar—
"Goddamn." Harry lets out a hot puff of air. Fuck, Draco is so ready and eager for him. He leans down and kisses Draco all over again, his hand going between Draco's legs. He starts to push in.
Malfoy rushes towards him, and even though Harry holds his ground, his opponent is on an all-out offensive. They trade a barrage of curses, and Harry is backing away to the middle of the courtyard, his wand whipping in the air with defensive charms, which is honestly not his forte. He ducks an
He lifts his chin, looking at the windows with their velvet curtains. He half expects the curtains to rustle and Mother to peer out, her face breaking into a smile every time Draco returned home.
Potter looks at him intently. "Yeah."
! Fuck it all into me, fuck your hot, hard cock deep in me till I come all over, god
Harry gapes at Ron, his arm falling away from the fruit basket, his banana forgotten. Ron is even attempting to smile, although his jaw is rather clenched.
"Got it," Potter says, and summons one of the Keeper's brooms. His face is grim with determination, eyes blazing behind his glasses, about to launch into his usual noble heroics. This time, Potter might not make it out alive, Merlin, flying on top of a full-grown dragon that's trembling with rage, he's lucky not to get roasted into a crisp.
People tend to dismiss a love like that — a love as subtle and gentle as soft hands and whispered words of adoration that shimmer and melt in the night sky when Harry is sleeping — but that doesn't make Draco's love any less beautiful, any less worthy, any less enduring.
"Hey, Draco." Harry's sunny voice rings from the recorder.
Malfoy smooths Harry's hair back, presses an affectionate kiss on his temple and wraps the duvet around them.
Draco's hands stutter in their circuit up and down Potter's body. His heart is beating so fast and hard with disbelief that he won't be surprised if Potter can feel it. He blinks, dazed. It's surreal, having Potter ready and waiting right here, right now, after so many fantasies and so many years.
"Thanks," Harry replies, ducking his head and rubbing the back of his neck. He clears his throat and adds, "Did Malfoy watch the match too?"
when I compliment you and you brush it away, saying things like
Potter’s lips curve up into a smirk. “Learnt from the best.” He tucks Draco into his arms. “Sleep. You need the rest.”
He waves goodbye to Malfoy, and leaves.
Harry shakes his head, getting rid of his Malfoy-related thoughts. His brows furrowing in determination, he folds up Hermione's letter and places it on top of a
He bends down to leaf through the cards accompanying the flowers — condolences and well wishes from both strangers and acquaintances such as Mr Davies from the used broomstick store across the street and Mrs Taylor from the neighbouring bookshop.
before beating a hasty retreat.
The wooden box is still tucked away in the last drawer, but there's two new additions in the box: the photo album that Hagrid had given to Harry in his first year of Hogwarts, and a white envelope stamped with a special golden Ministry seal.
He looks at Potter, who is gazing intently at him. Potter mouths
Draco’s grateful for the pause that ensues; Hermione’s giving him time to marshal his thoughts and get his emotions — anger, hurt, disappointment and resignation — under control.
Harry has heard this voice in his dreams.
"I'm gonna get my hands on a treacle tart, one way or another," Harry declares.
They're shown to a booth in the corner, and Draco is grateful for the privacy. The next hour and a half passed like a dream: service was prompt and friendly, although Draco didn't appreciate the waitress' lingering smile directed towards Potter when she took their orders. The food was wonderful, and conversation flowed as easily as the wine. It felt exactly like two mates having dinner, except...
“I would appreciate that,” she says, flashing Harry a watery smile. She goes to Draco, and after murmuring a grateful thank you to him, eases a sniffling Rose from his arms. She kisses Rose on the head, pulls on a Weasley jumper and a thick coat for her and puts her into her stroller.
"And your business being a new bloke every month or so, is it?" Malfoy continues, his eyes flashing in annoyance and restrained emotion trembling in his words. "I can't believe you dated Dennis Creevey, he was such a worshipper. I didn't know your ego needed that much stroking!"
He knows what it means when two Aurors come knocking on his door with their hats tucked under their arms, solemn expressions on their faces and bearing a white envelope stamped with a special golden Ministry seal.
Particular places in Hogwarts remind Harry of Malfoy as he walked through the school with his friends every day — a handful of classrooms that they used for their rendezvous; a stretch of wall familiar to Harry because Malfoy had pushed him up against it, his face pressed onto the cold stone and glasses digging into his skin while Malfoy's hands skated up and down Harry's back before pushing Harry's hair (he'd grown it out a bit longer this year because he loves how Malfoy cards his fingers through his hair) away from the back of his neck to suck at his skin.
"Usual dunderheads," Charlie echoes, laughing. "Channelling your inner Snape now, are we? Isn't it enough that you swirl your robes around like a giant bat like him? At least you wash your hair more often."
"You and him..." Ron says, gaping. "Here? Bloody hell, Harry!"
The Ministry eventually returned the deed to the Manor last year, but Draco has not been back.
"Yeah, sorry 'bout that," Potter says sheepishly.
His eyes wide in wonder, Harry repeats the motion, although he has to explore to find the right spot. Amazed, he gasps when pleasure ripples through Malfoy again. "Here?"
He loves how
"You're welcome," Draco says.
Draco blinks, a surge of interest filling his half-hard cock.
Merlin fucking hell.
Malfoy scowls. "You still don't get it, do you, Potter?
Harry stares.
Despite the fury bubbling up within him, Harry knows he can't do that, so he does the next best thing: chuck all his books into his bag, mutter a hurried excuse to his friends and stalk out of the Hall. Who cares what Malfoy ends up doing with those girls? He's hardly going out with Malfoy; they're just two boys who hate each other that meet up to talk a little and snog a lot. He doesn't even know what's going on in Malfoy's head half the time.
"Like how I'm finally taking it so good?" Harry says between pants while he fucks himself hard and fast on Draco's cock.
The playing-hard-to-get, pointy git!
Humphrey shuffles an inch closer towards Harry, although his wide and wary eyes are still trained on Draco.
Ron stops eating. Hermione fiddles with the corner of a page of her textbook.
"This is who I am, Harry," Draco says in a resigned monotone and dull eyes. "Death Eater. A Malfoy." He paws a trembling hand through his blond hair — as memorable and dazzling as Harry remembers — before his fingertips trace beneath his eyes and skate downwards to his pointed chin. His lip curls in disgust. "Salazar, I look like him, I still look like my father..." He grimaces, averting his gaze from the mirror.
This is what it means to be
It's certainly fancy here, but Draco would give anything to be with Potter right now.
"Let go, Harry," Draco whispers. "Their lives have ended, but yours hasn’t. Remember the dead by doing what they cannot anymore — live, and be happy."
It's obvious he hasn't been able to concentrate at all.
"Why the surprise?"
The beginnings of a blush forming yet again, Draco grabs the roses and hurries out of the Hall. Potter’s eyes are on him, and the remaining knots of students dissolve into excited whispers. He’s got enough time to deposit the flowers in his room before heading to the classroom — he’s certainly not going to leave this in his office or classroom for his students’ gawking pleasure.
"Everest isn't doing too well, and this time, they reckon he's really gonna go for good. I got a letter a few days back, told me I better hurry back to say my..." Charlie swallows thickly and takes a fortifying gulp of tea. "To say my final goodbye."
Malfoy shoots the crowd a feral grin which melts into a moan when the black mamba slithers down his arse, loops around his crotch and makes its way back up, pausing momentarily when Malfoy stands up. It settles heavily across Malfoy's outstretched arms, shoulders and neck; at last, the music fades, both snake and man bow to thunderous whoops and disappear back-stage.
The bakery reminds Harry of his friends: Luna’s hand-made fairy lights in the shape of whimsically-designed fairy cakes twirl all over shelves brimming with biscuits and sweets; a Transfigured lion draped in Gryffindor colours — from Professor McGonagall — meanders between desserts and trots towards the bottom corner of the display counter; and posters of rainbow-coloured cakes, macarons and dancing doughnuts hang from the walls, collected by Hermione during holidays with her family. Courtesy of Neville, a floral bouquet sits on every table, adding a splash of colour and fresh fragrance. There's a special table placed much further from the other tables — Harry would enlarge it for Hagrid whenever he came to visit. Tucked away in a corner is a play-area with toys, picture-books and crayons for Teddy.
?! You want me to
It’s coming out all wrong.
Draco practically melts into the bed.
"I'd really like it if you came back. I think we've got a lot to catch up on, yeah?" Harry says, and there it is again, that flicker of a glance towards Draco's lips.
Draco opens and closes his mouth, speechless for a moment. He lashes out in exasperation, much to the amusement of their colleagues. "Your skin is as thick as a rhinoceros, Potter! Why do you always infuriate me, even when we're... we're..."
"I've got to work today, but would you like to stop by the shop later? I could show you what I'm working on, and we could go out for lunch — somewhere Muggle — if you'd like," he says, his fingertip pausing in tracing circles on Harry's forearm.
"Better?"
Like Minerva said…
"Look so good, feel- oh
With his smug grin still in place, Potter lifts his legs up and tucks his arms behind his knees, telling Draco exactly how he would like to be fucked.
“I want to look at it. I saw my name.” Draco lunges across the bed, but Potter springs forward, wrapping his arms around his bum to pull him back.
? I've paid for my mistakes! I've paid by starting from the bottom on the stripper pole, getting
Those exact words, said in that same breathy manner, transports Harry back in time to a Hogwarts classroom on that fateful night. Before he knows it, he's speaking, conjuring his words from the depths of his memory. "It's when I'm fucking you so hard and good that you forget your name."
of his strokes.
Harry thinks fast. “It’s alright, Ron and I have tickets too,” he lies — Ron can bloody well get a pair for them. “Maybe we could go together, the four of us?”
Malfoy fidgets.
The taste of tears on his lips prove otherwise.
Malfoy places the finishing touches on his eyes, puts the pen down and meets Harry's gaze. "And what will the prize be?"
That night, neither of them slept well, tossing and turning, too aware of each other's proximity in the shared bed, lost in the thistles of their own thoughts, suppressed desires and mismatched expectations.
"No, I don't. But I'm willing to try most things, mmmm, the more I think about it, the more I definitely want to try that. That's the most pleasure you’ve had? Well, Harry, I'm gonna triple that tonight and every night. I want you to bend me over a park bench at night, and you're fucking me so good I'm screaming. You've seen a jogger around, perhaps a few other couples about, and you know you should stop before anyone catches us, but you can't, 'cos you feel so good in me, I'm so good for you, so damn good," Malfoy whispers, his voice low and smoky, dripping with sex and syrup.
Without a word, they turn and walk off in opposite directions.
"I want things to go back to how they used to be!" Draco demands. "I want us to talk at night, I want you to tell me jokes and funny things and make me laugh. I hate it when things are awkward between us, I want—"
" Malfoy grins coquettishly. "If I win, I get a night with you. With
The chime of the oven jolts Draco from his memories and he peers inside the oven, pleased when he sees Harry's treacle tart coming along nicely. In a while more, the tart will be finished and he'll have a reason to pop over to Sugarcoated. Draco looks at his counter — the neglected chocolate in the bowl and the disarray of half-finished fairy cakes and tarts.
Malfoy looks conflicted. “Besides wondering what you’re doing here?” He opens the door, and enters his flat. "Goodnight, Potter," he whispers, his eyes midnight with sadness.
"Our first year. D'you remember the dragon you saw that was born in Hagrid's hut? It's the same one." Potter breaks off to cast another spell. "Got Charlie to bring it to Romania.”
Harry kisses Malfoy’s smile all over again, wanting this night to last forever.
"I was there. Galerie Green," Draco says, mentioning the opening date of the exhibition. "I was under a Glamour, and besides, it was easy to miss me; you were busy with your friends and the reporters. But you were distracted the entire night.” Draco’s thumb strokes the inside of Harry's wrist. "Like you were looking for someone." He draws in a breath, words hiking up into a faint question, as if he didn't dare to hope. "Like you were looking for… for me."
"You're so hot," Harry says to himself loudly in the mirror, seeing not familiar green eyes but eyes of sparkling blue. "You're so hot that someone wants to drip ice-cream on you and lick it all off. Now go out there in front of a horde of horny men and get.. your... fucking... kit... off," Harry finishes, punching the air rather weakly.
Afterwards, he holds Malfoy close, committing his vanilla scent, the warmth of his body and the rhythm of his breathing to memory.
Maybe it's time to come home soon.
Despite that thought, Draco has already popped open the button of his trousers, and his hand appears to have a mind of its own, sending half-hearted strokes along his prick. He should wank in the privacy of his room, but he’s already fantasising about tugging those tiny pants down Potter’s hips and swallowing him—
It's barely ten minutes, and Malfoy is shouting at him. He knows it’s easy for Malfoy to pin the blame on him, and he reins in his temper. Uncertainty takes centre stage, and Harry chews on the inside of his cheek. "So, I should… leave?” he asks, his voice small.
A weight eases from Draco's heart. "I'm scared, because I..." Unable to say this to Potter’s face, he buries his head into the crook of Potter’s neck, murmuring the words into his collarbone. "I want this so badly. I want to be with you. If you ever get a tattoo with today’s date, I want you to look at it with love, and not regret and anger. I want it to last. I'm sorry for being unreasonable, but I'm scared. So damn scared."
"Good. Do not make me throw my new book at you."
"Are you really going to?" Charlie grins, although he’s still tugging on his dragon earring. "It's about bloody time, then."
Hermione squeals and launches herself into his arms, while Ron grins. "It's about time, mate."
The door swings open—
Draco can't stop staring at the single crack in the teapot.
"I- I- Draco,
A swooping sensation fills Draco's belly at that realisation.
He was an absolute fool for thinking that one night would be enough.
"No, two hands on the broom. Pork Chop will be with you. She'll do the powder. She's seen us do this at the sanctuary. Tell her this," he says, and Potter does so.
Pansy releases a heavy sigh. "I'll miss you." She curls her hand around his and squeezes once.
His grey eyes half-lidded, Malfoy begins to take each chocolate-dipped finger in his mouth, his Adam's apple bobbing as he sucks, tongue peeking out every so often to lick at a fingertip or at the web of skin in between his fingers. Harry imagines having that hot wet tongue and perfect pink lips licking other... things.
, so much and so good that he didn't even know it was possible, his orgasm tearing through his body, triggering starburst after starburst of ecstasy exploding on his heated flesh, behind his eyes, and all because of Harry, Harry,
Harry huffs. Bloody Slytherins and their riddles.
Draco laughs. "Stop? Oh no. You taste too good to stop." He runs his fingertips lightly along Potter's shaft. "So easily satisfied. And I haven't even deep-throated you yet."
Draco reaches up to loop his wrists around Harry's neck, pulling him down. He yanks off Harry's glasses — Draco loves doing that and staring deep into his eyes. "You put on such a good show just now," Draco murmurs. "I was watching everything, touching myself. But you started it first." He kisses the side of Harry's mouth.
Draco sucks in a sharp breath and slowly releases it. "I… I would like Potter to tattoo me."
Draco had answered, to which Harry barked, "Cancel it," and nudged the opening of his boxers to reveal his impressive erection with pre-come already gathering at the tip. Harry must've finished the recording that very day and—
"Together?" Filius supplies.
Harry's vision blurs as fresh tears gather in his eyes.
"Would you like to see what I'm working on?" Malfoy offers rather shyly. Harry knows that it's not an offer to be taken lightly — when he's working on something new, he refuses to show it to anyone, even Ron and Hermione, before it's perfect.
Harry only shrugs and continues washing up, letting the conversation fade away. He waits until his friends are preoccupied with their own activities before turning his attention back across the street. He watches as Zabini and Parkinson wave to Malfoy, pull on their coats and exit Sin. He looks back to Malfoy in the shop...
He’s not denying it.
A visible shudder ripples through Potter. His eyes are midnight with sadness, a tell-tale tremor in his voice. "Sirius... he said something like that before. About us not forgetting." He sucks in a shaky breath. "The ones who love us... they don't really leave us, that we can always find them..." He slowly raises a hand, pressing his palm to his heart. "In here."
"Um," Harry hedges, buying for time while he pulls on a sweater and jeans. He's not sure what's going to happen when Malfoy sees him in his own body. "It's pretty late and I wouldn't want to-"
It mustn't have been easy for Harry to create something like this.
"We went back to Hogwarts for our eighth year," Harry says, remembering that Malfoy didn't. "We helped to repair the castle after the..." A dark look passes across Malfoy's face, and he quickly amends his words. "After everything."
They're seated on the floor of their flat, finishing breakfast. Draco stretches his legs on the carpet in the living room, his toes clenching inside his socks. "Why would I tell him anything?" He polishes off the last of his croissant and rubs his fingertips together to shake off the crumbs. "Simply because I’ve harboured feelings for him for longer than expected?"
"Happy birthday, Draco," he says.
Humphrey raises his head and ruffles his feathers importantly.
With that, Draco lowers and tilts his head, his tongue flicking out to lick the pre-come on Potter's leaking cock. He holds Potter's gaze while he does it, dragging the flat of his tongue up to the crown, pressing down on the slit. He smiles when Potter hisses and bucks his hips up. Potter’s fingers card through blond hair, and his foot shifts, pushing on the seat of Draco's chair to give him some stability as he thrusts gently into Draco’s mouth.
Someone clears his throat behind Harry; he's holding up the line. Muttering an apology, he nabs a banana from the basket and scurries forward, pointing at some spag bol.
“Do you cook everything that is served at the canteen?” Potter pipes up.
"Barcelona," Harry says at once.
properly. He had no references, and he was particularly good with snakes, as if he could talk to them.
, his words spiralling to a war cry of
“Two years on, I heard about the vacant Defence position in Hogwarts. Mother was doing much better in France, and she had Pansy around too. Pansy joined me a few months after I left Britain.” Draco smiles at the mention of his best friend. “And I missed home. So I wrote to Minerva, expecting her not to give me the time of the day, but she did. I went for the interview, and I got the job,” Draco finishes, exhaling deeply and replacing the shampoo bottle.
Harry remembers the moment he heard about the attacks, and he probably always would. He tells Draco so.
, he watches the half-lidded green eyes peering up at him beneath a mop of messy black hair, Harry’s cheeks hollowed out as he sucks, and oh sweet Salazar, at his own cock sliding in and out of Harry's beautifully stretched mouth, those luscious pink lips smeared with pre-come and saliva and treacle-
The only things on the table (besides the tart) are a thick book and the usual condiments. Hang on, the book looks familiar… He leans forward and squints at the spine.
— that had complicated the stars.
"Bet that's all you know about my food preferences, yeah?" Potter says, a challenge apparent in his voice.
“I’ve got some things,” Harry says. He turns to Darren, one of his older and more experienced students. “Lead the class in warm-ups while I help Professor Malfoy get ready.”
His eyes still glued on the words, Draco drops his essays on his table and shrugs his robes off. He goes to his bed, glancing at the roses kept in a vase, before sitting down and palming his prick through his trousers. He flips to the centre of the mag, licking his lips as his gaze roams the familiar sex scenes involving tanned men with messy black hair and round glasses. Before he can get too re-acquainted, his watch chimes, informing him that today’s Duelling Club will start in thirty minutes, granting him enough time for a shower and a quick skim of the content.
"You know what?" Harry says, his anger quickly matching Malfoy's. "I think I can find my way back from here, thanks."
“Yes, he certainly did.”
A piece of his aching heart will always be reserved for Malfoy, just like how a corner of Malfoy's heart will always have Harry’s name carved on it.
George punches the air with a triumphant fist and scampers off downstairs to his hiding place near the WonderWitch aisle. He doesn't have to wait long before Malfoy emerges from his lab, his grey eyes stormy and scowling in exasperation. Harry, who had been in the midst of siphoning the potion from his person, turns to face him.
Harry shudders when rain trickles between his shoulder blades.
Draco waited for his longing to run its course, hoped that his feelings for Potter was as ephemeral as breaths on frosted glass, like memories losing their intensity, paling and fading away with the passage of time. Draco musters up a bland smile and says, “I’m a very private person, as you should know, especially about family matters. Only Pansy, and of course, Robards knew. Everything happened so quickly, I just…” He shrugs. “Things happen.”
could understand. Harry had just as well admitted point-blank his true identity to Malfoy; and Malfoy clearly knows it, judging by the triumphant sparkle in grey eyes and his widening grin.
, Draco wants to say, but he can't, he absolutely can't.
Potter wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. “Unlike us. We were a right nightmare to Hooch, yeah?” He tosses the bottle on the grass and sits down on the stands beside Draco. “With Neville’s Remembrall,” he adds, chuckling.
Malfoy's smile evaporates at once, and Harry's cock, blatantly displayed, twitches when Malfoy finally drops his pretence, his expression morphing from cool and collected to hungry and aggressive.
“Yes, just for you, all for you, only for you," Draco babbles, gasping in a breath when Potter slows down to vary the speed and rhythm of his thrusts.
Whatever inside is heavy and shaped like a book. Draco’s excited already, he loves receiving books as presents, and from the many conversations he’s shared with Hermione, he has a sneaking suspicion about the identity of the book. With eager hands, Draco yanks the wrapping off.
The ramrod tightness of Draco’s body slowly uncoils, and he begins to lay out each item from the box. This jumble of things means nothing to anyone else, but they mean the world to Draco. "I took these before I last left the Manor," he says. He doesn't look at Potter as he talks, not wanting to see the pity in his face. It's easier like this, as if Draco is spilling his memories to an empty room.
Harry's throwing down his gauntlet, and there's no way in hell that Malfoy will back down from a challenge like this.
He almost expected a fully alive and kicking Harry and Ron to jump out during Shacklebolt's speech and croon
Potter’s gaze follows when Draco oh-so-slowly trails one arm of the glasses down the middle of Potter’s chest, his abdomen, down to the dip of his navel, and then back up again.
He should have known that nothing was easy when it came to Harry Potter.
"Yeah. After Barcelona, he started asking again, and he was even more on edge." Ron pauses. "Although he hasn't been coming for pub nights lately. Probably preparing for the wedding, or avoiding something, I reckon."
A pause, and then the audience erupts into raucous shouts of approval and applause. Matt's clapping, but Malfoy isn't; instead, the side of his mouth curves up slightly, throwing Harry a lingering, appreciative look under half-lidded eyes. Malfoy fishes a cherry from his cocktail, pops it into his mouth and sucks
Harry smiles wryly to himself. He glances at his watch, and then at the grand staircase, where some people trade air-kisses for goodbyes.
It's bloody surreal to be having dinner with him.
Eventually, Draco packs up the small pile of toys they've extracted from the bag. "They should be finished. Shall we leave?"
It was a refreshing change having Charlie around. Sure, Draco got on well enough with the other teachers, but they were so much older. Although, it appears that the average age of the faculty would be dropping again, with the addition of—
The thought of shooting his load in Malfoy is what drives Harry over the edge. "Fuck!" He comes hard inside Malfoy, wide-eyed and unbelievable starbursts of pleasure reverberating within him from head to toe. He releases a long groan, and then eases out, his come trickling out from Malfoy.
"I've done enough saving. I just don't want to lose you."
"This is what it's been like the past seven nights. Think it's fun, d'you, this teasing? Well, two can play at this game. Enjoy your orgasm,
Potter’s always liked breaking rules.
"Call me that, and I will hex you all the way back to Romania," Draco warns. He drops his gaze down Charlie's body — he might be in robes, but Draco knows how defined his muscles are, thanks to his work at the dragon sanctuary over summer hols. He’s fit (even with all the freckles), there's no doubt about it, but Draco will never see him in that way.
"Well, since you put it like that..." Bacon says, tossing his head and puffing himself up rather importantly.
"Think of the most pleasure you've had," Malfoy says.
"Fuckin' hell," Potter mutters after he's caught his breath. "I thought you wouldn't want to..."
"Welcome to Sugarcoated, then," Harry said and promptly kissed him. After a prolonged snogging session over the cooling mince pies (it was unfortunate that Weasley and Granger had entered at that moment), Draco quipped rather breathlessly, "I hope you don't give all your customers a welcome like that."
"That’s the only thing you took away from that?" Malfoy laughs weakly.
"Still too early to say yet, they're barely one month into the Academy." Robards cracks a rare smile. "No need to sound so defensive over McAllister. I have learnt to trust your recommendations.”
"Draco's a bit young to own a club like this, isn't it?"
He rubs the heel of his palm against his chest, sighing. "This notebook…” he says, thumbing through it. "When classes got too boring, Pansy and I would write in it and pass it back and forth. We wrote all sorts of things. Short stories, complaints, musings... anything and everything." Draco lands on a random page with Pansy's handwriting,
Harry squawks.
"Thanks," Harry says, breath hitching. This is the first time they've spoken since the night of the auditions. Anticipation's rising in Harry like a high-speed elevator.
When he’s finished towelling himself off, a grinning Potter unrolls a thick mat and plops it on the ground, before collapsing onto it, his limbs sprawled out like a happy starfish.
If he could do that, then he could do this.
Intrigued, Aurora flips open the small card pinned to the fragile folds of the bouquet. Draco looks away to give her some privacy. He turns back at her chuckle, his eyes widening when she places the roses in his arms, winking. "Owls never get it wrong."
"I know," Harry says, gently pushing Malfoy’s hand away. "I'll go slow. Make you feel good real soon, hit that spot you like so much." He lines his prick up again and applies the same strategy that he did with his fingers; pushing in and out, before plunging deeper and easing out again, until he's entirely engulfed, his throbbing cock deep in Malfoy. It's fucking brilliant, with Malfoy feeling like the most luxurious, sensual silk wrapped around his cock. “Let go,” Harry says, gesturing to Malfoy’s arms. “Want your legs. Around me.”
Draco is secretly relieved at the change in topic. He’s still an outsider when it comes to Hogwarts's Golden Trio, so it's strange to give her advice about Potter. He makes a sound of annoyance. "Some of my clients need a proper kick up their arses. Pointlessly clinging to letters and gifts from ex-lovers that mean nothing, and then sobbing into their shirts when sentimental things trigger a landmine of nostalgia and memories long gone. Salazar, I had to make the daughter a cup of tea in her own home!" he exclaims, punctuating his disbelief by widening his eyes.
Potter looks beautifully conflicted.
Disgruntled all over again, he meets Malfoy's gaze, which sharpens when Harry juts his chin out combatively. "I deserve the tart, just like everyone else here!”
Draco laughs. “No, I think you’re more than capable enough to sort this out.” He’s heard from his older students that Potter is much more hands-on than Rolanda, attending Quidditch team trials for all the Houses.
Harry gets off the bed. It's difficult, he knows, when confronted with the raw truth of things, so he's not surprised at Draco’s lashing out, but that doesn’t make it hurt less.
“I’m gonna get my treacle tart,” he mutters, scraping his chair back and standing up. He pushes up his sleeves. “You want any?”
“I want to hear what you're thinking as you're working it out," Potter says.
— as they travel all over Draco's face.
Bacon slithers over to peek in the fridge and draws back to look at Harry, his eyes narrowing in glee.
Ron winces. "Ah."
Harry obeys at once; Draco's staring
Draco Malfoy has never been good at waiting.
"Malfoy, god
He starts first with the desk, but the search is fruitless. Next, he turns his attention to the walls, the curtains-
When Harry's lips curve up into one of those sunny smiles that Draco has only ever dreamt of, Draco's world falls away.
He makes a good show of licking the come on his lips.
Marjorie's parents were Death Eaters killed by the Order. She's too young for Harry to tell her details, but he knows he has to, some day.
The tinny sound of a Christmas melody rings through the cafe, jarring Harry from his thoughts. Ayumi laughs when a young girl presses a switch on a tiny sleigh to play another festive song.
"After all that's happened, it's a fitting way to end this, isn't it? With your cock up my arse? You don't know how much I want it, want
Although most of the students are in the air, with more accomplished fliers circling a small area of the pitch, Potter is also keeping a watchful eye on four first-years — three Gryffindors and one Slytherin (Leo Thompson) — who are kicking a ball around. They’re not divided into teams; they’re still familiarising themselves with running and passing the ball to each other.
The students have arrived.
"No," Harry murmurs, willing his heartbeat to slow down as he places his fingers on the other man's jaw, forcing Malfoy to meet his gaze. "I'm fucking mad for it now."
"Yeah." Harry picks up the other two tickets. "I'm hoping you still like animals and haven't gone to the zoo yet, because these are tickets valid for this month. I bought them a few days back on a whim, hoping you’d go with me, so… are you free next Saturday night?"
And there Harry is, amidst clouds of cocoa powder, fitting in seamlessly with his surroundings. There's chocolate smeared all over his lips and cheeks, chocolate stains on his shirt and puffballs of flour in his hair. He absently licks the chocolate off his fingers and tears through a book propped up on his counter.
However, he can’t ignore the elephant in the room, can’t disregard Malfoy’s occasional bouts of irritability, can’t overlook the inscrutably haunted look that darkens Malfoy’s troubled eyes sometimes, most notably when they were having dinner and the table beside theirs was a family of three — parents and a boy, all of them blond. Malfoy spent the meal in discomfort, barely nibbling on his food.
"Him? Well, he's not too bad, I suppose," he says, shrugging his shoulders in an attempt at nonchalance.
"Stay," Draco says. Harry's heart soars—
And just like that, the tight knot in Harry's heart eases.
, because he most certainly did not tell Charlie what happened between them during their time in the Academy. Besides, who knows what Potter told Charlie... after that...
"Fuck you,
“What?” Harry sits up at once. “Is there something on my face?” He rubs a hand over his face and through his hair, just in case there’s a stray leaf caught somewhere.
He enjoyed his time at Belem, strolling past small cruise boats docked at the Doca do Bom Sucesso, people whizzing on roller skates and tourists in sunglasses lounging on the steps outside the Belem Tower. There was a lively three-piece band playing Muggle rock songs, and Harry had a good time listening to them.
With puffy eyes and gritted teeth, he fumbles for the clipping of the
Malfoy’s eyes gleam with interest, and he tells Harry to wait. When he’s finished cutting, he puts down the knife, summons a bowl of salt (with a lot more flourish than before), and begins to part the cuts on the salmon with his left thumb. Harry stares at the way Malfoy’s thumb strokes the tender fish, and at the hypnotising turn of his right wrist as he sprinkles salt on the cuts. He scatters a last pinch of salt on the fish and pats it. Harry gazes at Malfoy’s fingers resting on the salmon.
In time with the music, Draco bends over and pulls his briefs down for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it second.
It's only when Harry's shoulders slump and a thin, reedy laugh issues from his mouth that Draco realises he's said something terribly wrong.
!” Harry exclaims, reaching a hand towards Draco when the other man brushes past him on his way out of the kitchen. With a defeated air, Harry takes his glasses off and covers his closed eyes with a palm.
“Malfoy. Or should I say, Black?” Harry replies, his tone equally even.
Draco looks up when Weasley, seated on Potter’s left, clears his throat. Weasley raises an eyebrow at him, and Draco flushes in embarrassment. He looks away, turning his attention to the game and keeping it there. Well, for most of it — his focus wavers whenever Potter groans in disappointment at Puddlemere’s goal or cheers in delight when a Magpies Beater deflects the path of Puddlemere’s Seeker with a well-placed Bludger.
"Then you know what this means," Draco murmurs.
Harry starts to ride him proper, leaning back to brace his palms and balls of his feet on the bed. Malfoy's eyes skitter from Harry's bouncing cock and floppy mop of black hair as he fucks himself on Malfoy's cock just the way he likes it, to the way his lips are parted and panting Malfoy's name, his legs open in such a wanton manner, at Malfoy's cock sliding in and out of him, and this is exactly what Harry wants, knowing that Malfoy's watching and burning this memory into his mind so that whenever Malfoy closes his eyes in bed, this will the only thing that he sees-
"Gotta make it last," Potter grunts, his palm sliding feather-light over the throbbing veins under Draco's wrists.
"Sometimes, yeah," Potter replies, the needle continuing its relentless drag. "Wizards aren't really used to needles, compared to Muggles." A corner of his lips hikes up in a grin. "I might have killed Voldemort, but that doesn't mean people trust me completely when I'm going to pierce their skin with a noisy machine."
Draco does the only thing he knows.
"Always a joy talking to you too, Malfoy."
And it's all that Harry's ever wanted.
Both of them fall silent in the afterglow, because no words can describe how intense the sex had been —
"Thank you." Pansy gives him a grateful smile.
A pause.
"Yeah. It'll need a lot of work," Harry sighed, clutching at the sketch of his dream bakery.
Harry looks for a long time at the ring on Draco's hand. He transfers his gaze to Draco, who meets his eyes with a steady gaze of his own.
Sighing, he stretches in this luxurious bed in the expansive hotel room, his limbs splayed out like a basking starfish. The sheets are crisp, the bed soft, and the balcony offers a panoramic view of magical New York. The most distinctive and tallest building in the horizon is the sleek headquarters of the
They laugh and dance their way back to the entrance, finally obtaining shelter at a quiet spot in the garden. They're drenched, with their clothes sticking to their bodies. Draco discreetly checks out Harry's bare torso as Harry lifts up the hem of his shirt to wipe his face. His glasses are free of rain — he must've imbued his glasses with an Impervius Charm.
He squeezes Malfoy's fingers. "Hi," he whispers, a shy smile blooming on his face, his nerves flittering.
"Right, right, the mood's all set," Potter says impatiently. "Now fuck me, won't you, preferably sometime within the year?" He bends over at once, his elbows pressed against the surface where people slide their trays as they progress along the line. He arches his back and spreads his legs wide, presenting his arse to Draco, who steps behind him.
"I am familiar with those terms, and I am aware of their convenience, but I'd rather stick to owls," Draco says, sniffing.
"No wonder our Muggle clients have stopped coming back," Potter calls out, laughing when Pansy responds with a rude gesture. He pats her on the shoulder, and Draco looks away, his lips pursed. He steps back and crosses his arms in front of his chest, jealousy forming a sudden, bitter knot in the pit of his stomach. A long time ago, he wanted to be Potter's friend, but in multiple twists of fate, Pansy is the one whom Potter now shares easy banter with. But Draco hates how petty he feels, so he swiftly bats his envy aside. After all, their friendship—albeit rocky at first—has developed because they’ve set up shop and worked together for the past three years.
A heartbeat of silence passes.
“Discipline me next time,” Harry says, barely managing the words as he sheathes himself in one sleek, smooth glide. His voice drops to a raw, hoarse whisper. “Tie me up, blindfold me. Those red silk ribbons.” He swallows, pulling out and punctuating every other word with a hard thrust. “Do whatever you want to your Gryffindor. Just wanna make you feel good.”
During the past two years (Charlie joined the faculty a year after Draco), Draco has grown to be rather fond of him. Things started out awkward and stiff between them, but it gradually developed into acquaintanceship, and finally, friendship. Also, as far as Weasleys went, Charlie is probably the best one out of the lot — Draco had the least contact with him.
Malfoy licks his lips, and Harry's eyes follow the dart of his tongue. Just looking at him is enough to remind Harry of that tongue lapping at his prick. There’s a distinct whiff of vanilla, and Harry's cock begins to fill. Malfoy leans towards him, tilting his head—
"Greedy arse. Let me take care of this, yeah?" His speed on Draco's prick increases, but Draco moves away and begins to take off his clothes.
The music shudders to a stop, and as the pair take their bows, Harry can't stop staring at Malfoy. He's the very personification of sex — all long legs, pale skin, filthy mind, wicked tongue and parted lips, and under that saucy confidence and breezy bravado is a man that's a fucking
—" Potter chokes out after pulling off when Draco nudges a second finger in him. "Christ, this is— oh
quickly," Jacob says. Normally, Harry would have questioned Jacob further about his last comment, but Harry's brain isn't working normally because he's turned his attention back to Malfoy, who's sliding a palm down the left side of his waist, thumb and forefinger pinching the top of his black briefs, pushing them down just a few inches, and if Harry manages to snatch a peek of Malfoy’s cock...
"Oh," Malfoy whispers, looking around. They're at the exact spot where they were on their first visit, but Harry pays minimal attention to the glittering scenery laid out in front of him, because he's only interested in one thing.
"Yes."
There Draco Malfoy stands, guitar slung in front of him, staring straight at Harry.
Humphrey relaxes and settles down, purring in contentment.
"Would be easier to… to rim you, if the chance came up tonight. Your thighs are ticklish.”
Draco's eyes dip towards it —
Harry shouts, silver light shooting out from his wand. The only pronounced effect the Tickling Charm has on Malfoy is a loud, piercing giggle, and he quickly covers his wheezing mouth, although his shoulders are still shaking as he ends the spell. He didn't block it, which tells Harry he's expecting this harmless charm.
Harry's smile fades.
"I've got to talk to you about Malfoy."
The fireplace flares into life.
"Are you... are you all in?" Potter asks between whimpers when Draco withdraws and thrusts back in again.
They had ended the day with a wrecked Banoffee pie and two orgasms each.
Ron snickers, and Harry ducks his head, blushing at the mischievous twinkle in Draco's eyes.
A clap of thunder, paired with a streak of lightning flashing on the horizon, startles Draco. It all happens so fast: Draco yelps and swerves sharply to the left, losing his balance and slipping away from his broom. He feels an arm grabbing him by the edges of his uniform, slowing his descent, before he falls to the ground with Potter tumbling a short distance away from him.
"I have to pack, I’m leaving tomorrow," Harry says, the words catching in his throat. "So I guess this is—"
"Yes, anything you want, I'd do anything!" Draco practically sobs before he comes all over Potter's table and shrieks in part-relief and release, dripping lust all over Harry's name, but Potter isn't stopping, that fucking
"Potions experiment gone wrong," he offers. Malfoy indicates a jagged, raised scar on Harry's shoulder, extending to the top of his chest.
Draco breaks the kiss to throw his head back and let out a breathy moan.
A visible shudder ripples through Malfoy, and he makes that familiar sound, a cross between a sigh and a sob, reminding Harry of how he moved on top of him. Before Harry can control himself, he pushes his hips forward, pressing their erections together.
Draco isn’t surprised at Hermione's sneakiness in killing two birds with one stone — her attempt at matchmaking and sorting out Grimmauld.
The scrumptious scent of jam and biscuits would waft up to the library from the kitchens, and Draco would come scampering down the grand staircase, book of the week forgotten. He smiles wistfully. "I'd give anything to smell that again."
In return, his best mate lets out a tremendous snore.
"The owls don't really care about the appearance, it's just the humans that do," Harry explains. He must've caught Draco looking. Harry motions to Hedwig, who wastes no time in tasting the contents of each bowl. She pushes away the first two bowls, and either turns her beak up or displays indifference to the remaining bowls save for the last one. She hoots in approval at the last bowl.
George perks up.
Potter sits down beside him, giving him an encouraging smile.
When he’s with him, Harry feels like he can paint the world.
“You’re in my lunchroom now, Potter. Know your place,” he hisses. Potter’s eyes flare with a combative fire that Draco knows all too well. With both hands, he grabs the bottom of Potter’s jacket — this fucking sexy black leather jacket that he looks so dangerous in, Salazar, just looking at him in this is enough to make Draco hard — and uses that to yank Potter towards him. Potter lurches forward as Draco walks backwards.
"Alright. I'll stay in Lisbon. I'll wait for you for as long as I can. You’ve never told me how you truly feel about me, but all I know is that…" Harry’s pulse speeds, and he gulps audibly, hoping that he isn’t going too far. "Is that I can't change how… how I love you."
Harry chuckles and agrees, rubbing the back of his neck. His smile fades at the title of the painting.
Ah, fuck.
Draco spots mould growing in between the cracks of the fountains. Just like the rest of the estate, they have fallen into disrepair.
Still, Harry is so damn attracted to him; drawn to his silky-smooth voice, his good looks, dry wit and sarcastic humour, coupled with that yearning pull of mystery — what exactly happened to him post-war? — that Harry knows will never go away.
Out tumbles an engagement ring with a small teardrop aquamarine gemstone set in the centre of the ring. It’s a beautiful ring — Draco carefully turns it, admiring the blue of the stone sparkling when it catches the light — but it’s a rather flashy ring for a man. Besides, he would much prefer an emerald stone; green is his favourite colour, and it’d be even better if it was a green in the shade of Harry’s eyes-
"With me. Here. Tomorrow morning. The morning
“And the hair?” Harry asks, deliberately excluding the mention of the hidden Dark Mark. Although he has an inkling of the answer, he wants to know what Malfoy says.
They talk about Quidditch teams for a while. When the conversation enters a lull, Oliver leans forward and narrows his eyes at Harry.
Draco up-ends the entire vial of morning dew into the cauldron.
But real life is never like that, is it?
Harry doesn’t recognise all of the songs — his own music tastes are rather limited to rock and punk, so it’s a rather refreshing change, listening to music stripped down to only a voice and an acoustic guitar. His neighbour’s music is a mix of pop and rock, and Harry whispers along to the words when he knows them. The pop songs, however, aren’t his cup of tea, but it’s how the voice sounds — yearning and emotional, as if caressing a lover — that is entirely mesmerising. Harry reckons that his neighbour is smiling as he sings sometimes, and he’s keen to know if his smile is as beautiful as his voice.
Having him in such close proximity after so long is driving Draco’s heartrate up. His dreams of Potter have become more vivid since the fight, and in one dream, they ended up shagging after the fight, with Potter climbing on top of him, hitching up his robes and—
He lets out a sharp, broken cry as he spills down Malfoy's gulping throat. After a moment, Malfoy withdraws and quirks his lips, allowing a line of come to trickle down his chin. Harry grins lazily; he loves it whenever Malfoy does that. Harry tugs him up from the floor and hauls him into his lap. He wipes away his come from Malfoy's lips and dashes away the tears at the corners of Malfoy’s eyes from having his mouth open for so long. "Even better than I remembered," Harry says, kissing him briefly.
Draco hurls the teapot against the wall.
Draco shuffles forward, the soles of his loafers crunching on the gravel. Malfoy Manor stands — as lofty and imposing as ever — but an atmosphere of sorrow and neglect weighs it down. This aura emanating from it can’t be due to Dark Magic — the Aurors have scoured every nook and cranny.
"Potter, you absolute arse!" Draco snaps, yanking the shirt off the approved pile and suppressing the urge to whack Potter over the head with it. "It's got to
"Your tart? Oh, of course," Malfoy says, snapping his fingers as if he's just been struck by an idea. "We should've stocked treacle tart earlier, knowing that it's your favourite, isn't it?" He folds his arms across his chest and sniffs. "Why, Potter, I know you're used to getting your way in the Ministry, what with being the Saviour and all, but now you're demanding desserts for free?”
The green light flashes, and Draco strikes, jamming a finger down on the play button while he sinks down into the pillows. He hopes it's going to be a quick one tonight; Draco is so horny he can barely think straight. He won't be able to bear it if it's one of those long, drawn-out sessions with Harry teasing him to the point of insanity.
Dumbledore’s eyebrow crooked, “Suni?”
All Hadrian could do was slide to the ground and weep.
Draco had gotten on the train interested to find the boy who lived, but he found himself rather satisfied with what he’d found instead. His mother and father would hardly care either way as long as he made nice wizarding friends that had a shred of a decent head on their shoulders. Hadrian’s head leaned back slowly, craning to look at him. Those eyes pinned him down, and even though Draco knew he wasn’t another empath it felt like the other boy was baring out his soul. It was a slightly thrilling feeling.
Hell no.
“Why didn’t I know you? Tom said you looked like us, but I didn’t think anything of it. But you’re my little prince. My Hadrian.” The brunet was pliant as Severus held him tight, knuckles blood white from how tight he was holding Draco’s mate. Hadrian glanced at the sheet, eyes widening when he saw the words on the top, slowly, Hadrian was able to uncurl from his Uncle. Not going too far, he stayed plastered to his uncle’s side as Hadrian looked at the sheet, grabbing the stapled pages.
Draco laughed, though he had no clue what his love was saying. His lord was immediately sitting up and leaning in excitedly.
“Lucius, Hadrian is selectively mute. Would his sister be allowed to be present? She often helps him get his message across and keeps him grounded.”
Rage was still burning like a lovingly stoked fire in his chest, growing hotter with each minute. But something was also soothed. Godson. He had two, technically three, you didn’t get Hadrian without Laney tagging along. That desperate part of him that tracked everything he owned calmed a bit, giddily counting again and again. Three. Three. Three. He had more than he’d started with.
Hadrian didn’t respond.
If Hadrian had shorter, lighter hair, the lord and he might look similar Draco mused. But that’s assumed Hadrian would ever wear his hair short voluntarily. Draco had asked once if Hadrian would even morph his hair to be shorter than his shoulders; but the venomous reply that he was forced into one gender and one short hair-cut for nine months at school was enough even if he didn’t remember anything of school once he came home.
All her fault.
It was show time and he was ready.
James snarled and snapped at him viciously. Like a wild dog on a leash.
Four days of hard work. Bags were becoming purses of black under his eyes as he worked tirelessly into the night, before throwing a rug on top of the circle as soon as the sun broke the horizon. Then he’d suffer through James dragging him to breakfast where he’d sit silently and they’d all ignore the bruises and the fact Hadrian could barely walk without leaving a blood trail behind him from his leg. Lily shot her husband concerned looks, and Alex was wary, but reassured by his father easily enough. Enough that he had the audacity to tell Hadrian that the sooner he behaved and got ungrounded the sooner they could fly together and get homeschooled together.
Until.
Even if he was absolutely destroying Alexander Potter’s sanity.
The hall was gorgeous.
He threw it into a roll and immediately his raven was off.
Hadrian sighed softly as Draco’s arms wrapped around his waist and joined in his sister arguing about what and ever with the two vassals. The raven hadn’t the energy to try and even understand what Laney was trying to convince them of this time, so he just relaxed and focused on meditating until finally breakfast was finished and Professor Snape came to collect them both, Laney pouting about delaying he first day off with her kitten and new friends while Hadrian tried to float in his happy mental place.
“Cool, what do you- holy Merlin.” Draco interrupted himself, prompting Hadrian and his sister to look behind themselves. Both froze and looked awestruck.
-I won’t sit here with my thumbs up my ass doing nothing
There was definitely a resemblance between the two. Potter had the same general facial structure and their hair was the same shade of dark black-brown. That was about the end of their similarities however.
-Watch James get beat down by coworkers
“In the magical world custody often is gifted to the godparents, do any of the children have them?” Severus cut in.
“A bad seed? Jealous monster? Waste of space? Disgrace? Squib? It’s alright, don’t panic; I see that face you’re pulling. I’m joking. I just hear the rumors. But yeah, I’m the ‘lowly’ Harry, twin of the Boy-Who-Lived.” Hadrian smirked. “Shame I’m not so lowly anymore when I’m going to show people just who they’re gossiping about. I’m going to make my family, the
“Blaise?”
Pros- Legal
“Barely a week apart actually! I’m born on July 23
, god the words were so surreal and so, so lovely. His little prince. Looking at the paper with inquisitive eyes, it was a full inheritance, heritage, and medical parchment. Rather thick too. Lucius never liked to do anything by halves. He’d probably wanted to see Hadrian’s heritage and genetics that could be passed on. Money wasn’t important to the Malfoys, but heritage and genetics were to a point. If there was a dangerous mix then blood adoption would be encouraged rather than conception through potioned means. He was getting off track.
the welcoming party, because being reminded of Voldemort and getting eyed up by old enemies crawling out of the woodwork on a pleasant Monday morning was so not on.
Draco closes his eyes briefly, reining in the tatters of his emotional control. When he opens his eyes, he picks up the teapot and fills two teacups with English Breakfast. His mouth is stretched into a perfunctory smile, and even though his eyes give nothing away, he's certain that the Aurors can't miss the tremor in his hand.
"Me too," Harry had hissed and came deep in Draco just in time to pull out and roll them away to the shadows of the tree just seconds before the jogger passed the park bench.
“I’m ready,” Draco says when the last potion is sorted into the appropriate cabinet.
It's Harry's first Christmas away from home. He returned last year, missing the Weasleys and his friends too much. Although he can’t go home this year, he's not spending it alone. A familiar figure approaches the café, and Harry grins when Nowaki enters. He props his umbrella near the door and looks around, his eyes lighting up when he spots Harry.
The mattress squeaks under them, the fabric of the sheets is rubbing against Draco’s cock, amplifying his pleasure. Potter huffs and bites the side of his neck as he fucks him like an animal, passionate and primal. His world has narrowed to the luxurious sensation of Potter’s cock ramming into him, the slick slide of sweat between their bodies, Potter’s grunts and his own cries, he’s close, oh, he’s so close—
