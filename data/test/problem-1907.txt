"She'll get over it, Longbottom. Trust me." Blaise told him, though his words didn't seem to have any effect on the frown that only seemed to deepen on Neville's face. "That's just how Pansy is."
Ever since the war ended, Draco had pretty much grown used to people hating him anyway. The looks had grown even more callous after he was acquitted by the Ministry. So, frankly, being the most despised person in the room had simply become a normal part of his life now.
not long enough for people to notice but certainly long enough that she was able to use them to propel herself back up without losing her speed or momentum. And while Ginny was busy trying not to crash into the ground, Aria took advantage of her distraction and made a direct beeline for the snitch.
"Something like that." Neville answered Zabini with an embarrassed smile. "Back in the boys' dorms in Gryffindor, we had a designated person who was in charge of waking up everybody else in time for breakfast. Usually, that assigned person would be rotated from the first years."
glared haughtily at them through her thick, round-famed glasses before turning around and disappearing completely from the frame, causing Pansy to scoff again and roll her eyes.
Hermione was so used to her best friend's mood swings by now that she didn't even look at all bothered or concerned. Instead, she smirked and turned to Madam Pomfrey again, watching as she used her wand to cut through Aria's uniform, exposing the broken wing.
if I can help it." Pansy answered quietly as she stood up carefully from her seat, her eyes glassy and her movements jerky as she began packing her things.
Aria winced as she stared at them, inwardly thinking to herself how either Harper or Graham could have easily picked up all of the other boys on their team in one hand and tossed them effortlessly towards the other side of the quidditch pitch like they were quaffles.
Aria summoned two more bottles from the refreshment table, handing one of them to a bewildered Pansy.
Harriah Potter when she said you were one of the very few Death Eaters who was actually just a victim of circumstance." She said softly.

When he wasn't holed up in a dark, secluded corner of the library, he isolated himself in his dorm room; staring off blankly into empty space as he went over his outlines over and over again in his head. Unlike the rest of his housemates, he was actually confident about his NEWT subjects, but the exam he was particularly anxious about was his last one — Magical Law, because it was widely known to be one of the most difficult of all the NEWTs.
"No reason." Blaise grinned at her again and answered her with a nonchalant shrug. "I was just thinking about how it'd be wicked if we could all have our next drinking session down there. Wouldn't that be something?" He mused.
He lifted his gaze and stared directly into Aria's wide eyes, and he noticed for the first time that they weren't blank anymore. Unlike the vacant expression Draco had seen on her face when Bentley had first cast the Feather Curse, Aria's eyes looked
"By the way." Draco frowned when he realized something, watching as the next train to London began pulling up onto the station's platform. "I'm really sorry but what did you say your name was again?" He asked.
At the sound of the sharp gasps and amused snickers from the crowd, Aria snapped the folder shut and set it back down onto the table. She looked up and met the horrified expression on Skeeter's face with another smile. "If I recall, you mentioned in your last article about how you thought veela magic was 'absolutely abhorrent', and that our beauty was simply a 'magical illusion' created to distract people from our 'manipulative nature'." She drawled.
The blush on the former Hufflepuff girl's cheeks was apparent as she lowered her gaze to the table in embarrassment. "My parents are very traditional and they were very strict about alcohol or any kind of promiscuity while I was growing up, you see. They always warned me about how alcohol would make me lose my wits and that I might end up pregnant or something—"
Aria opened her eyes as Draco slowly pulled away, and he stared worriedly at her for a long time, obviously waiting for her reaction. With a smile, she reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him back down so that she could whisper something into his ear.
Pansy conceded with a smirk and stepped away from her, though the curious expression lingered on her face.
"I apologize for the intrusion, Headmistress." Aria answered as she walked into the room anyway and plopped herself down onto the seat beside Corey's. When McGonagall didn't react and simply arched an eyebrow at her, Aria set her jaw and spoke up in a clear voice.
"Don't be ridiculous!" Draco tried to sneer at her, though given the blush on his cheeks, he was pretty sure that it didn't have its intended effect. "I'm not afraid of a couple of stupid hippogriffs! Let's get going already!"
at her tone of voice. She knew Hermione well enough to realize that the Ravenclaw was slowly beginning to lose her patience.
Both Hermione and Aria winced at the sharp, furious tone of Ron's outburst, but when he opened his mouth to say something else, Aria shook her head and hastily cut him off. "Look, I know it sounds bad but he didn't actually dump
" Pansy looked up and gave her a mocking smirk. "But then again, I suppose a little extra motivation wouldn't hurt. Especially since it wouldn't matter if you got me expelled or not once your little secret is out. I just hope I don't accidentally let your secret slip to…say, Blaise or Draco, for example. They're certainly not
Thankfully, he didn't have to wait much longer because in the distance, he could already see the train coming from London making its way toward the village. The train stopped as it reached the platform, and within a few minutes, a small crowd of passengers began alighting from its doors, exiting the station one by one.
"Fine then. If you're so fond of these Slytherins, then let me ask you one question." He scowled when Aria ignored him and began trying to twist her hand away. "Can you honestly look me in the eye right now and tell me that you completely trust
"You're not fine, 'Mione." Ron suddenly looked up at that and he glared warningly at her. "You have to stay here because Madam Pomfrey wants to observe how your body is adjusting to the vampirism infection."
"To be honest, the only reason I didn't mess up is because of over preparation." Greg admitted as he ducked his head behind his hand and gave her a rueful smile. "I actually studied the first chapter of our textbook in advance this weekend. Pansy tutored me."
something that disgusting, Zabini?." She scoffed derisively at him, causing Draco to stifle a smirk behind his hand. "And lastly, do you really think I'd have the time to date around? Bloody evil dark wizard after my life and all that?" She pointed out.
Aria flicked her hooded gaze over his shoulder briefly to Pansy's pale face before turning back to him and giving him a calm smile that didn't reach her eyes. "So if you could wrap this up, I'd really like to finish these chores as soon as possible. Parkinson, shall we get going?"
Instead of answering, Ron stuck his tongue out at her while Hermione just shook her head at their antics. As soon as they were gone and Aria found herself alone at the table with Draco once more, she turned to him and gave him a soft smile.
"And given your disgustingly pathetic attempt to hit on Aria just now, I gather you don't really get the chance to talk much to women either." Blaise added slyly, snickering at Zach's embarrassed cringe.
His eyes narrowed as he stared cautiously at her, trying to gauge the look on her face. "And what exactly do you mean by that?"
"Hey yourself." Draco hummed appreciatively, blinking his eyes open when Aria pulled away; though she kept her arms wrapped intimately around his neck. "Not that I'm complaining or anything, but what are you doing here? I thought you had to work late tonight."
So don't you dare start playing the victim card now." Neville's eyes were like steel as he glared accusingly at Pansy's stunned, crestfallen face. "You were the one made those choices during the war. So stop blaming me and Aria and learn to deal with the consequences."
Draco didn't answer; and Aria avoided his eyes for awhile, still blushing as she stared intently into the fire. Outside, the rain continued to pour heavily and they heard another loud smattering of thunder, followed by a quick flash of lightning just outside the cave's entrance.
When he looked up and noticed Aria arching an eyebrow at him, Draco rolled his eyes and glared at her as though she was daft.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Weasley, but there's nothing I can do. This decision is final." McGonagall looked a little sympathetic as she reached out and placed a comforting hand on Ron's shoulder to calm him down.
"Sorry." Aria obliged and wrapped the blanket around herself, trying not to shiver when she was immediately enveloped in Draco's scent. She swallowed and looked away so that Draco wouldn't see her blushing.
"The good news is, this will be quite an unconventional class – the first of its kind here at Hogwarts. Instead of lectures, it will consist of a series of individual seminars. In other words, instead of being taught by a single professor, this class will actually be taught by a different guest lecturer each week. Incidentally, each guest lecturer will be a member of the magical race to be discussed in your curriculum." She paused and flicked her wand again, carefully distributing the stack of papers she held by floating them around the room to each student's desk.
He didn't look up and kept his self-conscious gaze trained intently on his plate, obviously in an effort to avoid the cameras pointed at them. Aria placed a gloved hand discreetly on his under the table, giving his fingers a light squeeze. Draco's entire demeanor relaxed instantly and he squeezed her hand back, intertwining their fingers together.
"Butterscotch is adorable. She's a rare breed of cat, you know. She's actually an Egyptian Mau." Hermione went on happily, obviously choosing to ignore Aria's comment.
It took her awhile before she actually gave any sort of indication that she heard him; but eventually, Aria slowly shook her head and blinked herself out of her weird trance.
"Bentley." She drawled softly, the calmness of her expression betrayed by the angry glittering in her eyes. "I'll only say this once. I really don't like it when people touch me without my consent." She said slowly, already pulling her hand away.
"Ah yes, that." Fleur just chuckled and waved her hand dismissively at the comment. "As you know, veelas are distantly related to harpies, so when we get angry, we may sometimes look like them."
end up collecting some valuable notes from you and Aria having sex. All that tension and bitter rivalry would certainly add something entirely new to the equation. But then, I'd need more data points to be able to make any relevant conclusions." Morag was mostly talking to herself at this point but she paused and turned to give Pansy a questioning look. "Maybe you should also have sex with Neville so I could get more information on the subject? You two exhibit nearly the same kind of unresolved sexual tension as Draco and Aria after all."
Draco hesitated, not entirely sure if Aria was ready to see him just yet after everything that happened.
As they walked through the doors, Aria froze when she suddenly found a horde of reporters and photographers swarming around them, blocking their path.
"Everyone, please call me Neville." He began, giving them all a forced smile when he noticed the obvious tension lingering in their expressions. "I currently live in Surrey with my grandmother. It's just the two of us there but it's nice because we have plenty of space to grow a lot of magical plants. Oh, I have a terrible fear of heights by the way, which is why I never liked flying. Lastly, my favorite subject is Herbology, and I plan to specialize further in it – perhaps become a Professor in Hogwarts after I graduate."
"Let them be, Hermione. They're probably just bored and need the gossip. It's annoying but perfectly harmless." Aria waved her irritation away, adjusting her wings so that she could lean back against her bed.
that Draco just knew he had kissed her more than once before, if only because he was absolutely certain that he would never,
is why we shouldn't leave any gifts for Potter out in the open like that." Pansy rolled her eyes at Draco's reaction as she finished the last of her croissant and stood up, dusting her skirt and grabbing her bag. "I'll bring Hannah to Slughorn. We can't let her walk around like this, who knows what kind of trouble she'll get herself into?" She huffed.
"Oh gods, Aria!" Hermione blurted out, paling as she reached up and gently touched the blood-stained feathers that were peeking out from her back. "That bludger must have hit you directly on your left wing, a part of it is poking out of your back! And it looks broken, it's bleeding all over your uniform!" She whispered frantically.
All of the 8th years and 7th years were already there, looking agitated as they huddled together near the fireplace. The younger years had crowded near the entrance and were talking loudly amongst themselves, though most of their conversations were too panicky to be coherent enough for Aria to understand.
When Aria seemed too stunned to do anything but gape at him, he seized her gloved hand tightly in his, nearly yanking the glove off her hand in his exuberance.
for Merlin's sake—" He paused in the middle of his tirade when he noticed the way Aria was glaring dangerously at him and hastily managed to turn the scowl on his face into a nervous grin.
"You look like you're going to be sick, Zach." Aria told him as she reached out and patted him lightly on the shoulder. "Just try to relax, okay? Besides, what happened to all that stuff you said about being good at quidditch—"
Everyone in the entire classroom, including Slughorn, had stopped what they were doing and were staring at them now, most of them laughing at the sight of Greg and Aria shrieking hysterically at each other as they both kept trying to shoo the spider away.
talking about Potter please?" Pansy cut them off with another irritated growl as she slammed the book in her lap shut and glared at them. "Believe it or not, I have more important things to think about other than Harriah Potter's exciting life."
He remembered the strange softness in Potter's green eyes as she let Narcissa hug her back before she pulled away slowly.
she's allowed to be a lazy, self-entitled git as much as she wants. Isn't that right, Potter?" He turned his head to the side and grinned at her, reaching a hand up to pinch playfully at her cheeks.
When he got there, he was a little confused to find Corey staring off blankly into space with a dazed look in his eyes. The books Draco had left beside him were still there, but he was a little miffed when he noticed that Corey had obviously been looking through some of them, judging by the way the small pile wasn't as neatly arranged as Draco had left it.
"Aria!" He blurted out as he reached them, ignoring Draco completely as he checked her for any obvious signs of injury. "Bloody hell, are you okay?! I'm so sorry, I couldn't get to you in time – I-I thought you were, I was—" He stopped and his eyes suddenly widened when he caught sight of the small part of her broken wing that was protruding from her left shoulder. His breath hitched and he looked up, wincing as he met Aria's equally panicked expression.
"Okay, that's enough." Hermione interrupted them sharply, shaking her head and letting out an irritated sigh. "Honestly, you two. You've been sniping at each other for
Draco rolled his eyes at her and scooted closer, taking a sip from the bottle of firewhiskey in his hand before he arched an eyebrow and offered it to her. She took the bottle and obliged him with a long, satisfying sip. As Aria felt the liquid burning a trail down her throat, she passed the bottle back to him and swallowed slowly before leaning her head against Draco's shoulder.
"I guess you weren't as bad at Potions as you thought you were." Aria added as she handed him several empty potion vials. "I usually have a hard time maintaining the potion's consistency and temperature all throughout like that."
"Get your bloody mitts off me, you tosser!" She snapped and shrugged his arm off, shoving him away before he could touch her face.
"Wh—what?!" Hannah spluttered, nearly choking on her drink as big splotches of red stained her cheeks. "Of course not! I didn't even know you were serious with all that stuff, Zabini!" She screeched at him.
"It wasn't my idea!" Greg whimpered and frantically shook his head, holding his hands up and giving her an apologetic look. "D—Draco put me up to it, I swear! He said you wouldn't mind!"
"Pansy?" Aria blinked at him before she accepted the full vials of potion from him and began writing their names on the lids.
true. You should know that there are many different types of veela – some with red hair, black hair, brown hair,
"I agree." Blaise quipped, winking at Hannah and pointing to her with his fork. "Being 'sexy' is in the way a girl sees herself. It has nothing to do with looks. I've dated plenty of girls who were bloody gorgeous but were about as sexy as a rock."
When the former Ravenclaw didn't say anything else and instead, chose to engross herself once more in her thick Potions textbook, the confusion on Draco's face slowly transformed into a highly offended scowl.
blows hot at first, but once you give him some time to cool off, he eventually comes to his senses and starts thinking clearly. The git doesn't care to admit it, but he's actually very sensitive underneath all that cocky exterior of his."
but at the last minute, Ron decided to ask me out to dinner so we're both here in Paris right now." Hermione answered, sounding strangely exhilarated. "Anyway, we have something really important to tell you. Can you adjust the wards on your fireplace first so that we can see each other face to face?" She asked.
"Alright, I'm back." Blaise interrupted the rest of Smith's carefully crafted insult as he sat back down into his seat and rested an arm against the backrest of Aria's. "One gin and tonic and one scotch neat." He handed Aria and Malfoy their respective drinks before rewarding them all with a mischievous grin.
At her words, Aria finally leaned back against her seat and closed her eyes, letting out a sigh of relief. Behind her, Blaise's grin widened and he squeezed Aria's shoulder in support. Pansy, on the other hand, continued to stare at the Headmistress, obviously waiting for her to say something else.
"Everything okay, Aria?" Hannah asked as she glanced at Aria over her shoulder and gave her a look of concern. "You don't usually look so tired and ruffled. Have you been getting enough sleep?"
Draco felt the realization slam into him like a bludger to the head and all of a sudden, he couldn't breathe.
At this point, Draco's vision had gone completely hazy with allure-induced lust and he realized he couldn't think clearly anymore.
The strange tone in his voice caused both Blaise and Pansy to look up and give him a curious stare. Greg, on the other hand, had gone noticeably still at the mention of Astoria's name, though Draco knew the particular reason for his reaction. He knew that Greg and Astoria had been childhood friends since the two were both in diapers, and more often than not, anyone who said anything negative or defamatory about Astoria was usually the unfortunate recipient of one of Greg's gigantic fists.
As he growled and reached down to untie himself from the binds, Aria conjured up another wall of blue flames. The flames circled slowly around them, separating them from the others and preventing Fisher from running away. She made a motion with her hand, causing the flames to grow even higher and close in dangerously around them.
Her eyes were wide and she stared openly at Neville in utter confusion, an uncharacteristically self-conscious look on her face.
"Yes, I can." Corey cut her off, turning around to give her a miffed glare. "Aria's actually been helping me with my flying after every DADA tutoring lesson." He told her.
Pansy hesitated, but Draco could tell from the way her expression had softened that she was beginning to relent.
When she froze near the front of the classroom and looked up, meeting Draco's stare, his cheeks flushed and he almost tore his gaze away had Aria not arched an eyebrow and offered him a friendly smile. Before he realized what he was doing, Draco felt both corners of his lips quirking upwards as he gave her a smile back.
The expression on Aria's face was a combination of annoyance and frustration. She let out an exasperated sigh and reached up to pinch the bridge of her nose. "You are completely misunderstanding me here."
Draco noticed the way she was still glaring at Aria and Greg across the hall and followed her gaze. He watched as Aria smiled at Greg and seemed to laugh at something he was saying. In all honesty, Draco felt a tiny stab of jealousy himself at the way Aria suddenly leaned up to whisper something into Greg's ear but before he could even react properly, a soft sniffle to his right suddenly drew his attention.
sexy. It's that really strong aura she gives out." Morag agreed, taking the time to look up from her book with a thoughtful frown on her face. "In fact, I've had more than a few interesting dreams about her myself—"
As soon as the words flew out, Pansy let out a high-pitched, horrified gasp and slapped both of her hands over her mouth. Her cheeks colored and she glared viciously at Aria while Draco, Neville, and a few other students who had been standing near enough to hear her, suddenly burst out laughing.
"Yeah, right." Pansy snorted again, but this time, a small, amused smile tugged at the corner of her lips.
For some reason, her question caused Draco to pause mid-step and turn around slowly, leveling her with a cool, penetrating stare. "Exactly how often do these obsessed idiots try to drug you with amortentia anyway?" He asked carefully.
"Look at the pot calling the kettle black." Aria snorted and mirrored the accusing look on his face.
Aria shouted furiously at him, her wide green eyes suddenly blazing to life with that legendary Gryffindor temper of hers that Draco was all too familiar with. "Malfoy, do you even hear yourself right now?! Give me a little more credit than that. If I hated you, do you think I would have helped you and your parents out during those Death Eater trials?!"
As soon as she was gone and had disappeared back inside the castle, Draco's eyes narrowed but he accepted Blaise's offered hand and pulled himself back up to his feet. Muttering darkly under his breath, Draco turned to glare warningly at the two Gryffindor boys who were still watching them.
But that thought didn't give him any comfort or satisfaction at all, because it only begged another question.
Most of the Slytherins (excluding Blaise and Pansy, since the two of them were pretty much used to Draco's outbursts by now) had averted their eyes from both him
"Nothing." Aria swallowed and shakily jumped back up to her feet. "I—I think we also passed by some Death Caps back there." She stammered, pointing to a spot over Draco's shoulder.
"I suppose I should thank you for helping me and scaring Michael off." She began stiffly, scowling to herself and looking everywhere around them except Aria. "Under normal circumstances, I could have handled him. He just caught me a little off guard."
Aria's large green veela pupils glowed with frustration as Draco's words stirred their mate bond instantly; magically compelling her to collapse back onto the bed.
While Hannah was blushing under everyone's expectant looks, Aria chanced a look at Blaise, watching as he glared reproachfully at Draco from the corner of his eye. The blond boy just arched an eyebrow and shrugged at him, obviously unconcerned with Blaise's efforts to keep things civil.
too." Morag shrugged at him and made a dismissive gesture with her hand. "But it's just...the whole idea of spending an entire year
She ignored the other girl's reaction and waited a couple of minutes until Ron and Hermione's flushed, disembodied heads suddenly popped into the fireplace. They both grinned at her and Aria couldn't help smiling wryly at the matching looks of excitement on both of her best friends' faces.
"I have to be honest." She bit her lip, turning to give Draco a slightly sheepish smile. "There's actually another reason I got off work early today to see you."
how Greg feels about Astoria right? You know that he likes her? And that she likes him back? I thought Greg was your friend." Pansy continued, sighing and shaking her head when Draco still refused to say anything. "So I hope you know that by accepting her invitation, you're
"Of course you will." Pansy huffed again and turned away. "I'll tell Corey you'll meet him in that empty classroom on the third floor every Saturday morning—"
"Yes, it is." Draco answered, a little taken back by her interest. "The ring is enchanted. My father told me that it's infused with ancient spells that are supposed to protect me against most forms of magical bewitchments." He told her.
One look at the nasty-looking cut above Aria's left eyebrow as she stood back up to help Zach and Ginny to their feet was all it took for Draco's blood to start boiling. As Aria and Ginny bent over to inspect Finch-Fletchey's unconscious form on the ground, Draco signalled impatiently to Madam Hooch for a time out and flew over towards them.
Shaking her head at the thought, Aria took that moment to glance curiously around the dormitory, noting with mild surprise that, unlike the dorm rooms in Gryffindor tower, the rooms down in the dungeons were much bigger than she expected.
"Bentley, stop this." She let out an irritated sigh. "We both know your magic levels aren't anywhere near mine, so dueling me would be pointless."
"What do you say you and me head on back to that tavern over there and enjoy some time to ourselves? I'd be more than happy to keep you company." He gave her a dazed, drunken leer after he had said that, his gaze brazenly sweeping up and down her form.
starving! Let's eat!" Ron suddenly blurted out, causing everyone else to jump slightly at his outburst.
It wasn't long before they finished, and as they moved on to wiping down the chairs, Aria began to feel another surge of irritation when she felt Pansy's eyes lingering on her back. She sighed and turned around, rolling her eyes at the way Pansy was staring at her as though she had just admitted to secretly being a Death Eater.
"Change?" She asked, arching an eyebrow at him. "What could possibly change by the end of the year, Draco?"
This time, Draco allowed one corner of his mouth to tug upwards into a small, amused smile. Undeterred, he reached toward her again but this time, he gently tucked one stray lock of her long hair behind her ear.
Their eyes met and Draco suddenly remembered, for the first time since the year started, how pretty she was without those dreadful glasses obscuring half of her face. He swallowed again and his eyes involuntarily lowered to her lips, staring at them until he felt her breath hitch. As they continued their slow descent towards the ground, his eyes grew soft and he lifted his free, ungloved hand, using it to stroke her soft cheek and to tuck the lock of hair that had fallen into her eyes behind her ear.
Zach blinked at his outstretched hand, his eyebrows fused together in thought. Finally, after a long moment, he clenched his jaw and nodded before he took Draco's offered hand and pulled himself back up to his feet.
"Oh come now, what's with that look, Miss Potter? You must have known this was coming, you're a very talented seeker after all! A chip off the old block, I'd say. Just like your father. A future quidditch star in the making!" He exclaimed enthusiastically.
The Gryffindor was sitting among his friends and had already been staring very intently at the doors of the Great Hall even before Aria had walked in.
He didn't walk out, but he did as she requested and kept his gaze firmly on the wall in front of him. A few minutes later, while he heard her flipping through the row of dresses hanging along the cabinet, he cleared his throat and spoke up in a soft, deceptively casual voice.
sorry." She admitted, giving him a sheepish grin. "I've never actually done that before; so I guess I need to practice a bit more."
"I don't have a lot of happy memories growing up; and from past experience, the people I love...tend to get hurt...or even die on me. A-and I was so afraid that if I admitted to myself...how I felt about you...Something really bad would happen that would take you away and I would end up losing you too."
Aria glared at him in reply, causing Draco to laugh before he leaned down again, pressing his forehead against hers.
Pansy smirked and reached out, tugging at the end of Aria's braid and nearly causing all of the strands to come loose.
"Fine then. I'll bite." Draco's eyes narrowed as he leaned back against his seat and sneered at her. "What exactly shall I talk about then? What I want to be when I grow up? How much sugar I put in my tea? Or how about my bloody favorite subject?" He drawled sarcastically.
." Draco swallowed and let out another defeated sigh. "And it doesn't matter if I've been acquitted or not. People look at me and they
about this girl, and in the three months that they had been exchanging letters back and forth, Draco was beginning to suspect that she might have actually been stringing him along like some hapless idiot this whole time. He hoped that wasn't the case, but she obviously didn't like him enough to bother telling him anything about herself – not her interests, her family, her address, not even her bloody
I figured she'd be able to take it. Besides, she was more than an hour late – and while we're on that subject, so are you." He gave Draco a pointed look before pouring him a shot of the same drink he had just offered Aria.
Thankfully, if Hagrid noticed anything about their thoroughly unkempt appearance (or the many suspicious red marks littered along Aria's neck), he said nothing and instead, thanked them both before ushering them off back to Hogwarts.
"His spirit is that of a weaker energy, this one." Firenze told her, cutting off the rest of her response as he directed his attention to Draco's pale face again, giving him a painfully scrutinizing look. "His nature is selfish, and he is likely to cower in the face of adversity. He does not possess the kind of inner strength you have, Harriah Potter. You would be a very ill-suited match for each other, indeed." He added warningly.
She stalked deeper into the hollow of the cave and turned her back to him, facing the wall. As she reached up and began fixing her hair again, she could feel Draco's eyes on her, watching as her fingers combed carefully through the tangled strands before she twisted it all up into a much tighter and neater coil at the back of her head. When she finished, she turned around again, blushing when she saw that Draco was still watching her, a playful smile tugging on the corner of his lips.
Meanwhile, Draco noticed that his former housemates – Gregory Goyle, Daphne and Astoria Greengrass, Millicent Bulstrode, and Theodore Nott – all looked as though they were trying to adapt to their new houses.
Unfortunately, Draco didn't get any chance to speak to Aria over the next five days; at least not one that would have given him enough time to talk to her properly without the rest of their housemates watching.
Then, Aria gasped loudly and doubled over in pain, crumpling down onto her knees on the floor. A loud chorus of screams echoed around the Great Hall when Aria's wings suddenly tore themselves out forcefully from below her shoulders, ripping through the back of her gown and flaring wide open into their full size. Her hair sprang loose, snapping free from her braid and tumbling all the way down in a messy, tangled pile by her feet.
"Aria? What are you doing here?" Her eyes narrowed and she shook her head when she saw the expression on the other girl's face. "Oh no, wait. I know that look. What are you going to do—"
"Um…Harriah? Can I take the bed beside yours, please?" She asked meekly, blushing when Aria's initial reaction was to pause in mid-stride and give her a blank stare.
It was an entirely selfish and, admittedly, cowardly reason not to go; so Aria didn't bother sharing this with Ron
Aria's eyes softened and she bit her lip as she stared intently at him, studying the expression on his face.
Aria paled at her words and gave Pansy an apprehensive look. Wordlessly, she reached up behind her and began tying her hair back up into a braid.
"Oh well, aren't we all just into secrets these days? Veelas, vampires, and all that rubbish." Bentley scoffed impatiently at her. "What's one more secret?"
"Don't you dare drag me into this, Longbottom." Draco cut in sharply but Neville deliberately went on as though he hadn't heard him.
She rolled her eyes when she saw the way Ron just nodded dumbly in agreement and gestured impatiently for him to sit in the chair beside her. When he managed to do so after shaking himself from his dazed staring, Hermione pulled out a pen and notebook from her bag. The black-haired Gryffindor just stared curiously at her as Hermione gave her an expectant look and leaned back calmly against her seat.
"You look beautiful by the way." He murmured, sliding his gaze down to admire the peach-colored gown she was wearing. "I was half-expecting Granger to throw you out in the middle of the ceremony for taking so much attention away from her."
"Well…" Ron hesitated, meeting Hermione's eyes and giving her a questioning look. When Hermione just blushed, Aria arched an eyebrow and flicked her gaze back and forth between them in question.
"Really now?" Blaise snorted derisively at Hannah's words and shot a smirk over at Pansy. "And how exactly did you come up with the idea that Pansy is qualified to teach you how to be sexy—
A pair of heeled shoes suddenly dropped down onto the ground behind him with a soft, ominous 'click'.
The students watching along the bleachers screamed again as Aria collapsed against Draco, her arms automatically moving to wrap themselves around his neck as she struggled to keep from falling off. Draco winced at the harsh impact of her fall but his free arm automatically tightened around her, carefully positioning her so that he was carrying her more securely - bridal-style in his arms – with her head resting against his left arm and her legs draped over his right. His hand accidentally brushed against something behind her left shoulder and Aria winced again, a soft, pained hiss escaping her lips.
spot and Aria gasped again, trying move away from him, Draco tightened his grip on her and turned her slightly to the side so he could see.
"Well, that's a relief." Neville looked visibly relieved as he walked over to them and gave her a sardonic grin. "Now I know that there'll be at least
"Zabini and Parkinson already know about you. It's not like one more will make a huge difference." Ron retorted wryly.
Hermione gave him a fond, mildly exasperated look before she turned to Aria again, meeting the other girl's smile with a genuine one of her own.
Aria's eyes narrowed and she whirled around to glare at Draco in stunned outrage. As the feather burned away in Draco's hand, Aria blinked a couple of times and stared back helplessly at him with a dazed look on her face. The circle of blue flames around her and Fisher vanished as Aria's wand fell limply from her fingers.
Potter." Blaise managed to wheeze out as he looked up and met Aria's smug smile with a genuinely reverent expression.
"This is ridiculous." Potter chuckled, shaking her head. "We aren't usually this awkward and courteous around each other. Remind me, didn't we use to hate each other's guts?" She quipped.
"Ten points to Gryffindor." Fleur nodded again, tapping her long fingernails gently against her arms. "As you know, veelas are quite docile creatures. Despite our physical dexterity and magical strength, it is simply not in a veela's nature to be violent or aggressive. So why do you think these veelas committed such heinous acts back then?" She asked.
"Fisher did." Blaise looked grim. "He set the doors on fire right after he went after Aria. Obviously he didn't want any of the teachers following them. Though, if you ask me, he did a pretty good job of making sure they're preoccupied."
That annoyingly smug, infuriatingly adorable grin never left Aria's face as she shrugged at him and pointedly flicked her gaze back to the dance floor.
"You should see the Hufflepuff Common Room then." Smith snorted, leaning back against his seat and taking another sip from his beer. "Bloody chaos
She hadn't realized it at first, but there was a reason Aria had gotten along so well with her two best friends over the last eight years. It was because, unlike her new housemates in Slytherin, Ron and Hermione's personalities actually
Aria noticed Draco's staring and paled, hastily reaching both hands up and twisting her hair tightly around her fingers, piling it onto the top of her head. Draco blinked at that and watched as she struggled to keep the heavy mass from falling below her neck.
"Anyway." Morag cut him off again with another derisive scoff and wave of her hand. "Why do you need a book about Ancient Veelish? Do you need help deciphering her veela name?"
She eventually groaned in complaint and pressed her palms against his chest in a feeble attempt to push him away.
"I wonder who did it." Hannah thought out loud as she suddenly brought her textbook to her chest, hugging it tightly before leaning back to stare at the ceiling. "I mean, it couldn't have been
Draco shot back as he stood up and brushed his clothes off. "Of all the asinine – I should have gone on ahead and left you two Gryffindorks when Longbottom started puking his guts out." He complained, his eyes narrowing into a dangerous glare when he saw the small group of Ravenclaws nearby who had witnessed their little tumble snickering at them.
"Fortunately for you, Miss Potter, I am bound by the law on healer-patient confidentiality. So even if I wanted to, I couldn't tell anyone about your little secret anyway." She paused and, to Aria's surprise, Madam Pomfrey followed her declaration by giving her a quick, barely perceptible
"Seriously, 'Mione. You'd better have a good reason for waking me up in the middle of the night like this." She muttered grumpily, rubbing her eyes and pushing her long hair away from her face.
"What is that charm you're using? It's like you're holding an invisible umbrella." She mentioned, watching curiously as Draco adjusted his wand and pointed it up even higher to keep the cover above their heads.
As if Potter needed any more of a reason to inflate her ego, we have idiots like these practically worshiping the ground she walks on." Pansy muttered bitterly to herself, slinking back against her seat.
"Hey, you asked!" Zach snorted derisively and held his hands up in a gesture of self-defense. "Besides, I'm not wrong, you know. Just the other day, I overheard Ernie talking to Justin about how sexy they thought Fleur Delacour was in her tight robes." He shrugged, scratching the back of his head.
His head hurt; and it took him a few minutes before he was able to adjust to the light and focus on his surroundings. It took him even longer to remember everything that happened; but when he did, and Draco realized exactly why he was lying on his back against the cold floor of the Great Hall, his eyes snapped open.
"After you've already played with me and saved my life, you're just going to throw me away? Am I not interesting anymore for the perfect Chosen One?"
Aria grimaced at his words and closed her eyes, lowering herself back down onto the bed. After a few minutes of silence, Ron turned to her again, and there was a slightly worried frown on his face as he watched her.
"What?" Aria's eyes immediately narrowed into tiny slits and she sat up on her bed, giving Hermione an angry, disbelieving look. "No, you must be mistaken about that Hermione. I
"Well, excuse me. But if you haven't finished your studying by now, I don't think any amount of cramming will help you, Parkinson." Came Hermione's loud, scoffing response.
"Oh you know, parents trying to set their sons and daughters up with their friend's children and vice versa. Typical pureblood things." Blaise answered with a careless shrug.
Aria could only mewl in reply as she dug her nails into his back, silently urging him to go faster, deeper,
"Intriguing." Morag was studying both Aria and Pansy with a thoughtful expression on her face. "I've never actually had one-on-one sex with another girl before. Would you care to share some notes?" She asked, completely straight-faced.
Blaise was biting his lip, his shoulders shaking as he reached out and handed her the thick black gloves and goggles in his hand.
right on her back, just below her left shoulder blade, effectively knocking the Slytherin Seeker off her broom.
She bit back the nasty retort that itched to escape her lips and turned to Greg, meeting his embarrassed expression with an apologetic wince.
She obviously didn't notice him as she bent down, digging through a drawer of her undergarments, and Draco was unsure of what exactly he was supposed to do so he continued to watch her with an awkward grimace on his face. From where he stood, he could see that some parts of her skin were still a little wet and Draco was unable to prevent himself from staring as a tiny droplet of water on Aria's cheek rolled all the way down the seductive curve of her neck.
." Ron used his wand to levitate a small stuffed toy of a Hungarian Horntail from the pile. When Aria arched an eyebrow and gave the hideous-looking toy a horrified look, Ron laughed and held it out to her. "It's from
so you don't get to play against Gryffindor next week." Ron chimed in loudly with a teasing grin, causing Aria to respond by turning around and rewarding him with a sarcastic smile and a quick flash of her middle finger.
Aria barely resisted the urge to hide under the blankets at Madam Pomfrey's immensely disapproving glare.
think Hannah should do to get Ernie to realize she wants to sleep with him?" She asked, giving him a genuinely curious look.
For a few seconds, neither of them seemed to know how to react, and when Aria turned to him, Draco frantically tried to come up with something to say. Thankfully, Andromeda managed to divert Aria's confused expression when she reached over and gave Teddy an affectionate kiss on the top of his head.
When they reached them, Aria noticed that Neville was comforting a crying Pansy in his arms while Hannah was sitting on the couch beside her, trying to console her by patting her on the back. Blaise, Zach and Morag all looked uneasy as they talked to Austin Flint, Harper Edgeworth and a few other 7th years in hushed voices.
"Because." Draco tried not to look away in embarrassment at the way she arched her eyebrows at him. "If we're doing this for the first time, I want...I want
"It certainly took you two idiots long enough." Blaise drawled wryly, smirking at him in amusement. "Now this may just be my imagination, but Potter looked like she was having a bit of trouble climbing up the stairs this morning. So does that mean you two—?"
"You and Zabini really didn't have to help me out back there." She began uncertainly, twiddling her thumbs. "Those girls were annoying but their words weren't really bothering me or anything, especially since I know how archaic their beliefs are. Not a lot of people are particularly accepting of a girl being sexually independent, after all. But still..." She rolled her eyes and nodded curtly.
"No, that's okay." She looked strangely worried at his offer and frantically shook her head. "I'm actually just heading for the station. I need to take the train back to London—"
reason for the gloves?" He finally drawled after a long moment of awkward silence on Potter's part, gesturing to the black leather gloves that covered the dark-haired girl's hands.
They stayed in that position for awhile, neither of them bothering to speak as they contented themselves with listening to the sound of the other's soft, deep breaths. After a few minutes of this, Aria surprised Draco when she suddenly sat up and turned around to face him with a strange, menacing glint in her eyes.
"Look, I know being a veela and having to deal with people expecting you to choose a mate all the time
Bentley noticed her reaction and his smile widened. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a single, white feather.
"I just wanted so badly for this to work! And I kept it because I — it was a way for me to—" Draco reached up and ran another shaking hand through his hair in frustration, messing up the blond strands even more. "In case you suddenly snapped to your senses and decided a relationship with me was a bad idea after all, I...I kept the feather as a sad, desperate way to reassure myself that I had a way to make you give me a second chance in case I fuck up." He stammered.
She froze at the urgency she heard in his voice and turned around slowly, staring back at him in confusion. Draco swallowed the dry, painful lump that had formed in his throat and gave her a slightly exasperated smile.
"You're with Miss Bulstrode." Slughorn told her, giving her a brief smile before gesturing for her to join Millicent on the other side of the room. "Now then, our last pair is…Miss Potter?"
He didn't notice that Aria had seen him — probably because he wasn't even staring directly at her, almost as though he was afraid that she would lash out at him if she noticed that he was there.
Then, after a few seconds, Macmillan's eyes widened in realization and he slowly lowered his gaze down to his crotch. When he saw the smug smile forming on Hannah's face, he let out a horrified scream. He whirled around, frantically pushing past the crowd of students behind him and running as fast as he could out of the hall. As soon as he was gone, a smirking Hannah tucked her wand back into her purse and calmly made her way back over to where Theodore Nott was waiting for her. She accepted the glass of wine he offered her and smiled flirtatiously at him before taking a dainty sip.
Draco immediately shook the expression away and smiled at her. He placed his hand on top of hers, giving her fingers a reassuring squeeze.
This time, Potter was the one who clenched her jaw as she froze mid-step, her hands clenching into fists by her sides. Surprisingly, she didn't take the bait. Instead, when she turned around to face him, she stared intently at him as though trying to gauge the expression on his face.
"You're still concussed, you idiot." He ignored Draco's halfhearted protests and stood up, removing his wand from its holster. "I'll come with you. We can cover more ground if we search for her together."
"I can do it." Greg told her as he straightened, watching as the potion began to simmer. "It gets pretty cold up in Gryffindor tower anyway, so I'll just leave it on the window next to my bed."
Blaise snorted at her question. "Those two are childhood best friends, actually. And they've liked each other since...
"Now let's see here...I think I'm supposed to make sure everyone gets partnered with someone they've never partnered with before—"
Narcissa's beaming smile slowly melted away at his words. Her shoulders slumped as she sighed and stared at him, studying his expression in concern.
Something heavy suddenly crashed into Draco, causing him to stumble forward as Bentley's friend, Jenson, finally snapped out of his witless staring and tackled Draco from behind, causing all three of them to end up falling to the ground.
be pressing charges, yes. Not just assault charges, but also for his failed attempt to force me to mate with him." Aria answered.
She ignored his obvious discomfort and opened another drawer behind him, causing him to wince at the soft, creaking sound.
"Wait, my colors didn't change!" Seamus Finnigan blurted out as he stared at his Gryffindor robes in mild disappointment. He paused and turned to glare at Dean Thomas beside him, scowling when he saw that his best friend's robes were now accented with the blue and white of Ravenclaw. "Hey! Why do
"Are you serious?" Aria snorted under her breath and rolled her eyes. "I gather that didn't exactly sit so well with Malfoy then?"
Curiously, he noticed that her hands were covered with a pair of sleek black gloves that went all the way up, almost reaching her elbows. At the beginning of summer, Draco had already noticed that Potter had taken to wearing a pair of huge
After sleepless nights of juggling his evening classes at the Wizengamot with his community service hours at the Elderly Ward of St. Mungo's, today was officially his last day, and already, Draco was feeling a little bit nostalgic. He had actually grown quite fond of some of the patients he'd been assigned to care for, and he'd certainly be lying to himself if he didn't admit that he also grew close to his supervising Healers over the last two years.
"Did you happen to see where Caelum McLaggen went today? I need to see him and tell him how much I want him." She asked, still in that same, seductively purring voice.
"We want you to make a public statement." Ilyana answered calmly, arching an elegant eyebrow at her words. She straightened in her seat and folded her hands primly on her lap. "We'll arrange all the necessary schedules and logistics of course.
Draco knew perfectly well that the response of the Head of Veela Affairs was made to address the latest piece published by Rita Skeeter.
"He's been nothing but pleasant company, actually." Luna smiled back at her. "And you look lovely too, Aria."
"I saw you using the feather with my own eyes! How am I misunderstanding anything?" She exploded at him, her angry shouts bouncing off the walls of the small room. "Did you and Pansy have some kind of elaborate scheme planned out for me or something? Is that why you
Draco broke himself out of his thoughts and looked up, frowning in confusion when he saw Ron Weasley standing across the table in front of him. He blinked and stared awkwardly up at him for a couple of seconds before Weasley let out an exasperated sigh and gestured impatiently for him to stand.
"Neville?! You're in Slytherin too?!" Ron blinked at the other boy, shaking his head when he saw his new robes. "Has the whole bloody world gone mad or have I entered some kind of parallel universe?!"
"Well, that's certainly better than having to take the underground toilet entrance regularly in Whitehall." He said wryly, earning a laugh from Aria as they entered her apartment building and she led him towards a small elevator near the corner of the lobby.
"I've used them four times." Aria cut her off, ignoring the horrified look on her face as she continued rearranging the mops back into the cabinet. "I used the Imperius Curse twice, both times on an innocent, hardworking goblin who worked in Gringotts because I was trying to break into a vault that wasn't mine. I also used the Cruciatus Curse twice – once on Alecto Carrow last year and once more back during our fifth year on Bellatrix Lestrange. Though I missed in her case.
"What are you two on about now?" Draco asked wearily when he finally reached them, sighing as he stopped and shifted his gaze back and forth between the other two Slytherins in exasperation.
She closed her eyes and tried to suppress her true form and force her wings back inside her body but for some reason, she
"You were also trying to play footsie with Malfoy under the table." Neville added, laughing at the look of absolute mortification on Hannah's face.
She suddenly let out a sharp, pained cry; and Draco felt the wand she had pointed at his chest being pulled away.
Draco ignored the nonplussed expression on Aria's face and tossed the set of robes at her, watching as she caught it easily in one hand and held it up to her face.
" Jenson whispered, his eyes wide and nervous as they darted back and forth between the two Slytherin boys in panic.
Blaise's grin widened and he leaned in even closer, causing Morag to stiffen when his lips brushed against her cheek.
but that was just me trying my luck. Never, in a million years, did I ever think that you would actually accept! And I'm sure there were dozens of other blokes who already asked you—"
Aria bit her lip and shifted awkwardly in her seat, all too aware of the sudden tension that seemed to descend upon their table.
Bentley's eyes gleamed as he stepped on her uninjured wing, effectively preventing Aria from crawling away.
Aria's expression grew dark, and she raised her wand, pointing its tip right against the middle of Fisher's forehead. She spoke her next words at the exact same time Draco raised the feather in his hand and shouted loudly enough for her to hear him.
"Draco, it's h—horrible!" Pansy stammered, and Aria noticed how pale she was and the way her eyes were red-rimmed from crying too much. "They think he did it! They all think he's guilty!" She sobbed.
"This is a joke, right?" Theodore Nott, who was a few steps to Aria's right, looked absolutely horrified as he stared down at his new, yellow and black Hogwarts uniform. "This is obviously a joke because there is no way in hell that I'm a bloody
Weasley grinned at Draco's reaction. "I promised that whoever manages to beat her, gets 500 galleons. But I charge them 1 galleon per try." He added smugly.
The hateful accusation in his voice suddenly caused Aria to grit her teeth and freeze mid-step. She clenched her jaw and turned around slowly to face him, her hands curling up into tight, angry fists by her sides.
Not surprisingly, the blonde was now decked out in a full Gryffindor uniform, complete with a matching scarf. When Aria raised an eyebrow at her in question, Luna answered her with a smile. "Oh, the Headmistress already resorted all of 7th years before you arrived. I'm in Gryffindor now, see?" She twirled around, proudly showing off the red and gold on her robes. "We had quite a lot of surprises too, actually. A number of Slytherins in my year got resorted into Hufflepuff and Gryffindor." She told them.
They stepped out on her floor, and after casting all of the required unlocking charms outside her flat, Aria used her muggle key to open the doors, motioning for Draco to follow her inside.
After a few minutes, an idea suddenly popped into her head. She grinned, turning to give the younger Slytherin a mischievous wink.
Somehow, Aria managed to croak out a contraceptive charm over herself and Draco took that as permission to throw away any remaining inhibition he had left. His blunt fingernails dug painfully into her hips as he began to fuck her with wild, merciless abandon.
Draco was broken out of his thoughts when another unfamiliar voice suddenly spoke up from behind their table, causing him and the rest of the Slytherins to look up from their books. This time, they were surprised when, instead of seeing another young, fanatical boy hoping to ask Aria to the Yule Ball, they came upon the sight of a nervous-looking Astoria Greengrass standing in front of Draco instead.
"It's fine." Hermione mirrored her weary expression and leaned back against her seat. "Anyway, it doesn't matter anymore. The school board was satisfied enough with the fact that the first years were responsible. They ordered the Headmistress to drop the investigation and have them expelled." She told them.
The hesitation on Aria's red face lingered as she took the sweater from him and tied it securely around her waist, effectively covering up the rip and her exposed thigh. They were both still blushing when Aria slowly sat back down into her seat and self-consciously adjusted the sweater over her legs a few more times.
Aria felt another surge of annoyance and tried to nudge the blond in an effort to make him shut up but Draco ignored her and went on.
By now, every single Slytherin in the common room was staring intently at them, most of which were probably waiting for either one of the two formal rivals to start blasting the other with an unforgivable curse.
Greg's eyes widened and he suddenly began screeching as he practically leaped towards her, twitching and jerking frantically in an attempt to shake the tarantula off.
Fleur looked up from the piece of parchment she had been reading from and gave them one last wave and wink.
Draco barely managed to put up a shield around himself before Aria hurled a gigantic blast of fire at his face.
Basically, any kind of magic that's supposed to entrance you or overwhelm your senses and make you lose your mental capacity."
He was pale and trembling as he pulled away from her and gently turned her around to face him. Aria watched as he swallowed nervously and lowered his gaze, staring very intently at their intertwined hands.
"I haven't yet." Aria looked amused at Ron's reaction as she answered, drawing Hermione's attention back to her. "I wasn't sure which one was interesting. Plus, I wanted to take one that you both were taking. I thought it would be nice since we don't have
"Because if the perpetuator actually succeeds in cutting off her wings and forcing a bond with a veela, then he becomes her mate. And if only the attacked veela can initiate the criminal proceedings against him, she…
He just never really had a reason to admit that to himself; or to believe that Potter would ever reciprocate his feelings.
Weasley! Stop thinking about that!" Aria snapped at him, blushing darker when Ron ended up laughing even more at the uncomfortable expression on her face. "Ugh…You're so…bleargh! I don't like you without Hermione." She complained.
She smiled and, very carefully, undid the knot of her towel, shivering as the damp cloth immediately slid down her body and curled into a crumpled heap on the floor.
She snatched Aria by her wrist and whisked her away from the crowd of reporters that had managed to accost her just as she was coming back from the bathroom. They made it to a secluded corner of the Hall, far outside the hearing range of anyone else; and Pansy finally turned around and blurted out in a shaky voice.
"Well, to name a few—" Wood paused and frowned to himself in thought. "—he liked to sleep in coffins, believing he was actually dead. He also believed that he needed to feed
Once their drunken group had made it past the school's tall, thick gates, Draco was broken out of his thoughts once more when Aria spoke up again, her eyes suddenly drawn to his left hand.
" Aria rolled her eyes again and tried to give him a comforting pat on the shoulder. "For all intents and purposes, the Yule Ball is nothing more than an evening of eating dinner together in our formal wear. You don't have to be so nervous about it." She told him.
just offer to help you get revenge you know." She pointed out, arching a perfectly plucked eyebrow at Hannah's startled expression. "If you don't want to send any of our boys after him, maybe I can teach you a nasty hex to use on him instead. I can guarantee that it's effective." She offered.
"Did you see anything interesting?" Morag chimed in, her eyes gleaming as she snapped her textbook shut and leaned across the table towards Hannah. "Who was on top?"
Fortunately for Draco, he saw that Aria ended up finishing the last of her butterbeer just then, and he used that as an excuse to hastily blurt out to everyone that they were going to get more drinks. Before Aria could protest (and before Luna could start talking more about Tlipmuddles — whatever the hell they were) Draco grabbed Aria by her hand and hastily pulled her away.
me!" Ron whined pathetically to Hermione beside him, causing his brown-haired girlfriend to roll her eyes and give him an admonishing glare.
just asking if you were ready for the match against us tomorrow. Especially with Aria on our team, this is probably our strongest line-up in years—"
"I really have to go." Aria murmured breathlessly. "I have to meet with McGonagall and the rest of the school board, remember? I can't be late for that." She added in a half-whine, half-moan when Draco didn't respond.
From the corner of her eye, she noticed that Malfoy had been watching their conversation. When he saw that she spotted him, however, he flushed and hastily turned back to listen to whatever it was Parkinson was telling him.
A few minutes later, after all of the nosy spectators who had gathered to watch Draco and Potter had dispersed and the remaining students in the common room resumed their previous activities, Pansy walked over to the seat Potter had just vacated. Ignoring the questioning look Blaise was giving her, she frowned and reached down to pick up the strange lone item that was left on the dark green seat.
"You know, I hadn't really thought about that." She admitted, looking sheepish. "To be honest, I haven't planned that far ahead yet. I'm still stuck on the part about how I'm supposed to seduce him actually, because I haven't the faintest idea how to do it. I've never done anything like this before—"
"They made a new, limited edition Chocolate Frog card of her. I got one just this morning." Greg reached into his pocket and pulled out a shiny, golden-edged card, showing it to them.
Aria's green eyes flashed and she opened her mouth again, ready to launch into another tirade about exactly 'why' it mattered but apparently, Hermione wasn't done talking.
Her grin faltered when Pansy flicked her eyes up and immediately silenced her with an exasperated glare.
Aria finally exploded as she slammed the window she had been cleaning shut and whirled around to glare at her. "You hate me –
. Those were the exact same words Aria, disguised as her veela self, had first spoken to him when they met each other in Hogsmeade that night.
Then, before she could say anything to stop him, he turned his face toward her hand, brushing his lips very gently against her soft, smooth skin. He felt the pulse along her wrist quicken at his actions and it spurred him on further, encouraged by the way Aria's breath hitched in her throat when he began dropping feather-light kisses against her fingers.
A few hours later, Draco realized that the Healers must have let slip to his patients that this was his last day at St. Mungo's, because a lot of them kept congratulating him and mentioning to him how sad they were that he was leaving. They also thanked him for his hard work in taking care of them during the last two years and wished him well in his future endeavors.
Aria waited patiently as Blaise gestured to the rest of the Slytherins, until eventually, everyone began to file out of the room. Ron, on the other hand, hesitated by the doorway. He glanced uncertainly at his two best friends in question.
her body to believe that you're the only one for her. She can never have a child with anyone other than you. Her veela blood will always yearn for you, and even if she
While Aria just blinked and continued to stare awkwardly at the scene, unsure of how to proceed, Pansy let out a defeated sigh and walked over to stand at the foot of Hannah's bed.
"Personally, I think the Slytherin colors look quite dashing on you, Aria. They bring out the green in your eyes." A soft, dreamy voice behind them had spoken, causing them all to turn around to find Luna Lovegood walking up to their group with a small smile on her face.
After a few minutes, however, Aria noticed that Hannah was still staring at her from across the table; and it eventually came to the point where Aria couldn't stand it anymore. She gritted her teeth and looked up, meeting Hannah's doe-eyed smile at her with an exasperated glare.
Aria winced again at the loud sound of a heavy door slamming shut, followed by a tense, awkward silence. More than a little curious at this point, Aria peeked her head out slowly from behind the couch and glanced around the common room.
He raked a hand through his blond hair a few times, styling it carefully with gel until he was satisfied that it fell perfectly over his eyes. Afterwards, he adjusted the cufflinks on the sleeves of his coat, fastening them securely over his wrists.
too bright; and the whispers rippling through the crowd of students around her were too noisy. She covered her ears and hid her face by crouching down into a fetal position on the floor. Even then, she felt the weight of everyone's stares and she sensed her own veela pheromones going haywire as they permeated the air.
Draco's eyebrows furrowed together and he frowned at the steely glint in her eyes. He hoped he was imagining things, but it was almost as though Aria was intentionally trying to provoke him into a fight.
"I do." Aria answered plainly, meeting his gaze. "Whether or not Gryffindor has a more experienced line-up of players than we do, I can honestly say, for certain, that Slytherin's dynamic as a team is much better."
you make her associate with liars and murderers and Death Eater scum like you?!" Bentley was shouting at him again, completely oblivious to way Aria was massaging her temples in angry exasperation behind him.
A few minutes later, as she exited and returned to the corridor, she found a smug looking Draco waiting for her from where he was leaning against the wall beside the bathroom doors. His arms were crossed over his chest and he had one foot propped up backwards against the wall in such a pretentious pose that Aria actually considered hexing the handsome prat.
Aria finally spoke up for the first time since their conversation started. She looked up from her plate and leveled the other girl with a particularly menacing glare. Unfortunately, given the utterly embarrassed flush on her face, she knew it probably didn't have the same effect.
"Well—" Aria winced at her question and bit her lip, her gaze sliding down to the floor. "—not exactly."
hate each other?" Morag suddenly asked, surprising everyone with her bluntness as they all turned to look at the former Ravenclaw. For her part, Morag looked completely unaffected by all their stares, her attention focused solely on Draco and Aria. "Because I've read from a lot of books that the kind of childhood rivalry you two had is usually just a manifestation of unresolved sexual tension between two people who are secretly attracted to one another. Would you say that was true in your case?"
"I believe that's all the time Miss Potter has allotted for us today." Ilyana announced, smiling graciously as she motioned for the Aurors around the area to begin clearing a path for Aria to walk through. "If any of you have any other concerns, feel free to contact myself or any other of my fellow spokespersons—"
"And I don't suppose the whole monogamy thing that comes with marriage doesn't turn you off either?" Blaise chimed in, grinning obnoxiously at Morag from across the table.
"No thanks to you, Butterfingers!" Austin snapped at him, knocking the other boy on the head with his gloves. "What the hell were you doing back there?! Have you never played quidditch before?!"
Aria entertained the reporters for pictures and interviews while they were there. Something about promoting Hogwarts as a prestigious, educational institution to the rest of Wizarding Britain or whatnot.
Neville finally recovered from his shock long enough to shake his head, smirking as he reached out and took the discarded box of chocolates away from Hannah. "Okay, who has a free period after breakfast? Someone needs to take her to Professor Slughorn for an antidote." He sighed in exasperation.
, do you?" Draco's eyes flashed; and, reacting in a way that had become instinctive to him from all his fights with Aria over the years, his anger
"It's you isn't it, sweetie?" Skeeter smiled as her large, feathery green quill floated up into the air and swiped playfully against the side of Neville's cheek.
At the thought of George, however, her expression sombered. She lowered her gaze and pretended to pick at her pajama bottoms so that she wouldn't have to look at Ron as she spoke.
"To anyone else? I doubt it." Zach shrugged at her, his lips twitching upwards into another grin. "Despite not being talented in the damn sport myself, I
"Don't pressure him like that, Lewis." Hannah tutted, giggling as she stopped beside the cabinet of healing potions behind Draco and began to rifle through its contents. "Draco and Aria were already mated since we graduated from Hogwarts. That means they're practically married already. And besides, knowing Aria, she's not the type of girl to just wait around for Draco to propose." She remarked.
"Yes, Headmistress. Just…please give us the benefit of the doubt." Pansy stood behind Corey's seat, clutching her brother's outstretched hand tightly in hers.
"What are we talking about?" She asked, adjusting the scarf around her neck and drawing Draco's attention to the fact that she was wearing her casual winter clothing instead of her school robes.
Everyone up in the stands watched with bated breath as Aria flattened herself against her Nimbus 2001 and reached a gloved hand out, her fingers inching closer and closer towards the fluttering golden ball.
Neither of them spoke at first, both unsure how the other would react, until finally, Aria broke the tension when she began to laugh. Draco followed, his lips twitching in amusement as he tried to brush his drenched hair back from his face. Smiling, she reached up to do it for him, using her gloved hand to brush the blond hair gently away from his eyes. She used the same gesture to caress his cheek, her eyes soft as she stared up at him, before she blushed and slowly pulled away.
Draco snickered under his breath at Pansy's shrill voice and began pouring some pumpkin juice into his goblet.
this year." Draco corrected her, a small smile tugging on the corner of his lips. "I've always wanted to play as a chaser, actually. I just tolerated being a seeker because no one else on the bloody team was even
They stared intently at each other for a long time, both sets of eyes unwilling to blink, and before she realized what was happening, Aria began to feel a little lightheaded when she caught a whiff of his scent again. This time, the pleasant minty smell of his aftershave was intermingled with something that she knew was
She relaxed against him and yawned, closing her eyes and resting her head against his shoulder. Meanwhile, the rest of the 8th years settled into the surrounding seats around them and began conversing softly amongst themselves.
Draco immediately flushed at Pansy's mocking drawl and glared at her. He ignored her amused smirk as he reached for his handkerchief and hastily used it to wipe his mouth. Fortunately, he was saved from the need to think of an equally sarcastic retort because Neville decided to take pity on him by patting his shoulder and changing the topic.
"I was just thinking about how, apparently, Gryffindor's favorite heroine isn't as virtuous as everyone makes her out to be. I wonder how your fan club will react when they find out Harriah Potter is actually a Slytherin after all. Think of all those children and their broken hearts." She let out a dramatic sigh and shook her head.
He noticed the way Aria took a very discreet step towards him and snarled at her, baring his fangs even more and pressing the tip of his wand harder against Draco's throat.
"Thank you for being so honest with me and telling me that you're not interested anymore. I mean, it
"I wasn't talking to you, Draco!" Pansy snapped back at him, ignoring the affronted scowl on his face as she crossed her arms and sneered down at Aria's stiff form.
"Yes, the spell is also in ancient veelish. However, unlike the Feather Curse, you do not need a feather to make a veela reveal her true form. You simply need to speak the proper incantation
Madam Pomfrey wouldn't let her leave the bed until her wing finished healing, so she had to rely on Ron, Hermione, and Neville to drop by every day to give her the required readings and assignments she missed in her classes.
to her about Pansy tutoring him that night. Though why Greg would do such a thing, or why Pansy (or Blaise for that matter) would bother cursing innocent students into vandalizing school property didn't make any sense, especially since doing so would only make people hate Slytherin even more.
Aria let out a high-pitched squeal anyway, inadvertently drawing the attention of everyone nearby when she jumped at him, throwing herself into his arms and wrapping her legs around his waist. Narcissa and Andromeda both smiled affectionately at the scene, watching as Draco laughed and caught Aria easily in his arms. He lifted her up, silencing the rest of her excited rambling with a long, affectionate kiss.
She leaned back against her seat and crossed her arms over her chest, giving him a strange look. "The way he looks at me makes me feel more alive and real than I've ever felt before, and it scares me a little bit." She whispered.
; and she actually had to push lightly at his chest to make him ease up a little until she was more comfortable and the pain receded back into pleasure.
"Your last day of community service, of course." Andromeda answered cheerfully as Aria passed Teddy back to her. "And let's not forget that
"So? We can give them an anatomy lesson then." Draco retorted, his voice slightly muffled as his face was still buried against her chest. "Besides, they should thank us for it. There isn't any sex education here at Hogwarts after all, so they'd be learning a lot from watching us."
He had spent a good chunk of his morning prowling around Hogsmeade like some kind of besotted stalker, asking the entire village if they had seen a girl who fit the description he gave them. Unfortunately, his efforts were to no avail because not one of the people he had spoken to had seen his mystery girl. Most of them had just given him a pitying look, probably feeling sorry for this poor young sod who was so obviously infatuated with a girl he couldn't even get a hold of.
"What's wrong? Why are you all still here?" He asked but the other boy simply shook his head at him and gestured quietly to the Great Hall's doors. Following his gaze, Draco's eyes widened when he finally saw exactly what it was that the horrified students gathered around them were gaping at.
do, damn it!" Draco exploded at her, his eyes flashing as he looked up again and pinned her in place with his glare. "You heard him! Apparently, according to
. I'll do it when we get back and everyone's excitement over Weasley and Granger's wedding dies down."
Because as it turns out, Draco had been chasing after the exact same person all along, and not only was the whole thing so bloody ridiculous, it also proved to him more than anything how utterly helpless he was against his attraction to Aria Potter that he seemed to gravitate toward the infuriating girl no matter what bloody form she took.
At the time, Aria had let her suspicions go because Greg had told her the next morning about how Pansy had spent that night tutoring him, but now that Aria thought about it, the fact that Greg claimed that Pansy had tutored him that night shouldn't really have discounted her from being a suspect.
"Because my new stepdad is at home and, well, let's just say we're not exactly fond of each other." He took a quick sip from the flask and scoffed. "I didn't want to cause any trouble for him and my mom again so I decided to go back to Hogwarts before my mom tries to file for another divorce."
say no, Aria." Blaise interrupted her sharply, giving her another devastatingly handsome smile. "Look, to be honest, I deliberately invited you last because I knew you'd react this way. Longbottom already said yes. So did Smith, Macdougal, and Abbott." He told her smugly.
Even now, while she was preoccupied with her conversation with Granger, Weasley and Longbottom, there were students, particularly
"It's okay, it'll be fine." Aria managed a nervous, stranged laugh and began pointing her wand at the unmoving spider. "Don't move, okay? I'll get it off, it's no big deal. I think it's a tarantula, that's all—"
"That doesn't mean anything." Draco scoffed again, rolling his eyes and giving her a derisive look. "For all I know, the only reason you helped us was because of your ridiculous heroic tendency to want to save every goddamn thing that moves." He mocked.
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw a bright beam of magic heading right for him and instinctively, he ducked. The spell whipped past him, hitting the tree in front of him and causing it to burst into flames. He heard Fisher curse loudly and spun around, whipping his wand sharply through the air and sending a hex towards him. To Draco's frustration, the spell missed and Fisher vanished from his line of light, only to reappear a few seconds later to Blaise's left.
To prove her point, Fleur transfigured the empty water goblet on the table into a pair of scissors and actually tried to cut a stray lock of hair that had fallen into her face. To everyone's amazement, the scissors
In the very center of the hall, there was a large empty space that functioned as a dance floor; and where the Teacher's table used to be, an elevated platform had been set up for Stubby Boardman and the rest of the Hobgoblins — all of whom were currently in the middle of performing an upbeat song that several couples were already dancing to.
"Maybe all of the Weasleys are just genetically predisposed to be Gryffindors forever." Hermione mused with a giggle, meeting the glare Ron gave her with a careless shrug. "Oh don't look at me like that. That wasn't an insult, Ronald."
"Alright, let's move on before these two jump each other." Blaise ignored the warning glare Malfoy gave him and looked up at everyone again, raising his glass up to them in a mock toast. "Now then, since preliminary introductions are all over and the ice seems to have been broken, why don't we take this opportunity to say a little something interesting about ourselves? I'd also really like it if we could all start calling each other by our first names too. I figured it's only right, we
Pansy blanched at his words and tried tugging on her hand again, her eyes darting nervously around the empty corridor.
"The last thing I would like to clarify — for the sake of all those who were mentioned in Skeeter's article about the Yule Ball — is that I did
"I thought they decided to put the investigation on hold for now?" Ron pointed out, looking confused.
She cleared her throat loudly, breaking Draco out of his trance as he blushed and hastily looked away, pretending to busy himself with checking the ingredients in their baskets. Aria ignored the rapid pounding of her heart as she scooted closer to the fire and wrapped her arms around herself for warmth.

Aria to blink and stare at the petite former Ravenclaw in surprise. "Because if that was your own unique – albeit needlessly dramatic – way of telling everyone that you feel awkward about being here, then don't worry. I think we're all feeling particularly stupid right now anyway. That doesn't mean we're not willing to
"Can I see that?" Aria's eyebrows arched up when something on the pamphlet caught her attention. She took the pamphlet from Hermione and browsed through it, her eyes widening at one of the course selections.
Aria was interrupted when a small group of squealing middle aged witches suddenly crowded around her, forcefully separating her from Draco. They gushed excitedly about how they were big fans of hers and begged her for an autograph, but Aria barely paid them any attention. She watched as the expectant expression on Draco's face fell, and he shifted awkwardly a few times before beginning to back away from the growing circle of fans around her.
." Draco drawled back, and he couldn't help injecting a bit of malice into his voice as he went on. "Though I play as a Chaser now; and our Seeker is actually Potter here. I'm her Captain, by the way."
As the witches and wizards around him slowly dispersed, Draco began to panic that Aria might see him. He pulled the hood of his cloak lower to hide his face and hastily began making his way out of the main atrium. Unfortunately, just as he reached the middle of the lobby, a familiar voice suddenly called out to him, forcing Draco to stop in his tracks.
"It's not my fault. I wasn't expecting so many people to suddenly wake up this early." She said sheepishly.
Ron snorted at that and shook his head. "I hate to break it to you, mate, but if you're out and about in public like that, most people will still be staring at you. Even without your scar." He quipped with a snicker, causing Hermione to glare irritably at him and stomp hard on his foot.
To Draco's astonishment, Blaise's features softened at his words; and there was a smile that lingered on his face as he looked up and glanced fondly over to where Luna was standing with the rest of the wedding entourage by the dance floor.
The way his fingers squeezed against the burning hot skin of her thigh caused Aria to keen and give out another high-pitched, breathless sound that Draco's entire vision blurred and his mind went blank.
"I figured it would be much quieter for me that way. Less chance of attracting attention and all." She told him, shrugging. "Besides, the location is actually perfect for me. It's very close to the Ministry. And at the very end of that block over there, there's actually a phone booth that goes right down to the Ministry's atrium."
"I'm sorry!" Aria flinched and shrugged at her, reaching up and scratching sheepishly at the back of her head. "Look, I don't really know the appropriate thing to say in these kinds of situations." She admitted ruefully.
"I just realized how much I sounded like a sap. Do you think I'm pathetic?" Draco smirked and shook his head at himself. "But it's true, though. I think I've
They arched an eyebrow and considered her words for a few seconds before answering her with a noncommittal shrug.
She stifled a groan and, very discreetly, shuffled away from him. Unfortunately, Draco seemed to have picked up on her reaction anyway because he arched an eyebrow at her, one corner of his lips quirking upwards into a smirk.
"Oh." She replied lamely, glancing over the boy's shoulder and meeting Hermione's questioning look with a helpless shrug. She didn't exactly know what to say in response to something like that. "That's uh…Don't worry about it. I'm just glad you're okay—"
"I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast, Mister Malfoy." She greeted him with a brief smile and motioned him towards the chair in front of her table. "But, if it's alright with you, I'm going to need a bit of your blood. I'll need it for the special salve I'm making to help heal Miss Potter's broken wing." She paused when she saw the look of surprise on Draco's face.
a shame." The girl agreed quietly, but Draco couldn't help but notice that she was still giving him a strange look.
McGonagall gestured them towards the doors and the four of them hurried out of the office in silence, rushing down the Gargoyle Staircase and heading back out into the school's corridors.
Her cheeks were suddenly flushed pink and her green eyes were glowing as they pierced right through him, seemingly moving up and down his form as though she wanted to jump on him or
Theo rolled his eyes and took a sip from his wine. "Hannah, I already told you. I don't particularly care for wedding details, you just tell me when and where to show up and I promise I'll be there, tux and all."
Fortunately, Neville picked up on her body language immediately as he reached out and grabbed Aria by the shoulder, forcing her to sit back down. Irritated, Aria growled under her breath and was just about to snap at Pansy instead when, to her surprise, she noticed that Malfoy had drawn Pansy's attention when he snatched her by the arm and turned her so that the short-haired girl could see his warning glare.
"Cast an incendio on the lot of them, for all I care." Aria turned back to her textbook and flipped another page.
Draco's languorous, half-lidded gaze actually swept up and down her body, causing the skin on the back of her neck to prickle with warmth.
Much like the last time Draco had seen her, she was wearing beautifully tailored robes in a flattering, aquamarine shade and her long blonde hair was twisted up into a neat chignon onto the top of her head, not a single strand of which was out of place.
"He was—" Pansy flinched and ducked her head, and Aria couldn't help but notice that there was a miserable tilt to her lips. "—well, we dated back in sixth year." She admitted grudgingly.
Ironically, none of you made mention of these two details this afternoon." Fleur pointed out with a slightly arched eyebrow.
"But then...That kind of unnatural beauty would certainly stand out." Morag pointed out with a slight frown.
When Hannah's mood seemed to dampen at her own words and she looked away, Aria unwittingly found herself the recipient of the deeply admonishing glare Pansy was shooting her from across the table.
The sight of his hunched shoulders, and the way he looked as though he was about to leave when Aria mentioned his name caused something in her chest to squeeze painfully. Suddenly, she realized how utterly ridiculous this whole thing was — what they were doing to each other — and she didn't care anymore if they both made mistakes or which one of them was wrong.
Blaise continued. "As a school prefect and all, I'm obligated to remind you that sneaking your girlfriend into the boys' dorm and letting her sleep with you on your bed at night is strictly forbidden."
Draco swallowed, lowering his gaze to his shoes. "I don't know, okay?! To be honest, I just...I kept it for an entirely selfish reason and I—"
His hips jerked upwards and a loud, startled groan escaped him as Aria hummed in delight, swirling her tongue around him a few times. She
When Draco and Blaise continued to glare suspiciously at her, she rolled her eyes at them and gestured to their fallen housemates.
Despite the fact that Blaise continued to ignore his persistent queries all week about what exactly he knew of Potter's strange behavior this year, Draco still found himself in a pretty good mood for the rest of that morning.
"Are you out of your mind?!" Pansy screeched as she stood up from her seat and walked over to the railings to glare furiously up at Aria's form in the air. "Potter, I don't know if you remember this, but my brother has a heart condition! He can't go around flying like that—"
Draco noticed the way Aria kept blushing and sneaking curious looks at him from the corner of her eye. From the bewildered look on her face, it was obvious that she was wondering why Draco was suddenly acting the way he was. To be honest, he couldn't really blame her for being confused, especially since this was the first time Draco had actually spoken to her since their embarrassing little spat in the library.
"Aria Potter!" Corey blurted out, his face instantly lighting up with recognition. "It's an honor to meet you!" He rushed out, ignoring the way Pansy was trying to glare him into silence. "I mean, I see you all the time in the Slytherin Common Room but this is the first time I'm actually getting to see and talk to you, face-to-face!" He exclaimed loudly, practically bouncing on his heels.
Draco sighed and looked away, suddenly realizing how exhausted he was. "No, I know. I wasn't thinking about the match."
"Potter, what is this? An interrogation?" Draco let out a loud, weary sigh and finally turned around to face her, giving her an exasperated glare. "Please tell me there's a
"It's not that simple, Potter!" Pansy snapped back, looking annoyed at her instantaneous reaction. "Do you know what would happen if my parents found out that I was stupid enough to lose my virginity to a boy like that?! Dumb enough to put myself into such a precarious situation? To a half-blood, no less! It would be a
She took out her own wand and cast a drying spell on their baskets before levitating them both under the invisible umbrella Draco had cast over their heads. Afterwards, she bent down, picking her discarded glasses off the ground. When she saw how dirty they had become, she shot him an irritated glare, only for Draco to answer her with a nonchalant shrug.
"But you know, it kind of makes sense. The two of you were always drawn to each other even before all this veela rubbish. And the git always liked 'pulling on your pigtails', so to speak." Ron added with a snort.
Aria's frown deepened, thinking back to how she had definitely encountered Blaise when he entered the common room after finishing his prefect rounds that night. She remembered that it had been pretty late at the time, definitely past eleven. He had seen her lounging on the couch and given her a sleepy wave before he trudged up the stairs towards the boys' dorm.
"Was he real?" Finnigan asked again, ducking his head and giving Wood a sheepish grin. "Just curious. My dad's mentioned him a few times in some muggle literature."
Trembling, her legs inadvertently began to close again but Draco used his hands to clutch tightly at her thighs, keeping them firmly apart.
that came from someone she didn't personally know – especially after Ron's near death experience with a box of amortentia-spiked chocolates in sixth year.
"For your information, I can be sexy when I want to be! I just never bothered showing it to either of you twats! It would be a waste of my sexuality and womanly charms!" Pansy huffed, oblivious to the way Draco and Blaise had to immediately duck their heads to stifle their snickers.
"Because I didn't want you to think that this was all because of that!" Aria blurted out, her voice growing louder and sounding choked with emotion. "I didn't want you to think that my being a veela is in any way related to how I feel about you! Or about
"Aren't you glad you don't have to hide your true form anymore? I still can't believe you suppressed it for almost a year. That must have been exhausting." Luna mentioned as she scrutinized Aria's appearance.
"See?! See?! You're acting all Slytherin already! And it's barely been ten minutes!" Ron pointed out, scowling as he shoved her back in retaliation and rubbed his sore shoulder.
negative symptom of vampirism is actually less commonly known. Can anyone venture a guess as to what it is?"
"Nice to see our beloved golden princess finally up and about. You certainly took your sweet time procrastinating in the hospital wing, did you?" He drawled.
From where he was sitting between Seamus Finnigan and Anthony Goldstein at the Gryffindor table, Ron was too busy wolfing down his food to notice the exchange between Aria and Hermione but eventually, he looked up and saw Aria smirking at him. He set his goblet down and gave her a mock glare back, sticking his tongue out at her.
Before he realized what he was doing, he was walking towards one of the nearby bookshelves and scanning the titles lined up along the shelves. A significant amount of time later, after Draco finished scanning a thick encyclopedia of ancient magical symbols, he took a quick glance at his watch and realized, with a start, that he had just wasted away nearly
"At least Theo's not the type to hold out on her if she wants sex." Pansy snorted, rolling her eyes.
She caught him staring fondly at her hair, noticing for the first time that, apparently, Draco's eager hands had somehow messed it up again because her braid was gone and her long black locks were utterly disheveled, hanging past her shoulders and trailing all the way down to the floor.
A soft chorus of amused chuckles erupted from the crowd, and even Draco couldn't help cracking a small smile.
At first, Aria wasn't quite sure if she understood Hannah correctly so for the next couple of seconds, she opted to just stare blankly at the blonde girl with a stunned, completely befuddled look on her face.
As they entered the Great Hall, they noticed that most of their new housemates were already eating breakfast at the Slytherin table.
hearing any of this! La la la – can't hear anything!" She sing-songed while frantically shaking her head.
"Where were you two anyway?" Blaise ignored the murderous glare Pansy was still giving him and directed his attention at Draco. "I was looking for you this afternoon."
At first, she was hesitant about spending more of her time with the Slytherins, worried about how Ron would probably throw a fit and accuse her of 'abandoning' him all over again. Thankfully, her concerns were settled when she noticed that Ron also seemed to be making a couple of new friends - guy friends - among the Gryffindors this year. Merlin knows how much he needed them, especially since he had just spent the last seven years of his life hanging out with two girl best friends.
"I have my reasons." Aria tried not to blush under Pansy's scrutinizing stare and looked away. "And besides, the less people who know about this, the better. So keep your damn mouth shut, Parkinson."
As she stared directly into his eyes, entranced by the bright swirl of colors in the middle of his irises, she felt lightheaded and her head began to feel fuzzy. Suddenly, without her consent, all of these obtrusive, unwelcome thoughts began to flood her mind.
She tried to speak, but when it came out as a choked sob, Draco's arms tightened around her and he leaned down, hushing her softly as he cupped her face with his hands and caressed her cheeks. "You're stuck with me, Potter...And even if you eventually tell me that you hate me and scream at me and tell me to go to hell, I will
say I expected you to forgive me!" Pansy countered, flinching at Aria's outburst. "I'm just trying to explain to you
Draco forced himself to snap out of his trance and held his wand out, squeezing it tightly with his fingers. Then, ignoring the panic and fear in his chest, he stepped right in front of the fiendfyre; dangerously close enough that it almost singed the sleeve of his robes.
"Is it painful to manifest as a veela? You know, with the wings and all?" Weasley pressed further, oblivious to the way Aria was giving him a scathing glare from the seat beside his.
though, but I don't think it's necessary in this case." Blaise added cheerfully, winking at Neville.
have to do is show up, at the right time and place, and give a detailed account to the public of exactly what happened that night. That way, not only do we pressure the Wizengamot into properly punishing Bentley Fisher for what he did, but we also get to refute everything Rita Skeeter has been saying about you and the veela community in the Daily Prophet."
"Have you forgotten that I was the one who shouted for us to hand her over to the Dark Lord during the siege on Hogwarts?!" Pansy retorted, her cheeks burning at the memory. "I doubt she's forgiven me about that little incident, Draco!"
head of our house for a reason." Blaise pointed out. "Look, it's really not that hard. I'll start and everyone else, can just follow my lead." He took another sip from his drink before giving them all another perfectly well-practiced, handsome smile.
"Pansy, I'm getting really tired of this." Blaise scoffed and gave her a pointed glare. "In case you haven't noticed, they're wearing the same uniform you are."
She cast a quick, surveying glance around the room, scouring the many smaller, individual round tables that had replaced the house tables around the Hall in search of her housemates.
"By the way," Draco surprised himself when he spoke again, his hooded gaze dropping down to focus intently on his shoes. "About the other night in the common room, Potter—" He felt blood rushing into his cheeks when Aria visibly stiffened at his words and turned to look at him.
They stood there in the middle of the street, kissing and laughing and hugging each other in the cold, and the sight of them — two young lovers standing along the sidewalk of Russel Square — must have made such a pretty scene that pedestrians started to stop and stare at them. From the corner of his eye, Draco saw a small crowd of muggle onlookers beginning to form nearby, some of which were even holding a strange, rectangular contraption in their hands and pointing it in their direction.
"As long as we don't use any of our special 'skills' during the match." He answered, winking at her. "So are you interested?"
"Are you kidding?" Pansy snorted as she crossed her arms over her chest and gestured with a nod to where Theodore Nott was still throwing a screaming, hissy fit at McGonagall. "Would you rather be like Nott is right now? I mean, who knew that he was secretly a Puff under that cocky big head of his? His father's going to disown him." She snickered under her breath.
Only for her to cry out in pain and pull her hand back sharply when Fisher growled and bat carelessly at the bludgers again – but this time, his rage caused his aim to be
Aria sighed in exasperation and looked up from her DADA textbook, shooting an annoyed glare at Ron across the room. He was currently bent over the large pile of 'get well' gifts in the corner, a white box of chocolate truffles in his hand.
"That wand hasn't worked for you since the end of the war. Didn't you find it strange that it suddenly works
the Gryffindor Chasers between them. The two huge Slytherin Beaters slammed into the Gryffindors from both sides, trying to make them swerve off course and crash into the bleachers or the goal posts. Unfortunately, it only worked once – in the case of Megan Jones, but only because she was a tiny little girl who probably hadn't seen it coming.
She hadn't realized it at the time, because she was also under the impression that Draco had been trying to kill her when he suddenly started attacking her in that sixth-floor boys' bathroom (and firing a Cruciatus Curse at her, no less) but that look in his eyes should have tipped her off that day. It dawned on her now that, perhaps, the only reason he started attacking her was because he felt just as
Luna blinked at him again, and she continued to give him a genuinely bewildered look. "You weren't the one who imprisoned me. Your Aunt Bellatrix and those other Death Eaters did. You even risked your life to sneak us some food so that we wouldn't starve."
"Well...It is similar to what muggles call...plastic surgery?" Fleur laughed when she saw even more confused expressions among the students and rushed to elaborate further. "Imagine every physical flaw or deformity you think you have. So let's say...a crooked nose, bushy hair, poor eyesight, crooked teeth, perhaps a scar? Or varicose veins? All of these and more are magically corrected once a veela manifests. But of course, the transformation also comes with wings, glowing skin and
heard of the birds and the bees?" Morag suddenly spoke up, the flat tone of her voice earning another chorus of amused laughter from their housemates.
Aria suddenly paused mid-step and turned around slowly, meeting the genuinely confused look on Draco's face with a fond smile.
When Zach's eyes widened and he continued to stare quietly at him, Draco stood back up and held a hand out to him.
He bent down, trailing a path of soft kisses along the skin of her neck. His hands snaked up her back, fingers digging into her hair and untangling the tight braid on the top of her head until all of the long, black locks came tumbling over shoulders, down her back, all the way down to dangle above her shoes.
Ron and Aria were in the middle of a fierce chess game that afternoon in the school courtyard when Hermione suddenly bounded over to join them, plopping herself down onto the grass beside Aria.
Fortunately, Draco was facing the other direction and hadn't seen her approach yet and Aria debated briefly with herself whether turning around and fleeing back towards the castle was a viable option.
He tried to ignore the nervousness in his voice as he spoke, waiting patiently as Aria processed the situation and continued to stare dumbly at his hand. Finally, after what seemed like
It wasn't signed but the moment he finished reading the first paragraph, he realized who it was from and he could barely contain the small smile that began tugging on his lips.
students. The only thing Aria could seem to remember about Blaise from those times, however, was how Slughorn had often referred to Blaise's mother during their conversations as being a very beautiful witch who had already gone through quite a number of rich, influential husbands.
"Yes, Miss Abbott. Not everyone." McGonagall confirmed, nodding. "As. I said, only those of you the Sorting Hat remembered as being compatible for another house back during your first year
He crashed into a big group of reporters, including Rita Skeeter, knocking them all down to the floor in a tangled pile of limbs and bodies. As Bentley scrambled to his feet, Aria knelt back down onto the ground beside Draco's unconscious form. She was just about to use a spell to wake him up when she heard Bentley screaming at her from several feet away.
of this is our fault!" She blurted out, her voice cracking as another sob tore itself from her throat.
"It's fine." Neville cut her off with a reassuring smile and firm shake of his head. He offered her a hand to help her with her books. "Besides, I could use a short break from all this studying. Shall we?"
"Let's get going. The rest of the team is already waiting for us." Blaise grabbed Aria lightly by her sleeve and began steering her towards the exit of the library.
She was Harriah Potter, the savior of the wizarding world and defeater of the Dark Lord. Everyone loved her and both adults and young children looked up to her. She had only good things to expect from the rest of her life.
I was just—" Hannah blushed at her words and furiously shook her head. "I wasn't asking for your opinion about Ernie. I just wanted your opinion on what I should wear!" She snapped.
He chuckled and reached across the table, taking her half-empty glass of wine and downing it all in one long sip. As he set the glass back down and flitted his hesitant gaze back and forth between her and the dance floor, Aria bit back a smile.
"You know, Malfoy." Blaise let out a dramatic sigh as he placed another hand on Draco's shoulder and gave him a firm shake. "I get that you're pissed and all about this mystery girl of yours but you didn't have to be such an ass and take it out on Potter like that. I mean, she
"And besides, in the same way that magical society likes to hold veelas accountable for their allure, wouldn't you all agree that it's only fair to also hold vampires accountable for their fixations? Or more importantly, their powers?"
"Good morning to you too, Hermione." Aria greeted her in a sarcastic tone of voice as she watched the brunette huff again before depositing all of her books onto the foot of Aria's bed. "What's got you into such a delightful mood?" She asked.
Pansy watched, nonplussed, as Aria very calmly pointed her wand at her hair and cast a water charm, carefully directing the stream that spewed from her wand's tip towards the fierce-looking flames that were beginning to climb up her braid. After a few seconds of this, the fire eventually died down and Aria tucked her wand back into her pocket. When she reached up behind her to tie her hair back up, however, Aria realized that the fire had burned right through her hair tie so that instead of clasping a tightly woven braid, her fingers ended up buried in her loose, ankle-length black hair.
"Blimey, is that you, Aria?! I was wonderin' when you'd be assigned to me! How are you feelin'? No more injuries? I heard you just got out of the hospital wing." Hagrid greeted, eliciting a laugh from Aria as she rushed toward the half-giant and enveloped him in a brief hug.
"It's not his fault! It's probably because I've always been so reserved and shy with him all these years. I can't help it, it's how I was raised! I was always so afraid of how he'd react if I became too flirty or aggressive." Hannah argued, tugging insistently on the sleeve of Pansy's robes.
Draco stood back and watched quietly as Ron adjusted his hold on Aria and left, quickly making his way across the quidditch field back towards the castle. He couldn't help but notice how Weasley was particularly careful about where he touched Aria, taking great care not to make any direct contact with any exposed areas of her skin.
got me and my family out of Azkaban." He countered easily, shaking his head to make the confusing thoughts go away. "So as much as I want to, I can't exactly go back to tormenting you and making your cauldron explode during potions anymore." He drawled.
Despite the fact that it was the very first Christmas they celebrated together as a family after the war, the past few days Draco had spent with his father and mother in Malfoy Manor hadn't exactly been an enjoyable affair.
"Alright then, Greg." Aria couldn't help giggling at the adorably embarrassed expression on his flushed face before she decided to take pity on him and turned her attention back to her textbook.
When he leaned in and did just that, Aria shivered and she reluctantly turned around under the blankets to face him.
cats, Aria." Hermione countered in a matter-of-fact tone of voice. "You're just afraid of them, there's a difference. Besides, that's hardly your fault, the book we read says that it's in your nature to be afraid of them—"
"What about the Gryffindor Prefect who claims he was attacked that night? The one they found passed out in the common room." Aria cut her off in a sharp voice.
"Damn it." Aria was already digging through her pockets for another hair tie when she realized that Pansy had become strangely quiet.
sort of link to the Death Eaters and Voldemort. Even I think it's beginning to be a bit unreasonable as of late—"
"Potter." She cleared the squeakiness away from her voice and allowed her hooded gaze to trail up and down Aria's hair before flicking back up and settling on the tense expression on Aria's face. "Your hair was literally on fire for a good couple of seconds and yet, not a single

Luckily, their magic skills weren't all that impressive, and Draco had no problems deflecting their attacks.

was outside, patrolling the grounds with Hagrid at the time the incident was presumed to take place. Meanwhile, the other prefect…Well, I didn't see where he was."
He didn't say anything else after that, but thankfully, Narcissa seemed to understand the sudden change in his mood and didn't push him any further on the subject. She shifted the rest of their conversation to lighter topics, and, much to his chagrin, she began regaling him with stories once more about all the latest remodelling efforts she had completed for the manor while Draco was away at Hogwarts.
Aria froze in the middle of reaching for a new set of plates and glanced at Blaise from the corner of her eyes.
eventually burst out laughing at Morag's quip, their sudden outburst drawing the attention of the younger Slytherins sitting nearby. Glancing to her right, Aria's amusement grew when she saw the uncharacteristically appalled look on Draco's face. The blond's eyes were wide and his mouth was slightly parted as he continued to gape at Morag in stunned, scandalized silence.
Wood stood up from his seat and walked back over to stand in front of the table, crossing his arms and leaning the back of his hip against the edge. "You've seen this over and over again in a lot of muggle stories, yes? Of course, muggles tend to romanticize it,
been housemates for quite some time now and most of us have barely spoken a word to each other in the halls." He drawled.
A few more hours of drinking later, after a giggly Hannah managed to get herself completely drunk and began trying to grope Blaise, Neville, Zach
Aria laughed and dismissed his reaction with a careless wave. "While you were gone, Blaise was all about how we should have this big graduation party for everyone; so we spent the last few days planning it out." She explained.
As soon as he stepped outside the castle, he shivered and cast a quick heating charm on himself before continuing up the long, winding staircase that led to one of the owlery towers. He noticed that the steps were still a little wet from the melted snow so he made sure to climb very slowly.
"Y—yes, I—uh. Sorry about that." Aria forced out a shaky laugh, wrapping her arms tightly around herself. "It was a little panic attack. Even after the war, I still get them every now and then." She lied.
"Nah, it's fine. Like I said, it's common knowledge by now." He told her, shaking his head before turning to give her a strange smile. "You know what's weird though? As her son, I really admire her for it – not conforming to what society expects of her, I mean. She chooses to live without a mate. Did you know that she cut off her own wings?"
truly negative symptoms of vampirism. The first one is the most popular. It is what we vampires refer to as the
was why I accepted your invitation." She answered honestly, giving him another smile. "So are we okay now?"
"Well," Blaise paused in the middle of cleaning and frowned in thought. "I wouldn't say they hated each other, but they certainly didn't like each other either. I don't even think I ever saw them together. Pansy was an insufferable brat, always clinging onto Draco's arm because he was the most flashy, arrogant kid in the room. Meanwhile Neville was the quiet, strange boy who didn't like to play with the other children. He mostly just clung onto his grandmother's leg all the time."
The stunned expression on Hannah's face disappeared instantly. She squealed and practically shoved Morag out of the way so she could peer closer at Aria across the table.
"Whatever decision you make, whether you eventually change your mind or not, it won't matter to me. It's entirely your choice, and I promise to respect what you want."
In her head, Aria had been under the misguided assumption that Corey Parkinson would look just like a mini, younger version of his older sister. But when she walked into the empty classroom where she would be meeting Corey that morning, Aria was surprised to see a small, brown-haired kid with bright blue eyes and a cute, boyish face grinning right back at her.
"That is, of course, assuming Aria hasn't chucked you for someone else by then—ow! Aria, that hurt!"
Another hour or so into their chores, Pansy broke Aria out of her thoughts when she spoke again in a loud, mocking voice.
"I suppose I have no choice then." Pansy grumbled as she reluctantly stood up and walked over to join them. "But if Potter gets us killed for making us chase after her in the Forbidden Forest like a bunch of Gryffindors, then I swear, I'm going to kill her."
"I never would have guessed you were one of those serious artist types." Hannah commented idly as she took a dainty sip of her drink.
"I didn't hex him because I thought you couldn't handle it, Pansy. I hexed the bloody git because I wanted to." Neville retorted, his voice rising several levels in obvious annoyance.
"How dramatic." Draco retorted sarcastically as he looked up from where he was lounging lazily in his favorite armchair in front of the fireplace. "Really now, do they honestly expect another dark lord from a bunch of stupid kids who up and decided to parade their idiotic house pride by painting the bloody doors of the Great Hall at night?" He sneered at the thought.
Aria tossed his cloak off her shoulders and walked over to him, towering over his seated form on the ground. When Draco froze and stared up at her in confusion, Aria yanked the glasses off her face again before settling herself on top of him, positioning both of her legs on either side of his waist so that she was straddling his lap.
"Your hair grew quite long, Aria. I remember it being only shoulder-length last year." Luna commented as she turned her big blue eyes to Aria's braid and reached out to push it gently over the other girl's shoulder. "Did you use magic or a potion to grow it this long over the summer?" She asked.
you prat. And no, we definitely wouldn't want that." She agreed, closing her eyes and biting her lip to stifle another shameless moan when his lips began sucking at a sensitive spot below her jaw.
cheat." Aria retorted hotly, her cheeks flushing with shame as she glared indignantly at him. "There's absolutely
"Fine then." Morag whistled as she reached out and yanked the black book out of his hands. "I'll just go back to the Restricted Section and put this book back where I found it—"
He also knew that she had absolutely nothing to do with Draco's problems, but he couldn't seem to help it. It was just so much easier to blame everything on her. The frustration he had been bottling up for the past few weeks had finally reached its tipping point so it was all just spilling out; and all he could do in that moment was redirect it at the nearest person who could probably handle his wrath.
As Pansy rushed past her into the room, Aria’s eyes widened and an obnoxious grin began to curl her lips.
Aria immediately jerked herself out of her little trance and gaped at him, inadvertently allowing Blaise to catch a quick glimpse of her true face and the way her eyes were glowing an unnaturally bright green shade. The moment was gone in an instant, however, as Aria's expression immediately shuttered and she sealed her true appearance back up, wings quickly retracting themselves back into her body.
last night, and we weren't even at Hogwarts so he couldn't have been here." She blurted out, pointedly choosing to ignore the fact that Blaise smothered a smirk behind her at her words. "I know this for a fact, Corey, so it couldn't possibly be him you were talking to. It must have been someone else, possibly under the guise of a polyjuice potion."
"Morag mentioned that there was also a spell to force a veela in hiding to reveal her true form? Is this also in ancient veelish? Does it work the same way as the Feather Curse?" She asked.
Aria never actually thought she'd see the day where Pansy Parkinson, of all people, would be coming to her rescue but here she was, swooping in out of nowhere.
The entire classroom fell silent and watched with bated breath as Fleur reached up and slowly unwound her hair from its tight coil on the back of her head, causing the light blonde tresses to come tumbling down past her shoulders, down her back, all the way to the floor. It wasn't hard to notice how an invisible, magical haze seemed to blanket the entire room after that, causing the eyes of every single male within a ten-foot radius to dilate and then cloud over like an utterly entranced, lovesick zombie.
Luckily, he remembered that he managed to copy her name down when they had both been stuck inside that cave in the Forbidden Forest a few weeks ago. All he needed to do now was to properly translate the symbols and learn how to speak her name properly.
men who inherit some of their veela mother's features but they themselves will not become veela. This is because the veela gene only manifests in women. If you are a woman and have veela blood in your ancestry, you have a 1/32 chance of becoming a veela as well. No matter how far down the family tree you are from your veela ancestor." Fleur answered.
Pansy managed another snort at that and shook her head. "I wouldn't bother with him, Potter. Not only do I not want my father finding out about him, but I also don't want to give Michael the satisfaction of thinking he's actually still relevant to me." She told her.
Malfoy." Blaise answered him coolly, and for the first time since Aria arrived, she saw a glimmer of irritation flashing in the prefect's eyes. "Unlike you and Pansy, I don't intend to spend an entire year
By now, Aria was beginning to feel the unmistakable effect of all the blood loss and she felt incredibly lightheaded. She forced herself to blink her eyes open and stared blearily up at the wide, fanatical smile on Bentley's face.
team's Seeker could find the snitch first. By then, Aria realized that the only way she'd be able to catch the snitch with Ginny hot on her tail was to feign a very sharp, dangerously vertical dive towards the ground.
"I didn't think of that." Hermione blinked and seemed to consider the idea. "But are you sure you're okay with letting us stay there? I mean, it's
He managed to school his expression back into a nonchalant mask when Aria finally tossed her long hair back away from her face, most of the dark locks already dry, and glanced at him, offering him a shy smile.
Draco gritted his teeth at the patronizing tone of Blaise's voice but he forced himself to stay still, watching with narrowed eyes as Bentley and Jenson's forms began to fade in the distance.
The frown on his face began to fade slowly, until a small, mischievous smirk began to form in its place.
As they began levitating the banner up to drape over the windows, Blaise suddenly walked over to them. He grinned widely and slung a heavy arm around Draco's shoulder.
"Then what is it? Is it Potter?" Pansy's frown only seemed to deepen at his answer. "How is she, by the way? From where I was watching, that fall looked pretty bad."
"Seriously?" Pansy turned and directed her affronted glare at Draco instead. "Weren't you the one who said we should avoid associating with Potter this year?!" She pointed out.
"It's okay." He told her, caressing her flushed cheek with his thumb. "If you're not ready to talk about all of this right now, then we don't have to."
now as she began rifling through her bag for her wand. "Aren't you going to do something, Hannah?! That good-for-nothing wanker cannot treat you this way! In fact, I'm going to go over there and hex his balls off myself—"
"Potter would sooner jump into the lake than do something like that, Pansy. You're fine. Now let go of me!" Draco scoffed as he yanked his sleeve away from her in irritation.
Bulstrode?" Aria looked dubious, pointing discreetly to where Millicent was standing with Malfoy, Parkinson and Goyle across the room. "That mean gigantic girl who used to make fun of us all the time?"
"Though, if I were you, you should probably make sure no one from your precious fan club finds out about the whole veela thing - especially that bit about your wings. And not that I care or anything, but I'd also be
Flushing with embarrassment, Aria had jumped out of bed and rushed to the shower immediately, emerging messily from it about fifteen minutes later and wrestling herself into her uniform. As she stumbled down the stairs to the Slytherin common room, she was relieved to realize that
"Hmph." Pansy just scowled at him and sniffed, crossing her arms and purposely turning her head away from the growing crowd of girls by the entrance. "If you like tall, pretty Gryffindor boys, I suppose."
By now, Morag was clenching her quill so hard that even from where he was standing, Draco could see the way her fist was trembling.
As he studied her face, Draco couldn't help noticing how the pupils in her eyes seemed much larger than what was normal. It should have looked creepy, but when combined with her long lashes and glowing skin, it just made her look like a life-sized, porcelain doll.
Fleur seemed to consider something for a few seconds before she nodded and straightened in her seat.
Aria broke her gaze away from his and leaned back against the stack of pillows behind her. She shrugged and turned her attention back to the untouched plate of food on her lap.
Draco looked up from the new house list that was handed to them by McGonagall and cast a questioning look at Pansy beside him.
"You're welcome." Blaise answered cheerfully before gesturing to a nearby attendant to bring them another glass of wine. "I picked it up this morning. The jeweler had just finished setting the stone in. It took a bit longer than usual, but then again, your specifications were pretty intricate."
upcoming school year, which meant that even the incoming 8th year students – the former 7th year students who hadn't been able to finish their studies last year – were included in the resorting.
There was a loud sniff on the other side of the door, followed by the sound of Hannah hiccuping and blowing her nose.
"See?" Draco actually looked more amused than angry now as he watched her take another cautious step away from him, her hand automatically hovering over her wand. "You're doing it again, Potter." He said calmly.
"Wait a minute." Draco's eyes widened and, in his panic, he nearly dropped the butterbeer bottle he was holding to the floor. "Potter, you
"Alright then, Aria. If that's the way you want to play, then I suppose we can do this your way for now." He jeered.
As soon as he was gone, she whimpered under her breath and closed her eyes. Fighting the urge to scream, she turned around and began bashing her head repeatedly against the outside wall of the changing rooms.
was the one who allowed his fixation with me to become something so violent and destructive. I'm sure plenty of other vampires have had similar fixations on other people before, but we've heard no such violent attacks from them, have we?" She pointed out.
"If she's the 'darling' of the Ministry, then maybe you can use that to your advantage. You know, get her to pull a few strings to get that dream job of yours."
His hand crawled up to fondle her breasts again, simply because he just couldn't stand looking at them without touching them, and he used his other hand to press two fingers inside her, working them alongside his tongue in bringing her closer and closer to the edge. When he curled his fingers upwards and he gave her clit one last, swirling lick, Aria's eyes finally rolled to the back to her head and she screamed, losing control of her magic as her wings suddenly flared out of her back and her entire form shimmered with a bright, golden light before she finally reverted back to her true form.
"My fixation?" Wood just blinked at her and arched an eyebrow, clearly not impressed. "I'm not nearly as complicated as other vampires out there."
After Aria introduced herself; finished detailing the events that happened during the Hogwarts Yule Ball;
fast. I...We should…slow down." Draco winced and took another careful step back, his eyes still wide as he stared at her, as though he was trying to ascertain if she was alright.
The rest of her protests dissolved into a startled giggle when Draco suddenly hoisted her up into his arms, smirking as he hauled her towards the bedroom.
fan, Aria." The boy declared loudly as he squeezed her hand again and leaned in closer, forcing Aria to frown and back away at the intrusion. "My name is Bentley Fisher. I'm a Gryffindor too and I'm a year below you. Though I
"You have no idea, Potter." Blaise retorted, glancing at her and giving her a wry smirk. "After her high profile divorce from one of the Burke sons two years ago, most of the traditional old ladies in wizarding society had taken to calling her…less than flattering names."
The strange, knowing tone of his voice caused Draco to stiffen and Pansy to blink, alternating her gaze back and forth between the two boys in question.
Ignoring the way Blaise, Zach, Draco and Neville's eyes had all widened comically at her voice, Hannah reached down, opening her robes and unbuttoning the top two buttons of her blouse to expose a fair amount of cleavage. Afterwards, she smirked and reached up, yanking off her pigtails and shaking her blonde hair out, letting the tousled locks tumble messily past her shoulders. When she noticed her male housemates gaping stupidly at her, Hannah rolled her eyes and turned to Blaise.
Draco knew that the awkward tension lingering in the air was entirely his fault, but he couldn't bring himself to care.
Still chuckling, she followed Blaise through the many twists and turns of the school's corridors until they reached the outside of the castle.
He ignored Blaise's warning look and went on, gray eyes hard as they settled on Aria's calm, blank expression across the table.
swarming me all the time were bothering me and that she could give me a charm necklace to help ward them off. She also said something about how being around
"Please don't bring that up again." She warned but either Blaise didn't hear her or he chose to completely ignore what she said.
"Whoops. My bad." Aria retorted sarcastically, smirking at her before raising her wand again. "Oh don't get your knickers in a twist, Parkinson, it's not like the spell was going to kill you." She aimed another immobulus at the pixie, cursing when it cackled and flew out of the way.
been in love with her – ever since I was thirteen years old. She's always been this secret, childhood dream of mine, and I was just so afraid of admitting to myself how much I wanted her until it was too late." He added ruefully.
"Of course I didn't tell him." Aria snapped, reaching up to pinch the bridge of her nose. "The bloody git has veela genes from his mother, he figured it out pretty easily on his own."
when a veela chooses a mate, one would presume that she trusts him completely. Which, of course, brings me to our next topic. The mating process."
1. Everything mentioned about Veela in this chapter was completely made up by me for purposes of this story and this story alone so please don't bother pointing out any plot holes or inconsistencies with what veela are in canon.
When Luna noticed this and glanced up at him in question, Draco blurted out the first few words that came to mind.
She appreciated the opportunity she was given to spend more time to herself, and as much as she loved her two best friends (and she did really), she also appreciated the fact that she didn't have to witness their constant, nauseating displays of affection all the time.
Her bedroom wasn't as lavishly decorated as the rest of the flat, but Draco decided that this room was probably his favorite so far.
Ginny Weasley, sending him and both female seekers crashing so violently into the commentator's stand that they ended up knocking out Justin Finch-Fletchley, the announcer for the match.
The way Pansy's voice shook caused the anger on Neville's face to dissipate immediately as he realized the harshness of what he just said. He cringed and made a move to stand up from his seat.
As she stood up from her seat and began reaching for her coat, Draco frowned and shot up after her in protest.
After some thought, Draco decided to make use of his afternoon to go to the Ministry instead. Not only did he need to pass by a few shops on his way there, but more importantly, he still needed to submit his application to the Wizengamot for his upcoming apprenticeship course after graduation. Luckily, the elderly secretary who worked at the Wizengamot office at the Ministry was more than accommodating, and it didn't take Draco long to finish submitting all of his requirements.
began choking on their food. Morag, on the other hand, actually looked interested in Blaise's question while Zach – well frankly, Zach still looked as though he was about to throw up.
"Oh...Okay, then." Draco swallowed and allowed his shoulders to sag with relief. "I'm sorry; I don't mean to be so anxious about all this. It's just...I really want to surprise her and I want everything to be
I'm so sorry this update took much longer than usual. I blame work though, because I've been so busy lately that I've only had 2 hours of writing time per day, at most. I actually had to rewrite this chapter so many times before I was satisfied, and I think the amount of words I deleted could form a whole new chapter already lol. I'm still not exactly happy with how it turned out but I decided to post it anyway so we can finally progress with the rest of the story.
"Headmistress McGonagall had him locked up in her office. I heard a group of Aurors came and took him away this morning." She told them.
In his shock, it actually took Draco a couple of seconds before he realized what happened but when he finally noticed the way Fisher was still staring very eerily into his eyes, he stiffened in disgust and immediately wrestled himself free.
She let out another heavy sigh as he led her through the entrance to Hogsmeade Station. When they finally stopped just in front of the platform of the train going to London, she slowly lifted her chin to meet his gaze and gave him a small, apologetic smile.
She bent down and licked his mouth, adjusting the movements of her hips so that there was direct friction on her clit while she rode him at the same time. Draco cupped her bouncing breasts with his hands and squeezed roughly before he leaned up, nuzzling his face into them and sucking hard on her nipples.
The unexpected softness in Potter's voice drew Draco's attention back to her, and he was taken back when he saw the expression on her face. For all her legendary Gryffindor bravado and annoying snark at the beginning of their conversation, Potter now looked as though someone had punched her in the gut.
To everyone's surprise, Fleur's blue eyes suddenly hardened at Corner's question and the expression on her face shuttered, her features creasing into an angry, hostile scowl
"Aria is also Dorea's granddaughter and the legally appointed heiress of the Black family through Sirius, so we thought it would be more fitting for her to have it." Andromeda added, smiling at the stunned look on Draco's face.
"You're disgusting!" She raised a hand to slap him again but this time, he caught it and used it to pull her back against him.
Draco met her smile with a wry smirk. "I haven't really given it much thought yet; but I suppose...Civil Magical Relations."
"So it's 'Draco' now, huh?" He made a disgusted face again and pretended to make a gagging motion with his finger. "Merlin, you really
be appreciated in this day and age." She let out a dramatic sigh and gave Draco a playful, teasing smile to lighten the mood. "If, perhaps, you find yourself working as a member of the Wizengamot sometime after you graduate, Monsieur Malfoy, maybe you could remember this conversation of ours and be the one to put those laws in place, oui?" She winked at him in challenge.
Draco thought about how Aria had been coming home late to their flat for the last couple of days, and the only times Draco got to interact with her was in the mornings. He had never been more thankful for their joint decision to sell his flat a few months after graduation, followed shortly by him moving into Aria's flat in Westminster instead. Given how busy they both were in the last two years (with Aria's Auror Training Program and Draco taking evening classes at the Wizengamot in between his community service shifts), he wasn't sure how he could have handled
Worst of all, the two Slytherins would often end up griping and snapping at each other over the stupidest things (like how Neville was wrong because his shirt wasn't pressed properly or Pansy was stupid because her perfume was too strong) until Morag finally decided that she had enough and cast a complicated silencing charm on them
"You can't really blame her. Since the Dark Lord's gone, I think this is the first time she realized that she actually has to take her classes seriously." Neville remarked with a knowing chuckle, pointedly ignoring the glare Aria sent his way as they climbed up the stairs leading to the ground floor and followed the growing crowd of students making their way to the entrance doors of the Great Hall.
"This is all actually very simple, Potter." Draco told her bluntly, cutting off the rest of her protests with a derisive sneer before he turned around and gestured for the rest of their team to assemble around them. "As Captain, I fully intend to win the championship for Slytherin this year – or at the very least, beat the stuffing out of Gryffindor. And to do that, I need to assemble the best team possible. That means, I need to play as
?" He complained loudly, making a disgusted face. "There are other things I'd much rather be doing—"
At Morag's words, the anger on Aria's face slowly melted away, and she gave Morag an amused look instead.
Morag rolled her eyes when most of the Slytherins didn't bother hiding their snickers at Aria's deadpan reaction.
Draco watched as Hannah nodded and hesitantly took Theo's offered hand. The two walked off, leaving Draco staring after their retreating backs with a bemused expression on his face.
Apparently, in an effort to repair all the mistrust and house division caused by the recent war against Lord Voldemort, Headmistress McGonagall and the rest of the Hogwarts faculty had met up with the school's organizational board and proposed a mandatory
"By the way, while we're on the subject of stereotypes, Miss Skeeter, may I also point out that the stories you published about me in your column were very misleading — bordering on libelous, actually. If that doesn't stop soon, I may have to press charges against you too." Aria said cheerfully.
of you. I'll see you all later, alright?" She slung the strap of her bag over her shoulder and walked off without another word, heading quickly towards the exit of the library.
He immediately grimaced, however, and his eyes narrowed into tiny slits as he glared accusingly at Pansy.
though. From fourth to fifth year." Blaise told them cheerfully, smirking as he took a sip from his goblet. "Pansy used to have this
Smirking, Draco waited until she exited the room before he leaned back languidly against the counter and finished the rest of his tea.
He gave her a nonplussed look. "And I'm supposed to believe you're just handing this out to me for free, now?" He drawled sarcastically.
"Is this why you were so offended the other day at what Morag said about group sex? Because you're actually a possessive git even in bed?" Blaise quipped again, turning to Draco and giving the seething blond a knowing grin.
"It is quite simple." Fleur answered her with a smile and wink. "An unmated veela is able to sense who her 'compatible mates' are through
"So…Did I happen to miss anything interesting this week? You know, while I was bored out of my mind in the hospital wing?"
"In my defense," Draco couldn't help the small smirk that forced its way onto his face when he saw her disbelieving look at him. "I didn't expect to be seeing you around – much less being
For a few seconds, Corey could do nothing else but blink up at her with such a nervous expression on his face that Pansy made a move to intervene; only for Blaise to grab her firmly by her elbow to keep her in place. When Corey didn't look as though he was inclined to answer, Aria sighed and reluctantly released her grip on his shoulders. Just as she turned away, however, Corey suddenly grabbed at her sleeve and lowered his gaze to stare intently at his shoes.
She immediately stiffened at his nearness and took a cautious step back, folding her wings protectively behind her. He stilled at her reaction, meeting her anxious gaze with a calm, reassuring look.
"You can't be serious about this, Professor!" Ron Weasley's loud, cracking voice reverberated loudly in the hall, drawing the attention of most of the 8th year students beginning to enter Hogwarts castle.
"I'll be alright." Zach managed an embarrassed laugh and looked away to hide his blush. "Besides, like I said, just because I'm rubbish at quidditch, I still have a pretty damn good eye for it. So a friend of mine says he might be able to get me a job as a professional quidditch announcer after we graduate."
"You were pretty good up there." She broke him out of his thoughts, her smile becoming a little playful when she saw the way his cheeks flushed pink at the compliment.
He turned around very slowly, staring at Aria with a strange, expression on his face that almost made her want to run away; but she didn't falter. Her heart was pounding rapidly in her chest, and she felt so unbelievably raw and exposed and vulnerable as she stood there, but still, she stayed exactly where she was.
"Potter, have you gone mad? Are you actually agreeing with me?" She asked incredulously, narrowing her eyes at her in disbelief.
The owlery was empty when he finally got to the top of the tower, probably because all of the students were mostly in the Great Hall eating their lunch. Draco was grateful for the privacy as it allowed him to take his time to re-read the letter he had written for his mother the night before.
