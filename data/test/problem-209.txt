"Keep going," he said. Harry cast around in his memory—he was hard now and wanted much less talking, much more Draco in his mouth, on him, in him, around him.
Harry crossed the room in a few quick steps and knelt down, wrapping his arms around Draco's spindly shoulders as best he could. The angle was awkward, and Draco's face was hidden from him, so all he could do was speak to his scalp and plant an equally awkward kiss to the soft growth of white-blond hair coming in to replace what was left of his peach tipped locks.
Malfoy pressed his forehead into the wall, a palm to it. The pain was still with him, and though it had made him soft, it could harden him, too.
"Care to illuminate me as to why?" His drawl was textbook snarky Malfoy, straight out of the fantasies Harry had been indulging in lately.
The Galleon in his pocket burned as if it had recently soaked in a pot of boiling water. When he looked up, Draco was looking squarely at him, his face a blank slate. He looked away immediately as Harry gulped.
Harry wanted to break things—his finger bones would be a good start—but took a step back instead. He grit his teeth and forced in a breath—in through his mouth, out through his nose. He had to be very, very careful not to lose control.
He had to be careful not to snap. His silence in the face of Pansy's smell had been bought by two articles—both negative—that had been published in the last week.
"Christ," Harry whispered, swiping his thumb across the slit to wipe up the stream that had collected there. Draco watched, mesmerized as Harry quickly licked the digit, his right hand still pumping. They were so bloody close that Harry could make out the pinpricks of sweat gathering on Draco's nose, his cheekbones shining as perspiration built on his skin.
Draco pouted the rest of their visit, which Harry thought adorable. He couldn’t manage to maintain a pout when Harry put his mouth to work, but you can’t have everything.
When he opens them, the light in the further corner of the kitchen is out. His cock jumps as a flare of anger pulses through him to see the bulb darkened grey.
at his glasses. He sat in nervous silence at the kitchen table, a cup of tea brought to him sitting untouched. Kreacher eyed him warily before he finally left the house, bound for Hogwarts. He was going to be late to get to Ron and Hermione's at this rate, but that was such a distant problem it hardly registered, joining the circuit of frenzied, buzzing thoughts in his brain.
Once dressed and seated back in his sitting room, the sunset shades of a roaring fire reflected in the dark pools of his eyes, he responded.
Hunger roused Harry from dreams of harried Ministry employees in high-heels tap-dancing to Celestina Warbeck standards. He was about to join a chorus singing before the Wizengamot and was saved the trouble when his stomach, shrunken to the size of a prune, woke him with an epic growl.
"You really thought you could get away with eye-fucking me like that all night?" Draco growled the words directly into Harry's ear, and Harry could hardly breathe; he was so turned on, and at the same time terrified that somehow Draco would pull away and laugh, that the whole scenario would be revealed as an elaborate joke.
Harry looked around the canteens drab walls and pulled the laptop closer, crossing his arms around it and resting his cheek against it's closed face. The metal was cool; he closed his eyes.
"I am sorry, Harry. You didn't deserve to think that I was staying away because of him. That wasn't my intention."
—it turned a simple moment of jerking off into something that sent shivers to the base of his spine.
"Regularly?" Harry hated how hopeful he sounded, like a child who’d been told they could have ice-cream every day. A fair brow rose on Draco’s face.
"Here?" Oliver asked him, gesturing to his mattress on the floor, and Harry had said "Sure," and let himself be kissed until he realized that Oliver wanted him to do the kissing, to take the lead, so he did. Oliver pulled the string on the single lamp in the room to turn it off, and with only the scraggly light from the nearly-full moon coming in through the window, he was passable. Close enough, even though his hair was dyed, more yellow than white, and he was softer, thin but without all the muscles Harry had become accustomed to.
Harry's jaw unstuck, his tongue peeling from the roof of his mouth. Making words felt like heavy work.
"I must be off. Dustin," she quipped as she walked away, a small ginger-haired child immediately slowly his jog down to a crawl, "what have I said about running in the halls?"
brought up. There was a pair of seasons tickets to the ballet already purchased, sitting idly at the bottom of his sock drawer, ready for the occasion. Pansy was working with him on a dinner reservation at the Shard—it would be exorbitant to book the amount of private space they'd need, but Harry didn't care. It was a new year, and he wanted to make the most of any and all excuses to bring their loved ones together and celebrate.
The runner's high was wearing off. Soon he'd crash, and that was the point. He'd wanted to be alone for a few sweet minutes before heading home to the heat of a shower and then a long, uninterrupted sleep.
"I'll take that into consideration," Fatima said. "You know that when he comes through, he brings bribes."
"Shut it," he muttered, clearing his plate into the bin and washing up before Kreacher could catch him with the sponge in his hand. "It's never any good trying to date Muggles," he tried to explain to the walls. They didn't offer a response.
"Yes, please," Harry said the words and Draco smiled, slow and languid, and when he stood and peeled his jumper off, Harry recalled the promise of what the night was meant to hold for both of them, the promise that had started with a fumbled kiss and a declaration earlier in the night. And he thought of the note at the bottom of the pile, the one intended to be read last. The pit at his core, what was left after his flesh was torn away. The thing he wanted more than anything.
"Don't overthink it," Draco spoke quietly like Harry would startle otherwise. "Just strip for me, pet, and it'll be perfect. There's no one else watching, and I want it so much."
The words were susurrated, more breath than speech. In the right mood, Harry would pretend that his patient was incoherent and ignore him.
"But there are no magical dwellings in Chelsea," he said, tone questioning. The more he looked around, the more these seemingly incongruent pieces of the puzzle were making sense. He couldn't feel magic wafting from everything he touched the way one could in magical buildings, and the characteristic buzzing feeling of being in wizarding-space wasn't there. Just cream-coloured walls and gleaming parquet flooring, simple furniture with some houseplants and framed charcoal drawings for decoration. It was suspiciously...normal.
"Oh, let's see," Draco spoke acidly, "changing the rules. Would it be so that you could treat me like I don't exist in public and retain exclusive access to my cock? Is that it?"
With a brisk nod, he turned and walked from the café, disappearing into the crowds of a new day breaking in London.
The statement knocked Harry's breath from his lungs like a punch to the gut. The notes, oh, those fucking notes. Words were never just words, were they? They were terrible in their power. His fantasies, wants, dark desires, childish dreams—what had he thought when he'd parcelled them up and sent them to Draco?
"That you need to stop hanging on every word I say," he said, and it wasn't a whole truth, Harry knew it, but he didn't push. Not then, not yet. There were truths, and there were half-truths, and there were things that could be left unsaid until the time was right.
"I'll never get used to this, as long as I live," Draco said, settling back on his haunches for a second's breath.
"Yes, thank you, Edward, we'll be cautious of the slugs," she said, turning to share a bemused look with Harry.
"How about three?" Harry asked. Draco carded his hair and held his face back a few inches so he could look into his eyes.
"I'd love for you to be my toy tonight. Would you like that, pet?" Draco removed his thumb from Harry's mouth, and Harry nodded, his voice throaty and deep when he answered with the entirety of the vocabulary he'd need for as long as their play lasted,
"Y-yes," Harry stuttered, and the breaths were tingling at his skin again, and he was trying not to let reflexes get the better of him when Draco pulled his cheeks apart again, but he bucked him off anyways. An apology was ready on his tongue and an excuse—that it was a bit difficult for him to relax when his arsehole was on display, and he only needed another minute—but all those pretty words were forgotten when Draco spanked his arsecheek hard enough to bruise.
Harry toed into his favourite pair of trainers and vanished the towel to the laundry, pulling his sweatshirt's hood over his mop of still-damp hair. It was nearly time for a haircut, his fringe flopping over his specs' rim, but that could wait another day or two. A visit to Diagon Alley on his birthday had become something of a ritual. There was never enough whisky in the house to get through it otherwise.
“What do we say?” Harry asks, watching where the ruddy edges of his cock disappear into the pink of his body.
Malfoy’s head rolled on his pillow. He stared glassy-eyed out into the gloom of a storm and was quiet for so long that his next whispered words came as a surprise to Harry.
move on from this flat," Ron shook his head, tasting the sauce and making a surprisingly pleased sound.
"Don't hold your breath, pet," he kissed at the corner of Harry's mouth and that got him to take a gulp of air and keep breathing as he pushed against the fantastic intrusion thickly filling him.
Harry was aware of Jessica's gaze on him from down the hall. He pinched the bridge of his nose, taking a breath in time with Draco's. This was a code all its own.
"Circle your fingers around your hole," he said. Cissy nodded, a rush of air slipping through her puffy lips. Her lipstick was gone and still, she looked perfect, absolutely perfect to Harry.
. Kreacher is not swine, does not listen to such talk, unbefitting the Master of the great house of Black." He stopped to cough, spitting on the ground and snapping his fingers to vanish the phlegm away. "Kreacher may
Entering through the guest bedroom, Harry was surprised that Draco wasn't immediately visible. He'd gone home from the pitch to dispel some nerves—time enough for a quick slash, shower and change, grabbing a bottle of wine and Draco's sunglasses—but hadn't spared a thought to plan. Even after his poor showing earlier, he still couldn't think past
Harry was resting his eyes when a monstrously hard flick of Kreacher's claw-like nails stung the centre of his forehead, momentarily stunning him. He rarely dared to touch Harry, commonly opting to use his words to get his disappointment across.
"Honestly, you've got a personal stylist, a vault full to bursting, and you're still in boot-cut denim. Potter, are you sure you're even gay?"
"Please don't go," Harry blurted. He hated how much it sounded like a plea, but his heart was beating double-time, and he was afraid. "I think someone's poisoned me and I can't, I can't be seen like this."
There were more pamphlets, and follow-up appointments to be scheduled, and the look of relief on Ron's face, and Draco rallying a hearty smile for him and dropping it as soon as he turned to leave. Harry swallowed emotions whole as he fell into his old style of self-defence. He was sweet as could be and used his wide green eyes to win the affections of staff as they prepared their leave, securing use of an administrator's Floo to avoid the commotion of the front doors.
, at least to anyone else—someone totally new. The sparkle of the pearl earring studs and sway of the hair enough to make one miss the Adam's apple, and the width of the shoulders, no matter how delicate they were.
It was a rare thing to surprise Hermione into silence, and the sound of it brought Harry an even more occasional feeling of absolute joy.
"It's fine, Hermione," Harry said, retaking his seat. His hands shook too hard to hold a glass steady; he gripped the edge of the sofa to quell them. "Go after him. We can talk later—tomorrow, it's fine."
"Perfect. Within that range,” Draco spat. Harry shut his mouth. “Have I fulfilled the terms of your question?"
It’s fitting, Malfoy sat next to the birdbath. Harry’s little bird, kept in all sorts of gilt cages.
He bit his lips. His face was still flushed, spots of pink high on his cheeks and tiny pinpricks of sweat on the bridge of his nose. He was so goddamn beautiful, and Harry knew as he was thinking these thoughts that he was so, so
The promise of sitting down was so tantalizing that Harry felt above reproach that he hadn’t clocked the patient’s name before he entered the room. His arse hit the chair and he was careful not to sigh or give away how incredible the relief of pressure on the soles of his feet was, and that’s when he noticed the patient. Unfortunately, Healer Abbott was already firing off the report, and followed up with the inevitable swanning, and Harry had no choice but to wait to say his part.
Draco brushed him off with an eye-roll and lit another cigarette, his composure coming back to him. Harry felt sure about this, felt like they were at a juncture where he could make him see sense.
"The nerve of some people," Harry huffed, turning back to his letter. He signed it and leaned back in his chair, dreaming up the perfect sandwich for lunch when the buzzing started up again.
Draco explained the ruse, his hands dancing in the air to punctuate the exciting parts, pointer finger rolling in a wave to elucidate where time passed, the "so on, and so forth." His voice asked only for Harry's attention, and Harry was happy to oblige. He widened his eyes with surprise when Draco shared that Pansy had recently started up with Luna, and that she was the witch in Pansy's clutches at the club the night before. He hummed in ascent when Draco surmised that Pansy had provoked him into coming to the club in the first place and guessed that they'd crossed paths at her work.
"Not so long," she answered. He took a deep breath and resumed staring into the mirror hanging on the wall opposite. The jagged scar on his forehead stood out more than it usually did, dark against the pallor of his paling skin. The radiance of summer was gone, and with it, most of his tan. The effect was startling, his eyes glimmering green as fresh shoots of grass.
"I'm so sorry, mate. I don't want you to feel—I'm sorry," he said, pushing his thumbs into his palms over and over again.
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco breathed, pulling Harry back in for more kissing and Harry had the distant thought that Draco might want this—be frightened by this but still
"Don’t move," Harry spoke into the dip of her neck and shoulder. He had to let go of his own prick to hold her still, hand a wet anchor at her waist. Cissy flinched when their fingers touched, Harry's dipping just inside, turning one to three, and it was Harry's turn to chuckle.
Andromeda ruffled his hair. "That's very thoughtful of you, Edward. I'm sure that if he were to join us for dinner, he'd be thrilled to have the chance to sit next to you."
"Thanks for the drink, Greg. I've got a friend I'm supposed to meet by the Floos. I'll, er, see you on the dance floor."
Draco's eyes flared, the look going straight to Harry's cock. "Oh, how I want to make you pay for that," he said, low.
"You should get back up there and save him. It appeared as though Ron Weasley was setting up some sort of enchanted karaoke machine." Harry stifled a groan at the thought. It would be a prototype nicked from Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, and therefore there was a strong chance that the thing would explode, or steal someone's voice, or, or—something.
The answer was met with scoffs, and though he didn't move at all, Harry could sense tension stilling the body next to him. He sipped his beer, counted to three before turning to check Draco's face. His jaw tensed up as he swallowed, and the vein in his temple where the tips of his hair now brushed, throbbed. Internally, Draco was low-grade freaking out.
"What about, exactly?" Draco asked. He picked at something from the lip of his mug, and the sustained lack of eye contact became pointed. Perhaps he was too embarrassed to broach the subject?
"I'm hurt," Draco said, and he kind of sounded it, though the face he put on was overly theatrical. Covering real emotions with oversized versions was a tactic of his that Harry was coming to learn. He brushed his fingertips along his collarbones because he knew Harry liked them, especially; all his delicate parts. "You never once wanked over me—"
"I'm allowed to go out, Potter. Perhaps you forget that I wasn't sentenced to a life of eternal penitence."
"In flesh and blood," he snarled. "Now let me through you useless twat. I can't admonish anyone properly by Firecall."
made concrete a memory, turned it into the cannon of his life. The chunk of rot lodged inside of Harry had been shaken loose, and he could feel it turning to smoke, to nothing, as he spoke openly about all the things he loved about Draco, even while he danced around the word, that awful, cursed word he couldn't dare say aloud again. Because he did, love him, loved what he did, who he was, his character, his smile, his smell—all of it.
"Your friend Luna Lovegood." She arched a brow at him. "The Prophet will run it in the Sunday edition after the Quibbler publishes it officially."
Harry wet his lips, staring up into Draco’s eyes. He used only the tip of his tongue to lick up the stream of precome waiting for him, and Draco couldn’t stop making sounds now, a deep groan escaping him. Harry sucked on with relish, bobbing his head up and down, swallowing as much of his prick as he could.
You're an hour and his bedroom is cold, but he's too warm for clothes, apparently, hard in his pants on top of the covers.
He keens when you pet with the pad of your finger, yields beautifully to your tongue. His balls are tight to his body, and they're a wonder in your mouth. None of this is what he wants, though. He never asks for when he wants, just jerks you up and invites you, dirty thing, into his mouth for a first kiss that only serves to press your erection against the opening of his body.
"Anytime you like," he said. "Ciao," he added with a wink as he closed the door, trying on some other personality, something more worldly than he was, and Harry smiled, not enchanted but amused, unsure if he'd want Oliver again, or some other replacement, or if perhaps if what he wanted was substance, if he shouldn't start looking for that instead.
cute," she said as she made change, and Harry flushed so furiously that Draco cocked a brow when he returned.
"You've all gone mad." Ron shook his head, looking between Hermione and Harry both, clearly not finding what he needed. He was a high red, now, worked up worse than Harry may have ever seen him. It was the anger that took Harry the most by surprise.
"Nah," Harry, knocked their shoulders together, "it's fun to try new things. I'm glad you picked this place."
: That's a wrap, folks :) As always, thank you from the bottom of my heart for sticking around for this entire journey. I'm glad to mark this epic as complete, and embark on the next chapter (expect it late 2021).
Harry’s cock pulsed inside his trousers. He was hard as a rock and wondered absently if one could pass out from being so aroused.
He could still pinpoint the last time he almost cried, the day of the final trial—that of the Death Eater who killed Colin Creevey. He was sure the last time he really, honestly cried was when Sirius died, and he didn't like to think about that either. About how maybe that was when he became someone beyond repair.
, every other feeling in his body subservient to this one. It seemed impossible that he'd come this far since they’d first started up; could take Draco's whole fat prick into his body in short minutes.
What had been admitted—sniffing his scarf. Held back, the memories of forcing wads of the fabric into his mouth, the remembered feeling of the fibres sticking to his tongue, to have something to bite back the groans that gripped him as he came, hard, again and again, in places foreign and forbidden from that kind of action. In the loo of a beautiful timber lodge while everyone else mingled for
"You'd think so, but at this point, I don't see how we're going to be able to settle on anything before 2006."
Harry sighed and sipped his tea. If he finished it quickly enough he could escape on the pretence of fetching more, and change the subject when he got back.
Draco raised an eyebrow and toast to her. "Thank you, Hermione. I'll kindly remind all of you heathens that libraries are sacred spaces of learning and self-betterment, and the furniture is not suitable for orgies. Be logical for a moment, I implore more of you."
spells stripped him of pollutants and gloves and mask and all manner of equipment floated over, hovering in wait for his nods of acceptance, he watched through the window at the scene set for him.
He continued speaking to Harry without meeting his eyes, flicking open the snaps to his gloves. Today's were short and tan.
"There's almost nothing in this world that can't be fixed," he said, sliding back in under the sheets. Neither of them had bothered to brush their teeth, and Draco hadn't even washed his face, facts that belied how draining their respective days had been.
“Do you know how the menu works?” Malfoy takes the seat properly, correctly interpreting Harry’s continued silence.
"Oh—dandelion root, fennel seed," she said airily, counting off her fingertips. "A few things from Dad's garden that you probably shouldn't know about."
Draco's free hand pushed Harry's face back into the wood, holding him by his neck, not slipping as Harry knew he wanted to those few inches up and into his hair. When he took the pressure off, and Harry kept his face close to the surface, the little clouds of fog appearing and disappearing again, that was when Draco slapped Harry's left arse cheek and then held on, kneading it firmly.
"Oi!" Malfoy clapped his hands so close to Harry's nose that he could feel the air whistling between them.
"So? What's it matter now?" Harry said. He could tell now that the trembling he felt came from within him, rather than from the house. He couldn't do this without them, didn't want to have to choose. This was all wrong, so wrong so fast, and he just had to make Ron
"What's the point anymore," Harry said, raising his hands in question. "Hmm? What's the point of hating you, now? What good does it do? What does it solve?"
"I started to get messy. I didn’t even come out to them properly, just let the wrong pronoun slip out over dinner once, and then I got caught by Pimsy—my Father’s house-elf—sneaking someone in. A boy," he said. Harry couldn't quite read his expression, other than it contained a sadness that signalled another story altogether.
"So you’re the Boy Who Died, too," Draco said. He was staring again, but it didn't put Harry on edge anymore. It felt good to feel seen. To be known, down to the bodies in the basement. Down to the places where you crawled to hide.
"Catch," Draco said, tossing a square of soap into the air. Harry did, expertly, giving it a deep inhale. Sweet almond and intense orange oil.
"Yes, so, they have this secret. It was not that they don't get fat; it's that they go to the Muggle gymnasium, but they do it totally incognito. If you let it be known that you're working for your body in France, you may as well not have it at all."
"Did you like it?" He undid the buttons to the cuffs of his own shirt so that it could fall from where it was trapped at his wrists to the floor.
It wasn’t really an accident, either. It couldn’t be, when his collection of transfigured pins was so vast.
"It must be hard, having parents that want grandchildren," he tried. "The Weasley's seem to be in the same camp when it comes to me."
A half-smile pulled at Draco's lips. "And wouldn't you know it, I was offered the spot over in Mysteries. Why do you think that is, Harry?"
One particularly deep growl and then a whine, dark head hung low between his shoulders as he’s close to giving up and there is a jolt between spine and cock as Draco starts to come. He pulls and pulls, riding the high out, hot white stripes of wet on his belly and finishes with a gasp. Harry’s whining is interrupted only by his breaths in, and Draco wishes he weren’t wearing the blindfold because there’s every chance that he’s crying. He needs help sometimes at the end, with the thickest part.
, the latest reality show to take both the Muggle and magical world by storm. The closest thing to serious conversation was when it came time to debate whether they should get tickets to see the Libertines or the latest wizard-rock trio of note, White Mold, in concert, as the events were scheduled for the same night in August. Harry couldn’t remember ever feeling more relaxed as they enjoyed the dappled sun from under the deep green canopy of the beech tree that loomed along the back wall.
Draco perked up. "Would this be some clandestine, Ministry of Magic, Auror-business stuff you've gone and nicked?"
Harry managed a half-smile but remained dutifully mad about it. He wanted to sulk, not to have a laugh.
"It's fine. I can't be hurt more than I've already hurt myself. I've been Marked. I fought for evil. I've been tied up, and beaten, and pushed around and I've been made to—"
,"—until his breaths came steadily, a hand permanently rubbing a shoulder when it wasn't tipping the tumbler of water up a centimetre.
Harry was literally biting his tongue by the time he gave one last wave to the press. The red carpet came to an abrupt end, and a pair of thick purple velvet curtains pulled back, revealing a remarkably subdued ballroom. He was early, at least for the under-fifty set, and the party was just getting started.
"Let's get away from the point, quick," he tugged Draco to the pedestrian crossing and into the grassy space, only slowing his pace once they were surrounded by scraggly trees, bereft of leaves, blending in with the similarly dressed Muggles walking about.
The music played off his dance partner's MP3 thing through the stereo system was mesmerizing—fuzzy and looping, with great big beats pulsing at the rate of your heart. The music wasn't anything like the regimented opera and classical piano that Draco typically listened to when he practised at home. The way he moved wasn't anything like how he moved at home, either, and what he wore—a loose grey t-shirt with the
She exhaled, didn't bother with the rest of the lecture. "The impact his skull had, we're worried about the swelling that's to come, so we'll need to keep him under observation for a while. He hasn't responded as expected to the potions we've tried so far, so we're giving it some time." She took a deep breath and pulled a bottle from her breast pocket and rattled them at him.
"How much would this run us if Edward were to sign up?” Andromeda asked. “Classes in Camden can't come cheap, I gather."
The sharp jut of where Draco lay his chin on Harry's shoulder was a touch too much, so close to the part that Harry used to beg to be kissed, sucked, bitten, but all he got now were hot gusts of Draco's breath and the press of bone into muscle, and it was going to kill Harry, to be right here, so close, and denied that last inch of intimacy.
"You're strong-willed," Harry said. He was sliding off to sleep and knew it, and was glad, so glad to be doing so like this, in Draco's bed. "You're good at sticking up for yourself."
"Best you get it in now before you're thirty because let me tell you, your body won't bounce back the same after you're over that hill. Snog someone for me, won't you? Oh, or better yet, bring a bloke home with you. Not that you need the extra exposure, but what with the book launch plans and all, a little frenzy never hurts for sales."
Harry was glad to see the canteen empty, its six tables and twelve benches tidy, the cavernous space filled with the tinny sounds of pop music from the wireless floating in the back corner. He smiled, and his lip held fast. Draco loved this song—he'd lip-synced all the words to Harry outside a fish and chips spot once while they'd waited for their order.
"I could still do a better job of it than I am," he said, sobering up. "Unless you want to talk about our parents at length, which I'm fairly sure you don't."
good, though he was careful these days of letting his neuroses win the small victories of turning every good moment into one riddled with fear.
"It's fine," he murmured, "whatever it is, it's fine." He smoothed his palm over the place where the locket had once burned into Harry's chest. Draco had never asked him about how he'd got that scar, and that made Harry's eyes prickle now, to think how lucky he was to have Draco to take care of him. He smoothed his palm directly over the place where his heart was constricted in the cage of his ribs, unaware of the turmoil his touch caused.
A mix of slack-jawed and concerned faces looked back at Harry, Justin's included. Ron held himself low to the table, as though he could only comprehend what was happening by getting a good look at the situation from a lower angle.
Harry hoped that his scrawled "Sorry for asking" was apology enough for putting Tom in this position. He hastily added, "No bribes, ever, please. Thanks, H". It was as Gertie was leaving the last time that green flames appeared in the grate of his kitchen fire. Through them, a familiar, if only somewhat friendly face appeared.
"Dunno," he answered honestly. "I just can't do public life anymore. Can't bear smiling for another camera or the thought of dragging anyone else into it. It's not—I can't ask for someone to do that for me. I don't want that to be the price of admission to being with me."
"I'm serious," Harry said, "I don't know how the fuck I got here." He took a cooling breath, his temper rising along with the thudding between his temples. Malfoy's laugh quietened into little coughs, mercifully.
Narcissa had gone in the other direction and grown pinched, or maybe that was circumstance. Her son lay in a hospital bed behind her, though how the fuck had she known where he was? Her steps remained purposeful as she strode directly up to Harry, while Lucius' faltered upon seeing him sat there.
They stared back across the chasm for another few minutes until Draco disappeared from view, off to the front of the class to lead the kids in their stretching.
"As it so happens, the sea of eyes glued to your arse on our way in alerted me to that fact, thank you," he said.
," Harry breathed. Hermione mouthed, "He's not finished," and she was right. Draco's eyes shone as he continued dreamily.
"I'm sorry, pet," Draco's voice was gentle still, as soothing as his hands had been. "You'll have to be a bit more specific."
Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets against the cold, casting a wordless warming charm at his godson, who trod ferociously on the path before him.
Harry cracked a one-sided smile and shrugged. "What can I say," he said, a little too breathy for his liking.
"Not really. Try it with your dish and tell me it's not the right choice," he answered coolly. Harry speared a bite and chewed thoughtfully before taking a sip, watching Draco all the while. His face was stone as he ate and drank, saying nothing of either.
in no uncertain terms. "You may be you and all, but that doesn't make you the only thing worth the front cover."
"Is this about money? If it's about money, we can talk." Harry let the wheels turn in his head, figuring it was best to keep Justin talking, even though his gut screamed at him to leave. "Though it is my money, and I should be allowed to do what I will with it."
"What the fuck," Harry said. He stood and found himself quickly silenced by a single gloved finger held inches from his face.
Harry opened his eyes after what must have been far too long to have kept them closed, and the song had changed; he had no idea how long he'd been on the dance floor, but his body was slick with sweat, shirt clinging to his torso. His eyes met those behind a silver mask belonging to a white-blond—
"Aren't you curious Ron," Draco asked after a long, amiable silence, "whether it was Harry's early childhood trauma that turned him into an insatiable bumboy? Or if it was his later, teenage traumas?"
“Good boy,” he rubs the soft skin of Harry’s thigh as Harry shakes and shakes. He’s hard, but the toy attaches to the crate wall, so the best he can do is rock back and forth. He’s come like that before, but it isn’t easy.
"Good boy," Draco cooed, slipping the fingers out and then they were slicking the head of Harry's cock and his own. He busied himself with exploring Harry's throat, licking and kissing as his slippery fingers explored the width of their cocks held together, pumping in a leisurely rhythm.
"Kreacher, my good man," Draco started, smashing his lips together into a thin line as he concocted the softest way to deliver his message. "I had only just placed some carbonated beverages here, along this space, and they seem to have gone missing."
"I feel like about once a day you forget you're Harry Potter," Draco spoke to himself, and then at a greater volume that included Harry, "for fuck's sakes, you
but he was a slag for it, for the feel of it weighty in his hand. He wrapped the fingers of both hands around its girth and started with loose tugs, agonizingly slow. He hoped that the slide of silky skin against his palms never got old.
Cissy fumbled around, blindly reaching until her wand rolled towards them and knocked into the backs of her knuckles.
Andromeda piped up from where she leaned against the wall down the hall, wearing a smirk that Harry recognized as an inheritable Black family trait.
"Hey Andromeda," Harry gasped, covering for heartbreak with a grin that came easily whenever Teddy was around. "I thought I spotted a fuzzy tennis ball down here. I was wondering though—where's Teddy?"
Harry let himself be pulled into the chair, trying his hardest to make sure that he didn't look constipated or spazzy as he silently tried to heal the tender spot on his head non-verbally whilst the two women
Malfoy snorted as he pulled off his jacket. "Just because you rearrange your features a bit doesn't make you unrecognizable, Scarface." His eyes darted to Harry's hands, his arms, torso, back to his arms, lingering, then around to his face. If it wasn't Malfoy doing it, Harry would think he was being checked out.
"You look like you could use a drink," he said. Harry shut the door and took a seat, jaw set closed as a vice. He made a sound and hoped that his face was more a smile than a grimace as Justin summoned glasses and pulled a bottle of something amber from his desk.
Malfoy sat up briefly, knees under his chin as he peeled his black socks off, bunching them together in a ball. Harry turned away to
Harry couldn’t hide his surprise at this sudden dearth of information. "How’d you end up in Surrey?"
Harry could taste something, violets again, only soapier, this time—the taste of Draco's magic tinged by his mood as it twisted around him. His thoughts were overtaken by Draco's will pushing into his mind, his voice clear inside Harry's head as though he were still speaking aloud.
" He exhaled, the silence surrounding them interrupted only by the crackling of the fire. "Counting is for nerds, anyway. Now, it's my turn, isn't it?"
"She uh, well, Nimbus Corp, they're offering me an endorsement deal," Harry broke his newly made rule immediately, looking to Draco for a reaction. Getting none, he continued, "I don't think I'm going to take it."
Harry’s fingers itched to tug his bandages higher, but he couldn’t trust himself not to unwrap them and trace the edges of the newly knitted skin. In the years since Draco graduated from former schoolmate to constant patient, he’d constellated himself with scars. There was one forming on his face from the crash, a crash Harry had carefully avoided details of. A switchback and a cliff and a tree, and the fact that it wasn’t an accident or a suicide attempt but what Draco thought of as a
"Right?" Draco swallowed nervously, and the hand-wringing was back, and his eyes so wide that Harry feared he'd start crying again, stood there in the centre of his room, and so he stepped forwards and took him by the arms, nodding on and on as he could hear guests clamouring about downstairs, no doubt being harassed by Kreacher about the wet state of their boots and jackets and things, and he dimly heard his name being called. He wanted to speak but had no earthly clue which words he needed, and so Draco started babbling the way he did when he was nervous.
Harry's heart felt full to bursting, and then Draco ducked his head, and his eyelids blinked shut as he took the tip of Harry's prick into his mouth, and Harry could hardly think anymore. He steadied himself with one hand at Draco's shoulder and the other cupped his head, glad for the feel of the silky strands beneath his fingertips. He was fast becoming obsessed with touching Draco's hair. He wanted to soap and wash it for him, craved the moments when Draco collapsed on top of him, and the strands would briefly tickle his nose. The thought of tugging at it was beyond—Draco would never allow it—so Harry entertained himself with smoothing it under his hand and letting it cascade through his fingers whenever he had the chance.
"I don't want any favours from Robards," Harry quickly countered. His defences had already been up, but now the alarm bells in the back of his mind were ringing loudly.
"Please," Harry whispered, "please don't leave. I can explain." Harry leaned in for a kiss, nothing more than a press of his lips against Draco's full and soft. Draco's eyelids shut, and he exhaled, a faltering breath for Harry to breathe in. He felt perfect in Harry's hands, and for a second, Harry was sure that the kiss was all he needed to calm down, back away from the fire. "Don't do this."
"About you, and Draco." Before Harry could ask why she shushed him. "He's conflicted. You're a big part of why he has what he has, but things aren't um,
Harry held on behind one knee. Draco understood, rose up over him, and with the fluidity that came with practice, lined up and breached him.
Harry's breath was a tremor as he loosened his grip on the soap, and Draco was quick to take hold of it. Stepping away from Harry left him strung up, so hard that his cock ached, without a single point of contact.
"Noted," Justin said, "I'll ask around for where is good that time of year. South America is terribly overdone, but perhaps something a little less obvious, like New Zealand." Harry nodded, a light, fake smile in place, and it was definitely happening now. This was flirting. Harry recognized it because he'd failed so spectacularly at noticing with Draco before.
Harry hummed in answer, reaching across the table's short distance to brush Draco's fingers with his own.
The restaurant itself was ancient. Thick carpets muffled the conversations taking place; the wood trim of the walls and doors was dull with years of use and wax; the roses in the vases held a faint layer of dust upon their petals, burning forever fire-engine red and laden with beads of plastic dew. Even the fish in the tank behind the counter swum lazily. Everything felt perched in amber; the patrons themselves were mostly pensioners and people old enough to be their parents.
attention for what seemed like his basic survival. Harry tidied for hours on Thursday morning while Draco lay, unmoving, occasionally talking back to the characters on the telly. The afternoon came and went with a trip to nearby Kings Walk mall, where Draco gave his haughtiest and most apathetic stare to the poor teenage girl unfortunate enough to be working the stall selling mobiles.
Harry sat up, flexing his toes, one leg jiggling until Draco's hand appeared with the speed of lightning and gripped onto his thigh to still it.
talk of delayed proposals in this house. We're still in school, for Merlin's sake! Mione's going back in the spring, and I'll be in training for another year, at least. How we're supposed to plan a wedding
“In the limited time since you’ve woken up, you’re already on a great trajectory, Draco. Now it’s our job to keep you on it, and yours not to push too hard, too fast. Go easy for a bit, can you promise me that?” Draco pinched his lips together in a thin line and nodded. Healer Annan rose from his seat and clasped his free hand kindly. It was the first time Harry had seen someone else touch Draco’s scarred skin, and it took that touch to remind him that his arms were bare, and he twisted his left arm so that the Mark wouldn’t show.
scars connected the deep hollows of his collarbones to the dips near each hipbone, sharp as glass. How he wasn't skin and bones, not gaunt, but lithe, with hard muscle under all that creamy, soft skin. Draco was so incredibly white everywhere, except for where he wasn't—dusky cock, black Mark, waxy pink scars and eyes the colour of river stones. How he didn't try to hide his imperfections from Harry—once revealed, he didn't shrink from his scars at all.
"Alright." The tension that went out of Draco's shoulders belied how good that explanation made him feel, and they stayed like that, connected in this new way.
"No," Draco added, eyes swatting up and down his body. "Just the apron. I'll fix up your feet with a warming charm, but I can't abide you naked in socks," he said, noticing that Harry wasn't wearing shoes and had been out with him on the sodden roof for a quarter-hour without complaint, though it was December. "Why are you in socks, by the way?"
"Miss me?" He mumbled. Harry could sense Penelope' smile even though he couldn't see it. His own lips curled, threatening to crack them. He licked the bottom one experimentally. Hot. Swollen. It tasted of pennies, so it was split after all. Not too badly.
The pinched look of concentration melted away from Hermione's face as she looked up and recognized him.
Something cold touched his face, Draco's fingers pulling off his glasses and hooking them into the neckline of his shirt. Harry gave himself a few experimental tugs and reached back up for Draco's cock, pursing his lips and coming up on his knees to just the right height to suck at the tip. Draco's question, sudden and earnest, took him by surprise.
"Wouldn't do to have you wasting away now, Harry," she said. Harry was glad to talk to her, glad that she always started the conversations he wasn't sure how to. "Now we're back, Sunday dinner's won't be half as painful. I'll play up my childlessness angle, you know—play with Victoire's hair, ask Teddy if he wished he had some more friends his age to play with."
"I couldn't believe you couldn't find someone to represent you," Harry grit out. "Anyone. It wasn't right."
"If you can't talk about them, you can't let them go. You're brilliant at talking, Draco," he nudged his shoulder back. "Tell me you'll give it a chance."
The Gryffindor table returned to their previous conversations because no matter the fact that it was Malfoy suffering the need to scratch, it wasn’t worth more than a batted eye. A little Calamity Potion and he’d be fine. Old news.
Draco hardly seemed to care how he was dressed, though his eyes did roam over Harry's chest and arms when he thought Harry wasn't looking. He was always perfectly dressed, and regardless of the hour, on alert.
Draco went on, having fun, and Harry couldn't hear the last of his soliloquy over the mutterings of The Voice.
"My aunt and uncle saw me as both a burden and an obstacle. They didn’t want me to assimilate—they wanted me to disappear. So I prepared food that I couldn’t touch, and I was given the excess, if there was any, out of what they could pretend was overzealous penny-pinching. They hadn't planned on having a second mouth to feed, so they decided not to feed it. But they withheld meals out of cruelty on top of that. It was an acceptable way for them to show their anger with me, I think— they didn’t see it as abuse. I didn’t either—it wasn’t the kind that showed too obviously."
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Of course he’d be worried about that. Beyond vanity, a permanent scar would be an addition to the diary of pains he already carried on his body. One more story wished forgotten but made tangible. The sorts of stories you could touch.
Malfoy stared at him. It was not unlike the feeling of being watched by a cat, unblinking. Or a dragon, now that Harry thought about it. Definitely reptilian. If Harry thought he felt naked before, it was nothing compared to this feeling of being seen
"You," Malfoy whispered. He struggled to push the words out. "Shouldn't—be—here." His hands rose from the water and gripped either side of the tub, as though he were preparing to launch himself directly into Harry. Harry didn't avoid his stare. He'd been tackled in training by people and Beings twice Malfoy's weight, even when he was sopping wet.
. The voice in his head was all the more painful to hear considering he'd had a reprieve from it. Blind, willful hope kept him afloat, and with even that gone, he was empty, washed out.
Draco’s gaze does not rest on the back of Harry’s head. His stare is drawn there and it sticks because he is afraid, and to look at anything else at the moment would be asking for it.
part of the Weasley family, but also knew that there were things he'd never really understand. Fred hadn't been his brother; they hadn’t grown up together. He'd never know the tint of grief the Weasley's felt, but at least he felt like he was getting closer to letting go of the wish to be included in an impossible way.
"That's all fine, but Justin is just so," Harry dared a peek around the edge of the booth to look over to where Justin stood with the group. He cradled his beer, laughing along to something Luna had said, sandy-blonde curls shaking around his head, looking right at home with them all.
"After the trials?" Harry asked. The fight seeped out of him when he got to feeling sad, the way he felt now.
Draco put down the glass at last and placed his hands in the small of his back. He dropped his chin to and huffed a laugh into his chest.
"I won't let them," Harry said. The words sounded childish to his own ears. "Don't worry about it. Report me if you need to. I can go to Ron and talk to him. He could sort it. I'll make sure this won't touch you."
He looked, connected that it was Draco's tongue, lapping slow strokes on his cock, attached to his body. Draco's mouth sucking gently, Draco's teeth, even, gently pushing back the foreskin.
Harry’d heard death rattles before, but none so good as this. Never accompanied by wet trails from eyes that held his. Malfoy’s scratching gentled and his wheezing could only barely pass the swollen glands of his throat, the bloated lash of his tongue finishing the job nicely.
"That would really throw a wrench in our itinerary, wouldn't it?" He kept his tone light, desperate to ignore the bad in favour of the good.
Harry ran a hand nervously through his hair. Damn if he couldn't keep his traitorous hands still for one moment.
"Alright," Draco gulped. "Okay. Alright. Let's try another. I want to see you naked. Can I undress you?"
Harry scanned the room for anything conspicuously missing. Looked to Draco’s fingers and found them bare.
Draco would break, after all. If there was anyone who would show up in the operating theatre after a fall, a crushing injury, or, once, a blow from a cursed bludgers bat that shattered his ilium—four minutes before Harry’s shift ended—it was Draco.
Malfoy jutted his jaw out and huffed so hard that the bit of hair that had flopped forwards into a fringe shot up at the air explosion. He was close enough that Harry could smell him—citrusy and sweet, almonds, like a crunchy croissant. He wondered if he could taste his sweat one more time if he could just—
Harry watched, amused, as everyone trickled in. Victoria had made it, with a dashing older man on her arm. He must have been from an old pureblood family, as Kreacher was falling over himself doting upon them, fluffing the pillows of the loveseat they selected. Suddenly, Draco's body was pressed up along his back, arms draped over Harry's shoulders.
A great whooshing noise announced Draco throwing the blanket and sheets back, sitting up and facing Harry in a huff. His eyelids were puffy from lack of sleep and his hair was terribly ruffled and Harry had the unvarnished thought that he looked so
famous, yes? I assume you get a mountain of mail weekly, and you must have someone sort it for you. You're useless at organizing." He poked a toe into Harry's side. "I'm fairly sure I'm yet to see you in a pair of matching socks."
Nott disappears into a loo with some bird as soon as you accept his damp bills, and you're on your own. Truly—too many of the recognizable faces at this party, none of them friendly.
"Thank you. Now, please stay put. Don't disappear on me; it'll only serve to annoy me once I find you. I want to explain all that business with Pans, and I—" he looked to a gold wristwatch that Harry had never seen him wear before and swore under his breath. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, releasing it on a sigh. "I wouldn't leave at all; it's only that I promised my mum that I'd help out this morning." He tugged at the collar of his cloak, clearly unhappy with how it sat, and Harry motioned him over.
Ron tapped his wand much harder than required at the torn paper to mend it. He managed even this grumpily.
Penelope moved back to the end of his bed and stood there, blinking at him. Weighing her options quickly, the way she always did. She had a stare that was a bit uncanny, but Harry found it soothing. She didn't shy away from hard diagnoses, straightforwardly delivered the truth.
—as Draco had once put it. At navigating whatever this was. Perhaps Draco wanted to pull, sure. He was interested enough in Harry to fuck his mouth, but that hardly qualified the two of them to what—go on a date? Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter? They lead abysmally cut-off lives from anything resembling normal. Neither of them had much of an opportunity to meet new people, let alone nice, normal people. Who in their position wouldn't want a quick fuck—especially a discrete fuck—when they could get it?
Malfoy folded his chest to his knees and started working on the knots in the laces of his boots. His eyes were totally closed, forehead properly furrowed from his frown. Harry stared at him, sallow and made to look fragile by the shadows cast by the lengths of hair curtaining each side of his face.
," Harry said, wincing his eyes closed as the spell scoured his face clean, the scent of lavender and lemons briefly filling the air. "Susan couldn't have told me that once, the entire time we were talking?" he grumbled.
"I'll be alright," he said, his nodding helping him believe it too. "I kind of made a fool of myself, but he got me through it, and we...talked."
"Overnights with your godson, hmm?" Draco said with a raised brow as he peeled off his boots at the front door.
Harry couldn't contain his grin when various bits of crockery clattered as knives and forks dropped to them. He was impressed that though Mr Weasley dribbled a sip of water down his front, he managed to quite handily clean it with a quick charm before anyone else noticed.
"Use it or not once I'm gone, that's up to you. But it's private, and it would be great to get a complete statement from you all in one go if possible. I don't mean to interrupt you any more than I've got to, and I mean that. Just doing my job."
"That's why I wake up with a start, sometimes," Draco said. "I dream about him. But he's you. They're nightmares, actually. I have these nightmares and it's you who dies in them, over and over again, and then I wake up and you're still here, and I'm so scared that one day you won't be. I'm scared that I'll show you the worst, rotten bits of me and once you see the ugly parts you'll be gone." He held Harry's face between his palms, scrutinizing it.
They started up a chorus of yelling then, and it was the bottle thrown at great velocity at the ceiling that shattered and showered a million little shards of green glass onto the crown of Malfoy’s head that woke him up to his decision.
Harry hated how Draco's face didn't waver at all to say that, and in the next breath, he looked over to the waiter approaching their table and ordered for them both. Harry would have the steak, medium-well; Draco the fish. Sparkling water for the table, ta.
Draco leaned in close. "The truth is I haven’t watched anything shot after 1940 because the effects make me jump, and when this gives me nightmares, it's all your fault," he added in a whisper.
"I'm not—,” Harry took a deep breath. The dimple in Draco's cheek was a tell that he was trying to rile him up on purpose. "Not falling for it. So—what actually brings you here?"
Harry nodded, still feeling uncertain. "Then, you'll bend over the bed as I asked, and I'll take good care of you." Draco's tone softened as he touched Harry's hip, thumb rubbing a circle. "Promise."
"Do you want to come in, then?" Draco directed the question at his feet as he played with his keys. Harry noticed that he was in gloves again, which was odd, for a Muggle event.
"Trust, I don't always win. I don't feel like I'm winning today," he said. Pansy gave him a once over and winced.
"You need that, don't you?" Draco leaned in to growl the question in his ear. Harry nodded, panting a few breaths before he struggled to answer, "Yes, sir." Draco inhaled sharply, surprised at the honorific, and it was only Harry that knew that did it for him, wasn't it?
For the first time since they sat down to talk, Malfoy seemed genuinely uncomfortable. He fidgeted, worrying the edge of his robe between long fingers.
"Quite," Draco tapped his lips with the tip of one long finger, watching Harry anxiously. Like he expected an explosion. "I've heard worse,” he tried to lessen the senselessness of the comment. He'd hidden
And he looked to Ron just as he grimaced like the word was an aberration, and Harry lost it. Felt his stomach drop and his heart stutter.
Draco grasped for it again as Harry stumbled back, staying just out of reach. He stopped and huffed, his bottom jaw jutting forwards, eyes wide.
"We make exceptions for carrot cake. It's my favourite," he said, shortly. "No ice cream, thanks," he added.
"—alright, whatever, you're often such a flipping honest, good little Gryffindor about things, and as such keep refusing to be disappointed in me, but I'll be plenty disgusted with myself for the both of us."
Harry proceeded through the night, leaving out the details that played on a loop in his mind. How the sparks like fireflies in the entranceway made Draco's hair shine or the new knowledge of the value of candied pineapple in carrot cake. He kept talking, though his mind turned to the treacherous thoughts he'd dared have about the future, plans made so flippantly for June, like he hadn't been shown time and time again that falling in love and making plans was a sure recipe for disaster. He kept on through the dinner, and dishes, and walking down the garden path, still thinking all the while of how he'd jinxed it
"I wonder why they blurred Teddy," Harry mused, pouring milk over a bowl of cornflakes. He was going to be late to the portkey office if he wasn't careful, and breakfasts with Draco had a tendency to run long. He liked to pretend it was because Draco was talkative; in reality, it was because he liked to wait until Draco was the one who had to run off, giving him a goodbye kiss and then locking up the house, that order of events setting certain of his ingrained anxieties to bed for the day better than if he were to leave Draco behind to do the job.
Bundy had clearly done the knots—Harry recognised the bights that held Malfoy’s wrists together from the term previous. Moon had to be the one who thought of stripping him, because his perversions knew no bounds. Dobbs was likeliest with a climate charm.
He looked down to the suds of his lager to reconcile where he was in time and space, touched his fingertips together to anchor himself to the now and noticed that they were tacky and black, the still-damp ink having smudged as he turned the pages. Dragging his eyes around the crowd for the first time in many minutes, away from the distress of the story—
Draco shook his head, mock-thoughtfully, a sharp tooth biting his lower lip. "No, I was thinking bigger. Think quidditch gear—knee-pads."
"This is going to be good," Pansy purred, sitting up from the prone position she'd taken when her dose of mushrooms came over her. She had bits of twigs in her bob; Parvati was kind enough to spell them free for her, though also tipsy enough that she ended up pulling them out roughly, causing a series of surprised yelps.
. And they were convenient, really, in that Harry needed a release valve for all the worries he'd been collecting, so he touched Draco's cheek and said, "Look away, or take a walk around the block if you have to."
Harry pulled the cigarette from his fingertips and puffed on it. The smoke filled him, brought dizziness into the mix. He liked it, maybe. Maybe just because it felt different.
They walked down the block, the photographers shooting off as many shots as they could, all five of them moving at a swift pace. Harry could see their lips moving, hear their shouts as though through water—dim, muffled, unable to make out individual words.
"In the rain," Malfoy said. They'd arrived on the landing to the sound of raindrops falling on the roof above them.
Harry felt a chill that had nothing to do with the misty drizzle falling around them. The sirens approaching from all directions faded into nothing—background noise. And Justin smiled, coy and cold in its own way, and took a few small steps towards him.
"Did you miss this the way I missed this?" Draco edged down Harry's body, and Harry was trying to form the word to answer his question, but it came out garbled because all of a sudden the slit of his cock had something warm and wet pressing into it—he'd forgotten how devious the tip of Draco's tongue could be—and the word
"That's a well-trained boy you've got there," he said, and Harry could feel every visible inch of his body blush.
It started with the party. Little more annoying than cokeheads in denial, never saving the number you gave them last time.
"I called it! I've got a friend of yours over here—or mate, I guess, I always thought mate was weird—Drake!" He called over to Draco, who was turned in his chair, eyes half-lidded as he took the both of them in together. In other circumstances, Harry was certain that he'd be apoplectic, but the most he seemed able to conjure was a look of bored acceptance. He gave Harry a hard stare, and Harry watched the muscles in his throat work as he swallowed.
"You’ll end up with spots on the wine glasses that way," Harry said. He and Ron shared a look—it was what Molly always complained about whenever Ron dried and put away dishes. Ron shrugged it off.
"I'm ready for a fresh round. Should I grab one for the mystery girl?" Justin asked. "She's not gone and stood you up now, has she?" The question was for Luna, but his gaze trailed over to Harry more than once. Justin tastes normally strayed much posher than Harry, but he'd started hanging around more often of late, Harry's marginally rising star drawing him closer into orbit.
He continued on until the door to number six was across from him and stopped, toed out of the slides, and sat heavily. His body felt about a hundred pounds heavier than normal, bones turned to lead. He pulled his knees up and into his chest to wait it out.
It was uncomfortable, pulling the items from the bag out, but he managed it. It was good practice to face the things that reminded him of Draco in private, to school his features. No tears—no more tears. He wouldn't allow it anymore. He wouldn't give him that anymore.
and not have people bat an eye anymore? How would he make small talk with members of a pureblood family his own had openly mocked as blood-traitors?
That got Draco's attention. He blinked rapidly, his jaw dropping open. Healer Annan gestured with his palms to the ground, shushing motions.
Malfoy made a sound of understanding. Harry squinted at him, confused. "What would you know about dating Muggles?"
Harry found another sliver and rested it on the dip of his lip. Draco’s eyelids lowered and his hand rested on Harry’s wrist. He tugged, so the sliver retreated. Pushed it in to breach the tiny hole centred in his pout.
Draco stripped bare with impressive timing and snuck his hands into the top of Harry's trousers to help him out of them and his pants in one go. Harry yanked his glasses off, and it was on. They tumbled to the bed a mess of limbs, little sounds of pleasure humming from Draco's throat.
Draco hummed and left a long pause. Harry could practically hear him collecting his thoughts when he did this, now.
"Harry, Harry, Harry. Stop," Draco pressed a finger, cold from resting against the stone beneath them for so long, against his lips. "Don't try to fix this. I'm fine. Listen to me—drop it."
"Fuck. All this talk of parents," he said. Little droplets fell steadily, sparkling gems dotting his hair. His eyes were the lightest crystal, the ethereal colour they took when the weather was drab. It was like they changed to outshine the day's grey. "I was trying to give you something else to think about."
"I don't have to. I've done the math, and the timing is off." Grey eyes widened—there, a tell. He'd been caught in a lie that he'd thought was airtight. "You take too long when you go alone because you go longer. Of course, you run five, it's a nice, even number, and you like that number, don't you?" Draco's eyes were sparkling, and if he cried, Harry was afraid that he'd stop speaking because he didn't want to hurt him, so he kept speaking, as fast as he could push the words out. "You like fives and zeros. It's too much strain on your body, and you push and push and push until you're exhausted, I honestly don't know how you do it. I couldn't do all that you do. I'm watching your body fall apart from the sidelines—you've had the same bruise on your foot that hasn't healed in over a month, and it's not just because you're not any good with healing charms. It takes a lot of energy to cast healing charms on yourself all the time, doesn't it? This hasn't happened overnight."
Harry made a sound of acceptance. Draco squeezed him and pulled away, his hands at each of Harry's shoulders. Harry held his gaze—something about this admission didn't sit right with him.
"Yes, I did keep a list, because I too once held the belief that the number of people you've had sex with meant something, but then I realized that the number doesn't mean anything,
"Who's that?" he asked. He hoped it sounded like he didn't care—polite rather than digging. A tiny alarm bell was going off in his mind.
"You'll have to finish your lunch first!" Harry called after his retreating back, "And no running in the house!"
“I shouldn’t have left you on your knees so long—just look at what I was missing.” Draco pressed his sweat-soaked temple to Harry’s, whispering directly into his ear as he pulled and pulled, so slowly it was killing Harry. His thighs shook with the effort of holding him up—he was so fucking
"Hmmm," Andromeda looked impressed. "Another trip to the bird sanctuary, I presume? Pray tell, what did the snake have to say for himself?"
As always, Draco radiated heat that spoke to a fire burning under his snowy exterior. Harry tucked his feet in against his shins to warm them, cold from having poked out the end of the blanket.
"That's a start for sure, Mione," he gave her a smile. "As far as it goes convincing Draco, um. Well," he fiddled with his t-shirt sleeves, more specifically the holes in the hems. "I'm a bit of a blathering idiot when it comes to—love," Harry said, and her eyebrows promptly shot up as Ron turned very slowly to look first at her, then at him.
Harry was off-balance at being caught checking Draco out and having noticed by said checking out that Draco looked fucking incredible in said jeans. He gulped nervously. This wasn't going well.
"Shower, a real shave, got it. Kreacher can do you up breakfast if you want, just ask—I'll be down in a jiff," Harry said. As he left the room, he spied Reza spreading out options of glasses frames in whatever tortoiseshell was in the same spot that days ago held photo after photo of a young Draco Malfoy, impeccably dressed. Harry had stowed the pictures in his bedside table, taking them out a night to flick through them.
Draco slid down the bed; the sight of his superbly muscled back a wonder. Harry smoothed a hand over his shoulder and around to rub the hills of his spine at the nape of his neck.
"Just touch me," Harry said shakily. He couldn't express that what he craved was anything Draco would give him. A kiss was enough. "Touch me and talk to me. That's all I need."
"You always are," Draco responded, brushing their lips together for the barest of kisses. Things were delicate, on the brink of
“I don’t know that I agreed to a new study,” he said. He liked the things—he’d said so himself, and Harry knew when he was lying. He'd deflected a bit from how much he liked them by talking about the need to shop for Teddy—linens and toys, and healthy treats, and second sets of clothes. But still, this irksome holding out of total acceptance. It rubbed like sandpaper against the soft part of him that was reaching out, waiting for an answering hand to grasp onto. All he needed was
"Lucky for you, they're not," she said. Harry heaved a sigh and craved a drink, annoyed that alcohol was now reserved for weekends and special occasions. He wished he'd never shown them the sumptuous new carpets of the halls, fresh grout between shining tiles in the bathrooms, and especially not the superking sized bed that had replaced his prior double. "You should see the look on your face."
"Because he came and represented me at my sentencing, or are you actually going to sit there and pretend that he isn't your personal fucking counsel?"
"Any words!" Harry was glad to be able to react like this in what was effectively an emergency because there was a high likelihood that Draco would freak out the moment he could. He could pretend levity, remain jovial, and it felt fine to do it in service of Draco's nerves.
"Listen, he may be looking, I'll give you that, but it's only because he recognizes me. That's it! I'm—don't give me that look, Ron—I'm being honest! If I were some random bloke in the bar, he wouldn't give me a second glance."
Draco cleared his throat but didn't say anything. He handed the pamphlet to Harry and smoothed the wrinkles from the blanket over his lap. He stared at it, so Harry couldn’t read the look on his face when he asked, “Is it permanent? Will...will there be scars?”
Harry snorted. "You're right. It is bullshit. But who’s going to tattle on me?" Draco didn’t say anything, and Harry bit the inside of his cheek.
"Also, if you could, get him drinking butterbeer instead of soda while you're at it." He winked like he was letting Harry onto a secret. "We've got to get him drinking his calories again."
Harry was tired of all the clapping, but with so many eyes on him, he didn't dare show it. He kept his gaze trained high as the ghosts of Hogwarts castle bled from the walls to complete another turn above the Great Hall tables in their yearly formation gliding showcase. As they finished, he tried clapping into his non-dominant hand, hard enough that his palms stung. He clapped harder.
"We went for dinner, and it was extravagant, and I'll never forget that you tried a dessert involving hay mousse for me, Ronald dearest," she placated him before turning her attention back to Harry, who wanted more than anything to sulk in self-pity for longer than she'd allow it. "Harry. Stop beating yourself up about it. And I see right through that change in subject." She lowered her voice, eyes swiping left and right to determine how private their conversation remained among the throng of friends and family, "Really though, are you alright? You'd tell us if you weren't right?"
"Wider," he said. Harry felt it as a command in his bones, pushing his legs as wide as they would go and then, when that wasn't enough, banishing the clothes around his ankles to the corner of the room and arching his back to display his arse.
"People have talked for a long time about what Greyback did. Not in polite company, but, still. How he preferred children. The Death Eaters in the house joked that he liked to play with his food."
"You're his emergency contact, and you were just going to leave?” He couldn't believe this was happening. He didn’t want to believe that the Narcissa that Draco visited, and loved, would allow her husband into his vicinity, but that was another matter entirely. The cruelty of her plans seemed outsize.
"I did. Do, sometimes. I drop-in when I can and go for a contemporary class on Sundays." Harry thought about it, about to respond when Draco cut him off, "When you have Weasley family dinner. That's why you haven't noticed."
Harry thought on the question while watching the growing crowd beyond the double doors. Ludo Bagman practically gave himself whiplash from the velocity of his double-take in their direction, and he noticed a few sets of eyes pointedly flick away when he looked their way. His mood darkened as he realized that his time alone with Draco was on a timer too.
"You're depressed, Draco. Not the way I am, or was. I had—have, I don't know—I have grief, and anxieties, sure, but you? You've got something deep that you've lived with for a long time, in a way I don't understand, and you've done an excellent job managing, but you don't have to manage all on your own."
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat as Ron loosened his grip and let him retreat away from a few short steps, aware of his aversion to most touch. He chewed nervously at a thumbnail; it was already close to the quick, but he couldn't help it.
"I paid attention before," Harry said moodily before he realized that riling him up was Draco's goal all along.
Draco didn't flinch, tilted his head in acknowledgement. "Yes, I never was terribly creative when it came to naming those I bullied. Poor Harry got Scarhead for god's sake."
When he looked again, Draco regarded him with his head on a tilt. He placed his hands wide to each side, leaned back, and tilted his head the other way. Like a hawk, watching. Harry, the mouse. The way he observed him fast became heated, its own form of touch and Harry's body reacted to it as such, coming alive.
"Again, Amir's on it, as he has signing authority when you're away and Christine's—" he snapped his fingers, raced through the words, "it’s not debit, not cash—" he snapped more and squinted, and within seconds his eyes flew open as it hit him, "Christine’s
smile, and it placated her, though Hermione and Ron were staring at one another, having one of their side conversations that required little but movements of their eyebrows and twitches of their lips.
Draco shook his head a little. "No. Normally I need to concentrate on listening in, but with you, it just happens. Happened—it wasn't like this at school. At school, I could barely hear you."
He found them slightly tighter in the arse and thigh than he'd like, but that was nothing another drink couldn't assuage. A leather belt and a pair of black trainers later, he felt close to ready as he checked himself out in the mirror.
Draco avoided Harry’s eyes as he realized this was something of an apology he was trying to give. A roundabout way of saying "
"Fancy giving a bloke a break?" Harry said, and Draco snorted into his chest, his body hanging limp, dead weight. The gloss he'd so carefully applied earlier had melded with his sweat, and sparkles blinked from every sharp, damp point on his face when he looked down at Harry, nose to nose.
Pansy Parkinson smelled of clove cigarettes and stale tequila, and Harry was exactly hungover enough for the combination to be lethal. He swallowed bile and grimaced, attempted to stand straight and contain his nausea as she tapped her wand along the hem of his garment, needles piercing the fabric in tight circles.
He sucked in a ragged breath and complied, a tired slump to his shoulders as he pulled his feet up to the seat of his chair and wrapped his arms around bony knees, staring at Harry over their knobby tops.
He pulled off his glasses and folded the tines, placing them next to his fork and knife, then rested his elbows on the table and let his face fall forwards to rest his head in his hands. He barely heard the clatter of chair legs against the floor as the smell of coconuts and ink-thinner grew thick beside him, Hermione's arm slung over his shoulders. His breaths heaved as tears he hadn't been sure would be able to form wet his lashes into daubs of black and spilled, fat droplets staining the thighs of his jeans.
“I fuck you because I love him. Do you think—is that what the mirror is about?” Harry huffs a laugh and Not Draco tugs the sheet up in a vague attempt to cover his nakedness for once.
"Is too my bloody business now, you beastly pillock. I've got your sweat on me!" Malfoy pulled the trademark sneer, hands brushing at his chest. "What if your strain of imbecile is contagious? You should be so lucky that I'm still here. Honestly, Potter, you're a wreck—"
running through his mind each day he'd waited for the owls of the day to come, very carefully arranging his features and staying busy, oh so very careful not to ask if there was any mail for him.
Draco rolled his eyes as he fumbled about for his wand, concentrated on the spell to mend the hole. They watched as each thread found its mate and rebound, spiralling into one another until no one would ever be able to tell there had been a tear at all.
, but you know what I mean, I don't know many people who don't care about who I am or what I do or who I shag—"
"Not quite." Harry looked around the room, taking in the titles on the bookshelf across from him. Many were in Latin, though some were Muggle in provenance, thick textbooks with cheap, waxy covers. "We used fake Galleons to set up meetings of Dumbledore's Army back in sixth year. I still have some kicking around at home."
The conversation was so good and frankly, the early afternoon glasses of wine so free-flowing that by the time Harry pecked Hermione's cheek goodbye, he'd quite nearly forgot what his other, perfectly reasonable reason for visiting the Ministry had been. The wine made him sloppy, so he failed to apply a glamour as they re-entered the building during the lunch rush's tail-end, suddenly face-to-face with a crush of workers queuing for the Floos in the Atrium or arriving back from their breaks. By luck alone, he made it to the hushed sanctity of Hermione's office back into the lift before being assaulted by the incandescent blast of a flashbulb.
Andromeda nodded thoughtfully, eyeing Draco as she did it. "I think that would be lovely to give a go. I wouldn't mind a little more time to converse with adults," she said. "Before I forget, Molly mentioned that we can push mealtime back by an hour to accommodate your schedule, young man. We always do end up eating at seven anyway, and this way there will be no need for grovelling or excuses.”
"Thank you," he said, "but I've stopped that regimen." Draco's eyes widened as he popped the finger into his mouth.
Harry had to think about it. "A little," he said. "I haven't said it to some of the people that matter yet, though, to their faces. Or, you know. Held someone's hand in public." Harry looked to his own rough hands, hands he couldn't trust not to inflict pain. Over to Draco's, trembling gone now, covered as they always were in public. Protected from a painful world.
, knew Draco wouldn't like that, but found another truth that fit the bill, that was honest "—doing what I'd normally do."
"I'm a pureblood. We're all aware of that." Kreacher bowed to hear this, and Harry let go of the firm grip he held on two bits of speaker wire, curious where Draco was going with this. "I'm Malfoy-Black, and that makes me partial heir to this house, and it connects you and me, Kreacher, in that you have a long history with the noble and most ancient house of Black."
on his lips, tears not yet fallen making his eyes sparkle, an exquisite pain yanking down every available muscle in his face. He'd looked so hurt, like Harry hadn't just wronged him once but had pulled back a curtain to reveal a forever of lies. Like Harry had proven him right, like he'd been waiting to be let down that way.
Inside the club, the night was a whirlwind. Harry spent it watching—watching Alex transform and perform, a dancer, contorting onstage into the most beautiful shapes. Watching Draco transform too, his movements languid and sensuous, stepping expertly in stilettos as though he wore them every day. He worked the crowd for tips following Alex’s act, bending over to pinch bills that had slipped from the stage from the tacky floor below, lower back arched so his little arse pushed out against the fabric of his skirt, mouthing "
"Aunt Bella found out first, conclusively, that I was gay. She was in charge of Occlumency lessons, though she was much more interested in forced Legilimency. She liked to take things without permission. Memories. People. That's why she and Greyback got along so well. They used to share." He spoke so lightly like he wasn't talking about breaking into minds and bodies. A shiver ran down Harry's spine. He worried about where this was going. About if he'd be sick.
Draco didn't say anything in response, but he slammed into Harry so hard that the window set in the hallway wall rattled in its pane, and Harry started on a long moan that had no end, eyes closed and mouth stuck ajar as Draco changed the angle, his hands pressing down on either side of his ribs, cock fucking up into him so that he rubbed that little bundle of nerves that made Harry feel like he was coming inside out.
Harry did, chin down towards his chest as his orgasm broke through the barrier that had been holding it back. Draco was blurred, a ghost, or an angel, but Harry could tell that he was staring him in the face as he watched the ropy strings of come shoot across his chest. A spot got on Harry's lip, his mouth caught open in the ragged exhalation that accompanied these moments of release. Draco didn't let up the pressure inside of him until Harry stopped pulling, until the last spurt of warmth wet his stomach.
wasn’t right. Harry knew full well what it was like to wake up, the hours between late and early completely lost to drink. But never had he woken and wondered about anything much worse than making a fool of himself. There had, one time, been knuckles red raw like he'd been punching a brick wall. Not a person—he'd damaged himself, not someone else—or so he hoped.
Harry made fists, hoped that he could manage a few minutes without doing anything too destructive or annoying. He'd drank his first coffee too quickly for want of something to do with his hands while waiting. That he'd arrived at the cafe thirty minutes early was beyond him, considering that the sun had barely peeked over the horizon. That he was nearly finished his second cup and Malfoy wasn't even late to their meeting-sounded-too-formal-but-coffee-date-too-trite was also driven by his own poor decision making. But the jitters had started long before he arrived.
He checked the Galleon when he finally visited the loo for a piss. The time on it was something new, the roman numerals parsing out to 19:00. Early evening meant that they could go at it for hours.
"Someone's chipper today," Draco intoned from behind a wall of printed paper when Harry descended into the dining room for breakfast. For the first time in three weeks neither Harry nor Draco blinked out from any portion of the front page, whose cover instead had the dread headline about an Azkaban prisoner up for release that month, convicted of Muggle child-killings twenty years previous.
"Why not a flannel?" Harry closed his eyes again, submitting to the massage. Draco's hands made him go boneless.
"I'd cut my food into pieces and push it around, but I couldn't eat, and that was dangerous, being weak around the Manor." Draco looked briefly possessed and shook his head, clearing away whatever memory had been unearthed. "When we were back at school, I learned it was easier to skip meals entirely than taking them in my rooms. Snape got the kitchens to report to him when Slytherins ordered in. I think it was to keep us from treating school like a romantic getaway at the weekends."
that he knew from the look he gave him once he landed that it was more than just his flying prowess that had Draco impressed.
"What's worse is that I was too spineless to try it on the blasted thing the first time around, but, I'm ready now. I'm ready to try again."
“What are you on about?” Harry threw his robe onto the bed on the left while Malfoy walked to his on the right. “You’d think someone would have noticed over the years if the Lead Potions Corporal were illiterate.”
Something about this sentence worked on Draco, who didn't descend into tears or prod Harry into a fight. Instead, he rummaged around in his rumpled trousers on the floor to find his wand and summoned a robe into his clean hand, Harry's come still wet on the backs of the fingers of his other.
And eventually, once he was slicked all over in oil and more than ready, once Draco was petting his hair and telling him how good he was, that the pad of the fingertip swirled around the edges dipped inside of him.
of utter surprise. His shoes were still on, and Harry worked the laces loose with his fingers. Knelt and held him by the backs of his calves, slipping his feet free. He needed Draco bare, needed all of his skin available, needed it
“An absolute classic. I’ve seen it a million times. My cousin was obsessed with it back when we were in school. It’s got dinosaurs.”
"Harry James Potter, if you don't let us help you, we'll go ahead and do it on our own. And I should think that you wouldn't want the future of your relationship to be totally decided by the inferences of your friends, so just lie down and let us help you, alright?"
"You don't want to believe us, Harry, but we saw him with our own eyes! He watched you walk all the long way outside, and then he looked back at the door three times before you walked back in." Hermione was effusive, a rare second glass of wine in her hand staining the edges of her lips purple and touching her movements. "
"You say things, sometimes, the things you believed about me when we were kids, and they're not true." It was Draco's turn to shrug as Harry sidled up close to plant another kiss at his shoulder. "You’d know that if you’d read the whole book. I know how fast you read."
“I’m trying.” Harry’s voice wasn’t his own anymore—high and strained. It was an ill-timed thing to say because by the time he said it, a switch inside him flipped and his balls drew up tightly against his body. Draco whispered into his right ear, “I fucking love you, Harry, I love you like this, come for me, pet,” his voice shaking, and that’s when he came, mouth open in a silent howl. His body shivered as his arse gripped around Draco involuntarily.
They touched each other less in public, though. Depending on where they were some touch was sanctioned, like kisses placed in the air, next to a cheek in greeting—but the casual acts of affection, a hand at the lower back, directing the other away from traffic or towards a window display of especial beauty—they became something to worry about, an itch in the brainstem to remain on high alert.
The first wave arrived precisely on time and included Ginny and Neville, who very gamely accepted Draco's handshake and offer of a chat, the importance of which none of them would be quick to forget. Padma and Parvati followed, with Padma's latest secret boyfriend revealed to be a very tall Nordic-looking man with close to no English. He was quickly cornered by Luna and drawn into a conversation conducted in a language of her own making, as she decided that using a translation charm would be cheating.
"All of it," he said. He licked at chapped lips when he felt a drop fall there, and the brackish taste that was Draco, slick above him, on him, in him, the salt of it made him moan.
He widened his eyes for added effect. Victoria seemed to agree with this look. She beamed from ear to ear.
“I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised at you being naturally gifted at anything anymore,” Draco said with a sigh. He let his hand linger, trailing the backs of his nails over Harry's forearm, leaving goosebumps in its wake.
Harry pocketed them, recognizing that this was her way of showing care. She left only to be replaced by Ron, who’d nipped to the office to collect paperwork.
Even that short trip upstairs was a vacation from the dour cloud that hung over Draco. He managed to get so worked up over being unable to slide the SIM card inside the plastic shell of the new mobile that Harry rounded the bottom of the staircase in time to see him fling the bits away so that they clattered down the length of the table. He swung suddenly forwards, cracking his forehead into the wood. It made a terrible flat sound, that smack.
There was no knowing how long they stayed like that. Harry could hardly think, couldn't speak. At least he was protected, encompassed by Draco's embrace.
Malfoy's face was impassive at surface level, but Harry's outburst was clearly like Christmas come early for him.
"Inflammation. One a day with breakfast for six weeks," she tossed him a bottle of pills that looked like they were meant for horses. "And yes, you can see him once he wakes up if he agrees or asks for you. You ought to get a tea or something before then, and try to
"Fleur sends her love, and Victoire too. I'm obligated to say that Mum and Dad want to have you over for dinner this weekend
You warn him that you're going to come and he rears back to sit up straight and puts four fingers in his own mouth to scream cry around when the angle sinks him further than you've managed. You come inside him in a series of shuddering jerks, your entire body a wire made stiff from stimulation. Your neck cracks and you forget yourself completely. The world goes white.
Draco's jibe was doubled by the fact that he was jogging backwards, the better to taunt Harry with his second-place performance.
A young woman with very green hair peered up at him, eyes flicking between his scar and his eyes. He was prepared for the question—
"Nothing to it," Draco said quietly, mouthing the side of Harry's prick. "Stripping. When you do it for me, you can't do it wrong. I love to see you naked; you must know that."
That the interviewer was Luna was a stroke of good planning in Harry's favour. That she had set up as the interview as a casual conversation over thousand-flavour ice-creams while on a walk of her property was a pleasant surprise. Harry tried his best to be candid, if not too revealing. He loved Luna, but she had an uncanny way of saying things that at first blush sounded silly, but on review often elicited more than just foolish answers. Answers that revealed more than the subject meant to.
"He comes to meetings well-prepared and bearing decent peace offerings," she said, "and by that, I mean piping hot cappuccinos from my favourite shop five blocks over. Rain or sleet or wind, he's always got one for me."
"Jesus fucking Christ, you're going to be the end of me," Draco breathed, and then Harry got back into position, and Draco spread him apart once more.
Harry closed his eyes, basking in the feel of the sun on his skin, such a rare thing this time of year. The week previous had matched his mood—never-ending grey, a drizzle that wouldn't quit. Kreacher had caught a cold, and Harry had never known the elf to be sick a day in his life. And now, this—freezing and cloudless, and all he'd wanted to do was to enjoy a sliver of it alone, but he couldn't, and he was going to be damned if anyone interrupted him at it.
"Okay," Harry said. He watched as his Adam's apple worked in his pale throat, breathed him in again, memorizing the moment. Time and space were difficult, were the two things Harry most wanted to share with Draco, but they'd be worth it if it meant more of him, one day, somehow.
"I'm seeing Draco again," Harry announced. The words tumbled from his lips as he dipped his spoon into a melting mountain of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Ice Cream later that night, not needing to look up to know the expressions on his friend's faces.
"Were you so afraid of having someone Apparate on top of us?" Draco asked, turning the messenger bag strapped across his back around to the front and dug out a hand lotion. He twisted it into his hands, a cover for his continued nervousness.
His eyebrows rose as he leaned in and spoke very slowly, as though to a child. "It's a gay club, Potter. You're not gay."
She gave a deep sigh—she was relenting, though he hadn’t a clue why he was such a problem, to begin with.
Draco sighed, and Harry pushed. "Know what? Say it." They were walking faster now, around couples and families and tourists, all of them far too slow for Draco's liking.
—pressed up against his prick, asking for entrance to Harry's body at the same time, and his brain screamed
Harry could feel a hot prickle at the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the alcohol. Before he could say anything, Hermione came back to herself, nodding and humming thoughtfully.
Draco leaned back in his chair, one eyebrow lowered. He frowned lightly. "I'm sorry—I don't follow."
He dropped into the chair next to Harry, elbow perched on the tabletop to rest the sharp line of his jaw in his hand.
"You're welcome, weirdo." He released Ron and in return he rubbed Harry's shoulder, gave it a squeeze. The sound of water stopped, and soon there was Draco, looking at the two of them.
, eyes wide, near-manic, a full six-inches taller than Harry ever remembered him standing tall, the necessities of work doing incredible things to un-stoop his ancient frame.
Malfoy doesn’t have a quick comeback at the ready for this possibility, which is a surprise all in itself. Harry isn’t surprised very often.
recorded," Hermione helpfully informed anyone who brought it up all day—"how's that for climate change deniers?"
"This isn't about sides," Hermione said, levelly. She sucked her teeth, thinking. "Can't you see this is important to him? Even if it is—

Harry wanted to defend himself. He wanted to say that unequivocally, that Draco trusted him. But he didn't yet.
It didn’t matter if he was sure. He wanted to try something. To become someone who did things by choice.
, and I told him to stop being cute and then he looked at me, like, full up and down sweep, and said,
"Again." He sank deeper into a kneeling position against the tub so that he could face Malfoy. Hooking his right arm around the tub's edge, he beat out the tattoo of their ever slowing breaths into the porcelain.
"You're lucky to have me," she told him. Harry took a deep breath, willing his hardening cock to wilt. Who was he to disagree?
Malfoy’s eyelids were closed again but the seam glistened. Harry had a lot of practise pretending not to notice when that happened.
Her eyes scanned him from end to end in a millisecond. She didn't respond; he was being tested, and it was only then that Harry realized his mistake. Draco must have told his coworkers about his
Draco looked away then, and Harry wondered if this bravado was covering for something. Perhaps once upon a time, Draco had hoped for the sunset and the fairytale ending. There were flashes when the cold mask slipped, and underneath, Harry could clearly imagine Draco's soft centre—someone warm, sweet, even. It was a fantasy; obviously, he was projecting, but still.
"The first is for protection, the second is for cleanliness," he continued, grabbing his wand from where it had rolled towards Harry's elbow. He squeezed his eyes shut, wishing for all the world that this was something he'd learned already in some grotty car or alone—but then Draco added, "You're lucky to have me teach you. If you get the pronunciation wrong on the second one, it makes for a
Harry let his shoulders sag a little further, rolling them back to release the tension they held, cracking his neck.
Harry circled a finger into the sheet. “Because you need a place to get away sometimes?” He closed his eyes. It didn’t feel good to admit where his mind wandered, but better out than in. “To have, er—a break from me. I’m sure I’m tiring, I know I’m still a shite Occlumens, and I find my own thoughts annoying, I can’t imagine, I—”
"Secondly," Draco continued, locking eyes with Mrs Weasley, who was clutching at her chest and by god Harry would eat his shoe if she made it through this without bursting into tears, "I have to apologize for my frankly abhorrent conduct."
"Okay, good. Let's start with that," Harry said. He uncorked it and brought its edge carefully to his blue-tinged lips, tipping half into his mouth. Harry was careful not to wince at the sound of his ragged breathing in the small space. He glanced over at Malfoy's shower things—a sea sponge, white and blue bottles of Kiehl's products, shampoo and conditioner and lord only knew what else in bottles with Spanish labels—as the breaths came more easily. It was better, but not good enough.
In life, standing over the workbench, Draco leaned forwards into the deep red light and shook his hair loose to cover his eyes. He stared at his image in silence for a long time.
, Harry was always quick to remind himself. He had no proof, of course, but it fit a pattern, the kind of pattern that only Harry had ever been able to see. Things around him cracked and broke all the time, and others were too kind to attribute the breakage to him, but he knew in his heart when things were his fault, and at least this time, he knew what he could do to fix it.
"Cover story," Draco responded, his tone implying Harry's idiocy. He sniffed, "and they're a poor fit. You're forever pinching the bridge of your nose, mentioning headaches. I figured it would never occur to you to have them adjusted. I've added a cushioning charm around the temples, and there's a potion I wanted to try out coating the arms."
He devoted the next hour to respond to the letters in the emerald-coloured envelope. They were so carefully worded as to be meaningless. Harry was impressed at how many euphemisms for "gay" could be made in the English language, frankly. A spell to copy out boilerplate responses sufficed for most of them. He was careful not to commit himself to anything—no galas, no balls, no silent auctions—as Victoria had taught him how to neatly side-step those invitations and funnel them back through her for review. Robards' offer of a consultancy position was put aside to be dealt with later, too, generating a low-grade sense of worry in Harry's stomach. He wasn't ready to re-join the Aurors, not yet, not even in a comfortable, paper-pushing position.
Teddy gasped. "Flying!" He turned to Harry. "Harry! I don't have my broom here but Grandma says if you're in charge I can ride it and Charlie B. from school started last year already and he fell and got the

do it. That was my high weight, and at the time it felt—well, not fantastic, I wasn't exactly comfortable, but that had more to do with end-stage Noah than with—it doesn’t matter—it was alright. Bearable." He sucked in a great breath, and Harry finally licked his thumb and wiped the line from his cheek, an excuse to touch him, if only for a few seconds. He didn't pull away.
"Ah! Smile, remember? Always be smiling, always smiling. Just take a deep breath and don't listen to a word they say to you or to me, alright? Let's—"
"Well, stop making Harry feel bad about something he can't do anything about, then." She knocked back a handful of tropical-looking beans, chewing for a moment before smiling. A safe batch—she was uncannily good at avoiding the disgusting ones. The look she gave Harry was apologetic, and her warm brown eyes made it easy to remember how things had been straightforward with her, even if they’d lacked that spark of intimacy. He missed her, or rather the closeness which had been lost, in moments like this.
"A new form of stress relief?" Harry called out, finally. Draco responded by smashing a set of porcelain teacups, not turning to face him.
. He closed his eyes and thought about the intention of the spell, trying his spin on it non-verbally. He opened them to Draco, beaming at his suddenly clean chest and hand.
Or so he pretended as he started down the stairs and then immediately retraced his steps because he couldn't go getting soft now. He reluctantly put down the whisky, summoned the bottles and trudged about, putting them away.
Harry frowned as his body made its various needs apparent. "I need a shower, I think. I feel terrible."
"It doesn't have to be a bad thing, pet," Draco said, his hand finally making it to its target. He wrapped his fingers around Harry's cock and began stroking him fully hard again, and Harry let him.
Draco did it again, and again, touching a spot and asking and then kissing it, settling his weight fully into Harry’s lap, until Harry was desperate for something more.
"Harry," Draco said. He pushed up to stand, a worried frown wrinkling his forehead. "I'm right here."
He flipped open his phone, was glad to note that he had a signal, a rarity in purely magical buildings. He pushed the buttons slowly with his thumbs, checking the message twice before sending it. Ron needed to call in a solicitor for George if he were to be questioned by Aurors. It didn't matter his level of guilt—it was the only way to ensure that the ensuing court case be fair.
Harry gave a clenched smile, pissed that he was a head and a half shorter than the oaf that had played with Draco’s heart for so much longer than he’d had the chance to get to know him properly.
He wondered if he would feel split open or if it would be good. If it was with Draco, he couldn't imagine it being anything but incredible.
"The list of possible effects is long. The most common are what we've already diagnosed, namely muscle weakness and speech loss. There can be physical, mental, and emotional tolls. I'm glad to note that your ability to communicate hasn't been significantly altered, Mr Malfoy, judging by your, shall we call it a playful affect."
“We need each other,” Draco said. He turned his cheek to meet his pillow. Harry took that as his dismissal, picked up the roses, and left.
"They're all in on it. Tom, Victoria—they're probably how reporters have known my schedule for months now. And Robards, I swear, he's been coming at me from all angles about a get-back-to-work plan." The room's lights flowed brighter, brighter still, and sparks lit a fresh fire in the previously cold grate in the corner.
What Harry did concentrate on was touch. The latex of the opera-length gloves Cissy wore was smooth where it rubbed at Harry's jaw, fingertips smoothing back from his temple and into his hair. Harry smiled, gave another few pumps of his prick with his hand, gasped when Cissy tugged his head back by the roots only to stare down at him in something akin to awe. It was a look Harry recognized. Some things never changed.
"That's funny, Potter," he said at long last. He smiled a little, the shadow of a dimple on one cheek. "Who's been teaching you how to do that?"
Harry had closed his eyes to keep from looking where he hadn't been told he could look, so his hearing took over, and he could picture each piece of clothing Draco divested himself of as he listened to the rustling of fabrics. The soft black jumper that generated static electricity as he tugged it over his head; it had a way of always making his fine hair stand on end. The way he tugged an arm into the t-shirt underneath and pulled it off in one motion with the other; the way his skin always goose-pimpled when it hit the air, his small pink nipples pebbling. The slide of the strap of his belt against the worn leather, and the thud as he shucked his trousers and underwear completely, followed by the step up of each foot as he stripped the socks from them.
actually catch something off fucking Greyback. All I'll say before I put my foot in my mouth is I'm passing on that he's sorry, and know that even though he's family, we're not having anything to do with him."
"'S nothing," Harry shrugged it off, snapping his mobile shut, though his heart always beat faster at the dial tone, something that he wished wouldn't happen, but secretly liked.
Draco tugged at the wrists of his sleeves. "Well, as far as I'm concerned, it was two years of fucking, but most people call that dating."
"Someone's about to be reamed out for 'borrowing' that karaoke machine," he said before planting a kiss to Hermione's forehead and slouching out the door.
The crack of air as molecules split apart and reassembled behind him signalled Ron's arrival by Apparition.
"Potter," he said. He just kept doing it, long fingers untangling his hair as they scraped wonderfully down his scalp.
The nurse checked the pager affixed to her hip, scowled. Jessica, her name was Jessica. Muggle, unaware that Malati's difficulty to remain in one placement for more than a couple of months had a lot more to do with the willful, wild magic inside her and less to do with having a delinquent or unmanageable personality.
him with a ferocity Harry recognized from the previous night, shortly before the wine bottle met the wall. The ensuing staring match was won by Harry, Draco looking down and away as a red weal appeared down the centre of his forehead.
Against his best efforts, weariness tinged Harry Potter's voice. The glossy black leather of the chair he sat in creaked under him as he leaned forwards, dipping his head as he tried to catch his press manager's eye.
—oh! Kreacher's watery brown eyes looked from Harry, then back to the pale face he loved, and he threw his gnarled fists in the air.
"Doesn't matter," Robards waved his executive assistant Barbara on, "Don't wait on my account, Babs." She gave Harry a sympathetic smile and turned from them with a demure, "Harry," and a smile in her kind blue eyes. Harry liked Barbara—she always delivered bad news first and purposefully lied to him about meeting start-times to curb his habit of running in late, flustered and in a bad temper with his superiors. Harry liked to think it was because his Christmas cards and French chocolates kept her satiated, but he knew she had something of an intergenerational pash for him. She was old enough to be his mother twice over, but that never stopped her from letting her gaze linger as she closed the door behind him.
"I'll do you one better," Harry muttered, pretending to be more exasperated than he felt. Draco did bring out the drama in him. He scrawled
"I dare you," Ron spoke slowly, eyes sweeping from Dean over the patch of lush grass of the meadow tucked behind the Burrow, and all the lounging bodies of their assembled friends, "to find the bottom of Seamus' bellybutton with your tongue."
Last in were Dean, and with him, Lee Jordan, who was working as a DJ at the WWN and quickly took over the playlist for the night, and Hannah Abbott, whom Harry hadn't seen since school, and was thrilled to learn would be taking Justin's position at Hogwarts within the month.
"So have you ever?" Draco said, eyes closed as Harry worked. He was good with his hands; he’d been told so numerous times before. He was less nervous when he was doing something—talking on its own felt too intimate.
It was like the street dropped out from underneath Harry's feet. He stepped back, sure that it would be backwards and into a pit a thousand feet down. There was no telling when the free-fall would end.
He went first to Draco's, but the flat was empty, warm and steaming. Then, Grimmauld, and just in case, the apothecary, which he knew to be closed for the day. Just in case—what? In case Draco was hanging around his old job site? After coming up empty, Harry realized he still had a terrible sense of what Draco did with his own time. Who he saw, where he actually went—these were generally blind spots, glaringly large now that he needed to know.
He could hardly believe that they were having such a prolonged discussion about the one person he could never broach in conversation with his friends.
"Well, I think pink suits you, Ted. Though, have you considered yellow, like a highlighter?" Teddy scrunched up his nose, shaking his head. "Noooo, silly," he said. "You're silly, Harry. I'm allowed pink because Dwaco's allowed pink cause he's a grown-up."
for my nausea," she said, covering her eyes with a hand. "And the lighting in here leaves something to be desired."
The first was a blind item from an unnamed source at Bagman's party, basically citing without naming him that he'd left the party early and staggering. The source was quoted as saying it was a well-known fact that he brushed his teeth with Blishens whisky in the mornings. This was a half-truth—he detested Blishens—but landed close enough to home that Victoria had warned him off being seen with so much as a single drink with supper through New Year's eve. This was not going to happen, as Harry continued his habit of drinking as much as it took to pass out any night that didn't involve Draco, but it didn't stop him from being sore about having to hide it slightly better than he had been.
"Kreacher is forever honoured to have a guest of young master Malfoy's distinction to serve. Ask for anything, and the house will provide, yes, now, Kreacher will leave Master and the Black-Malfoy heir to their business. Anything, ask for anything—" and before he could descend into full-blown hysteria, Kreacher Apparated away.
There was a sheen of sweat on her brow, which meant she'd been practising difficult magic behind that door. Worry panged inside of him. Feelings were cracking through—he was fast losing the control that nothingness granted.
As the long summer days grew shorter, he decided to drink in as much of regular life as possible, taking up all invitations that came his way. He forgot to drench the laptop in the Magic-B-Gone potion Tom sent along with it, and it promptly went up in sparks, convincing Kreacher that it, and all other Muggle technology, was cursed. With a good lacquer of the potion, the phone survived, a dark-grey clamshell with an M embossed on the front in blue, which Harry took great pains to hide from the house-elf's view. When he owled a few friends his newly minted cell-phone number, it was nothing short of shocking when Dean actually rang him up. They popped to the cinema to watch a long, rambling film about pirates that Dean considered beneath him, and Harry enjoyed more than he was willing to admit.
Harry angled a tight smile at his shoes. He wasn't supposed to be looking at Draco's face, damn it all.
Draco snorted but the look turned pained too quickly. He took a deep breath and the look washed away. "Very astute of you. I knew this was coming, it was part of the deal. Gloves," he said, looking vacantly out the window blurred by the day's downpour. "Won't have to wear them anymore."
"I'm not one to say 'Well then, my work here is done,' at least not very commonly, but perhaps we could cut down how often you come to talk to me? I'm not trying to get rid of you, mind you—if you find it helpful to come in and chat, we can continue to do that. But I don't think you need me now the same way you did, say, six months ago. What would you say to that?"
"Isn't it a bit dangerous to have spoken to scientists about the Death Eaters, and have it documented? Even if it's in terms Muggles don't know the full extent of, how did you...?"
He exhaled, tensing a fist to keep from reaching out and holding one of Draco's hands. He wanted to brush a thumb over his purpled knuckles and pull him close, but couldn't. Wouldn't overstep whatever barrier it was that had kept them apart for nearly a month.
Harry frowned—he’d been trained to notice things, and this seemed like an egregious lie to suddenly make up.
Harry was about to ask more about Draco’s abrupt appearance but he was on him in an instant, his mouth practically spicy with the mint of his gum, which Harry felt as his tongue roamed his mouth.
A lorry rumbled by, loose metal parts clanging loudly into the din. Crackling explosions went off to jeers in the park nearby, washing the room briefly in orange light. The Halloween ball seemed miles, years away now. Streamers, candlelight, and the pressure of performance. Harry rolled onto his side, pulled his hand away from Draco's. He needed to go home and find a little corner to hide out in until this passed.
Draco withdraws his hand from the cage. Harry lowers onto his forearms and Draco’s heart sings, knowing his good boy will be poised and ready for his master to play with him soon enough.
Harry took a deep breath and looked to his own hands. He had to be cautious now—to avoid letting sentimentality colour his thoughts. Clarity was required, and that meant absolutely no touching.
"This summer, you say," Pansy said, humming to herself. "Sounds about right, him leaving the house for his quarterly allotment of a good time."
Harry wished for the first time that he had use of his hands so that he could brace himself against the headboard, or touch himself, or touch
Harry pressed his thumbs into the hollows under Malfoy’s eyes and tugged skin thin like tissue paper. It crawled back into place.
"Look. The parts of you that are good are so fucking good—but this job, it's just one more thing. I'm not going to pretend that I haven't been cross with you about this, even when I'm also cross with myself. You don't
Most of their names came to him easily now—the common pastels of snapdragons, and the bi-coloured triumph of the Peruvian lily and the less dramatic but dead-useful ones, like the berries of St. John's Wort and fragile blossoms of Forget-Me-Nots. It was Draco's doing, fixing up the little plot gone to seed and turning it into something beautiful and useful, providing blossoms for the halls of the house and ingredients for his potions. He'd taught Harry the names of so many things in the natural world, and Harry had spent ages with him out here, gently encouraging the synapses in his brain to stretch and find those connections once again.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, fingers finding the outline of the bump left behind from his earlier collision. He wiped the hand on his trouser leg, unsure if there'd be blood at his fingertips.
“I can recuse myself,” Harry said, for her benefit, looking at Malfoy. Not a hair out of place, not a muscle on his face moved, yet his bent leg had started to bounce over the edge of the examination table as soon as Harry entered the room.
But it was the smart thing to do. He never did the smart thing, but Draco'd asked him to try, time and time again.
Draco didn't say anything as he slipped into the sheets beside Harry, handing him a phial of the potion they both needed. Harry necked half and watched as Draco took the other half dose, turning away from him as he pulled the duvet up to his neck.
He pretended it was because Draco looked better than he had in years. The short hair made him look younger, closer to his actual age. Thin, but no longer emaciated to the point that Harry scanned the obits for the
"Harry, hear me out. Ginny and I growing up, being the youngest, we saw all the things our older brothers did, and half the time, we didn't understand what they were up to, but sometimes we did. Charlie's had boyfriends and girlfriends—all fucking sorts. And he never trusted Bill or Percy or Fred or George with that, but we were younger, and we couldn't have been made to care, so he trusted us with that. It's just how it is for him, and I've never thought twice about it, about how that might make him any different than the rest of us. Or any lesser. Honest."
Harry's stomach constricted at the thought. He'd been studiously ignoring the brief letter from Ginny telling him he had to come back that Sunday for dinner, or Molly and Arthur would disown him, and her for not doing a good enough job in wrangling him. He'd been remiss not to tell them in the first place, knew it was cowardice to continue hiding out from them for so long.
"Not yet," Harry said. The moment felt precipitous, like they were on the edge of a cliff, and Harry hoped that Draco would hold his hand when they jumped.
"My mother calls me Ginevra, but most people call me Ginny, so we can start there," she said, then added with a threatening squint, "but my real friends get to call me Gin once we've traded embarrassments, so let's aim for that."
"That's suitable, thank you," Draco confirmed. His back was stiff and his tone was bored, the mask of wealthy indifference wielded like a shield. Harry didn't question the move, could tell from the glances they'd received when departing the airport and again in the lobby that they were conspicuous. Draco turned up the posh when tensions rose; Harry took the signal for what it was and kept his mouth shut, unpacked his bag and left it in the room on the right, paranoid enough to cast detection spells to ensure that the spaces weren't bugged.
Andromeda moved the empty plate before her away and smoothed her hands over the pattern of twisted English ivy on the tablecloth. She turned to answer her friend.
"That's not the point, though," Ron said, looking patronizingly at Harry. "It's clear as day that good old Grimmauld wants you and your mystery lover together, forever, and it's pulling out all the stops to make that happen. Now, for the love of god, will you tell us who he is. He's not, like, terribly old, is he?"
"Why wouldn't my word be good?" Harry's question fell into a room of silence. "Honestly? I'm mad for him, but I'm not mad, alright?" Both Ron and Hermione were unwilling to say out loud what they were thinking; that when it came to Draco, Harry's senses weren't to be trusted.
"Thank you, Kreacher," Harry said, and the ancient elf only shrugged as he shuffled away, muttering about the state of the pipes. Harry took a bracing sip and surveyed his day's work. Daisy yellow envelopes indicated mail that was Friendly & Familiar—friends and family only—and there was one of those, thick as his thumb. Emerald green was for Official Business—there was maybe a half-dozen of those, though they were all as wide as Harry's fist, the wax seals cracking under the pressure of their contents. No doubt invitations and well-wishes from ministers from England and beyond. He tackled the thinnest of the envelopes first, in glossy cherry red—Urgent Matters.
Maybe he really was everyone's type, Harry thought with a hot spike of an unknown emotion. He wanted it to be Anger, nice and pure and straightforward Anger, though he was reasonably sure it fell neatly into the Jealousy category.
Ron's lips tightened involuntarily, but he kept quiet. Harry continued, swiping at condensation gathering on his glass.
He removed it slightly to peer over at Malfoy, who shook his head, looking far too amused for Harry's liking.
You melt. His voice is chocolate. It's another plus of fucking him, making it go hoarse and hearing it on the radio and privately knowing.
Draco stopped breathing, blinked, in shock. He blinked quickly, those wondrous eyelashes fluttering, and as he opened his mouth to say something in response, Harry held a finger up, nearly brushing his lips.
"Shut up, no you're not," Ron shoved him by the shoulder and raised his hand, catching a server's eye and signalling for another round. "You're trying to get us to stop setting you up, but you don't have to lie about it."
"So, what this sounds like to me," he said carefully, "is that Lucius is breaking up with you. Officially. Is that it?"
Draco took a long drag and blew the smoke out his nostrils, looking not unlike a snow-white dragon stuck in human form.
anymore, either. He pressed the palm of his right hand against the solid bulge in Draco's black jeans and was rewarded with his eyelids flickering closed, a muffled sob escaping his throat.
"Hermione was good at starving because she's got willpower in spades. I don't think I'll ever know another person with that kind of strength." Draco sat still, face rapt with attention. Harry found himself pausing overly long, fighting to push each new sentence out. "Ron was awful with it, probably because he'd hardly been famished a day in his life."
"I'll talk to Victoria, alright? We won't use the front door of Grimmauld anymore, and you should take all this
It wasn't so different than what Harry thought it would feel like, but at the same time, it was distinctly more.
"That's alright, Harry, it's exciting! Also, I have news for you from the accountant for S.P.E.W. It looks like we're only a signature away from the trust being set up in your name—"
Harry snorts and stuffs a hand into his pocket to finger at the Galleons there. He flicks one with his thumb and Malfoy catches it out of the air.
Harry considered the question for too long of a pause for Draco's comfort, and Draco shook his head, murmuring "I’m sorry," as he rubbed his knuckles over the back of Harry's hand.
"I'm aware. I'm on the board," Harry smiled through gritted teeth as his friends made appreciative sounds. Harry turned to stare at Hermione, hoping that he was appropriately telegraphing
"Sure feels like it," Harry closed his eyes and was overtaken by a yawn. The spunk and lube were fast-drying on his prick and stomach, and he knew that a shower would be the only thing to rid him of the oily feeling completely. "Care to join me for a shower before bed?"
, turned the ball of hot energy in his belly into the recognizable pleasure of an orgasm, one that ripped through him so that he made sounds he couldn't control and curled up, torso taught as a strung bow as he spilt over Draco's fingers, his fist never slowing, refusing to stop until Harry pleaded with him to let go.
Draco's voice, so suddenly at his ear was what made Harry realize that his shoulders were bunched up as though magnetized to his earlobes. He dropped them, accepted the hug from the back Draco bestowed on him, glad to hear his assembled friends amusing themselves across the room as he took a stabilizing moment to breathe.
"I—I do," Harry stammered. He wiped his palms down his thighs, exhaled. "I was a git. I should have known better, and I'll do better. I'm not great with words, though, so if there's something I've missed, you'll have to let me know."
The thing about sex, though, was how it quietened the racing black thoughts in Harry's mind. It turned the dial on them down, and as Harry took Draco's cock into his mouth and closed his eyes in bliss at the salty taste of precome on his tongue, sucking til his cheeks hollowed, the taste alone was enough to shut the thoughts off completely.
"They're doing it on purpose," she said, tone beseeching Harry to feel for her. "These relationships are important to me." She sniffed, held a hand to her mouth as though on the verge of tears. "You can't possibly understand."
"Flattery will get you everywhere," Draco scoffed, turning to him. His gloss smelled like frosting, and Harry stole a kiss to taste it; him. "Ready?"
First, Kreacher was there. This wasn’t in and of itself ominous, as the elf split his time between the Hogwarts kitchens and the house. It was that he was on the edge of tears, a state Harry never once imagined he'd see him in.
The items in the bag were simple and not yet properly wrapped. No receipt, though Harry could tell by their weight and finishing that they weren't cheaply made.
No, not one pair of feet. Two—one in boots, the other in something cushioned. He could hear them both over the muted dance music pumped in through the speaker system. Tennis shoes. Trainers.
Draco would run a hand through his hair to make him shiver. Would plant a gentle kiss to the edge of his mouth, and say, "I think you do care, Potter," or, "You’ve got to pick, Potter, don’t keep us waiting all night."
it had been, how quick, and yet it had taken so, so long to drag it from him. Draco shut his eyes, a frown pulling at his forehead like the sound hurt to hear.
"Hey!" Xu held her wand aloft in the centre of the hallway, a sudden silence descending. "This is a public space, and we will have decency and decorum at all times, am I understood, Auror Weasley?"
The muscles in Harry’s arms and back started to burn as he held still, but he didn’t mind. It was incredible, just like that. Feeling the racing pulse of Draco’s heartbeat under the skin and around his cock.
"Sorry, what was it? I don't think I quite got it," Harry egged him on, laughing as he had stormed from the room.
Alex paused his enthusiastic clapping, fingers so straight that they curled back. "Have you ever seen your boyfriend in drag?"
"You're in a tough spot to be bargaining, now—for Christ's sake, Potter, would you put down your wand? Can't you see the adults are talking?" Pansy frowned at him until he lowered it, earning him a simpering smile from her. She turned back to Draco.
It was late, and his heart ached, and if there was a higher power they weren't listening to him, they had bigger fish to fry, because despite all his pleas, Draco hadn't woken up.
Harry pretended to peruse the robes turning slowly in the windows, walking the shop's perimeter at a snail's pace. He hadn't chosen anything to wear for himself in years, but he didn't mind looking. It was too hot to be dressed as he was, and his scalp itched from the combined heat and damp. It wasn't long before the bells above the door jingled once more as the customer left.
"You taste so good, I could lick you all fucking day," Draco ground out as he gripped Harry throbbing prick, barely moving his hand.
"No, he's not," Harry couldn't keep the emotion from his voice anymore. It wobbled and broke and he'd been crying soon if he wasn't careful, but he didn't care anymore. "He's infinitely better than that. Somehow, despite you both, he's a wonderful, caring person, and any parent should be so lucky as to have him as a son."
"And you?" Draco asked. He pulled Harry’s hands up from his lap and placed them, palms-up on the tabletop. The napkin he'd been toying with was tossed aside as Draco cupped Harry’s hands with his own. "Go on," he said.
"You said the words 'obsessed with you' right there, for the record," Malfoy smirked at him, a sea of teeth. "That's all I wanted."
Harry nodded like he believed her, which he categorically did not, and took her by the elbow to lead her back to the dance circle. He checked the time—twenty minutes before he'd start the process of trying to get them all to leave—
, with that look. Did you think I was avoiding this dinner?" Harry shrugged, garnering him a melodramatic gasp for the ages. "You absolute
The woman's mouth opened, and then she closed it. It was small, painted purple. Her lips pursed—something about him didn’t sit right with her.
"I was always Harry Potter to them, I think. There's this weird level of deference I get. It's unnerving—like I could feel everyone staring, all the time, but no one would look me in the eye in the halls." Harry pushed his glasses up as he rubbed at tired eyes. "They were all too intimidated to join me for lunch in the canteen if Ron wasn’t there."
." Draco exhaled heavily, smoothing his hair back to regain some composure. "I know for a fact that your number is always two higher than your partners know about while you're dating, what with all the cheating that ensues. I bet Luna thinks she's number eleven and you'll stop there, doesn't she?"
Harry was walking down the hall, a sour rush of saliva flooding his mouth like he'd be sick any second. Things were bad, but they could be worse. They’d get through this. He couldn't botch this meeting; he knew Draco could do this.
the most wonderful, was all hers, her favourite, and no one else in the world could do what Harry did to her.
"Could you do the splits when we were in school?" Harry fiddled with the corner of a pillowcase, though Draco saw directly through him.
"No, I finished at Eton seventh year and did my magical studies by correspondence. Bit silly, but it helped in the long run. I'm teaching Muggle studies now, over at Hogwarts. Youngest on faculty—well, it can be a bit of a bore."
"Draco hasn't been feeling good," Teddy said. Harry straightened up and looked over to Draco, sitting on the floor in leggings and an oversized t-shirt. His pink face and damp skin were signs that he'd only recently gone still.
It being Dean's birthday, he got to pick the club they went to. And it being Dean, the club ended up being an illegal rave at a place they had to enter through the alley to get into, navigating a thick crowd of smoking revellers only to have the word
"Go," Draco said, squeezing his hand and flashing a smile that was meant to be reassuring. Harry couldn't help but feel like it was put on, the overactive cheer of a person willing themselves to be alright, rather than a person experiencing the real thing, but he didn't want to push. He wasn’t one to judge; he couldn’t be.
"Don't do that," Draco snapped. He squeezed Harry's hand and pulled it close to his chest so that Harry could feel his heartbeat, a steady thump. "Of course it matters, and it hurts, and who gets in trouble if you finally admit it?"
"Of course I know that," Harry scoffed. He sat up and retreated, but the headboard stopped him from getting further away from this talk that was fast bringing up feelings he couldn't name. It hurt to even look at Draco.
Draco turned back to him just as another flash went off, his brow wrinkled behind the fat black Tom Ford sunglasses he so loved.
On his knees, head bobbing between Draco’s legs, there’s a moment when the bulbs in the track lighting of the kitchen flicker and pulse and he sucks off, head turning at the distraction.
Draco waited rather than prodding, and after a few false starts, Harry found the words he needed. He spoke them to his navel.
"Last one, Victoria, I promise," he muttered as he set the glass on the ledge behind him and tried to concentrate on the show.
His lips curled into a small smile as he flicked a look at Harry, then away. It was dangerous how normal he seemed even when basically inebriated. It worried Harry. It kind of scared him that Draco Malfoy was very good at many things and hiding in plain sight was one of them.
Harry hadn’t the heart to remind her that it was unlikely that they’d be swayed by empirical evidence; why ruin her fun? Seamus was in town for one night only, flying to Australia the Muggle way for work and in need of an overnight layover, and so Ron had decided to blend his birthday celebrations with the visit. He declared it a "proper lads night" and invited most of the men from their year at Hogwarts to the backyard of the Burrow for pre-drinks, though a healthy dose of magic mushrooms, Gillyweed and other low-grade psychedelics were added to the mix as soon as Luna arrived. The sky above their heads was melting from cobalt to inky indigo as lips loosened and a friendly game of Truth or Dare began to heat up.
