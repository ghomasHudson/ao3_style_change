Draco sighs before he can catch himself, cutting his eyes at his dinner companion.  "Why must you always..." he starts, before Harry cuts him off.
"It's fine," Harry says, face as smooth and unreadable as the marble of the pillar beside their table.  "It doesn't matter."
They arrive at the hotel, a huge sprawling palace named
"Don't worry about it.  That's fine," Harry says blandly.  Once again Draco sees a flicker of that strange expression from the hallway before it vanishes under the mask.  Harry looks... sad, and cold, and empty, the unfamiliar expression seeming utterly unlike anything that should live on a face that was born to be smiling and joyful, not this closed, sour mockery of itself.  He stirs, seeming to make an effort.  "The spa sounds good.  Maybe a massage.  It might help with..." he motions at his leg, clearly unwilling to even mention it.
?" he whispers angrily.  "What do you think I..."  Quick as a blink the disgust is gone, the anger is gone, and the bland public face is back, empty and mocking.  "If you want to go, I suppose we can."  Draco is horrified at himself.  Bad enough to suggest a temple, but he knows better than to bring up the subject of Harry's Parselmouth talent; even mentioning the skill in the abstract has been enough to set Harry off for years, ever since an attempt by Dark wizards to proclaim Harry (of all people) the new Dark Lord just because he had the gift of speaking to serpents.  Why would he even think of such a thing?
"Thank you," Draco says, over and over.  "Thank you, thank you."  Finally, even clearly-not-British Fouad realizes that 'thank you' in that tone means 'stop speaking' and does so.  Draco stumbles away to where Harry stands, looking oddly small and dejected, forlorn in the middle of the lobby, passes him a bracelet.  How have we come to this?, Draco wonders.  How did all this fire and light just turn to ashes?  "Come on, then," he says, leading his way to the lift.  Harry gives him a look he can't interpret, but nods, smiles as though nothing is wrong.  Together they walk to the lifts, alone.
broken.  The man I was isn't coming back, Draco.  This is all I am now."  His gesture is aimed at his leg, but comes up, waves dismissively at his body.  "This is what's left."  Thin lips twist now, disdain for himself, it's all far too much.
"We..." he chokes, awful words fighting to be born like a crow pecking its way out of his throat.  Younger Draco would have spoken them, hating and yet wanting to fight and knowing he was safe to do so, would have thrown harsh words down like a gauntlet in the middle of the room, a knight challenging another to duel to the death, words like swords clashing... but younger Draco had been silent for years, eroded away into pale, tired, old Draco, full of silent sorrows, fragile as rotted fabric.  He sits, waits, breathes, looks up to green eyes staring helplessly, turns the sword on himself.  "We don't talk any more, Harry.  I miss you."  Draco wonders if this is what suicide feels like... chip-chip-chipping away at yourself until there's nothing left but rawness.  "Mother of Night, I miss you so much."
"You..." Harry says, voice thick, and Draco suddenly holds him tighter.  Oh.  That's what that was.  Wetness slides down Harry's face, moistening Draco's cheek.  "You used to call me that all the time.  I missed it."
"It does, and I'm sorry, Harry.  I didn't mean to bring up..." he falters to a stop, takes a shuddering breath in, releases it, and tries not to tear up.   He has always hated crying, and he knows he is an ugly crier.  Truly he's never found that it serves much purpose.  You hurt, and you cry, and you feel worse, and whatever you cried over is still there, only now you have to face it snotty and blotchy and vaguely ill.  Worse yet, if he starts, he isn't sure he will be able to stop, and the image of himself crying and crying until his entire body has turned to water and flowed out through a disembodied set of tear ducts is silly enough to bring Draco back to himself.  He clears his throat.  "Anyway, I
"I..." Draco pauses, frantic to continue this moment of actual communication, clutches at something he remembers from a long-ago history lesson.  "There's a temple to Uadjet, the royal cobra, quite nearby, in the ruins of Buto; legends say that she still lives deep below it, despite being thousands of years old.  I've heard that they give free entrance to Parselmouths.  Would you like to...?" he trails off at the glare from across the table, worrying that his undesired dessert might scorch from the expression on Harry's face.
do this, he worries.  I'm only one sentence into this conversation, and I'm already one sentence too far.  Inhale, exhale, ignoring the pain that feels almost physical, something being torn bodily from him, an organ he can't spare pulled out and shown to jeering crowds.
, you berk."  He leans in and presses a kiss to the graying temple, stopping to inhale the familiar scent that has meant safety, comfort, love for more than twenty years.  There is no release of tension in the wiry body he holds but at least that smell hasn't changed.
"Sorry," Harry says quickly, tiny tells and inflections gleaned over the decades telling Draco that sorry is the last thing he is.  "Go on, you were saying?"
"Why you invited me on this trip."  That look is back, the look he's never seen on Harry's face before.  It's even worse in here, it's a sad, closed look, the sort of look you see on faces at funerals and wakes, looking at Draco as though he were already dead.
"I'm fine," Harry says shortly.  He's far from fine, Draco can tell.
It’s something he has to convince himself of, but he is.
“You’re not uncomfortable with having him here?”
to befriend Potter, just as he hadn’t befriended England’s beloved Cedric Diggory during his stellar first season with the Chudley Cannons.  That had turned out to be a good decision when Diggory’s sophomore slump hit hard and he only caught ten Snitches throughout the entire season.  Draco still remembers Lucius’s embarrassment at the news, after having encouraged Draco to befriend Diggory.
we were in fourth.  It’s not exactly reassuring to be in ninth, is it?”
“Nothing,” Dobri says morosely.  “Don’t worry about me.  Leave me alone, let me die.”
This Draco is tired – tired because he can’t sleep, tired because he can’t breathe, tired because he’s fighting a war that shouldn’t be his – and if fatigue comes in waves, then this Draco has drowned time and time again.)
Blaise is, for once in his life, stone-faced. He’s soothingly rubbing a worried Oliver’s back, and to anyone else, he would have seemed totally nonchalant, but Draco knows his best friend better; he knows to read into the subtle shaking of his hands and the way he slouches just so. He knows that, despite the healer’s reassurances that Harry is going to be fine, Blaise is afraid.
Blaise helps Draco to his feet, steadying him when he sways and smoothing his hair to calm down. Draco decides he’s been stupid to have so underappreciated his friends this way, because he hasn’t shown them any genuine gratitude in all the time that they’ve known each other, and now it’s too late.
Anyway, what he still remembers is the look on Lucius’s face when Draco tore the broom out of the packaging, swung one leg over it, and flew right off.  Lucius had never looked so proud of him before, and he hasn’t looked so proud of him since then.
Draco reaches out tentatively until they’re touching, and when he doesn’t violently jerk away Blaise thinks it’s like the knife has cut so far through the tension they may as well have shoved it in a blender and watched it dissolve.
“Harry Potter is dead!”
When his feet find the ground, he finds himself faced with his best friend under a mountain of blankets on the sofa, watching his charmed television and eating ice cream out of a massive tub.
, a younger Draco might have said. This one doesn’t.
The rest of the team shows up just as Draco is starting to sweat, so he and Zo touch back down.  The Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, take turns ruffling Draco’s hair just to see him make faces at them, while Nikola goes right to Zo for a hug like the team puppy he is.  Bogomil is the last to come out of the locker room, and his expression turns a little forlorn when he sees them.  Volkov and Vulchanov glance at each other.
Draco jumps, nearly dropping the drinks as he swivels around, but it’s only Harry. “I, uh – ”
It’s not the same, and it hurts because no matter what he’s done in the past he’s always had a home to return to. Now, for having been too scared to stand up for what he believed in, for having been too weak to fight what he knew was wrong, home is something Draco just doesn’t have anymore.
“Morning, Draco,” Zograf says.  “You’re here early.”
“Let me love you, Draco,” Harry says, and it’s like he’s opening the door to how Draco used to be, to how Draco could be again.
The sincerity in his voice is almost foreign. Draco grew up on disguises, on masks, on thinly veiled lies hiding dark truths, and Harry never fails to surprise him one way or another with no more than honest words and wide eyes.
“Does she still hate me?” he asks.
“He – he’s dead,” Draco cries. “I saw him.”
“Nice to see you too,” Dobri grumbles.  “Can you scoot over?  I’m trying to watch
“Yeah,” he says. “Blaise really likes him.”
He reaches for the ice cream that Draco’s pulled out of reach, looking very pitiful, and Draco has no choice but to hand it to him.  He can’t speak on Bogomil’s behalf and he doesn’t know if Bogomil has even confided in anyone, since he only ever really talks to Zo anyway, so there’s not much he can do.
Draco freezes, hands stiffening over the clothes he’s packing into his trunk; Marcus’s words are slurred. “I’m moving out,” he manages. “I’m sorry about the rent. At least you get extra living space, though? It’ll be nice, I guess, since this place is kind of cramped and all.”
Luckily, the press eventually starts to ease off of Krum, who has apparently settled down somewhere in Norway doing who knows what.  That kind of anonymity sounds like a dream some days, with journalists scrutinizing every play and Lucius pushing harder than ever for Draco to befriend Potter.  Draco doesn’t
As expected, Blaise says, “Draco, I love you, but that is complete bullshit.”
(He hears Hagrid’s roar of “WHERE’S HARRY?” and isn’t sure if his world is righting itself or crumbling to his feet.)
that England is in third,” Dobri says, which is true.  Still, Draco would rather die than agree to praise Potter.  “It’s not like the game’s long enough for him to make that many saves, anyway, with how quick Potter catches the Snitch.  Wood played in ‘98 too and England didn’t do nearly as well, because Blythe Parkin sucked.”
“Yeah,” Draco says.  “The team’s got to step up, though.  Even with Potter, England’s in fourth.”
Draco laughs, and it’s a wet sound, full of relief and pain and something he can’t quite name. “Is that a promise?”
article?” is how he greets Draco as they walk out to the Pitch for practice.  He doesn’t wait for Draco to answer, because they both know Draco doesn’t read
Draco is just starting to feel good about the match when he spots the Snitch floating just behind Potter.  It’s close enough to Potter that if he spots it now, Draco has no chance of reaching it first, but Potter doesn’t seem to have noticed it yet.  But maybe…
“Really, child, is all this necessary…”  He trails off when he opens the box.  Draco watches him very carefully, trying to read his expression, but it remains blank.  Severus doesn’t seem to know how to react.  “What is this?”
“He’s really cute,” Blaise says, plowing on like Draco hadn’t said anything. “And he’s really sweet and witty and – and absolutely
It somehow worsens when Wood offers Zo a polite nod as the announcer rambles off their lines.  Potter smiles at Draco as the Captains shake hands, and Draco tries not to glower back, and then the ref starts the game.
The risks Harry has to take to be an Auror suddenly seem so much more real, as if Draco hasn’t quite understood them until he saw Harry looking like death. There’s an overwhelming urge in the hollows of Draco’s chest to touch him, to hold him, to protect him from everything bad in the world, although he has no way of doing so.
For a minute, nothing happens; then Draco jerks sharply and lets out a whimper before relaxing, trembling and burying his face in Blaise’s shoulder. “You okay?” Blaise asks urgently, patting his cheek. “Do you remember what happened?”
Potter is arrogant and reckless, clearly having grown overly used to winning and seeing adoring fans clamor for his attention.  He seems to speak without thinking for a moment about the consequences of his words despite being firmly in the public eye.  Draco can’t believe so many people have been charmed by such a bumbling idiot with no courtesy or manners whatsoever.
He trails off.  Draco scratches at his scalp, very gently.
Draco nods, pulling off his soaked jacket. Sky pours vehemently from the sky in what may as well have been buckets, and his teeth are chattering. Marcus is violent when he’s drunk, and Draco would rather run away a million times than be on the receiving end of it.
, he wants to say.
hair looks like sex.  If you wanted to fawn over someone, you’ve been overlooking the most suitable candidate for years now.”  Draco waggles his eyebrows.  “Unless, of course, you’ve been too busy ogling our darling Bogo—”
The first few months after the war are admittedly some of the hardest of Draco’s life. Gregory and Pansy never reply to the letters he sends them, although he knows they aren’t in Azkaban because their names aren’t included in the
Looking back later, it won’t be clear why this moment is so significant, but Potter has always been able to get Draco to react in ways no one else can.
Draco raises a brow. “Okay.”
St. Mungo’s is a place Draco tries to avoid going to at all costs, but he supposes he’ll make an exception for Harry.
And Diggory never got back into professional Quidditch or even coaching.  There are rumors that Diggory is working for the Ministry of Magic these days, but Lucius had stopped talking about him once his Quidditch career came to a close, so Draco doesn’t hear about him often.
“I certainly hope not,” Draco says.  “Thank you for telling me.  I’ll try to get Dobri to tell me what happened.”
Malfoy Manor is too lonely with his father in Azkaban and his mother gone – although maybe Draco is less bothered by being alone and more by the memories of countless men dressed in black robes sitting at his dining room table, by the sight tattooed in his mind of his mother hanging from a noose in the middle of the ceiling – and Draco returns only to remain for less than a month before he sells the Manor and moves into a much smaller flat with an old classmate.
“Morning,” Draco says cheerfully.
Narcissa had been somewhat hesitant about sending him to Durmstrang, for two reasons: that it was so far from home, and that she didn’t particularly want him learning dark magic.  But Lucius was decidedly not a fan of Dumbledore and had no qualms about setting Draco up for a formal education in subjects from which Hogwarts would rather run.  Truthfully, Draco thought blood magic and dueling sounded rather interesting, much to his mother’s chagrin.
“You mean ‘impractical’,” Severus says.  “I assure you I am quite proficient at the
All the same, Krum hadn’t been the only one to retire after Bulgaria’s devastating loss in the 2002 Cup finals.  While most of the new players haven’t been met with half as much criticism as Draco has, there’s still a tremendous pressure on the team as a whole to outperform the last team.  It certainly doesn’t help that a significant portion of the team, including Draco, was freshly and hastily signed right after the Cup.  The vets are all kind and helpful, but the fans are skeptical and will probably keep writing their suspicious articles until the rookies prove themselves.
That summer, Draco celebrates his eighteenth birthday on Blaise’s couch, and if all they do is get drunk off old Firewhiskey and fall asleep under a shared blanket, he doesn’t complain.
“Is everything okay?”
“What are you waiting for, a written invitation?” Draco asks, and kisses him.
Coach Becker and Bogomil’s conversation abruptly cuts off.  Draco hadn’t meant to be speak loudly enough for them to hear him, but Dobri’s completely mortified expression makes him unable to feel bad about it at all, and Bogomil’s entire face is bright red.
Harry kisses his forehead, cards a hand through his hair, and Draco is surprised when it offers the comfort it intends to. “You never did.”
“Not your fault,” the big, bumbling boy grunts out. “Vince started the fire. He was dumb.”
It’s true. Blaise can’t keep the smile off his face whenever he talks about Oliver, which he does a lot; Draco thinks he knows more about Oliver from Blaise than from Oliver himself.
“I’m not,” he mumbles. “I’m not a good person. I know you remember what I was like in school.”
Draco makes a face at him.  “I would rather suck Bogomil’s dick than call Potter attractive.”
“Here again,” Severus drawls at the sight of Draco at his doorstep.  “I suppose hoping for mercy this year would have been too optimistic.”
echoing in his ears, an
Draco refuses to acknowledge the jab at how he used to gel his hair back until it was plastered to his scalp in an admittedly uncanny impression of the layers of an onion.  “I was not
“You kissed him and ran away?” Draco asks.
“Well, the Welch Beaters haven’t exactly been gentle,” Dobri says drily. “But it’s more pressure on the Seekers now, isn’t it?  Obviously it’s always been, but Potter’s put England in a great spot.”
Bulgaria is not fond of Draco.  Well, the city of Vratsa is, because he Captained the Vratsa Vultures to win the European Cup in his last year in regionals, but things changed once he made it onto the Bulgarian National team.  Despite his killer performance in regionals, he doesn’t hold a candle to Viktor Krum, and Bulgaria had loved Krum more than anything.  Even after Krum’s objectively lackluster performance in his last game—losing the Snitch to the speedy new Egyptian Seeker—Draco seemed to be held to a standard of perfection, or close to it.  Of course, Draco has never even come close.
“I’m sure,” Draco agrees.  “But it’s bothering you.  I want to help.”
“Overslept, more like,” Niko chirps, and just like that the lighthearted air is back.
“Something happened between them, then?” Draco guesses.
“Why would you encourage them?” Harry asks, and the tension dissipates with Draco’s laugh as they go back to the living room.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. There’s something in his voice that Draco doesn’t recognize, something he’s never heard before. “I didn’t think it… I’m sorry.”
Fortunately for England, Wood seems to be better by the next game, and they have a winning streak of eight games before their next loss.  Bulgaria, on the other hand, wins six of their next nine games.  That puts England in third in the division and Bulgaria in sixth.  Senegal is first in the division and second in line for Cup favorite, and with their eighteen wins in twenty games, Draco has no delusions that Bulgaria will somehow come out on top.
“I’m just going to Floo call him,” Blaise says placatingly. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Anyway, Draco’s childhood dream has been more or less fulfilled: Dobri also plays on the Bulgarian National team, as a Chaser, which means they spend almost every waking moment together.  At first glance, this is a good thing.  Dobri is a skilled duelist, and a passable potioneer, and a three-time pick for
“WHAT A GOAL BY NIKOLA VASSILEVA!” the announcer crows.  “And a valiant effort by Oliver Wood, but he was just too slow!”
Blaise’s expression is too innocent for what he’s suggesting. Draco laughs; he doesn’t think he’s been as at ease in years as he is now. He doesn’t think he’s laughed nearly as much, either, and he has no idea where he would be without Blaise. “Okay. Let’s drink.”
“You like him, don’t you?” Blaise asks. “Harry?”
Blaise can imagine why, and he wants to throttle Marcus Flint for it.
“I’m afraid so,” Draco says.  He holds up his perfectly wrapped package, offering a teasing smile.  “I brought you a gift.”
Practice is strange: Bogomil is quieter than ever and Dobri doesn’t joke around as much as he usually does.  Draco hasn’t told anyone what Dobri confessed to him, but he does ask Zo if Bogomil had told him anything.  If Zo doesn’t know, then no one else on the team does—and he doesn’t, so Draco figures Bogomil just hasn’t told anyone.  It doesn’t seem like either Bogomil or Dobri are going to try and talk it out any time soon, but there are more important things to worry about.
Now is too late for a lot of things, though, with Crabbe dead and the survival of both Blaise and Gregory uncertain, and Draco thinks regret is cold as it settles heavily in his chest.
Blaise sighs and runs a hand through Draco’s hair as the latter dissolves into hysterical sobs. “Look, Draco, I’m going to ask Potter to come over, alright? Will you believe me then?”
Potter shrugs; a curse is on the tip of Blaise’s tongue before the savior extends his hand like it’s a peace offering. “You can touch me, if it’ll help.”
“You haven’t,” Draco says.
“No one’s going to kill you,” Blaise says, swallowing, pulling him into a tight embrace. “You’re okay, I promise. You-Know-Who is gone.”
,” Potter mutters, waving vaguely in Marcus’s direction. The brute crumples to the floor with a thud. Draco hears himself let out a startled squeak, and Potter turns back to look at him.
Draco doesn’t, but Blaise seems to, reaching out to shake Oliver’s hand. “Of course. Blaise Zabini.”
“That’s the spirit,” Becker says.  She’s looking at him like she agrees that he needs the extra practice, but is too nice to say it.  Whatever.  “Did you have a good holiday?”
“Are you ready?” Blaise asks.
Draco deflates. “I know.”
“Blaise,” he chokes out through the noise. How can he be suffocating like this when there are no walls to close in on him? “Blaise, I can’t – I can’t breathe, let’s get out of here,
“What?” he says.  “Did you want me to hang it up here when I spend most of my time at Hogwarts, as you were quick to point out?”
, but the first in a real game—you were there, Severus, although I don’t know if you remember…”
“You died,” Draco says almost accusingly despite the tremor in his voice. “He – he killed you.”
Of course, Harry Potter had skipped everything—he’d never played in regionals and he never had to try out for a team.  He had famously been recruited right out of Hogwarts to start playing on the English National team with no experience outside of Hogwarts, and of course he’s been nearly as good as Krum ever since.  But even before his skills came to light, he had been welcomed with such open arms that Draco thought he could see some English shoulders pop out of place.  Even Krum had encountered some difficulty when he was recruited during his sixth year at Durmstrang.
“Wales will be angry on Sunday then,” Draco says.
Marcus’s glare is intense enough that Draco looks away although it’s not directed at him. Blaise doesn’t even flinch.
Neither of them seem to have anything to say after that.  Draco would be content to stand and stew in the awkward tension forever, but the other players arrive shortly afterward and Coach Becker announces the start of practice.  Dobri spends the entirety of practice glaring at Draco and avoiding Bogomil as much as possible.
“Don’t be.” Draco tugs his shirt back down and looks away. “I deserve it.”
Harry and Blaise, Draco thinks, are too good to him, and he doesn’t deserve them, but he’s not going to question it. Surely once they realize they’re wasting their time with him, they’ll leave; he shouldn’t encourage them to do so if they haven’t thought of it themselves.
“You two are practically attached at the hip,” Volkov says.  Bogomil visibly tenses, which does not go unnoticed by the team.
“Have you seen the
“I almost lost you,” he chokes out instead, grasping at Harry’s hand, which thankfully squeezes back. “I – I don't know what I would’ve done. I don’t know how to live without you.”
that repeats itself in his head – and his stomach drops when he realizes that Crabbe is nowhere in sight.
Bogomil gets tripped up by Keaton Flitney, who spends less time chasing the Quaffle than he does sitting in the penalty box, and then Dobri nearly runs Flitney into the stands.  That leaves Niko free to steal the Quaffle, and then suddenly Potter’s taking a nosedive toward the hoops.  Draco follows him without even thinking about it, trying to spot the Snitch, extending his hand as if it’ll push his broom faster
“I’m only joking,” Zo says with a contradictory waggle of his eyebrows.  “Would you want to practice with me, Draco, or would you rather fly alone?  Olivia and I were just finishing up.”
“He beat you!” a voice yells from within the crowd; Draco twists sharply in his friend’s grip to see Ronald Weasley, red-faced and clearly enraged, trying to pull away from his brothers’ grips on his arms to charge at Voldemort but not quite managing to before more shouts erupt from all of the Light side. Draco thinks he’s going to be sick.
Draco is never going to be sure of what exactly happens during the Final Battle, but he does have a vague idea.
Draco nods, redirecting his gaze to the ground. “I know.”
Draco doesn’t remember anything of the battle after that.
“Paisi’s got it now, he passes to Bogomil Levski—he’s leading Bulgaria in goals this season, on pace to outscore his father Alexie Levski’s last season—neat slide there, right between Withey and Choudry—LEVSKI SHOOTS—BLOCKED BY OLIVER WOOD!  That’s one shot on goal from Bogomil Levski, but no points!”
Blaise lets out a bark of laughter. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”
Then they play Wales and win by a single goal, since the Snitch has yet to be caught after the four-hour cap; they lose in the rematch thanks to an early catch by the Welsh Seeker.  England just barely beats Egypt and loses the rematch, in which Oliver Wood is clearly playing through a cold and spends much of the game a little slower than usual.  He’s visibly sicker in their next game, in which they lose spectacularly to Austria, and is replaced for the rematch.  Draco can’t blame him for trying to play through his illness—the backup Keeper is significantly worse, and they lose again.
Home, for Draco, has always been his loving mother and green and silver and Hogwarts and the sight of too much food on the dinner table. Perhaps it’s only a concept constructed in his head, but it’s always been there, and it has nothing to do with thin blankets and cold sneers and Marcus Flint.
“Good,” Bogomil says.
Bulgaria plays England for the first time in late April.  Harry Potter looks right at home even at the Sofia Pitch, which is annoying.  The last time England played here, they had lost, albeit to Krum’s team.  Draco doesn’t even want to think about it—he’s read the articles predicting scores and offering betting odds, and it’s not looking too hot for Bulgaria.  Without Krum, their odds against this faster and more experienced team are fairly slim.
Draco hesitates, but he nods. “Yeah.”
But Potter seems to have lost all interest in the conversation, because he’s finally looked over at Draco and is now staring openly at him with an unreadable expression.  Draco raises his eyebrows, daring him to speak.  The rest of the Quidditch players are making their way past them to the locker room now, and Draco catches a glimpse of the aforementioned Cedric Diggory, the winner of the last Triwizard Tournament, who Potter had beaten to the Snitch in all their games at Hogwarts.  Sports papers and fashion magazines alike had praised Potter thoroughly in the months after Diggory’s victory, which no doubt gave a boost to his already overinflated ego.
“It’d be unfortunate if I had the same taste as a plebeian like you.”
He abruptly shuts his mouth; he’s rambling, and he shouldn’t be, Malfoys don’t ramble. Marcus scoffs.
With England’s lead at a much shakier 10 points, Bulgaria’s got its confidence back.  The Chasers manage five more goals, three of which are Bogomil’s, and Zo blocks all but two shots so that by the end of the first hour, Bulgaria is leading 90-60.
Draco hasn’t thought about Granger in years, and he’s surprised to find that his memory of her hasn’t filled in the slightest; he remembers everything about her from her bushy brown hair to the periwinkle dress she wore to the Yule Ball. No matter how hard he tries, he hasn’t been able to forget much of anything about Hogwarts.
“It’s not thanks to
“I would be inclined to agree with you, Mr. Potter, if I were not personally privy to the terrible maintenance of your broom,” Madam Hooch says.  She smiles at him despite her scolding.  “Your victory has nothing to do with your broom.  I must advise you to be more careful with your equipment…”
“You wouldn’t believe how tempting that is,” Draco says, “but no.”
It’s always Harry he seems to be making exceptions for, though, so he isn’t surprised.
“What do you want me to do, proclaim my love for him from the rooftops?”
Then they’re landing, sliding ungracefully off their broomsticks, and Draco watches the Golden Trio throw something back into the fire as he coughs his lungs out. His throat clogs up and his vision blurs so badly he can’t see anything for what might be a minute or an hour – he doesn’t know; he can’t tell the difference – and when he can finally blink himself back to reality, the Gryffindors are gone. Goyle is in front of him, carefully checking him over for injuries and asking him if he’s alright.
“YEAH, EDDY!” Potter screams as Zo tosses the Quaffle to Bogomil, looking murderous.
“Harry Potter is d-dead,” Draco hears himself say, although he can’t quite register the fact that it’s from his own mouth. “The Dark Lord won, he – he’s going to kill me, Blaise – ”
“Like hell you’re moving out,” he says. “We decided to split the money, you piece of shit. You don’t get to just opt out.”
.  “England beat Wales 150-nil this past weekend.  Potter caught the Snitch before the first play was even made.”
“I hate to cut this reunion short, but we don’t have all day.” Potter’s tone all but screams finality, and a sharp flick of his wrist sends the rest of Draco’s belongings flying into his trunk, which zips itself up neatly. “Have a nice life, Flint.”
That is, the entirety of the Wizarding World with the exception of Draco himself.
“It’s stupid,” he says.
Draco looks up at Potter and away again. “Yes,” he says, leaning back into Blaise’s body. “Thank you.”
Dobri exhales heavily in an amused sort of way, but doesn’t say anything.
Home is with Harry.)
Practice goes well, considering they’re a Chaser short and no one’s flying quite as well as they were before the holidays.  Becker makes them run drills until they’re all sweating profusely even in the dead of winter—Draco regrets coming early with every inch of his being, while Zo still looks more or less unfazed as usual—and plays them against each other afterward.  The Beaters keep the energy high and Niko jokes around the whole time, even without Dobri who usually joins him, so the atmosphere is generally pleasant.
.  Draco had known this already, but they seem quicker in person somehow.  They get possession of the Quaffle first and then they’re off.
“That’s nice, Blaise.”
“I wasn’t.”
Draco doesn’t think he can answer honestly without his voice cracking like a little second-year, and he pulls up his shirt. The jagged white lines against his flesh say what he knows he can’t, and Harry’s calloused hands are gentle when they touch his skin.
article about Potter, and he can tell Dobri is thinking the same thing, because he immediately flushes just as brightly as Bogomil.  “Good,” he says weakly.  “How was yours?”
Even now, Potter barely looks at Draco as he lands gracefully near him and Madam Hooch.  He grins widely and holds the Snitch high for them to see.
“Watch your language, shithead,” Blaise murmurs. Potter is already kneeling down, observing Draco with concern clear on his face; the latter shrinks back in Blaise’s hold.
They get fucking creamed by Egypt, both in the next day’s game and in the rematch a week later.  Despite Krum’s words, it fucking sucks.
Blaise almost expects Draco wrinkle his nose and lift his chin and say that he doesn’t
Dobri gives him a pointed look.  “He’s
“I did, yeah,” Draco says.  “Mum asked after you, Zo.”
“That doesn’t mean anything.”
“Anyway, you didn’t get hot until fifth year,” Dobri says.  “You looked like a toothpick with onion hair until you hit puberty.  And you were too pasty.”
It had once been Draco’s dream to play Quidditch professionally with his best friend, Dobroslav Paisi.  Dobri was born and raised in Bulgaria, and the youngest of four brothers who had all attended Durmstrang.  Draco and Dobri had played Quidditch recreationally at Durmstrang, and in their younger years, they’d even gotten to play with Krum on occasion.
“What do you think you’re doing?”
The thought of this must put a sour expression on Draco’s face, because Potter flushes.
“ – may have altered his memory to convince him the war ended differently. I can’t imagine why, but it’s a possibility.”
Zograf grins.  “Did she now?”
“Cedric nearly beat me to it that time,” he says casually.  “I reckon it was our brooms that edged us out…”
“Yes, Potter, that would be wonderful,” Blaise shoots back, gritting his teeth. “Could you just come over? Please? He’s not doing so great.”
“Well?”
and throwing up hasty shields when he doesn’t have time to get away. He doesn’t know if it’s fear or adrenaline running through his veins, but it keeps him moving as if he’ll combust if he stills, as if he’ll die if he stops fighting for even just one second –
He smiles at them, but it doesn’t even come close to reaching his eyes.  Draco sees Niko frown and open his mouth to say something before Zo elbows him.  The Beaters share another glance.
“I can’t – ” Draco is shaking. “Blaise, I – I can’t – Marcus – ”
“C-Crabbe,” Draco hears himself choke out, hiccuping; he thinks he might throw up. “Crabbe is gone, it’s – it’s my fault, it’s all my fault and I didn’t mean for anyone to get hurt or d-die and I’m so
“He’s drunk again?” Blaise asks when Draco shows up at his doorstep yet again, shivering and dripping wet. It might be a sign that
is fake.  He sticks out his right hand.  “It’s nice to meet you, Draco.”
“I know,” Draco says, and he does. What he doesn’t add is that that doesn’t make it hurt any less, not when he still sees Harry this way, because Blaise and Oliver could never understand how in his mind’s eye he can see Harry’s blood spilled across the smooth plains of a flat blade, and they could never understand how it feels.
England’s Chasers are
Everyone looks at Draco, who puts his hands up.  “Why is everyone looking at me?”
“Just open it,” Draco says, grinning, and watches as Severus unwraps the package with a wave of his wand.  He rolls his eyes at the fancy black box under the wrapping paper.
“Do you still have scars, Draco?” Harry asks quietly. “From when I cursed you in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom?”
Blaise doesn’t know if the full effect of his glare is conveyed through the fireplace, but Potter sighs and gets up regardless. Blaise pulls out of the fire and turns back to Draco, who’s still sobbing and now has his face buried in his hands. Blaise’s heart twists.
“No need for dramatics, boy,” Severus snaps, seemingly having found his voice.  “I suppose you’re giving this to me now because you’re on the national team now?”
“Right, well,” Draco says.  Severus’s lack of reaction makes him nervous.  “I remember I had been really nervous before the game, and Father had promised to be there but he couldn’t make it and Madam Hooch was busy at Hogwarts.  And I know it was just rec Quidditch and it wasn’t a big deal at all, but Severus, when I saw that you were there, I—”
“At least Parkin was sexy,” Draco says, mostly just to have something to say.
Draco forgets to breathe, whirling around in an instinctive search for the voice. His limbs turn to jelly but Blaise is still there, grabbing him by the shoulders to right him before he can fall, easily keeping him on his feet, but he doesn’t register any of it.
The announcer seems excited about it: “No, it seems that Harry Potter hasn’t seen the Snitch after all!  He’s a brilliant flier, as we all know, but Bulgaria might be the worst team to play the Wronski Feint against, with Krum’s fondness for it.  And Draco Malfoy seems to have come out of it unscathed—Paisi’s got the puck, he’s heading straight down the pitch—barely dodged Choudry’s Bludger, he shoots—SAVED!  Flitney’s got the rebound, he sends a long pass to Vosper—Vosper shoots—SCORES!  EDRIC VOSPER OPENS THE SCORING!”
“He can do whatever the fuck he wants,” Blaise chimes in, glaring; Draco relaxes, immensely glad that, for all his arguing, he’d let Blaise and Potter come with him to get his things from his and Marcus’s flat. “He doesn’t have to listen to you.”
There are three moments Draco will never forget.
He leans in closer so that their foreheads are touching, their lips barely brushing against each other’s, so that Draco could count Harry’s eyelashes if he tried.
“Potter!”
Still, Bogomil is even quieter than usual, which is saying something.  When practice ends, he’s the first one in the locker room and he’s gone before Draco’s out of the shower.  Zo is also conspicuously absent, which Draco takes to mean that he’s gone to talk with Bogomil.
“A sexy dumpster fire,” Dobri sighs.  Then, at Draco’s disgusted look, he adds, “What?  Did you read this morning’s article?  They said his hair looks like sex itself.”
Winter is cold. Draco supposes he should like it, as most Slytherins do, but this year feels worse than others have. Perhaps it’s just the icy feeling of abandonment in his chest, he thinks, because this winter he doesn’t have anyone to sidle up to to keep warm or money for drinks that ignite something inside him or even a home to cozy up in.
“I really like him, Draco.”
Blaise sighs. “For Merlin’s sake, Draco, I’ve seen how you look at him. He’s into you too, in case you were wondering.”
Draco nods shyly.  “I haven’t been able to come home much this season, and with the way Qualifiers are set up that’s unlikely to change until after the Cup, or at least for as long as Bulgaria is still in the running.  I’ll be in England for holidays, of course, and my parents may want to see me for certain occasions, but I don’t know how much time I’ll be able to spend here.  Especially with you at Hogwarts most of the year, so I can’t just Apparate to see you.  And I know you say you don’t miss me, Severus, but I wanted to give you something to—to remind you of me.”  It sounds so juvenile when he says it out loud.  “I don’t know, it’s stupid, I just thought…”
Since the end of the war, he’s had a hard time with strangers, but Harry has been nothing but kind to him and Blaise is obviously interested in Oliver; the least Draco can do is try and get along with him.
“Okay,” Blaise says, wrapping long fingers around his wrist and tugging gently, “Draco, come on, let’s get you inside.”
“Nothing,” Draco says.
“I didn’t mean to scare you, I’m sorry,” Harry says, smiling apologetically before reaching over to help him with the bottles of Firewhiskey. “Listen, I know I should’ve ran this whole thing by you first, but Oliver and I have been talking recently and… you know. He and Blaise have been single for far too long.”
“I was terribly undecided about what to get you this year,” Draco says conversationally as he plops down on the couch without invitation.  Severus eyes him warily and sits at the opposite end.  “After the watch last year, I didn’t know what better I could find for you…”
“Hawksworth is first to the Quaffle, now to Edric Vosper—we saw a great performance from him against France.  Nicely dodging Ivan Volkov’s Bludger—oh, Vassileva’s got it!  He passes to Paisi, and—back to Vosper on a sloppy turnover by Paisi—”
“This is Draco,” Harry goes on, gesturing at him, and Oliver barely even glances at him before offering a halfhearted
“I’m going to check for a memory charm,” Potter says to Blaise. “Someone – ”
had published a lengthy article the next day gushing over the newly muscled build of the Gryffindor Seeker, then-fifth-year Potter who had been discussed sparingly in previous years for his speed, but had suddenly skyrocketed to fame over the summer after becoming obnoxiously fit.  To make matters worse, he’s only gotten more fit since then, and there’s no real way for Draco to say he somehow still doesn’t think Harry Potter is super hot without sounding either crazy or blind.  He goes with, “His hair looks like a dumpster fire.”
“Alright there, Draco?” Potter asks in a voice that, to anyone else, could have been gentle. With their history, though, Draco can’t imagine Potter ever being that way with him; he doesn’t deserve it.
If it weren’t for Dobri, Draco probably would have ended up playing for England or doing something else entirely.  It’s a lucky thing—with Harry Potter as England’s Seeker, Draco never would have made it onto the national team.  He would have been stuck playing in the minor leagues forever.
And maybe Harry is more than just alright.
“Draco Malfoy,” Draco says.
The two of them glare at each other for a moment, clearly both gauging the other’s stubbornness.  Eventually, while Tom Hanks exposes Richard Nixon on screen, Dobri looks away, chewing on his lower lip, and wiggles around on the sofa until he lands with his head in Draco’s lap.  He reaches around to grab Draco’s hand and place it in his hair.
“You didn’t exactly have a glowing complexion,” Dobri says with faux sympathy.  “Even before puberty Harry Potter didn’t look like he would burn from sitting at the window too long.”
“What’re you thinking about?” Blaise asks, jolting him out of his thoughts as he plops down beside Draco on the couch. His arm comes to rest easily around Draco’s shoulders, and the latter leans into the touch.
“Yes, I have taken that into account,” Draco says, “so this year I thought to give you something of no use whatsoever, so there’s on way to replicate it with a spell.”
tumbling out from between his lips as his brain short-circuits. The roar of the fire is suffocating, drowning out every thought – every
“I don’t know, Niko, they don’t look too tired to me,” Volkov mutters.  Draco privately agrees.  The English Chasers are practically bouncing and the Beaters have oddly menacing grips on their clubs.  Even though Draco’s seen enough of their games to know they don’t take too many penalties, he feels his stomach turn.
"James took Padfoot for a walk in the dog park. They had stupidly assumed that the name meant that it was for people to walk their dogs. It was not. They had to go into re-education, which apparently consisted of just writing lines repeatedly every day for two weeks." Remus explained, sounding amused by the experience.
As he made his way up the path to a familiar house, one of the men from the tent stationed in front of this particular house waved him over. Harry, not knowing what else to do, made his way over to the gesticulating man to see what he wanted — he looked harmless enough anyway.
Our current elected official is Minister Cornelius Fudge. You all may or may not remember the election that led to his victory. It occurred two weeks ago, in the dead of night, and consisted of agents from the Vague Yet Menacing Government holding a race between birds selected by the candidates. The one picked by Minister Fudge was the first to slam into the windows of the Ministry of Magic, earning him the victory and giving him the right to govern us all — of course, every decision he makes must be approved by our shadowy overlords.
"Me and Remmy here," Sirius began, wrapping an arm around Remus' waist and tugging him in close to his body. "We were on a top secret mission in the Department of Mysteries and got a bit lost and found ourselves near that veil. Then an Unspeakable appeared out of no where, scared the shit right out of us and before we knew it we were falling headfirst into the psychedelic acid trip beyond the veil." Remus shook his head in exasperation at Sirius' explanation but didn't object to any of the details.
"Better," George said in awe before the twins broke down laughing, leaning on each other for support as they could hardly stand straight from the force of the wheezes wracking their bodies.
"Yes, though it's quite short and quite confusing," Ron replied before rattling off the other occupants on the exclusive list. "Your parents, Sirius, Remus, Albus, Grindelwald, the Peverells, the Flamels, unicorns, narwhals, both the mammalian Herpestidae and Galidiinae families (because mongooses), phoenixes, fairies, thestrals, puffskeins, mountains, the concept of time, and Wednesday specifically."
Harry Potter was now older and wiser than the reckless teenager that threw himself headfirst into danger while at Hogwarts — or so he had thought.
Of course, I didn't do that. It would have been much too forward for a first meeting. But I did imagine it, and that's okay, because the Ministry has not yet figured out how to efficiently prosecute thought crimes. So, until that day comes, I will continue to live my best life in my mind and I recommend you do the same.
( No, Harry did not want to discuss how an inanimate object that only moved due to the circulation of air within the enclosed room could possibly be capable of taunting anyone, he just knew that it did. )
"I know that you aren't my parents (he gestured to James and Lily), or my godfather (he pointed to Sirius) or my former teacher slash father figure (he looked at Remus), but I'm glad I got to see you guys again." Harry knew his face was bright red — it always did that whenever he was emotional — and had to turn his gaze down towards the floor once he said his piece. So he was surprised when he was dogpiled by four adults that individually outweighed him almost 2:1 and were now close to breaking Harry's ribs under their combined weight.
"There's a list?" Harry asked, not knowing why he would be surprised by such a thing.
Oh. It appears that we are missing one intern, intern Logan who had been assigned to this weeks piece on the dog park.
"The Unspeakables?"
"I'm sorry, did you just say that legally both Wednesday, specifically, and the concept of time,generally, do not exist according to the government?" Harry was sure that this particular version of Voldemort was quite possibly a child, denying the existence of things that he either feared or did not like.
He had been in the Department of Mysteries — which, alright, was already highly suspect as he really had no reason to be there in the first place — and had found himself in the Death Room (or the curtain room as he referred to it in the privacy of his mind). To someone with far more sense than the current iteration of Potter, this already would have been cause for concern and most likely setting off alarm bells in their head — obviously, this was not the case at the present moment.
They all sat in silence, staring at each other, until Harry couldn't fight the words that were fighting to break free.
"Oh! And the redactions from the broadcast?" Harry remembered the series of beeps that had covered up each of their names.
[ Draco squints at the writing on the board held up behind the glass ]
And then there were the crows. They moved leisurely through the air, occasionally dipping down to hover in front of the unobstructed window of a house, where they stayed for many minutes before leaving and doing the same to the next house over.
"You guys happen to have a memory of it?" Harry asked hopefully.
"Merlin Myrtle! Warn me next time!" Harry whined, holding a hand over his heart and glaring at Ron and Ginny who hadn't bothered to use their previously agreed on signals for when Myrtle decided to pay them a visit.
"Would you mind letting them know that the front curtain is closed? Makes it hard to see into the house," he explained and Harry supposed that it made sense and so agreed to the request before continuing on up to the house and knocking gently on the front door.
Good morning listeners. I hope you've had as productive a morning as I have! Now, I know that we all awoke at the same time — because the daily morning howl has been scheduled for the same time every day for as long as I can remember — but I also know that some of you have been climbing back into bed right after. Don't try to deny it. Your assigned Auror's have already reported as such to the Ministry of Magic in their weekly briefs.
"Oh."
And now, listeners, it's time for the weather.
"Would be a bit hypocritical of us, otherwise. None of us are originally from around here," Remus said from beside Sirius, sounding just as sensible as his old school teacher.
"Oh I keep forgetting that you're new," Myrtle said, with that fake-apologetic tone. Ron rolled his eyes from behind her, knowing full well that she didn't forget — it was why she was practically targeting Harry to begin with.
"He also tried to make parchment, ink, quills, and the concept of writing illegal as well," Fred said reminding the others of that particular moment in time.
Which is why he had the absolutely brilliant idea to reach out to another person he knew would also be lonely and would even appreciated Harry reaching out to them. With an excited grin, Harry picked up the ivory receiver that was placed in each of the rooms of the house and requested the agent on the other side to connect him to the radio tower.
He disapparated, to meet Draco with conflicting emotions.
"You sound like you're talking from experience?" Harry watched as Sirius shifted guiltily in his seat, seeming to try and hide behind his lover who was just smirking in amusement.
[Draco pauses, mentally counting to 10 as he knows that would provide the most appropriate amount of time]
I have been informed, by the piece of parchment that had been slipped under the studio's door by station management that it is now time for our once daily reminder that the dog park is off limits. Do not enter the dog park. Do not look at the dog park. Do not make eye contact with the Unspeakables living in the dog park. Do not try to run if one of these hooded figures chase after you, they are quicker than you will ever be and the chase will only excite them — you do not want to excite them.
"Death Eater inner circle," Gellert supplied helpfully before returning to snuggling into Albus' side (which was a sight that Harry didn't think a million lifetimes would have prepared him for).
"Don't worry, bambi. We'll adopt you," James reassured, his voice sounding choked with emotion.
For once, all my interns have made it to the end of the week unharmed and I think that's cause enough for celebration — oh, wait. Intern Sophia is trying to tell me something.
"Completely off topic, but why are the Weasley's technically non-existant? Legally speaking?" Harry asked, the thought popping randomly to mind. "I mean, you guys are native to this dimension, right?"
"Yes?"
"Anyway, I'm in everyone’s home, all at once. So I see things. Like how Draco spends roughly an hour getting his hair just right even though he knows that no one will see because he's a faceless voice on a government mandated radio show. It's odd," She said, eyes going distant. "How similar we are. Both present everywhere at once, just voices to speak and bodies to cause some chaos, but no faces to be remembered by." Myrtle seemed to have talked herself into one of her depressive episodes as her voice trailed off and her body began to blur until they could no longer make out her form.
Harry was feeling bored one day. He knew it was inevitable. He had been here so long that it was only inevitable that he would acclimate to his new dimension and begin viewing its quirks as just part of the normal backdrop of daily life in Wizarding Britain under a Lord Voldemort that had contented himself with being a very silly Lord of the British Isles.
Well listeners, I hope you have all been doing well.
"Of course. It really is very pleasant to listen to, which is great, because we have to listen to you talking quite a bit," Harry explained. "Anyway, hey listen, this morning I was out walking into town because Lily" — a loud beep blocked out her name on the wireless, but Harry knew that Draco could hear the words unredacted. "Anyway, she sent me into town to buy a bag of apples for some project or other, she's probably making a bunch of pies which is the new thing she's gotten into. Anyway I bought those apples and had every intention of bringing them all home, but then I came across this gorgeous thestral (BEEP!) and just couldn't leave the poor girl outside. So I bribed her with some of the apples and brought her home. She just has the biggest, most sorrowful eyes you'd ever see on an animal, let alone a thestral (BEEP!). So now she's sleeping near me and it's very cute. I wish I could show you."
Now, for an important message: [There was a pause of silence to indicate a transition. Then, an ear splitting screech was relayed over the air. It continued on, like rusty nails being dragged over a particularly squeaky chalkboard before cutting off as abruptly as it began.]
But you already knew that, so shame on you. I hope you'll take the opportunity — during your 14 day mandatory imprisonment in the underground cells of the dog park — to reflect on your actions.
"Oh! Could you possibly include some of that pie you made last time?" The tinny voice called out, coming once again from the fruit bowl — Harry thinks it was from the pineapple, the most suspect of fruits — sounding embarrassed at the request.
Harry groaned as Draco collapsed on him, though he enjoyed the weight enough to allow it for a few more minutes before pushing the other off of him. Repositioning themselves, Harry muttered a quick cleaning charm, before curling into Draco's chest.
Harry quickly made sure Draco was okay with the direction things were going before leaning in and sinking his teeth into the soft flesh in his hands. He pulled back and lapped at the bruised skin in apology before working his way inward. Spreading those pale cheeks aside, Harry exposed his target, enjoying Draco's whimpers before leaning in and gently nibbling along the raised ridges before moving in, working Draco open with fingers and tongue until he was a moaning, writhing mess begging Harry to let him come. Harry thought about fucking Draco and the thought was so tempting, but he had had a plan before he left the house and he was going to see it through. With a mournful sigh, he teased the reddened hole one last time before turning Draco around to face him, and smiling reassuringly when he saw the confused look on the blonde's face.
"That obvious?" He asked, relieved that this was all going so smoothly.
"I've never been a formal teacher, but I can certainly step in to be a responsible role model for you," Remus said, voice hesitant in direct contrast to the firm grip he had on Harry.
"I've heard that Lucius is actually in charge of most things. It is a lot of paperwork," Remus offered.
According to David and Steve, the agents that were assigned to monitor the house — in order to continue to verify that these individuals in fact do not exist —, the newcomer is quite attractive if you like the short, waif-like figures with brilliant emerald eyes magnified by circular glasses too large for their small face and framed by a head of thick lustrous raven hair. The agents were kind enough to attach a picture to their missive and I do have to say that I agree with their assessment. It's a very niche look to be interested in, but those eyes are positively mesmerizing even from a photograph, and oh dear, that hair... most definitely lustrous. I bet you could just sink your fingers into it...
"It was a definite shock adjusting to this reality," Lily admitted, most likely in an attempt to reassure Harry. Harry appreciated the gesture and smiled in return.
"Like mountains." Harry echoed. "Wait, what does Voldemort have against mountains?" He wondered aloud, but it seemed he had finally stumped his odd family as they all shrugged before suggesting that it was time for dinner.
"Please," Draco whispered, his voice tremulous and on the cusp of becoming a whimper. Harry looked at their plates, barely touched though their wine glasses had certainly not been ignored. Figuring it all evened out, he left a generous tip and then stood and all but dragged Draco out of the restaurant.
"Oh yeah. So apparently our counterparts in this world are dead. Voldemort was not happy when he found us here. Course we promised that we'd play nice, so he just threw his hands up and declared his only press conference where he issued a blanket denial of all of us. You're not supposed to acknowledge that we exist at all." Harry thought about that, and had some more questions.
"Well?" Fred prompted, shaking his twin’s collapsed body. "How was it? As good as the rumors?"
Anyway, I now have to read some notices from the government representative — this does not include any information that Minister Fudge may wish to share, mind you, as he has his daily press conference still scheduled for later in the afternoon.
He stared up at the tall figure of James Potter — Harry never knew his father had been so tall, everyone had failed to mention that — with wide eyes magnified even larger behind the lens of the glasses that dwarfed his face.
"Must have skipped me," Harry said with a pout, not having known that particular characteristic before and now feeling annoyed that he hadn't inherited that specific trait. "You guys are taking this all rather well, by the way." Harry said, intending it as praise but knowing that some of that was tempered with shock and a liberal sprinkle of suspicion.
The interns and I all drew a lot and I am sad to announce that intern Mira had been chosen as the representative.
“Still! He really likes you!”
So Draco had had four years in regionals and a fucking European Cup to his name by the time he made it onto the Bulgarian National team, and even then he was nowhere near as well-received as Harry Potter was by their respective countries.  It’s far from fair, and Draco will probably resent it until the day he dies.
“Let me show you,” Harry says. “Let me show you how perfect you are, how good you are. Let me show you that you deserve to be loved.”
“Okay,” Vulchanov echoes.  Volkov has clearly let him take the wheel here, which is fair—Vulchanov is a happily married father of four while Volkov still takes the rookies out for drinks every few weeks and gets completely sloshed with them.  “Alright.”  He changes the subject.  “Huh.  Has anyone seen Dobri today?”
England wins their matches against France, but loses miserably to Senegal just a week later.  Bulgaria beats Japan twice at the Tokyo Pitch and the team goes out drinking in Muggle Japan.  It’d be a lovely trip if Draco could spend it with all of his friends on the team, but instead he only really talks to Dobri.  Bogomil is glued to Zo’s side, and their resident lightweight Nikola flounces between the Beaters.  For their part, the vets are doing a great job of pretending there’s no problem with the current group dynamic.
(A younger Draco Malfoy might have sneered, taunted him, told him that had James Potter been alive to see him now, he would be disgusted that such a sight could belong to a boy who supposedly looks just like him, but this Draco is different. This Draco is thinner, just like Harry Potter is; he’s disheveled and dirty and hollow and perhaps a sight that Lucius Malfoy should be disappointed in too.
“Still married,” Draco says flatly, which makes Becker laugh.
, Draco thinks, but he can see pain past downcast eyes, and for the first time he sees his friend as Gregory rather than Goyle.
“Blaise is smart,” Draco agrees.
Draco eyes him warily and complies, making room for himself in Dobri’s huge blanket nest.  Dobri only (and always) watches
, you know, like a real Gryffindor – ”
“Well what?”
Draco immediately thinks of the
That seems to catch the Auror’s attention. “What do you mean?”
Draco’s eyes are glued to Hagrid’s lap; his chest tightens. “Where’s – where’s Potter?” he asks, voice pitching, and suddenly he can’t breathe, he’s back in the Room or Requirement and there’s fire chasing him, barely a meter away, and Crabbe slips and Goyle is screaming and the Gryffindors aren’t turning back and
Dobri is back at practice the next day, because they really can’t afford to miss much when they have a game coming up.  It’s against Egypt, the defending Cup winners.  Draco tries not to think about the odds of Bulgaria being defeated again, especially since this new team is far less experienced than the old one (which Egypt had previously beaten anyway).
Draco shakes his head, relaxing against Blaise’s hold. “No,” he says quietly. “No, I’m okay.”
It’s not the truth, and Blaise knows it, but he doesn’t ask questions. “Fancy a drink?”
“Well, he didn’t say anything to me,” Draco says.  “I’ll stop by his flat after practice if he doesn’t show.  Maybe he’s sick.”
It’s not much, but it’s a start. Potter’s look of surprise at Draco’s gratitude speaks volumes about how much the latter has changed, and Blaise doesn’t know how to feel about it.
Forrest proposes to Jenny and she says no.  Dobri used to cry at this part, although after seeing it so many times he’s more or less immune to it now.  Maybe it’s the knowledge that she’ll come back to him eventually.  He still cries at the end when Forrest stands at Jenny’s grave.
“You deserve the world.”
Marcus rounds on him, sneering. “Zabini. Still sucking his dick, I see. I thought the two of you would’ve moved on from that by now.”
They find their way back to the raging battle outside. Blaise is somehow there within seconds, immediately hurrying over to the doorway to ask what’s happened and telling Gregory to go find his parents, and the bigger boy does so without complaint; he seems to understand that Blaise will do a better job of calming Draco’s frayed nerves.
Niko seems somewhat unconvinced.  Draco can’t blame him—by the hoops, Zo is starting to look frustrated, and England’s Chasers have been doing a surprisingly good job of dodging Vulchanov and Volkov’s Bludgers.  England has had an overwhelming majority of the possession of Quaffle, which is fairly typical of their matches.  But despite his obvious uncertainty, Niko is the next to score.
But they’re at a comfortable spot to expect to make it to the playoffs, and by this point Bulgaria as a country seems to have become resigned to the fact that Draco isn’t Krum and the new team isn’t the old, so no one is terribly bothered that they’re not one of the top picks for the Cup again as they had been for the past four years.
Things are alright, for a while. The days develop a routine for themselves; Draco awakens to the slam of the front door when Marcus leaves for work every morning, fixes himself a cup of too-bitter coffee, checks on the stocks and bonds he’s invested his family’s fortune in and, day after day, stays at home. He does the laundry, dusts the furniture, cooks a dinner he doesn’t eat half of, and almost always falls asleep before Marcus gets home from work.
“That must have felt terrible,” Draco says, trying to be comforting.
“Just a piece of home decor,” Draco says lightly, which earns him a glare.  “Fine, fine, it’s the first Snitch I caught, alright?  Well, not the
—”  He stops himself, because that had actually happened one time, and he’s been careful to liberally apply skin protection charms since then.  “Why are we talking about Potter again?”
Draco can’t look him in the eye, doesn’t want to lie, but he nods anyway.
It’s not long before Marcus picks up a bad drinking habit, though, and Draco figures the thought of a future that stable and predictable was too good to be true anyway.
“I had to,” Dobri sobs.  “I was drunk and he was drunk and I was forcing myself onto him—I don’t even remember if he kissed me back!  How could I face him after that?”
“Hey,” the Italian says softly, crouching to pull Draco into his lap. “Potter is on his way, okay? You’ll see. It’s going to be fine.”
Dobri makes a face.  “Don’t use that tone to say ‘fourth’—we
His third season started off significantly better, but was cut short by a career-ending injury that damaged his knee beyond repair.  For the remainder of the season, the Cannons were forced to play their backup Seeker, who was so anxious after having witnessed Diggory’s accident that he refused to go anywhere near the goalposts or make any risky plays, and ultimately only caught one Snitch.  Then Harry Potter graduated from Hogwarts the next year and the Cannons tried to recruit him, but he went to the National team instead, and so they never quite recovered from the loss of Diggory.
The first is from the day he got his first broom.  His parents hadn’t wanted to let him start flying so young, but Draco had cried and begged for the entire week leading up to his fourth birthday, and eventually it had gotten so annoying that Lucius gave in.  And despite his initial hesitance, Lucius was ecstatic about how quickly Draco took to flying.  He even hired Madam Hooch as a private coach for that summer, and by the time she went back to Hogwarts in the fall, Draco was flying high enough to have his mother chasing after him, screaming for fear that he would go headfirst into the roof.
“I’ll bring you some dry clothes,” Blaise offers.
He turns back to see Potter grinning widely, celebrating with his teammates, and the hatred grows.
,” he says delicately.  “I have an alabaster skin tone.”
