"Harry!
But Harry had bigger concerns. It was Draco's birthday in a few days, and he was rarely allowed to leave the manor and would be unable to get him a gift. Not that either of them had really had birthdays the past few years, but Harry knew Draco would appreciate a gift.
"How did you sleep?" Harry asked after a moment, looking a little awkward. Draco laughed in disbelief.
Selfishly, Draco didn't want to talk about it. He wanted to forget it had all happened, and didn't want to remind Harry of it either. Draco spent most of breakfast contemplating it, but Harry's little giggles made Draco decide it could wait. He thought they both deserved some time to rest and forget.
Draco paused for a moment. "I... yes please, Madam."
Harry held his breath as the enchanted harp started to play. The giant monster growled, before it's eyelids slowly started to droop. Soon, it slept, one of it's giant paws resting on the trap door.
The room was sweltering. The humidity caused many students to cast aside non-essential  garments. Cloaks hung on the backs of chairs, ties of green and gold loosened, shirts partially unbuttoned and no longer tucked in, all as sweat dripped down noses and temples. It ran down their necks and their chests, beading their brows.
"I put a silencing charm around him so we wouldn't wake up from us speaking. I needed to make sure you were alright first, and it is much easier without a barnacle attached to my patient," she said with a smile. Harry's face turned red.
"Get some rest, I believe you need it." Dumbledore inclined his head, calling for Dinky. He was gone in a moment.
"It's the dementors, 'Mione. I know they're only at the entrances, but it seems like..." Harry trailed off. Hermione gave his arm an encouraging squeeze, and Snuffles nudged him as well. Harry gave a tired smile, slowly petting Snuffles. "They're so
"S-Sirius?"
"What the fuc-"
"Who...?" He trailed off.
"Over the summer."
Draco wondered if the twinkle in his eye was his imagination. Dumbledore leaned away from the sphere, rubbing his beard in speculation as it vanished. It was a long moment before he spoke, a moment in which Draco almost screamed.
Draco's heart ached. At some point, it had stopped being an obligation, a chore, a necessity. At some point it stopped being only friendly. It had turned into real affection, which he thought Harry returned.
The two disappeared with a
Dumbledore had been replaced. McGonagall was now Headmistress, and Dumbledore suspended for a trail against 'endangerment to students.' Harry was mildly curious as to how the events would play out -Cedric had survived, and the tournament did have a bloody history- but it wasn't until another two months in August.
He sat alone for a little while, before he pulled out a textbook he hadn't had the time to look over, his potions book. He skimmed the pages, not really paying attention. He was a bit more concerned for Hermione than he suppose he should be, which he didn't really like. He hadn't ever really cared for someone.
a face rested on the back of Quirrell's skull, hardly recognizable as human. It hissed at him, the sound repulsive and terrifying.
It wasn't on the couch, stuck between the cushions or wrapped in the blanket. He couldn't find it on the floor or under the overturned table. Ready to cry, he dropped to the ground and searched under the couch, catching a glimpse of it.
Harry looked over his shoulder at the raggedy, horribly thin man. "They threatened my life. Didn't have much of a choice," he spoke, hoping the man was able to hear him over the wind.
"What happened? Where's-" he looked around himself, freezing when he spotted a white-blond head of hair. Draco was asleep on the bed next to him, curled around a pillow. Harry felt the air leave him.
Harry popped his head up from where it had rested with his chin almost touching his chest. "Hm?"
"He isn't my lord, Draco. He'll never be. I'm not letting that happen," Harry muttered, stabbing an innocent croissant with a fork.
Time felt slowed as he walked towards it. There might be anyone behind it. His father, the snake, Voldemort himself... there was a very real chance Draco wouldn't be coming out of this alive. He wanted to cower; every muscle in his body was yearning to leap back down the stairs. But he couldn't, not when he was this close.
Shaking his head a little, he turned away from Draco. Madam Pomfrey cast several spells, a list Harry didn't understand appearing besides her.
"We could put the cloak on him," Harry suggested. He looked down at Snuffles, who's ears perked in interest, his tail wagging.
"Yessssssss," Voldemort whispered, then remained silent. Harry waited for him to speak again -he would dismiss him if he was allowed- for long minutes until Voldemort stood and started circling him.
Harry moved so his head was against Draco's chest, one hand holding onto the collar of his shirt.
, the potion that caused this," he paused, "ordeal. Like a muggle vaccine. I found it while I was researching different types of cures. The muggles have advanced in medicine impressively without magic."
Draco gave Harry a small, forced smile. "Where did we first meet?"
"Unfortunately," Draco grimaced, sitting next to Harry. He poured himself a cup of tea, leaning back in the comfy couch.
"Don't let him Mark you, Harry. Anything is better than a live of slavery to an evil wizard. You're so much better than that, I know you can get out of his grasp," Sirius urged, his voice panicked.
Someone pointed out that the title is similar to dirty words in Latin, and now I've been faced with the unfortunate battle of not being able to change something I desperately want to. But I REFUSE and I will ACCEPT my double-entendre title. Well, thank you to those who reviewed, and enjoy!
Harry let go of the key, feeling a little bad as it fluttered into the air with a broken wing.
"Potter? Potter!" Draco called, unsure of what he was supposed to do. He fluttered around Harry, accidentally crushing the teacup that Harry had dropped. Harry slumped on the couch, head at an awkward angle, chest heaving with ragged breathing.
"Now what?"
But Harry was fine. He was rolling and diving and Harry was having the absolute best time of his life. Draco double-casted a few charms just in case, though, and let Harry fly for as much as it terrified him.
Harry wasn't sure.
The man that was holding him scoffed and held Harry out. Harry gasped desperately for air, eyes falling closed and head tilting as he was suddenly very light headed. But then sharp, cruel fingers dug into his sides and he was being held like a baby and looking at the woman. She smiled down at him, mouth stretching unnaturally wide across pale and cracked skin.
Suddenly the broom gave a hard shake, reminding Draco far too much of first year. Then Harry was almost touching the ceiling and going
"How do you feel?" He asked after a tense moment. Harry shrugged. Draco controlled his expression, nodding. "That's alright." Was he... disappointed? He had to be. That should have fixed Harry, should have returned things to how they were.
Draco took their questions much slower. Most days Harry wouldn't remember anything new, but sometimes Harry would remember little things. What house Neville Longbottom was in, what kind of bird Headmaster Dumbledore had, what his own patronus was.
The school did not match the enthusiasm of the music. The stands buzzed with murmurs, sounding so much like a beehive Harry shivered. They were all discussing the same thing:
"I'll do my best," Harry told him, smiling. The portrait nodded, and looked at Draco.
"You're not going to come with us to tell Professor McGonagall?" Hermione asked. She seemed a little hurt, making Harry feel bad.
"This is mine?" He asked.
Harry nodded after a moment, though he didn't let go. Draco was okay with that. This may be the last time he would get to hold Harry like this. He was going to savor it.
He looked at the door. It was old, rustic and wooden. The keyhole was large, larger than he thought most of the keys were.
I do apologize if you aren't fond of the 'jumping around' scenes type of writing I do, but that is my style when I think adding transition would be redundant because the audience already knows the information - such that of one character telling another character something they just found out. That being said, I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Draco had completely forgotten about charms to mask his scent.
Draco frowned, and grabbed a plate to make it himself. He put two pancakes, some bacon, a piece of toast, and a few eggs on it and slid it over. He realized that Harry wouldn't be able to eat the entire plate at his size. He probably wouldn't have been able to eat it at sixteen, either. But Draco knew that this was what he normally ate -embarrassingly enough- so he went ahead with his gut, ignoring Harry's wide eyes.
He swallowed the saliva collecting in his mouth. "How do you feel?" He asked, feeling choked.
" It went out.
Draco stared at Harry until his eyes watered. Pressing his palms into his eyes until he saw spots and didn't feel like he was about to cry, Draco shook himself. Feeling like he couldn't breathe, he stared and stared, waiting for something to change, something to
Dumbledore didn't seemed to have heard him. "Your name has a peculiar meaning to it, doesn't it?"
"Are you going to put protections around their quarters?"
"Did I do something wrong?" Harry asked, looking worried. Draco shook his head vigorously.
Draco snorted. "No, you never did. Do you think-"
Draco slowly approached the bed, catching a stuffed animal in his hand. It wasn't going fast enough to hurt, the cyclone stopped moving once he had caught it. Draco pushed through the things that had landed around Harry, he took a seat on the bed. He watched Harry toss and turn, his heart hurting with each whimper and cry. Draco used one hand to hold down Harry's left hand, since his right wasn't moving. Draco used his other hand to gently shake the boy.
"What'd you do that for?" Harry asked, suspicion ringing out in his high tone. Harry coughed, swallowing a few times. His own voice was throwing him off.
"Oh!" Hermione exclaimed. She jumped up, and Harry helped move her trunk up onto the rack above his.
Harry couldn't have moved the bottle slower. As he finally tipped his head back, he prayed his heart wouldn't explode or something. Knowing his luck...
Draco was astounded by how foolish his headmaster could sound sometimes, really. "Sir, I really don't think I'm the person you want for this. Potter and I don't have any...particularly platonic memories between us."
Professor Snape watched his movements, zeroing in on his face. His eyes flickered to the bruise balm on the table, then to Draco in a silent question, to which he shrugged. He had his suspicions, but nothing he could really prove.
He had run into a huge room with a giant bed and stuffed animals littered about the sheets and floor. This was the room he had woken up in, but he thought it must've been Draco's. Harry probably had a much smaller area somewhere he didn't remember. He climbed onto the bed and snuggled a stuffed black dog to his chest. He hoped Draco wouldn't mind, but he felt...safe.
"GRYFFINDOR!"
Draco found packets in one of the cabinets, using a spell to boil some water. While it mixed, Draco moved in front of Harry. "Hey, why don't we change and then drink on the couch, okay?"
Harry smiled at Draco, who sped into bed and snapped the curtains around his bed shut quickly. Harry laughed, and went to bed easy.
Dumbledore filled their walk with small talk, to Harry's surprise. He began with the news on the Daily Prophet, of how a squib had just been tried with abusing dark artifacts. Harry mostly hummed in response, feeling awkward with Dumbledore's eye watching him closely.
Now they both sat in her office, blood quills in hand. Harry saw Draco's face grimace in pain, and Harry looked at his own hand, reading
"I can do anything. Especially for you."
He had started to leave the compartment when she suddenly appeared, almost running into him.
"Indeed. Never a good match without some Quaffle fighting, is it?" Dumbledore said, thoughtfully looking down at Harry, who nodded. "Yes, indeed...blood pops."
"I don't know who that is Harry. Your at Hogwarts," Draco paused, shuffling a bit to sit up straight, "do you know what that is?"
"Yes please, Headmaster." Draco wasn't sure he had the energy to walk up there holding Harry.
He entered a dark room, the only illuminated thing being a chess board where the pieces were all twice his size.
"Potter?" Draco called. Harry dropped the animal, stepping away from it.
to attack me? In my own home?" Draco cried out, making Harry snort.
"What were those?" Harry asked.
Hermione nodded, whispering an incantation and moving her wand in a bit of a flicking motion.
had never said it. That was...
Draco thought back to third year. After Granger had
"This is all mine?" Harry gasped, almost throwing Snuffles off the couch to hold the mug, making Draco laugh.
"A basilisk? Gram told me they were really evil creatures!" Neville whispered, shuddering.
Harry took another step back. "What do you want?"
"Yes, sir...it means 'Dragon'...what does this have to do with me?"
Draco let his head fall back on the armrest of the couch. The ceiling was a cream color with a smooth texture, and didn't budge under Draco's confused glare. There was an... odd feeling in his chest. It felt like it pulsed underneath his rib cage. His face scrunched up white he thought. He was almost repulsed by the
Harry looked like he was about to cry. Draco stopped himself, biting his lip. "It's okay, Harry. You did great, I promise. You're completely fine." Draco stood and came to Harry's side of the table, rubbing his back. Harry stuffed his face into Draco's ribs, shaking a little.
Draco groaned quietly. His homework was
"Hello. We were looking for an empty compartment, sorry," the dark skinned boy went to close the door, but Draco grabbed his arm.
Voldemort collapsed. The Death Eaters that had been behind him stopped in their tracks. One raised their wand, a
"Snakes. I can talk to snakes because I'm...a parselmouth," Harry sighed, leaning his head against the shelf.
"Yeah, we need to tell professor McGonagall. She's the deputy headmistress, and I know where her office is," Neville offered.
Time went by, and the platform slowly filled. He closed the door to his compartment, hoping it'd be passed by. But, of course, that wasn't the case. The door was opened numerous times, once by a tall boy with mousy brown hair, who apologized quickly. Harry wanted to ask him about his yellow robes, but he didn't get a chance before he shut the door and walked away.
"I killed Voldemort, and some other Death Eaters that tried to attack me," Draco shouted, but Harry cut him off, "I am so fucking tired of this Draco, and I'm ending it right now. Either you are going to stay here and be safe until I'm done." Harry paused for a breath, a devilish smile gracing his features. "Or you're going to take revenge with me."
Draco turned in a slow circle. The room didn't feel any different. Though Draco wouldn't be surprised if Dumbledore could cast heavy protective charms that were undetectable without a spell. Or maybe it was Hogwarts herself. He had never been able to feel her wards like he had been able to at Malfoy Manor, but that could be because of blood.
No, he wanted to be closer than them. He wanted Harry in his arms, tucked into his side. He wanted a grown Harry to smile at him and hold onto his shirt and call him 'Dray.'
He was so...
"You will both be sleeping in that room. Once she returns, you will be shown how to get there and the password. Your things will be moved up there shortly. Mr. Malfoy, please do calm yourself, red doesn't suit you as well as it does Fawks." Chuckling, Dumbledore smiled at the two of them.
Transfiguration, he unfortunately shared with the Gryffindors. Mcgonagall stared at him over her glasses as he walked in late, but said nothing. Her class began with her silently pacing back and forth, staring at her students. Whispers vanished as soon as her harsh eyes passed them.
"Harry, Sirius Black was caught having killed thirteen people, including a good friend of ours, Peter-"
The boy waved. "This is Neville, he's a first year like us. I said he could sit with us, if you wouldn't mind."
Harry ignored that instruction. He set alight flags, lawn decorations, just enough to where no one would punish him for not participating.
"They always called me 'Freak'. But when I went to Muggle school for the first time, I heard my name was Harry Potter. Then I went to gringotts for the first time with Hagrid, and I learned my full name was Harry James Potter."
Harry's smile dropped a bit. He hoped she wouldn't freak out. "I'm Harry Potter. Nice to meet you, Hermione." Harry held out his hand, and she took it quickly.
Stuffing down his rage -which may or may not be justified, he couldn't be
Mr. Malfoy pulled him down to the ground before he could react, and Draco was down almost just as quick. His knee banged against the marble floor harshly, causing him to wince.
Draco leaped out of his chair, anger filling him. "Harry could be
Voldemort sat on his throne, gripping his wand so tightly it looked ready to snap in two. A faint hissing came from his mouth occasionally, followed by a hiss from Nagini. They were too quiet for Harry to hear, which was a little disappointing. Voldemort hadn't been around lately, so Harry hadn't had much time to listen to his plans. Not that Harry would
Pulling himself away gently, Draco went to his own room to write Professor Snape.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "A grim?"
The sound of the floo woke Draco up, and Harry's scream launched him off the couch.
Harry twirled to avoid a stalagmite, curving along the edge of the wall. He was on its tail, so close...
Ignorant to it all - or maybe just acting like she was - Hermione walked lightly to the front of the classroom, another small bottle of her perfect looking potion in hand. She smiled at Professor Slughorn, though her happy face was mostly obstructed by the disaster her hair had become.
"Potion mishap," Harry said, shuffling his feet a little. Madam Pomfrey nodded, eyebrow now at a normal height but lips now pursed.
Draco held his breath. "His canines aren't poisonous, just longer than an adult’s would be; I could easily fix them with a shrinking charm. The scales," she pointed to dull green patches on Harry's arms and neck and face, "go over his whole body in small patches. They seem like normal skin, just a different texture."
injury he'd gotten at this age until he was fixed? That brought up the uncomfortable question of Harry's family who called him 'freak.' Boys did tend to play rough and get a lot of bruises at seven, but thinking about it made Draco uneasy.
"Father has a message for us.
"Sorry, 'Mione. He likes to hang around me a lot. Cause we're in the same house, or something."
to hear the snake. Some shuffling, creaking, hissing, something to let him know it had woken up.
Soon, a small fruit basket had been left outside the doors that lead to the Quidditch pitch, suddenly appearing. Audible footsteps walked away, with no body to accompany them. Not ten minutes later, a large dog lumbered to the area, barked at the dementors, picked up the basket by it's handle and trotted off towards the whomping willow.
"Here, Ferret-Face," Harry said, handing out his gift which he had kept behind his back. Draco glared at him -he
"I'll find you. Be careful, Harry."
"Well, it couldn't hurt to give you a bit of a bath, right?" Harry knew
Harry wrapped his scarf tighter around his neck. Hermione walked next to him, fascinated by the shop windows. Trinkets floated, horns blew, clothes twirled themselves, self-inking quills displayed their abilities in an elegant font, tea pots filled teacups with precision. It was the most concentrated hub of pure...
Harry stepped in front of Draco, holding his hands up in a placating motion while Dinky trembled off to the side. "Please, Sir Mercy, I'll make sure he won't say anything bad about vampires. He's nice, the family has really changed the past few centuries! Draco's father now advocates for creatures rights, and had been trying to get vampires a better status in the ministry for years now!" Harry explained hastily. Draco furrowed his eyebrows, but nodded along. Such a thought was preposterous, but if it kept him in a warm bed he would tolerate it.
The bottle was drained, and Harry had a moment to shudder violently. He began to set the bottle down, before he fell down to his knees, gasping in pain. Harry clutched his stomach, and cried out.
To Draco's surprise, Harry got the concept almost before Draco had told him. Soon he was zooming around the room without any assistance. The practice broom had enchantments to ensure it didn't go above two meters, and the speed was limited as well.
Lupin looked up, a tired smile on his face.
Grumbling, Harry drank it while pinching his nose. It didn't even smell that bad, Harry just wanted to make him feel guilty. He handed the empty potion back with a grimace -which Draco was sure was also fake- and Draco set it on the bedside table.
He forgot how terrible fever dreams could be.
“Is that so?” she replied, giving him a look. “Then, you’re definitely sick.”
They laid like that for a while, Harry’s arms wrapped around Draco, the old blanket strewn over them. He combed a hand through his hair. Draco told a story to his neck, brushing his lips across the sensitive skin. Harry’s breath came out in huffs. He felt Draco smirk into his skin.
A red bowl was placed in front of him. His tired mind woke up for a moment, “What is this?”
Only when it was said out loud, he heard how it sounded. He took a large bite of his sandwich. “It’s just…the first time I’ll be seeing Ginny since the breakup.”
It’s funny that Malfoy had forgotten and then, remembered what they were doing. Because when a shirtless man – lips dark from bruises, eyes dazed – emerged from his room, Harry forgot everything.
He rolled his eyes, “I don’t want a token Slytherin, I want you.”
A simple interaction. A quick exchange of words was all that stood between him and his wonderful breakfast.
Up until now.
And like before, it disappeared, and he nodded. “Okay, can we
He noticed leather chair next to the Floo. “What’s that?”
Draco rubbed at his face. It was wet with tears and his throat was so dry it hurt. He felt around the bedside table for the glass of water and drank from it.
The boy returned with a bundle of clothing in his hands. He wrapped Draco into the blankets, arranging his limbs accordingly. He probably looked like that Mexican dish Muggles were always going on about, but he was much warmer.
They eventually made it to the bedroom, mostly naked. The blankets hit Harry’s back. Draco climbed on top of him, slotting their hips together with delicious friction.
“Put out your arms,” he commanded. And Draco did so, feeling like a small child when Potter began to take off the cardigans. He left the last one on and disappeared. It was sweet gesture really, leaving his Dark Mark covered, even when they both knew it was there.
“Um, that wasn’t-,” Harry dropped the fork, his ears suddenly very warm.
“It kind of reminds me of my cupboard, a small space that used to be home,” he explained, ignoring the burning of his ears. “But there is no roof or darkness here and the sky goes on forever. It’s a small space, but free.”
“What is Parkinson doing in Tokyo?”
“I did not know that,” Malfoy said, his tone neutral. When Harry snuck a peek at his face, his lips were simply pursed.
Harry exhaled. “Maybe.”
In some way, maybe the same way he poured all the secrets out of him, Malfoy always knew the words. The words that went down like honey, warmed his insides and slowed the rapid beating of his heart.
He looked at the herb in his hands, “Thanks for the basil, mate.”
than what they made you.”
“Harry” – his heart soared at the sound – “you know it’s funny. Here I am, helping you with
“Bottom left drawer,” he answered, humor in his voice.
“So, you should leave first,” Harry reasoned, clearing his throat.
“Okay, maybe two,” he admitted, leaning in again. He couldn’t help it. He was already addicted.
“I’m sorry,” Harry choked out.
He took a sip from the mug. “I am surprised that Granger didn’t mention it.”
Malfoy walked into the living room, a steaming cup of tea in his hand.
That startled a laugh out of Harry, “You win.”
He waved, as if there wasn’t a stranger grinding against his ass. Harry couldn’t move.
“Bullshit.” Harry couldn’t even picture him with an apron on.
The man turned (the waves moving with him) and spotted him, eyes wide. Every part of Harry was on fire. His eyes followed the water drop that rolled down the curve of his chest, abs and dipped beneath his towel. The twist of his body showing off the shape of his hipbones.
Maybe Harry understood Malfoy’s sadness, after all.
He reasoned that it was temporary. And made sense. Because at this point, there was no denying that they were friends. Two love bites appeared in his mind. He crushed the bread in his hand.
Harry stared, “Only if you want to tell me.”
“Neighbors...”
He adjusted his glasses and stared at him, praying to Merlin that he was wrong. Gray eyes, arrogant posture, wicked smirk. Of course, there were new things that came with time: darker eye bags, the beginnings of stubble, an aura of peace that was
Beside him, someone grabbed the glass out of his hand. He turned to Parkinson, her brow drenched in sweat, eyes straight ahead. She took a sip of the drink, red lipstick staining the glass, “Aren’t they hot?”
“No, I think that you take care of things because you like it.” His voice was strangely soft, as if speaking more to himself than Harry. “I do it because I want to
Hogwarts Malfoy could never compare.
They stayed there for a little longer, remembering their magic. Ginny pulled away first, her eyes shining. Harry smiled.
Harry rolled out of bed, awakening nausea from the night before. A crumbled t-shirt was on the ground. He picked it up and unraveled it, visceral proof of what he did last night. He felt at his boxers and groaned.
“Why? You’re half Asian.”
Thoughtless, Harry took it. His body’s reaction was to finally let go of those tears, racing down his cheeks like two raindrops on a car window. He tried not to care that Malfoy is watching.
right now. “You are such an asshole.”
“Not all balconies are fancy as yours,” Harry countered.
Up until Malfoy returned with banana bread and flour, Harry thought the interaction as a dream. He was at the stove when the man burst into his apartment.
“I’m tired now.” He waved lazily at Harry, “You do the rest.”
“…so we don’t have to talk about what you were dreaming about. But I can sit here if you don’t want to be alone.”
“My moon sign is Scorpio,” he whispered. His breath tickled Harry’s ear. “Scorpios are water elements. And that’s what I’m going to name my future kid. Scorpius.”
His stomach grumbled, angry at him too.
all-nighters last week.”
His gaze followed the hand up to the owner. A trial of drool spilled out the corner of his mouth. It was still dark, but the outline of his profile against the morning light shouldn’t have been as beautiful as it was.
“Now?”
“They have a beautiful story,” Draco said, eyes foggy.
“Top floor. And I…”
The eggs stared at Harry.
He gave him a deep look, full of appreciation. Raw, open and honest. And Harry wanted to see that look for the rest of his life. Harry swallowed at the realization.
. As if Harry would ever dismiss him for
“We were all children.”
“You can just be Potter. You have always been Potter.”
He was trying. He was really trying.
Before Harry knew it, rays of light streamed through the window, painting the kitchen gold.
He snuck another glance at the two, looking over his glass. Parkinson’s back was pressed up against Malfoy’s chest. She reached behind her to grab his shoulder and bring them closer.
He put his head at Harry’s chest and Harry shakily placed his arms around the boy, sinking into the comfort it provided.
He didn’t even ask anything this time, just came into his room at the wrong time.
“Don’t ever say that. You are allowed all your emotions,” he paused, clearing his throat. Pink dusted his cheekbones. “And you, of all people, deserve happiness.”
Harry scrunched up his face. But the thing is they have been. No matter how much hate was between them, Harry had always felt like he had been saying the right thing. Now it was all wrong.
Draco placed his finger next to Harry’s, tracing the bird’s path. They emerged from the skull, glanced around for a beat and eventually, soared away. “To remind me that I am free now.”
Connect-Learning Around Silent Stories (CLASS) was a program at one of the best Muggle schools, Oxford. It was the first ever to offer a Masters, valid in both Magical and Muggle worlds. It was an attempt of many, since the war, to provide more overlap between the two worlds.
go inside now?”
“Yeah, definitely...”
He giggled. “That’s it?”
Harry was left at the table, flabbergasted at the aggressive kindness he had been shown.
“This is the ocean,” he said, like Harry hadn’t spent nights wanting to trace it with his fingers. He did that now, reaching out. Draco gasped.
“Don’t you know how to knock?” he hissed, voice raw.
“You deserve it too,” he said instead.
Breathless, he nodded.
“Did I say that out loud?” Harry whispered, smiling back at Ron.
Harry grumbled, dizzy with sleep. “I did not
“Black family tradition,” Draco said, voice still in Harry’s ear. Harry nodded, looking Sirius’s constellation from time to time.
He tilted their heads together, so Draco could only see the green of his eyes.
The scene shifted. The wand was in his hand this time, pointed at Dumbledore’s throat. His eyes were already dull and lifeless, but he still spoke. “You did this to me.”
Harry accidently made eye contact with Parkinson. A spike of embarrassment went through him.
“How did you know?”
“If you eat all my basil, I will kill you,” Malfoy concluded, before disappearing into his room with a sketchbook and pencil.
The week had been unusually full of sun. He gestured to his own cheeks. “You should wear sunscreen…do you know what that is?”
”) floated in the air awkwardly before plunging onto the floor. They stared at it, as it writhed around unhappily. His third attempt of avoiding awkwardness failed. Maybe, in their relationship, they had to pick between the two: hostile or awkward.
The eggs continued to stare at him.
“Yeah…she is half-Japanese,” Malfoy quirked an eyebrow at the Harry’s shocked face. “That means that her father is…”
Malfoy plopped himself onto the couch, tilting his head in thought, the curve of his pale neck in full view. “I make amazing banana bread.”
“I’m not sure what else to call it.”
“That may be true,” he replied. Harry flinched.
“I didn’t get any omelet for the basil you stole,” Malfoy countered, not meeting Harry’s eyes. He walked into the apartment, keeping his gaze on the floor.
“I didn’t pass out,” Harry grumbled, escaping towards the kitchen. “Where is the basil?”
Potter took a breath and reached out. His hand was rough with calluses, but solid on top of Draco’s. Every hair on his body stood up. Before he could repeat his question, Potter spoke again.
“Just try it,” he said, completely serious. If Draco died, it would be on Potter.
It wasn’t a dream.
He sent him off with pamphlets of the other schools and shut the door. His bladder hurt. Harry waved to everyone in the office and headed towards the Floo. With the powder in his hand, he remembered, last second, to go to Malfoy’s apartment. Tumbling into the apartment, he made a beeline to the bathroom and swung the door open.
This love would take work. They would have to find new ways to fix themselves, to sew together. But when Malfoy moved again to clasp their hands together, tighter this time, and snuggled into the blankets beside him, Harry knew it was worth it.
Harry raised an eyebrow at the abrupt departure. He managed to mumble something about it being rude before the door slammed shut. He made gestures at the door before rolling back into bed.
They were both torn apart by trauma and put together somehow, collaged into a whole being.
They stared at each other, both frozen. Malfoy hovered for a moment before averting his gaze and stating, “Your door was unlocked.”
He knew there was a whine in his voice, but Potter already knew the worst of him. He pouted, trying to look as sick and sad as he felt.
The man finished before Harry, looking up at him. He offered a crooked grin, “It was okay.”
Malfoy was in there, fresh out of the shower – turned away, towel around his waist, muscles stretching across his shoulders. Bladder forgotten, Harry could not look away.
All the things on the checklist for a happy life.
Malfoy let go of him and headed towards the sliding door. He pulled at it, but was met with resistance. “Potter, where is the key?”
He immediately regretted it. The word (“
He let the blanket fall off his shoulders and extended his arms. Both were beautiful. His left forearm had it – something that used to be the Dark Mark, but not anymore. Draco had changed it. Flowers blooming out of what used to be a snake, birds flying out of the skull.
“You were a child.”
But then the ray of sun moved on and he tucked the feeling away. No matter how much they got on now, he wasn’t detached from reality enough to think it could ever happen.
He grabbed a plate with toast on it. He pulled the butter towards him and realized he needed a knife. Draco seemed to notice too, and passed him his. Harry nodded in thanks, exchanging it for a spoon for his soup.
Harry stuck his tongue out at him.
“Ginny and I broke up.” He closed his eyes, not knowing what he was going to say until it was said. But he was proud of the way his voice didn’t shake, no matter how hard his heart pounded. In all honestly, it felt
Malfoy looked at him, jaw set. Harry recognized that look – reminded him of bathroom mirrors, tears and lots of blood – and realized that Malfoy was
“But I believe you,” he said, shooting Harry a look that was obviously in reference to the banana bread.
Sensing his gaze, Malfoy scowled at him, which would have been more imitating if his cheeks weren’t puffed out from food. He looked like a grouchy rodent.
away.
Draco put on his reading glasses, charmed with brightness filters.
“Tattoos,” Malfoy corrected, not taking his eyes off the board. He frowned and switched two newspaper articles. To his surprise, Harry recognized one as the Quibbler.
“It works for the spare room and the front door. Tomorrow, I’ll spell the Floo to give you access.” He slid the key towards Harry, “Don’t lose it.”
The board was center of it all.
Malfoy didn’t respond, fists clenched and unclenched.
Harry coughed. They both turned, finding him under the doorway to the kitchen. Draco curious, Parkinson bored. Under their gaze, he felt undressed, even though that was ridiculous. They were eating breakfast at home!
When he looked up again, Malfoy was there – shutting the door to his room and pulling Harry into his apartment. The love bites were covered, and Harry felt like he could breathe again. But he doubted he could forget the image of them, burned in his mind with a soft hiss.
Draco leaned back, collapsing against the headboard, exhausted. He huffed out, “Isn’t Sleeping Draught supposed to give you
“You’re welcome.”
“Just lean against me, okay?”
There was only silence on the other line.
“Cupboard?” The question uttered so soft Harry almost doesn’t hear him.
As if hearing Harry’s thoughts, he looked away. “I need to do a spell, okay? For it to move the way I want it, too.”
And that realization lit a fire in his heart – one he wasn’t sure he wanted to douse, didn’t know if he could. He adjusted his glasses, “Thank you.”
“Mr. Potter,” the man across from him asked. “Dos this Hogwarts have cell service?”
“It’s whole different view,” Malfoy said, mouth slightly open as he stared at the moving people below.
house,” he pointed out, shoving past him to unlock the door.
“Couldn’t afford a second trip, Potter?”
Harry coughed, “I didn’t expect you to give it up so easily.”
“As long as small and can be on my shoulder,” he mocked, pushing the glasses up the bridge of his nose. Harry begrudgingly admitted to himself it was a good impression.
“Like you said, the world bigger than Hogwarts.”
He looked at Harry, out of breath, “I forgot. Give me a second.”
Silver earrings dangled from his ears. They glinted in the morning light, winking at Harry.
“I have a theory,” Malfoy said, uprooting a stubborn tomato plant. “About why we have so many plants.”
A tattoo covered most of his back – the ocean. The shoreline started mid-back, a huge moon setting above it, textured and glowing. Its waves fell and rose, creating beautiful ripples. Water droplets clung to his pale skin.
He titled his head. Harry watched as his eyelashes casts shadows across his face. And slowly, Malfoy reached out. His fingers ghosted over Harry’s cheek and grasped his chin. They both inhaled. His eyes drifted closed as he was pulled in – their lips
The other boy nodded.
Potter moved slowly, positioning himself next to Draco, body over the comforter.
Every movement hurt.
With stunning clarity, he was hit with where he was and who he was with.
“You can handle Ginevra, Potter.” Malfoy frowned, looking away. “I have an appointment. I’ll try to make it, though.”
The kitchen filled with sounds of silverware clinking against ceramic plates. They didn’t talk much, but Malfoy’s presence was strangely a comfort. He was a very expressive eater. Harry enjoyed this – if he could not decipher his expressions during conversations, at least he could tell if Malfoy liked a meal.
Harry stared, realizing that Malfoy
“We hardly know each other anymore,” Malfoy continued, snapping Harry out of it. “You’d be surprised at the stuff I do now.
As if summoned by her words, Malfoy looked over at him. Even from here, Harry could see his blown. It sent shivers through his body.
He took a couple of breaths before answering. He hadn’t meant to do that, to keep doing that. But with Malfoy, it happened again and again. He figured out how to pry Harry apart until all his secrets were gone –
He was entranced with the way his tongue glided across his teeth, the feeling strange and addicting.
Somehow, during their scuffle, the sky had filled with black clouds. There was a flash of lighting, a clap of thunder and finally, it poured. If they weren’t drenched before, they were now.
He looked outside to find the sky filled with splotches of yellow, orange and pink. His eyes felt heavy with tiredness, but he didn’t want to sleep.
“Tell me about your tattoos,” he said, gazing down at him. There was no filter here, but Harry reasoned that he rarely had a filter when it came to Draco.
this, the feeling going straight to Harry’s groin.
“Just trust me. And take off your shirt.”
Draco let out a long breath. “I do.”
Parkinson raised an eyebrow. “Sure, you weren’t.”
He nodded, “Of course.”
“You can call me Harry,” he said. They looked at each other, knowing this was a slight adjustment in a puzzle that already fit. But this fit better.
Harry took a deep breath, letting the secret uncurl slowly, unrushed. “Yeah, I do.”
He groaned, rolling out of bed. The chill of his apartment stung at his bare torso, goosebumps raising across his chest. No matter how the cold nipped at him, his tiredness kept him from turning around and grabbing a shirt.
He searched around the room. “The bed sheets, the mirror, my hands, the rug, my sweater in the closet,” he said, through gasps.
He had a different smile now, though. Curls at the end of his hair. A gentle touch, soft enough to weave masterpieces onto paper. Into skin. He wore reading glasses and snorted at dumb jokes with the same, sharp tongue. And understood Harry in the ways he wanted to be understood. He didn’t even do magic.
While his voice was light, the hint of honestly in his words was enough to suck the humor of the situation. And Harry did not know what to say. He glanced around the room, desperate for a distraction.
Even talking to Ginny felt good. She found him on the way to the bar, and they caught up like old friends. She was still beautiful, but his heart didn’t hurt at the sight of her anymore. Before she left to greet Luna, Ginny pulled him into a hug and whispered, “I’m so glad we can still be friends.”
At some point, he managed to fall asleep.
Draco was draped across the couch, leaning on Harry, another strange and addicting feeling. He smiled at Harry, teeth peeking out. Harry was close enough to see they were a little crooked.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked, turning his head to look at him, too tired to be embarrassed at their proximity.
So Harry huffed a laugh to himself and cut his losses, making his way out of the apartment.
Draco took his wand out from the cabinet and muttered various spells. Harry felt nothing but a cool sensation on his shoulder, welcome against the swollen skin.
Harry shrugged. He knew that Malfoy was only trying to get a rise out of him, but he considered it seriously.
Fists clenched Harry’s collar, the tips of his knuckles brushing at the sensitive skin of his neck, Malfoy glared him. “Truce?”
“You go first,” Harry said.
Draco did not like what she was implying. “I don’t get sick. Being sick is for children.”
“Soup’s ready.”
“We are going to kill each other,” he said.
. It greeted him like an old enemy and stubbornly clung to his heart, even in the best of situations.
It was Friday. And he was in the last meeting of the day. He had scheduled all parents’ meetings on one day, in hopes that it would somehow be better. But each dragged longer than the last.
Harry froze. That pretentious, drawling voice sent shivers through his body. It brought him back to Wizengamot, and before that, Hogwarts – two realities far away from where he was now.
And like magic (ha ha), a glint of light caught his attention. It was Malfoy, wearing those silver earrings again, moving through the crowd with purpose. He looked
all of a sudden and they were moving together, down the hall. His lower back knocked into some corner, a stack of papers may have fallen over. Harry wasn’t sure. He was too focused on Draco pulling down his trousers, and quickly moving to remove his own.
Draco blinked up at Harry, eyes dazed. “You want to know about the other one?”
“Harry!”
“Do you want to-”
When the beat switched, Pansy broke away. And it was only Malfoy and the stranger. Harry was reminded of the two love bites. His heart pounded in his ears.
He took it, slipping it between his pink lips. Watching Draco exhale smoke shouldn’t have been so bloody hot, but there it was.
Malfoy read the note his Patronus came back with. He couldn’t understand how Malfoy had been able to cast a
“It’s okay,” Malfoy whispered, gaze fixed on what was below. The people were recognizable from here. He could tell who was wearing what, their age – nothing like the dots that moved in random directions, how they looked from Malfoy’s rooftop.
When he tried to peek, Draco clutched it closer to his chest. “Can you just trust me?”
They greeted him politely, which was all Harry expected. Aside from them and a few new faces, he was greeted with warmth and excitement. So much to the point where Harry felt silly for forgetting how loved he was.
He agreed easily. Now that it had warmed up, being outside was more of a treat than a chore. The sunlight spilled onto the balcony like golden paint, the air was still a bit damp from dawn and from this view, their part of the city looked quite nice.
His lips twitched, “What? You didn’t like my drawings at Hogwarts?”
Malfoy’s apartment was bigger than Harry’s, but he could barely tell with all the
Malfoy looked at him in surprise, “Yeah, I am.”
Malfoy dropped his jaw dramatically. “I give you my basil and in return, you just insul-,”
Draco titled his head back and gasped.
When he was finally in bed alone, he had nothing to focus on but the pain. The fever had finally given into heat, but Draco still found himself shivering. He surrounded himself with pillows and burrowed into his clothing the best he could. Potter’s scent was all around him, the chamomile smell lulling him to sleep.
“I forgive you,” Draco said, pulling Harry back towards him. He intertwined their hands. “I forgive you.”
“Draco?” Hope dripped off his voice like honey.
Malfoy scrambled to his feet (“Don’t you
“Are you crazy? I’m telling you I can’t br-"
“It’s okay, Potter,” Malfoy said, sensing his unease. “Since when have our interactions been smooth?”
It had been two weeks since the laundry incident. Harry had done an amazing job of avoiding him up until this morning. When he came back from a run, Malfoy strolled into the lobby, two bags under his arms. He looked completely out of place by being in place. In his cashmere sweater and Oyster card in hand, he looked like he belonged in the Muggle world.
. Harry almost forgot to breathe.
He managed to slip out of his day clothes and into the ones Potter gave him. They were big, the waist nearly falling off, but Draco relished in the warmth. He hugged a spare pillow, willing the shivers to go away.
Draco toddled in, the old blanket around him. He offered a small, sleepy smile to Harry as he settled into the seat beside him. They stared at the window in silence, savoring the peace.
“Maybe,” Malfoy said, but then he sent Harry a wink. “Or not.”
“I don’t see you in the kitchen at all,” Harry admitted, offering a teasing smile.
But still, Harry could not decide which he preferred.
Harry nodded. “As long as it's something small and on my shoulder.”
“My first tattoo,” he whispered. “Worst decision I ever made.”
He was in the Manner again. Voldemort seared the Dark Mark on his arm, the burns ripping through every layer of his skin. He screamed at him to stop, but no one in the room seemed to hear him. Or see him. They continued to talk at the table, turned away from him. His mom wasn’t there, and his Dad held a wand to his throat. “Don’t you care about us?”
The words wrapped him up, warmth soaking into his body after a cold day. He looked at the man across from him.
(The tomato basil omelet was everything that he craved. And he found himself using the fresh basil in dinners throughout the week.)
Malfoy gasped. “Get out of my house!!”
Harry was in a good place. A safe place to call home. Had the best friends in the world. A fulfilling job. Check, check, check. Voldemort was dead. Check.
“But,” he added, quickly, softer this time. “But you are
“That’s because you are sick,” Potter replied, tugging the pillow away.
“Are you just going to repeat things I say?”
“Don’t worry about Pansy,” he said. “She likes to say random, pointless and vague things a lot of the time.”
When Potter left the room, Draco laid there in agony. He hadn’t been this sick since he was seven and his mother had been there to sing him to sleep, distracting him from the pain of his limbs. She wasn’t here anymore, though. She was off in France living the life she deserved to live.
On and on, Harry asked questions until Draco’s breathing evened out, his heart slowing to a normal pace.
“Why something at Hogwarts?”
to say it to someone who didn’t already know.
“Don’t need it, thanks,” he said, pointing at the banana bread. “You’re going to enjoy that.”
Finally, he exhaled slowly. The cold of Potter’s forehead against his felt good. He closed his eyes, not wanting to look at the green anymore.
The place they ended up – Harry couldn’t even remember the name now – was full of flashing lights and bodies. Easy to get lost in. He danced lazily in a semicircle with Ron and Hermione for the longest time. His cheeks were sore from laughter as he was reminded of why Hermione didn’t dance. (Not that Harry should be talking.)
that I can.”
“Yeah.” He looked at the sky, a bright blue. “I grew up with very bad people. And I think a lot of habits from before got stuck to me – liking small spaces, cooking when I don’t have to…”
“You don’t have to be the great Harry Potter anymore,” he said without hesitation, as if he expected the question. He plucked the cigarette out of his mouth, two slender fingers next to each other and offered it to Harry.
He was wrong about that. The ground lurched beneath him. He crashed to the ground, a burst of pain stinging his cheek. Somewhere in the background, dishes clashed together. When he opened his eyes again, Potter was above him, the back of his hand against his forehead. “Malfoy, you’re burning up.”
“I am creating a comprehensive timeline on the history of magical and muggle tattoos. And comparing the two to determine influence, if there is any,” he explained, words tumbling out like he had said them a thousand times. “At the same time, they are letting me do an apprenticeship to get my license.”
He glanced at Pansy, who nodded once, and pulled the man closer, giving him access to the long tilt of his neck. It was the three of them, moving to the beat of the music, tight against each other. Harry couldn’t look away.
When he was finally done, he wiped down Harry’s right shoulder, grazing his ribs lightly as he did. Shivers went down his spine. Draco noticed and started to trace his finger up and down Harry’s ribs.
Somewhere from his room, his phone rang. It had to be Ron, the only person he knew that actively used a Muggle phone. He dug through his bedsheets to find it.
Harry was on his fourth beer; Malfoy stopped at two and started smoking.
“He is..”
Draco could have cursed the boy for that, but knew he was right.
Harry heard the determined edge to his words, but also got the impression that Malfoy was quite sad. He bit his lip, wanting to comfort the proud boy, but not knowing the words to make it better.
Malfoy leapt into action, shoving Harry out of the room.
His curiosity begged him to sneak a glance at the mirror, but his anticipation kept him from doing so. Something thrilled him about knowing it was all in Draco’s hands.
Despite the expression, his eyes were lit, the same way they lit up when he raced for the Snitch. Harry felt a burst of pride in his chest, affirming the taste of his omelets.
Harry ignored this, choosing to indulge in half-truths instead. “You had a sunburn in my dream.”
been quicker.
Harry tried to recall the last time he had seen it, but couldn’t. He shrugged at Malfoy, whose nose was pressed up against the glass, trying to peer into the apartment. Harry followed his gaze and sure enough, the key and their wands sat patiently on the living room table.
Harry leaned in, moving slowly, giving Draco time to push away. Instead, he shifted up and pushed his face closer, their lips grazing. He
“Harry?” Maybe the delicate thing was Malfoy.
“And girls.”
But Draco was not looking at him. He stared out the window, rubbing vigorously at his forearm. Draco did this, wore long sleeves and unconsciously held his arms in place so that no one would see his mistake.
A man broke away from the background bodies, slotting himself against Malfoy’s back. He had a silver cross necklace that matched Malfoy’s earrings. Malfoy noticed, giving him a sultry smirk.
He looked Potter, sitting there, prettier than a picture. He dressed like an old man, which shouldn’t have been as charming as it was – sweaters, elbow patches and worn jeans. They were always suspiciously filled with holes. But instead of frumpy, it made him look like everyone’s best friend. He smiled a lot too, genuine smiles that lit up his eyes. The world was unfair in so many ways.
“Hey, how are you feeling?” He wandered back into the kitchen and unwrapped the banana bread.
“You’re scared of heights?” Harry asked.
. (“It wouldn’t work anyway,” he said, rolling his eyes. “It’s called security, Potter.”)
Harry didn’t know what to make of that fact, a strange feeling overcoming him. He ignored it, in favor of latching onto a certain word. He smirked, “Loved?”
Harry nodded.
Two red splotches appeared on Malfoy’s cheekbones.
Harry rolled his eyes. The fridge was organized based on color. Odd, but efficient. He found the bundle quickly and split it in half. His stomach rumbled in anticipation.
When he finished the meal, Potter held out his palm. In it, two small capsules. Muggle medicine. Draco sank his chair, “Can’t I just take a potion? I hate those things.”
“Neighbors."
He stood to go to the Floo, but Draco grabbed at his arm, “Don’t tell Granger I’m sick.”
The months slipped in and out of his grasp and before Harry knew it, spring had become summer. The humidity made his hair stand tiredly. It also made the pipes leak. And parts of the wall to fall off.
Harry opened the door, revealing a fully dressed Malfoy. He blinked sleepily at him, “Do you have a place to be this early? Or do you sleep in stuffy clothes?”
Harry looked at the hose in his hand and then, back at Malfoy. They locked eyes, coming to the same realization.
The next weekend, he came back from his morning run to find a plant at his door. The smell confirmed it as basil. With a closer look, he noticed a folded piece of paper in the soil. There were large black letters written over small font text. It read:
Harry remembered with a pang, apologetic for saying the wrong thing again. Something really bothered him about stumbling through this conversation, even if it was Malfoy.
He smiled smugly before heading out. Harry stared after him and shook his head.
At one point, the Floo went off, and then, the shower.
“Yeah, I’ll do that,” he choked out before rushing out of the apartment.
because he
Draco shook his head, grinning.
Then, the pressure on his eyes lifted and he was met with the image of Draco wrapping his arms around Pansy’s waist, both shaking with laughter. The light caught in his hair for a moment, his smile wide.
He didn’t answer, but they both knew the truth.
Malfoy blinked, “I know.”
The boy snorted, “My probation won’t let me, even if I wanted to.”
Draco rose his head up, suddenly. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, afraid he would address this thing between them. Instead, he asked, “Do you want a tattoo?”
Harry knew the space was small, but it felt even smaller as he sat across from Malfoy.
Draco made a face at Pansy and shook his head. He paused for a second before smushing a palm against his face, covering his glasses.
“Yeah,” he said, the sun shining in his hair. “My reason is different than yours.”
Draco felt like he was in Hogwarts all over again, his heart preening at every ounce of attention Potter gave him, good or bad. He knew that this wasn’t the best decision to make, but it felt good.
“Live here, too,” he said, slowly. He brought the tips of his hands together. “That makes us neighbors.”
Harry moved to the client chair, laying on his stomach. The leather was cold against his cheek. And while he wasn't sure what he was doing, but it never felt more right.
Harry’s lips twitched. It was surprisingly easy to see Hermione and Malfoy, surrounded by books and tea mugs, comparing theories. Their research must have overlapped at one point; Harry imagined tattoos were radical movements within themselves.
Malfoy continued, staring out towards the rain. “And the world is so much bigger than Hogwarts, you know?”
Eventually, Potter sighed, “Okay, just go to bed. If you’re not feeling better by the morning, you should take these.” He collapsed them back into his palm. “I’ll ask Hermione if she has any Sleeping Draught or Pepper-Up’s for the morning.”
He liked boys, the realization sinking low into his gut. The image of silver earrings flashed in his head, but he ignored it. For now, this was all he could handle.
The boy broke eye contact, suddenly looking at the sky. He held out a hand, “Fuck.”
The boy turned his head. “Oh, my client chair. That’s where I do tattoos.”
Guilt gnawed at his heart. His 11-year-old self would have spit in his face.
silently thanking Potter for making most of the meals. “It
“Yeah?”
When life inevidentably got busy, he saw them less and less. While he wasn’t so fragile, the loneliness grew
And proceeded to shake his head at every single thing Harry said after that. He didn’t want to be a burden, it was really okay, it’s only the bathroom wall that was falling out, he couldn’t make him do that.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, voice shaking. The wizard faded into dust. Draco gasped at the fragments, trying to shove them together again, but he was gone. And so was the wand. But his hands were still outstretched.
“Are you okay?”
“You’re in the CLASS program,” Harry said, everything clicking into place.
Goosebumps broke out along his shoulders. “Potter, I’m cold,” he whined, grasping at the sheets for solace. He had forgotten how
Finally, he sighed. “After the whole…,” He gestured vaguely to Harry. “My father went to Azkaban and kept sending these cryptic letters to me and my mother and I just…” He ran a hand through his hair. “I didn’t want to do it anymore. So, when Pans mentioned CLASS, I applied.”
She stole his place in line and threw down the powder with a wink.
He made himself smaller, hugging his legs close and burrowing into the jumper. But he didn’t request to go back inside.
“But you didn’t,” Malfoy said, a strange glint in his eyes. Harry almost mistook it for pride.
“You don’t like taking care of things?” He aimed the hose towards the newly planted on the ground.
“Okay,” Draco mumbled, already lost in his sketchbook. Harry watched him in silence, entranced with the way his fingers shifted the pencil over the paper.
At first, he thought it was because Malfoy was good at words. Always writing and reading and re-writing. But now, he had a new theory: he was just good with Harry, saw him in the way he longed to be seen.
A girl jumped his arms. From the dark red nails and even darker lipstick, Harry guessed it was Parkinson. She gave him a lazy grin as he set her back down and they started to dance. Their bodies melted together like they meant to. They were easy, practiced motions – the rotation of his hips against hers. When they laughed, Malfoy’s teeth peeked out from his lips. Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
He looked at Harry, amused. “I live here.”
He bit his lip, “Did I do that?”
Harry knocked at Malfoy’s apartment, ready for the pancakes he was promised. Malfoy answered the door with his hair stuck up and pajama shirt unbuttoned. Two love bites prominent on his right collarbone. Based on their sheen, they were fresh.
Harry nodded.
“You were my first real crush back then,” he continued, speaking over Harry’s shock. “You were the first and look how terribly I treated you – look how I treated the things I love. Thank Merlin, I didn’t realize what it was then. It wouldn’t have been good for either of us.”
The other man eyed him suspiciously. “What is it?”
“This hardly counts as a balcony,” Malfoy replied. They had just climbed out from the bedroom window, onto the small space. It was surrounded by neighboring apartments jutting out further than Harry’s.
Neighbors to roommates. The transition was easy, comfortable even. Malfoy was a good housemate – he washed the dishes, baked desserts and was never particularly loud. Mostly, he sat around reading and sketching. To Harry’s surprise, he even limited the mess to his bedroom and the client chair in the living room.
“I know what it means, Malfoy!” Harry cried. “I’m just surprised.”
They had been kissing for a while now. Long enough for the sky to turn blue. On his lap, Draco pulled away for air, a string of salvia connecting them. He stared at it in disgust, breathing heavy. But Harry could not have been any more turned on. He leaned in again.
“It’s for the plants,” he said, when Harry mentioned it, because of course it was. He appreciated the article-free bathroom, regardless.
"Check on me, you said. Everything to your satisfaction?"
Draco didn’t understand why there was anything
family.
“It’s fine. I enjoyed watching you work: you’re so… focused."
“You’ve spent the last half hour telling me how fragile he is, how you never really knew him before, how scared he seems of everything.” Hermione stopped, letting a short man with two dogs pass by. She prodded Harry in the chest. “You, Harry James Potter, are the one who’s scared. You’ve been playing it just as safe as Draco ever has done.”
Something changed – Harry changed angle, or maybe his cock was doubling in size because it felt so huge and wonderful, dragging and rubbing Draco on the inside, over and over and then, then, he was doing it in the right place and Draco couldn’t see the tree anymore. He was a blaze of light and he would explode with it, and then Harry thrusted and then—
broke Draco’s concentration. The internal workings of his toaster were laid out on the table, light glinting from the lamp angled onto them. He was loath to look away in case he forgot what went where, but the tapping didn’t stop. Draco pulled up the blinds and saw an owl, eyes wide and black but feathers bedraggled, huddled on the stairs leading down from the street. He frowned. It was rare to be visited by an owl, as most of his friends would Floo and his mother had the house-elves post letters, all in deference to his living in a Muggle area.
But now he had lived enough of a life since the war that he could also have anxiety dreams about completing reports on time, or getting lost in the archives room. Some dreams made him happy – the one he had woken from had been of the Great Hall at Hogwarts, ready for Christmas. Lights twinkled, mulled wine flowed, and the tables were heaped with mince pies and turkey and shiny red Christmas crackers.
Draco considered this. He could imagine Granger aiming for the top job, then learning every single thing she needed to get it. Would she make a good Minister? He hated to admit it, but she probably would.
Teddy climbed on the back of the sofa, then slid down between them, breaking the connection.
“Five,” muttered Harry.
When Henry returned from his chickens, Draco had made one more basket, its sides a little uneven, but slightly more basket-like than his first attempt. By the time the sky had turned a soft lilac, a dozen small baskets of varying sizes sat on the table. Each finger on Draco’s hands ached from obstinate spokes and spring reeds, the separate aches amounting to a pulsing and tired ball of pain. Draco also had a scratch across the back of his left hand he didn’t remember getting, but he sat back in satisfaction nonetheless.
Draco raised an eyebrow, but sat down neatly.
“Me too,” said Harry. “Me too.”
The shifts in Malfoy’s moods were tricky to follow. Or rather, Harry was having difficulty adjusting to the fact that this was
“A former lover,” Draco said quietly. “So… so it wasn’t because I was a Death-Eater, then?”
“Scared, Potter?” It was the echo of so many schoolboy taunts, but this time the voice was deeper, the words laced with suggestion. A different challenge to any offered at Hogwarts.
Harry started to walk again, and Draco hurried to catch up. “What do you mean, the men’s pond?”
He had watched, discreetly, as Potter, Weasley, and Granger talked. They talked about plans for the future, about where they wanted to travel to, about magic they wanted to learn.
“Something like that.” Draco sat up, leaning against the pillows and headboard and looking down at the mess of black hair and green eyes, looking back up at him. Harry’s pink tongue peeked out, and Draco inhaled shakily as Harry swept it around the head of his cock. But as warm and thrilling as Harry’s touch was, it was the look he gave him that rooted Draco to the spot and stole his breath. Fierce possession mingled with a softness that was nothing to do with sex, and Draco knew he was lost.
“So you saw Potter?” Pansy said. She sat perfectly still and focused all her attention on him. Draco was unnerved by her calm. Surely she should be reaching for a cigarette, or something? They were in her living room, the drinks cabinet within reach and an open bottle of wine sitting between them. Draco shifted in his seat.
Malfoy spent a long time checking the room over: apparently the 'bashing' had resulted in small leaks and spillages, with sections of half-cursed carpet and cabinet alike. Harry's room, even with the destroyed bed at its centre, took less time.
A knock at the door disturbed Draco. Rather than being startled though, he looked up knowing it would be Potter. He wasn’t disappointed to see the usual scruffy hair and messy clothes. It appeared that Potter had managed to restock his egg supply since he’d last visited.
“Oh, I’m sure both of you are perfectly innocent in all this. But perhaps some word of the violin’s existence made its way out…” She paused, her meaning clear.
“I… I can’t work out what you’re doing here,” Harry said, his frustration in every word. “Why come here? It’s smelly and miserable - I’m bloody freezing now - and the last time we were both here one of your friends died in this room!”
"So," he said. "Bowtruckles?"
Harry wondered if the offer would be open to Daphne if she turned up with Hermione. He looked over at the two of them with their pile of books. Probably, he decided. Daphne was so serious about her studies that she seemed to be treated differently to the other Slytherins, like an honorary Ravenclaw, and Hermione had been getting on with her and Lisa since they had been sharing a room.
At lunch the next day, Harry snuck off to find Pansy. He smiled as she sipped some hideous green smoothie, which he was fairly certain contained some kind of health grass. She certainly didn't smoke anymore; now she was the first to hiss at anyone wafting smoke too close to her.
Draco’s face closed down a little. “Back out there… I think it will be harder than here. For me. For you…” He sighed. “The world is a different place for you.”
She shook her head again. “In a few weeks you will no longer be my concern.” She paused. “For the rest of term, should the room be judged safe, and you unharmed, then I think you can keep using it. And once you are no longer students here, if you want to visit this space maybe we can arrange something.” She sighed. “Although for Merlin’s sake, no more sneaking around. If you want to return here after you leave Hogwarts, you are to ask my permission, understood?”
When they pulled back from each other, Harry gave Draco a wry smile. "You look like you might fall asleep standing there."
As they filed out of class the excited chatter grew in volume. Some students stayed back to talk to McGonagall, but Harry and Ron left with the others.
Malfoy looked shocked. “I’m not getting into bed with you.”
. And maybe Malfoy would rather be alone for a while. But Harry really was tired.
He shrugged off the worry. It didn’t matter why they were there. He was back at Hogwarts, with a warm bed, good food, and a chance to rest. For once he could relax.
“We’re not about to start hexing each other like children, are we?”
“Sometimes it’s just nice to be warm and safe,” Lavender said.
“Words I never thought I’d hear you say.”
Harry was pretending to listen to Ernie as he talked through his latest case. Almost two weeks had passed since the wild magic case had been closed, and Harry had tried to throw himself into his work in an attempt not to think about Malfoy. He wanted to see Malfoy again, but just couldn't seem to build the courage to contact him. So much for being a heroic Gryffindor.
“Don’t say that!” Harry stepped forward.
Harry heard Draco’s head move on the pillow. “Really?”
The owl deposited a tightly rolled scroll into Draco’s hand and tilted its head at him.
Malfoy sighed. "Kreacher follows your orders because he likes and respects you, but today he was happy to follow mine just because my name is embroidered on a bit of fabric upstairs."
“Maybe I’ll give it a go,” Harry said, hating himself for sounding so magnanimous when all he was doing was finding an excuse to talk to Draco.
“I’m sure I can work something out.”
“Why would you want to help me?” Draco viewed her with suspicion. He’d almost killed her husband once – had she forgotten?
Harry could feel the cold floor, but he could also feel a building nervous roil in his stomach as he thought about the extra wand in his pocket. He’d waited this long, he couldn’t wait any longer. He wasn’t a Gryffindor - or former Gryffindor, whatever it was he was now - for nothing. “I think I’m going to cast a Warming Charm. Shall I do you, too?” There was a slight wobble in his voice that he hoped Malfoy hadn’t noticed.
Harry gritted his teeth against his frustration that he should have listened to Malfoy, and nodded. It was good advice.
Hurt stung Harry’s throat for a second that Ron needed to ask, but then Harry thought back to his time in the Room with Draco the day before, and it eased. He nodded.
“Is ‘getting dirty’ a profession?”
“Someone got married?”
Instantly, Potter sprang back as though burned. A heavy warmth remained where his hands had been. Draco flexed his toes, but nothing seemed untoward.
"I…" He turned, to tell Potter that he didn’t want to leave, that he wished it continue like this forever, with no autumn, or winter, or spring, that it could instead be an endless summer. Potter though, was already looking at him, his eyes full of sun and shadow. The words died on Draco’s lips, and he was conscious that they were standing close to each other. Too close. He stared back, and then wrenched his eyes away. "I’ll be out of your hair soon."
“I bet you say that to all the boys.” Draco was trembling.
“Well, he’s not here anymore. Thank you for that, by the way.”
"I… I met someone, while I was out there." Draco pointed at his leg. "The one who healed this."
Potter’s elbow jabbed him again, and this time it wasn’t his own wand he pulled out, but Draco’s. Draco hadn’t seen his wand since… he didn’t want to think about that night.
Harry nodded, his heart a bit heavier at lying to Draco.
“You’ve changed,” Susan said, after a few seconds when she was silent, her brow furrowed.
“I’m fine,” Potter said. “Really, I am.”
A strange thrill passed through Harry at the idea of Malfoy at a Weasley Sunday lunch. Malfoy with
Potter’s face broke into a smile, and, despite himself, Draco smiled back.
“I didn’t feel well, needed some fresh air.”
The golden light of a summer’s sunset filled their bedroom. Harry and Draco were both naked on the bed, and the sight made Harry’s breath catch.
As they left, Harry felt something in the room shift. He turned around, and saw Draco do the same. The lights were perhaps a little dimmer, but the room looked unchanged. It felt though, like a caress, or perhaps a farewell. It was no longer theirs alone.
“You’re one of the family, it’s not letting you stay. It’s your home.”
“But Gin—“
Draco very much doubted that Potter’s memories were anything like his own, and he shivered. “Well, charming as this meeting has been, I fear it’s nearing its close. You need to find out who had the chance to touch the Snitch or be alone with it, and any moments before the match when either of those would have been possible. And remember, I’d quite like to have the opportunity to examine the Snitches myself, even though your boss doesn’t quite share the same ‘gut instincts’ that you do.”
“Chicken coconut curry.”
“What if everyone hates me?” Harry mumbled, words overlapping together, tumbling out of his mouth without permission. If you give a man a secret, he should take care of it.
Harry brought it up to Malfoy during lunch.
He exhaled. And for a moment, he let himself feel it, leaning into the hand in his hair. The feeling washed over him and soaked into his body, snitching something warm and solid in his chest. It was beautiful, liberating even, to pretend that he was loved by Harry Potter.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I don’t think so, darling.”
In hindsight, Harry wasn’t sure who made the first move. He just knew they were both filled with this hot, visceral
in the pit of his stomach.
And suddenly, Harry felt like crying.
“Thank you,” Harry whispered as he threw himself in Draco’s arms. Warm arms wrapped around him, pulling him closer.
in the same spot, quill tucked behind her ear, curls put into a large bun on the top of her head.
“What!?”
Harry was not. It was subtle, but Harry knew both Hermione and Ron avoided the topic of Malfoy (all Slytherins, really) in front of him. Even though Malfoy was in the same program as Hermione and Pansy worked often with Ginny. Lines softened over the last five years, completely crossed in some places. But Harry gladly ignored the progress, pretending to not see it.
Sometimes, they did this. Their words knocked into each other, rhythms off. Conversations felt a bit like hands clasping together without the fingers aligned properly. Not wrong, just off.
“You’re in front of
Silence fell as they leaned into each other like that. Outside, there was music coming from a neighboring balcony. Harry was floating.
Malfoy joked, “Pansy is going. You got already your token Slytherin.”
“You don’t have brain cancer, Malfoy,” Granger said, as they both waited for the Floo. “Your body is probably mad at you had
“Instead of gathering a Dark Army?” he asked dryly, raising an eyebrow.
The Foundation was Harry’s pride and joy. It was a center for Muggleborns and Half-Bloods that provided resources for the kids and parents instead of just being thrust in Magical society, like Harry was. (He didn’t even know how to get onto the platform!) The fact that these resources hadn’t existed before reminded Harry of how flawed Magical society was, even beyond Voldemort.
He regretted deeply why he hadn’t chased after him and explained the situation to him properly. But there was not turning back now.
“What do you want, Potter.” The blond-haired boy snarled, clearly, Malfoy didn’t expect Harry to find him.
“Because it’s wrong to talk about anyone like this behind- “Hermione was cut short when all three of them heard a loud crash from the pillar behind Harry.
The answer was no.
Pansy chuckled, “I knew you were the right person for this.”
“Shhhh” Madam Prince hushed them as Harry, Hermione and Ron walked into the library. He was devastated, what could he tell his best friends. That Malfoy loved him for more than four years and accidentally confessed to him?
HOW COULD HE?
“Just tell me what last night was all about, and I’ll leave you alone!” Harry couldn’t stand this any longer as he shouted.
However, this was not what Draco had expected.
But he has his friends and reputation to think about…
“On your marks, bow, turn around, and three, two, one—begin!”
It’s the first, and last time he’d be doing this, but this could be his chance, to have a taste of freedom just before he has to crawl back into his cage.
As he reached the wall, he concentrated on one thing: Malfoy.
Draco shook his head.
“We’ll make him pay.”
“Mate, I know you hate Malfoy, just tell Hermione how wrong she is! That prick will always be a pain in the ass!”
He carefully opened the window, as the owl was not familiar and looked pretty fierce. It’s eyes pierced into Harry’s, it sent shivers down his spine. But then the contact broke as the owl flew in casually, landing on the perch made of sticks next to Harry’s trunk. And from those two seconds of eye contact Harry knew that whoever’s owl this was, they must have trained it well.
“Haha…yeah…They probably hate him for even touching them already…” Draco heard his heart break.
Another reason.
Potter wasn’t here yet.
“Go away *hic* Ethan *hic*,” Draco mumbled; he wasn’t in the mood to deal with all these flirts. Yes, Draco was gay, not just for Potter, but men in general, of course, he hadn’t dared to tell anyone except for Blaise and Pansy yet.
Harry groaned, knowing he would be in another one of Malfoy’s stupid insult matches. He glanced towards his right, eyes pleading for Hermione and Ron to help, he does not have time for this, he still had a potions essay and DADA project to finish before Friday.
Did Potter really hate him that much?
“YOU WHAT?!” A very furious Pansy screamed.
Harry sighed, it sounded easy enough in his head, but actually trying to get Draco Malfoy to sit down and talk civilly over a cup of tea was like trying to get an Outstanding in potions with Snape around.
“Oh, so now you’re pretending nothing happened after running from this whole morning?” He just couldn’t help it, the anger and magic lashed out at the boy in front of him.
Draco was going to end this once and for all, he was going to tell Potter to fuck off and never bother him again, forget about him, and focus on his mission—
Draco froze in his tracks.
Harry could only do so much as not pounce on Malfoy as he turned white, green, then pink.
There were exceptions of course, including the other members of the silver trio and Harry himself. He made a note that Hermione doesn’t look as shocked as the others, instead, she turns to Harry expectantly.
Draco had insisted that he stayed in London, he has his own reasons, but Narcissa couldn’t handle the horrid memories of the war, so Draco had let her move to France.
He watched as Draco made his way to the other side, a sign that he’ll never be free from his wrong choices. The despair on his face made it so unbearable for Harry, as he knows that it was not the right time He watched as all his friends mourned his death, he’d never forget the hopeless look on Hagrid’s face as he carried Harry into the Hogwarts grounds. And Neville, oh Neville. No one was as brave as that boy, standing up to Voldemort, pulling the sword of Gryffindor and letting it shine as the last hope for all goodness.
At the statement, Harry froze, utterly petrified. This time he knows for a fact that Parkinson did this on purpose. This was evident by the horrified look on Malfoy’s face as he resisted the urge to drink. Harry blamed Malfoy if they were discovered.
Harry smirked, his eyes gazing upon Malfoy, the game was charmed, and they would move on their own if they’d done it.  At first, Harry was glad that no one could cheat, meaning that they might get some blackmail material from the Slytherins, but as soon as Hannah Abbot said her turn, Harry almost immediately regretted his decision to come.
Hex after hex was flown across the room, Draco didn’t know how long it’d been, but now they were dangerously close to each other. They were a metre apart and the spells were getting ridiculous. Tickling hexes, lip-locking jinks, Draco even sent a slug vomiting hex somewhere.
“Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy, I repeat, please come up to demonstrate the proper way of wizarding duelling.” Professor Snape said, annoyance lacing his voice.
Blaise looked at him with something disgusting that represents sympathy.
“Uh-uh, not so fast.” Millicent interrupted, “Changing the topic is not very Slytherin, Draco.”
“Spit it out, Draco, don’t keep us waiting.” Another voice snickered next to her, which she remembered from her snogging sessions, it indeed belonged to none other than Blaise Zabini.
They stepped outside the classroom, breathed in the fresh air, and Draco glared at Potter one last time before heading off to the boy’s bathroom to have the best wank of his life.
But it never came.
“Harry you got to speak louder; I don’t read minds you know.” Hermione reminded, in case her thick-headed friend forgot.
Harry didn’t expect anyone to not notice their argument. But merlin curses him—out of everybody of Hogwarts, it had to be bloody Malfoy who heard their insults. Especially when it was directed towards him, plus, Harry can’t even say if their relationship is just a snip of emotions. And now he’s ruined all chances with him.
“You won’t believe what just had happened!” An excited voice rang through her skull, for the second time.
“Potter I’m serious, stop it,” Malfoy growled under his breath.
“I’m not!”
“With what?” Potter looked cornered.
Draco’s brain tells him to run, leap out of the window, escape as fast as possible. But his instincts argued against it. Part of him wanted to never see the man again, but another part craved the man’s presence.
Who knows, time just seems to fly by when Potter’s involved.
Startled, Draco turned around so abruptly that he tripped over a broom that was lying uncivilly on the ground, falling right into Potter’s awaiting arms.
Draco screamed inside his head but fought the urge to say it in Potter’s face.
“Yeah.” It wasn’t a lie though; he just didn’t know all. Of course, he wanted to know what Malfoy had meant the night before, but the person himself doesn’t seem to want to admit Harry’s existence.
“Then what is it? I can change if you don’t like it!”
Except that no sound came out.
“This is NOT something you can just shush up Draco Lucius Malfoy.” She said sternly, “You’re telling me that last night you go drunk, Potter walked into you and pretended that he was someone else, you believed him and rambled to him about everything?!”
“Oh.”
“Nothing.” Draco simply shrugged.
The smarter one continued, as her friend doesn’t seem to understand what she meant.
He watched as his limp body laid in the forbidden forest, the death eaters laughing, Narcissa Malfoy standing over him and announcing his death. Harry couldn’t have been more grateful. Then there was the dream or heaven. King Cross station in white fluffy clouds, the shivering body beneath the bench, and what Dumbledore had said.
Harry was sweating by now, Hermione wasn’t being any help by looking at him with a knowing look in her eyes.
“Flying isn’t the only thing a broom can do, Malfoy. Unless you want to sweep the floor with your expensive robes, I suggest you shut up.” Potter said, with his back still towards Draco.
“…that’s actually really cool, Malfoy,” he said, wincing at the breathlessness in his voice. “And unexpected.”
Harry wanted to say, but Malfoy knew that. He must have.
He nodded again, a slow smile stretching his lips. “Harry.”
But then, he felt it.
fevers could be.
“Is – how did you –,” Two lovebites on his freckled collarbone. “Boys. You like boys.”
“I-I…,” Harry exhaled, aching to stop the tremble of his voice. Tears stung at the corner of his eyes.
Draco looked at him, eyes unreadable, before he turned back to the wooden floor beneath them. Silence blossomed between them. As usual, Draco tipped him over.
“Can you keep a secret?”
,” he gestured between them, “…when I’m returning the favor.”
“Sometimes,” Malfoy said, tone light again. “Depends on the customer.”
He was met with silence.
year. And despite not seeing the performance, Harry thought it was spot-on and started to laugh.
In a black turtleneck with a beige cardigan and chinos, he crossed his arms. “These are actually quite comfortable.”
Draco leaned into him again. The mix of peppermint and weed invaded his nostrils.
“I do like boys,” Malfoy repeated, hands maneuvering metal to light a fire. Strands of hair floated dangerously close to the flame as he lit a new cigarette. “Do you?”
“Change into these and rest while I make some soup, okay?” he said, placing the clothes on Draco’s chest.
Harry remembered, still pretending he needed a reason to come over.
“You-you…live…?” His brain short-circuited. Malfoy did not live in a Muggle apartment building.
“Trip to the homeland.”
Interest sparked, he asked, “What is your masters on?”
Malfoy tilted his head onto his shoulder, peering at Harry as he put out the cigarette. The bright red morphing into a dull orange and finally disappearing. “…know what?”
Draco let out a soft snort, “I will settle for forgiveness.”
Potter’s hands moved from his shoulders to Draco’s hands, dragging them away from his chest. “Hey, can you tell me five things are that are white in this room?”
“I’m surprised that you know what
The pressure was feather light, like he was waiting for something. But Harry was done waiting.
He saw Malfoy on the weekdays now. Only on that first Monday, he realized that they only hung out on the weekends. But now, Harry got to witness a whole new side of the man.
“I wasn’t allowed to do magic for a while,” he said, hands fidgeting. “And I guess I got used to it.”
just once.
Soft conversation floated from the room to Harry. He tried to block it out, the sweet tones of Malfoy’s voice, the fact that he was capable of that. The man came out again, brilliantly dressed (because of course, that is Malfoy’s type), and nodded at Harry before disappearing into the elevator. Harry hovered in the doorway, suddenly unsure of where he belonged, as if he ever knew.
He whipped around to confirm. Unfortunately, his waist twisted faster than his torso, sending his clothes flying in the air and body into the ground. He groaned at the burst of pain coming from the back of his head. His glasses were askew, but it was a blessing. That way he did not have to witness that
Before he could react, Malfoy was there – quick hands twisting the hose into Harry’s face, spraying his glasses. But even with water droplets skewing his vision, Harry fought. They grappled for control. The furious shoves and elbow jabs sent the hose into the air, several feet away. It landed on the ground, casting short-lived rainbows left and right.
He came to a decision. In one swift movement, he leapt off the couch and whipped off his jacket, exposing pale muscle. Harry shamelessly stared, noting the dimples near his waist.
They were on Malfoy’s massive balcony, moving the seedlings outdoors. He was determined to finish today and had enlisted Harry’s help.
Tears stung at his eyes, “Me too.”
smirk he knew was waiting for him.
“I don’t think I am meant to be happy,” he answered.
Malfoy gave him a look then, that weird look again.
When he finally got there, all the machines were taken. He sighed, looking for a spare table. Someone behind him cleared their throat.
“I-I’m not really good with words…”
Harry was not quite awake, but not asleep. Filled with restlessness, he listened to the sound. It reminded him of the beach, and then, of the lapping waves on the freckled expanse of Malfoy’s back. Two love bites contrasted against a pale collarbone. He bit his hand, feeling heat pool between his legs.
That sent weird, confusing heat throughout Harry’s body.
Harry was rubbish at washing spells. But doing it the Muggle way was almost just as much trouble. It was partly his fault for procrastinating and letting it pile up, but it was also the building’s fault for making the laundry room so far away.
“With Hermione,” he continued. She loved the program.
“I don’t want to get up,” he said, clinging to the pillow further. “I’m not hungry.”
They sat under the awning, watching the plants dance happily in the downpour. The same could not be said about the planters. Harry shivered. Along with the rain, the temperature dropped. He tried not to lean into the warmth of Malfoy’s shoulder provided.
decision, one that made sense, but it didn’t leave him any less raw.
And Harry finally found his opportunity to make those love bites.
“Well, it is not a balcony. Those have railings.”
The man looked at him, sensing his gaze, “Sorry, mate. I’ll be out in a second.”
When Dean mentioned a nearby club, everyone was excited. Harry agreed easily, not wanting the night to end yet.
But then, he noticed it on his left forearm. “Is that-?”
They made eye contact again. If Draco kept looking at him like that, Harry might say something stupid.
A loud bang came from nearby construction. Malfoy squawked and pressed himself further against the wall. “Merlin’s
Harry caught his gaze. He stared for a moment before giving him a nod and walking off. A simple, but polite interaction. And if it were anyone but Malfoy, Harry wouldn’t be bothered at all. But it was him. He rolled his eyes, mood soured.
Harry remembered Hermione, curled on the couch, reading through a thick packet with the same small font, a wrinkle between her eyebrows.
Harry snickered, remembering the image of cartoon portrait of himself being shocked by lightning over and over. It was terrible then, but so incredibly
He let out a quiet moan, “Fucking Malfoy.”
He caught Malfoy’s eye then, the silver warm and melting, moonlight reflecting, dripping heat on him. A spark of wonder. The rush that went through Harry fed something inside him.
“Wizards don’t really like coming here,” he said, eyes on the ground. Harry inwardly groaned as the awkwardness returned. He could handle the banter, but not this.
would sound. Two love bites, a grip over those shoulders, close enough to count the freckles.
Maybe that was it. Harry stared at the boy, the sharp angles of his face softened by his large gray jumper. The tips of his fingers peaked out from the holes in the sleeves and his hair curled at the ends. “Yeah, it is.”
Harry raised an eyebrow, “I’m still not allowed to see it? Even when it’s about to go on my body?”
They were high, the good type. No paranoia, only happy feelings.
connected.
“Yeah, this is it.”
“And you let me into your apartment,” he said, rooting around the pantry. There was a pink flush across the back of his neck. When he found the flour and turned around, Harry noted there was also a dusting of it along his cheeks.
Malfoy gave him a weird look, but it vanished as Harry placed an omelet in front of him. He accepted the fork and knife he was given and took a bite. Harry watched for his reaction.
The man sighed, “Blaise will be here in an hour.”
And he was not far off.
In his periphery, he could feel the tomatoes and cheese stare at him too. It was not in a kind way.
Harry settled for his neck, nuzzling it back and forth. “It was only one kiss.”
“…If you’re sure, mate.”
He got separated from them and found Dean and Seamus, who were admittedly better dancers. The crowd swallowed them up and he was alone again. He swayed left and right to vibrations of the club, absolutely giddy that loneliness hadn’t shown up. Instead, he just belonged, belonged, belonged.
Somehow, he was even more put-together on the weekdays. Blazers, three-piece suits, trousers that fit stupidly well. His hair was combed in a way that reminded Harry of Hogwarts.
He rolled his eyes at the dramatics of the note. But the fond grin formed on his face, regardless.
Slowly, he shuffled towards the elevator with a stack of plastic baskets, blocking his vision.
Since that day, things were the same, but felt different to Harry. It bothered him by how much he thought about it. Harry had meant it then; he didn’t have any problems with Malfoy being gay or bi or anything that involved kissing boys. But it stirred up his feelings, and ran through his head daily. And Harry had no idea why.
That Malfoy never made Harry feel this impossible, embarrassing
Harry tossed him an old blanket. The man wrapped it around himself before he flopped onto the couch again. Harry handed him the joint they shared.
happy. And the truth was they weren’t when they were together.
He pulled on a jumper and ran out of his apartment before he could talk himself out of it. Only when he was in front of the door, staring at his flipflops, he remembered the possibility of Malfoy rejecting him. This would lead to a fight because it was Malfoy and it always led to a fight.
A part of him wanted to ask about the Dark Mark, trapped underneath the skin of his left forearm. But Draco’s breathing had grown even in his ear. He reached out, tracing the nape of his neck, staring at his peaceful expression.
He glared at the board. “That ugly thing is my thesis.”
Harry had no doubt, but asked anyway, “Like what?”
Beside him, Potter had on an amused smile. “You’re welcome, Malfoy.”
Harry glanced around the apartment. It was only boxes now, but it had plenty of sun and space. Fourth house, second home. Maybe third. Even if he never officially lived in the Burrow, it would always be home, like Ron and Hermione were – even without Ginny.
“Why the ocean?” He breathed out.
Like a key, something unfurled Malfoy. He stretched out his long legs, trapping Harry, one hand still braced on the wall.
“Which is why you knew I lived here,” Harry said. “Seventh floor. Neighbors.”
Harry titled his head.
Harry was on the way to the kitchen when he heard soft peals of laughter coming from the kitchen. Draco laughed with an open snort. Parkinson was over.
He woke up slowly. The earliest rays of sun peeked through the space between his curtains. Soft pinks and blues enveloped the room. He felt a hand curled in his hair. It was sweaty because Draco was sweaty. But the heat and shivers were gone, and he felt like he could breathe again.
Harry leaned against the door, shirt wet from where Malfoy touched him. He exhaled, letting go of a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.
The second time he woke up, Draco couldn’t breathe. His breaths came out ragged and harsh, but did nothing to quell the pain in his chest. Potter was there for some reason, hands on his shoulders.
His stomach felt warm, collateral damage of his acid and alcohol. Maybe it was because of this. Maybe it was because of the soft gaze Malfoy had on as he stared at the city below them. Maybe it was because their hands brushed every so often, sending electricity to something more than just Harry’s body.
Tightness increased with each stroke. He wondered how it would sound, how
A faint smile appeared on Malfoy’s face, “Ah, but most of the Wizarding World has not pulled several all-nighters with Granger, whose entire project is comparing radical movements in the Magic and Muggle world.”
He said this slowly, letting the words sink in Harry’s consciousness.
Harry gave him a faint smile, ignoring the demand. “Don’t you want to hear about mine?”
“He’s busy,” Malfoy mumbled, petting the white peacock. “And the only other one with access is Pansy, who is in Tokyo.”
it. You told me where it was!”
”), but Harry was quicker, had
Harry nodded numbly, not trusting the words that would tumble out of his mouth, and averted his gaze. He was not sure how to control his racing heart, a common reaction to Malfoy. But never like this – heat pooled to his stomach, goosebumps broke out on his arms, a wild jealousy of being
Malfoy looked him, eyes twinkling, “Yeah, it is.”
Behind him, Malfoy let out a long sigh followed by a thump. He looked over to find him sitting on the concrete, taking off his gloves. Smudges of dirt sat on his right cheek.
But then, Harry’s eye caught something on Draco’s chest. A thick ropy scar Harry was responsible for.  Guilt sank into his gut. He jerked back, feeling like he had been electrocuted. Draco caught his hand before he could go too far.
Draco scooted so that he was lying down again. He grasped Potter’s wrist, smooshing his face into the blankets. The chamomile scent was everywhere now. And his hand was warm and willing to intertwine with Draco’s.
A beat of silence passed before Malfoy knelt and began to help Harry, gathering the clothes quickly with pale, nimble fingers. “Why should I move out? I got here first.”
Harry smiled, remembering the in-depth talk he and Hermione had with McGonagall. “Yes, they installed a new tower last year.”
Their shoulders brushed as Harry shifted to kick the pebble. It was true, Harry had considered it. But after his breakup with Ginny, the spotlight was too much to bear.
good.”
He raised an eyebrow, even if it hurt. “You like playing Nurse as much as you like Hero?”
But the words faded in and out of comprehension.
Harry nodded once, then twice, making sure their gazes were locked. This seemed to calm the storm going on in Malfoy, his shoulders relaxing. They headed to the kitchen.
As much he tried to ignore it, attention from Malfoy had always given him some sort of excitement. So when he turned his gaze from Harry to the board, a rush made its way through his chest.
Harry didn't answer, paralyzed by fear. He couldn't move. He couldn't twitch, couldn't make a single noise. There was something purely evil and sinister about this man, Harry knew.
Draco wondered if this happened regularly. It made sense, with the dark circles Draco would always see under his eyes. Draco held Harry a little closer, falling asleep with a smile on his face, thinking for just a moment, about how Harry had called him 'Dray'.
. Harry decided she was going to pay then.
Harry breathed heavily, something new running through him. He knelt down next to Dudley, whispering. "Don't tell anyone, or I'll do it again," Harry told him. Dudley sobbed and ran to a teacher who sat on a bench reading a book.
"Please do take care of him, Mr. Malfoy. He's in a very unpredictable situation, and I need you to be very serious about this. Try and get some sleep, Mr. Malfoy," she gave him a small smile, which by no means made him feel better, "now, Dinky."
"Hi..." Harry whispered.
"Yes, now that you're here, I think I'll have a problem for the next seven years, if you last that long," he sneered, looking down his nose at Harry.
Please enjoy! Thank you so much for your reviews! Keep telling me your thoughts! I'm sure you'll have some for this one!
"Your opinions do not matter on such things, Potter."
"What happened Harry?" Draco asked, moving Harry's hair away from his eyes and wiping his tears away with his shirt. Harry shook his head, but his sobs were a little quieter now. Draco realized he wasn't going to talk until he calmed down, and Draco didn't want him to be in pain.
Voldemort really did have an advantage if he had the minister on his side, public or not.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows at Draco. "Of course I am. It's one of the few times I have to myself that doesn't serve as a reminder of," Harry gestured to their surroundings, "everything that's going on. Why are you asking?"
"Did you have this on hand?"
"You may stand."
Harry's eyebrow furrowed. None of this made sense.
"Harry," Voldemort hissed. Harry stood from his kneeling position. He been called for a private meeting the moment they'd return from Hogwarts.
He enjoyed the cuddling, more than he thought he would with anyone else. Maybe it was because Harry was small and not a heavy weight on his chest. Or the way that Harry held on to him and smiled at him like he was... like Draco was his whole
Wondering if this would trigger any other memories, Draco forced himself to keep still on the couch as he watched Harry fly in circles around him. Harry was giggling madly, and soon shouts of "Faster! Faster!" filled the air.
At least, they had after he'd cut off one of Pettigrew's fingers.
Draco watched Dumbledore closely, heart dropping when he saw the Headmaster frown.
"Eleven."
Draco stopped. That was exactly what they needed. Somewhere no one would go. Somewhere people would be

Chest heaving, Draco waited for a moment at the bottom, adrenaline pumping through his veins and making him light-headed. Once he caught his breath -he was truly astonished he was still alive, honestly- he steeled himself and moved forward, having to crouch as he walked.
charm for me."
"Thanks, Ferret-Face."
Aunt Petunia was out in the garden, caring for her flowers almost more than she did Dudley. Harry wasn't allowed to work with them anymore, since he had accidentally killed a few of her roses last year. Her purse sat on the counter, unattended as usual. Uncle Vernon drank beer in the living room, watching the telly. Dudley was upstairs, preoccupied with something Harry didn't care about.
"No, I didn't expect you to... a horcrux is very dark magic, Harry," Voldemort murmured. Harry felt Nagini circling around him, brushing his robes closer and closer. Harry didn't dare move.
There was a moment of silence. "What can you tell, Madam?" Dumbledore asked Pomfrey. She shook her head slowly.
Snape finally looked up. "The Dark Lord said nothing of this." He finally spoke. Harry shook his head.
"Then it can wait until after dinner. C'mon, I'm hungry. We'll still have plenty of time after curfew," Harry reassured, gesturing to the door with his head. Hermione relented, sighing.
Harry tried to imagine the terrifying reptile in front of him. "Why're you hung-" Harry stopped. That was English, he knew that. He concentrated, trying to focus on the hissing voice in his head.
"Why must I bring Potter to the bloody hospi-"
Maybe Harry was being pessimistic. Maybe part of Voldemort's plan was going to fail. Maybe Moody would blow his cover, and one of the teachers like McGonagall or Lupin or even Dumbledore would find out and stop him. Harry doubted that, though. His and Draco's part had, unfortunately, been implemented seamlessly; starting his encouraging Hagrids interest in dangerous and highly lethal creatures, and ending with some of those creatures being tampered with before their placement in the maze. Harry preyed no one would run into one of the Blast-Ended Skrewts that had been modified with venom and very good jumping skills.
"I... I couldn't take the risk that he would be dead by the time Aurors got there. I-I knew a way in and I was quiet and we got out unharmed. I can't apologize for that, Headmaster." Draco looked back at Harry, brushing hair out of his eyes. He turned back to the teachers. "I couldn't let him down again," he said quietly.
Hermione sighed. Harry pouted at her. She swore the dog was too. "Fine, fine, we'll try. He has to actually keep the cloak on, you realize."
Harry snorted, moving a bishop, which Draco quickly took with a rook Harry hadn't noticed. "Blaise still has a lot to learn if he thinks he's going to get one of those seventh year girls to go to Hogsmead with him." Harry shook his head, glaring at the chess board.
Professor Snape sighed, taking floo powder into his hand. "Headmaster's Office."
After a moment, Sir Mercy nodded. "Continue your father's work, boy. Creatures of all sorts need rights." Sir Mercy watched him until Draco nodded. "Do not ruin my quarters, boys. The password is Wattlebird. Don't forget it." Sir Mercy opened his portrait, allowing the two boys to step aside.
"Come in."
Harry didn't nod, didn't react at all, but Draco thought he maybe just needed space, so he backed off and headed for the connecting living room. Before he made it through the doorway, Harry called out in a tiny voice. "I don't need to cook breakfast or do the dishes?"
"That means that this potion could cure him, but it may also react negatively with what is already in his system. I added phoenix tears, which should ease the entire process."
Professor Lupin, after shoving the boggart back into the trunk, sat down next to him. He gave Harry a pat on the shoulder. "You've made progress, Harry. There's always something to be proud of."
Harry didn't have anything to say to that, and it was quiet for a few minutes, before Sirius spoke again.
Severus shook his head after a moment, ignoring the slight. "He will call me back soon."
"Hello again, Dinky," The portrait greeted, staring at them. "And you two will be staying in my quarters, I presume?"
Harry nodded a bit, remembering how his aunt Marge used to talk about her dogs diet for hours when she would visit. "Yeah, that should be fine. Go on, give it to him, he's probably starving."
Harry laughed a bit, petting the shaggy, disgusting fur. It had grown so long it seemed to hang to the ground in some places. "Maybe I should clean you up a bit, too. I know a few cleaning spells, but I don't know how safe they are for animals..." Harry muttered to himself, scratching the mutts muzzle. It yipped at him a bit.
"You know, this is kinda copying," Harry teased, putting the ring on his left ring finger, wiggling his hand to make sure it wouldn't fly off. It was a little loose, so he moved it to his index and it fit nicely. It was almost identical to Draco's, except the gem was emerald and glittered gold depending on how the light his it.
No one was outside. That was fine for Draco, morning classes probably hadn't even started. He ran into Hogwarts, thanking Merlin that the entrance was as close to the Hospital Wing as it was.
A house-elf popped into their room, holding out a potion for Draco to take. "From Professors Snapes Sirs!" He popped away as soon as Draco took it from him.
"Do you know why your nose was bleeding?"
The 'house-arrest' made buying a gift not an option, but that didn't mean Harry couldn't make one.
"Okay, how about Professor McGonagall?"
Draco nodded after a moment, feeling a bit like a ghost as he went to Harry's room. The mess he had made of Harry's trunk had was put away, the bed freshly made. Draco set the potion bag on top of the trunk, holding Harry with both hands for a moment. At some point Harry had drifted off, now drooling lightly on his shoulder. Draco tucked his face into his hair, allowing himself this moment of weakness with no one to witness it.
"Mudblood means she came from a Muggle family. No magic in her line, it just randomly decides to make stupid choices sometimes. Most people call them Muggle borns, but everyone
Harry turned to look at the whole High Table. Dumbledore, the headmaster, watched with a smile and a twinkle in his eye. Teachers on either side of him seemed to have the same reaction, though two teachers he found staring directly at him.
Harry told the next story, how his parents fell in love. He told this story to himself when he couldn’t sleep, its familiar events warming his heart.
is,” Harry replied. “Wizards never really discuss it.”
She continued to list all the things she was (not) and Malfoy (definitely) was. It eventually morphed in an impression of Draco from 6
He asked this, knowing what Harry meant, but he wanted to hear it anyway. Malfoy did this a lot, always needed vocal confirmation.
“I like the ocean.”
He turned the key over in his hands.
Just like that, he was gone. And the glint in his eyes meant he was not coming back. It was the same look Hermione had on when she dived into “the perfect book” for her research. She would spend
To think, Draco was looking for freedom while Harry was looking for a home. Harry decided these two things could co-exist. Their fingers brushed together.
He asked his Mind Healer about it once. She said it was because he hadn’t made a home inside himself yet.
Harry pulled back, “Sorry.”
The parent in his office now reminded him a bit of Vernon Dursley with his large mustache and discriminatory beliefs about magic. It put him on edge. He was even more so with the three cups of coffee he downed during the meeting. And he
Potter squinted at him, in a way that said he was definitely going to tell her. Draco hated him. Granger was never going to let him forget.
“You were having a panic attack,” Potter whispered.
He told the truth. “A fight?”
Harry thought of Parkinson’s job. He wasn’t sure what exactly she did, but it involved lots of interviews, which is why she frequented Ginny’s world. He realized now that she probably did lots of research too, which meant that she was in Hermione’s world. Strangely, this fact pleased him.
Harry placed the basil on his kitchen windowsill, where the sun would reach it.
“Maybe she thought the shock would give me an advantage for our inevitable fight.”
Amongst the blankets, their hands brushed together for a moment. It was slight, but Harry felt something warm sink itself into his chest. This was delicate – this love.
“Ron, I am not,” Harry repeated, pinching the bridge of his nose. “I am just eating. Please continue.”
“You need to move immediately,” Harry said, pointing at the man. He ignored the offended gasp to gather his clothes. (They had landed everywhere.)
The last box hit the ground with a resounding thump.
They trudged to his bedroom, where Harry flopped Draco onto his bed.
“Sure, that’s why you’re wearing five cardigans.” Was that right? He remembered putting one on, but hardly five.
“I knew it,” Harry said. If he smiled any wider, his face would split open.
it. His day was clear and he had all the ingredients.
He woke with a start. The intensity of the hangover almost crushed him. He turned his head to the side, finding a stack of presents leaned up against the wall and smiled. It was a good birthday. But as he remembered more of the night, his heart began to pound.
He swaggered out, a bounce in his step that Harry remembered from Hogwarts. In a weird way, he had missed it. The last time they had met was Wizengamot. He had left the room with a slow, miserable drag of his feet. The scrape of his soles against the wooden floor sounded like condemnation. This bounce was more familiar.
“The birds?” Harry asked, tracing over them, leaving goosebumps on his pale skin.
He said something about being fine and how he could handle it, but it didn’t come out right. His voice more hushed and frayed than he intended.
“But it’s not part of the window.”
