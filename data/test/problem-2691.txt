Soon the whole family had disappeared through the barrier. Harry was nervous that it would not let him through but he decided to just do it so he wouldn’t be sent back to his Aunt and Uncle if he missed the train. He shuddered at just the mere thought. So he ran at the wall, with his trunk and owl Hedwig. He closed his eyes for good measure. When he opened his eyes, before him he could see a beautiful gleaming scarlet train.
After everyone had their broom in hand, Madam Hooch showed them how to grip the handle, as well as mounting. Much to Ron’s delight, Draco had been mounting his broomstick wrong for years according to Hooch. Although Draco was Harry’s friend, he was still amused by the whole situation and laughed a little at Draco who was blushing from embarrassment, which earned him a death glare.
A/N Just a quick mention on my upload schedule. I will aim to update every couple of weeks but due to school and life in general , uploads might be inconsistent . Now I'll shut up. Enjoy!
“We’ll have to wait and see since here come the teams,” Millie said.
Although his mind kept drifting to his Godfather’s lesson earlier that day.
“Relax Draco. We're not going to go and duel them. I'm going to tip Filch off so they get caught in the trophy room while we sit in our common room with our friends. What's so bad about that?” Blaise asked, who was amused by the whole situation.
But don't judge on what you see,
"I was wondering if Hogwarts sends something like the muggle report cards we got in primary school to our family?" He asked.
Draco revealed himself and grumbled “Well you’re a popular person apparently. How come you knew I was there?”
So put me on! Don't be afraid!
“We also found out there is a guy called Nicolas Flamel involved with this whole business.”
He slumped against the table in front of the Headmaster's chair with his signature purple turban out of place and an expression of utter terror upon his face. All he could choke out was "Troll—in the—dungeons. Thought—you ought to— know."
Harry smiled. Despite having to fake hate between each other, Draco still wanted to be his friend. Harry for once felt happy, he had not many great memories but this would be a good one.
A/N I have made a mistake with the chapter numbers so this is meant to be chapter 7. Everything remains the same though. Sorry for the confusion.
Although DADA and Potions were beginning to not be as fun as Harry had anticipated as he arrived at Hogwarts.
Harry and Ron stared at Hermione in shock. Hermione Granger, the girl who abides by the rules and is top of her classes lied for them. One of which made fun of her mere hours beforehand.
“Well my sister said that every year she has been here, Slytherin has won both the Quidditch and House cup. It's been that way for many years and I doubt it will change now.” Pansy stated, waving her hand as if it was obvious.
Laughter and loud chatter could be heard all throughout the corridors as students walked to their respective classes. The Christmas holidays were drawing closer and many conversations revolved around holiday plans and gift shopping.
As they all ventured upstairs, contemplating how a troll got in, Harry was thinking about where the Slytherins would go since their dormitories were in the dungeons, as well the Hufflepuff dormitories since he heard they were in the dungeons too.
Both of them spun round. Harry was just blank, whereas the redhead git looked as if he was caught in the act of stealing something. Weasel sneered and said "None of your business Malfoy."
Harry was gaining on the small golden ball and Higgs was behind, unable to catch up. But before Harry could reach for the winged ball, he was almost knocked off his broom by one of the Slytherin chasers, resulting in a penalty for the Gryffindor team. That caused a massive uproar from Gryffindor supporters. Alas, once both seekers were back on track, the snitch had already disappeared and the game continued on.
“But—“ Harry started but was cut off by a sharp Snape-like glare.
Harry grabbed a broom from beside him before Hermione interrupted “No!” she shouted. “You'll get us all in trouble, remember what Madam Hooch said.”
Blaise cleared his throat and stated “All you did was collect all the blankets and pillows, you didn't need me for- “
So try me on and I will tell you
Finally, the class came to a close and Harry, along with classmates, rushed to their next class but he couldn't help but wonder if faking his grades was worth it anymore.
Harry narrowed his eyes, he didn't know what Draco was up to but he didn't like it. Not one bit. “Give it here Malfoy,” Harry said quietly. If people weren't looking before, they were now.
"What about you Harry?" Neville asked shyly.
Why is it so important that a creature, like the Cerberus, was guarding it?
An hour later Harry was finished and spoke up to his teacher. " I've finished sir."
His normal calm cascade was not reflecting what he was truly feeling. He felt like his heart was going to explode from his chest at the sight of his friend dangling from below his broom, holding on for dear life. Draco desperately wanted to yell for someone to do something but he was frozen with fear that he would do something he would regret.
“What the hell Zabini, what were you thinking!” Draco hissed angrily as they sat down.
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
Snape looked at Harry as if he wanted to strangle him for his rash Gryffindor recklessness. Harry couldn't blame him, it did look bad.
As the annual Gryffindor versus Slytherin game was upon them, the whole school, bar the two teams, found themselves decked out in house colours sitting in the blistering November cold in the stands surrounding the pitch.
“Well we can research later and hopefully we find something,” Harry said
"I think she heard you," Harry said, stating the obvious while frowning at Ron's behaviour.
Many thoughts swirled around in his mind, thoughts on expulsion and returning to his uncle were part of many troubling thoughts in his head. Although those thoughts were pushed to the back of his mind when McGonagall stopped in front of the charms classroom. She opened the door and asked for Wood.
Knowing full well that the Headmaster was behind whatever was going on in the school. Draco’s personal opinion of Dumbledore, which was already low, diminished further.
While Harry knew that making his work look bad was one of the reasons Snape picked on him, he didn't want to change since it was all he knew but one day he lost it.
Harry turned around to see Draco leaning against a desk in the front row. “Sorry, I got a bit lost,” Harry replied. Draco shrugged off the apology and asked about how he was hanging out with his Gryffindor friends.
It was dinner time and Harry was sitting with his two friends, who were arguing about something but Harry honestly was not in the mood to play peacemaker.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
For I'm a Thinking Cap!"
Draco turned to the Professor and stated "No professor, I was asking why Potter had a broomstick considering us first years aren't allowed our own."
As the Gryffindor table erupted in the biggest cheer yet, Harry got up and walked towards their table. No one in the entire Great Hall noticed how broken their 'Golden Boy' looked as he sat down, apart from Draco and the man in black.
"Let go of me you crazed woman! Affection burns me!" I let him go with a laugh, I loved his dramatics.
I climbed the carriage with Nott and Zabini, completely ignoring their concerned glances they were throwing at me once they realized something bad had happened between me and Draco.
"Yeh and death eaters are only after the muggles and muggle borns, Blaise is a pureblood, he should be fine, right?" Draco nodded.
I looked at my side and saw Draco staring at me, his expression was filled with worry. "Stop thinking about it, if he refuses to see how awesome his daughter is, just because of the house she got sorted in, then it's his loss" he took my hand and started leading the way towards his family tent, leading me away form Sirius, away from the constant reminder that I wasn't good enough. "You deserve better Mia, don't let his stupid little attitude tell you otherwise" I nodded slowly and picked up my pace.
And so we were left alone again, and I allowed my defenses to go down, finally letting the tears fall.
Soon came the day to go to King's Cross, and as usual I had to find my own way to get there. Not a very hard task, but when the rain outside seems never ending and getting worse by the minute, all the muggle cabs get full, and it becomes difficult to find any kind of transports, specially one who would accept traveling with and animal. Eventually I gave up and called the cab agency and had them send me someone who would allow cats in the ride.
“Exactly!” Theo said.
When the time for dinner came, Draco walked up to the Great Hall, closely followed by Vince and Greg. They sat down with the other Slytherin first years, Pansy, Daphne, Tracey, Millie, Theo and Blaise. As they ate the delicious food prepared by the house elves, they discussed many things as well as exchanging gossip on what went down on the first day.
“Why are you complaining, this gives Higgs a chance to get the snitch while Potter is distracted!” Blaise hissed at Daphne, looking delighted.
He could see Draco looked a bit worried but then said loudly “Let's see if your flying is up to scratch Potter.”
Grabbing at the opportunity to lecture, she replied "No but we can owl our family on our grades and progress. I've been using the school owls but you have Hedwig so you're ok."
After a quick walk up to the classroom, Harry opened the door to find Draco pacing.
Charms class for example was always fun since Flitwick, the small goblin-like wizard, pretty much left them to their own devices when practising new spells. It was ample time to have a conversation with friends.
'Slytherin, Slytherin.' He chanted in his head, hoping that the hat would take his preference into account.
A/N There has been some formatting mistakes on my part where Italics but if you haven’t caught on that Italics are thoughts from the characters. Hope that clears some things up! Enjoy the chapter.
Many people were in the library that night, more or less trying to get a head start on their holiday work.
The blond was curious about the raven haired since he looked younger than himself. He offered his hand to the smaller boy and said “Draco Malfoy and you would be…”
“Git.”
These were a few of the many firsties who were sorted. Two of the people who he shared a boat with, Neville and Hermione, were both sorted into Gryffindor. Ron openly groaned at Hermione's as he found her a bit of know it all. Draco's sorting was quick and he was placed in Slytherin. While he walked to the Slytherin table, his gaze met Harry's. They both nodded and turned their attention back to the sorting.
Chapter 11: The conundrum
Harry gave a small smile. It seemed like Draco cared.
He was relieved that Harry hadn’t plummeted to the ground and gotten hurt, that he didn't care in the slightest that Slytherin had lost the first match of the season.
Later in the week, the school found themselves in Great hall for the highly awaited Halloween feast.
It was peaceful until one Gryffindor decided to break the silence.
“Now, when I blow my whistle, kick-off from the ground, hard.” Said Madam Hooch. ‘Keep your broom steady, rise a few feet and then come straight down by leaning forward slightly. Ready, three-two-“
Alas, Harry ignored her, mounting his broom and kicked hard against the ground, soaring into the crisp autumn air. His robes flapped behind him, the wind in face messing up his hair but he did not care. He felt an immense joy as he flew through the air, he didn't need to learn how to fly because something inside him knew how to already and that brought a bigger smile to his face.
“HARRY POTTER!”
“Gladly. Who would want to be around such filth?” Draco retorted, staring at Ron and Hermione.
Harry stopped suddenly, thinking deeply. Thankfully he was at the back so nobody noticed, well except Ron. "Mate, what's wrong?"
“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word—like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping students silent without effort.
His friends nodded and left in the direction of Gryffindor tower.
“Of course I'm right. I always am.” Draco scoffed.
As they turned a corner, Harry could hear fast paced footsteps coming from behind them. He pulled Ron behind a stone griffin statue in an attempt to hide from whoever was coming and it worked as Snape rounded the corner and briskly walked past, oblivious to the Gryffindors.
To make matters worse, Hermione was not present. Harry knew she was annoyed at their run in with the three-headed dog but he was a tad bit worried about her considering that he overheard Lavender saying to Parvati that she was in the bathroom crying and he assumed that was because of what occurred last period
Everyone else nodded in agreement, all adding something else to mock Harry.
If Draco didn't have such decorum, he would have stood gaping there like a fish.
Rumours spread across the school like Fiendfyre. As the day progressed, Draco heard more and more rumours that were more absurd than the last. It was driving him up the wall since there was one common element in everyone’s stories, that the Gryffindor golden trio was involved with the troll incident.
Weeks flew by for Harry in the blink of an eye. Harry had never enjoyed school that much thanks to his cousin but Hogwarts was slowly becoming his home and he was enjoying it immensely.
"No, I just thought someone was trying to jinx me from behind or something," Harry said quickly. "How long were you standing there for." He asked, blushing from embarrassment.
As the next morning came and the morning classes flew by, Harry couldn’t help thinking that something was off with Professor Quirrell. That morning the first-year Gryffindors had their second DADA lesson. Like the last lesson, the room was filled with the smell of garlic. During Quirrell’s stuttering lecture that barely anyone could comprehend, Harry’s scar was hurting. He noticed that both times he was in the same room at Quirrell, his scar would start to act up.
"I'm not sure Neville." He lied, he liked Neville, he was quiet and seemed nice, but he thought that Ron would go mental at him wanting to be in Slytherin because of what he had said about them.
After a long pointless meal of picking his food, Harry left for the library to find Hermione. Despite being on rocky terms with her, he walked up to the table she was studying, in search of information. "Hello 'Mione," Harry said.
“What was on the note mate?” Ron asked.
As Ron dropped the bat and looked around, he found Harry and Hermione staring at him in disbelief. "What? You pick up a few things while living with Fred and George."
Snape’s lip curled into a sneer. “Tut Tut - fame clearly isn't everything.” Hermione's hand was high in the air but Snape took no notice. “ Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find a bezoar?”
Chapter 10: I’m a seeker and you’re my golden snitch
“You wouldn't dare,” Draco said.
“Wood’s the Gryffindor captain you see,” McGonagall explained.
“The introduction of the saviour of the wizarding world,” Tracey answered.
“For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons.” He paused then said smoothly “Malfoy, kindly inform Potter about monkshood and wolfsbane.”
Once Draco had entered the Slytherin common room, Blaise immediately got up from his seat by the fire and cornered Draco. "Why on earth did you bet on Potter of all people, he is the freaking boy who lived. All innocent and perfect. As if he would be on the team."
“So in other words, Harry freakin Potter is gonna turn the tables on us.” Draco summed up.
The train whistle blew, signalling that everyone had 5 minutes to get on the train. Harry swiftly got his stuff on the train despite his size and rushed off down the corridor with it to find a compartment. He reached the end of the corridor and found an empty compartment, so he slipped in. He put his trunk on the overhead, as well as Hedwig's cage. As Harry sat down, he grabbed the book titled Magical Drafts And Potions by Arsenius Jigger from his bag and began reading. He found the concepts simple and thought it sounded quite similar to cooking beside the magical properties of ingredients. He was thoroughly enjoying the book when he was snapped back to reality by harshly flinching at the compartment door opening.
Before she could get a chance to respond, Draco had already walked out of the library.
Draco noted the gleam in the boy’s eyes dulled as he left.
Daphne smirked, catching on and said, “Tell me you didn't.”
Ha, I can't imagine what everyone's faces would be if I just got the right person out of ‘pure dumb luck’.
Harry raised an eyebrow and said, “Oh really, try me.”
Not long later, Harry's name was called.
They all settled down on the blankets and got comfy. “This is just like old times,” Mille said. Draco agreed, it was nice to be a kid sometimes, just hanging out with friends without worrying about keeping up their reputations or pleasing adults. Contrary to popular belief but Slytherins liked to relax with their friends like everyone else and the first years Slytherins had been friends since they were young so this was a common practice.
“Pansy, if you call me that again I will strangle you,” Draco growled but still smiled nonetheless. “I’ve gotta go talk to Professor Snape about his assignment and if I can get some extra credit.”
“We’ll have to get back to you on our bets later,” Draco said as he came up with an idea. Harry might know who was chosen and if he did then he could get the money if not all of it.
The two began scheming straight away, Harry more hesitant to say his ideas but Draco coaxed them out of him and they turned out to be as Slytherin as his own.
"Why did you tell Weasley to add in four porcupine quills instead of two. What was passing through your small excuse for a brain Potter! Trying to make your potion look better? Weasley, why would you listen to Potter's insane thoughts." He snapped. "Potter, detention with me at 7 o'clock sharp on Thursday. Same goes for you Weasley but report to Filch." He glared at them, daring them to disagree. Neither rose to the bait.
They made their way down a few corridors when they smelt something disgusting. It smelled as if there were a couple of dead animals that had never bathed when they were alive. It was then they saw the troll turn the corner.
Harry looked around, noticing the broken bits of pipes and taps strewn across the floor "Like this." He said as he picked up a tap and tossed it at a wall. The troll turned his head away from Hermione and looked dumbly around to find the source of the noise.
“Slytherin is going to win for sure,” Blaise stated boldly.
D.A.M
Harry walked up to the stool and his gaze fell on the Headmaster and his red robes, who was staring intensely at him. Harry felt very uncomfortable but soon forgot about it as he sat on the stool and the hat was placed on his head, obscuring his view of the Great Hall.
Harry gave a jerky nod and said “Yeah, I’m looking forward to it.”
Fortunately, the group of Slytherins were up at 7 o'clock like normal, a bit slower and more drowsy than normal but still up all the same. Draco surprisingly was first waiting in the common room for his friends, he was usually last since he was obsessed with making his hair just right.
Much to Harry’s relief, dinner was almost over when he felt something hit the back of his head. He turned to see a piece of crumpled up parchment on the floor. Curious, Harry picked up the note and smoothed it out. It read
McGonagall observed her class to see if anyone else other than Hermione would answer. When no one moved to put their hand up, she sighed and opened her mouth to ask Hermione when she saw a hand raise out the corner of her eye.
As the pair left, Harry was seething with fury, not that anyone saw.
“Well, I should go and meet my mother outside now”, Draco said, “I look forward to our next meeting.”
Everyone in the room fell into utter silence at those two words.
"Hermione, run," Harry said. Hermione stood up shakily but she was too busy staring at the troll in horror to move any further. "NOW!" He bellowed but she did not move because she was rooted to the spot with pure fear. "Gee and I thought we were meant to be the brave ones." He uttered under his breath.
It was dinner time and Blaise and Draco were walking into the Great Hall. Blaise then saw Harry sitting with his friends and guided him to the Gryffindor table. Draco resisted from rolling his eyes, he was hungry and was not in the mood for mocking Harry at the moment. What does a guy have to do to get food around here?
When Professor McGonagall returned, she ordered everyone into a single file and led them through the huge double doors that opened to the Great Hall. They walked past the students who were spread across four long tables. As they approached the head table where the staff were seated, McGonagall placed a four-legged stool on the floor, while also placing an old looking wizard hat that had many patches and tears on it. After a moment of sitting on the stool, one of the tears turned into the shape of a mouth and burst into a song.
“I for one agree with Zabini,” Draco answered truthfully although he was looking forward to seeing his friend fly and play an actual game.
"I'll be in Gryffindor like the rest of my brothers I suppose," Ron said, a bit of bitterness underlying his tone. "Although if I got put in Slytherin, I'd catch the first train home. I wouldn't go anywhere near those slimy snakes."
Raising the bat he swung again, with more force, hitting the troll in the head. As a result, the troll collapsed onto the ground unconscious from the blow.
Not a few moments later, Snape, McGonagall and Quirell came racing into the bathroom. One look at the troll and McGonagall launched herself into a scolding lecture.
“I did,” Blaise confirmed. “So let's just say Filch will have a jolly good time at midnight.”
I know this, it makes the Draught of Living Death, a powerful sleeping potion.
“Who on earth calls a terrorising three-headed dog Fluffy? Of all the bloody names.” Draco ranted while looking at Harry in disbelief
“Draco, you sound nothing like your father from what you have described and if you're worried about being seen together, he doesn’t have to find out.” Harry smirked but then hastily added, “Only if you want to continue being friends, I would understand if you thought it would be too dangerous for you.”
As the golden sunset approached and the luminous moon rose high in the sky, he saw the captain pack up the ball chest which contained the quaffle, bludgers and snitch and bid farewell to Harry, who had just landed.
“He's just a measly first year like us. He is also so small. What’s he going to do, knock Higgs off his broom so he can catch the snitch, it would be the other way round.” Pansy laughed.
As the Slytherins they are, they spent the good part of an hour gossiping and discussing thoughts on everyone who attended and worked at Hogwarts. Now, this might be weird to some people but a lot of purebloods grew up with their parents gossiping about everyone and everything interesting in the wizarding world. So it was common for the kids of purebloods to do this. Although Pansy did enjoy it more than the others, she was in her element since her mom is a journalist.
When they moved from behind the statue Ron spoke up and said "Snape is heading for the third floor."
“Look!” Draco exclaimed. “It's that stupid thing Longbottom got from his pathetic grandmother.”
Despite what people would think about the Malfoys, Draco didn't like having to keep up a reputation that would please his father. Sure he wasn't the biggest fan of muggles but his father took it to the next level.
He made his way back to his friends and asked Hermione the time since she had a small silver watch on her left wrist. “ It's quarter to eight, why do you ask?” She queried.
Draco threw in a couple of snarky comments here and there but kept glancing over at the Gryffindor table where he saw Harry talking to Granger and Weasel. He may not be like his father, but he did find some of the Weasley children annoying.
“Anyways, how about we head back to the common room,” Hermione asked while looking around at their housemates who were leaving.
Chapter 9 : A troll-ubling incident
Draco was unsure how to respond. A simple ‘No Problem’ didn't seem right considering how his friend reacted to his offering of help. So he stood in front of Harry awkwardly while his friend regained his composure.
Harry shook his head.
D.A.M.
During one lesson, they were all independently brewing a potion. Ron and Harry were quietly speaking about random things like Quidditch and homework when Ron's potion blew up. Thankfully it caused no harm to Ron or anyone around him but Snape had other thoughts.
Draco nodded in thought, “ You’ll be off to Hogwarts like me I suppose?” He asked.
What did the package contain?
It was a valid excuse since Harry often went for evening walks to escape from everyone. The peace and quiet meant he was safe and that was comforting to Harry. When growing up, he was often shut in his cupboard for many hours and even days. Yes, he often felt lonely and unwanted but it was his safe place where he could dream up other worlds to escape from the harsh reality of the world.
It soon spotted Harry and abandoned Hermione by staggering towards Harry instead.
H.J.P
H.J.P
A small frown appeared on Harry's face until he took a deep breath and realised how worn out he was. He smiled gratefully as he quickly agreed to Draco's preposition.
“Come get it, Potter.” Draco taunted, holding the Remembrall to the sun, making it sparkle.
“Hear me out. You see I’ve been having these weird headaches but my scar, in particular, seems to ache worse. Although it only occurs when I’m in the DADA classroom or from what I’m guessing, near Quirrell. I know that I’m probably being paranoid and it's a coincidence but something just seems off.”
But apart from that, the students were buzzing with excitement and filled with eagerness for the holidays to come.
When Harry got off the train, he was soon spotted by Hagrid who was calling all the firsties to come over to him and get in a boat.
The night before the holidays, the Gryffindor golden trio could be found studying in the library. Not for homework but for their detective research on one Nicolas Flamel. Although their efforts felt futile since the last few weeks of searching came up with nothing, but they were not prepared to give up yet.
"What were you three thinking? Are you out of your minds?"
“Stupid muggles,” Draco muttered under his breath.
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Disrupting him from his troubling thoughts, a voice from a table behind him was heard. “That was supposed to be my line.” As Harry peeked out the corner of his eye, he saw that it was Draco who had muttered that line, causing Harry to choke from disbelief. Sometimes he wondered if his excellent hearing was a curse or a blessing.
As she led them down the corridor, the other Gryffindor was shooting him curious glances as they went. They entered an unused classroom which was empty except for Peeves writing rude messages on the blackboard.
Set Gryffindors apart;
Draco smirked and replied with a slightly mocking tone “Then why didn't you have any idea of the answers to Snape's questions.”
You might belong in Hufflepuff,
After a minute or two, the door swung open and everyone walked in but not without a few pushes and shoves.
"Who cares, it's true that she is an insufferable know it all," Ron said bluntly but stared at her as she ran out of sight
The door to the dormitory swung open, revealing Blaise standing in the door frame. “Good job on the setup girls,” Blaise said as he sat in between Draco and Crabbe. The girls smiled, he said that every time they did this.
Enjoy the chapter and as always please R&R.
Come to Charms classroom after dinner. I have something important to tell you.
"Why was Granger so-" Draco cut himself off as he saw Harry's tired look in his eyes, no doubt from the many daring dives and just the hectic school day in general. "People will start to wonder where we are if we don't go back. I'll talk more when we can meet up again." Draco suggested.
"HUFFLEPUFF."
Blaise glared at Pansy. “I left after dinner because I went to Filch’s office.”
"Boys, I hope no arguments are going on here." The small charms teacher said, frowning as he walked up to them.
Beside him, Ron began grumbling since they hadn't had the chance to ride the brooms. Harry was only half listening when he saw Goyle point to something in the grass to Draco. Bending down, Draco picked up a Remembrall, which Harry recognised from breakfast. It was Neville’s, who received it from his Gran via owl post that morning
That moment of hesitation was all Draco needed to see that Harry was lying. “Come on, we both know that's not true.”
D.A.M
It was like Harry was in a trance just staring at his younger self but was snapped out of it when he heard his name. Blinking, he was back standing beside McGonagall and an older Gryffindor boy.
More silence followed that little speech.
Harry stiffened and hesitated for a moment before replying. “I couldn't remember.” He knew it was lame but Draco had caught him off guard.
So instead he just toyed with the food on his plate.
Quirrel's class was a pain in normal circumstances with his stutter but more so for Harry when his scar would ache in each lesson, resulting in a pounding headache which made understanding the lesson much harder. Thankfully Ron would summarize the class for him, not well but good enough for Harry to research in depth later.
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
A/N Ahhhhhhhh! Thank you all the views! Over a 1000 views! You all are insane. If you celebrate easter, then I hope you had a great easter!
“What the hell is Potter doing,” Daphne exclaimed, spotting Harry’s broom trying to buck him off.
"Ron, move around and try to confuse it by yelling and throwing stuff," Harry ordered and Ron was quick to obey.
Chapter 7: A mysterious package
Wood looked like he had just won the lottery. He had a sparkle in his eyes as he turned his attention to Harry “Ever seen a game of Quidditch Potter?” He asked eagerly. Harry shook his head.
He stood there for a while, just watching the way his friend dived for small green balls that were slightly bigger than a snitch. Again he was forced to admit that Harry was a natural.
Harry was furious. He felt like he had taken a punch to his stomach. McLaggen's comment angered him even more so than Ron who was stewing beside him because he knew it was true. The Dursleys despised him because he was just a freak and a slave to them. Why would they care? If they suddenly treated him like a decent human being, it would be a sign that the world was coming to an end or they were clearly out of their small selfish minds.
Draco saw that Pansy was about to speak when a house elf appeared with steaming hot chocolate. Pansy waited for everyone to receive their beverage before she spoke. “Where were you? You just left without telling us and made us prepare everything.”
Harry bit his lip, mulling over what had been said. Then it came to him.
Harry muttered a quick greeting, then Hagrid lifted him and put him in a boat with the redhead he saw at the station, a girl with bushy hair and a boy with a toad.
So the group made their way up to the hall and sat down at their table. Before anyone moved to grab any food a gasp was heard. The first years all looked at Blaise, who had gasped and was staring at the Gryffindor table with an astonished look on his face.
“Lastly at the quidditch match, Hermione and Ron saw Snape casting a jinx on my broom. So Hermione snuck over to the teacher's stand and set fire to his robes. Causing my broom to still so I could climb back—“ Harry trailed off while narrowing his eyes at Draco, “Why are you smirking?”
Harry was also excited for Christmas, like his classmates. That morning McGonagall had come to the common room with a sign-up sheet for those who wished to stay over the break. Of course, as soon as he heard the words come out of his head of house’s mouth, he made a dash for the sheet and hastily signed his name on the form. There was no way in hell Harry would willingly go back to the Dursleys for the break. Not when he could stay at Hogwarts and actually enjoy the holiday for the first time in his life with Ron and his brothers. It was a shame Draco was going home but you couldn’t have it all. That was a lesson Harry knew all too well.
It was nearing closer to class when the owl post came in. considering it was the middle of the week, there were not many owls but one owl caught Draco's eye. It was an ordinary barn owl carrying a large oddly shaped package. He watched the owl as it delivered the parcel to Harry who looked excited by its arrival. He saw Harry lean towards Weasel and whisper something in his ear, making Weasel's face light up.
It was then when all the boats took off the bank and slowly drifted in the direction of the castle. It was quiet for a few moments before conversations continued, as well as Hermione's questioning.
"Ron you idiot. It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry said angrily.
"Potter, Harry."
"I pity those who are forced to stay at Hogwarts over the break. That they are unwanted by their own families at Christmas time. It's a shame really." McLaggen whispered loudly to his cronies who were sitting by him.
When Draco had bumped into Harry, he thought he felt Draco’s hand slip in his pocket. So once he was away from prying eyes, he looked in his pocket and found a small piece of parchment. It read
“Yes and don’t give me some half-baked story, I want the whole juicy tale,” Draco demanded, his eyes daring Harry to do otherwise.
Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were onyx, they were cold and empty and made you think that he was staring into your soul.
Draco stood there just staring at the board, thinking of Harry and how good his flying was for the first time. As much as Draco hated it, he knew he should probably support Harry and not be mad at him, even if he didn't like it.
"I wouldn't mind being in Hufflepuff but my parents were both Gryffindor, so I think that would be an alright choice too," Neville said, his cheeks tinged slightly red at the end.
He did not want to pry into his friend’s past but he vowed he would protect him, no matter who tried to stop him.
Harry’s dorm mates were all fast asleep and with Ron's snores echoing beside him, he knew he would never get back to sleep. What's a few hours less of sleep anyway? It's not like he wasn't used to it anyways.
His name was Cormac McLaggen.
Enjoy the chapter!
"It's just a joke Zabini, lighten up. I recommend betting on one of the older students. At least you would have a chance at getting bragging rights." Draco said with ease.
With his hand clutched, he sped up and shoved passed Harry, while slipping his clenched hand into Harry’s pocket.
He opened the door and slid in, closing the door gently behind him. Although he jumped when he heard a voice. “About time.”
“Hey!” Draco protested while self consciously patting his hair with his hand. He was very sensitive about his hair, Theo and Blaise often made fun of how long he spent in the bathroom each morning as a result.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank you for reading so far!
"Oh." Was all Ron could say before they heard a high pitched scream coming from the bathroom. Ron sprinted into the doorway, closely followed by Harry, who muttered "Oh crap," under his breath as he saw broken stalls and water everywhere
And so he huffed in a very un-Malfoy-ish way and stalked out of the changing room, leaving Harry to deal with a devastated quidditch captain.
Draco was smirking but raised an eyebrow, to get his unasked question across. “I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a tree.” Draco said, grabbing a broom in the process.
“We found out the Cerberus is named Fluffy.”
Enjoy the chapter!
You'll make your real friends,
Draco was mentally racking his brain for answers on what they were doing. Then it hit him.
He caught Draco’s eye and they both gave each other a sad smile, knowing that despite being friends, no one could know. It was sad but since when was life ever fair. Just as Goyle turned his head to face Draco, his face had returned to a complete stone expression.
Quickly forgetting his train of thought, he whispered back. “Follow my lead.’ Stepping back a step, Draco spoke. “Think you're so special, Potter. Getting on the team when first years aren’t allowed. It's a disgrace to the tradition!”
“Do you know anything about Quidditch?” Draco asked.
It was a jinx of some kind that was making Harry’s broom act like that.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
He knew his Godfather favoured his snakes and tended to be a bit harsh to the lions, but he seemed to hate Harry even more than everyone else and Draco thought that something wasn't right with that picture. Although this wasn't the only thing that felt off to him. It was the fact that Harry obviously was keen on potions, but he didn't know any of the answers to Snape’s questions which were definitely in the textbook. His gut was telling him that he didn't forget either.
To achieve their ends.
When Flitwick left and the two Gryffindors ran off, jealousy thrummed through Draco's mind where he stood, not that he would admit it but he was jealous that he got shown up by his friend who had known nothing about Quidditch until he taught him the basics.
“No, I’m a half-blood but I grew up with ..um… muggles,” Harry responded, clearly unfamiliar with the term muggle.
“Your Harry Potter”, Draco whispered. “ My father will kill me.”
“Can you believe that Potter didn't know the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane. My little sister would know the answer to that.” Daphne snickered.
“Sorry, I'm fine,” Harry said, not meeting her eye.
Professor McGonagall began handing out timetables to the Gryffindors. When she handed the trio their timetables, Harry noticed they had a double potion lesson with the Slytherins first up. He heard Ron huff beside him as he looked at his timetable and threw it down on the table. Harry looked towards the Slytherin table to see Draco observing the other first-year Gryffindors which consisted of Dean, Seamus, Neville, Ron, Hermione, Lavender, Parvati and himself.
An abrupt sound of noise around him, brought him back to his surroundings, realising that Harry had climbed back on his broom and was speeding towards the ground, with Higgs hot on his trail. With a glance at the teacher's stand, Draco saw both Professors had stopped chanting and turned their attention back to the game.
“Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter.” Harry couldn't help thinking back to primary school. He would get bad grades and the teachers would ignore him but Snape was different for some reason. “What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”
Where those of wit and learning,
Oh, what the hell. Harry thought. Might as well try flying now.
Harry saw Hooch sigh and heard her mutter “Broken wrist.” She turned to the class as she helped Neville up and said “You will all stay where you are while I take this boy up to the infirmary. Touch those brooms and you’ll be out of the Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch’. Come along, dear.” With that, they trudged up to the castle.
“Oh, are you muggleborn then?” Draco asked.
”Really?!” Harry asked in disbelief.
"I know all about you of course-I got a few extra books for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century."
“10 points to Slytherin.” Snape smirked then barked “Why are you not copying this down!”
As they reached dry land once more, they all climbed out of the boats and hurried after Hagrid as he started to walk up to the castle. Once they had all caught up and walked up the stone stairs, Hagrid raised his giant-sized wrist to the door and knocked three times.
“Hmm, I'd have to get the headmaster to bend the rules but I can't stand if Slytherins win again, I couldn't look Severus in the eye for weeks.” She turned her attention back to Harry “Don't make me change my mind about giving you detention.” She then smiled “ Your father would be proud of you if he could see you now, your mother too.
But this comment made Harry’s blood boil with fury.
As per usual, Hermione's hand flew into the air, who was bursting with the need to answer.
“He's the right build for a seeker. We'd have to get him a decent broom Professor.”
And don't get in a flap!
Those cunning folks use any means
“I reckon he would’ve screamed like a little girl if he had been in your position,” Ron stated.
Snape's class was on another level of extreme. For Harry to despise this class more than Quirrel's, was saying something. Snape's constant criticizing and harsh comments were what made him hate the class since it would make Harry think of his uncle.
“Give it back,” Harry said louder than before but it was for naught since Draco had already kicked off and was in the air. He had to admit that Draco was a good flyer.
Harry followed with a sense of defeat, not missing how the Slytherins were sharing smirks of triumph as he and McGonagall walked up to the castle.
It was nearing midnight, coincidentally, and they were beginning to dose off into a slumber. As a result of the arrangement on the floor, some of them fell asleep on top of each other. Like Theo on top of Tracey and Mille had her head in Pansy’s lap.
H.J.P
So Harry went to tell him about the Cerberus and the small brown package Hagrid had collected on his birthday since Harry knew Draco could be trusted. As the story came to a close, Draco was left with many questions that the trio had been asking themselves for weeks.
Everyone joined in to applaud the hat, who grew silent once more. McGonagall stepped forward holding a piece of parchment and began reading names to step forward and try the hat on.
During Transfiguration with their head of house, they were again practising turning a match into a needle. Of course, Hermione had already perfected hers in the previous lesson and was now reading ahead in her textbook, most likely for the 10th time or something.
Of course, he had seen Harry and his friends throughout the day and they didn't look physically harmed in any way but he was dying to know what happened. It was not till Sunday afternoon that Draco got his chance.
“Prat.”
In an attempt to change the subject, Draco asked Pansy if there was any new gossip, he knew once she started there was no stopping her and he was right. “It's surprising what happens in just a day here. My mother wasn't kidding about the amount of gossip that spreads across the school.” She said excitedly.
"Thanks a million 'Mione!" Harry exclaimed happily and swiftly left Hermione and her studies behind him.
S.T.S
The pair got up from their seats when the other staff and students began leaving. They walked out of the Great hall with a bounce in their step. Draco quickly said to his friends that he would meet them in class and walked out of the hall at a fast pace, hoping to catch up with them before they entered their common room.
One by one, the whole gang was ready to go. A major rule in Slytherin house was that no one was to go anywhere alone in case an irritated Gryffindor stumbled across them, deciding to have a bit of fun.
"By any chance would you be Harry Potter." The girl asked enthusiastically.
“And your point is Parkinson?” Draco said, feeling bored.
"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
“Me too.” Pansy agreed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Harry." He replied, hoping they wouldn't recognize him— nope, too late.
He stepped forward. One. Two. Three. Until he was right in front of the troll and he swung. The bat hit the troll square in the stomach, causing it to hunch over and wail in agony, making Harry slip off in the process.
As he came down to the ground with his classmates, who looked at him with aww, a shrill voice rang through the air.
He then turned around and walked away from the trio.
Taking a deep breath, Harry opened his mouth to respond. “The truth is that your Godfather, Draco, makes me feel nervous and I couldn't remember anything. It was like everything I learnt just jumped out a window.”
And unafraid of toil;
Sparing a last glance at Ron, who slumped off in the direction of Filch's office, he jogged up to keep up with Snape's long strides as they left towards the chilly dungeons.
Harry was about to answer when he heard a voice that sounded like his uncle stopped him cold. ‘You ungrateful little freak. How dare you get better grades than our Dudders. If this ever happens again you're going to regret it, boy.’ Those words ringed in Harry’s ears. “ I don't know sir.” He replied quietly.
Who knows but Harry was grateful because otherwise, Mclaggen might’ve received a fist in the face as an early Christmas gift. Oh, Harry wished he could've seen McLaggen's face, it would've been priceless!
Harry took a breath and stated "Turning a match into a needle is easier than turning a desk into a pig since a match and a needle are similar in weight and proportion, making it easier to transfigure. It also requires less magic to change since they are both small and the change isn't very different, whereas the pig is very different to a desk considering it was alive and the desk is an inanimate object."
Recognising the elegant cursive writing, Harry was intrigued by what was so important. It would be a good time to tell him about what we found out at Hagrid’s. Shrugging, he stuffed the note in his robe pocket. Turning back to his friends, he noticed they were looking at him strangely.
All heads turned away from their work and focused on Seamus and their teacher who was sitting at her desk grading papers. "Mr Finnigan. I have already told you and your classmates why you will not be attempting that any time soon. Anyone care to remind Mr Finnigan why." McGonagall asked.
"Boot, Terry."
" Firs'-years! Firs'-years over here! All right there Harry?"
“Well after the Quidditch match, Hermione, Ron and I went to Hagrid’s and he let slip a few important pieces of information regarding what’s on the third corridor.”
"OI, PEABRAIN," Ron yelled as he threw a heavy piece of pipe which hit the troll, who merely grunted but still turned his attention to Ron.
“I'm his and it's a deal.” Weasel butted in without hesitation. Blaise nodded and smirked as he pulled Draco towards their table.
“Because you’re wrong, wait no Granger and Weasley are wrong.”
“Well nobody knows who it is. The team is keeping it under wraps. So some Slytherins are planning to go spy on their practice whenever that is.” Pansy looked around at her friends who were pretending to listen but weren't. Daphne was checking her nails, Tracy and Theo were probably thinking about what they were studying tomorrow, Millie was fiddling with a blanket, Blaise messing around with his hair, Greg and Vince staring off into the distance and Draco had his head down most likely thinking deeply about something dull. She smirked, she knew what to say to get their attention. “We are also holding a betting pool on who it is, winner takes all.”
Their daring, nerve, and chivalry
As the curfew loomed closer, they said their good nights and went their separate ways. Fortunately, they both found their way back to their common room without any further mishap.
Once the two team captains shook hands, while trying to crush each other’s fingers, they were off and up in the air.
"So the rumours on the train were true, Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts." Harry literally could feel everyone's eyes turn to himself and Draco at that. "The name's Malfoy. Draco, Malfoy." Ron snickered beside Harry causing Draco to shift his attention to Ron. "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to tell me yours. Red hair and a hand me down robe, you must be a Weasley." Ron's face turned red to match his hair at that statement. Draco then turned back to Harry with the perfect mask of emptiness, apart from the concern in his eyes that only Harry saw. " You'll find that some wizarding families are better than others Potter." He offered his hand and said, "I can help you there."
"I've read about trolls you see and I thought that I'd be able to do something. I wanted to test my knowledge but if it weren't for Harry and Ron I would be dead." She continued shakily. It was true for the most part, if not for Harry and Ron she would be in pieces and for that she would be forever grateful. She just hoped that she wouldn't get expelled for this predicament.
One thing was for sure, he wanted to get to know Harry at Hogwarts. He had been told what to do his whole life. It was time to start making his own decisions as his mother suggested. He was now looking forward to the train ride to go talk to the raven haired boy once more.
“So the Gryffindor team had an empty spot to fill in the role of the seeker but there are rumours that their captain has picked someone to be on the team.”
Draco’s face flushed from genuine embarrassment since he knew that they weren’t the only ones hearing this conversation.
How dare he accuse me of sabotaging Ron's potion to make me look good. Insults sure, mocking sure but accusing me, I don't like that at all.
“So to sum it all up, you nearly die from a barmy Headmaster’s plans and start to solve these said plans by poking your nose into where it doesn’t belong with your idiot friends. I’m in!”
When he brought up this matter with Ron and Hermione at lunch, they both had different reactions. Ron just told him he was being paranoid and went back to eating his food. Hermione on the other hand was concerned and suggested that they go look up curses in the library to see if there is anything on cursed scars. Harry shook his head and said, “Nah, I'm probably overreacting.” Although he was a bit disappointed that they didn’t even ask that he was ok but he didn’t mind too much as he was more focused on the upcoming flying lesson.
"RAVENCLAW."
Even the teachers were getting into the festive spirit. With decorating classrooms with floating angels and holly. Even the amount of school work had gone down considerably for the first years in light of the upcoming break. Well except in Snape’s class but that was nothing new, according to the older students. He continued to set many assigned readings and essays, which most definitely would turn into holiday work.
“I was there obviously and I witnessed the event too. Except I was more observant than your Gryffindor friends. By the way, don't you ever do that again-“
D.A.M
“My father will hear of this. It's unjust.”
Regardless of his thoughts, he knew shouting insults and foul words would not help him. So he inhaled deeply, trying to wash away his thoughts and focus on what his next course of action would be.
With that Harry left, oblivious to how the Potion Master stared at the gleaming cauldrons in disbelief.
“Now we must bow down to the high and almighty Blaise,” Draco said mockingly. There were many snickers of amusement while Blaise rolled his eyes.
Before Harry could question what the hat meant, it shouted out "GRYFFINDOR." At those words, Harry's heart sank lower than ever before. He had learnt that hope was a vicious thing. The Dursleys taught him that but he had wished that since he got away from them, things would go his way, but now another person was controlling his life yet again or so it seemed. Now it meant that it would be even harder to see Draco, his first friend he ever made. In the muggle or wizarding world.
A quick look at the teachers and Harry saw they didn't quite believe it either.
True to Harry’s word, Draco was smirking.
Draco soon found himself walking to the large Quidditch pitch. He saw a person on the ground and another in the air. As he got closer he hid behind a tree and could see the individuals. Harry was the one on the broom and Draco assumed the other was the Gryffindor captain.
All three Gryffindors turned to the head table to see Snape scowling at some older students down the table. Harry was unsure what to think of him since he remembered Draco telling him on the train that Snape was his Godfather.
When they finally reached the common room, Harry excused himself to go to the bathroom, although it was to escape from Ron and Hermione.
When things were tough and Draco just wanted to relax and not worry about his father's watchful eye, he would head out to the vast spreading grounds of Malfoy Manor. It was tranquil and it helped him think about his troubles as well as come to terms with things that had occurred throughout the day.
“Give it here Draco or I will knock you off your broom,” Harry called.
The whole class was dead silent. Ron, beside him, was staring at him as if he had grown a second head and Hermione looked outright insulted.
Or perhaps in Slytherin
As everyone began to file out, Harry gathered up his things and whispered a quiet goodbye to his friend. The plan was simple, Harry would leave first and Draco shortly after, to avoid the suspicion that they sat together. Then they would stage a rejected friendship in front of all the first years before they went through to the great hall, to make a rivalry seem plausible.
“Thank you, Theo. You see when Draco and I entered the Great Hall, I saw Potter and his friends so we walked over. We mocked him a bit and I challenged him to a duel against Draco, saying that I was his second. Then Weasel butted in and said that he was Potter’s second and he accepted.”
There's nothing hidden in your head
Grabbing at an opportunity, yes a stupid one but still an opportunity regardless, Harry launched himself onto the troll's back and jabbed his wand up one of the troll's nostrils.
H.J.P
It was a joyous time.
Harry was a loss at what to do. He was too scared to ask anyone at the train station to help, he didn’t want to be a bother. So instead of asking, Harry waited by platform 9 to see if he could spot another witch or wizard. At ten to nine, he spotted a group of people with red hair with a couple of trunks and an owl on a trolley. Harry moved closer to hear the mother explaining to her youngest children how to get onto the platform.
"Am I." He asked, feeling overwhelmed.
R&R please!
The stomach of a goat. Obviously.
Many people began to leave the Great Hall to prepare for class and after much persuasion from Hermione, the trio followed suit shortly after. It was a bit of a walk to the dungeons and they took at least three wrong turns but they finally found themselves standing opposite the classroom, standing as far away as possible from the Slytherins.
The only important thing right now was to track down his friend and see if he was alright, along with telling him what he had seen.
Draco knew that Harry would be disappointed since the snitch had been within his grasp but this was a game and the Slytherins were ready to stretch the rules thin for a win.
The blond narrowed his eyes in thought. Why would Harry ask such a thing?
Slytherin and Gryffindor firsties soon found themselves walking down to their flying lesson in the afternoon. There were two rows of broomsticks, the Gryffindors lined up on one side and the Slytherins on the other. Their instructor Madam Hooch had amber coloured eyes which scanned the whole class like a hawk before she started reciting how to mount a broom. They were told to stick their dominant hand over the broom handle and say up. Harry’s broom, with a few other people, jumped straight into his hand, although others were having difficulties.
Chapter 7: A Midnight Trick
"Mate, first off, that was bloody brilliant and did you see the look on Hermione's face when McGonagall asked you instead of her. It was a pleasant change from having her recite from the stupid textbook. She's such a teacher's pet." Before he could say more, Hermione pushed past them with tears falling helplessly down her face.
Harry could see that Draco didn't fully believe him but seemed to be contemplating something. Draco then sighed as if he lost a big battle and said “Well I can tell you he doesn't have the title of the greasy dungeon bat for nothing.” The pair couldn't help burst out laughing, forgetting momentarily their argument
"I can't believe it." He exclaimed. Draco followed Blaise's gaze to see an irritated Granger and a happy but worn out Harry and his redhead friend eating their breakfast.
A thought occurred in Draco's head that made him smirk in amusement.
Potion's class continued but things only got worse for the Gryffindors. Snape stalked down the aisles between the desks and breathed heavily down all the Gryffindors necks which made it harder to concentrate. Harry made a few mistakes and rough cuts to his ingredients to make his potion average which got him some death glares and being mocked but he was fairing better than Neville. His potion exploded, which earned him a detention.
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
Snape started the class by taking the roll call, and he paused at Harry's name.
“Yeah, let's go,” Harry replied.
The two Gryffindors hadn't got far when Draco caught up to them. As Draco got closer, he could see the package was in the shape of a broom. What the hell would Harry need a broom for? Curiosity got the better of him and said "Hey Potter, how come you have a broom?"
A/N School is beginning to get hectic, so I am sorry if you all have to wait longer.
He left through the portrait hole, ignoring the Fat Lady’s complaints. Since it was before curfew, he knew he was allowed out but since it was still his first day so he took multiple wrong turns before ending up by the charms classroom.
"Please Professor. It was my fault." Hermione said quietly.
It did not take long before plans started to form in Harry's head.
Harry caught on quickly and replied “You're just jealous Malfoy. That despite being all rich and flaunting your wealth, you got shown up by a Gryffindor. What will your dear housemates say about that huh.”
"What do you want, Harry? I'm trying to work on my essay Professor Sprout set for us" Hermione asked impatiently.
As he stepped through the hole in the wall that was revealed after saying the password, he went over to a board, next to the notices, with all the bets and placed his next to the many others.
At Harry’s nod, Draco continued “I've heard that name before but for the life of me I can't remember.” He finished with a scowl.
I'll eat myself if you can find
Thank you all for the many views on my story. I honestly expected nobody to read this. Thank you to the reviews on the story . They have given me some ideas for later in the series. *Smiles mischievously*
Momentarily those thoughts were forgotten as golden plates appeared with streaming hot food across the table. Everyone moved to begin eating but they didn't get very far because Professor Quirrel sprinted into the Great hall and up to the head table, causing everyone to look his way.
“I-um,” Harry mumbled while his emerald green eyes gazed at Draco as if he was contemplating what to say next to the blond. Draco’s own silver-blue eyes gazed back at the emerald eyes, curiously waiting for what Harry had to say.
McGonagall regained her composure and said with a small proud smile "Indeed Mr Potter. 15 points to Gryffindor."
“If you're sure.” She said, obviously doubting him but continued “Both of you, follow me.”
Relief thrummed through Draco's mind at the sight although not making it shown on his face. "The cunning and sneaking Blaise Zabini was outplayed by two Gryffindor idiots." Draco mocked, all his friends fell into snickers hidden by their hands while Blaise sneered at Draco and began eating.
They had decided to meet up in an unused classroom to practise the patronus charm. It had seemed like a good idea at first, but now Draco was starting to have doubts about it as he stood outside the door and waited for Potter. What if Draco was so bad at it that Potter decided he wasn’t worth it and in general would stop hanging out with him? That would really suck, because unfortunately Potter was one of the only people to actually speak decently to him, and definitely the only one to actually seek out his company willingly. Looked like once again, Draco had become completely dependent on Potter’s good will. His father would have disowned him, if he hadn’t been going crazy in Azkaban at the moment.
Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s hand burning through his clothes. He almost didn’t notice Harry asking him something: “Hmm, Draco, what would you say moonstone would do to this potion?” Harry leaned further towards him, if that even was possible. He wasn’t even looking at Draco, no he was still looking at his potions book, but had, what Draco presumed to be subconsciously, leaned closer. Their shoulders were so close to touching.
"Yes, Potter. What do you want?" Draco desperately hoped Stupid Harry Potter couldn't hear the small quiver in his voice.
“No!” Harry protested. “I promise. We were sitting at that little table in the back of the library. You know the one where there really isn’t room for two people, so we were sitting a bit crammed in… maybe he got really annoyed that i kept moving around and accidentally hitting him with my arm and leg? No, he would just have told me to piss off then instead.” Harry trailed of unsure.
When it finally was time for them to leave the train Draco tried getting to the carriages as quickly as possible, avoiding everybody else and keeping his head low. The students around him seemed more caught up in their own world and each other to really care about him at this point. He would take whatever blessings he could get. Fortunately, he also managed to lose Stupid Harry Potter in the crowd.
When he didn’t get a reaction at first Draco turned his head and saw Stupid Harry Potter’s Stupid face looking at him with surprise.
"Fuck you, Potter," Draco tried maintaining his signature frown, but he felt his mouth quirk upwards at the thought that Harry Potter was his friend now. Just like he had always wanted.
"I'-I'm not stalking you, I'm just talking to you," Stupid Harry Potter looked genuinely confused.
"Potter, do you even have any other friends? You're spending all your time here with me?" Draco said softly to avoid Potter’s anger.
Draco walked with a straight back, clutching his things close to his chest and trying to pretend like he wasn’t walking next to the-boy-who-had-saved-them-all. this proved to be a rather hard thing to do, since the before mentioned saviour of the British Wizarding World would not stop talking. He just kept prattling on about something. Exactly what, Draco wasn’t too sure about, possibly quidditch? Stupid Harry Potter was talking so fast and incoherent, and Draco hadn't really kept up with who was winning this years cup, so he really could not care less. Suddenly, Draco noticed, the stream of words next to him stopped and Stupid Harry Potter was looking at him expectantly.
“You know he probably also feels like he owes you a lot and is scared that you’re just doing this to mess him about,” Ron lifted his hands to stop Harry’s outburst. “I’m not saying you would do that. Malfoy have just rarely made any sense if you ask me”
"Nothing, Hermione and Ron are making out in our compartment and I got tired of third wheeling them. So I went for a walk and found you."
“But it’s not fair that they can just attack you like that and get away with it, while you would be the one punished just for defending yourself. We shouldn’t be this prejudiced anymore, the war is over,” Harry - no Potter… Oh well, Harry grumbled with his eyebrows drawn together. “Yeah, yeah. I know what you’re gonna say. You were a Deatheater bla bla bla. It shouldn't matter. You clearly didn’t actually support Voldemort and anybody who had just paid attention to you for more than two seconds could easily have seen that.” Harry covered his face with his hands, and kept mumbling on about unfairness and the stupidity of others.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You say you were touching him a lot before he ran of?” Ron chimed in throwing a knowing look at Hermione. “Remember what I told you about when Malfoy was in the hospital wing. The looks.”
The Slytherin table was quite sparsely populated and one could suppose that he should have expected it, but it still hurt looking down and seeing the empty spaces where people had sat before. People who were dead or in prison or simply choosing to continue their education elsewhere. He didn’t really fault the other Slytherins from his year for not coming back. It was the logical thing to do really, and it wasn’t their fault that Draco was forced to be here.
"Oh... Do you want me to stop. I can leave you alone if I'm bothering you" Draco felt the fight slowly fizzle out of him as he looked at Stupid Harry Potter and his Stupid puppy dog eyes filled with a hurt that really had to be a show.
“What! I have not, well maybe just a little bit in like sixth year, okay and maybe in second year when i thought you were the heir of Slytherin, but other than that not at all,” Harry raised his head and looked flustered around the room.
“Yes!” Potter punched the air with his fist like he was trying to punch away something above his head. It must be one of his weird muggle habits. Without noticing Draco’s confused looks, he began laying out his potions things on the table.
"It’s just that Hermione and Ron are off snogging again and I'm so bored"
“Sure, Potter, whatever you say…” Draco lifted his right eyebrow in mockery of Harry who was rapidly turning more and more red. Draco couldn’t help smiling a little. “Hey Potter, if you keep on stalking me at least like make it visible to other people so they will be scared of the big .. uh.. good? saviour coming for them if they hurt his favourite Slytherin.”
“Uh, I, uh, I gotta go,” Draco ran out of the library leaving everything behind. He stopped and hid in an alcove covering his face with both hands. What was happening to him? Did Harry put some sort of weird spell on him? Maybe Harry was playing the long game and if he messed enough with Draco’s mind he eventually would be able to convince Draco to do something crazy for him. Well, as it was now Draco probably would do just about anything for Harry Potter.
“Well, Potter, you would know wouldn’t you since you basically have been stalking me since second year,” Draco said with a cheerful grin.
“If I can do anything let me know,” Harry turned his head and kissed Draco’s cheek and then stood up. “I’m getting hungry do you wanna go see if the kitchen has anything good?”
this chapter is a bit short, but enjoy nonetheless!
Harry had been right… It did take a while before Madam Pomfrey deemed him fit to leave the hospital wing. She kept him longer than first anticipated because he had a relapse after waking up from a nightmare so bad he didn’t sleep for a full day. His head was full of what if’s. He was sure that people would wait at every corner to send him right back to his bed in the wing, but surprisingly people just ignored him. It was quite suspicious how he could now walk from class in a crowded hallway and his bag would be intact when he got to the next class. Draco did think Harry might’ve had something to do with it. Everytime Draco saw those three Ravenclaws, they would turn around and walk in the opposite direction of him. He once overheard them muttering about how he wasn’t worth it and Harry could stop staring daggers at them all the time. Draco also couldn’t help but notice on the first few day after he was released from the hospital wing that they seemed to be limping. Whatever Harry had done to them, Draco couldn’t help be grateful even though he probably should be learning to fight his own battles.
"But it’s Hogwarts?"
“Hmm, Harry so you say you asked him a question about potions and then he ran of?” Hermione looked contemplatively at him. “And you’re absolutely sure nothing else happened? You didn’t accidently say something bad about him or his parents or anything?”
“Alright, you big loser. Draco Malfoy you are my very favourite Slytherin in the whole wide world,” He tried keeping a straight face but cracked and let his head fall down on the bed next to draco, his hair just tickling Draco’s exposed arm. Draco thought he could get used to this.
“Me?! I didn’t do anything! It was those awful Ravenclaws! They just attacked you in the hallway. And you were on the ground when I came and they were still cursing you. It was so.. so cowardly!” Potter exclaimed. Potter’s hands was twisting his black hair making it even more unruly than on average.
“Draco?” Harry waved his hand in front of his face. This finally seemed to break Draco out of his daze. “You alright there, mate?”
"Oh, I'm going there too. We can walk together." Maybe Stupid Harry Potter's plan was to get Draco to do his homework? That wouldn’t be the worst this that could happen he supposed.

new chapter ! hope you enjoy! this one was really fun to write:)
Headmistress Mcgonagall gave a long speech about school unity and how they had to help each other overcome these hard times and bla bla bla something something prejudice. Quite hypocritical of her Draco thought, as if she hadn’t been the one to throw all of the Slytherins under the hippogriff just a few months ago when Pansy had wanted to give up Stupid Harry Potter to the Dark Lord. Admittedly a terribly foolish thing to suggest. However, it still didn’t give Mcgonagall the right to just assume that every single Slytherin was evil. Especially since there were small children present. Well, it wasn’t really Draco’s problem anymore now was it, she could bloody well talk all she wanted about inter-house unity; it wouldn’t work.
"What?" Draco said with a frown raising his eyebrows.
"What? Oh it's full and I really need your help on the potion test, coz I really dont know why I decided that it would be a good idea to take potions," Harry sent him his big puppy eyes and pouted. Draco was not at all affected by this and it was not at all the reason he agreed easily to help out Harry even though he was struggling with herbology.
“Harry, I really don’t understand what you see in him, but I will let you two alone. You really deserve each other,” Weasley gave him one last look that Draco couldn’t decipher and turned around and marched out the hospital wing.
On one these occasions Draco could have sworn it was that Patil girl from Gryffindor. So not even Stupid Harry Potter's friends were too good to some good ol' hallway bullying. How lovely.
Harry hadn’t seen Draco in a while now. Not since he so abruptly ran from the library when they were studying there. Harry didn’t really know what had happened. It was all very confusing. Had he done something? He couldn’t really recall anything out of the ordinary. Maybe he should ask Hermione since she usually could point out things he himself had overseen.
“Draco,” Potter breathed in. “You’re awake.”
Harry laid in his bed staring up at the ceiling. What had he done to make Draco run of like that?
Harry took Draco’s face between both of his hands and kissed him square on the mouth. Draco hands found Harry’s hair as he dragged Harry back down to the bench.
The Sorting went by for longer than usual mostly on account of all the muggleborns who didn’t get letters last year. Draco could muster up a bit of pity for all the bright eyed eleven-year-olds who were sorted into Slytherin. It would not be easy for them. Well it wouldn’t be easy for any of them. Draco could excuse them for leaving such a huge gap in between themself and him. He didn't mind at all. What was even the point anymore? Well, there was one thing he minded a great deal and that was Stupid Harry Potter staring at him from across the hall. He wasn’t even doing anything just staring while talking to his fellow Gryffindors.
harry starts stalking draco. draco is confused.
"Try telling that to all the students that lost family and friends to the Dark Lord’s cause and all the people tortured last school year," Draco didn't even have the energy to sound aggravated; he was too tired. Tired with his life. With this conversation and most of all with Stupid Harry Potter who never could keep his Stupid Hero nose out of other people’s business.
“Harry, just think about how the two of you always have been circling each other and now that you’re finally allowed to actually be friendly, well it might be a lot for Malfoy. He probably haven’t really been allowed to feel these things and act on them. Especially, when it comes to you. I would guess that he’s  probably very confused and scared right now.” Harry could do nothing but stare at Ron and Hermione.
A voice woke Draco and at first he couldn’t understand where he was. Everything was so bright and white, but as his eyes slowly took in the surroundings he realised that it was the hospital wing.
“Draco, you really scared me. You were just lying there on the floor and not even fighting back. They would have killed you if I hadn’t arrived,” Harry - no Potter looked at him with genuine worry in his eyes. Well, it was nice to know that Harry - no Potter cared.
“Draco,” he breathed out as the heat soaked through his cloak. “You’re here.”
Maybe Stupid Harry Potter finally got Dracos malaise with the whole situation or he just didn't know what to answer, but no matter, Stupid Harry Potter finally shut up and he too looked out the window. Draco relaxed his shoulders and was able to actually focus on the landscape outside. The trees and hills flying by had a calming effect and Draco almost forgot that Stupid Harry Potter was sitting there across from him.
"Probably the latter, except permanently," Stupid Harry Potter smirked at him and had the audacity to wink at Draco, too. "But for real do you wanna play?"
"Um.. just a feeling?" Stupid Harry Potter said more as a question. Draco lifted his eyebrows.
"Exactly," sighed Draco. "Not all of us are gonna get star treatment when we get there like you, boy saviour and the rest of the golden trio"
Oh for Merlin’s sake. He told the small voice in his mind. He did absolutely not fancy Harry Potter!
“Um, I didn’t really understand what Madam Pomfrey was saying but it seems like they really did a number on you, Draco,” Potter said concerned.“I think it might be a while.”
"Then why did you ask, " Draco looked one last time at Stupid Harry Potters face and leaned his head to rest against the window. He closed his eyes and muttered: "Merlin, Potter, you’re so stupid. Can you please make up your mind, or let me sleep."
"I know, but it’s embarrassing like I don’t have any other friends, and I do understand that they want to have some time just the two of them."
Helping Harry turned out to be the worst mistake of his life. Harry really did not know how to concentrate at all. Draco of course having noticed that Harry rarely sat still when he was on the other side of table. However, it was a straight up nightmare when he was sitting next to him. Harry kept changing his position and thus happened the accidental touching. This meant that Draco’s concentration got broken every single time as much as a single hair brushed him. He was acutely aware of every spot the two of them touched. Harry changed his position again, but this time he left his knee leaning against Draco’s leg. Draco tensed up but couldn’t bring himself to move away from Harry’s touch. Something was very wrong with Draco and it was most definitely Harry Potter’s fault. Oh, how the tables had turned.
