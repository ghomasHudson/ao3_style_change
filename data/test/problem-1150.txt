Her comment sounded casual, but I got the message. I blushed. I got a piece of toast and started spreading butter on it furiously. As if to make the moment more memorable, Harry showed up. Instead of his usual dark Auror robes, he was wearing muggle clothes. His jeans outlined the perfection of his hips and strong legs. The green sweater made his eyes glow brighter. He was wearing glasses, which was quite rare these days. His jet-black hair seemed properly tamed, which was a shame.
“You realise that now you couldn’t kill me even if you wanted to, right?” Nathan reminded him gently.
“Yes, but no one can explain what happened today,” Ron muttered to himself. “Who the hell is behind all of this? Lucius Malfoy? He was there, right? Doing what?”
“I know it’s late, and I know I should have called you,” Harry said quickly. “I just didn’t have the time to do it and my cell phone service was down, so... I’m sorry.” Draco opened his mouth to speak but Harry got ahead of him again, “Yes, I ate. Well, I had lunch with Ron and I ate an apple around five, but you don’t have to get out of bed. I can fix something up for myself.”
The teenager Harry Potter had been so easy to read, perhaps because of the purity in his heart. His feelings had always been right there for anyone to see them. The adult Harry Potter, however, was more complicated. He had lived too much, seen and felt too many things to remain the same. His green eyes were still warm, but they were not inviting. It wasn’t easy to know what was on his mind. It was such a pity. I missed the old Harry Potter.
When Scorpius got sick, I remember Astoria touching her forehead with his so as to measure his temperature. Afterwards, she would kiss it gently. For an instant, I imagined Harry doing the same with me. Our mouths were so close that our breathing was mixing together sweetly. I let myself go. My eyes got lost in his. I felt inebriated. I licked my lips.
Three days later, Harry, Draco, Seamus and all the Weasleys waited outside the Ministry of Justice’s courtroom for Harry’s hearing. Harry walked back and forth; Ron whispered something to George; Mr and Mrs Weasley discussed the insulting price of the parking lot and Hermione had taken Nathan to the bathroom. Seamus seemed to be the only one calm enough to be himself.
“You are pregnant, aren’t you?” Lucius asked, putting his worse fears in words. “I know you are because that potion couldn’t possibly go wrong. Well, not exactly…”
The hours passed by slowly. In the meantime, Harry took Nathan to Neville and made sure his son was ok. He just couldn’t explain why Draco had asked him to call Neville, after all, there seemed to be nothing wrong with Nathan. His son was just sleeping. Knowing that Nathan was fine didn’t help Harry to calm down, though. Neville had had to give him a sedative or Harry would have had a heart attack.
Draco watched, bewildered, both men whispering in each other’s ear with an intimacy that he never thought he would witness in Lucius. His father wasn’t the mushy type as he said it himself, but he did look kind of... tamed.
“Oh, God! Draco!” Harry exclaimed with horror on his face. “What if Nostrils” Lucius growled that it wasn’t Nostrils but Nostrums and Harry said, upset, “Whatever! What if he’s after Draco? What if he’s got him?”
Lucius sighed impatiently. “Just believe me, Draco. For once. I have no intention to harm you, only help you. I let Nathan go. If I was interested in him, I would have him by now. That’s not my goal, though.”
The poor little pointed-ear creature looked at Harry with big eyes begging for forgiveness and came forward. House-elves had magical powers, and they could only use them at their master's wishes. Sadly, the only way they could be freed from their slavery was if their master presented them with socks. But Dobby knew that it would never happen, so he would be forever Draco's slave, bounded by his master's stupid orders.
Harry walked slowly towards Draco and stopped only inches away. “And how can you tell? I look just like him, don’t I?” Harry’s hands slid down Draco’s face, neck and belly. Draco felt nauseous. “I have green eyes, I wear glasses. I even have his bloody scar. Do you want to touch me and see if we’re alike in other areas? I can guarantee we are. Mmm... Maybe I’m bigger, but that’s a good thing, isn’t it?” Harry guided Draco’s hand to his cock. “Do you feel it? It only takes a little rubbing to get it ready for action.”
Harry’s intention, however, was noble. It would be interesting to go back to the club at least that once to see him. I’d seen Harry making speeches before. Every word that came out of his mouth was full of passion. He adored everything he did and I loved him for that.
“Yeah, I bet he would.” Draco looked at Brutus with an angry face as if telling him that he should have stopped Nathan from getting out of the house. The dog whined. “But there’s not much a dog can do against magic, Nat.”
I had fun thinking about Harry’s reaction when he finally realised that the Auror responsible for inspecting the raid in my house after the war - a man who was now retired – had been properly paid up by my mother to leave some things behind.
Draco drank it and complained about its bad taste. Harry explained all that Neville had told him about the disease and Draco couldn’t believe that Harry had let Longbottom examine him. Of all people, Neville was the last person Draco expected to become a doctor. Harry was annoyed by Draco’s prejudice but he didn’t say anything because Draco wasn’t well yet. The only thing he said was that Neville had a trainee’s license and he was a very reputed doctor.
“Oh, no, dear. I think you’ve already played the dominant male quite enough last night. It’s my turn now.”
“No. But he can’t break free from my influence, Draco. He isn’t strong enough. Creevey will bring Harry Potter to me.”
There was an understanding between us. I smiled at him so as not to worry him. I’m not sure it worked. He was still quite serious. I caressed his hair and he finally relaxed. I felt like squeezing him in my arms like I used to do with Scorpius.
Talk about humiliation. I made a face at his cheekiness. I couldn’t blame him for his honesty. He was right. I was no Harry Potter.
Astoria showed up with little Angel by her side while I was having a cup of tea with milk. He was now properly dressed up in Scorpius’ old clothes. He really was a remarkably beautiful boy. His tiny mouth and nose were perfect. The once dirty brown hair was now silky and shiny. His green eyes sparkled with joy. Astoria made him sit on a chair that was proper for someone his size.
He left of the living room and Harry followed him. He watched Nathan entering the cupboard and taking his little pillow – the same that had belonged to Harry in the past – and a small piece of blanket. Harry recognised it to be the same one that had been wrapping the body of his son the last time he had seen him. Harry fought the urge to cry.
Nathan shrugged. He hadn’t understood the vision himself but something was telling him that his sister would give him a lot of trouble in the future. She would be quite a troublemaker.
The main target of my injustices was only a few feet away, and my heart beat faster as it felt him near me. My eyes searched for him instinctively, but it was best to hold my urges.
“It’s not easy to trust people, but Potter is someone who would take pity on his enemy and even help him in the end. You can trust him.”
"Don’t try to stop me, Harry!" Draco pulled away and put on his coat. "Come on, Brutus, let’s take a stroll around the neighbourhood."
When he laid him in his bed, Nathan slept instantly. He watched Nathan for a while, thinking that he was already looking like a caring father around him. He made sure that Nathan was safe by putting more pillows around him so he wouldn’t fall out of the bed. Then he went back to the living room to talk to Hermione.
“I did notice. I was just... Well, there was too much going on in my life for me to care about it. I just thought...” Harry sighed. “It doesn’t matter anymore.”
Whatever Lucius was planning, Harry wouldn’t let him lay a finger on his family. He’d protect Draco and his unborn child with his life.
My heart, which until then had been hurting because of Scorpius’ departure to Hogwarts, now seemed to be ready to come out of my mouth and bounce all around the platform. It beat so erratically that I was afraid that Potter might hear it. Our eyes met briefly but intensely. I was so caught up in the moment I didn’t hear Astoria calling me. It took me a while to answer her in fact.
No one answered. Brutus hadn’t barked, which meant that they weren’t home. He sighed and picked up the phone, dialling Draco’s ice-cream parlour. At the other end of the line, Daphne answered and told him that he had missed Draco by a second.
“No, Harry! I tried but I couldn’t get you out of my mind. He’s a great guy, though. I’m mad at him for what he did without my consent, but I know how much he loves Thomas.” Draco started walking back and forth in the room with his hands shoved in his pockets. “I know how he feels and I can understand why he did it although I wouldn’t have done the same.”
“It was amazing. In my first examination, I thought I would have to be careful with Draco’s caesarean, but by some miracle, I found nothing wrong with the baby as I was doing a second check-up. And Draco was great throughout the whole procedure. Of course, Severus was assisting me, and Draco seems to respect him a lot.”
I let out a sigh. Everything was horrible and wonderful at the same time. Deep down I was glad, though.
“I don’t think you do,” Nathan said seriously. “There are only a few people who can take a hold of the Corona of Power, and you’re not one of them.”
“I need you to be strong, Lily. We’re in big trouble. There’s a crazy demon after Harry, so I need to get out of here to save your father. What do you say, Lily? Can we work together?” Draco smiled to himself. “If only you could understand me. Maybe you do... Well, if you do, welcome to the Potter-Malfoy family. We have the tendency to attract danger... but hey, you’ll have two dads who love you, and a little brother that is already very protective of you.”
Nathan crossed his fingers around his back. He’d seen Uncle Siri doing the same with Uncle Moony once. That way he wouldn’t be breaking his promise, because he’d never really agreed to it. Not with his fingers crossed.
I could tell by his reaction he was not expecting me to say that. His eyes glinted with amusement. Making sure no one was around, he got closer. I licked my lips in anticipation.
He was about to try to open the door again when he heard a sudden commotion at the other side. People were shouting and screaming, and the noises were coming closer to his room.
“There’s nothing wrong with him,” Harry said quickly. He didn’t want Nathan to think that there could be something wrong. “It’s just that I want you to have a look at him. He said the Dursleys never took him to a doctor before. I just want to make sure that everything is ok.” Nathan shuddered in Harry’s arms all of a sudden. “What is it, Nat?”
Harry woke up lost and confused with Brutus barking madly at his side. He took a while to focus on his environment, and the first thing he noticed was that he was alone on the bed. He called for Draco, but the only sound he could hear was Brutus barking.
Harry’s tight hug almost crushed his bones. Draco’s embrace wasn’t so tight, but Nathan felt his every emotion. He kissed Draco and Harry, not caring anymore if the other children laughed at him.
“Neither are you!” Draco replied. “You refuse to forgive him, to give him the love he needs and deserves.”
“No. I’m a demon. Thanks to the Corona’s power, I’ve been given any form I desire. I decided to be Harry Potter. He seems well-connected, and people really fear him. I don’t really know why he’s so feared, though. He’s sickeningly good. I read his heart before I changed into him. The thing that caught my attention the most was how deeply he cares for you. He loves you. I’ll make good use of that.”
Harry realised that he did an awful thing the moment he’d chosen to call Draco’s attention instead of Bob’s. Draco was hurt, and he knew it. But honestly, who could expect him to think rationally in a time like that? He didn’t have time to lose. He would see his son after so many years of guilt, thinking that he was dead because of whom he was – the son of the Boy-Who-Lived. Draco, more than anyone else, should understand that.
The offer was tempting. I did miss my old wand. The first one was obviously unforgettable. It mirrored the wizard’s soul. It was not a coincidence that mine had been taken away by Harry and subdued to him so easily. Perhaps my wand was destined to be his all along. Perhaps my wand was my love declaration.  I wonder if he had ever thought of that. I felt like laughing hysterically.
"I was ready to give up on everything to be with Nathan, Draco. I was going to abandon the wizarding world and just disappear with my son. But Voldemort appeared one day when I wasn’t around and he killed my son. My son, Draco. He was so small and helpless. Why did it have to happen? He wasn’t a threat to anyone and the bastard killed him!" Harry was crying and so was Draco. The blond enlaced his arms around Harry and brought him closer.
I could answer that love was complicated, but I don’t think that was the answer he expected – or was ready – to hear.
“I hope you haven’t stroked Brutus’ fur with this hand, Mister.” He took Nathan in his arms and kissed his cheek. “Hi. How are you?”
He found one almost at the end. He sat on the seat and looked outside, spacing out almost immediately. It was an exercise he did every time people’s emotions got too much under his skin. Draco’s and Harry’s emotions had almost been too much for him, so now he needed to distance himself from them or he would collapse.
Lucius had participated in that plan, but he was now itching for revenge of the double-cross he had suffered.
I was having a lot of fun. Mr Karl threw dagger-looks at Harry, who just smiled with false innocence. I wondered if Matilda was having second thoughts about letting Harry into her Club of snobs. As I looked at her, however, she seemed completely at ease. I frowned, asking myself what exactly was going through her mind.
“Of course not!” Ron exclaimed, messing Nathan’s hair. “If this room wasn’t magically sealed, this little fellow here would have gone outside to fight, Harry.”
Harry didn’t have to wait for too long. In less than five minutes, Neville appeared at the door with a curious expression. He stared at father and son with amusement. He had read about Nathan on the newspapers, but he hadn’t seen him until that moment. Ana, his secretary, seemed enchanted by the child’s gaze, and now he could understand why. Indeed, the little boy looked very charismatic.
"Yes, we do! You need to face it, Harry, whatever it is. Why are you so scared to see what's in there?"
“Look, Bob, I have things to do that are making my mind drift away. So I’m sorry if I’m being so...”
Draco quickly cut him off, "I can give you a cheering ice-cream! Or coffee ice-cream! You love those!"
Nathan had a flash of himself with the age of sixteen and a boy with the age of eleven who kept walking after him, trying to make him lose his calm posture. Nathan’s friends made fun of the boy, but Nathan had ignored their attention and smiled at him. The boy looked away but smiled back, and Nathan felt his heart melting. He wondered if he was having a vision of the future.
Before he could stop him, though, Harry jumped on him and tickled him mercilessly. Draco laughed and told him to go to hell. They fought with each other like two children. In the end, the childish game turned into a more adult one. Harry stole a kiss from Draco, who did not resist him. The slow and innocent kiss instantly turned into a hot and intense one. They discarded their clothes quickly, their bodies anxious to feel the other.
“It’s water under the bridge, Potter. If I remember correctly, I paid a small fortune in fines for that particular episode.”
Draco watched as Brutus put his head on his lap and looked at him with his big eyes full of sadness. It didn't take long before Draco gave up by stroking his head gently.
“I know what’s like, believe me. What’s this?” Hermione picked up the parchment that was lying on the table.
"No. She thought I was worried about Voldemort and I guess she was also worried because she never really got over Cedric. That’s why I think she never said anything about the baby. She was afraid for him, and she was right. I have this talent for losing everyone that I love."
His green eyes looked dangerous as he stared at me. I took a step forward without even realising. It was now or never. Harry didn’t even blink. He just kept staring, challenging me to come closer.
He made a face. “What’s up with you people and this bloody don’t-do-anything-stupid thing? I’m not a child! I can take care of myself.”
Draco chuckled. “Merlin, no! I checked for spells. There were none. And before you tell me that I’m not an Auror so how the hell do I know, I also asked Ron to check the bear for me. He didn’t find anything. This time my father is actually trying to please us.”
Draco gave him a weak smile and went back to sleep. Half an hour later, his friends entered the bedroom again and handed him a bottle with a red liquid in it. Harry smelled it and was surprised at how good its aroma was.
On July 31, when he turned 21 years old, he decided to give up on love. He was convinced that his destiny was to live a lonely life forever and more. There were no sparkles when he had sex with someone. His heart didn’t beat faster at the sight of anyone. His feet didn’t lift up like in a black and white old movie - when the couple kissed each other and the world seemed to disappear, gaining suddenly an entirely different meaning. His love life was boring. And since it was like that, he made a deal with himself. He would be alone for the rest of his life but he wouldn’t suffer because of it.
‘Good,’ I answered with my best poker face. ‘Scorpius is doing great in Hogwarts. He is one of the best in his class, and he’s been thinking about joining the Quidditch team.’
They both stood up and left for their respective bedrooms. Harry entered his carefully, wanting nothing more than to just fall in the large bed and cuddle Draco. Draco wasn’t in the room though which made him worried. He was about to search for him when Draco opened the door and came in. Harry noticed the puffy red eyes and flinched. He couldn’t bear to know that Draco had been crying because of him and his stupid dark mood.
I caught her hand. It was as cold as mine. We were not used to exchanging caresses, but I missed some human touch sometimes. Not having Scorpius around was killing me. I used to hug him all the time. I wondered if he missed us as well. The answer was probably yes, but with his busy life at Hogwarts, he most certainly had no time to spend missing his parents. I thought about writing to him. I wouldn’t mention Albus Severus. When Scorpius was ready, I was sure he would tell me about him.
Brutus barked but didn’t move. Draco assumed that Harry wasn’t in the house. He cursed Harry for leaving him alone. Dr Jules had warned them that Draco’s delivery might come sooner than expected. Draco was terrified of having contractions while Harry wasn’t around.
I missed him. As I looked at Astoria and the kids, I truly wished I was in love with her. It would be great if we could live a real marriage. If only Harry Potter hadn’t claimed ownership of my heart.
“Ok. Go ahead then!” Draco stepped back, sneering in a way that Harry hated it, “Be stupid but also be ready to face the consequences afterwards.”
Draco kissed him softly on the lips. "That was why you didn’t want to live then. Everything makes sense now. I don’t know what to say to you, Harry. I’m shocked."
Seeing their scared faces, Dr Jules had told them not to worry. He prescribed five different kinds of vitamins. Harry assured him that he wouldn’t make Draco forget about them. They went home rather silent, each lost in their own thoughts and worries.
Nathan shook his head and Harry winked at him behind Draco’s back. He gave his family one last hug and then climbed on board. He shot one last look at them all, missing his daily routine already, but knowing that he would construct another one, one that he would enjoy just the same. He watched them fade away as the train gained speed, and only then he went to find an empty compartment.
“What brings you here?” Draco asked. “Harry is not in, he’s at the Ministry. I’m surprised you didn’t run into him. I mean, he’s with Ron. Isn’t he?”
Harry giggled. “I’m just kidding. Well, sort of. But Hermione is different. She’s almost like a guy.”
Draco mumbled something he didn’t understand. Harry stood up; picked up the phone and called two people he thought could help him in that situation: Neville Longbottom and Hermione G. Weasley.
And why did they have to fight? Their honeymoon had been so perfect. Why did Draco have to ruin everything on their first night back at home? Why did he have to ruin it, too? Harry had to admit that he was as guilty as Draco on that matter, after all, he had been the one who had turned a rational conversation into a heated argument.
Feeling bold, I got my body next to him and was delighted to feel the warmth coming from his body. I didn’t want to behave at all. I wanted to break the rules, get under his skin. We had slept together. I had that victory over him. Nothing else matters.
As time went by, Nostrums became quieter and quieter. The object of his affection didn’t seem to notice him at all. He became darker, sullen and moody, and he stopped working. One day he was expelled from the Temple. They told him he couldn’t stay anymore because he had a stain in his heart, and he had thought that the stain was love.
He remembered the time he fought against the Death Eaters in Voldemort’s war, and his mind drifted to Seamus. Was his friend all right? Seamus hadn’t been with Fred and Lee when they had saved Draco.
“…there’s a bigger destiny that was made for us/So don’t let troubles bring you down/Believe in the foundation of our love/Can’t you see my faith in you is forever and more… Don’t let go… ‘Coz it’s just a step from heaven… and the strength of love is on our side…”
“I know. That’s one more reason why we have to find a descendant of Harvest. We need a Location spell,” Harry took his wand out of his pocket. “Get me a map.”
Harry just gave him a gentle smile, one that said Draco was silly but adorable. The blond didn't like that at all, but he was unable to show just how angry he was when Harry kissed him again leisurely.
“NO!” Ron got closer to Harry looking very irritated. “It’s not a bloody sacrifice! You’re my best friend! I’m doing this because I love you! Or did you think that after everything we’ve been through, I’d just leave you to face all of this alone?”
“Please, focus on Draco first!” Saulus shouted for the first time. “Harry, you can take Nathan if you want, although I warn you, it’s not safe for him out there.”
When I finally woke up, I felt as if I had been in a Quidditch accident. My whole body hurt. I felt pain in muscles I didn’t even know existed. Moving was agony, but opening my eyes was easy. I blinked a few times. The sun was trying to make its way through a curtain gap. I looked at the clock at the bedside table. It was half past eight. As expected, Harry was not in bed anymore, or anywhere in the room. He was probably far away from the Mansion as well. I put a hand where his body had laid all night. It was dead cold. He had probably escaped the moment I had fallen asleep. It wasn’t unexpected but it hurt all the same.
"Yes." Another deep and endless kiss. "We have to tell Hermione and Ron. But only after you rest a little, Drake. It was the doctor’s order. I should keep you in bed until you’re fully recovered."
Draco rolled his eyes. “I know, Harry. I’m not stupid. Where would I go anyway with Hope in my arms?”
The gentle way he laid me down in bed moved me. His eyes, on the other hand, were still harsh and almost made me flinch.
“I belong to no one!” exclaimed the teenager, pointing his wand at Travers. He tried to hit Travers, but he was a beginner and all he managed to do was make a big hole in the wall in front of us.
“You know what I mean, Harry. We used to hate each other, but now look at us. I love you and you love me. All that hate was just a defence against our mutual attraction. Perhaps that was what happened to them. Perhaps they hated each other, but it wasn’t really hate. It was love in disguise. But they didn’t have time to work on their feelings properly.”
“I don’t know. Maybe it’s someone that wants your relationship to end. Someone that is jealous of you or him, or maybe both.”
“This is not about trust!” it was Harry’s time to cut him off. “This is about your safety! Jesus, Draco! Just get over this ‘Harry doesn’t fucking trust me’ shit. I do trust you! That’s why I want you to be with Nathan! If I’m not there to protect him, if I don’t make it, then you will be there for him!”
Draco made a face. “Of course I won’t bite her. But I’ll bite you for sure when I get out of this hospital bed!” Draco said suggestively, looking the picture of health with his flushed cheeks and naughtily sparkling eyes.
“That was what I told him. He also warned me to stay away from Lucius. He thinks Lucius is going to steal our child.”
It was such a useless bluff. I would tell him anyway. Harry had no way of knowing that, though. As he stared at me with fierce eyes, I tried to remain pokerfaced.
At that moment Draco reminded him so much of the boy he had been at Hogwarts. His defensive and cold pose and his silver-blue eyes darker than usual were making Harry terribly aroused. His mind drifted away to the last detention they had had together and Draco had looked just like that. They had wrestled on the floor of the Potions’ classroom, unconsciously rubbing their bodies against each other, their faces coming closer at every second, so close Harry had felt his unsteady breath caressing his lips. He had trembled all over that day, and Draco had looked at him with such intensity that he now wondered what would have happened if Snape hadn’t appeared all of a sudden and spoiled the moment.
“I was in the yard with Brutus, thinking about some... stuff... when I felt dizzy and everything went black in front of me,” Draco explained.
"Yeah, but I don't think it will fit. I mean, look at it! It's too big. I think you exaggerated when you cast the Engorgio spell," Draco sounded dubious.
Harry sighed, deciding not to discuss the matter with him. He didn’t want to make Draco even more upset.
“I understand why you’re so stressed right now, Harry. But just remember that Hermione is pregnant with my child. I’ll be a father, too. Remember that.”
Draco closed his eyes. It wasn't enough but at least Harry wasn't insinuating that he was a liar anymore. Still, he told Harry that he could stay but he couldn't touch him. If he did, he would kick him out. Harry dared to laugh and Draco pulled all of the covers to himself.
Hermione constantly tried to make him eat but to no avail. She had stunned him with a spell once just to make him rest a little, but Harry had woken up worse and really mad at her. The only one Harry listened to was Nathan, and that was precisely why Harry didn’t want his son near him.
“These feelings probably have something to do with the fact that he’s a Mage, Harry. You know what a Mage is, right?”
Harry stopped inches behind me. We stared at each other through the mirror, lively green eyes against faded grey.  I bit my lower lip. Harry opened his partially. If I turned suddenly and kissed him, what would he do? I could be finished but I wasn’t dead. My desire for Harry was stronger than anything else, even my weaknesses.
Harry closed the tap, dried his hands and turned to face Draco. He didn’t know how Draco would react to what he was about to say, but he had to take that out of his chest as well. His boyfriend, he noticed, was starting to feel impatient as he stared at him without speaking.
“You’re also blaming yourself for this mess, Draco, just like Harry. You two need to stop thinking that you’re the only one who can mess with things. The world doesn’t revolve around you and Harry.”
“Hypocritical?” Harry’s voice was angered, but his eyes seemed serene. I got as close as I could. His scent now overtook my whole being.
Twenty minutes later after having talked all about their trip to New Zealand Hermione revealed that she was three months pregnant.
Matthew MacNair? I didn’t remember him. I did remember Walden MacNair very well, however. He was still locked up in Azkaban not only for being a Death Eater but also for killing Broderick Bode.
“He did use some very dirty tricks,” Draco said in a whisper, his eyes filling up with tears again. “But that’s not why I’m crying. I’m pregnant. I’m afraid for my baby.”
Seamus smiled. He couldn’t hold on to the tears anymore. “Of course I accept you, stupid. I was afraid that you wouldn’t accept me.”
Draco shook his head. “I probably know him better than you do, so I think I have the right to know if you’re hurting him the way you always do!”
Without thinking about what I was doing or even the consequences of such an irresponsible act, I pulled him closer and kissed him. It was not a romantic scene, and our kiss was far from delicate. It was rude, clumsy, mad. I wanted to taste more than just his lips. I wanted to prove to him that I wasn’t there because of the glory, or the damn book. I was there for him. Though the moment seemed to last a lifetime, it actually didn’t last more than a few seconds.
Ron hid a smile. Not that what she had said to Harry had been a lie, but the Hermione he knew would never act rationally if she caught him with another woman.
Hermione glanced at him, not so sure that it was a good idea. Draco would do something stupid, she knew it. It was written all over his face. The moment she left him alone, he would try to contact people who shouldn’t be contacted. And then Harry would be very mad.
And after that Severus had jumped out of his chair and began to work frantically. Many odd ingredients were taken out of his shelves, chopped into tiny little pieces and added to a steamy cauldron. Draco just watched the whole frenzy torn between fright and just plain curiosity.
But Draco came first. Draco was the most important person in his life after his son. Draco had given him a reason to exist when Harry thought he was broken. Draco was the love of his life, the man he had chosen to be his forever. Harry would never give up on him. He’d rescue Draco even if he had to go to hell to do so.
After a “tour” around the Hospital, Nathan realised two things. One, that he didn’t like it. There were too many lost souls walking through the walls and complaining about their past lives. Two, that the living people lying on the beds were as sad as the souls he saw wandering around. The weird part of it all was that none of the adults seemed to see those poor souls. His father had said to him once that there were ghosts among the wizards and that everyone could see them, but neither his father nor anyone else at the Hospital seemed to see the ghosts that he was seeing.
“Yes.” Harry looked lost in his thoughts. “And for a moment that day, Nathan was Toledo. I don’t know what happened, but they seemed to have known each other for a long time. I was so stunned I couldn’t say anything. I also felt that there was something between Nostrums and Toledo. But before I could understand their history, I was sent back to help you. I wanted to know what happened after I left, I really did. But it isn’t as if I can ask Nathan. He doesn’t even remember anything.”
It should have sounded like a request, but it ended up like an order. I sat on the bed and sighed. Although I wanted to fight, the truth was that I had no strength. Harry had me whatever way he wanted to. I was his. I would do anything he asked me to at that point. Wasn’t I already risking my life for him? I was risking my father’s fury too, my mother’s disappointment, and even my son’s own contempt.
Perhaps Seamus had gotten tired of trying to win Dean’s heart back. Perhaps Seamus had just taken some time to be alone and had told Draco about it. Seamus was used to telling Draco everything, and for the first time in his life, Dean was grateful for that.
“Draco...” Harry wasn’t ready to let him go, and he cut Draco’s way to prevent him from stepping out of the room. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry about the way I’ve treated you last night, and I’m sorry for not letting you explain yourself. But the situation seemed pretty obvious at the time.”
“I’m not the devil, but thanks for the compliment. Does it really seem so strange that I want to be informed of what’s going on?”
Harry stared at Saulus, and he remembered Nathan’s words about him. If Nathan trusted him, Harry shouldn’t suspect Saulus. After all, Saulus was actually being nice. With a sigh, Harry said, “Draco went after Seamus Finnegan. Seamus has been missing for a week, and we think the Death Eaters have something to do with it.”
“I was feeling rather shy that day, sweetie, not to mention that my entire family was staring at me the whole time. But I love you, you know that,” he said, kissing her tenderly. That seemed enough for her. “Besides, George kept doing funny faces the whole time to make me laugh. Look! He’s doing it again! The prick! I have to stop him! Excuse me, honey. I’ll be right back.”
In fact, Draco was recovering rather quickly. After three days, his body had almost come back to normal. His cheeks were slightly pink, his lips were swollen and his hair was once again silken and soft to touch. Draco looked extremely attractive. The numbers of different nurses coming into the room had increased. Half of them seemed eager to help Draco bathe. The other half was delighted to know such a tender father, who had carried the baby himself. And all of them sighed in adoration when they entered the room. There were about a dozen of them. Harry was surprised to see so many nurses taking care of one man. That fact made Harry very moody. He couldn’t wait to take Draco home.
‘No one expects me to do it,’ I said. ‘All I did in the past was try to achieve power and glory at any price for a stupid ideal, and I ended up pretending that nothing was happening just to escape the gruesome reality of what was really going on. I was always a coward, I know that. I had no idea that the price to pay would be so big. But now… now it’s my chance to redeem myself, to prove to myself that I’m better than that because I have the power to save two innocent children from a terrible fate! And I want to be here for you! I want to help you! It is also for you.’
It was the joke of the century, but as Harry analysed Lucius’ countenance, he realised Lucius was telling the truth.
Harry sighed. “I know. I was thinking that tomorrow we could go to Greece and spent those two days before the big bust with Nathan. What do you think? We can rest a little.”
“A few ex-Death Eaters have come here quite often,” Jonas began seriously. “Someone called them and told them the new Dark Lord would soon arrive and their reign of terror would soon rise again. Last week I heard one of them saying that their leader had commanded them to kidnap traitors. One of those traitors was Seamus. I don’t know where he is, Draco, but I know someone that might.”
Another problem between them was their past of hostility. Due to that, they had nasty fights and arguments every now and then. But eventually they talked it over and decided to leave it all behind. The past was the past. All that mattered from that moment on was their future together. After all, Draco wasn’t a Death Eater anymore. In fact, he was never one for real.
"Maybe? Come on, Draco. You’re smarter than that. You know your father won’t rest until he ruins us both. He’ll do it slowly and quietly so no one will ever suspect him. And then, when you and I are weak, he’ll finish us off. Very discreetly. That’s his plan."
Later on, when there was no one but Harry, Nathan and Draco at the house – and Brutus in Nathan’s room – Harry went to talk to Nathan. The moment Harry entered his son’s room, Nathan hugged him tightly.
According to the Dursleys, he wasn’t a normal kid. He didn’t know why he wasn’t normal, but he did know that sometimes strange things happened when he was feeling sad or scared. Usually, the glass of the window exploded or Aunt Marge – Vernon’s horrible sister – mysteriously started floating like a big colourful balloon in the living room. He would never forget that scene. It had been hilarious, even though the Dursleys would disagree with him fervently.
As fast as he had appeared, he left. When the fire died out, I sat on the nearest armchair trying to control my erratic breathing.
Griphook didn't say anything. He just looked at Draco with a weird expression, picked up the key Harry was holding and made a gesture for them to follow him.
I put the newspaper aside when I got to the sports page. The first column was Ginny Weasley’s. She was good, I had to admit. But I couldn’t stand her. She was so perfect it made me nauseated.
Harry’s pyjama pants were thrown to the floor and he felt Draco’s cold tongue licking his penis like it was a lollipop. Harry chuckled at the thought. The pleasure grew stronger as Draco’s rosy mouth engulfed his prick and gave it a serious of strokes. He wasn’t tired anymore, quite the contrary. He was very much awake at this point.
I could guess exactly what his thoughts had been about Astoria. Everyone thought she was a female version of me. They couldn’t be more wrong.
Angel went ahead of us being guarded by the dogs as a precious treasure. Alfred glanced at him and then back at me.
‘You had sex with me and then just… left me in the dark. You said you were staying at the Manor until I got better, but you didn’t. You’ve disappointed Alfred! Merlin only knows if you didn’t seduce me just to get information out of me.’
“But you’re my angel,” Harry said, blushing. “Even though now you’re not exactly my son but a man who lived centuries ago... Well, er... But you are my son, right? I mean...”
“You are an Angel, then,” Harry said with a softened expression. He remembered Neville’s words about Nathan very well. Neville had said to him that Nathan could soothe people’s hearts. He had a great gift, and Harry was very fortunate to be Nathan’s father.
“Who told you?” He asked, curious, and then he stared at Draco with suspicion. “Draco... do you have something to do with this?”
"Oh, God. Harry is going to kill me." Ron breathed hard. "He told me to make sure that you wouldn’t do anything stupid."
I fiddle with the bag of money making the coins clink. Burke wetted his dry lips with his tongue. I recoiled.
“Because your smirk is just your way to hide from your real emotions. Don’t do that. You can also trust me, you know? Trusting works both ways.” Harry stroked Draco’s face and brushed their lips together. “You were right about Bob. He thinks he’s in love with me.”
“I don’t know, for quite some time now... Not that I care or anything. But I worry about Angel.” He looked at his brother with tenderness in his eyes, but also apprehension.
“How about now? Are you feeling stronger?” he asked me still lying on the floor, his green eyes beaming.
Draco shook his head not quite believing at what had just happened and he searched for Nathan, who was lying on the floor.
Harry sighed. He didn’t want to wait. He wanted to go home immediately so he would stop Draco from going after Seamus alone like Harry knew he’d do.
“I was investigating some smuggled cauldrons – not my favourite thing – and I accidentally fell into the middle of a Death Eater’s gathering… And to my surprise, Harry was making this odd speech about how terror would rise again. I was really shocked. Harry was my idol. I worshipped him.”
He came even closer. Was he trying to distract me with his scent? I wouldn’t be that easily deceived. I wasn’t that vulnerable to his charms, at least not when my son’s life was at stake. Breathing, however, did become a little bit complicated.
They stayed quiet for a moment, staring at each other with distrust. Hermione appeared behind Draco and let out a shriek of happiness.
“I’m also going through a lot, Harry. In case you didn’t notice, my dead father turned out to be alive all of a sudden. Then he tells me this science fiction story about Nathan, who I care for deeply, and even though we haven’t spent much time together yet, I care for as a son.”
"The painting was too big so I had to minimize it to bring it on the plan. Draco hadn't seen it. He wasn't with me when I bought it and that was why he didn't know the actual size of it. But now everything is fine. I'll put it on the wall of my office. I like to look at it. It reminds me of..."
‘Angel trusts the Aurors guarding the Manor as well,’ I assured him. ‘I think it is safe to trust them.’
Harry kissed Nathan, assuring him and Draco that nothing would happen to him. He and Seamus followed the Weasley brothers outside.
Hermione wrote the address on a piece of paper and Harry shoved it inside the trousers’ pocket. He quickly went home to take a shower and then headed for the ice-cream parlour. The place was quite full. To his disappointment, he didn’t saw anyone with blonde hair and silver-blue eyes among the people that worked there.
Harry’s eyes flickered, thinking that he should get some sleep because he was going insane. “So… Draco’s expecting a little girl?”
“That’s not the issue here. I just don’t want to think of my son dating yet. He’s only five, Drake. He still sucks his thumb, for Merlin’s sake.”
"Shhh… Don’t cry, my love." Draco kissed his lips, wiping Harry’s tears away. "You have nothing to be sorry about. Gosh! You were way too young to deal with such a responsibility alone. Not to mention the pain. If only I had known sooner..."
I pulled my legs apart as wide as I could so he could get settled between them. My body was on fire as he rubbed against me. Our mouths collided. My fingers clawed his perfect buttocks, which made Harry kiss me even harder. His weight against my body seemed to crush me in a delicious way as if we would merge into one at any second. I knew where that would lead us and I was scared. My biggest fear in that particular moment, on the other hand, was that he would stop what he was doing. I would not bear that.
It was the first time he would leave home for more than a month. He wasn’t scared though. He had a feeling that he would have a great time in Hogwarts. Everyone told him so. Harry had great memories of the castle. Nathan loved to hear his father’s stories about it. He also felt that he would meet someone important there, but he couldn’t see past that.
Harry had heard of that before, but he couldn’t believe it. They were in another dimension created by magic. It was just like the one Hogwarts resided in to prevent muggles from seeing it. He reckoned that this was a magical dimension to prevent his friends from interfering in their fight. They were sharing the same space but at the same time, they were in different planes of existence. And the thing that shocked Harry most was that Nathan had cast that complicated spell in just a few seconds.
“Look, Harry, he confessed that he murdered the council’s members! Why would he lie about the rest?”
Draco pushed him away and Harry looked at him confused. Draco moved around him until he stood behind Harry. He pulled Harry against his body, his rigid erection pressing into his buttocks. Then he whispered close to Harry’s ear.
I didn’t really want to get rid of Harry. My heart, however, needed a break. I thought that having Harry around would be good for me. It was, in a way. But it also had its downside. He just nodded and left without saying a word. I thought it was strange, but I was in no condition to go after him. I had no strength left.
His hair remained messy and very, very dark with some specks of grey. He ran his fingers through them. I had to bite my lips to avoid a moan of desire.
“Sometimes we do things because we want them so much that the only reasonable thing to do is to surrender.”
“It’s not his fault, Harry. Be reasonable!” Sirius lectured Harry. “Ron is doing the best he can to help you. He was the one who convinced the Minister of Justice to investigate the members of the council! He tried to talk Draco into staying at his house but Draco didn’t want to. What was he supposed to do, Harry? Huh? Tell me! Draco is old enough to take care of himself. He was a Death Eater! He knows who he’s dealing with. He must know what he’s doing. He left you a note, didn’t he?”
Harry sighed. "Listen, Hogwarts is just a thought, all right? But I have the feeling that you won’t like what I’m about to say so I’ll just say it. The thing is, Draco, that I want to run off with Nathan for a while. I’m thinking about staying at our cabin with him. I think whoever is responsible for arresting me will try to take Nathan away from me again and I can’t allow that to happen. Tomorrow, Ron will go to the Minister of Justice and will present the evidence we found against three members of the council. You know what can happen. They’ll come after Nathan and me because Nathan is living proof of what they did to me in the past. See why I have to go?"
“Malfoy,” he said in the same tone, an eyebrow raised. “You look worse than when we saw each other in the Snobs Wizarding Club in London.”
“Shut up! I know more about love than you ever will! Now I’m the one that doesn’t want to see you ever again! You’re a bloody cowardly son of a bitch! And an insensitive bastard for doing this to me on my birthday. It was indeed a hell of a surprise!”
“I guess you could help us in the investigation,” Harry suggested, discarding his suspicions about him.
I knew he was close, so I moved my mouth faster. I wanted to taste his cum. He grunted and pulled me up.  I was about to complain when he pushed me on the bed, his body on mine. Harry finished undressing me with his seeker’s agility and dexterity. I was the one completely naked now, and the sight wasn’t pretty. Comparing my body to his was so pathetic that my first instinct was to cover myself.
“So your father did kill the council’s members!” Harry exclaimed. “The Department of Mysteries is right then! Lucius is the one trying to resurrect Voldemort!”
“I went to this website yesterday and I read something rather interesting called tantric sex. I read that it increases the sexual pleasure. It’s a full body orgasm. I thought we could try it. I’m not sure if we’ll succeed though. It requires a great deal of concentration and right now I just want to fuck your brains out. But I won’t. I’ll try to do everything right,” Draco said, smiling cutely.
“We wouldn’t miss it for the world!” Sirius exclaimed, catching Nathan in his arms. “You look bigger, Mister! I can hardly hold you!” Nathan beamed. “Oh! And is that your sister?” Sirius looked through the glass window and smiled. “She’s so beautiful. And she’s blonde!”
“He’s still on our wanted list, but he’s not dangerous. He was just a poor man who couldn’t get away from Voldemort’s influence. I didn’t know he was married.”
“And you bought it? I mean, honestly Draco, Harry is the most romantic and caring person I have ever met. And he’s had a thing for birthdays since his aunt and uncle never cared about his. He would never be out of town on your birthday.”
The teenager’s eyes were gleaming with anger. He was trapped, but he kept his head up. I almost laughed. That attitude was so Harry Potter.
“Only because you pity us,” he retorted distastefully. I could tell, however, that it was just a defensive mechanism.
“Well, how should I react? I doubt that if you’ve seen Ron kissing another girl you would act reasonably!”
He wanted Harry more than ever. He would make the raven-haired man his love slave and never let him go.
“Hey!” Nostrums complained. “He didn’t kick my ass! I was almost winning that fight! If it wasn’t for...” Nostrums closed his mouth abruptly.
Hermione bit her nails down to the nub and when she was done, she made them grow with the help of her wand so she could do it again. It was a nasty habit but she was too nervous to care. Ron and Harry had been gone for over an hour already and nothing had happened so far. She went looking for Sirius and Remus in the kitchen and found them making out like there was no tomorrow. She rolled her eyes and cleared her throat. It was a mystery to her how they could snog in a situation like that. They hadn’t even heard her coming in.
“Harry!” Draco exclaimed, getting up slowly and shaking Harry. “Snap out of it and just call the damn doctor!” He looked at Nathan and said, “Everything’s fine. Right? There are no complications or anything…” his voice died away when Nathan sucked his thumb. He only did that when he was scared. “Harry, give me the damn phone!” Draco snatched the phone from Harry and dialled Dr Jules’ number. “Dr Jules! It’s Draco! Yes… yes. Yes! She’s restless. I think she wants to be born. I’m feeling horrible… Eh? … Huh-huh… Hmmm… Ok. Harry and I will get there right away. No Apparating. Yeah, I knew that already… Ok. Bye.” He hung up and looked at Harry. “Harry, he’ll be waiting for us at St. Mungo’s. I’ll wait for you in the car while you get the baby’s things.”
“Don’t you see, Harry?” Colin looked like a mad man. “I lured you here so he could destroy you. I can’t live with myself anymore. Please, kill me before he gets here!”
Harry’s face got red. I suppose my face wasn’t that different. I could feel it burn in a mixture of embarrassment and desire.
Draco felt like going for his throat. “Seamus loves you, you twit! Why didn’t you at least talk to him if he was going to your shop every bloody day!?”
Nathan smiled feebly, happy to know that Draco and his father were both fine. Or maybe he was daydreaming. He didn’t know what was real anymore; after all, it was very hard to take down a magical dimension. It could be a mirage created by his exhaustion. But when his father took him in his arms, he didn’t care if it was a mirage or not. He laid his head on Harry’s shoulder as the world went black.
What I saw in Harry’s eyes, however, was not revulsion. They took all of me as his hand followed his inspection. He seemed to want to keep every piece of me imprinted on his mind. I felt tears in my eyes, but I was quick to hide them. It would be too bloody ridiculous to cry in front of him. I was no virgin.  Well, come to think of it, perhaps I was.
Harry gripped his arms around him tightly. They lay down on the bed, entwined in each other’s arms, finding comfort in the security of their embrace. They didn’t say a word but it was implicit in every touch and every kiss how much they loved and cared for each other. Draco finally understood that Harry loved him, even though he didn’t say it.
“I wouldn’t be so sure.” Draco leaned against the other side of the door. “He’s so paranoid about our safety. He asked for the best Aurors in the field to cast the most advanced magical wards around our house. He helped them, of course,” Draco smirked. “Then he installed muggle cameras and alarms… Now he’s thinking about getting another dog. Brutus is already sensing something, so he’s been restless. Not to mention that he misses Nathan, so he keeps whining every time I’m there… I tell you, I’m not so sure when we will rest. Ever.” Draco didn’t seem to mind though. His face was very serene. “But I’m glad that Nostrums is gone. I just hope we can finally have some peace without worrying about saving the wizarding world again… I want our normal problems, like Harry’s jealousy, back.”
“Scorpius is Albus’ best friend, and from what I’ve heard, they’re always together. Therefore, if anything happens to Scorpius, it might also happen to Albus.”
‘No, dammit. You are the one who drives me crazy! Because when you start talking like this, I start thinking that you care!’ I answered, irritated as hell.
“Lestrange?” Harry remembered him. He was one of the crazy guys that had been set loose from Azkaban, and he had been Voldemort’s right arm. Ron had had the privilege to lock him up again. He was dead now.
He didn’t have to ask twice. Harry embraced Draco without breaking the eye contact with him and their bodies touched from head to toe. Forehead to forehead, they stared at each other for a long period of time. Harry was feeling tremendously aroused only by looking at Draco’s deep silver-blue eyes and that was the most unique and amazing sensation of his life. Their hands entwined and they took a big breath at the same time. The movement proved to be highly erotic as their rigid hardness rubbed together. They couldn’t help but moan in delight.
“Hey, you’re forgetting something!” Alfred exclaimed. “I don’t want to talk to anybody! All I want is to get away from everything!”
Harry grunted. ‘Are you kidding me? I call her Adana because everyone here treats each other by their first names. Besides, our Squads have worked together plenty of times. We are all friends. So what? That doesn’t mean I sleep with her, for Merlin’s sake! What kind of man do you think I am? I’ve always been faithful!’
“Forget? I can’t forget! They’re still after you, Harry! You just got out today because there are people out there who like you. And as much as you hate it, Snape helped us a lot in that department.”
When Draco got home, he told Harry he would go to the ice-cream parlour to have a word with Daphne about their new schedule. Harry’s protests made him change his mind about going out. Draco sat down on the couch with Brutus by his side and frowned as Harry kept talking to him.
I took them to a smaller – though not less comfortable – room. Everybody stood still instead of sitting down. It was as if we were all expecting the other to flee or do something unexpected at any moment.
“That’s completely unnecessary. I’m serious, Potter. I just need to rest a bit and I’ll be as good as new.”
Harry contacted Bob using his cell phone, and half an hour later he found himself in front of a very old building located in the middle of nowhere. He saw Bob sitting by the porch, carefully watching him as Harry got out of his car to meet him.
Harry noticed that the silver-blue eyes were glittering suspiciously as if the blond man was crying.
The air around us became suddenly very dense. The way he said my name made my knees turn to jelly. Damn Potter. What was he trying to do to me? I felt my face heating up. He got closer again. I lost the capacity to breathe normally. His hands touched mine. Everything around us disappeared. I forgot who I was. All I really wanted was to close the distance between us for good.
She frowned. “No. There are no wizards and witches in my family. I’m the first one. I don’t know everything yet,” she said defensively. “Is Quidditch like football?”
Draco smiled and kissed him deeply. Then he took his wand beneath the pillow and said the Lubrication spell. Harry licked his lips in anticipation. Without taking his eyes off him, Draco teased Harry’s warm entrance with his long fingers and Harry bucked a little. Draco shook his hand once again in disapproval.
"I’ve heard that you have a son, so I decided to bring a few presents for my first grandson. There was this beautiful store in Paris and I just couldn’t resist. I probably bought a lot! Help me with these things, sweetheart. They’re becoming heavy."
Harry touched Nathan’s small face very carefully, afraid that he would be scared of him. The little one didn’t run away though. It was almost like he had recognised Harry. But that wasn’t possible. Or was it?
I knew Scorpius would be a brilliant student, but I was afraid of him being bullied. A bitter smile threatened to escape my lips. If that happened, it would be my fault. After all, I had been an insufferable git to many students in Hogwarts.
‘He’ll make the Malfoy name proud if he succeeds. After all, only Potter could join the team at such a young age.’ I felt the venom in every single word spoken.
They were interrupted by a very angry Dean. “If you’ll excuse us, this is private,” said Dean, shutting the door in their faces.
I couldn’t sleep that night for obvious reasons. Harry Potter was in the room next to mine. I leaned my head on the headboard of my bed wondering if he was already asleep. Harry had gone to London and then came back to the Manor bringing just a backpack. Astoria didn’t say anything. She simply smiled at him and immediately took him to one of the many rooms in the Manor, which turned out to be exactly next to mine. I smirked as I remembered Harry’s face when Astoria told him that ‘Draco would be right there in case he needed anything’.
Harry kissed Draco one more time and left. Even though Draco wanted to ask him to come back, he decided against it. He was almost positive that Harry would be even more nervous than he already was. It was better for Harry to wait outside.
Harry started to pump inside him faster until their bodies were covered in sweat. When the final moment arrived - when their bodies melted into each other – Harry let out a loud growl and he came. The blond man followed him a few seconds later, spreading his semen all over his and Harry’s belly. But they didn’t seem to mind. They sealed the love act with a tender kiss.
“He asked about you. I didn’t know what to say to him so I just told him that you would be home soon.”
But he could risk mine? I was a witness, too. I thought about complaining, but it wouldn’t do me any good. Eventually, I ended up agreeing. I knew it was useless to be opposed to the idea of Aurors hanging around the Manor. Whether I liked it or not, they would stay because the great Harry Potter had said so.
Draco waited for Harry all day, but he never came. Since Hermione told him about his plans of surprising him, he began to worry when Harry didn’t show up at his house. He started to walk back and forth in his living room, always with an eye on the clock. Finally, the anxiety took him over and he called Harry’s apartment. No one answered. Draco didn’t leave a message on his answering machine because he never liked the damn thing. He called again and again. Still no answer.
“I was wondering where he was,” he muttered to Draco as they watched Nathan sleep. “He said he had stuff to do but didn’t tell me what stuff meant. Was he with you?”
“I want you to say that you love me, that you have always loved me. I want you to kiss me and make me forget about the whole thing. Can you do that, Harry?”
"Yes." Harry flushed slightly and Draco was delighted by it. "But that wasn’t the only thing I had planned for us. I bought you something else, too."
“Can’t sleep?” Harry asked. Nathan shook his head, laying his head on Harry’s shoulder. “What do you want me to do?”
Draco was Misery itself. He hadn’t stopped crying ever since he had left Harry’s apartment. This was making him really upset with himself. He shouldn’t be feeling so helpless and lost. After all, he knew that that day would come sooner or later. Their relationship was too good to be true. But he still loved the bloody bastard even after all the things he had and hadn’t said. Draco couldn’t possibly understand what had happened to make Harry so angry with him. He should have stayed there and made Harry tell him what was wrong.
“I’ve been too moody. I lose patience easily and I tend to be unreasonable about everything. I yelled at Ron yesterday. And Draco… well, Draco is my favourite victim. I fight with him a lot. I don’t want to, but I do. And I know he’s hurt even if he doesn’t really say it.” Harry sighed. “So what can you prescribe for me?”
"I was there," Draco said in a low tone of voice as if it was difficult for him to say it. "You didn’t even look at me. It was like there was just you and Voldemort. I never saw you look at someone with such hatred. When the powers of your wands connected, there was a very big explosion. Voldemort lay on the floor with the Gryffindor sword buried in his chest and you were at the bottom of the lake. I pulled you out. You weren’t breathing, so I panicked. I gave you a mouth to mouth and you spat a lot of water. Then you looked at me, asked me if I was an angel and... And they took you away. They took you away from me. Why did they do that?" his voice cracked with emotion.
But I was a masochist and I wanted Harry near me, even if it was in such a sordid way. If that meant I hadn't changed at all, so be it.
“This is Brutus,” Draco introduced, smiling. “Brutus, this is Nathan. He’ll be living with us from now on so you better behave! No more digging in the backyard or I won’t let you enter in this house anymore! You’re lucky that Harry is not here to yell at you.”
When Eerie lay down, he slid carefully to the floor and stared at the fireplace trying to figure it out.
It was then that he realised Nathan had already said the word baby to him on two different occasions. One was just after the attack and the other in the hospital bed. Nathan knew even before he did that he was pregnant. Draco wondered how he hadn’t paid attention to it before. Then again, he would have never guessed that he was pregnant if Lucius hadn’t told him in person.
The place gave me chills. I didn’t want to be here, but I had to. I needed some information. The streets remained filthy. There was barely a soul in sight, and the few people who risked showing up were hooded and discreet. A horribly unattractive witch passed by me. Our eyes met for a second and I flinched. Merlin, I hated to be here. When I was younger, I felt powerful walking through those dim alleys with my father as if he owned the place. Truth be told, cursed artefacts had always fascinated me. I could spend hours in Borgin and Burkes exploring every evil item and dreaming of possessing a few. I had changed my mind after the war. I wouldn’t go as far as stating that I hated dark magic, but I wasn’t as interested in it as before.
Draco waited, anticipating what was coming next. They kissed briefly, and then Harry submersed a silver spoon inside the box, offering a spoonful of ice cream to Draco. Draco licked the spoon sensually, his eyes never leaving Harry’s lustful ones. Once more they kissed each other ravenously, Harry’s mouth tasting like vodka, strawberry and a little of Draco’s seeds. Draco sighed with pleasure.
A beautiful and sad song echoed around the room. Harry could only see the stranger and no one else. The world around them seemed to disappear.
“Well, you know how these things are. I think it won’t be but I’m not so sure. Besides, I have the feeling that there are more men hidden than the ones on the official want-list, and we won’t just arrest them all in a day. You know I’m their number one target. I can’t risk it.”
“Don’t be impolite,” I scolded. “I bet you haven’t had a decent meal in ages. Just eat whatever you like.”
Why wasn’t he normal? He looked normal. Maybe he had some kind of rare disease. He’d heard Uncle Vernon saying that to Aunt Petunia once. He was sick. Maybe he would die. It didn’t matter anyway.
As soon as Hannah had heard Elisabeth – the Head of the Department – talking to the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, she had sent an urgent-owl to Ron and Harry telling them about it.
“Mione, darling, Malfoy is a bastard. Period. There’s nothing left to discuss. He broke Harry’s heart, and you’re still trying to defend him! You should want to break his face!”
“All right, you devil. You win. Hermione won’t mind a little delay,” Harry groaned out pulling Draco closer and kissing him hard on the lips.
My last two years at Hogwarts had turned me into what I was today: a man full of insecurities and regrets. A man who fought constantly against sudden panic over nothing at all. The ghost of a man. I had long lost life’s small pleasures. Nineteen years later and I remained the same frightened boy that had done so many stupid things and made so many stupid mistakes in my adolescence.
Draco grinned sensually. “Tantric sex is not about physical pleasure, Harry, but a cerebral orgasm. It’s about our spirituals being so united that the energy traded between us, this energy alone should do the trick and make us experience a full body orgasm. Just with the power of our brains. We can stay in a new level of pleasure for hours if we want. But we need full concentration.”
Harry bit Draco’s neck tenderly and then tickled him. “Don’t joke around, Malfoy. For this, you should be punished.”
“Well, lucky for you then, but not everybody is as saintly as you, Boy Wonder. Most people don’t have that privilege. We all have something to be ashamed of. I have my sins. Some of them I told you already. Some of them are way too painful and hard for me to tell you. I’ll tell you someday though, and...” Draco bit his lower lip. “What am I saying? You’re the one that needs to ask for my forgiveness, not the other way around!”
“How can I not? Harry is everything to me. I know what’s going on inside his head and I don’t like it.”
It was the moment of the truth. Draco felt his body trembling all over. He knew Harry would be pissed off.
"I wouldn't be so sure." Draco closed his eyes for a moment. "I remember some of the hateful looks I received when I was at Harry's office."
“Maybe you’re right.” Once more his eyes pierced through me and I felt like I was floating somewhere else, somewhere livelier and happier.
“He wasn’t. Joe and Melissa only lived together. Partridge vanished when Angel turned two and he realised the boy could talk to snakes.”
“Hum... knowing Hagrid, he probably sent us a present full of sharp teeth. Please, tell me is not a Hippogriff and I’ll be fine,” Draco said, staring at Harry’s astonished eyes. “It’s... it’s a bloody Hippogriff?”
I didn’t have to wait for much longer. Harry showed up in my living room about twenty minutes later with Barry and the woman behind him. We stared at each other. I tried not to be impressed with his muggle outfit which only made him more charming and seductive. I tried not to drool at his dampish hair that showed signs of rebellion. Or his amazing sandalwood scent that made me weak at the knees. Or his green eyes which haunted my dreams. Nope. I was a man on a mission. I had to give him the bad news and then watch him disappear from my life again. Or I could convince him that he could count on me somehow, hence spending more time in his company. Sweet, foolish dreams.
"Besides, why wouldn’t you want to go with me? Unless Seamus has something to do with it. You two seemed very close to each other this morning. He was holding you when I entered the office."
“You’re obviously not fine! Would you stop being so stubborn?” He was stronger than me so it was easy to overpower me.
Harry wasn’t so quick to hide his approval, and, who knew, attraction. Maybe I was just dreaming. But with all those looks exchanged and talks full of double entendre, how could I not hope that maybe, just maybe, Harry was a bit interested in me?
“The fact is, Malfoy, that you’ll have to come with me to Egypt, even though the idea doesn’t please me in the least,” he went on. “Do you think you’ll be feeling better by then?”
A short blonde nurse walked towards Harry carefully, as if she was expecting him to attack her. Harry couldn’t blame her for being scared of him.
Nathan agreed happily and he led Ron to his room. Harry sighed in relief and read the paper very carefully, paying attention to every word. It was the journal’s opinion that Harry and Nathan had been terribly abused by the members of the council and that the system was clearly corrupt. Harry liked that version of the events. He also liked the fact that there was no mention of Nathan being an experiment. But he needed to decide whether he would talk about it at the hearing or not.
Harry did and he was amazed by what he saw. Draco had used his wand again, there was no other explanation to what he was seeing and smelling. Rounded green and red candles were floating all over the place. There were different colourful flowers in big vessels and a big basket of all kinds of fruits on the table. The environment smelled like sandalwood and roses, the same fragrance of Harry’s favourite incense, but Harry didn’t see any incense, which proved that Draco had used his wand to magically aromatise the air. In the bedroom, he found crystals of different colours floating above his head.
"Nope. Saulus is the real thing. He’s doing a good job so far," Lucius said not so pleasant. "He only takes drastic measures when it’s absolutely necessary, but most of the times he’s a good guy. Probably as good as your Harry Potter."
They snogged a little more, kissing each other slowly at first and then heating up. Harry felt shivers running down his spine as Draco’s hand slipped down and opened his fly. He pulled away instantly.
Harry was very stunned to witness Draco’s outburst. He wasn’t used to it. Draco was always so composed.
Draco stared at him, aghast. “Are you insane? It’s bloody ten o’clock! I’m helping Nathan with his trunk, and Hope is all alone! I can’t watch her, help Nathan and answer the door at the same time! You need to help me, Harry. You’re their father too. For Merlin’s sake, just this one time, do something!”
“Yes. Lily and I will fix things,” Nathan said in a serious tone of voice that made him look much older than he really was.
After some brief hesitation on his part, he sat next to me. I encouraged him to feel the piano keys with his little fingers, which he did almost reverently. He reminded me of Scorpius at that same age as he sat beside me and watched me play. Scorpius played as well, but he didn’t have the same passion I did for the instrument.
"How can you be so sure, Draco? You helped framed him in the past! Don’t you think he’ll come after you, too?"
Harry came back a few minutes later, and his heart melted at the vision of his lover holding Hope and Nathan. Life was finally good, he thought. There weren’t any more threats. Even though Lucius was still out there, his love for Saulus seemed to be doing wonderful things for him. And being able to play with the Ministry of Magic seemed to be enough to appease Lucius’ dreams of world domination.
I felt Angel’s little hands squeezing mine and I forgot about Harry for a second. His green eyes were looking at me with adoration but also apprehension. He was really worried. I felt guilty. How could a child who not so long ago was a complete stranger to me, gets worried about me?
Feeling that Harry was very close to the edge, he stopped and took off his own pyjama pants. Harry lay on top of him and they kissed eagerly, rocking their bodies together. Harry stroked Draco slowly at first, then faster, making him fully awake. Draco moaned at how much he wanted Harry inside. Harry felt he was going to erupt at any moment, so he patted the bedside table furiously in search for his wand. He groaned with frustration when he found nothing.
“I’m sorry, love. I’m nervous, I’m stressed and I’m stupid. What more can I say? Oh, right. I love you.” Draco threw the parchments away and sat on Harry’s lap, hugging him tightly. “I love you,” he repeated, kissing Harry. “I don’t want you to go back to prison ever again.”
It was madness. What was I even thinking? I owed her all my respect. Even if Astoria knew about Harry, I should never have kissed him. Not here. Not ever.
“Why don’t you become my Secret Keeper? I’m willing to submit myself to it in order to convince you once and for all that my intentions are good.”
Fred appeared at the corridor with a part of his face covered with black dust. Mrs Weasley almost collapsed on the floor.
He looked at me as if that was hard to believe. My lips curled in a bitter smile. “Astoria, my wife, likes to come to some of their meetings. I hadn’t been here in a while,” I began to explain and instantly berated myself for it. What did it matter anyway?
She didn’t bother to reply. Instead, she stared at Nathan with curiosity and stretched her hand towards him with a smile. “Hi! I’m Stella! Stella Stevenson.”
“I’ll give you one more chance to answer me and then, if you insist on keeping your mouth shut, I’ll have to take some drastic measures,” Harry threatened him, taking his wand out of his robe.
Saulus rose himself from the chair and walked towards Draco. "There, there, Draco. Don’t be like this. Do you want a drink? Perhaps some scotch?"
I smiled as I watch him play with Porthos and Aramis. It was good to be a kid. An invisible force squeezed my heart as I thought of Angel and Alfred living on the streets of London having for company rebel young men without any real life perspectives. I felt a bit ashamed of my own spoiled childhood.
‘If you’re really going to be our father, you should get well soon,’ he mumbled. ‘I don’t like the idea of having a useless father…’
Nathan’ eyes sparkled. Chocolate frogs were his favourite. The blond nurse came by again to call Harry and ended up confiscating all of their cigars. Sirius looked disappointed, and he tried to tell her that they were only symbolic, but the nurse didn’t seem sympathetic to him.
“I think you’re underestimating Draco, Hermione,” Sirius said. “He’s much tougher than you and Harry think and he knows how to defend himself. He used to be a Death Eater after all. He knows tricks that you’ve never heard of. I think Draco is fine and he’ll be home soon.”
“It won’t be for real, Malfoy,” he went on as he saw the look on my face. “Just so you could win it back properly. Perhaps...”
But Draco didn’t say a word. He was too busy trying to control his emotions and the feeling of happiness that was washing over him. He cleared his throat, took a deep breath and as if that wasn’t enough, he counted to ten. Nathan had called him “dad’. That wasn’t such a big deal, right?
Harry made a face. “I can’t help it. We took care of him all these years. And now he will be on his own…”
“Are you going to throw it all out of the window, Draco? Are you going to just walk out of my life that easily?”
And by unpleasant visitors I meant ex-Death Eaters who would like to see my family annihilated from the face of the earth.
The fatidic day came. Harry dressed up in a beautiful dark green velvet cloak and wore a red mask with little diamonds in it so his emerald eyes were fully accentuated. He picked up the silly card invitation that Hermione prepared - which had two angels playing harps around a big red heart and a code so his match could recognize him - and he went to the party.
“But I am?” I couldn’t hold my tongue. Being the only one to be able to help Harry in that situation went to my head.
Harry glared at Neville. He didn’t think that was cool. Actually, he was feeling quite scared and lost about everything.
“I need to tell him. And before you say anything, I really believe it’s better to stay here. You and Angel will be much safer in the Manor. And Potter will protect you.”
We started with a few basic spells, and I felt as if I was back in my first year at Hogwarts. It was difficult to be with Harry like that and not remember those days. It was also quite impossible not to be swept away by a zillion of different emotions. It all came back to me: Harry and I in the Forbidden Forest, Harry and I duelling, Harry speaking Parseltongue. All our juvenile fights. The pain in his eyes when he went after Snape to get revenge on Dumbledore’s behalf. My despair when I saw him a prisoner at Malfoy Manor. The humiliation for losing my wand. His hand holding mine and saving me from certain death.
The same Auror of before, a tall and strong man, tapped the glass door and asked me to open it. Harry was standing next to him. It took me a while to put myself together as I had not noticed Harry’s presence at all. After taking a deep breath, I walked towards them and slid the door open. Harry walked in and so did the other Auror. I hated having Aurors in the sanctity of my home. Death Eaters and Aurors only brought me bad memories.
“Listen, Harry, I know how you’re feeling, but think positive,” Neville said encouragingly. “Your son is fine now. He can go home with you today. You just need to wait a few hours. And I need to talk to you about his healing potion. He’ll still need it for at least a week. During this time, don’t let anything bother him. I know Horace wants his deposition, but really… Nathan’s only five. Until he’s completely recovered, I don’t recommend any kind of disturbance, and Horace is definitely one of them.”
Hermione made a face. “Well, you know me. Besides, I didn’t know about male pregnancy! If I had known about it sooner, I’d have suggested it to you and Harry. I decided to do some research on the matter and I’ve discovered so many interesting things!”
Who could blame him? He had been so close of finally breaking through the guilt and despair that had come from losing his son. He’d had held Nathan close to him and he had held his little hand. His son was alive and he saw him if only for a few minutes.
“I guess now we’ll all have chocolate frogs, then,” Sirius said resignedly, taking another chocolate frog from his pockets.
Now, betrayal and murder... That was such a joke! He had saved the wizarding world and this was how they repaid him.
The moment Elisabeth saw Harry Potter walking towards her office after her meeting with Roger Davies she glared at Hannah, who was looking at her own nails distractedly.
Harry’s sudden appearance took his friends by surprise. His eyes locked with Draco’s. His lover looked at him with a bright smile. Harry took a few seconds to understand what was going on, and then Draco ran to him. The man who was aiming for Draco made his move.
Harry opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out of it. He loved Draco so much but it was so hard to say it. Why couldn’t he just say it? It was just three little words. Three damn tiny little words. Then why was it so hard to say them?
Draco was astonished about Harry’s easy acceptance and happiness. While Draco was still very nervous about the whole thing, Harry looked positively fascinated. Watching Harry’s delight made Draco wish that they had planned that baby together, especially when Harry stood up and gave him a deep kiss.
“Because I told him about the surprise you were planning for his birthday. I’m sorry, Harry. But he seemed so sad, saying that he thought you didn’t love him and-”
“I have no idea. Maybe they’re trying to cover their asses. I mean, what they did to you and Nathan was a terrible thing! They should be arrested, not you! Ron took the papers that incriminate three members of the council. Those papers will be held in your defence. You’ll probably have to pay bail though for threatening Dursley and using magic against him,” Draco explained.
Draco was stunned to see them talking about trivialities – in his point of view anyway – while the wizarding world seemed to be doomed again. When they made their way into the guestroom, none of them spoke about the Death Eaters or the mission in which Harry would participate. In fact, it was like he and Harry were on vacation! Harry seemed more interested in talking about the decor of the mansion than about the latest news in the Daily Prophet.
Harry would be so mad at him, but one day he would understand. Draco couldn’t abandon Seamus after everything they had lived through together.
"This." Harry took something from his pocket and tossed it to Draco, who caught it in the air with his seeker’s reflexes. He opened his hand and stared at the golden ring that had the Snitch engraved in it, with the initials H and D and the word ‘forever’ on the inside.
And just like Nostrums predicted, Draco appeared in Harry’s eyesight. Harry’s heart filled with joy, but his expression was of pure terror when he saw a hidden man aiming for Draco, just waiting for the right moment to shoot.
Dr Jules was very optimistic about the pregnancy but had asked Draco to take things slowly during the first three months so that he wouldn’t have a miscarriage. The odds of a miscarriage were larger in a man because the whole procedure was rather complicated. A man’s body wasn’t fit to carry a baby and Draco’s body would take four months to adjust to it entirely.
“Yes, you! Aren’t you the one who can read people’s emotions? Don’t pretend you didn’t know about my feelings.”
Another explosion was heard and a curse hit Harry. Draco yelled and tried to get to where Harry was lying, but someone caught his arms.
Nathan smiled at his little sister and said, “You can’t. Not today. But one day I’ll take you with me.”
Nathan stared at him with shining green eyes that always seemed to give Harry the strength that he missed to fight. He cleared his throat and started singing slowly. Soon, the little voice of Nathan was singing along with him. In the song’s lyrics, and having Nathan in his arms, Harry found hope.
Draco glanced at what used to be a very neat and clean kitchen. There were dirty dishes dispersed everywhere, and a pan on the sink that was giving him nausea. Something was stuck at the ceiling and it looked a lot like a pancake. It looked like a tornado had passed through his kitchen. Draco didn’t know if he should yell at Harry for the mess he had made or kiss him for trying to cook for him. That was the sweetest thing Harry had ever tried to do to please him. He had taken Draco’s breakfast in bed many times before, but all those times the house-elf had prepared every food in the tray, not Harry. Never Harry. Until now. He grinned as he stared at the burned eggs and toasts.
Nathan grinned. No one had ever called him Nat. It had been always Potter this and Potter that, usually in an angry tone of voice, like he had done something wrong. Harry had said his name as he cared for him like he was loved. He liked it very much.
Nostrums sneered. “Aren’t you selfish? You think it’s all about you, you, you. I admit that you have a certain charm and that you are indeed strong, but you aren’t my main target. You never were. I made everyone believe that because it wouldn’t look good to tell my followers that my goal was to fight a five-year-old kid. They wouldn’t understand that this innocent child is my mortal enemy and that he has amazing powers.”
“Chill out! Sirius will be keeping it; we’ve already talked about it. After all, he has experience with the species, and after Buckbeak, the Hippogriff that almost ripped your arm off, a baby Hippogriff will be a walk in the park. It will be called Malfoy Junior, after you.”
“I’ve already tried. Alfred didn’t tell me much, and I don’t think Angel really realises that he’s in danger.”
“Yes, that’s correct. But don’t tell anyone about it or they will think you’re crazy. This kind of ability is a muggle thing. Wizards don’t like it as much as Muggles, Harry. The scientists that made those altered vitamins must have combined Muggle DNA with our DNA. I didn’t notice anything wrong with Nathan in this matter but… I don’t really know what to say to you, Harry. As I said, I don’t have enough experience in this area to give you a precise diagnostic. But for now, you don’t have to worry. Nathan is fine. Just be careful with your mood. He pays attention to that a lot!”
Voldemort had killed Nathan. When Harry held the inert body of his son, he swore he would take Voldemort down for good. He had even challenged Voldemort earlier than anyone expected. It was so bloody ironic. Nathan had been the reason why Harry had wanted to abandon everything, and in the end his death was the main reason why Harry had stayed and destroyed the Dark Lord. Draco didn’t know about any of those things. No one knew that Harry had almost given up the fight. Well, it was time to let him know.
Bob’s temper rose. “That hasn’t stopped you from being here every day in search of information, has it?”
Harry was struck by jealousy for a moment, but he refrained from showing it very well. He had promised himself not to lose patience again and he wouldn’t. It was a stupid reason to be jealous about anyway. Nathan wasn’t his thing but his son. And Draco was his husband so he had more than enough right to spend time with Nathan. He didn’t know why he had those stupid possessive feelings towards Nathan and Draco. He wished he could understand it.
Finally, I fell down on my knees. My magic had exhausted me. I hadn’t cast that many spells in quite some time. I closed my eyes and felt Harry’s presence next to me. I tried to push him away but I was too weak. Harry just took me in his arms. My last thought before I passed out was that dying in Harry Potter’s arms wouldn’t be so bad.
I was surprised to feel his breath so close to my neck. My body reacted immediately. It wasn't fair. That voice full of pain wasn’t fair. Sending everything to hell, I turned around and kissed him. Harry’s surprise was quick to dissipate. His arms wrapped around me and deepened the kiss. His tongue explored mine and my body was on fire. Each part of his body was connected with mine as I was pushed against the wall. I wanted him so much I couldn’t stand it.
“I’ve heard she’s been hosting some strange meetings in her house,” I said, referring to what I’d seen in her mind. I hoped I was right. I hadn’t had a lot of time to go any further into the witch’s creepy head. She might have noticed something.
Harry didn’t seem like he would listen to them, especially when Dursley told him to listen to his friends. But when he looked into Draco’s eyes, his anger faded and he place his wand inside his cloak.
These were really different times. The wizarding world loved the muggle world in the post-Voldemort Era. But I wasn’t there to analyse life around me. I was there to give my full support to Scorpius, who was holding my hand tightly. Beside me, Astoria, my wife, looked as nervous as he was.
“Elisabeth, we just want to know if Davies found something new about the Ministry attack. I promise it won’t take long.”
“Whatever! So now what? If this demon is for real, how do we fight him? Even better, why hasn’t he shown up already?”
"I know. But I can make it up to you. I'm giving myself to you as a Christmas present. Do you think I'm enough?" Harry asked.
I frowned. Not that I really cared. What I really wanted in all of that was a chance to be near Harry, as pathetic as that was. Spending some time with him in Egypt would be glorious, with or without the Book of the Dead.
They were so lost in each other that they didn’t notice a feeble golden-light irradiating from their bodies and surrounding them like a cocoon. All Draco could feel was Harry inside of him, consuming his everything, fusing them into one entity alone; one soul. The sensations were so strong he wasn’t able to hold back the loud moans that escaped from his mouth without his consent. Harry, on the other hand, could feel Draco in every pore of his body; in every inch of his skin.
We got quiet for a while. I thought he would leave, but instead, he sat next to me. His eyes kept staring at me I could feel it. I felt my face burning. What was he seeing? The brat from the past turned into a delicate and sick man? His old enemy turned to nothing? I clutched my fists. I got mad at myself for not having the courage to turn around and face him.
“No, nothing happened to him.” Hermione sat down on the couch and asked for a glass of water. While Draco went to get it, she went on, “The operation wasn’t exactly easy, but they arrested almost everyone. Ron is rather busy at the moment, but he told me to come and warn you that your absence was widely discussed and that some of the Aurors are calling you a coward and a turncoat.”
“Like I said before, Potter, it’s my house. I can scream like a Banshee if I desire to and nobody has anything to do with it!”
Nathan whispered something in Harry’s ear again. Harry flushed and Draco wondered what that was all about. And then Harry smiled; a smile that Draco loved more than anything in his life. Harry stood up, reaching out his hand for Draco to catch it. Draco wondered if he should take Harry’s hand or not, and Harry’s next line was crucial in his decision.
“Hogwarts is the safest place I know,” Harry cut across him. “Hermione and Nathan will be all right there.”
“He isn’t. Your father made a deal with an Auror not to be arrested. It had nothing to do with you.”
We loved each other in our own way. I knew she wished we were a real passionate couple, but for her, it was enough that we cared for each other. Astoria might look like a typical bourgeois witch at first with her golden hair and doll face. She came from a traditional rich wizarding family, something that had been essential for our wedding. But whoever knew her intimately would realise how sweet and tender she really was. She took care of me and she was an excellent mother.
‘I’d thank you, then, if you could speak English with Potter from now on since I don’t understand Spanish very well. Is there any hot water in this place?’
“I’m pretty sure that it was him, Hermione,” Harry said, awfully tired. “And I don’t think he has a twin, so…”
"I can’t guarantee you that I’ll always be safe, Harry. Life is so bloody unpredictable. But I promise that I’ll never leave you if I can help it. I promise I’ll always be by your side, no matter what."
“You’re getting sentimental.” Harry was about to protest when Draco cut across him, “I can see it in your eyes, Harry. You made me promise I wouldn’t make a fool of myself and cry when Nathan gets on the train. The same goes for you!” They heard Nathan chuckling.
“You’re not part of their group. I’ve turned your life upside down these last few weeks,” he informed me without any shame whatsoever. Then again, that he would investigate my life once again should not be such a surprise. I was still upset, though.
Ok, perhaps I was holding him too tightly, but what was I supposed to do? I didn’t want him to just disappear on me. Not now.
I tousled my hair and sighed out loud. I would soon begin to hyperventilate. I fell on the bed on my back and closed my eyes. I would not give in. Not tonight. I would be strong. I had to be. I would still have to face Harry again. I would have to make up a really good excuse for that kiss and for the fact that I…
The next step was to call my parents and tell them the news. After pondering about it, I decided to skip that part for the time being. I wasn’t in the mood to receive a furious Lucius in the Manor telling me I’d lost my mind for good.
"All right. I’m feeling much better." Draco crossed his arms, sat by Harry’s side and made a face. "Longbottom is not that bad, I have to admit. The potion is really good. My head is still aching a little but I guess I’ll be as good as new by morning."
“What are you talking about?” Draco asked, puzzled. “You were the one who locked me in here. Where is here anyway?”
Hope and Draco were very much alike. She had the same hair colour as the Malfoys, the same smirk, the same devastating charm. Harry had never seen a child smirk before, but Hope was already very good at it. She was also very good at manipulating Harry whenever she did something wrong. But she could never fool Draco because he knew exactly how her mind worked. For a six-year-old child, she was way too manipulative, even more than Draco used to be. Lucius adored her.
When the song was over, Harry held Nathan tightly. He felt small hands on his face and he realised he was crying.
He entered the bedroom trying to keep the noise down but Draco was still awake. Draco lit up the lampshade and stared at him with an expression that Harry could not read. Just in case, Harry decided to act casual.
I closed my eyes. Imagining Harry in bed was driving me insane. How long didn’t I feel the touch of another human being? Sadly, it’s been years. I didn’t miss sex. Not really. But if Harry was my partner, would it be different?
“So did I.” Harry kissed Draco more passionately and then embraced him tightly. “I can’t believe you’re really here. I was really scared of losing you. I don’t know what I’d have done if I’d lost you. I’m so lucky to have you... You tell me you’ll understand if I spend the night in Nathan’s room when you have no idea how much I want to spend the night with you. It was you who were captive of that monster. I was so afraid that he would hurt you. And then you tell me that you understand… If only the old you could see you now…” Harry buried his face in Draco’s silken hair and breathed in his sandalwood scent.
“Oh, my God. I’m going to be a father. Again. We’re having a baby! I can’t believe it!” Harry beamed and his smile lit up the entire room. “Are you sure? I mean, how did you know?”
“Then what do you want me to do?” Harry touched Draco’s back slightly, sending shivers down his spine. “Tell me and I’ll do it. Anything. You just have to ask. You know that I’m crazy about you.” Harry’s fingertip touched his neck. “Just say it, Draco. Just say what you crave for and I’ll do it. I’d anything for you.”
“Ron, honey, let’s get something straight. If I ever catch you with another woman, I’ll kill you and the bitch.”
“He did when he was a...” Fred looked at Jonas with mistrust, but Draco told him to go on because Jonas was on their side. “Well, I suppose it doesn’t matter now. Everyone is talking about it... When Lee was a spy for the Order, he used to come here quite a lot to gather information.”
It had been a week since Dean had last seen Seamus and he was very concerned about him. It just wasn’t like Seam to vanish like that. Dean was used to being bothered by Seamus at least two hours a day when he’d come to talk to Dean in his shop, hassle his clients and seduce him.
Astoria and I shared a rather meaningful look. Honestly, I couldn’t understand what was going through her head.
Alfred didn’t say anything. I knew he would need time to make his decision. We would have to prove to him that we honestly cared about them because just a few days ago we’d been nothing more than strangers.
Draco shook his head. His silver-blue eyes were watery. Harry was about to panic but still kept himself together.
I heard Harry’s husky voice whisper something as his fingers poked my entrance, thrusting cold wet-like fingers inside. I shivered from the suddenness of it and the pain that soon passed as he muttered something else. He was wearing a condom. How practical of him. I smiled, but my grin faded as his cock breached my hole. It was like being ripped apart. I grunted loudly. My heart went mad in my chest. My whole body trembled. Harry held me tightly and kissed me so tenderly that I moaned, but this time more from pleasure than pain. As he began to move, carefully at first and then fast, I felt my whole self being pulled towards him.
“I’m sorry, Potter, but this is my house and the boy is my guest. Since I’m the adult responsible for his well-being right now, I’d rather stay.”
“I know that some of the boys don’t want to be pawns. And they don’t want to hurt anybody. A muggle boy died, did you know that?”
“Harry is worried?” Draco frowned. “Why? I left him a note. And he wasn’t even supposed to be here.”
“Of life...” And of Harry Potter. “I was raised to boss people around, not trust them. Potter was the first to challenge me, the first to question the world I lived in.”
Elisabeth made a gesture with her hands. “Oh, you know how the Unspeakables are. They say nothing but the necessary. It’s just me but I think they have nothing, just speculations.”
Nathan looked at his sister, who was sleeping quietly in Draco’s arms after being fed, and said, “I like it.”
Harry could see hatred in Colin’s eyes and he pitied him. Although Colin hated Nostrums, he was in love with the demon. Harry wondered if Colin would protect Nostrums, even out of his control. He should be living in hell.
His eyes came across a pair of cold green eyes. He felt like he was pointing his wand at a mirror. In front of him was a man who looked exactly like him. Even the clothes were the same. It felt strange to stare at that man. He felt like he was in another reality, an alternate universe. He felt repulsed but also fascinated. He knew now what Colin had felt, and he wondered if Draco had felt the same way.
"But you need protection of some kind! The magical barriers take a few weeks to be done so they’re out of the question for now. And face it, Draco; you haven’t used your wand properly in a long time. You need a bodyguard then!"
Alfred gave his back to Harry and me. I looked at Harry and noticed he was watching me and not Alfred. Why? Was he still suspecting me?
“Yes, but not all of them,” Horace pointed out. “We still don’t know who’s behind the return of the Death Eaters.”
“Well, I guess Dr Longbottom won’t mind your presence!” she said with a smile. “I mean, who would be angry with such a cute little boy around?”
No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I had wondered many times before if my problem wasn’t linked to Harry Potter. I had discussed it endlessly with my psychiatrist. We believed it had everything to do with him. But if I said it aloud, would it change anything? I was happy that Harry was showing such concern for my well-being, which made me consider telling him what I really thought. My heart was full of hope. It was pathetic, but it couldn’t be helped. And yet, I couldn’t say anything.
Barry left the room, but not before sending me the evil eye. Harry and I were left alone with only the house-elves as witnesses. I felt my breath being taken away.
When the light was gone and people were still trying to understand what had happened, Lucius smiled victoriously.
Brutus whined a little more and then barked. Nathan didn’t seem scared by him. Child and dog looked absolutely in love with each other, but Brutus was way too dirty for Nathan to play with him. In spite of Brutus protests, Draco led him to the backyard again.
“You see, Harry,” Saulus said more softly. “Nathan was a Mage, so he wouldn’t be a warrior. He’d be too good for that. Since we didn’t know how to fight the demon, and your son was quoted in the prophecy, it was decided that he should be the one to destroy Nostrums, even though at the time we didn’t really know it was a demon we’d have to fight against. A team of experts was gathered and they worked on Cho Chang without her knowledge. It was a risky business, but we had to try. In the end, everything worked out all right.”
Later that same day, after three hours of lectures about his immoral behaviour, Harry got out of the office with Ron. They talked a little, mostly about Draco, and Harry decided to go to a place he hadn’t visited in a long time because it brought back too many painful memories.
“Fred went to talk to the guards. If someone is out there, he’ll find them. Maybe you should stay here, Draco. Just for the time being. God only knows what might happen if you go out there,” Ginny said.
Draco stopped struggling and opened his eyes widely, his silver-blue eyes cloudy and scared. He looked at Harry as if he wasn’t really seeing him and muttered something.
“Don’t be childish, Harry.” Draco pulled him closer and touched their lips together. “Don’t you know how much I love you already?”
“Why?” Harry asked. “And please don’t give me the bullshit answer.” Harry turned to Lucius. “You never cared for Draco, and suddenly you manage to convince him to trust you and get him pregnant. Why? What’s your game?”
Harry made a funny sound that indicated his frustration. He wasn’t used to doing nothing. He wanted to participate actively in every touch, lick, kiss and stroke that would lead them through the journey towards the ecstasy. Harry lost the little rational thought he had when Draco slightly ran his fingers up and down his back. He was feeling the energy, all right, especially in the lower areas. That area was getting on fire and he needed to extinguish it right away, otherwise he would die and he wasn’t joking.
Dean leaned against the doorway and silently watched Seamus’ sleep. Today seemed to be a good day. The medi-wizard taking care of Seamus had said that the sandy-haired man was sleeping a lot better now. Seamus still had nightmares, but they were decreasing. The medi-wizard seemed to think that Dean’s presence in the room calmed Seamus down, but Dean wasn’t so sure. The problem was his guilty conscience. That was why he only came to visit Seamus when Seamus was asleep. Dean was afraid to face him. Or maybe he was more afraid of facing himself and his true feelings for the beautiful Irishman.
“You’re right. I’ve been acting crazy... I should talk to Sirius. Nathan has my hero complex, right?” Harry smiled feebly. “I do believe that he’s safer in Saulus’ Mansion. I never saw so many guards and magical wards in any other place. I don’t think Nathan would escape from a place like that.”
Another thing that Nathan was learning fast was that Mrs Weasley seemed to love feeding him every five minutes. He didn’t mind though. He loved everything about that house. The best thing of all was that they were the very opposite of the Dursleys and for that, he was extremely thankful.
Once they got there, Draco closed the door and leant against it. He didn’t speak for a long time and Harry felt uneasy. Something was telling him that the conversation wouldn’t be so pleasant.
I was mortified at my slip of the tongue. Luckily, Alfred didn’t point that out. I needed to be more careful or everybody would know I had feelings for Harry Potter.
Fearlessly, Draco walked towards the bartender, who was still the same one as in Voldemort’s Era. His name was Jonas, and no one knew his last name. He’d been a bartender in that bar for a long time and used to hear and see odd things of the wizarding world. His bar didn’t exactly have a good reputation in the wizarding community. But even though Jonas was a very reserved man, he was fond of Draco. In the past, Jonas had helped Draco a lot. It was time to use him again.
“That was so long ago!” Draco exclaimed, embarrassed. Harry chuckled. “I was a brat back then. I’m an honest man now. I’ll be a mother, I mean, a father pretty soon! Can’t you just forgive me?”
"You know, Draco, that was, what, the tenth time you’ve tried that? It’s obviously not working! Why do you keep trying?" Hermione said with an eyebrow raised. "How can you be so sure the parchment has something to show? Just face it, there’s nothing there. Face it and move on!"
I bit the inside of my cheek to prevent one of my typical Malfoy comments to spoil the mood. It was not the time. I had Harry right there beside me in bed. What more could I want apart from letting my cynical side asleep for a while? Therefore, I just nodded.
I froze. I couldn’t tell him the truth. I couldn’t tell him that I just wanted to be next to him, that knowing that he needed me gave me the strength to wake up every morning with a new purpose. He wouldn’t believe me anyway, and chances were he would send me straight to St. Mungus. I had to lie.
I would not fall apart in front of him. I had to show Harry I had gotten better, even if it wasn’t true.
Harry was losing himself into a vortex of satisfaction. Their kisses were intense and very arousing. The stranger’s lips traced a path down Harry’s earlobe, and then met his neck and his chest. A light brown nipple was licked and then slightly bitten. Harry let out a cry.
“The child of the dragon and the lion will be the downfall of Nostrums,” Lucius recited. “Again, the bloody lion. But this time the dragon was with him.” Lucius smiled in a horrible way. “I’ve always known that Draco would be part of a prophecy someday.”
“We had to make sure, Malfoy. It’s the normal step in an investigation. I guess you wouldn’t know that as you’ve never worked in your life, have you?” he provoked.
Harry smiled a little. Finally, Neville’s wand went out and he stared at his friends’ worried faces with a blank expression that soon turned into a smile.
“I know, but I can’t tell them what I know, Harry. I’m not sure anyway. I just thought I should tell you so you would come with me to investigate.”
It made perfect sense. It also showed how respected and powerful the name Harry Potter was all over. I was both impressed and envious. That he was an important figure internationally should not be a surprise, though.  He was the Great Harry Potter.
I arched my brows. Apparently, Astoria didn’t seem to care that I didn’t want her talking to Harry about me. And why the hell did we seem to be living an idyllic domestic scene?  Was I living in an alternate universe? It looked like it. A new reality where Astoria and Harry plotted against me like old friends.
“Like hell they aren’t!” Draco shouted. “You don’t do things just for the sake of it! You do it when you have a personal gain!”
Instantly, all of them turned around to stare at Nathan. The blonde guy gasped, the red-haired man let his mouth hang open and the woman let out an exclamation of surprise. But Nathan didn’t notice any of those things. He was too busy paying attention to the man that had dropped the stick on the floor and had knelt in front of him with his green eyes filled with tears.
He set his plan carefully. He ordered his house-elf, Dobby, to help him. The poor little creature went against his will, all the way thinking that Dobby liked Harry Potter and wished him no harm.
“Oh. But you do realise that even though now you’re Toledo and not Nathan, you still look like Nathan. And even if you didn’t look like Nathan, I would still protect you no matter what.”
Harry cleared his throat, knelt down in front of Nathan again and asked tenderly, “Nathan, I’m sorry if things had to go like this, and that you had to discover that I’m your… father… in such a rude way… but… well… Do you want to come with me, Nathan?”
“What else do you want to know, my dear?” Demon Harry asked softly. “I see the confusion in your beautiful eyes.”
Knockturn Alley hadn’t changed that much. Perhaps their traders had become a little standoffish, but then again they had always been like that. Respected witches and wizards were almost never seen walking around Knockturn Alley, especially during the day. For at least 5 years after the war, the Alley had been patrolled by Aurors daily. Just the most stupid and unimportant Death Eaters had been caught hanging around. The smart one had been long gone.
“Oh, no! You’re not going to throw me out. You had me, too. We’re even in that matter. But we still have a lot to talk about. There’s a lot of unfinished business between us. And when I say a lot I really mean it.”
The Malfoy Manor was indeed a sight to behold. With at least eighty rooms, those who didn’t know it well would get lost pretty easily once inside. Some peacocks were walking around in the huge trimmed lawn. The little boy beside me relaxed a little when he saw them, looking rather interested in this new scenario. My dogs came running toward us and I had to shout a command so that they would behave.
"No. Tomorrow I’ll give a bath and then maybe I’ll let you sleep in Nathan’s room. Maybe! I don’t know if it’s good for you to sleep there."
I took a small bag full of coins from my pocket and put it on the counter to cause an impact. His hands full of popped veins moved around restlessly. I think the old man hadn’t seen that much money in quite some time. I could understand why. Dark magic wasn’t so popular anymore.
“Potter, it’s late. They’re sleeping. And far from contradicting you, but do you really think they’ll be safer in the Institution?”
“You’re totally right. I don’t know what’s happening with the Ministry. Ever since that guy was elected for Minister of Magic, everything has been a mess. Arthur, my father-in-law, said that Saulus Fimcyl – the new Minister of Magic – is a crook. Nobody knows much about his past. Some say that he was only elected because he bribed the council.”
He was almost asleep when he heard someone shouting in the living room. He tried to figure out who could it be. That voice sounded so familiar to him. It was the voice of the person that used to sing the lullaby inside his head.
Carefully, he got out of the small bed and opened up the door of the cupboard. He would get into trouble for wandering around the house at that hour but he didn’t care.  He had to know who was there.
With small steps, he entered the living room quietly and stared at the five people with weird clothes surrounding a petrified Vernon Dursley. One of them had a stick pointed into his uncle’s red face. Nathan noticed that this man had the same untamed black hair that he had.
“They are connected with the Death Gang, running the show behind the curtains. Are you satisfied now?” he answered much to his dislike.
“That’s because I started in the darkness, Harry. I grew up in it. I know what’s like, and I know how it feels. It took me a long time to make peace with myself. Ask Seamus, he knows this. I was a real bastard to him a lot of times. You, on the other hand, started your life believing in the good side, and along the way, you realised it wasn’t as perfect as you thought. So you got pissed. You still are. There’s nothing wrong with it.”
Bob had touched a sensitive spot. Draco's past still disturbed him and every now and then he wondered if he was right for the noble Harry Potter. Draco had been a Death Eater. He had done nasty things and he had seen what hell was all about. He had buried all of these memories for a while, but Bob had brought them back to the surface and he didn't know what to do with the pain and insecurity he was feeling inside. He wasn't good for Harry and Bob was right.
“A teddy bear?” Harry frowned. “Is it a teddy bear that comes to life all of a sudden and attacks its owner?”
Harry stared at me intensely. I wondered if he had mastered Legilimency and was now trying it to penetrate my mind. If that was the case, I would try to keep him out even if it killed me. However, I didn’t feel any intrusion on his part. I bet he would like to try it, though.
Harry rolled his eyes, but he was concerned about the fact that Nathan wasn’t going to any school yet. Draco told him that it was common in the wizarding world to hire a private tutor. Draco had had one until he had gone to Hogwarts. Harry should consider his options more seriously instead of hiding Nathan from the world.
"I’m fine, Draco. Don’t make a face. You’re frowning and that’s not a good thing. It gives you wrinkles and then you get older sooner than you’re supposed to! Don’t frown and keep your youth intact for a long time."
Draco made a face. “You need to tell Ron that he can’t give my address just to anyone, Hermione. What if our fellow here is an enemy?”
Harry was very confused about Bob though. He’d assured Draco that Bob wanted nothing to do with him and yet he had been terribly wrong. If Bob was such a great actor, who knew if he was telling him the truth at that moment?
When Saulus hung up the phone, Harry said, “I have to go. I need to look for Draco as well. If what you said it’s really true, then there’s no time to lose. Draco is more in danger than I would have thought!”
“WHAT? I can’t believe he even considered something like this,” Harry said, outraged. “I would never kick you out!”
We held each other like castaways. Our heartbeats took forever to calm down. Harry had his eyes shut and seemed to be in pain. I closed mine as well as kissed the tip of his head without thinking. To my utter surprise, Harry brought me closer.
It was the first time that Harry ran away from a discussion and Draco didn’t like that. Harry took Nathan in his arms and climbed the stairs to the second floor. Brutus tried to go after him but Draco forbade him.
When they’d finally got together after some time apart, Dean had pressured Seamus to tell him the truth about his days as a spy for The Order, innocently imagining that it would be just like hearing a romantic epic or a James Bond’s story. He’d been so wrong. There was nothing remotely romantic in Seam’s story. It was all sordid and sick.
“I don’t know. He only wants to talk to you. I don’t trust him anymore, Harry, and that was why I didn’t tell you this before. Bob isn’t the same jovial guy as he used to be. He seems so different... I can’t believe no one noticed this but me.”
“No. I just copied his looks. You’re much more perfect, but…” Harry shrugged. “It doesn’t matter now. I can have you when I kill the real Harry Potter.” Harry stroked Draco’s face, lusting after him with his eyes. “Soon he’ll be here in order to save you. He’ll bring little Nathan with him, of course, because Nathan is my main goal. I need them both to survive. Nathan’s strength is extraordinary. If only your father hadn’t gotten in my way… I’ll deal with Lucius when the time comes. When I suck up Harry’s and Nathan’s energy, I’ll be invincible. No one will be able to stop me. And insects like Lucius Malfoy will be crushed.”
I found one of the Aurors in the back patio. He was a pudgy man whose name was Barry. I told him I needed to see Harry urgently. I got to give it to Barry. He did try to hide his scorn as he told me Harry was probably too busy at the moment to talk to me, and that I should wait until the next day.
“But...” Nathan seemed to be really shocked. “I didn’t know. I just felt that you wanted to be loved.”
I was definitely going insane. As soon as I arrived at the Manor, all my bravery seemed to vanish. I just held myself together because there was somebody holding me who was a lot more scared than I.
‘In your dreams, Potter. But just so you know,’ I stopped as I suddenly realised Grey was still next to me and looked very interested in what I was saying.
After an hour, Draco went back home. He entered the house on tiptoes. Harry was sleeping on the couch, and Draco would bet anything he had that Harry had fallen asleep waiting for him to come back. He knelt beside Harry and caressed his face tenderly. He kissed Harry’s lips softly but his husband didn’t wake up.
No, he wasn’t sure at all. He was having a weird feeling about that key, like the vault was guarding something that would bring him a lot of pain but also relief. He didn’t know why he was feeling that way, but he didn’t want to worry Draco about that. Not on their wedding day.
Brutus barked in response and Draco rolled his eyes. Then he kissed Nathan’s forehead and Harry’s lips. Nathan, who had never seen them kissing each other before, opened his eyes wide. Draco, realising what he had done, blushed so much that his face looked like a ripened tomato. Harry smiled at the sweet sight.
“No, Draco! Aren’t you listening at all?” Lucius made a disagreeable face. “I said I took care of my enemies, not that I attacked the bloody place! I had nothing to do with those Death Eaters. And don’t you dare give me a lecture? Those men were scum and they deserved to die.”
He felt Harry sneaking under the blankets and moving closer to his body. Draco suppressed a smile. Harry was so bloody predictable sometimes. But he wouldn't surrender to him that easily. He would fight until the end to prevent Harry from touching him that night.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Cho had died because of that nonsense. Harry couldn’t believe the prophecy was about him and Nathan. It was way too crazy. He was very sick of it all. It was quite disturbing the way Saulus looked at him. Saulus was so calm that it was creepy.
He walked carefully to where Draco was sitting and when their eyes crossed he smiled in his cute little way.
“Well, it’s just that... Don’t get me wrong, please, but... what I felt when I was inside you was so amazing. It was like the pleasure was ten times stronger than usual. Like we were under some sort of magic. Did you do anything?”
“You’re such a liar, Harry!” Draco exclaimed. “You told me I would be the only one crying. Now, look at you.”
Harry’s voice was seductive. I would have followed him to the depths of hell if he wanted. Of course, Alfred wasn’t in love with Harry Potter like I was. The boy hated him. Harry represented the family he had lost. It was unfair and stupid. It was the Death Eaters’ fault. It was Voldemort’s fault. It would be more rational if Alfred held a grudge against me, not Harry.
“Why, Mr Potter. Is that a wand in your pocket or is your body happy to touch me after such a long time?” Draco teased, making Harry redden even more. Draco kissed him on the cheek and whispered, “I miss you, too.”
“No.” I sat on the armchair as if afraid that my body wouldn’t take its weight any longer. “I didn’t mean to. It just happened. I couldn’t leave them there. I don’t know what Goyle and the others are planning, but I don’t like the idea that they don’t mind attacking children as they see fit.”
I decided to take my chances. To hell with everything else. My lips parted and I made my move. I brushed them softly against Harry’s lips, and it was enough to make him stand up quickly as if an Unforgivable Curse had hit him.
“I just want to have a drink,” Draco answered. “And I was wondering if you still have those... items that you used to sell a few years ago.”
It was quite clear to me that that night would be the longest of my life. I’m not sure why I didn’t just take a Sleeping Draught. I was too troubled. I kept walking round in my room reliving the kiss I’d forced upon Harry. It was pure agony. I wonder what he was thinking, and if he had left the Manor. I didn’t have the heart to check. Perhaps I could send a house-elf to spy on him. The cruel truth, however, was that I was afraid to know.
“Oh, yes, some business you and your brother have,” Mrs Weasley bewailed. “Creating those silly and dangerous jokes and games that I tried so much to put a stop to... That is not what I call being responsible. Percy is responsible, Bill is responsible...”
“This isn’t a joke, Malfoy. Your wife told me your Healer has forbidden you to cast heavy spells! Don’t you know you might drain yourself in such a way that you may never recover? You can lose your magical powers!”
Draco shook his head. "Harry would never do it and neither would I. I’m extremely possessive and I’d kill you before you could put your hands on him." Draco wasn’t joking.
After all, Draco Malfoy had a plan that Christmas. He would ruin everyone's celebration by stealing away their most important possession, the reason why they now sang and danced and hoped for better days in the future. He would steal away Harry Potter and ruin Christmas for them all.
Harry shook his head in disbelief. “I suggest you two get your heads examined.” And then his eyes flew open. “Oh, no. Don’t tell me, please. Just don’t tell me you messed with destiny again!”
How could Harry ask Nathan without disturbing him? Nathan was too young to be caught in that situation. Still, Nathan could be the only one able to help them find Draco. Harry didn’t have to ask, though, for Nathan answered straight away that he didn’t know where Draco was.
The coffee I was pouring got spilt all over the table. Astoria was quick to call a house-elf to clean up the mess. When the little creature finally left us, I looked at my wife as if I was seeing her for the first time.
‘It means nothing. I’m still good to go,’ I muttered without any confidence whatsoever. I felt like slapping myself hard on the face.
The hatred in his eyes was the worst part of it. Thank God Hermione and Ron had been with Draco and Harry. Draco didn’t know what Harry would have done to the Ministry’s council if his friends and lover hadn’t been there to keep him calm.
“Yes, I was about to leave anyway,” Harry said. He was back to his old self. I envied his ability to quickly dismiss his embarrassment. “Malfoy,” he called my name looking straight at me. “Forget about everything.”
Draco shivered a little as he remembered how Nostrums had tried to seduce him by using Harry’s image.
Another reason not to call Harry was that I had never been a perfect citizen. Although I behaved myself, I had committed some small offences over the years. It wasn’t anything serious, really, but the Ministry never let anything go by these days. Like when I unsuccessfully tried to import a dragon’s cub from Romania for Scorpius’ sixth birthday party.
The Book of the Dead was an Egyptian artefact desired by all of those who appreciated magic or simply history. It was said that the book was written more than 3,000 years ago by a very powerful wizard of its time. The book had potions and incantations. It was supposed to be some sort of spiritual guide to life after death. However, some said it went beyond it. It was also a very dark magic book. It could bring back the dead provided you had an appropriate recipient – a body with a soul. It was not a book for the faint-hearted. It was as much of a taboo as the Unforgivable Curses. In the past, however, it hadn’t been. It wasn’t an evil book per se, or at least it hadn’t been designed to be so at first. There were far too many things in it that went beyond our knowledge. It went beyond pure and simple dark magic.
I turned to face him. His green eyes were shining brighter than usual like something had touched him deeply. My music, perhaps? I wouldn’t dare think of something like that. But then again, I could hope, couldn’t I?
“Honestly,” he said staring at his feet. “I don’t know. One thing is for certain, though. This is not the time to talk about this. Even though I won’t deny what came to pass because I’m not a hypocrite, I just can’t deal with it right now. It’s too... insane.”
Ron never had the opportunity to finish what he was going to say because in that moment Draco burst into Harry’s office and pushed Seamus in without much care. A murmur spread through the other departments and some of the people among the staff stopped at Harry’s door just to see if the rumours were right and the infamous ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy was actually in there.
“Damn it, Harry! Say something! Didn’t you believe in Seamus’s story? Is that it? Are you still thinking that I’ve cheated on you? Because I haven’t! I was at the ice-cream parlour all day! You can ask Daphne if you want to! I–” Draco closed his mouth and cursed himself.
Brutus came running and jumped on Dean, who almost fell on the floor. Dean tried to cover his face thinking that Brutus would bite him but received a sloppy lick on the face. Draco chuckled while he made Brutus back away.
“Of course,” Draco said. “Seamus wanted to see you. You were being stupid. Who comes to the rescue? The beautiful blond Draco, the hero of the gay lovers of the world. And by the world, I mean only the wizarding world. I can’t be everywhere. I have a family, you know.”
His hands wrapped around my neck and pulled me forward. I thought I was about to be strangled, but I was mistaken. And from that moment on, the world stopped making any sense; or perhaps it just found its meaning. The hot mouth caught mine in a breathtaking kiss. I could do nothing but surrender. I wanted to do nothing but surrender. I let Harry pin me on the wall. His hands seemed to be all over my body, eager to explore every part of me. His tongue entangled in mine passionately. I saw stars, constellations, paradise. I fought against my panic, against that part of me that wanted to run away, against the fact that my body was turning to jelly. But who was I kidding? I wanted this. I have wanted this my whole life.
Lucius smiled viciously. "But of course. That’s how things are done, Draco. It has been like this ever since Merlin’s time. You don’t really believe in the system, do you? Honestly, if you do, I’ll be terribly disappointed with you."
"But then you’d have to leave your life here, and by life I mean Draco. He won’t go with you, Harry. His life is here."
Ron, who was about to ring the bell of Draco's - and now Harry's - house, dropped his hand and stared at Hermione with an eyebrow raised. It was like he was asking her quietly if they - Harry and Draco - were doing what he thought they were doing. His eyes pleaded for Hermione's negative.
It broke Harry’s heart to be apart from his son like that. He wanted to scream and destroy those bastards from the Ministry. But he didn’t do anything. He kissed Draco and told him to look after their son. Draco smiled, even though he was worried as hell. Harry had said ‘their son’. He couldn’t be happier. They kissed and Draco tried to keep his tears from falling. He wouldn’t cry. Not in front of those idiots from the wizard police and those suckers from the Daily Prophet.
Another day and the morning dawn looked as grey as my future. The food was as tasteless as ever making me lose my appetite completely. I barely took notice of Astoria’s worried look as she came in and out of my room. However, I listened quite well when an Auror came to let her know that Harry would not be coming back that day, and neither the next one. There were ‘complications at work’, but nothing we should be worried about. I grunted my frustration aloud.
“You didn’t do me any harm, even if you were Bob. I… I don’t understand. What’s going on? Why did you take Bob’s place?”
Harry stared at him with disgust. “How can you ask this, you piece of shit? You know what I am doing here! I’m here to take my son away from you! I couldn’t believe it when I found out that Nathan was being kept here! Fudge must have thought it was damn hilarious to give my son to you. How much did he pay you?”
I distractedly took a look at the room I was in. Not bad at all, I had to admit. It was a cosy little flat with kitchen, a little living room, bathroom and bedroom. I could sometimes hear noise outside, probably from people who lived there. It made me feel horribly alone.
"As long as you keep me company, I don’t mind at all." Draco stared at him intensely. "Harry, I love you."
“I had to make sure you weren’t involved with The Almighty! And to my utter astonishment, I do believe you are not involved with them. And I believe you actually care about those boys!”
Harry kissed Nathan’s forehead one last time before taking Draco by the hand and going to their bedroom. He closed the door, looked deeply into Draco’s eyes and then kissed him slowly until Draco felt weak in the knees. Draco kissed Harry’s neck and sucked it gently.
Harry looked straight into his eyes and repeated. “I love you. I’ve always loved you and I always will.”
“I think Draco is right, Harry,” Hermione said. “We all have good and bad days. It’s part of us. Look at me and Ron.”
Harry seemed to realise that as well because next thing I knew he went back to his stern Auror Potter mode.
Harry was thinking about Draco and what he was doing. He knew Draco wouldn’t just stay in the house and wait for news. Draco would go after someone from his past, someone who knew Seamus as well, someone dangerous. Harry couldn’t let that happen. He was about to say that he was going home when Horace put the mail down and said, “Five people are reported missing.”
Alfred, on the other hand, looked ready to run away. He would have probably tried to apparate away from here had he known how to do it. Harry noticed the tension in him and gave him a friendly smile. It was an open smile, the sort of smile you’d get from a caring father. I guess Harry’s attitude seemed to convince Alfred that standing in front of him was an ally and not an enemy because the boy relaxed a little bit.
Horace stared at Bob for a moment. There was a time when Horace trusted Bob, but his old colleague didn’t seem the same anymore. There was something different about him that Horace couldn’t quite place.
His heart almost stopped. He touched Draco’s wrist to feel his pulse and sighed in relief when he realised it was normal. Draco responded to Harry’s touch by moving his fingers and his head slowly.
The contempt in Harry’s eyes was immediate. I hated myself for making him feel that way about me, but there was nothing I could do. It was tragically funny that Harry believed my lie but not the fact that I loved him. Life really sucked.
Harry’s fingers touched my lips before I could say anything. I didn’t know whether to feel outraged or horny. It was hard to hold on to the impulse of biting those fingers. I wondered what he would do if I took them in my mouth and sucked them off. Could he tell I was excited? Harry’s poker face was so hard to read. He slowly removed his fingers away and left me empty.
“No, Harry. I’m sorry.” Bob got up and stared at Harry uneasily. “I didn’t mean to upset you. I just… Well, the truth is that I came here to warn you about Draco.”
At the same time, a big explosion and desperate screams were heard from outside the building. It took only a few seconds for Harry and the others to emerge of the courtroom and ask what was going on.
My heart wasn’t, but he didn’t need to know that. Here we were, in a distant country with our lives in danger, and all I could think about was kissing him. How insane was that? He was becoming the centre of my life. I should watch out. When that whole madness ended, our lives would be back to normal. He would go back to being just my old enemy, and I would be back to following his achievements on the news. If I dared to dream too much, I would end up a complete mess when he left me. He wasn’t mine. He never would be. I had to remember that.
“I don’t think so. We could talk to Hermione about our... hurry... in getting out of here, just to make sure she won’t get mad at us. She’ll understand,” Draco affirmed.
Harry wondered why Vernon Dursley was so concerned about not breaking a promise to a person he had barely met. Maybe he was being threatened? Or maybe the reason was less benevolent. If Harry took Nathan away, the easy money would stop.
“You’re right. I’m an Auror.  I should be looking for him. I’ll go gather some friends. Please, tell Herm.”
Eventually, Nathan woke up asking for news, but Harry had none. Nathan sat in Harry’s lap and rested his head against Harry’s chest. Then he focused on sensing his sister, but his last bout of healing had drawn him out. He could feel nothing but Harry’s quickened heartbeat. An hour and a half later, Ron appeared at Harry’s side with bags under his eyes from many sleepless nights.
He was right. If I had been arrested, I wouldn’t have survived a day in Azkaban. He knew that. My lawyers had managed a fair agreement with the Ministry of Justice Department to make sure I was kept out of prison.
“Hello, Harry. It’s good to see you!” Neville shook Harry’s hand and then looked at Nathan with a smile. “And what have we here? You’re Nathan Potter, aren’t you?” Nathan nodded and Neville went on. “Did you know that you look just like your father? The resemblance is amazing. The only difference is that you look a lot more charming than him. Harry never had the same effect you seem to have on women,” Neville joked and Harry rolled his eyes.
“You don’t have to say anything, Harry. I just wanted you to know that I would never hurt you. If I sounded a little harsh at the Dursleys’ it was because I knew the hell they had put you through and I wanted to bash that jerk on the head for doing the same to your kid. I ask you to forgive me because I have such a short temper. As for my declarations in the Daily Prophet, all I can say in my defence is that Ron must have misunderstood. And to prove my innocence, just look at the older editions of the newspaper. I said only nice things about you, Harry.”
They went silent for a moment until Harry said, “I’m more worried about your father now. Did he contact you?”
“Don’t be rude, brat! I am going to be fine,” I retorted, then turned to Astoria, “I hope you haven’t said anything to Scorpius.”
Nathan opened it carefully and his eyes went wide when a frog made of chocolate jumped out the little box and landed on his shoulder. Draco waited for a negative reaction, maybe a screech or a sob. What was he thinking, giving that to a child who had been raised like a Muggle? But Nathan neither screamed nor sobbed. He gave Draco a huge smile and Draco felt himself melting. That kid was adorable. He had such a sweet smile.
Harry glared at Lucius and then turned to Nathan. “Is it true? You got out of Sirius’ house on your own?” Nathan nodded and Harry asked, “Why?”
“When the war was over, I decided to do the same thing Drake did, and I left it all behind. But I missed our lifestyle, so I returned a few months later. Unfortunately, I lost the track of you guys. I found out later on that you and Harry were working at the Ministry but... Well, I guess I was kind of ashamed of my past...”
His tiny hand took something out of his pocket. It was a rather crumbled picture of a twenty-something woman who smiled and waved at whoever was behind the camera. Her mouth, nose, smile and brownish hair had Angel written all over them. Her eyes, however, reminded me of Alfred’s. The woman in the picture was obviously their mother.
Draco felt ashamed of himself. Truth was told, he didn’t know anything about that guy but what Hermione said to him. He trusted her, but she also didn’t know much about Saulus. In fact, she only had vague doubts about him because the moment he was elected coincided with Harry’s misfortune at work. What if it was just a coincidence?
"He doesn't know anything about us! And I'll make sure that he knows how much I love you." Harry walked to where Draco was sitting and held him tightly. "I hate seeing you like this. This is not you, Dragon."
Lucius didn’t contradict him. After a while, Saulus finally convinced Harry to leave Nathan there. When Harry was gone, Saulus stared at Lucius with concern.
Draco smiled weakly. “Yes, it is.” Draco stroked his belly gently and took a step forward so he was very close to Harry now. “Do you want to touch it?”
There hadn’t been any lies between Draco and Seamus, and their relationship lasted a year. The decision to break up had been Draco’s idea. At first, Seamus didn’t take it well. He didn’t talk to Draco for a week. But then he had come to his senses and their friendship was back in place.
I took the courage to unbutton his shirt. He didn’t stop me, which I considered a sign to go on. His shirt slid to the floor. I let my hands take a path of fire on his strong chest. Harry took a deep breath as his eyes fluttered shut.
Nathan nodded and Brutus barked. The dog raised his paw for Nathan to catch it. It was his way of saying goodbye to the child. Nathan smiled and even though Brutus was still dirty, he hugged him. While Draco led Nathan to the bathroom to watch his hands, Brutus did the same thing to Harry, who looked rather amused but also touched by the dog’s gesture.
Harry could be very smart but also very dense. I wasn’t just doing that for myself. I was doing it for him. I wanted to prove myself to him. That was my declaration of love. Of course, he would never understand that as it was hard for me to understand as well.
I bit his lower lip, then licked and sucked it to keep his taste for as long as possible. Harry sighed sweetly. To my despair, though, he pulled away.
“So you’ve come just because of me,” he provoked. Our eyes met and I wondered if his provocation was because things had always been like that between us, or if he was actually flirting with me. Of course, he wasn’t flirting. That would never happen. I was probably delusional.
Neville made a face. “I already have someone, thank you very much. I’m not jealous. Just try to be… less intense? This is a hospital after all. You can see Nathan in… let’s see… one hour?”
“It has… it… oh, yes… I can’t think… properly… with you… doing… this. Oh, fuck this! We can see the paper later.”
He prepared the other’s entrance sliding a lubricated finger inside of him, then two and finally three making gentle back and forth movements. He took the lubricant and spread its content on his hard on, then kissed the other man opening up his legs and plugging himself in cautiously. The stranger moaned loudly.
“I like that. A prey that struggles for life is always much more fun to play with,” Harry sneered. “I think humans are very interesting. They’re so contradictory. You, for example, used to hate Harry Potter, but then your feelings for him changed and now you love him. The same goes for him. Why is that? How can such hate become such passionate love?”
“I won’t let you do anything to Harry and Nathan!” Draco shouted, trying to hit the demon that was trying to impersonate Harry and steal his lover’s identity. Fake Harry ducked and laughed.
When Draco felt Harry’s arms steadying him, he broke down. He let the tears wash away the pain and guilt he’d been feeling inside. While he cried his heart out, Harry held him and whispered loving words in his ears. He repeated over and over how Draco was important to him, how he had pulled Harry out of his misery when they had gotten together, how he loved him no matter what.
“We’ll have to investigate then. In the mean time, I’ll go see Draco. He must be devastated. Why did you have to be so irrational and stupid, Harry? You didn’t even let him explain himself! Gee! He doesn’t even know why you broke up with him! If he’s a wreck I’ll personally break your face, Harry!”
Harry nodded, smiling slightly. "It was almost midnight and I was going to send a letter to Sirius when I saw you in the hallways. You looked suspicious – well, you always looked suspicious – so I decided to follow you and see for myself what you were up to. My heart almost came out of my mouth when you stopped at the Slytherin dressing room of the Quidditch pitch and you started to take off your clothes. I felt like a voyeur, but somehow I couldn’t look away. You hypnotized me. Then, of course, I had to spoil everything by stumbling on something. You saw me; we fought, as usual, and then Filch appeared out of nowhere. You pushed me into the broom’s closet and we spent the entire night locked up in there because Filch’s cat wouldn’t leave the door."
After one last inspection, Harry went to Nathan, who was already in a deep sleep on the couch. He took Nathan in his arms and put him to bed. Then he kissed Nathan’s cheek softly and kept staring at him for a long time. That was where Draco found him fifteen minutes later, still by his son’s side, stroking his little hand tenderly and guarding his sleep.
I woke up in bed alone. It wasn’t surprising given where we were. In fact, that Harry had given in to his desires and stayed with me longer than he should have was the real treat. We spent a long time in bed just holding each other. At some point, I dozed off, and he took the opportunity to escape. Not without some emotional struggle, I hoped.
He was wearing his detestable Auror uniform. I felt like ripping it off of him. He looked much better in Muggle clothes, even though I hated to admit it.
Dean looked down. He didn’t know if Draco was the right person to open his heart to, but he was the only one available right now. “I… Perhaps it’s better for him if I stay away.”
Bob winked. “My mother used to sing it to me. She said it was the only song that put me to sleep when I was just a little two-year-old brat. My cousin’s husband used to sing to it to their kid when it wasn’t even born yet. It helped to calm both father and child.”
Burke’s eyes squinted. I could only guess what he was thinking. I thought about using Legilimency against him but it was too risky. I was weak, and Burke wasn’t an air-head like Matilda. He had suffered that kind of magic before. I bet he could defend himself against it.
Harry opened his eyes wide, thinking that maybe Nathan had seen Dumbledore. He looked at Draco and saw that his husband was as astonished as he was. Draco muttered something quietly and Harry could read on his lips that he had the same suspicion. Dumbledore could be trying to help his son as a spirit.
Draco shook his head, refusing to believe that. “You’re lying! I don’t know what game you think you’re playing, but I won’t play along!”
Good question. Perhaps I was waiting for a divine sign of some kind. I took position, and a wave of excitement filled me up.
“I was the one who locked Nostrums up,” Nathan said. “I’m Toledo Calábria, or at least I used to be. When I put him in the ark, I cast a spell on it so that if the ark was ever opened again, I would know him even in the afterlife. When I was a monk, I dedicated my whole life to hunting Nostrums and capturing him.”
Harry just smiled knowingly. ‘I know that. I’m going to apparate and take you with me. You won’t have to spend any magic. I’ll do it for both of us.’
"I… Do you remember Cho Chang?" Draco shook his head and Harry went on. "She was a Seeker of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. I liked her a lot. In fact, we dated secretly for a while. I didn’t want anyone to know about us because I didn’t want to risk her life. After a few months, we broke up mostly because I didn’t like her the way I thought I did. A year later she died, and I discovered something. Or someone. I had a son, Draco."
The glint in Harry’s eyes was merciless, and the way he clarified things to me was enough to assure me that Lucius could not be involved with The Almighty without the Auror’s Squad knowing it – and putting a stop to it.
Harry’s eyes flickered and they only stared at each other for a long time. Draco was the first one to break eye contact.
Draco sighed. He had said a thousand times already that he wasn’t mad about the bloody ring. Harry had told him that at first he didn’t think about giving him the ring that belonged to his father. He had bought a golden ring studded with little diamonds to give Draco, but at the last minute he had decided that Draco deserved James’ ring because, well, Draco was his soul mate. Harry had said that in such a sweet way that Draco had melted. Now he was feeling upset rather than thrilled.
“As strange as it seems, Malfoy, I am putting my trust in you, aren’t I? Don’t ask me more than this. I don’t know what your intentions are. We are not friends. We cannot be friends. You know that. There are too many things between us...”
Draco did… very slowly just as he said he would, and when his erection massaged Harry’s prostrate, he completely lost control of his will. He wasn’t Harry Potter anymore but a body in search for relief. They were burning for each other. Harry kissed Draco and with his hands on Draco’s butt, he made him accelerate his thrusts. Harry’s head fell back and stars exploded in front of him. He moaned incoherently, to Draco’s delight. Draco had always loved to hear Harry mumbling sexy stuff like that.
In the end, the whole room got semi-destroyed, with papers flying all around. The house-elves were long gone. I heard Aurors shouting at the other side of the door. I couldn’t help to think that Harry needed better agents.
The farewell was a very sad scene to watch. Hermione couldn’t hold back her tears at the sight of Nathan wrapping his little arms around Draco’s neck and pleading him to come with them.
“That’s what Ron is trying to find out. They disappeared. Hermione thinks that Nostrums transferred them to a different magical dimension, but...”
“Fine. Have it your way then.” He stepped forward, took a penknife out of his pocket and opened the door with it.
‘Yes, I speak English perfectly well,’ she answered. She didn’t seem exactly offended but definitely pissed off.
"All right, boy, you won. I give up," Harry said to a satisfied Brutus. He stood up and went to the bathroom, coming back a few minutes later and sitting next to Draco.
“Mr Karl, as I was saying before,” Harry started politely but coldly, “I know we’ve failed. You forget, however, that twenty years ago these children hadn’t even been born. And I had truly hoped that a certain part of our wizarding community wouldn’t have turned their backs on their families.”
I assessed his mood. Harry looked like his usual Chief Auror self. It pissed me off. I decided to tease him.
“Sorry. I just thought I should remind you of your family roots to keep you humble and docile,” Ron said, not really giving a damn. “It’ll do you good, trust me.”
Harry sighed. He knew the reason why, but he still didn’t understand it. “He wanted Nathan. I guess… he was trying to prove something to Nathan. He said Nathan was once the monk who imprisoned him, so he wanted revenge.”
“The stuff we got from your secret room, or the little that was left after you had your fit, was really helpful.”
“She’s outside. Ron didn’t want her in the middle of the chaos because of her pregnancy.” Fred made a face. “Oh! So your pregnancy is the reason why Hermione told us to take you out right away!”
Silence filled the room as the boys left. Harry came towards me like a panther. I was frozen on the spot. Unfortunately, I was not what he was aiming for but the piano behind me. He stopped in front of the instrument and delicately pressed some of its keys. I came a little closer.
“Shacklebolt is a very good Minister,” I said and I hated myself for admitting it. “Nobody would dare say something otherwise.”
“And Nathan!” Harry shouted. “What the hell was he doing here? Why didn’t you get mad at him? He must understand once and for all that this is not a game! He...”
“Yes, the lemonade, which wasn’t lemonade at all. It just tasted like it. You drank it, so it was just a matter of time before it worked. It’s not a precise potion but I guess your love must be really strong. According to the notes I have, the potion works better the second time.”
I came to stand before him. “What exactly can’t you deal with? You can’t deal with the fact that you want me just as I want you? Is that it?” I pressed on. “Or is there more?”
"I was so blinded by hate that all I could see was Voldemort and how much I wanted to kill him. I did and then I felt lost and numb. I swore I wouldn’t love anyone again and then you walked into my life and you changed that. That’s why it’s so hard for me to say what you want me to say."
“But?” Draco clutched his fists to avoid shaking Fred, waiting for him to spill it all out instead of drawing it out in such suspense.
“He’ll take my son away from me, won’t he?” he asked Severus. “He will use him, and my son will obey him because of that sick Malfoy family code.”
“No, but the Unspeakables are almost sure that Lucius Malfoy is the one to blame. I don’t know whether this is true or not. No one believes that Lucius Malfoy is alive. And to accuse our dear Ministry of Magic of being part of it… Honestly, they are playing with fire. Talk whatever you want about Mr Fimcyl but don’t tell me he’s not doing anything good for our people. He is!”
"I know, Ron. And I know you mean well." Harry clapped his hand down on Ron’s shoulder reassuringly. "But I can’t stay here anymore. Maybe I can get a job in another department. Maybe I can go to Hogwarts. McGonagall said that she’d love to have me teach there."
Nathan would grow up and go to Hogwarts, and Hope would join him a few years later. He and Draco would watch their children follow their own paths, get married, have their own kids. And he and Draco would grow old together, in their little cabin in the woods, and they would watch their grandsons for the weekend.
By this point I couldn’t think about anything at all. My eyes could not move away from his. I tried desperately to read his feelings. He seemed angry, surprised and confused. He was quite disturbed.
"Yeah, I am, but..." Harry didn't know how to explain to them that he was scared to find out and he didn't know why he was having that weird sensation that his world would never be the same again once he opened up that vault. "I'll go there tomorrow."
“This is a Mage guide. I think you should read it,” he explained it. “By the look of things, I would say that Nathan is not a warrior but rather what they call a Shaman. You can tell by looking at him. He soothes people’s heart. That’s a great gift.”
My heart stopped. Had I spoiled everything? Should I risk it, even though…? Even though what? Our relationship was already complicated, and I had just made it all worse.
“If I’m not mistaken, we found her living with her brother in Poland,” said Harry. “She didn’t know where her son was. We watched her for a while. She died ten years ago.”
“Dr Jules told me that if I do everything right and don’t forget to take my vitamins I won’t have any problem. He said the wizarding medicine is very advanced in this field and that he hasn’t lost a patient in seven years.”
“So, just the exterior of someone’s body isn’t enough to fool your heart. That’s interesting. If I took you by force, would you still love him? If the physical appearance doesn’t matter… you would still love him, right?” Draco winced, and Harry laughed. “It’s funny, Draco. When I took Harry’s form, I didn’t count on this strong desire that my body feels for you. It’s very unsettling, but amusing in a weird way. I don’t like feeling this way. I should have known that there could be some side effects when I decided to take the form of a human... Humans have too many flaws and conflicts...”
Harry opened his eyes wide and chuckled. “Alas! I completely forgot!” Harry put Hope on the floor and ran upstairs. Hope quickly ran towards Hermione so she could convince her to put Arielle on the floor too so they could play, but Hermione shook her head. That mix was always a disaster. Hermione told her to play with John instead. Hope crossed her arms and pouted. Hope didn’t like to play with John because he never complied with her.
“Oh, it’s OK. This place needed new decoration anyway.” Sirius paused and then said, “Your story is amazing, Harry. Draco is pregnant! I can’t believe it. That’s why he looked so mute and out of place all day. I can only imagine the way he’s feeling about it.”
She noticed my present only after kissing Harry’s three times on the cheeks barely missing his lips. Then she whispered something in Harry’s ear. I was surprised at my self-control. I wanted to claw her eyes out.
Until that moment, I had managed to ignore him successfully. I had been able to nod in his direction just to let him know I had seen him. It hadn’t been that difficult. With so many fears haunting me that day, it had been easy to forget about him. I had other things to worry about.
“One question at a time, Harry,” Draco answered, tired. “Seamus and I met during the war. He was a spy for the Order of Phoenix, just like me. He saved my life when I was locked up in Voldemort’s prison accused of being a traitor. We became friends and eventually...”
When they traded their vows, Hermione’s loud sobbing interrupted them. Ron nudged her very subtly and she tried as hard as she could to stop.
“I can’t help it, Ron. It’s so romantic. Why didn’t you say all those things to me at our wedding?” she said, wiping her tears away. Ron didn’t answer. Instead, he looked at his sister and commented something about Neville to distract her. She insisted that her question be answered.
“No, I don’t believe that. I can read you,” Nathan said. “You would like to harm Draco, but you can’t. You felt Harry’s love for him, and that love is preventing you from doing a lot of things.”
To hell with propriety, I just wanted to feel his cock against mine. As I touched his member under his jean, he moaned against my lips. He seemed about to explode.
I really preferred the comfort of my chamber, where I knew I would be perfectly safe. I could already feel the familiar dizziness overtake me, and my stomach churned as I got dressed. I also began to sweat. These were typical symptoms of a person who suffered from panic attacks.
Harry spent the rest of the day pretending that nothing was happening. He enjoyed every minute with Nathan as if he wouldn’t have to leave and fight against Death Eaters once again. Nathan behaved just like the child he was. Not once did he mention the bad guys. He did seem a little spoiled but that was probably because of the way Sirius had been treating him like he was a little prince and his wishes were orders. But all in all, he was the same sweet kid as ever. He even showed Draco that Eerie was harmless as it was just a baby and in the end, Draco admitted that baby Eerie was kind of cute, until the little creature tried to peck him. Weird enough, Eerie behaved like the sweetest of things when Nathan was around. It was clear to everyone that the only one who the Hippogriff didn’t like was Draco, and so he spent the rest of the day locked in the guest room.
“Harry, that’s not how you do things!” Hermione called Harry’s attention. “First, you ask Nathan if he wants to go with you.”
“Because you’re very precious and I don’t want to ruin this moment that was given to me as a blessing. I want to make this night the best night of our lives.”
Draco sighed. “Haven’t you listened to what I just said? Lucius is not the one controlling the Death Eaters. He assured me.”
Harry turned his back on me and went to the door. I stood up, and even feeling nauseated and dizzy I kept myself upright.
“What are you up to this time, Malfoy? For somebody as sick as you, you’ve been quite energetic lately…”
“Think, Harry!” Sirius exclaimed angrily. “She’s Draco’s mother! Do you really think she would do something like this?”
We smiled at each other. I played a few more difficult chords, and even though he got a little confused in the end he managed to copy me again perfectly. He was incredible.
She calculated the mess inside his office: the papers on the floor, the crashed computer, the broken glass – courtesy of the also crashed paperweight – and the most astonishing thing of all, Harry Potter, naked as the day he was born. She flushed slightly and stared at him with her mouth fully opened. Everyone in the office knew about her infatuation with Harry. She wasn’t just confused and ashamed but also insanely jealous.
As Harry went down on his body Draco shivered, and when Harry’s mouth wrapped around his cock he shuddered violently. It didn’t matter how many times Harry had done the same thing with him; it always seemed like the first time. Harry had such a skilful mouth. He knew exactly how and where to lick and when to speed up the movements or suck him, sometimes gently, sometimes harder. It was heaven. Draco threw his head back in ecstasy completely forgotten about his previous decision to leave Harry for good.
"I will. Hey, why don’t you stay with Ron and Hermione? They have wards all over their house. You’d be safe there and I wouldn’t have to worry about you so much. Our house doesn’t have anything and now I wonder why. This place was supposed to have thousands of magic barrels! I’m an Auror, for Merlin’s sake!"
“Didn’t he say something to you, Potter?” Harry looked at Lucius with distrust, and Lucius rolled his eyes. “I think this is the time to trust us. Tell us what you know about Draco and it will be easier to find him.”
“I have a different power,” Nathan explained. “I can wake up people’s feelings. I can make them see what they are missing inside their hearts.”
Soon, all of Harry’s five senses were activated and stimulated. He felt Draco getting really close to his body again and he almost died as he felt the soft touch of Draco’s hand slipping down his belly. Fingertips teased him mercilessly. A smooth caress on his scar set him on fire. Then it moved down his nose, cheeks, lips – taking its time there for a while – nipples, navel and finally his hard cock. He moaned loudly. The same path was followed by Draco’s wet and cold tongue. Harry’s body shivered from head to toe, especially when the tongue surrounded his stiff shaft that was begging to be sucked. Draco did it all very slowly and gently, and if he asked Harry anything at that point, Harry would do it willingly. Harry was completely surrendered.
“Well, yes. I’m Harry’s godfather and I feel like his father most of the times. Nathan is like a grandson to me.”
Nathan decided for him, sending him back to the other side of the magical dimension. No matter how hard Harry protested, it was too late to go back. The last thing Harry heard from Nathan was: ‘I’ll be fine’.
"I don’t think you would like to know, Harry," Hermione answered. "Let’s just say that the smell is from the strawberry’s scent." Ron looked at her and she sighed. "It is! But the other things aren’t that nice. And the taste... it’s not as good as the aroma."
“Oh, I’m feeling better already.” Draco looked down at his very alive manhood that was demanding for attention.
“Yes, and they’re nice! They let us stay with them. They took care of us! They’re just like me. Nobody cares about us, so why should we care about the rest of the world?”
I don’t know how, but my hands grabbed his robes like claws and refused to let him go. It would be hilarious if it wasn’t so tragic. My vision began to go back to normal slowly. The world wasn’t spinning anymore. I looked at Harry, who seemed worried and confused, but also a little bit irritated.
Everybody in the room went silent. Remus’ shock was nothing compared to Sirius’. He’d never expected to reveal his old feelings after so long. The rest of the crew was only staring at the scene with amazement, except for Draco, who was thinking about his mother. She and Sirius were a couple, right? Then what the hell was he talking about? He thought that Sirius loved Narcissa. Apparently, he was wrong, and he would kill Sirius if he broke his mother’s heart. The only one who didn’t find the declaration interesting was Severus, who only muttered a ‘finally’.
