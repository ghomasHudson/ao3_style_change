He faintly noticed the sorting of the new attendants.. very few new Slytherins, but they were applauded nonetheless.
That was until he heard voices outside his compartment… an alohomora and granger barging in.
She smiled, taking his hand from his side now. He let her drag him to the dance floor again, the spelled instruments we playing a soft rather upbeat song, it frankly fit Luna perfectly (Merry go round from howls castle incase anyone is wondering, its such a lovely song and it literally sounds like fucking magic).
Draco, a lot more confident this time walked up to her first. “Bonjour mon amour.” He purred at her, tapping her nose carefully. “You happen to see a leopard walking around here darling?” the horse, of course, didn’t reply, she just pushed her head into his chest.
“I just remembered, there’s something I have to get from the library.. Can you take my bags? I’ll meet you in a bit.” Draco asked, holding his bags out to the two of them.
Sighing he closed his own curtains, downing his sleeping draught. He didn’t have a lot of vails, but he was certain he could find a way to make himself more.
When he walked back into the room smelling faintly of honey almond soaps and in a fresh set of clothes he found Harry staring at him with soft eyes. He still had some tear stains on his face but there was a healthy glow to him. Like having the cat at night had taken a weight off of him.
The song for this chapter was most definetly Raise hell by DOROTHY. I found it a few days ago and I've been loving it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“My my. Try again. You can do better than that.” Harry snickered, lighting his own, showing him how to do it.
Step two:
Just want to say I'm kinda living for Harry and the snow leopard cuddles. Also snow leopards really do curl up with their tail in their mouth. Look it up please its incredibly heart warming.
Draco made his way straight over to Blaise. “Looks like at least one of us had a half decent night huh?” he grumbled. He was never a morning person. “I cannot believe they put me up with Potter out of all people. Like I didn’t have to watch my back enough already.”
“I hope were in time, the poor thing looks beat up badly.”
“I.. It’s hard.” He confessed softly. “I promise I’ll try potter.” He said before moving away, grabbing a sleeping shirt. He didn’t want to have a sobby talk now.. not with Harry Potter of all people. Before he could make his way over to the bathroom however. He felt a pair of strong arms wrap around his waist. He jumped at the touch. But leaned into it. “You’re a sob Potter.” He whispered. Not willing to admit he did need a hug.
He glanced at Potter. Who seemed just as reluctant as him. “..5…4…” he made his way over to a pole. Potter could follow his lead if they were going to do this.
“I expected no less Malfoy. Want to try again? This time keep your shoulders straight, don’t lean forward.. oh and to get her into a trot, press your heels into her stomach and click your tongue. She responds really well so no need to kick her.” He instructed.
It was a Thursday night almost two weeks after they baking class when he woke up to Harry nearly screaming next to him. Alarmed he rushed to his side. “Harry? Harry whats wrong?” he asked immediately, quite panicked. The other was drenched in sweat. Gasping for air and pulling at his clothes. Draco cast a quick mufilato and a locking spell on the door. He sighed. He knew he couldn’t wake Harry up. not when he was this far gone. Instead he went to his usual tactic.  If Harry were to turn violent the cat could get away easier and it definitely could take more.
Mandy Brocklehurst and Sally smith, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff had been friends before and seemed to do just fine together.
Harry snorted. “That’s more of a curse to you than it is to me. I’m a terrible dancer Draco.”
Which he did. Thankfully. It was around 5 am when the first rays of sunshine came through the curtains. Stirring him awake. He managed to get out of the others grasp. Storming into the bathroom to turn back to his human form, dusting himself off. Before returning to his own bed. Thank god it was Sunday and he could sleep in.
Despite his best efforts he couldn’t catch his sleep. Mind running wild with thoughts of self- doubt and hatred. His body was tired. So bloody tired. But his head wouldn’t stop picking him apart. His grumbled he tossed and he turned. Eventually settling for spelling his bed to look like he was fast asleep in it, complete with soft snores and all and turning into the snow leopard once more. Perhaps some cold autumn air and a walk around the grounds would help him.
“Fair enough.. Say since I helped you right. Would you be willing to look over my potions essay. I’m lost.”
“Pretty wrecked. How about you? you seemed pretty tired last night.”
Step one:
“It’s ok Hermoine, I’ll live through this.” His gaze landed on Potter who had his hands balled in fists. “I’m sorry for messing up the training schedule.. I’m sure I’ll be back up tomorrow.” He tried to smile.
There were a lot of disappointed groans until Pip appeared with a crack.
“how about we drink another cup of tea and then do it? If we pull it too soon it could collapse in. its just 8 more minutes and then it’ll be done.” Draco hummed, summoning his kettle and holding it up. Harry reluctantly held out his mug and let it be filled. He didn’t complain when Draco put just a little honey in it  Without asking if he wanted any. He wasn’t a big fan of sweet tea but.. With draco taking the lead overall he trusted him on this one.
But they got him at least a few hours of sleep each night. Nightmare less sleep. He always thanked her. To which she replied. “Mistress Malfoy cannot care for Master Draco very well. So pip must. But Pip is glad Master Draco is doing better.” He had smiled at her softly. Giving her a little pat on her little head. She reminded him of Dobby. He remembered that silly little deviant elf.
“it was the graveyard again. Where he came back..” potter.. no Harry croaked. Draco nodded, taking the glass from him and carefully sitting down on the bed with him, not next to him but close enough to put an arm on the others arm. Trying to ground him as he still looked a little out of it.
By the time Draco came out in his uniform, Blaise and Pansy were back. They looked even more battered than he had been. “She’s the devil. Anderson had to stop her on the fifth try… I’m so tired Draco..” Pansy cried, attempting to hug him, he quickly stepped aside. Not willing to get mud on his clean outfit.
He smirked to himself as Amour managed to outsprint Merlin, short for Merlin’s saggy balls as Weasley had named the horse, every time. He could imagine the laughter coming from the two guys racing each other. he sighed softly. Feeling a ease once more. Things were looking up. things were happy today.
“Potter. There was nothing more I wanted than to die in sixth year.. I.. I thanked you on that floor as I was bleeding out. Nearly cursed you when I woke up again because I did. It’s fine… let’s talk about it when I’m not drunk.” The other pulled his shoulder, turning him back around.
“socializing.”
“When am I not.” He replied, voice steadier than he thought it would be.
Yet again he made the guy nearly jump out of his skin. “Potter.”
“Surely. How about we name her Amour. The French word for love. Make her sound a lot more lovely than she is.” Draco huffed.
Harry just laughed. “Oh god. It’s not. I was under the cloak when you were dragged through the snow last time. There’s a tunnel there that’ll get you home quicker, safer. And it’s a bit warmer than out here in the cold.”
Eventually finding the candy lady found him. Leading him to her own compartment. It was rather small but.. Pansy and another Slytherin were also on the hide there. Provided with sweets and cold iced pumpkin juice from the overly friendly, possibly senile lady. They were all chattering softly. “Now shush shush. No one should have to wander around the train like that. Someone has to look out for you. I will be making my rounds. Please do not make a mess.” He nodded in reply. Sitting down in one unoccupied spots in the corner.
“You and your teammate will be going through this. Your sight will be impaired and there will be new obstacles. To avoid anyone getting hurt by a misused spell in panic. You’ll be going one team at the time and there are wards put in place to keep you from using anything dangerous. The challenge is easy. Get through and you’ll be escorted to the next challenge with professor Anderson.” Leigh hummed. Pointing to Draco and him. “You two are up first.” She grinned. Pushing them towards the mist.

“Oh sod off. If you can’t take it, stop listening to it.”
About half an hour later a alcoholic butterbeer was plopped down in front of him. “Lost you Malfoy. You’ve got to at least give me a chance to keep up my end of the deal.” Potter snorted, joining them. “I thought you’d never come.” Draco said dramatically. Happily downing the beer. He normally wasn’t much of a beer lover. But he made an exception if it came to free beer from no one other than the golden boy.
Step five:
He carefully danced with her, waiting for her to speak. She didn’t at first before she squeezed his hand lightly. “I never thanked you Draco.. for taking care of me in the manor. I know what they did to you when they found out. I should’ve come to your trail but I had to go to st mungo’s for a while after the war.” She suddenly sounded much more like an adult.
Draco rolled his eyes. Simply walking over to the bed his trunk was sat in front of, putting up a ward and grabbing his toiletries. Ignoring would be the best course of action. Fuck whatever contract they had been tricked into. Potter could go ahead and fend the fuck for himself.
By the time they were done.. things were quite friendly between them. Draco flopped down on the grass after doing Harry’s completely necessary cooling down stretches. He was battered. Craving water, which neither had brought. Like the dumbasses they were.
“Who’s sarah?” Draco asked, raising a brow.
“I was joking Potter.”
Draco froze in place. Absolutely not, he had no intention of visiting madame Pomfrey again so soon. But then again. He couldn’t be losing his streak with their wins.. “Will you hold her like.. really do? I don’t want to fall..” he didn’t look away from Amour, she seemed to put some sort of spell on him, he felt the sudden tenseness ebb away. So that’s what they were mixed with huh.. unicorn. A magical race of horses the old wizards used to ride with before apperation was a thing.
“come on. Everyone is going. Even Hermoine.” Pansy elbowed him in the ribs, earing herself another glare. She could be quite annoying. Truly.
Minerva walked up to their table the second dinner ended, Anderson in her tracks. The man looked them all over with an icy glare, smirking slightly. Trouble.
“I wouldn’t do that death eater. I’ll have you put right into Azkaban.” An unfamiliar voice said from behind him.
He snorted in reply, closing his eyes. He felt sore, sweaty and dirty.. but accomplished. It was nice. Potter wasn’t to bad of company right now…
“Shut up Parkinson. Eat your toast and tell us about who’s been Paired with who. I’m curious.”
“Whatever.” Draco hadn’t waited to see. Walking away from the field as fast as he could.
By the time he was supposed to receive his wand.. he got a note instead. His wand had been destroyed.. when Potter used it to fight the dark lord it had split… so he was allowed a pardon for a trip to Olivander’s. Accompanied by an Auror official.
“I can’t leave either way.. And I’d rather not end up with Weasley as my roommate.” He tried to joke but it came out serious. He was serious. Other than Blaise and maybe Neville  he didn’t trust anyone to not attempt murder or ridicule him when he woke up  screaming from his nightmares. He shook his thoughts off.
That seemed to wake him up.
It took him about 30 seconds of carefully following Potters movements before simply giving in. laughing his ass off at how incredibly dramatic he acted out the lyrics. He was full on dancing now. Snickering. “Oh this one is good too. One more since you missed half of the last one.” Potter gave him his begging eyes.
“I can tell. They shouldn’t have let you drink so much.” Harry sounded a bit pissy now.
“Draco where is your coat?” the voice now said, addressing him.
They heard the first team being called back. Pansy and Hermoine… Pansy was attempting to hit Granger with the pole.. He shook his head. No time for distractions.
I've been hit by quite the writers block. Depression is a bitch and I gotta stop hanging out with her.
“So, standing up, knee and hips. Anything else?”
“The hearing of Lucius Abraxis Malfoy shall be moved as new evidence has come forward by accounts of his wife and son.” Another slam of the hammer. His hands were freed.
“Isn’t Wednesday when you take your runs with Harry?”
Pansy said nothing, shoving a plate into his hands. “Eat darling. Everyone is just worried.. do you really not know who did it?”
“It’s useless potter. Does it need some kind of spell?” The other asked frustrated. Harry had trouble stopping himself from laughing.
“Always. Let’s go before I change my mind.”
Anderson gave them all another look over. Sending an icy shiver down Draco’s back. He already had trouble with looking people in the eye. This wasn’t easy. But he knew he couldn’t let himself be stepped on if he wanted to be respected by the man.
“Your element has nothing to do with your house. It is the core of your magic. You, stripped down beyond your personality. The traits I just named are traits you are likely to have. Your magic will be at its strongest when using magic based on the element you present and some of its base values. So for homework I would like you all to attempt to find your core. When you have found it, I want a paper on the values that do and do not match for you personally. Some self-reflection.” After that Anderson explained more about wandless magic. How little it was used in Norway because they viewed magic as something to only use when it was necessary. How their root beliefs were that magic was a gift from the gods. Harry found it all rather interesting. It was intriguing. He was rather excited about the class and eager to learn more. Which was rare for him.
“Any time potter.” He gave him a kind little smile, remembering how broken the other had seemed. He shouldn’t be ashamed about waking up practically cuddling with another guy. Harry had needed it and lets be fair. He himself was touch starved and he hadn’t minded it much. What he did mind was the fact it yet again felt so damn natural. So domestic and.. good.
Ron came walking out with a Ravenclaw. Oliver Rivers, whom looked quite disheveled. Perhaps a brawl had gone down between the two.
“Did you happen to catch the notice?” Draco looked up, realizing he hadn’t been listening to potter rambling about how this leopard really was something special and how it had in fact contributed to his good sleep. No he had missed that completely.
“Oh don’t you worry. I’m grateful.” She smiled at him, letting Draco spin her around and fall back into his arms. “I always knew you were good, the wrackspurts were always around you, they made your brain fuzzy but I knew you wanted to be good.” She poked his nose playfully.  It made him smile for some reason. He regretted not befriending her before everything. He had been a prick before of course but… despite her tendencies.. she was kind. She was probably what he would have needed.
Reluctantly however he let Harry drag him out to the field for a run. They went for a rather intense workout. Plopping down in the wet morning grass beside the lake near the end of it. They’d done everything in silence aside from the occasional exercise switch.
He’d seen right through him. Reluctantly he put his bookmark in place and followed Potter to their room.
“Sort of. Except you stand and sit in the saddle. Keep your ankles still. The movement comes from your hips and knees.. were going left side in first. So I want you to stand up when the right leg goes forward.” Harry spelled the lead longer. Letting the horse walk away from him and letting it turn left.
Before he could yell at her to shut up he was surrounded by none other that Blaise, Pansy, Hermoine and Potter himself. each asking him what happened and trying to fuss.
The next morning he awoke to the sound of someone emptying the contents of their stomach. He sat up.. too fast. His head was spinning. He wasn’t much of a puking guy. He got headaches and a terrible mood.
7 shots, each a different color of the rainbow consumed right after each other before downing a beer. Even he was surprised he made it through. His vision had started spinning after the bottle of blue mixed vodka that had given him cavities from simply smelling it. And that was three rounds ago.
He took a moment to look at Draco. “Can you.. I know it’s a lot to ask. But can you please stay. I’m afraid it’ll come back.” He whispered lowly, Draco could see him swallow back a sob.
“Oh ok..” his voice broke a little.
“No. It’s a ballpoint pen Malfoy. There is ink inside it.”
“I’m fine Potter… don’t worry about it.” His voice was flat. Void of any emotion he’d rather not shine through.
“Given me what I deserve Blaise. I just hope they decide this isn’t worth it every evening.” He croaked back. Had someone chocked him? His throat felt bruised.. well his whole body felt bruised.
Reluctantly the other followed him into their dorm. Leaving Blaise and Longbottom behind.
“Hmm?” he muttered, not willing to open his eyes. “We got you some dinner darling. You’ve been asleep all afternoon and Potter has been guarding you like a dog. Telling us you’d need the sleep after whatever happened.”
Draco nodded. “Sounds like a plan.” He said quietly. Smiling softly to himself as he made a slice to hand to Leigh who announced that if they were happy with their results they could deliver to her. She’d be grading their recipes over the afternoon with Anderson. Draco simply wished them luck judging 20 slices of bread but it would make for an easy grade.
“what could I possibly need your help with golden boy.”
Harry pretended to be offended. “I’m Gryffindor through and through.”
Before them appeared the parkour. It reminded Draco of the Auror parkours he had visited as a child in charm school. Poles to hop over, a crawling part. There were a few jumps over a rather muddy bit of water, a climbing wall.. it was bloody awful. He began to regret skipping lunch as his stomach turned.
“Oh shut up Potter.” Draco spat back, no real venom behind it as he let the flames go out.
“I know.. which is why I forgive you.” she squeezed his hand again. However weird and out of touch this whole experience was. It was rather comforting.
Blaise reluctantly picked out a band. So did Oliver, Neville, Potter, Weasley and the lot of them. Draco could already hear yelling come from the boys quarters. It made his heart sink.
“Don’t be shy Malfoy.. try this one then.”
Breakfast was a quite affair. But during potions first period Pansy scooted next to him. “So. What’s up?”
He took a sharp breath as the guards took him by his arms. Dragging him out of the cell he had called home the past few months.
He grunted. She was right. He was rather calm today. He felt rather alright for once despite the little sleep.
The both laughed as Anderson dragged them with to the next part of today’s exercise. Horses.
“Draco Malfoy huh… as infamous as Harry Potter is famous.” There was no maliciousness in his tone.
He was last to pick up a silver bracelet. They were surprisingly heavy. He could feel the magic lingering on it.
Draco hesitated for a moment. Taking a deep breath. “Alright. Is it the same as the walk?”
“Did. I’m not happy either.”
“It was him wasn’t it?” Draco asked softly, looking at Harry with soft eyes. The other just nodded in reply, taking the glass of water gladly as he sat up.
Dinner went quite alright. McGonagall’s threat seemed to have worked. No spells were thrown his way over dinner. Draco managed to eat at least something.. though it was mostly deserts that Pansy shoved onto his plate.. such a mom.
The rest of the week passed rather quick and uneventful. They got a notice that while they would be permitted alcoholic beverages at the Samhain ball but if they got caught giving any underage students they’d be toast. Draco felt rather pleased. He could appreciate a good drink and it was said they’d even be allowed during dinner.
Harry was excited. He looked forward to these classed the most. They were fun, exciting and a great way to put his mind to something.
They did this for about thirty minutes. By the end Draco felt confident enough to ride by himself. and had some of the basics under control. They would try  galloping tomorrow since class was canceled.
“The horrible griffin that nearly deformed me permanently?”
He sighed. Might as well give in. watch the door. Be vigilant. He trusted this wand. It was powerful. He had gotten to know it over the past few weeks. It felt better than his old wand. They worked on a whole new level… though it did have bit of a mind of its own. Very prone to fire. He had accidentally lit the yellow love seat on fire the other day… the elves weren’t pleased but had said nothing of it. It rather suited him. Being named after the dragon constellation and all. He watched the door.. soon losing himself in though as the train started filling up.
“I’m good. Still straight.”
He silently gathered his stuff. Walking through the door with Potter no problem. Mostly no problem as Draco simply refused to even look at him or touch him and with Potters rather broad frame this seemed to pose a slight problem.. but they managed. The others seemed to figure this out as well.
He couldn’t help it. Draco let his expression soften for a moment. “I understand what you mean..” he muttered, before his features hardened again. He wasn’t bout to tell Potter he had spend his summer learning how to bake bread like a little bakery boy.
“You drink like a pussy.” Seamus huffed, pointing to the bottle. What had felt like half the bottle was in fact not much past the neck of it.
So he did what he could. Turning and  purring. Steadying his breathing and latting Harry grasp and pull on his fur. He could take it.
“That’s great! I’ve noticed how well you two are getting along so far. I’d say you’re almost on top of the class bonding wise. Couples and best friends aside. I realy hope the two of you decide to stay.”
“Asking favours after the fact? How very Slytherin of you. My notes are on the desk. You can compare them and ask me any questions after.” He hummed, taking one of the cookies.
“What are you doing here buddy? Are you alright?” why was his voice so shaky?  who cared, he looked at the hand Harry reached out… was he offering pats? Pats seemed nice.
“… and so I will sentence Narcissa Malfoy nee Black to 5 years of probations. As well as a year of house arrest. Weekly checkups will be done and 10 percent of the Malfoy fortunes will be put to Charity work. Her wand shall be returned in 6 months.” He looked at his mother. She was sobbing. He gave her a weak smile. She deserved that.. she deserved her freedom. She hadn’t always been a good mother. But he knew she cared.
“It’s a deal then.”
He choked. “What kind of question is that?” he asked, turning to her fully now. Unable to keep a light flush from coloring his cheeks. The position he had been in this morning.. sure could have been compromising.
“Fine. Sure. Why not. But you have body guard duty.” He grumbled.
The old man gave him a smile. Gave him the list with wandcare and some supplies. Phoenix had a different care than unicorn and he would have to get used to it. He paid richly for the wand before drinking his Polyjuice stepping out to make his way to flourish and blots to get his books. No one stared at him. But he still felt looked at.
“So about last night.” Potter started.
“Don’t you think he should go back too? I know it’s early but I’m quite tired..” there was a warm voice behind him, he liked that voice, it made him quirk up from his pouting over the fact no one was letting him drink anymore.
“You were reading a horror story and you weren’t enjoying it.”
So tonight they had spoken about it. Ron had admitted he was leaving school in January, Hogwarts wasn’t his place anymore. He didn’t feel at home here and he had been offered an Auror apprenticeship, something Harry wouldn’t stop him from taking. Ever. They had talked about Hermoine wanting to stay and how he’d come visit them when he could during the weekends in Hogsmeade. He had been supportive, smiled and told him that he should do what felt right.
Harry couldn’t help it. Bursting into laughter. “Fucking hell Malfoy. She won’t hurt you.”
Harry left the room, pocketing the frogs. He was set on it though. It felt right. Helping Draco. And it was a means to get the wizarding world to accept those who weren’t put into jail and had their actions excused. And.. even after all those years of being pretty much bullied by Malfoy.. he couldn’t hate him. Something about his pestering had been a distraction from it all. Malfoy had always been the same.. well until sixth year when things went downhill incredibly fast.
Harry already had his outfit planned out. Much like the outfits Durmstrang had worn during the Christmas ball. Fur included. He was excited about it. He wasn’t one to put much thought into outfits but… it was Pansy who had told him he had to shine for the ball and she wouldn’t take no for an answer.
“fine, pull me up then.” He held up his hand, Draco took it, pulling harry behind him. His face flushing slightly at the closeness of it all. “Hand me the reigns.” He felt a pair of arms wrap around his waist and a warm chest press against his back… the worst of it was the breaths against his neck. he had to do everything to keep himself from squirming and making things more awkward. He handed the reigns over nonetheless.
They spend some time with her. Even taking her out to brush her, which Harry seemed to know how to do properly. Amour didn’t seem too phased by anything they did.
“I suppose I shouldn’t ask why Harry Potter knows how to calm down the giant murderous tree they keep at the Hogwarts grounds?” Draco snorted.
They did end up making quite the mess when Harry grinned at Draco, slapping a flour covered hand onto Draco’s back. Draco had been avoiding all the dirty work. Only touching the dough when it was ready to be formed. His face twisting into something between anger and disgust. It earned Harry two flour hands on his chest as he pushed him back lightly.. all in all the were now covered in flour from head to toe.
Tuesday was rather relaxing. The soreness was disappearing from his body and after Runes he was dragged to Pomphrey’s office by Blaise to get his eye fixed. After dinner he found himself in the common room. Reading one of the books his mother had send. It was a rather interesting muggle book the lord of the rings. About this very tiny dwarf like creature. It had no modern muggle appliances so he could follow it fairly well.
He shoved the notebook back under his pillow. Thinking back on the past while.
“shut up Malfoy. You need one. I need one.” The other muttered against his shoulder.
“Has he tried a mind healer?” Draco wasn’t offended. He knew Weasley would never accept him he was surprised Har.. Potter kept trying really.
Once they arrived at the great hall. all 8th years were appointed a new, smaller table in the back. Draco, Pansy and Blaise managed to get a spot on the far right end of it. As far away from any other classmates as they could… so far the 4 Hufflepuffs seemed to be alright with them. The 5 Ravenclaws were giving their usual curt nods, at least acknowledging their existence. Gryffindor, all 7 of them, shielded behind a wall of the other students were glaring daggers. Most of them at least from what Draco could tell in the quick glance he dared to shoot them.
“Contrary to popular belief I do work out sometimes Potter.”
“Still. Come here for a second. Close your eyes and hold your hands out.”
He nodded to Blaise, who grinned at him. “I suppose I should change too then. I’ll see you at the ball. I’d wait for you but I’ve got a date for the night.” He hummed disappearing.
It send a strange warmth through him. Potter looking out for him huh… that was a nice change. Potter willing to state he wants to be friends. It warmed him through. It made him feel safe, even if it might just be a loose promise.
“No.. Malfoy its ok. You can stay. All the other carriages are full.” Hermoine said, plopping down opposite of him as more of the Gryffindor team joined.
“So you’re also paired up with one of the golden trio. Seems like we both got unlucky.” Draco huffed.
“Don’t know what you’re talking about.”
It was a rather cold Saturday evening at the start of october when Draco finally found himself able to take some rest. Reading by the fire. Today’s book was called IT. He couldn’t supress the nasty shivers the book send down his spine every once in a while. Whatever this Clown creature was. He was hoping to avoid ever coming across it.
Speaking off the devil. Weasley came in. He and Rivers looked like they had taken a swim in the mudpuddle. He looked away, but caught their conversation.
“No.”
Breakfast was rather uneventful otherwise. Time tables were handed out and an announcement called for the 8th year students to meet Professor Anderson and Professor Leigh out in the fields later. “Wear outdoorsy clothes. Were going to have a great bonding moment.”
“Oh sod off. It was pretty great, I’ve never done it so well before!” Harry said with mock disappointment. They both laughed softly.
Draco just hummed in reply. Disappearing into the shower attached to their dorm. Wondering if he could get away with transforming it into a bath and dozing off in it… probably not worth the effort. Besides he had to save some magic to finish his charms homework. He couldn’t afford a nap.
“Dun wannaaaa.” He whined, looking up, harry was wearing a frown. “fineee.” He huffed, making an attempt to sit up. at this point he was completely unaware of anyone else. His focus had already been shit lately and alcohol wasn’t helping.
“See this is exactly why I asked you. You’re logical about it. Let’s do that then.” Harry seemed pleased with his answer. He took another look at the picture before handing it back. Taking a few good swigs of his chocolate milk, noting the hint of cinnamon. Potter had some serious skills when it came too cooking at least.
They returned to the common room just fine. Putting down the plate and each taking a bun. The rest of the 8th years soon gathered around them to grab a bun too. Pip seemed to have known this would happen because soon two more plates as well as a tray of tea and tea cups began to appear. What was supposed to be studying before dinner turned into cozy tea time, making Draco feel warm and fuzzy inside. Since when did that happen? Since when did Hogwarts start feeling more and more like home again?
“Live with it. You snore at night. Haven’t heard me complain about that yet have you now.”
He stood there. Shaky and obediently. He felt a great deal of magic hitting him be tried to keep his breath steady. After about five minutes he felt a wand hitting in his hand. It stayed there. “Open your eyes.. I believe you have found your match… a hawthorn Phoenix. Highly excentric… a healing wand. Best matched with a wizard in turmoil. A talented wizard which you most definitely are.. and an independent decisive core.. it seems Draco.. that you are in for a lot of change and good things in your future.”
Potter shot him a glance. He was in for more questioning later… Draco would just have to pretend to be asleep then.
He ignored the stares, placing a hand on Harry’s hip and holding his other. he was glad he’d led Blaise before and was used to looking up to a partner. His grey eyes glinted slightly. Harry just looked into his eyes. “Don’t look down now Potter. Just follow me.” He shot him a smile, trying not to show he was nervous. This was the second time within a week that he was close to Potter. A bit too close. The music started and carefully he begun their waltz. wincing a little when Harry stood on his foot the first time. Soon enough though they found the Rhythm. Spinning around gracefully rather Daring when they picked up the speed. It was quite the sight to see for outsiders.  It was both elegant yet rough, a small battle broke out in which Potter took the lead, now leading Draco across the floor, glaring slightly at one another as Draco let himself be spun out and back into the others arms. Despite his reservations about it, he accepted the role, following Harry, adding more grace to the dance.
“Not true Draco. I’ve got 3 main partners. 2 potentials and Pansy as a backup. Speaking off.  Offer still stands Malfoy.”
Draco found himself staring. No. admiring. This was a side he hadn’t seen before.
Harry watched him closely. This was a new look on Draco… sad, drunk and pouting. He felt bad having to pull away, but it was freezing out and without a coat.. he didn’t want to get sick, seeing how Draco felt bad about everything already.. he couldn’t bare even thinking of the guilt he’d feel if Harry got sick for lending him his coat.
With that he just left them. Making Draco look semi panicked at Harry.
Bake bread at 200c for 35 minutes after rising, its ready to bake when you poke it and it bounces back.
“And did you believe that? that you were chosen?” he couldn’t read the others emotions. His eyes were too blurry.
“We’ll find McGonagall in the morning. First thing. I’m worried too. tomorrow is a normal school day, let’s just try to get some sleep Harry.” Hermoine spoke softly.
“Now that I have your proper attention.. No mr Finnigan you can stay down.. Today were working on trusting your roommate.” She paced in front of them. “Getting rid of old values, creating understanding. Do not get me wrong. I know this is going to take more than one exercise and not all of you will succeed in forming a proper bond… but it I think it will be worth it.”
They split up in two groups. Boys and girls. Surprisingly there was an even split between the 20 of them. “You will take up a band. I will give you the blessing and the band will draw you to a room. There you will wait to meet your roommate. Understood?” Anderson sounded rather firm. But he seemed excited. “Please do be mindful. This ritual is very important in our culture. Its one of passing into adulthood. One of growing up and leaving your younger selves behind. Each of you will receive a band and a role for the sports team, which I am happy to announce you will all be partaking in to let out some steam… now let us begin..”
“Do you.. want to talk about it? You obviously don’t have to.” He whispered, soft enough for the other to ignore if he didn’t want to.
“am I supposed to finish it?”
“Thank you guys so much..” she muttered nearly, looking in the mirror Draco had enlarged for her so she could see herself. “I can’t believe…”she fumbled for words. Just hugging the two boys instead.
“Ganging up on me huh.. Mean.”
“Learn to pace yourself! If Harry and Malfoy can do it so should we!”
“Don’t tell me you got Potter.”
He didn’t know when he had.. but he did eventually fall asleep. Keeping his promise and staying with the other. not caring about what the morning would hold.
“Yes prime minister Shacklebolt?” he asked, trying to look the other in the eye.
“It’s Samhain. Humor me at least.” He smirked. He had a good feeling about this dress.
“You looked like you were zoning out.. I asked if you wanted to go to lunch.”
“Yeah but.”
When he came back Harry had gathered his stuff to jump into the shower.. “Hey erm. Draco?” he said it so softly. Damnit.
8pm. Right. Most students were gathered up. Dressed rather nice. They were missing the Parvati twins, Granger and a few others whose names Draco didn’t particularly remember. He got grouped to leave through a secret entrance near the big willow tree that would kick your ass if you got to close. He raised a brow at Potter and Blaise. They were the only group of five and last to leave. Sneaking through the hallways quite effectively.
“We won’t kill you. not on purpose. We’ll just punish you. like you punished us last year. Like the ministry refuses to do for you.” the voice spoke again.
“I promise.. I told you last night right? I’m keeping you safe.” He didn’t sound hurt by Draco’s need of reaffirmation of it, instead putting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing gently. “Let’s start with simply brushing her and getting her ready.” He hummed.
Overall it was a rather tiring experience. But Harry was a good coach, Draco had to admit that. Working with Draco’s abilities and not complaining whenever he slowed down. He simply matched his speed, gave some tips and with some banter inspired him to go on.
“Master Draco should not mind such things. Pip likes helping. Pip wants to make Master Draco feel happy.”
“Ron you’re not sneaking out of the school.” Hermoine started.
“I’ll wait for you two. Go get cleaned up its nearly dinner time.” Draco grinned, suddenly even more glad for team captain Potter.
One of the elves. Pip. Had taken to Force Draco to eat. She also kept bringing him sleeping potions. God knows where she was getting them.
“Harry you had a nightmare. Do you want me to sit closer? It might help grounding you. try to focus on my breathing alright.” Harry nodded slowly. Draco carefully peeled the covers away, sitting next to him and pushing their legs and shoulders together. Going as far as to take the others hands the way his mother had done for him when he had dreams this bad.
“True.. Gra.. Hermoine why don’t you?” he had started using her first name just last week. He was still getting used to it. She smiled friendly in reply.
“Fair enough.. do you wanna try getting better with the horse then? I can Lunge you around the field. You’ll still be tied up and you can stop any moment.”
“What?” harry asked, looking himself over. His side and bed was covered in white fur. He raised an eyebrow.
Potter flopped down besides him. “You did well Draco.”
“Oh this is awful.” He muttered.
When it came time to making the jam Draco wrote down the ingredients for Harry to gather. Cleaning up their work station with some simple spells. He’d gotten quite efficient at those over summer.
Today I decided to finish bit of a longer chapter I haven't looked it over like i usually do because my mood has been kind of down. My dog has been Sold. I came home to find him gone and its really broken me up on top of a lot of other things I've got going on...
“Have you ever smoked?” Harry asked, leading them outside, popping out  a pack.
“So Ron… I believe you owe me a bottle.”
“Today we will make a start on Norse Paganism. As you all know I come from Norway myself. Me and Professor Leigh were raised with a different type of magic. We believe magic comes from the northern gods. I won’t ask you to take on my beliefs. But I do ask for your respect as I will respect yours. If there is any spell or ritual you are not comfortable with, let me or professor Leigh know. We will take note and avoid those for your OWL’s and NEWT’s.” Anderson smiled at them.
“Just some tea darling. No sugar but a splash of milk would be nice.” Pip nodded. Immediately getting to it.
“Great.”
“I’ll explain later.” Harry smirked. Leading them through the damp tunnel into the shrieking manor. “Where to first?” Blaise asked, undoing one button too many of his dress shirt. He was after prey tonight, preferably a hot bartending witch.
Draco greeted his shakey mother. Promising he’d be ok.
“The horse.”
“She’s a good elf. she just appeared one day and hasn’t left. Impossible to rid of.. trust me I’ve tried.” Draco said, leaning against his friend as he watched the elves through the small door behind the painting. Blaise didn’t seem to mind how touchy feely he was today and if he did.. he wasn’t bringing it up.
Potter laughed loudly, making Draco smirk slightly. “Sure git.”
“You know how you have been helping me feel a lot better? I want to thank you properly.”
“Sod off will you.” Malfoy hissed. Elbowing Blaise. “Keep your Fantasies to yourself thank you. New subject. Pans. How about you and Granger?”
“But you did. Come on.” He pulled Draco into the pub by his arm. Did some more shots before disappearing into the crowd for a second. Coming back he smirked. “Ready? Ron is here. I even made sure of a half decent song. Let’s go.”
It took him a lot of focus. But soon where he once stood tall, he was now close to the ground.
If it would work out, it would, no matter what. They were both strong and strong minded individuals. She’d dried his tears and promised to speak to Pansy to at least figure out If there was a chance.
“I knew you wouldn’t believe me. Which is why I asked Colin for his camera this morning. No one else has seen it. I trust you not to tell anyone else. Hermoine would go to McGonagall and Ron would just laugh. I think it’s a magical creature appearing to me like this or something. It isn’t a patronus because.. Just look at it.”
“You resemble him and what he stands for.”
Harry instead began picking some of the fur off of his clothes before dressing into his own sports gear. Wondering how a cat had gotten into their dorm.
Again Draco just leaned into his touch so easily. Maybe he was drunk and just seeing things that weren’t.
A slow guitar started playing. Draco didn’t recognize it. He wasn’t all to familiar with muggle music. ‘you are… my fire.’
“Oh.. nothing I missed you.” he blurted, not looking at Harry and focusing on the ground. If he kept looking at the floor he wouldn’t fall.
He was seriously regretting his earlier statement about a helmet now, sitting on top of the horse and looking at the ground beneath, shaking slightly.
When his friends and Hermoine… well Hermoine was bit of his friend too now right? Left him, he felt drained again already. Potter hadn’t brought it up again, but did offer to bring him a hot chocolate for desert. He settled for that. Sitting against his headboard as he took the hot drink.
He plopped down. Soon being pulled into a discussion about plants, which got weirder the more they drank. He found himself chuckling. These two were absolutely hideous. But Draco found himself enjoying their company. They of course avoided deeper topics. But that was fine. They could talk about it later. For now it was just nice to not feel judged.
By the time noon rolled around he got into some tight muggle joggers and his favorite under armor turtleneck. Believe it or not. Even Malfoy’s wore muggle clothes when it came to sports.. the wizarding community hadn’t branched much beyond quidditch wear. Besides, muggle trainers were quite nice.. the foam? Felt like walking on clouds and it was a comfort no one was going to take away from him.
“You wouldn’t want me here.” He simply replied, pushing past Potter, who was last to join them. he heard granger say something. But he didn’t hear it. He felt the tension leave the compartment with him. Faint scolding from Granger to probably Weasley as he made his way through the train. For a moment he could feel eyes on him. But he didn’t look back to see whom.
He always remembered his dreams quite vivid. He decided to write this one down. He used to keep a log incase any of his dreams were connected to real world events like they used to when Voldemort was still out there. It was a habit he couldn’t break.
Draco nodded numbly. He took a moment before following the traces of magic leading him to a room. It was on the far right side, possible lake view… perfect.
When he finally let go he looked around. his eyes meeting with Kingsley’s, who gave him a smile. It wasn’t warm.. it was encouraging. He knew what would wait outside the doors of the ministry court. He knew life wouldn’t be easy for the two of them. But he stood behind his decision. He had gifted all the children involved with the war a free pass. Most of them had no choice but to follow their parents... Hogwarts would be busy this year. But it was for the best.
“good enough.” He huffed, making Harry role his eyes.
“Mr. Anderson here will be the head of your house this year. He will keep an eye on you. Manage the points given and taken.” She started. “You will not be playing Quidditch this year. But Mr Anderson has opted to teach you a sport the wizards in Denmark play, as well as an extra class on Nordic magic. Which, might I say, is very fascinating and a nice change. You will be able to take a NEWT for both these subjects.” Her eyes lingered a bit longer on the Slytherins. “I trust Professor Anderson to further explain matters.” With that she turned around, her robes flying after her.
“Fine. Teach me then.” He grumbled, annoyed by the grin on the others face.
Somehow his body managed to create just a tiny bit more of adrenaline. Using the same technique as before he got on the wall. Pulling Harry up once he was secure. Another shot…  Finnigan had let go while getting up. “We’re winning Potter. Lets get down.”
“Better?”
“You go get it Potter. I’m certain he’ll kill me.”
Harry grumbled behind him, squeezing just a little tighter, his breath hitting Draco’s neck and making all the hairs stand right up.
“Hm?”
Once they got out, dead last from the train. Draco had another realization. Thestrals. He had seen them for the past few years. He was just.. he didn’t want to.. most definitely not. Yet he let Pansy drag him to the carriages. “I…I’ve never seen them before..” Pansy uttered. Staring at the skeletal black horses in front of them.
He lost himself in his thoughts. Not noticing the time. “Potter. I can hear you thinking. For the love of merlin stop. You’re going to overheat.”
“I’m trying Potter.” He hissed in reply, trying to ignore the way his stomach flipped. What was happening. Why did Harry have to talk so hushed.
“That’s my little Dray.”
Next chapter will contain more angst and more anxiety. If you have any ideas or tips feel free to comment! they may be moderated but I always read the ones coming in. Thank you for reading and have a lovely day <3
That was decided then, they would all ask their roommates. Should he ask Draco? No one had objected inviting the Slytherins, mostly because Ron was too distracted to catch that part of the discussion. Besides. He did owe they guy an evening of drinking right? Yeah it only made sense. Now he just had to ask it.
“suck on it. Inhale. Puff out.” He did as told. Coughing loudly. It was bloody awful.
24-05-1999, trail day.
“Do not insult my tea Blaise. Final warning.” Draco grinned, sitting up with the necessary complaints about being comfortable.
Then it became time for the dance. All 8th years were asked to take their partner to the dancefloor. Draco flushed when he realized they were leading the ball. He looked at Harry who seemed to realize the same.
Draco before he’d appeared to lose his nerve. Probably because he was worried about
Hermione’s brow furrowed in what might have been confusion at Harry’s tone but smoothed out quickly. “Now that your schedule’s finally cleared up to allow you a social life, I think you should expect an invitation to dinner from Molly.”
him. “I don’t want to bring any of this up with him. I know that might show you how weak I am, but I -”
Harry tugged his wrists, listening to the clink of metal and the growl of displeasure from Draco which the movement predictably provoked. Both noises were so satisfying that he was tempted to do it again. If Harry was wilfully rebellious, he might inspire a spanking. That would be nice. But although his body was perfectly poised for such action, Harry was becoming too impatient to endure the delay that a punishment would result in.
The next insult from Lucius was directed squarely at Draco and so completely
Harry should be taking advantage of that. And he could. Probably. “I need to… now that I’ve started this. It wouldn’t be fair if I disappoint you.”
But Harry supposed that Draco’s fascination shouldn’t be surprising, given his upbringing. It was kind of adorable, but Harry decided not to mention that.

Harry didn’t mention that suspicion. Yet. “Ollivanders isn’t the only wand shop.”
Draco smiled. “I
Draco’s expression displayed his concern. “Are you okay? I feel like I… lost you.”
Draco refocussed on Harry’s face as he replied, “Yes. I have a big vibrator somewhere around here. That’d take the pressure off you.”
Gryffindor mentality was infuriating. “Because it doesn’t
“Of course, I am.”
Draco obliged, snapping his hips faster as Harry dug his heels possessively into Draco’s buttocks. Harder, harder, bloody
“Draco?” Potter prompted, and Draco realised that he might’ve been silent for longer than he’d intended.
Luna didn’t appear to consider it lame though.
He couldn’t think straight. So much to do. So many, many things… most of which Harry didn’t even care about. What was next? Fresh robe, okay. Harry wasn’t feeling steady enough to trust that his magic wouldn’t reduce his current robe to ash instead of simply cleaning the stain. Shakily, he tried to remove the garment, but his hands and arms had begun to tremble and were impeding his progress. When he eventually freed himself from the fabric, it fell from his useless fingers to the floor.
angry. But not with you.”
“You,” Harry whispered. “You’ll decide.”
Draco shrugged. It wasn’t like him not to be verbose, but Harry didn’t get a chance to ask before Luna walked out of the back room carrying a tall, unstable pile of wand boxes which she could hardly see around.

“Umm…” answered Harry, not wanting to inadvertently cause a mass blacklisting if he answered incorrectly.
“Cheeky
context, anyway. Malfoy preferred him to be a neat little whore. Harry chuckled as he pondered that thought, causing Malfoy to quirk a brow at him. “What?”
Harry’s hands were clasped firmly at the small of his back as he pushed his arse into Malfoy’s groin, Harry’s erection bobbing between them as he thrusted. It was really more of a rocking, swivelling grind than a thrusting, but the result was creating a wonderful, almost intolerable drag of Malfoy’s girth on his inner walls.
The building shuddered beneath Harry's feet. Breath stuttering, he still couldn’t obey. Harry wanted to, he
Harry shuffled a little in frustration. He needed
As he started to seriously debate whether he should deal with the hob issue and the possibility of rampant fire or at least the tragedy of burnt sausages, Harry pushed the thought away; it was inconsequential.

“But wh -”

“Yes,” Harry muttered. Averting his gaze, he squirmed within Draco’s hold.
Draco was confident of his upcoming tactics. Potter didn’t appear to be good at recognising subtle hints, so Draco intended to be blatant. He didn’t much care whether the rest of the students realised his intentions, it was not against any Ministry decree to have sex at the age of eighteen, even if it was with their saviour. Shagging a sponsor might be a grey area, but Draco was prepared to take the risk. He trusted Potter’s hero complex to catch him, even if it all went to shit. Faith in Potter was an odd belief, but Draco tried not to analyse the cause.
satisfied, right?”
About an hour later, he was wondering if ‘safer’ had been an apt description. Harry was stuffed full of cock again, and all he’d set out to do was cook dinner.
“I know.” Harry leaned to his right and kissed Draco’s cheek. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”
Although he’d heard Potter’s quiet post-curfew return to the dormitory, Draco hadn’t initiated contact, verbal or otherwise. And Potter hadn’t acknowledged Draco’s existence.
Another mention of

Maybe Draco should stop providing Potter with ammunition to throw back in his face. “I know, but I’m asking anyway.”

“Aw, don’t be embarrassed!” Ron hollered.
“How… you didn’t…” Malfoy seemed to be struggling to speak. “…it's… because you
Struck by the possibility of a mid-morning caffeine-fuelled duel, Harry said, “Maybe Hermione will be a calming influence.”
Ah. Slightly reassured that Malfoy might not be much more experienced than him in these things if he was only reading about it, Harry panted with excitement and nerves. But he did have a word, although he’d never used it. Harry recalled it now.
The faint tut from above him should’ve altered him to the possibility that Malfoy would take action to ensure his compliance. With both horror and delight, he felt the legs shift together beneath him, effectively sandwiching Harry’s cock between the firm muscles of Malfoy’s thighs.
“I don’t… think that’s the best solution for your insomnia.”
“Maybe you should add a cushioning charm to the next bondage accessory you create,” Draco muttered as he healed Harry’s abused bottom lip.
It was an
“Maybe we’re not as afraid to be brutally honest with each other,” Draco suggested. “Less concerned with protecting each other’s delicate sensibilities.”
“I…” he stuttered, “I’ve never…”

“But this is about both of us. I don’t want to think that I’m pressuring you to do anything that
The naiveté wasn’t just mocking. It was

“Who tells you these useless bits of trivia?”
“Let’s go home,” Harry suggested, letting Draco draw him close to Apparate them both.
of good ideas. Harry wondered how many of them might’ve been inspired by his reading material.
A little reassured, but still grappling with a mix of fear and arousal, Harry stroked his index finger around the puckered rim. It fluttered in response to his touch. Feeling encouraged, Harry massaged the rim for a little while before he gently pressed inwards. Slowly… just getting the feel of Draco, experiencing the heat and the clench of muscles around his digit, enticing him to go further. He sank deeper with small explorative thrusts until he was buried to the knuckle and Harry jumped slightly when Draco shoved back in approval.
Potter couldn’t take a hint. It was utterly beyond his capabilities. “Perfectly positive.”
“Was it able to find your prostate? Took me
“Umm… Draco… since you’ve sold the Manor now… how do you feel about me breaking the Anti-Apparation wards? ‘Cos I am butt naked here.”
what. Be direct, Malfoy. If you mean something, then
Harry cast his gaze around the room; examining shelves filled with ornaments, books, and mysterious shiny objects which Harry couldn’t identify. Anywhere except Draco’s eyes. “Ron cut me off before I could tell him. He didn’t want to hear about anything… personal that happened between me and Michael. He told me that he wasn’t going to get involved and it was my responsibility to sort it out if I’d done something wrong.”
Bowing his head again, mouth hanging open as he panted, Harry had the perfect view of Malfoy’s almost-grip, but he wasn’t sure that it would be enough. He didn’t want to let Malfoy down though.
“So… would you?” asked Ron. “Michael only wants a fair chance. I think your recommendation would really help.”
“I… don’t know. It just doesn’t seem right, somehow. Not a laudable occupation.” Harry inhaled, preparing to defend his own choice of new profession as his fingers tightened around the glass still in his grasp, but Draco sighed again before he continued. “There’s nothing… unworthy about it. So, that could possibly be my father’s voice I’m hearing in the back of my head.”
disappoint Malfoy. He would obey and revel in the freedom from making decisions. Nothing else mattered other than pleasing the man in his mouth, and nothing was more pleasing to Harry.
to bring Malfoy to orgasm before his time ran out.
because you did that
“I think that’s your job,” Harry grumbled, nudging the file away from him as he tried to resist the urge to hurl it back where it came from. He should’ve misused his reluctant authority to relocate Malfoy far from his office by now. Preferably to another country.
Glaring at the box, Ron cradled his hand like a wounded child.
In response, Lucius bestowed Harry with a curt nod that reeked of sarcasm. “Or…
‘Iffy’ could mean a lot of things with Luna. Anything from a miniscule, almost undetectable delay with the magic travelling through a wand to accidentally blowing up a shed.
“Yes, it’s in my robe. It might be a bit… coffee-stained.”
So many things to remember. But if Harry repeated them to himself enough, they would hopefully sink in.
“I do…” Harry looked back up at Draco’s face, tried to say it and failed. “You know I do, right?”
“Yes,” Harry admitted. “But I’m going to fuck you anyway.”

Potter’s depression was hardly a startling revelation, but what
So, instead he enquired, “Why were you in the shop though?” Harry doubted that Draco had gone there seeking a pet.
Harry couldn’t take apologies from Molly.
Harry shifted his hips to find the sweet spot of access, but it didn’t go well. After four fumbled attempts within the perhaps

True to his promise, the fucking which Harry was soon subjected to rattled the headboard against the wall as Malfoy battered into Harry’s arse.
“Nothing’s wrong.”
“I’m thinking that I can see Wood coming down the corridor.”
, but it felt like a moment of no return for Draco’s self-preservation. Draco wanted this too much now to allow himself to retreat though.
Harry was sitting by the window again, staring out at the darkness beyond the glass. Although his sleep had been gradually improving, he couldn’t clear his mind enough for rest tonight.
Harry had been ready about half an hour ago.
“See you tomorrow for Sunday dinner, you randy rascals.” Ron winked as he waved and exited with a flourish of red robes.
Malfoy’s arms hugged him tighter. “Stupid people. And stupid
“Winkleprick contacted me today while you were at work.”
cock, I would’ve wanked you off during the process.”
“As if, Potter. I’d love to see you try.” Malfoy’s smirk was reassuring. “Do you want to go home?”
wonderful, really.
Harry’s legs ached, protesting the wideness of the stance which he was forcing them to maintain: thighs stretched as far apart as he could physically manage, soles of his feet planted firmly upon the mattress while lifting and slanting his hips up off the bed to allow access to his hole. Forbidden to wrap his legs around the man impaling him, it was an excruciatingly difficult angle; in fact, Harry had been surprised that it’d worked. But he was not to touch Malfoy; Malfoy would touch

“She probably doesn’t want to give me much of a chance to back out of it. I’ve given her a lot of feeble excuses over the last few years.” Harry was ashamed to admit it.
voice, and it reverberated all the way down Harry’s spine. “Are you going to beg me for it like a good little whore?”
“You didn’t deserve any of that. And it was… you tried so
you.”
“At least I was only eight seconds over. That wasn’t too bad, right? Timekeeping-wise.”
Draco was crouching and examining the contents of the bottom shelf. When Harry entered and stepped around him, Draco stood and turned to face Harry, looking sheepish but excited.
When Ron had left the room, Harry regarded Draco, wondering about the shift in atmosphere surrounding him.
“I’ve been hearing some delicious sounds from you, Potter. I think you like my gift. Are you prepared to be a good whore for me now? You may answer,” he added in response to Harry’s cautious silence.

“I think there’s an owl at the window, Malfoy.”

“No, not the Wizengamot. The other folk. It was the Wizengamot who pressured me into running for election and tried to force me to stay in office, but it was
Malfoy used his fistful of hair to yank Harry’s head backwards, lifting his face from the desk, and resumed thrusting at that same angle. Harry could imagine the satisfied smirk above him as Harry’s control started to shatter. Harry was doomed to failure. Harry was going to come all over the floor and earn himself a much harsher punishment than the one he was currently receiving. The further punishment would probably be worth his while, but he really didn’t want to disobey.
Harry smirked. “Fun experience, isn’t it?”
that.”
“Yes, you do. Or you at least suspect.” Malfoy turned slightly towards Harry, very deliberately resting his knee against Harry’s thigh. “Do you want to give up control to someone else? To
Draco had complied, been
As it hadn’t yet been tried by its intended recipient, Harry was still doubting its efficiency, but Luna had waved off his concerns as unfounded and sent him into the fray of customers for what remained of the day. Settling back into the more familiar area of retail, Harry had tried to take her word for that.
He tried to shut himself up. The attempt didn’t go well. “
“No,” repeated Harry. “I’m not sure. But I’m going to do it anyway. I need to, I think. For me, for us.”
He could feel Malfoy watching him as he knelt for an indeterminable period. It could’ve been a minute, could’ve been ten. High on the rush of obedience,
Harry shrugged as he walked over to stand beside her. “I have no idea.”
Potter waved Draco’s wand again and the curtains parted. Thankfully, the other occupants of the room were still snoring soundly. It apparently took a lot to rouse a pack of slumbering lions.
Harry laughed. “Fine. How about an extensive and… personal servicing?”
“I’m not saying that it’s
Draco might need to help him along. “What do you have to offer?”
“Whisky,” Malfoy called from the lounge, solving the dilemma. Whisky, Harry could do. He selected a bottle of the required beverage and two glasses and walked back to the lounge. This felt a peculiar way to be spending a Monday, but it was a shit Monday, so Harry wouldn’t protest.
Harry didn’t see why that would interest the goblins. “But… the goblins don’t care about Wizarding legal issues. Or the government. They only care about money.”
But maybe Potter was the school’s special Saviour slut, and Draco wasn’t supposed to touch him. The rest of Hogwarts didn’t like to share things with Draco, so this could be no different. But except for the kiss and the enthusiastic frottage, he had witnessed nothing from Potter which would imply promiscuity. Quite the opposite. Potter’s demeanour was not that of a sexually confident person. But maybe Snape was teaching him to be.
The lips which met his though gave him an indication.
Somehow, Harry hung on. He didn’t come, even when Malfoy ground his pelvis into Harry’s arse and came with a long, loud roar that Harry adored.
“So, aren’t you working out your notice, then?”
Harry would show him how confident he could be. Draco was Harry’s
Walking the short distance to the portrait, Harry spoke softly from beside Draco. “Maybe we should put the fire out and silence him again?”
He complied, but the point of contact between penis and skin was tempting him to disobey. Arse on fire, Harry rocked his hips forward one more time and forced himself back into stillness.
As Potter brazenly absorbed himself in his task, something didn’t seem right. Draco couldn’t decide what it was or why he should even

the groan of approval. Encouraged, he did it again. The fingers stroking Harry’s neck clenched momentarily, before sliding higher into Harry’s hair to tease the strands.
was happy with it; Molly and Arthur were keen to tell him that they didn’t care about official responsibilities, only whether he’d done what was best for himself. And they integrated Draco without a hint of past animosity or prejudice. Draco was readily accepted into their home as Harry’s partner and the only awkwardness came when Arthur began to ask Draco what Harry thought were too many personal questions about Draco’s aims and finances. This extent of uncharacteristic nosiness bemused Harry, until Draco whispered to him, “They want to make sure I’m good enough for you.”
“I… know. My father died years ago.” Draco didn’t sound convinced enough for Harry. And Harry wasn’t willing to rush into something which would hurt Draco. “That’s not… him. It’s only a representation… just… another
As Draco released him, Harry allowed himself to be guided to the bench and sat, unsure what to do now that he’d asked for assistance. Draco sat as well; body angled towards Harry as he again lifted Harry’s hands and appeared to be assessing the damage. Harry supposed that it was understandable that Draco was primarily concerned about the state of his hands, but that wasn’t really what Harry needed assistance with.
“More digging is still going on, Harry. But it’s rapidly proving how many times he’s cast
Harry sighed. It would be pointless to deny it. “Exactly what I did. I would’ve wanted to quit.”
happy, if they’re properly taken care of,” Luna replied with a patiently pleasant, lilting tone. “Please cast again, Madam Hogswhistle.” Mumbling a spell, the woman swished and flicked the wand. White and pink sparks appeared from the tip. “It’s perfect,” was Luna’s repeated assessment.
“Everyone? Surely not.”
This was confirmed when Malfoy said, “Wow. Have I mentioned how hot it is when you do things like that?” Harry didn’t think that he had. And Harry had no idea how to reply. “Come on, Potter. We should go before I mess up your nice newly-tidied house with your discarded clothing.” As if Malfoy would ever allow Harry to carelessly scatter his clothes while he disrobed. Well, not within
A line of bafflement creased between Potter’s eyebrows. “And who decides what you’re allowed to have?”
Draco gave him a verbal nudge. “Floo from next door, Weasley. It was
“I declined, of course.”
Ron paused, fidgeted some more, and blew out a long breath.
Malfoy lay face down between Harry’s thighs, dipped his head, and spoke frustratingly close to Harry’s erection. “Hmm, I’ll take you down my throat for a good long while.” Harry could feel the exhalation of each word. “Then I’ll expect to be
, not then.” Despite Draco’s assurances, Harry was still worried. “You look like you’re about to ask me if I’m okay.” Harry had been. “No,” Draco whispered. “I’m not okay. But,” he sighed, “I will be. I
“Would you like to play a game?” Draco asked softly.
to do that. There was a specific spell which Luna had taught him to use when inserting a core and he’d ignored it in favour of an instinctual action.
He forced himself to be still. The handcuffs biting into Harry’s skin were unyielding and heavy, and the thrill of imprisonment urged him to both submit and push his boundaries to their limits. Scarce though those limits were. The position in which he’d been attached to the headboard ensured that his hands remained exactly where they’d been put, and consequently the rest of Harry wasn’t going far either.
Pulling his hips back, returning forwards, repeating… Harry employed all that he’d learned, building it into a steady rhythm, appreciating the sight of strong, lithe muscles and rippling skin as Draco began to writhe beneath him.

to know what it keeps them for. It doesn’t seem designed for viewing memories like a Pensieve bowl, too small.” Draco’s brow was furrowed in concern. “I didn’t… let it do anything,” Harry added. “But I could… see the appeal. It wanted to take… a lot. Too much. It’s not exactly hostile but it seems dangerous, all the same.”
insecure!”
Harry Potter was becoming a stalker. There was really no other appropriate word for it. Everywhere Draco went, there was Potter. In the side-lines, lingering, watching. Standing with his friends, not talking to them, but watching Draco as if he was the most fascinating thing within the vicinity.
it fit.”
Still not looking up at Draco, Harry tried to speak of something he hadn’t told anyone. “A few…” Harry faltered as his throat closed. He coughed and tried again. “A few years ago, not long before the election, I was in a new relationship. But it turned out… badly. They all turned out badly I suppose, but this one was… worse.”
Inconvenient and potentially destructive though it could be, Harry sometimes thought that he could grow to adore his accidental magic.
Draco huffed out a long breath of air. “I… suppose I’m… not. Thank you.”
that care through his actions. There was always a possibility that it wasn’t genuine, but Draco had given him
Oh. It seemed that Malfoy might’ve been giving Harry time to overcome his internal struggle and sink into submission.
After a hesitation that seemed to Harry to last a lifetime, Malfoy slowly said, “I’m… sure you’ll be a… very good boy.” He sounded alarmingly intrigued.
Repeatedly trying to pressurise Potter into talking wasn’t likely to yield any results other than resentment. He wondered if that was the mistake which Potter’s friends had made.
Or it could still be an utter nightmare.
When none of his continued efforts at magically restraining or pacifying or anything
Potter hummed again. “Hmm… if you like. But -”
“Potter, we need to go.” Harry jumped a little as the scrape of a chair against floor accompanied Malfoy’s sudden rising from his seat.
,” Harry repeated. They wouldn’t; surely Ron was proof of that. It wasn’t going to happen. Harry ran a hand through his hair and changed the subject. “What’re you working on?” he asked, gesturing to the drawer Draco had been bent over before.
Potter turned his head to observe Draco instead of the drapes. “Fuck if I know.”
“Yes, I
Ron shrugged in exasperation; he looked more than slightly pissed off himself.

A few moments later, there’d been no response and that confidence started to dwindle. Gaze fixed on the smoke, he tried again.

! I’m
“Yes,” Harry whispered, breathless in his enthusiasm. “I’ll be good, Daddy.”
Wondering what he was doing wrong, Harry looked down. Malfoy had an intent expression which Harry couldn’t interpret. And that look was directed at Harry’s groin. Following Malfoy’s pointed stare, Harry saw that the tip of his bouncing penis was liberally weeping precum. Of course, it fucking was. Harry had been so busy, he hadn’t considered the obvious danger. Not that he could’ve prevented it.
“Potter,” he began, and Potter’s head turned, together with several others. “Can you give me some assistance with a study problem?” The meaning behind the question was obvious and clichéd, but Draco didn’t care, he couldn’t think of anything better.

The blanket regained Potter’s attentions.

Potter nudged at Draco’s shoulder. “Draco, sit up and talk to me.” Trying to regain his equilibrium, Draco didn’t move. Potter’s next nudge was less gentle. “Malfoy.
“We’re going to need to work on this tendency of yours to over-apologise. Especially for stuff that isn’t your fault,” yawned Draco as he enveloped Harry in a hug. “You did a good thing.”
“You’re sure that you want to do this? Because I’m not
As the speed increased, Harry thought Malfoy wouldn’t need much more. The hold around Harry’s wrists strengthened to a bruising grip… a lovely imprisonment as Draco took what he needed in this moment. What Harry wanted to give him. Harry’s legs clung on Malfoy’s moving hips and Harry used them to give himself more leverage to meet each of Malfoys downward thrusts, eager to keep up with the onslaught.
“Yeah,” Potter chirped, “that could work.”
Standing in the doorway, Harry took a deep breath, then whispered, “I need… help.”
, Draco. Only that… that’s what he does. That’s why he approached me today. And what caused… the other thing.” Even after the recent confrontation, Harry still struggled to think about it without shame. An unpleasant notion was brewing for Harry. “And what Ron can’t do, not to my knowledge, is shake off
,” laughed Draco. “Awesome, Potter.” Draco cackled out his words as he continued, “If he’d still been alive, he’d have
“So, can I stop?”
A promise from Potter was worth more than gold. Everyone knew that. Even the dead Dark Lord.
And right now, he needed to remind himself of something else.
Potter rolled to face away from Draco, incidentally bumping Draco’s hip with twin arse cheeks but not making any move to leave the bed. Heartened by Potter’s continued presence, but cautious of speaking again while his tongue was doing its best to assist him in celibacy, Draco stroked what he hoped was a placating palm down Potter’s side and risked only one word.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, his grin growing even wider. “It’s a

he wouldn’t.
Draco smiled smugly as he turned his head to briefly touch his lips to Harry’s.

Draco stood, disturbed that he’d indulged in such an inappropriate display of concern. He was determined to smack Potter out of his personal space and
It took Harry a moment, but he got it. “Gringotts is partially funded by taxes.”
“Why are you in such a rush all of a sudden? You didn’t even want to
“What’s in there?” he asked. “Anything interesting?”
“Is this all you’re worth, Potter?” asked Malfoy, voice breathless with exertion. “Just a hole for me to use?”
“What?”
, Malfoy?”
?” For some reason, Harry wasn’t sure if that was a good or bad description of him.
“You look fucking hot like that,” Malfoy whispered, and Harry suddenly didn’t know which of Draco’s personas he was currently interacting with.
“Hmm, there might be hope for you. Have you been fucked dry before?”
Draco shifted enough to prop himself up on his elbows. “You don’t
Potter rose from his seat and wandered over to where Draco sat. Draco tried to resist the temptation to hurl his heavy book at Potter’s face.
Harry knew that he should already be moving, but still wasn’t sufficiently awake for prompt reactions. Making an attempt at compliance, he shifted his weary body up and onto his knees on the mattress and regarded Malfoy’s position: lying on his back as if he had no intentions of doing anything else. Malfoy’s cock was certainly up and ready to go, the sight helping to fill Harry’s shaft the rest of the way, but Malfoy still didn’t seem to be moving to a more advantageous position to assert his dominance. Or insisting that Harry assume a more subservient one. Not that it usually took much insistence. When Harry was awake, anyway.
“How much more?”
so. Harry paused. Put like that, the difference didn’t seem as clear. “I…” Unsure what his words were going to be, Harry failed again to get the sentence out.
“Nothing is without risk,” Draco shrugged.
until Draco latched his teeth onto Harry’s neck, growled low vibrations against the skin there, and emptied himself into Harry’s arse with a shudder.
“Well, fuck you too.”
. There were too many things he could’ve done differently.
the Ministry. Not for the first time, Harry lamented the frustrating limitations of being in charge. He had a huge force of manpower and magical expertise at his disposal, but he couldn’t use any of it to help himself.
A third tap supported Potter’s theory, so Draco nudged at Potter’s ribcage.
Harry lingered long enough to register her hesitant nod before he strode towards the door.
But humiliation didn’t dampen Harry’s arousal, it was the fuel that intensified it. Rock hard between Malfoy’s thighs, he panted towards the floor as he steeled himself for the next strike.
“No… but sometimes think you’re only waiting for an excuse.”

“I understand how tempting death can be,” Potter whispered, then continued on in a clear volume as if he’d said nothing of relevance, “But things will be better for you… you’ll have a good future.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened. “
But Potter didn’t keep him waiting for long. “I’ve actually been… meaning to say something, Malfoy.”
Harry frowned, trying to decide how to answer. He didn’t want to refuse. It
sorry, Draco! I’ll fix it… I’ll -”
Harry was a ruddy people pleaser.
Beginning to feel somewhat revitalised, Harry couldn’t agree more.
As Harry moved, the sheer size of the vibrator was re-established when it rubbed and prodded his insides. But Harry complied, wincing when he stretched his legs out and lowered his body. His winces turned into a sigh of pleasure as the full length of his cock settled on the mattress beneath him.
“She’s fine,” Harry assured as the pink ball headed towards the open bedroom door. “She’ll go off and hunt for bugs, then come back.”
Harry had absolutely no intention of doing that. But Harry’s letter should effectively destroy Michael’s beloved career before then. If Harry expressed his enthusiasm strongly enough, he might even manage to get Michael the sack entirely. And if he tried

“I’m sure it’s not the weirdest thing that’s happened lately,” shrugged Harry.
“Nah. Not just now, anyway. I’ll probably need to in the morning though, so I can sit down while what’s her name from Italy yatters on about how our import regulations are too stringent.”
“But what happens when you come to your senses, Potter?”
. Worthier than me.”
Draco stopped mid-stride. “Were you having a great time in there? Because it didn’t look like you were.”
Draco’s deliverance came quickly, spurting over his and Harry’s stomachs and chests as Draco tensed and roared above him. Harry still loved that trademark roar. Assertive, strong,
Draco flopped onto his back. “Oh, for… get

“I forced you to use your safe word. That was

There was a small twitch at the edge of Potter’s mouth. Draco didn’t think it was going to form a smile.
“Not yet.”
“I know we haven’t… spoken for a while,” Ron said over Harry’s silence. “And things have been… awkward, but I miss you, Harry.”
. Harry wondered what other adult products George had invented. Maybe Draco would pick out another one from the shop to play with… or a whole range of toys to keep nearby for whenever the urge struck Draco to make use of Harry… but again, not a very calming thought.
“Are you sure you want to tell them?” Draco asked. “I mean, you know I think you should, but I don’t want you to feel pressured into it.”
Harry paused, wanting to somehow prevent the inevitable.

“He wrote,” Harry swallowed. “He wrote… that it’s my fault that he’s in Azkaban.”
were doing.”
“I’ll help you.”
That might explain why Ron hadn’t been deterred by Harry’s obvious incredulities and displays of accidental magic that day. Absorbing all this information, Harry’s guilt spiked. “I’m sorry that I wasn’t there when you needed me,” said Harry.
That was the crux of it. “Yes.”
Malfoy changed his grip to hold the base of the black butt plug flat in his palm so it pointed proudly upwards.
He didn’t know how long Malfoy had let him float in bliss before he stepped back, gradually removing his cock from Harry’s mouth. Harry missed its weight on his tongue.
being a disobedient whore today. But we can discuss your punishment for this infringement at a later time.”
This wasn’t an impossible task though. Harry was most certainly aroused, but he wasn’t being properly buggered or touched, he could calmly ride this out and wait for Draco’s return.
Michael dropped the useless stick of charred wood to the ground and started to back away from Harry.
“Are you hearing me? I didn’t tell him that it had
“Not today.” Harry must have looked concerned, because Draco said, “Next time, if the offer still stands. She

Potter squirmed, aligning himself, and Draco concentrated once again on his breathing. In, out… shouldn’t be difficult, but it was proving to be a challenge. In fact, keeping his hand from Potter’s hip was proving to be too
So, Harry didn’t. “All right.” He offered his left hand. “Gimme some lube,” he requested.
“Yes, I understand. Thank you,” Harry replied softly.
Harry hastened to alter his position as instructed, the added weight of his hands forcing his head to remain down. He heard the clinking of Malfoy’s belt being unbuckled, the rasp of a zipper lowering.
Yes, and Harry had a boggart to get rid of.
, and the question spilled forth. “Who’s paying for my education this year?”
. I thought the Chief Warlock was going to shit himself, you looked that fucking frightening. I’ve never seen anyone back down from an argument so fast.”
Encouraged, Harry rocked forwards and up, back and down, forwards, back, swivelled and hissed in exhilaration as he hit his prostate. Oh,
Harry breathed until his mind began to clear again. And of course, his reaction to the submissive position had a predicable result. During his panic, his cock had softened, but it filled again now as he was enclosed within a safe space.

the Ministry, fuck the delegates, fuck the endless trade agreements and all the rest of it. Fuck his fucking life.
“Do you want to pick up where we left off?” Harry asked, incredulous at how quickly Draco could appear to recover. But appearances weren’t always true.
when he was answering a fucking Floo call.”
Fair enough.
“There’s a lot of stuff going on, Harry. But it’ll get better.”
Luna smiled as she walked over to the low cabinet which Harry was sitting cross-legged in front of, stock book and pencil in hand. Harry liked that she didn’t share the wizarding world’s frequent snobbery regarding quill use.
And other people’s insistence that they couldn’t perceive a lot of the things which Harry could was still somewhat disturbing. He hadn’t noticed them before either, but he hadn’t really been paying
“No,” Harry answered. “Yes. No. I… do, a bit… but I’m… worried.” Harry was worried about questions, worried about judgment, worried about running into Ron or Michael, worried whether Molly and Arthur would accept Draco
“You just said it’d be interesting.”
“You did that on
. Draco tried not to let his excitement show. “But no matter, maybe you’re just a lousy kisser.”
Very true. The base humour was still providing an amusing source of entertainment.
Harry watched him go. He felt oddly numb. Harry had been avoiding any possibility of that confrontation for years. It wouldn’t have even
Yes, Harry had gathered that by now.
“Nope,” Potter answered. “But most folk are at least a bit broken after all that crap.”
“Fall on top of me and your arse will receive more than my cock today.”

them yet.” Harry raised his eyebrows and waited for more. “Preparations were underway to intervene with Corner and Weasley’s state of employment, but you dealt with that fine by yourself. At least, with Corner’s. And I must admit, you used a sneakier and more foolproof plan than I had. That was kind of awesome.”
A little bit of foam spurted out of Harry’s nose as he choked on his cappuccino.
Draco lifted his head far enough to peer down the length of Harry’s body. “No, that’s all Puff,” Draco snorted. “She’s becoming acquainted with your irresistible attributes.”
The importance of completing his education was paling into insignificance in comparison to the daily grind of life at Hogwarts. This venture often seemed pointless; Draco’s future would remain uncertain, even if he successfully graduated top of all his classes. The stigma of being a Malfoy would always be with him. Draco would forever be tainted in the eyes of the public, no matter how he performed this coming year.
“It doesn’t matter.”
“Lean over the table.”
The response from Potter when he spotted the small bottle in Draco’s grip was not positive. Potter wrenched himself off the mattress in a heartbeat, almost tripping on the hems of his lowered clothing as his feet landed on the floor.

as he should be. Watching Lucius with narrowed eyes, Harry wanted to know if this was the only portrait of the man. Being able to visit other paintings was usual, but Harry became interested in how many versions of Lucius himself were in existence. Making both a mental note to ask Draco and a hasty decision, he decided that he didn’t want this one going anywhere else again.
“What can we do?” Harry asked.
“Document or person?”
No light in Potter’s eyes. No reaction at all. Which was odd, considering the effort Potter had been putting into his stalking. Draco tried a different approach. Extending an arm, he laid his hand on Potter’s right shoulder.
Draco descended from the Tower and wandered outside in the cool air for a while before he reluctantly returned to wait at the door to the Great Hall, feeling unaccountably nervous about their first required meeting of the day. Potter’s arrival did nothing to alleviate Draco’s apprehension. The annoyingly cheery grin which usually decorated Potter’s face was conspicuous in its absence, and the cold stare and pinched lips that had replaced it didn’t bode well.
“We’re both warped in our own ways. I suggest that we just go with it and see what happens.”
Harry stared at the memo in his hand. A trap forcing him to continue within his official capacity was one thing, this was something more. Obedience. They intended to turn him into a puppet. Aware of Harry’s wish to resign, they wanted to take no chances that he might make any decisions that they didn’t like, so they were going to
, his mind supplied. “Believe me, I’ve tried.”
“Whose fault is it, Harry?”
“That was
When Potter eventually spoke, it was a distinct anti-climax. “Like I said before, just to talk. I thought that, maybe… but it doesn’t matter.”
As he looked down to make sure he didn’t hurt Draco, Harry growled for angry emphasis as he used his right hand to line up the tip of his throbbing erection with Draco’s prepared hole. The sight of Harry’s glans, so close to penetration, was transfixing. Just a push, and he’d be in… Draco groaned when Harry nudged at his rim, but Harry had more to say before he took that further step. Stage three, right. Coming up
“Okay,” Potter murmured, peeling his body from Draco’s back, hopefully to burrow into the covers a safe distance away. Which couldn’t be very far, considering the narrow width of the bed. Even as he resented the invasion, Draco caught himself angling his neck to appear amenable to future tongue administrations and it occurred to him that sharing his bed with Potter may have unsettling connotations.
When their mouths eventually parted, Harry replied in agreement, “It
Harry relinquished Malfoy’s hand, but remained close and kept his arm where it was as he took in their surroundings. He wondered how often Malfoy came here. What Harry could see looked well maintained, clean, and illuminated with soft light, but the room smelled faintly stale from disuse.
Gasping through his growing arousal, but suddenly not at all in a hurry to win, Harry nuzzled his face into Draco’s neck again. Harry mouthed the skin he found there, loving the contrast of smooth skin and scratchy stubble under his lips and tongue. He nipped the skin at Draco’s throat experimentally and could
Fighting the urge to pull his arm to his chest, hide the Mark, Draco stood carefully, each motion designed to be controlled, non-threatening… something which he’d never imagined that he’d take care to be for Potter’s benefit. Potter appeared to be becoming more conflicted by the second, but there was no point in hiding. Potter would need to accept what Draco was, or this would need to end.
Smiling long after Potter’s muffled groan of completion, Draco eventually closed his eyes and slept.
wanted to. Using his fist to coat his shaft, Harry’s cock and indignation reached new heights. Draco was going to feel this for a
“Get back in bed,” Draco whispered before his throat became too dry for speech, scarcely managing not to tag, ‘please’ to the end of the instruction.
Draco’s head swung in his direction and his eyes widened. It was possible that Harry wasn’t presenting his best self.
Malfoy chuckled knowingly as he added the briefs to the pile. Sadistic bastard. Harry
Granger’s attention from across the table had clearly been caught. Draco imagined that Weasley would eventually catch up once he emerged from his mountain of eggs and bacon.
Thankfully, Harry had been carrying his redundant wand with him less lately. He didn’t need it, but he still would hate to lose it. There wasn’t technically any real harm in what Draco had done, except to Harry’s wardrobe and a handful of coins, but the act was… unusual in its thoughtlessness.
Harry raised his bum again, silently begging Draco to play with him. The toy was so close, but so
“Narcissistic, is the word you’re looking for. And yes, it’s been there a while. Since I was about seven, I think. Bastard loved to admire himself as he wrote his missives of blackmail and other evil deeds.” At least Draco didn’t seem bothered about Harry’s treatment of his family. “What did he say to you?”
“Then, nope. Leave him like that for the night. I’ll decide what to do tomorrow. I might have pleasant dreams of imaginatively torturous places to hang him.”
“Mine isn’t the only position to consider anymore.”
“Where?” asked Ron.
“I could offer you Pensieve memories of all my covert ogling. But I think that might be a bit creepy.”
“Yeah,” he replied, turning it around as he admired the hues. Mostly a rich red, with hints of burnt orange running up the main length… and veins of pink, he decided. “The red is unusual as a main peacock colour. It’s pretty.”
“Yes, I’d love to taste your cock.” In fact, he was longing to beg for it, but begging was not always well received.
“Faster,” Draco growled. “Put more effort into it.”
“I’m trying to decide whether to fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy said from behind him. “Whether you’re worth my cock. Do you think you’ve earned the right to be fucked?”
responsibility, Draco. And anyway, I
Typically not in a rush, Malfoy left him there for a little while to ponder his fate. As he waited, Harry’s face heated further with embarrassment.
“Yes, it is. You need to have more faith in yourself, Harry. Think about it, no hurry. I want some green lemonade now. I’ll go to the bar and get us more refreshments. Do you want a pink sparkly umbrella in your pint of beer?”
“I… burned a letter,” Harry explained, wiggling his painful and stiffening fingers in a typically unsuccessful attempt at visually describing his accidental magic.
“I have so many things to teach you,” Harry teased, pecking a quick kiss to Draco’s lips. He wanted to linger for a better taste, but time was limited.
“Oh, yes. I could really feel the love. And yet he didn’t seem to understand why I left. I hate this house. I’ll be relieved when it’s sold.”
“Why not? We could leave the outer door open. Public indecency, Potter. What a way to end an illustrious Ministerial career. I’m sure the Wizengamot couldn’t justify condoning that kind of behaviour from their esteemed Minister.”

Draco didn’t have a chance to respond before Lucius said, “Ollivanders.”
“I know, you do,” sighed Malfoy. “Go to sleep.”
And the wood covered by his fist was beginning to pulsate within his grip now, the uncovered handle almost vibrating as the tendril descended.
Harry… that was the sensation he was receiving. Wanted Harry closer… wanted, wanted,
“And do you deserve that?”
“Seems as good a time as any.” Draco treated his victim to a genial smile as he slid forward to the edge of his seat. “Up to the dorm?”
“I see what you mean. You

“He was being his usual charming self,” smirked Harry.
Draco had hoped the prospect might prove daunting enough to prompt Potter to flee. Instead, Draco’s stomach did an oddly erratic, somersaulting flip when Potter worried his bottom lip between his teeth, apparently considering the suggestion.
That was what
But Draco was intrigued by the sudden reintroduction of chatty Potter, so he resisted the urge to disturb the flow of conversation with an accusation. “What weird thing?”

like to try it.”
Potter yawned, stretched, and every part of Draco silently hummed in appreciation of supple skin moving against his body.
When they were both spent, Harry released his hold on Draco and flopped onto his back, panting from exertion.
After more letter-staring from Harry, Draco asked, “Are you going to open it?”
“Hmm. Could’ve been worse,” was the verdict.
Harry didn’t care much for the idea of moving right now, but Draco nudged at the side of Harry’s rump in quiet insistence.
“I might be many things, Potter… but I’m not that. This,” he indicated the bottle in his clenched palm, “merely helps things to… slide a little easier. I use it for wanking, mostly.” Draco hoped the admission would help to steady Potter’s nerves.
Gulping, Harry couldn’t seem to get enough air. “They… they’re not

He took a deep breath in. “Thanks, but no.”
Harry’s place to question Malfoy’s instructions. But it also wasn’t Harry’s place to be sitting above him. Harry didn’t
Despite his inner turmoil, Harry laughed. Lucius Malfoy’s portrait would make a lovely inferno. But no, Harry wasn’t going to burn it. Unless Draco wanted him to.
Harry dreaded what the question might be if it was causing Draco to be this nervous. But whatever it was, Malfoy evidently wanted to voice it, so Harry resigned himself to hearing it and said, “I’m learning today about the value of communication. So, ask.” Watching Malfoy’s uncertain expression, Harry hoped he wouldn’t regret that instruction.
Thoughts becoming muddled, Harry shook himself out of it. He couldn’t sit here in indecisive pondering. That wasn’t going to get either of them shagged. And Draco was starting to look worried again. No, Harry couldn’t do…
The sight that greeted Harry when he eventually opened his eyes was a smugly smiling Draco.
Abruptly ceasing his verbal onslaught, Lucius raised a frantically placating hand in front of him. “Wait!” he shouted.
Well, that cleared it right up.
Luna blinked owlishly at him. “Need? I don’t need anything, Harry. But like I said, I do have a question. But I’m being rude. Would you like to ask yours first?”
are you up to?”
Now he was here, Harry only felt slightly like fleeing. He was still anxious, but the easy, flowing nature of the Weasleys’ chatter was like coming home. He supposed that’s what it
hard to force himself to come when imbedded in another man's arse. There had once been an incident when he couldn’t bring himself to even try… he didn’t want to relive the event which had followed that failure. And it was far too fresh in his mind after Lucius’ comments.
“Nothing. And no, I don’t think you’ve mentioned that before,” answered Harry, leaning in for another kiss. Hoping for… well, he wasn’t sure.
“No,” Harry replied, standing to walk over to the bed. By the time he reached Draco, he realised

The silence which followed seemed ominous to Harry until George replied, “Fair enough! No review! But still hurry your arses up, we’re

Potter shrugged. “Everyone I know is here, in Hogwarts.”

about it. But Molly’s words were so similar to what Draco had said, that Harry was overwhelmed by a strange sense of déjà vu. It didn’t change his answer though.
Harry kept his arm locked in place at the higher point, ignoring the strange perception of silent but persuasive urging which was emanating from the open box. A pinpoint of white light appeared within the marble space, growing bigger, brighter, more appealing… and suddenly Harry was inexplicably standing by the window in the bedroom again, looking at his charred hands. The image was so startlingly vivid, and the accompanying emotions which Harry hadn’t had time to properly process yet were so shocking and
“If you want to try with me, I’ll take care of you. No commitment necessary, just to see what you really like.” Malfoy’s hand rested on Harry’s thigh, stroking briefly before it moved away to pick up his glass. “But think about it, there’s no rush. You know where to find me.”

“No. Sometimes. Mostly no. We’re not talking about me right now.”
earned these offers of employment, but Harry was certain that (with the possible exception of the racing broom lady) the proposals had nothing to do with the accursed Harry Potter notoriety.
whore… for you.”
Harry’s erection had previously found a lovely balance between excitement and peaceful expectancy, but as the tremors increased, that equilibrium threatened to tip. The length of his cock filled to capacity again in response to the unusual form of busyness in his arsehole.
Harry didn’t know what to say, so he shrugged.

initially surprised at how well you handled the delicate position of compromise and responsibility. For someone with such a… ferocious temper sometimes, you have endless patience when it’s required.”
Through Draco’s internal reeling, Potter fiddled with the end of his creased tie, looking pitifully unsure. Hardly the reaction of a kissing entrepreneur.
A second after Harry had replied, he recognised with horror what he’d said. The word had escaped his mouth entirely of its own volition.
Frowning, Harry asked, “Worse, how?”
And Malfoy was aware of what else would push them both during such moments.
“Yes, what?”
“You don’t appear to be making the most productive use of your time,” Draco observed.
“We have another boggart?” asked Harry, wondering when he’d started to consider any issues regarding Malfoy Manor as concerning both of them. Because they
had caused Harry to forget it again. The belief in his own lack of worth or importance was so deeply ingrained that sometimes he tended to regress. He doubted that it would ever completely go away.
“Exactly. I’m not ashamed to admit it. Not all of us are you. Although Weasley does assure me that it’s the best.”
. I…” Potter paused and appeared to be debating something.
,” chuckled Luna, effectively dismissing the relevance of the career which Harry had hated anyway. “It’s a
There. Harry had done it. He’d said the name and the world hadn’t ended. As he wrung his trembling hands together, Harry wondered if it would soon. But Harry needed Draco to understand that it was
Malfoy actually looked contrite. “Right. Sorry.”
Harry felt bereft as he felt the hand leave his neck, but he was soon drawn into an embrace that enfolded his arms and torso in warmth, shielding him from some of the draft in the room as Malfoy rested his forehead against Harry's and spoke again. “That job was sucking the life out of you, Harry. Should you have
“The nargles think it’s important. They’ve been getting quite insistent about it today, so I thought I should. It’s about someone you know. Not a friend of yours anymore though, I think.” Harry’s trepidation grew as he recalled being accosted by Ron's question, but quickly eased. This was
An eyebrow was raised, either due to curiosity about the reasons behind Harry's choice or the speed with which Harry had provided it, but Malfoy didn’t comment. Instead, Malfoy was peering at him as if he might be having an internal debate. Harry opted to sit in silence and see what would happen.
Harry took a deep breath. “I do… feel that for you.” Speaking the specific words aloud was still beyond him, so he added, “I really do. But I… don’t ask for help.” Draco nodded. Draco knew that; he’d just
“But why would he need to ask you about that in the middle of the night?”
Draco strolled down the stone stairs which led from the entrance. He continued for a couple of paces on the flat path before pausing to allow Potter to catch up.
“Yes. I don’t know what form… we will take, Potter. I can’t promise that. But yes…

That could’ve gone better, Harry considered. Over the next while, Harry tried to ignore Lucius and concentrate on moving books as per Draco’s system, but he wasn’t as adept at dismissing Lucius as Draco was.

“I’ve plenty of energy left,” Draco assured. “Actually, I’m feeling pretty vigorous… maybe now would be a good time for ramming my cock up your arse. Remember, I mentioned it before?” Potter’s face was a perfect picture of panic. “Oh, relax… I wouldn’t want to ruin your virgin hole just yet.”
“This is pointless,” Draco said. “We can’t make it through most conversations without resorting to arguing or insults, anyway. Is that what you want?”
. Draco hadn’t expected that from Potter. “NEWTS don’t guarantee independence, so don’t taunt me.”
Draco gripped fistfuls of the bedsheet and frantically clenched his leg muscles around Harry’s shoulders as Harry resumed his rhythm from his raised vantage point. But Harry would keep him safe. It was more difficult to maintain the accuracy of his movements, but the steeper angle was advantageous to achieving greater depth and pressure, and that made the extra effort more than worthwhile. And it seemed a popular choice for both of them. Harry bowed his head, shaking hair from his sweaty forehead, his thighs trembling with exertion and self-control.
Harry’s whimper was more a sound of encouragement than fear.
,” Harry announced, not certain that his point would help, but needing to express it.
“Back to the toilet?” offered Draco.
“You asked them not to give a shit about you, so now they don’t? Great friends you have there. Very loyal.”
“Faster. Put your back into it.
Draco’s answer emerged as a snarl. “Some people weren’t given the luxury of choice.”
“Your house.”
Draco had been too exhausted to be disappointed by the lack of Potter’s attentions. He’d readied himself to retire early, and a sense that at least one of them should be responsible had prompted him to cast a drying charm in Potter’s direction before Draco had shut the drapes around his bed and climbed onto the mattress, collapsing into slumber with unexpected ease.
Arms came up to embrace Harry, Draco’s right hand resting on Harry’s back, the left finding the nape of Harry’s neck, fingers stroking in a soothing gesture.
Once Malfoy had evidently deemed that Harry had waited long enough, he enquired in a low voice, “Are you sorry that you disappointed me?”
The only moments when Potter acknowledged Draco’s existence was during their regular meetings. Three times a day, Draco would wait for Potter, and Potter would treat him to a stilted and extraordinarily brief questioning of Draco’s activities, then Potter would turn sharply and march away. It was the barest minimum of cooperation to the requirements of the programme, but Draco was frankly astounded that Potter was still forcing himself to comply when he clearly didn’t want to.
“Just being polite, Potter.”

it, even.
But that didn’t seem right. It hadn’t been unwarranted. There had been a reason, Harry was sure. But Harry shouldn’t be concerned about that.
“Doesn’t it?” Potter sounded genuinely curious. “What else does it mean?”
He’d completed the wand to the best of his abilities and watched as Luna tested it with a huge range of spells, charms, and other safety checks before she proclaimed it to be a resounding success.
“Potter… what you said about death. Are you

Potter was probably right that it didn’t matter. But Draco pushed anyway. “You only wanted to talk to me? Nothing else?” Privately, he would be slightly disappointed to have confirmation that Potter had only wanted conversation after all.
That was now the third time that Ron had stood in a doorway and caught them about to be inappropriately intimate. It was beginning to become a habit. The second time had been in Hermione’s bathroom, after Draco just couldn’t
For long, anyway. Draco soon nudged him again. “Up, Potter. The outside world awaits.”
“Let’s go downstairs,” Harry suggested, lightly tugging on Draco’s hand.
. Harry wouldn’t have Draco thinking that he was too meek to take proper care of him. To give Draco
And with that, Draco diverted his attention to breakfast. He had happily handed the next move to Potter, just to see what he would do with it. At the moment, whatever Potter had planned did not seem to include the imminent removal of his hand from Draco’s body.
Harry felt a sudden sharp smack against his bare arse cheek under the covers, not particularly hard but it emphasised the point.

need to take that step.”
“Yes, I… apparently.” Potter looked unconvinced. “I don’t know what I want though. I used to want to be an Auror, but… no. I’ve had enough of… that.”
Calmer or not, Harry had a schedule to force himself back to. “How long have I been sitting here? Someone’s going to come looking for me soon.”
Wriggling beneath Draco’s weight, Harry commented, “You know, you could’ve just brought us to the bedroom in the first place.”

. And with the correct application of charmed oils, it would never deteriorate.
Raising his head, Harry watched Draco: eyes closed, mouth partially open, panting breaths escaping Draco’s lips the only indication that he was excited. It was if Draco was holding back, just for Harry. Such a beautiful sight. And Harry knew
. I didn’t give him
Special occasions, that could be fine. He was certain Draco’s arse might benefit from further pummelling from time to time. If only to shut that mouth if Draco threatened to replace him with silicone again. Which reminded Harry…
The Slytherins’ glares intensified, fingers twitching menacingly around clenched wands, promising violence towards Draco at the first opportunity. Random Ravenclaws developed the audacity to approach Draco, offering congratulations regarding his quick reflexes. And young Hufflepuffs gazed up at him with round eyes full of fearful awe. Admittedly, the awe wasn’t so bad. But the Gryffindors had begun to smile awkwardly at him in the common room and classes, leaving Draco floundering to determine the best way to respond. A space between Potter and Weasley was always kept open for him at the Gryffindor table, and Potter was the only one who didn’t seem pleased to have Draco sit in it.
Worry for Potter was rising again. Draco’s life since the end of the war had improved at least enough that he’d decided to live just to spite them all. But
Draco waited to find out what the right word for his upcoming doom was.
Malfoy leaned forward to whisper in Harry’s ear, “You’ve been such a good whore today.” The ache in Harry’s cock ramped up a notch. “A tight, filthy hole for me to use.” The hand restraining Harry tightened its grip. “I’m going to shove my fist in there one day, Potter.”
“No,” Harry laughed, “I didn’t. It’s what my aunt would’ve called… this.” He ran his fingers through the plush purple. Still detested everything about it.

. I need to -”
“What was the problem in your latest blossoming relationship?” asked Malfoy, direct as always.
“Sorry,” Harry whispered.
Draco narrowed his eyes as he scrutinised Ron. He appeared to be debating the issue.
. And although Harry understood the mechanics, he had absolutely no idea how to do it. Or how it could possibly still be submissive.
Malfoy’s smile was patient, just on the edge of patronising. The sight both calmed and rankled Harry. “You’ve done the right thing, then.”
As he’d stood at the kitchen counter and diced and chopped, the topic of Harry’s working day had been raised by Draco. The conversation had quickly developed into more wand innuendos, then a discussion of best polishing practices, so Draco had helpfully demonstrated an efficient buffing technique to Harry which took the form of a fantastic but incomplete hand job. Incomplete, because a debate about wood stiffness and proper balancing had arisen and that had somehow led to… this.
Eventually, Draco spoke again. “I… I’m

to trust Draco. Wanted to be a person who could be open and honest without fear of judgment. Harry found himself stuck somewhere in the middle of wanting to move towards Draco to seek comfort and to
Harry used to enjoy doing that with Molly. An expert baker he was not, but the measuring and stirring was always fun. Almost like potions, without the icky ingredients and someone criticising his every move.
“No, that’s fine. Go ahead.”
Harry was not amused in the slightest. He ground his teeth in anger, but not at Ron. Those spells were meant to
On reflection, that might’ve sounded a bit sarcastic.
Draco privately agreed that it was a bizarre situation. “Us being together is a bit strange, I suppose.”
Draco did not look at all appeased but at Harry’s pleading gaze, he halted. His wand remained in his hand though as Harry returned his focus to Michael and attempted to continue where he’d left off.
Watching Malfoy’s appreciative gaze roam over the shelves and books which lined all the walls, floor to ceiling, Harry was pleased that at least something here apparently made Draco happy.
“It’s… Ron. Sensitively insensitive, as usual. But he has other… perks.”
, Potter. Like an obedient bitch.”
Shit. Harry should’ve seen that coming. Or not, in his case. Harry had a feeling that his bloody bravado had earned him a tortuous session. He smiled, and very much hoped so.
Face burning with entirely the wrong kind of humiliation and positive that he’d said far too much, Harry clamped his lips shut. He couldn’t talk anymore. Instead, Harry continued to stare at the rug and questioned how it was conceivable that he was still crying. He waited for Draco to leave in disgust.
“There’d be no helping me with that sort of thing,” Potter chuckled.
“I suppose,” breathed Harry, exhaustion setting in. “Yes. You told me to fix it.”
“We’ll see,” was all that Malfoy replied as his fingers laced with Harry’s.
“I knew they’d cleared you, but I kept thinking about you being returned to that
Harry nodded. “I… do. I just… I need… help remembering that.
“I was being honest,” Potter mumbled. “But then I remembered that you didn’t like… before. Well, I wasn’t sure if you had… and I wanted but… no-one
Unfortunately, Hermione wasn’t done talking. “But enough about that. Ron’s been asking for you,” Hermione said to the top of Harry’s head. “So have the rest of the Weasleys.”
“Okay. I’ll wait ‘til I’ve got you drunk. Then you’ll tell me.”
“Yes, your father remembers me fondly,” said Harry, smile still in place.

“Why not? I can be fantastically dominant.”
In the silence which followed, it was easy to catch the hitches in Potter’s breathing.
There was nothing innocent about Draco’s smirk. “We have the opportunity to cause some issues with Corner’s finances.”
“Don’t be
Trying not to kiss the smile off Potter’s mouth, or perhaps to broaden it, Draco distracted himself with highlighting an obvious fact. “They’ll never really be my friends, you know. They
Draco shouldn’t have agreed to that. Not that he really had, but still… he sighed, annoyed to be mimicking Potter’s woeful response to everything.
Draco was getting restless again. Harry could sense him not buying into any of this and itching to interject; Harry hoped he wouldn’t.

The instant that Harry heard the familiar demand, previously spoken during too many occasions which he would rather forget, his already tenuous confidence shattered.

“No, but you

to be rushing.
“I… I didn’t mean that.”
Harry laughed. Oversimplification was a continuing speciality of Malfoy’s.
“Clearly, it does,” tutted Malfoy as he set his glass in front of him on Harry’s coffee table. “Or you’d be off with Wood to a Quidditch match at the weekend as the happy couple. I know you like him, so something else is wrong.”
“And is… that what it is?” Harry whispered.
A mass of Gryffindor eyes all swivelled in Draco’s direction.
,” Harry emphasised, hoping it was an apt enough substitution, but suspecting that it wasn’t.
“…get on your knees?” Draco supplied as a conclusion to Potter’s abandoned sentence. One more step and Potter was trapped between Draco and the wall.
It was too close to the truth. Draco presented the only defence he could. “I didn’t offer to fuck you.”
Being so much the focus of Michael’s attention was making Harry feel nauseated, but he concentrated on remaining calm and kept listening.
Solving this problem wouldn’t mean that Draco cared; it would merely indicate that he wanted to be comfortable in his surroundings. And actually remain in them. Of course, the notion of ever being completely at ease within this dysfunctional pack was probably expecting too much, but it didn’t mean that Draco couldn’t try.

“Bugger off,” Harry mumbled into his pillow, letting his eyelids fall shut again.
But Draco wasn’t prepared to be ignored when he had a valid complaint. “Did you have something

Potter’s scrawl was inelegant, but clear.
Well, that’d been supremely
Not that Harry had any desire to go anywhere else at this moment. Instead, he was happy to watch as Draco lovingly tended to the beautiful monstrosity which Harry hoped would be very shortly shoved up his arse.
“People know how powerful you are. You’re so powerful that it’s fucking absurd. They might not understand how much strength it takes to submit, but I do. I’ve wanted to dominate you

“No,” Harry snorted, starting to remember that there was more to his life now than moping. The dead of night was often the worst time for bringing that on; silence provided too much time to think. Harry tried to shake it off. “Burning is too final. We could maybe find another place to hang him though.”
do really well there, I think. It’s not often that I can push you to lose control when I’ve said you’re not allowed to. Your willpower is usually uncrackable.” Draco paused long enough to suck in his bottom lip, but he quickly released it. “I… wanted you to come during… that. But you’d asked me to take control of it and I wasn’t… sure if you’d feel comfortable enough if I didn’t set strict rules.”
Harry hadn’t been sure if he should speak. “Yes.”

,” Harry growled. “They’ll be hearing my opinion on that.” The bowl stilled. He was getting better at reining in his accidental magic by expressing himself more honestly before it could escalate. Definitely better.
Looking down, Harry watched Draco’s cock rise and felt his own fill the rest of the way. Harry wanted to do something to make this special, wanted to provide Draco with

It wasn’t that Harry was completely clueless. He understood the concept… mostly. Harry had studied how to treat, carve, shape, and balance the wood, and how to introduce a core without disturbing the magical properties of that wood. He was also knowledgeable(ish) about the best methods to bond, seal and finish a wand so it could, in theory, last a lifetime. Providing someone didn’t do something careless like sit on it the way that a customer had done last week.

Harry had believed that he wasn’t good enough for Michael. Draco believed that Michael wasn’t good enough for Harry. What Harry decided was that Michael wasn’t good enough for

“Exactly. It’s clearly
“It could be.”
After too long spent staring in silence, Potter enquired, “So, do I need to ask what you did last night?”
Yup, that was pretty much it. All Harry could manage was a nod. He focussed his gaze back to his glass. Beside him, Malfoy lapsed into silence. Harry’s lungs felt constricted as he waited to see what Malfoy would do. What he would say to stamp Harry’s self-worth into the ground. It might never recover.
“I… they need me to go to the conference with France now so they can ignore me some more. All the bickering between the gits on our side and theirs is just international

be pleased. I’ll leave it to you to wonder what happens to whores who displease me. Sit down again.”
“I really was.” Harry let himself grin at the memory. “I haven’t enjoyed doing… that before.”
Draco turned, smartly strode out of the open bedroom door, and disappeared.
“And you lash out when you’re upset. So do I.”
Harry turned his head and caught Draco’s grin. “Not the most practical of solutions, but if you want to.” Harry thought Draco was only half joking, and there was no grin as Draco continued. “Although I don’t think it’s you that needs to be going anywhere.”
Harry’s exhausted cock was trying to get back in the game, but at the rate Malfoy was buggering him, it wasn’t going to happen before this was over. And it didn’t
But Harry wasn’t going to do that.

“I needed a minute,” he explained, noting a hopeful glint in Potter’s gaze, but Potter’s body remained in that strange balance between defeated resignation and urgency to leave.

“Rascals?” Draco asked.
“No, not really.”

“You expect what?” Draco sounded shocked. “Me to
Potter shook his head and continued to examine the drapes. “It feels like they’d be satisfied with me doped up, as long as I at least
Nervous, Harry searched Malfoy’s expression for any hint of mocking, but found none. With shaking hands, he unbuckled his belt and undid the fastenings of his trousers, sighing with relief as the pressure eased. Malfoy’s gaze was fixed on Harry’s groin as Harry adjusted his clothing to expose his cock and balls at Malfoy’s eye level.
“Potter,” he growled, “we had an appointment.”
“Potter?” Malfoy asked quietly, confirming Harry’s suspicion. Then silence, probably due to Malfoy taking in the state of the room. “What… happened?”
But that was easier thought than done. Disappointment: yes, that was the verdict of the day. Harry knew he should ignore the shallow judgment of a portrait; a man who’d been cruel in life still polluting the world with his evil, but he was finding it difficult to dismiss when Lucius had successfully cut right to the painful crux of Harry’s guilt.
Harry wasn’t prepared to move on that issue. He opened his mouth to argue, but quickly decided that he didn’t want to. His defences were rising, and the screaming match that this discussion was likely to descend to wasn’t worth it.
Draco really wished that he
Harry frowned. Praise wasn’t often as readily given. And he didn’t know what he’d supposedly excelled in; he hadn’t done anything at all. He’d just knelt here and waited for Malfoy to come back. Hadn’t so much as moved, even when it was becoming urgent that he switch off the… oh.
The confused look on Malfoy’s face indicated that he didn’t quite know what to do with Harry’s new approach to the concept of sexual submission.

Harry went with it, relinquishing Draco’s buttocks as his wrists were grasped, brought up and together, and pushed into the mattress above his head. He spread his legs wide and smiled as Draco settled into the gap. So
Draco’s eyes narrowed.
“Oh, don’t worry, Granger,” Draco reassured with obvious falsity. “Staring into space like a moron is a fine occupation for Potter. It’s perfectly at his level of expertise where productivity is concerned.”
“Do you want to fuck me?” Potter whispered.
Harry hoped it’d be his turn in a minute. It wasn’t always within these roles and being denied could be every bit as fulfilling.
Again, Malfoy didn’t seem to be in a hurry. The waiting was unbearable. Malfoy’s hand wasn’t resting on Harry’s bum, and not being able to see when the smack was coming made it impossible to properly prepare for it.
“Uhuh…” Harry gasped as the thickness pulled outwards and his body settled in its wake. “It’s… big,” he mumbled when the last inch left him. “Like it.”
“Maybe you’d be best to take charge of that, then. Sir,” Harry added, recalling that Draco had liked that form of address.
Malfoy pulled out to the tip before slamming back in; a classic move that Harry expressed his great appreciation for with a moan of delight. After that controlled start, Malfoy abandoned all caution in favour of a rapid pummelling that curled Harry’s toes with its intensity. Malfoy didn’t pause for effect or finesse; he was clearly aiming for sheer force. Exactly what Harry wanted. The pace Malfoy set was brutal. Wood creaked and shuddered as he fucked Harry into the table, just as he’d said he would. And all Harry could do was keep his hands clasped behind him, close his eyes and hang on for dear life.

Draco’s arms tightened around Harry. “You will be.”

“Why not?”

“Because you

“I know,” Harry replied, lifting his gaze back up to his companions. “I’m… working on that… sort of stuff.”
Malfoy spoke softly, as if he was trying to soothe a wild animal before it attacked. “You don't seem in a particularly submissive mindset right now.”
Harry hid his face with his hands. “I don’t want to,” he mumbled into skin.
“No. But I do want to see them. They used to be my family, Draco. Sort of.”
hostile, Harry knew that much. Through the lengthy sorting of everything within the Manor, he’d learned that hostile or dangerously cursed objects displayed a sort of… stuttering of the magic around them. A displacement of air, perhaps. Harry struggled to accurately describe it. Luna declared that displacement to be an aura, but Harry wasn’t buying into the mystical concept of auras. Oddly, both Luna and Draco insisted that
“Off you all go, dears. Have a chat in the living room.”
Ron suddenly looked livid. “You need to stop that shit
Draco couldn’t think of anything particularly helpful. Potter’s fingers had already located the waistband of Draco’s pyjamas, so events appeared to be headed in the right direction.
Harry was sobbing openly by the time he felt Malfoy’s body tense and finally still above him, followed a second later by Malfoy’s reverberating, bellowing growl of release. The fingers released their hold on his hair and Harry’s head thumped softly back to the desk as he panted, trying desperately to regain control.
Knowing how long this kind of two and fro around the edges of a subject could go on with Luna, Harry tried to phrase his next words carefully.
“Come on, Potter. We could toast marshmallows.”
“You don’t have anything to be sorry for, Draco.”
“I do my best. Relocate us to the bedroom, Potter.
“After graduation, the sponsorship programme will extend for one more year,” Potter announced. “With funds for living costs, getting you set up… and all that.” Potter waved his hand in a vague gesture which was evidently meant to convey whatever ‘all that’ consisted of.
Malfoy's head moved away as he implored, “

“I’ll give you the Apparation co-ordinates,” Draco offered helpfully. Although he inwardly squirmed, Harry didn’t object. Harry wasn’t the only one who needed to proceed using their own small steps.
“Then Luna, maybe you should move away. Leave, even.”
that, Draco. I… I…” Even now, when Harry felt that the declaration was essential, he couldn’t spit it out. Harry wanted to tell Draco how much he loved him, but the word got caught in his throat. “…care about you,” Harry finished lamely, feeling like a failure when Draco needed him most.
“How so?” enquired Draco. “Is it finally time for my blow job?”
“It didn’t seem to be doing anything,” said Ron. “Nothing happened.”
Praise given with the faintest hint of patronisation. Now,
“I might’ve… gotten a bit carried away,” mumbled Harry.

“Your briefs may seem like throwaway garments, Potter, but I assure you that careful treatment of the cotton fibres will lengthen their usefulness.”
“I thought Arithmancy would be a bit beyond me. That’s why I skipped it,” Potter babbled on.
Draco locked his gaze ahead. “Are you too delicate to withstand a bit of moisture?”
“Maybe I could write a sign informing them that I’m gay,” Harry mused when Luna entered the back of the shop a little while after Harry’s retreat.

Harry was a fair person; he’d tried to approach Ron several times after that conversation, but Ron was angry. Ron had been hoping that Harry and Michael’s relationship was going to last, and Harry had
Malfoy’s assurance was visibly returning as his cheeks regained their customary paleness.
Harry regained his voice. “I tried to

Harry shook his head. “I don’t think that’s… true.”
Malfoy was unexpectedly quiet as he replied, “Umm, I… wasn't serious.”
adored. “Bend over the bureau. Hands on the wall.” It took mere seconds for Harry to happily comply, palms poised on the wallpaper below the covered frame. “That’s nice,” assessed Malfoy. “What a lovely arse, prime for the taking. I’ll fuck you into my father’s favourite furniture and we’ll let him watch you spurt your cock onto the fine mahogany. I think that vision would stay with him for eternity.”
were a bit busy too for a while there. I was just lucky to be invited into the exciting foray of your political career.”
Harry narrowed his eyes in confusion; it was unmistakably red.
A sinking feeling began to settle in Harry’s stomach. It disturbed him enough that he broke rank and nervously asked, “What do you mean?”
But the truth was, Harry had been so busy with his job that he hadn’t had time to think about much else. Harry had worked from dawn until dusk and beyond, returning home for exhausted sleep. The brief relationships he’d managed to carve out slots in his life for had felt built on lies. In trying to please the men he dated, Harry had quickly given up on having what he really wanted. He’d essentially put his personal concerns on hold, and now he was acknowledging them, the issues he’d ignored were crashing down around him.
“Oh. Sorry.”
Harry nodded. Then tried to form words to eloquently explain his bizarre desire to do this. The best he could come up with was, “Uhuh.”
“I haven’t seen them together as a couple for a long while. And now
Draco’s patience paid off when Potter began to speak again. “Because they need to believe that everything’s fine. They don’t understand why I’m not. But it’s okay, go down, they’re starting to accept you now. That’s a good thing.” Potter’s smile was subdued, but seemingly honest.
There was a brief moment of respite as Draco rose to hands and knees, but Harry hissed when Draco lined up their erections and lowered, weight pinning Harry to the bed once again as Draco began to roll his hips.
The smile on Oliver’s face was causing a heavy, sinking feeling to settle in Harry’s stomach. Publicly known as Harry’s latest attempt at a boyfriend, Harry imagined that Oliver had been welcomed through security with open arms. The people must ensure that their Saviour was happily paired off, after all, even after only three weeks. Harry didn’t want a fourth. And he was certain that he’d informed Oliver of that last night.

“I’m… not sure. Maybe nothing. But I had an… inkling that you wouldn’t want him to succeed any more than I did. And when you agreed to recommend him, I thought I was right.”
Harry loved that sardonic grin. “Interesting to me isn’t always interesting to

Potter blushed. Draco congratulated himself on his wonderful skills of deduction and observation.
Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair as he replied, “Attention to detail. I told you, it’s the

After a lengthy pause, Malfoy drew in a hissing breath. “I did.”
Potter looked back up at Draco, his lips quirking into a small smile. “I was enjoying it. I do want to.” The smile vanished. “But if you… weren’t, then I won’t.”
problem.
Still several feet away, Draco’s gaze roamed over Harry, his father’s ranting portrait, and the bureau, absorbing the current situation.
Harry sighed. Still didn’t move.

“I’d like that.”
“But what would
“But you
Harry gasped with a dizzying spike of guilt that he’d managed to ruin the hope of finding evidence by destroying Michael’s wand.
He might still not get a scone, but Harry felt certain that something interesting would result from an imaginative suggestion. There were lots more things to explore. And Harry might even be brave enough to make a few suggestions of his own. Starting with appropriate usage of that vibrator. Hmm, Harry wondered if George stocked restraints. They hadn't tried that yet. Could be a nice combination.
“Well, I think that things might have a chance of returning to normal if you’re snogging a man in my mum’s pantry.”
unfounded.
. For the Fiendfyre thing.”
Luna smiled, and her question didn’t seem to be forthcoming.
“I’m admitting to nothing,” Malfoy replied. After a few moments of silence, he asked in a voice that sounded tentative, “Are you really complaining?”
“We’re leaving, Potter.
That seemed too dismissive, but Harry didn’t argue for now as Malfoy's face neared his and lips pressed lightly against Harry’s mouth.
It felt like both a few seconds and an eternity before Harry managed to fully comply. Sitting still, full of Malfoy, Harry was beginning to better appreciate the possibilities.

Releasing Harry’s wrists, Draco stroked his fingers briefly down Harry’s cheek. “You
“Hmm…” Draco could almost hear the clunks as Potter’s brain attempted to engage. “I could make it worth your while for me to stay.”
Ron looked questioningly at Harry, but Harry urged him on with a wave. Draco wouldn’t have requested Ron’s absence for no reason.
“Weasley’s withdrawn his application. Proper adult responsibility is clearly beyond him. So, now it’s that creepy partner of his and two other Aurors still in the running.”
Draco’s shift onto his back successfully dislodged bodily contact with Potter, who was forced to retreat essential inches to prevent himself being knocked over the edge of the bed by Draco’s elbow.
You know that’s not what I meant,” Harry laughed softly. “Work is
“Yes, it was,” Draco grinned.
As Draco tried to absorb the information and Potter’s current behaviour, the reason became suddenly clear. Draco couldn’t contain his gasp of disbelief.

Aware that the floor beneath him was beginning to tremble, Harry took a moment to breathe.
, then he wouldn’t have needed to hurt Ron.”
As Draco dutifully answered today’s questions, he hoped they would be brief so he could shortly progress to the kitchens for breakfast.
. And Draco didn’t want Harry to do anything which he wasn’t comfortable with.
Draco sighed. “That didn’t help to clarify your question, Harry.”
“Anger…
There was no answer Harry could offer that would satisfy Draco on that count, so he didn’t reply. He laid his head on Draco’s nearby shoulder for some brief respite before he straightened and brought his attention back to the letter.
Harry didn’t bother. But… “what do you mean, ‘peculiar’?”
Draco’s eyes were still narrowed as he replied, “You’re a very strange person sometimes.”
The room became extremely quiet as they both regarded the covered frame. But Harry had a question. He turned to face Draco.
“I think it’s a very important point. If you don’t want to run the world, then don’t.”
Gasping from exertion and elation, Harry slowly withdrew and lowered them both back to the mattress. Ensuring first that Draco looked comfortable, Harry tucked himself into Draco’s chest, tangling their legs together as his head rose and fell with each of Draco’s panting breaths.
“I’m waiting for an answer.”
could be fun.
“I hear that you scared the shit out of the Chief Warlock last week, Harry,” said Ron.
“What?”
The upright stance of Draco’s penis seemed keen to do otherwise. And Harry didn’t want to fail it. Or the rest of the man it was attached to. Due to his conflict, Harry’s own cock had lost its rampant eagerness but amazingly to Harry, it was far from down.

the job.”

“It’s not red, Harry.”
And although Harry didn’t want to play at being a Dark Wizard, he could get on board with the handcuffs. But then
“I’m going to be extraordinarily assertive in my passivity.”
"But -”
“I suppose not. But anyone who’d want to send me a letter.”
“Don’t you dare,” hissed Harry.
, right?”
“Nothing all that nice. He made some… judgmental comments that I didn’t welcome.” Harry was reluctant to repeat them.
The downwards thrusts from Draco increased in both speed and force, it seemed that Draco wasn’t taking his time anymore. All Harry could do was brutally bite his lip, hang on, and pray for deliverance.
“What

Draco was further disheartened by Granger’s emphatic nod of support.

“You have a better idea?” Draco asked.
“I didn’t see those,” said Draco. “But I suppose they were meant to be confidential. Not that it would’ve stopped… wait.
Harry sighed. He was doing a lot of that today. “I dunno… attitudes, the way people expect me to be. What they expect me to do. What they think I should want.”
Harry wished he could get rid of that for Draco. “Maybe. Lucius probably went on about that sort of thing a lot, I imagine.”
Draco’s wrists still within his grip, Harry raised himself to where he gauged the head of Draco’s cock would be. Without the security of Draco’s usual guiding hands or growled instructions, this endeavour felt much more daunting. Harry hoped he wasn't about to embarrass himself.

to do that? I mean, I don’t think we’ve properly discussed whether you like to bottom. ‘Cos it wasn’t, you know… an issue.”
Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist, locked his ankles together, and felt the tip of Draco’s erection nudge at his anus. But no further action followed. And Draco was beginning to get that lost expression again. This
to invite him.
What Harry needed was to burrow underground and hide. He didn’t think the centre of the Earth would be far enough.
“Don’t you
Harry was surprised that he wasn’t in trouble for dirtying Malfoy’s immaculate clothes. Uncertain how to behave now that they seemed to be reclaiming their usual roles, he aimed for light humour. “What are you, my keeper?” Harry laughed softly, but he allowed Malfoy to cast.
Potter didn’t provide an answer. Not that it had really been a question. Stepping back, Draco allowed Potter space to make his escape.
“I think he’d been waiting for me to come home. And today had to be the day that I walked, instead of Apparating straight in.”
Draco frowned as he stepped out of his trousers. “Don’t call me Master. Never that.”
Draco’s new existence was relentless. Every morning, he would escape the dormitory early, but ensure he was in position to be greeted at the entrance of the Great Hall, where Potter’s beaming smile would be stunning enough to brighten the lives of the other students gathered in the foyer.
Draco looked impressed. After all, Ron had just condensed everything Draco had been telling Harry for a while. But Harry was still not happy about the prospect of pressing charges.
” Harry’s attention was
Harry probably shouldn’t find it so adorable that Draco had a habit of deliberately forgetting the names of people he didn’t like.
“Yes. You’ll need to make it worth my while to tolerate your company.”
Feeling hopeful, Harry leaned forward in his seat to seek a comforting kiss, gratified when Malfoy’s mouth opened slightly to receive him. Harry was just settling in, deepening their contact and enjoying the flexible length of Draco’s tongue against his own when he heard a discouragingly familiar chirping from directly above his head. Knowing from experience that memos only became more insistent if he tried to ignore them, he pulled back reluctantly from Draco and looked up. As expected, a paper bird had popped into existence and now that he’d acknowledged it, fluttered down gracefully into his lap. Sighing, he plucked it up and unfolded it, apprehensive about the possible contents. But nevertheless, he began to read:
Rocking himself against Draco’s erection, initiating the same slide which Draco had treated them both to earlier, Harry took cautious charge of a kiss. That wasn't especially new but what he was about to attempt next would be.

Harry squirmed within the grip, enjoying the restraint. “To see what we can eat for dinner? You said you were hungry.”
Harry most certainly fucking
But this continuous background of brooding Potter was affecting Draco’s personal sense of wellbeing and endangering his sponsorship, therefore it was reasonable to take action.
Draco nodded and reached out a hand for Harry’s. “I won’t.” Harry nodded back but wasn’t steady enough yet to take hold of Draco’s hand. Draco raised it to Harry’s shoulder instead, and Harry allowed him to lightly knead the muscles there. “What’re you going to do?” asked Draco.
“Draco?” Harry asked, feeling concerned.
… then things would’ve been fine.
, Harry!” Draco shouted, but there was no indication of protest in the tone.
Heart pounding, Harry took a deep breath and voiced his refusal as clearly as he possibly could.
But Draco’s life was screwed anyway. He decided to rescue Potter from his descent back into awkwardness. And hopefully please his own disappointed cock in the process.
“Something very important,” Draco said as he rose. It amused him greatly when Potter hauled himself to his feet as well.

Almost there, almost balanced, almost steady, almost resting.
“Well, you do have the full and hefty might of all the Ministry departments to use at your whim, but that’s probably not going to help you with this problem.” Malfoy sat back, placed the re-rolled contract on the desk and seemed to consider the issue. “Hmm, I’m failing to come up with a brilliant plan at the moment. But I’ll think of something.”
“We can make it better. You just need to -”
Aware of where their hands had just been, Harry cast a cleaning charm over them both. Draco shivered in delight at the sensation of Harry’s wandless magic. “Not helping my cock to go down, Potter.”
“So. Enough shopping for today?” Draco asked as he lightly tugged Harry’s hand.
