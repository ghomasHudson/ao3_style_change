“If you want to have this damn cat, at least keep his killer instinct inside your home.”  Said, turning on his back, and putting one leg out again. Realizing he was being looked at, he stopped. “What?”
Draco blinked slowly. With his left hand, he covered his face. The first rays of the sun appeared on the horizon, piercing his eyes with the sudden light. Strangely, the grass was too soft this morning ...
“Why are you here?” Harry asked again.
"It's okay!" He shouted back. One of the branches of the whipping willow lashed inches from his neck, one false step, and the Saint Potter's head would fly off "Where is it ... Here!"
>They prefer to consume the blood of young and/or healthy people, which have a higher nutritional value and can keep them for longer
That nightmare would be over sooner.
"Can I try?"
"To help?"
"What episode of the Addams Family did you get this guy from?"
"I'm fine, Ron. Really."
No one was worth a painful ordeal like that. A slow and painful degeneration to the certain death by drowning.
Harry looked away. Inside the box, there were little bite marks on the strawberry he had left. He shook his head, satisfied and proud of himself. He went back to the fridge, this time picking up a jar of small blackberries - which he had gotten from Mrs. Weasley, because without Hermione around to force him, he didn't have the slightest willpower to try to eat healthily - and headed off to the room. The bat had climbed his arm and rested on his shoulder absently.
From the kitchen came the sound of the cat's growl.
And Harry Potter, in some miraculous way, would survive as usual, marry the female Weasley and end happily ever after. That thought filled him with melancholy, but deep down, Harry Potter's happiness was his happiness and that was enough.
The brunette knocked on the door.
"No!"
Carefully he moved the little creature with his thumb. With a start, he realized it was a bat. Do bats have hearts? Shit Potter. Of course, they do! Harry took the little black ball close to his ear to hear his small breath. At some point in the meantime, he remembered that he shouldn't take a bat in his hands. And also that he had no gloves. And had done it already, so damn it.
Another meow, with no intention of leaving the spot. Harry pushed the cat lightly, dragging him across the table. It was the same sheet of notepad he used to write notes, where it was possible to read in round, elaborate handwriting.
"Hmm ..." Ron seemed very confused, raising his hand in the air over the animal. "Up!"
"... No, no ... None of this bullshit of having the right place to start. I think everyone can choose their own strategy." Ginny interjected.
Draco looked a little upset for a moment, so Harry thought it best to divert the subject.
Draco smiled at him, running his tongue along the line of his jaw. Harry placed a peck on the tip of his nose. Feeling a tug on the opposite side, the brunette let the chain run loose between his fingers, allowing the blonde to walk away. Harry took a deep breath as he felt the extra weight leave his body and a damp breath in front of his lower parts.
Stupid Potter.
"I asked if you are free today."
Draco looked down to find the boyfriend on all fours on the bed, his butt raised in his direction. He didn't need the slight pull on the chain in incentive.
Draco drew his wand, taking a step forward and Harry laughed, stepping back two.
But, it was too late.
Draco couldn't let go of that feeling.
After removing Crookshanks from his face, he realized it was just raining.
“Why not?”
Outside, Harry heard a trunk get closed, and quickly, other people appeared at his door, talking non-stop, preventing him from interrupting. Ron and Dean came in carrying a crate of beer, which they placed on the table, followed by Seamus who carried a cardboard box, probably with snacks inside. Neville came in last and was the only one to stop politely to greet him. Until his best friend turned, walking towards the room and placed a hand on his shoulder.
"What? To growl?
"So, I told her I was here and she is not coming back."
The brunette allowed the orange cat to surround his legs, the little brushtail raised in the air.
The brunette stood on tiptoe to brush the older man's lips with his own, pulling his lower lip with his teeth as he pulled away. Draco's hands went to his hips, but in a spasm of consciousness, he stepped away, taking a step back. Harry took a step forward.
Harry tapped the side of the taxi. "You can keep the change Amir."  and repeated, pulling the man by the hand towards the house, with the blue ribbon in the other hand. "And have a good day."
The blonde smiled, standing on the opposite end to Ginny, bending down to place his hand on the plastic, however, without crouching like Luna. Harry realized, indignant with himself, that his friends might be right and he might be staring a little. But of course, not like a scary stalker. Only by very pertinent and scientific evaluations. For example, right now he was thinking that tight pants like that should be a crime.
"Get the fuck out of my house!" Harry threatened, brandishing his broom.
"Hey."
Everyone seemed to find the explanation plausible, staring at Ronald to see his reaction. The redhead just nodded, extending his hand for a greeting: a firm handshake, to show dominance, which didn't quite work out, feeling his fingers almost being crushed back, even though the blond didn't seem to be making the least effort.
For intense seconds, they faced each other in silence and mutual distrust.
“Come on Harry. He's flirting back. Go and talk to him.”
“Flavor?”
The blond man smiled vengefully, dropping Luna's hand and walking towards him. His breath froze and all his body hair stood up when he felt an arm around his waist.
Harry Potter wrote the final period, satisfied.
"Sorry for kissing you yesterday. I shouldn't have done that. " Harry felt his heart sink a little "I know you feel uncomfortable with me and I don't want it to look like I want to force my presence to take advantage of you or attack you or your friends. That was never my intention. I really want to protect you, because I think you are a person worth protecting."
"You can call me Harry, Amir."
Harry looked back. Small white feathers covered the bed. Some floated in the air, he laughed.
"Was it veritaserum? " Asked his ex-girlfriend, beating the hand of her brother who was trying to steal fries from her plate. Things between him and Ginny had gotten a little weird after the war, but they had broken up on good terms.
Teddy didn't know what his uncles were talking about. He took a cookie from his pocket and, looking up at the dark sky, took a bite. The moon rose slowly over the horizon. Something about that glow was somehow comforting and familiar. Teddy smiled.
"Harry Potter!"
"Don't call me that ..." Draco looked away,  hiding from the green eyes.
“Hm… Okay? I guess? Why would I kill your friends?”
"Oi. "Ronald greeted with his mouth full and his hand tucked into a brown paper bag. "The cat stole it from you?" He said, pointing to the candies in his hand.
“My family has a tradition regarding life debts. I cannot be indebted to you. I have to compensate you.”
Moving at a fast pace, he ran away, trying as hard as he could to reduce the noises he made as he went and mislead whatever this was, but the smell continued to follow him. Until he reached a glade. In a quick movement, he pulled out his wand, looking around.
"She was, hmm…. Hunting you?"
At some point, everyone's socks were gone, Ronald's freckled chest was taking a breath and Simas had decided to make the game a booze game and make everyone's balance a lot worse. Harry had decided not to participate. The alcohol made his mind a little foggy and he couldn't afford to be even minimally out of his senses and reflexes when his life and everyone else's was in danger. "Couldn't" in the past, because he quickly changed his mind when it was the blond's turn to put one foot in the red and lose his shirt and Harry realized that he couldn't look away from the thin line of hair that came down from the navel and got lost where dark pants started and he was forced to turn a shot to pay attention to something else.
"How much do you know?"
People at the tables around him turned to face him. The Gryffindors around - Hermione, Ron, Neville, Ginny, Dean, and Seamus - shrugged. In fact, it wasn't even the strangest thing Harry had done in the past few weeks. Perhaps, the war affects people in different ways. Harry cringed in his seat.
“Good afternoon. Can I take your order?” He said, narrowing his eyes, watching the other's movements carefully, as if he expected him to jump on his neck at any given moment.
Harry accompanied her " Yeah, I don't think so."
"I don't know what you're talking about, Potter."
Neville made room on the couch, allowing the two of them to sit between him and Ginny. Luna put her feet, sporting a sock of each color and pattern, on the brunette's lap. In return, the blonde put his arm around his shoulders, without even looking in his direction. Harry couldn't believe how the vampire could act so naturally in that situation and had no idea how to get out of it. In his head, a new mantra was muttered: holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit…
“No, it's okay” Dean interrupted. “Seamus and I will just watch you embarrass yourselves.”
"That's it. What's going on Draco?"
"Teddy, don't be scared, okay? Uncle Draco is ..."
Harry Potter would never have imagined that he would spend his Sunday afternoon watching television and eating cold pizza, while feeding a small bat on his shoulder, under the inquisitive look of Hermione's cat.
Harry had already got out of the car and, standing by the door, handed him the money.
He pressed to pull Draco by the neck toward him, brushing his lips in a soft kiss. He could feel the pressure of the blond's nails lightly pierce the skin on his waist. Both their tongues rubbed. Harry brushed the Slytherin's teeth with his own, noting that the tips were slightly sharp. Draco's hardened penis throbbed against his thigh, while his was pressed between Draco's belly and his own body, marking him with small points of pre-cum. The blonde's hand turned his face hard, pushing him against the mattress, exposing his neck and leaving a hot, wet trail of kisses, scraping his skin with his teeth.
Stupid Potter.
"You are very lucky, you know?" Continued the man, who had a strong Indian accent. "My son also has a dog, not like you own, the one with a crushed face you know? That looks like a lil bread loaf? And he couldn't even teach Thor ... Thor is the dog's name. He couldn't even teach Thor to pee in the right place, imagine winning a dog contest ..."
“That's what we'll see.” Ginny lifted her girlfriend's glass of juice (from which she hadn't dared to take another sip) in defiance.
“It was not a joke.”
"Are you sure? Do you want me to call someone?"
At the moment, Harry didn't try to reason whether that was a double-meaning comment or not. For the first time, full of curiosity, he took the courage to run his hand over the side of the vampire's face, outlining his mouth with his thumb. Everything was soft but unnaturally cold. Weird. He wanted to kiss that again.
Luckily, Narcissa didn't have the same taste for decoration as her family and soon started to redecorate the place, which was great, as Harry had none. The shrunken elf heads and trolley-umbrella quickly went to waste. The worn carpets and wallpaper were changed, even the curtains covering Walburga's portrait were changed (and happily bewitched so that she could no longer open them on her own). Harry made a point of covering the tapestry and received no objection.
Teddy gaped as he was carried inside.
Harry Potter had a restless day.
"Another vampire?"
“Draco. And no. I just like the warmth of the cup.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Yeah, there's that. Not to mention that they lost the Malfoy Manor ..."
Meow.
The end was near.
He slid to the floor, tired.
To Harry's surprise, in a few seconds, the boy was clinging to the wolf's neck, his hair held up by licks in a wet mohawk.
"Bloody Hell! Can you see what he's eating, from here, with these glasses?!"
Draco looked at him angrily. Harry saw flashes of red appear and disappear in his irises as if he couldn't control them, and at that moment he understood that Draco could also hear - or smell, I don't know - the blood flow rising in his throat and painting his face. And Harry laughed out loud. The others laughed too, but probably for other reasons. Deep down, he felt that this could be the first time he was in real danger, but it was also the first time that he couldn't care less. Maybe he was too drunk, who knows? It was he who was in control and it was he who was making the blonde uncomfortable and unable to do anything about it. Both faced each other in defiance for what seemed like an eternity, until Luna slipped, knocking them all over.
"Sure."
Teddy looked over his shoulder, watching the door suspiciously. He definitely didn't want to share his secretive secret with the grumpy elf who didn't like him. "Ok ..." He agreed resignedly.
*Draco doesn't accept the dating request, either because he thinks it was on impulse or because he still doesn't trust his new friend's intentions. Harry spends the next two months ignoring this fact and acting as if he has accepted.
After a few hours of silent surveillance, he and the cat finally managed to fall asleep (Crookshanks long before him).
The Slytherin didn't answer. Harry felt his arm embrace him from behind. The brunette smiled, capturing the blond man's hand to mark it with a kiss. He heard him murmur something incomprehensible.
Hermione squinted. "Obviously, I know that he is not a vampire Harry. I'm kidding.  It's Ronald who calls him that in his complaints." She laughed. "But I must admit that they are quite exaggerated, so, as you have not told me anything, I believe that you owe me your version of the facts."
"I thought I was going to lose control."
His body shuddered when the blonde's tongue surrounded his entrance. Small low moans left his lips as the Slytherin intensified his movements. The Room of Requirement was too hot. Sweat was running down his chest. Everything was starting to be too much to bear.
Not even ten minutes later, someone knocked lightly on the door. Had he given the wrong value to the delivery guy? Or had he exchanged the pizzas? Why Harry just didn't remember what flavor he asked for, nor did he care, because pizza was pizza and any flavor was good.
“Hey, Harry!” Neville, his co-worker, nudged him with his elbow “Take a look at the guy who just entered.”
"This is not Twilight! I don't fucking know how to turn cars!"
"And maybe he likes you?"
Such was his surprise when Uncle Harry started to hang on the railing.
Potter smiled. "Okay. On one condition."
>In human form, food has no taste (although different blood types have different tastes and smells)
Luna bent down beside the red row, on the edge of one side of the plastic, removed the remaining sock and rested her hand on one of the circles in the middle
"That's what I said."
"Ah, Harry!"
He lifted the brunette's chin, turning his face to the side and sticking his own in the curve of the man's exposed neck, breathing heavily against his skin. Harry felt his heartbeat accelerate more and more. The man's tongue ran over his neck, the tips of his fangs scraping slightly as they passed over the forming trail of saliva. Harry moaned hoarsely. Draco pressed him to the floor, growling.
Harry Potter could be many things. Perhaps he was not the best student in Astrology. Much less in Potions. And he had definitely not been intellectually present in any History of Magic class for the past eight years.
"Hey."
"Ronald! Stop interrupting me! Anyway, Harry, do you understand that…" Hermione sighed. "You didn't hear anything I just said, did you?"
"You said it doesn't count if I do it on purpose, so it doesn't count either if it's your fault."
Harry wanted to.
"If I let you “help”, will you stop following me? It's starting to get creepy."
And made a quick gesture, passing the index finger around the neck.
Behind the car, a girl about his age with short black hair was sprawling.
"Of course not. I am a leprechaun". Said the man, seriously. Harry was silent. "Of course I'm a vampire. Leprechauns don't even exist."
"And does that count as a rescue?"
"What is it?"
"What?"
In the next few days, Draco would try even harder to outwit Harry Potter. But if there was one thing those damned Gryffindors knew -in addition to being crude, ignorant, and irritating- it was being insistent.
>Clans and / or family groups are usually led by a major vampire, who created all the others or, in the event of his death, the one who is the oldest and therefore most powerful (although most groups tend to disband with the death of the original leader). Narcissa is the major vampire of Draco's clan and he sees her, together with her partner, as parent figures, although that is not a rule.
That night, in his bed, Harry laid down in confusion.
"But, Mione..."
"I won't be staying today." Draco interrupted.
"Have you gone mad?!"
"So ... What's going on down there? "Draco blushed, looking away making Harry laugh. "Do you feel horny when I piss you off?"
"It's the address they gave me." Harry shrugged.
"OK. Everyone can apologize and go back to their places that have not yet caught fire and continue to study."
"So what?"
“Where do you keep your blender?”
"No marks." He murmured, breathing out through his nose.
He wouldn't show up at work that day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The cup is already cold and I'm not going to drink it.”
Hermione closed the door.
"I KNOW he thinks he owes me something. But then he keeps doing these things that ... Oh, I don't know."

Monty was right, Aarti helped to get him started in his new life. She was exactly what he needed at the time. Intensely focused and outspoken, just a little bit scary; if she had ever claimed she killed a man, he would have believed her. She had little patience for his superficial tantrums and moods, but all the patience in the world to talk him through his darkest moments. She would have made an incredible partner to raise kids with, even if they hadn’t been so sure about marriage.
He would have preferred his beloved kitchen in tact and his special batch of chocolate-coated fudge in Draco's mouth to shut him up, but he thought having those long fingers in his hair was some consolation.
, James pointed out.
"Is he around? J-James?"
How many survived? Potter had a talent for beating the odds, but how many others got away that night?
"Sh-shh-shhhh…" Potter's voice is soft and urgent. Draco throws his hand off, glaring hotly, but Potter doesn't spare him a glance. He gestures around a copse of trees and Draco goes rigid.
He tastes chocolate and salt and the remnants of strawberry syrup, and a fresh wave of heat tears through the room. Perhaps Potter's right—perhaps the old crone is trying to cook them—or perhaps it's just Draco's libido. Well, there's one way to fix that.
Pansy grins like a cheshire cat.
“My relatives never liked me. It’s not surprising...they didn’t like my mum marrying my dad, didn’t approve of that sort of thing. Thought she should
"It's Potter's!"
Draco gave one of his little smirks and moved in to grasp both of his hands. James was always amazed by how smoothly Draco could transition a position like that into a hug - how did that work? How could he go from holding both hands to holding an armful of man in the span of a second? It was smooth as hell. Nothing like the grabby sort of touches he'd shared with Monty -
(See the end of the chapter for
the magic, just as one cooks in the spices.
"I don't want your hopes to be dashed if this doesn't turn out, Remus," she said, her voice oddly gentle against the firm line of her mouth as she followed him down the street toward Charming Chocolates. It was darker now, the street lights were on and the crowd was just beginning to thin. "And not a word of this to his friends until we're certain."
“Oh! Well, I suppose Belrose, then.”
Monty signed as James unlocked the front door for the day.
" - and a nicely equipped kitchen, though by no means at its full potential. Do you cook, ah, Haz?" Malfoy stumbled over his name and Harry smiled indulgently. Was it a pureblood thing, this battle to call him Haz instead of Blue? Inwardly, he both cringed and squirmed with glee at the thought of Malfoy discovering his more-and-also-less-strange client was Harry Potter.
, James said, trying in vain to be subtle. He could see Fred and George clearly in his mind, the both of them trading off in their speech, always in perfect sync. He could see the funeral, somewhere in the far corners of his mind. Anytime Arty did something particularly stupid or Alec nearly electrocuted himself, James remembered George being left without his Fred.
Monty owed a new level of his excruciatingly slow-built relationship with James to that childhood trauma. He nearly adopted the tomcat himself.
All the easy back-and-forth they had enjoyed the past six weeks seemed to evaporate in a single hour; James wasn't sure how to talk to Malfoy anymore. Not because he was sick, but because he was hurt. James had hurt him.
“Even Azkaban has windows, Haz,” said Sirius. The pet name struck a chord in his chest, like a note from a phoenix song, but he refused to be swayed.
“Potter! Hands!”
said McGonagall.
"God…" Potter moans. "So good."
The problem he faced now was getting Monty to come back into the bedroom. It seemed that James couldn't get any space from him except for the one bit of space he wanted to close, especially now that the boys were back.
"Box seats, Blaise."
His eyes were crossing as he tried to enter numbers into his accounting book for the day. He'd added new columns for the baked inventory and he hadn't yet gotten the hang of tracking those transactions. The numbers swirled on the page and he slammed the book closed. Sleep was tugging at him but his heart was racing. He couldn't count down the drawer, he wasn't hungry, he didn't want to see Monty. His Inner Dad Voice was telling him he was just cranky, telling him to stop whinging and take a nap, but his Inner Child Voice wanted to throw a spectacular tantrum.
Monty nodded in Alec's direction, who seemed to be pretending he couldn't hear the conversation.
A long pause before Monty continued, more hesitantly:
from the center refrigerator. Draco dogs his heels the whole time. Harry slams the door, whirls around, and throws his paper bag and himself at the nearest table. It’s the sort of table that can split at the center to fold up; a caddy of napkins, straws, and salt & pepper shakers sits on the centerline gap and Harry drags it over. Draco joins him, perching delicately on the round edge of the table.
She disappeared through the back door of the kitchen, leaving it ajar. James waited a moment as the frigid air cut through the heat of the stove behind him. He felt like an idiot, standing there in the kitchen with his wand out and his finger bleeding, before he finally gave up on her mission and dug around for a flannel to wrap his finger. He could still hear Rachel rummaging through the bins - or more likely using magic to levitate the rubbish around.
in their interactions that kept him yearning for more. Blinging heck, it had barely been a week, but somehow Scorpius was precious to him already, and Draco was...sardonic, and annoying, and facetious, and such a doting father - to an actual child, no less! - that Harry
He had Astoria to thank for this lecture. That bitch lost the battle Wednesday and went tattling to his mummy.
Mr. James looked a bit stunned. It was a pitiful sight at his tea table and Scorpius decided take the man under his wing, so to speak.
"Potter!"
Hermione waved to him, with a little smile. "Is that how I am known now?"
His head fell forward, tired. His forehead found support on the toilet seat. How disgusting. He would never,  in his right mind, have allowed himself to do that. But he was not in his right mind. His vision blurred. His head hurt. His chest hurt. His soul ached.
"Well, now that I don’t need to move in with the Dursleys anymore and I inherited from my godfather the Black House, I thought maybe… You would like to live with me? NO NEED TO ANSWER NOW! I ... Yeah ... Well, I think it would be kind of depressing to live alone in such a big house. Your mom can even go along if she wants to. She's a Black after all. Probably, Monster would like you a lot more than me and ... Does she know about us ?! Of course, she does, stupid Potter, everyone reads the newspaper ... Did she say anything ?! Does she hate me?! AND..."
“Great. But you will have to order something.”
Draco choked, bringing his hands to his throat, coughing desperately.
Taking a deep breath, he tried desperately to remove his seatbelt. He had hit someone! Please don't be the cat, please don't be the cat, please don't be the cat….
"Are you afraid that he will leave now?"
"What? No! You get something off!"
“If you don't want to hang out you can just say, you know?” Neville patted his back. “You are a terrible liar and everyone needs to spend time alone every now and then ... Unless you are not alone?”
Harry lowered the cup that was drying, looking towards the entrance, where a man, covered from head to toe, in boots, pants, basically all black, placed a huge black umbrella in the umbrella holder. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up.
"And whoever is naked will pay a forfeit!" Simas shouted from the kitchen, in which he opened another package of snacks, this time with scissors.
Teddy ran up the stairs, as fast as his little five-year-old legs would allow. He stopped at Uncle Draco's laboratory door. He liked Uncle Draco very much, but unlike Harry, he didn't have that much time to play with him. Uncle Draco wanted to be a healer. He spent the whole day reading huge books, studying and taking notes. Teddy did not want to disturb. He knew it was very important for his uncle, but, it was so fun to play with him ...
“You are welcome. So what?”
“Yesterday.”
However, after everything, returning to innocence seemed impossible, mainly because of the clear vacant places, in the boats, and in the hearts, that would be punctuated in that crossing.
"Hmm ... No? I just said that ..."
“Can I try it?” Harry heard a soft voice behind him, but he didn't turn around, focusing on getting to the blond and pushing him into the kitchen.
On that particular night, he had decided to run close to the pier, listening to the bubbling of the River Thames, but a figure standing in the shade caught his attention. He approached with curiosity, slowing down when he realized it was a girl, so as not to scare her.
"But making an assumption. If I wanted you to do something for me, who would have to find it important enough, is it me or you?"
"Because I think you shouldn't go through this alone. Because even after negative experiences, these people found friends, family, for the rest of their lives. Because sometimes the people around you just don't want you to suffer and they don't necessarily have a reason behind it. Because, after everything that happened, maybe you should give yourself a chance. So, can you please at least try?"
"In their defense, Harry looked - "
Harry bit his lip and thought of Hermione in first year, bemoaning the lack of wood to start a fire.
"Yeah."
"Hello, dumplings," the withered old crone says in a withered old voice. She eyes them eagerly—probably excited to have company for once—and licks her crinkled lips. "Why, you’re frozen solid! Won't you come in out of the cold?"
He looked down the hall and saw his Dad standing in the middle of their living room, surrounded by wrapping paper, staring blankly at the smoking telly. The sight left Arthur cold and empty, like he was adrift in the water with nothing to hold on to. It wasn't even lunchtime in the Charming household but it was so...quiet.
“That’s what we’re here for in HR!” Arthur agrees. “Well - that’s what
“When they were born or conceived?”
"Not too crowded in your hovel?" he couldn't resist asking. He hoped Scorpius didn't know the word hovel. Though his back was still turned, Draco could feel the anger radiating from the man. But it was the middle of the night and Weasley had woken them up because he failed in his duty to protect James - Draco felt he was perfectly within his right to push some buttons in return. Especially when it was so easy.
Throat feeling a bit tight all of the sudden, James nodded. The stag was small and delicate, he was almost afraid to pick it up again. But it had an ethereal quality, much like his old Patronus which he could suddenly see in his mind's eye so clearly.
It was past ten in the evening now. Scorpius would be asleep. His mother would be pacing the east wing corridors anxiously, despite the reassurances he sent via owl. His father would be...well, there was no telling what state Lucius would be in from hour to hour. Hopefully asleep. All Draco wanted was a glass of fine Elvish vintage and maybe for Pansy to come off her extravagant honeymoon early and tell him he could pull off the bald look comparatively well.
"Donna brought the post," Alec said, nodding to the counter. James stroked Donna - Anne, Lucy, Black Widow, whatever her name was - and picked up the Muggle stationary on his way to the table.
"I've been in this forest a thousand times," the shivering idiot claims through chattering teeth. "I know how to get out."
, James knew that one. Intimately. The rushing sound, the sickly green light, the wave of dark energy - it encompassed his senses and he threw himself to the floor on instinct. Leapt to his feet and surged forward on instinct. Kept not-Monty from getting any farther into their home on instinct.
“This isn’t a prison,” Harry contended, gesturing to the back garden.
And he missed Malfoy's company. He would grudgingly admit that if he was unwilling to share his Monty-troubles with Malfoy, then perhaps he had gotten all he could from therapy. But that didn't mean they couldn't still talk. Or...was he turning into a clingy nightmare patient that demanded his doctor's personal time as well as professional? They had fun at the Quidditch game and half their sessions included nothing at all related to therapy. They often just bantered, laughed, teased, and shared; they talked about Malfoy's family and friends nearly as much as James's. Had James misread that as friendship? But then why had Malfoy been so hurt when James didn't pry into the incident in October? When he didn't treat him as a proper friend?
She did not appreciate the theatrics, but she left without hexing him, so he counted it as a victory.
“There are several goals we can pursue in our appointments, should you choose to continue. Auror Weasley has requested we look into your lost memory of the violent incident which took you from our world, is this something you’re interested in?”
Ginny and her fellow Chasers were superb, to say the least. James was on the edge of his seat and even found himself shouting silently along with the rest of the crowd when she pulled off a tight roll or a set of loops. Puddlemere put up a fight, but the Harpies were fierce. In the end, even after Puddlemere caught the snitch, the Harpies were victorious.
, by Bo Zhao. "Broom-making?! Da'!" Alec's eyes were blown wide and his mouth fell slack as he stared down at the set of ten books in his lap. He opened a few at random to discover fold-out diagrams of brooms in different stages of development, sample-twigs, and even a miniature model made of painted parchment. "Da'...this is - I just -
. Who told him that? Who could look at this man, this fiery, courageous, affectionate, gentle-hearted man and see something broken?
There was a long pause; it must have felt excruciating to Monty, if his pained expression was anything to go by. But James could almost see a new light shining. If he could identify the problem, he could fight it. He could win this war. He'd like to take Monty along with him to victory, but the man would have to get on board. To get him on board, James had to give him some space tonight.
He wasn’t ashamed of his boys and he didn’t resent them, but he couldn’t deny how much it felt like he and Aarti were being sentenced to increasingly hotter circles of hell.
"Okay, bye!" he blurted unceremoniously, turning heel and darting away. He heard the Muggles' laughter as he hurried outside. The lack of privacy in that kitchen should've filled him with a familiar rage, but he was far too full of new, fresh feelings to care.
“Just fine?”
Through the heavy iron door, which has proven to be resistant to wandless unlocking charms, Harry hears the trap-door lift from the hidden entrance of the bunker. Bubotuber pus. Fin has returned. Sometimes Harry finds himself so desperate for company that he's tempted to actually snuggle up with the man during 'storytime.' Not that he has recently. It's been years (probably) since he last gave into his raw need for human contact. Now he shakes with the rage of eternity when Fin is near. Now there's hard ice in his chest, slicing at his heart, and in his darkest moments he reminds himself that he is capable of cold-blooded murder. That he is aching for it.
"YOU KEEP WANKING IN THERE YOU'RE LIKE TO PULL IT OFF!" Sirius sounded halfway between a leer and a bark of laughter.
James waved his hands dismissively and started signing a response, but Monty looked away. He couldn't talk to James when he got like this, all wrapped up in his issues and his independence and his fucking pride, completely unwilling to give anyone a chance. This was why he hated fighting with him, it was nearly impossible to win and it only served to upset them both! When he finally looked forward again, James was back to signing slowly and gently.
“We agreed it’s Blupin Fr - “
“'It's not you, it's me'?” Draco manages. He feels like he's choking. Is this how it ends? Six months of living together, suffering the media storm together, braving Weasel Sunday lunches together – twenty four lunches! – and it ends here, on this blasted sofa. With the Wireless playing a Harpies game in the background. Draco doesn't think he can handle it if Weaslette scores right now.
They had a long holiday break ahead of them.
Monty growled again.
And Harry explains. He says he's broken, “or something.” He says he thought he just couldn't keep up with Weaslette – and damn it all, the bitch scores just as he says her name and Draco slashes his wand at the radio. They're left in silence, Harry's words ringing between them.
“Probably fired,” says Padma P., wearing a bright green tunic.
Alec gave him an uncomfortable but pointed look, his green eyes huge behind the magnifying lenses. "Well. He didn't
"Attacked how -
Scorpius nodded. "Mine means scorpion, but I don't like scorpions as much as Daddy likes dragons and I don't want any on my bed."
"Well, Scorpius, I've been in Greece these last couple months, as you know," she began. Scorpius nodded and pried for more details that he wouldn't fully understand, details about her research and studies. Astoria specialized in ancient magic history. Scorpius could barely remember what he had for breakfast, so Draco doubted he could quite grasp the intricacies of ancient Grecian male fertility ceremonies.
"It's—not right," he says, striving for gentleness. "It's practically cannibalism, to
"....how…?" He stared up at it, mouth agape, struggling to wrap his head around what he was seeing.
[incoming text from: J-bird]
"Eat me, Potter!"
His sarcasm never translated as well as Monty's when he signed so he decided to keep things neutral.
The boys didn't need telling twice. They dove into the packages and loaded their plates with more food than Remus thought they could possibly eat in a single day, but there was plenty to go around. Numbly, he reached out and spooned some rice, chicken, and curry onto his plate, accepting a couple of samosas and a piece of naan as the various takeout dishes traveled around the table.
Blaise rolled his eyes but stood, snatching up the discarded newspaper. "Look, that was too far, I'll admit." Draco was desperate to try out that new hex, the one that would cause Blaise's teeth to bite himself every time he opened his mouth. But he resisted, as he always did with his chatty scrotum of a friend. "But we're not through talking about this," Blaise went on. "Potter's seeing you professionally? You're seeing Potter
He looks down at himself. "It's not like we're equipped with the proper utensils, but I don't think I missed too much of that sponge-cake…"
James explained weakly, ducking his head sheepishly.
Hermione and Monty chatted happily as they finished their tea. Then Hermione went back home and Monty dragged James back to bed.
"It was amicable," Draco told him over pasta.
They were fiancés!
someone's
and so it had to be done. The fort was coming down to mask his shame.
Instinctively, Draco knows they have their magic now that they're outside the confines of the oven. He whips out his wand—the tip brushes his now flaccid cock, as if mocking his efforts to distract Potter earlier—and pulls the door open with a wordless incantation. The screams morph into a desperate crowing that's somehow worse and then the old woman is flinging herself out of the chamber, tripping over Potter again and crashing full-force into the far wall of the gingerbread corridor. Her head breaks through and she scrabbles comically to free herself, but can't. Draco huffs a laugh, but doesn't really feel it.
Draco crouched down, bracing himself with a hand on the table and peering at him in mild alarm.
An hour later, after a bath and a dose, James emerged from the loo just in time to hear Monty start up the stairs. He hurried into the bedroom, feeling achy and tired down to his core, wanting none of what Monty had to say. He eased the door shut and retrieved his wand just in time.
"TURN IT OFF!" Monty roared.
, and he let the bartender know it. He couldn't even feel the burn like Sirius's whiskey. He tried to watch her pour more drinks but got distracted by something, and then he was trying very hard to not spill on his way past the raucous billiards table.
He retched, and retched, then retched some more. Someone rubbed his back. Low voices conferred, but Draco wasn't among them. He let a few more tears slip out, not feeling nearly as far away from the bunker as he once did, and that was the end of it.
He didn’t know when Sirius had let himself into the shop, didn’t even notice the burst of frigid air he brought with him.
make things difficult."
"In our first meeting, the one in which you agreed to pursue my care, you indicated that you were not interested in gaining full memory recovery," he said while he studied a form in James's file, as if reciting from a script. "Unless you've changed your mind, I suggest we leave Mr. Potter out of our sessions. From my own experience, I can assure you that he will only bring us trouble. Do you understand, Mr.
and Monty started re-washing the pan before he could say anything.
“M-my hair?” he asked, his hand automatically rising to smooth it over. It wasn’t as long as it had been before the incident, but he’d certainly cut it shorter than this in the past. After the war. He narrowed his eyes suspiciously. “Are you taking the piss, Potter?”
The other boy wore clothes similar to Potter Senior himself: a striped t-shirt, denim trousers (though his were more fitted than Potter the Pigeon, who apparently still couldn’t dress himself properly), and brown ankle-high boots which were clunky and incongruent with the rest of his outfit.
now," he said carefully. He didn't want to say it out loud. "I mean, he ate
“Ugh, not this again…”
"You said we cannae have a cat cos of the hair," Arty went on. "Well, she's hairless!"
A year ago, Draco could have counted Charming as a good friend. As usual, Potter had came storming through to ruin things. Protests and op-eds and shit comments on Draco's shit hair that was only shitty in the first place because of Potter's idiocy.
Alec nodded, gave him a hug that ended much too soon, and sat back down by the tree. James didn't see what he gave Monty.
"Didn't take but a few hours to get authorization for the truth serum - for a squib, no less."
Looking back later, James could narrow it down to several triggers: the fourth near-sleepless night in a row while he listened to Monty's sniffles and snores from the other room; mindlessly mucking up what must have been a dozen orders that day as he alone worked the counter and tried to keep up with the pre-Christmas crowd; finally, losing his notepad at some point and being unable to adequately mime to the crotchety old woman that he was mute, not rude.
On the other hand, Monty's complaints weren't entirely unfounded. Harry was spending all his time with Malfoy, which was a sight he never thought to see. Ron knew better than anyone how much of a prat Harry could be sometimes and tonight he was showing his finest passive aggressive moves. He hardly replied to Monty's conversation starters, and when he did, he pointedly dragged Malfoy into the discussion. It was as if he wanted to intentionally test Monty's patience.
. Countless dreams and memories of playing chess in the room with the red furniture; doing homework with a quill in a library; hurrying through corridors while pressed together, hidden under some sort of liquid-fabric; huddled together in a tent that was bigger on the inside…
“Er - yes, very good,” Arthur says. Bellatrix is staring at Cormac with murder in her eyes as she writes
"Mr. Lupin comes from a school," Monty explained, still staring oddly at Remus. "Wants tae talk t'ye both."
James stared at him in sheer disbelief and Monty let himself ride that awful wave for a moment, the half-guilty, half-satisfied feeling that came from leaning into his petty thoughts.
James laughed and sipped his wine. He couldn't say whether it was white or red wine, as he hadn't looked down at his glass in ages.
"No memory?" McGonagall gasped. Remus felt his heart, which had spent the last two hours winding up tight like a spring, break to pieces as Harry glared at Monty, at McGonagall, at Remus, at the pantry, and finally at the table.
Muffled inside the wardrobe, Arthur's secret cat gave an annoyed meow.
“Not a chance I'm letting you brood up there like a pigeon - what say we grab a Butterbeer, yeah?”
He remembered that she said something along the lines of:
, James didn’t know. But he knew he had no business discussing his issues with Monty in this space.
James grinned broadly as his wand translated the random crudeness. Draco blinked and James said it again:
Draco peers closer as he passes and nods sagely. Yes. There’s a distinct nipple stretched out on the cream-colored lamp shade, like the red spot on Jupiter. How whimsical.
Draco stared at him. Harry shrugged. Charlie had talked about his community of cave-dwellings in Romania at tea yesterday. It seemed relevant.
Potter's highly publicized return to the wizarding world was still shrouded in mystery, but that shroud was being pulled back little by little. The public knew nothing of his amnesia and little of his injuries; they knew his children went to Hogwarts and, thanks to some blabbermouth students, they knew his children went by the name Charming. A farce of a name and oh so easily traced back to a reasonably popular chocolate shop in Scotland.
"I've never seen 'im like that..." he mumbled, sitting dejectedly on his bed. "Somethin's wrong."
“Red.”
"Draco - "
The forest was in the far distance and they were meandering in the general direction of the old silo, though they wouldn't reach it in their time together today. Much like this fantastical concept of recovery, the silo was always waiting for him in the far distance. It might as well not exist, for all Harry had been able to get there without some sort of interruption.
Hermione looks over, hands raised high overhead, grasping the exposed breasts of the mannequin.
Now if only he knew how to land.
"You should always say please and thank you," he began. "And right now, your mouth is open, that's gross. No one wants to count your teeth. And you're staring. You're all slouched over too. Sit straight!" He clapped his hands twice like Grandmum did sometimes and was pleased to see Mr. James shoot straight up in his seat.
And with that, Draco and Harry are left alone with only a brightly lit counter and a plate of Jell-O between them.
He caught the little bugger before he hit the ground - well, before his face hit the ground, at any rate - and set him upright on the ground.
The word flashed in his mind with singular clarity as James jabbed the wand forward, sending the closest dark figure flying into the back wall of the compartment and a second wand hurtling through the air. James caught it and turned the first wand on the last remaining target
Charming nodded once.
"The Moscow Ballet - "
It felt quite nice but the tears came anyway.
"I imagine a few days without even a name would drive anyone mad - not that you were mad!" he added hastily at James's warning glance. "Only… It must have given you something familiar to latch onto."
He was practically vibrating when Pansy brought them back into the yoga parlor. They set right to work sketching his space and her skilled hand quickly brought it out of his head for the others to see. Before he was quite finished admiring it, she snapped closed the sketchbook, bid them farewell, and traipsed away.
“I’ve wanted to do that since we potted the Dirty Dirt in Herbology,” Potter admits, looking only half as ashamed as he should be. He strips off his own unbuttoned shirt, flinging it onto the bed.
signed Monty.
"Aarti?" said Molly.
"There we are, Adam," Ben says warmly, toweling Harry's hair dry after another sponge-bath.
Draco resisted the urge to simply walk out without answering such a stupid question.
"Yer no' afraid?" he continued as he poured more soap across the remaining dishes. "Only, ye said after the train incident..." And after the nightmare in September, and after the Portkey back to their shop following the Quidditch match… James
Again, the flashbacks are in no particular order, but the bunker timeline goes Danny, Denny, Lenny, Ben, and Fin.
"Welcome to… Malfoy and Parkinson Realty," the wix said, their nose wrinkling in distaste at the mess Harry had tracked in. He figured his Mind Healer wouldn't back him up here, but he decided to ignore the flash of regret anyway.
He was almost grateful for Ron and Hermione's interruption.
No reply.
“A rousing performance of Gryffindor bravado,” he applauded. "Have you taken a hangover potion?"
James's head jerked up in surprise. The way Monty was staring at him - he looked betrayed.
Of course, James was probably just worried the boys would figure out that something was wrong. And as much as Monty knew Alec and Arthur would have his back and might be able to talk some sense into their stubborn dad, he would never try to turn them against James. That wasn't playing fair, for James or the kiddos.
“Well, outside of Corporate, everyone hates you,” Harry says frankly. Draco closes his eyes and takes a breath, appearing to summon patience from the depths of his soul. “If we stick together, if my reputation rubs off on you, then your department’s safe.”
"Let's get you home, ferret."
sorry, Draco, please..."
Harry opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted. "Haz Blue! Pleased you could make it." Malfoy stalked over, his boots clicking sharply on the floor. He looked very important in business-casual dress, and very...good-postured. That surely accounted for the nice shape his torso made, shoulders firm and straight over his narrow hips. Harry's mouth was still open and he looked between Terry and Malfoy, unsure of whom to address.
“You want to help, I understand,” he interrupted, barely sparing the man a glance. “You can assist with a direct translation. Mr. Charming, have you ever experienced flashbacks to your lost memories?”
, James nodded, referring to the cakes they kept on display at the counter and sold slice by slice. They could go through half a dozen cakes on a good week.
"I've lessons at home," Scorpius explained like it was obvious. The answer set his teeth on edge.
"Are you afraid of cats, Mr. Charming?" Minerva asked carefully, trying to catch his eye. Alec twitched tellingly and shrugged again, avoiding her gaze.
"Typical Gryffindor behavior," Malfoy scoffed, in one of his more expressive moments. "Do you find you're often driven to such exhibitionism? Merlin forbid the world forget your chivalry."
"No, yes, you're right," he sighed. "People are not stupid. They just don't know any better yet." Scorpius nodded in satisfaction and Mr. James expression lifted into the same teasing smile that Mummy used.
reward Potter's puerile puns. And because he was looking away, he missed the moment Harry sank down onto the frosted ground, on one knee.
Draco opened his mouth to let out a witty retort but none came, of course. The crafty bitch always tripped him up. Pansy was easier.
"Yes,
Draco startles. “No…” Surely that’s not right. “Cooks
"Potter..." Draco glanced at his father warily, waiting for the inevitable. "Nott wants Potter. I'm to retrieve him."
“Belrose?”
"Food!" Molly W. cries. Everyone jumps. "I'd like to introduce - oh, er...ethnic cuisine - to the menu!"
Remus felt his face turning red as he tried to suck down some air, but he managed to shake his head in the negative. He could hardly think for want of air, but he knew he was making a decidedly poor first impression.
"A'M NO THE STRONGEST SWIMMER, JAMES!"
“Oh, I like her,” Pansy says. Her suave facade is beginning to crack and she looks a bit stressed. “I like her very much.”
“Tell you what though, Harry’s my mate and everything, but it’s downright embarrassing to watch him pine over that posh git. He and Ginny had a thing going for a while - Harry and Ginny, I mean - but they didn’t work out. Always thought it would be cool if he was, like, my brother-in-law. And then Harry had some grand sexual awakening and pronounced his love for Cedric. Ruined a perfectly good Sunday dinner.”
"Why is Potter seeing a Mind Healer?"
Thanks for reading, I hope you've enjoyed my first Drarry.  (Actually my first romantic story, period!) (Can you even call this a Drarry if Draco refuses to call him Harry?) (I like Drames but it implies cross-gen.) (Drarming?) (Someone please teach me to end my sentences earlier so we avoid stupid shit like Drarming and penis mold.)
Malfoy's lips disappeared entirely and James wanted to shake the git.
CW for alcohol/intoxication and brief vomiting.
"Fred, my brother?" he asked quietly, eyes wide. Ron leaned in curiously.
“I’m going out - you see, I couldn’t do that if this were a prison!” He knew he was overreacting but it was happening anyway.
"Such
"Practice on who?!"
Potter huffs, not sounding very amused but not moving to pummel the indestructible door again. Thank fuck for small mercies.
Twelve years of wondering and then forcing those curious thoughts to the back of his mind, and these people waltz in without a by-your-leave, invite themselves for tea, and spew a load of fairytale nonsense to entice his boys while saddling him with a past he didn't want anything to do with. A violent past. It couldn't have been anything else, he had always known that, but now he knew details. He didn't want details. He wanted to leave the flames, the screams, the blank, staring, dead eyes in his dreams where they couldn't hurt anyone.
"Don't repeat that to your grandmother, mind."
"He uses a cane, I am a Healer," he said noncommittally. "Take from that what you will."
he asked, dropping the folder on the coffee table. Arthur froze and Alec cringed. Monty's brows shot up toward his hairline and James gestured at the folder.
"But so much is still new to you, and I..." Sirius cleared his throat, looking like he'd rather eat his favorite arm before continuing this torturous conversation. "I get scared
"Rumors?" Draco took another cleansing swallow of fresh, cool water. Water had never betrayed him, unlike Blaise.
"Percy Weasley actually put it all into motion, if you can believe it," Hermione laughed. Harry frowned. It was only the second most ludicrous thing about this conversation, after Draco's mum. "He drafted some changes to the old regulations for hormone potions - aphrodisiacs, not gender-tuners - and the specific potion that
at the slightest brush of a finger. Alec stared into his half-empty glass and decided he didn't really care for the smell of milk.
His hand brushed against something stiff in the pillowcase and he sat up to investigate. He tipped the pillow vertical, shaking it out, and a small packet fell out.
"All jokes aside," Draco says with a sniff. "Severus, I'm just concerned about
Monty said slowly.
. What is that? Where are you from?" He could almost place where he had heard that accent, it was just out of his reach. As a Mind Healer specializing in memory, this kind of thing drove him up the wall. "And he'd never pair that cravat with lilac trimmed robes!"
James signed, looking up at him guardedly. Draco nodded, not sure what he was agreeing to.
he thought incredulously, cursing Harry's temper.
"Well, maybe he meant it a diff'rent way," he shrugged again. "So they used to be around and...then they weren't."
, Monty insisted. James heard the door open and close, saw a young woman in a suit nod a greeting in their direction before browsing the selection.

Healer Malfoy was so similar to and so different from the boy in James’s memories, the sneering blond git. James recalled Hermione slapping Malfoy once, though he couldn’t remember why. He probably deserved it. He was always saying shit things in James’s memories. Or seeming to. He couldn’t quite recall the specifics, but nobody sneered like that when dishing out pleasantries.
"It's - nevermind that, do you really not remember any of this?" Draco huffed, looking amused and offended all at once.
“I thought we would talk today about your history as a parent,” Malfoy said, clearing his throat. “Would you care to start at the beginning? It’s good to lay it out as a narrative.”
"So this is what I do. I stock shelves, whatever department needs it most at the time. I've got a grey tunic, which means I don't really have a department of my own. I'm a floater. Luna, too - have you met her? She's brilliant."
“Could you at least transfigure a window?” Draco calls over, hoping to get back to the array of pudding. Potter’s forearm flexes beneath his fingers. The room is dry and suffocatingly hot.
“What are your specials?” Draco stepped in.
“I s’pose so,” Scorpius muttered bravely. “Could we go for ice cream then?” Harry smirked. Malfoy was getting played.
"Draco, I'm certain you're welcome to - "
“My family has significant investments in Voldecorp.”
, he insisted that evening as they washed up after dinner. The boys were bouncing around upstairs, causing the ceiling to shake. James was grateful for that brilliant
Potter peers around the frosty lair as if in a trance. Then, to Draco's horror and awe, he drops to the ground, lying flat on his back. He thinks he hears him murmur,
The embers are snuffed out. All that's left is ash and the reverence of what once was, and what might come.
In the wake of a question so similar to the one false-Blaise had asked a month ago, Draco fell silent. But that was all the answer so-far-seems-to-be-truly-Blaise needed. His friend settled back in his chair, all smug and shitty.
"Promise. We'll help you sort it out."
"Gallery today?" Arthur asked hopefully.
"Well, that's a first for you!" Malfoy was positively screechy now, though not quite yelling. "We're not
He shot up at once to catch an armful of Alec, who immediately broke down in quiet, shaking sobs against his chest.
Thank you to alpha readers Estrella (
"But Power Grid takes forever!"
“Right.”
"Well?" Draco asked softly. "Yay or nay?"
"Ye know, a was talkin' tae Remus at the game," he began, hanging the pot on the overhead rack. "He's a werewolf, right? An' he was tellin' me about the laws that lot has."
"You can't just
Pageboy cap firmly pulled over his scar, Harry kept his head down in the Leaky while they waited on their to-go orders. He hadn't actually been in Diagon Alley since before fourth year - unless he counted the floo trip to Fred and George's little shop after hours for a grand tour of Sirius's investment. (And why Sirius thought it was amusing to invest in a rival joke shop was beyond anyone's guess, but Harry supposed that in itself was the joke.) Even then, he hadn't stepped foot outside.
"Sure, it
Magic also explained his dreams, his nonsensical but vivid memories, and all of those weird things that seemed to happen around the Charming men. James’s mobile phones shorting out the moment he felt any strong emotion at all; Alec somehow managing to get that bloody robot working after a year of troubleshooting had driven him to the edge (even now they had no idea how it worked, beeping and booping away without any actual power source); Arthur mouthing off to the wrong bunch of lads and somehow ending up on top of the brawl, unscathed.
This chapter spans a full month, but the first half is just one very long day.  Hang in there, readers!  I promise it's worth it.
"If there's nothing else…?" It would be their shortest session yet, a mere fifteen minutes, in which Charming had told him all about his Gryffindor piss up and offered pointed comments and vague questions regarding Draco's personal life.
“Erm…” Harry dithered for a moment then knelt in the grass. He reached out, his hand hovering in uncertainty above the boy’s shoulder. “What hurts?”
Arty spluttered through his sip of water and Alec dropped his fork, looking up at McGonagall with huge, round eyes.
Monty.
He ignored the Inner Pessimist Voice that told him they'd been fighting for weeks - months, actually - and nobody else fought quite so often or so viciously. Ron and Hermione certainly didn't. If Dean and Seamus did, they hid it well.
2:45 pm
Oh god, had
Draco couldn't ignore the click of the door locking or the whoosh of an unfamiliar ward filling the room and snuffing out the fire. His hand automatically dipped to his wand, his mouth opening to warn Blaise that something was wrong, but it was too late. He was bound to his office chair - the slightly gawdy brocade swivel chair that his mother had acquired from a specialty shop in Historic Alley. His wand slipped from his hand and into Blaise's own poorly tailored robe pocket.
"No!" Scorpius said, brandishing his spoon in warning.
"Is this Alec?"
Blaise, rather. It's not about what he does with his bits; that's just the delicious icing on the bedded cake. It's about building the mood. Touching. Once Draco discovered the theory behind erogenous zones, well, the game changed and he found his rhythm.
"Draco, you didn't..." Astoria buried her perfectly painted face in her perfectly manicured hands and Draco felt a pang of foreboding.
he asked Monty earlier that Sunday afternoon when the man came to check on him for the umpteenth time.
He took them all out for lunch while Monty braved the holiday rush alone. He ignored the odd looks at the cafe, letting Alec translate for him at the register, and then took a detour through the park to stall before they had to return to the shop.
Temper or no temper, he knew, even as it was happening, that he was crossing some sort of line when he stormed over and wrenched the stick out of James's white-knuckle grip, flinging it into the far corner. James remained frozen on the spot while Monty went on, throwing every word he had in the hope that something would get across to his brick-wall of a boyfriend that had refused to listen to him these last couple months. There were words that may have belonged in a proper, less shouty row:
"If you start extracting memories now, you'll only do more long-term damage," Malfoy snapped. Harry looked between them, torn. Ron knew he wanted to help but this half-testimony wouldn't do a lick of good if they couldn't even piece together a cohesive story.
That look annoyed James at the time but later in the night it would haunt him. Monty was snoring away next to him, but James was wide awake. He was treating the man like shit, he knew. Pushing him away when he only wanted to help. It was in his nature to help, it was what made Monty
"What are you up to today, Harry?"
“Always happy to help them meet their quarterly targets,” he goes on viciously, stretching his arms overhead as if he doesn’t have an audience scribbling notes. “Don’ wanna be too greedy with ma hours. Just below full-time is perfect, if you ask me - “
“Albus, Potter doesn’t have access to jewelry, it’s entirely Malfoy's department - ”
thatch?" Harry scrunched his nose when he laid eyes on it. It was a dazzling property with all the flowers, the bright stone path, and the bold lines of the house itself. But, "How d'you hear the rain?"
…" He shudders. Potter jerks violently, still kneeling on the floor. He grasps the arm of Draco’s chair, inadvertently covering the faded design.
Monty's voice had called from the front door, sounding slightly off. Hermione theorized it was the accent that had changed, but James couldn't be certain. It was the only thing not-Monty had said except for spells.
They circled it, one walking clockwise and the other walking anti-clockwise. He caught his breath and focused on trailing his fingertips over the wall. He loved the feeling of wood, loved how it was rough and rugged at first but could be sanded down to velvet, and eventually - given enough time in the open air, in the elements - it would return to a gnarled, beaten, experienced state of being, like it had been as a tree.
The lights were gone and it was eerily quiet, which would've been infinitely worse if it weren't for the expansive starry sky overhead. He let himself cry, then, figuring no one could properly see him in the dark. Draco helped him up some stairs and knocked, and then he was in Sirius's arms, face pressed against his chest, nose full of his scent and hands clutching his kimono-style house robe.
"A home that doubles as a shop, then," Malfoy said, noting it with the overly large quill. Harry nodded. "What sort of business?"
Malfoy stared. “Indeed…” He clearly thought Harry was a nutter. He turned to his son, wiping a smudge of dirt from his cheek. "Another hour I'm afraid, Scorpius."
Denny hauls him up by his arm and drags him over to the sink. Harry kicks up a fight, already gagging, but Denny is easily twice his size. "No, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"
“Don’t you work in Technology?” Cedric D., wearing a flashy, multicolored apron, pipes up from the back of the room. Seamus fusses with his own black tunic.
"Er - I'm alright," Tony answered with a wary eye. James felt lighter with Nott's wand still pointed at Narcissa and Tony's wand now trained on him. He could think again.
"It's a funny school..." Remus muttered as the strong smell of curry hit his nostrils. Mixed with the sweet scent of chocolate, it was an oddly specific combination that threw him back to his sixth year Christmas holidays at the Potter cottage. He could almost hear Euphemia Potter singing in the kitchen, just out of sight, while the Marauders tore apart the house in raucous holiday fun.
One of the many parenting books on his shelf at home was
"Disguises are elementary," Tony explained shortly. "You must recall your own disguises at the train station in September? It's no trouble." James nodded automatically, remembering a flash of dark blond hair in the compartment of Aurors. Of the three Aurors, he hadn't managed to disarm Tony.
, he said.
to see his warm and loving Monty morph into...that. James had whipped out his wand and then couldn't even think of a spell to use; the sight of Monty advancing on him was so incongruous with his memories of magic that he just froze up. And
He staggered back into his bedroom. Alec seemed to know what he'd seen the moment he came in. A twin thing, maybe. He nodded. And then the tears blurred his vision and he lost sight of his brother. He sniffled a bit as a few tears leaked out, not quite feeling up to crying right now. It didn't feel right. Nothing felt right. Everything felt upside down and two inches to the left.

James shrugged noncommittally, looping one arm lightly - tentatively - around Draco's waist again as he reached over and grabbed a letter at random. He stared at Monty's name on the open envelope but made no move to read the message within.
"Why not?"
He pulled out of the dive within inches of the ground, his toes skimming the grass as he leveled out the nose of the broom before coasting over to Alec.
"Worked out in the end, though. Started sellin' 'is candies at the bakery an' through those mail-orders tha' Remus likes so much." He winked conspiratorially at the pale man. "That was all well an' good when he got sacked, he was able tae work outa his own kitchen for a while before he finally got this place, then a came along tae help out. Then a s'pose we ended up back in the manager's office for sexual - "
"Monty's not your family, Harry," she whispered, curling a hand over a wayward lock of Hugo's hair. "He may once have been but he forfeited that. He did, not you. You owe your children a happy father and you couldn't give them that if you'd let him stay."
"Mr. Malfoy - " Arthur said in alarm.
"Go! Before he comes back out!" Alec hauled his brother up and opened the door, shoving him through.
, he retorted, feeling perfectly smug. Arty's green eyes nearly bugged out of his skull and, to James's surprise, he pushed his chair back and hustled from the room. Hm. Weird. Well, at least Arty wasn't smirking at him anymore. Only...he hoped he hadn't pushed him too far, he was only joking -
Monty stared at him helplessly and James refused to meet his eyes. He perched on the stool behind the register and resigned himself to minding the counter this week. Monty had to create an entire inventory of baked goods, after all, so he had priority access to the kitchen.
- he escaped back onto the busy street.
So he waits. He talks to Danny, and when the man disappears for his first long absence - around the time that he seems less like Danny and more like Denny - Harry starts talking to himself.
he said.
Arthur said in that wavering, high-pitched voice. Hermione's heart broke a bit at the sound, wondering how she could ever get those two boys mixed up.
Thank you for all of your comments! I read and cherish every single one of them, and any suggestions you have definitely help to inspire me! One more chapter to go. I am so excited to reveal Harry's home, which is entirely inspired by my neighbor when I was growing up. I actually drove home recently and snagged a more up-to-date photo of it for this story (the last one I took is well over ten years old). Stay tuned!!
"You used a spell to push the Auror back, do you remember what it was?" Draco asked, struggling to keep the burning curiosity out of his voice.
"He's alright," Weasley began, eyeing him warily. He wore his Auror robe over bright orange pyjamas. Draco pulled to a stop at the bottom of the stairs, those words ringing uselessly in his skull. "But I thought you ought to get the story from me before you hear some half-baked rumor. There was an attack. Just an hour ago."
James looked heavenward. Who was teaching his boys to talk like sailors? Monty hadn't cursed in years - he just got creative instead.
Monty said again.
with one quick swipe of his apron.
With a start, Draco realized it was extremely similar to his own.
Hermione Granger-Weasley, ever the insufferable know-it-all, was also an efficient nag and brilliant conversationalist. Years ago, Draco looked in on her parents' long-term case as a side project during his last six months as a Mind Healer trainee. He nearly got himself chucked out of the program for snooping through patient files and butting his nose into the family troubles of an Order of Merlin recipient. But he submitted a viable treatment plan that utilized ancient charmwork and three new potions, one of which was his own creation. The unique combination successfully wore down the skilled Obliviation young Granger had inflicted on her parents during the war. He graduated with honors and became a shoe-in for an open position in the Janus Thickey Ward.
Remus had managed to "break" the floo, conveniently while his owl was "on holiday," which was "definitely a thing owls do, never you mind where." The post office witch pretended she suddenly didn't understand English, turning him away with a sweet and a wink. Ron and Hermione were talking up his new place as if they'd seen it already, going on about hosting Christmas there. Even Luna and Ginny came over to keep him busy enough that he couldn't
He didn't give him a chance to answer, knowing James would just overcomplicate it with more imaginary nonsense.
going to tell him though, right?"
"What?"
"Just doesn't seem very professional, to insult your employee publicly in a meeting - and Harry works hard!"
"Mummy says Daddy was a rude little lout when he was my age," Scorpius informed the table. Daddy made a weird squeaky sound but Mummy was the one who had said the word, after all, so Scorpius couldn't get in trouble for repeating it. "She said he always got what he wanted but he didn't make the friends he needed." Scorpius liked that line. It sounded important and it always made Daddy turn pink.
“Oh, I like your definition, Potty,” he sneers, leaning forward to look down the row at him. Ginny touches her hand to her forehead like she has a headache. “Except I would extend it to include intellectual differences as well.”
True to his word, the man at the counter seemed determined to close up shop despite the potential for business on a mild summer night. He cleared the crowd at top speed and within minutes, Remus found himself the last customer.
"What?!" Harry cried in alarm, prying his mud-caked face out of the ground. In the dim light, Draco could just barely make out the streaks of sludge coating his bent glasses.
“Oh yes, these earrings are made from a precious rare gemstone known for immortality! It’s priceless!”
But no matter - she was married. James had mentioned this past week that her husband Bobby or Robby or Knobby worked at a restaurant across town and was happy that his wife was able to find a job closer to home. A job with a boss that was all too sympathetic, Draco thought, to the stresses of pregnancy and money; a boss that was always willing to listen to her endless, prattling stories, while Draco lingered at the edge of the shop counter like a dunce -
"So why aaaAAAH - " He gagged violently on the next one; it was too heavy to come up by itself so he was forced to use his tongue and teeth in order to give birth to it. "
"Who in seven hells told you - " he cried, recoiling as if the idea offended him. "Girls are - no, I'm - I'm very gay, thank you."
Scorpius clamored up into the office chair and stood on his knees to reach the desk. He pulled a piece of his father's finest stationery close and began to write. He chose to use the special purple ink to make up for the delay. Not because it was pretty.
"I got here first," Alec sneered. "You can choose the next one."
"Oh! Er, you know, somewhere to live. On my own."
"There's nothing wrong wae him, he - "
“I have complete trust in Harry,” Albus says with a benign smile. “Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Flamel. I assure you, your gems are in good hands.”
"What?"
He paused, considering what those two days in hospital had been like.
"Care to fill me in on our escape plan?"
like his grandmother. Draco excused himself, promising to be quick, and found a note waiting for him in the parlor.
“Yeah,” Seamus F. chimes in. “An' I wanna see gay mannequins!”
The buzz of activity doesn’t slow; customers are accustomed to tuning out these announcements.
They crest a small hill and Potter clamps a hot palm over his mouth. Draco can almost taste the salt of his skin through his chapped lips and he has to reign in his tongue before it darts out to get a proper nibble.
He sucks the spoon clean and sticks it right into the mound of yellow Jell-O on the counter. It jiggles. The wheels of his cart squeak loudly in an otherwise smooth retreat.
"Malfoy," Draco corrects.
, James said shortly. Now he had to be the bad guy, shooting down what his kids saw as an exciting venture.
James said.
"Before," he confirmed. They were just getting started in their long history of tormenting that little bakery that culminated in the jam incident that got James sacked. "Anywho, took five years tae catch tha' bird. Finally wore 'im down wae some erotic chocolates." Ron started choking on his breadstick and Monty flashed a winning smile at the table.
Manners and decorum fly out the non-existent window. He doesn’t care if they spend all night in the freezing cold, they have to get out. He has to get Potter out.
He nodded to the hob.
"Gibbs said he has nightmares and scars...he knows enough to know that he doesn't want to get sucked back into it, I reckon."
"We're on excellent terms," he said. "We entered into the marriage with an understanding. I needed an heir. She wanted legal ties to our vaults. Even after the divorce, she has some claim to my family's wealth. It funds her private ventures, seeing as no one else would take her seriously enough to sponsor her."
"Do you understand what a Board of Directors is?"
"Assistant Store Manager - if you'd bother yourselves to read the name-tag - and I don't have time for this. We've agreed to let you follow the workers in their day to day duties, as per the Board of Directors' research on worker morale."
It swung open to reveal a kitchen the same size as the rest of the shop. A shiny white tile floor and deep red walls greeted him. To the left, old appliances and a huge oven hood took up two walls with a large rack of pots and pans hanging overhead. A spacious island-counter across the middle of the room was covered in neatly-arranged trays of neatly-arranged chocolate drops. With an odd jolt, Remus recognized these treats from the first Charming Chocolates variety-box he had requested via mail-order three years ago.
"Piss off, Danny," at first.
familiar. If Ron or Hermione had walked into his shop without an introduction, he wouldn't have known their names, but he would have known without a doubt that
"Yeah," he nodded, looking just as incredulous. "When he got the summons, they had some row - she and Lucius Malfoy - about putting the family in danger again. Can't imagine
Harry sighs, looking down at his feet momentarily before peeking back up through his lashes. "Well, sir. I understand if you have to put me in
concern! She ladles out two servings of a heavy broth. The slopping noise of the stew dropping into the bowls is hypnotic. He and Potter eagerly accept their portions. “Tuck in.”
“An alliance?” Draco glances at the camera then back at Harry.
Draco did some quick calculations before relaxing a fraction. Correct taste. Four hours. Surely any poison masquerading so well as a hangover potion would have taken effect by now.
“Granted, that means I am one of the only managers here that has no jurisdiction over Potter.”
Draco read and reread that one, his mouth falling open. It was one thing to suspect, another to see it written out in blue ink. This must have been right after the breakup, sometime after the Polyjuice attack, though there was still no date. He decided to take that line, the one implying James wanted him, with a grain of salt...the man sounded unhinged.
"What'd'ye think about expandin' intae baked goods?" he asked lightly as he pulled a pristine carrot cake out of the oven. He preened when he caught James's bright eyes admiring the cake. He loved making candy with James, but baking was his pride and joy.
leaving one for Blaise. He had to get back to work. Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom would be receiving a visit from their son later and Draco wanted them in proper clothes again. He detested those hideous bed-slippers.
" Molly asked incredulously.
James turned the paper over and surreptitiously slid it into the utensil drawer, where Rachel wouldn’t have to see it again. His regular rotation of bodyguards was looking particularly drawn lately. The case was taking a toll on the comparatively small Auror squad while the rest of the DMLE struggled to pick up the slack. The extended hours were brutal, sometimes extending into triple or quadruple shifts, however much he insisted he didn’t need a bodyguard now that he could recall how to use his wand properly. At least he was taking the threat seriously now, though Ron had nearly rolled his eyes right out of his head when he realized that James's newfound interest in the case was mostly due to Draco's October attack.
If only the long-time patients in the Janus Thickey Ward knew how much they had in common with their Healer. Then again, if they were able to make such connections, they probably wouldn’t need a bed in this ward. There was an outpatient program, after all.
Something about fingernails -
"We'll get you home soon as we can, mate," Ron promised, apparently able to follow the signing well enough too. Monty's heart swelled up - Harry Potter, whatever he was wrapped up in that was still plaguing James, had damn good friends. He was glad to have found them, even if he could do away with the rest of the nutty magic world that was stealing James away. "Just a few more questions. Your potions were fulfilled by post, correct?"
