"Oops! I'm sorry." He quickly retracted his hand, a pink tinge across his cheeks. The awkward silence only lasted a moment, before there was a loud pop right next to them.
"But what 'bout when I'm not useful no more?" Harry turned his wide emerald eyes toward his professor. "When I get 'nnoying and too much work?"
Harry gaped at his professor. Surely he was delirious. "Snape, did someone slip a delirium potion into your morning tea?"
I'm just gonna accept I am horrible at updating. It's been a rough year for everyone, and I lost my dad on the 29th of December from covid. Please wear your masks. It keeps people safe. I want this pandemic to end, I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through.
"Whichever works better. Oh, look! There they are!" She stood on her tiptoes, waving to them, despite the fact that she was standing in the middle of an empty pitch and they could see her just fine without the extra height. She waved them over, and grinned.
Within moments after they sat down, a witch appeared with a note pad. "Hello Professor Snape! What can I get for you and this little boy here?"
"I can't tell you Draco. They will kill me." Harry's eyes widened and he covered his mouth. That last sentence alone was enough to let Draco know what was going on. Draco's eyes darkened, and he raised his hand, causing Harry to flinch and fall out of the chair. "P-please don't hurt me! I didn't mean to! I'm sorry!" His eyes were full of tears.
"Harry, it's okay you didn't tell us. Are you safe now? And where does Snape come in?" Hermione said, wanting to make sure that Harry wouldn't get hurt anymore.
Severus hesitated. He knew the house was dangerous, but Harry had so little in his life. He was hoping maybe Harry could find something of his parents to keep close to him. "We can go in, but you have to be very careful. I don't want you getting hurt."
"Fine, but I'm doing this for Draco, I hope you know that! Meet me on the Quidditch Pitch before dinner. Draco likes to fly before then. I'm also bringing Blaise, he can help." With that, Pansy strode out of the closet.
Harry was kneeling on the floor, his uncle behind him. He heard the whoosh of air as the whip cut through it, landing with a harsh snap on his back. He hissed, knowing screaming only made it worse. Vernon was specifically focusing on the areas that were bruised from Dudley pushing him down the stairs the day before. The whip hit him again, causing him to bite his lip and the metallic taste of blood to flood his mouth. His vision was getting dark from the pain, and he knew he was going to pass out soon.
Sorry that this one is a bit later than normal. I'm going through a rough patch in my life at the moment. I hope you enjoy the update.
"Hm, alright." Madam Pomfrey nodded her head once, but she was beginning to grow worried. If he was abused, it would explain a lot. Later she would meet with Professor McGonagall to see if she knew anything about his home life. "Alright, lay down. Get some rest while you can. If you need me, I will be in the next room over." She left the room and headed to her office.
Severus was close to killing someone. He took a deep breath, he needed to be calm for Harry's sake. "Harry, can you please show me your back? I won't hurt you, I promise."
"Draco, stop pacing." Pansy said, looking up. She noticed the small child in Snape's arms pretty quickly. Draco ignored her, almost speeding up. "Draco, seriously. Just stop and look up. Professor Snape is right there!"
Harry stood up. "Off. I don't gotta hide anymore." He smiled at Snape. "Lets go!! I'm gonna have a family!" He grabbed Snape's hand. "How are we getting to the Ministry?"
Snape studied Harry for a moment. "No. This offer is entirely serious. I want to adopt you. I don't want you to go back to that house. Ever."
Harry sheepishly nodded. Upon receiving a nod from his dad to continue, he looked to the waitress. "Erm.. Hello. Can I please have the meat pie? And a butterbeer please?" He looked back over to his dad, who was smiling.
This chapter is a bit longer than normal because it's been so long and I had a lot I wanted to write. I apologize if it's not as well written as it used to be, I tried my hardest and I hope you enjoy
Ron however, had a slightly different question. "Wait, dad? You don't mean..." Ron looked at Snape with a questioning look.
"Of course you still get to go! Making sure you eat is my duty. Taking you to candy shops however, is my treat. Lets go. We won't be able to look around too long as I want to get you back to the castle before rumors start circulating about your disappearance."
Harry sighed, knowing he had no escape. "I had a bad dream, and when I woke up I just needed out. Walking helps me forget." He pushed himself further into the chair, trying to avoid Draco's gaze.
Harry grabbed his wand and handed it over to her. "There. Now I'm unarmed. Now can you please help me? It's about Malfoy."
"Some of them are bleeding." He walked over towards his desk and pulled out two vials of a potion, one blue and one magenta, as well as a pot of a strange green substance. "Okay Harry, right here I have a few potions. The blue one is a pain relieving potion, and the magenta is a potion that will allow me to view the abuse while keeping your mind elsewhere, so you don't have to see it when I'm there." He gave Harry the blue potion. "Best take that now, I'm going to clean and heal up the gashes on your back to avoid any infections."
Harry paled, and hid slightly behind his father's tall form. Snape took notice and held up his hand gently. "I'm really sorry, can this conversation please wait? This might be a little too much for Harry right now. I promise I'll talk to you about what happened later, with Harry's consent of course. Right now I just want to help him feel better."
"If anyone says anything to you, tell me. I don't think they will though. Just be yourself Harry, I will keep you safe from all the meanies in the world." Snape said with a gentle tickle to Harry's side.
"Draco, stop pacing! Do you really think that will help Harry?" Blaise's voice rang out in the otherwise quiet room, apart from Draco's shoes hitting the floor.
"Harry, we could never hate you. You're our friend, and friends stick together. Thank you so much for telling us. Goodnight, Harry." With that, Hermione and Ron headed off to the dormitory.
The man slowly started to smirk. He threw down his mug, making it shatter on the floor right next to the child. "Freak! You missed a spot." He leaned down next to the child, his face scarily close. "Clean it up, freak."
The two walked up to the house, which was utterly destroyed by the killing curse that failed to kill Harry. Harry instinctively grabbed Severus's hand, seeking comfort. "Is there any chance we can go in?"
"Okay Harry. Come here." He grabbed his hand and led him into the fireplace. Taking a handful of floo powder, he tossed it into the fire. "Saint Mungos." With a whoosh of fire, they were swept away from the Ministry.
Harry woke up, rubbing his eyes. Madam Pomfrey noticed and rushed over to him, checking his vitals again.
Harry looked down in shame. "I'm sorry 'fessor Snape... I just was so excited. I understand if you don't wanna get me anything now..."
Draco laughed a little at Harry's mispronunciation. While he wasn't used to seeing Harry act young like this, it didn't matter. He's still Harry, still his friend, and most importantly, still safe. "I'm glad you're safe Harry." Draco held his arms out, offering a hug. He wasn't really expecting Harry to give him one, but he was shocked when Harry threw himself into his arms.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other, each thinking the same thought. 'Draco isn't a bad guy?' Hermione gave Harry a shaky smile. "I promise Harry, we're here for you. If you need anything or anyone to talk to, we're here. That's what friends do. Thank you for telling us. Also, you mentioned thanking Draco, I saw him pacing around the library earlier. I just thought he was thinking up more ways to annoy you, but I think I got that wrong. I think he was worrying about you. I love you Harry. I'm glad you're safe now."
"Okay, well how about this time I will pick you up so we both can go at the same time, and neither of us get lost?"
"Dobby?" Draco's voice rang out in the empty kitchen. With a loud pop, the long eared house elf was right next to them.
"Of course! I nearly forgot, sorry Harry." He grabbed Harry's hand and practically dragged him over to a table in the corner. "How long have you been walking?"
Harry nodded and proceeded to follow Draco. They stopped in front of a painting of a bowl of fruit. Draco reached up, and proceeded to tickle the pear, causing it to turn into a door handle. They walked in, and paused.
"Are you all right Mister Malfoy? You aren't acting like yourself." Worry etched Madam Pomfrey's face. Before she could push a little further to see what was wrong, a strangled groan arose from the bed. "Oh thank heavens you're alright!" She rushed to his side and began taking his vitals.
Before too long, their food arrived and both their stomachs were satiated with the delicious fare. Snape paid and left a generous tip, making sure to grab the pictures Harry had colored before leaving. "All right Harry. Ready for Honeydukes?"
I know, I know, that took forever! Been a busy year! Got married, came out as trans after literal years in denial, moved back to Oklahoma, and now things have finally settled down. I'm sorry it took so long, but I should hopefully be able to update more often! I hope you all enjoyed the chapter. I love you all!
"Wait a minute. Potter. How on earth did you manage to notice that? I sit next to him every day, don't you think I would've noticed that?" Pansy was incredulous.
The pug-faced girl halted, and looked around. "Potter? What do you want?" Sneering, she walked over to where he was hiding.
Snape quickly walked to the elevator, pressing the button for the second floor. As they descended lower, people got on. Finally a cool, female voice spoke. "Ministry of Magic, Level Two. Department of Magical Law Enforcement." Snape led Harry out of the elevator, seeking out a blond head in the crowd.
Harry followed Snape out of the elevator, sticking close by. He was worried that Dumbledore was going to show up at any moment and declare he go back to the Dursley's care, if it could be called that. He followed Snape up to a desk, waiting silently but alertly.
"Are you okay Draco?" Harry asked. He had been quiet for too long, staring at nothing. Harry had started to get worried.
Neville managed a weak nod. "I'm fine. Just... It's nothing. I'm fine." Neville caught himself, mentally berating himself for almost telling him. They made him swear not to tell.
"And why should I trust you? We hate each other, remember?" She gave him a calculating glance, looking him over.
It was Harry who spoke first. "Draco, this is an intervention. I noticed you had an addiction, I asked Pansy for help. She and Blaise agreed to help me help you." His voice was confident.
Harry immediately started a run for the brightly lit Honeydukes, letting his nose guide the way. Before too long, he was standing in front of the shop in awe.
"Well, he's certainly right about that." She pulled some parchment forms out from a desk. "This is the form you need to sign in order to get him under your guardianship immediately. Normally there would be a period of time in between, but we can't risk that. I will give my seal of approval to force this through right away." She handed Snape the forms and a quill.
Harry chuckled slightly at that, and got up. He made sure he had his bag and headed down to the Quidditch Pitch to wait for everyone. Based on the time, Malfoy should be there soon. He grabbed his broom, deciding to fly for a bit to kill time. He was just mounting it when a voice by his ear startled him.
"I need your help. This school has a serious problem, and only you will be able to help me." His eyes were almost pleading.
Harry sighed. I think she knows... she can't know. Nobody can know. He will kill me if they know. He settled into the bed, and allowed himself to think happy thoughts, such as eating a green apple for the first time in over a year, hugging Malfoy, treacle tart. It only took him one second to shoot up, realizing he had just thought about hugging Malfoy. Shaking his head, he sunk into the blankets. It was probably just the potion he was hit with. He would never think about that normally. He closed his eyes, hoping everything would be resolved tonight before dinner. With that comforting thought, he fell asleep.
"Yeah! That's fine! And you two... thank you for listening to me and not hating me. I'm glad you're my friends. Thank you." Harry reached out and gave them both a large hug, pouring his emotions into it.
Harry mulled that over. "Okay! Does this mean I have a dad now?" He grinned, his tears drying up quickly.
Harry cast a wary glance to those around him, who smiled sympathetically. He then followed the professor, who surprisingly was walking slow enough for him to keep up. Harry studied his face. He looked tense, and Harry was immediately on guard. The worst attacks came when Uncle Vernon had a rough day. His hand clenched on his wand.
Harry stiffened in his seat. He had no idea how his professor had found out, but some weird feeling inside of him told him he could trust the man. He took a deep breath and began. "My family began starving me from the moment I was under their care. When I was three, the beatings began. I would get beat if I burnt the food, if I talked, if I asked questions, when I wet the cot, and if I made any noise. He started training Dudley to beat me too. When I turned five, my uncle decided that beating me wasn't enough. That was when he introduced me to the whip. He would beat me with that whip whenever I messed up." Harry paused as a shiver of pain ran up his spine. "I messed up often. Nearly every day I would get whipped, sometimes even multiple times a day. I learned quickly to be silent. If I made noise, it would get worse. When I was seven, he raped me. He continued with the beating and the rape up until I went to Hogwarts. I remember in first year, I had begged Dumbledore to let me leave. He told me I had to stay for the greater good. I gave up asking for help from anyone. When uncle Vernon had found out somehow, he beat me worse than before. He poured bleach on my back. I ended up horribly sick but he wouldn't let me go to the hospital. I made it until I got here, and had Madam Pomfrey fix me. She doesn't know what really happened. The only people that know here are Neville, you, and Dumbledore. I'm not sure if Draco knows... He probably figured it out." Harry relaxed back in his seat, signalling the end.
It was obvious Draco was confused. "Harry, what are you doing down here by the Slytherin dormitories, let alone at this time?"
It took a few moments, but Draco gave a stiff nod, and moved away from his friend, tears still glistening in his silver blue eyes. "Harry was being abused at his muggle family's home. I told my godfather because I just couldn't let him stay there any longer. I've never seen anything like it. He kept saying that they would kill him because I found out. Blaise, you can't tell anyone." Draco looked at Blaise with pleading eyes.
"Harry, I want you to understand that I will never be like them. I will never raise my hand to you in anger or frustration. I will never harm you in any way." Before Snape could say anything else, the cool female voice was heard, announcing their arrival to the fourth floor. "Come on Harry, this is us."
Draco and Blaise looked at each other in awe, then turned back to their friend. Draco quickly told her the plan, and she nodded firmly. "Are we all in agreement? We're going to protect Harry from the so called light side." Upon receiving another nod, Draco grimaced. "I just wish we didn't need to protect him."
"Well, you seem to be doing just fine. You're free to go Mister Potter. However, if you keep ending up in here, we may be on a first name basis soon!"
"Harry! Where have you been? You know Professor Snape doesn't like it when you're late. You barely made it on time!" Hermione automatically started. Thankfully, her montage was cut short by Snape walking through the doors, his cape billowing out behind him.
"Potter. Get off me!" Malfoy struggled to push the limp body off of him. "Potter! Potter! Harry!! Get up!" Malfoy was getting frustrated with him, until he realized Harry wasn't responding. "Professor! Get over here! Something's wrong with him!"
Snape turned to Lucius. "Sorry about that. He's really excited today. He's also acting a bit younger than normal... I think I'm gonna have to ask the healers about that to figure out if it's normal." He turned to Harry. "Harry, Lucius is one of the good guys. So if you ever need something and can't get to me, go to him."
"You better not mess this simple potion up, Potter. I'm not taking a failing grade for you."  Malfoy opened the book to the required page. "Go get the ingredients, Potter. Surely even you can do that correctly."
Severus put his arms around Harry. "They love you too. They will always be in your heart, Harry. We can come back and visit any time you want." After this, the pair sat in silence for a while, taking in the comfort of each others company. Finally, Harry rose.
Draco stood up and turned to leave but a sudden thought struck him. "What if he already knows? What if he knows and he left Harry there to suffer?"
"But, professor, I'm a freak. No one wants me." Harry kept persisting. "No one will ever want me. That's just the way things are."  He looked down, his eyes starting to tear up. "It's the way things will always be."
The waitress smiled and nodded. Without being asked, she handed Harry some coloring parchment and some crayons and went to the kitchen.
"Severus, my boy. It is for the greater good. The child must know suffering in order to become strong. You, of all people, should know that." Dumbledore reached out an almost pleading hand, as if he was expecting Severus to just go along with it.
"This is what you deserve for being a freak, boy. I'm going to beat this out of you. Then you can stay around and be my toy forever because they won't want you if you aren't a freak." Vernon's voice was sickening, and he hit Harry harder. "They don't want you now, but they are stuck with you, just like I am."
Harry nodded, hardly believing he was going to have a dad soon. He grabbed Snape's hand, grinning. "Let's go!"
"That's it, isn't it, dad." His voice seemed flat and empty, and Severus knew why. He followed his son's gaze to a destroyed house, not too far from where they were standing. "That's where my mum and dad died protecting me."
"Thank you, dad. I think I'm ready to go home now." He turned to get a final glimpse of the headstone. "But I'd like to come back again some day." He moved towards Severus, who took his hand, and the pair apparated back to Hogsmeade.
"Hello. I was wondering where the mind healer that specializes in abuse cases is located. I just adopted my son and he was abused pretty badly in his previous household." The male at the desk nodded, his eyes passing over Harry.
"You mean I still get to go? I thought since you were feeding me that would be it. You have already spent enough money on me today." Harry looked at the professor in confusion.
Harry slipped his shirt on, wincing when it hit his back. He sat back down, not bothering to reapply the glamours. "Okay Professor. I'm listening."
Harry looked up at him, beaming. He tackled his father in a hug. "Thank you. Thank you for saving me." Harry pulled away quickly, afraid that if the hug lasted too long he might bother Snape. Snape must've known exactly what was going on in Harry's head as he gently pulled him back in and stroked his hair.
"I am just really clumsy, Madam Pomfrey. I fall way too often." He hoped she wouldn't notice the lie.
"Harry! Don't run off. Something could have happened to you!" Snape admonished quickly. They were too close to the school. He wouldn't doubt Dumbledore trying to steal him back as soon as he found out about the adoption.
"Haven't you noticed? The school hasn't had a single green apple for about a year, and the only one ever seen eating them is Malfoy! He has a serious problem."
Almost immediately after Snape and Harry entered the castle, they were accosted by Hermione and Ron, who appeared frantic.
Neville took a deep breath. "Thank you Harry. That means a lot to me." He gave a weak, sad smile. "Are you okay after what happened in Potions? I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to mess up."
"I won't tell anyone. You told Snape, correct?" Upon receiving a brisk nod from Draco, Blaise continued. "I trust that your godfather will do everything he can to keep Harry safe." Blaise paused, thinking. He was filled with a rage he'd never felt before. However, he knew he had to be calm. He wouldn't stand for abuse in any situation. Blaise agreed with Draco, the headmaster knew everything, which means he knew about what was happening to Harry. He turned towards Draco and took a breath. "What's the plan Draco?"
"Yeah! Mr. and Mrs. Weasley took me last summer to Diagon Alley through the floo! I got lost..." He messed up his hair sheepishly.
Harry sat down next to Neville, noticing him alone. Hermione and Ron had each other, right now Neville needed someone. "Hello Neville. Mind if I join you?" Harry noticed something about Neville was off, he wasn't as full of life as he normally was. Harry gently touched his shoulder, and Neville jumped and fell off the bench, his eyes wide and full of fear. Harry quickly helped him up, understanding. He was positive Neville was abused. It showed in his eyes. Harry was sure his were the exact same, if only someone cared to look deep enough into them. "Neville. Are you alright?"
Draco surprised him by laughing. "Glad you're okay Harry. I'm gonna head to Transfiguration. See you around."
Draco looked at all the sincere faces around him. He knew he had a problem, he just didn't know why Harry cared. "Fine. I have a problem. I've become obsessed with apples for some reason. I will quit taking so many. I will cut back to three a day. That way there will be enough for everyone else. Does that work?"
Harry grinned and pressed the button, laughing slightly at the noise it made. The elevator slowly rose, and Harry started to grow worried. "Dad, what if they can't fix me?"
"Thank you daddy." Harry giggled at the fact the mean scary potions professor just said the word 'meanies'. He then reached his arms up in the universally understood sign of wanting to be picked up, and snuggled into his dad's neck as soon as he obliged. "I love you daddy."
Pansy turned a shade of pink and looked away sheepishly. "I was headed to ask Professor Snape for some help in the potions work this morning and I heard him talking to Harry. It made sense though. I honestly wasn't too surprised."
"A calming drought will be useful. If all else fails, send an owl to fetch me and I will try my hardest to get over there to help him through it all." Saxton relaxed a little in his seat. "Is there anything else?"
"I just needed... some air." Harry tried his best to sound convincing but he noticed a flicker of concern flash in Draco's eyes.
After Snape filled out the forms, both he and Harry were required to sign them. As Harry finished his signature, a small flurry of blue sparks swirled around them, signalling it official.
Saxton watched the scene unfold in front of him. A small raven haired child was scrubbing the floors in the kitchen, while an enormous man surveyed his work.
Severus and Harry landed in a field near the wizarding village of Godric's Hallow. They began making their way to the town, spotting the graveyard after a moment. However, Harry grew distracted by a house in the distance.
Snape sighed. "They beat him, starved him, and raped him from a very young age. You see why we can't let this continue. The only reason it took this long for anyone else to notice was because he kept glamours up. I've also noticed he has a mental age regression at points. Dumbledore has known about the abuse from the start, yet he refused to do anything. We need to rush this adoption through and use protective measures to keep Dumbledore from being able to interfere.  We are certain he will try to meddle with this if he can.  Lucius said that you were our best bet on getting this done quickly and quietly."
Saxton, who had witnessed the entire scene, was as pale as a ghost. He knew Harry had gone through so much more than this, but this scene sickened him. Harry was slumped on the floor, a sickly green color. Saxton peered closer, and noticed how dead inside he had seemed. There was no life left in those eyes, no more fight. It was as if all hope had been sucked out of the child. Knowing the horrific memory was over, he drank a grey potion he had stored in his pocket, pulling him back into the present.
Severus Snape stood up, and walked out of his room, headed straight to the Headmaster's office. He knew something had been wrong with the old man, but now he had proof. He was sitting by, knowingly letting a child get abused. As he approached the door, he started getting more and more furious. "Sugar Quill." As the staircase forms, he climbed to the top, knocking forcefully on the door.
Harry sighed in understanding. "Neville, if you ever need anyone to talk to I'm here. It doesn't matter if I'm with Ron or Hermione or anyone else. You're more important than them. You can trust me. I know what you're going through." After that, there was a heavy silence.
"Harry! Where have you been? You missed all your classes today, and I heard Snape took you into his office this morning. He didn't yell at you, did he?" Hermione asked, apparently not noticing the tall sullen man behind Harry. "Wait a minute, you look so different! What's going on?" It was at this point she noticed that Harry was holding onto Snape's robes. Confusion flashed across her face as she began connecting the dots. She remembered how back in her muggle school, a kid was being abused, and a teacher took her out of class to talk. She remembered how small she had seemed. Realization dawned on her. "Oh Harry!! Why didn't you tell us?" She resisted the urge to fling her arms around him, not wanting to startle him.
"Er... I-I believe it was the 4 newt tails?" Neville's timid voice rang out across the deathly silent room.
Harry nearly snorted with laughter. "I don't because you always sabotage me. Well, you, Crabbe, and Goyle. But seriously Malfoy, it wasn't as horrible as I expected either. Well, until I nearly died. That wasn't pleasant, but at least I fulfilled my quota of one-near death experience per year."
Harry knelt by the grave,  his hands gently wrapping around the statue of his parents. "I miss you guys. I think about you every day. Thank you for saving me, and thank you for loving me." His eyes were overflowing with tears, and his voice was cracking miserably as he struggled to hold in the sobs that were threatening to break free. "I love you mum. I love you dad."
Snape led Harry out of the fireplace, heading straight towards the desk. He quickly checked a sign on top of it, but not finding what he was looking for. He turned towards the woman. "We need to see a mind healer and a regular healer as well. I just adopted my son out of an abusive household and want to assess the damage, but I don't seem to see which floor that is on." The receptionist nodded briskly, and consulted a chart next to her.
Harry felt the grin slide off of his face. "No reason Malfoy. Let's go hand it in." They both filled up a vial and marked it, and left it on Snape's desk. As they were walking past Neville's cauldron on the way back, they heard an ominous hissing sound. Harry made eye contact and immediately understood the situation. He yelled at everyone to get down, but Malfoy was too busy gloating about the perfect potion to anyone that would listen. Taking a deep breath, Harry flung himself at Malfoy, knocking him down to the ground, getting the full blast of the potion when it exploded.
Snape watched the group with a large smile spread across his face. He had never seen him this carefree. He vowed to himself to make his little ray of sun shine every day. No matter how hard things may get, seeing Harry smile had given him hope. For the first time in years, both Snape and Harry were content.
"Relax Neville, I'm perfectly fine. I just got to rest instead of go to class. No big deal. I am in there all the time. Just next time, make sure to double check the ingredients. I don't want anyone else getting hurt, I'm used to it." The truth was, Harry was actually hurting. His back hurt from where he took the blast. He just didn't want Madam Pomfrey fussing over him, and he definitely did not want her looking at his back. That's the one thing she never saw, because if she did, she would know. No one could know. There was only two people in this room other than him that knew... Neville... and Dumbledore. He looked up and met his icy gaze. Slowly looking away, his sights rested upon the group of Slytherins. He had to admit they were amazing people to have around. He just hoped they would stay around. Sighing, he got up and left the Great Hall, and headed up to the dormitory, mumbling the password. "Briarwood." The portrait opened and he climbed into the common room. Climbing the stairs, he walked into the dormitory to find it empty. He crawled into bed, hoping the dreams wouldn't come back. However, he was not so lucky. The moment he fell asleep, it all started.
"Yes, I do. Harry, just because you have damage, doesn't mean you're damaged or broken. It just makes you unique and wonderful. Even after everything you've gone through, you managed to trust new people. You aren't broken Harry. You never have been." Snape rested his arm gently on Harry's shoulder. "After this, would you like to go visit your parents' grave?"
Before Harry could say anything, he was led inside the sweet smelling shop. Harry's eyes grew wide, looking at all the bright colors and fun shapes. Upon seeing Snape's nod to go ahead, he proceeded to fill up a bag with a little bit of everything except the acid pops and blood pops. Snape's smile grew wider with each thing grabbed. He didn't care how expensive this would be. He would pay so much more if only Harry would remain this joyful and carefree. Before too long, they checked out, and started heading towards the castle.
Ron nodded, satisfied with that answer. "Harry, is it alright if we head up to bed? I want you to have some time with your father, and Ma-Draco tonight." He caught himself. He knew Harry needed as many friends as he could get, as much love as possible. He didn't want Harry to worry about what they thought about Draco, if he helped Harry, he was good in his books. Hermione felt the same way.
Pansy flushed, her face turning a shade of red to rival Ron's. "I don't stare at Blaise! And... Hey! You didn't answer my question! Why did you manage to notice that Draco has a serious apple obsession? Wait... have you been watching him?" Pansy's grin widened, happy to be able to throw off the Golden Boy.
Both of the grown men chuckled at that. Saxton opened up the pot and grabbed a bit of cotton, dipping it into the substance. "Okay, deep breath Harry. This will hurt a little." He waited for Harry's nod of consent before gently dabbing the medicine onto his wounds. Harry visibly tensed up underneath him, but not a sound was heard. Saxton frowned but kept his mind on his task. He knew Harry was being quiet due to his upbringing. He personally knew it wasn't pleasant, and it did hurt a bit. "Okay Harry. All done."
Draco stood and made his way to the door, intending on wandering around until he ran into his godfather. He quickly slipped out and into the common room, vowing he'd make the old man pay for all that he watched Harry go through. Nothing would hurt Harry ever again, not if Draco could help it.
"Yes... if it wasn't for him, I would've gotten hit. He knocked me over when I wasn't paying attention. I was too busy bragging... This is my fault."
Pure terror flooded the child's face. Saxton looked up into the enormous purple face of the man he finally figured was Vernon Dursley.
Honestly, life has been extremely hectic. I also do not have internet so I am typing this and posting it by phone. My spouse and I moved into our own place and now have a dog named Mocha who is content only when getting constant attention by knocking my phone out of the way when I'm on it. I'm sorry it's been so long and I can't promise frequent updates but this is my holiday gift to you all. Thank you so much for your support!
"I see at least four apples in here. You're lying about it, which proves you have a problem. Draco, we are here to help you. Even Harry was worried." Blaise stated simply.
"Draco, you have a serious apple addiction. Harry pointed it out to me. You always have an apple on you. Normally that wouldn't be too bad, but you've started taking all of them for yourself. None of the other students can have any because of your problem." Pansy's voice rang out, stern.
Snape, who had been watching this, ready to jump in if needed, finally spoke up. "Actually Harry, it wasn't me. Draco came to me last night. He told me his concerns. I wanted to look into it because I take this stuff seriously. I can't stand by and watch anything like this happen. Draco was the one who told me. He was scared for you. I know sometimes he's a brat, but he's a really good kid. He cares about his friends deeply."
"Wait, Draco told you? I didn't know that... Dad, can we thank him? Please? I was so scared when he found out, I was scared someone would hurt me. Now I'm safe thanks to him and to you." Harry peered at Snape, eyes watery.
"He's coming. I passed him on my way down. You will have to save your flying for later." Parkinson was grinning. "Also, for the time being, call me Pansy. I think it will throw Draco off enough for him to lower his guard. Blaise is walking down with him."
Blaise stood, and headed for the dormitory door to seek Pansy out. Draco quickly followed behind him, but unexpectedly ran straight into Blaise, who had paused in front of Pansy. Blaise grabbed Pansy's hand, and pulled her into the dormitory, with Draco groaning slightly, following in pursuit. "Pansy. We need to tell you something about Harry."
Snape bowed. "Thank you so much. We both are incredibly grateful for this. I actually had planned on taking him to Mungos. We will head out now." Turning to Lucius he smiled. "Thank you Lucius. I don't know what I would have done without your help." Both he and Harry left the room, headed straight to the fireplaces. "Harry, do you want to go by yourself?"
"You idiotic boy! It was newt eyes! Malfoy, help me get him to the hospital wing. Everyone else, bottle up your potions and put them on my desk. Granger, please put the exploded potion in one as well, just in case we need to identify it." With that, Harry was supported by Malfoy and Snape and swept out of the room. Ron made eye contact with Hermione. "Was it just me or did Malfoy seem worried to you?"
Harry blushed, never having felt that kind of affection before. He soaked it up. It made him feel safe. He slowly opened his eyes, only to see Draco's looking at him. He smiled a kind smile.
Harry gasped, and ran as fast as he could to the table. "Pans! Blay!" He held his arms out, demanding a hug from them too. They happily obliged, a little shocked at both his behavior and his small fragile body. They saw what Draco meant by acting younger and felt a bit out of their element. They reminded themselves that this was their friend, and they love him no matter what. No matter how badly he pronounced their names, he was still their friend Harry.
Harry opened his eyes, looking around. It took him a moment to realize what had happened. Staying quiet, he looked towards Saxton who appeared to be waking up as well. He looked visibly shaken, and quite pale.
Harry figured that was coming, so he quickly removed his shirt, showing him the massive amount of scars and cuts, some still fresh. "They really hurt a lot of the time. I wear glamours to cover up the problems that my clothing doesn't cover." He waved his wand, breaking down the complicated glamours, letting Snape see the real damage.
Harry had to admit he had never seen Malfoy up close, without either of them attacking each other. He took this time to study his rival. His eyes, which he had always seen as grey, were more of a silvery blue. He quickly turned away, before Malfoy could notice him staring, and began handing ingredients when asked. Before too long, the potion was perfect. Harry couldn't hide the massive grin that spread across his face. However, he didn't hide it in time. Malfoy had turned to say something, and noticed his smile.
Draco understood the dismissal. "Goodnight." He returned to his bed, leaving Snape simmering in thoughts until daybreak.
Harry was deposited on a bed in the infirmary, and Madam Pomfrey bustled out of her room, demanding to know what happened. Snape immediately filled her in. He then proceeded to ask to be excused, as he had to go clean up the classroom. Malfoy, however, stayed behind.
"Come on, let's go down to the kitchen. My old house elf Dobby is in there! He can get us something to eat." Draco began leading the way down to the painting.
Snape tilted Harry's head to look at him. "Its okay son. I just want to keep you safe. Lets go inside."
"Harry, have you used floo powder before?" Snape turned to look to the boy, who was still clutching his hand.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Don't worry, I will be fine. You go to bed. I will see you tomorrow." With that Draco left, walking down to the dungeons. He was turning the corner when he ran face to face into the person he was looking for. "Hello godfather. I need to talk to you."
They all walked back to the castle together, laughing and joking as if they never hated each other. They didn't know why they hated each other in the first place. Pansy was awesome, and she wasn't afraid to call anybody out. Blaise was quieter, but he was calculating. He was the voice of reason. And Draco was... Draco. He was a quiet flame that burns brighter in the face of the wind, full of life. And he was beautiful, not that Harry would ever admit thinking that. He had to remind himself he was just in it for the apples, which he had to admit were absolutely worth the wait. He could understand Draco's obsession after eating one. When they reached the Great Hall, they nodded once to each other, a solemn but silent promise that they would hang out again at some point, because despite the fact they spent a few years hating each other they all fit together well and enjoyed themselves. They went their separate ways, Harry to the Gryffindor table, and the trio to the Slytherin.
Behind Draco, Blaise and Pansy watched on, unsure if Harry would want to see them too. Pansy cautiously spoke up. "Hi Harry. How are you feeling?"
"Ready Harry?" Severus looked down at Harry, worry etched on his face. Upon receiving a nod, he began the trek to the grave he'd been to so many times. It took merely minutes, but to Harry it felt like hours.
"Ooh! There he is! I see him!" Harry was grinning with excitement, pulling Snape right after him. He stopped right before crashing into the tall man. "Hello Mister!!"
Draco paced endlessly around his dormitory, wondering what happened to Harry. Blaise, who had long given up on trying to get any information out of the boy, watched with slight frustration.
Harry turned towards Draco with a large smile. "'raco!" He squirmed to get down, wanting to say hi to his friends. He toddled over to Draco and gave a big smile. "Tank you 'raco."
Severus nodded quickly, and he stood with Harry to leave. "Thank you for your help, Mister Saxton. We'll be back then."
Harry stopped, and looked at Snape. "Really? Do you mean it? Please dad, please!" Harry was practically bouncing with excitement.
"They do look good." Draco smiled before grabbing one, but his thoughts were more troubled. He knew something was going on with Harry, but he wasn't sure if he should ask. They hadn't been friends for very long. He took a sip of the milk, deep in thought.
Awe showed on Harry's face. Never once has someone cared about what Harry wanted. Decisions were always made without him, but today he got choices. He actually got GOOD choices. Harry relaxed, and stepped forward. "I think I'm okay to talk about it dad. I don't want to lie or hide anymore. I want people to know what happened." He turned more towards his friends. "I haven't been fully honest with you, but not out of want. I was scared. I know I told you my uncle was harsh. I told you he would yell at me, but I lied when you asked if he ever hit me. He did. A lot. I don't want to go into details if that's okay." Hermione was crying, her hand over her mouth. Ron looked on in stunned silence, afraid to react to his anger as not to scare Harry.
"The mind healers appear to be on the fourth floor. I should make a note to put on the sign for future reference. Thank you for bringing that to my attention, sir. Have a nice day!"
"What was your dream about Harry? Maybe talking about it will help." Draco had a small feeling of uneasiness that grew when he saw Harry trying to avoid his gaze. He knew something was wrong.
The child scrambled to his feet, running to a door under the staircase. He quickly pulled it open, before throwing himself on his cot, obviously fearing a beating.
Blaise stood and walked to his friend, who had frozen in his tracks upon realizing his voice had betrayed him. He swiftly hugged him, and felt Draco break down. Within seconds, Blaise's shirt was soaked with Draco's tears. "Draco, can you please tell me what's going on? I've never seen you this worried."
Snape let out a small chuckle at his soon-to-be son's antics. He swiftly picked up the boy, settling him on his hip. He frowned slightly, noticing his weight. After the change of guardianship, this boy was going to Mungos. He weighed about the same as a five year old child. Considering he was thirteen, that was horrible. "You ready Harry? Hold on tight, don't let go." He walked over to the fireplace, and threw a handful of the glittering powder into the fireplace. "Ministry of Magic." With a whoosh, they both were swept away, landing in the immaculate building. Snape set Harry down, ignoring his protests. "I've gotta put you down. You can still hold my hand if you want to." Thinking to himself, he actually thought that would be a good idea. He wasn't sure who to trust here. Anyone could try to snatch Harry and get away with it. "Now, Lucius said he was on second floor. After we meet up with him, we will go to the fourth floor, okay?"
Saxton swiftly nodded. "Provided he doesn't live with them anymore, his healing should begin quickly. Now, it is possible something might trigger him, and cause him to regress rapidly and be terrified. In those instances, it is best to identify the triggers and prevent it from happening again, as best as possible. To calm him down during that, get him to a safe place. Nowhere too enclosed, as his abuse involved a cupboard, but somewhere cozy that he knows is his safe space."
Draco came in his mouth after a shamefully short time. Harry didn't care. He licked him clean and shiny with saliva, then stood up, his mouth an inch from Draco's.
"Surprisingly, that sounds less dizzying compared to being responsible for your whole body, your pain, your pleasure, your mental well-being..."
One day in early November, Harry looked around his house. He found some half-empty packs of cigarettes and realised that he hadn't smoked one since July. He didn't spend much time here anymore.  Even on nights when he came home late at night, or early in the morning from work, he didn't sleep here anymore. He came home to Draco, and often found him asleep on the sofa in the living room. As if he had been waiting for Harry. He was never upset about being woken up in the middle of the night, or about sleeping on an uncomfortable surface, or about Harry having such a dangerous job that obviously worried him even though he always hid it. He would just hold Harry and say "let's go to bed".
"From memory, our parents didn't want us around Malfoy Manor much mostly because Lucius was fucking terrifying."
"And you're nice. And what you do helps others. Okay, it was out of selfish need, but who marketed the Orbs to hospitals? Who agreed to produce them for other affected families when the doctors asked you to? Who's giving a load of money to the hospital so they can continue the research?"
, he really needs to stop thinking these thoughts if he wants to avoid an erection. That would only make the situation more embarrassing and awkward then it already is.
Harry pinks slightly, but their food arrives before he can say anything else. Draco takes a bite of his oysters and moans, just a little, at the taste. Harry blushes even more.
“Do you want breakfast?” Draco asks, murmuring into Harry’s mouth. He feels rather than sees the nod in response. Lips curving into a smile, he pulls Harry up. “Come on, then. Shower first, then get dressed.”
Draco takes the day off, which he really should not have done, because all it does is give himself more time to stress over the date. He spends the hours leading up to it pacing the living room and changing his outfit every ten minutes.
They trade letters like this for the rest of the week. Draco begins to look forward to seeing Athena’s regal form swooping out his window, and takes to leaving it open. No point in closing it just to open it back up twenty minutes later.
They dance with each other at the reception, whirling around with the other guests. “That’ll be us soon enough,” Harry murmurs, looking towards his best mates. The newly wedded Mr. and Mrs. Granger-Weasley twirls on the dance floor, oblivious to the rest of the people, eyes only for each other.
Turns out Potter is one of those unlucky souls that found themselves suddenly unable to touch anyone. Despite this, he decided that he loved Weasley so much, he was willing to stay with her and eventually proposed to her a year later. But apparently, Weasley wasn’t as willing and broke it off barely a week after the proposal. A part of Draco that wasn’t a complete prick winces at this harsh behavior, but the small part of him that always thrilled at catching Potter’s attention throws a small party in his head. Potter only has one other relationship listed, a Muggle man, but that had ended just over a year ago. Which means Potter is now single. Draco’s mind wanders, fantasizing about Harry Potter, as it’s wont to do. Maybe their schoolboy rivalry had been a front for their burning passion for each other. It certainly had been on Draco’s side. Maybe it was the same for Potter.
“Mmm, yes, I do know. I like the thought of my body fluids on you. Marks you as mine,” Draco responds.
“No, you didn't overstep,” says Harry. “It’s just - I haven’t been able to kiss anyone magical since the war. I don’t - I don’t know if I’ll be able to kiss you.”
Harry looks soft, and strangely vulnerable, his face relaxed in sleep. His mouth is open slightly, but no drool, and he snores softly. His hair looks floppy and sleep-tousled, and so, so soft. Draco reaches out a hand and strokes it, not quite believing that this is his. That this wonderful, perfect man who’s stolen Draco’s heart returns his feelings. He closes his eyes and smiles to himself. When he opens them again, Harry’s eyes watch his own.
Harry takes him out on more dates; movies, dinner, even a stroll in a botanical garden. That date was cut short by a sudden onslaught of rain, but they made it back to Harry’s place and spent the evening in bed, so it wasn’t completely ruined.
“Don’t get too cocky, now,” smirks Draco. “I said I’ve never met someone I was interested in, so I didn’t date. I’ve still had my fair share of one-night stands.”
“Relax, Mione,” Harry placates. “Your wedding isn’t for another three months. Besides, it’ll be amazing.” This, he’s sure of. How can it not be? Not only are Ron and Hermione planning it, but Molly and Luna are helping as well. As a professional wedding planner, Luna has great (if a little unusual) ideas and Harry has never known Molly to organize anything and fail.
The following pages described, in detail, Potter’s relationships. Draco wasn’t surprised to see Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley on Potter’s list, but he was taken aback when he saw Cedric Diggory. He scanned the pages until he found Diggory’s, which was only half a page long. Apparently, Potter had a brief fling with the Hufflepuff during his fourth year.
In his defense, Malfoy looks incredible. All of his clothes are tight, clinging to his body in a way that leaves no room for imagination. His hair is longer now, hanging past his shoulders, half of it swept up in a neat little bun. Harry can instantly see himself stroking his fingers through that white-blond hair, taking the bun apart, tugging on a strand of hair while Malfoy kisses him, moaning as-
The kiss is soft and languid. Slow. They have all the time in the world right now, and they use it to get to know each other. Harry’s tongue laps at his, and Draco bites his lip, tugging softly.
Draco smirks and flicks his wand, concealed inside a sleeve, drying Harry out. “Cleaning charms, Po - Harry. Ever heard of them?”
Feeling just a tiny bit intrusive, Draco quickly casts the spell to gather a sample of Potter’s magical signature and watches it float towards him, invisible to everyone else. To his surprise, it isn’t an obnoxious Gryffindor red, but instead a soft green that Draco instinctively knows matches Potter’s eyes, tinged with red and yellow. Bottling it up in a vial he procures from a pocket, Draco Disapparates back to his office.
But Harry only works four hours a day, even if he does work all week. There's only so much he can do, and whenever he gets bored, properly bored, that’s when he misses the Wizarding World the most. Well, one thing in particular: flying. It had always taken his mind off of whatever problem he was worrying about. Hermione, exasperated with his whining, had finally suggested running.
“Good morning, Potter,” says Malfoy. He looks calm, almost comfortable, as if he visits Muggle cafes all the time. Hell, maybe he does. Muggle places come with the convenience of nobody knowing who you are.
Harry laughs. “Yeah, I just might!” He spots a shock of white-blond hair in the distance, but it disappears before he can get a close look. Hermione’s right - he really will give himself a headache if he doesn’t stop seeing things.  “How have the wedding preparations been going?” asks Harry, determined to put Malfoy out of his mind.
Draco snorts at the irony of it all. “Really? I’ve technically had one on you since we were twelve, I just didn’t realize it until fourth year.” A thought strikes him. “But you proposed to Ginevra. You almost got engaged.”
Draco nods again. “Tomorrow, Potter.” Draco ducks out of the cafe with a smile on his face and sips his coffee. It tastes like happiness, which Draco didn’t even know had a taste. Nevertheless, Draco thinks of Potter the entire day, and even though all he does is paperwork, he can’t help but smile the whole time.
“I didn’t know Potter liked men,” Draco murmured to himself. “Figures he would.” After all, Potter had been the reason Draco started questioning his own sexuality. Well, no, Draco pretty much
“Harry’s right, Mione,” says Ron. “It’ll be fine. Besides, I’ll be right here beside you through it all.” He squeezes her hand and she smiles at him.
Draco absentmindedly smiles to himself as he feeds Harry’s owl. He fetches some parchment and a quill, and starts penning a reply.
They share a kiss, sweet and unhurried, before Harry leaves for work, Draco promising to drop by later.
Speaking of friends, Harry introduces Draco to his a few days after their first date. Granger accepts his stiff apology with good grace, forgiving him immediately, but Weasley is a harder nut to crack. Finally, after an hour’s worth of observation, he sighs and tells Draco the only reason he forgives him is because he can tell how happy Draco makes Harry. Draco lets go of a breath he didn’t even realize he was holding. But, surprisingly, Weasley’s approval is important to him.
Draco shoves those thoughts out of his head. They were ridiculous anyways. No man nursing a crush on his rival would propose to his longtime girlfriend. Instead of thinking about it, Draco concentrates on getting his job done. He crosses the tiny office to where a large map of England hangs on the wall. It was enchanted to show where his current client would be, and right now, a small golden dot labeled “Harry Potter'' was shown in a Muggle park Draco visited often. Well, Draco thinks to himself, better sooner than later. And the quicker I find Potter’s soulmate, the quicker I can forget about him. Draco makes a quick pit stop at his house to change into a Muggle outfit and Apparates to the park.
Draco’s not quite sure what he expected when he thought about dating Harry Potter. Public outcry in the papers, maybe, but so far no one knows about them, aside from their friends.
They get a small booth near the windows overlooking the busy London streets. Harry orders a bottle of wine for the both of them, a strange Muggle brand Draco doesn’t recognize.
“Yes,” gasps Harry. Draco grips him tighter. Not bothering to waste time fumbling with his keys, he Apparates them directly to his bedroom.
Draco shrugs. “I’m gay. I’ve known since I was five. My father wasn’t very accepting of it back then, though he’s mellowed out a bit under Mother’s influence, but I still wasn’t allowed to see other boys.” Draco swallows another sip of wine.
“Smartass. Anyway, why do you work in a Muggle cafe? Surely Wizarding businesses would hire you.” Draco doesn’t sound condescending, instead genuinely curious, and Harry shrugs.
The bell chimes and Harry calls out a greeting. “Welcome to Hydrangea! I’ll be right with you.” He caps the lid on the drink, and turns to hand it to the waiting customer, who murmurs a thanks before walking out. Harry moves to greet the customer who just entered, but his words die on his lips.
Of all the people in Wizarding England, why Harry Potter? Last time Draco checked, Potter had been dating the Weasley girl. In fact, he distinctly remembered an article in the Daily Prophet featuring their engagement.
Draco sniffs. “Those were a gag gift from Blaise. I’ve been meaning to throw them out, but…” But they’re comfortable, he didn’t add. There’s really no need for Harry to know he sometimes lazed about the house in those sweats.
, Draco decides. He’ll start with something small, maybe a drink with some friends. No, that wouldn’t do; Harry might get the wrong impression and think Draco’s just being friendly. Draco shakes his head.
Draco’s stupidly grateful for the subject change. He hates having to talk about his complicated feelings. “Really? I haven’t heard of it.”
They make their way to a small, empty side road, and Harry offers Draco his arm again, Apparating them back to Draco’s house. Harry opens his mouth, then closes it and bites his lip. Sensing his hesitation, Draco steps in. “Are you going to kiss me goodnight?”
Satisfied, Draco rolls the letter up and ties it to the owl’s leg, watching her take off, soaring in the direction of Harry’s house. She returns with a reply soon after.
“Malfoy, wait!” Draco turns around, butterflies in his stomach. Potter scratches at his head. “Will I see you tomorrow?” he blurts out.
Draco blushes and nods, first hesitantly, then more firmly. Potter, Draco’s pleased to note, blushes as well.
“Besides, when was the last time you even thought about dating, Draco? It’s not healthy to be alone for so long,” Pansy continues.
Sighing to himself, Draco flipped through the file, examining the contents. The first page listed all of Potter’s vital information: his physical appearances, job description, former relationships, etc.
“Yes, that-” Harry adds another finger, twisting slightly. Draco gasps at the sensation. “That feels good.” Harry scissors his fingers slowly, stretching Draco open. But it’s not enough. “Come on, Harry, I’m not going to break. Give me more.”
to date, it’s just like he told Ron: the disappointment would crush him if he goes on a date and it ends badly. Where is that infamous Gryffindor courage when he needs it? “I need to clear my head,” Harry growls to himself. “I think I’ll go out for a run.”
“No, don’t do that, Harry!” says Hermione, and she actually looks a bit distraught. “You should bring an actual date.”
Things die down a little near the end of his shift, half an hour before it ends, and there’s only one customer in the cafe. The customer in question had ordered something simple, iced coffee and a donut, despite being a teenager. Teenagers, Harry had come to find, love to order ridiculously complicated drinks that never fail to confuse him. Why does it matter that their coffees have to have so many fancy syrups in them? What’s wrong with good old fashioned cream and sugar?
Yeah, nope. This file was definitely supposed to be there. The file had everything it was supposed to: the name of the client, the name of the Cupid, that stupid bow and arrow logo at the top right-hand corner of the paper. (Remember when Draco said he liked his job? There are a few things he
Malfoy pays, and their fingers brush when Harry hands him the drink, sending a thrill through Harry. Malfoy murmurs a low thank you that goes directly to Harry’s dick. He turns to go, and almost reaches the door when Harry blurts out, “Malfoy, wait!” He turns and stares expectantly, the picture of cool nonchalance, but his face is tinged light pink. “Will I see you again tomorrow?”
Harry grins. “Yeah, their food is spectacular. Ron found this place, actually, and I’ve been dying to share it with someone.”
Draco has a good job. He works for the Ministry, which isn’t surprising, but he always thought that he would end up in Magical Law Enforcement or International Magical Cooperation. He never expected to be working for the Department of Mysteries. And certainly not with the Department of Love (aka Cupid’s Arrow).
Draco takes a deep breath, then casts the final spell, which works a little bit like Felix Felicis, influencing the ones under the spell to do whatever needed to be done. He feels the charm settle around him like a warm blanket, and knows somewhere else in London, the same spell settles over Potter.
“Welcome to Hydrangea! I’ll be right with you.” The voice sounds familiar, and when the barista turns around, Draco realizes why. Because, of course, it’s Harry Potter.
Harry laughs, and the rest of their date sails on smoothly. They make small talk, about Harry's job, their respective friends, and Draco's mother. Finally, they finish their food and prepare to leave.
Draco laughs. “If someone had told me six years ago that I would be dating Harry Potter, I’d have punched them in the face and threw a party afterward.”
Draco Apparates back to his office, clutching the bottle of Potter’s magical signature. He unstoppers it and pours the contents into a small Pensieve. Draco leans back and stares at it for a few minutes. A person’s magical signature is very unique, but Draco’s never seen one like Potter’s. It radiates caring and bravery and absolutely pulses with so much love it’s almost blinding. And he can tell all this from just glancing at it.
Draco walks around a bit, trying to look around for Potter without looking too suspicious. He must succeed because no one shoots him any weird looks. He eventually spots Potter standing under a tree, chatting with Granger and Weasley. (Or is it Weasley and Weasley? Draco doesn’t know if they’re married yet, but from the way they’re standing, it’s clear they’re still together.)
The kiss is hungry and desperate, all of their longing and want poured into the action. Harry pushes Draco against the door and Draco pulls him in, grabbing and touching. Fingers tug at hair and trail over skin, dipping below shirts. Tongues battle in their mouths, licking and biting, exploring each other.
For the third time this afternoon, Draco recalls Harry’s wide-eyed look when he asked after Harry's relationship status, and smirks. Obviously, Draco already knew Harry was single, but
“Yes, yes, Harry, just like that. Merlin, you feel so good inside of me,” babbles Draco, unable to keep quiet.
Harry had told him to dress casually, which Draco’s a little grateful for, because he definitely would’ve thrown on a suit or something else of that nature. But even with a dress code, he has a hard time choosing an outfit. Finally, desperate, he sends an owl to Pansy.
What if? Maybe he does need someone to love him. Someone to take care of him. Someone to take care of. Draco can see it all in his head: coming home from work and being greeted by a handsome man, who kisses him on the cheek and asks how his day was. They’d eat dinner, and maybe afterward-
Harry breaks out in a grin. “Alright then, Draco.” Maybe it’s a bit cliched, but he likes the way the name fits in his mouth.
Potter turns around and gets to work making Draco’s coffee, while Draco studiously avoids ogling Potter’s ass. Obviously, he fails, because Potter turns back around and Draco ends up staring at his crotch instead. Ripping his gaze away from Potter’s goods, he pays for the drink and moves to take it. Potter’s fingers brush against his when Draco takes the drink, and he almost shivers at the touch. Draco heads for the door and is almost out when Potter’s voice stops him.
Harry smiles. Pulling the blanket over them both, he tucks Draco in close. “Go to sleep, Draco,” he murmurs, pressing a kiss to his forehead. It feels nice in a way he hasn’t felt in a long time,  and Draco drifts off, content.
Draco blushes at the thought. The picture Pansy paints does sound tempting, but it’s impossible. “Pansy, I can’t have a boyfriend, I told you that when I accepted the job at the Ministry.”
out, Harry? Not that I’m not enjoying this, or thrilled at your request, but I rather thought you didn’t like me.”
Draco stews over what Pansy said while filling out the forms. He doesn't need anybody to feel complete. He never has. It’s always been enough to just have his friends. But what if Pansy was right?
After his break-up with Ginny, Harry had pretty much ignored most of the Wizarding World and retreated to the Muggle one. He bought a flat in Muggle London, because he couldn’t bear to live with all of the memories Grimmauld Place was riddled with, and had Hermione help him charm his new space so the Muggle appliances would still work with all his wards and magic.
He leads Harry to the bathroom, and they take turns showering. Harry suggests showering together, but stops once he sees how small Draco’s shower is. When they finish, Draco lends Harry a shirt and a pair of sweatpants.
Harry bites his lip. “Well, I didn’t realize I liked you until after Ginny broke up with me. In fact, she was the reason I figured it out.” Draco makes a soft noise of interest, and Harry reluctantly expounds on his comment.
Harry is having a good day. Really, he is. He woke up in a great mood and arrived at work with an even better one. The cafe had its usual Friday morning rush, but it was a comfortable haze, just busy enough to keep Harry occupied, but not too stressful.
. She has so many things to do already I’m surprised she hasn’t collapsed yet, what with that and wedding planning on top of her already stressful job.”
The wine arrives and they order. “I’ll have chicken parmesan,” Harry tells the waiter. He leans toward Draco. “You should try the oysters with garlic sauce. I think you’ll really like it.”
Harry hasn’t bothered trying to date another Muggle after that. Simon hadn’t exactly been the brightest crayon in the box, but if he had cottoned on that quickly, then others surely would as well. Harry hasn’t been on a date for over a year, and since one night stands aren’t really his thing, it’s been even longer since his last shag.
Twenty minutes, several outfits, and one argument over eyeliner later, Draco is finally ready. Pansy leaves, smugly declaring her job done and makes him promise to give her all the details after.
Potter’s soulmate.” He sits down abruptly and giggles, overcome with giddy. Now, it makes sense how much Potter’s signature revealed to him. They were soulmates. Perfect halves of each other. Potter’s signature sensed his signature and could tell that instantly.
“Yes, romantically. You want somebody to come home to. Someone who cooks you breakfast in the mornings and has supper waiting for you on the table when you come home. A boyfriend, or a doting husband type.”
, and they haven’t bumped into each other for years, but he shows up the day after Harry kept thinking about him, b: he shows up
by the time he got to Hogwarts, but the hot, prickly feelings that followed Potter’s appearance pretty much confirmed it.
See, sometimes a person’s magical signature can change under certain circumstances. However, the circumstances are vastly different from changes in a Patronus. Patronus changes are widely influenced by feelings or a change in a person’s relationships. Changes in magical signature often had to do with a life-changing event (often traumatic), or drastic changes in personality.
How do you get ready for a date with the most famous wizard in all of England, no, the world? The Boy-Who-Lived-Twice, the Chosen One, the guy you’ve been crushing on since you were a teenager? The guy who, also, happens to be your soulmate?
“I was very obsessed with you after the war; I saved every magazine and newspaper clipping mentioning you. Gin and I had this fight after we broke up. I wanted to get back together, thought I could make her see reason, but she told me she was sick of my obsession with you. One of the last things she yelled at me before storming away was ‘Since you love Draco Malfoy so much, maybe you should go propose to him.’ It took me a while, but I finally figured out why that comment nagged at me so much.”
Draco spots a quaint little cafe named Hydrangea Coffee Shop not even five minutes after finishing his breakfast, and it strikes him suddenly that he forgot to order a coffee at Greg’s. One glance at his watch tells him that he still has plenty of time before he’s late, so he crosses the road and pushes into the cafe.
(Draco’s new employment had been what kept him out of Azkaban. The Wizengamot had agreed to let him walk free of all charges provided he found a stable job within a week. Privately, Draco thought they were certain he wouldn’t be able to find anyone willing to hire him, and could then chuck him in Azkaban. Unfortunately for them, the Department of Love sent him a letter of employment just a day after. It had been so satisfying to present that letter to the Wizengamot, and watch their faces crumple in disappointment.)
“They’re thinking about hyphenating. Hermione says she’s fine with taking Ron’s name, but he wants her to keep hers.”
Harry knows her well enough to know the question is for another purpose. What she really wants to know if Harry’s going to bring anyone, full stop. He scratches his head. “I don’t know, Mione. Who would I bring?” For a second, Harry remembers the pale blond head he saw earlier and thinks about Malfoy. But it’s a ridiculous thought. What would he even say? “Hey, I know we hate each other, except it turns out I don’t, I’ve actually had a subconscious crush on you since sixth year, wanna be my date to my best friends’ wedding (who you also hate)?” Harry snorts internally. Yeah, it is ridiculous. “I guess I can always ask someone to go with as friends.”
Malfoy shifts, and Harry realizes that he’d been spacing out. “Um, what would you like to order?” asks Harry, kicking himself for not speaking earlier. Now he looks like an even bigger dork.
They collapse on their sides, facing each other, Draco tracing patterns in the come on Harry’s chest, Harry stroking Draco’s hair out of his face.
Draco moves his mouth from Harry’s latching onto his neck. Harry moans happily, pushing him harder into the door. Pretty soon, a decently sized hickey blooms.
“Top drawer. Condoms, too,” breathes Draco. Harry grabs the small bottle of lube and a silvery packet of condoms. He rolls one onto himself with shaky fingers, then uncaps the lube. Pouring some onto his fingers, he slowly inserts one into Draco.
She smiles at him. “Thanks, Ron. I’m so glad I have the both of you,” she adds, swinging her head towards Potter, who smiles in return.
like about it. First and foremost on that list? The logo, featuring a curvy pink bow and a heart tipped arrow. The unofficial name of the department might be Cupid’s Arrow, but they didn’t use
“Okay, maybe I don’t have a soulmate. That doesn’t mean I want or need a boyfriend. I’m perfectly capable of functioning without one,” Draco huffs, biting into his sandwich.
“Not the most agreeable weather for a walk though,” Harry comments, glancing up at the overcast sky.
Harry yanks his pajama top off and pulls on a random t-shirt he grabs from his wardrobe and frowns. The shirt is a bit too small, but Harry can’t be bothered to change. Yanking on his joggers, Harry crosses to the door and breaks into a light jog, heading towards the nearest Muggle park.
“Oh - uh - good morning, Malfoy,” stammers Harry, who immediately kicks himself mentally, because that was horrible. Was he twelve again? One word from his crush and he’s reduced to a stuttering mess.
afterward, only coming out for meals, and some days not even that. She was withdrawn even after Father returned from Azkaban, though she did get better.
“Yes, I’ve heard of that. I’ve also heard rumors she plans to run for Minister next year. Is that true?”
reason, he can’t seem to touch anyone. Well, except for Muggles. Harry doesn’t have anything against dating Muggles, but it just isn’t the same as dating a wizard. For one, Harry constantly has to hide his magic from them, and he’s rubbish at lying. That’s why his last relationship failed so miserably. Harry constantly forgot to hide his magic and only just managed to catch himself every time he was about to draw his wand out and cast a spell. Simon had caught on to the fact that Harry was hiding something from him pretty quickly. Unfortunately, the Muggle had jumped to conclusions and assumed Harry was cheating on him and had broken up with him quite dramatically two months into the relationship.
Harry chuckled at Draco’s dramatics; glad to see he still had it in him after their last meeting. “True, you might have done better in Ravenclaw, at least you wouldn’t have had to lower your I.Q. while speaking to Crabbe and Goyle; and blue’s not a bad color.”
Neville's chuckle turned into a hearty laugh that kicked Draco's sneer up several notches. "It can't really turn you into stone Draco, the perfume from the blooms can temporarily paralyze you though. I was curious if it was only the perfume or if the flower and perhaps its' seeds had the same effect. Would you be willing to try brewing a potion with them Draco? I also just got in some new rare aquatic species, but I haven't finished researching all their possible uses. If I give you a list could you see if any have medicinal properties?"
Draco rolled his eyes. “Trading favors? What’s next Potter, bribes? I knew the Ministry was corrupt.”
Harry took a moment to word his response; worried that Hermione thought he’d become obsessive over Malfoy like he’d been accused of during their days at Hogwarts. “I know you meant well when you stepped in to help Hermione, and I do appreciate the help, but I wish you’d talk to me more before you start ordering everyone around; especially me. I’m sorry if it seemed like I wasn’t concerned with my other work after Malfoy was attacked, but it was our first break in the attackers current pattern and I was really hoping it would mean we were close to catching them.”
Harry chose not to argue the point, figuring pushing Hermione right now would only cause more unneeded strain. She'd promised him a few days of protection for Malfoy, but that didn't mean he couldn't keep the extra wards going until the attackers were caught. He'd just have to work even harder following the leads Hermione had for him and finish tracking down all the Voldemort supporters who had escaped imprisonment. It was days like these when he was relieved he wouldn't have Ginny breathing down his neck about never being home.
"So how long do you think before the next attack Harry?" Minister Hermione Granger asked as the two sat comfortably in her office the next morning.
“Sorry mate, I haven’t had nearly enough to drink for this discussion. I’ll see you both this Friday for dinner, right?” Harry asked, getting a scowl from Ron at the clear abandonment and a nod from Hermione.
"Yes, though as for your question on whether or not they learned how to create bombs in the military I can't be so sure of. These parts are cheap, a plastic kitchen timer, household grade wires, it's all available at your local hardware store. This tells me even if they were in the military they're not using miliary grade components, which would be much easier to trace. Also, not every person who joins the military learns how to make and use explosives like these, that's a very specific branch with a limited number of people. Sadly over the years the knowledge has leaked to the public and flooded the internet, nowadays you can learn how to build a bomb from household materials as easily as you can learn how to unclog a toilet," Mr. Denton replied with a rueful shake of his head.
“Fine Potter, just a bit crowded for my tastes. I prefer not to be elbowed unnecessarily,” Draco replied, purposefully forcing his hands to relax.
Hours later with a half eaten sandwich that lay forgotten on the coffee table, Draco felt exhaustion drag at his eyelids. Glancing at the clock proved it to be nearly midnight and he swore quietly under his breath. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d let himself get that absorbed in a book, let alone one on Quiddich. It had been years since he’d even kept up on who was playing, or played himself. Draco supposed if things had gone differently at the end of his time at Hogwarts he may have considered a career as a professional Quiddich Seeker, but as things were there just wasn’t any call for an ex-Death Eater.
"Or they may very well move on and leave me alone. But even after five attacks you still know squat about them or what they'll do. Does that mean you're going to leave me and my family here then, hoping that they won't come back and try again?" Draco asked indignantly.
“Well, I’m done with it a any rate so it’s yours, and I’m not surprised, there’s hardly anything published about them during the season and I don’t know anyone who follows them regularly,” Draco answered, bending swiftly to pluck the book from the coffee table.
Harry laughed and squeezed Ron’s shoulders. “Don’t worry Ron, your wife can demand a gag order. Your purity will remain intact.”
“Only this past year once the symptoms started. Astoria’s known about it all her life, it sometimes skips a generation or two, like her mother, but it’s always fatal for those who get it,” Draco’s voice came out weak and shaky.
“Yeah, suppose I lost touch with a few of my housemates as well. I haven’t seen Neville since New Year’s, and even longer for Dean or Semus. I’m only able to keep up with Luna because of her articles in The Quibbler,” Harry sighed, wondering if that was why he’d felt so out of touch lately.
Harry leaned back, letting his headrest atop Hermione’s. “Yeah, I know I’ve said it before but I don’t know how I would have gotten through first year without you and Ron, let alone graduation.”
Diggle snatched up a piece of parchment and hurriedly handed it to Harry. "It was from the Minister Of Magic. See, she even signed it."
As was becoming quite usual, Draco’s response to his present came much quicker then Harry had expected it to. He’d read it twice over now while he was finishing his morning cup of coffee. Either Draco was that bored that he’d dove head first into the first distraction possible or the book had truly interested him that much.
“This feels really personal still, but I doubt it’s one person working alone and I doubt they’re very involved with the wizarding community because nobody is talking. The pure bloods are just as clueless and even those who work between the wizards and the muggles haven’t heard anything,” Harry said with a sigh.
"That's probably what saved you then, you're very lucky Malfoy. The other families had moved since the wars, there were no protections on their homes more complex than a heavy-duty locking spell on their doors. They were caught completely unprepared because they weren't attacked with magic," Harry replied.
Harry could practically feel the eye roll from Hermione accompanying her message and groaned at the obviousness. Unfortunately, soup was hardly going to help and if Draco wanted soup he had a house elf for that. Not to mention Draco may question the safety of anything coming from him in food form; honestly too risky.
Before Harry could ask anymore questions, Ron and all of the boys bustled up with their purchases and they stacked them on the counter for the smiling cashier as Harry fished out his wallet.
“Why choose to protect me Potter? I know the other Aurors have been called off and nobody thinks there will be a second attack, so why keep coming back?” Draco asked, his stormy grey eyes looking helpless and confused.
“Been awhile since we’ve done this, eh?” Ron said, as their kids eagerly crowded around the kitchen island for Uncle Harry’s breakfast.
Nearly 20 minutes later Harry had the entire top of the Medusa crown free of Draco's hair. "Alright Neville we're good here, now what?"
Harry scoffed at the idea of being a Seeker for Bulgaria, the entire team while they had admirable military like precision from their rigorous training, were in short-brutes. Their Beaters would just as soon hit your broom as they would the Bludgers and he’d seen their Seekers over the years dive bomb opposing players to disrupt them from scoring goals or knock them from their brooms. They wound up with a lot of penalties for their trouble and didn’t always win.
“No, Astoria has appointments she can’t miss that have been scheduled for months now,” Draco insisted.
“Sounds like this is more then just getting back at Voldemort’s followers. The agenda must be more broad, maybe a pure blood cleansing?” Harry replied.
Hermione quickly traded looks with Harry and they both stood up. Hermione put her arms around Ron’s waist, giving him a seductive look from under her lashes. “Until they learn we’re both coming home to you Ronald.”
“What if he’s not here?” Albus asked suddenly, the question catching Harry off guard as they piled the boy’s trunks onto a trolley.
Eventually the spinning slowed and the nausea Draco had felt abated and he forced himself to look at Harry. Concerned green eyes raked over him continuously and the hand that held his felt like a vice. A shiver of cold wracked his body and Harry hunched closer until Draco could feel him pressed from shoulder to hip along one side of him.
After a bit of strained silence Harry cleared his throat, “I know you’re getting pressure from people for answers regarding these attacks on the pure blood families Hermione. Like Ron said earlier, I know you’re stressed, but lately it seems as though I’m just another errand boy to you. You’re not even listening to my suggestions anymore and instead have completely taken control of the Aurours. You’ve cut me out of everything in my own department, I have to ask you for updates now.”
Hermione sighed heavily. “It’s not like the pure bloods didn’t attempt the same sort of thing years ago with the muggle borns and squibs. Now however they’re badly outnumbered, most of the families were decimated during the wars and those who remain are either children or grandparents.”
“I don’t think Harry means to ignore them Hermione, but it sounds like they’re building up to something. Maybe they have a final target in mind and if you’ve already got them under watch then I’d keep an eye out ‘cause they’re bound to strike again if they get an opportunity,” Ron said.
"I don't know that they are muggles, probably some group of witched and wizards who are hiding their magic so we can't trace it back to them," Harry replied.
Harry remembered those first few years with a wry chuckle. He and Ron had been nearly living at the ministry while starting as Aurors and Hermione had been bouncing around between several jobs, trying to figure out which one she liked best. It was two years into being an Auror when Ron had shambled into their shared office looking exhausted and grim. He'd sadly announced he couldn't do it anymore, that he'd been fooling himself this whole time and there was no way he was cut out for this line of work. He continued explaining how Hermione and he had gotten into several terrible rows these past few weeks over it all and she was threatening to end their courtship. Harry who'd barely managed four hours of solid sleep the night before stared blankly at him in shock. Ron had then broken down, tears flowing unchecked as he'd begged Harry not to be mad or disappointed with him. Of course, Harry hadn't been either of those things, more concerned that Ron was so distraught he looked ill as his best friend crumpled into a chair hiccuping and stammering his explanation. Ron had never really told Harry how much his support then had meant to him and how relieved he'd been when Harry had solemnly promised that he'd help him save his relationship with Hermione no matter what.
Harry watched satisfied as Hermione made a few more notes to her napkins before tucking back into her own forgotten meal. Although it wasn’t quite the break through everyone was hoping for, they’d exhausted all their other leads and had felt uselessly futile at keeping anyone else safe lately while more people died and the local wizarding community demanded action. He wondered briefly if he should tell Draco, but he wasn’t sure whether or not the man cared anymore. Draco certainly had larger, more pressing concerns at the moment.
"Once Astoria's parents apparated here I told them of my plans to send them all on holiday and except for some winery where Astoria's father had met her mother in Italy, there was no definitive itinerary. Scorpius has managed to send me two owls so far with brief descriptions of their trip, but the last one arrived over a week ago and I have no idea if they're still there or not," Draco replied,'
“So just because the tell her to, Granger is going to try running every aspect of The Ministry? How’s that going for her?” Draco asked with a roll of his eyes.
“Well, I can’t say it’s been quiet unfortunately. I have a strong feeling that since they couldn’t get to Malfoy they tried moving on to their other Death Eater targets only to find them heavily guarded, so they moved on to pure blood supporters. We’ve had four smaller attacks on business’ and homes where the people were half bloods who only married pure bloods or worked with them and were trying to up their blood status. It’s seemed rather random if you’re only reading the papers, they’re saying these attacks are due to copycats but the pure bloods are a small tight knit community, they know everyone and anyone who wants to be one. Thankfully they’re so scared right now so they’re not talking to the papers, they don’t want to draw any attention to themselves,” Hermione answered.
With that, Harry slung an arm around Ron’s shoulders while placing a loud smacking kiss on his cheek at the same moment Hermione captured Ron’s lips with her own.
“I was curious about that Quiddich book you offered to lend me. I have to admit I don’t know much about the American teams,” Harry replied, trying to seem as casual as possible even though the man had been on his mind solidly since lunch.
“Doesn’t take much when you haven’t drank in awhile ‘Mione. I wasn’t kidding when I said you and Harry needed a break,” Ron replied.
Harry’s brain seemed to come to a screeching halt, he wasn’t sure what he had expected Draco to say; honestly his behavior had baffled him. But his wife dying of an incurable curse made something twist sharply in his gut. Harry couldn’t imagine if it were Ginny or even Hermione, after everyone else he’d already lost; it would be just too much.
"That could be an important lead to follow, or it could be nothing," Hermione said, not sure how to instruct Harry to proceed.
Draco scoffed and pushed his plate away. “I knew it was all bollocks, but you couldn’t exactly say that to the Dark Lord and my parents were too afraid to listen.”
“Start small, especially if they don’t have a lot of money themselves or if you’ve never exchanged gifts before. They may feel obligated to return the favor”
Harry smirked at the idea of Draco flying for the Irish team, who were usually loud, brash and nearly reckless in their games. They “drank, as much as they played, which he figured couldn’t help their scores much, but their followers were ridiculously loyal and their garish green and orange would overwhelm any stadium.
Maybe he needed to ask Hermione again, but how did he explain why he needed the note without explaining what it was for and who? She’d already asked at least three times all ready, but thankfully when it came to Draco, he was used to keeping his mouth shut.
Nadine Witherstrom had only been an Aurour for less than five years now and was working her way into the intelligence field very rapidly. She'd only seen Head Auror Harry Potter twice in her entire career so far; including today, but she knew him intimately by his many accolades, newspaper articles, and word of mouth. So seeing him take lead on a case involving his old long-term school rival Draco Malfoy was curious enough to have her reluctant to be dismissed.
“So good to see you Harry dear, Ginny said she wasn’t sure you’d be able to make it today, but you’re already here aren’t you?” Molly asked, squeezing her arms around Harry.
Did you know they rarely play any international games and each one of their states had at least one team? A state called California has 2, one in the south and one in the north. America splits their teams up by regions, north, west, east and south and the top 2 teams who have won the most games overall play against each other.
Harry smiled at the kind, thoughtful gesture. “That’s very nice of you Scorpius, I’m sure Lily would love them.”
“I thought I was quite clear before Potter, what on Earth could you need help understanding?” Draco snarled.
His investigation was slowed considerably by Hermione’s constant interruptions. The paperwork was piling up faster then he could get through with it and even with one quill magiked to sign his signature while he physically signed with a second one, he found he couldn’t catch up. Hermione checked in either by owl or personally at least twice a day, sent several notes for errands she needed him to run and had him reporting back on any changes every hour. Most of it was extremely redundant and managed to not only irk him but all his Aurours who he had to keep nagging for updates. Much to Hermione’s frustration no matter how much she pushed and prodded the case was moving along at a snail’s pace. It was mostly a waiting game now, all-possible leads had been followed, suspects checked, double-checked and put under surveillance. The biggest questions now were when and where would the next attack take place.
"It's every place in the last 10 years that some sort of explosion or suspicious fire started in what used to be thought of as an abandoned building that clearly wasn't after they inspected it. Some of those are pretty far away, but we don't even know if the person is a local or not so they could have relocated during or after the wars which is why I included them. However these are only the ones reported to the ministry, if this person really is muggle-born or a squib I suppose there'd be more reports by the muggle authorities that we don't know about," the young man explained quickly, his face switching from proud to anxiously nervous as he finished.
"How did you start making potions for Madam Pomfry? Didn't Professor Snape do that before?" Harry asked.
"And Malfoy so far has been the only survivor, which could mean he's still a target," Hermione mused thoughtfully.
“Completely depends on the quality and nature of the book and bookmark I suppose. Who are they for?”
Just as he was starting to move, Draco felt a strange tugging at the back of his head and suddenly both Harry and Neville were launching themselves across the table at him with twin shouts of alarm. Draco's hand went up to his head as Harry grabbed his left arm and Neville caught his right.
“I thought you didn’t want to drink last night,” Harry teased, earning a minute scowl from Hermione.
"Have you ever seen it do something like this before?" Harry asked, still trying to keep his voice low.
“I know it’s only going to be a few days dad and then everything will go back to the way it was, but Scorpius barely wrote me this whole summer. He looked so sad when we first saw them, but he said he was fine,” Albus replied, worry creasing his brows.
Harry shook his head, "I'm really not sure, so far there has been an attacked roughly every three to four weeks. That may be how long it takes them to build the explosives, or just figure out their next targets."
Harry nodded wordlessly and with painstaking slowness got Draco to his feet and shuffling across the patio. By the time Harry cast Alohamora on the patio doors Draco’s head was cleared enough to remember the panic that had set in just before he’d fainted. As if being the sole focus of Harry’s unwarranted savior complex wasn’t bad enough now he’d never believe Draco when he said they were fine. Though obviously Harry hadn’t believed it before much anyhow. A long-suffering sigh escaped him and Harry stopped their progress through the house.
“It’s alright, just take your time, keep breathing,” Harry murmured softly, rubbing gentle circles on Draco’s back.
The blonde poked listlessly at the crust of his pie. “It was nothing Potter, he didn’t even have his wand out.”
“She’s always been an overachiever Malfoy. Anything less then perfection is simply not allowed in any aspect of her life,” Harry smirked.
Harry deeply regretted how quickly it went downhill from there, but he just didn't seem to know how to get out of the giant hole he'd dug for himself at the time. The only resolution Ginny had been able to come to was for Harry to follow in her brother's footsteps and quit being an Auror. Considering he'd already dedicated the better part of his adult life to his career and was up for a position as Head Auror, Harry had steadfastly refused. Without being able to come to an agreement, they'd both sought separate council in respective family and friends. Ginny had asked her mum how she handled having her husband working for the ministry so much and Harry had gone to Ron and Hermione for guidance. The three had sympathized with the couple, but none had come up with a foolproof way to juggle both time-consuming careers and home lives. Mr. Weasley made it a point to eat breakfast and dinner with his family nearly every day and Ron had given up his dream of becoming an Auror in order to be more available for his family.
He smirks in an attempt to lighten the mood. “So sentimental, Harry,” he teases. “I hope you don’t expect me to pour out my epic tale of pining.”
As soon as he shakes his pants off, Harry pushes him onto the bed, crawling over him. He grips Draco’s ass savagely, kneading and caressing in equal measure. “Lube?” he grunts out.
A bell chimes, and Draco’s nose tingles with the aroma of coffee and baked goods that wafts towards him. The cafe looks very cheerful, and sports a sunny blue-yellow-green color scheme. The employee behind the counter is tending to the only other customer, a young teenage boy, but calls out a greeting.
Draco swats at him. “I don’t have time! I’m a very busy man with more important things to do, alright?”
“You’re just trying to butter me up,” Draco accuses. But despite his words, he leans across the table to kiss him anyway.
“So, I’m your first date,” Harry says slowly. Draco nods, and Harry bites his lip. “I can’t say I’m too disappointed about that. I like knowing I’m your first.”
“Thanks, Ron. I’m so glad I have the both of you,” she adds, swinging her head around to smile at Harry. Harry smiles back and tries to quash his jealousy at their easy relationship.
Potter doesn’t seem to notice that it’s Draco that just walked into his cafe, instead handing the other customer his drink and waving him goodbye. Draco takes a moment to steel himself, and walks forward. “Good morning, Potter.”
When Draco wakes up, the first thing he notices is Harry’s arm wrapped around him and their legs tangled together. He blinks confusedly, before the events of last night hit him like a hammer.
Something was just a little bit off about the whole thing, though.“I wonder...How did Potter manage to have three relationships within such a short period of time if he has a soulmate? That shouldn’t be possible,” Draco speculated. He flipped through some more pages, before stopping on one that caught his eye. “What’s this?” Then, as the words on the page registered in his brain, a soft “oh!” fell from his mouth.
Harry lights up, dropping the casual act. “Really?” It’s adorable how much he sounds like a hopeful child. Harry seems to realize this and flushes, clearing his throat in an attempt to recover. “I mean, that’s great! I’ll owl you the details.”
It’s not boredom; Draco has an interesting job that he actually enjoys, working with Cupid’s Arrow. (It’s actually astonishing how normal the Department of Mysteries is. Draco always imagined everything shrouded in darkness and secrecy, but the Unspeakables act just like any other Ministry workers. Of course, everything
Draco seems to shift, and bites his lip. “I work for the Department of Mysteries. I can’t say anything beyond that. I’m sure you understand.”
Potter visibly starts before stuttering out a reply. “Oh - uh - good morning, Malfoy.” His eyes are wider than saucers and he clearly doesn't expect Draco to be there.  “Um, what would you like to order?” he asks after a minute.
“Harry’s right, Mione. It’ll be fine. Besides, I’ll be right here beside you the whole time,” adds Weasley, lightly squeezing her hand.
“Of course you are. You’re an independent young man who just wants some company.” She pats his hand condescendingly as she says this. “But still, think about it. If you want, I’m sure I could find someone you’d like.”
Draco lifts a brow, acting nonchalant, but inside, he can’t stop himself from squealing. “Maybe. Depends on what you mean.”
Draco reaches for the file containing his next case, and his new philosophy comes screeching to a halt when he spots the name embossed on the cover.
Harry pulls in a breath, exhaling with a huff. “But then you showed up, two weeks ago. Like you stepped out of a dream.” He smiles, and Draco’s heart goes
About a week later, Harry runs into Malfoy while jogging. Quite literally. Harry rounds a corner, lost in the music pumping through his earbuds and
It’s not loneliness; Draco has company. Pansy meets him for lunch every Tuesday at that nice outdoor cafe place, and Blaise drops in every other week with his newest boy toy. He even stops by Greg’s bakery every morning on the way to work to see Greg and grab some breakfast. Not to mention pub night every Friday with his coworkers and whoever else joins them.
Hermione’s face immediately puckers up. She opens her mouth to say something, but Ron interjects. “Great! We have
Draco prods at the glowing fluid with his wand and is instantly bombarded with more of Potter’s personality traits, the below the surface ones. Recklessness, pigheadedness, loyalty, humbleness, protectiveness. His love for Quidditch and flying, his fierce devotion to his friends, his fondness towards treacle tarts. All the things make him
him? No, that’s too ridiculous to think about. It must be something else. But, still, Draco can’t quite ignore the fluttering in his stomach or fight the smile spreading across his face.
Harry had taken to it like a fish to water. It doesn’t take his mind off things quite as easily as flying did, but it’s close enough. And so Harry had started running every day, and every time he needs to forget. It works wonders for his brain.
“Good.” Draco smiles, pleased, and Harry's eyes widen even more. Before he can say anything, Draco glances at his watch and announces, “I have to go. I’ll see you tomorrow, Harry.” He squeezes Harry’s shoulder and Disapparates, leaving Harry staring. A smile steals over his face. Draco thought it was
She tugs him in the direction of his bedroom. “Come on. Let’s get you ready for your date with the Golden Boy.”
“Someday,” echoes Draco. Someday he and Harry will get a proper house together, maybe somewhere in the country. They’ll get married, settle down, and maybe even adopt some kids. But while Draco looks forward to all this, he’s pretty damn happy right where he is now, dancing with his boyfriend, surrounded by laughter and friends.
“You like that, don’t you,” Harry murmurs, driving into him harder and harder. Draco winds an arm around his head and pulls him down into a kiss, hot and filthy. Draco comes immediately, Harry's skillful tongue and unrelenting pace his undoing. He moans into Harry’s mouth, spurting hot ropes of come all over Harry’s chest. Harry comes not long after, shuddering in his release.
They do eventually make it onto the papers, after a date in Diagon Alley. Rumors fly, and they have a good laugh over some of the more absurd details. The Daily Prophet claims Draco to be Veela and Harry his mate. It’s widely known that Veelas require constant contact with their mates, and the Prophet says Harry’s too noble to let someone die, so he agreed to date Draco. Witch Weekly are notably distraught over the reveal of Draco’s sexuality, and claims Harry to be a vampire using his allure on Draco.
But that’s not the point. The point is, he’s happy. He has a good job that pays well, friends he would die for, and a nice house in an even nicer neighborhood.
They spend the next few minutes just eating. Draco can’t help the pleased sounds that escape him with every bite, but the way Harry responds, blushing deeper each time, is worth it.
“Well, they’ve been nagging me for weeks to find a date, so…Do you want to be my date?” He looks up, hopeful.
When Ron and Hermione exchange vows and a kiss, not a single eye in the audience is dry, including Draco’s. Harry’s eyes find his, and they smile at each other, just as much in love as the two kissing on the altar.
Pansy and Hermione had become friends almost immediately after meeting. It was a little scary how much they took to each other, and Ron had admitted once that he would be worried about Pansy stealing Hermione away if he wasn’t so secure in their relationship.
Harry immediately shuts down that train of thought. It’s too dangerous to think those kinds of things right now, especially with Malfoy right in front of him. But he can’t help himself when Malfoy is standing right there, and looking so tempting.
A smile tugs on Harry’s lips. “What about the Muggles?” he asks, choosing to ignore it, “Aren’t you afraid of being seen?”
Draco reaches for his wand and swiftly cleans them up, come-covered bodies, lube-stained sheets, and all. “Bleh. We can shower in the morning.”
Given the size of his inheritance, Harry has no real need to have a job, but working keeps him occupied, and he found a pleasant job as a Muggle barista. The cafe had been one of his favorite places to cool down after his fights with Ginny, and when he saw the “help wanted” sign hanging on the door one day, he hadn’t hesitated and applied immediately. There’s just something strangely calming about mixing drinks and interacting with customers. Even rude customers are a welcome change from the fawning he receives from every single witch and wizard he meets.
Merlin. This has to be too good to be true. If Draco isn’t, in fact, just dreaming, then this means he actually has a chance with Potter. More than just a chance, considering they were practically made for each other.
