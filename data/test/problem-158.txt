The cabinet was proving to be difficult.
"Part of these duties include continuing the family name, the family purity-"
"I was hoping you would come sit with my sister and I, we would love to have your company," the twin smiled dangerously sweet.
“It’s not so bad,” Potter shrugged.
What the fuck? "Umm… Professor," Draco looked towards Severus, who was rubbing his temples in aggravation, "thank you for the concern-"
He thought Blaise wasn't going to accept, how could he blame him? "Me too," Blaise supplied quietly.
Draco struggled to peak over the sideways table. Granger laid unconscious. Weaslet and Longbottom standing above her. Spells coming out from their wands, but so many surrounded them.
He pulled out his wand, ignoring how Finnigan flinched, and used the same spell Blaise had used on him whenever Weasley had broken his nose. The nose set with an audible pop, several students flinched in sympathy of Finnigan's scream.
"How much did you hear?" Draco asked, a blush on his cheeks.
Potter looking up at him from his seat, his eyes wide and his mouth just barely opened-
Longbottom was next, Granger in his arms. Lovegood followed with a tight grip on Weasley. Draco and the Weaslet were last.
"I can assure you that the situation required Harry to tell us about you, Malfoy. He didn't take that lightly," Dumbledore continued.
Potter shrugged, he was wearing his usual over-worn blue sleep wear. "You're always here before I am, so I figured I would get here early to surprise you," Potter explained. Draco took off his cloak, the room was pleasantly warm without the extra layer. He met Potter's smile with ease, as Potter was standing close.
Draco have him a shrug, "It's mostly boring actually."
"Let him answer in his own time, Severus. I'm sure he has a lot on his mind," Dumbledore cooled.
"Charm? Draco how long has this been happening?" Blaise asked, concern written clearly across his features.
"You can get dessert," he teased.
Thank you for everyone who left comments and kudos to let me know how much they cared about this story, that is always super encouraging.
He kept a much more careful eye out while he walked to dinner. He doubt his continued paranoia was needed, but he had created a number of bad habits in order to protect himself. Astoria caught his eye before he was seen by any other Slytherins as he took careful glances in dark corners. "Can I talk to you?" Astoria asked, she made eye contact with him for the first time in weeks.
The tone of his voice made her flinch. She wrung her hands together so tightly that her knuckles turned pale. "I-"
Draco had waited until Blaise went to soothe away Theo's nightmares before he attempted to lay back down. His own curtains had remained tightly shut as Blaise whispered calming words to his boyfriend. As the weeks had passed, Draco hadn't forgotten his own silencing spell around his bed. His nightmares had been deadly.
"Naturally we are concerned about the health and safety of all of our students," he continued, "but I am also worried about your recent behavior."
"Hey," Potter's hand touched his, "what's wrong? You dazed out for a second."
"Because that’s where he's confused," Daphne murmured behind him.
Potter took his seat next to him, still holding his hand. Draco looked at him, Potter was quite stunning. He was almost pretty, with his long dark eyelashes framing his bright green eyes. They were close enough that their shoulders brushed against each other.
Draco’s stomach turned at the proximity. His skin crawled with Potter’s touch. He needed to get away, he wasn’t worth this kindness. “Nothing,” he lied, “I...it’s...” The words caught in his throat. A glance at Potter’s hurt expression made the words fumble as Draco tried to think of an excuse.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It's the importance of information," Draco solemnly stated with mock seriousness.
Draco walked through the empty halls. Professor Frog-Face had excused him from class to instead have him monitor the halls. She was getting increasingly impatient with Potter and his army. She had certain, trustworthy, students monitor the halls in hopes of finding the club Potter was running. Draco had pointed out that most of the dungeons had yet to be investigated, so now most of Umbridge's minions where running in circles in the dark dungeons. He had bravely volunteered to continue his hall monitoring alone. Upstairs, away from the dungeons.
“Do it for the girl, you can help her, you can do something about this,” Draco continued, “the girl needs help - help me help her,” Draco finished. If Zabini knew he was being manipulated, he didn't care, he was too numb, he allowed himself to be malleable to Draco's orders. Blaise nodded, turning away from Draco's touch, hurrying to the Great Hall to make excuses for Draco.
Draco was thankful whenever he was able to be outside for his Care of Magical Creatures class, maybe the fresh air would rid him of Umbridge's scent that supposedly was still on him. The air was cool, fresh. Theo walked with him, not too close of course. Blaise met them outside of Hagrid's hut, he stood with them while Hagrid lectured about Thestrals.
Draco pulled away, rising from the couch. His chest was hot with the closeness they just shared. He turned to Potter, raising his wand.
"No, but are you telling me that you haven't learned anything from living under his roof? From being surrounded by Death Eaters every day? Draco, you came back from the summer break as almost a Master Occlumens-"
"Ah, for the best, I suppose."
Potter looked up at him before nodding, "I've never asked out a girl before."
A hand on his jaw brought him out of his swirling thoughts, “Draco, I was so scared for you.”
"She's fine," Blaise answered.
"Shut up Malfoy," Potter droned, unaffected and unpacking his bag.
Finnigan didn't know what to do with Draco's non-threating demeanor, he had been prepared for a fight, not a conversation. His feet shifted, but he kept Draco at wand point. A shiver went through the crowd as Draco visibly slipped from hot anger to cold calculation. "Yeah, what of it?" Finnigan snapped, his hand was shaking now.
"How can I help you?" she asked, her eyes not moving from the essays she was grading.
"What you asked for, the healing salves," Draco gently reminded him.
The air was warm outside, he let his shoulders drop. Daphne walked up to him. She had to look up at him now, he had grown. Her blond hair dancing lightly in the warm breeze. There was a longing in Draco, in his heart. A longing for a brighter future than the one he knew was coming. Darkness was circling them, one bright warm day in a town full of laughter wasn't going to fix that.
Draco blinked, "The fuck?"
"Have you thought about what I said?" she whispered.
Draco continued down the hall, keeping to the edge while other students milled around him, lowering their eyes and quieting their voices. There was a time when Draco would appreciate the authority given to him, but now he knows that such authority equals unwanted attention. He plays the part well, he knows, but the constant attention sends chills down his spine and makes everything sharp.
"Potter," she stated.
Daphne lifted her legs onto the bench they shared, the toes of her shoes resting snuggly against Draco's thigh. Draco rested his hand on her knee.
"Don't you pretend this isn't what you wanted Draco, you've been manipulating me to join since you and Potter became pals," Daphne snapped.
"What else was he supposed to do?" Blaise snapped quietly, trying to ensure they weren't overheard.
Both of the boys jumped, Draco scrambled to catch the falling box. Potter scurried over to help.
"What do you want me to do, Daphne? Why don't you own your problems and stop putting them on me?" Draco yelled.
The only sound in the small metal elevator was Draco's breathing. Sweat tickled the side of his temple as moisture collected at his hair line. He ran his tongue over his teeth. His mouth was so dry. Nails dug themselves in the back of his neck.
Against the blanket of the night, under the warmth of the small light of the lantern above their heads, Draco could make the details of a young, familiar face. Daphne smiled, tears threatening to spill out of her beautiful bright blue eyes that Draco never had noticed before now.
His eyes fluttered shut whenever he felt Potter's lips on his neck in a small kiss. He gasped as Potter's lips moved to his ear. His heart was pounding in his chest, he was sure Potter could feel his heartbeat against his neck as lips worked more surely against his neck. Hands found Potter's chest, his neck. Draco couldn't stop them from shaking. He could hear how fast Potter was breathing, his hand felt how fast his heart was pounding in his ribs. Potter wanted this just as much as he did.
"I'll never forgive you."
Draco made his way to the exit, the very spot where he shoved Pansy to a torturous solution to a horrid situation.
He waited for her to say something, to start this conversation, but she stayed deathly silent. "I don't know how to do this," he admitted into the darkness the spell didn't cover, not turning to look at his friend.
"Fine."
Draco tried to hind his smile behind his hand, 'only if you don't trust me,' was his response.
"The name's Greyback," Draco took the hand offered to him. Greyback didn't seem to mind the blood on Draco's hand.
"You need to lighten up, Draco. You will lose your good looks if you keep frowning like that. Who would want to marry you then? I will let you know right now that I'm only marrying you for your looks," she formed her words almost as if they didn't taste like acid in her mouth.
Draco entered his room, kicking his door shut. He leaned against the back of the wooden door frame. His back slid against the wood as he let his feet slide out from under him.
"Well, you are," Potter chimed in.
Weasley had summoned whatever was in the tank into his hands. A brain was now slicing into his flesh with thoughts. Blood pouring out of the gaping wounds.
"Move out of my way, Mr. Malfoy," Professor McGonagall brushed by him with a scowl towards Severus.
“...they’ve already left.”
Beta'd by the love of my life @halfgallonhomo on tumblr
"I was yelling at you for a while now. What's got your head in the clouds? Were you thinking about a certain someone's broomstick?" she teased with an easiness Draco wasn't expecting. Draco tried to smile, to seem normal for her, but his movements were too stiff as she bumped his shoulder with hers. He looked down at his feet, shame deep in his stomach. She probably hated him now, who wouldn't? Being forced to marry a man who didn't love you, who couldn't love you. Draco knew that with time, with the pressure of marriage, they would grow to hate each other. Draco had to gain control before Daphne snapped with the weight of her world.
This wasn't adding up. Why a family that wasn't directly connected to the Dark Lord? Why Daphne, who was so young? Surely there were other fertile women that were older?
"You were only three feet of off the ground. Just think of the experience as a free Quidditch lesson. I was pretending to be a bludger," Daphne shrugged off, "besides, I did ruin my dress for that tackle, so I think we're even."
She turned back to glare at Draco, her words doing lasting damage. "I can't even recognize you," she hissed.
Mafalda smiled, "Trust me, I know," she agreed, she looked ready to leave, but she bent down to help Draco with his bag.
"Why did you invite me, Draco?" Daphne pestered through his 'not' looking for Potter.
Draco had been dismissed early, has he had not be a part of the actual fighting, only a witness. However, he still missed dinner. His stomach complained loudly as he barged into his dorm.
Draco held her as he explained, "Potter's Army gives our people an out, they can take a stand without being alone." The Slytherin students are most likely out of any house to become Death Eaters, to follow in there parent's footsteps. Draco couldn't change that, but Potter and his friends could provide shelter for those within the house that are being most abused.
Draco rubbed his head, "She's not my friend, Potter."
Silence. He could hear the gears turning in Potter's head. Potter's chewing became loud as he focused in on the information Draco had just given him. Draco studied Potter while he was distracted, he was wearing the same pale blue pajamas he almost always wore. Draco was still wearing the same outfit from his date with Daphne, the dark blue brought out his eyes.
"No what, Malfoy? Use the manners and eloquence your father as worked so hard to engrain into you, or are you too smart for him as well?" Severus chilled.
The lines were blurring. He could possibly perform all the parts asked of him, required of him. How was he supposed to comfort Potter, to help him? Reaching out to Potter would be like reaching for the sun while being sucked into hell.
In all honesty, Draco wanted to run. The instinct to run was one that twisted in his lower spine. Potter, with his trusting eyes and easy smiles, made him stay to help. Fuck the danger. Draco was willing to, stupidly, so painfully stupidly, help him. Help Potter. Go against his family. Go against his Lord.
Potter stepped away, but didn't let Draco's gaze fall. "Yes, well, I have my moments," Potter joked, before taking his place on the couch in front of the fire. Draco followed, sitting down next to Potter. They were still close, comfortably close. Draco laid his cloak along the back of the coach, settling in against the soft pillows.
Find me @carpebellum on tumblr if you wanna talk there!
The group took over the sitting area as Blaise and Bulstrode moved to a table. They were loudly laughing, the girls giggling at the boy's teasing. Disgusting to watch. The silence didn't return after that.
"There really isn't anywhere else to look at."
"Scars make someone handsome?" she baited.
The ghostly head floated up until a ghostly body floated in front of Draco. He blinked.
"When really you're just protecting the blood traitors," Montague argued.
"Where's Theo?" Blaise asked.
"That's amazing, Draco," he heard Potter speak next to him. Potter started to pet the neck of the Thestral, he grinned at Draco. Draco's heart started to beat faster.
Draco returned to the sinks to wash his hands, the clear water flowing from the facet onto his sweating hands. Draco had to get a hold of himself in reference to Potter. However, this was new to both of the boys, blunders had to be expected, but, Draco was not used to having less than exceptional social skills. His words had always been his greatest weapon.
"Is it necessary that I speak in less obvious terms?" Severus snapped.
Dumbledore's lip turned up into a small smile, Severus rolled his eyes besides Draco. "Yes, Malfoy," Dumbledore clamed, "Harry is fine."
Montague had known. Had known that Draco sneaks out during the night, but how? He was always careful. He hadn't known where, Montague would have used that information whenever Draco had him on his knees, but he still noticed. Who else noticed? Why didn't any of his dormmates say anything? Theo would have mentioned if he had known, wouldn't he? Blaise probably wouldn't have, this didn't concern him. But Crabbe and Goyal? If one of them found out the both found out, but they were more likely to be straightforward.
"What the fu- holy shit, Draco," Daphne grinned.
"It's not your fault," Potter pulled away from Draco. Meeting his gaze. Potter looked so tired, as if he had aged years in the little time they've been together.
Daphne was leaning against the stalls in a  pale blue robe that was tight against her, blond hair  in loose braids stacked upon her head. Her cigarette was already lit, the grey bellows of smoke curling  around her braids.
"Where's my damn trunk-" Draco turned to levitate his trunk.
But how? Potter was handsome, he was brave and kind. Draco's heart fluttered just at the thought of him.
A small smile from Potter warmed Draco's chest.
Potter didn't even bother to yell.
Parents started to wave at the train as the wheels gently started to turn. His parents never had waved at him when he was leaving for school, but they always sent chocolates ahead of time. The box of chocolates were always wrapped in silver paper. Even though Draco knew what was wrapped in the box, he was always warmed by the touch.
Severus followed behind him as Draco broke into a run, students cleared the halls for them. Draco and Severus burst into the lavatory, a couple of boys proceeded to get piss on themselves.
That was meant to be a comforting statement, but Draco just felt nauseous. He wasn't prepared to handle this, not in this state. "What do you mean he talks about me?" he wanted to shout, but he kept his voice steady.
"Like I told the others, I was going to the library to study. I was thrown into the air then attacked with fire. I heard shouting from down the hall and a wall of darkness appeared in front of me. I didn't see anyone's face as I had hit my head and was currently burning alive," he repeated his lie.
This wasn't how this was supposed to happen. McGonagall at St. Mungo's after taking multiple stunning spells directly into her chest. Umbridge seemed too gleeful at that. Potter had looked at Draco as if this was his fault. So many things were that it didn't matter.
"Mom?"
Draco may hate being a Prefect.
"Do you think we would've been friends sooner?" Potter asked.
Severus looked towards Draco. Their Lord had Sirius. That's what Potter thought anyway. This was a trap. Potter new this, but he didn't care. He would willingly walk into a trap on the slight chance his godfather was in danger.
“Oh, I know,” Draco interrupted turning to the boy hurrying behind him “how about we skip the usual insults and I just insult you on your pathetic excuse for a family?”
Not that he particularly noticed Potter's absence.
Draco couldn't breathe. He couldn't walk. A small girl, a child even in the eyes of Draco, looking into him and begging for life as she watched her family struggle to fight against ropes held by magic-
The unlikely pair entered the Great Hall and went on their separate ways, not a word spoken.
"Well, what do I call you? Do you have a name?" Tilt of the head.
He was trying to put Draco at ease.  “I cleared a spot where we can sit,” Potter motioned to the window. There was an almost sturdy wooden bench in front of the window. Potter had even managed to get most of the dust off.
She walked the couple of steps across the tiny greenhouse to the doorway where Lucius stood, still smoking.
Say something. Tell him.
Theo's eyes widened, then relaxed at the nature of the question. "The Yule Ball," he provided, "that was, um, our first kiss, actually," Theo further explained, a blush light on his cheeks.
Draco walks his usual path to the large greenhouse that is the classroom of  Herbology. Draco always takes the door closes to Charms and walks around the building outside instead of walking through the corridor, the walk is peaceful and Draco can be alone, without any roles to play. The idea of being truly unobserved for just a few moments is worth having a predictable schedule to the outside eye.
"I'll see you in class, need to piss," he dismissed himself.
"He deserved it," Potter pouted.
"You like me?" Draco blurted. Stupid.
"Oh? And whose fault is that?"
"You're the best friend I've ever had," Draco told him, "and I want to help you." Potter swallowed, his breath fanning against Draco's face. Draco leaned in, enough to know that Potter would only look at him, only see him.
"You can't simply be a cat, there's no way you would have been able to see me with the charm on. Perhaps you're part Kneazle? Is that it?"
"No one else would make a better prodigy for our Lord," Pansy complimented.
Would that really be so bad?
None of the doors had a handle.
"Potter, we're barely friends now," he contradicted.
Dumbledore walked in, appearing regal as always in dark navy robes. A somber look was directed at Draco. Professor Dumbledore sat in the seat where Severus had just been sitting across from Draco. "Well, well, Mr. Malfoy, what are we going to do with you?" Dumbledore's slight tilt of his head, followed by his silence, twisted a knife in Draco's gut. He ignored the steady panic that was pooling at his spine, keeping his sight steadily meeting Headmaster's gaze.
"I have no id-" Draco automatically denied.
"I am a Prefect, Potter. I'm allowed out at night."
Thoughts like these is what caused Draco to even vary his routine. Go outside, go to one of the towers, whatever, keep everything unexpected in order to not get lost and starve, or get bored. Which is how he was in this very unpleasant situation.
Draco pinched his lips together, this would be the best answer he would get tonight, but he didn't like the unpredictability.
"Son of a-" Draco gasped. "Potter, what are you doing here?" Potter was a couple of steps behind him. He didn't smile, only motioned for Draco to follow. "Potter, we can't be seen together," Draco pointed out before they slipped out of the Great Hall. Potter pulled out a cloak from his bookbag, covering Draco completely.
"Merlin, Professor. There is someone stuck in the pipes of the toilet," Draco explained, frustration clear. He grabbed Severus's cloak sleeve, pulling the slightly taller man alongside him, motioning the urgency of the situation.
Draco's wand flew from his hand has Rabastan focused on him.
The spot next to him remained cold as no one took Daphne's usual seat. Draco felt the heat from Potter's gaze. They hadn't spoken since their few stolen moments on the train.
Easier said than done. Draco thought.
The two sat in quiet after that. Draco's eyelids getting heavy without Potter's distraction. He fell asleep more relaxed in this classroom than in his own bed.
Draco is met with the warm smell of grass, companied by a pleasant breeze the second he steps outside. Clouds engulf the sky with bright white, providing a plain backdrop to rest of the world, making the landscape look overtly bright with deep greens, similar to the color of the furniture in the Manor's. The contrasting greens play against each other; the lightness of the grass and the dark greens of the forest. The lake looks dark blue now, almost black, similar to the fountain water in the gardens at night when Draco would look at out his bedroom window which looked out onto the Manor's expansive gardens.
"Just pick one Harry," Longbottom whispered. His voice seemed to reverberate up to the ceiling against the smooth bricks.
"Daphne," he greeted, trying to keep his voice steady.
He kept an eye out for Potter, when he noticed that Potter was nowhere to be seen, he came to the conclusion that Umbridge was keeping him out past dinner as punishment. The Weasleys entered the hall without Potter, Draco supposed that Potter was meant to go without dinner. Draco started to stuff his pockets with any dry food within his reach. He would give them to Potter later. He then realized that he wasn't hungry anymore.
"If you want I could show you how to not get your nose broken sometime," Greyback offered when Draco was almost finished with his smoke.
Tonks and Potter both stared at him with surprise on their faces. “I was just going to help you with your nose,” Tonks explained with concerned gentleness.
Draco waited outside of the Common Room. There was no torches lit and the darkness hugged close to Draco. Potter had slipped Draco a note during potions class asking to meet tonight. He was nervous, how was he supposed to talk to Potter after the night a couple of days ago?
Draco hurried across the circular room. He was swimming through light. It still wasn't too late for him to turn back-
"Well…why not?" Black shrugged.
The two giggled at the memory. The reminder of what they were here for sobering them out of their smiles. "She aced the practical later though," Lupin confided.
"…did she say anything?" Daphne prompted.
"Why does he care? It's not like he has been to most sympathetic to my situation," Pansy noted.
This, however, was not research covered in dusty old books about magic reconstruction and appliance. Draco was working with the very heart of this magic. The fluidity was an aspect he hadn't considered. This was a difficult task.
Draco wouldn't let go of Harry.
Draco gave a pointed look to her outfit, "I wouldn't have guessed."
The train gently slowed near Hogwarts.
"Mr. Malfoy, I can assure you, that if you were in true need of protection, I would stop at no means to acquire that for you," Dumbledore declared.
"Ah, well," Umbridge made her marks on her clipboard before moving on.
“Now, Potter, I must be leaving,” Draco turned pointedly away.
"Yes."
But she wasn't here. He had killed her.
"Your father fucks his secretaries, fucks them until he gets bored of them, then he fires them for a new, wet fuck," Montague paled, Draco further twisted the knife. "How many little bastard siblings to you think you have? One of them probably got pregnant, your father had to start paying her off to keep her quiet, is that why you're wearing the same robes from last year?" he taunted.
Draco allowed his head to fall against the stall wall. "Don't worry about it, Potter. I'm sure you have enough problems to worry about," he dismissed Potter's care.
"Malfoy-"
Because Draco could never love a woman romantically.
Black shuffled through his pockets. He pulled out a packet of cigarettes. He gave Draco a smoke without a comment of his age. Draco lit both smokes with his zippo lighter. He was thankful for something to do with his hands. He thought about a safe conversation topic. The list he was coming up with was short.
"What brings you here?" Narcisa spoked for the first time today. "I didn't know you were close to the Greengrass'."
The students stayed close together as they entered the room in awe. Daphne pressed against Draco's side a warm smile on her lips as she took in her surroundings. In the middle of the room, a large fire flickered on the floor. Seeming ever ablaze as the ash around the fire piled, but there was no wood in the center.
“Are you going to tell anyone?” Potter was being serious.
He looked around the room. Catching only glances of two dark figures before more spells were thrown at him with shaking force.
He was used to entertaining himself. His parents were not the sort of people for play. As a child, he thought all grownups  didn't like to play, as he had gotten older, he discovered that his parents were simply distant people.
"Really? It doesn't seem that way."
"Goodbye, Montague," he dismissed, "I'll see you in Quidditch practice." Draco turned around, Pansy had collected his bookbag for him. The crowed around him started to dispersed, disappointed.
Montague turned the corner, running past Draco's hiding spot. His face was bloody and an orange cat was latched onto his back. Montague spun in circles, his hands trying to grab the cat, but was only met with a hiss. Draco watched in quiet glee as Montague run down the hall while yelling at a surprisingly high note. Montague fell onto his stomach with a quick jinx from Draco, who had to bite his lip to hold his laughter.
Unless… she was being betrothed to someone the same age as her.
"I could tell your date was almost as shitty as mine," Potter explained.
Draco remained silence after. He didn't want to risk pissing Severus off further.
The words were just behind Severus's lips, that much was clear. The door behind him opened, Severus kept silent, his head down.
"The real kicker is that no one has ever called me a bitch," he teased.
He kept his head low as tears boiled behind his eyes. He could feel the shame make his face red. His hands started to shake. Why now? Why was his heart pounding like he had just killed Daphne now and not a week ago? Why were his lungs squeezing the life out of him?
She kicked at his shins. She slipped on her own blood. Her nails clawed at his arms, but the warm blood that covered them both made her fingers slippery.
They arrived at the room, opening the door to the small room with a fireplace. Potter turned to him, before gently taking off the cloak over Draco's head. "Thanks," Draco greeted Potter with a smile.
Potter didn't have the same privilege.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You're just wearing him out," he reasoned.
He blinked at his Lord, who started to eat his meal politely with a knife and fork. The meal changed when he turned back.
Draco kept his face mildly curious, but his mind was working quickly.
"Keep your name out of it?" she asked.
Draco stood right in front of her desk, unsure how to proceed. "Umm…yes, well," he stumbled. He pulled out one of the candies from his pocket, laying the candy on the desk. "The Weasley twins are selling magical candies that can get a student out of class, I just thought you should know," he explained.
He was in too deep, he knew this. He would drown in this and it would be worth it for a second more of this comfort. Eventually, Potter said goodnight with a glance at Draco's lips. He wanted to kiss him.
His mother was there, told him to dress and meet her outside. He did as he was told. She had apparated them to one of their unused properties in the country.
"Why don't you go by something different if you don't like it?" he suggested.
"No," he answered, "it's not."
Draco turned, only to hear Potter yell after him, “Draco, your luggage!”
All of the air left Pansy's lungs, her shock clear on her face. "I want you to help me," she begged.
A cold hand on his shoulder made him look up, "Draco, you are young. I do not expect you to carry such a burden."
"It's not blue," he noted.
in his notes circling several times before remembering a similar object described in other textbook. He shuffled through the books, trying to recall which book he had read.
He kept glancing at the students who passed him by, he couldn't help himself, but he made himself seem busy by opening his notes and textbook. He hadn't seen Potter at all for breakfast. Where was he? Surely Potter had returned from the winter break, but why hadn't he reached out? Had Draco done something to anger Potter, or reject him in any way? The pair hadn't seen each other for weeks now, how could have Draco done something wrong? Maybe Draco was over reacting, Potter skipping breakfast wasn't too unusual.
“Draco, are you ready?” Potter held out his hand. Draco looked at the simple gesture, jealousy tore into him. How was Potter able to offer this to him so easily? Why was it so hard for Draco to accept kindness that was offered to him?
"You're an asshole, that's what you are Potter," Draco grumbled.
The Greenglass family is a noble family, and your father and I, with the suggestion of our closest friends, have decided to host their family during the winter. I know that you and their eldest daughter will get along well. I can imagine that she will look beautiful against the white of the snow.
"Here comes the 'but'," Blaise muttered.
Dolohov looped the spell high into the air, he threw the spell to Ganger. The spell hit her right in the chest. Her feet left the ground as she was thrown across the room against the wall. Draco heard the breath leave her body with the force of the throw. She slumped to the ground. Blood dripped into her hair.
"How's Pansy?" Daphne hurried to the point.
"What do you need," she eventually asked with a surprisingly gentle voice, taking a smooth puff. Draco was always amazed at her even temper.
Hope never got him anywhere.
Potter looked into the bag with a frown, his knuckles turning white against the fabric. He stood there, shoulders tense. Draco's neck itched in cold panic, his hands moist. What did he do wrong now? How could he manage to ruin this? This. This one good thing he had.
"Mafalda, Falda, Alda…"
"Potter's an idiot," Draco agreed, stirring his tea.
"Draco," he growled. His eyes glancing between Draco, Daphne and the cigarettes.
"I know that, we'll just have to keep an eye on her," Draco lectured.
“Sixty,” the girl answered.
My Dearest Draco,
Draco's heart was painfully loud in his chest. The sensation grounded him against the frozen feeling all around him. Draco was drowning, cold water filled his lungs, his vocal cords were frozen. He opened his mouth to speak. Potter looked so warm in the firelight. His dark skin seemed to soak in the warmth from the fire. His eyes were bright with worry, the raw, steady fear within Potter's eyes, his soul, made Draco want to reach out to him.
He was tired. Sleep was evading him and every once in a while, he would wake up swearing his mark had burst into flames. He had even fallen asleep during his few hours alone with Potter. On nights like those, he would wake up with Potter stroking his hair.
Draco pained through his reading, determined to understand this stupid overcomplicated Potions Theory book. Severus had made a snide comment about the series being 'over Draco's simple capabilities' and Draco wasn't one to achieve out of inspiration, but spite. He was sitting on the floor, leaning against the front of the emerald couch in the Common Room. Goyle sat on one of the mint chairs adjacent to the couch, talking to Crabbe over Draco, who was sitting across from Goyle in the other chair. Daphne's knees where against Draco's head, as she had taken the seat on the couch directly behind him. She was reading a copy of the Prophet, humming in response to the stupidity.
The tension in his shoulders loosened. Daphne opened her copy of the Daily Profit, content to read silently next to Draco.
He had to protect Potter from what he was. Shield him from Draco's world, but how? How could he have Potter and still protect him?
"And now you're covered in her blood," his Lord observed as if talking about simple gossip.
Draco rested his elbows on the railing as he leaned forward. Everything looked so small from here. This was a moment of odd peace he never got from flying on a boom, so much movement, so lonely. Here, in this tower, he was with Potter. "I'm tired too," Draco whispered when Potter was done talking, "I'm sorry about you godfather, he seemed like a good man."
"Merlin, I was just trying to start a conversation."
He was a monster.
Draco turned his back, he had been shown to be the victor. Now, no one would raise their wands to him. He was out for blood, and now everyone knew.
Draco took the glass. He took a sip for something to do with his hands. He studied his old professor. The dark bags under his eyes. The deep frown lines that made him seem so much older than his mid-thirties. This war had yet to begin, but the pressure was already wearing people like a heavy cloak.
The sound of the door opening caused Draco to raise his head to catch Potter's expecting eyes. Potter crossed the room to the fireplace, Draco put his book down and stood up, his manners Mother had hammered into his head allowing nothing less. Potter bunched his robe underneath his arm, looking anywhere but Draco. He was dressed in his over-used blue sleepwear. Potter was all bones, his pants only went down to his calves so that his ankles and bare feet poked out. Draco felt awfully overdressed in his school trousers and button-down shirt, his simple black robe hanging over the back of the chair he had been sitting in.
A rough shove to his chest dumped Draco's back against the seat. A wheeze of laughter forced a snort from Draco's chest.
Pansy didn't say anything to him, but Draco didn't think she was angry with him. He suspected the required return to their homes was the source of many Slytherin's anxieties. The Dark Lord had stolen the safety of their homes away from everyone.
Draco stared were Potter dragged Weasley away. "I was an ass, the usual," he shrugged her off.
The family stopped in front of their Lord. No one would look up at him. Rough hands shoved the family to stand in a line, shoulder to shoulder, but at two feet of distance. Everyone looked down. Daphne stood out in her colorful robes and her halo of blond hair that was curled down her shoulders.
"This," Professor Firenze began, "is Omen Fire…"  Draco hated Divinations, tending to tune out. The centaur had replaced Professor Trelawney last week whenever Umbridge had fired her. This was their first lesson with him. Firenze stood behind a fire, lighting his tall stature and sharp features.
Potter swallowed, "It just does."
"Draco!" a voice brought him out of his thoughts. He turned around towards the voice, Daphne, her hair flowing behind her, was hurrying towards him.
"Draco, you are the perfect solution," Daphne pointed out.
"If-" he stopped himself. He would have to be more careful with how casual he was with the Dark Lord. One mistake could offend his Lord. A deadly mistake.
"You were jealous of me?" Potter asked, his voice in shock.
Draco gave Severus a pointed look, but while his relationship with his godfather definitely had gotten more casual, Draco knew better than to give Severus a reason to give him detention. The bastard.
Draco observed the students around him as he let his breakfast cool. He didn't have much of an appetite these days. Laughter stilled around him as students avoided him. They could smell the death on him. The Slytherins had been recoiling around him. Fear leaked from the students that had watched Draco kill, that fear dripped into the Slytherin house and out to the rest of Hogwarts.
"And you know what he does to those he finds disposable, don't you Draco?" Draco's chest tightened. "You were there when he killed that muggle family, weren’t you, Dracy? How did he do it?" she taunted playfully.
What he wasn't expecting was for the Slytherin team to back him up. Especially Montague, but, their he was, punching Ronald Weasley in the jaw.
The two left towards their dorms.
What if the Dark Lord bled into Potter's mind at the wrong moment? How would Draco defend himself?
Draco tripped in his rush to help. His blood in his ears.
Draco held her gaze, needing to apologize for everything that has yet to come.
A snap behind Draco made him twist around white pain shot in his skull. Sirius turned into his dog formed beside him. Draco's heart lurched to his throat, how would he talk himself out of this one? His head felt fuzzy.
Lucius stood in the doorway of the dirty shack. His noise was wrinkled in disgust, his lips tight in anger.
"Oh, yeah," he spoke with all of his never ending wisdom.
"Dumbledore does want to start private lessons with me though," Potter confided.
"That's not the point! They hate each other, why would they be drinking together if they hated each other?" Pansy drew out to them. Draco ducked behind an aisle, making sure to stay in earshot.
Potter looked at Draco as if relearning him. Draco could feel the stare against his face has he turned to look into the fire, causing a blush to rise to his cheeks. He felt warm, cozy in this simple warmth with simple company. Despite having just gave Potter more information on himself than he ever gives to anyone.
"It seems that she wants to talk a lot, it's you that doesn't want to talk," Draco observed.
"Please," Potter's voice broke, "let him help you, Draco."
"You don't have to do that," he snapped finally turning to Pansy.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do you have to do?" Goyle asked.
Trust was dangerous.
Daphne was sitting with Cho Chang, she didn't even look up from her book as he passed by her. Draco took a seat next to Theo.
"Just show me, or even Potter," she whispered. "At least we'll know what we're facing."
"So, just the usual?" Draco flattered.
"Bentley knows what I mean, don’t you Bentley?" Draco scratched him behind an ear.
Wait, this isn't what Draco wanted, this isn't what Potter needed. "Professor, wait," he called out. Dumbledore stopped, his back still to Draco.
"I don't need help from someone who can't even help themselves," Draco turned away from her.
Theo sighed, "Don't remind me, it was a nightmare," he recollected.
His usual house owl not only dropped the usual Daily Profit, which Daphne grabbed before he could even look at the cross words, but also a letter from his mother. His jaw clenched. He hadn't received a letter in almost a month now.
Narcissa was both of these things, twisted yet strong.
"It's best if we distant ourselves, the holidays and all," Theo provided. 'And all,' meaning Mr. Nott and his horrid cruelty, with the unsure relations between the Zabini's and their Lord, distance is the best policy. "Oh no," Theo gasped, shoveling toast into his mouth with surprising speed.
"I wouldn't ask for help if I could do it myself!" he begged. "Who else am I supposed to go to, Daphne? You're the only one who knows-"
Dumbledore was so unknown. Draco was sure of one thing, if he agreed to stand alongside Dumbledore, he would be used as a pawn. He would be used. His agency would be stripped from him as he laid bare. How? Would he be sharpened into a blade meant to draw blood? Would he be bruised and dulled into a shield? Would he be just a pawn? A distraction, a sacrifice for whatever greater good Dumbledore decided? Could he allow himself to be?
Draco looked down at his hands. How could he put what he felt for his father, his own actions, into words? Lucius had been arrested, with the care he would receive in Azkaban for his knee, Draco wouldn't be surprised if his father was permanently disabled. He had done that. He had no regrets, or did he? "I'm sorry about him too," Draco settled. No words would ever explain his feelings for his father.
"I can be better, just let me try," Potter's voice was shaking. Draco reached out, gently cupping Potter's cheek.
"Malfoy, you just made the Captain of the Slytherin Team, your team, cry in the hallway. What's up?" Potter pointed out.
After Severus finished his lecture, the class paired up into groups of two to perform the potion. The class broke into their usual groups. Pansy stood to gather the ingredients from the storage closet while Draco began the light the fire underneath the cauldron.
"Well, Harry and Malfoy can, for starters," Hagrid explained.
Pink nails tightened over the brightly covered magazine, knuckles turning white as Umbridge continued to read, her face turning the same color as her pink hat. Draco would count that as a pink item. He had made his way into the triple digits now.
"I know," was all he could say, finishing his smoke before putting it out in the grass and leaving with his new, unexpected ally.
Of course he won't, genius.
Draco sighed, the weight she was putting on him was crushing.
"…and dangerous," Draco agreed.
The safety that Draco had for a moment was gone in an instant.
Your father is well, although his knee has been acting up more so with the recent weather.
Does he know how much information Draco has?
Potter was pulling Draco by the hand through the crowd of dueling wizards. Draco recognized Sirius battling Bellatrix. His smile cheerfully chilling in the midst of violence.
"Narcisa, leave him alo-" his father stood on shaking legs.
The tension in Draco's stomach only tightened. Was the Dark Lord only acting out of concern for Draco's feelings? That was a dangerous idea to flirt with. "I do sir," Draco pushed past the warning in his conscience. He had already killed one Greengrass sister, her blood still drying on his hands, did he really have to drag another into this battle with him? Astoria knew too much, he couldn't risk his life.
"How?" Draco asked innocently. His eyes wide in pretend shock. He watched as Daphne's mind worked through her options, she would come to the same conclusion as Draco. He was sure.
How could he? His mind was a puddle of stray thoughts, Occlumency was useless on him because he had no thoughts to cling to. Why was this necessary?
Potter tensed, his knuckles white. "I, I know that but," Potter swallowed, "there's just so much to do. I don't have time to…" he went silent.
"Disgusting," Pansy sneered, "I don’t know how you can stand being around him, Draco. He is constantly around that blood-traitor Bulstrode."
He hadn’t know that he could feel like this. Potter's lips moved against his. Draco hesitantly followed. He wanted this, he wanted more. He never understood why everyone was so focused on this. Here, with Potter's mouth on his, everything made sense. He couldn't stop if he wanted to.
"Are you saying you won't kill me unless I ask you to?" Dumbledore questioned.
Paranoia would keep him alive.
"No? Well perhaps Mrs. Parkinson? You did seem rather concern for her whenever she had her nasty accident."
"Draco?"
His steps echoed on the stones. The echoes could be mistaken for a person walking beside him like she used to.
Potter stared at him. His eyes flickering in the low torch light. "Thank you, for what you did for me."
"Oh, let him go," Crabbe had yelled out, he was the only one still in his bed, not bothered by Draco's outburst. Draco  hurried out, only hearing Crabbe's "Maybe we will get some fucking sleep," as he tripped out of the door after hauling it open.
"In which regards sir?" Draco responded.
"Draco!" Potter rushed to him, his smile warm.
"He will make you into a tool to be disposed of."
When did things become so difficult between them?
Draco had successfully ignored her, he was grateful for the distraction from their impending engagement. For the inevitable shred of their fragile friendship. This is why Draco hadn't said a word whenever Cho Chang herself invited Daphne to walk with her to class. Let Daphne have whatever rebel action she needed to before she was engaged.
"No," he answered truthfully.
"Did you know that terror has a certain taste?" Greyback pushed himself off of the wall. "You'll be happy to know that she was fucking petrified when you sliced her throat."
Plus, Draco was selfish enough to cling to this as long as he could. How could he not? Potter was his lifeline to knowing there was actual genuine good in this world. And… Potter wanted him. Draco was never wanted before, never sought after. Draco's life had always been a give and take for power, for privilege of being a Malfoy. Potter would like him even if he wasn't a Malfoy.
Draco was almost out of the room when he felt a hand on his arm, stopping him. Severus pulled him in close to his face, "Did you push her?" he demined, but he already knew the answer. Severus knew the truth, he also knew the answer Draco would give him.
Draco's heart rose into his throat. The back of his eyes itched. This was the plan, he tried to calm himself. "Stabilizing?" he let his voice crack. Sometimes there was strength in the emotions that made you vulnerable.
Draco sat alone in the train cart. The sense of nostalgia was gone. He was too different of a person to want for his childhood. He was still a child himself. For the first time in his young life, Draco had walked alone to the train to Hogwarts.
"What do you mean?"
"My apologies Professor," Draco lied, "I should have come to you first. Please forgive me." Draco told them what they wanted to hear, he just wanted this to end. He would have rather dealt with Umbridge.
"Yeah, he works here now as a free elf," Potter explained.
No. Potter couldn't already know, how could he? "Why does it matter if Daphne and I date?" Draco implored.
He rose, he needed to rid himself of the coil of his plan. Pansy clenched his wrist as he walked pass, stopping him abruptly. She opened her mouth to say something.
"Disgusting," Crabbe mumbled almost under his breath.
"Mr. Finnigan told me a slightly different story," Dumbledore recalled.
Potter wrapped him into a warm hug. Draco finally gave into the want to hug him back.
"Yeah," Potter nodded, looking down. "You know Arthur Weasley was attacked, right?"
"And then they'll leave my family alone?"
A book appeared on the table. Draco opened the book hurriedly, not bothering to look at the title or subject. The book was over potions theory, but Draco could have sworn he read this over complicated text before. Upon inspection of the title, the novel was, in fact, the same textbook that he had been trying to understand for almost a month now. Stupid Room.
"I know," she snapped. She hated him. "She liked you. She thought you could be trusted."
"Harry, I wanted to talk about-"
"And what was the intended result?" Dumbledore prompted.
"Draco."
Aunt Bellatrix's shrill laughter knifed through the thick silence. "He just fucking killed her!"
"It’s for the best," Draco let him go.
"You're shitting me," she responded. When Draco didn't move, but gave her a pleading look, she took her seat on the other end of the couch. Draco carefully placed his feet on her lap, hopefully she wouldn't hex him. Daphne started her daily reading of the paper, making few comments. She provided explanation for Pansy whenever she had a question about whatever subject she was studying. Theo joined their makeshift study group, sitting on the floor instead of one of the chairs next to the couch. Books and notes scattered across the floor. Goyle joined them, but he never contributes much. Goyle, surprisingly wise, just nodded whenever Daphne would try to explain something. Draco would help him study later.
Draco wanted to die.
He wasn't going to, but it was nice to pretend that he was brave for a moment.
"Nothing- It's…I…"she ended with a sigh. Her eyes clouded over as she bit her lip. She studied Draco with knowing eyes. "I miss her, that's all."
They seemed to be whispering among themselves. This wasn't the best time to talk to Potter, he should just walk by and not draw any attention to himself.
"Well… the fire works in mysterious ways that aren't always comprehensible to us, but perhaps the event foretold is happening sooner for you than the other classmates," Firenze guessed.
"I have no doubt that you can."
His heart was pounding in his chest.
"My, ah," Potter was blushing a dark color that Draco could make out even with the dim light, "my friend-"
Potter stared at him, his eyes wide, his back to the window. Draco shallowed, his ears heating. He attempted to pull himself out of Daphne's arm, but she only gripped him tighter with both hands.
"I'm sorry," was all the comfort Draco could offer.
His Dark Lord had returned and proceeded to kill a young man. What else would the Dark Lord do in the name of power?
"I never said you were talking about Daphne."
"Oh, shut up, not all Slytherins are pricks."
"I'll repeat myself. I won this fight so that I wouldn't have to fight again. Who cares if I won with my fist instead of my wand?" Draco distracted.
"When you called out to her in the halls…what did you say again?"
"I'm gay," Theo grinned.
The pair sat together across from Daphne and Draco. Blaise had dressed out of his uniform, he was wearing simple robes, green. Theo was in black robes, his eyes were tired. Deep circles under his eyes.
Potter looked happy in this moment, together with his friends. Draco sighed, wishing he could surround Potter in this moment always. He seemed so carefree, the pressure of blood and war disappearing from his shoulders. There were times few and far in between that Draco could do that for Potter. Draco's hands were already dipped red with the upcoming war, he would just bring Potter down.
Of course he knows you idiot, you've taken over a hundred house point from him alone!
Draco played Quidditch, he was muscular, plus, he was tall. People liked tall people right? Draco was smart, Potter knew this from their continued Occlumency lessons. Draco knew how to network and be social, Potter could be friends with Draco's social circle. Even if Draco had to put Pansy into a headlock. Draco could grow his hair out, if that's what Potter likes.
He glanced between the pair of them. Severus was scowling, openly displeased with the situation. Dumbledore seemed almost… impressed with Draco. "And what does Mr. Potter think of this arrangement?" Dumbledore investigated.
Draco opened the stall door, his face was warm from crying, he felt so stupid. He looked down at his feet. Potter moved past him into the stall, shutting the door behind him and placing a silencing charm. Draco leaned against the stall wall, Potter stood against the opposite side. Draco didn't know what to say, he couldn't even guest what Potter wanted.
“Would it have mattered if I did?” was Potter’s answer. Potter stood across from Draco, hands at his sides, in a neutral pose. This was good, Draco was expecting to have to deal with a Potter on the defense, but Potter had surprised him once again.
come say hi to me @carpebellum on tumblr
"Yes, I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about either," Draco warned coldly, giving her his sharp grey eyes.
"I, um, already have one," Draco lied.
Potter's jaw clenched in defiance, he flexed his hand against the attention, "I'm sure you know where," Potter assured.
Draco snapped out of the shock, pulling out his wand immediately. , "Flipendo!" Pansy was pushed of off Bulstrode by the spell. Draco ran over to the Bulstrode who was still on the floor, but when Pansy lunged at the pair again, "Depulso!" Draco casted. Pansy was pushed away with stronger force, her feet barely on the floor as she hit the wall with a painful gasp.
"I know that, but… I don't think it's enough to just defend yourself against the dark arts, you have to know how to use it too."
"Hmm," Draco didn't look up from his book.
"No one ever does," Theo explained to Cho, who smiled.
"It's okay," Draco whispered, his voice weak. He watched as Potter gently traced the dark scar that was branded into Draco's skin. He didn't look at the mark with any particular disgust, just observance. Potter probably would never have a chance to study a dark mark this close. A shiver ran up Draco's spine. How could Potter be so tender with the scar on Draco's arm? Draco could barely look at the blemish on his skin without his stomach turning.
"I'm not a shade slut," she swore. Draco yelled in laughter, Daphne snorted while she shoved her hand over Draco's mouth.
Potter's eye were wide eyed as Draco grabbed his face. With all of his might, Draco slammed his nose on Potter’s forehead. The pain was bright behind his eyes, and Potter’s yelp was heard from whoever was checking the carts has the door was blown open with a powerful spell.
"Unfortunately, I have a very clear understanding of the dangers I have put myself in," Draco argued, "and unlike you I have a family to protect, so there really isn't any meaning to demeaning me, Severus."
Wake up. Breakfast. Class. Lunch. Class. Study. Class. Dinner. Study. Sleep.
Draco rolled onto his side. He allowed his hand to slip under his pillow, feeling the familiar piece of parchment. He had to find a better place to hide this. He pulled out the note he and Potter had passed to each other a couple of days ago. He stared at Potter's familiar handwriting, the hurried, casual lettering. The picture drawn underneath. He had to fix this. Fix them. Could he make Potter listen to him? Probably. At what cost? He could tell Potter the truth.
--------------------------
Draco looked up at Severus, his tone of voice surprised him. Draco had never heard Severus beg before, or speak with such emotion.
The tanks shattered. Screams of pain echoed the chambers as thoughts sliced into flesh. The clear water spilling onto the floor turning red.
"You," Draco stated stupidly, "Mystery Girl from the Mystery House," he supplied. She nodded as she sat up, she didn't appear to be injured, her robes were in disarray.
"Don't" Draco snapped. He couldn't be involved, he couldn't be a part of anything that could draw attention to himself. People keep putting the weight of their situations on Draco's shoulders. How long before Draco knelled to the pressure? How was he supposed to care for everyone, when he couldn't even care for himself?
Draco froze as his stomach curled at the sight. Rabastan's head shrunken into an infants, before re-growing then aging into a seniors.
If you wanted to say hi, I'm on tumblr @CarpeBellum
"Don’t lecture me!" she demanded, "I know the danger, Draco. I'm not stupid!"
"Severus," Dumbledore warned.
But how?
Severus sat at his desk, reading over the individual reports from each student, not acknowledging Draco's requested presence. He walked to the large, dark wooden desk. Standing before Severus, who was still ignoring him.
“I called her a stupid frog-faced bitch,” was the answer.
A body slipped by Draco's right side, a familiar smell passed him.
Dolohov didn't even have the chance to turn around before he was slashed across the back by flames. Potter was released as Dolohov was slammed into the wall face first. He slumped onto the floor, a pool of blood forming. His arm twisted at an unnatural angle that made Draco want to smile.
"Really? Cake? That's your major concern here?" Draco grinned, too heavy to laugh.
The room was filled with towering shelves that seemed impossibly high. The room was dark except for globes lined up in perfect alinement on the shelves. The light swirled, contained, trapped in the glass.
"You look well," he ignored the previous comment, his stomach tightening at the implication.
"Oh, his broomstick that I'd like up my-"
"Back to bed," he snapped,but he still felt  their eyes on his back as he hurried down the stairs.
"I thought we had no need for such formalities, Draco."
The greenhouse was ugly and dirty, but it was warm and supplied privacy for smoking.
Crabb and Goyle's eyes widened.
Draco's head felt heavy as he rose to get dressed. An early breakfast didn't sound awful, he wasn't going to get any sleep anyway. Draco dressed for the day quietly, none of his dorm mates awake yet. He made sure to grab his book bag, and with a moment of consideration the bag of healing salves, before leaving the room with careful silence.
"I think I'll let you figure that out," Potter laid his head down on Draco's lap, stretching his body over the rest of the couch.
Draco eyebrows roused in surprise, "You can't be at fault for this, sir. No apology necessary."
Stunning spell after stunning spell Draco blocked upside down. He wasn't able to get anything else out. Draco pulled out the knife that he kept against his ribs before throwing the knife towards the caster keeping him in the air.
Draco hardly noticed Potter was missing, after all.
For all she had claimed to understand, to be aware of, she hadn't met him. She didn't have blood on her hands. Her parents had protected her the best they could. They couldn't protect her now. No one could.
"I am quite sure I have no clue what you mean," Daphne bristled.
"What are you doing for Valentine's day?" Draco blurted.
Daphne didn't say anything to argue that fact.
"Well, boys, is everyone looking forward to this shit show of a year?" Crabb broke the tension the best he could.
"Seemed?" Draco raised his eyebrows.
He remained quiet out of respect for the nervousness of the situation. Daphne only blinked politely whenever spoken to, a tight lip smile on her face whenever strictly necessary. Astoria was quiet, tension rolling off of her as she kept her head down.
Silence. Daphne started to cry again. "I get no future. My only path is as a Malfoy, what am I supposed to do? Be his wife? Have his children? Then what? Is my only accomplishment going to be children that I never wanted with a man I never loved?" she sobbed. Astoria soothed her.
"She… needs something from me that I don't think I can give her," Potter's voice was quiet, he wouldn't look up.
"Potter, I mean this in the nicest why possible, but for their sakes, limit your feelings talk to Granger."
Draco had been surrounded by his family, yet he had never felt so isolated.
Draco sat in his usual seat in history, ready for his nap. He and Potter had talked into the early morning. Draco smiled at the memory. They hadn't talked about anything in particular, just talked. Potter was comfortable around him, comfortable enough to even call him a friend. They were friends. Real friends.
"What's a vacuum?"
"Malfoy," Dumbledore turned his gaze to Draco, his eyes suddenly warm and twinkling, "I know that we are not particularly close, but I was wondering of your, how to put this, your romantic chases?"
"I'll eat later, I'm not very hungry," Severus spoke gently.
The spell stopped. There was pain, then there was no pain, but Draco knew the cycle would start again. He laid in the dirt, long beyond caring about anything but the shedding in his bones.
He hurried out of the library. Cho had thought he was a victim, like her. She had offered him kindness because she had thought they had shared grief. If she knew, if anyone knew, they wouldn't have so much sympathy for him.
Does he know about the torture Narcissa put Draco through?
"I have no idea," Theo slumped. Draco laughed.
Wake up. Breakfast. Class. Lunch. Class. Study. Class. Dinner. Study. Sleep.
"Already? Potter, how did you use all of it so quickly? You do know that you're supposed to use the salve on your hand right? Not your entire body?"
"And his thick, pulsing broomstick," Daphne joined.
Draco paused, processing what she had said. "You. You've read this?" he clarified.
" 'Sorry,' doesn't mean anything if you have wasted my time, Malfoy," Severus dismissed.
So much Draco had to keep hidden from Potter. He couldn't risk the most important relationship in his life. He wouldn't risk losing Potter's trust. If Potter knew what Draco really was, he would be revolted.
"Why are you in such a good mood?" Daphne asked, interrupting his reading.
Potter squared his jaw.
"No more," Draco interrupted, "We're not turning on each other."
His father wasn’t much help either. He hadn't come to visit Draco in the three days that he has been here. Perhaps he could sense the coldness that had suddenly appeared between Draco and Narcissa, if he hadn't known about Narcissa's plans to train Draco.
"Nope. Are those scones? Potter, you shouldn't."
Draco paused, unsure if he heard exactly what Cho had said. One look at Daphne's widen eyes and plastered smile confirmed his suspicions. He glanced at Potter, who was looking at Cho with his mouth agape and his eyes widened.
"And I am about to stick the pair of you in detention," Professor McGonagall spoke from behind them. The pair mumbled their apologies before returning to their lessons.
Draco was being petty, he knew this, but he wanted to inconvenience Dumbledore. Let the man run around solving Draco's problems for once. Draco had been busting his ass and risking his life for this man, and for what? Yes, it was the right thing to do, but doing the right thing felt like swallowing glass. Let Dumbledore struggle for safety. Let Dumbledore feel the cold steel of paranoia. Let Dumbledore be the chess piece and not the player for a change.
Draco didn’t want to, she had to see that, just the idea of serving the man who killed a child twisted his gut…but if this is what he did to Cedric, a boy who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, what would he do to a traitor? To his family?
"I didn't mean to- who would want to stay?" Myrtle asked more to herself than to Draco. "I just…was too scared to leave."
He hadn't forgotten what she looked like.
His shoulder from the first attack hadn't healed correctly. Draco had spent an afternoon creating potions in case he needed anymore. He kept his face blank. "I needed to brush up on my skills, never know when that could come in handy."
"Well?" Severus tapped his foot.
"Granger and Weasley are Prefects," Draco tried, wishing for death.
Draco placed an arm over his eyes, warm and comfortable in this company. Safe. He allowed himself to drift off, trusting Daphne or Pansy to wake him if he started to stir in a nightmare. He thought of nothing in a rare moment of sleep.
But what was his comfort worth to the parents of the child he had killed? Daphne's mother smiled, a slow cruel smile that made Draco want to run. He knew the next words out of her mouth were meant to be cutting. She was going to do has much damage to him as she could. He pushed himself into cold detachment. "Well, your concern for our family is a bit late, don't you think?"
Severus gave Draco a chilling stare, "I suppose it will have to be a practice of trust."
Fuck.
Draco slipped into bed, under the heavy covers. He closed the curtains around his bed, wishing his dormmates goodnight. He placed the charm upon the curtains. He laid down, wishing for silent thoughts and simple dreams. He thought of his plan, how he was going to handle Pansy. Daphne and his engagement would happened in a little over a week. Would she grow to hate him after? Would their friendship twist into something cruel and hateful? Would Theo even survive the winter break? Or would he snap under the pressure of his father?
Draco froze at the sight of Pansy so broken, he had never seen her cry from sadness before. She only cries when she's angry, Pansy's face had remained dry during her Father's funeral.
No. That was dangerous. Stupidly dangerous. If she was caught she was dead. If she was caught she would reflect on Draco, Draco could be punished for her actions. But… no one in the DA would betray Daphne, why would the Dark Lord care about Hogwarts rumors? She would be safe with them, maybe, if she chose to, she would leave her family. Leave Draco, leave her dowry. Was it worth the risk? Daphne was going to rebel for the sake of rebellion, Draco had planted that seed long ago, but would she fight against the Dark Lord?
His search turned frantic for his book.
"Draco," Potter whispered, his eyes searching Draco's.
"Two," he put up a second finger, "you're not dead."
Draco adjusted himself to carefully lean against the pillows that kept him up. The skin on his back stretched uncomfortably, but the salve kept him mostly pain free. A tray of a beef stew and freshly made bread was set in front of him. He didn't care for manners as he dug into the meal.
Potter took the seat next to him. Draco looked out the window. Potter's arm, his thigh, was touching his. His hands itched to touch, to feel something other than pain for this too brief ride back to Hogwarts. He clasped his hands in his lap instead. If Potter knew what these hands had done, he would recoil as Draco reached out to him.
The train station had become less crowded. Draco could easily make out Theo stepping down the steps and onto the platform. He seemed stoic in a fragile way. He had enclosed himself into his firm shell, into his protective armor to face his father.
"We aren't making that assumption-" Dumbledore began.
"What-why did you-" Potter wheezed.
"Piss off, Zabini," Crabbe replied.
Draco's own hands were clammy as he swallowed his own guilt. Daphne was silent across from him, also looking down. "You must want to talk about it, no one is talking about it!" Cho was sobbing now, her voice raw.
Draco turned, his shoulders strong and his chin up. "Is he alright?" he asked, he had to know. A twist in his stomach warned him against finding out the answer, but he had to be sure.
"Potter!" he whined.
Potter didn’t move forward, “We don’t have to, it’s ok, promise.”
Astoria stopped before an old door. The smell of earth surrounded them. "I need you to promise not to freak out," she stated.
He was large, with broad shoulders and muscular arms that could be seen even with the long sleeve of his shirt. Beating eyes met his, an animalistic growl showed yellowed, sharp teeth that twisted into a smile. "Well, well, isn't it the residential murder," a low, gravelly voice greeted before taking a drag of his smoke.
"Fucking asshole," Draco responded.
“It’s not that,” Draco explained quietly as he took Potter’s hand.
Draco followed her out of the Great Hall and into the connecting hallways, taking the Profit with him. He caught up with her easily, she wasn't trying to get away from him. Daphne's hair almost glowed with the sunlight peeking out from behind the usual clouds through the windows of the small hallway they found themselves in. Away from the eyes that had followed the both of them since they were forced into engagement. She turned to face him, her lips tight, stubborn.
Potter turned, confused. Pansy crossed her arms, leaned against the table, an innocent smile on her mouth.
Potter didn't even glance at him as he walked by.
Draco stared at Dumbledore. What did he get from knowing Draco's reasoning? What was he trying to gain? Or was there nothing for him to gain, but he wanted to confirm his assumptions about Draco? What would a man like Dumbledore assume about Draco Malfoy?
"Found him."
The lips against his disappeared, his eyes opened to be met with Potter's deep green eyes behind glasses that flickered the reflection of the torches.
"Finished so soon?" a familiar voice spoke from the shadows of the bookshelves. Pansy stepped out from behind a shelf, a coy smile on her face. "You weren't hiding from me, were you?" she moved herself to stand in front of Draco, a bit too close for his liking.
He was useless.
He picked up the murder weapon, which was warm against his skin. He reached into his breast pocket, pulling out a dirty handkerchief. He sighed, his front was soaked to his skin. There no way he could clean his knife.
He sat there until he could breathe again, the panic still in his chest, but his breath calmed him. Tears dry on his face.
"Why not? You're smart, from a good family-"
"You mean Zabini."
Draco sighed, "And what would that be?"
He entered the sea of mourners - all dressed uniformly in black out of respect for the dead. People hiding their sobs echoed around him. He entered a room of people with heavy hearts for the dead as an unknown murder. He was unable to cry because if he did, his own heart would shatter, the pieces piercing his lungs. He would drown in his own blood.
"Because I don't know," Draco snapped. At Dumbledore's raised eyebrows, he responded, "He would have told me, he doesn't keep things from me."
“I came here with my parents.”
"It must be nice to be a guy, you are able to be a complete bitch to people," Daphne pointed out.
He was near a doorway. Death Eaters swarmed around him. His eyes wide at the terror for his friends.
He would make it stop.
"Don't be daft, Potter, you don't need to get me anything," Draco dismissed. He had figured Potter wouldn't get him anything.
He blinked.
"Ha, absolutely not."
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, "Just leave it," he begged.
Draco nodded with a grin, "Really, we're just friends. Our families are close," he answered.
Severus nodded, turning away to the door. "Good night Draco," he called back. After a pause, Severus ordered, "Draco, get Potter a light sleeping draught from the cabinet."
Draco sighed, "Potter, really, you're making this a much bigger deal than it is. Montague has just decided that I'm an easy target, and he has pull with the Quidditch team, so they're probably going to pick his side, but I can handle them. I promise. Don't worry about me."
"What's this?" Potter asked.
"Ah, yes. Quite strict," Umbridge bristled at her own lie.
"What spells are you teaching?" This was stupid, he already had what he needed from Harry; silence. He should just let the situation stay here, safe.
"I'm just busy Harry," Draco brushed him off.
Why? What was the secret so closely guarded?
"Why can't I sit next to you in class?" Potter asked gently.
"I don't even know you anymore, do I?" Severus muttered to himself as he started to pace.
"Adequate…"
He grabbed his bag before leaving the Common Room, keeping his head high, shoulders square. He could study in the library then wait for Potter in the Room of Hidden Things, he just needed to be alone. Draco made his way out of the Common Room, silence all around him, no one daring to gossip about Pansy with him within earshot. He hurried away from the entrance, his stomach turning. Almost running now, he turned the corner-
Mr. Weasley tightened his gaze at Draco. Draco suspected that for the first time, he was being seen as himself instead of his father's son. An iron grip found Draco's shoulder as Lucius squeezed him with almost bruising force in warning. There was a cold burning in Draco stomach that wanted to make everyone sweat. He was starving for some form of control. He liked the taste. Despite the grip on his shoulder, and his mother's icy glare, Draco didn't take his eyes off Mr. Weasley. His smile only stretched further across his face.
Draco finally arrived to the door in which Charms were held. He paused at the door, hand on the handle, listening in for an opportunity to enter unnoticed as possible. He waited until he heard Flitwick begin having students practice the charm for the day and slipped into the class with ease. He took his normal seat in the back of the large room, nodding at Professor Flitwick who was still at the front of the classroom.
Astoria chunked her goblet at him. Pansy stood and shrieked at her, dripping wet from the splash zone of the tossed goblet. Draco was so thankful for the table between her and Daphne whenever Daphne stood up, followed by her sister. Crabbe started yelling. Everyone using incredibly colorful language, their voices blistering loud.
He wants to keep a closer eye on you to make sure his grooming to going according to his plain. "I'm sure he has quiet the lesson plain created."
"Oh, but Malfoy, language," tusked one of the twins.
"I usually keep to myself," she supplied. The girl blushed as she hurriedly stuffed her supplies back into her bag. Looking at the supplies on the floor, the fact that she was muggle born was obvious. Muggle pens, pencils and notebooks were everywhere. An instant give away. Draco handed her a hot pink pencil case, she snatched it out his hand. Her shame was obvious, or perhaps she wasn't ashamed, but fearful?
Daphne would have punched him in the ribs for giving up that card.
Severus hurried to help his friend, leaving Draco by the window. Draco knew what was going to happened as his mother ran herself into Draco. He had already accepted this outcome.
Could humans die from loneliness? Could Draco starve himself of affection?
"It has to do with the flying car Ron drove into the Forbidden Forest."
"Come on, kitten, don't be such a tease."
Draco nodded, embracing her, carrying her fears as his own, "Me too." She gripped the back of his robe as she returned his hug. She was cracking. How long until she turned on Draco? Could Draco trust her? He couldn't be sure, the best course of action was control. Always control.
Draco wished he would hold Potter tighter. "It's not your fault."
"Wait," Potter stopped him again, "have you ever seen the sunrise?"
"Who's sitting here Malfoy?" Potter argued.
Potter slammed the door behind Draco as he ran in. The door clicked as it locked. A large desk loudly skirting across the room to rest in the front of the door.
"Amateur," Daphne laughed while Draco choked on his smoke.
"Why?" Dumbledore repeated.
"I missed you," Draco whispered in an answer to Potter's smile.
His stomach growled in hunger after many hours working on the cabinet. He had made progress, that would have to be enough for today. He hid his notes before leaving the room.
"Mr. Malfoy," Dobby suddenly appeared on the table.
"So… Dobby," Draco changed the subject, putting his bag on the floor and walking away from Potter. He needed to distance himself.
The silence had been growing too long. Why couldn't he bring himself to speak? Say what? What could he say? He needed to change the subject, he couldn't tell Potter those things, he couldn't even say them to himself. How could he possibly change the subject?
Potter lead him down a winding path that Draco wasn't paying attention to. The realization of where Potter was taking him crept up on Draco like a bad chill.
Potter faced Daphne, "Don't be late, I know you Slytherins like to make an entrance, but behave yourself."
The class continued as normal with Professor Sprout instructing the students to begin creating a diagram for their own planter boxes. Draco begins to work on his, sketching with a piece of charcoal on a piece of parchment, and the classroom grows increasingly quiet as the students around him follow suit. Draco allowed his mind to concentrate solely on the task at hand, the diagram began to take shape as Draco planed which plants should go where.
"I'm not sleeping very well," was the short answer.
"Just," Potter stopped him gently, "let me first," he pleated.
"Of course, Mr. Malfoy."
"You wanted to speak with me Professor?" he prompted.
"Ms. Greengrass!" McGonagall yelled. Daphne froze, still holding Pansy by the neck in the stew. "I think that's enough."
Where was he?
"Merlin, Potter-"
Draco stepped off of the train steps. The warmth from the train left him as the icy chill from the outside whipped around him. There was laughter and joyous yells all around him. Laughter that he couldn't relate to. Children were wrapped in the arms of their parents.
"But we can still hang out, right?" Potter asked, his eyes drawn in concern.
"I want you to have it, Draco, please."
Dumbledore was a patient man, but his eyes were cold. "How are you going to address this?" Dumbledore asked again.
"You've ignored Potter in his time of grieving, are you sure you want to point fingers?" Draco lashed out.
"You're going to kill him!" Potter sobbed.
"That's a generous understatement."
"Draco."
He took that has his cue to leave, making sure to grab the Quibbler on his way out. He smiled as he glanced over the article once again. Pride started rising into his chest. Potter knew how to be a little shit.
"Don't talk to me like I'm a kid," she snapped.
"Really? I bet that Daphne Greenglass would say something else," Potter argued.
Theo chuckled. Draco noticed Chang hovering around them uncertainly, a hesitant smile on her lips.
'Draco'
Draco had put in some effort not to rush after Potter like some love sick girl, which he wasn't, no matter how much he rushed.
"Harry."
He pushed by Potter and Astoria, ignoring Potter's calls after him.
Their Lord let Daphne beg. He let her gravel at his feet while he enjoyed the view.
The castle was quiet, but to Draco, for the first time in a long time walking down these halls he didn't feel so alone.
He could also admit that Potter was so gentle with him when they met last night. Potter was good, kind.
"Actually-" Draco bit his tongue as Daphne twisted his thumb backwards sharply.
Draco blinked, "What, Theo?" he snapped.
"Okay, I'm leaving," he raised, ready to leave.
“I have no idea what you are talking about,” Draco began, moving threateningly close to Potter, lowering his voice to a harsh whisper, “but even if I did, I would have enough brains to not mention it in a hallway where any other students late for their class can overhear.”
Draco rolled onto his side, propping his head on his hand while he face Potter, who was lying on his back. "Potter, how could you? You know I can't resist gossip," he fake gasped, an exaggerated hand on his chest.
"Hmm," Potter nodded, "me too."
“Everyone’s gone,” Potter explained. “Mrs. Weasley wanted to stay and help tidy up.”
"Really?" Umbridge turned to Draco, her eyes focusing on him. "Malfoy, is that true? You can see these monsters?" she investigated.
"Shut up, Malfoy," Potter joked.
Claws ranked down his back and chest as his hands clung to the front of his robes. He was gasping at his chest, needing breath.
Draco made his way through the thick underbrush of the forest behind the Greengrass's manor. After the burial, Lucius had decided that their reputation would be helped if the Malfoy family stayed for the wake. He liked to be cruel. He didn't have any power in his own home.
Watching Potter last night, so afraid for him, made him hurt down to his gut. He was so useless, he wish he could make all of this go away, but he wasn't even able to keep himself out of trouble. Why had Dumbledore stop training Potter? His abilities certainly weren't in question. Potter was more than capable, even more important, he was willing. Potter would follow Dumbledore anywhere without argument. It didn't make sense.
Want wasn't the issue. A lot of people wanted a lot of things and didn't get anything. The action behind that want is what concerned Draco.
"Holy shit, I was just guessing. Fuck that's brilliant," Blaise barked.
Fire blossomed in Draco's gut. His heart pounded in his chest. Claws of hot fury ran down his back as his wand lengthened into a whip of fire.
Draco glanced in the blank space next to Goyle's trunk. What would Potter think if he knew?
Warmth spread from his nose to his forehead, easing the headache he didn't realized he had. Draco nodded in thanks before beginning his lunch.
Draco turned the corner, stepping into the role given to him.
Montague shouldn't be a problem, Draco had shown what would happen if Montague crossed him again. Draco wondered how many other Slytherin students share Montague's distaste for Draco. Was Draco public humiliation enough to keep his standing at Hogwarts? He might be making more enemies than allies. Allies were necessary, even in the superficial sense.
His father's knee was an old injury from the First War, news about such was unnecessary. Was his father in danger? His mother was warning him, but about what exactly?
“How are you getting home?” Potter asked.
"I called you Death Eater Scum," Finnigan drew out for Draco.
"You should hurry along to class, Malfoy," Umbridge dismissed to Draco's glee. He tried not to seem too hurried.
The walls rippled with pale blue light from the torches lined the long hallway. The Department of Mysteries was tiled by black, smooth bricks. The glassy surface of the walls, floor and ceiling caused the light to constantly shift with fluid movement.
The group walked to the couch. Montague looked down at Blaise and Bulstrode on the couch with his hands in his pockets, an easy smile on his lips. "Shoo, shoo," Pansy waved them away with her fingers.
"Bulstrode," he listed.
"I'm not weak," Potter looked up his voice sure but his eyes tired.
Pansy stood up, her wrist to her forehead, the other hand supplying support as she leaned against the table dramatically. "With his fine arse I always check out in Quidditch and his strong hands," Pansy swooned.
He would always hurt Potter, Draco realized then. Maybe one day, if they both survived whatever the future held for them, Draco would be able to be someone Potter cares for without harming him.
"I don't start fights, but I will finish one," Draco disagreed. The last thing the Slytherins needed was more attention. Daphne snorted loudly next to him. Astoria hushed her quickly.
"Hey, um," Draco's usually slick tongue tied itself into a knot. How was he supposed to put into words everything? "I'm sorry that I couldn't warn you that Umbridge had found the DA."
"Don't make mistakes," was her response.
For the first time in months, he didn't need to worry about screams being heard from his basement. He didn’t need to cover his ears to block the torture taking place in his home. What remained of his home.
Not with his father a known Death Eater locked away in Azkaban. No, everyone avoided Draco like the plague. Theo and Crabbe's fathers were also arrested. Crabbe's mother had taken him out of school that morning.
The constant clicking of clocks quieted as they entered the office. Rabastan's screams became almost distant.
Spells flew above Draco on the cold stone floor. Yells violent as duels went on. Draco laid forgotten.
This would be his last year in the castle, he knew this fact in his bones. He would either not make it to breath next year, or he would be clawed into his duties under his Lord.
This is my first fandom work, comments would be appreciated :)
Draco closed his eyes at the thought. He didn’t have time for panic. He must have a clear mind. Clear waters unmuddied by vulnerability.
"How observant," she supplied.
"Come up with a better nickname."
"I'll just have to be more clever," Draco grinned, not wanting to make Potter worry.
"Potter…"
Draco bowed to their Lord. He kept his gaze down as he walked past his godfather. He walked around the manor, not wanting to face his peers. The flowerbeds lining the manor had closed pedals in the night.
"I didn't know you had wizard cousins."
"I can't believe he's the new DA professor," Potter complained. "What was Dumbledore thinking?"
With a knee on Finnigan's chest, Draco continued to hit him with tightly closed fist.
--------------------------
"I need you, Daphne. You can't fight for Astoria if you don't know how."
"Just let it go," he deflated.
So... this is it for this story.
It was him. He was Daphne's betrothed. He would have to marry her in two years, be her husband, raise their children. How? How could he be suspected to do that? Support a family? Have a family before the age of twenty? Why? He couldn't, he wouldn't.
"Yes, I am, but not without reason," Draco agreed easily, "but recently I've stopped fighting with you publicly-"
Finnigan was quick to face Draco, Potter's eyes widen in concern. "Seamus, don't answer-" Potter tried to pull Finnigan back.
Being constantly surrounded by those who only wish to do Potter harm had forced Draco to face how dangerous this situation was. A constant twisting had settled into his chest. Draco wasn't privy to the inner workings of the web. His Lord hadn't even made an appearance at Draco's betrothal. Gaining information in that house was trying to theorize how dust would settle biased on air patterns.
Draco turned to Potter, who met his eyes. "For now," he whispered. Potter nodded, never breaking Draco's gaze. A blush crawled up his neck.
"Let's have this conversation like adults, shall we?" Draco interrupted.
Potter squeezed his forearm from where he still had his hand, "Only technically."
"Broomstick," Daphne reminded Pansy.
After Daphne pulled away from the embrace, she took his hand to lead him to the entrance way. Her blond hair flowed behind her, her hand was gloved in pale yellow.
"Blood is blood," his Lord noted in thought. "Draco…" His stomach plummeted as his Lord studied him under his red eyes. His heart rate sped up, begging him to run. Draco held his Lord's gaze, kept his face and mind neutral. Comfortable. Trusting. "Is this your way of making amends?"
"I'm going to leave now," he dismissed himself.
Draco didn’t stop walking, better to have a house elf retrieve his truck. The cold night air greeted him as he stepped off of the train. Fuck, where was everyone? He spent what felt like five minutes with Potter and they missed the fucking carriages to the castle?
There was nothing for him to do.
The slap that was meant for Daphne stung against his cheek.
Daphne reach for his hand. "Hey, we are all powerless here. What can we be expected to do? Any move could be our last," she comforted.
"Don't lecture me on things I already know," he argued back.
His father's knuckles turned white on his grip of his cane.
Draco was starting to understand just how manipulative the Dark Lord was. No need for formalities one moment. Bathing in blood the next. The Dark Lord walked the line of confidant and executioner. Draco had to gain his trust.
He lifted Finnigan by the front of his shirt, kneeling in front of him. Finnigan's eye was already almost swollen shut. Everyone was watching them. Everyone knew where the battle lines were being drawn.
Draco licked his teeth, steading Severus with a glare. "I thought we were waiting for Professor Dumbledore, sir," he drew out 'sir' so that the word meant 'arse.'
Thankfully, they had found each other. Both were being pushed aside by their friends, or having to take on simple abuse. If only there was a way for them to make friends outside of the Slytherin House. Blaise was known for having a sharp personality, and he also had a notorious black widow for a mother. No one was looking to reach out to him for friendship. Bulstrode was just plain aggressive.
Draco watched her leave, he could probably hex her and get away with it. Potter caught his gaze, Draco's face heated, his stomach flipping inside out. Potter gave him a small smile before turning away to leave.
“You know about what happens in the Room of Requirement,” the boy growled quietly, turning Draco to face him.
His mother turned to her husband, screaming at him, "Don’t you dare! You're the reason why our son just sliced a girl's throat in our home!"
“And why would I ever talk to the likes of you?” Draco responded to the absurd request.
Daphne would laugh at the situation.
"Interrupting your instructor, means for detention, Potter. I will see you after dinner tonight and fifty points from Gryffindor."
“I...how...” Potter struggled for words before he reached out for Draco. His hand hovering over his left arm. Potter hesitated, and Draco's heart sunk into his stomach.
But he couldn't. The panic still rose in his chest, he was worthless to fight against it. He sobbed still, letting the tears come, his breath still short.
“Well then, Mystery Girl from a Mystery House, I suggest you try not to aggravate Umbridge anytime soon; no matter how entertaining it may be,” the time was up for Draco, time to return to his world.
Few students passed them, but everyone kept their eyes downcast. Curious, what rumors surrounded him now? Would other students try to take a stab at the Death Eater? Would he have to defend himself? Reach down to that dark side of himself that enjoyed the control that came with causing pain and indulge for a bit? If he wasn't careful, violence would become to him what a bad smoking habit became to Daphne.
Draco didn't keep up with the conversation as the world went by with the gentle sound of the train whirling by. He wasn't expected to continue conversation, he had nothing to prove. His peers were trying to prove themselves to him.
"How big of a scene was it?" Draco asked; he needed to know damage control.
This is my first fandom work, let me know what you think :)
"Knock," Severus snapped behind him.
"Event?"
"Not until he makes progress," Severus dismissed, "you didn't make any progress before because you coddled him."
Dumbledore listened intently, Severus listened from behind him. Draco finished his explanation, but they just shared a glance and didn't say anything. Draco's pulse quickened at the silence shared between them. They seemed to want something more from Draco, with Snape's temper today, Draco didn't want to know what Dumbledore wanted from him.
"None the less, perhaps Severus would be a better match," suggested Dumbledore.
The silence was what noted Draco that he was supposed to say something.
He tried to push past her, but Quidditch had made Cho strong. She stepped in front of him with her hands on his shoulders. She made him stop.
No one would suspect him now.
He also didn't like the way Potter paused when he saw one of the only two empty seats in the classroom was next to Draco.
Potter was sitting in his usual spot, across from his friends. What Draco wasn't expecting, was Potter to be looking right at him. Draco broke his gaze quickly with a blush. He glanced up again after a moment, Potter was still looking at him. Draco could feel his stomach turn. He returned Potter's gaze coolly.
He took on her entire weight as she couldn't support herself. Draco wrapped one arm around her waist, gently lowering her to the ground as her eyes became unseeing.
His day, somehow, was managing to only get worst.
"Oh, I hadn't said anything, you were just looking at me-"
"I don't supply," shrugged Draco.
"Past tense? Darling, you have been, will be, and currently are infatuated with Harry Potter," Pansy grinned teasingly.
Daphne nodded, unable to make words. Any words she had prepared had left her in her terror.
Daphne left quickly, she was already standing when the train stopped. Draco took his time, wanting to stay on the train until it reached the end on the line. He wanted to disappear until he could return to this train, but on the way back to Hogwarts, to Potter. Theo seemed as if he was about to vomit. Blaise couldn't take his eyes off of him.
Draco tightened his jaw, he didn't give Severus the satisfaction of a result. Not a blink. Not a tighten of knuckles. Not a quirk of a jaw.
"Would you like a lemon cake, young Malfoy?" the Headmaster asked as he produced desert on a small plate.
Severus stood up slowly, resting his palms on the desk. "I'm just trying to help you, Draco. You are just a boy."
Blaise smiled tightly, "Just my mother and I this year, thankfully."
'Same time same place?' Potter asked.
The girl gives her permission. Draco pulled his wand from his bag at his side, “Tergeo,” Draco began, clearing any dried blood from the seeping wound.
"I wouldn't be here if someone did," Draco explained, jumping to his questions. "What's wrong? Why did we have to meet? Did you have a vision?"
Potter nodded, biting his lip. When he didn't say anything more, Draco allowed himself to be dismissed, turning towards the exit.
Pansy looked up at Bulstrode, not affected by her size. Everyone waited for a person to make the first move. Draco was frozen to the spot, any move he made could worsen the situation.
His blood ran cold as he began to search for the two initials of the person who was always at the center of trouble.
"You should probably look into the homelife then Headmaster."
He wondered what Potter was doing. He wondered what type of teacher Potter was. Potter was probably brilliant at teaching, but what spells was he showing the DA? Had he moved onto more advance defense spells? Perhaps Draco should show Potter what spells would be most often used against him in battle, some of them wouldn't be covered in a Hogwarts education. Draco should make a list.
Perhaps Draco was overthinking this situation. He had always wanted to be Potter's friend, settling for sworn enemy whenever he was rejected. Draco was desperate for some sort of relationship that was purely friendly, not a coerced ally like he had with Daphne. Potter probably just didn't want to sit in front of the class, or was tired of his shadows arguing. There was no reason to assume he would want to sit next to Draco to be friendly. Why would he? Potter had his friends, good friends. Friends that were good. No, Potter had no need to be friends with Draco.
The two shared a quiet moment between them over gentle smiles. Potter reached out and squeezed his hand.
The pair dispersed into chuckles between them. The cloak of shame Draco had wrapped himself in was lifted from his shoulders as Potter grinned at him.
"Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore looked down at Draco. A twisting sensation settled inside his stomach, but Draco kept his chilled demeaner. "You would mind explaining to me what happened earlier today with Ms. Parkinson?" Dumbledore asked, "You're not in any trouble, we are just trying to have an understanding of the events."
"Fuck, Susan we have to g-"
Yes, Draco, they're Prefects, and you're an idiot.
"You’re not a burden," Draco hugged him tighter. Potter laid his head on Draco's shoulder. He held him firmly as he tried to prove to Potter that he wanted him to lay his worries on Draco. He could care for him. He wanted to.
The empty halls swayed around him. He stumbled to a door.
"I have them somewhere Theo." Draco began to rummage through the unorganized stacks of combined notes the three supplied. He found them, neatly stacked together, naturally under everything else on the farthest end of the table that could fit twelve people easily. Draco handed the summaries to Daphne who had her hand outstretched, her eyes staying glued to the parchment in front of her as she dropped the notes lazily on top of Theo’s head. Theo didn't respond.
"I don't need you to take care of me. I'm not yours."
He slumped in his seat. Maybe if he pretended to already be asleep Pansy wouldn't sit next to him, as she usually did. No matter how much Draco could dream, he knew that Pansy would be ready to skin him and he wasn't particularly looking forward to it. Perhaps he would become Professor Binns' teaching assistant in the afterlife, dammed to be forever stuck in this awful classroom listening to boring lectures forever. Actually… that didn't sound too bad.
They lapped into comfortable conversation, huddled together in the cold. Draco exploded into tease whenever Potter tried to take a drag of his cigarette. His lungs weren't use to the heat, so he coughed violently behind laughter. He squinted his nose at the taste.
Lucius easily defected the spell. The sounding of breaking glass sent claws down Draco's back. Everyone raised their wands. Potter held a glowing ball to his chest.
The pair sat in silence as they nibbled on the cookies. Potter had snagged them from Longbottom, whose grandmother had sent them as she does once a month. Draco tried not to think about how his own mother hadn't sent a kind word his way despite being told of the attack that morning. He wouldn't have expected her to, not with where their relationship was, but his heart still felt the pang of pain.
Potter smiled, Draco's chest felt light. Potter examined the plain metal container, looking puzzled.
Draco rolled his eyes, Potter elbowed him gently with a grin. "We'll be leaving now," Draco dismissed, to which Severus raised his eyebrows. The pair turned around, but was only able to walk a couple of feet before Severus called out to them.
"Okay with what?" Draco investigated.
"How was everyone's break?" Theo asked. Draco took a large bite of his porridge so he didn't have to talk as Crabbe and Goyle struggled for answer.
Rabastan was tackled to the ground before he could kill Draco. Potter was rolled onto his back by the larger man. Yells vibrated against the walls.
A grown of frustration answered Draco, "What was up with that? Why does she care if I hang out with Hermione?"
"Not ones that I can't win," Draco joked, but Mafalda just frowned in thought. "What's wrong?" he investigated.
This one blistered pain across his cheek.
"Clear my mind?" Potter repeated.
He cried, weeping into his arms which were wrapped around him, until Daphne pulled Draco into a tight hug that allowed him to sob into her shoulder. He leaned against her, allowing his heart to overfill and his sobs to come as they did.
"I don't love."
Draco sighed, they saw a scared child that was out of his depths, but Draco had already taught himself how to swim without drowning. Draco rested his hands on his hips, they weren't going to get anywhere with the tacit they were using. "I'm going to continue to teach Potter Occlumency, we'll start using Severus's private study to ensure privacy. I can assure you that I am adequate enough to teach," he lectured.
"Told anyone else what?" Potter replied dumbly.
"I don't need her notes," he excused himself.
The blood dried and darkened on his body. Crusting over his skin as a constant reminder of his deed.
A hard pinch on his cheek forced his attention forward. His Aunt Bellatrix sneered in his face, her breath on him. "Go say 'Hi!' to your friends," she hissed with a grin from ear to ear.
"Potter? What's happened?" but he couldn't get a word in over Dobby's distressed ranting. "Dobby-" he took Dobby's tiny shoulders gently in his hands "-what happened?"
Severus glared at him, but didn't move to take the book from Draco. "If you're not assisting, why don't you leave then?" Severus barked. He was getting tired.
"Harry Potter, The Boy who Lived?" she mocked.
The pair pulled Granger by her shoulders to drape her arms over their shoulders. They arranged her to where she was carried between him and Longbottom before they stood. Granger's arms arranged across their shoulders. Their hands under each of her knees. Her head sloped onto Draco's shoulder. The smell of blood in his nose. The ribbons of crimson dripping down his shoulder.
“I know you can hear me!”
Pansy visibly swallowed when she looked away from the newspaper. Tense silence gripped the students. Daphne was bold, she was painfully bold. She would shove her point into your face whenever the subject had even been acknowledged, but carefully ignored.
