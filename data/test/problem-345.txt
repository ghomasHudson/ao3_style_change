He felt another involuntary gulp coming as he tried to form the words in his mouth. Swallowing it down, Harry exhaled and dropped his gaze. “Er. A lot, I guess.” Lifting his eyes to her again he saw her brow furrow before quickly adding, “I’m sorry. I should have seen you sooner. It’s just… I’ve been busy, Gin.”
“Yeah, that Lee Jordan,” Harry said as he shared a look with Seamus. “Let me know if he’s bought anything here before this idiot doubles up on presents.”
Realising he had spent far too long fixating on Malfoy’s face, Harry flushed. “I live in the village,” he explained.
That seemed to cheer Dean up enough as both men cheered, drawing a toothy grin from Harry as he stepped down off the barstool. Flicking them a thumbs up he made his way through the crowded pub and squeezed past the cluster of stools at the end of the bar, finally stepping into the bathroom and able to draw the sheet of names from his pocket along with a whittled down pencil stub that he could barely get his fingers around.
It had been a beautiful moment, shattered by Nick shouting as he fell to the ground. Teddy stood above him, looking as if he may have been responsible for pushing him.
His few minutes of pondering seemed to be all the time Hermione had needed to pause her research long enough to come and yell at him. Harry managed to convince her not to drag him to St. Mungo’s then and there but he should have known better than to think he’d left the conversation with the upper hand.
“I guess not,” Harry agreed even as he glared, pouting slightly. He studied Draco’s face for a moment as he thought on his words, some of his earlier actions making more sense in the new light. “You really thought I just wanted to experiment?” He laughed, watching Draco grumble as he did so. “There are so many less complicated people I could have done that with, you idiot.”
Raising her eyebrow almost imperceptibly, Healer Benson shook her head. “You were expecting anything different?”
“Not at all. You weren’t in the place to look deeper when everything was happening and then the war fucked you up too much. I see that every single day. I know you still have nightmares.” She looked at him as if to deny it but he knew better, certain that some nights she heard his screams even through the strong silencing charms on his room. Nodding, she leaned forward to rest her hands on the table. “I know you struggle to think of doing anything other than your Auror job because you’ve always had to be responsible for fighting the bad guys. But maybe it’s time you let someone else do that. Maybe you deserve to be happy without winning everyone else’s battles, Harry.”
“I just don’t want any more fighting,” Harry sighed, not realising just how true those words were until now. “And I don’t think you really do either.”
Being central to Voldemort’s defeat had done a lot for all of them as far as connections were concerned; Harry resented this and wished everyone would just leave him be, but Hermione had pounced on the opportunities presented with as much dedication as only she could possess. Hermione had taken it upon herself to challenge a lot of the legislation that had been changed during the past few years and as she did so she was trying to advance older laws that many might be more partial to questioning now that Voldemort’s motives were laid bare for all to see.
Turning to glare at Harry—which was incredibly unfair, seeing as he’d done nothing more than witness the spectacle—Malfoy huffed. “I’ll be needing an owl as well then, I suppose.”
“He has not!” Harry cried, before hastily dropping his voice as he noticed heads turning their direction. “He has not.”
“Er,” Harry began uncomfortably, realising that all of the children surrounding him were staring. “Did Scorpius tell you that?”
Walking back to her seat, she kept her gaze trained on Harry. “Usually my first question in this scenario would be: what is Draco Malfoy doing in my department? However, somehow I had another more pressing question today: how long has he been shagging my best friend and
He couldn’t help himself; Harry curled over his stomach as the laughter took hold and shook through his body. Unsure if the scoff that came from Malfoy’s direction was imagined or not, he took another moment before straightening up and making eye contact with the blonde, wiping the corners of his eyes.
Albus shrugged, mouth full of potatoes. “Says a lot about his dad,” he said between chews. “He sounds nice. I don’t think Scorp’s ever said anything bad about his dad.”
“Perhaps it’s time we called each other by our names.” Harry caught Malfoy’s eye as his head swivelled to look back at where he sat on the couch, something that felt like both a challenge and an invitation passing between them. “Draco.”
“This? Are you bloody—Harry, there is no this.” Draco sat back down to lean across the table and whispered his outrage. “There is no this, you understand? You’re having your midlife crisis two decades too early and I’m not about to ruin my life just because you’re determined to ruin yours. You’re, what, basing this off a comment that my wife made many years ago when we were both very different people.”
“And because neither of them has the self restraint to not make a scene,” Ginny added. “You’ll likely just end up pushing him against a wall and doing unimaginable things to one another at a Ministry function.”
“Er, kinda.” He shrugged, knowing there was no point hiding the details from her anymore. “He’s busy with work anyway, and we’ve both got kids—”
Finally closing the distance Harry cut off the end of Draco’s words and pressed their lips together, pushing Draco up against the cabinet. He pulled away after a moment, breathy.
It had been several weeks since that night and Draco still wasn’t sure he was ready for this. It took every ounce of courage not to turn on his heels and flee—even with Potter standing beside him—and he cursed himself for being so easily swayed by persuasive green eyes accompanied by poorly-pronounced Latin words.
Harry paused for a moment and Draco’s heart sank into his stomach, wishing he’d simply kept his mouth shut.
Rolling his eyes, Draco shook his head even as the hesitance was still plainly written across his face. “Ever the dramatist, Potter.”
Malfoy sighed. “Just because I don’t want to hex you anymore doesn’t mean I want to be your friend, Potter.”
“You’re utterly hopeless,” she muttered fondly. “Yes, if only because I’m loathe to be seen with you wearing them as they are.”
Letting out a frustrated groan, Harry ran a hand through his hair as he cursed the day he’d decided to stand up for Draco in Eeylops and every single day since then that he’d allowed himself to think that maybe they could put the past behind them. Never mind the fact that it wasn’t the past that seemed to be their problem anymore; it was easier to dwell on old mistakes than it was to contemplate a future that he couldn’t have. Loathe as he was to admit it, Harry knew Draco was protecting himself and both of their best interests by keeping his distance, but knowing that only angered him further.
“My parents want me married soon. Well, my father does; I know he’s in Azkaban—which is where mother is right now, incidentally, or she'd be here too—but his opinions still hold a lot of weight with mother. She also wants me to have someone keeping me company around the Manor after father’s eventual release, because they’ll be taking off to one of the properties in France. Something about… Less horrible memories, more opportunities.”
“Sure, Malfoy. Really seemed like you were doing just fine on your own.” Harry winced at the nasty tone that came out of his mouth, a habit built after so many years of rivalry. He grimaced, shaking his head. “Sorry. I didn’t really mean to come in like that but I heard him from the street…”
“He told you they’re getting divorced?” Harry asked, barely keeping his jaw from dropping at the casual nature with which his son divulged this information.
She snorted, which quickly gave way to a full bellied roaring chuckle as she was unable to hold it in any longer. “About bloody time,” she managed between laughs, shaking roughly.
Absorbed as he was by his thoughts, Harry misjudged his distance from Malfoy after closing the door and jerked back quickly, knocking over the umbrella stand by the door. He groaned as the curtains beside him flung open and Walburga’s portrait began to shout.
Murmuring to herself in the background for a while as she drew out individual colours to inspect, Harry barely noticed Healer Benson until she addressed him again.
Shaking his head, Draco’s voice was small as he dropped his eyes to the pavement. “You really want this?”
Waving goodbye, Draco turned to meet Harry’s eyes as the corners of his mouth pulled up in a slight smile. “I think we’ll do the lights again this year. Care to join us?”
Draco sighed, running a hand through the loose strands of hair that framed his face. “I just… It’s inadvisable.”
“Nice to hear you say I’m thinking at all,” Harry retorted, watching Draco roll his eyes in response. “It’s a lot to think on, that’s all.”
“That the Prophet’s a load of shit?” Harry guessed, unsure what Draco was getting at. “That we ought to protest outside the Ministry until they gave us better quality journalism?”
“He came by… Oh, that daft bugger.” She sighed, raising her hands in frustration. “Why are you both so impossibly hopeless?”
John merely grunted, turning on his heel and leaving the store. Harry watched as he merged into the crowd and became just one of many roaming the streets today, a sea of faces drifting past.
“Oh yeah,” Harry said, turning back to look at the flames as he tapped at Draco’s hands on his shoulders in hopes of more massaging. “What about it?”
He’d left it open-ended, being as truthful as he could in that he wasn’t sure they could make things work if there wasn’t a more definitive commitment being made, and then respected Draco’s wishes and ceased communication. It had been harder than he’d anticipated; though many of his letters had gone unanswered, it had still felt like there was something between him. Now he was left with nothing but a Draco shaped hole in his chest that he refused to let heal.
He nodded, not trusting his voice at that moment. Seeing her smile even as tears threatened to spill from her eyes, he turned his head to allow her a moment of discretion before clearing his throat.
The pleading look in Harry’s eyes as he turned to face Draco was all the confirmation he would ever need. “I never want to go back there. Not even for that.”
Percy was a sporadic attender of Weasley lunches these days, often too wrapped up in working overtime—or being a pompous arsehole—to stop by. Quite frankly, Harry didn’t care much for the man. They’d crossed paths a few times during his Auror days and none of the memories were particularly pleasant, with Hermione’s reports of interdepartmental negotiations reaffirming this; she said they were a downright horror if he was present.
“Don’t tell me you wouldn’t do the same if you knew you’d get away with it. You, who even now is suspicious of my motives?”
Looking back and forth between Malfoy’s face and the bird—Hestia, he corrected—Harry could do nothing but shrug. “I… guess so?”
“What did you do to Malfoy?” She whispered, waving Molly away from where she was hovering in the hallway as she raised her voice. “You can have him in a minute mum, he’s got some explaining to do right now.”
The rest of their time together was overshadowed by the news; Harry knew Ron was trying to lift his mood and though he hoped he didn’t seem too consumed by his own thoughts he suspected his lack of focus was obvious. After a few more glasses he had bid Ron adieu, flooing home and immediately dropping into his favourite chair by the fire. This was hardly unexpected; Draco had sent news of Astoria’s pregnancy in his final letter earlier this year. It had just shocked him to find out about it secondhand through an article. He’d hoped to at least hear some word from Draco about it, not have his best mate clue him in and then send him concerned looks for the following hour.
Harry was in the kitchen clearing up the last of their glasses when he heard the familiar voice speaking in muted tones in the lounge. Ginny’s quick reflexes were the only thing that had her wand out fast enough to slow the glass that slipped from his hand, leaving enough time for her to catch it after crossing the room from where she’d waited in the doorway.
“Just Harry’s fine,” he interjected as he tried not to suddenly curl in on himself. Why did his chest feel like it was burning from the inside out? What had she done?
Ron stopped talking abruptly as he caught sight of something behind Harry's shoulder, face becoming solemn. Turning slowly, his suspicions were confirmed as he saw Ginny standing in the doorway.
Nodding, Malfoy looked almost uncomfortable. “I’d been thinking about it for a while. Mother was the one to convince me in the end.”
“We? Oh, you and Ginevra.” There was a pause as he hesitated, before reaching forward to finish the rest of his coffee. “I’ll be in France with mother, I’m afraid.”
Ron nodded and turned to leave but Hermione hesitated, eyes darting quickly between the healer and Harry. Clearly the urge to speak was too great and felt a pang of familiarity; he might hate being here, but Hermione’s consistency tugged at something warm deep inside him.
She gave him a peck on the cheek before leaving him sitting at the table on his own, feeling more confused than ever. Harry took that as his cue and with one last lingering glance at Malfoy—which he promptly pretended never happened—he slid off the barstool, grabbed his jacket from where it had fallen to the floor and pulled it on as he made his way to the exit, along with the gloves and beanie he’d left tucked into the pockets.
between his bed and the rest of the room and hated to think of what his nightmares must have brought about in him.
They’d had quite the year since their last Christmas light adventure. Draco adamantly refused to have Harry over to the manor, or to come visit Harry in Edington despite Ginny having moved into her own flat early in the year. Instead they had met a few times at muggle cafes, reminding Harry of what felt like a lifetime ago before they’d both become fathers and had so much more responsibility. Letters were exchanged with more regularity and even outside of September, they had crossed paths seeing Teddy many times. It was nothing Harry could call more than friendship, but he was more than happy for it to remain so, as long as Draco stayed in his life.
“We have a similar saying in the Muggle world, I think. What’s mine is yours. Actually no, it’s used in a very different ritual, I guess… I don’t know.”
“Oh.” Grumbling at her as he cheered inwardly at how quickly she’d glossed over his hesitation to talk, Harry slumped his shoulders and gave a sad nod. “I mean, I get it…”
“She doesn’t usually like strangers,” came the voice from behind the counter. “So I think you’ve really made an impression.”
In the end it turned out he needn’t have worried. Albus and Scorpius were too delighted at the prospect of more time together to allow anyone’s mood to dampen, and even James seemed to brood a bit less as the day passed. After Cillor had served lunch in the East Wing, Draco had suggested they go outside to see the grounds and that’s how they had ended up in their current predicament: supervising a snowball fight that seemed to suspiciously catch them in the middle more often than not.
“—and I… Oh.” Harry felt his jaw go slack as he tilted his head back to look at Draco once again, watching him smile nervously as he procured a ring from seemingly thin air.
in return along with his thanks, overjoyed that Draco’s owl had been instructed to wait for a response. As he watched her fly off into the night he felt his heart swelling; he wasn’t stupid enough to read too much into this, this time around. But Draco had extended the olive branch to at least be civil with one another and Harry was gladly taking it, grateful for the promise it held.
Stepping forward once more, Harry lifted Draco’s chin with a finger, eyes locked on his. “No. You’re hard to regret, Draco.” Pressing a chaste kiss against the other man’s mouth, he felt the corners of Draco’s lips pull up in a serene smile.
There wasn’t much rhyme or reason to any of Draco’s mutterings but it had clearly meant enough to him that he’d excused himself promptly and all but sprinted out the door to disapparate. That had been Thursday, and by the time Sunday rolled around and Harry had been hoping to pry some answers or even just sensical words from the other man, Draco had owled to say he would have to take a rain check on their visit to
“Take care of this one please, both of you.” Healer Benson nodded to Ron and Hermione in turn before stepping aside to let Harry pass. “Make sure he gets some sleep.”
“I didn’t say that. I deserve more than a man in love with someone else—no, let me finish. I’m not about to let our children grow up unhappy, Harry. Part of that is showing them how love works, and I think we’re going to be better as friends when we figure all of this out. Stop that!”
“Okay.” Harry waited to see if she would say anything further and realising she really wasn’t going to explain more, he shrugged. “I’ll talk to him.”
Harry’s head came down to rest in his hands, a heavy sigh blowing his napkin across the table. “You’re right. I’m sorry.”
Hearing the pain, anger and need for approval that went unsaid, Draco started to reach a hand towards Harry’s shoulder before thinking better of it, wary that it might be too much. “
Teddy sprinted down the hallway towards the sitting room, not bothering to give Harry an answer. He took that as an invitation to follow and quickly shucked off his oversized coat and snow-dampened boots by the door, opting to keep his beanie and gloves on while he defrosted a little longer. Walking down the hallway behind Andromeda brought him closer and closer to where Malfoy stood, the blonde only seeming to come to his senses and step back out of the doorway as Harry came close enough to smell sandalwood and—was that coriander?
It was very rare these days that Harry resented Hermione’s astute observation skills. With her work getting busier they’d seen less of each other in recent months and for the most part, when they did see one another he talked openly and didn’t feel like he was hiding anything. The one secret he was keeping was also the topic that most of his friends had given up on, instead supporting Harry’s decision to focus on the children and occasionally asking him to volunteer his time when they needed some extra hands.
Straightening up, it was evident in Malfoy’s expression that he hadn’t expected to see Harry here either. There was no scorn in his expression, none of the malice those eyes had once held. Just a wary caution that Harry felt echoed in his chest, along with a tentative want for something more. A hesitant question as to whether they could put it all behind them and hold civil conversation for the remainder of the morning; surely that wasn’t too much to ask?
“You do your best pacing there,” she said as she shrugged out of her coat. “That, and I saw the light from the street.”
I couldn’t have left you to burn. Those flames…” Turning his head to look at the door again, Harry shuddered as he pressed his eyes closed. “And you saved me at the Manor, anyway.”
Ginny rolled her eyes, leaning back into her seat. “You’re such a stubborn idiot. Sure, Harry. Whatever you say.”
Harry tipped back the rest of his drink before clearing his throat. “Have you just come over here to embarrass me then? I thought Gin was doing a good enough job of that on her own.”
Seeing James looking across the room at Draco in the chair above him, Harry tensed slightly beneath Draco’s hands, eyes opening fully to preempt any bad behaviour before it could take off. Something seemed to transpire between them, a conversation held with their eyes alone—it reminded him of Ron and Hermione and his heart ached with the nostalgia—before there was a subtle nod from James. Curious, Harry turned his head up to look at Draco who glanced away as soon as their eyes met.
“Right.” Pausing, Harry tried and failed to make sense of her words. “Should something have changed?”
“Stop defending him! All of you, I’m sick of it. Somethings going to happen at Christmas, just you wait and see.”
Harry didn’t let himself watch Draco walk away, directing all of his attention towards finishing the drink before him even as the taste was bittered by the conversation he’d never expected to have.
Grateful for the distraction, Harry nodded quickly. “We spent a lot of time repairing it after the — after school, and all that. Aside from Walburga out there, everything fixed up quite nicely.”
Certain of the fact that he saw James wink at Draco as he left the room, Harry again turned to the man behind him, demanding answers.
Draco was grinning at him. Not smirking, not sneering, but actually grinning, and Harry had to respond with a smile of his own. “You finally get my jokes,” Draco commented with a touch of approval. “After all those years where I thought maybe you just were born without a sense of humor.”
Draco’s eighth year had not been as he was expecting. Not that he had really expected to live to see eighth year at all. He had made his peace with the fact that he would not survive the war, yet here he was, eighteen years old and somehow, alive. Not just alive, but back at Hogwarts, taking lessons and preparing for his NEWTs as if nothing at all had happened.
Harry tugged on his sleeve again, sharp and urgent, and he saw the moment Draco understood it was him. Draco shifted a bit and turned toward the doors. “Fine, Mother. Just need to get a bit of fresh air. I’ll be back.”
Draco and Harry both stared open-mouthed at Snape. After several excruciatingly silent moments, Harry closed his eyes and frowned. “Now that you mention it, my magic does feel… different.”
Harry had never seen Draco look so grave and determined as when they sped back toward the Slytherins. His two former best friends had shouted awful things at him, called him names Harry couldn’t have even imagined when Draco was his enemy, then set the room ablaze. Yet here Draco was, risking his life for them. Grabbing Goyle by the arm and hoisting his enormous body onto his broom. Waiting to make sure Harry did the same for Crabbe. Allowing Goyle to clutch the back of his shirt for stability as they all, together, raced toward the narrowing exit.
Narcissa and Lucius looked worried and a bit lost as Draco walked away, but Draco never looked back. Harry fell into step a bit behind him, following him down the stairs and into the deserted and demolished courtyard. Draco looked around, making sure nobody else was there.
They were surrounded on all sides by the all-consuming flames. The wall of enchanted water he had conjured lasted hardly a moment before it was gone in a mist, as if it had never been there at all.
Harry sat back in a squashy armchair by the fireplace and felt as though if he closed his eyes he would be asleep within moments. He had asked the house elves to bring dinner to the dorm for himself, Luna, and Draco, as nobody seemed keen to brave the Great Hall. Harry had inhaled his food, and actually felt a pang of regret that there were no barbs from Draco about his horrible table manners.
And then, as always happened when he looked at her, an overwhelming, mind-numbing guilt. The images of her, dirty and hungry and vulnerable, looking at him without fear or disgust. Her taking the food he offered her (far too little, always too little) with a small smile and a genuine expression of gratitude. The thought made him want to fall to his knees, to beg for her forgiveness. To run far away and never look back.
Kingsley Shacklebolt stood, and the hall fell silent. “After hearing from all witnesses, we have completed our deliberation, and the Wizengamot has decided on the following punishments for the Malfoy family. Draco Malfoy, you will serve two years in Azkaban, where you will be allowed visitors and may communicate with the outside world by owl post. These luxuries have been afforded to you due to your meager efforts on behalf of Harry Potter.” Harry’s breath seized in his chest. “Narcissa Malfoy, you will serve five years in Azkaban. You will also be allowed visitors.” Harry could feel his nails digging into the wooden arms of the chair. How could this be happening? “Lucius Malfoy, you will serve twenty years in Azkaban, and will be afforded one visitor monthly. This concludes the Malfoy family hearing.”
“You have to tell me what you and your friends did to earn such an absurd and unfair number of house points at the end of our first year,” Draco whispered and then immediately yawned.
“I know,” Draco answered quietly, thinking about a dank basement in a cold house, and Luna’s warm, forgiving smile.
He made eye contact with each of them in turn, chest full to bursting with his love for the pair in front of him. “Be safe,” he begged them, and then he was off.
Harry took a step forward. “Draco, of course I trust you. I’m sorry. You’re right.” I’m only worried for you, he almost added. I couldn’t bear it if you were hurt, he thought.
The use of his proper name startled Harry out of his own panic and the wind died abruptly as Harry finally tore his gaze away from the scar to meet Draco’s eyes.
The three started off toward the dungeons. Harry and Luna chatted amicably about the goings on of their friends while Draco stared at the ground in front of them, trying very hard not to think about the types of things that were going to be said when the rest of the school saw him hanging around Harry Potter and Luna Lovegood. They would probably think he had cast the Imperius curse on them. The thought made his stomach clench so violently that his ravenous hunger of moments before disappeared entirely.
Kingsley surveyed the room. “Alright, then, you lot. You’re all set. A ministry official will be by shortly to set the wards and the tracking spells on the wands. You can floo directly to Harry’s home.”
“Good morning, Draco. There’s some fruit on the table there if you’re hungry,” she said, disarmingly kind. He nodded at her warily. They hadn’t spoken since… well, since the Manor.
Harry sat on the couch opposite Draco, starting to doze as he struggled to study. A few minutes later, he had given up all but the feeblest attempts to stay awake. Luna smiled fondly at him, gaze so warm and loving Draco felt as if he were an intruder for witnessing it. Luna went over to Harry, taking the book gently out of his hands and removing his glasses, laying both down on the coffee table. She sat down next to him, curling into his side like a cat, and his arm went around her reflexively, as if they sat together like that every night.
A moment passed in which Draco considered the sheer lunacy of the statement. Draco had been lying next to Harry every night in bed for months, holding his hand and touching him at the slightest opportunity, and Harry had it in his head that Draco wanted
Harry tugged off the invisibility cloak, folded it, and placed it carefully on the base of a crumbled statue. “Malfoy.”
“I think I’ll wait for you out here,” Luna said, leaning against the wall beside the office door. “Somehow, I don’t think Professor Snape will be glad to see me.”
Draco scoffed. “Well that doesn’t surprise me in the least. And of course I’ve finished mine, it’s been done for ages. It’s really quite simple if you’re not a complete dolt.”
Harry turned the page of his book perfunctorily, mind miles away. “You know, “ he said impulsively. “Your magic feels different than I would have thought.”
Draco’s face betrayed him then, shock and disbelief, and maybe a bit of hope, plain on his pointed features. “Why would you do that for me?”
After a moment's hesitation, Harry nodded and turned to Ron and Hermione. “Stay with him,” he whispered. “When he’s ready, find Nagini. Kill it. Use the sword.”
Harry turned to look at him, putting his wandlight out with a wordless spell. “Oh, yeah. It’s been very handy over the years. Don’t know where I’d be without it.” After a brief pause, Draco felt the bed shifting as Harry turned to lay on his side, facing him in the darkness. “Hmm… We’ve known each other for almost eight years, but we know so little about each other. It’s strange isn’t it?”
Ron rolled his eyes. “We can’t have one peaceful year, can we? We finally get the war over and done with, and you’ve invited the entire family of ferrets to be your roomies. I cannot believe this.” Though he sounded glum, he had a hint of amusement in his eyes. Harry elbowed him, grateful, because he knew that no matter what happened, Ron and Hermione would support him.
Snatching the apple unceremoniously out of Harry’s hands, Draco began a thorough inspection of the fruit. “I’ve changed my mind.”
“My magic feels like bubbles, if I had to say.” Luna had approached in the soundless way she so often did, dropping into the seat between Harry and Draco. “I’ve always found it fascinating, the differences between everyone's magic. My father, for example, says his magic is more of a sound that only he can hear, and it reminds him of the call of a female jabbermyte.”
If Draco was surprised, he hid it well. He gave a single curt nod. “The Golden Trio is going off to hunt Horcruxes, I suppose?”
“You’ll be stuck with me for quite a while then, as I think that I'm in love with you, too, Draco Malfoy.” Harry smiled and looked into Draco's grey eyes, and could have sworn he saw his future reflected back at him.
Draco’s smile remained, but it was the indulgent smile of an adult humoring a small child. “Whatever you say, Potter.” After a moment, Draco stretched his legs out in front of him and let his head fall back against the wall. “What did you bring me out here for, anyway? I’m assuming you wanted more than to just blubber all over me.” Without the usual malice, his words came out soft, even a bit teasing. Harry filed it away to think about more thoroughly when he had the time.
Draco didn’t seem to know what to say to that. He gave Harry a long, searching look that left him fidgeting in his seat, and then turned back to his book without a word.
All in all, life was good. They did homework together and studied, played exploding snap and chess, much as he had done with Ron and Hermione when they were there with him. When they were alone, Draco had begun to talk and act like his old self. Soon, it became impossible to deny it: Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were friends.
Harry was grinning, satisfied that he had won. “Well, I got sent to live with my muggle relatives who didn’t much like my parents. Weren’t too keen on me, either. Didn’t know I was a wizard, so I grew up like most muggle kids. Oh, except for the cupboard under the stairs was my bedroom. I imagine most kids have, well, a
Harry shrugged and hugged his knees to his chest. “Well, he was just protecting you, wasn’t he? I think he and Dumbledore both knew Voldemort would be after you if he didn’t do it. Snape, he… He didn’t look like he wanted to do it, did he? He looked upset.”
“No,” Draco said sharply, in a tone that allowed for no debate. He straightened up and looked over his shoulder. “We need to get back to camp. Weasley and Granger need to know what happened.”
Draco came back to himself quickly. “I’m not bad at it.” Luna smiled serenely at him and Harry nodded, as if that settled the matter.
“No!” Ginny and Hermione screamed together. Ron grasped Hermione was one hand and Draco, who was swaying visibly, with the other.
The boys were silent for a long time. Harry picked absently at a loose thread on his ragged jeans, trying his hardest not to cry. He wondered again  what Draco was thinking, but dared not ask. He didn’t know what had possessed him to open up, but the longer the silence went on, the more fervently he wished he could take it back.
Draco didn’t seem to notice. He grabbed Harry’s face in both of his hands, scanning his face for injuries. “Thank you,” he whispered, voice rough from the smoke, and for the second time, drew Harry against him in a bone-crushing embrace. This time, Harry was not too stunned to reciprocate, and his arms locked quickly around Draco’s narrow waist. He burrowed his nose in the crook of Draco’s neck, much as he had the first time, and kissed the racing pulse he felt there.
The idea had occurred to him, of course, that Draco might be in a similar position. Since the Ministry had taken possession of the Manor and his parents were in Azkaban, Harry didn’t know where Draco would go after school either. Perhaps, if neither had a place to go, they could find somewhere together. The thought held much appeal. Draco never brought it up, though, and Harry was too nervous to ask.
Draco let out a harsh bark of laughter before pulling Harry tight against him. “Oh my god, you great moron. You’re absolutely mad. A complete idiot, like I always suspected.” Harry closed his eyes, burrowing his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck, their nearness adding to the dreamlike haze Harry was in.  Draco clutched Harry tightly for another moment before pulling him back and looking him in the eyes. He shoved Harry’s still-wet glasses onto his face.
Narcissa smiled. “Yes, thank you. That sounds lovely.” A door shut down the hall, and Harry turned to find that Draco had already retreated into what would be his room.
Harry glanced sidelong at Narcissa, who was clutching her robes tightly, and Draco, who was staring resolutely at the floor. He shot them what he hoped was a reassuring smile, then turned back to the Minister. “Yes, Kingsley. I’m quite sure.”
“Fine,” Kingsley agreed tiredly. “They may keep their wands for household spells and minor charms. But they will be monitored closely. If they perform so much as a disarming spell, they will be shipped off to Azkaban. Agreed?” Again, a subtle nod from Hermione, and a more assertive one from Harry. “Finally, and this one, Mr. Potter, is non-negotiable: Lucius Malfoy will not be a part of this deal. He has hurt many people, not only in this war, but in the last. He will go to Azkaban for twenty years. There will be no further discussion on his case. Is that clear?”
“Oh, no, Harry, this house has never been ours,” Narcissa answered kindly. “I think you’ve made far better use of it than we would have, anyway.”
Draco was fighting his return to consciousness, but knew it was a fruitless effort when the mediwitch came over to begin poking and prodding him with her wand.
? Draco, you summoned a fully corporeal Patronus today. I haven’t done accidental magic in ages. The bond is through.”
Draco very much resembled a caged animal at that moment, eyes darting about the room, shrinking away from Harry as though he might strike. He looked
Harry was, in fact, feeling quite unwell. His nausea had yet to subside, and his head was beginning to ache. He moved to push his hair out of his face and realized that his hands were trembling. “Just tired, I think.” This was true, though sleep was the furthest thing from his mind. “Listen, can I go check on Malfoy? I just want to make sure he’s okay.”
He turned away before he could change his mind, before he could sink to the floor and hold his people close and refuse to ever let them go. He had nearly made it to the door when he heard a frantic shout of his name.
Kingsley turned his gaze, for the first time, to the Malfoys. “And you, Draco and Narcissa Malfoy? Do you accept these terms? You may, of course, refuse, and serve your original sentences in Azkaban if you’d prefer.”
“Smith!” Draco shouted, the loudest noise he had made in months. The boy finally looked at him. “Pomfrey. Now.” He nodded once, turning and scurrying away.
When Draco awoke, he thought he was still dreaming. As he blinked open his tired eyes, he found green eyes looking back at him, curious and alert and startlingly close. The previous night came back to him in a rush, though he was only half awake when he invited Potter into his bed. And now here he was, the Golden Boy himself, looking entirely unabashed though he had been caught staring at Draco while he slept. The thought made Draco flush as though he were the one who had done something shameful.
Hermione had decided not to return to Hogwarts in favor of accepting a job at the ministry, and Ron had been offered a spot in the Auror Academy without even applying. At first, Ron had been a bit miffed when Harry had told him he would not be joining the Aurors right away, but he had understood once Harry explained that he just wanted one year of his life which would not revolve around dark wizards. One year in which he could go to school, do well in his classes, and live his life as normally as possible.
Snape’s lip curled in distaste as he glanced pointedly at Draco’s hand, which was still on Harry’s am. “If it were up to me, Mr. Potter, you would be locked in the hospital wing, unable to do damage to any more of this school or its inhabitants. Draco has the unfortunate burden of being tied to you, however, so we will be forced to make the best of the situation until it is resolved.” Harry clenched his jaw, and Draco moved his hand down, circling Harry’s wrist and moving his thumb in what he hoped was a soothing manner, stroking the soft skin near Harry’s racing pulse. “You are free to choose whatever tutor you’d like. You will, however, have to accompany Draco to Arithmancy and Runes.”
“A doe…” Draco said quietly. Harry though he might explain, but instead he stood abruptly and stalked over to a flat rock nearby. He took the locket out of his pocket and laid it out on the stone, then leaned down and picked up the sword of Gryffindor. “Harry, get up,” he demanded. “You need to speak Parseltongue to open the locket. When it opens, I’ll destroy it.”
Draco looked up at the sound of his surname and spared a moment to think about how that was the second time Harry had asked him that question in as many days, though he had never once asked in the seven years prior. He nodded quickly, glad to find that they had reached the potions master’s office.
He was being shaken, hard. He forced himself out of his fogginess, looking into the panic-stricken features of Draco Malfoy.
“How novel for you.” Draco didn’t look up, just closed the book in front of him and pulled another closer.
He stood just inside, panting, until his brain caught up to the situation and he registered that Draco, Hermione, and Ron stood before him, all wearing matching looks of disbelief and joy.
Draco knew he must have looked rather stupid, mouth agape as it was, but he couldn’t help it. He wanted to remark on something, but had no idea what he was expected to say. In the end, all he was able to choke out was, “You were
He had to admit, he had been in worse company than Lovegood and Potter. Luna was mad, certainly, but she was also overtly kind and welcoming, which was a marked improvement from his usual interactions. And Harry, well… He had never had much trouble thinking of things to say to Harry, though in the past they were usually barbed insults and thinly veiled threats. This uneasy truce between them was new, but not wholly unpleasant. He could see himself tolerating these people under different circumstances, perhaps even enjoying their company. Maybe they could have even all been friends, in another life. In this life, however, Draco was wrung out. In this life, he was without magic, completely vulnerable in a way he never had been before. In this life he had learned to be silent in order to be safe, and the thought of trying to make friends filled him with such anxiety that he felt a cool sweat form on his brow.
Harry stood slowly, stumbling a bit before McGonagall steadied him. She led him further into the hospital wing, walking directly toward Draco.
Harry wasn’t surprised. After all, Luna was a lovely, kind, and intelligent girl. Harry just sort of wished it had been he who had made Draco smile first.
“Voldemort,” Harry persisted, more loudly, “is going to die. For good this time. And the people who were loyal to him are going to have to be held accountable for their actions. Don’t be one of those people, Draco.”
For want of something to break the heavy silence, Harry turned to Draco, whose gaze was fixed on Harry’s hands clasped within his mother’s. “You can still call me Mr. Potter, Malfoy.”
Luna seemed perfectly unbothered by the new development. She had walked up to Draco after class, practically glowing, and said that his stag was lovely and that she hoped one day her Patronus would find a twin. “It’s quite romantic, isn’t it?” She had asked dreamily, and Harry and Draco had blushed fiercely and stared off in opposite directions.
McGonagall was holding Harry by the elbow. He was a trembling mess, pale and sweaty, hair sticking up in every direction. The very air around him seemed to be crackling with energy. The flames on the candles in the doorway were flaring uncontrollably and the closest bed seemed to be vibrating on the stone floor.
Harry smiled politely. “Yes, sorry about that, Kreacher. I’ve been a bit busy. But listen, we’re going to have company for a while.”
Harry looked to Narcissa, startled. “Oh! That’s right. I forgot to ask, you were Sirius’ cousin, weren’t you?”
The only time he had come close to asking, they had all been eating in the common room, Luna and Draco trying to eat and study at the same time, when Luna looked up from her book quite suddenly.
Harry flushed and averted his gaze for the first time, reaching up to scratch the back of his head awkwardly. “Er… right. Maybe- um. Maybe not so much. Anymore.”
In the space of a breath Voldemort was upon him, and backhanded him hard across the face. Caught by surprise, Harry was knocked off his feet. In his periphery, he saw Draco struggling against Ron’s tight hold on him. He was able to reorient himself just in time to see Voldemort raise his wand.
It took him three tries to put out the lights with a Nox charm. By the end of it, his aching body was absolutely begging him to rest. He laid back, placing the wand reverently in its spot next to his bed, and was asleep within moments.
The dreamy voice of Luna Lovegood finally convinced Draco to return to the waking world and see what was going on. He suppressed a yawn and pushed up onto his elbows, looking over at Harry and Luna.
“What happened?” He rasped. Madame Pomfrey rushed to fetch him a glass of water, which he took gratefully, finishing it in several quick gulps.
Ron shook his head in outrage. “If you die for them I will kill you!” He must have sensed it was pointless to argue, so he turned and continued racing out of the inferno.
Harry sat at breakfast on the fourth morning in which Draco’s seat was conspicuously empty. He poked halfheartedly at his eggs, feeling discomfited. He hadn’t known what to expect, but this continual silence was making him feel very uneasy indeed.
“Thank you,” Narcissa whispered, sitting in the chair beside him and not letting go of his hands. “Words can not express my gratitude to you, Mr. Potter. Truly.”
The first thing Draco felt when he awoke was an extreme fatigue such as he had never known before. He felt as though he had been running for days straight. His limbs were heavy, his head was throbbing, and a strange hollowness filled the pit of his stomach. He groaned in absolute misery.
he said again. This time, his wand lit, and remained lit. Draco grinned at it like it was the most incredible spell he had ever cast.
Harry blinked owlishly for a moment, then laughed loudly, the sound echoing in the empty hospital wing. He grinned at Draco, who cursed his traitorous, racing heart. “You’ve gotten rusty.”
Luna and Draco exchanged a glance, Luna struck up a conversation about the magical properties of soil where troll dung had once been present, and that was that.
Draco hadn’t left, nor had he offered a word or hand in comfort. He had simply scooted a bit closer to Harry and remained silent, doing Harry the great favor of not looking at him. After what felt like an hour but was probably only a few minutes, Harry’s heaving sobs turned into quiet, sniffling crying, and he scrubbed his face with the ragged sleeves of his sweater. He took in a deep breath, counting to ten as he held it, and then blew it out again. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Draco watching him cautiously.
He pulled away just a fraction. “I love you,” he whispered, lips ghosting against Draco’s. When he opened his eyes, Draco’s own were red and fixed intently on him. “I love you so much, so don’t die, okay? Promise me you won’t die.”
‘I know what it is you think you want. Who you think you desire. The one who you will never be worthy of.’
Harry let himself examine the boy he loved one last time. He drank in his features, flushed and furious and stunning. Draco started to cry then, under his intense scrutiny, as the hopelessness of the situation settled around them. Wonder filled Harry, even as his own throat started to close with the strength of his emotions.
thing I have ever done.” Harry’s eyes were blazing. Draco heard, as if from a great distance, the sound of the candelabra on his nightstand clatter to the ground.
“Potter tripped and hit his head.” At this point, Harry opened his mouth to interject, but was cut off by a sharp glance by McGonagall. “Covered the wound with my hands and then…” Draco hesitated. How to explain the consuming heat? The pain in his hands as if his palms had been seared off entirely. The overwhelming dizziness that gave him hardly a moment before there was only blackness.
“I’m sorry that this happened.” Harry looked so sincere that it made Draco’s heart lurch and tears blurred his vision once more. After a moment had passed, Harry asked softly, “Why don’t you talk anymore?”
And then Draco stood, brushed the grass off of him, pulled Harry to his feet, and the spell was broken. They walked back to the castle in silence, hands close but not quite touching.
Harry knelt in front of his dying professor, collecting his tears in a small vial Hermione had procured.
They tumbled together out of the Room of Requirement, joining Ron and Hermione in the hallway. Ron quickly tossed the remains of the diadem into the fiendfyre behind them as Crabbe and Goyle took off without so much as a word of thanks.
Harry took a few steps back and looked at his family. The only family he had ever known. The people he loved above all others. Hermione was sobbing, clutching Ron as he supported her weight. Ron’s usually jovial face was grim, so smeared with dirt Harry could hardly see a freckle. Draco was doing nothing to hide his despair, tears running freely down his colorless cheeks.
“Draco, no, that’s not what I meant.” Harry ran an agitated hand through his hair. “Merlin, why must this be so difficult? “What I meant to say is that
Draco fell quite painfully to his hands and knees moments before Harry was thrown into the statue of Batilda the Bewildered. Draco registered a sickening crack as Harry slumped to the ground, unmoving.
Draco couldn’t have stopped himself if he had tried. Without hesitation, without thought, he reached out and clutched Luna to him, burying his face in her hair. He felt her small hands rest on his sides, and he pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “Very glad,” he said, voice rough.
Ron was holding three brooms up in triumph. He tossed one to Harry and one to Draco before pulling Hermione onto his broom behind him. In moments, the four were airborne, speeding toward the exit.
“Don’t interrupt me, boy,” the professor snapped, black eyes glinting dangerously. “If you would be so kind as to let me finish, I was going to say that a tutor will be assigned to you for the time being, so that you can continue your Herbology training. I understand that you take that class with the Ravenclaw seventh and eighth years, yes?”
McGonagall studied him for another moment before nodding. “Yes, Potter. You may go. And ten points to Gryffindor, for protecting your classmate.”
Draco leapt to his feet, scooping up the sword of Gryffindor as he ran toward Harry. For one wild, terrifying moment, Harry was quite sure Draco was about to run him through with the sword, but of course he didn’t. He brought the sword down hard on the locket to Harry’s right, and as suddenly as the chaos had started, it ended.
When he opened his eyes again, he knew it had not been very long, as the room was still dark and quiet. His head was still cushioned on Luna’s Niffler print pajama-clad legs. He could hear her steady, deep breathing. Though he was deeply content as he hadn’t been in a very long time, his neck was beginning to cramp quite badly and the arm underneath him had gone completely numb.
Harry and Draco hadn’t been alone since the day of the last battle, and Harry was suddenly acutely aware of it. He went to put his hands in his pockets, and instead of his usual wand, he had two. “Oh!” Harry said, pulling Draco’s wand from his pocket. “Here you are, then. I told you I’d keep it safe for you until you could have it back.”
The boys stared back at him, looking quite defeated. Draco had held out a small bit of hope that Snape had called them to him to give them some critical information, or better yet, a potion that would cure them instantly.
“Oh!” Harry had, after all,  completely forgotten. He grinned sheepishly, shifting awkwardly so he could grab the wand  from his back pocket. Their shoulders brushed, and Harry noticed that Draco did not recoil. He held the wand, taking a moment to appreciate what it had done for him, and then presented it to Draco. “This is yours, I think.”
“Are you trying to say,” Draco said slowly, still picking apart bits of Harry’s nonsense rant, “you’re worried Lovegood and I are going to run off into the sunset together and leave you by yourself?”
“Awww, Kingsley,” Harry grinned, and could have sworn he heard Draco suppress a snort of disbelief, which only made him grin wider.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, Malfoy, hope you brought some less fancy clothes. Those don’t look well-suited to cleaning.”
upset that my scar is so much cooler than yours, I would have made sure to remain fully clothed at all times.” Harry’s lips twitched into a suppressed smile. “Now go back to your room. Unlike you, it takes me more than thirty seconds to ready myself for the day.”
Just as it was the night before, the closer to him Draco got, the more tension bled from the rigid set of Harry’s shoulders. He looked up and gave Draco a tired smile. Instinctively, Draco reached out and touched a tentative hand to Harry’s shoulder. Harry seemed to sag in relief.
“Smith,” Draco croaked. Nobody else was in the seldom-used passageway. “Go get Pomfrey.” Smith continued to stare uncomprehendingly at Harry, apparently too shocked to move.
“Good point,” Harry said, scratching his chin as if deep in thought. “If only we had some sort of cloak that rendered one invisible. Or if we were, say, wizards, and had these bits of wood that glow on demand.”
Harry stared, and it was like he was looking at a person he had never met. Harry had seen Draco’s eyes full of fire, hatred, contempt, amusement, and derision over the past seven years. Never once had he seen them full of regret and resignation. Draco looked defeated and vulnerable in a way Harry had never seen, flayed to the bone, exposed.
He put his hand out in front of him instinctively, and the stag moved forward, pressing his wisp-like head into Draco’s hand.
Harry had never seen Draco look so miserable, not even as he had left for the forest. His Adam’s apple bobbed, and he took a step backward. Ron and Hermione closed ranks in front of him, and Harry’s heart swelled.
“The Wizengamot has concluded its deliberation,” he announced. “We will agree to your offer, Mr. Potter, if you and the Malfoys agree to some conditions.”
Harry grinned sheepishly. “Sorry,” he answered, “I wore my invisibility cloak, so nobody would get any funny ideas, what with me sneaking into your room every night.”
Much sooner than he anticipated, it was over. Voldemort was gone in a flurry of ashes, the few die-hard Death Eaters that remained had Disapparated, and Harry had won.
Harry sat back down, hands trembling. Hermione leaned over Ron and whispered to him, “Harry, are you sure you know what you’re getting yourself into?” Harry nodded firmly, trying to convey much more confidence than he felt.
Draco has just drained an entire glass of water, but his mouth still felt bone dry. His tongue felt tacky and too large. He fixed his intense gaze on Snape, finding it far too uncomfortable to look into Harry’s earnest green eyes.
“The sooner we start,” Draco cut in, after having been conspicuously quiet throughout the night, “the sooner we can stop living in filth. Honestly, I’m pretty sure I've got asthma after walking through all the dust in this place.”
Harry had his eyes opened just the smallest, most imperceptible fraction, just enough to make out the small crowd gathering before the Dark Lord. It was all he could do not to let out an audible sigh of relief when he saw Draco, Hermione, Ron, Neville, and Ginny standing at the front of the group. Alive. They were all still alive..
Harry forced himself to walk down the stairs to the Hogwarts entrance for what he now knew would be the last time. Ron, Hermione, and Draco stood together on the stairs, filthy and exhausted, but flushed with their victory over Nagini.
Had he made a terrible mistake? Would he be able to manage two years living with Draco, and five with Narcissa? Would they hold Lucius’ sentence against him? Would his home become a place he dreaded going at the end of each day? Harry had always been impulsive to some degree, but thought that this was probably the most reckless decision he had ever made.
Dinner was a quiet affair that night. Nobody seemed to know quite what to do or say. Kreacher had gone all out for their meal, though, and he popped eagerly in and out with enough food to feed eight.
Harry’s lips quirked up into a small smirk. He opened his mouth to speak, and then, because Draco’s life was a never ending vortex of despair and humiliation, Professor Flitwick scurried up to the pair, applauding and cheering.
Harry snorted and rolled onto his back. “Tell me about it. I never thought I would be at Hogwarts without Ron and Hermione. Never thought I’d miss you shouting insults at me from across the courtyard, either. But here we are.”
These times with Draco were Harry’s favorite: When the room was dark and they lay next to each other in bed, and it was so much easier to talk about the things that mattered. Draco’s father, Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Teddy. The year Harry spent looking for Horcruxes. The year Draco spent living with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry would look at Draco’s blurred, soft outline, and his heart would swell with affection.
If Harry thought that he and Luna received far too much attention before, it absolutely paled in comparison to what occurred in the halls now. Before, at its worst, he received requests for autographs and some pointed stares or concealed giggles. The occasional love letter or three. When they had ventured out yesterday for food, Harry saw each and every student they passed send worried and outright hostile looks in Draco’s direction. Conversations died as they walked by, followed by furious whispers. He had been slipped a note that said simply ‘
Snape and McGonagall exchanged a quick glance. A tight frown on her face, McGonagall answered, “Unfortunately, Draco, we simply have no idea. As professor Snape has mentioned, wizardkind’s understanding of life debts and the bonds they create between wizards is limited. We will, of course, do everything in our power to return you both to your normal states. It seems for now, however, only time will tell.”
Quite suddenly, the door opened and there were Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, followed by Kingsley Shacklebolt. The Malfoys had been freed of their bindings and they filtered into the room, quiet and solemn. Narcissa’s eyes were red-rimmed and bloodshot, but she looked no less poised than ever. Draco, on the other hand, looked as if someone had drained all of the blood from his body. Even his lips were pale, his eyes dull and downcast.
Harry looked at him thoughtfully for a moment. “Yes, I suppose she is,” he agreed once he realized Draco hadn’t been making fun of his friend. “But she’s kind and funny, and really quite smart, too.”
“Tom!” Harry shouted once he had left his friends a safe distance behind him. Voldemort stopped mid-step. “Let’s finish this the way we started. You and me.”
Narcissa gasped and turned to chastise her son, but Harry threw his head back and laughed. “I’m so sorry, Malfoy, I forgot to consider your delicate disposition when I offered you a place to live.”
Draco sighed heavily. “I don’t know. I suppose not.” He chewed his lower lip. “I just don’t know what you want from me. All of your friends and adoring fans are inside.”
Draco stared at Harry for a moment, caught off guard. Harry must have been speaking of Luna, but his eyes remained fixed on Draco. Draco felt as though he were being tested, but for what, he wasn’t sure. His gaze flickered to Luna, whose plaited hair glowed golden in the firelight. Her flawless skin, her delicate features that belied the fierceness of the girl within. Draco felt a surge of protectiveness and affection wash over him.
“Right, then,” said the Auror, “that’s done. We’ll just be out front for a bit setting up the wards, but we shouldn’t need to disturb you again.” He nodded and turned without waiting for a word, hurrying his partner along beside him as he left.
After that, the boys suffered through an agonizingly long day. Gossip had once again spread through the halls of Hogwarts far faster than any fiendfyre, and by the end of the day, it seemed that everyone knew about the twin Patronuses. It brought Draco back to the first day the bond had formed, when whispers and rumors followed their every step.
Harry turned on his side and out to lightly touch Draco’s chest, where he now knew there would forever be a scar. “Yeah. Me too.”  In that moment, Harry thought he might do it. It might even be easy. There were only a few inches between their faces, and they could be bridged so quickly. Harry could tell Draco how he felt, and tell him that he might very well fall apart if they were separated at the end of the year. He could picture it so clearly he could almost taste the sweetness of Draco’s lips.
Harry signed, flexed his overworked hand, and passed the paper and quill to Kingsley. The man set his hard gaze on Harry. “Once we do this, Harry, there is no backing out. This is a magically binding contract. Now that you’ve had some time to think, are you still absolutely certain you’re prepared to take on this responsibility?”
As the days and then weeks went on, Harry found himself surprised at how quickly and easily Draco had fit himself into his and Luna’s daily lives. People were becoming used to seeing the three of them together, and though there were still some pointed glares, at least there was no longer a strained silence in any room they entered. They continued to take their meals in the common room, as they all agreed that it was more enjoyable than dealing with everyone in the Great Hall. The house elves were more than accommodating, and had begun to bring them their favorites without needing to be asked.
Harry entered the room, squinting to make out Draco’s outline, still in bed. The room was set up very similarly to his own, with Draco’s bed pressed against the far wall. This, Harry reasoned, was probably the reason the distance between them was so uncomfortable.
Meekly, Harry returned the shrug. “I didn’t know until today. But yeah, er… Would you mind not telling her?”
. Like the promise of water given to a man in the desert, Harry had managed to keep him persevering for so long now. He wasn’t ready to say goodbye to that just yet.
“Of course not,” Harry said. “I’m just trying to think of girls who would understand and in the case of Luna, wouldn’t drive you mad within the first hour. Shame about the cousin thing, really.”
Harry nodded at her with a grateful smile before turning back to look at Draco, seeing the blonde looking warily at the proffered cracker.
The shrill shout came from the other side of the room and Harry took an abrupt step back from Malfoy, turning to give Teddy a sheepish grin.
He’d already run the scenarios through his mind; Hermione would panic before immediately doing all the research she could, Ministry work be damned, while Ron would grimace and remind them both halfheartedly that “You-Know-Who can’t really be alive… Can he?”
She placed a hand over his gently as she nodded. “I know. I wouldn’t suggest it if I wasn’t worried about you, you know.”
“Seeing as you only send them once every other month quoting very obscure hours of availability, I can hardly be held responsible for that.” The way Malfoy managed to sound so refined, so put together even as he begun to look slightly dishevelled was infuriating. Harry also couldn’t help but notice that Malfoy’s hair looked
“Are you—Honestly, Harry. You leave your fiancée for work, for months at a time, and think you’re doing her a favour? I thought you were marrying for love.”
Her voice was kind as she spoke this time, less authoritative. “It doesn’t take a trained Legilimens to have a good idea of who might be plaguing your thoughts, Harry. I don’t think this is something of too much concern, though I’m sure it feels like it at this point.” Healer Benson adjusted the web of colours above him slightly before meeting his eyes. “You’ve been taking a lot of Wideye and putting pressure on your body that isn’t natural, which is enough to cause some disruption in your mind. Hallucinations aren’t overly common this soon, but they’re also not unheard of. A few days off the stimulants and good rest will put an end to it, I’m almost certain.”
By the time his dinner had arrived, the pain had faded once more. Confused but glad for the relief, Harry pushed any lingering questions in his mind aside and accepted his plastic bag full of delicacies from the harried delivery driver before retreating inside once again.
“—and they’d have you on the front page in front of one of those rainbow flags. Wait, that’s a brilliant idea!”
Taking every ounce of courage not to cower at the obvious disappointment behind her reprimand, Harry schooled his features into a wide smile as he nodded. “Right, no more Wideye. I can do that. Is that all?”
at the thought of setting foot in the bright, clinical building but seeing the desperation in Hermione’s eyes, he paused. Thinking it over as he took a long sip from his Butterbeer, Harry had to acknowledge that without his daily vice he wouldn’t last much longer without sleeping.
“Butter chicken medium, palak paneer mild, two garlic naan and samosas. Did you want anything else?”
Walking closer to where he sat, she dissolved the shimmering protection spell with an absent wave of her wand. Harry gulped as she then pointed the wand in his direction, flinching slightly before watching an intricate pulsing web of coloured threads appear above his body. It was mesmerising, something he thought he could stare at forever; if it weren’t for Hermione’s gasp in the corner Harry might have completely forgotten the reasons for its existence
and Harry was finally sitting across from Ron at the Burrow, filling him in on the visit over some Butterbeers.
Letting out a nervous chuckle, Ron gave him a thumbs up. “Blimey, Harry. You don’t really think I’d be daft enough to worry her on purpose?”
That didn’t mean he wanted to sleep. The magical flare up earlier had him worried that perhaps another nightmare would be enough to break through the silencing charm and the last thing he needed tonight was another trip to St Mungo’s. The only upside he could see to an overnight stay was that they’d surely get frustrated with his screaming after a while and let him have some Dreamless Sleep, right? It was a low selling point in comparison to having to speak about the hallucinations and his ever-growing loss of control.
“Harry.” Ginny clicked her fingers in front of his face, incredulous stare on her face. “Do I have to march you out of the house myself?”
Harry had barely made it through the door when he was pulled aside roughly and all but slammed into the nearest wall.
And with that she started her walk back to the house, fingers gently brushing against his right arm as she passed him. He dropped his head back, looking to the sky as if hoping it would have all the answers he was seeking right now, but knowing that he wasn’t going to find them up there.
Leaning back slightly to brush a hand through his hair again, Harry threw Draco that slightly crooked grin and he knew then, with more certainty than ever before, that he was hopelessly and irreversibly lost on Harry Potter.
It was far from the first time they had seen each other since last Christmas at in Edington. They had first seen each other a few times in passing at the Ministry, though Draco was still infuriatingly silent on
He could hear the truth in her words, made all the more powerful by how fervently she believed them. “So… You think I should quit my job.”
“Almost,” Harry admitted with another sigh. “And then he, I don’t know, panicked? He just ran off without a word.”
He dropped his gaze to look at where he was poking the carpet with his trainer, unable to take the loving frustration directed at him.
“Oh.” Harry was more confused than ever, unsure what this meant about last Christmas. “How would that even work?”
“Thanks, Harry. Ginny warned me off inviting the nargles in this year so there’s no mistletoe, I’m afraid.”
“I don’t think you’re getting rid of him,” Harry said with a grin. “Better just name him and be done with it.”
Trying in vain to keep his teeth from chattering, he kept the covers up below his chin and tried to move his toes just to check that they were still receiving blood flow. Then he worked his way up slowly, into his feet, through his legs, up to his stomach and into his chest. He imagined that as he felt the blood pumping to keep him alive, it was warming him. This wasn’t entirely new for him, he was just adapting the process he had used for the last two years to keep himself from shooting an Unforgivable in his own direction. Instead of warmth, it had been safety. It had been a calm, secluded place he could be alone inside of his body when his mind became too much.
Harry swallowed nervously as he thought about the Horcrux and debated telling her for a moment. It would be such a weight off his chest. He thought about his worries, fears, the deepest thoughts he didn’t even want to share with Ron and Hermione. What if there was still an attachment to Voldemort? Though Harry and so many others had seen him meet his end, majority of his nightmares featured glimpses of the torture and horrors he’d subjected others to throughout the war. Moments Harry couldn’t be sure he had witnessed prior to the dreams that kept his staving off sleep as long as possible.
He was the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, and though he doubted the Prophet would ever let anyone forget who he was, he didn’t know how to move forward from here. He hadn’t the faintest idea what he actually wanted to do now that he had the choice. He wasn’t sure how much choice he really had, not having completed any of his seventh schooling year, but the fact was that now he had all the time in the world, and no clue how to spend it. He felt lost. Hopeless, if he was being honest with himself.
There wasn’t much left to get today, a small mercy for which he was thankful. He’d managed to pick up most of the presents ahead of time for once—entirely accidental on his part—in some of the wizarding stores Hermione had shown him in Bristol last weekend. Today's mission was simple: Ginny had mentioned some of the new flying gear stocked by Quality Quidditch Supplies and he was considering stopping in at Eeylops while he was here to see how much work a kneazle would be. James had met the neighbour’s cat and fallen in love at first sight.
She blinked quickly a few times and Harry could see that her eyes were starting to glisten. “Alright. Well, I’ve done my waiting Harry. I can’t do this anymore. You’re so different than you were and I don’t know if you’re going to get through this and be someone that I don’t recognise at all. You might never want me, and I can’t wait around to find out.”
Dropping her voice, Hermione glared across the table at him. “You’d better be joking, Harry. Dreamless Sleep is like Wideye on steroids. Or technically the opposite, I suppose.” At his confused expression, she sighed. “See, you don’t know anywhere near enough about these things to just be taking them as you please!”
Sighing, Harry resolved not to start this particular breed of argument again today. “Shall we?” He said, indicating to the stairwell just past them. “We’ll be late if we don’t leave soon.”
“Not like that, you idiot.” There was a moment’s pause, during which Harry refused to look back at what Draco was doing for fear of what he might see.
“Nothing serious?” She asked, settling into her chair and picking up the mug she’d left on the table between them. “You’ve pined after that man for how many years and sit here trying to tell me it’s not serious?”
That’s probably why he felt blindsided by her intuitive perception as he relaxed in front of the fire, sipping on mulled wine while waiting for Hermione’s return from the bathroom.
She raised an eyebrow but chose to humour him. “Fine. Next time though, we’re getting you checked out at St Mungo’s again.”
Taking another quick glance at the battered watch on his wrist, Harry sighed and cursed whoever was listening that he’d crossed paths with Malfoy today and even worse, that he was going to defend the blasted prat. Stepping through the doorway he caught sight of the raised voice immediately: a large man with a face that reminded Harry of Vernon Dursley and a bald patch the size of one of the rats in the glass casing next to him. He was red in the face to match what hair he had left and more importantly, had his wand raised in the face of the pointy git standing opposite him.
Mirroring her, Harry glanced around to see many watchful eyes quickly turn away from them, clearly eavesdropping. He sighed, wishing that the public would take less interest in his life.
“I just… I don’t really see how they’ll be able to help.” Shrugging, Harry withdrew his hand and downed the last of his Butterbeer. “Unless they’ve got some magic that’ll get rid of the… y’know.”
Even now, laying in his bed at Grimmauld Place staring at the grubby ceiling above him his mind was racing a millions miles an hour. His entire body ached right to the core, with no logical explanation other than pure emotional exhaustion and many sleepless nights. Harry wasn’t entirely sure what he had expected after the war was over; truthfully, he’d never had the chance to think about its possibility. He definitely hadn’t spared a thought to think about all of the public appearances he’d be invited to make. No, if he’d ever actually taken a spare second to fantasise about a world without Voldemort, it seemed a lot more peaceful than the one he was now living in.
The silence around them seemed deafening as Draco refused to look up from where his fingers were tugging at the end of his emerald green scarf. Curse his feelings for encouraging him to talk. What they’d had before now was good. It wasn’t enough for Draco—he wasn’t sure if there would ever be enough of Harry for him, honestly—but it was bearable, and manageable, and Merlin’s beard it was
Grumbling, John snatched his arm away from Harry. “Can’t believe you’re defending him. I thought you were on our side, boy.”
Harry stayed silent, unsure of where he was going with this train of thought. He watched Draco’s brow furrow as one hand pulled at the end of his scarf, the only tells that he was still slightly hesitant to share what was on his mind.
His initial thought had been one of panic, followed by confusion: could wizards even get heart attacks? Harry was yet to hear about someone dying from anything other than old age or magical reasons. He supposed he could ask Hermione but he didn’t want to worry her and she would no doubt send him back to St Mungos if heart attacks were a viable cause of death in the magical world.
Clearing his throat Harry looked back to Ron quickly, seeing him raise an eyebrow and tilt his chin towards the doorway she occupied.
Harry shook his head, looking at Andromeda and Teddy ahead of them before turning his gaze back to Draco. “A lot has changed. Besides, not all of us can stay married when we’d rather be with someone else.”
“We haven’t really talked about it, honestly. Sometimes I see her looking at me though, like she knows. Like she feels the same way even. Is that horrible?”
“My point exactly.” With a sigh, Draco mirrored Harry and took his mug of black coffee into his hands. “Don’t worry about it.”
At that exact moment, Hannah Abbott cried out in triumph as a silvery cat emerged from her wand. It bounded around the room for a moment, passing between Draco and Harry in what seemed to Draco a very deliberate act of malevolence, and then disappeared in a wisp of silver smoke. Harry looked back at Draco, blinking owlishly.
It had been a long year for Draco, though it was not yet half over. Really, it had been a long several years, but somehow this was shaping up to be the worst, despite the constant threat of war no longer looming over his head.
Harry stepped closer to Draco, who took a step backwards automatically. “Draco, please. I need to know. Do you… do you have feelings for me?”
Draco stood slowly, needing desperately to use the loo and freshen up. He started off, allowing himself to stretch leisurely as soon as he was out of sight of the others.
As soon as they stepped into Draco’s room (Harry now kept clothes in Draco’s room, all pretense gone) Draco turned to Harry with his hands on his hips. “Alright, let's get this out of the way,” he said with the air of someone who was about to ask for help moving a couch. “My patronus was a stag. A bizarre coincidence. Let’s not make a big deal out of this, right?”
Harry’s jaw snapped shut with an audible click and he stared off, embarrassed, into a corner of the room.
Harry balked and pulled the apple back out of his pocket. “You said Malfoys were above fruit bribery.”
An hour later, the boys lay side by side on the Quidditch pitch, lit only by the stars and the dim lumos of their wands, trying to catch their breath.
Then again, something about the thought of the proud, quick-witted, snarky Draco Malfoy wasting away in Azkaban for two years made his stomach lurch. No, he wouldn’t have been able to live with himself had he not stopped it.
!” Pomfrey cried, fixing Smith’s nose with a flick of her wand. “Now, if everyone could please stop injuring themselves long enough for me to assess Mr. Malfoy. Smith, I thought you told me it was Potter who was hurt.”
A throaty chuckle reverberated through Harry. “I should be asking you that,” Draco answered. “You’re far too good for me, and you surely deserve much better.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but froze when Draco pressed a finger gently to his lips. “However, I’m just selfish enough not to refuse this. I’m sure that I’ll want to be with you for as long as you’ll have me.”
Draco poked at his food, enthusiasm suddenly evaporated. “I used to think I’d like to be a Potions master, like Professor Snape, but recently… I’ve been thinking that I might like to be a Healer.” he had looked up at Luna and Harry self-consciously. Neither spoke, and he looked down once more. “It’s ridiculous of course. Nobody would want a Death Eater to be their healer.”
“Because,” Harry answered. “We’re only sixteen. I quite think one war is enough to be fighting, don’t you?”
“Hmm, yes,” agreed Luna. She unfurled from her place beside Draco on the sofa after patting him softly on the hand. He spared her only a glance before staring off in the direction of his bedroom. Luna padded over and stooped down to kiss Harry on the cheek, then went off to her room, bidding them goodnight as she went.
Lucius Malfoy took a shaky step toward the gathered students. “Draco,” he hissed. “You foolish, reckless boy. Repent for your actions these past years, and come here.”
It took him a moment to realize that Harry was awake and watching him. In the first months of school, he had grown so accustomed to this watchful gaze that he hardly acknowledged it, but now it seared him.
A thousand retorts were on the tip of Harry’s tongue regarding Lucius Malfoy, but he bit them back. “Will you be okay here on your own, then?” he asked instead.
Draco’s face was bright with unsuppressed glee, an expression so vastly different from what it had been moments earlier. “Harry, how absolutely
He figured he had only been unconscious for a minute or two, but Harry knew something incredibly strange had happened, as he had woken up with Draco Malfoy splayed across his chest, and a cool, tingling sensation thrumming through his veins. He had just heaved Draco’s body off of his own when Madame Pomfrey and a terrified looking Zacharias Smith sped down the corridor.
Draco stared at him for a moment and scooted over in bed automatically. He watched as Harry climbed into his bed, feeling comfortable enough to tug a bit of blanket off of Draco and onto himself. Draco took a moment to appreciate the ease and familiarity of the gesture. The intimacy of it.
Harry ate most of his meals in the Astronomy tower in the coming weeks. If Malfoy showed up with his own meals more often than not, it was just an unhappy coincidence.
“There’s always… there’s always room for one more, if you wanted to come. With me. Us.” He held his breath.
Draco took several slow, deep breaths. The reflex to stay silent, stay unnoticed, stay safe, was so thoroughly ingrained in him that to open his mouth amongst so many people to tell his story seemed unthinkable. He could feel a thin sheen of sweat forming on his brow, and the strange hollow in his gut gave a lurch. He stared directly at Snape, who was still waiting very patiently.
The elf appeared instantaneously in front of him with a small pop. “Master Harry is being home,” he said, golf ball eyes wide and focused. “It has been quite a while since the Master has come home.”
“Malfoy, are you okay?” Draco could hear the nerves in Harry’s voice, but couldn’t bring himself to care. What an absolutely horrid question. Obviously, Draco was not okay. He was practically a squib. He was exhausted, his head was aching, and he was sick of so much interaction after six months of virtual solitude.
As if he could read Draco’s mind, Harry heaved in another great breath and then let it out slowly and turned to look at Draco. “It’s okay. You’re right. It’s upsetting to think of him living like I did as a child. But hey, at least I didn’t explode anything this time. And that barely took any time to pass at all. We’re definitely getting better.”
A long moment passed, and when Harry’s breathing finally evened out, Draco released his hold on him. “There we are,” he said, “no need to destroy my room with your dramatics.”
Draco’s grin spread and he said, without a hint of sarcasm, “I truly cannot wait to read your articles, Lovegood.” Luna beamed at him, then they looked at Harry.
“What’s wrong with your food?” Harry had asked at one point. “I know you like steak and kidney pie.” He actually froze with his fork halfway to his mouth when he had said that, realizing far too late how bizarre it sounded. How would he know Draco liked steak and kidney pie, if not for the way he had stared at him across the Great Hall, watching for seven whole years? Draco merely raised an elegant eyebrow in his direction before returning to the apparently all-consuming task of moving bits of food around his plate.
Draco glanced briefly up at him with an arched eyebrow before returning back to his book. “How sad for you,” he said, sounding not sad in the least.
“Obviously. You really think I couldn’t come up with a more offensive nickname for you than Scarhead?”
Draco clenched his jaw shut as his instinct was to snap that if nobody had ever figured this out before then it was unlikely that two eighteen year olds with a couple of library books would be able to do so. After another silent moment, Harry sighed and Draco heard him retreat. Finally, finally, he was able to let the tension leave his body. Despite his mind being a whirlwind of uncertainty and dread, the powerful fatigue in his bones took over, and he was nearing sleep within minutes.
An awkward silence reigned, broken only by the halfhearted attempts at the Patronus charm made by nosy classmates. Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Look, you’re the savior of the entire wizarding world, probably half the class will have stag patronuses.”
Harry hesitated and then nodded, understanding that this was just one more thing that would remain unspoken between them.
Rage and disgust pierced through Harry as he spotted Smith. What kind of coward tries to cast when their opponent’s back was turned? He had no more than glanced at him when Smith suddenly stiffened and fell over, crashing to the cold stone passageway. Harry blinked in surprise and Smith sprang back up, whimpering and pinching his bleeding nose. It had been years since Harry had lost control of his magic like he had just done.
At once, Harry sighed deeply and the air around him lost its charged quality. Draco’s fingers tightened reflexively on Harry’s arm and his breath caught in his throat as he realized- physical touch helped to calm Harry. Not just any touch,
After a moment’s hesitation, Draco stretched his wand arm in front of him and cast a quick levitating charm on a dusty book from the pile in the corner of the room. The book flew up at once, and he grinned as he had it zoom about the room. Harry smiled and clapped quietly as Draco had the book do a poor facsimile of a bow.
Harry was immensely grateful for Hermione’s presence when, half an hour later, the assistant came in toting a massive stack of paperwork, all of which had to be signed before he could “take the Malfoys into his custody,” as she had put it. Harry rather thought that made it sound as though he were adopting them, and not just giving them a place to stay.
used to reside. Snape had told him to practice though, and here, safe and alone in his bed, was the best place to try it.
Harry took in the other boy’s red-rimmed eyes, his pale, drawn face, his trembling fingers, and realized that this absolutely was not what he wanted. Not even close. He stepped forward, moving slowly, as one might approach a wild animal.
“Not on your life,” Draco answered with a smirk, and the expression was so familiar that Harry found himself smiling with pleasure.
“I heard you had a cloak like that,” Draco said quietly, instead of giving voice to any of his traitorous thoughts, “but I was never sure.” He lay back and tugged the blanket back toward himself, more to annoy Harry than because he really needed it.
Draco shrugged, then realized Harry wouldn’t be able to see it in the dark of the room. “I suppose,” he conceded. “Though there are plenty of people I’ve known that I don’t really
Draco opened his mouth to respond, then caught the sight of three other openly curious faces in his periphery. His jaw shut with a click and he nodded.
As he settled into bed that night, the uncomfortable tug in his stomach remained, bearable enough where he didn’t feel the urge to break into Malfoy’s room, but uncomfortable enough that, despite how tired he felt, it prevented him from an easy slumber.
Harry could see no choice now. He leapt from Hagrid’s arms, effectively ending his ruse. “Confringo!” he cried, aiming his wand at the nearest Death Eater. It was deflected with little effort, but it gave him the distraction he needed to dive over and hide behind a low wall. He heard the gasps and shouts from both sides, the cries of relief from his friends. He sprinted to the castle, still hunched over, as Voldemort attacked the walls covering him.
The Malfoys were whisked away soon after that, and Harry headed home to prepare for their arrival. He had told Ron and Hermione to head home, sure it would be easier for the Malfoys to acclimate without their presence. After Hermione had extracted several promises from him to “behave himself” around Malfoy, they had flooed home, and Harry headed to Grimmauld Place.
“Harry, can you tell us what happened?” McGonagall looked worried, and Draco thought perhaps a bit alarmed.
“Besides,” Harry pressed on, “you don’t really want to start tomorrow, do you? There’s not any rush. You could take some time to get settled, if you’d like.”
Luna shifted against Harry then, evidently awake, and they both looked down at her. She blinked sleepily in Draco’s direction, pushing against Harry’s chest to sit herself up, a dreamy smile already in place. “You remind me, Draco,” she said, voice unusually low and quiet, “that there is goodness and light even in the darkest of places.” She looked more alert now, smiling at him in earnest. “I am very glad that we’re friends. Aren’t you?”
Harry furrowed his brow as his heart dropped to his stomach. “Do you really think that’s all it was? Just a coincidence?”
Draco eyed the apple with disdain. “It takes quite a bit more than a piece of fruit to bribe a Malfoy.” He glanced surreptitiously over to the Slytherin table, where his so-called friends were pointedly not making eye contact. His shoulders slumped a bit. “I do have a History of Magic assignment I’ve been meaning to work on, though. I suppose I can come with you. Just this once.”
“Right. Well then,” the professor took a seat behind her desk and gestured for the boys to take the seats opposite her. “Tell me exactly what happened.”
Draco knew only one person capable of such eloquence, and he forced himself to look up into the disbelieving face of Harry Potter. He forced one eyebrow to lift defiantly, forced himself to meet Potter’s gaze head-on. Forced himself not to melt into a Draco-shaped puddle of embarrassment on the floor.
Hermione's arm shot out to block Draco. “No,” she growled, and Harry had never heard her sound so fierce.
Draco pulled him violently aside, shouted “Protego!” and dove beside Harry as the books were deflected.
“Harry, look out!” Hermione screamed, and Harry turned just in time to see a tower of books, quickly becoming engulfed in flames, collapsing toward him.
Harry hadn’t been following Draco the day that Zacharias Smith tried to hex Draco when his back had been turned. Well, not exactly, anyway. Is it really considered ‘following someone’ if you were simply heading to the same class as them? And if they took the long way ‘round, and you decided you also felt like a bit of a walk, well, that was fine, wasn’t it? In any case, it had been lucky, since Zacharias had chosen that day to be the world’s biggest prat. It was pure instinct that drove Harry when he tackled Draco out of the way, a surge of protectiveness that compelled him to take the jinx himself. It had been what Hermione would have called his ‘
It was another morning in the astronomy tower. Harry and Draco sat in silence, looking out over the grounds as they had countless times in the past year. This time, everything was different.
“Stupid girls,” Voldemort hissed. “He is dead. From this day forth, you shall put your faith in me.” The Death Eaters behind him cackled and cheered. “Step forward. Join us.”
The abrupt topic change took Draco by such surprise that the tears receded as quickly as they had come. “I talk,” he answered.
Harry wrapped a hand behind Draco’s neck, pulling him toward himself, and their lips met for what would be the first and last time. There was no hesitation as Draco melted into him immediately, clutching the front of his jacket. Harry’s arms snaked around Draco’s waist, pulling him as close as their bodies would allow. Harry permitted himself to linger for only a moment, memorizing the taste and feel of the soft, pliant lips beneath his own.
Narcissa beamed at him, as if he had just bestowed upon her a gift, and she lifted his hand to her face and kissed it once more. “Well then, Harry, I insist you call me Narcissa.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall started, forcing Draco to peer at her without moving, “What you have done is incredibly courageous. You sacrificed a great deal to ensure that your fellow student survived, and for that, I will be awarding Slytherin fifty house points.”
After a few silent moments in which Harry was fully prepared to be hexed, a slow grin transformed Draco’s face. “Harry Potter. Have you been using the bond that you knew was done with as an excuse to sleep in bed with me every night?”
“Great. It’s been at least a month since your last Malfoy rant,” she teased as she pressed past him and made her way down the corridor. “Mind making me some tea and coming to chat in bed? My back’s killing me.”
Harry shrugged, unsure of how he felt on the matter. “Honestly, I’m not fussed either way. I’ve never had a pet that wasn’t an owl.”
Looking between Harry and the cashier for a long moment, Draco sighed before turning to face the counter again. “One black coffee, and whatever ridiculous Christmas cocoa drink special you’ve got for this idiot.”
Wanting nothing more than to sink into the mattress beneath him and disappear, Harry let out a loud sigh and spelled a quick
Harry patted her head reassuringly, trying not to laugh as her voice raised with every passing word. “I know, ‘Mione. It’s why you do so well at work.”
Kreacher stood straighter, if such a thing were even possible. “Master is ill! Master must be going to St Mungos now!”
Withdrawing from the kiss, Harry sighed. “I need more than just I miss you, Draco. I need to know that the next time something doesn’t go your way, you’re not going to walk away and then never speak to me again.” Watching Draco’s discomfort as he reclined against the desk once more, Harry shook his head. “I won’t wait around for you again.”
Did he owe this crisis of moral conscience to the Dark Lord? If the fear hadn’t followed him around his own home for so long, would he have ever questioned his allegiance and what they were all fighting for? Considering the amount of time and energy he devoted to hiding his thoughts from someone he had followed so easily at one time, had he been questioning the plans all along? Had he ever truly stood for anything? Or had his father and in turn the Dark Lord just scared the shit out of him?
The silence that followed was even worse than if she’d been shouting, because it meant that Hermione was mad. Really, really mad.
“You really think that?” Ginny snorted, smacking the back of Harry’s head and causing him to groan. “Are you sure you’re not just projecting your childhood animosity onto what is genuine flirting, Harry?”
Harry swallowed nervously, words of decades ago ringing in his ears and glass smashing in his minds eye. "Yeah. Yeah, I have."
Turning his head to catch Draco’s wistful look in his direction, Harry gave him a gentle smile. “What if it doesn’t have to?”
“Right, well, good afternoon then?” Cursing as his greeting came out as a question, Harry watched Hermione’s jaw tense.
“So you’re not shipping me off to therapy?” Harry let out a breath he hadn’t even realised he’d been holding, feeling infinitely lighter than he had since he’d first laid eyes on
“I thought you said it wasn’t a big deal?” Confused, Harry looked to his friends to see if they were making more sense of this than he was.
Sitting up straighter, Harry’s eyes came alight as he looked towards Draco. “No pain here. No Latin here. Out here it’s just… Us. Us being friends, if you want?”
“Was that charm for the store’s protection, or their own?” Draco asked as he followed Harry’s lead and took a seat atop the brick. “Because it seemed too well rehearsed to be the first time you’ve had to do that.”
He dropped it, knowing this was her way of coping. Turning back to the Auror’s manual he’d been trying to focus on for the better part of the past hour, Harry conceded defeat and summoned his latest case notes from the bedside table in their spare room. Opening the lavender coloured folder, Harry held back a sigh as he began reading the now familiar medical notes of the three most recent victims.
“Master Harry was calling for Kreacher?” The elf said as he bowed low, Regulus’ locket just about touching the floor with the movement. Straightening up, he fixed a stern look in Harry’s direction as he took in the scene in front of him.
Thinking on just how much had changed for him since that fateful night at the kitchen table two years ago, Harry gave her an echoing smile of his own. “No, I don’t.”
“Very interesting.” Letting the thread resume its entanglement, Healer Benson looked to him expectantly. “Can you tell me what you think the problem might be, Harry?”
“Mm. From what I observed, you saw something in this room that scared you. Do you think the surge in your magic had anything to do with the hallucination?”
Stepping out into the crisp night air, Harry squinted as his eyes tried to adjust to the outside world. The cloud cover coupled with one too many drinks had Harry feeling a bit hazy as he stumbled and he blamed the lack of vision for how high he jumped when a voice spoke out of the darkness to his right.
"Haven't you had enough of prophecies for one lifetime? Of doing things because some stupid magical object said that's what would happen?"
She smiled sadly and her shoulders slumped. “I know. But it’s not every day you testify to save someone’s life for the second time.”
Astoria laughed, shaking her head slowly as she looked between the two men. “I’m not entirely sure I’d call them unimaginable anymore.”
Harry laughed beside him—he was Harry now, of course he was, though Draco would never say it aloud—as he reclined in the seat and turned to look at the players flying around the pitch, getting in their last flight before the Easter holidays. “Nothing that horrible happened here, did it? Aside from the Dementors, I guess.” Sneaking a sideways look at Draco, Harry elbowed his ribs. “Which I think I have you to blame for.”
Harry mindlessly ran a hand through his hair, nodding behind Hermione to indicate Ron’s imminent return. Trying not to fixate too closely on Hermione’s previous words, he instead took a long drink from the Butterbeer he’d been handed as he half-listened to Ron recount the trials of the day that Harry had thankfully been able to skip.
She raised her eyebrows but simply returned the nod, Ron beside her looking back and forth between them like they were a particular interesting Quidditch match. He couldn’t blame him; if their roles were reversed he’d be equally as confused and curious. Harry just wasn’t about to admit to either of them that he’d apparently started hallucinating.
“I am not a workaholic!” He snapped, shaking his head as he reached for the glass in front of him. “And I’ve sent you perfectly reasonable times. You were unavailable
“State your full name,” Shacklebolt said, barely heard over the loud gasps and mutters that had broken out around the chambers.
“Just… Forget any of that ever happened, alright? I suppose I can owl you or something. How’s that?”
“Well I obviously wasn’t about to apparate with her, was I?” Shooting Harry a look that heavily implied he thought Harry was an idiot, Malfoy shook his head. “It’s her own fault for refusing not to fly further than a mile at a time.”
“Listen to me,” Healer Benson began, speaking gently still as she perched on the end of his bed. “It’s a very rare occurrence that magic will just flare up when triggered by nightmares at your age. We don’t usually see this beyond age fifteen and no, I’m not comparing you to a child when I say that.” She shot him a look as if she could hear the defiant response in his mind at her comment, before continuing. “My best guess at this point is that either you’re more deeply effected by whatever you’re keeping from me… Or there’s dark magic at play. We’ve run all the diagnostics that could apply, considering that you haven’t fallen victim to any curses that anyone is aware of. Sometimes we miss things. I would rather not let you leave until we get further into this, but you don’t want that and with nothing visibly wrong outside of your stimulant use I’ve got little authority to keep you.”
“Sure thing. Thanks, Healer Benson.” Harry stood and made to leave, being stopped by a gentle arm across his chest as he reached the door.
The cell was damp and musty, unsurprising when Draco considered that the island was shrouded in perpetual rain. But for one corner where there appeared to be a crack in the ceiling, there was no light from above and the small amount of light coming in from between the cell bars was just enough to see how dusty they were. The floor was cold beneath his thin prison-issued socks and felt uneven but worn down, no doubt by the pacing of occupants before him. Though he knew that the dementors had vacated their positions he couldn’t shake the feeling of despair and hopelessness that cloaked him; the chill in the air seemed less weather-induced than he cared to admit. Above all, Draco felt lost. He was alone for the foreseeable future and while he was no stranger to isolation, it had usually been his own decision.
“Oh, but where are my manners? Astoria Greengrass, soon to be Malfoy. Apologies for presuming you knew.”
Deciding that they should forego finding a floo location, Harry let Draco apparate Teddy while he took Nick. If Andromeda was unimpressed or confused by their appearance at the front door instead of the fireplace, she didn’t mention it, taking Harry’s hurried whispers by ways of explanation and assuring him that she’d speak with the boys before sending Nick home.
There was a soft smile on Malfoy’s face for all of two seconds before he seemed to remember who he was keeping company with; Harry filed it away for future consideration and tried not to slip up with a responding smile of his own.
Taking a deep breath Harry steeled himself, opening his eyes. “Sorry, yeah. Er.” He paused. “Where was I?”
“What?” Draco said, feigning innocence. “Can’t a man want reprieve from his children every now and then?”
Pansy seemed to take that as confirmation enough that her message had landed, nodding sharply at him before turning to walk back into the pub.
The break in her wavering voice was too much for him and he met her gaze, seeing watery eyes full of fear.
“No, I just—” Hermione sighed, brushing her spare hand through her messy locks. “The Ministry’s a right piece of work sometimes, that’s all.”
“Yeah,” came the answering murmur, Draco’s voice shaking as he turned bright eyes on Harry. “They are.”
Squeezing past an enclosure of particularly energetic crups, Harry turned and stopped dead in his tracks as he took in the sight before him: Draco Malfoy with a tiny ball of red feathers perched on his head. He took his glasses off and wiped his eyes just to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating. Malfoy’s expression was somewhere between panic and
Relaxing into the fingers working their magic on his stiff shoulders, Harry let his eyes float slightly shut and enjoyed the sound of the crackling fire that filled the room. From beneath his half-closed eyelids Harry could see the three boys sitting on the couch opposite him, feet dangling above the floor clad in matching woollen socks. The entire family had a pair; Lily had demanded matching Christmas outfits and this was as far as they’d gotten without too much complaint from the boys. His were visible where his legs stretched out before him on the floor, Draco’s somewhere beside him as Harry sat leaning against the chair he occupied, nestled between his legs.
“You go ahead! We’ll be right inside,” Harry said, smiling as the two boys ran excitedly through the doors.
The elf raised an eyebrow and with a snap of his long, wrinkled fingers he disappeared. Harry heard a muted crack from elsewhere in the house and wondered if there was a book on wizarding illnesses in the Noble House of Black. He supposed it made sense and he should have just looked for himself first before involving Kreacher.
Azkaban was a miserable thought, but one he’d had plenty of time to dwell on over the past few weeks alone at home. Draco had never really expected to come out of the war in a good situation, one way or another. In truth, he’d never spared much thought for what would happen when it all ended, because he’d never expected to make it out alive
And now it was Draco closing the distance between them, Harry’s eyes fluttering closed as their lips met, hesitantly at first before Draco’s fingers found their way into the messy strands of hair at the nape of his neck and tugged, urgency finding its way into their kiss. This kiss was equally as heated as their first had been gentle, the years of pent up aggression and repressed emotion taking over as they pulled closer. Their unspoken words were poured into soft moans and desperate lips, hands finding whatever bare skin they could and staking their claim. It was everything Harry had wanted for yet never dared to dream of, and he kissed as if he were a starving man and Draco Malfoy was to be his last meal.
Malfoy waved off his apology, eyes determinedly fixed on the floor. “It’s fine. I mean, you can hardly blame people for wanting to off ex-Death Eaters, right?”
Once James was tucked into the crib and Harry had cast the necessary observation spells on his room he ducked out into the kitchen, intending to make a cup of tea and maybe curl up with the most recent
“—and on top of that, ask him for more Wideye potion despite me telling you explicitly on Tuesday that you needed to stop drinking it?”
hello i am a big fan of ginny telling harry all the shit he's unwilling to admit to himself and being a supportive friend no matter what (can you tell?)
Cillor showed Harry to the study, assuring him that Master Draco would be taking his tea in there before bed. It appeared he hadn’t been alerted to Harry’s arrival, as the shock that crossed Draco’s features as he entered wasn’t masked carefully enough for Harry not to notice it.
“I thought you said Astoria was fine with this,” Harry said, watching Draco glare in response. “I assume she hasn’t changed her mind?”
Leaning against the wall beside his still open front door, Harry sank slowly to the ground, breath coming in heavy pants as he gave up on rational thought for another night.
Face breaking out in a grin, Harry ignored the snide remark he heard muttered under Draco’s breath and instead focused on seeking out a table for them. Finding one by the glass storefront he made a beeline over and sat with his back to the street, watching Draco make his way to the unoccupied seat when he finished paying.
Harry groaned, leaning back to lay on the bed so he wouldn’t have to look at the disappointment on Kreacher’s face as the elf examined a stray sock that had landed in his bin at some point.
“Though last week he was a bit sad because his parents are getting divorced,” Albus added as an afterthought. “But then I told him how cool it is having two houses and he said maybe it wouldn’t be so bad after all.”
To her credit, Hermione only took a minute to recover from the slight shock at being agreed with. “Well then, send him to someone to sort his emotions out.”
Then again, he hadn’t intended on wearing down a path in his bedroom carpet either. Yet here he was.
Malfoy’s green coat—while in part to blame for camouflaging him behind the tree moments ago—was a stark contrast to the white snow that covered the ground between them. He wore dark jeans with what appeared to be a Slytherin scarf, looking every bit the prat Harry remembered from school. His features held their familiar angular quality yet were slightly softened around the edges, reminding him of their last encounter. The particularly notable difference seemed to be his expression; while it was cautious, the sneer Harry had seen so frequently seemed to have disappeared replaced with something less repulsive, less judgemental. It was a nice look on him, if Harry were being honest.
It all clicked into place then, the weekend prior, the comments that had come over the years and even some of the—
Harry watched as Draco fiddled with the sleeves of his jumper, taking slow breaths like Harry knew he did when something was had made him angry or was particularly stressful. It was the latter today, of course; they’d decided it was time for Draco to meet the family and if they didn’t leave in the next two minutes they were going to be late.
Harry gave a smile he hoped was more convincing than it felt. The last thing he needed right now was a distraught Molly Weasley, fretting over his wellbeing while mourning the loss of her son. He felt bad enough that Ron was here having to take on his troubles.
Malfoy laughed, a rich, warm sound that filled Harry’s chest with something he didn’t want to examine too closely. “Fine. Just because you asked so nicely.” Picking up his glass, Malfoy took another sip as he seemed to think on how best to phrase his words. “It started in Azkaban. Something that one of the Muggleborn inmates suggested, actually. Apparently it’s quite common among the Muggles he grew up with and well, when you’re incarcerated through the holidays you cling onto what little you can. There were only a few of us who agreed in the end—five, to be exact—and we kept doing it in the years that followed.”
There was a pause, Malfoy seeming to think on his response quite intently for a while. After what seemed like an eternity, his shoulders dropped and he shot Harry a despairing look. “I’ve been dating.”
Blinking rapidly as he gathered his bearings and watched Pansy step out from where she’d evidently been leaning against the brick wall, Harry raised an awkward hand. “Er, Pansy, hi.”
Which was how he found himself here, Ginny dressed to the nines by his side and teasing him for being too distracted by a certain blonde to focus on anything else.
Shaking his head, Draco reminded himself that the heat he was feeling was imagined. The Fiendfyre had ravaged the room but it was long gone, only memories leaving the whisper on his skin.
“Alright, alright.” Seamus raised his hands in mock surrender. “Show me yours, I’ll show you mine. Seems fair.”
Sighing, Harry looked at the gentle pity in her eyes before taking a long drink from the mulled wine, cinnamon and orange rolling over his tastebuds. “Honestly? I’m not sure he ever will.”
“What conversation? You heard Nick, I’m a monster. Even Teddy thinks so,” he added in a bitter undertone.
Patiently waiting in hope that Healer Benson would buy it, Harry pulled a sheepish look in her direction. She sighed and gave what could almost be considered a laugh before dismissing his vitals with a wave of her hand.
Shaking his head at the barrage of thoughts that threatened to drive him insane, Harry grabbed parchment from the drawer and a self inking quill from atop the desk and began to scrawl a quick congratulatory note.
“Stop looking at me like the world is ending and it’s all your fault. I’m a big girl. Also, you’re not allowed to hurt me and then make it all about you.”
After a while he realised just how much Ginny had always been able to see through him; he mentioned coffee with Draco and a knowing look crossed her face as she listened to him explain, falling over himself in apologies for not seeing it for what it was sooner.
He carefully put the crate aside and cast a cushioning charm around it, wary of customers tripping over it while he had his back turned. Only took an accident to happen once before you knew better than to tempt fate ever again.
“You heard me.” Draco sighed, meeting his gaze for a quick moment before turning to walk away. “I’m leaving for France tomorrow. We’re both getting married in the new year. There’s nothing more to say.”
Trying to hide his smile as he heard the familiar words fall from Harry’s mouth once more, Draco simply nodded in response. Somehow in the few months since that fateful meeting by the Astronomy Tower they had fallen into step, and this practice was becoming infinitely easier with a partner.
It was strange, really, how though he was absolutely certain he hadn't experienced half of what his brain was telling him had happened, it was so vivid and real to him. The memories weren't muddled or hazy at all; he could remember everything with absolute clarity. He just logically knew they were fake. His mind seemed tampered with, invaded. It felt like someone had gone in and messed with his memories, yet he didn't think anyone would either want to do that or be able to do it without him realising. He couldn't pinpoint the time that his recollection of the year spent at the Manor in fear had shifted in his mind's eye. The only thing he knew for certain was that he was completely uncertain about what had actually occurred.
“Well, a lot of the marked Death Eaters were a generation above us, so they’d made their decisions early and had time to accept how things could be. But Draco… Well, he was raised to think he would have it all, then coaxed into it for his family and ended up left with nothing.”
“Scorpius, dear. It’s wonderful to see you.” Over his shoulder, she winked at Harry with a playful smile. “I’ll have him at the Manor in the morning in plenty of time for your date.”
