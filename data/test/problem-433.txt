that can make anyone want to get their shit together, “Don’t. It’s not worth it.”
"So lovely to finally meet you, Mr Potter! I'm Janice Wrigglesworth, Draco's secretary." Janice takes his hand, and Harry bites back a startled and amused laugh. So this is Janice. Draco hadn't been exaggerating. "You know Draco, of course... I've heard
"Good," Draco says, slowly preparing to exit the kitchen. "I'm late for work, so..."
But Malfoy looks
Draco’s expression is one of shock for at least five seconds, until he manages to pull himself together. "How do you know about that?"
"That doesn't sound very Malfoy," Harry mutters, shifting so that he can see Draco’s face and moving dark fringe out of his eyes.
"—and I would like to know where my good owl is," Draco continues, as though without interruption, "Unless you've gone into professional owl-napping now that you're done with saving the world."
He could kiss Draco...
he wants to say, but as Malfoy’s left hand comes up to brush hair from his eyes, all that comes out is: “Are those
"S'not really about dying or not dying," Harry mumbles, shifting onto his side and touching Draco's forearm, the one with the stupid ugly Voldemort tattoo. It doesn't look so bad when it can't summon evil, but maybe that’s because Harry’s also drunk off his arse. "Did that hurt?"
Harry says, purring the name for reasons he doesn’t quite know.
"I wanted to tell you... something,” Harry says, and suddenly, he isn’t sure of any of this. He’d come all this way, ran all the way up the huge drive at Malfoy Manor, and now, standing inches from the safety of the indoors, he’s more nervous than he’s been all year.
“I’m not going outside, Hermione.”
Not so bad. But Harry would still like to get the hell out as soon as possible.
Draco chooses that moment to appear in the kitchen doorway. They make eye contact for a few moments, and Harry observes that Draco must be just as hungover as he is.
"Yeah," Draco finally replies, though he doesn’t sound half as impressed as Harry had. "It's clear tonight."
Hermione stares at him as if he's gone mad. "Arthur's got a new wireless, and that song is always playing. You look like you've seen a ghost, Harry, is everything all right?"
"... we need you to attend this event, and as such, I shan't be taking no for an answer," Malfoy finishes, looking at Harry as though proud of his little speech.
"Right. Well, I left some bags by the door, so..." she says, and Harry wonders what the fuck it is about today that's making people unable to finish their sentences.
"That's why you don't go outside," Malfoy murmurs, "This is your... what is it? A sanctuary? A hiding place? A waiting room?"
Malfoy taps his fingers. “No. Potter, I’m going to explain this again, and again, and again until you finally agree to going.”
Hardly believing his ears, Harry laughs softly. Draco looks terrified, as if he wishes he hadn't said that, and he probably does, seeing as all Harry would have to do is say "no, actually, I'm not so sure," and then the whole thing will be shot.
Malfoy drops down onto the floor a few feet away, and Harry sees small puffs of dust rise up from the floor in his peripheral vision.
When he leaves the room, Malfoy is trailing behind him.
Harry frowns, “That’s his name.”
Draco watches him with a mix of amusement and sadness. Because he's leaving, Harry realises, and now he doesn't have a reason to come back. Even in his sadness, the thought that Draco doesn't want to leave makes Harry's stomach flutter pleasantly.
"Fine. No problem. Harry, I really—" whatever Draco 'really' did, Harry doesn't find out, because in that moment, there's a loud crash and a wobbly, flying creature comes through the window.
At this thought, Harry deepens his glare. "You're a horrible singer. What do you want, apart from disturbing my neighbours?"
, Harry thinks.
He thinks about what he does need, and then he thinks of nothing, because he isn't sure what he needs, but he knows that what he
He thinks of Ron, his first real friend, the champion chess player that had saved him time and time again, always coming back, and always fighting Harry’s cause. He thinks of what Ron might be doing now. At the Weasleys’ with Hermione, Harry would guess, but he doesn't know; of course he doesn’t, because Ron never writes much in his letters.
Now, sitting alone in the Park, Harry goes over these events in his head, a tiny small on his face.
And it’s becoming unavoidable that he doesn’t just love the gloves.
"Apparently," Draco says conversationally, "it's all about layering. Isn't that fascinating?"
"Thought you weren't keeping score," Draco looks down at his hands, and murmurs this so quietly Harry almost thinks he heard wrong. He knows that he didn’t, though, and Malfoy is right: it isn’t fair for him to bring that up now, not years later when it doesn’t matter and when Malfoy has been doing everything possible to take it back.
Draco’s face breaks into a shining smile. "You haven't lived."
"Ron seems to be quite pleased, now that he's positive Ginny will end up with someone he can trust, after all." Hermione gives Harry a knowing look, "Even if it's not the person he always thought she would be with."
"I found your horrible cat," Malfoy says, through grit teeth.
"I do have my own owl," Harry mumbles, gesturing to a sleeping owl in the corner behind Malfoy (“Samira,” Hermione had named it, but Harry felt it best not to get attached). "It's not my fault if yours didn't want to go back to you. It's definitely not my fault if you mistreat your owls,” Harry adds, giving Malfoy a look that properly conveys he’s well aware Malfoy is an owl abuser.
******
Draco nods in understanding, but his eyes narrow marginally. “You don’t want to bottom.”
They manage to get as far as the middle of the entrance hall when Harry decides that he really doesn’t feel like waiting any more. Dropping his hands to the belt on Draco’s robe—mouth watering at the nice-sized bulge that’s completely obvious through the thin material of Draco’s pants—Harry tears the belt away. Slowly, trembling with want, Harry pushes the robe off of Draco’s shoulders. Suddenly, there’s a canvas of pale, gorgeous skin in front of him, and Harry thinks he could stare forever. Lean muscles, slender hips, and peaked nipples all beg him to touch. He examines Draco’s entire upper body before settling his gaze on the erect cock that’s almost tearing through his pajama bottoms.
Days later, two things are becoming apparent: A) Harry hasn't finished a book in weeks, his old habits shoved aside to make room for Draco-time, and B) Draco Malfoy is not a quitter.
But Harry knows that after the Gala, Draco won’t be coming back anyway, and that makes him even more upset and infinitely more angry.
"Forgive me for being surprised that you'd re-plot an Unplottable location," Malfoy sighs, reaching for his coffee. "Especially now I know how paranoid you are. Anyway, what's pressure got to do with anything? I thought you loved all that.”
“Hang on,” Harry says, slowly looking up. “That’s—I know that song you’re humming. I’ve heard it somewhere before.”
Inexplicably, Harry feels hurt. He shouldn’t be surprised that Malfoy would stoop to that level, not really, and yet Harry had thought they were past that.
******
When he arrives at Grimmauld Place, Harry is too exhausted to bother with the Floo, and more than that, he's hoping a certain blond will put it to use again before the connection is closed. Moving slowly, he walks into his living room and sits on his favourite armchair. Replays the night's events. Thinks about what will happen tomorrow, when Draco doesn't have a reason to come back to Grimmauld Place, and Harry can finally get his old life back.
Pale fingers curl tighter around the bottom of the cup. "What? Why?"
his brain insists,
"No,” Harry says, trying not to nervously rub at his face. And failing.
"Pretend?"
he says, smirking. “Don't think I can't hear you thinking it, too.”
Still, he feels not dissimilar to the way he did when he walked into the forest to die two years ago. Harry tries not to read too far into that; he knows that, if Draco thought the Gala wouldn't be safe, he wouldn't have made Harry go at all. And yet, Harry feels sick. He feels anxious and nervous and completely off-kilter; he hates the mix of emotions stirring in his stomach, and he hates that the first time he's leaving his safety zone is for a fucking Gala, and he hates that he can't even say no, he can't even turn back now. Because Harry can’t stand to see Draco, with his stupidly beautiful hair and face and personality, lose everything he’s worked so hard to build for himself since after the war.
sit at his table and drink his coffee and act like he knows Harry at
Draco....
Mrs. N appears before Harry can properly warn Malfoy against what is about to occur.
"I'll be there, all right? I said I'd be there, and I'll be there. I'm sure I don't want to at all, but I'm sure I'm going to do it anyway."
"Yeah. Just like you're doing."
"Your boss? Mrs. Chondley-whatsit?" Harry asks.
"I'm going upstairs," Harry informs him. "The Park looks pretty cool at night."
They haven't discussed sexuality ever before, and Harry wonders if he's supposed to know about Draco's preferences. Although, truthfully, it's not exactly well-hidden. Even in Hogwarts, there had been signs—not rumours, of course, because too many people had been afraid of Malfoy back then to spread them—that Draco preferred men, like the way he leaned more into their touch and the way he looked slightly queasy when a variety of Slytherin girls—Pansy Parkinson in the lead—threw themselves at him. Harry’s suspicions had begun in sixth year, when he’d spent most of his time watching Malfoy’s every move, but he hadn’t given them much thought until Draco had showed up more recently at his house. Ever since then, he’d noticed that actually spending time with Draco wouldn’t leave anyone unsure as to which way he swung.
he thinks, pounding the doorbell slightly hysterically. He should have thought this through more. For all he knows, Draco is at work, or in bed with another person—
“Oi, I heard that! And for the record, he has; obviously, I didn’t listen to him either.”
After a few more minutes, he's had enough.
Malfoy is silent for a precious, precious moment. Then:
Harry wants to cry. For the first time since second May, he wants to cry, and that would not do.  He wishes Draco would leave, wishes he would just leave and not come back until the stupid Gala was over and they could talk about something else.
"You'd know," Harry comments.
charm. Five-thirty in the morning. Harry gets out of bed and wipes at his eyes, although they're dry. He’s too tired to cry.
"You're a gonefore conclusion," Harry mutters, choking on more Ogden's. God, he never drinks. Now he remembers why: it burns.
"You died," Malfoy confirms softly, looking at the ground.
*****
He waits alone in the room Draco set up for him, sticking close to the fire in case he needs a quick getaway.
Harry opens the window and calls Malfoy’s owl, barely wincing as it lands on his shoulder and digs sharp talons into his skin. He’s used to claw-on-skin contact, after looking after Mrs. Norris for so long.
Instead of mocking the constant face-rubbing, Malfoy wonders, "Why did you make me coffee?"
A warm hand traces over the freezing skin on his back, and the feel of it makes Harry catch his breath. He tugs at Draco’s hair, running his hands through it again and again, unable to get enough of its softness.
Looking up at her and grabbing another package, he mumbles, "No, it was fine."
about you..."
Instead, looking at the head of bushy hair across the table and with his life completely back to the way it had been for a year, Harry feels empty.
“It’s from Ron,” he says, finding it difficult to hide his excitement. It’s the first letter from Ron in over six weeks.
Draco scoffs. Harry drinks his coffee.
Now, standing outside the front gates on Draco’s enormous property, he panics for the first time.
Draco looks a little bit like he wants to cry, too. "You can't build a life around being safe and calm all the time. That's not how it works."
Malfoy sighs, "I don't suppose it's as though you can tell anyone, is it? I have one mad old bint who thinks she's my mother, one incompetent house-elf, and... well, you."
“There is a new law being passed,” Hermione continues, sounding genuinely friendly, “Regarding the amount of time house elves have to work, in proportion to the amount of time they ever have off. The law is attempting to help give elves more free time, and I’m wondering—to help strengthen my argument, of course—in your experience, what are common house elf hobbies?”
“Malfoy,” drifts back through the house to him, and Harry merely rolls his eyes.
"Look at the ceiling, not at me," he murmurs, because he wants Draco to see his Park sky just as much as he wants Draco to see
Harry thinks of the first real conversation he ever had with him, back when those letters were the bane of his existence, and Draco was still Malfoy. “I was thinking I might show Draco. He said something to me once about going to the park. I didn’t tell him at the time that I already have one.”
Hermione returns with more packages later than she should have, and when he looks at her, she just shakes her head.
Reaching for his coffee, Harry scowls. “What?”
"Oh, really?" Malfoy says, smirking his stupid face off.
"Shut up," Harry says sternly, grabbing things from the cabinets as he decides on their next meal. "You're going to eat this and then leave, because I've a pounding headache and I need to sleep."
Harry blushes, "Well, that... that wasn't all Draco's fault."
Harry murmurs something along the lines of, "Yeah, well." He can see where this conversation is headed.
finding out and hounding him about it was too severe. Since then, it seemed as though dropping a bomb like
"I just know,” he mutters. “I've seen you at the breakfast table enough times over the years.”
Shaking her head in what looks like exasperation, Hermione huffs, “I guess not.”
"Is that a statement or a question?" Harry asks, for no good reason, and his resolve cracks. He steps close to Draco, though not nearly as close as he wants, and reaches for the robe on his belt. It’s a soft, expensive material, and Harry wants it on the floor.
He struggles to put lyrics to the tune. Hermione does it for him. She sings:
"Whether to stay there... to stay dead... or to go back and try to save more people." Saying it out loud isn’t as scary as Harry had once thought it would be.
"It's polite to make eye contact," Draco whispers.
"Even Malfoy needs something from me," Harry mutters, before deciding that it's about time he stops talking to himself. It’s a bad sign. He isn't getting
Harry stares at him disbelievingly. “Don’t
Draco Malfoy smells
"Well," Malfoy begins, and Harry knows he’s in for a lot of questioning. The thought doesn’t bother him as much as it did a few minutes ago; he’s too tired to care anymore, and he supposes the cat’s out of the bag, anyway.
And that is absolutely nothing like what Harry wants to hear. "What? No! You'll do no such thing!"
"Now, shut up and lie down," he says, guiding Draco to the middle of the room.
"I don't sleep well."
Still, if it weren’t for the appreciative look on Draco’s face, Harry would have backed out by now. He’s barely had time to worry about actually attending the Gala, what with all the work that needs to be done before-hand.
Harry grabs a bottle of Ogden's from the top cupboard. Draco's eyebrows shoot up.
Both men hold their breaths, awaiting Hermione’s reaction. She cocks her head, apparently thinking about it closely. After a moment of thoughtful expression, she asks curiously,
Harry hadn’t been listening. Harry had been leaning against the counter drinking coffee and wondering why Malfoy had smiled like that.
Instead of an immediate spoken response, Harry feels fingertips brush his knuckles. He closes his eyes.
He feels Draco move onto the carpet, and then he feels Draco's eyes on him.
Harry doesn’t ask until they’ve settled into the kitchen.
Harry groans predictably when he opens the door; although, really, he’s not very upset. Can’t have Malfoy knowing that, though.
Draco sits on the opposite side of the kitchen, chatting with the cupboards as Harry and Hermione have an in-depth discussion about house elf rights, something Hermione has been struggling for since she first joined the Ministry, without much avail.
"Harry..." She begins, then shakes her head again, apparently at a loss for words. "Harry, you are such an idiot."
Retrieving Malfoy’s scarf actually isn’t that difficult, once he’s found the cat and Stunned it gently. Back in the kitchen, Malfoy is looking forlornly at him hands and still trying to brush any remaining dust off his trousers. Harry pours them both coffee and leans against the counter.
standing in my kitchen three days in a row?" Harry asks, stepping aside to let Malfoy into his house. It’s not like he has much of a choice.
Harry can’t help wondering, with little sense, why he’s never done this before.
After a moment, Draco smirks. “Maybe I’ll teach you eloquence as well,” he says offhandedly, his flippant words contrasting with the smile blooming across his face. Kneeling on his bed and fiddling with the band on his pajama pants—his robe and Harry’s shirt and coat are still in the entrance hall—Draco’s smile grows. “Everything is good,” he murmurs softly, taking Harry by the back of his neck and pulling him closer. “I want you inside me, anyway.”
"At all?"
Any retort Harry had in mind slips when he processes Malfoy’s comment. "How do you know that?" he demands.
stupid. It’s becoming more apparent with every passing second.
Harry snorts quietly, feeling the tension in the kitchen sliding away, as well as his anger. Slowly, he slides to the floor, drawing his knees up and looking at his scratched hands. "Did you just ask me if I died metaphorically? Only you, Malfoy."
"Who the hell wants you dead, Potter?" Malfoy snaps, and those few moments of him being ‘Draco’ fall away.
"I'm fine," Draco says, following Harry into the kitchen.
"You're insufferable," Draco whispers, and his pale fingers twine in Harry’s sopping wet hair.
When they arrive there, Harry takes a moment to look around: there’s a wide window pane on one side of the room, with a walk-out portico through it. An antique dresser sits in a corner near what can only be the entrance to a walk-in closet. The mirror on top lets Harry know that his hair is in a state.
"You said you wanted to go to the park."
Malfoy eyes him anxiously for a moment. "Er, good."
Draco has a date? Apparently he does, and Harry knows that it isn't his place to care about that… but who had he asked, anyway? He's been at Grimmauld Place so much lately that Harry just assumed he didn't have time for anyone else. Maybe he's dating someone his parents picked out to help rebuild the Malfoy name's respect. It would make sense, Harry supposes, his mouth feeling increasingly dry.
"A normal person would've taken my lack of response as the second option," Harry snaps.
The last bit of Harry's mind that's sober is insisting he stop it this instant, because getting drunk with Draco Malfoy is the epitome of bad ideas. However, the last bit of Harry's mind that's sober is completely overruled. He takes another swig from his cup.
Not thinking about Draco Malfoy, though, turns out to be impossible.
"You've lost me. And it wouldn't be—"
Mrs. Norris? What happened to Filch?" Malfoy asks, sounding generally interested.
Stupid fucking piece of—
It's different."
“It’s not?” Harry doesn’t understand; of course it’s important, if Draco heard all those horrible things he said.
Mrs. Norris, it seems, is in as bad a mood as Harry. He finds her shredding the curtains in what was probably Grandpa Black's old study. Not thinking properly, Harry reaches for her, and receives scratched hands for his trouble. Muttering a curse, he finally shoots a small shocking spell at her, and grabs her when she’s distracted.
But Harry won’t think about that now, because Hermione is here, and that’s just weird.
Harry stares at him, watches Malfoy failing to control his anger, and thinks that this obvious seething passion is actually interesting to watch. In fact, he could watch Malfoy churn negative emotions all day; it’s schadenfreude, and it reminds Harry that he’s not the only one that doesn’t have all the control they need.
expect you to understand. You didn't have the same sort of upbringing I did. It's no one's fault," Malfoy says quietly, as though trying to comfort him.
The moment he sits down, those intentions shift rapidly.
Now is the one time a year that Harry allows himself to sit down and think about it.
"Ducks. On your gloves," Harry repeats, sounding faint, shocked to the core for the second time today, and he can barely fight the smile attempting to work its way onto his face. "You're wearing gloves with ducks on them. Draco Malfoy is wearing duck gloves."
Draco looks down his gloves, concerned frown still in place.
As they enter the park together, Harry feels the urge to both hang onto Draco and run the fuck away.
“Potter, you look like you’re about the cry. Or punch something. Just so you know, there’s a cat somewhere around here that would be a perfect target for that.”
"What isn't?"
"This is the same person, mind you, who forces me into those terrible duck gloves. So you see what I have to put up with."
“No one understands how difficult it must be for them!” Hermione rants, sipping Harry’s Earl Grey, which she prefers to his coffee (even the good Guatemalan one). “Working all the time, and with no breaks or anything. It’s slavery, only worse because of the way they hurt themselves.” A weird gleam coming into her eyes, she asks. “What do you think, Draco?”
"Nothing much... that I'm a very nice young man," Harry shrugs, kicking Draco lightly in the foot. "I'd like to know what you've said to her; she seems to know all about me."
The speech is finally over after what might have been years. Harry nods, feeling awkward, and immediately searches Draco out in the room. President Cholmondely seems intent on bothering the hell out of him, however, and immerses him in conversation herself (though Harry thinks it must be pretty obvious from all the attention he has on Draco that she isn't the one he'd been wanting to sit with). Through the meal, Harry murmurs 'mmm's and 'of course's at Cholmondely, and he finds that, really, it's not so bad here.
"They don't camp outside your door?" Malfoy asks. "I thought they would."
Harry sighs. "Yes."
Harry wonders what would happen if he punched Malfoy in the face. It’s a sad thought, because he’s sure the bastard would stay, anyway.
Harry’s chest fills with emotion at the words and their implications, and as he murmurs, "Sounds like a plan," and watches Draco smiling lazily, he feels like he could stay here forever. Well, if the marble underneath him weren’t so uncomfortable. "Did I really just have sex on your staircase?"
Harry rolls his eyes at Draco's badmouthing of the cat, distracted by thoughts of more important things. Like how Draco will react to this. Not that Harry is entirely sure why that makes him so nervous, only that it does.
"What?" Malfoy asks, sounding agitated, and Harry can see why, considering the hailstorm that has apparently been falling on Malfoy while Harry was upstairs. He feels slightly guilty.
Draco moves in his peripheral vision, and Harry turns immediately to look at him. Janice has just left, and Draco is looking back at Harry with a smile on his face. Harry's lips quirk.
"I guess it's a Black thing," Harry says, "Sirius left this house to me, so I'm its master, so to speak. You've got Black blood, so it must recognise that, too. Weird."
"How is it that I go to all this trouble to keep everyone out of here, and yet I've had
Slightly embarrassed, Harry nods. "Oh, yeah." He pauses, wondering if he should say anything else about it, and then deciding that it's either say something now or have Draco think he's shagging call-girls on a regular basis. "I was joking... about the call-girls, you know?"
“Who—I mean, did you want, or should I...?” Harry stops himself and rearranges his thoughts, attempting to sound slightly more articulate, lest Draco mock him. What he settles on is: “I’ve never had sex with a man. Like I said before. So I don’t...”
Gripping his stomach—because the anxiety Harry’s feeling is very similar to like, and the butterflies fluttering around his stomach are creaky from disuse—Harry walks upstairs to sit below his sparkling park sky. Sitting on the carpet and watching the stars thoughtlessly seems a much better idea than thinking about any new developments in his acquaintanceship/ friendship/ whatever the fuck it is with Malfoy.
The first thing he's aware of is a headache like he hasn't had months.
"Good morning to you, too, Potter," Malfoy calls, as he follows Harry through the hallway, into the kitchen.
It feels like forever before he reaches the front porch, and Harry only has two slight heart attacks before he gets there. His frazzled mind takes two full minutes to find the magic-powered doorbell, and by that time he’s shaking.
"Oh, ha ha." Draco sneers, face twisting. "Doesn't the she-Weasel service your every need any more?"
He needs a drink. Coffee, preferably. And maybe the strongest alcohol he's got in the house.
"If I'm the something then everything changes," Draco says quietly, and the emotion in his grey eyes is suffocating.
On Saturday, he receives an owl from none other than Janice.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Why can't she do it herself, if it's so important?"
There's a knock on the door that sounds almost nervous, and Harry practically rips the door off its hinges in an effort to get it open.
Harry's feelings are out of control. Draco really, really needs to get out.
This time, Harry's too tired to care. "I’ll find something eventually," He says. "I'm not sure if it will be a someone. I really doubt it will be." Rubbing his face, he adds, "You don't have to worry about me, 'Mione. I'll be fine. Really. We're not in a war anymore."
Harry frowns. That last thought in his head had sounded suspiciously like something Draco would say.
Damn it, that shouldn't be disappointing; it should be a fucking relief.
Harry smiles slightly, for the irony of Malfoy's understanding if nothing else. “Waiting is a good word."
"Probably not, but it's certainly a start," Draco says, sparking hope in Harry because that means there will be
“Who’s Mrs. N?” is the only response. Malfoy actually looks intrigued. It’s a far cry from the disdainful expressions Harry is accustomed to getting from him. Or,
Harry squeezes his eyes shut.
Draco doesn't reply. He sighs, and after a moment suspended in time, finds Harry's hand on the carpet. Their fingers lightly touch, and despite how fast his heart is hammering in his chest, Harry feels more serene than he has in a long, long time.
Hermione comes over the next day, and when they both hear the tell-tale knock on Harry’s door, she frowns and rises to see who it is before Harry has time to explain.
*****
******
He thinks about Hagrid, of the first day they'd ever met, of finding out that he's a wizard. He thinks of laying limp in Hagrid's arms as the half-giant cried big, fat tears over Harry’s supposedly dead body on the walk out of the forest.
"No. Hermione's tried enough times, believe me,” Harry smiles at a memory of her doing just that and snorts, “Typical that you should be the only other person who can understand it, now I'll never get rid of you."
"You look pleased," Harry notes, trying and failing to sound anything but anxious. The way Draco is looking at him now isn't helping the churning of his stomach. "Did you think I wasn't going to come?"
The look on Draco’s face right before they Disapparate outweighs the fear the encompasses Harry.
"You... I'll use a Silencing Charm," Harry says triumphantly, pleased to have discovered a way out.
It’s an invitation to the newest W.O.T. event, a Quidditch picnic. Harry reads it twice before sending the owl away without a reply. He's not sure how he feels about seeing Draco, not after their drunken kissing session and awkward goodbye. He doubts he'll go, but he doesn't reject the invitation yet.
“Yes, but even so…”
He almost wants to laugh at the look of terrified shock on Draco’s face, but instead he just makes his way to the kitchen.
“Actually, I can’t, thanks to Granger and her new laws against exactly that.” He sighs, but Harry notices that there’s no malice in his tone. Harry doesn’t think Draco minds this whole Reconsidering-What-Being-A-Malfoy-Is thing. “And what do you mean,
"Yep."
“Hermione.”
Harry realises that he's actually happy he came. He knows that it means a lot to Draco.
There’s no real use denying the hard-on that is growing steadily in Harry’s denims. It’s the first one he’s had in months, sure, but it isn’t as though he’s forgotten the feeling. Shakily wrapping a hand around his cock, Harry decides that it’s perfectly acceptable to take advantage of the situation.
Malfoy just shrugs and says, "I think we've already established that I have no such thing, so what I thought I'd do is keep coming back here every day until you accept the invitation."
"It's important, but not top level important, apparently. It's VP important. Aren't you glad you know exactly how important you are?"
"Er... too late in the year for hailstones?" Harry says instead, slamming the door shut and stifling a yawn. "And it's Harry, remember?"
Harry is caught between pity and amusement as he makes his way over to where Malfoy is sitting on the floor. Showing him the various cuts on his own hands, he says, sheepishly, "That was Mrs. N. She can hear a silk scarf at fifty paces, or so it seems. That, along with a whole list of other things that upset her delicate sensibilities... I'm still finding them out myself. Hence the scratches."
“Shut the fuck up,” Harry growls, knowing that he shouldn’t take his anger out on Malfoy and doing it anyway.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Don't you have a meeting to get to, O Big Important Ministry Employee?"
"You're mad," Draco mutters.
and Harry regarding the ceiling with calmness.
—Harry is going to kill him. Right now.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. "Hermione, just leave it alone."
Harry feels Malfoy’s eyes on his back, and fights the shiver of discomfort that passes through him, choosing to slouch further instead. He wishes Malfoy wouldn’t look at him like that. There’s a reason he hasn’t left the house in a year, and part of it is that people used to watch him all the time, and it still makes him increasingly uncomfortable.
Harry extends his magic to feel the wards; they certainly aren’t weak, but he reckons it will only take a minute or two to tear them down. He does so as quickly as possible, barely glancing around himself at all while he does. If something happens to him now, he deserves it after the way he treated Draco.
would plummet everyone back into the depressed mindset they had all harboured during the war.
need me to?"
"I told you I don't want to talk about that," Harry hisses.
Two years ago today, the war ended.
Harry thinks of all the days Draco had come to Grimmauld Place not even sure if Harry would be attending the Gala, thinks of the owls his mum sends him at five in the morning and of the only pair of ears that has heard his story about dying. He sighs, not unhappily. "He doesn’t deserve it," Harry agrees. "Don't tell him I said that."
"Glad we got that cleared up," Malfoy murmers faintly, looking away. "So, you came back. You saved lots of lives. You defeated the Dark Lord. I'd say you made a good call."
Harry wants to shout, but instead he just says, "It can work that way if I want it to."
"It's Saturday," Harry points out.
Harry raises his eyebrows. “Talking to me is better than being murdered? Wow, Malfoy, that’s the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to me.”
"Or avoid them," Malfoy says pointedly, rubbing the back of his head, possibly because he, too, is developing a headache. "You never go outside. You never see anyone. Except for me, and we both know there's very little point talking about the Gala today." Malfoy assures, "I shall resume that topic of discussion tomorrow morning."
"I don't feel anything," Harry interrupts, practically shouting, wishing people would just
he thinks.
Draco shrugs, staring out the still-transparent door and biting his lip. When he looks back at Harry, grey eyes are clear and twinkling.
The next several days are some of the slowest since he’d first decided not to leave the house after the war. Harry wakes up on Thursday, the day after Hermione brought him food packages and Draco left for good, not knowing what to do with himself. Two months ago, he would have reached next to him and gotten his newest novel from the bedside table, or gotten up and worked on his wandless magic. Harry rejects both of those ideas, and tries to tell himself that it isn’t because he’d rather have snarky arguments with Draco than do either of those things.
Draco watches him quietly for a moment, before saying slowly, "So, if you have a pounding headache..."
Harry has just gotten to the coffee part of that plan when the cupboard flaps a greeting above him. Turning around, he sees Draco in the kitchen doorway.
"So, they all ran away from their problems," Harry confirms, askance.
Dropping the still-struggling Mrs. Norris, Harry leaves the room. He doesn't know what else to do.
It's a poor attempt at a reprieve. Draco talks about the Gala until Harry suspects that even he's getting sick of it. By the end of the day, Harry is dangerously low on good coffee.
” echoes through the house, and Harry freezes on his couch. Dear Merlin, no.
Draco smiles slyly. "Behind Madam," he points.
"Why the fuck does that matter?" Draco sounds slightly out of breath.
When Malfoy flashes him a huge grin for no reason at all, Harry’s heart skips a little. For no reason at all.
Harry had thought their time together meant more than what Draco pretended it did. Apparently, Harry had been the one pretending that it meant anything at all.
Harry flips him two fingers and reaches for the note, petting a twitchy Pigwidgeon II as he does.
is why Harry doesn't drink. S'dangerous.
"Read what," Harry hears Malfoy mutter from behind him and across the kitchen. "Good grief, you're annoying."
Turning away, Harry slowly walks over to Sirius’ bed, where he has only been once before: exactly a year ago on second May. That day, Harry had lain in the bed for hours, not moving except for shaking tears. Now, Harry lies back in Sirius’ bed. This time, he doesn’t cry. Instead, he thinks.
Harry, peeved from lack of sleep, points out, "You know, when you call me Potter, it makes me feel about thirteen.”
Draco looks amused. "Good call."
Harry flicks his hand and thinks of a cleaning charm. When Draco examines his newly cleaned hand, he scowls unconvincingly.
Harry feels a tug at his belt loops and realises that his staring might be a little weird. “Sorry,” he says breathlessly. "I wanted to see you," he admits, finally allowing himself to move away the restricting pajamas and touch the hot, hard flesh jutting out from blond curls. It’s so different than the way a girl feels, new and exciting and amazingly
But on the other hand, it’s still
"You're late," Harry accuses one day, when Malfoy comes an hour or two later than usual. Harry would never admit it out loud, but he had been worried that Malfoy wouldn't show up at all; worried that he'd found a different way to get Harry to go to the Gala, one that didn't include seeing him every day. "Mrs. N and I had to eat your bacon."
A scene plays in Harry’s head, a painful memory from years ago in which Draco is shaking on the Astronomy tower and black-clad murderers are piled around him, telling him to kill Dumbledore,
not for snarking contests or trashy magazine reading time or to make fun of Mrs Norris.
definitely nothing Harry had ever seen in school.
Harry rolls his eyes, kissing the closest part of Draco—his shoulder—in an attempt to shut him up. "I've had sex, Draco. But not with a man. And not with you. And not on a staircase."
"They used to," Harry admits, scrunching his nose at those memories. "They gave up." Then, without wanting to or meaning to, he changes the subject back to, "You don't really have dozens of friends, do you?"
Draco looks over, and their eyes meet for longer than ever before.
Taking the slip of paper in slight confusion and making his way back towards the door, Malfoy shouts, “This isn’t over, Potter!”
Harry assures himself that these are the only options, even as his chest aches at the thought.
The mention of the occasion when Harry had been forcibly dragged to Malfoy Manor seems to shut Malfoy up for a while. He wonders why talking about the hours Harry spent at Malfoy Manor seems to make Malfoy and guilty, instead of proud or indignant.
Harry tries to smile at him, but suspects that he doesn't do a very good job at it.
Harry reminds himself,
Sunday, he owls Hermione and asks her to stop by. He doesn’t trust himself to be alone.
That is why Harry’s less than pleased when Draco ducks the spatula he’s thrown just in time.
“So,” Draco says, faux-casual. “What’s it going to take for me to convince you to go back outside?”
"I was just trying to get your attention. You looked like you were having a seizure."
"Charming," Draco says sarcastically, rolling his eyes. "What about you?"
"Sorry," Draco says, shedding an expensive coat. "But, hey, your next door neighbour's painted his house purple, did you see?"
Shooting up rapidly and making his head throb, Harry looks around. Yes, he's in the Park, the last place he remembers being. And yes, there is Malfoy, the last person he remembers... being with. Harry cringes.
Harry shrugs, feeling awkward. “Not
They settle down at the kitchen table. Hermione frowns. “What did you need to ask?”
Malfoy has been chatting with Harry’s cabinets, and more of a
Draco chuckles behind him. "No, it's not. It's cleaner here. Purer. And anyway, I hardly think you can call yourself an expert on fresh air."
lonely, after all.
Draco obliges, and swiftly gasps.
Draco's face falls so swiftly and so far down that Harry almost rethinks his words. But they are true, and they are effective. Apparently.
"Shut up," Malfoy says. "Look what your cat did to me."
“Malfoy.” Harry says dangerously, because he’s unhappy and
Harry wonders what Ron and Hermione are doing right now. Sighing, he murmurs, "I'm not your friend, Malfoy,”
Draco pauses. "A lot."
"What?"
Harry's brain pulses in agony, and he doubts it's from the hangover this time.
Harry sighs. “You’ll be talking forever, Malfoy.”
"Well," Malfoy finally says, after a long moment of
Harry thinks, but doesn’t say anything. It isn’t his concern.
Draco catches his breath, as if surprised Harry remembered. "Did I?"
“She said she was going to fire me, and make sure I never got another job in charity, and... Potter, I’m sorry.” Malfoy sounds sorry, too, but it isn’t enough.
Harry stands up as soon as he remembers to, still slightly surprised by the old lady's turn up and a little antsy about having to speak with another person.
Harry wonders if perhaps he’ll have his fight, after all.
"Plenty.” Harry responds immediately. “It's the difference between whether I'm saying no because I'm not interested in big, glitzy galas that cost almost as much as they make for their cause, or whether I'm saying no because I don't like you."
He picks up the book he’d been reading before Hermione’s arrival—and, consequently, all night before that. He hadn’t been able to sleep. Not when Remus still haunts his dreams, and Tonks... Sirius... Cedric...
"Probably. And after I was an idiot and it left—the something—I thought it was better, I thought I didn't need it, but... fuck, this is harder than I thought it would be," Harry inhales deeply, forces himself to make more sense. "I talked to Hermione—"
Harry, who has already read that article twice, tips his head back on the sofa and grumbles, "I hate you, Malfoy."
he chides himself, rising steadily to his feet and squinting his eyes against the sunlight coming from the ceiling. Shit, that hurts. He picks up the blanket and walks over to Draco, who is still asleep on the carpet. Carefully covering him with the blanket and mindful not to wake him up—because wouldn't that be awkward—Harry allows himself a moment to openly stare.
"Don't!" Harry calls, but it’s far too late.
Then he sprints. It’s exhilarating in a way, like when he and Hermione had first arrived in Godric’s Hollow during the war, and were completely unaware of what could happen. This time, Harry thinks there are slightly higher stakes.
"I might be a little bit impressed," Draco admits, and Harry grins.
"Cooking, Malfoy. It's one of those strange and primitive arts that we peasants are expert in."
"I didn't steal him, Malfoy," Harry says, sighing. And, really, he hadn’t meant to; Harry just assumed that the poor owl was beaten under the company of Malfoy, or
Harry scoffs, "Necessary for what? You don't need a job. I might've given up reading the
This is what Harry came back for, then. Friends that leave each other as soon as things get difficult.
They stay like that for a few moments, until—
Harry chokes, mind already starting to slow with desire as blood rushes out of his brain and to his cock.
"Beat their arses lads and don't die." Blaise said, smirking at Harry.
"Merlin Potter how do you remember all of this? There's so many steps to everything and you just have to remember it all." The two wizards had been studying in the library for two hours and Harry hadn't realized just how difficult transfiguration was for Draco until now.
"Merlin! Profe- I mean Headmaster are you alright? I-I didn't mean to I swear i just kinda saw you trying to attack him and it just sorta happened and-and bloody hell i'm going to be expelled for this aren't I?" His voice continued to rise in panic and to his horror, Minerva started,
"I have to tell Hermione and Ron! How did I not remeber this before? Ugh!"
"Hey uh Malfoy... I don't really have- maybe I could um, only if you want I gue-"
"I- okay I guess, I didn't even know you could.."
They decided to go straight to the Great Hall and avoid as many people and memories as possible. They were the first students there, of course most of the teachers were already there and chatting away, they all sat down at the Gryffindor table and waited for people to start arriving. Harry cast some protection charms around him and Sidereum to avoid being hexed by startled peers at the fact that there was a giant snake perched on one of their classmates. Soon enough, people started pouring into the Great Hall and now all they were waiting for was the first years so that they could begin the sorting. Once Headmaster Mcgonagall had calmed everyone down and it was finally silent, Hagrid started to lead the first years inside. They were in the same line as always but there were a lot less than usual.
"That's when a wizard and a magical creature share a special sort of bond, I don't remember much of it, Hermione hasn't made me read on them since third year when we thought Sirius Black was a murderer and he was controlling a giant black dog."
"Fine but you owe me treacle tart if he says that one more time."
They sat in a comfortable silence for a while just eating and enjoying each other's company. Eventually, they started talking about how Fred had gotten a position as the new charms professor because Flitwick had retired and that George would now be running Weasley's Wizard Wheezes most of the time and Fred would just be helping him create new pranks and run the store on weekends. He claimed that he took the job because 'we just have to find a way to prank Minnie and we didn't get to do it at school'. They all knew that it was simply because he really did love Charms and was so excited to be able to help smaller children with it. It really was sweet.
He decided to just get changed and look at the stars for a bit longer, he wasn't sure he wanted to deal with the nightmares that always seemed to plague him during the night. It was his first night back at Hogwarts and he wanted it to be at least somewhat happy, he'd just have some coffee the house elves liked to make for him in the morning and deal with the sleepiness during classes. He put on loose fitting flannel pants and a tank top and sat in the window with a pillow supporting his back.
"Of course I can, I'm not doing this just for a place to sit in a classroom genius, I'm doing this because I can and I'd like it if we were friends, well maybe not friends if that's too soon but at least civil people who occasionally keep one another company." Harry hoped that just maybe, Draco would like to be friends with Harry too, he hadn't even known that he'd wanted to be friends until he said it out loud but now he realized that even if Draco wouldn't be friends with him, maybe they could at least not keep trying to ruin each other's lives every other day.
"Uh, well his name is Sidereum and he's my familiar I guess." Harry was really hoping that Malfoy would turn up soon and he could escape the whole conversation under the pretense of class. And to his relief, that is exactly what happened.
Draco had managed to keep away the fact that his signature phrases were a school wide joke but that didn't stop Harry constantly spying on Draco and picking up on it all by himself.
Draco had initially thought that Harry had only left for a minute but he hadn't returned even after Mcgonagall had announced that there was a new wing in the castle for the eight years and houses would be mixed to promote inter-house unity. After he didn't show up within the first couple hours that everyone had settled into the dormitories and Harry still hadn't shown up Draco decided to go looking for him. He wasn't sure why but he convinced himself it was just because he didn't want to loose house points on the first day because Potter was out of bed but in reality, he just had so many questions for Harry and he hoped he might just answer them without him having to ask. The first of which being why the hell Potter was in Slytherin all of a sudden, this sort of thing had never happened but of course the git couldn't go one year at Hogwarts without causing a scene. Rather grudgingly he started walking through the castle checking classrooms and empty hallways to no avail. After an hour of searching, Draco sat down at the lake waiting for a reply from Pansy as to whether or not Potter had shown up. When the reply came and Harry was still no where to be seen, Draco decided to cast a tracking spell but while he was trying to remember what the wand movement was, he heard
They were reviewing the process for a particularly complicated spell and Draco had attempted it too early and his goblet turned into a meowing bowl instead of a kneazle.
"Harry Potter has caught the snitch! Slytherin has won 240 to 50" Theseus bellowed, sounding very excited but you could tell it was at least a little bit forced.
He had been deep in thought and hadn't seen the sun rising and didn't realize he was late until Malfoy shrieked.
2. Do you guys want any smut or just fluff?
Harry was a bit nervous about not having classes with Ron and Hermione anymore so he asked, well more accurately, stumbled over words for what felt like forever before Malfoy put him out of his misery and laughed while he told him it was fine if Harry sat with him so long as he helped him because Draco was absolute rubbish at the subject.
He noticed Potter's snake handing him something he figured it had been holding in it's tail and then he held it out to Draco. They didn't stop walking but Potter said something Draco didn't actually hear most of and he could only manage a nod because he was too busy choking back the tears in his eyes. He held his hand and he could feel the wand,
Harry chuckled at Sidereum's offense.
Without thinking it through at all, he swung Draco around against the wall and smashed his lips on the blond's. He started panicking and started to pull away but then, Draco deepened the kiss and pulled him back in by the waist. After what seemed like forever and no time at all, they finally broke apart for air. They both just stared at each other with awe for a while not quite knowing what to say.
They had decided to get their books for the school year first and then get quills and an unreasonable amount of sweets to stash in their dormitories for the year. Harry had brought up going to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and all of a sudden they were in front of the shop. There seemed to be more decorations than they had ever seen before but Harry figured it was to cheer up as many people as possible from after the war and it also seemed to have worked. Harry walked in and there were more people than he had ever seen in any shop. He was baffled to say the least, this was probably everyone who was going to Hogwarts next year and more including
Harry slowly guided his broom down to the ground while looking at the cheering crowd around him. It was always the highlight of any year when he heard the yelling and screaming that were there because of he had caught the snitch. There also seemed to be something else they were cheering for though. Harry looked up to the stands and there was a giant magically projected jumbo-tron displaying the words 'Kiss Cam' on it. It was showing a live stream of Luna and Ginny who had sat next to each other in the Ravenclaw section. Ginny went pale as a ghost but Luna didn't hesitate to lean over and plant a kiss on her. They broke apart after a couple of seconds and Ginny was smiling so wide Harry could have sworn her face would split in half. Harry touched down a few seconds later and was immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic Hermione and Draco.
"I'm sorry, for everything. For bullying you and your friends for years. For being too much of a coward to leave my good for nothing father to deal with his own mistakes and for being on the wrong side of the war. While I'm not saying what I did was right, I hope that you can understand that I only acted out of fear for my own and my mother's life and even though that is the case, I do still regret my decisions. I also never got the chance to thank you for speaking up at my mother's and my own trial, it meant a lot that even after everything I did, you still defended me," That was probably the most heartfelt apology he had ever heard and he was a bit confused. Draco had been running his fingers through his hair the whole time looking very nervous about it all but his voice was as steady as ever.
Harry sat in his room for a couple hours bringing up random conversation topics and exploring the mental bond between the two and Sidereum refused to detangle himself from Harry. He had tried to convince him to for a couple hours but gave up eventually seeing that he wasn't going to change his mind. A thought crossed his mind and he immediately shot up frustrated at himself for not doing this earlier.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had been hovering for a while and Slytherin was up 70 to 20. His eyes had been scanning the pitch for thirty minutes and he was beginning to get a bit bored, he decided he was going to spice things up a bit. He shot straight into a nose dive going headfirst into the ground as fast as he could and made sure Jared was following him closely, he then leveled out his broom at the last second while Jared rammed into the ground. The Wronski Feint as many people called it, he had been doing it since he first got on a broom though and while many people considered it to be one of the most difficult moves in Quidditch history, it was Harry's favourite and most used move as it was easiest for him.
Sidereum handed over the wand from where he had coiled his tail around it and Harry held it out to Malfoy.
Malfoy was standing in the middle of the shop examining a light leaf. Harry couldn't really remember but that one was a product to help with nightmares for war survivors, he should really look into getting one of those. But more surprising than that, Malfoy's hair was electric blue and he was wearing jeans and a muggle band t-shirt. He was staring at him for what was definitely too long because his friends had left to explore the new products and Malfoy had started walking over to him.
“It’s fine, Kitten. One of the goblins that can sense Magic was pointing at my scar,” I try to reassure him, but he frowns, looking like he’s trying to think through the haze of sleep. I leave him to it and follow the goblins.
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
I stare into Theo’s eyes, pushing the plan I decide on out from behind my mental shield. He’s the only other Legilimens in my year, and he seems to understand what I want him to do. I can feel him enter my mind and look at my idea. He nods subtly, and I stand up, my bland Pureblood Mask falling into place.
“That's what I thought,” he says, surprising me by hugging me gently.
At some point I must have fallen asleep, because the next thing I know Harry is shaking me awake.
All conversation stops in the Great Hall. I look up. Draco Malfoy has fluffy white cat ears and a tail. It makes him even cuter. I can tell the exact moment when he notices everyone is staring at him. His eyes widen slightly and he glances around himself discreetly. That's when he notices his tail. His eyes widen further in panic and his ears flatten against his head. A tingly feeling washes over me when we make eye contact. His face turns angry and he storms over to the Slytherin table, whispering furiously at Parkinson.
She shakes her head, and Harry sighs. “Well, we may as well get up now. Missy!”
He steps out of the portrait hole and once he is gone I pull out his wand to look at it more closely. It seems to be about 14 inches long, and made of willow. I notice it is starting to break, so I take out my wand and repair it silently. Ron comes back in and I tuck it back into my pocket.
He then leads me to another door I hadn't noticed before.
I nod and sit on a couch in front of the table, doing as he instructed. As flowy writing appears in suspiciously bright red ink. Draco and the others gather around, and Draco grabs hold of my hand again.
The door to the Slytherin Common room closes behind Draco before I can get to him.
Ron sneers. I growl, and he jumps slightly, giving me a funny look. He almost trips standing up to get away from me, muttering “Freak,” under his breath. Draco snarls quietly and I hug him tighter.
I glance around my dorm and notice the letter from Father on my bedside table. Fuck! If Harry read that, I’m screwed. I stumble out of bed and go over to inspect it. I notice another note beside the one from Father with my name on it. I open it.
I nod slightly. He pulls back to smile at me and I glow. “Will you eat with me at dinner?”
Harry begins to talk with the goblins, and Jadeheart tells him the diary was a Horcrux. I don't pay much attention after that, they are mostly barginaning and working out the details.
“Also, some of your other abilities come from being a Neko, such as your natural Occlumency and Legilimency, Wandless magics, and your Allspeak, but the Parseltongue was enhanced by Tom’s Horcruxe, and Parselmagics was also because of the Horcruxe, but you will still have those even though we removed it.”
“Mr Potter, what happened was not your fault. No one could have known what would happen. It is an honour, in our Nation, to die in battle, as we are, ultimately, a warrior race. They will be buried as heroes, even more so as they were defending Gringotts,” Stoneye cuts me off, his tone softer than I’ve ever heard it before.
Madre de Aguas is a cuban legend, it’s pretty cool, and I made up the Portalsnake. It has no relation to the game, which I found when I looked up Portalsnake.
Madam Pince shushes him angrily and he winces. “Sorry!”
“Sorry… Greater Good, he said...”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please?”
” she hisses, sounding disgruntled.
I frown. “A Neko?”
Grinning, Lily grabs their hands, and the two Mates watch as the train leaves the station, taking another of their children off for their first day of Hogwarts. Draco sniffs, then they apparate away.
” she hisses, and before he can react, she strikes, sinking her fangs deep into his neck. He falls to the ground with a strangled cry and Nagini lets go and slithers off of him and over to the Malachite.
I turn to Stoneye. “Do you say rest in peace, when a warrior has fallen, as we do with our dead?”
(See the end of the chapter for
” she asks
Ron laughs.
“I think you have something to tell me, hmm Draco?”
“Your Father-” I start to say, but he flinches. “Lucius is unconscious. He can't hurt you any more, and you’ll never be anywhere near him again, if I have anything to do with it.”
“Aww!” she says quietly.
I move back up to his lips, kissing him harder. I grab his hair, tilting his head back a bit to get a better angle. We spend the rest of the period in the closet, talking and snogging. Well mostly snogging actually. At some point I asked him out.
He’s close now, I can feel it. I follow the feeling of panic at the back of my mind, feeling it get stronger as I get closer. It leads me to a locked door.
“It’s beautiful, Harry. Thank you,” he whispers, putting it on.
Drarry and Pansy do some matchmaking.
“Answer me Draco. And do not lie again.”
The goblin sighs. “What do you need done?”
I settle in a corner with some books on Creature Inheritances, glancing up to study the blonde boy occasionally. I eventually find what I am looking for in the ‘Mates’ section. He must be a Submissive then, because I am exhibiting the reactions of a Dominant who has recently found their Mate. I am oddly excited about the prospect. I also learn that Submissives only let their Dominant touch their ears or tail, so I can tell if I am for sure that way.
!’ I think desperately.
“Albus… ” I whisper, “Albus… ”
Well, if you wanna get specific, I actually said “Ron, we’re dating now, kay?” then went back to snogging him.
“Mr Malfoy, if you could join me in the hallway please?” He prompts when I don’t move. I glance desperately at my friends.
The song is in italics because it is a song, and because it was in the other chapter. It is not a thought, nor is it sung through the mind bond.
“Sorry girl, I’ll bring you some treats later, alright?” I murmur, and she flies back out through the window. I read Remus’s response, and frown.
He takes a step closer and I step back, hitting the wall.
When we get to the Manor Mr. Malfoy practically runs away from the car as fast as he can. Narcissa sends me to get settled in and then Draco and I cuddle for the rest of the evening.
“Collect them in a vessel, I think.”
“We have History in ten minutes.”
He has to go. I lean against his bookshelf, making sure to choose the most shadowed spot, before making sure my shields are secure. I begin planning, listening to the conversation with one ear, although I make sure to appear to zone out.
Albus tried to drive them apart, so that's a no-go, and as Severus didn't die, he decided not to tell Harry what happened, but they don't actively antagonise each other, having reached a tentative truce for Draco.
“So? That was their goal, and plus, Draco and Harry snog all the time,” I reassure him.
“Albus… Why… ” Halfway there.
Scorpius shrugs, ruffling Lily’s wild red hair. “She was excited, may as well get you up, I thought.”
“I have told you to call me Mr. Potter, Headmaster. I’m here because Lady Malfoy has requested that either she or I be present if you are to speak to Mr. Malfoy, If you recall,” I tell him as politely as I can.
cute when he sleeps. Looks kinda like a kitten,” I laugh off her embarrassment. She grins at me.
I snore through History of Magic, then we return to the Common Room for our free period. I lead us up to Ron and my dorm and we all sit down. I take a deep breath.
“I won't kiss you, Malfoy.”
“So sorry”
He sighs. “Well, there goes our light.”
“Hello,”
At least I hoped it was obvious. Ron could be a bit oblivious. We continue like this for a bit before he finally asks the question I started the game for.
The flowy writing appears slowly on the page and Draco leans forward impatiently.
“Ar’anna!” he cries out. I slip his wand out of his pocket, make sure he has his Butterbeer clenched in his hand, and push him over the edge. He gives a shout of surprise, before landing on the ground, hard.
I hand him the pouch, watching his face as he opens it. Inside is a silver ring shaped like a snake eating its tail, with emerald eyes.
We hang out in the common room until it’s almost curfew, and then I let Ron up off my lap, wondering how long it will take for him to realize I still have his wand.
Dinner is a slightly uncomfortable affair, what with Mr. Malfoy having been a Death Eater, even if he is not now that Mouldy Voldy has returned.
Sorry about the short chapter, but it felt like a good place to end it.
“All Creatures have a predestined Mate, someone chosen specifically for them by Lady Magic, and rejecting them means certain Death for both parties involved. You likely have Gaunt and  Riddle in your Lordships because you defeated someone from those lines that didn't have an heir. You have Death because you had all three Deathly Hallows in your possession at some point, and since you are descended from the Pervell line you have become Master of Death. You are Regent because the Le Fey is only a Ladyship, so it can only be claimed by a female descendant. I don’t know much about Mrs. Longbottom being your Godmother other than that it was legally declared at Gringotts. Unpresented means Master Malfoy has not come into his inheritance yet. Being a Submissive means that your partner cares for and comforts you. Dominants are usually very overprotective of their Mate, as their Creature demands that they make sure that their Mate is happy and safe, and you can get a Cleansing, but you will have to pay for it.”
We run into Draco in the hallway between classes and Ron immediately starts to hassle him about being a Neko. I can't bring myself to join in, I want to protect my Draco. I keep on calling him ‘my Draco’ in my head, and I don't know why. Now I want to protect him. Something weird is happening.
I slip in, my attention instantly drawn to my Mate, who’s thrashing around on the floor and screaming hoarsely with Lucius Malfoy standing over him, grinning, with his wand trained on him.
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Then she heads over to Lucius, giving him a quick once-over for serious injuries. “He should be fine, I’ll keep him unconscious for now though, he’s much less annoying when he’s that way.”
I stop, remembering something important.
“I have some questions, if you don't mind,” I say, leaning into Draco for support.
I spend the rest of the period doing my homework, then we head down to the Great Hall and take a seat at our usual spot. Ron seems to have forgotten about Draco being my Mate. I zone out.
After another round of hugs he too boards the train.
I frown. He never uses my first name.
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
“Hey Baby, it’s time to go,” he murmurs softly. I grumble sleepily and snuggle farther into his shoulder, making him laugh.
Soon the peacock that I was talking to comes back with a much larger one, introducing him as Pearl. We converse for a bit and I learn that they chased Draco because they get bored, Pearl is the ‘leader’, and they are magical, descended from a regular peacock and a Diricawl, which is a bird that muggles called a Dodo. They are almost all peacock, with only enough Diricawl in them to be able to disappear and reappear like one.
“B-but, F-father said...” he trails off, and I can see the fear in his eyes.
“I had the goblins put protective charms on it, it’ll also portkey you to me if you are badly hurt or use the activation word, which is Adiona, the Roman goddess of safe return. No one but you or I will be able to take it off,” I add.
(See the end of the chapter for
She heads off to their next class, Transfiguration, to explain to Professor McGonagall that Harry and Draco would be late, due to an unfortunate and entirely random mistletoe incident. She could have sworn that McGonagall was hiding a smile.
“After a
That’s right, dear readers, the once great Albus Dumbledore was found dead this morning by a third year Herbology class on their way to Greenhouse 4. He was laying on the ground by the Astronomy Tower, and a smashed Butterbeer bottle was found clenched in his hand. I think we all know what has happened here. His wand was found on the stairs leading to the Tower. Aurors were called by Professor Pomona Sprout, whom Anthony Rickett quickly ran to get. The Aurors inspected the body and declared it an accident. They think he tripped on the Astronomy Tower, as he was clearly drunk, and he would have had no way to catch himself without his wand, which had probably fallen out of his pocket. A painter has been commissioned to make a portrait for him, which will be hung in the Headmaster’s office. Interestingly, there was a review scheduled for Thursday, which was to discuss the fact that he had, infact, for the majority of the past two weeks wandered around in a drunken haze. Make of that what you will, dear readers. You can find the official Death Certificate on page 8.
I take a deep breath and nod. “Would- would we be allowed to come to their funeral, Stoneye?”
Everyone is silent. Harry coughs awkwardly, breaking the spell.
“Good,” I say as Griphook leads us back to the Lobby.
“It’s fine, my dear, I only need to speak to him for a moment, then he can rejoin class,” he presses, a grandfatherly twinkle in his eyes.
I have no problem getting the house elves to start serving him Butterbeer every dinner, and to up the actual amount of alcohol in it. This will hopefully get him drunk at least a few times before I put my plan into action, so it won't be as suspicious, and it’ll have the added benefit of giving him hangovers.
“Can we kiss and get it over with, Potter?” he asks impatiently. “I have classes to attend, you know.”
They have to be at the Dursly's because the Malfoys are going on a trip.
“Well, the diary possessed Ginny and brought her into the Chamber, so Weasley and I made Lockhart come with us to rescue him. Lockhart tried to obliviate us, he was gonna say we tragically lost our minds when we saw Ginny’s dead body, he’d bring back some of the shed skin and say he killed it. The wand backfired, it’d been broken for awhile then, and he accidentally obliviated himself and caused a cave-in. Him and Weasley were trapped, so I went on ahead.
Amazonite is believed to have a soothing and calming effect. It accomplishes this by dispelling negative energy and allowing us to let go of sadness and grief.
You were only waiting for this moment to arise”
Please, I can spot his manipulations a mile away. It’s in Harry’s best interest, Draco. You can protect yourself, Draco. Voldemort must be stopped, Draco. I’m in Slytherin for a reason, and I trust that the other Slytherins, if not the ‘Puffs, will be able to tell too, which means the whole house will know within the hour, and the rest of the student population by breakfast tomorrow, if Theo did his job right.
“Prolonged exposure to the Cruciatus Curse for Draco, and I blasted his Father, who’s unconscious over in that bed, into the wall,” I reply, pointing out the elder Malfoy.
“She’s an empath,” Harry explains, seeing Ron’s confusion.
Another Goblin enters, and I realize it’s a female. “Hello, I’m Jadeheart. You want to unite his Horcruxes and kill him, correct?”
“Why, Sweetie?”
Harry and I spend the night in the ROR, after he sends Hedwig off with a letter. He doesn't let me out of his sight for the whole evening, probably feeling extra protective after what happened, and when it’s time for bed he hauls me on top of him and wraps his arms securely around my waist. I smile and cuddle into his neck, falling asleep to the soothing rise and fall of his chest.
“Ron,” I warn. Ron sighs and stops struggling. Harry snickers.
I nod, turning back to the dead goblins. “I wish you both the best of luck in your next life, Noble Warriors. May you vaults overflow and your enemies bleed out at your feet.”
“Cursebreaker Stoneye, Misters Potter and Malfoy are here,” the goblin announces before leaving.
He shakes his head. “We wish them luck in the next life, then say the traditional farewell.”
” he hisses, but she keeps moving towards him.
Harry thinks. He is panicking. He knows has to slow his breathing down, he is going to hyperventilate, but he just can't, and his throat is closing up. His chest is too tight and he is shaking. He realises that his head is in his hands and Draco is looking at him. He seems concerned, but he couldn't be. He hated Harry. He digs his nails into his skin, trying to ground himself.
We hang around for another hour or so, then the potion is done. I find out that they plan to get Theo and Hermione together. They bottle it up and Pansy picks up the vials they plan to use, putting her empath magic into them. Then we head off to supper and Pansy slips the potion into their drinks.
In case anyone's confused, Scorpius Draconis Potter looks like Draco did, except for green eyes like Harry's, James Sirius Potter looks like Harry did when he was younger except for the grey eyes characteristic of the Malfoy family, and Lily Remus Potter Looks like Harry's mum but with bright blue cobalt eyes.
Suddenly there is light, which altogether ruins the ‘small-closet-perfect-for-snogging-in’ vibe. I silently and wandlessly dim the light until it's almost as dark as before, slowly, so he thinks the spell is failing.
He growls slightly. “Do not lie to me.”
My reasoning for the names:
The looks Draco gives me make me feel guilty, but I still don't do anything. When he eventually starts to fight back he keeps on glancing over at me, as if checking if it’s okay to defend himself. How odd. I eventually get Ron to move on, but I can't stop thinking.
I stumble out of the Floo and Draco catches me, making me realise I am still holding his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello, Father,” I reply in the same formal manner.
I look up to see Draco leaving so I put my books away and follow him out of the Library. Once we get to a corridor that is rarely used I come up behind him and touch his shoulder making him whip around, opening his mouth to yell at me. When he sees it’s me he closes his mouth and looks away.
I refrain from rolling my eyes. Everyone knows snakes are not slimy.
“No, Mr Potter. No non goblin has ever witnessed one before, but you may pay your respects to their bodies before they are taken to be readied for it, if you’d like,” he offers.
It shrugs.

“No need to be embarrassed baby,” I tell him.

Hermione gasps. “Malfoy’s a Neko? That is so rare!”
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
” I ask suspiciously.

…’ I say, more persistent, closer to his skin this time.
Griphook nods and leads us to a room just off the lobby. He hands me a silver knife and places a piece of parchment on the table in front of me, explaining that I need to make a cut on my left ring finger and let five drops of blood land in the parchment, then the cut will heal itself.
I sit Ron in my lap as we eat, and he tries to move off, but he doesn't put much effort into it. I tighten my hold and he stops trying.
“Oh! No, no, we aren’t looking to make one, we want to know if there is a way to kill one,” Harry rushes to explain.
(See the end of the chapter for
We end up back in Stoneye’s office, and the new goblin starts conversing loudly with him and Jadeheart, who hadn’t left yet. I sit back down and remove the Feather-Light Charm, adjusting Draco on my lap.
I cast a Featherlight Charm on him and carry him, bridal style, to the Hospital Wing, levitating Lucius’s unconscious form ahead of me none too gently. I send Lucius over to thump down roughly on a bed in the corner farthest from my Mate, whom I arrange gently on his own bed. By the time Madam Pomfrey arrives I’m curled protectively around Draco, who is sleeping quietly.
Four more goblins appear, chanting what sounds like the same chant as the one they used on me. One by one, black glowing orbs, some smaller than others, all of them looking chipped and cracked, but glowing and mesmerising nonetheless, float out of their vessels and into the Malachite in the order that they arrived.
I jump, startled.
Sorry for the wait, I wrote the epilouge first then Purple_Timmer_19, my editor, decided that I wasn't quite done and that Draco should meet the Durslys.
“Of course, Kitten. Always.”
This is what happens with 'Mione and Theo.
“Oh! I didn't realize you were awake!” she whispers, blushing.
Ron and I are walking down the hall and complaining about our charms homework when we suddenly lose our wands. I understand what is happening immediately. They are trying to get us to date. Not that I’m complaining.
“A bit”
“Guys, it’s barely eight!”
“Do you like anyone?”
“He what, Kitten?” Harry prompts me gently.
“We will relocate to an empty classroom, thank you Headmaster,” Father tells him, then he leads me out of the Headmaster’s office and into a classroom around the corner. He puts up silencing wards and locks the door before advancing on me.
Submissive! Well, what do you have to say for yourself?”
” By this time she has wrapped herself around his shoulders.
“Harry gave me my voice back!” he? she? it? tells me happily.
“for him really,”
He grins. “I’m glad. We’d better get going if we don't want to be late to class.”
“Yeah, but Draco is my Mate,” he explains, like it’s obvious.
He nods and I sit down, pulling Ron into my lap and wrapping an arm around his waist.
Harry was on his way to Transfiguration, and Draco shoved him lightly with his shoulder as usual before walking away. Trying to walk away. He only made it a couple of steps before they were both tugged back together. Harry looked up. A mistletoe hovered above their heads, most likely enchanted. He glanced over at Draco, who scowled at him. Harry hugged his books tighter to his chest and tried to leave again.
Stoneye views the memory. “And you think this ‘Tom Riddle’ has made a Horcrux?”
before he falls asleep. When I notice I gently shift him off me and tuck him in. I leave the letter from his Father on his table, along with a note to let him know I went back to my dorm and reassure him I didn't read his letter. If he wants to share that’s great, but I won't pry.
Also, fun fact, It’s my birthstone.
,” she hisses helpfully.
I stare blankly at the blackboard, my mind drifting to my Mate as Binns drones on about some goblin rebellion or another. Honestly, all the ghost teaches are goblin rebellions! There’s a knock on the door and the class, almost as one, perks up and their heads swivel around, desperate for any break from the monotony of the lesson. The professor blinks slowly, like he’s coming out of a daze.
I open my mouth to argue, but Hermione mouths ‘
Draco?” Father asks dangerously. “Did you have
Draco had to wait outside, so he didn't disrupt the energy flow of the ritual. I lay down and the goblins, four of them, standing at the points of the compass with me in the middle, start to chant in a language I have never heard before.
A nod.
“Yes, Angel?”
“I’m here, it’ll be alright,” I continue to whisper to him.
We just have the epilouge left now! this ended up being a lot longer than I had originally planned, but the comments inspired me!
Disgust flashes across Stoneye’s face, and his eyes widen in understanding. “So you wish to make him mortal again?”
It furrows it's brow, then grins, leaping aside. I lead Draco inside and we ride the stairs up, knocking on the door at the top. He calls out for us to enter, frowning when he sees me. “Harry, my boy, what are you doing here?”
He has me change into all white robes and lay on a smooth sheet of marble with purple veins running through it. When I ask about it he tells me that the purple is Amethyst, as they are an incredibly protective, healing, and purifying gemstone, so it is best to use them in cleansing ceremonies.
Thanks to my editor, Purple_Timmer_19. If you like Percy Jackson, she writes that.
This is how we are snogging a while later when Pansy, Draco and Harry open the door to the closet.  Ron blushes furiously and tries to get up out of my lap, but I hold on to his hips tightly.
“Can you let me in if I give you the password?”
She sighs when she sees my confusion. “A Creature Inheritance is when someone has creature blood, and so they develop traits of those creatures, and before you ask, the books don't say how you end up with Creature Blood in the first place.”
“Master Griphook. May the blood of your enemies flow as freely as the gold in your coffers,” I tell him, the standard goblin greeting.
He tells me that if I am in danger all I need to do is speak an incantation in Parseltongue and the snakes will grow to the size that is needed and attack, then shrink back and return to a ring once I am safe. I kiss him softly then we go to bed, and I fall asleep almost right away.
“Truth or Truth.”
“Ar’anna? Is that you?” he mumbles, stumbling in my direction.
Into the light of a dark black night
“I wish to speak to my son alone, Headmaster.” I feel a spike of fear. I know what alone means, alone means punishment and silencing wards and pain, pain, pain.
“I’ll pick Truth.”
I spin around and see Draco hesitantly making his way over to our table. I smile encouragingly at him and he walks a bit faster towards me. He goes to sit in the space Hermione made between us, but Ron interrupts. “What do you think you're doing at Gryffindor, you slimy snake?”
Like, the whole chapter. Don't like don't read.
He sighs, heaving himself dramatically off me to get dressed with clothes the Room so kindly provides us. When we are both dressed we sit on the bed and I pull him into my lap.
“I know you hate me, but we can't stay here forever,”
“Blackbird singing in the dead of night
“I’m sorry,” He whispers, looking at me with wide, fearful eyes full of tears.
“Good job, cousin,” she says to me, then absently mumbles to herself, “Bumblebees can only sting once, then they fly away and die,” before going back to her plate. I just smile at her.
Uggg, I hate the title, but I have no ideas for it.
I yelp and clutch his shoulder when he stands up, arranging me on his hip. I can feel him cast a silent wandless Feather-Light Charm, his magic tingling around me. A goblin leads us back through the winding hallways of the bank, and just when I’ve almost fallen back to sleep I hear a goblin shriek something in Gobbledygook, and we turn back around.
I start to run, I need to get back to my dorms before I have a panic attack. I shouldn't even be having one, Father says only the weak do, but I can't make it stop. If someone sees me, they’ll tell their friends, and it’ll reach my Father. I don't want to make my punishment worse.
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
“Harry…?” I ask tentatively as we cuddle in the Room of Requirement.
“Daddy, Papa, wake up!” Their nine year old daughter shrieks, her striking cobalt blue eyes shining excitedly.
I have to find my Mate. I stand up and rush out of the library, calling out an excuse as I go. Hermione doesn't follow me. I come to a stop just outside the door. I have no idea where to go, I only know my Mate is in danger. I shift desperately. I don't want to go in the wrong direction and take longer to reach my Mate. Suddenly a door appears in the wall beside me. I hesitantly touch the handle.
“What happened Harry?” asks Draco, concerned.
He can hear Draco, as if from a distance, but he can't tell what he is saying. Draco wraps his arms around Harry, who stiffens at first, then leans into him, grateful for the comfort.
Malachite
They go to Gringotts for an inheritance test and learn some interesting things.
He didn't have much hope that it would work but he had to try. He couldn't kiss Draco. He would give himself away, and then Draco would know how much he liked him. He is pulled back towards the other boy immediately, who frowns at him. Doing his best to ignore him Harry moves as far away from Draco as possible and leans against the wall, opening his books to try to do his homework.
Note to self: My Italian accent turns him on.
Please read the tags, they’ve been updated.
“Why did you leave me… Albus...” I can see the stairs.
I feel a wave of protectiveness, a need to protect my Draco. Wait.
“Okay, first of all, Mate? Also, How did I end up with Gaunt, Riddle, and Death in my Lordships? What does it mean that I’m a regent for LeFey? Alice is my Godmother? What does unpresented mean? What is Submissive and Dominant? And is there any way to get the Blocks and Love Potion removed?”
“Hello Draco.”
I still don't reply, though my instincts are screaming at me to answer him. He growls, louder and more aggressively this time, and I tilt my head, showing my neck in submission.
I move my hands up his sides and over his ribs, then over his back, cupping his cheek. He leans back slightly and I kiss along his jaw and down his neck.
He looks at me funny and I smirk. When he tries to stand up I grab his hips, holding him down firmly.
“Potter,” I greet him, my mind working quickly. Why is he here?
He hums slightly. “You think old Voldie made one?”
He just turns an even brighter shade of red. I decide to stop teasing him, so I lean in slowly, maintaining eye contact the whole time.
I shiver, my inner Sub preening at the attention.
She conjures a mistletoe charmed to keep them from leaving until they kiss, and she melts back into the crowd with a satisfied smile.
“I- I’m a Horcrux?” I rasp out. Am I gonna have to die to kill it? Will Draco die if I do? Mates dies if they’re rejected, right, so is it the same deal if one dies? If he lives, who will protect him?
I make sure they don’t need any help, then they shoo me away insistently, handing us off to a messenger goblin.
“Draco is supposed to have his Mate or Guardian with him if you want to talk to him about something, Headmaster,” Pansy reminds him politely. It is always best to be polite with someone as powerful as Dumbledore, he is quite capable of making someone’s life very difficult.
” she explains.
Draco leans up to kiss me and I can feel him smiling against my mouth. I reluctantly pull away and we get ready for the day. I pull Draco close to my side as we exit the Room, wrapping an arm tightly around his waist. We enter the Great Hall and the Headmaster looks up and frowns at Draco, who ducks his head and presses himself closer to me. I glare at the meddlesome fool. We take our usual seats in between the twins and Neville, across from Dean, Seamus and Hermione. I get one plate for both Draco and I, alternating between feeding him and eating. I make sure to make eye contact for the first few minutes, which I can tell pisses the man off. No one will get between my Mate and I, I don't care what I have to do.
” I put a rush of power into it and the door clicks open.
I grin at him and pack up my things. We head up to the Headmaster’s office, and Harry gives the Gargoyle the password, “Chocolate Frogs.”
“N-no.”
“Draco,” He says, warning clear in his voice.
I followed him because he looked like he was on the verge of a panic attack, and I was right. I find him curled up in the corner farthest from the door, rocking back and forth and whimpering. It breaks my heart to see my beautiful Mate like this.
In case you didn't make the connection Lily is descended from Morgana Le Fey.
I stand up and grab his hand, interlacing our fingers.
“It’ll be okay, I’ll keep you safe, I’m here,” he murmurs soothingly, rocking me gently.
Another nod.
I look to Draco as to what exactly we are doing here.
“But, F-f-father, he...” I start, stuttering too badly to get the words out.
The peacock calls Draco Vulture Boy because of his Veela, and also because Peacocks see themselves as more graceful and majestic than all other birds and mammals.
Harry shakes his head, not looking up from his books. Draco stands up and moves closer to him.
“Be careful Kitten. Those things are bloody vicious!”
Harry decides it's a good idea to rummage around in the Headmaster's office, and it's a good thing he did. Anything to protect his Draco, though.
He stops midway, looking like he might actually leave, but I pull him into my lap before he can, hugging him protectively.  “No. He is my mate. Mine.”
” Nagini complains from her heated rock in the corner of the room. James grins and goes over to pet her. “
“A Neko is basically a person who has cat ears and a tail, a cat’s senses and some cat instincts, as well as a predestined Mate,” She tells me. “Nekos are super rare, the rarest of all Creature Inheritances.”
“I need to know more about Horcruxes.” The goblin’s eyes go wide. “I’m sorry, we do not assist in the making of those, you will need to look elsewhere. Good day.”
Sorry, it's kinda short!
“Answer me!” he glares at me for a moment. “So you won't tell me? You did have a panic attack! And you know what? He only helped you so you wouldn't embarrass him! He. Does. Not. Care!
Hermione sees the way Harry watches Draco. And she sees the way Draco watches Harry. It frustrates her to no end, both their refusal to admit they like each other and their density. It is clear she needs to do something. She comes up with a plan, and she waits. Then one day when they brush past each other in a crowded hall, she acts.
I scream and thrash. I know it won't end for a while, so I concentrate on not banging my head on the ground. Father cancels the spell sooner than usual. “You think that he loves you? You think he wants you? You're nothing more than a pretty face for him to show off. He doesn't care about you and he never will!” he spits at me.
“Goodbye Master Griphook! May the blood of your enemies flow as freely as the gold in your coffers!” I bow to him and we step through the Floo.
I’m left gaping.
Pansy enjoys Matchmaking so much because she is an empath and she can feel their happiness when she succeeds.
I make no move to stop them, even though I could have, even without my wand. If Pansy is involved, which is guaranteed, that means Ron likes me back.
It takes me three times through the song for Draco to stop shaking and strat to even out his breathing, and another two for him to calm down enough to look at me.
First a ring with a black stone appears, then a locket engraved with a snake in the shape of an S, then a goblet, next is a crown sort of thing, then Voldemort’s huge snake, Nagini, who immediately strikes at the barrier, bouncing off.
” I ask it.
She basically wrote this chapter too.
I stay where I am and I can hear him trying (and failing,) to keep his breathing even. I celebrate silently. Then I slowly move back just enough that I can see his face. It is bright red. Victory! I love it when he blushes. I smirk and run my thumb over his blush, my hand cupping his jaw.
“Mr. Malfoy, I need to speak to you about Harry,” he begins once the door is closed.
Hedwig wakes me, flying in through a window I had the room create last night. I take the letter and pouch from her, careful not to wake Draco who at some point last night had wrapped himself around me like a koala, and give her a few pets.
I try to tug it away halfheartedly, but stop when he just tightens his hold and tugs me closer. I lean into him without a fight. Pansy coos at us and Draco glares at her.
Draco joins me. “Thank you, you may have saved my Mate’s life with your bravery, and in extension mine. I wish you both the best of luck in your next life, Noble Warriors. May you vaults overflow and your enemies bleed out at your feet.”
“Lay on the stone,” a goblin dressed in white ritual robes instructs, gesturing to a thin slab of Amazonite. Beside it there is a small square green gem I’m told is Malachite, which the soul fragments will be summoned to.
I’m following him under the cloak, I’m going to have to set the last piece of my plan in action tonight, before he can be fired. I follow him until I’m sure we’re alone, then change my voice wandlessly to mimic Arianna and run ahead.
“We will be proud of you, no matter what house you end up in, and remember to write us often, alright?” Harry reassures him, and he nods.
“And why would you need to know this, Mr. Potter?”
"September 1st! A beautiful day, I hope to never see you again boy! Pack up your things, you better be gone in the next hour." Vernon screamed from the kitchen. He always got excited on the day Harry left.
He decided to actually shower and get changed into his school robes but Malfoy still wasn't back so he figured it would be a good time to start carving himself a paperweight for a wand. He conjured a knife and started widdling, it didn't look quite the same as his real wand but that was probably just because he was used to looking at it more often than anything else. The only other people who would be able to tell it wasn't his wand were Ron and Hermione and they already knew he wouldn't be permitted to use his wand in glasses. He was just about done when who he assumed was the Ravenclaw he would be rooming with walked in.
"Harry, sometimes you really do baffle me. I only made you read about the entire library at Hogwarts and you still haven't figured it out. These specific snakes are not black, once they bond with you they turn the color of whatever you love most in the world, and I'm assuming you can't see because you're blind as a bat even with your glasses but he has white dots all over his scales. I couldn't tell you for sure but it looks a bit like the night sky." Hermione managed to get through her whole speech with no real insults but of course Harry still acted mock offended.
He laughed when Draco popped into his head, 'Draco' he thinks ' a bloody snake shows up in my room and my brain compares it to my childhood rival'. He slightly relaxed at this but didn't have much time to process what the snake had said before he curled in on himself at the sound of Vernon Dursley's footsteps marching up to his room to investigate what all the racket was about. Harry hadn't remembered to warn his uncle about his odd new friend before his uncle could make it through the door.
"Let the feast begin!" Mcgonagall yelled above the pandemonium and all hope at regaining the crowds attention was gone after that.
The entire class heard and most of them burst into laughter but Malfoy just turned crimson red and gave Harry a look that told him he knew exactly what Harry was doing. Harry decided to act like nothing out of the ordinary had happened though and just fixed the spill and finished up his essay, trying ridiculously hard not to stare at Malfoy. Not that that was something he had to prevent himself from doing often.Satisfied with the amount of embarrassment he had caused Malfoy, he just left class intending on going up to his dorm and get a head start on his homework so that Hermione wouldn't pester him after arithmancy. However, Draco had different plans.
"Move off of your bed slowly Harry, there's a Venenata snake on you're bed. How did it even get in here I swear I closed the win-"
"Eloquent as always Potter, although my reasons for my appearance are none of your business." His words had an edge to them but something in his eyes made Harry think that he wasn't trying to be rude, just not quite used to sharing personal details with other people yet. Not that Harry had done anything to deserve that, they had been rivals for seven years after all.
"Aw but you're so cute when you're flust-"
"Fine, but it better help you a hell of a lot for all of the trouble it's going to cause us."
"Your bond with this snake-"
They hopped in a carriage and let themselves be led back to Hogwarts. None of them said anything because they were all scared of how they would react to seeing the same place their friends had died in. Mcgonagall did a good job of renovating though with the help of Hogwarts herself and she had altered most of the places the battle had taken place so it wouldn't feel quite so looming. Though they all felt a bit sad, they were doing okay with being back at school, a lot better than they thought they would be.
"Yes Harry, but I do insist that we work on your grammar, I mean of course it won't matter around me because I'm stunning but-"
3. Do you want to have both points or view or just Harry's?
She was stunned into silence when she had walked into Harry's room to find him sitting on his bed, completely calm with one of the deadliest snakes known to wizard kind.
Harry hadn't played Quidditch in front of other people for a while but as soon as he walked out he missed it. He heard the screams coming from all sides of the stadium and the cheers and saw all the banners the houses had made last minute. After some seriously ridiculous tryouts, Blaise had accepted Harry as a suitable replacement for Draco, who had quit earlier in the year because he had lost interest in the sport. He saw all of the players lined up for their starting plays and for the first time in a very long time, Harry felt like he had made it home because even if everything else changed, Quidditch was always there for him at the end of the day.
"Oh, you have the same schedule as me, I can just go with you to classes so you aren't berated by your adoring fans. And before you ask, no Mcgongall does not know why you switched houses and I know your classes because she told me we had identical schedules when you failed to be present at the end of dinner."
I'm super sorry this chapter took so long to get out, I've been dealing with a lot and my school it starting up soon. Kudos and Comments are still open though! I should be updating more regularly though and I hope some of you are still interested in reading. Thank you so much for your patience and I hope you all liked this chapter.<3 We had to put my dog down and this isn't very long but I figured I'd give you something to read, a full length chapter should be up tomorrow.
"Mate I know you probably don't want to go but just in case, I figured I'd let you know that Blaise is sneaking in fire whiskey." Ron looked like he was trying to be supportive but Harry didn't care, alcohol was all he needed to hear, forgetting about everything for at least one night was exactly what he wanted right now.
"Fine, tell the house elves to just make my usual, they don't like making coffee for the whole Great Hall but they like me for some reason so they make it for me. You'll probably have to swing by the kitchens for it though." Malfoy was about to leave the room when Harry called his name again.
Eventually, he realized he had been staring for far longer than necessary and he hid behind a bush thinking of how to let Harry know where the dorms were without ruining this one place he had found that gave him peace, they had been arch enemies for years but Draco wasn't a monster. Luckily, an otter patronus showed up and started speaking in Granger's voice.
"Well for one, he doesn't like being called 'it' apparently and his name is Sidereum"
"Harry! What have I told you about those, it scared me for you they really are dangerous no matter how many times you do them. Please do be more careful next time but congratulations on winning the match!" Hermione tried her best to look upset but even Harry could tell how excited she was that he had something to be happy about again even if she was disappointed that Gryffindor had lost the best seeker in a century.
"Where do you think you're going?" They both said in unison.
of all people. They were being civil sure, but living together was going to be a lot harder than tolerating one another during classes. Luckily though, Mcgonagall had added a fifth table for the eighth years and he would still be able to eat meals with his friends. That was probably the only thing from Hermione's lecture that had stuck out to Harry though, he had zoned out through most of it.
"I got your coffee Harry, we should leave for class in the next couple minutes though if you don't want to be- ah, I see you've met Jared." he tried to sound surprised and like he hadn't been listening to their conversation and luckily Potter was dense enough to take the bait.
"Finally Ronald, now that were all here and it's lunchtime how about some food while we interrogate our best friend about his odd new... wait what is it's name?"
"Yes Potter, it's fine if we sit together so long as you help me because I am absolutely rubbish at this class and somehow you managed to be top in the subject." Draco smirked at how nervous Harry had been to ask such a simple question, it was almost
I might be updating pretty frequently for a while, I'm not in school yet so I have a lot of free time. As always, kudos and comments are greatly appreciated!! Let me know if you have any suggestions/ questions for the story i'm always happy to clarify or fix a mistake!

"Me? Why ever would you think that?" Ron said in mock offense.
"Congrats mate! Do you like the new kiss cam Fred and George convinced Mcgonagall to let them put up? Personally, I think it's fascinating, it focuses on the single people who have the most chemistry. There are going to be so many new couples at Hogwarts this year." Ron said while looking very excited at the prospect of embarrassing outings and unintentionally revealed feelings.
Potter grabbed his wand and let his snake climb onto his shoulders and then stormed out of the room looking just about as furious as Draco had seen him when he was literally facing against Voldemort. He would be lying if he said it didn't scare him a bit. Harry visibly stopped looking so mad though once they had started walking and that comforted Draco a bit.
Harry fed Sidereum and Hedwig and picked up his things. He didn't really have to pack, he rarely took anything out of his trunk after Hogwarts, it just made it easier to leave when the time came and he often lost track of the days when the Dursley's shut him in his room so it was better to just be ready to leave. He ran down to the kitchen to get breakfast when the rest of them we're watching the telly- he wouldn't get any if he didn't sneak it- and he ran back upstairs to get Hedwig and just like that he had left the Dursley's once again.
"Oh gods! I am so so late for practice and then we have the game I have to leave for Quidditch like now. I am so sorry Malfoy I do promise to teach you that spell though, uh I will be here tomorrow after dinner to help, show up if you can! I'll see you in the common room later tonight." With that, Harry bolted out of the library and down to the Quidditch field for the warm up drills he was supposed to be leading.
"I'm bunking with you apparently, and by the way Malfoy, you shriek louder than anyone I have ever heard." He didn't turn to Malfoy to respond and he'd kept his voice in a deadpan but there was a hint of a smile at the thought of having the normalcy of their rivalry back. "Anyway, I've just realized it's morning and we're probably late for breakfast so I think I'm going to head down to the Great Hall and grab some coffee or something."
"Honestly mate, just snog him already it's obvious you're in love with him, the only person that hasn't figured it out yet is the ferret himself."
"You might want to check that coffee for poison Harry-"
"What's? Oh yeah of course wait but whats the... hair?" Harry was far too surprised by this new side of Malfoy than reasonable and he was having trouble forming a real sentence.
1. Do you want Sidereum to be a big part of the story or more of a background character?
"You might want to check that coffee for poison Harry-" Jared was smirking at him of all things like he just got Potter to turn on him with a single comment and he thought it had worked because Potter looked like he'd just stepped in something awful but he was utterly shell-shocked at what he said.
"Can you teach it to me? I know it isn't Transfiguration and that wasn't part of the deal but it would really help if you did." Malfoy looked so desperate to get any edge that he could on this subject and it made Harry just a little bit sad for him.
"Well I mean, you will still have to at least try to retain the information but it will help you recall it and it will make you memorize it faster. You aren't permitted to use the charm during exams and stuff but it helps you get the information stuck up in your brain much faster."
Sidereum hadn't left his side for anything other than food since he came out of his shell and to let Harry shower, which had to take several hours of convincing every time and it was a bit annoying but surprisingly he was fine with it. He was going to meet Hermione, Ron and Lavender at King's cross, Fred was already at Hogwarts because he had been making lesson plans. Harry apparated to a place near King's Cross and walked the rest of the way, he always liked walking, or running. He spent most of his time like that after the war, it always calmed him but his absolute favourite thing to do was to stargaze. No matter how many things changed in his life, he always loved to stargaze, they were always there, and he would look at them for hours on end at the Dursley's even as a kid. They were the only thing that ever gave him real hope during the war and he liked to think that all the people he had lost were up there.
"Oh that's wonderful Harry! I didn't think that you had a plan but I think that will make you happy, I really hope Mcgonagall lets you apply. I mean you definately have more than the necessary qualifications for it-" Lavender had gone a bit too far with that, she still viewed Harry as the savior and fawned over him but bringing up the war even vaguely make gave Harry a breakdown.
"Let's go then Gryffindorks!" With Ginny's rather offensive remark, Harry led them out onto the pitch.
"I think I want to become the DADA professor, I really enjoyed teaching the DA and I don't want to be an auror but it's still my favourite subject in school." Harry hadn't even thought that was a possibility and was surprised by his own sudden decisiveness.
"Sorry about how I acted at the twin's shop, I was a bit surprised and I've never been any good with confrontation."
Sighing, Harry sat himself down on a couch near the common room preparing himself for a conversation that he knew would turn into a one-sided lecture when he refused to talk about his feelings. He knew it was unreasonable that he never told his friends how he was feeling but it was just too hard to say out loud and he was scared he wouldn't stop until he'd told them everything and he wasn't ready to be that vulnerable with anyone for that matter.
They had arrived at Hogwarts pretty soon and got off the train as quickly as possible so they could feed the Thestrals. They technically weren't supposed to but they couldn't help it, all of them could see the fascinating creatures now and Hermione had been researching the best food for the Thestrals and she wanted to see how they liked her odd bunches of herbs and spiced raw meat. Harry was always hesitant to see the creatures but he was glad to have escaped the stares from his classmates.
He finally arrived at home, back at the Dursley's once more. He had thought that he was free of them after the war but he couldn't bear to be at number 12 Grimmauld Place after Sirius' death and the only place for him to go was right back with his retched muggle family. Harry had -of course- been locked in his room and barely fed, as usual but today was particularly bad, he couldn't stop the voices in his head telling him that it was all his fault that Teddy would grow up without his parents, that Dennis would have to grow up without his older brother. He pulled out his transfiguration textbook and started reading up on a new type of transformations that Mcgonagall had discovered during the war, something about manifesting abnormally potent emotions into actual objects.
Pirate?
“Well,” Harry said as he leaned in very close. “that’s settled then, let’s just see where this goes, we don’t have to put any labels on this, and we still have a
The Captain gritted out a curse, his eyes were intense, shifting between Harry and the dying man on the ground. “Shit, he knows.”
Have a fantastic day/night!!
Of course it was Zabini.
“How do I know that you’ll let me go when we arrive at the next harbour?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the dread that was coiling in his stomach.
Hi! This is a bit of a longer chapter for y'all hehe :)
“Calm down Pans, he’s going to work with me, I’ll feed him until he drops.” Eduardo winked at her and Pansy just huffed in return, clearly offended by both Ron and Eduardo cutting her off. “Come along now Harry, we’ve got work to do.”
“Please just call me Harry.” Harry didn’t want people to call him by his full name, it made him feel icky, made him think about things he’d rather not think about.
(See the end of the chapter for
The smirking bastard seemed to be everywhere.
that he was the only one. "There are others? Others like me?"
The Captain frowned and for some reason shot a worried look in Harry’s direction. “You should’ve told me earlier.”
“Mhm,” Harry hummed in agreement. “It does.”
Until the stranger removed his hands.
Harry looked up and indeed spotted the black flag waving in the wind: from such a distance he couldn’t see
“Oh piss off.”
“Ah,” Eduardo said. “Valencia, one of the most beautiful cities of the glowing country we call España. I wish we had more Spanish people on board, but no, instead I’m stuck with you English idiotas.”
Harry frowned, not quite understanding why the
He turned his head around with one sharp movement and saw that he
The world slowly gained its colour yet again as Harry spotted two piercing blue eyes looming over him.
That’s why he didn’t like thinking about his scars either.
“Shit,” Harry breathed, as he came to a screeching halt, realizing that he had run straight to the docks.
When after what Harry could only presume were several minutes nothing happened, he let out a sigh of relief and finally allowed himself to look at his new surroundings. It was dark, the little light that
As Harry looked more closely at the masks he could see that the detail on them differed greatly: one was decorated with gold and red, a lion standing proudly between the holes for the eyes, golden leaves curling around the lion’s body as it roared; the other one, however, was decorated with green and silver, a snake carefully navigating in a figure of eight between the eyes, its tongue slipping out viciously while silver branches were positioned around it.
"Yeah," Harry answered as he let his gaze wander over the horizon, looking at the infinite blue that was the sea, the waves crashing on the ship, as if they were trying to grasp the wooden front of the Amortentia.
Well shit, Harry had done a great job of running from one man into a nest of pirates.
Ron was just about to open his mouth to say something in return, but was quickly shut up by Ginny. “Don’t Ron, we all know it’s going to sound stupid, whatever you were going to say. Here,” she said as she tossed two objects in their direction. “Be happy that I thought of you morons last minute.”
“He used to work in the kitchen with me,” Eduardo said, giving Ron a push in the side with his elbow. “that is, before he got promoted.”
“Weasel! Come here! I know you ruined this, it has your fingerprint of destruction all over it!" Blaise's voice carried over the whole ship, making both Harry and Ron turn in surprise.
“Hey,” the red haired guy said, distracting Harry’s attention from the spectacle of Blaise yelling. “My name’s Ron or Weasel, the opinions about my name are divided so t’is your pick.” Ron’s gaze scanned Harry. “And you’re Harry Potter!”
“You might be strong with your lightning and stuff, but are you worth anything without your powers?” Blaise grinned like a shark, teeth white and visible. “Fight me,” he said.
“S’fine, now you two can fight over which mask is going to be worn by who.” Ginny nudged Hermione with her elbow, just like Harry had done with Ron moments before. “This is going to be fun.”
Then Pansy did something strange: she stopped right in front of the door that led to the galleys and knocked on the wood next to the doorframe, after she’d done this she took a step back and waited.
“So, the golden boy goes to the ball with one of us, the wicked ones, how interesting.” Zabini stood before Harry, grinning like a shark. “Have you already got your mask ready Potter?” he asked as he circled Harry like a predator measuring its prey up.
"Wow Em! That was magnificent!" Luna yelled, running towards him as fast as her light feet could carry her. She pulled at his arms and inspected him thoroughly. "It didn't even shred your clothes in the slightest."
Before Harry knew it he was enveloped in Luna’s sage-y scent, her arms embracing him tightly. “I’ll miss you Em. ”
The Captain huffed as he beat the last black robed man to the ground. “You can’t be serious.”
So, this was one of the longer chapters, mainly meant for setting recurring themes/occasions up ;) Lemme know what you thought !!!
“Show me the scars please,” Pansy said, her voice professional and stark.
Harry didn't need to try hard to remember. "He was pale and had a strange lack of a proper nose. As for how he talked: his voice was gravelly but weirdly smooth at the same time, whenever he spoke it was always in mysteries, as if he was asking me, daring me, to solve his riddles." Harry paused, looking at the Captain's frown. "It wasn't just a dream then?"
Harry gave a short nod and smiled, then he turned around and walked through the door back onto the main deck. He carried his bowl up onto what Ron had said was the quarterdeck and smiled contently, looking at the sun setting over the sea. On the main deck the pirates were busy talking, discussing their activities of the day as they made their way into the galleys where the food was waiting for them.
The pieces suddenly seemed to fall into place.
“Thanks Gin,” Harry said grinning broadly as he recognised two masks lying in front of him.
A wide smile spread on Luna’s lips. “Oh! Let me name you then! Please?!” She didn’t seem surprised that there was an intruder on her ship at all, instead simply smiling excitedly.
Em… apparently it was his new name.
“No-o I don’t mean for me, no, erm, Blaise told me to ask you,” Nigel said, while going red and rubbing the back of his neck in a nervous gesture.
"He uses the lightning to kill?" Harry asked, affronted: he had never met any storm that was eager to kill, ever, and he couldn't quite imagine the lightning willingly killing someone. With Harry knowing what destruction the lightning could bring, not only to others but himself as well anger flared within him, combining with the shock of finding out there was someone like him
“Are you barking mad Harry?!” Ron yelled as they were sitting in the great hall the next morning. “You’re going to the Yule ball, with a Slytherin?!” The hall had gone strangely quiet and Harry wasn’t surprised to see that most people were either looking at Ron for his outburst or at Harry. Even the Slytherin table had gone quiet and Harry could see Zabini smirking at his victory.
“Yes Potter, yes I do,” Malfoy said, vulnerability glowing softly in his eyes.
Anyways, I'll see you all next time and until then I hope you have an amazing day/night !
Blaise withdrew his lean blade before he immediately rushed to attack Harry again, Harry barely fended him off, clearly not knowing what he was doing, but trying anyway. He lashed out at Blaise once he withdrew his blade yet again, but unfortunately he fended him off with ease.
It was dreams like the one he had had the night before, dreams that bore the knowledge of not being dreams, but memories, popping into his mind to reassure themselves that Harry truly hadn’t forgotten them yet.
The illusion broke into pieces.
Harry had already turned around and started running, passing dozens of people who all shrieked in surprise as he bolted past them. The streets were so packed that it was hard for Harry to keep going, but he
Harry screamed, losing all concept of time in the sense of his desperation.
“You leave the ship for what? Half an hour? Less? And you’re almost dead already?!” The Captain yelled in frustration as he easily beat the people in black robes. “How is that even possible?”
“Why would I tell on myself? That would take the mystery out of it. After all I
Harry nodded, remembering the promise he'd been forced to make earlier that day, and made his way off the quarterdeck, leaving Luna to gaze at the stars. Once he arrived on the main deck though, he remembered that he had absolutely no clue where the infirmary
Harry knew nothing.
“I heard you are going to leave us in Valencia,” Neville said, coming to stand next to Harry, both of them were now looking at Eduardo chasing Pansy and Ron, but thinking about something entirely different.
couldn’t see who’s face belonged to the man he had danced with.
“It’s all mechanics Potter, no need to worry, you’re still the only one with powers here,” Pansy said bitterly, but also with a slight hint of wonder in her voice, as if she couldn’t quite grasp that he was here, but refused to give up her permanently annoyed aura.
Harry opened his eyes and screamed: there were flames everywhere, while the people in black robes were nowhere to be seen. Slowly, a man,
“What?!” Harry said loudly, not quite understanding and not quite sure what to do with himself. “I’m sorry Nigel but I don’t think-”
“Oh piss off, all of you,” Ron said, crossing his arms in front of his chest in a frustrated gesture.
. “It’s especially cute when they try to hijack the ship. Anyways we jump out and take their belongings, while killing them as payback for even daring to set foot here.”
“There you go,” the Captain said. “you actually
“You should honor your own rules,” Harry said before quickly whisking his own blade upward, deflecting the Captain’s sword away from his chest, instead Harry now had his sword pointed at the
“You know what?” the first voice gritted out. “It’s fine Weasel. Blaise! Can we start setting sail?! The boy’s not here, it’s no use to keep looking.”
“C’mon show the people how powerful I am, show them your light,” the shadow said, their voice unrecognizable, distorted, but known to Harry’s ears.
“Then where's my damned date Zabini? I don’t see them anywhere do you?!”
“Okay,” The Captain said softly, both in character and tone. “C’mon.” He lifted Harry by the shoulder, wrapping Harry’s arm around his neck to keep him up. Harry’s feet seemed to refuse to function: he was completely numb, as if his body didn’t belong to him. As a result the captain basically had to drag Harry through the streets, back to the harbour.
Harry softly wrapped his other hand around the man’s waist while twirling him around.
Ron held his head desperately in his hands. “Nothing Neville, nothing at all, except, this is
Harry twirled Dorian around in a circle, copying the other dancers on the floor. As he looked around he saw that more people had joined the dance: Ginny winked at him while dancing with Neville, Hermione was softly smiling at Victor Krum while he held her hand surprisingly gently, and even Ron and Lavender were spotted dancing, even though Ron looked rather uncomfortable and kept shooting glances at Hermione.
you to be scared.”
Then Harry suddenly came to the realization that this ‘Loony’ person was coming downstairs, but surely they weren't coming here, were they? There were only barrels here, no rope right? He couldn’t be found, not now. Not now that he’d just escaped the claws of yet another foe. He looked around frantically, hoping that his eyes would not find the frayed image of rope.
Harry softly let his finger run over the forks on his arm, to anyone else the patterns would look completely random, but Harry recognised every single little line, being able to trace them perfectly without even looking.
Harry wondered about the identity of his secret date the rest of his way back, never settling on one option.
read this until the end of this chapter, THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT SO FUCKING MUCH YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.
“Useless aren’t they?” Dorian whispered in front of Harry. “I mean everyone here can see that Weasley is jealous, he should’ve asked her, instead of waiting.” Dorian’s tone was calm, tinged with a hint of incredulity.
Far away a scream could be heard, it was a voice that Harry recognised vaguely, but not enough to name it. The tone was desperate, yet even though Harry had heard plenty of desperate, devastated tones he hadn’t heard one quite like this before. The voice screamed a name. A name that seemed to be so familiar to Harry that the edges of his mind were trying to grasp it.
