Finally, Narcissa looked down and away and Draco retracted his hand. The rest of their allotted hour passed with only polite remark. Observers in the room, when glancing at them, would offhandedly remark how pale and still and smooth they were, comparing them to cold, perfected marble. How right they were.
He didn’t anticipate this level of destruction. Even the battle of Hogwarts hadn’t been so utterly violent on its surroundings, so rarely did wizards intend to cause property damage. Here whole buildings had gone up and cars eviscerated to their parts. Often any damage was caused from deflected spells, unless a barrier was in the way, their recipients always, well, recipients. He didn’t remember much from the battle of Hogwarts with any distinction, the fear and adrenaline and terror turning it into flashes and sensations. Not unlike today.
was nervously drinking again, he should slow down. He took a deep breath. So much was happening. He knew how they got here, it just had happened so fast he hadn’t said anything. He wasn’t sure he could stop it now.
This wasn’t only designed to kill, but to maim and forever dismember, stinging barbs home grown from ages of mistrust.
“Now you’re just dodging the question,” Harry laughed, getting himself another cup of tea, Draco looked away at the fire. It was time to change the subject.
“And used a terrible insult, just in quality alone.” Harry gave a wet laugh at his rotten mouth, giving responses just to give them.
Draco holds in the choke of surprise he wants to make but Harry Potter, who he’s certain has never had a normal day in his life, takes it in stride. “Hey there,” he answers in his soft children-are-listening voice, “How are you feeling?”
“Alright,” she took a sip of wine before leaning back in the seat and rubbing her temples, rich umber skin shining in the firelight, “So here’s the issue.” The witch chewed her words carefully.
“Well,” the anger of the day, combined with the exhaustion spiked and rose higher, before cresting and falling. All he really wanted was someone to tell him he did all he could. So he settled in the middle: “Could be better.”
The need to run and the need to burrow. The need to hide and the need to fight. Oscillations as common to him now as the turning of the earth.
After they’d spent what felt like all day talking and playing with Rebecca, they would return back to the Auror offices and Harry would try to track down her family. There wasn’t much left that hadn’t gotten caught in the blast and like Rebecca had said, her dad’s side of the family, the few that were left, weren’t so keen to open letters from the Ministry. Draco has gone through a few books in his time waiting (and becoming
like Draco had pictured— she was tall and that was only made worse by her high heels and her hair was in a blunt, ash blonde bob. Just like the sort of women on the magazines at Tesco’s, sneering at him with their dark eyes and their running makeup and their thin, bony bodies. Her makeup was at least tasteful, and only served to make her face look younger and more vibrant, all of which was compounded by the dark purple suit she wore. On her lapel was a pin with the crossed wands and American flag surrounded by a border of stars and the words
“No,” he said shortly and without a smile, so much so she slightly recoiled in the way that wait staff would when faced with the worst of customers, “Thank you.” He added as an afterthought, while she bobbed and weaved around the other closely seated tables, back to the hostess stand where she instantly started gossiping to the other waiter.
This chapter is a huge info dump but, to be fair, I did put legal drama in the tags and with any legal drama comes background and case law. Think of it as the wizard’s version of Legally Blonde. Draco would look good in pink but it ruins the aesthetic of being an emo boy. (sidebar: I get
And something deep within him, where the bone deep emotions stemmed, warmed, unabashed and with fervor. It was pride and it was pain, still, from the information he now had, and it was an ache and a
So why even fight? Why not end it? Why not stop staring into Harry’s eyes and just walk away? Send a letter and call it done.
They lapsed into more small talk while Draco finished off his glass of wine, grimacing as he tasted a bit of sediment that had made it into the bottle. It didn’t help the headache. Then there was the counting out of muggle money to the tune of— “Oh you don’t use the standard currency?” “That must be difficult” — that Harry handled before everyone was standing up and filing out of the restaurant.
“Really? You don’t have AC?” Draco shook his head. “Damn, I don’t know if I could survive the summer without AC. Way too humid.”
Her mother whined in the background, her hands grasping for her daughter and the mirrors pressed closer—
“—But then after, we kept running into each other and after a few false starts, we decided to give it a go.”
, whispered to him that it wasn’t actually Potter’s fault he was angry. But that wasn’t what he wanted to hear, wasn’t what the wounded animal of his ego wanted.
“ she told him on the rare monthly (expensive) floo call they had. She’s become a bit batty after moving to Paris and becoming a seer to muggles, living her days in the Latin quarter and wearing black lipstick; but her opinions, as always, were more truthful than anything. She felt no need to lie, preferring to always tell some shade of the truth, which worked exceptionally well in her job. People were always looking for the news that they wanted to hear but lacked the strength to admit.
“And not little mountains, the big ones.” Thomas added making them all laugh, though Draco was finding it harder and harder to care for the small talk and fake the laughter.
Weasley hadn’t changed much in the years since the war—his red hair still a shock, his height still a good few centimeters higher than he was, his limbs still gangly and long, with mitts for hands that had made him a decent keeper once he’s gotten over his fear. Tonight, however, he was breaking the Hogwarts illusion, with his solid gold wedding ring flashing in the streetlights, the healing cut along his eyebrow, the dust covering his modest, but newly purchased and well fitting robes. The spindly mitts for hands seemed to have expanded and now matched his height and weight accordingly.
In my opinion, Harry doesn’t want to be a hero as he wants to be a good guy. He wants to always be on the right side of things
Matilda just laughed in response, like Harry hadn’t just created a price out of thin air, doing some sort of magic with his usual devil-may-care attitude towards the secrecy statute. Draco could only shrewdly stare at him and hope that the Ministry would take mercy on his idiotic boyfriend.
After another hour and a half, Cynthia finally stood up, cracking her knuckles. Her suit jacket had been discarded to the back of the chair, a bit shapeless in the shoulders, and now she stood up, examining what they had done. She was wearing a faintly patterned purple blouse, fashionably tucked into her high-waisted trousers, cutting a figure that wouldn’t look out of place of those black and white films that played on the Telly at times, only much larger than the shrunken people and in full color. Thomas had another one of those pens that he was clicking as he looked up from his notes. He’d also lost his suit jacket, now leaning back in his chair, his sleeves rolled up and showing a smattering of black ink on his forearms. Draco watched for movement but there was none. They appeared to be muggle tattoos. He wondered what sort of people could get into Mage-USA, what families and connections mattered out of 16 million.
Harry sucked in a shaky breath. “I love you too I—“ he hesitated, “I shouldn’t have sprung this on you, Rebecca...”
Behind her was an even taller, broader man, with two days of facial hair, square, thick black glasses and wearing a dark gray suit with a thin tie. It seemed that while she was stretched tall, he was tall proportionally and regarded them all with a brief but matching smile before falling into a more blank expression. He also had a pin on his lapel but also seemed to be in charge of carrying their bags, and her briefcase. He nodded once at the introduction before reaching out a firm hand to shake each of theirs once. Draco’s hand ached a bit from all the glad-handing they’d been doing over the week, between this and looking for a new place that could hold three people instead of two. Another change from the past.
His own list had been torturously small. Mother. Blaise. And after some hesitation, his aunt. Three people. He kept a small circle and he was certain the doctors at Saint Mungo’s would have called it deficient in some way, but it was better that way.
He’d never expected this. Never once dreamed that in any reality, he would be this happy after a date with Draco Malfoy. You could have told him, at any point in his life, that he would be here and he wouldn’t believe it. Not ever. And now.
“Now wait wait,” Butterman put his hands up, “If there’s schooling involved, well, that’s a horse of a different color.”
have stopped him, or could have as he was just as enamored as Harry was with him, as strange as it was. It was more the principle of it. Yes, of course, all of Harry’s many friends knew and were slowly warming up to the idea of them, to the point where even Ginerva—Ginny was having polite conversations with him, and he’d been round to meet Teddy as Teddy instead of Theodore and spend the afternoon, and he was sure he now knew every auror in the department when he would pop in to meet Harry and even his mother has said: “My darling Draco, you could do far worse.” And though Harry had looked offended on his behalf Draco
non-magical, venerated Humphrey as saint-like. He was stricken by Dragon Pox as a child, before being cured and became a huge advocate for underserved people during his tenure. When he retired after he was cured, and after he guided a nation through the trauma of the war, he turned his attention to the children of the country. It was he, who took over as the secretary of education, not un-similar to our parliamentary Minister of Education, and worked to repeal the separate but equal doctrine.”
“I remember,” and Draco was barely keeping the frustration from leaking into his voice. He very dearly wanted to pick a fight, but knew that people were waiting on them. At least Harry would go first, that way he hoped they would be a bit more lenient on his crimes.
“It’s clear. I would be cautious of any nausea, some of the magic was well set in. Seems to be Herringborn’s work, with some variations from the Carrows, but the curses are gone so you’re free to go in,” he pushed his hair back with a sigh as they brushed past him, leaving a rookie pair outside as was customary, he was soaked all the way through and just wanted some time to sit down and rest and head home and—
“Well, no,” Harry conceded, “Though, I think in sixth form, you’d have to do all sorts of complex spatial maths and reasoning. But up until I went to Hogwarts that was something I learned every day.”
But now they were in the decidedly bare place in Camden, the muggle realtor assured that the three of them were interior decorators and they were left alone to explore.
“C’mon,” Harry tugged his hand, spying a chair and a half in the corner, “No sense shouting through this.”
that Irish wizards would let the British wizards educate their children you are a mad lad. The maddest of lads!
“It is okay,” Draco confirms, and he laughs, relieved that Harry gets it, and realizes in the same breathtaking way as when he realized he was in love that how could Harry
“It’s less quiet here and no one seems to know who I am, so I am free to wander aisles of rugs and teacups to my hearts content. Were you reading?” Potter motioned with a flippant hand towards the book under Draco’s arm. He felt like a child with his hand in the sweets jar.
“Almost like hating people over blood status,” Draco said quietly in the silence. No one breathed for a moment. He never made mention of what he was a part of.
Draco scoffed, crossing his arms, “I hardly think that picking some rugs and plates counts as a favor.”
parts of America had only joined in the last 100 years, and that was just the muggle parts. It was such a
do you think telling him to piss off, after he all but begged you to stay together, is the right thing to do? In any conceivable situation, it is intrinsically the
“Really. Unintentional magic. Are you a wain yourself then, Mr. Harry Potter?” The wind in the room kicked up.
“Right. Well.” He looked around for an authority figure and seeing none, drew himself up to full height. “We can handle the situation here but we’re short—could you please, Department Head Potter and—“
“Oh.” Harry Potter looked at it in shock but then his lips curled up in a smile, taking the plate carefully, “You’re really good at this.”
“I’m sorry for whatever I did and I love you,” Harry affirmed before crowding into his space again and then they were kissing against the doorframe and it was all of his fantasies come true, Draco a more willing participant as his body reacted and—
Almost instantly, the father was eviscerated, his innards strewn about the kitchen in a macabre display once he had tripped the trap. His oldest son was next, who in his haste had trigged the jellying curse, which turned his bones to acid and ate its way through his soft flesh. Then the next brother, terrified, had simply been vaporized by a series of heated curses. The mother was currently stuck under an enchanted weight, designed to slowly crush, while the youngest daughter, trapped and wounded from the fringes in the doorway sat, frightened and crying and in view of the whole thing.
Draco can’t help it, he half laughs at that, the tension broken. It’s been a long day. Harry gives him a wider smile, and they sort of stared at each other that way for a few moments. On the wireless, a Chopin piece was playing and in the room, the fire crackled.
“I don’t want them to be gone!” She wailed, “We were supposed to go to church and then back to Gran’s!”
“It’s part of Greater London,” Harry said, “So just outside of the city centre, in a sense, and near Temple Church and adjacent to Westminster.”
Then there was the linguistics of the country—they called their muggles Unenchanted, the term apparently new in the last 60 years. Before that, all of the texts seemed to use the words Wandless, but that had fallen into a bit of a faux pas, being that indigenous populations (a word combination he had never seen before) tended to forgo traditional wands to do their magic. Sometimes they called them Giftless too, that word was littered in, with healthy skepticism in Hermione’s print.
“Mr. Malfoy, hold it.” Butterman took charge of the room. “If we’re going to do this, we’re going to do it correctly and dottin’ every I and crossin’ every T. Someone from the Family Court should be in touch with all of you once we get the paperwork sorted.”
With Draco, there had always been some sort of inexplicable force, pulling them together, and if for a moment he had believed in the drivel that Trelawny had always spoke of, he would have said it was some kind of fate. Only now, he
“I don’t want to lose you either,” he said after the longest pause, feeling the hot wet heat of Harry’s teardrops on his shoulder soak into his shirt. Harry never made sound when he cried. He never had to wonder why. “I’m in love with you, even after all the things I said. Gods, I— I don’t know why I did it. But I’m still in love with you. I think I might always be.”
What they don’t tell you about in much of dark magic cursebreaking, as small a field as it is, is that sometimes, there’s not much you can do to actually break the curse. Most curses were intended to be used in the moment, when emotions, or lack there of, where high and potent, giving each curse an extra edge. But dark curses settled into objects, festering like mold, those could be violent and deadly, twisting just as much as their creators. It was rarely possible to know the exact effects of the curse itself, particularly if the creator was dead.
It wasn’t an ideal way to pass hours but reading their books, watching their movements, their lives, he started to sympathize with them. They were just as unhappy as he was at times, lost in a world where they couldn’t change without magic and yet...at times they were happy. Blindingly happy in their own world. He couldn’t help but think of
“—God I missed you.” And at that Harry had leaned forward and cupped his face all in one motion and then they were kissing.
“I think,” Draco started, “I think this is why we’re supposed to do this together or not at all,” he licked his lips, tasting the scent of rain boiling off the pavement in the growing heat of the summer, “Because my fear is that she’ll have to spend her whole life proving I haven’t gotten too much influence on her. And yours seems to be that she’s gotten too much of your influence on her.”
come with me to Harry’s office, I’ll help Harry clear this all up.” And at that, he gave a tiny smile, a hopeful one and an honest one. It wasn’t endearing, not like Harry’s were, but it was so...out of place to be directed at him that he knew that he had to see what this was, what was so important that it had made even Ronald Weasley treat Draco Malfoy with a semblance of dignity and respect.
Thinking of gentle but honest Luna Lovegood, he tried to remember more of what the New Prophet had said in their five year retrospective and less of how she had accepted his apology.
. Some of the buildings, in a gothic style, could be stand ins for Hogwarts. The broken bodies matched the muggleborn ones that littered Diagon Alley. There was the Death Eaters, a now forever nightmare sending curses whizzing to them, just as they always had, the spells muted by the masks. People still had a way of dropping and crumbling when hit with the various spells—the way stupefy would send someone twisting, the way expelliarmus would knock someone off their feet, the sickly green glow of avada kedavra streaking low and fast off the cobbles. It felt endless.
“Mum says it’s because the magic passed over her and that Da’s Mum—not her Mum—she’s a real banshee. But Mum says that sort of stuff all the time.” She was taking this well if a bit dazed.
In the room, Liza and John and a woman in dark green robes, very on brand for the uniform of the Irish Ministry. Harry never required his apprentices to wear any particular robes or to even wear robes if they didn’t want to, and so both seemed to have pulled them out for consistency purposes for this very official work. But gone where the soothing patterns he was used to, the woman throwing it off with her dark, serious eyes, red painted lips and deep auburn hair.
stalking me, or I would have ended up a cannibal’s dinner,” or something like that and he knew Harry would never talk about it with him again. They could avoid it for the rest of their lives. Or he could push deeper.
John was a tall man, easily as tall as Ronald, with deep brown skin, though not as rich and luminous as Hermione’s, with a shaved head and a single pierced ear. He had kind eyes and a deep voice and he might have been distantly related to someone Harry knew from his time at university, but Draco could never remember who. He joined after Liza did and was considered the most junior member of the team.
Draco Malfoy looked at him, heard how desperate his please had sounded, and stopped struggling entirely.
“I think so too,” she smiled at him, “Makes it all more worthwhile.” He returned the smile minutely, letting Draco Malfoy, heir to Malfoy Manor, take over in his responses, an easy disguise to throw on so he wouldn’t have to think as hard or exacerbate the headache.
“Right,” Harry responded, off kilter, so Draco took the lead, “If you could follow us to the aparition point, we can get you set up in the flat— then, if you’re not too tired, we can show you what we’ll be working on?”
“That all makes sense but why would he risk the secrecy of the magical community? Being that public of a figure?”
”That must make it hard for tourists to visit,” Thomas commented to no one in particular, watching a red bus throttle past them.
He stared at the ghost of Harry across from him, breathing just as heavily and probably thinking just the same things as he was.
“Yes,” Draco responded promptly, standing up with a bit of wince. He wasn’t sure he’d moved in a while, “We assumed you’d want something simple and to turn in early.”
They hadn’t seen Cynthia or Thomas either, which was how he preferred it. He didn’t want to know what they would think. Instead, he turned further inward, ruminating on their potential reactions to the notes and transcripts delivered to them. None of them were very positive.
them, so, in effect, there was no where for them to go. But in a bold, and powerful, move, Shacklebolt made his second sweeping decision that punishment would be doled out in three ways: first, that a form of reparations would happen. This had gone to the largest members and largest businesses who had supported the Dark Lord or undermined the people persecuted by him. While it had cost a pretty galleon to the Malfoy family, others like the Crabbe’s and the Greengrass’ had been forced to entirely empty their coffers and the Prophet had been entirely defunded. These reparations then were redistributed amongst the worst hit victims, rebuilding key locations in the communities and funding the second part of the plan.
“Blaise, I’m not particularly in the mood,” Draco said, folding the note and placing it back into his pocket as he set his cooled tea to the side so he could continue his research on pincushion curses from India that had been twisted into the latest death eater case in Newcastle upon Tyne. “If you could be so kind as to return to your office—”
, marking her as a member of the Magical US Government, just as it was spelled out on all the paperwork. They had finished mailing over long distance owl less than a week before the trial was to start.
“And what, you learned this...when?” Harry sighed and took Draco’s hand, as if the basics of arithmacy were just taught casually at Hogwarts, and continued walking with him towards their flat, the clouds rumbling more as they made their way up the street.
had become a bit of a safe area the way Patel’s had, a place where he wasn’t so unmoored. He finished another glass of red wine and drifted back into the conversation.
, And I get bummed out,” and “If you feel like giving up, just make a mess of me, I’ll always clean it up...”
. “They’d hushed it up pretty fast. Not really something you want your 'Boy Who Defeated Voldemort' advertised as. And I figured I just needed time off and yet... And yet, the cases got worse. Once we’d rounded up all the worst ones, easy open and shut cases— your Herringborn, your Divitis, your McDonoughs. That was when we started getting things more in the gray area. People who’d lost limbs and given up their fight long ago. Scared teenagers. Unpaid reparations. Many victims and rarely did we get the bad guys. It was harder and harder to draw the line and leave it behind at the end of the day. Ron was spending more time with Hermione, and she’d just started her advocacy work. And Gin was busy with her team. And here I was... still fighting a war I’d thought I’d ended.” He swallowed hard. Draco knew he should stop this, this emoting of personal business, knew he should look away at the least, but he couldn’t.
” he said, not really caring anymore and emotionally wrung through, “What were you off doing while I was
“Draco Malfoy.” She nodded slowly, not really recognizing the name. He added, “Head Cursebreaker at Smithson & Sons.” She didn’t change her expression but her slight hesitation meant she recognized the firm at least. He could work with that.
“Well,” the blonde continued, “I find it perfectly reasonable considering you did wandless magic— again— in a shop.”
that he shouldn’t have accepted the invitation to go out, that he had been annoyed with his mother earlier and that he could feel everything simmering under his skin, a vast and violent ocean. He
“Yes, I think it was about that. That some people will orbit around each other, in perfect circles, even if they want to leave it.”
Well. Now they had to talk. It was only years of proper rearing and breeding that kept Draco from doing exactly what he wanted to do (quickly apparate home, exhaustion be damned and try to warm up) and instead head directly over to Potter and ask him what he was doing.
This part of the journey was terrifying, the leaping forward. He’d read about the pains that couples went through with the adoption process in the muggle world, never mind the additional troubles of being a same sex couple trying to adopt and add on the problems of being part of the wizarding community.
, he thought to himself, listening to the sounds of Harry finishing his thoughts, a gentle rumble at this close distance, like distant thunder in their dark room. There was a pause as Harry thought through today, the little victories they’d already achieved.
“Please, call me Cynthia,” she said with a wider smile, “And we’re honored to help out Harry Potter.” Harry stiffened beside him as he always did with fans, Draco’s hand going to the small of his back to steady him. “Your grandfather and great grandfather were hugely helpful in during the world wars with their support, both in medicine and politically.”
about curses. The fact of the matter was, that things with Harry had been going well. Far better than two former school enemies, turned war veterans, and then maladjusted adults, turned semi-functioning and slowly strengthening couple ought to be.
have to stay on brand.” Harry just laughed more, his voice ringing out, catching up to him and walking close enough their shoulders brushed as they navigated the slush and snow drifts. They walk in content silence and Draco will allow himself this crystalline moment. Real or not real, he’d earned this slice of happiness.
by ethnic group as magical immigrants moved into the country. The higher the population, the more likely you are to find Jewish magic schools, Polish, Irish— if there was an ethnic group that moved to the US, the likelihood that you would also find a magical school to serve that population was high.”
The furious expression wavers, and she tucks her hair behind her ear, tiny engagement ring sparkling next to the plain gold band, and finally heaves a sigh, shaking her head.
“Oh?” Harry and he kept up a brisk pace—nothing like with he Americans, where they were practically lightly jogging after them. But enough of one where they wouldn’t get bowled over by the people with places to be.
“I think we’ve made a good start here, Tommy,” she finally said. “We have a list of what to tackle next, yes?” Her reading glasses were holding her hair back, an impromptu headband.
“She must, at some point, have questions about why you were incarcerated, why you did such things. It’s an honest question for a child to ask.”
finally have a chance to whip the rest of the breakers into shape. Harry, being his own boss, set his own schedules, with one of his apprentices covering for him for the two open cases they had back in London.
“On what?” Harry seemed to be following his motions, a somber waltz of unsaid things that was common now. He wondered if this is what had happened to his parents. They’d probably fight again.
“I’m glad you understand that.” Cathleen smiled. She had looked so average before. He remembered what Harry had told him about Umbridge, how she’d used blood quills and built up a kind, if a bit florid, exterior so her actions would slide below the surface like a riptide. “Well, I think that’s all the questions I had. Anyone else?”
“—Oh stop it—” she blushed. Draco was more certain than ever it would be fact within the decade. But a thought sprung up through the certainty, that
He loved her, he really did and for all his parents’ faults, Draco knew, objectively, that she only wanted the best for him. That to see him alive and well and happy was her only care in the world. But constantly needling him was only going to send
“Oh, thank you,” Draco says, flustered, just as Harry cuts in with, “Thanks, we practice at it daily.” Sending the table into another series of chuckles. There’s a small lull in conversation as the waiter comes by to take away empty plates that once held crisp bruschetta and meatballs in a rich sauce. He was really going to have to get in the habit of walking, maybe with Rebecca to the park or something, did muggle-raised children enjoyed parks? While Harry never seemed to put on enough weight for Draco to stop worrying, he himself seemed to be developing a bit of softness in places.
“How many could they possibly have in the magical community?” Draco said after thanking Ron for the refill.
Draco meanwhile occupied himself with reading through Hermione’s rather comprehensive research on the American magical government.
event,” Harry corrected back, before nudging Weasley out of his stupor. Draco shrugged in response. It was hard to be as open when there was an audience.
“No one who looked like you did, is actually interested in ending a relationship, which means you’re being an idiot.”
Draco Malfoy had no words. He was beyond shock. He felt almost numb. And also a faint feeling of giddy because apparently Harry Potter spread insanity.
“At first. And annoyed. Out of every git in the world, I believe was what I said.” Gregarious stories aside, Weasley seemed to have grown a better grasp on the English language, “And believe me, for all the odd and absurd shite that Harry has gotten me into over the years, this is the only
“Then we’ll have to take care of her, won’t we?” Draco said softly, feeling his heart twist uncomfortably in his chest, “So she’s not alone.”
Draco had seemed a little off at first, but blessed, blissfully weird Luna had softened him up. Harry couldn’t take his eyes off him the whole night, knowing that they were there
“No. Never.” Even fighting, it was somehow better than the alternative. He hoped Harry understood that. It meant there was time, even a little, to be together.
“You know,” he finally responded, crossing his arms, “I assumed that dating you would be more cause for emotional trauma or being ostracized.” At one point, he did think those things, extensively, but persistent wearing down had worked like a charm after the first year and a half. Now it was just a joke between two people who understood one another and could laugh at it all.
As he reached the alley, he shook it all off, focusing on his warm, dry and empty home. At least, there was that.
“Now, now, Missus McIntyre, Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy are both eligible to petition for custody under ministry law—“
“I can’t believe it,” he slumped in his chair, “Bloody Saint Potter, here to help the children, savior of the wizarding world.” Harry laughed, his shoulders shaking with mirth. Draco even cracked an honest smile. The music played on.
“Sometimes it is. Sometimes things just are,” and he added after a moment, “Plus you’ve been giving me interior design advice so it balances out.”
It takes him longer than he’d like to admit to actually knock on the door, all of the anxiety and stress of the day culminating in this moment. At so many points in this year, and it had been a year, he could have stopped and taken a different path. He could have never ended up here in front of this door, waiting to knock with the last ounce of courage (stupidity) he had left. But Blaise was right. Trying to resolve the past or trying to avoid the future would never let him knock on that door, would never open him to the possibilities, good and bad, that were ahead. And sometimes, the bad would be
There is a tiny bit of body horror in this one but nothing more dangerous than a movie review of like a Stephen King book would have.
“Now,” Cathleen switches to a new page of paperwork and opens her notepad to a fresh page, “Have you ever been incarcerated?” She makes some notes.
“At first, I thought I’d completely lost it. I couldn’t believe you were there, staring at the wall of rugs. And I knew I had to ask your opinion, if you were real.”
“What’s your name, love?” At least Harry was immune to children, deftly skirting the question for now.
Also also, apologies to any folks who work in grocery stores/convenience stores as Harry most definitely left the bread in the tea aisle and for that I am sorry.
The boards began to fill up as the sun continued its arc across the sky, shifting the light until they needed the artificial ones. Cynthia used an odd pen to jot down notes on the white board, asking questions like ‘MCPA precedent?’ and ‘HP/DM score?’ and ‘Copy of ‘constitution’?’ Her handwriting was full of loops, old fashioned and rather beautiful, starkly different from the blocky, architectural script of her compatriot. The pen was in bright blue on white.
“But that’s why we have interns to help us digitize everything, we want to make it far easier to file and find information since we’re now in the digital era.”
to be mean, which means you’re not and ‘Mione and I stand by Harry’s opinion of you. He’s not always right but,” and he shrugs his massive shoulders as if he hadn’t just given some long analysis of his character and how they, as Harry’s best friends and family, didn’t mind this relationship, “What can you do?”
high approval rating, so much so that when Shacklebolt had stepped down for elections to continue, he was immediately re-elected. Those who wanted the death penalty were satisfied that the worst would be punished with their worst nightmare, the rehabilitationists were ecstatic to see so many people rehabilitated and the pragmatists realized that it was the best bloody option they had and moved on.
“This foreign national,” said the auror, green robes contrasting with his shock of Weasley styled hair, “Is trying to remove this child from the scene without any proper clearance—for all we know he could be a part of all of this—“
Weasley let out another surprised laugh as Harry wheezed next to him, nearly choking on his fast laughter as he stood up, “You’re ridiculous, not all of us are interior design experts,” then he bobbed his head in the usual fashion, said “Loo,” by way of explanation before walking off in a long legged lope that was familiar.
“As you know,” she said, dabbing at the corner of her mouth, “We deal with many different dialects and language barriers in UMNAS, so it’s a great opportunity to look at how we try to solve the wicked problems of today with practicality.”
“Malfoy?” Draco didn’t quite droop, but it was a near thing. It was the Dour, Tall Auror again, “We’re going to need you to do a walkthrough and give us your statement for the record—” He stumbled on his words, looking at Harry Potter standing next to Draco, “—Oh, Auror Potter,” he blustered out, standing a little taller, “I didn’t realize you were here.”
“Enemy enough to nearly get each other expelled a few times, on purpose,” Draco said politely dodging the deeper point, tearing away his gaze.
“To be stuck in an endless perfect circle with you?” Draco looked at him, the perpetual thinness of his face, the crackling silvered scar against his warm sepia skin, the dark hair in a haphazard, the kindness of his smile, the brilliant and emotive green of his eyes. He wondered what Harry saw in him, if he saw Draco in the same way, with his pale skin and flushed cheeks, almost always a certainty when Harry was around, the cool grey of his eyes and the more delicate arch of his brows, the slant of his nose, with just the faintest bump that said it had been broken, the ashy blond color of his hair, and how it would get more yellow in the summer sun. “I think I could handle that.”
“Is there really a whole town of Italians in America?” It would fit in with what Hermione’s notes about the country said.
“Harry,” and Harry finally looked up at him, a chunk of glass missing from his beloved glasses, his hair singed on the same side and his cheeks still far too thin from childhood, and Draco’s admonishment died in his throat, “Why don’t you tell me about her?” He motioned to the small girl in his arms.
Well, there wasn’t much else Harry could say about that but smile at him, and though Draco would tell anyone outside of their family and friends that his being with Harry was obviously for the fame and fortune, it was really for this, quiet conversations and frozen sweets in the candlelight while the storm blew around outside, a separate set of spaces made into one.
“Don’t worry, Draco,” came a soft, dreamy voice beside him as he stood in the outside of a conversation, “They take a while to warm up to everyone.”
great question, I’ve just invented it. I know a lot of other fic comes up with these great ideas where Harry can’t be an auror anymore because of the PTSD from the war and all sorts of other things but I also think that his trauma goes further back that it’s important to remember he’s got all that other baggage from the Dursley’s. So essentially, he created a group (team of one) that handles the children left behind by magical violence/neglect. He’ll go to the location, gently talk down the kids from wherever they’re hiding, then bring them back to his office to rest while he contacts next of kin or finds a solution through the many wizarding families he’s come to know. Many of which are very happy to help the great Harry Potter. It’s very much like DCFS or CPS or specifically in the UK, the Department for Children, Schools and Families. It’s tough work but it’s very rewarding in a way that being an auror isn’t to him. He gets to save kids all the time, no one knows about what he does because he spends very little time on scene and he feels good about the progress he makes.
part of the magical and unenchanted community, compared to the wizards in the UK who see themselves as entirely separate, binary concepts. You aren’t a person—you’re a witch/wizard OR a muggle, whereas in the US, you’re an American who is also a witch or wizard. It creates a very isolated, detached experience I think, for better or worse. So far this is the chapter I'm most nervous about and have fiddled with the most so hopefully it makes sense. There's a lot of organic stuff in here compared to canon.
Draco pushed him off, mind overloaded with the sense that he now knew how Harry Potter, object of his misaligned affections kissed, and tried again, “Harry James Potter if you don’t explain yourself right now—”
“Do you know why I tell you that you’re brave?”  They were at the park by the palace, the one with the big reflecting pond that he’d never been able to remember the name of, Hide or something, having already walked all the way past the other underground station near their neighborhood. There weren’t many muggles out at this hour and those that were were jogging or older, sitting at the benches. Already there was one woman reading on a blanket catching the first unfiltered rays of sunlight on the great open lawn. Someone once told him, he thinks it might have been Blaise of all people, that it was originally a hunting ground and that at one point an elaborate crystal palace had been erected there. But now instead it was a park and a man in fluorescent spandex rode past them on his bicycle.
“I live in Washington DC, near where the magical governmental buildings are, but I’m from Vermont,” Cynthia said, which were more words that didn’t make much sense to Draco, “Though I feel like I’m getting tired of living in the swamp¹—the weather is god-awful in the summer, so this is really nice.”
They’d apparated directly into Harry’s office, something he wasn't sure how they did but he was grateful for, a small but cozy space between the second (Department of Magical Law Enforcement) and third (Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes) levels, Harry described as he set Lacey down on the tiny couch by the fireplace. His tone was smooth and soothing. “Makes it harder for people to find me,” he added with a grin at Draco who stared blankly back at him. The grin had disappeared.
following you, would you think that I would start my search in the Tottenham Court Road Tescos? It’s not even a fully fledged one, just an express.”
“Nah,” Thomas drawled, “In Chicago—” and that word seemed to stretch beyond its letters, “—We have over a hundred different neighborhoods, and some of them are named after the immigrants that moved there, Greektown, Andersonville for the Swedes, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Lithuanian Plaza, Pilsen, Polish Village. It may not be as ‘fancy’ as New York but that’s what you get for being the city of broad shoulders.”
“Both,” he amended, “Either.” Harry laughed, draining the rest of the wine glass as the placed the half unwrapped sweets on the porcelain plate. He filled another glass before walking back over with all three somehow balanced with that seeker’s sense of grace he seemed to retain.
“So do you both live in Chicago?” Draco asked as they set a far more relaxed pace to the restaurant.
“Leave the house and never or rarely contact you again.” Something sharp and painful twisted in his gut. “It can be a very natural reaction for adopted or fostered children, especially if they realize their parents or foster parents are not what they seem to be.” She watched him very carefully, watching to see that old part of him rear up and prove her right. He almost wanted to let it, just for some relief from that inscrutable gaze.
Silence fell in the street as the last one hit the ground, stunned into submission. Just the sounds of Harry’s harsh breathing, and the ringing in his ears, the heat from the sun and the explosion and the familiar ache of dueling settling into his arms. It was over.
It could have been an hour or maybe four, but it seemed to pass all too fast because Harry was standing in front of him and stretching.
“Right,” he finally snapped to it, “You’re free to go then. Let me know when you have the statement ready Auro— Mr. Potter,” Potter raised an eyebrow. “Please?”
“For the most part, yes,” Harry answered, used to the oddity that was the wizarding world. “There are some desperate areas but muggles can’t get into them.”
it mates? My own bloody place,” he enthused, swaying towards Harry’s side and pulling Draco with him.
, Draco looked up with the thought, a little startled by the green eyes staring back at him, “I hope you’ll stick around for more than just interior design.”
the pain and the abuse and the fear and if he gave any of that up, he’d only have himself to blame. He’d read, somewhere, that some outside force would only tap on your shoulder a few times to show you the way, and if you didn’t heed it, it was your own fault. He could give a toss what anyone else thought. He was
He hadn’t lost time in a while. Not since the height of the war. He forgot how exhausted he felt after, wasn’t sure he’d ever remembered feeling this awful. He fixed his hair, as best he could without his usual products. A glamor would help.
And though this is rough, I always think back to John Darnielle’s tweet threads on the song “This Year”. A yearly
I wasn’t okay. I’d won after all. I’d killed or destroyed all of them, including Voldemort and I’d put away the rest. So why wasn’t I fine? Why wasn’t I happy with her? Why why why?” He went to hit the wall for effect, in his pacing, but all the fight went out of him in the same breath.
“It is pretty brilliant, visiting new places after hearing about them for so long,” Harry agreed, leading them down the street to where the point had been set up. “You’re going to like the area as well, it’s near the family courts in Temple, quite lovely buildings and gardens.”
Early bonus before Monday because I’m stuck working from home until MID APRIL and I’m bored already :-)
“Those are… very serious crimes,” she said, “And how could we assume a child such as Rebecca would be safe in your care based on these crimes?”
it’s right, which I think is a key difference between Gryffindor and Slytherin. Being an auror, there’s some gray area— you uphold the laws but based on the last wizarding war, the law isn’t always right and changes based on who’s in power. I’m not sure that Harry would be able to reconcile that and it would leave him a lot of angst. Being a public figure didn’t help either, because people would just sway and agree with whatever he said. So he decided to forge his own path and build something where he knew he would always be on the side of good. It’s like the best version of the ‘Think of the children’ fallacy.
“Oh don’t be,” she said, an impish smile growing, her faint Irish accent lilting over the sounds of chatter and laughter around them, “I only make exceptions for those who keep me locked in their mansions.”
Hardy stared at him, and with how close they were, it was easy to see the flecks of warm, golden hazel hidden in the green of his eyes.
“Actually,” Potter interjected, a slightly amused curl to his lips, “Auror Weasley said I could take both of them in for their statements, as this would fall under
of the curse. It was similar in build to a standard tripwire explosion curse, something nearly every dark family knew and rarely perfected. There was the intent, the trigger, all of the parts, just simmering below the surface of the old brick. He could sense, more than see, the direction it was facing as he passed his wand over it, the familiar motions of his work.
They digressed for a moment into weather, comparing the coolness of the summer and describing the features of similarities of their native cities (rivers, they all had them nearby though all admitted swimming in them was a poor idea) and the differences of lakes or ocean.
“One and the same. It affected not only muggles but wizarding communities, well, not as much, but still enough to be mentioned. In the United States it was actually worse for the magical community there. First, there was a huge amount of people affected by various diseases, magic and otherwise. The Spanish flu, polio, Dragon Pox, extreme poverty some would even say, they were hit by all of them. It’s actually rather fascinating, I was reading a book on the research team behind the cure for—“
“At first, it was alright. It was very clear and, you would definitely guess this, but after the trials, it felt good to be doing something that actually was putting away bad people.” Draco rolled his eyes just very slightly and Harry grinned at him, more pleased than he'd seen him all day and he felt his face flush, “Exactly what I thought you’d do. It’s very on brand.”
Abstractly, Draco knew who Liza Wentworth and John Abernathy were. He’d seen them in Harry’s office and dropping off case files and shadowing him on the rare cases where his and Harry’s jobs aligned. And he knew the basic facts about them, enough to where if he had to report them missing to an aurora, he probably could do it.
“Shh, shh, Rebecca,” and Harry wrapped her in a hug as she started to sob, “I’ve got you... I’m not going anywhere...”
Draco would never understand them. But at least Harry was giving him that grin, the one that said how much he enjoyed when Draco got annoyed again at his celebrity status; it was oddly settling.
“Merlin, must you do that?” Draco turned around to argue with him. Potter just seemed to grin in return, as if this wasn’t an odd thing.
“Here we are,” Harry interjected neatly, saving them all from embarrassment, opening the door for them, letting them file in and then ducking around them to talk to the hostess. They were led to the back of the restaurant, near a quiet table that was their usual when they ate here, this time four instead of two. It was time for dinner.
“So, Thomas, what do you do in Mage-USA?” He finally said as the murmuring lulled, so as not to comment on their lack of manners. Where he and Harry where using both the fork and knife in tandem, the Americans seemed to only pick up one utensil at once—very odd.
Therefore, they created all these super complex, delicate and dark Magic’s to supplement natural talent. It’s kind of like this: dogs can be bred for specific traits, giving us unique breeds. However, go too deep into it and all of the niche breeds have health problems abound and don’t last long. Mutts will outlive anything as far as I can tell and it’s the same with Wizards. Pure bloods created this class of hereditary, monetary status but the natural talent, the natural abilities were squelched. So yeah: when you breed out instinct, you lose that ease of use.
“Well you know Neville, once he sets his mind on something these days, he goes all in.” And it was true. The man was far different from the boy, taking reform at Hogwarts to do away with the bullying and badgering by teachers as his own personal mission. Of course, no one had been as bad as Severus had been (excluding the final year) but it was still common for teachers to make…an example of their pupils. He wondered what the rest of the old guard had thought, though most were retired at this point. “And it’s actually given them a bit of an edge over St. Augustine’s, they still use physical punishments for severe issues.”
“Sounds a bit like the European Union,” Harry chimed in, squinting a bit as he said it, “That thing the Muggle papers keep writing about—it’s sort of like a version of that.” ¹ Hermione nodded, while Draco was lost, maybe he should start reading the Muggle papers as Harry did. At least Ron looked as lost as he did, the ginger shooting him a shrug, as if to say, ‘That’s what ‘Mione is for.’ Now, here he was, Draco Malfoy, of those Malfoy’s, in the same boat as a Weasley. He was certain if Father had become a ghost he would have died of shock.
Draco wasn’t sure what to feel, so he resorted to what he knew, the safe comfortable shell he’d spent years cultivating. He opened his mouth to make a cutting remark but Weasley, apparently, beat him to it.
“There was more to it though, aside from the breakdown, there were the nightmares, terrible dark nightmares, losing people, losing the war— I was having nightmares almost every night of the week, my voice was hoarse from waking up screaming. And then there were fights, loud rows in Gin’s place, she wasn’t sleeping because of me and I wasn’t sleeping and we just... I started— they got worse." He could see the effort it took to swallow down the feelings, to try and complete the message, as he shifted back and forth, aimless and anxious. "Worse than before the end of the war— I’d wake up hoarse from screaming. And once... once I woke up with my hands around her neck, so sure that she was Bellatrix. She tried after that. She really did. But I think... I think she didn’t understand
He told him an abridged version, starting at the very beginning with the first encounter in Patel’s, skirting any discussion of Harry’s past out of respect and ending with their heated confession and plans for the day that would include Draco cutting this off before it ended poorly. To his credit, the other man didn’t react much, except to clarify the timeline and to occasionally shake his head or nod. By the end of it, he was exhausted, despite it only having been 20 minutes, the events having taken, he now realized, over the better part of a year.
It felt like the sort of day that would never end. By now, they (mostly the Americans) had worked their way through bread and through some appetizers, now waiting on their main dishes with glasses of rich Spanish Rioja on the table.
“Yeah?” Harry brightened, mouth twisting into a grin, one he almost always wore on the good days, because he somehow knew that Draco’s own mouth would twist in a similar way after awhile. His own traitorous facial muscles gave a twitch.
but it didn’t mean that this, this good and bright thing just beyond the glass and wood wasn’t worth it.
“Well, green but I’m looking to go with a blue. Eventually.” He ponders this, looking at the row of dish sets, book set on a lower level of dish ware in a ghastly mustard. Suddenly he feels so tired, giving his opinion to someone who cares not one iota about him, exhausted from lack of sleep, sleepy from sitting in the weak autumn sun earlier. Almost as if this short interaction had used up the last of his energy. But look at the plates he did and—
The next day, they both took their Saturday to walk through the neighborhood, looking at the houses there as they talked.
“Why wouldn’t I help you?” Like it was that simple. The dull tattoo on his exposed forearm stung though he knew the tissue was long dead.
Soon the desks were covered in the case files as well, two cork boards being conjured up and items being tacked to them. Draco barely even noticed Harry sitting next to him. It was easier to focus on that than his feelings on the matter, they would soon fade to the background anyway.
“It’s not—” Draco swallowed hard. The lump in his throat was full of everything he knew but didn’t want to say. Because he was despoiling Harry, who’d had a hard life and how do you tell anyone why you’re doing something insane for the right reasons.
“Isn’t that doing it to spite me?” Draco asked, tracing the silver frame next to the potted plant where Lily and James Potter, now younger than them both, waved at him among the autumn leaves, “Or, rather, imaginary me.”
Here and there, he would cancel a dinner or a meetup or a pub afternoon, even if he desperately needed it, instead reading alone in his flat. He took longer to respond to the owls or would miss floo calls entirely. He went to one more outing of Hogwarts graduates, just to fulfill his promise, before declining them ever since. Though invited, he never went back to Harry’s office snug between the second and third floor and he never went back to his flat, sure if he even took one step he would just fall harder and his hard work would be undone. He never outright lied, because that would be admitting that what he was doing was wrong when it wasn’t.
Like damn. You can also make the case for that T.S. Eliot quote about the greatest treason but this is fic, we talk about pop punk/indie music here. Accept no substitutes. Patton quotes, dimly referenced, are just fine though.
“She’s doing alright, a small fracture in her wrist but nothing I couldn’t fix up,” he looked down at the girl and gently brushed her wet hair back from her face, “How are you doing Draco?”
The punishment was nearly like a great trial itself, his way of proving to the rest of the Wizarding World that yes, even the son of an esteemed Death Eater, could change back into a member of society. But that had been over for more than a year at this point. There was no point in dwelling on it.
be true,” Draco agreed as they paused on the other side of the street, looking up the endless avenues, not yet filled with cars. “Would you want it to be?”
His mother had been no help, latching onto the secret thought as a niffler did on coin and demanding to know every detail. He was tempted, with a dark streak of humor that matched the slush on the edges of his robes, to tell her exactly who had gone and torn his heart to ribbons, if only to make her stop in fright but the faint warning of her heart stopped him.
“Me neither.” Harry swallowed, hard, around the lump in his throat. “We should talk, though, because…” He trailed off, the wetness in the corners of his eyes transmuting into tears, “Because I don’t want this to be our together.”
All there was was silence. He watched the blood drip onto the floor while Lacey tried to see. He couldn’t let her. He turned back out, and nearly ran into the tall auror again.
agreed, I just nodded,” he added back, setting the teacup in its saucer. The biscuits, dry as always, sat untouched in the center of the table. She nearly huffed but merely wiped the lipstick off the rim of her cup. Even now, she was bound by manners and duty and
After that, the rest of the evening passed in a bit of blur, which could have been due to the second bottle of wine they finished over the course of their discussion. Who would owl who. Who would file for what. What papers needed copies. Ron kept busy with refilling and adjusting things, adding his own opinion, asking the obvious questions. The Golden Trio at work again, as if no time had passed.
“I was reading, in the park, earlier...” There wasn’t really a big park nearby, not like he’d seen the Muggles really do but it was enough for a few benches and it let him sit in peace.
Harry’s laughter next to him was warm and close. They kept walking, even though they were in a wizarding neighborhood and could part at any time.  “Sorry I sprung this on you.”
By the time they had called for and Draco had been dispatched, there wasn’t much he could do. Yes, he had experience with these specific curses, but once the victim was dead, there was nothing even he could do, it was an exercise in futility. He recognized the Carrows handiwork of course, the cold chill sitting along his spine like a coiled serpent, which was what made them hard to detect. You never knew how bad it was until it was tripped and then it it hit you like a bludger to the face. There was no avoiding it at a certain point, you had to let it run its course.
“Why— why would you say that? You love Rebecca as much as I do—” He could feel the carefully constructed view that Harry had fall apart before him, watching the blocks tumble out of place.
in his flat (which was tastefully decorated and full of things in the opposite way that someone else’s was not) and he visited his aunt and his distant nephew on New Year’s with mother and he spent time at lunch with Harry and time at the pub with Harry and occasionally with Ronald and he dropped off the drunken oaf as before and exchanged nods with Weasley-Granger and complained to Harry over post about his coworkers and everything,
“You’re going to have to take a step back ‘Mione, Draco might have heard of UMNAS but Harry’s in the dark,” Ron reminded her, squeezing her shoulder before going to get more wine and some crisps.
“I remember a distant cousin of mine talking about him— he’d spent time in the States and really admired the bloke, was practically a saint to him.”
When Harry wakes up, not 20 minutes later, Draco’s taken charge of holding the girl, and the waiting room has emptied out a bit, enough where it’s no longer a dull roar.
“I think you’ve picked an odd day to hide away in your office and snog, Harry,” he said, deflecting so he could snort and call him some sort of teasing name and they could go up to be torn to shreds. Well, he would. Harry would likely walk away with a glowing review.
Anyway, that’s my thoughts on the matter. At some point, the team will probably expand to a whole network of people like him and he’ll get to retire quietly, knowing he’s left something behind for the better and with zero press coverage until after he dies. Not a bad end for the Boy Who Lived. Bonus points for anyone who finds the LotR reference in these and double bonus points if you can get all the Harry Frodo parallels in the two.
He wasn’t sure why it had affected him so much, the war was so far in the past, the antagonism of the seven years spent leading up to it so long behind him, even his father’s death was more than two years ago. In a way, he was angry.
“Will do, cheers,” and using some sort of inherent magic that came with being Harry Fucking Potter, moved the little group, Lacey in his arms, down to the end of the laneway, heading to the apparition point that had been set up earlier. Draco wasn’t sure what to say, considering that Potter had just lied to get him away from the scene for clearly some obscure purpose only known to him and without much more to add, he was just following. Mostly because he was sure if he tried to speak or deviated from the simple instructions, he would end up losing this mornings half eaten breakfast into the gravel road.
It had taken all of his strength and the better part of an hour but he’d eventually sent Harry home. He hadn’t wanted to but he was still drunk as anything and Draco didn’t want this mutual confession to be a spur of the moment thing, regardless of how little they talked.
Instead of a large mansion secluded from wizarding and muggle society, it was a modest three flat on a quiet residential street. It was almost pedestrian how calm and muggle the street was; that the entire area seemed to be hushed but in a natural and peaceful way. It was outside of any war, muggle or wizard, and it would seem that it had been that way for a long while.
Here he was, floating along peacefully, following the march of time and along came Potter and his laundry list of issues and memories that Draco didn’t want. He’s put so much of it behind him, so much of it dead and buried that to resurrect it was truly a violation of the natural order of things. He didn’t want it and Potter had no business doing it.
She nodded, “Specifically, the Magical Child Protection Act of 1987. It’s dense but it essentially created three rules: one, that children have as much rights to be safe, treated fairly and cared for by adults of sound mind and reasoning. Two, that schooling must be adequate in all things necessary for adulthood, now including things like taking care of yourself, filing taxes, that sort. Three, it is the duty of the Department of Magical Child Services to determine if these needs are being met and if not, to place children in schools and homes that fill these needs. The actual text is far denser but that’s the premise.” Harry nodded slowly.
“We really appreciate you coming to help us prepare, Miss Wallis,” Harry added, with a winsome smile.
“You do like reading,” Harry added, patting his ankle again before getting up and heading to the freezer to get the sweets while Draco watched him over the arm of the chair. This was his favorite kind of night— just the two of them and pleasant discussion. He wasn't sure he would ever get used to the feeling.
something going on, with a man, who you’re not ashamed of but ashamed to be in a relationship with?”
It was almost a death eater mask, but not quite. The face too long, the colors too bold with bright blue swirls and shapes, but the gaping, stitched maw was the same. Draco froze.
Harry shared a look with Draco before turning back to Hermione and taking his hand in the one not holding the wine glass.
pure gets us an even higher 62,000 GBP per 1000 Galleons to play with (and a total wealth of 2.7M GBP), the price of a flat in Pimlico in 2000 (average around 337,000GBP, which isn’t a great measure considering that the price would vary across the neighborhood, the various schools, how many rooms, etc and median would work better but we’re guesstimating here) and now (roughly 1.1M GBP) is greatly different so you’re going to have to believe with me on this one that for 2-3,000 galleons Harry Potter bought a small two room flat in a decent but not great area of muggle Pimlico in the year 2000 by unwittingly using economics. Maybe from a Y2K fanatic or a Euro fanatic, either way being mobbed at a wizarding bank to go quietly pay cash for a house doesn’t seem like his bag, so assume he went to a muggle bank and walked out with enough to lay down some fat stacks.
“Wait,” Weasley interjected, removing his robes to reveal a Weasley Jumper and less decent jeans than Harry’s (by Draco's measure), “I can’t have a pint—it has to be wine.”
“And so, eventually,” Draco said, pointing with his wine glass, while Harry watched him, bemused, his hand resting on his pale ankle, thumb rubbing the delicate bone, as they sat across from one another on their loveseat, “You complete yourrrrr...A Levels—“
the protection magic to work. He needed me to become who I am. Professor McGonagall tried to stop him— tried to convince him but... Dumbledore— The wizarding world, they needed their savior.” Harry’s shoulders sagged, the weight upon them, five years old now, still too great. He thought about how after, when McGonagall became headmistress, how much Harry had spent talking about her with pride. Who did he wish she was? A friend? An aunt? Anyone?
called for. Honestly, you two are perfect—he’s got a hero complex and you’ve developed some sort of martyr complex. Ridiculous,” Blaise crossed his arms and fixed him with a look. Draco bristled.
This was one of the hardest chapters for me to write, a lot of it being me suffering from some writer’s block and some backsliding in my own personal headspace. Writing this helps though, so here’s an extra large chapter to make up for it.
He missed her as much as Draco did, perhaps even more. Something in him called to her, a protective and fierce part he knew was family, in the way that that part had called to Ron and Hermione, and to Sirius and to Remus and Tonks and now to Teddy.
There was silence, as they both walked past a shop opening up for the day, the loud metal grating being pushed up by a thin Chinese woman and releasing the smell of fresh cut flowers spilling onto the sidewalk.
“Slept through the whole thing,” Thomas added in a deep voice with an even broader accent than hers. Near them a ‘plane’ went roaring over them. He winced at the sound. No one else seemed to have any reaction.
custody. I would like to petition as well for custody—Rebecca will be perfectly fine with us until we send her off to St. Augustine’s after her birthday. Then she can get a
They’re waiting in line for the entrance, stuck in the lunch crowd and attracting stares, as former members of the golden trio and death eaters are wont to do, when it strikes Draco how—
is who you’ve been seeing after work?” He asked incredulously, the tiredness apparent in his voice dampening the scorn and distrust that normally lived there.
“Which is why you call it Project Circumference?” Harry posited, stealing one of Draco’s gnocchi. It was a common occurrence so he didn’t even blink, but the throbbing in his head made it so he didn’t give him a half-hearted glare as he usually would. Harry didn’t notice the lack of response.
She waves her hands, bushy hair swaying as she does it, “Pupil counts determine funding and allocations, all the sort of governmental issues duplicated as budget is being moved from one country to another. I’ve been searching through different historical texts, trying to find similar precedent that we can use— the main core of their case law sadly does
Rebecca shakes her head, and really, her hair is going to be a knitted mess at this rate, “Just some things. Words people think a lot. And only if we’re touching or I know them really really well. Bobby Airs at school always said I was faking but I’m not!” She shook her head more. “I’m not!! I’m not!! I’m not!!”
Narcissa’s hair was more gray, streaking and aging beautifully, and her eyes had a few more wrinkles when she offered a rare smile, but for the most part she was unchanged. She still dressed the same, wore the same bergamot perfume from Italy, hugged him just as tightly when he left as if he were going to disappear once out of her sight. Every time it felt like the first time they’d left to take him to Hogwarts. They’d waited in the foyer for Father before heading to the station, his mother asking him if the house elves had packed this, or if he was planning on doing that when he arrived and he remembered being very cross to hide how terrified he was to be leaving.
Their lives, so similar, so different, could be defined by that silence. By all the things they wanted to say but didn’t. By all the things that were implied or inference or hinted at. If silence was truly worthy of a dragon’s hoard, then they were rich ten times over.
“Draco, what’s your problem? Why are you acting like…” He paused, looking for the words that Draco knew he wanted and was trying to substitute. Even now, that was how Harry still categorized him. Months of whatever this was, wasted. He wasn’t sure what hurt more.
It had been almost four years since Draco had first seen Harry in Patel’s Emporium. In that time, Harry had asked him to move in with him and they’d had at least four fights about money or rent. But sometimes, when they were at the pub after a long day, snipping at each other and slowly working their way to another shouting match, Draco or Harry would stutter to a stop and look at one another and realize how far they’d come and how much they preferred being
and walk in. It’s nearly empty, just a few men in union work trousers quietly drinking beer in the corner, one very solemn woman drinking at the bar. A tourist family making noise in the other corner.
“At least to people who know me as more than the Boy Who Lived and the Boy Who Defeated the Dark Lord,” Harry gave a wan smile. “More tea?”
“Very funny,” Harry replied, with a dry tone, giving him a thin smile, “You seem to be in good spirits.” Luckily, he couldn’t hear the constant racing of Draco’s heart, a failing of being the Chosen One, he supposed. “You know what to say right? And you remember what Cynthia said, trying to keep your answers as brief as possible.”
“Draco?” Harry knocks on the bathroom door, sounding a bit annoyed. “We’re going to run through the changes we’re planning downstairs. Join us soon, please.” The footsteps fade off down the stairs and Draco is staring at himself in the mirror. The sink gushing water and his own breath fogging up his image.
Harry turned and stared at him. There was maybe two meters of space between them but he could have sworn he could feel the other man just as close as they were earlier when they were fighting in the alley.
“Well,” Harry pauses, placing his other hand on top of hers, where her freckled pale skin is tightly gripping his far darker wrist, “I’m not sure what you mean... can you tell me?”
running about, half of them marked with some kind of chalk from one of the wizards running the overrun intake desk. There was a wide variety of colors, ranging from black to red to orange to yellow to green, and once they’d pulled and pushed their way to the desk, they were shouted over and given green marks after a quick spell to check over the them and sent in the direction of the over crowded chairs, nearly getting run over by a large group of Portuguese tourists all shouting in Portuguese while the official kept shouting back in English and Celtic that a translator was on the way.
“Tell me about it,” Harry let out a huff that normally would be a laugh, “It’s weird, having all that money.” He wisely said nothing. Money had been a given in his life, and even without that, the status of the name he bore.
“Mummy!” She sobbed, paying no attention to Draco, instead reaching out for her mother who struggled more in reaction to her daughters cries, he yanked her back, holding the struggling girl as her mother kept reaching, the mirrors pulling her hair back. He couldn’t wave his wand and do much while still holding the daughter.
Harry noticed him scrutinizing him and looked slightly affronted at, what Draco assumed was, his utter expression of scrutiny and disbelief at his lack of propriety. It was, with some pride, an expression often reserved for either the boy-who-lived’s utter lack of knowledge, or conversely, the obscure and pointless knowledge he seemed to have.
“We will make sure to pull the reports,” he added, “To verify their accuracy.” Draco nodded, remembering he had forgotten or rather couldn’t eat breakfast this morning, his stomach twisted so poorly he wasn’t sure it would ever accept food again.
”  Harry caught up to him but that only made Draco increase his pace, his eyes firmly focused on the ground as his vision swam a bit at the edges. If he started bloody
Now why were they together, when the anger and hatred boiled up so easily, when harsh words were so common, when everything was falling apart, how were they even together? He could have left at any time, just picked up his things and gone, but having Harry, even when they were spitting angry, was better than not.
They each watch other a moment. Harry has soot across his face and his sleeve is ripped in several places—the blood long ago now coagulated, his broken glasses and singed hair. At least he looks more settled around the chaos of Processing, the walk and purpose doing him good. Draco’s certain he looks a sight: his trousers are certainly torn, with grime dug into the knees where he’d had to dodge a stinging hex, only complimenting his burnt hair and sliced up left side, and his lovely pale slate sweater he’d bought at the Galleries Lafayette with the twisting cabled vines completely ruined. But that doesn’t stop Harry from reading his mind, apparently.
“By the end of the month, I couldn’t go anywhere and not see enemies and death eaters in every corner. I was arguing with everyone, fighting with my friends, with Gin, even with Mrs. Weasley,” he swallowed thickly as if he had just admitted the greatest treason. “With Gin it was worse—I would get angry and she would respond and then we would be screaming at each other and then something would explode as if I were still eleven and she’d spend the night at a friend’s place. She gave it a real go after but by the end of the month we were broken up and I was turning in my resignation.”
The person Cynthia is referring to is 104 year old Frances Hasselbein, who fell into managing the Girl Scouts of America and sort of popularized a form of management called Circular Management, which is exactly as Cynthia describes. Frances basically only took the jobs she took because people asked and really needed her and sort of fell into an amazing career. Fascinating stuff and fascinating life for a woman who by her own admission never intended to do much more than raise a family and never went to college but now has 23 honorary degrees and an even more fascinating life story.
“—Enemies at first sight, no thanks to my younger self—“ which causes the table to break into laughter, almost as if this were a comedic play.
To love, in all of its parts, good and bad and tiring and fierce and dismal and joyous and still work at it.
No one else approaches them, but no one stares outright or glares either. It’s a warm feeling, surrounded by Harry’s friends and getting a little tipsy and actually promising to come to the next one, though hopefully in a more convenient pub. It’s not perfect, not by a long shot. Sometimes the conversation stalls and they all remember, at different times, the war they shared. If you asked him the next day, he wouldn’t be able to tell you what they talked about, only that he knew that Harry had rested a warm, nimble hand on his lower back no less that seven times. It’s far better than he could have imagined, so he’s not at all surprised that when he begs off (with a regret so unavailable during the firm Christmas Party) that he’s glad Harry offered to walk him home not out of obligation but out of a night well spent.
“I’m Harry Potter, and this is my partner, Draco Malfoy,” Draco gave her a smile, which he hoped properly conveyed ‘concerned but trustworthy adult,’ “And it’s nice to meet you. Do you remember what happened?”
“Anyway, that was the start of the magical government which, as Harry said, wasn’t formalized until the American revolution. Schooling was regional and mirrored the state system, which is very unlike here. Essentially, each state has their own sub level of government that reports to the federal government, within reason of course.”
“You can’t base your decisions now on things that may not happen. All you’d be doing is making sure the worst will always happen.”
Until it was right before the anniversary of his father’s death and amidst the happiness of daily life, he slammed right into a wall of sadness and grief, a swath of emotions that left him angrier than he’d ever been. It’d been
“Let me finish,” he says, gently, and he swallows down the fear, remembering Blaise and Ronald and his mother telling him how she wants him
decided to give it a go,” Draco retorted, straightening his silverware, playing his part perfectly, “What he’s not letting you know is that he thought we were dating for a month, despite having never asked.” The two Americans laughed at the punchline, he was getting good at setting up the familiar joke,
At times like these, he’d wished he’d taken even a year of Muggle Studies, just so he wasn’t lost when they referred to their pieces of plastic as
“I won’t lie and say it’s easy, but I couldn’t possible see myself doing anything else,” he said, a soft smile on his face. Absently, as he traced the tines of his unused salad fork, he wondered if he himself was happy at work. He supposed so. No where near as happy as Harry, but that was his lot in life.
. And then, as if she were admitting some great secret, “I honestly can’t believe I’m here, I’ve visited Les Corps des Magies in France and Der Chancellor Zauber, and then of course, the Canadian Prime Minister and the Mexican President, and Tommy’s been in charge when the Polish Prime Minister visits, But I’ve never had a chance to visit England before! It’s so exciting, like stepping back in time.” Now it was Draco’s turn to be shocked. Aside from the international confederation, the wizarding government mostly kept to themselves. At least in Britain.
Draco and Harry picked up their pace after a shared glance. “We’re excited to get started, we’ve been researching the UK all week.” Very chatty too.
“Exactly,” he nodded, “So we handle anything a state can’t through their police force or if the crimes cross into other states or into breaking federal laws. Like if you were dealing in cursed objects and selling them without a license, that would be a state police matter. We would get involved if you started a crime syndicate selling those cursed items globally.” Perhaps Draco had broken more than just moral laws in the past—he wasn’t unaware of any issues selling items across Britain.
name in all of London, Ronald raising both eyebrows, “Draco, that was uncalled for.” Draco could hear the voice in his head, the sensible one, drowned out by the ocean roaring in his ears.
, I will follow you back to your place for what better be a good explanation.” When had they gotten so close? Draco crossed his arms to give them some familiar distance.
In some ways, he pitied his Mother. He would look at her, struggling to speak her mind after years of conditioning and wonder if this was what she’d wanted. If she could have seen the path life would take stretching out in front of her, would she still pick Lucius out of love? Or out of duty?
“Here,” Harry finally said, saving them all from the possible small talk that might have started, and Draco once again thanked Merlin for his partner’s preternatural ability to interject that the most inopportune times for the people around him, “It’s 4 quid and 20 p right?”
On the counter sat two Mars Bars, a packet of crisps, and something called a Toblerone, which Draco was most intrigued to try, considering it came wrapped in a fancy gold box. Above him, the light flickered the way that all Muggle lights did and he tried to will it to stop, rather than complain about it, as he had before in the last corner shop they visited.
There’s a morbid fascination with the spectacle of failure he’s about to go through, like passing an auto collision.
“It’s from last week,” Rebecca said around the chocolate, “I fell on my bike on my way to school. Clarence’s Mum gave me the plaster. She’s a muggle.”
“I think that’s the official list,” he finished lamely. John finished his note. Liza finally stopped looking and read over his shoulder and nodded. He didn’t feel lighter for having admitted it. He only knew that it was the constant weight of his crimes, fresh and new and forever his.
—he cursed Weasley for coining such a phrase with a viscous kick to a snow bank as he crossed the road—
Irish aurors, mostly in green with a white and orange Celtic pattern down the side, appeared to start turning the tide against the coordinated attack, streaming in from the high street and apparating into the area.
He watched as Harry hardened in front of him, his eyes no longer friendly and loving, stuck in this mire.
“Their names? What do you need that for?” Draco lost all of his short patience there, turning on the man, the stress of the day coming out while warm rain dropped down his collar.
He had to focus on this curse though, ignoring the bile rising in his throat and the panic cresting in him. The curse, the curse and
Harry bent over, laughing into the ground before standing up and saying to the sky, “God, Draco, don’t ever change.”
“I bet you say that to all the former death eaters,” came the retort before he could stop it. He wasn’t even drinking yet.
The world looked like an explosion of riotous color and the amount of magic in the air was thick enough to taste. Draco’s felt himself tire far sooner than he remembered.
That power extended to making friends and allies as well, Blaise was popular and cool enough at work that any favor he asked would be fulfilled, rain or shine and without the need to bribe, coerce or threaten anyone. Draco never had that in him, or at least didn’t know how to begin where it didn’t take every ounce of his patience, resolve and ability to not roll his eyes. But he was better off alone regardless.
“I want to know how far are you going to go with this— we don’t even know if the courts will allow it,” he said again, volume rising past polite to firm as he sat up straight in his chair, a sharp contrast to the man across from him, who seemed to lounge more upon the couch. Insolent and uncaring of Draco’s own opinions on the matter it seemed.
—honestly drowning himself in the sink was looking to be the best option since his brain had run mutinous) mind that Draco go with him. Into the veritable lion’s den, with only Harry and by some
“Exactly!” She beamed and Harry looked as if he’d been given ten house points for the right answer. “It’s tough project, there’s a lot of very old fashioned people we have in the department and a lot of, well, recalcitrant superintendents who think it’s all some new age, feelings-based voodoo. But I think it could really improve the student’s lives and that makes it all worthwhile, I think.”
And then she had been hugging him, tight and close and warm and it smelt so strongly of that bergamot and the manor that he’d nearly burst into tears then as he stood there in shock.
It served a reminder that the Harry that stood next to him was not beyond saving, that the two were not sides of a coin forever at opposite and diametrically opposed ends, but a softening, a blurring of two contrasting colors into a new one. Draco admired it, that someone who had felt so much hate had come out of it with so much care and love. He could have gone the opposite direction, turned his back on them all. Punished them. It wasn’t perfect, Harry’s angry confession had said as much, but there was love and hope. And hope was worth it, if it were placed in the right people. Gods, was it worth it.
He pulled out his wand and cast the glamor over the one he already had for his dark circles. In the mirror, Draco looked far better and more put together now. The redness on his face faded away until he looked as he usually did. What he usually looked like before all of this. He wished he were home, for as little as it would stay home. Would the Camden place ever fill that space?
“I am sorry,” he said after a short silence, with true sincerity because he did truly feel it, even if he didn’t cast the curses or kidnap her himself, because he was at fault for believing it, “For—” He paused, an unfortunate habit he seems to have picked up from Harry, “Everything.” She watched him over the rim of her umbrella, her blue eyes deep and probing.
“Seems like that happens with some people,” he said quietly, rubbing the numb part of his arm where the skull sat burnt white.
Hermione was tucked up on the couch a month and a half later, a pen holding together her bushy, natural hair and a glass of red wine in her hand, a stack of notes on her lap. It was weird to think that over the years they’d become friends and that it didn’t feel as odd as it should anymore that Draco Malfoy was here sitting on the squidgy loveseat of the Weasley-Granger household while Ron passed out glasses to both Harry and himself before sitting next to his wife and readjusting the piles of papers on the low, dinged coffee table.
They called themselves Mage-USA and they seemed to be as big as she had told them. For a country with a population of almost 300 million, having 16 million wizards seemed almost small now for a scope of that size.
As he walked towards where he would normally apparate from, he could feel the tiredness truly settle deep into his bones. At work, Draco would be what one would describe as a loner. He kept to himself and for good reason. Letting people in was a full effort and taxing, getting them to see beyond the name and the story and the past—it was in this way he admired Blaise and his family. If the Zabini’s had one talent in excess, it was being on the winning side, always. They had played close enough to the Death Eaters to avoid any form of setback when the Dark Lord had taken power; yet, they were far enough to avoid perjury when they said they were acting out of self preservation. They had Slytherin pride of course, but Slytherin cunning was far more valuable to them in all aspects, so they weren’t ashamed to lick boots if it served them better in the long run and left them in charge of themselves and their wealth.
), that would mean a single galleon is roughly 31 GBP (6g = 1 galleon, 28g in 1 oz, so at half gold purity 8 galleons would “equal” one “pure” oz of gold) so a thousand galleons would be equal to 31,000 GBP, so spending a few thousands galleons for a millionaire (someone took the time to calculate how much money was in Harry’s vault in the movies-and also Jo confirmed that Harry was essentially a millionaire - rough estimates would bring his ~45K Galleons to equal 1.3M GBP when converted) to buy a flat in a area that was less expensive 20 years ago is not at all out of the question.
“I can’t be certain but, I don’t think so.” He didn’t dare look at Liza and John, worried that they could see through it all, that Harry had told them something else.
Instead he strode over, pushing his slightly singed hair back into shape and with all the authority of his forebears, said in an icy tone, “What is the matter here?”
He was beyond mad, so mad, that he was calm and, if memory served him, absolutely terrifying when he wore the right expression. And, just like he remembered, Ronald grew even more pale than usual. “Uh, Malfoy—”
“Sure,” he said against all of his senses, Harry having some preternatural ability to get through his defenses, because, in for a knut, in for a galleon, and he lost the stiff posture he was using, “Let’s get a drink.”
why I went to school, spent 3.5 years and got a degree in economics to calculate fake currencies and also how you could become a millionaire with exchange rates and a LOT of patience.
It had been months now since all of this had started. The sunny day in Belfast. The small girl in Harry’s arms.
And his own smile had dimmed. Everything would be for Rebecca now. He knew it was petty but he didn’t want to share.
