"How's yer brother Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked him a lot- great with animals."
He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.
From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.
"I'll never remember this," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.
"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field," said Hermione grimly.
Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled ‘
"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!" Malfoy said loudly.
It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.
"They're in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding."
"UP" everyone shouted.
"There's nothin' that lives in the forest that'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow the trail in diff'rent directions. There's blood all over the place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night at least."
Hagrid looked furious with himself.
on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year," said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us."
You can skip this chapter if you'd like! I'm just writing this for my own personal funsies- I like doing these lil short story thingies, I'm probably going to do them from different student's point of views so I can make them my own and present them how I imagine them. If you don't like that idea, you can go ahead and skip them!
Harry was faster than Higgs- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead- he put on an extra spurt of speed--
It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it. The spoons, too. were they from the same person?
Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted jumper in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.
"This isn't safe- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on."
"That's friendly," said Harry with a small smile.
"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step toward him.
it, though!"
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.
"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm."
"What are you talking about, Dean?" asked Ron with bewilderment.
"Did you get it?" Ron asked once Harry joined them back in the common room, but seeing Harry's face, he frowned. "What's the matter?"
"Do you think it's true what they're saying about Potter?" Pansy asked him over breakfast the day before the match. The students were abuzz with the rumour that Potter was the new seeker- many people believed it to be true, but there were a few, like Pansy, who refused to believe things until they were announced to be true. Draco watched as she poured cream into his coffee, absent-mindedly playing with his eggs and ignoring Crabbe and Goyle as they stuffed themselves with sausages and bacon.
"Merry Yule!"
Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick- he hit the field on all fours- coughed- and something gold fell into his hand.
The Slytherin common room was louder than ever as outraged students gossiped about what had happened during the match.
"How did you know --?"
"Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here a moment."
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said Madam Hooch. "Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle- three- two-"
Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.
"Did you hear that?" He asked, Harry felt Malfoy's hand grab his wrist as he also looked round. Malfoy soon came back to his senses and yanked his hand away, scoffing and speeding up to walk in front of him. "Come on, Fang," He said, "Scared...Pft."
The snow still hadn't melted the next morning.
Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.
Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.
Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.
"I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh- yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel-"
Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about football. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West-Ham football team, trying to make the players move.
His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.
"What? Where?"
"Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment."
"The forest?" he repeated, and he didn't sound quite as cool as usual. "We can't go in there at night- there are all sorts of things in there! werewolves, I heard...!"
A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.
Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.
"Weird!" he exclaimed in awe, "What a shape! This is money?"
"Let's go."
There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.
"What?"
They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob- between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.
The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.
"-The big one," said Fred Weasley.
"But we've got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell's too scared to back us up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor- who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That'll take a lot of explaining."
"No... you go..."
"And women," added Chaser Angelina Johnson.
"Pretend to break your leg."
"So- back again, Harry?"
"GET OUT! OUT!"
Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.
It was enough.
"Jordan, I'm warning you-"
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul-"
"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Ron, who'd had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. "Dragons!" he whispered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide."
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees- He even saw his aunt Petunia, who looked younger and was
Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.
At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.
"Can't have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand."
Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row ("If Filch had caught you!"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
Another groan came from the Slytherin stand, Draco watched closely as the game continued.
Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.
-The Endgame Pairings are going to be the pairing tags, but if you have any more suggestions please do let me know.-
"He's just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. "Light- speedy- we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say."
"Can't, Harry- sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.
They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had been walking for a fair few minutes, when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.
"Say you're ill," said Ron.
On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
Let me know what you thought of the small additions i made to this chapter too :)
But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.
Thank you for supporting me! follow me on my instagram @/Harrypotterrewritten if you wanna be updated on when new chapters are going to be posted!
"Are you all right?" said Ron. "You look odd."
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner- what was going on?
"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid," said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"
"I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. "I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession."
Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.
"If you're not too much of a wimp~"
"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing-"
Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
HI! so if there are any mistakes in this chapter please let me know! Also, please let me know if you don't like the way I described Hermione's skin- I'm caucasian and didn't want to just describe her skin as being dark or black- if anyone finds it problematic I will change it though! Hope you enjoyed the chapter (and oblivious Harry)
Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape...
Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.
"Nothing," said Harry, maybe a little too quickly.
The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.
Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.
"You've got some nerve-" said Ron loudly.
"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you."
"There's a note!" said Ron suddenly. "A note fell out of it!"
Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.
"I knew it! I knew it!"
"Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students."
Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.
Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet.
"If you wanted to see the game, you should have purchased your own... I can't be responsible for your enjoyment." He said before he turned back around and continued to watch the players, "The commentary is enough, isn't it?"
"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said Snape silkily. "Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all of you."
"I'm not scared, Pottah." There was a noise in the distance and Malfoy quickly turned on the spot, looking around a little frantically.
(See the end of the chapter for
"-He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor McGonagall was telling Wood what had happened, "Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it."
He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air. She and the others existed only in the mirror.
"How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked.
Draco didn't answer her, Instead he broke the wax seal that showed the family crest and took out the letter. He quickly read it before he took out a polaroid photo that displayed Portia, now ten years old, receiving belly rubs from his mother. He smiled and put the letter and photo back into the envelope then opened the parcel- it was just more sweets and a book from the manor's library that he had been wanting to read.
"But who'd be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. "If you're going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?"
Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions...
Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after all. but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
"Why's Bane so angry?" he asked. "What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?"
"It's Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in while Hermione took a look at Ron's hand. "She'll have Charlie's answer!"
"I've never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. "Look- they're off Ouch!"
"Not sure- open the biggest last- that's what I always do... Oh, wicked!" Ron became distracted by the present Charlie had got him- it was a miniature dragon figure. Harry ripped the paper off the thin box and opened it carefully. Inside were four long, bronze spoons that had vines engraved onto the handles.
"Sorry, Professor."
"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort."
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn't hear of it.
"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. "It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains."
"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!"
"Sir- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?"
Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.
"I don't know, sir," said Harry.
"Red card!" Dean replied furiously. "In football you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!"
Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. "The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there."
"All right- all right-" he heard Quirrell sob.
"AAAAAAAAAARGH!"
"The what?" Harry and Ron asked in unison.
It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.
At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.
WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws- Marcus Flint had blocked Potter, and Potter's broom spun off course while he holding on for dear life.
The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger- he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.
"I don't really care if it's true or not." He replied, "And you're adding too much cream."
"Mum...?" he whispered. "Dad...?"
Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.
"It doesn't make much sense though, does it?" Ron whispered to the other three. "your punishment for being out late at night is to be out late at night... I wonder what you'll be doing?"
Lee was still commentating.
Thank you so much for reading! I'll work on my updates being faster!
"So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione. The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. "I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!"
"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started."
"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as possible."
Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him.
The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.
"Are you serious, Professor?"
"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner."
"Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too-"
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.
This chapter is pretty much the same as the book with a couple of altercations so you can just go ahead and skip this chapter if you'd like.
"But Snape's trying to steal it."
It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top:
Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
"Well, a second's there to take over if you die," said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway."
Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.
"This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We're done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts.
"Where on earth have you all been?" she asked, looking at their dressing gowns hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
"You sound like Hermione."
"Don't talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, "I need to concen-" He caught sight of Harry's face. "What's the matter with you? You look terrible."
"What was he hiding behind his back?" said Hermione thoughtfully.
"Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up."
"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air."
This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected.
"Did you see his face, the great lump?"
"SHHHH!" said Hagrid again. "Listen- come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh-"
"Bye-bye, Norbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. "Mummy will never forget you!"
"B-but I d-d-don't--"
"I'm going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. "If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape. I'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win."
"Potter!" said Snape suddenly. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
' Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it- it sounded a bit like an owl.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please," said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.
Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.
"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there."
Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
In a flash, Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.
Draco let out a gasp and leaned over the edge further, trying to get a good look at what was going on, but he suddenly felt somebody grab the back of his robe and tug him back.
"I-- don't-- want--" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, Hagrid?"
Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse- people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress.
"Snape's refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. "When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin- Is he heven allowed to referee?"
"- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes- she's really flying- dodges a speeding Bludger- the goal posts are ahead- come on, now, Angelina- Keeper Bletchley dives- misses- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"
"I won't let you in," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky stage- nothin' I can't handle."
"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!"
Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.
The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.
No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.
In this book:
"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood- I've found you a Seeker."
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.
"WEASLEY!"
Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching- he stretched out his hand- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.
Sorry this took so long :( had a bit of writer's block for a while. I reeeaally enjoyed writing this chapter and I really hope you like it! Please let me know if I should do more chapters like this from different people's perspectives because this was so much fun to do and I had to stop myself from writing more! But hey- this is for all of you wondering what Draco was doing while Harry was almost falling to his doom- here ya go!
"Hagrid," Hermione said, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?"
It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.
"I'll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what's left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
He ignored Hermione's hand.
I'm starting the book from here because I find the beginning of the book boring and there isn't much to change. If you came here to read the entire book, you've come to the wrong place- If you do wish to read it, I recommend renting at the library or buying second-hand. Please let's not give Rowling any more money :)
"I didn't know it was called that, Sir."
"You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming- he's got a dragon!"
Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.
"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy."
"Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. "It's that stupid thing Longbottom's grandmother sent him."
The other Slytherins joined in.
"No, I don't think I will, Potter... I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find- how about- up a tree?"
And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.
"-We aren't allowed brooms!"
She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
"Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we'd better go."
!" exclaimed Crabbe in return, Goyle nodding along.
"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Yule!" said Hagrid. "Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat."
"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy and Snape."
"So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?" asked Hermione in alarm.
It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die."
"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks..."
Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.
Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
"Just let him go," Harry urged. "Set him free."
"...d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus..."
Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours- but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget.
"One can never have enough socks," Dumbledore continued. "Another Yule has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books."
Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
"Oi, Draco- can I have the binoculars for a bit? i can't see properly." Draco heard Goyle ask. He pulled his eyes away from the players and looked at him with a raised eyebrow..
"Nope," said Ron. "Harry hasn't had much to do yet."
She stood up, glaring at them.
"I don't know," said Harry quietly. "I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?"
Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.
Malfoy had seen the dragon.
It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned paper bin-... but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.
"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession."
I hope you enjoyed this short little thing anyways and I managed to get a little bit of how the Dursley's abuse has affected Harry across.
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row- Snape would never know what had happened.
"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty."
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. "Report him!"
WHAM- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
"I hate that I agree with you. We should warn Higgs and tell him to be extra vigilant."
"No- no- not again, please-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can't," hissed Harry. "There isn't a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all."
"Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...."
"Clearly you all don't realize," Draco interrupted a groups' chatter, "That Potter is the golden boy of Gryffindor. He's the professors' shiny new toy. Whether he was faking that incident or not, nothing will be done about it. Gryffindor won fair and square- there are still other matches and we can still win the cup."
"Isn't it obvious? Then we can tell Terance what he's up against!" Pansy replied as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.
"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all," said Hermione.
!! TRIGGER WARNING !!
She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes... 'her eyes are just like mine', Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green- exactly the same shape, he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her shoulders with a carefree smile. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.
He finally picked up the largest package and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.
"Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors.
"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure."
Quidditch was coming up, and although he didn't have a lot to be happy about right now, Draco couldn't hide his excitement. He had loved Quidditch since he was old enough to climb onto a broom. At home, there were photos of baby Draco zooming around his nursery on a toy broomstick chasing after his puppy, Portia, which he had received from his parents for his first birthday.
Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.
"See?" whispered Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog must be guarding Flamel's Philosopher's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!"
"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered.
Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents."
In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.
Harry is a dum dum and decides to open the mysterious letter in front of his abusive family. Moral of the story, don't be like Harry.
"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.
"Potter ain't looking too good, is he?" Crabbe pointed out exactly what Draco was thinking.
"I'll get him," said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, "one of these days, I'll get him-"
house," she said blatantly.
Only Ron stood by him.
"Well, well, well," he whispered, "we are in trouble." They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.
"I-- told-- you!" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I-- told-- you!"
"about a century," said Harry, shovelling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. "Wood told me."
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.
"The whole school's out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. "Even- blimey- Dumbledore's come to watch!"
Am I re-writing the whole Harry Potter Books to be more inclusive because J K Rowling is a bitch who did the characters dirty? Yes. Is it going to be long and the whole book with the boring parts cut out? Oui. Am I up for the challenge? Si.
"Thanks, Ulysses." Draco said, then rewarded the eagle owl with a bit of bacon before it spread its wings and flew away.
His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.
"Oh, yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but he looked worried.
"It wasn't his fault, Professor-"
"Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately.
Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.
Harry slid off his back.
He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't.
"I don't know what the big deal is!" Exclaimed Pansy above the chatter, "I'm pretty sure that's a perfectly valid move!"
They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.
"It's nearly out." He ushered them inside.
"Your father would have been proud," she said. "He was an excellent Quidditch player himself."
"Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape. "Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor."
"Harry! Harry, are you all right?"
Draco and Co. watched as Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goalposts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
"It's not my fault," said Wood. "We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us."
At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.
"We should have a rematch with Potter on a different broom-
"Cheer up," said Ron, "Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?"
It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.
What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.
"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.
He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
"Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. "Bless him, look, he knows his mummy!" said Hagrid.
"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. "Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?"
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville."
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you!”
"Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. "How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?"
"Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him," said Ron bitterly.
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, "I'll come back," and hurried from the room.
Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.
He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.
"B-b-but Severus, I--"
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang- back!"
"It's too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."
"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered.
"JORDAN!"
Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror."
"I've decided to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. "He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mummy?"
"Detention!" she shouted. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you-!"
"I want Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang's long teeth.
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on around here," said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. "We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione went on. "We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you."
"He didn't
It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.
"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something."
"You haven't got a letter on yours," George observed. "I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid- we know we're called Gred and Forge."
Just as she was about to kick off the ground, however, Potter's broom stopped and just hovered there- Potter managed to climb back onto it and started diving towards the ground, people from every stand cried out- it looked like he was about to crash-
"He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll be okay- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's dressing gown for the last minute. "What?"
"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR"
"Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione.
Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.
"All right, but I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid. "So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now- that's it- an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh- so, be careful... let's go."
"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look- read that, there."
Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.
"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red card!"
"He's lost his marbles," Ron muttered in Harry's ear.
"Jus' lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. "An' what're you lot up ter?" He looked suddenly suspicious. "Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?"
"Just one," replied Hermione. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library."
"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had said. "We don't want you attacked before you have to be."
They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
Hagrid frowned at him.
He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else."
The blond lowered his gaze a little to watch as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Potter safely onto one of their brooms, but every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. And he was going to fall alright. The broom was now vibrating, Draco could see Potter's grip loosening. The rest of the Gryffindor Quidditch team were called to land and Madame Hooch got onto her own broomstick.
They pulled on their dressing gowns, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them.
"What is a wizard's duel?" Harry asked, "And what do you mean, you're my second?"
By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.
"So- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?"
"Wearing the glasses?"
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will you learn?"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.
"Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. "Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..."
"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. "And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens."
When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. "Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!"
Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him.
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?"
Harry wasn't listening.
"No- I'm alone! but I'm different... I look older- and I'm head boy!"
Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time."
"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...."
My uploads are going to get less regular but i'm hoping to post about three chapters at a time.
"It'll explain the broomstick Draco said he got."
"Never mind that now," said Harry breathlessly. "Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this..."
Snape's lips curled into a sneer.
"There's still Fluffy, though," said Hermione.
"Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. "I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"
Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again.
Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.
"Be quiet, Miss Rumman."
Lessons start and I hate Snape with my entire being.
"Well- no," Ron admitted.
Harry's heart did a somersault.
"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained.
"If we just do a bit of poking around-"
Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.
Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.
But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him.
"Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new...
At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there, and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.
It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it.
"What is it?"
Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.
The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door-- and it was locked.
They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.
"You're joking!"
Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).
"POTTER!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.
"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password's 'Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere."
"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school."
Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.
The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.
Harry winced and quickly left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.
"Both of them have no names... you think they're from the same person?" Harry asked Ron, who was unwrapping a present from Charlie.
"RUN!" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.
At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.
"Did you see his scar?"
From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, "Thanks Potter, we owe you one!"
The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
As you can see, I changed the twins' surnames. I have a very close friend who is helping me write bits of this and she let me use hers. I've never understood why Slytherin is shat on so much, so I will be including mentions of friendly Slytherins in the later chapters of this book and my re-write of the others.
Harry turned around-- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare-- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.
"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry exclaimed.
"Where?"
"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying?" said Harry. "No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it."
There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter."
"I think I know who that one's from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. "My mum. I told her you didn't expect any presents and... oh, no," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasley jumper."
"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him." said Harry.
They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.
"Hey, look- Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!"
Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
"Wait until my father hears about this." Malfoy said as they walked, "This is servants stuff!"
At eleven-o'clock Draco, Crabbe and Goyle had managed to push their way to the front of the spectator stand and were now leaning over the edge to get a good look at the players that were standing ready on the pitch below.
"I know," Ron snapped. "Don't nag."
Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
"You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly.
"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?"
"Give that here, Malfoy," Harry spoke quietly. Everyone immediately stopped talking to watch.
The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.
The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, grey hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.
Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.
"Really?" He asked as he took a sip from his glass, speaking casually. "I hadn't noticed."
"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?" said Ron finally. "If any dog needs exercise, that one does."
He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.
"Oh yeah, you're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Philosopher's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.
Is it just me who kind feels sorry for the troll lmao the poor thing just wanted to shit in peace.
Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything- except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.
All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them." There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy's face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn't miss it.
"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something."
"Good-bye," said Ron.
"Very safe, as they're both dentists, I don't think they would know anything about him, though." said Hermione.
"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am."
"An' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her- Fitch puts her up to it."
Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.
"How can it? All my family are dead... let me have another look-"
"I start training next week," said Harry. "Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret."
Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?"
They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
Peeves cackled.
A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink dressing gown and a frown.
They looked at one another.
"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.
There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.
Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goalposts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.
"Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.
"Hagrid!" said Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!"
It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again.
"So what on earth is Hagrid up to?" Hermione asked.
"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you," said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.
Thank you so much for your support! I love you all and your feedback is greatly appreciated!
"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
The game continued, it was difficult to see what was going on without binoculars since the teams were moving so quickly- the commentary by Gryffindor Jordan was enough though.
"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else- something that will bring you back to full strength and power- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?"
How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier.
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups- Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry," Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, "but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done."
Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
"I don't need a cloak to become invisible," said Dumbledore gently. "Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?"
Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broom shed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something to be proud of now- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.
Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle were now talking amongst themselves about the Potter rumour- still.
"It's an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. "I'm sure it is- try it on."
"Why not?"
"I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape!... look!"
"And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve... back to Johnson and-- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes... Flint flying like an eagle up there- he's going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle! That's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and-- OUCH-- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins- that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goalposts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which-- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes- she's really flying- dodges a speeding Bludger... the goalposts are ahead- come on, now, Angelina! Keeper Bletchley dives- misses- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!"
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep… Harry.” Draco’s voice was gradually getting softer, with longer gaps between each word, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat at his next words. “I’m sorry, for everything… You never deserved any of it… Maybe you can forgive me, one day… I love you, Harry.” Draco slowly moved so that his arms were around Harry, reaching up to kiss his jaw before collapsing against his chest. “Draco… Draco please, no.” Harry couldn’t stop his tears even if he wanted to, holding Draco’s head again, trying to check the pulse point at his neck, but he knew. He knew it wouldn’t change anything. The boy pressed his lips to Draco’s forehead repeatedly, holding him close as sobs wracked his body. “I love you too Draco, darling, you’ll be okay now. Just rest. I- I’ve got you.” Harry spoke softly into Draco’s hair, laying on the ground with the sun setting around them, dreading the moment he would have to let go of the boy in his arms who had deserved so much more.
But as far as Harry was concerned, the damage couldn’t be undone.
Potter shot up and tossed a strange look over his shoulder. “Malfoy. Where the hell have you been? Your bloody cupboard’s a mess. I can’t find the Calming Draught.”
A few moments later, at the blond’s demand, Harry had tossed his shirt to join his growing pile of removed clothing.
“Harry, what have I told you about drinking with Seamus?” Hermione added in, furrowing her brow worriedly.
"Not going to happen." Harry stuffed the paper into his pocket and downed the rest of his drink, ignoring Seamus' mock pout.
Malfoy’s jaw clenched visibly. “How did you find me? My studio is not listed publicly and you’re not a local.”
"I suppose I could use another holiday," Harry said thoughtfully.
"Just a bet," Harry said, picking up the piece of paper and laughing when he realized it was her name, followed by a telephone number. "Too bad I haven't got a phone."
Green eyes met stormy gray, and Harry instinctively stepped back to allow the blond ample room to swagger in. He noticed, not for the first time, the way the black Unspeakable uniform hugged his body like a glove from the high collar to the cinched waist. The bottom half of the uniform swirled around his ankles, and was just high enough to reveal impeccably shiny black shoes. “What level?” Harry asked, deciding on the polite and neutral route.
“Shacklebolt wants to see me in his office.”
Harry’s eyes seemed glued to Malfoy’s approaching form – lean and almost predatory – and didn’t look up to meet his gaze until he’d realized they were just a little too close. It felt like a power play, and Harry was almost grateful for the magic that did not allow him to take a step back. Stormy grey eyes bored into his, and he struggled with a sudden and surprising bout of amnesia. What had he meant to say? It certainly wasn’t, “You can do wandless magic?” but the question escaped his lips in a rush anyway.
The blond reached out to grab the teacup, his fingers brushing against Harry’s in a way that he would have thought was deliberate if it had been anyone else. In the next moment, Malfoy was brushing particles of black fabric from Harry’s robe from the white shirt he’d worn underneath. He was all-business, circling around him and adjusting what he found fault with as though Harry were a doll. The material of Harry's shirt was thin, and every brush of Malfoy's hands was warm and sent an oddly pleasant jolt through him that he was studiously ignoring.
"Merde!" Malfoy exclaimed, scrambling to his feet and fishing what looked like a Muggle pager out of his shirt pocket from the floor. "I'm late for my meeting." He ran a hand through his hair, which was already hopelessly disheveled from Harry’s fingers.
“It’s not going to hold.
"Nah – too simple. How often are we in France? Let's make it interesting.”
With a start, Harry belated remembered the Dark Mark. He hadn’t noticed if it was there - hadn’t even been looking for it, but he wasn’t about to correct his assumption. The truth was a little more unsettling, so he stayed silent.
"Tch, you're no fun," he groused.
Almost.
"Had to make sure there would be no competition."
Once the knot was undone, Malfoy dropped his hands to grasp Harry’s arms and pull them down. “Don’t cross your arms like that,” he said. “Hook your thumbs in your pocket like this. It looks more natural and inviting.” He took a step back to examine the new pose. Apparently not satisfied, Malfoy stepped closer again and Harry’s heart leapt when he reached forward and placed both hands on his waist.
“Lean against that wall there,” Malfoy pointed to an area in the corner with a tall brick wall that didn’t quite reach the ceiling. “I’ll start you off with something simple.”
Harry felt very strange. This was, possibly, what those annoyingly chatty receptionist witches had been gossiping about as he tried to enjoy his mid-morning coffee and Daily Prophet in the lounge. Well, they were
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Never.”
“Yes,” Harry moaned, thrusting his hips to prompt Draco’s hand to move. “Metlin, I've wanted this. Thought about it," Harry found himself admitting uncontrollably. "Thought about
He leaned in close to the woman's ear and said, "I think you've won the bet."
Harry rolled his eyes and clunked his goblet against Seamus', causing liquid to spill out onto the table. "Yeah, fine."
over the initial panic that had set in when the potions wore off.
After a moment of silence, Harry cleared his throat. “What do you mean?” he asked, glancing at Malfoy and then back to Kingsley. “Where am I going?”
He suddenly remembered the time he had happened upon some photos when he'd dropped by uninvited at the Weasleys' flat one evening. Hermione, her face beet red, had had to explain that she'd taken "boudoir" photos as a Christmas gift for Ron. He felt sick as the image of Hermione he thought he’d repressed came floating into his mind; and his imagination helpfully inserted himself in her place, wearing lacy lingerie and posing cat-like on a velvet chaise.
He could have been reciting one of Kingsley’s mind-numbingly boring reports and Harry would still feel the same thrill racing through his body at the sound of it flowing from Malfoy’s lips like a sonnet. However, curiosity got the better of him. “As nice as that sounds, can you speak in English? I have no idea what you’re saying.” He found his voice coming out low and raspy.
“Draco,” Harry whispered back between kisses, grinning against his lips when he felt Draco shudder.
“Eager, are we?” Harry rose his eyebrows suggestively, letting a playful grin steal over his face at Malfoy’s absolute silence and the way his eyes followed Harry’s hands when they dropped to his belt. He fumbled and pushed at the material until it, too, lay in a heap next to the rest of his clothes. The boxer-briefs he wore underneath the trousers were his own – grey with red and gold stripes around the waist.
The corridors were filled with noise and activity as the afternoon mail haul whizzed through the air above his head and the summer season’s interns jockeyed for the attention of the regular employees, sometimes to the point of obnoxious doting. Harry tentatively returned the wave of a young girl with deep brown eyes and yellow braids, but ducked into the nearest lift to avoid giving her an opening.
It took everything he had to keep himself from bolting. The words brought to mind all the unintentionally suggestive comments and accidental touches whenever they were alone together. Had Potter really been-?
he told himself. “You’re not in your right mind. We need to get you to the lab,” he said. “There might be residue on your robes that we can analyze....” He eyed the robe with concern. “In fact, you should remove it now to be safe.” When Potter didn’t budge, Draco leaned over him. “Are you alright?”
Harry, he noticed with a twinge of annoyance - was subjected to an array of invasive searching charms. He sent a questioning look to the Minister, who was sat calmly behind his large desk.
and nodded her head to Harry’s right.
“Nothing personal, Harry,” Kingsley said placatingly. “I’ve asked you here - both of you-” he glanced at Malfoy. “For a Class Violet case. I need the utmost level of security I can muster.”
"Seamus," Harry said with a nauseated groan at the other man's obscene hand gestures. "I don't--"
Harry threw the other man a deadpan expression.
For the first time in a handful of years, Malfoy treated him to that oh-so-familiar smirk, and Harry found he had not grown immune to it in the least. The breath caught in his throat, and there was a swooping sensation in his stomach as the blond draped his robes carefully across the back of a chair and stepped out from behind the large desk.
"Get the towel, you git," Malfoy snapped, pointing to it emphatically, but his smile belied his tone.
." Malfoy repeated with venom. "So tell me, am I really expected to believe that Saint Harry Potter needs some saucy shag-me photos for a lover back home?" His tone was dripping with sarcasm.
"Me neither."
Harry lifted the pillow so he could deliver his best glare. "Why are you twittering? Fuck off. Let me sleep."
“What? Scared, Potter?”
Harry sighed dramatically, grabbing a fluffy towel and wrapping it around his hips before shimmying out of the pants. The towels must have been treated to the same concealment charm as his trousers, he noticed. He held the red and gold cloth with one hand, pulled the waistband with his other, and flung it at Malfoy's head.
Draco pulled him into a long, bruising kiss.
"You will?" Seamus brightened up, raising his mug. "Cheers locks in it."
"Too bad, that," Seamus agreed, eyeing the piece of paper. "Oh, but now I
Leave it to his useless,
Draco gasped at the sudden sensation of being
A curious flash of guilt passed across Malfoy’s features before it was gone, replaced with indifference. His nose wrinkled suddenly. “It’s not Granger, is it?”
to it was because it was such a surprise. He didn’t even know Malfoy had known any other languages at all, let alone the one that was his favourite. In fact, he should be rather annoyed. He
The Irishman furrowed his brow in tipsy confusion. “Don’t you keep in touch wit’ her?”
Harry was quiet for a few moments. "If you shut up about it, I'll call her and tell her you're interested. Put in a good word, and all that."
and now he was watching for the blond’s reaction, eyes wide.
“Him?” The blonde’s eyebrows shot up.
A few people whistled. They could barely hear the music over the sounds of people shouting at each other and singing badly out of tune, but it was thankfully a slow song. Harry assumed the pose he still remembered from the Yule Ball dancing lessons. Hand in hand, they twirled awkwardly in almost-complete-circles in the small space the crowd afforded them. They struggled to keep up a decent rhythm, but gave up very quickly after she stood on his foot for the third time and promptly erupted into a fit of giggles. Harry didn't suppose they made a very graceful pair to onlookers, but the fact that few people were sober enough to pay attention was at least a little comforting.
“You wish,” Harry found himself saying, ignoring both of his urges to laugh and cringe.
They were nearly the same height, Harry realized, as he watched the nearly golden eyelashes lower over his downcast eyes, nearly touching his cheeks. Malfoy has really nice skin. He frowned at the unbidden thought.
“Oh.” The git stared stupidly at the shelves. “Ah! There!”
"Say, how about a bet, Harry?" Seamus sat down with tray of shot glasses – each one filled with something of a different color and consistency. He was practically buzzing, grinning from ear to ear.
" Harry smashed his pillow over his face roughly.
It had been almost a year now since Harry had come out to his most trusted friends. They'd all been very understanding and supportive. However, Seamus had been a little
,” Harry tried, feeling more than a little awkward. He’d memorized the phrase from a small book Hermione had lent him, but he wasn’t sure how to go about something as random as asking for a boudoir studio.
“So are you,” Draco whispered back, lowering himself down for another kiss.
Malfoy simply blinked at him in the most sardonic way he could manage.
“You may be surprised to find that I do have a life and a career now that does not revolve around you.”
Poor Luna, Harry thought to himself. Both times he had taken her to a yule celebration he had left her to fend for herself, distracted as he was by a rather different blond. Harry shook his head, forcing the memories away. He did not need the reminder of his past mistakes thank you very much. No, this year he was going with someone that he liked, and he would spend the whole evening with them and his friends.
Harry knew, now that he had had enough time running for his life with his best friend, that he was grateful in a way, that Cedric didn’t have to fight for him. All the people Harry and Hermione listen out for on Potterwatch, the familiar voices crackling through radio waves, listing families and individuals that were missing, or confirmed dead, made him think back to those that he had
“Potter.” The blond turned to him, rolling his eyes as Harry blinked. “You’re not as subtle as you think you are, blundering your way through to me.” Harry floundered for words, relaxing when Draco gave him a small smile. “What can I do for you?” “Just wondered how you’re doing. Your parole ended in summer, didn’t it?” Harry ran a hand through his hair, looking away from Draco and wondering why he always said the wrong things, but Draco just nodded. “Yes. Two years of parole over, one of them spent here, as you know.” Harry did know, he had done his best to avoid Draco during their final year at Hogwarts, up until Draco had cornered him to apologise for everything he had done, and Harry in turn apologised for the curse he had inflicted on the blond. After that, there had been a hesitant friendship between the two. Neither actively sought out the other but if their paths crossed they would stop and talk, and Harry's friends had gradually done the same.
“Oh Harry, you look so handsome!” Daphne grinned at him, and he smiled. “All thanks to your advice. You look beautiful.” It wasn’t a lie. The brunette giggled and gave a small twirl, her dark blue gown floating around her, the lights from the house glistening off the crystals and sapphires that were embroidered onto the bodice. A polite cough from next to her had Daphne grabbing the blonde she was stood with. “Oh, please forgive me! This is my sister Astoria, I told you all about her-“ Harry nodded and cut in, sure that Daphne was about to say more than her sister wanted her to. “Of course, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Will you be joining us? I’m sure the Minister won’t mind if I bring two plus ones.” Harry asked, as he noticed Astoria was also dressed for the gala, wearing a light blue gown that wasn’t as long as Daphne’s and not as sparkly either, but still with enough elegance for a Slytherin princess. “Oh, Harry do you think she could?” Daphne spoke before Astoria had a chance to. “I lent her one of my old dresses, just in case, you see. I told her that I was sure you wouldn’t mind her tagging along, and then when we get there she can find our friends.” The blonde girl smiled tightly at Harry, and he noticed that she looked almost like she would rather not be joining them, but Harry had promised Hermione that he would try with Daphne. Telling her sister to stay at home would not put him in anyone’s good books. “Of course. Why don’t you both get in the carriage and I’ll send a quick message so that they know to expect you.” Harry gestured behind him and Daphne flung herself on Harry, hugging him before grabbing her sister’s hand and pulling her into the carriage.
After a while, Harry met Draco's gaze reluctantly, a shy smile on his lips as the courtyard grew quiet. "Well?" He asked, pulling his eyebrows together to try and force away the blush that was growing rapidly. "Oh," Draco muttered out, almost crashing back into their conversation once more. Why was his mind wandering so much today? He could usually control his thoughts anytime he saw Potter, but today or better yet right now, he was thinking about everything he wanted to do with Harry. "Uhm... I don't think sleepovers are my thing." He answered and rubbed his neck, not looking away from the glistening eyes right in front of him. Harry nodded and then shrugged quickly. "Yeah! Yeah, I figured. It was stupid of me to ask anyway, I'm sorry." Harry said quickly and jumped up into a stand position, his feet getting mixed up as he tripped over himself. Draco quickly jumped forwards and grabbed Harry's elbow, pulling him into his chest which made him lose balance and fall back into the fountain. The water felt like sharp, cold needles piercing his skin which made him tense up quite a bit. He slowly opened his eyes, having closed them when he hit the water, and looked at the horror on Harry's face. "Oh... Oh my god. Draco I am so sorry! Merlin, you're drenched!" He said, clearly not being as soaked as Draco was from the way he landed on top of him. He sat back on the edge of the fountain and grabbed Draco's forearm to pull him out of the water. He sat there quietly as frigid water fell from his body, "Damn it..." He sighed as his teeth clattered against each other.
Hermione smiled at her boyfriend's behavior and looked around the table to pick someone if no one wanted to go first. "Luna! You ask a question first." She hummed and leaned on the table to hear what her friend would ask and who she would ask it to. Luna nodded and looked around the table to pick someone to ask her question. "Ron. Did you and Hermione really sneak out of Herbology yesterday to get ingredients?" She asked with a small innocent smile on her lips. Hermione's cheeks went red as she whipped her head over to look at Ron, shooting him a cold glare. Ron cleared his throat, his cheeks also heating up at the thought of what they did yesterday. "No." He stuttered out and rubbed the back of his red neck, looking down at the cracks in the table. Everyone around the giggled and soon started chatting about what they actually did. Ron looked around the table to pick someone and his eyes landed on Harry, who was leaning into the table with a smile on his lips. "Harry. Out of everyone around this table, who would you most like to shag?" He asked with a wild smirk on his lips. Harry's eyes went wide and his cheeks grew pink as he looked around the table. His eyes soon fell on Draco, who had a small smile on his lips before it fell as their eyes locked. Harry cleared his throat and parted his lips to answer but nothing came out. He picked up the small glass and looked away from Draco to down the liquid, the burning sensation running all the way down to his stomach. Everyone let out a loud and drawn out 'awh' when they watched Harry drink. "Damn, I really wanted to know," Ron whined and crossed his arms to pout like a little child. Draco had a growing suspicion he knew who he was going to pick, which made his cheeks and ears heat up slightly with a blush.
Pansy gripped Draco's wrist and tugged him along, his feet tumbling slightly on each other before he steadied himself to match her pace. She opened the door, the warmth of the pub flushing over both Draco and Pansy quickly, making him want to take off his coat immediately. Pansy glanced around before spotting the very full round table in the corner. She started a steady pace towards the table before she felt Draco tug out of her small grip. She twisted around to give Draco a confused look before she looked down at the two-person table to their right. "This is fine." He muttered and sat down, crossing his elbows on the table. She scoffed and plopped down in the wooden chair, her arms crossing tight on her chest. "We came here because you finally grew some balls." She groaned, placing her crossed forearms on the table to lean in and look at Draco. He snorted and shook his head quickly, "No we came here so we could drink and I could look, that's all. I doubt he even knows I'm here; he hasn't even looked." He huffed, his elbows pushing hard into the wood.
He chewed on the skin on his lip for a short amount of time before looking straight at Harry, he mustered up the courage to give him a small smile. "Thanks" He uttered out, his voice low and just above a whisper so no one else could hear him. Harry, a little shocked that Draco had actually thanked him, nodded and patted Draco's shoulder lightly. "Of course!" He hummed and slid past Draco, walking down the corridor and running to catch up with Ron and Hermione who were locking arms. Draco looked behind him for a short second before he made his way to his next class; History of Magic.
Draco didn't know if he was in heaven or purgatory, he was so close to Harry he could feel his hot breath on his neck if he turned to face him. Draco would always tense anytime Harry pushed into his side, on purpose or not. Draco couldn't really decipher the difference between the two, was it on purpose, or was he always pushing further into his friend's side? Draco didn't bloody care too much, all he knew was Harry was pressed into his side, their thighs squished together and elbows bumping anytime Harry leaned into the table which he would utter a small 'sorry' anytime he felt the tense elbow of Draco. After having too much of the interaction, Draco decided to mutter the word 'bathroom' and squeeze out of the table. He walked up the stairs and stuffed himself in the bathroom, leaning on the creaky wooden door. His breathing was rapid and heavy as he looked down at his shoes. He pushed his hands through his gelled back hair and let out a sigh, his eyes closing and face resting in his hands.
After taking a small amount of time to fix his already nicely tamed hair, he stared at himself in the body mirror that stood just before the exit of the room. He instinctively flatted down invisible creases in his shirt as he made his exit, grabbing a coat quickly before he closed the door to his dorm room. Pansy smiled wickedly at her work of the outfit and linked her arm with Dracos, dragging him down the spiral staircase and out of the common room. As they made their way to the train that would take them to Hogsmeade, Draco gulped at how uncomfortable the tightness of the shirt around his neck felt. He inched his hand up to unbutton the first two buttons of the shirt, but Pansy whacked his hand away quickly, making the blond hiss and withdraw his hand back to his pant pocket. "Don't touch, you can unbutton when you start drinking." She ordered, boarding the train in one swift step, clearly not needing Draco's help to step up the two steps. He followed her closely, glancing in closed-off cabins before they took their seats in an empty one.
Harry, now slightly more interested in Draco, is trying his best to get the bloke alone so they could talk. Of course, Draco would try his best to avoid that situation.
"Sure, Why not?"
Why was he in this situation again? Right, Pansy got invited to go out with them for some reason and she pulled Draco along against his own will. He would've much rather been asleep in his dorm room dreaming about Harry, now he actually had to answer his question, try and remain civil when he for some reason was so on edge. He didn't know if he wanted to make up some excuse to leave and go back to the comfort of his bed, expecting a massive hangover in the morning, or stay here and remain pressed so close to Harry. A knock on the door made Draco jump in surprise, he didn't realize how much time had passed with him just standing there in the same position. He opened the door to be greeted by green eyes, making his lips curve in an instinctive frown, hiding the small smile he wanted to show off. "Draco, I got worried you may have slipped and hit your head, you've been up here for a good while now." Harry joked, letting a small snicker leave his lips. When Draco didn't respond, he tilted his head to show concern. Harry had just said he was worried about him, he was worried about Draco so he came up here to search for him, that word alone made butterflies fly up to his throat from his stomach. He swallowed hard and pulled his eyebrows close, the frown on his lips deepening as he thought of an answer. "I don't need your worry, sod off." He grunted and shoved past Harry, what a perfect answer when there was a simple 'thank you' wanting to jump from the tip of his tongue.
Draco watched Blaise walk around the table and over to the ingredients, picking up Ashwinder egg, Squill bulb, Murtlap tentacle, Tincture of thyme, Occamy eggshell, and Powdered common rue. Draco read over the instructions and Blaise walked back, putting all the ingredients on their table. "You're lying, or the person who told you is lying," Draco said quietly, going over to grab the squill bulb to cut it up into the correct measurements. Blaise scoffed and let out a snort of a laugh and shook his head. "I'm only telling you what I heard, Draco. It could be real news or fake, who knows?" He responded in just the same hushed tone as Draco, making sure no one would hear what they were talking about. Draco whacked Blaise's shoulder and pointed to the other ingredients, "Do your part of measurements you prat." He ordered and cut the squill bulb into tiny little chunks so they were able to dissolve into the potion. He flattened the knife and squeezed them a bit to make it into a paste just like the instructions said. Draco slid the now paste squill bulb into the water base of the potion. He picked up the glass stick they were meant to use for stirring and stirred the liquid counterclockwise. He looked up from the mixture, his eyes landing on Harry as he worked. Harry was giggling and shoving Ron with his elbow as he stirred his mixture. Draco looked down at his outfit again, this time his robe was straightened out and not so crumpled on his shoulders; he must've fixed it in the bathroom at some point.
It was a Thursday, which meant tomorrow was Friday (obviously) and that in turn meant that Draco wouldn't be able to sleep in the hangover he would most definitely get. He ran a calloused hand down his face, dragging the bottom of his eyelids down slightly as he pulled at his rosy cheeks. "We're sitting at a different table entirely, act like you weren't invited and you just decided a fun night out with me on a Thursday evening would be good." He practically ordered, looking over to Pansy with a clearly forced nonchalant expression. She smiled wide, the snake-like grin making her cheeks puff up slightly. Her eyes opened and she stood abruptly, looking down at Draco, "Of course, dear. Wouldn't want to ruin your chance to
Harry huffed after completely swallowing the liquor and looked around the table for his own victim. He smiled at Neville and tapped his chin to think of a question for him. "Neville, Who do you find the hottest around this table?" He asked, tilting his head to look at Neville who looked completely shocked at the question. He looked at the liquor, then looked around the table to look at everyone's faces. "Seamus." He finally answered and rubbed his hands together due to his anxiety as everyone burst out into laughter. Draco looked over to Seamus who was shaking his head and letting out a few giggles and slapped Neville's hand which made him retreat it to his stomach. After the group settled down, Neville looked directly at Draco, hesitation in his eye. Draco remained calm, having no idea what he was going to ask but he was confident he would answer and not drink. "Malfoy, I'm curious, who would you most likely shag in this friend group?" He asked with a small snicker and every eye was on Draco. He thinned his lips and shrugged, glancing over at Harry for a split second. "Potter. He's the most appealing." He said, feeling like the group would take it as a joke seeing as they were 'enemies', but Draco couldn't help his heart roaring in his chest from his confession. Harry looked at him with wide eyes, along with everyone else, and the group grew awkwardly quiet. Harry's cheeks were flush again, the pink hue burning bright on his skin as he looked down at his empty glass in front of him. He soon huffed out some air and looked at Hermione, a smirk on his lips. "Granger, how about when you walked out of Defense Against The Dark Arts for a bathroom break and came back twenty minutes later looking disheveled? Was that really a bathroom break?" he asked and leaned into the table, his chin resting on his knuckles after he brought his hands up.
"Good afternoon, class. As you are all hopefully aware, you have a potions test today over making liquid luck. You are only allowed your book for ten minutes of the test, after that, you must put it under your table and go on simple memory." He informed, looking around to each table to make sure everyone had a partner and a cauldron in front of them. "You will have your partner for help. Your test starts now, no talking unless it's to your partner." Slughorn said and walked around the class, watching each student carefully to make sure there was no cheating.
Harry grinned and watched Draco's actions, tilting his head to look at Draco's face. Draco dropped his head to look at the book so he could distract himself from Harry. Harry let out a hum and tapped his foot on the hardwood floor beneath their feet, watching Draco read was actually quite entertaining in an odd way. "So, how's your head? You left early and I can only assume because you were starting to get too drunk so you went back to sleep?" He asked, trying to fill the awkward silence that surrounded them. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, not looking away from his book as he cleared his throat, "I was just tired, I'm not used to staying up that late into the night. I was not drunk so don't you go spreading that around." He snapped back, grabbing the book to bring it closer to his face. Harry simply hummed and shook his head, he shrugged his shoulder and leaned his forearms into the table, "Why would I spread it around? I'm done fighting with you Draco, I was thinking we could start fresh?" Harry asked, rubbing his hands together in anticipation of Draco's response. Draco looked up with a frown and scoffed, glancing out the window to their left. "Have you gone bloody mad? You rejected my friendship when you smacked my hand away in the first year, what makes you think I want to be your best mate now?" Draco snorted, clearly finding it funny Harry wanted to 'start fresh'.
When they got back to the castle and to the Slytherin common room, Pansy turned to Draco before he could push past her. "Why did you want to leave so suddenly? I was having a bloody good time!" She yelled but kept her voice slightly hushed so the other students couldn't hear. "I- Pansy, I don't want to talk about it right now. I'm drunk and damn knackered." He sighed and dragged his hand down his face. She shot his a few more glares before she huffed and turned to walk up the stairs to the 8th year dorm rooms. He stood there silently for a bit before he too walked up the stairs to go to his room. He shrugged off his snow ridden coat and pulled the belt from the loops and placed it on a chair beside his bed, making sure to be quiet so he didn't wake up three other students who shared his room. He unbuttoned the shirt, plucking each button slowly before he shrugged it off and tossed it in a hamper for his dirty clothes. He pulled at the button on the dress pants and unzipped them, pushing them off his hips to step out of them when they folded around his ankles. He tossed them into the hamper and tossed the dark green covers to his bed aside so he could slither into bed. He folded the blanket over himself and shimmied his shoulders down. Draco looked absentmindedly towards to ceiling, thinking back to everything he did tonight. He was a complete idiot, and he would admit it aloud if the others weren't sleeping. After stirring in bed for about an hour, the beginning of a headache washed over him which made him close his eyes and drift into a dreamless sleep.
Pansy bit off a rather rude remark she wanted to say just before a waitress came over to the table to take their drink orders. They both decided a nice Fire Whiskey would do them wonders, Draco more thought it would help him calm his rising nerves. He snuck quick glances over to the table that had way too many people snuggled in around it. Draco grimaced at the closeness of Neville Longbottom and Harry, they were practically snogging with how close their lips came when they turned towards one another. When the glasses of Fire Whiskey was placed in front of both of them, Draco gripped the cold glass firmly and drew the rim to his lips, closing his eyes to take down the burning liquid. He gave a soft hum at the fond taste before his eyes slid open and the cup was being placed back down on the table. He hadn't had a nice drink in quite a while since he mostly stayed out of public places. After the war, people mostly forgave one another for anything that happened, of course, the exceptions being most of the Slytherins, Draco included.
Draco wanted to reach other his hand and straighten his tie, he wanted to smooth down his robe on his shoulders, he wanted to cup Harry's cheeks just to feel the warmth radiating off them. Draco cleared his throat, forcing himself out of his wandering thoughts as frowned at Harry. "You haven't asked a single question, and you're not even reading anymore, you're just staring at the page." Draco pointed out, noticing that Harry had stopped mouthing the word and was just staring at the page. Harry looked up as Draco spoke, his lips curving up a little as he tapped his finger on the table. "You need help at all so sod off. I don't want you here with your annoying way of reading." Draco scoffed and flicked his hand, watching Harry's smile fall. "Okay, I'll admit that I don't need help, I've actually already studied this section already." He answered, closing the book so he could lean on his elbows to get closer to Draco. "I was wondering if you needed help, so I waited to see if you would ask. But of course, you wouldn't ask me,  you never need help, especially if it's from me." Harry scoffed and slouched back into the chair, his arms crossing over his chest. Draco swallowed hard, realizing Harry came him to help him or make small talk with him. Draco looked down as he felt his cheeks heat up slightly in embarrassment. "If you sit there and be quiet you can stay..." He mumbled and pulled the book closer to the edge of the table.
had worn at the yule ball, let alone what someone he never spoke to wore. Perhaps it was a girl thing. “I told her so when I saw her earlier.” Or not then. Ron grinned and gave Hermione a smacking kiss on the cheek, his ears turning red as Daphne giggled again. Harry looked on as his best friends had a silent conversation just looking at each other, and Harry wracked his brain before remembering that Hermione had used some sort of hair potion to make her hair sleek and straight, and then curled it elegantly into an updo of some sort. Her hair tonight was left in its natural style, just tamed slightly into smoother ringlets and with small stars scattered throughout the curls. She wore a Gryffindor red dress, with a gold shawl, and Ron had donned a more subtle suit and robe than Harry’s. Harry had a feeling after the nightmarish frilly dress robes of the yule ball Ron would rather blend into the crowd.
.” Harry stared at Draco, the other boy shaking, whether out of fear or shock from what had just happened, Harry couldn’t tell. “Malfoy… what?” “You have to win this thing Potter, please, don’t go to him. He’ll do anything to get you alone.” Draco broke off, looking up into Harry’s eyes in despair. Harry couldn’t help himself and nodded, just wanting to get that look off Draco’s face. The last time he had seen him look so defeated had been in Myrtle’s bathroom. “Okay. I- I won’t.” Draco visibly relaxed, going limp, his hand falling to Harry’s wrist. Harry moved to hold Draco’s hand loosely. “Mal- Draco, I’m sorry. About Crabbe and, and for last year. I didn’t know what it would do to you, that it would… that you could have…” Draco watched him with wide eyes, shaking his head slightly. “Potter you idiot, why are you apologising? I was going to crucio you and you know it. So what if I could have died? I should have, at least then Dumbledore would still be here.” “Don’t say that! It matters to me Draco, please don’t” “Harry! As touching as this is, we
“Hermione, she seems lovely, really, but you know that this isn’t going to work.” Harry shook his head as Hermione sighed at him from across the table. “You will give her a chance! At least spend the evening with her, get to know her, introduce her to your friends and meet hers.” The dark-skinned girl took a rather large sip of her wine and pinned Harry with a stern look until he caved. “Alright, fine, just for tomorrow. I make no promises about how well the evening will go, but I
Harry suddenly jerked forwards as Draco started walking through the hall, and Harry blinked in surprise. Was Draco not going to dance with him after all? Was he being a total idiot? Harry hurried to keep up, cursing Draco’s long legs, and crashed into him when the blond stopped abruptly. “Draco?” Harry whispered, tugging at his hand. He’d been led out of the hall and they were now stood in the courtyard, the ground was covered in a soft blanket of snow. The blond let go of him and turned to smile, giving him a bow. Harry just blinked. “Honestly Potter, you’re meant to bow when you invite someone to dance.” Draco gave him a smile that grew into a shrewd smirk, holding both his hands out towards him. “Or have you changed your mind?” No way was Harry backing out now. He shook his head and took a step forward, cursing his hands for shaking as he let Draco put his arms into position. “Scared, Potter?” Harry inhaled sharply at the whisper in his ear, Draco’s warm breath tingling his neck. “You wish.” He managed to mutter, and before he lost all of his courage he turned his head to look up at Draco.
Harry frowned at his reflection, adjusting his dark blue tie and pocket square again. He was dressed in a simple light grey suit, a white shirt, and a darker grey robe with a blue satin lining. His hair was a lost cause and always would be, but a small amount of Sleekeazy’s did at least get his fringe under some control, just enough that it stayed mostly over the scar that spread across his face. The scar had faded a lot since the war ended, and Voldemort was finally gone, but people still stared at it whenever they got the chance. The clock in the hallway chimed five thirty, and Harry took one last look in the mirror before grabbing his wand and apparating near to the carriage company that he was using for the night.
. No, she wants Tori to see that she doesn’t need Draco to be happy.”
“Look Potter, I know what I did was stupid, and cowardly, but what did you expect me to do?” Pansy sighed and looked over Harry’s shoulder, shaking her head slightly. Harry knew better than to look around. “Parkinson, uh, Pansy? It’s fine, I’m not here about that. Nobody knew what to do, and I don’t blame you for it. I actually wanted to talk to you because I came with Daphne, and Astoria but that was a bit last minute.” “
After mingling with Ministry officials, friends from school and some of the Junior Aurors he knew from training, Harry was dead on his feet and they hadn’t even had the ball section of the gala yet. Harry was currently making his way to the table designated for the golden trio and guests. Harry hated the title given to him and his best friends, but it didn’t hurt to know that he would always be near them at any big events like this one. He approached the table with Daphne and pulled out a chair for her, nodding at Astoria already sat next to Hermione. Ron was stood at the next table over, talking animatedly with Neville, Ginny and Luna. Harry smiled as the blonde girl gave him a small wave, and he looked around as the girls talked amongst themselves.
, Draco hadn’t been engaged. Only two short months after they parted, they could have been together again, if only Harry hadn’t been so stubborn to forget about the blond. As if that could ever happen. Harry rubbed his hands over his face in despair, begging himself to not cry, not right now. He could do that later, once he had spoken to Draco properly.
Harry spent the rest of the evening at Draco’s side, and as they left their old school in the early hours of the morning, he decided that he loved these Ministry events. They were the
Harry was mostly relieved that his friends didn’t go out of their way to see him as the saviour of the wizarding world, they all knew how much he hated that crap. It just would have been nice to grab a few people and go the gala with friends. Last year, Harry had invited Luna to go with him, platonically of course, and with Ginny out of the country to visit Charlie with George, the blonde had happily accepted. Harry tried not to think about last year though, and knew he had to keep a hold of himself this time.
make an effort.” Hermione raised her eyebrows at him sceptically. “What? I met her today didn’t I? Endured her choosing what colour tie would work best, and paid for her outfit seeing as it was so last minute.” Harry gave Hermione a small smile. “I can be a nice person you know, even if I’m not interested in someone romantically.” His best friend nodded and gave him a smile in return. “I know, and I would apologise for badgering you but really, you told me you would find someone.” Harry was saved from having to come up with a response to that by Ron returning with takeaway for them. “I hope you’re hungry! Mrs Li gave us extra spring rolls again, I think she has a soft spot for you mate.” Ron grinned as he joined the two in the kitchen, playfully nudging Harry’s shoulder and leaning down to give Hermione a quick kiss before unloading their dinner onto the table.
The meal passed quickly, and Harry watched as Malfoy and his mother expertly waved their wands in sync, and the tables transfigured into side tables, elegant chairs and chaise lounges, making a large space in the centre of the hall for a ball. The lights all turned out, and then the ceiling filled with gold and silver stars, each one emitting their own light. A silver glowing crescent moon was in the middle of them all, casting a crescent shaped light on the dance floor. The walls lit up in different shades of blue, and Harry realised they were fairies, flittering about the walls. A round of applause came and then music started, Harry turning to Daphne and offering his hand. “I must warn you Daphne, I’m not the best dancer, but would you care to join me?” The brunette grinned at him, and happily led him onto the dance floor. Harry smiled as he saw Ron extravagantly bowing to Hermione, the girl shoving at him playfully before they joined them. Daphne helped guide Harry round in a simple waltz, and he did a double take at seeing Neville leading Astoria round opposite them. Perhaps Daphne did only want to bring Astoria so she could meet some new people.
. The words from Draco’s letter appeared in his mind and he walked over to the side of the hall where they were stood talking quietly.
It wasn’t difficult to find Draco, he’d had many times practice of searching for the boy’s name, and considering almost all other names were in one place, it took only a few seconds to spot the little banner floating on the grounds. Harry was instantly relieved to see that he was still at the castle, but then fear filled him. The name was by itself, and he couldn’t see Narcissa anywhere.
After Rita Skeeter had gone back to her ways of manipulation and scheming after the war, Hermione had informed the Ministry of her status as an illegal animagus. The woman faced a hefty fine and was banned from writing another piece for any U.K. publication. The story had spread, naturally, and ever since Harry was always asked before any photographs or interviews were given. He knew that there would be some reporting on the night’s events, and cut into Daphne’s rambling smoothly. “Sorry Daphne, would you mind stopping for a picture with me? And Astoria as well, of course.” He nodded towards the photographers waiting anxiously and the older girl grinned. “Oh, of course! Come Tori!” The blonde smiled and left Harry’s side to stand with her sister instead, Harry smiling for a photo before noticing a blond head out of the corner of his eye. “Excuse me Daphne, Astoria. I hate to be rude and leave you just as we arrive but there’s someone I need to talk to over-“ “Oh it’s fine Harry, we’ll mingle and catch up to you.” Daphne waved him off easily, and Harry had to stop his surprise showing on his face, simply nodding instead and walking away from the sisters still posing for pictures.
After the music flowed into a faster piece, Harry led Daphne over to one side, watching quietly as her sister stayed in Neville’s arms. “I wasn’t expecting that, I’ll be honest.” Daphne grinned up at him, and Harry hummed in agreement, his attention immediately stolen by Malfoy swanning past them with his mother. He couldn’t help himself and watched as they danced like they had been born knowing how to. Then again, Narcissa was a Black so he wouldn’t put it past them. “He looks good, doesn’t he?” “Yeah, yeah he does.” Harry replied before realising what they’d said. “Uh, I mean-“ Daphne laughed, the full laugh from when she was talking to Pansy. “Don’t worry Harry, I could tell you weren’t interested in me when we met yesterday. And you’ve been staring at him all night.” Harry felt his cheeks darkening and he fumbled over an apology. “I do like you Daphne, I was trying to make sure you had a good time tonight, I just… Well, I can’t see us having a relationship. You’re a bit too, um, forward?” Harry blinked in surprise when she just laughed again. “Oh I know, don’t worry. I was a bit much wasn’t I? Don’t worry Harry, Hermione thinks I’ve fancied you for years so she set us up, but I just wanted to make sure you’d be good for him.” “Excuse me?” Harry was really lost now, and Daphne smiled gently as she walked him over to one of the elegant chaise lounges.
Draco. I need to know you’ll be okay.” He whispered, and the blond nodded slowly before removing himself from Harry and grabbing Goyle’s arm, dragging him off through the castle. “And I thought
Before Harry could even start to think about what it meant, Dobby was dying in his arms, sobs shaking the boy as he despaired. His poor friend, so misguided when they first met, and willingly putting his life at risk, willingly dying in order to save Harry’s life. The words he had spoken at the end of his second year rang through his head as Luna helped him with his small, fragile body - “Never try to save my life again.”
- Draco had brought into the school.
“Did you kill him?” Draco whispered into Harry’s chest, and Harry let out a small sob as he nodded. “His spell backfired. He’s dead. So is Bellatrix. I’m sorry, I know she was your aunt-” “Merlin Potter, she was a bitch. You don’t need to apologise.” Harry held Draco closer to him, closing his eyes as the tears continued. “Don’t strain yourself Draco. You’ll get through this. I’ll make sure you do. I promise.”
Silently wondering if he really was doing the right thing, Harry checked the driver wasn’t watching and sent off a patronus message to Kingsley, apologising for the short notice but he would be bringing both Miss Greengrass’ to the gala, adding vehemently that he did not expect special treatment and if it was going to be a problem please tell him so. Harry received no response, and assumed that meant it was all fine, so he joined the girls in the carriage, not realising that one of them was going for the very same reason that he didn’t want to.
When Harry woke the next morning to an empty bed, he frowned in confusion. Surely he hadn’t dreamt everything that happened last night. He sat up, reaching a hand out to grab his glasses from the bedside table, and picked up a note instead. Perhaps Draco had things he needed to do today, he had taken a lot of persuading to stay the night. Harry eventually found his glasses and unfolded the piece of paper, his frown only deepening as he read. Well then, looks like the Slytherin had left for good. It was fine, Harry was fine, he
“Are you coming to see who’s visiting at this ungodly hour?” Harry asked Draco as he pulled on a shirt, and the blond smirked at him. “I can’t. I made a promise that I would stay in this bed all day.” Harry flipped Draco off as he laughed, and then Harry was lunging at him, kissing him soundly before finally going to see who was at his door.
Draco kept his promise, and the next morning Harry woke to the taller boy curled up around him, holding him tightly against his chest. Harry smiled and pulled the duvet up around them, successfully hiding them from the daylight streaming through his curtains. Draco stirred, and opened his eyes blearily to smile at Harry. “Morning.” Harry whispered, and Draco’s smile widened. “Morning love.” They moved in sync, both leaning into the other for a gentle kiss, and Harry closed his eyes, wishing that this really would be it now, that he could finally live a normal, happy life. His eyes flung open at an insistent knocking coming from the front door, and groaned as he pulled away from Draco.
“Harry, you need to find someone for the Ministry gala before I find someone for you! It’s next week for goodness’ sake. Before you suggest it, you
It wasn’t much later at all that Harry appeared at Draco’s side with two glasses of champagne. “How about those drinks then, Draco?” Harry grinned up at the taller boy, who turned away from the person he was talking to in surprise. “Potter! I mean, Harry. Yes, yes of course.” Draco took one of the glasses and then linked his arm gently through Harry’s, guiding him over to the large fireplace, blue flames dancing under the lights.
Harry took a steadying breath, leaning against one of the pillars in front of the building. After Daphne had told him everything, helping Harry to piece together the puzzle of Draco Malfoy, the picture he was left with brought him close to tears in frustration. The whole year, since

Harry paused and glanced over to Astoria and Daphne, smiling a little at them watching them. “I didn’t know the engagement ended. I didn’t even know who you were betrothed to until this evening, Draco.” He smiled as Draco’s eyes widened even further, his mouth just gaping open. “If you would still have me, Draco, I’m yours. My heart will always belong to you.” Harry turned to walk away, thinking it would be best for Draco to think through everything he had just unloaded on him, but a hand grabbed his arm firmly, spinning him back around.
The company was a muggle old-fashioned car rental, but over the holiday period they had an arrangement with a nearby farm to rent out horse-drawn carriages as well. It was one of these that Harry had miraculously been able to acquire for his guest, and after giving his name, Harry was led through to the smart black carriage with silver trim and two horses already geared up in front.
Draco’s lips were cold, but smooth. His hand tightened on Harry’s jaw, moving slowly into his hair as they pressed closer together, Harry bringing his arms up around Draco’s neck. The kiss seemed to go on forever, neither of them rushing to go further. When they finally separated, Harry let out a shaky breath and grinned. “That’s much better than dancing.” His grin widened as Draco laughed, a short bright thing into his hair as he was pulled into an embrace. “Curse you Potter. You always have to make things difficult don’t you?” Harry just grinned, leaning up to whisper to the blond that he could make things a lot easier if they went back to his. Draco gave him a look of surprise before laughing again. “You’re filthy, Potter. Let’s get back inside, stupid Gryffindor.”
It was the day before the gala, and Hermione had roped him into going with Daphne Greengrass, one of her colleagues in the Muggle Liaisons office. Harry vaguely remembered the Slytherin girl from Hogwarts, but most of them blended into the group of Malfoy and co. He
When Neville had finished, and the commotion started, Harry took the chance to roll deftly from Hagrid’s arms and running to the group of students, teachers and Order members gathered on the stone steps. He ran, without looking back to see Voldemort’s reaction, to his family, and they welcomed him with shouts of excitement and relief, with tears and confusion. Ron and Hermione were there to pull him into a tight hug, all three of them crying, and then Harry was pulled to the side by someone else. Before Harry could focus, a pair of lips were being crushed against his, and all Harry could taste was the salty tang of tears, but then the lips were gone and Harry looked down into the grey eyes of one Draco Malfoy, with tears endlessly running down his cheeks. “You stupid bastard Potter, you said you wouldn’t go!” The blond had his hands fisted in Harry’s top, pulling the taller boy in to kiss him again fiercely. The fighting had resumed again, and all around them people were running, hiding, firing hexes or sending up shields, but all Harry cared about was the small alcove Draco had pulled him into. He smiled slightly before pulling Draco in to hug him, both his arms wrapping around his waist, just as Draco had done earlier that day. “I’m glad you’re safe Draco. Get out of here if you can. Your mother, she saved me.” Draco’s breath hitched and Harry pulled back to press a firm kiss to Draco’s forehead. “I’ll find you after, okay? Just stay safe.” Before Draco could stop him, Harry stepped out of the alcove and into the fray, when the boy tugged at his arm again. “Potter you idiot, you might need something to fight with.” Harry looked down to see Draco holding out his wand to him, smiling wryly before they parted.
“So, back to your place? No rules this time, I promise.” Draco bent down to wrap his arms around Harry’s waist, and the shorter grinned at him. “On one condition.” Draco raised his eyebrows and Harry’s smile widened. “You’re spending all day tomorrow in my bed.” Draco laughed, and Harry’s heart soared as he nodded. “Deal, you filthy Gryffindor.”
Of course Harry hadn’t wanted anything to do with him to start with. He had told himself he was a fool for believing they could have been together, that he should have known it was too good to be true. Harry had seen Draco a few times at the start of the year, and each time he had turned the other way and pretended like he hadn’t seen the longing on the blond’s face. But every time Harry had seen him, he wanted to go towards him, to tell him he was forgiven. Harry knew that he shouldn’t forgive him, but he always had been too understanding. He came up with reason after reason to reach out to Draco, but talked himself out of it each time. It would do him no good to chase after him, he was with someone else. After a while, it was as though nothing had happened between them. Harry was civil to Malfoy whenever their paths crossed, and they would go their separate ways.
Harry made his way through the crowd, saying hello to people he recognised, and giving thanks to everyone wishing him a blessed yule. A little voice in the back of his head told him he was being stupid, but another voice that sounded a lot like good old felix felicis urged Harry on instead. It didn’t take long for Harry to worm his way around to where a tall man stood, his blond hair styled perfectly, dressed in a black suit and robe with shimmering gold lining, a glass of champagne in his elegant hand, in conversation with a girl in a gold dress, her short black hair framing her round face. “Malfoy.” The name was out of his mouth before he could stop himself, and Harry made sure he had a civil smile in place when the older boy turned to him. “Good evening Potter, blessed yule.” The blond merely nodded at him before resuming his conversation with the girl that Harry now realised was Pansy Parkinson. Harry thought quickly, remembering Daphne talking about the other Slytherin girl. “Excuse me, Malfoy, but I actually would like a word with Miss Parkinson.” They both turned to him then in mild surprise, and Malfoy nodded, walking away from him, which left him looking at the girl that had tried to give him up to Voldemort.
While Ron grabbed Hermione out of harm’s way, Harry rushed to Malfoy’s side, so many questions that he wanted to ask, wanted to scream at him, but he knew they didn’t have time, knew that it would just put Draco at even more risk. The blond gave him a nearly imperceptible nod and readily gave up his wand, and Harry was sure he had seen him reach towards him as Dobby disapparated with them.
want to dance with him, and if he would save Harry from making a fool of himself.
While Harry dug the grave for Dobby, he played back everything that had happened at the Manor. Draco hadn’t explicitly said that it wasn’t him, and after knowing each other since they were eleven, Harry could probably pick Draco out of a line-up blindfolded, so it was a definite choice on the blonds behalf to stay quiet. He had managed to stop Bellatrix in her torture of Hermione, Merlin knows what the witch might have done if she had continued. The word carved into his best friends arm was bad enough, but Harry knew that Bellatrix had no limits to the damage she would inflict. If they hadn’t had the opportunity they did, thanks to Draco, they probably would have been dead on the manor floor by now.
The name wasn’t moving.
“Sorry to take you away from your conversation.” Harry offered the apology, taking a sip of his drink as Draco waved him off. “Oh don’t be, I was on the verge of being bored to death. I was actually surprised that you came back.” Harry grinned. “I told you I’d find you. Did you really doubt me?” The blond shrugged and Harry’s heart dropped. “Draco,” He put a hand on the other’s arm gently. “I said I’d find you. You should know by now that I won’t say something if I don’t mean it.” Draco looked down at him and gave him a small nod, Harry knew that they were both thinking of their apologies to each other, and of Harry vouching for Draco and his mother in the Death Eater trials. “Anyway,” Harry cleared his throat, finally looking away from Draco. “How about we finish these drinks and then you can have you fill of embarrassing me on the dance floor?” Harry smiled as Draco smirked down at him, elegantly sipping at his drink. “I would do no such thing. If you dance with me we’ll be the best ones out there.” Harry laughed and shook his head. Clearly Draco had forgotten the complete disaster Harry had been at the yule ball. Harry watched as couples moved easily around the dance floor, and he wondered if Draco really
about the whole thing, asking how she didn’t see it coming. I mean, it’s not her fault that she was blinded by the fact she’d been told ever since we were little girls that he would be her husband one day. Even everything with the war didn’t stop her from being head over heels for him –“ Harry nodded along as he guided her out of the shop, checking his watch discreetly. Daphne paused to take a breath and Harry seized the opportunity. “Daphne, I’m very sorry but I promised Hermione that I would meet her and Ron tonight to let her know how today went. She’s very keen for us to get to know each other better.” He smiled as the brunette grinned up at him. Harry wasn’t the tallest person, but even Daphne had to fully tilt her head to look at him properly. “Oh! Of course Harry, I’ll see you tomorrow, six o’clock?” Harry nodded and waved her off before apparating immediately to Grimmauld Place.
"I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.
"Don't play," said Hermione at once.
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."
Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.
"Really break your leg."
"Something not good, I'm guessing..." Harry muttered. He heard Neville whimper.
"You're losing it, too," said Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?"
Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.
"... someone must think I'm good at potions or something- I wonder who they're from."
"O' course I cant," he said. "Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts- I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy."
"I hate myself for saying this but... he's really...
"You, too," Harry replied hastily, his eyes still on the presents that were on his bed. "Will you look at this? I've got some presents!"
"Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.
"Good- well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later-"
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.
"Foul!" screamed most of the students.
"Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom... but he can't have...."
..." Pansy started. Draco groaned. "We could sneak down to the Quidditch pitch later during Gryffindors training and spy on them."
Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library.
"Tut, tut- fame clearly isn't everything."
"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so-"
"Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.
"They'll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them."
"Thanks, Harry... I think I'll go to bed... D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?"
There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armour could walk.
That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.
"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes.
"I do feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, "for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Yule because they're not wanted at home."
Hermione's eyes were wide.
"Follow me," said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. "I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh? Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me... It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep 'em well oiled in case they're ever needed... Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do."
"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference- Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut with Ron and Hermione.
"Lean any further and you'll die." Pansy spoke to him. He gave her a reproachful look that soon disappeared when she held out her own pair of binoculars.
"Hermione, the exams are ages away."
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
Cheers erupted from the stand, Draco joined in and looked at his friends gleefully- but he noticed that all three of them seemed to be focussed on something else.
"What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. "Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?"
"Sorry- thanks." He quickly said as he took them and held them up to his eyes. he was watching Potter and Higgs dive when-
They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.
"JORDAN!"
He saw Potter's broom high in the sky, he lifted his binoculars to get a better look and saw that the broom had started to roll over and over, with Potter only just managing to hold on. Then he heard the whole crowd gasp. His broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.
Harry didn’t know how long it had been since he had left Draco in the alcove, but he hoped it was long enough that him and his mother had made it to safety. Voldemort was dead, and his body had been moved to one end of the Great Hall, covered in black cloth. All Harry cared about was making sure his family and friends were okay. After quick glance at Ron and Hermione huddled together, not far from Molly and Ginny, and the rest of the Weasleys, Harry walked out of the hall. He didn’t know if Draco would still be in the castle, or the grounds, but he had told him he would find him when it was over. Harry had the sudden though of Hermione’s bag, and the Marauder’s Map that was hidden somewhere in it. He rushed back to his best friends, and after explaining to Hermione, she performed a quick accio and the map was in Harry’s hands.
Now they were in Malfoy Manor, Harry and Ron the only ones left after Dobby had whisked the other captives away to safety. Harry yet again couldn’t believe what was happening, as Pettigrew set them free, his silver hand turning on its owner to choke him for defying the monster that had given it to him. Harry was stood in shock, Ron already moving up through the manor to get back to Hermione, when something pulled him in that direction. He walked without thinking, his only purpose was to get closer to the voice that was shaking as it told Bellatrix to stop messing around, that clearly the girl wouldn’t tell them anything, to just leave her alone.
Harry was pulled up into a tight hug, Draco lifting him from the ground slightly, and Harry laughed. As he was put back on the ground, a small brunette barrelled into them both. “You absolute idiots! I’m so happy for you!” Daphne squealed, and Harry shared a wry smile with Draco. “How long exactly have you been planning this, Daph?” Draco asked, and she just laughed before walking back over to her sister, the blonde nodding serenely at the couple.
It didn’t take long for the carriage to arrive at Daphne’s parents’ home, an old but modest home in Chelsea. Harry stepped out of the carriage and politely waved off the driver, ringing the doorbell and hoping that it was only Daphne that greeted him.
The blond’s eyes widened and Harry wondered if it was really necessary for them to be pressed so close together, surely him and Parvati hadn’t been holding each other so tightly all those years ago. “Potter…” Draco started and Harry frowned slightly. “Yes?” Draco shook his head and his small smile returned. “
For what felt like the hundredth time that night, Harry ran.
So, here he was in Madam Malkin’s watching a girl he hardly knew lift up different coloured ties to his face. “I think the darker blue, don’t you?” Daphne grinned at him as he nodded, telling the woman assisting them that he would be paying for them both. “Oh I’m so happy Hermione suggested that I reach out to you. I was really struggling this year you know. My younger sister was meant to be engaged officially this year but that didn’t happen because it turns out he’s gay, so she was
So here it is, the last chapter! I wasn't sure about splitting these into two because they're a lot shorter than the first chapter, but I felt it made more sense for the time gap. I struggled with the ending for this fic, I just wanted to keep writing!
Last year, the gala at Hogwarts had been a typical winter wonderland scene, white and silvers everywhere and ice sculptures reminiscent of the yule ball from Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts. This year however, was full of gold, silver and different shades of blue. Daphne and Pansy looked like decorations come to life, and he realised that they must have known what the colour scheme would be. He tuned back into the conversation when he realised Daphne was asking him a question. “Oh, yes I actually wanted to talk to Pansy here, to let her know that you and your sister were here.” Daphne’s smile pinched at the corners suddenly, and Harry was cursing himself for being, as Pansy had put it, an idiot. “Of course, I mentioned to you how Pans and Blaise had been
fine. He didn’t need the best thing that had happened in his life since Teddy. He would be perfectly happy by himself while Draco – no, Malfoy – went off and lived his own life. He would make sure of it. Harry wiped the tears from his face before putting the note in the drawer of his bedside, not having the heart to throw it away, and got ready for the day.
. He told Draco as such as the blond helped him into his big winter jacket, rolling his eyes at the fact Harry had worn the most muggle suit ever, and telling him that next year he needed to wear robes because he was a
…” Harry looked back to Draco with wide eyes. “Yes, Draco?” The name felt foreign on his tongue, but his stomach filled with butterflies as a slight blush crept onto the blond’s cheeks. “I was wondering, I mean, would you like to join me for a dance later? Or some drinks, I know dancing isn’t your strong suit.” Draco almost looked away from Harry but he just grinned wider. “Of course Draco. I’ll find you, yeah?” The blond nodded and Harry walked away through the crowd, lifting a hand when he saw Draco still watching him.
in the middle of a battle with Voldemort.” Hermione cut Harry off, and the boys both turned to see her, Ron and Goyle watching them and looking more than a little confused. Harry nodded and pushed himself to his feet, bringing Draco with him by their linked hands.
After Ron had returned to them, everything seemed to happen so quickly. Harry couldn’t believe they had been so stupid, so careless that they were now running from snatchers. All he could do was thank Hermione’s quick thinking with the stinging hex she sent his way just before they were caught.
Before he could focus again, Harry was being pulled into a close embrace, a hand on his jaw tilting his head up and cold, smooth lips descended on his. Harry’s eyes closed as his hands grabbed onto the lapels of Draco’s suit, reaching up on his tiptoes to kiss him back fiercely. When they eventually pulled away from each other, Draco kept him close with an arm around his back. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I love you. I love you with all my heart.” Harry smiled up at Draco, lifting one of his hands to brush away a tear falling down his cheek, his dark hand contrasting with Draco’s pale skin, glowing in the fairy lights. “It’s alright now. I love you, Draco.”
“Potter?” Harry turned back to Draco with a smile. “Yes?” “You okay there? You didn’t answer me for a minute.” Harry found himself staring at Draco’s concerned frown, his grey-blue eyes glistening in the lights around them. “Uh, yeah. Yeah I’m fine. Do you wanna… Um…” Harry trailed off, and Draco smiled, putting down their almost empty glasses and holding his hand out to Harry. The smaller boy looked down at his hand, and held it gently, looking back up to see Draco smirking.
It didn’t take long for Harry to spot Malfoy again, stood at a table fairly close to the centre of the room, with Pansy and Blaise Zabini already sat down. An elegant blonde woman that Harry immediately recognised as Narcissa Malfoy was stood not far from them, talking to Kingsley. Harry realised that Malfoy was watching his mother, and Harry wondered if the Malfoys still received death threats wherever they went. It had been several years now since the war, but people held grudges for a long time. Harry was pulled from his thoughts then as Ron sat down between him and Hermione, and the five of them talked aimlessly before their food appeared, and Kingsley stood up for a toast.
been the right thing when Pansy sighed and shook her head. “Just like Daph, she was always planning out things behind people’s backs. Oh don’t worry,” she waved a hand easily at Harry’s concerned look, “she wouldn’t do anything to you, you’re the
lost to the war. Cedric wasn’t the first one, his parents had that sombre achievement, but he was the first that really cemented the idea in Harry’s head. Voldemort was back, people were going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it but cry as he held Cedric’s cold, lifeless body in his arms afterwards.
Harry ran a hand over the deep blue velvet, noticing that Daphne’s dress really was the perfect colour for the evening. “Harry, you don’t know who Tori was to be engaged to, do you? It’s Draco. Tori had been betrothed to him for as long as I can remember. It was to be a prosperous marriage for my family. We’re purebloods, but not part of the sacred twenty-eight, not that they really matter anymore. To start with, it was a way for Tori to marry into a wealthy family that would look after her. I was always meant to be the one that worked, Tori was given lessons on how to carry herself like aristocracy and I was given extra arithmancy classes.” Harry blinked, trying to follow what Daphne was telling him. “Draco tried ending the betrothal several times, but it couldn’t until Tori turned eighteen. That was in February. It took Draco telling her that he couldn’t give her the marriage she deserved for her to agree to not follow through with the engagement.” Harry frowned and turned to watch Astoria laughing with Neville, the blonde giving Luna a wave as she and Ginny passed them. “She was really depressed for a while, I’m happy that she’s having a good time tonight. I really did want her to just have fun for once. We were never able to growing up.” Daphne put a hand on Harry’s arm, drawing his attention back to her. “You haven’t asked me why Draco ended it.” Daphne raised her eyebrows at him and Harry shrugged. “I don’t think I need to.” He stood up and thanked her quietly for telling him, and she smiled sadly before he walked away.
He spoke briefly about someone but Harry’s attention was drawn to Draco Malfoy, stood watching the Minister from near the entrance. Once the speech was over, everyone started moving about again and Harry gave Luna a quick excuse and squeezed through the crowd before he lost sight of Malfoy.
The trio raced around the room, Ron and Hermione firing spells at the Slytherins, Harry just holding onto the diadem, wondering how they were going to destroy the thing, and what Draco thought he would achieve by chasing after them. All of a sudden, Ron came running back in Harry’s direction, shouting about Crabbe setting off fiendfyre. Red flames careened about in different shapes behind the towers of junk from where Ron had been only seconds before, confirming his screams of terror. Harry’s sole focus was to get out, get Ron and Hermione and get out. As they ran around a corner he spied some old broomsticks and grabbed Ron’s arm, who in turn pulled Hermione to them, the girl shaking her head in despair. Despite the imminent death chasing them, Harry couldn’t help but be filled with nostalgia, being flung back to their first year and flying together to get the winged key in Flitwick’s task.
Knowing what he did now, Harry looked back at his fourth year with bittersweet cynicism. His first real crush, that he had put on Cho, had died in front of him. Typical really, for the Boy Who Lived to have been head over heels for a dead boy. It explained why him and Cho never worked out with both of them mourning the Hufflepuff in their own ways, the girl who had waltzed with him, had been rescued by him in the second task - and the boy who jealously watched from afar and had unknowingly led him to his death.
” Harry felt his breath hitch as Draco let go of his arm, bringing his hand up to the side of his face, leaning ever so slowly towards him. Harry’s eyes widened as Draco glanced to his lips quickly, his eyes boring a hole straight through to Harry’s heart. “
The carriage ride was filled with chatter from Daphne, Harry and Astoria both filling silences when needed, and before long they were pulling up outside the large building. Harry stepped out first and held a hand out to Daphne and Astoria in turn, helping them from the carriage before thanking their driver. Harry hadn’t planned any return travel for the night, but if need be he could side-along both girls back to their home.
remember that she was one of the Slytherins to help on their side in the battle, and he supposed it wouldn’t be too bad to spend an evening with someone that Hermione had deemed her friend.
. And don’t ask someone as a last resort!” Harry groaned as his best friend’s face disappeared from his fireplace, running his hands through his hair. Every year he was expected to go to these Ministry functions, and every year got worse. The more people moved on from the war, the more they found relationships, and the less Harry had to do with them. Not that he didn’t talk to his friends, he did. He had weekly lunches at the Burrow, pub days once a month with Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus, and he even met up with some of the other Auror trainees. It just seemed to be that everyone he knew was pairing off now, and so most of their free time went on their significant others – not on old school friends.
.” Before they could say anything else, a short brunette attached herself to Harry’s arm. “You found Pansy! Hi Pans, how are you darling?” Daphne lunged forwards to give Pansy a kiss on the cheek, somehow managing to still hold on to Harry in the process. Pansy smiled widely at her, as though she hadn’t just been talking about her. “Oh Daph, you should have told me you were coming, I could have given you something to wear. Not that you don’t look gorgeous but…” Daphne laughed, a proper, hearty laugh that wasn’t anything like the girly giggle she had been giving Harry the whole time they were together. “Pans, you flatter me. Don’t you worry, Harry bought this for me yesterday when we decided to go together. It matches the theme perfectly, don’t you think.” Harry watched in confusion as the girls laughed and then he looked between them, and around the room, taking in the decorations properly.
It was not
“Thank you all for coming, and a very blessed yule! I would just like to make a quick personal thank you to Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, for organising this event for us. You have both truly outdone yourselves this year, thank you.” Kingsley raised his glass and both Malfoys nodded to him, lifting their glasses in return, and the rest of the hall raised theirs in a toast. Kingsley sat again, and the chatter started up gradually through the room. Harry turned to Ron and asked him quietly if he knew it was the Malfoys that had done the event. Ron frowned at him and shrugged. “No but I’m not surprised. They did last year, don’t you remember? And the anniversary ball at Hogwarts back in May.” Harry blinked and nodded, acting like it wasn’t brand new information for him, turning back to the conversation the girls were having.
When they were in a relatively quite space, he span towards Daphne and spoke quickly before she could, wary of the daggers she was glaring at him. “I’m sorry, I didn’t think that you might not want her to know Astoria was here. I just knew that she was your friend, and I was trying to extend an olive branch, sort of. I’m sure you know I’ve not exactly been friends with your old housemates, and I wanted to make a good new impression.” Harry let out a breath as Daphne relaxed, turning her bright grin on him again. “Oh, that’s fine then! I was worried you might have said something about the engagement, that’s all.” Harry shook his head, wondering if Daphne’s mood change was genuine, and held his arm out to her again. “Shall we actually find Hermione now?”
Harry was
It took about twenty seconds for Harry to locate Draco, and he would have laughed at himself if the circumstances were different. As it was, he found Draco dancing with Astoria. Harry stood there and stared. Surely his eyes were playing tricks on him, but no, he watched as they left the dancefloor together, smiling easily at each other. If it were possible Harry thought his heart would have broken again at the gentle way they looked at each other. It didn’t matter, he told himself, he had to talk to Draco tonight, or he never would.
The building the gala was being held at this year was in the middle of muggle London, although calling it that wasn’t really accurate. Harry had found out that despite being led to believe that Diagon and it’s surrounding areas were the extent of wizarding London, it wasn’t true. You could walk down any road in the city and if you knew what to look for you would find all manner of shops catering to wixen. It’s why Harry hadn’t been overly surprised to find out the pureblood Greengrass family lived in London – it’s where he lived as well after all.
As they flew through the room, avoiding flames and falling bric-a-brac, Harry’s gaze was caught by Draco and Goyle, climbing onto a tower of abandoned items, desperate to get away from the fiendfyre. Harry didn’t even think before turning around and flying down to reach for Draco, vaguely aware of Ron shouting at him, and the blond immediately threw his hand up to grab Harry’s forearm. Harry used the momentum from the speed of flying to pull Draco up onto the broom behind him, heart clenching as Draco’s arms wound themselves tightly around Harry’s waist.
for Merlin’s sake. Harry just grinned, held Draco’s hand tightly, and apparated them away to Grimmauld Place. After a lot of complaining that Draco couldn’t just leave him, and a lot of persuasion of the kissing variety, Harry had convinced Draco to stay for the night. The blond had been very clear about the terms of this impromptu sleepover, and Harry had agreed that they wouldn’t do anything below the belt. He just wanted to fall asleep next to the extremely handsome young man that he’d spent the last hour snogging. Harry was so happy with the way the night had gone that he didn’t notice the sad look in Draco’s eyes as they both climbed under the thick patchwork duvet. The Gryffindor did his best to stay awake, laying on top of Draco in his eagerness to continue what they had been doing on his sofa, but sleep claimed him quickly.
left. If you’d stayed and talked to me about it, maybe things would have been different.” Draco’s mouth opened but Harry held up a hand. “Please, I need to say this. I forgave you as soon as I had realised that you leaving had been the best choice you could have made, for everyone involved. I couldn’t look at you in public, I couldn’t let myself think about you because I knew that I wouldn’t be able to help myself. I would have gone to you Draco, in a heartbeat. I hated you for not giving me that option before you left, but I – I love you too much to hold a grudge over you for putting your engagement first. I know that you did it to stop me from getting involved in a messy love triangle, or affair, or whatever it would have been.”
Draco felt his mouth go dry as Pansy spoke in a soft, low tone at his ear. His eyebrows drew close together as he glanced over at the greenish-blue eyes waiting longingly for a response. Draco shook his head slowly, his eyes flicking over her expression, "Absolutely not, have you gone bloody insane?" He asked, his left eye twitching ever so slightly at the thought of being surrounded by all of Potters friends; elbows and knees pushed roughly together due to the tight confines of the circular table they would most likely sit at. Draco's mind wandered to the wonderful thought of being pushed beside Harry, his friends shoving them closer together as they jumped out of their seat in a response or to say something 'hilarious'.
have a problem with him. Draco you're practically obsessed with the lad; you stared at him with such longing this morning across the table." She snorted, shaking her head so her hair tossed from side to side.
After about an hour of silence, people started to stir awake from the light that was being cast into their room. Harry shot everyone a smile as they sat up, afraid if he spoke up they'd yell at him to be quieter. "Good morning." Ron groaned out when he sat up, rubbing his forehead to try and will the migraine away. "Morning," Harry responded quietly, making sure to lower his voice so he wouldn't hurt his best friend's head more than it already was. Ron glanced over at Draco, his eyebrows pulling together and lips curving into a frown. "You two are up early, get any sleep?" He asked, suspicion and curiosity running through his tone. Draco's calm and nonchalant expression made Ron think twice about his suspicion, "Matter of fact I didn't, you all tend to snore." he retorted in a somewhat joking manner, his lips curving into a frown at Ron. Harry glanced at the two and let out a sigh, his arms wrapping together in a tight cross. "You two are going to be the death of me. Ron if you're gonna be an outright git, just go back to sleep." He groaned and pulled his left leg up to his chest, his eyes rolling a bit at the shocked expression on Ron's face. Ron huffed out some air and turned around, settling back into his sleeping bag in one swift motion. Draco sighed and stood up, giving everyone who had sat up a sideways glance before settling his gaze on Harry.
Draco leaned back on his arms as he closed his icy grey eyes, small and quiet chirps from the birds flying by echoed through the empty courtyard;  bouncing off the pillars and right back out into the open air. He took a deep breath, the chilled air filling his lungs with a familiar burn that came with each deep breath. He didn't mind sitting outside on a cold day like today, it cleared his tangled mind and allowed him to think by himself with no interruptions. Draco let out a satisfied and quiet hum as he opened his eyes to stare out at the empty courtyard. His mind wandered to the events of today so far; bumping into Harry at the library, getting his robe back, staring at him during potions, getting invited for a hopefully fun night out, it was a rather successful day in Draco's opinion. He didn't snap too much at him, and he actually accepted the invite Harry had given him in the bathroom and it didn't end up with him bleeding out on the floor. He let a small smile grow on his lips as he looked down at his freshly shined black shoes, a small chuckle escaping through his parted lips that were beginning to chap from the cold. "I'm bloody screwed." He said to himself and cupped his head in his hands, a few strands of hair falling from their original pushed back position to rest on his reddened knuckles. He let his shoulders drop with a sigh as he raked his fingers through his hair, feeling the small curls that had made themselves apparent due to the freezing temperatures.
She laughed again and took his hand, following him to an empty space between the groups of drunken partiers.
“Yes.”
When he lifted his head to meet Draco's gaze, he was smirking.
Harry hesitated.
"Here," Seamus muttered, pointing his wand at Harry's temple and whispering a spell.
And now he realized why the voice, even in a different language, had felt somehow familiar and had plucked at his nerves. Harry stood frozen, staring at his old school rival in horror.
are you on about?" Harry interrupted, momentarily stalled. "Nobody told me you were here. I had no idea you were . . . doing . . ." He gestured lamely to the portraits on the wall, feeling his cheeks heat up. "This."
Seamus looked back at him in mild surprise. “She ought to be, hadn’t she? Never seen anyone more dedicated. She’s been practicing day and night for months.”
Finally, Malfoy slammed the book shut and fished a golden key out of his pocket.
Harry couldn’t respond for a moment, because suddenly Malfoy's hands were in his hair, fingers running against his scalp and leaving tingles in their wake. The sensation was
Draco lifted a shoulder. "I would have simply kidnapped you and whisked you back to France. Still considering it, in fact."
"It's better than nothing," the woman was saying reassuringly, bracing to stand. "I'll get out of your hair."
The bed dipped and Harry's heart leapt, but Malfoy was only getting a new angle. When Harry turned himself over onto his back, he saw Malfoy kneeling at the foot of the mattress.
Seamus pretended to look hurt. "That's not fair, Harry!" He complained loudly. "You’re not even going to call her. What are you going to do? Braid each other's hair and talk about boys?"
