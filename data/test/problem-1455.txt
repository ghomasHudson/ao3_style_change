"They're accusing you of interfering in the Ministry while his own crony is in her office drinking tea! And calling one of my students… delusional? How dare they?"
A laugh bubbles up in his chest, God, they’d been having dinner and talking about Draco’s crush on Harry and now Harry was gone and probably being tortured.
"You're right,” Harry gives a firm nod and it looks like he’s trying to convince himself. Draco’s heart hurts. “I'm just being paranoid."
He realises, belatedly, that Harry’s not looking at him. Not in a way that shows he’s away in his head-- He’s… literally not seeing anything.
article regarding Voldemort's return, and growing exasperated as none did, in a fit of petty rage, Harry had canceled his subscription.
Harry sticks his finger in the jar and smears the peanut butter on the back of Draco's hand. Draco winces harder and Harry grabs his sandwich.
Draco mutely follows, scarcely catching Harry mildly scowling at the man's back in something akin to grudging distrust, before his face is blocked by a chalky wall and the pasted sea shells.
Draco doesn't know why he asks such a thing. The bag is right there in his line of sight, he's pulled the robe to wrap Draco's shoulder from the very said bag. He huffs and points at the thing with his chin.
He’s a light sleeper, so he’s fairly confident that he’s aware of most of them, but he feels awful when Harry has to deal with them alone. Particularly because he can’t remember a single night in Shell Cottage when Harry wasn’t there for him when he woke up gasping and disoriented.
He remembers how his breath had caught in his chest like a caged bird. How his body had trembled and his heart skipped a beat and his head had gushed out blood.
Some part of him, a minuscule voice in the background, wishes that it was always like this for them. Harry and Draco against the world. No war, no magic. Just them. Maybe they would live here, in Market Deeping, in that cute apartment between the bakery and a pet shop.
"Change out of those before you touch any food," she barks, and Harry nods, turning away before she clears her throat.
He tears his eyes away with the yearning still burning in his chest and stumbles to his door, groggy still and somewhat dizzy on his feet.
' and so far he had gotten to the part where he's hanging out with Sirius in their own lawn, and chugging chilled Butterbeer, and just talking about life. Maybe he's telling him a story about one of the mischiefs Sirius and James had gotten up to during their time.
"Nope," Draco says, popping the ‘p’. It was uncouth, but he hasn’t had the time to be the proper pureblood wizard for a while now.
Harry shakes his head. “It’s not, I’m sorry. I’ve been acting so weird, and all this food is going to waste, our supplies aren’t going to last us for long if this keeps happening and I-.”
“Easier that way, like ripping off the bandaid.” Harry smiles, looking a little sheepish, until he glances down at his chest, where two almost identical lines had snaked down the length of half his torso. So covered in blood it’s difficult to distinguish where they begin or end.
A chorus of protest and frustrated groans arise all around the office, all synchronised with the scene of chaos around them.
"Draco is staying out of this,” he says, not turning towards Sirius, “I'm not... I'm not gonna do anything, Sirius. I'm just counting. I need to tire myself out."
“I’m going to do it. We need to take our chance,” even though he’s fairly certain that the cells are noise proofed. He has to try. They could give them some water, at the very least. It could at least help lower the fever.
It’s derailing his tactics, not that he’d show them, of course, but Draco knows that in order to have the upper hand on Potter in this strange dance that they’re doing now he needed to get his act together. Potter’s relatives were dead, he was still being tortured by a maniac and he was just… Not Potter.
He hates upsetting Harry, and he hates doing this wrong. He just keeps screwing things up. Harry hasn't been dating him for a full day yet and he might break up with him now on the spot.
He doesn't spend much time attempting to pick the padlock on his cupboard either, he figures that if he is unable to lock it back up after, or damage it, Uncle Vernon is going to blame magic and damage him in return, so he kisses any thoughts of homework goodbye and aimlessly lounges on the couch for a bit.
"This might be a little disconcerting," the man says in a clipped voice, before wrapping his arm around Harry in a weird parody of a hug.
Remus snorts, but then says in a more serious voice, "You have the time and the nerve to handle two teenagers.” He shrugs, “One of them is a genius already, the other is too lazy to try, but they're smart kids. They want to learn."
Or maybe it's not Hogwarts that he's trying to avoid, but the events that took place there last year. Cedric's death is still fresh on his mind.
"Oh no complaints now, Potter." She turns around and looks over the horizon, "You have been terribly naughty." She clicks her tongue, the picture of a disappointed parent. He'd take the Dursleys over her any day. There was never a day where they hadn't been disappointed in him. Or rather, disappointed that he was still there in their house and alive. Harry had never liked them, but they'd also never sent his skin crawling like she did. And now they are dead. Why couldn't
"Of course this is the work of a fanatic. They're called Death Eaters," the clock on Fudge's wall provides a rhythmic click as the silence between them turns from interrogative to awkward, dwindling as Fudge swallows down his scone and taps his desk with chubby, nervous fingers.
Harry shoots him a glare, eyes red-rimmed and… desperate. "Then how can I have been there? And done those things? How could you be there and do nothing? Draco begged you. I was there. Right next to you, and he begged you to do something, and you just stared right back at him. You did nothing and I didn't either."
Only one other person knew the significance of that quill and knew that Lucius would never willingly part with such a precious gift from his beloved wife.
"Yeah something like that," he hadn't come here for company, he needs the exact opposite of that, but he figures that he cannot escape that easily just yet. 'Just grab a glass of water and then bail after another apology,' he orders himself. That should be good enough for them.
He gets up, first to his knees and then starts hobbling around the dark barn. His left leg leaves a grotesque trail of black droplets of blood as he bends and picks up a few broken wooden boards.
Before he can even try returning Hermione's crushing hug, he's wrenched out of her arms and Sirius is in front of him, frantically looking him up and down as if he expects Harry to suddenly combust.
"They're not freaky. They're pretty." how could someone who sees a fucking stain as much more than it could be, think of it as freaky? It’s wonderous, anything beyond the regular imagination. Draco envies him for it, but also can’t imagine anyone else harbouring that kind of power other than Harry.
"What?" He asks as Harry pulls out his shaking hand. The dim moonlight shines on the silver gleam of the knife. It's a potion knife, small but looks incredibly sharp. No wonder Severus had it on him.
'You're running away from yourself,” Harry sees Sirius shrug from the corner of his eyes, ‘One little scare from that hooked nose git and all you can think about is being tied to a bed and left to rot. Stop it.'
After a few minutes of periodically freaking out, and crouching over to check on Draco’s rising temperature, Harry really cannot handle any more of this.
Harry immediately catches on his unsaid words. His eyes dart to the matches and the knife and then he looks back to Draco.
If it had been any other occasion, Harry might have even enjoyed the scenery, it was all very minimalistic, but at the same time, Harry got the impression that Market Deeping was a page out of a fairytale town directory.
It's quite hard for him to comprehend, it's as if his body is trying to contain an inner earthquake that would cause havoc if unleashed. Harry wishes it to unleash, if only the tremors would cease.
"Because you did, didn't you? You killed the Diggory boy because he fell for your act the same way everyone did. Then you hid behind his ass like a squealing pig, and waited for him to take the brunt of it." He, of course, knows it isn't true. But at the moment, all Draco cares about is hurting Potter. And that comment seems to hit the mark.
"Tell him no," Kingsley snaps, making his way through the waist-length stacks of incomplete paperwork. They needed to reduce those, and soon.  "One more damn paper plane and the whole office bursts!"
"My stuff is in the cupboard," he nods at it and quickly starts heading to the stairs, he feels Tonks following after him, probably to help him pack. "I need to get some things from my room too,"
"Exactly. And speaking further on the attack itself, I can assure every wizard reading this article, that this was an unplanned, one-time occurrence, it will not happen again, and our top Aurors are leading an investigation at this very second to arrest the culprit."
"I'm sorry. I want to let you know you're special to me. That you're different like I'm different to you."
“This location is discreet," he tries to sound soothing. Torture victim. Potter is a torture victim, fragile mentality, all that deranged details that Severus could care less about. He should care now. "No one knows of it, no one ever will. You will never, listen very carefully,
"This won't put you in his good graces," each word out of his mouth takes an eternity to articulate.
The pressure would help abate the blood flow. He's known that, his mother told him that, when she was teaching how to manually bandage wounds. When he was a child. When things were easy.
“There’s nothing for it,” Potter says as he clenches his hand into fists and shoves them behind his back.
Draco feels pretty useless, but he doesn’t know the first thing about cooking, he never needed to. Malfoy Manor had their fair share of house elves to do that for him, he doesn't have the slightest concept of what to do with raw ingredients.
Harry isn't shaking as much. It's as if there's only half of a presence in his body, and the tremors that run down his arms and legs seem half hearted, a natural, uninterrupted cycle. While Potter's eyes stay glazed, somehow glassy in a way.
“Right,” he says, voice low. He looks towards Harry, who is now eyeing the pitcher of water with suspicion.
This is Rosier's idea of revenge. Of course it is, he blames Harry for what Voldemort did to him, seemingly unaware of the fact that
"What are you doing?" He winces when he has to crouch. The fire had died down sometime while they slept. The barn is dark and the moonlight isn’t enough to see clearly. He can’t see what Harry’s doing.
He stuffs the book in the bag and is about to use the spell when his eyes catch the dark robe draped over the couch’s arm. His school robe, the one he’d been wearing when they’d been kidnapped from Hogwarts.
He doesn’t know why Harry wants to bother with all that, but if it will make him feel better, then Draco isn’t going to deny him that. The only problem here would be: "We don't have owls."
"Well then, perhaps, you should be off a bit early today." She waves a hand. "Come over here so I can inspect your hand,"
Draco doesn’t even know if it is morning yet. The dark circles under Harry’s eyes look even more pronounced than ever, and Draco wonders if his face is any better. Then he has to suppress the urge to laugh, his fingers keep tracing the cut on his face. He's not allowing mortification to kick in, just yet. He feels disgusting.
"He's a killer, Potter." Umbridge points out. "Took thirteen muggles and his friend out with a single explosion. Not unlike the one that caused your relatives' deaths,"
"So you better cry in secret," Potter continues, face contorted in disgust. Myrtle’s ghost appears behind him before flickering out again. "Because no one is going to spare you any sympathy."
Draco just shakes his head before raising his wand. They’d have to be quick after this. He’s already going to apparate. And after that, the ministry would be able to track them here.
Harry wants to slap the revolting touch away but everything is too heavy. Everything is so slow. There's a pit of wrongness at the bottom of his stomach.
Remus Lupin has never felt more put out in his life than the moment he's asked to go babysit at Hogwarts.
Upon reaching their intended destination, Potter starts retching on the ground, although, impressively enough he doesn’t propel his innards on the floor, and, surprisingly, pulls himself together pretty quickly, he crawls the short distance towards Draco. His pupils are blown wide and his hands flutter over Draco's body in panicked gestures. Severus panics just by looking at Potter. The boy exudes pure distress.
Time passes. He doesn't know how much of it. Hedwig just preens and nibbles and flies across the room, shedding a couple of feathers on the floor. He'd have to clean that tomorrow.
"You're the one loitering as if you own the place!" Dolohov cries, a large frown on his own face. Rosier regards him with disgust.
"FILTHY MUDBLOODS IN MY HOUSE! I WON'T HAVE IT! BEGONE YOU FILTHY ANIMALS, BE GONE!" Harry flinches at the sudden screeching. Which faintly reminds him of Uncle Vernon.
There's a pause, Potter struggles to breathe rightly, "I found out… sometime ago. I don't know the time,"
"What?” Draco says, shaking his head. They have to get to Slughorn as soon as possible. He can’t let Harry suffer any longer. They’re so close. “No. The rain is gonna stop soon we can make it--"
"I am panicking Ron!” She squeezes his hands tightly, “This is happening, we're going to be in so much trouble if anyone finds out but I've never felt like anything is more right than doing this, even though it's wrong--"
Potter scrambles to his feet, trembling all over, violently shaking as he holds onto Draco’s legs and Severus lifts him from his waist. Together, they quickly transfer a bleeding Draco to the worn, red sofa. The fabric is immediately stained black upon making contact with the blonde.
Potter goes very red in the face, his nostrils flaring. "Choose my words?!" he yells incredulously. "Who do you think you are? Get over yourself, you self righteous bloody prat! Your words mean nothing to me,"
Harry is an enigma. A puzzle that Draco cannot quite figure out, no matter how hard he tries, there's just something about him, a mystic force field that had revealed itself a few days after they had successfully settled inside the cottage. The Shell Cottage, as Harry likes to call it.
He just hopes whatever that glance was about, it wasn’t anything too important. His stomach feels heavy from uneasiness, but he tries to ignore it.
He steers clear away from them and heads for the park, judging by the darkening sky and rolling clouds, it should be mostly vacant by now.
'You're hurting,’ Sirius says, his gaze intense, almost challenging, ‘Do you know why you are on a train? Do you even know where you are going? Do you know how he found you?'
Harry's eyes scan the rest of the people. There's another 'familiar' face. He opens his mouth, but Mad-Eye Moody beats him to it.
He thinks about his time in Barns Green in West Sussex. One of the rare occasions when his parents had indulged in one of his fixations. They’d gone to a farm to see beehives and honey collections. It’d been run by a squib.
Harry groans. "No.,” he says, vehemently shaking his head. “No, don't connect the two.” he looks into Ron’s eyes beseechingly. Ron realises that this is the last time they’re ever going to probe him about the Cedric incident.
"The effects of the poison fade the moment you die from it, rendering your death into a tragic, albeit natural accident," Severus interrupts.
“Mr. Harry Potter sir has to be very quiet,” a squeaky voice says from the opposite side of the cell and Harry scrambles to sit up. There she stands, eerily quiet and wringing her hands.
'He's not well,' were Valentina's exact words. Harry certainly doesn't look well, but would he let Draco take them to a complete stranger, who was recommended by a death eater?
again. But the look on Malfoy's face says it all. He looks horrified, and past Harry's shoulder, at the woman standing behind her.
Harry nodded and left the room, the sounds of his feet melting into the sounds of waves crashing as he went upstairs.
"As I was saying,” she juts out her chin and speaks more evenly, “We need to learn things that'll actually help us out with our O.W.Ls
Harry and Remus finally reach the portrait and Remus brushes past him, grasping the edges of two forlorn curtains and pulling them together by force, and the woman abruptly stops, momentarily shocking the chaotic crowd into silence.
He is panting slightly, and looking pale. His wand is trembling in his hand which is still pointed at Umbridge.
He holds Draco's sleeve, as they quickly make their way down the stairs, their heads ducked down. Draco smiles at him from the corner of his eyes, and Harry smiles back. It's ridiculous, the juvenile mirth with which Harry thinks about their first 'Date'.
Forcing? He wants to laugh, and he probably does let out something resembling a twisted chuckle. She
"Hmm, deep enough," she comments, turning his hand over a few times before looking up at him. "Your next detention is on Wednesday. Two pm, sharp. I would hate it for you to be late, young man."
Severus waits, stoic still even as his mind screams at him to hurry, body pulled taut, even though he keeps his stance deceptively casual. Lucius breaks the silence, stands up, moving towards Severus.
In the middle of the commotion, Harry hears Arthur Weasley over the shrieking woman. "No, still no word from the ministry," he says. Behind him, Remus pushes them both through the hallway, even though Harry's unconsciously digging his feet into the floorboards. "None of the dementors have been reported missing,"
And to make matters worse, he is somewhat responsible for his self-exile in a way. He isn't even getting the Daily Prophet anymore.
"Draco?" Harry turns to him, attentive. His hands grab Draco's good shoulder, before the other one resettles against his arm. "Look at me."
Draco freezes for a second. He is vaguely aware of the muggle money system but he is more than sure that there's no such a thing as 'Quid'.
'You did well, kiddo,' Harry doesn't feel deserving of that sort of validation, coming from himself no less, but he's too worn out to argue, so he just lays there and wishes for a break. A place shrouded in absolute darkness, with no sound or sight, or movement. Just him floating around with no worries.
"Yes," Harry interrupts before Draco can worry about it. "I accidentally cut my finger, and it bled a lot." He scowls at Severus, "Does that mean it's the poison?"
'You were always so bad at math,” Sirius speaks over Harry, “Mrs Simon's hit you once with a ruler, because you couldn't tell what comes after ninety-nine. Do you remember?'
He transfigures the boots into well-fitting dark grey sneakers. Harry sighs above him. Draco thinks it could be a relief.
Harry sighs a little as he finishes the glass. His hands are still trembling badly. Draco doubts he could have held the glass himself even if he’d wanted to.
Living with Harry Potter as opposed to only seeing him in classes for no longer than a small glimpse during the years is somewhat different than Draco had been expecting. Of course the mere prospect of being in
Harry screams and rolls on the floor, his limbs are tense even as they jerk against the curse. Fuck he hates this. He really does.
Severus resists the urge to close his eyes, and pulls out a vial of pepper up potion from his robes. It’s not ideal, at all, but it’ll have to do. Keeping Potter alive is more important than thinking about the repercussions of potion use and its effects on Potter's damaged body.
"Did you pack us any food?" Harry lowers them both down. He feels most of the tension leaving his body gradually. Sleep should come easy, whether Draco wants it or not. He's so tired, and he's still in pain.
"It's fine,” Harry shakes his head, leaning against Draco to show he’s not upset, “It's just, they forced me to cook. It was a chore. Not something I loved doing. I'm good at it because I had to be."
Harry can barely make out his face, he gets no chance to do so, the man is already on the move, dragging Harry behind him in a stride that's not quite a run but too close to be called 'Firm walking'. Harry hits the man with weak hands, his breath thundering in his ears and his legs shaking noodles.
He hasn't used the damn thing for so long, that he didn't even think about pulling it on Rosier. He's such a moron, such a fucking moron.
“Hey Myrtle,” he says as he makes his way over to a basin, turning on the water and peeling the scarf off his hand. He winces as it sticks to the cuts. Some of it has begun to dry already, and the cuts burn as Harry peels the cloth all the way.
"And so did you, Ron.” she cuts in, “We're not failing miserably at this. Forty people… we have forty students now."
“Why won’t you be honest with yourself?” Draco sneers now. “Do you really think that you could ever in any capacity, live up to your mother’s reputation in the dark lord’s eyes? Either of them? He doesn’t, and I bet this is fun for him.”
Draco looks hesitant, and honestly, Harry had expected that. But also, he can't help the tiny hint of irritation that sparks in his chest when Draco resists. Harry needs to blow off steam, he really needs his alone time, this is becoming too much.
"No seriously!" He is being serious. Draco can tell. That's the worst and simultaneously the best part of it, "As far as first dates go, this one isn't half bad." His smile expands into a grin, "But for future reference… Quid means Pound. It's slang, tiger."
"I think so as well," Harry would pay an unimaginable sum of money to watch this woman get devoured by a group of ruthless hungry cats. Anything.
Draco, at least during their time together, has cracked the puzzle. Sort of. Any word or expression even hinting on Harry's own welfare is uttered with irony. There's a hierarchy to the words as well, and 'okay' is surprisingly down the list as far as Draco is concerned.
Draco feels strangely calm as he follows Umbridge down the stairs. He knows there is no way in hell that she is just 'accompanying him to his dormitory'.
She blocks the hex very easily, smiling, shaking her head. "Potter, you're just making it worse for yourself."
"He's not a baby, Moody, he knows his way up the stairs," Bill snaps, his eyes losing some of their previous humor.
Potter not-so-discreetly buries his bleeding hand under the other one, scowl deepening, “None of your business, Malfoy.”
Harry is kind of counting on such a fate if he happens to befall to Voldemort's wand. Or Bellatrix's torture. Whichever comes first, a tiny part of Harry is ready for it.
Next chapter update, 18th June, Friday, BUT, keep an eye out for the second interlude posted on the Friday before.
"Why don't you two take a seat?" Maggie says and Harry takes Draco's hand again, the stolen wallet clenched in his other hand as he herds him to the flimsy folding chairs and the table.
Harry reads the clock and then looks at her, then the clock again before he gazes down at his own wristwatch. It shows five minutes
Draco’s hands still on Harry’s arm, and he turns the word over in his mouth. That was a name only his mother had ever called him. Sometimes father, but usually Mother. He’d never been familiar enough with anyone else for them to use it, not even Severus or Blaise. He doesn’t know how he’d feel if Harry started calling him that, especially in that- that voice of his.
"I want a… dated one. The older the better," he is talking right out of his ass. He has no idea how pickles work, he has no idea how wine works either.
"Master says this is all Harry Potter sir is allowed to have, and Twinky is to retrieve the basin and rag in two hours time before Mistress Bella arrives. Master says to give Harry Potter a child's dose of fever reducing potion," she hands Harry the gleaming red vial and steps back, throwing a forlorn glance down at Draco. But Harry isn't following her gaze, and is instead watching the measly amount of potion rolling inside the vial. It's pathetic. Not even nearly enough for a child.
Draco still isn't used to the speeding cars when they find a bus station. It has chairs, a roof, and there's a yellow sign with grass sprouting here and there.
It's as if he's watching a painting out of the portrait, just living around him, as if Draco is the painting himself. He hates it but cannot help feeling a thrill shoot up his chest at once.
Harry slightly shakes his head, and his eyes focus on Malfoy, seeing the other boy's startled and confused eyes gazing back at him. Harry swiftly turns around, picking his Transfiguration book to stuff it in his school bag.
"I do. I was there." The image plays over in his mind whenever he is idle. Whenever he can’t think of something to occupy himself with. But he’s not drinking himself halfway to death.
"Are you starting a cult?" Draco asks as they enter the house. Words that Draco never thought he'd say, not in a totally non-ironic manner to Harry Potter. But here he is, and so are the seagulls. Inside their safe house.
"You can have that and way more with magic," Draco sniffs, raising his chin as Harry rolls his eyes.
Ron, who is sitting next to her, nods, "For anyone who hasn't gotten the memo yet, we hate Umbridge, we want to pass the exams and also not die. This isn't a resistance band, it's a glorified study group.” He looks around, meeting as many eyes as possible, “Any questions?"
Fudge's smile fades into a stressed frown. "Here's the thing, John. I do not believe in stringing theories and causing unnecessary panic. You know how Muggles are yourself, always running around, doing their thing, living their lives… I honestly think the chances of this being an accident is much more probable than that of an organized ambush."
Harry starts walking and they flap around him, some settling back on his shoulders and head, while another lands on his shaking arm.
"I need to be with him. I like being with him," Harry says firmly. He won’t let Sirius- his own subconscious- ruin this.
There’s a flurry of feathers and wings, mixed together with loud, obnoxious squacks as Harry pulls himself up. It’s all so chaotic that Draco takes several steps back, almost tempted to take his wand out.
"This is rubbish," Hermione mutters, rustling the papers with an incredulous frown and Ron snatches one of them to look for himself. Harry tries to look interested in his bowl of oatmeal and blueberries but miserably fails.
"You shouldn't have to know!" Moody firmly taps his finger to his temple. "It's all about constant -"
They can't wear the clothes here. Not yet. It's a small place, it's rarely crowded. If someone sees them with the clothing and recognizes them then they'll be in big trouble.
"It's not as bad as my potion making skills," Harry says for lack of a better thing to say. He is now very much aware of how much he regrets inviting Snape to stay over just to force feed him extra boiled vegetables as revenge.
"Curb your tongue, boy! As I was saying," she takes a deep breath, taking in the strong odor of bleach wafting around the kitchen. "We're leaving you to take care of the house. I already left you the list of chores, you'd better not skip any. I counted the food in the fridge too, only the ones on the low shelf are for you, and that's it. I'll know if you've fooled around,"
Draco isn’t as surprised. He knows that Severus brewed potions for the dark lord, he knew Severus is great at potions. So really, it was only a matter of time until one backfired.
Harry gives him a smile, "You're good at justifying things. Have you ever thought about being a lawyer as a career?"
Songs that Draco does not recognize, muggle probably, it's funny but strangely comforting at once. It baffles Draco, to such extent that he occasionally leaves the book he's reading- The Dire Effects of Moonstone in Brewery- to just sit and watch Harry.
Title drop! Also, word of caution, suicide warning for anyone who wants to listen to the title song and/or watch the music video. (Talk Me Down)
When he wakes up, he is still warm. But not the burning, scorching heat from before. He makes a noise in his throat, before quickly stifling it, wide eyes darting around the grey corners of the cell, as if Bellatrix is about to pop out with a loud ‘Boo!’ before proceeding to reduce him to a writhing, screaming mess again.
"I'm really sorry," he groans, "I really am but I've told you this before, even I don't know where Harry is. Not Sirius, nor any other Order member but Albus. You cannot send letters. I know this sucks, it does for us too,"
"Alright," Harry wonders whether they're dumping him with their neighbor Mrs. Figg or taking him along to Marge's house. Probably force him to sleep in the kennels with the dogs. Harry winces.
"I know." Severus steps back, crossing his arms over his chest, "I don't need a full recount, Mr. Potter."
His grasp couldn’t have hurt worse than the fucking punctures in Harry’s forearm, bleeding almost profusely. There’s too much blood to make out the damage properly. How many times did he ram the nail into his arm? How did he not
"There's a motel over there," Harry says, and Draco looks at him. He has no idea how Harry saw that through his fogged-up glasses. But sure enough, he can see a stark red
Ron purses his lips, he's been mostly quiet during their pitch, "We can handle it, Remus," he says, his eyes are intense and focused,  "We need to do something, and it's clear that Umbridge won't. What if there's another attack?"
Draco turns his head to look at him, "If it was for a good cause, which it was, I'd say it's not too morally corrupt."
'That guy only keeps on making trouble,' Imaginary Sirius commented after Remus left and Harry aimlessly stood in the common room, feeling a blazing heat of anger and indignation wash over him. Dumbledore was gone. Sirius almost got caught. He was a witness to a murder no one knew about.
He's cut off by a shrill woman screaming her throat raw. "BLOOD TRAITORS, FILTHY SCUMS IN MY HOUSE!"
"It's tactical," Draco answers instead of Severus. "Quite brilliant actually. And handy enough to garner the right amount of praise and attention."
"Professor McGonagall would have had a harder time with our pitch," Hermione agrees and also reaches for her bag and a shot of dread surges down Remus's spine.
But then he looks into Harry’s face, and the stark concern they harbour. His eyes, bright with tears and worry, staring into his own. That’s why he did it. Despite the rejection, Draco still cares for Harry. And he knows Harry cares for him, despite every mistake he’s ever made.
When the sun starts setting, and the weather cools down a little, he decides that he is feeling too cooped in. And since no one is here to stop him, he might as well go out and enjoy his limited freedom.
"I knew you wouldn't resist a dramatic end," the woman growled, kicking Harry's wand away from the man's hand. "Edward's bones incite you, don't they?"
"Was that all?" Remus is asking as he runs downstairs, disrupting Harry's thoughts. Out of the three of them, Remus seems the most frantic; Harry momentarily wonders why. He nods at Remus and holds Hedwig close to his chest.
Then Harry is leaning forward and Draco stops breathing. Harry is leaning forward, towards Draco’s face and he’s frozen for a moment. He can’t, this can’t be happening.
He doesn't answer Draco, doesn't turn to look at the sea either, he just blinks and trails back to the kitchen, silently venturing to fetch a spoon to hollow the potatoes.
"You better run along now, before we'd be forced to extend your punishment, Mr. Potter. Don't you think?"
Severus has seen Crucio victims before, hundreds of times, throughout his youth and onward. The degree varies, from Mad-Eye Moody's twitching eye to Frank Longbottom's constant seizures. Potter is dangerously tipping toward the latter.
He grabs the note and then curses as he realizes that his glasses are still broken, stuffed in the back of his pocket. Squinting his eyes, Harry tries his best to read the writing by leaning closer to the note. Remus makes a confused noise but then sighs to himself.
With a frown, Harry realizes that all the letters Ron and Hermione had sent to him had been cryptic as hell. Vague and not actually giving him any information. It was as if they were ignoring his letters, in which he kept asking them about the Wizarding World situation. What was Voldemort doing? What was happening? Were they all alright? Were they hiding something?
Harry hums, gently lays his head on his good shoulder. It's done gingerly and carelessly at once. Harry grabs his hand.
Harry grabs the knife, looks at Draco's shoulder, gazes down at the matches, and then puts the knife down. Finally, he takes the damn soother.
But he also doesn't need to be Morris Prewett to know that. He doesn't need to be a dead man to smell a conspiracy coming.
The other wand is even more familiar than Harry’s. With a hand trembling almost as violently as Harry’s, his fingers close around the ornate handle. It fits perfectly in his hands. Just like it used to in his mother’s.
"And saving lives,” she says firmly. This isn’t about breaking rules. Breaking rules is… it’s collateral. This is about Harry and saving lives. “I'm not afraid, Ron. We can do this, for Harry, and for ourselves. Besides... you're a badass boyfriend."
But today, in that cave, whatever the potion had made Albus see… It had rattled him. He knew, theoretically, that Albus was just another wizard. Powerful, yes, with his hands in too many schemes to count. Intelligent and manipulative, yes. But also, just another man with pasts, and regrets.
It's so difficult for Harry to get back up from the chairs, his hands are shaking badly, and Draco bites the inside of his cheek. The cold is gonna hurt him again.
Severus knows this is an important moment, that he should probably give them their time, but he can’t ignore the fact that they are running on a deadline, that they’re still in enemy territory.
"Will you be staying for dinner?" Harry asks, looking dead into Severus's eyes. It confuses Draco, horribly. What had the man done to him when Draco wasn't looking? Harry is not outright offensive, but Draco can feel the anger and withheld frustration coming off the other boy in waves, even as his face is pleasantly polite, if not a bit snarky.
His lord sneers down at him. "You are a fool, Evan," Nagini finally moves down with a hiss aimed at her master, down Evan's bleeding chest and nestles on his hips. "Just like a mindless child, I cannot leave you to your own devices."
He also feels, strange as it may seem, that he's the only person, only remotely getting used to Umbridge's dictatorship these past two days.
"Nah, just puppy.,” Harry hesitantly smiles, “It's stupid, I've never told this to anyone. Most people call me bonkers when I tell them this stuff."
"Oh, grow a pair, Potter" Malfoy snaps and snatches the vial back, dumping it inside his school bag along with the rest of the vials. Harry watches him, feeling his stomach clench. He should probably bring it up now, when Malfoy seems the calmest.
As always, thanks a bunch to our wonderful, one-of-a-kind beta, Amar! He always makes our chapters so much better, and making us write our best. He’s one of our most invested readers and we love him! XD
"It is,” Draco faintly agrees, “Doesn't beat the one in Diagon alley though," his favourite was the Butterbeer one, it had a bitter aftertaste that Draco really liked. His mother had loved the mint chocolate chip, and his father never ate ice cream with them. Although Draco had seen him getting a second serving of rose sorbet in that one dining place they’d been to a few times.
“It’s fine,” Draco mutters, still staring at the wand. His father had kept it. He’d thought that the Dark Lord, or perhaps Bellatrix, would have snapped it. But no, father had kept this, and he’d given it to him. Tears prick his eyes, both his father and mother were dead. And all that he had of them right now was this wand. Not really a relic but also a stark reminder of what had happened.
Market Deeping doesn't have any woods or visible forest nearby for them to duck behind, not to Harry's knowledge anyways. It is actually a quaint place, with neat cobblestoned streets, and crammed shops.
"Without warm-ups? Are you insane, Ron? Come on, shed the books and the binder, Hermione go change your clothes, and Ron stop dissing my eating habits. I'm rocking the beer-cereal cuisine." He honestly thinks that’s the only thing keeping him sane right now. And Remus.
“What do you expect of filthy blood, Bella?” Rosier replies. Harry imagines Sirius spitting in the man’s face.
Severus jerks his head towards the stairs, gesturing for Harry to leave, but lingers back for a second and turns to him, “Draco.”
Just as nonchalantly as before, even as his mind pressed down on him to mind the ticking seconds and Rosier’s hands on his son, Lucius walked to his fireplace, and the floo flared. He dropped the golden quill into the flame while whispering the location.
No one else is there, the area looks completely deserted, just miles and miles of sand stretching behind him, and endless sea stretching vast on the other side of him. The sun has long since dipped past the horizon. It's dark enough that one cannot quite tell the sea and the sky apart anymore.
"I like how that sounds.” Harry then proceeds to grab Draco’s hands and then wrap them around himself, resting his own hands around Draco’s wrists, keeping them there. Draco doesn’t mind. Of course, he fucking doesn’t. This is amazing. “How did you know that?"
Rosier just laughs, "You think this is pain?" His tone is chiding, as if Harry is an unruly kid, misbehaving.
"Oh no, I shall escort Mr. Malfoy back to his dormitory." Draco's eyes narrow and Harry glances between the two, feeling highly uncomfortable.
Thanks a bunch to our Beta Amar for editing, whom we shamefully forgot to mention during the last update! He's doing a great job, any other typos are solely our own fault.
Harry nods, "Yeah. I got it wrong on the grocery list. She made me eat the entire jar, then hit me with her wooden spoon." Then he sees Draco's furious expression and slightly flinches, "Sorry I didn't mean to say that…"
The last but in no way the least important one, was that Harry, according to an enraged imaginary Sirius, standing in the corner, and shouting abuse, is a natural born killer. And that killing Bellatrix, in the grand scheme of things would really benefit the war effort and lessen his suffering. Harry has no breath left to argue with his violent imaginations, and he’s frankly too gone to respond with any ounce of decorum. So he doesn’t. He keeps screaming because if he doesn’t, if he shuts off that one last outlet then he’s sure that he’ll lose it.
"You wouldn't be here if you weren't. Our Lord was too soft on you and your family." the man's lips draw back to reveal his pearly white teeth, somehow sharper than one would have expected. Draco returns the glare with a sneer of his own.
"Oh yes, but you were his favorite," she purrs and Harry instinctively shifts in his seat. He doesn't like the gleam in her eyes.
His initial reaction should have been sneering in disgust, but it's not. She's just like them, if not cleaner, and she's smiling at them, even though they look worse for wear.
Harry grasps his wrists and moves them to the side, quickly wetting the areas on his shirt where it is sticking to his skin, and the shirt itself, and while it made pulling away slightly easier, he still hisses when Harry attempts it.
Harry jumps and almost falls back on his butt when he hears Moody's thundering voice. Had he been in the kitchen the whole time?
“Go, Severus!” Lucius yells, he casts a shield around himself to evade Avery’s curse. Another blasting curse from Rosier, who is now getting up on his feet again, makes the whole room shake as the table is split apart. Draco staggers backwards, his head knocking against the fireplace as he grasps at its edges.
"She's basically throwing us out," George agrees with a dramatically wounded expression, a hand over his chest, and Mrs. Weasley huffs.
His fingers trace the book splayed before him, like the wings of a moth, it was unbelievably delicate under his touch. But he wouldn't hurt the book, no, he knew better, the price of fragile things.
He stays for fifteen additional minutes after Potter leaves, it’s ridiculously late, especially since Potter showed up so late, but Draco is too cautious to be seen with the other boy in any shape or form. So he generously offers Potter the leaving slip and settles back on the ground, watching Potter disappear from view.
He feels Harry stiffen beside him, but continues on, as confidently as possible, "No. Just us. One room, if possible."
Harry breathes through his clenched teeth. He can't focus on a word the man is breathing into his ear.
"You touched what was mine," he says. "You put your grimy fingers upon the boy whose blood is the reason I'm standing here right now. You tortured the boy without an ounce of preservation after my explicit orders
“I’ll be up as soon as possible, make sure you are ready.” Severus swallows, continuing, "Accommodations have been made, you can join us." Although, he knows already what the answer is going to be.
Tonks's hair flares a deep purple as Mrs. Weasley mentions her full name, but she doesn't do anything other than mildly frown.
"Sometimes, I just adore how you can't pick up on irony and sarcasm, ma cerise," Draco drawls, resting his chin on Harry’s head, preventing him from looking up at him.
different to him. Draco doesn’t need any silly nicknames to see that, to prove it. Harry is the most special person in Draco’s life. He’s never felt this way about anyone, not even any of his obsessions had commanded as much attention from him as Harry does, or for so long.
"Calm. Yeah, calm is easy.” The boy turns his head away and chuckles, the laugh bubbling out of him resembling something that’d suit Black more than Potter, “I just witnessed two murders and a gore show, calm is easily manageable."
On the days he's feeling particularly sassy, he imagines her face without a mouth, just smooth flesh over a mouth that hurls too many hurts in this world. Harry isn't his aunt's first and only victim. Nearly anyone else other than Vernon or Dudley has gotten the brunt of Aunt Petunia's tongue at least once.
Hermione doesn’t leave. She just transfigures her skirt into a pair of pants and summons a pepper up.
Potter rolls his eyes at him. "Well, you're more than welcome to use any other bathrooms at your leisure," he says. "This one isn't in use anyway."
The imaginary Sirius keeps on goading him, and Harry carries on with the light-hearted - albeit deeply sad and disturbed- dialogue in his head. In the end, when he's down to two remaining weeds, Ron and Hermione are included in the game as well, Ron on his own Nimbus and Hermione tucked under a tree with a gigantic book, because why not? That'll make her happy. Happier than she is in this life, probably.
The barn too, is abandoned, just like he’d thought. There are none of the animals tottering around like they had been the last time. One of the large doors is broken and hanging off the hinges. The paint is peeling and dull in the moonlight. It feels as rotten as Draco is feeling inside.
Harry drops himself on Rosier and starts throwing punches, his closed fists are shaking, from anger and the damage. The sharp stabbing pains in his hands send his eyes prickling with tears.
"Nothing is going to happen in five minutes, Draco,” Harry snaps. He feels like an asshole for being this manipulative, but there is honestly no way that he can handle Draco right now. For his sake, not for Harry's.
“Draco?” the boy mumbles, still irrationally hot to touch, and flushed in the face. Harry tries once more but the response is much about the same.
for this to be over already. His lord spares him one last glare and then flicks his head to a masked Death Eater.
Rosier is with him. Right behind him, Harry can feel the man getting to his feet, but he doesn't move, Harry bows his head and clenches his eyes shut. He needs to wait for the right moment.
If Draco knew Harry would accept it, he’d have long since offered to carry the other boy now as well.
He scrambles for his wand, trying to take it out, he doesn't have time to lose. Harry barely notices that he's not wearing his glasses anymore. He leaves cursing his shitty eyesight to some other time and gets on all four, with one hand, he desperately pats the ground, clawing at the rough asphalt as he searches for them, his glasses, while he fumbles for his wand with the other. His fingers refuse to cooperate, to close around the wand, to do anything. His mind is still trying to catch up with everything that's happening. Something crunches under his knees, and he grimaces.
The pleading makes Draco falter. Harry sounds odd. Tensed. Snappish. He sounds in pain. If he ignored him now… He couldn’t bear it. They’re both miserable, maybe a rest won’t hurt. He can’t say no to Harry. Not when he barely asks for
Somewhere in his head, a small voice orders him to talk, or react in a way that doesn't include gaping at his godfather and just sitting in this awful awkward silence that has gripped the kitchen, but he cannot. This is too much.
She will probably have him sit in her detention right now. He will get a firsthand experience in what Potter has been going through for over a month since the term started. His wand is a distinguished presence in his sleeve. He knows he can take on Umbridge, he has been trained by his parents and Severus. And he is not above using the dark arts to escape if she tries something.
"Yeah, you said so this morning," Harry closes the book and the inkpot, placing them both on the bedside table before rolling up the parchment and turning back to him.
"Horace?" Albus’ eyes have snapped towards the fireplace, and he’s attempting to stand up. Severus stifles the urge to roll his eyes and moves closer, ready in case the man takes a tumble.
Harry sure hopes that the dawn isn't too far away now. He's sick of the dark. He shudders, draws his legs up to his chest, and wraps his arms around them, resting his head upon his knees, just like he used to do when he was little in his cupboard.
"Well,” she stares at Harry for a second too long, then takes the register back. “Twenty quid for the room,"
Then the commotion starts again, and this time everyone comes barreling towards Harry with loud shouts and cries, except for Professor McGonagall, hanging in the back, but watching on with a concerned expression on her face as well.
They find a scone, and a cup with a lid that had cold coffee in it. Harry pours the foul, cold liquid on the sidewalk, then stores the cup with the scone.
?” Draco turns to Severus, “How many others know about this place, Severus? Is it even really safe?”
Harry wracks his brain for a question. He could have asked something about the Marauders Map, something about his father, or even mom, but Wormtail knew it all.
The relief feels so blissful after hours of torture but it has an expiration date, as does everything, and Harry really should pull that bandaid off before it becomes etched into the wound. Maybe he could end it today, this could be their last meeting. And then he will stop putting at least one person in danger.
Ron flushes a deep shade of vermilion and shoves the papers away. "Yeah, well. That. Things aren't going to improve with that toad in charge of the school,"
A permanent chill has seeped into his bones, and his own hands have started shaking. The blood on his shoulders, neck, and arm have cooled and have begun the process of drying into annoying itchy flecks, making him shiver harder.
"Nothing, I actually adore your name.” Harry smiles, looking up at him with his head tilted back. Draco wants to lean down and kiss his nose. “How about chicken pie?"
Because she has the potential, Draco knows this, and can easily see it on her. But what would she try, and more importantly, what would be her motive?
Harry's not glad, he wants to hit himself. Malfoy either doesn't notice the contempt on his face or doesn't acknowledge it in any way, rather he keeps himself busy with gathering up his supplies.
"I don't like too much of things," then he looks frustrated at himself. "I don't mean the sea, that's pretty cool, but… extravagance, in general, doesn't sit well with me. Too much of something is too less for other things,"
Severus’s voice is more urgent as he continues, “Potter, we need to get out of here. Stop being difficult. Can you stand?”
"I think that is Professor Dumbledore's business. His choices in life don't define my reactions. As you just said, I'm only a child, and there's no danger threatening me at this moment, even if it were, you're here to protect us, Professor, " he takes a deep breath and musters up the fakest smile he has ever had pasted on his face, it feels greasy and disgusting. "Don't you think so as well?"
"What did you expect though?" Ron says, buried nose deep into his own paper. "They've been doing this since the summer break, first with Harry and err-"
save our lives if we're targeted by death eaters. And no, Padma, we will not be answering any questions about Harry. So if that's why you're here, leave right now,"
"Oh," Harry says, quite suddenly and Draco pulls back. "It is north. Really north," Harry points at the top of the map, so high up that Draco can't read the words properly for a second. But there it is.
Mrs. Weasley's cooking is, as always, impeccable and Harry slightly regrets his lack of appetite. Sirius and Remus have decided to give him his space and are sitting together now, silently whispering amongst themselves as Ron and Hermione do the same on the other side of the table but keep throwing him a glance every once in a while as well.
“I… well as my godfather delicately put it once, I have a 'fixation' issue. I easily became obsessed with things and places instead of the people. Apparently, children my age found that extremely boring at the time."
He stands, then fidgets in place for a second before turning to Draco, also standing and staring at him. "When is our train due?"
"No,” Harry yanks his arm away, “No just piss off," he flexes his fingers, but a few of them don’t move. His face is twisted in pain. And if he’s showing that much expression, it means he’s in a
"No, I'm fine, thank you. I'm great." Severus keeps his snort to himself and lets the boy continue, "We need to head downstairs or the chickens burn, at this point I'm taking down a whole species."
He turns his back to Draco and Draco can faintly hear Harry fiddling with the bottles outside. He has to say something, anything to mask the noise.
Draco just hums in response. Harry will take care of him, he always has. It’s selfish, but Draco’s in too much pain to care.
And then it's as if someone thrusts the whole area, or perhaps Harry, into a refrigerator; goosebumps rise along his arms and his breath mists in front of him. Everything is plunged into sudden darkness, the faint light of the stars above him flickers out, and he stills.
Potter ducks, drawing his own wand to conjure a shield. Draco narrows his eyes. He can faintly hear the ghost of that girl moaning in horror behind him.
He's in the backyard, in the mirror, curled into himself and crying as quietly as he can in the storm because he knows that if Aunt Petunia hears him crying, making a fuss, attracting attention… she might never let him back in.
"There he goes," Harry leans in for a quick kiss just as the train shrieks to a stop. Draco relaxes, well, if it made Harry happy.
Draco can see the way Harry swallows nervously before asking, "Please tell me there is an antidote?"
"I can handle it," Harry snaps back, and he's not wrong. Even though the steam must be scorching and the pot a bit heavy to handle, Harry pulled it off with impressive deftness, especially with the state of his hands.
This feels wrong. Beyond wrong. Harry frowns in confusion, looks away from her to Draco, but the boy is not moving nor looking at him, he looks thoughtful and tense. Harry opens his mouth.
Chapter warnings for: violence, explicit language, depictions of self-harm,  prejudice (magical onto muggles), period-typical homophobia, stealing, ** Graphic depiction of a suicide attempt ** (look at endnotes if you will as if you should be explicitly warned about this)
"Valentina?" he says, his voice choked and terrified. He doesn’t have it in himself to mask any sort of emotion right now, and he’s sure his face is a perfect mask of textbook terror.
It hurts to manoeuvre with his hands so much, but Evan still claps sarcastically to her response. It's just so ludicrous, he couldn't pass up on the opportunity. "Oh! This is good," he exclaims, "He didn't send you to watch, he sent you to hunt," he flashes his teeth at the woman, "Classic move."
Well, he could have done that. “Smart girl,” he murmurs, opening the vial and swallowing it down. His body perks up instantly, and he inhales deeply the smell of beer and sweat. He slams the empty vial down on the coffee table, and turns to the kids.
He should have been repelled, but instead, he'd felt happiness, an eerie sneaking streak of joy that almost felt like indulgence in glee, and it felt wrong, so
Harry stares at her without a reply. He doesn't know where this is going. He knows he wouldn't like it. "I'm sorry Headmistress, but I don't understand…"
He pulls the collar over Draco's head and slowly peels it off his arm and his vision goes entirely white in pain.
"It's burning," he says, his eyes flicking down to his forearm for less than a second. "Which means you screwed up," he takes a step closer. "Which further means that your pink bitch screwed up. Which means we're all screwed up too."
Evan had one job. One particular order, that stood behind a bigger obstacle. He needed to get past a room that didn't even exist. The room of requirements. The only problem at the time had been that no matter how many times or how hard he had tried, he couldn't get the damn doors to appear. The doors didn't appear, and Evan's mission ended in failure.
He nods at himself, taps his robe pocket to check whether he has the chocolate bars there and then means to call a house elf for some snacks but Ron and Hermione lean forward in their chairs.
The staff room's other occupants are shocked into a bizarre silence, Pomona and Flitwick exchange an uneasy glance and Sinistra has paused her teacup midair, watching  Minerva with a perplexed frown.
His godfather was right. It's miraculous how good Potter is at cooking when he was absolutely bonkers at potions.
"You know…" Draco tells him, still smiling, the pattern of their feet on the ground feels oddly satisfying, "Muggles have decent architecture."
This bit of information fills Harry's chest with a warm glow, and he has a sudden image of imaginary Sirius scoffing at him. 'Really, you're choosing that guy?' he jabs his thumb at Sirius, eyes narrowed. Harry manages not to snort.
Harry chuckles, he's a bit breathless with the cold. Draco wants to make it go away. He really does.
“You will be safe here.” Severus says. He stands, vanishing the tattered remains of Draco’s shirt and casts a
Draco quickly rolls up Potter’s sleeves, wincing at the sight of blood and how his robe seems to be sticking to the cuts. Taking a damp cloth, which he had had the foresight to prepare, he quickly wipes away the blood. But even as he cleans away the blood, more seeps out of his cuts.
before making their way to a generally dry patch. The barn is drafty, but still marginally better than being out on a windy November night.
He doesn’t wait for her response, turns around and strides away instead, his stomach churning a little unpleasantly at the thought of the words that rang too close to home, even for him.
"It's fine," Harry waves him off. "I've noticed a pattern in the wards, they cannot get in here every day."
He doesn’t want to do this anymore, he doesn’t want Sirius, or Remus or a warped version of the people he knows hanging around. He wants to be real.
"Here is forty, please don't call anyone." They’re almost out of money now, and Harry’s face is worryingly blank beside him. His shoulders are stiff,  his hands behind his back.
"Yes, that all sounds very fascinating," though Harry doesn't sound excited in the slightest. "So there is an antidote," he confirms.
"Listen to me," he hastens his steps and drags Draco along with him, "I need you… to go inside that store, and ask the person behind the counter for 'Jar of pickled garlic', there is a huge chance that they won't have it, okay?"
of a friend back with me...did you all just expect me to go on my way with a pat on the head while you're doing… whatever the hell this is?"
He stares at Severus, and the potion master stares back at him, his chin idly propped on the back of his hands, the edge of his elbows are just brushing the tip of the table.
He has to call someone to treat Draco. They wouldn’t let him just die like this, not while Voldemort is still a day away. But, oh merlin, Harry really doesn’t want to push his luck by calling in a sadistic bastard who might just make things worse.
"No time, girl," Moody snaps. "Don't you know that those damn things hunt in herds? Kingsley is the bait. Let him do his job,"
Harry cannot help it, his eyebrows rise and his jaw slackens. They've never left him alone in the house before. What if they lock him in?
Draco isn't as amused as he thought he would be. He's intrigued, once again, by Harry's reactions. He hadn't looked bitter in the slightest these past few days, in spite of the worsening macabres that life kept throwing at him. He even seemed somewhat bright at times. This bitterness seems only reserved for Severus. It even sounds righteous.
"There won't be a repeat of this,” she says briskly, though her eyes flash for a moment, “But Potter isn't supposed to die yet. And Rosier was getting chatty. Do
They're meeting at the Astronomy Tower today. Draco had insisted that they don't stick to the same place for too long. Any other time Harry would have called Malfoy paranoid. He would have refused, would have tried to seek a way out of the 'blackmail', however much he found comfort in it; but now, knowing what he did, he understood.
Twinkly looks extremely unsure. “Twinky doesn’t know. She checks with Master now, if Master tells Twinky to help, she will,”
come from? When did Potter's safety surpass his own? Well, if he were to be murdered tonight, at least someone will be there to provide testimony. He had managed to wrap Potter's hand before Umbridge busted them, so Draco's sure Potter would make it to his dorm alive. Even though he has been looking progressively worse as the detentions went on. Worse than he'd been when Draco found him passed out on the bathroom floor.
Severus clutches at the glass tighter, remembering Draco's screams, which could have rivaled his mother's.
"No," he crosses his arms, it's really cold now, the tips of his fingers are numb, they're in an alleyway, narrow, narrower than the entrance to Knockturn Alley. Behind a bakery shop.
'Thanks, imaginary Sirius, ' Harry drawls in his head with a roll of his eye and then straightens his back, rolling his shoulders with a wince. When Hedwig gets back, he's writing to his Godfather for real. Chatting with the man in his head is starting to feel a little bit like cheating, and it's making Harry feel weird.
"Come on," he says, squashing the fluttering in his chest. The store is thankfully empty, and only the ice cream clerk is behind the counter. It happened quite by luck, seeing as Draco’s plan, was literally walking into the first interesting store he found as they walked. Ice cream is good, it’s safe, and hopefully cheap.
He doesn't need packing, what he needs is already on him, his wand and his glasses are always with him anyway, he doesn't need that many clothes either, at this point, Harry would really rather go stark naked than appear in these rags in public.
Harry just shakes his head, his knuckles are white as he grips at himself. Still shaking. Draco stares down at his mother’s wand and then glances back at Potter’s on the stool. Slowly, he reaches back to retrieve the unfamiliar wand.
Draco doesn’t answer, but rather points his own wand at her. He doesn’t stand a snowball’s chance in hell against her. Not after he lost so pathetically to Umbridge in his very last duel. She could kill him with one wave of her wand, she could be creative and she could be quick, or slow and painful and--
"Yes, sir?" He sounds almost too polite. The previous hostility hasn't disappeared yet, then. Not that Draco expected it to. He just thought Harry might get distracted from it sooner or later. He is good at it.
Harry doesn't argue. He knows that there's no point. She'll just give him more detention, and Harry gets a nasty headache just thinking about it. 'Let's just get this over with,' he thinks and waits for Umbridge to let him sit.
and the scabbed over cuts on his hand split open. It’s with the sheer force of will that he keeps himself from hissing.
"You were all here?" He asks, his voice is low, but seems thunderous, as not a single peep arises from anyone else. "All summer. You were all here,"
Straightening up, he grimaces, stretching out his arms and legs. While falling asleep on the floor hadn't exactly been pleasant, at least he hadn't been plagued by any more gruesome deaths. Be it his mother's screams, or Cedric's eyes, or Mrs. Malfoy's blood. Harry would take a sore body over nightmares any day.
"You couldn't say the same for us,” he continues, “We very much would've died without that money. And we are carrying our entire life in that one bag right now."
Don’t hesitate to tell us about your favorite scene, dialogue, or simply hop in if you wanted to say hi!
Harry looks at him as if he knows. "You wouldn't know," he says so, not in a mean disparaging way, but rather casually as a fact. "You're too rich for this conversation." He rolls his eyes in ill-concealed amusement. "I'm giving you extra boiled carrots."
He doesn't like that tone. He is awfully familiar with it. They're using the 'This prank is going to be our BEST yet' tone.
"You may enter," The Dark Lord calls out and Evan does not hesitate. He's exuberant, in a way. In the way, a child is proud of a meager accomplishment. Killing those muggles were in no way meager but in comparison to his Lord? Mentioning it was a crime.
'Someone really should,' Sirius says and Harry gets out, his head throbbing nearly with the same ferocity as his hand. He cannot go back like this… bleeding and miserable, looking more like the Bloody Baron than himself.
Getting up on his knees, Harry shuffles over to kneel in front of him, and if Draco were a better person, he’d have told Harry to lie back down. But he doesn’t. He lets himself be soothed by the way Harry wets the cloth and starts dabbing it against his face, wiping away the dried blood. It almost hurts worse than last night, when he’d been high on adrenaline.
Not at first, anyway. Harry sits in a clipped silence, holding his breath and waiting for a sharp cracking sound for almost a full minute before he slumps down.
Harry nods, resisting an eye-roll. Figures, only Aunt Petunia would be depraved enough to actually count the items in her fridge to make sure Harry doesn't take anything more than his share.
"Dean, mate…” Ron says, shaking his head, “If they could be here, they would be. But you don't need to worry about that, we learn from them, and then come teach you. We will meet three times a week, Hermione can tutor in other subjects too--"
Water dribbles down from the slanted roofs, shadows scram like rodents, from one corner to the other, the sky is the color of a storm and there's a definite chill in the air that cannot be entirely blamed on the weather, but rather the sheer atmosphere of the place.
Rosier comes to himself quicker than Harry was expecting. The man rolls them over and Harry is now the one pressed against the harsh stones. Thick, slimy blood drips form in Harry's face from Rosier's. He's given the bastard a bloody nose.
"Stop,"  Potter is blindly grappling for some sort of support to lean his weight upon, and Severus has no time to sneer at his foolishness. He was just getting the living daylight tortured out of him, and here he is trying to stand?
He knows what the cruciatus feels like. White, hot knives stabbing through every inch of his body, cutting up his nerve endings into confetti and spitting on them for good measure, 'There, you little asshole,' the curse says, 'Feel it
"You filth," she’d hissed down at him, cringing at the way blood dripped all over her steamed carpet. The one Harry had cleaned that very day.
"You and your friend's information,” she turns the register over to him, pointing an empty row, “Sign the row after you're done."
How else would a fugitive have floo access to the headmaster's office if he didn't know about it? Either that makes Albus an incompetent senile old man, or the arrest necessary. An attempted arrest, anyway; Severus snorts. He cannot blame them for trying, but he can at least enjoy their humiliating loss.
"People aren't that blind, surely they'd know this is an overwhelming understatement? Some of them are old enough to remember the first war."
Harry finally looks back at Sirius properly, whose expression is calmer now. Relatively. He can't tell whether it's because of him, or Harry himself. "Does it matter? I'm alive and safe, and he wants me."
"No, I don't know," Harry says shortly, lengthening his strides, even though he knows it won’t help escape Sirius.
Finally the wait will be over... In a week. Guess who's meeting who in the next chapter and there'll be a cookie in it for you guys ;)
“Mm hm,” Harry hums around his spoon, “I'll tell you all about it. Eat your ice cream though, it's starting to melt."
"Harry," Remus says, he has a smile on his face, but it looks strained. His face is even more rugged than the last time Harry had seen him, with bags under his eyes and a thin face. The full moon must have just passed. Or maybe it's near. Harry has never been able to tell.
And then he's gone. There's a large resounding crack that echoes through his bones and the man disappears into thin air. And Harry's left dumbfounded on the ground, still holding his broken glasses in his sweaty palm. It takes him ten seconds to peel his body off the newly mown grass and shakily head inside the house.
He is getting seriously tired of the constant dizziness that's been plaguing him, not just after his detentions, but rather, all the time recently. He has gotten better at managing his stumbling, though, and is able to portray a bare minimum of stability as he makes his way out of the office and towards the stairs.
"And you better not. Fool around, that is." She grabs her rag once again, turning away from him. "Vernon doesn't have the patience to deal with your insolence. You don't want the repeat of last summer, do you?"
The golden quill, the one from a magical golden quail, despite its size and its featherweight quality in his robe pocket, is a constant reminder of what he has to do today. The Dark Lord returns tonight after the sun has set.
His stomach lurches, and he grabs Harry’s hand, ignoring the flinch it causes. Which is ironic because- because his grasp couldn’t have hurt even remotely as much as--
Kingsley hides a frown. They don't have time for small talk. "Overwhelmed by paperwork, Minister," he hopes that the man gets a hint quickly enough, Kingsley really doesn't have the time, nor the patience for a social visit.
His eyes scrutinize Harry through the pained haze, praying and beseeching every fucking deity that the boy is whole. That he didn’t fuck both of them up. That there’s still something salvageable out of this mess.
They stay there, kneeling in the hay for what feels like an eternity before Harry very slowly peels his arm off from around Draco’s shoulder. Draco throws his head back, squeezing his eyes shut in pain.
Not that he could’ve said no to Remus. He’s never been able to do that. Remus always knew the right spots to hit, what to say, how to make the perfect expressions. Even James couldn’t have done it.
Despite that Instance (chapter 10, the trio’s argument, and chapter 11, Ron’s inner monologue), they do treat him as normal. Because they know that is what Harry wants the most from them. For them to make him feel as normal as possible, given everything. That's why Harry loves them, that's why they're so close.

"The Quill must have been laced with something, Draco, scoot over so he can sit." Draco, gaping slightly, shifts on the couch, swinging his legs off and scooting over to one side.
"Why wouldn't she? She had a double-edged blade, one for the ministry, and one for whomever she works with. Silencing Potter was the main objective in both groups. We have been too lax with your protection." Severus shakes his head once as he takes out a vial for the blood, mouth twisting in a sneer while speaking about Umbridge.
Harry imagines, in Moody's place, just for a moment, Barty Crouch Jr. instead, licking his lips and trembling with excitement. He shakes his head to expel the image out of his head.
Harry picks up an apple from the counter and holds it flat in his hand, "Don't be ridiculous," He cheerily replies over his shoulder, a seagull is viciously pecking apple pieces from his palm, it might be Lester. There's a whole flock of the bloody things, Draco grimaces.
"Don't go snooping in places that don't concern you, boy, knowing too much means the more are the chances of you losing your head. Green tongues and crimson necks, that's another saying right there."
“He’s bleeding, I cannot--” Severus can’t deal with a hysterical teenager right now, he needs to act
"for once in your life listen to your elders. Never utter a name when you don't know of the power it holds. Never."
"Great! We have boiled carrots and green beans," Harry's voice is awfully cheerful and menacing at once. Draco glances at him with mild surprise. They were supposed to have roasted chicken and pasta on the side. Apparently, the plans have changed. Harry catches his eyes and clears his throat. "And chicken."
Slowly, and without looking at the hateful sight of his hands, Harry reaches for the rag and dips it in the bowl.
'Stop deflecting. You need to stop this. He's lying to you,' Sirius is near snarling, and that frightens Harry almost as much as his not-dreams. There’s been so little kindness lately, only Draco. And now Sirius wants to ruin that. His own mind wants to ruin it. Why can’t he just enjoy the little things? Like being held by Draco?
Draco was ten at the time, holding his chin high and nodding along, pretending that he knew how the world was run.
"Fuck the money,” Harry says, tensing up, he's looking ahead, his shoulders hunched, “Just… please."
Draco admonishes himself for startling again as Harry hovers beside the couch, trembling fingers wrapped around a vial and the hand outstretched, partially covered under the sleeve.
She returns once another full minute passes, balancing a small basin in her hands with a long rag thrown over the bowl, she approaches the boys and puts the basin down with meticulous care.
"Oh yes," she gives him another small peck, this time on the nose. Everything feels slightly unreal right now, all other noises muted. Her body is numb and hypersensitive at the same time. Ron’s hands are warm in hers and she can feel his breath on her face.
"Don't come back until the bleeding stops!" She’d screamed at him, shoving him off the porch, and glaring at him with narrowed, hawk-like eyes while Harry shook under the lashing rain. Holding himself together by the middle, too scared to touch his head. Too cold under the rain.
"And people do the most ridiculous things when they're afraid." Albus sets his cup down heavily, "Public denial is what's fanning Cornelius's flames. He would say anything to gain public approval. Not to mention, the Ministry is in no place to take part in a war. Not financially nor magically abled. Fudge is aware of that."
"They're my favourite,” Harry juts out his chin, “and yes I have favourites. And yes, because silver and white is sort of your colour scheme. So it matches."
"If they're found, and tortured for information…” Severus’ mouth tightens, “Well asking them to silence themselves is too much of a sacrifice. You do have experience with that personally, Mr. Potter. Holding onto sensitive information under torture is impossible."
He can go to Myrtle’s bathroom again, there’s very little chance that Malfoy would be there today. And he never got to say hi to her. He frowns, he hadn’t seen her there yesterday. And he needs to do something about the bleeding too.
"Still, such nasty claims." They look at the cursed article lying in the middle of their essays. Harry's face is plastered under the headlines. "I've known the boy since he was eleven,"
"They're not insufferable,” Harry cuts him off, not quite sharp but close. “They're brilliant, and caring, and to be honest, I'm kinda surprised they still want to be my friend after all these years. Why would you ever think that though? Friends help each other, like you and I."
She breathes. "There's going to be a siege. They are going to take over the ministry; that's why the dark lord is not present. They will send for your heads."
"Well, isn't this interesting," the third voice drawls, female, cold and most decidedly surprising Rosier as much as Harry.
Ron growls, "This isn't a news conference. Harry is off-limits, either keep your silence or get out. We will start by reviewing some of last year's defence spells, and shields
His arms are like the cupboard. In the sense that they are safe, warm, warmer than Harry is, they are firm, they are sure. They protect him.
If you feel endangered, PLEASE feel free to come talk to us, we will always be available for you lovely people, or if not, please do not hesitate to reach out for help.
But he already knows, doesn't he? They'd probably had more reason than him to be awake, and judging by Moody's leg and their looks, they'd probably gone out on some kind of 'mission' and returned recently. He almost wants to ask if anyone was seriously hurt, but then changes his mind. They wouldn't be talking like that if someone were, and they wouldn't bother telling him if that were the case either.
"I promised them safety,” Albus crumples the note in his hand, holding up the locket by its chain. Staring at it as if it’d had the answers. “The same as I did to you, and they--"
Harry’s eyes are fixated on the wand, hypnotized and mortified by what he’s seeing. Draco calls him, but he doesn’t respond, he’s looking at the wand in Draco’s hand and his breathing is tilted, blinking hard.
The woman is middle-aged, by the looks of it, and her hair, a wispy, mousy brown that is braided and draped over one shoulder, has streaks of grey. She's wearing a worn, baggy jumper, which Draco isn't surprised by, seeing as it fully fits the shabby atmosphere this whole place has going on.
Much needs to be done, in such a short amount of time, and not a single thing could be overlooked in the process but one... They still couldn’t do anything about that pink toad.
There is a birthmark below the left side of his collarbone. Draco has always hated it. It’s a halfmoon shape, the colour of rust. He stares at it for a while as Harry works.
Fuck. Yes, he needs to get rid of the sweater, and possibly his shirt too. He can’t just magic them away anymore. The prospect of moving his shoulder makes him blanch.
"Sirius," Harry says, the man's grip on his arms is hard enough to bruise, and Harry squirms, tearing himself away from Sirius and staring around the room, while nearly everyone else stares back at him. He feels like he’s on stage and has forgotten all his lines.
Harry resumes feeding those beasts and Draco watches him the entire time because he has nothing better to do and watching Harry is an entire activity by itself.
His hands twitch at his side, and his eyes narrow. If Umbridge could, he is sure she would be skipping right now. She sounds way too cheerful than anyone has the right to be in such a situation.
Remus ignores him and continues speaking, "You know how to teach people hard stuff in a short amount of time. You taught James and…” He clears his throat, “Him, how to turn into an Animagus in six months."
Draco could probably call him his friend, if only out of technicality, he was too intolerant of the others and too...well, blàse with Draco. And Harry could be counted, he supposed. But he’s already with Harry, there's no reason to miss him yet.
The door has wind chimes. It startles Draco slightly as he pushes it open, greeted by a constant buzzing sound and sweet-smelling treats, he's holding Harry's hand in his.
"That's about enough for now, Mr. Potter," she says, in a sweet saccharine voice that makes Harry ponder once again, the disadvantages of committing first-degree murder… well, for one, he won't be able to complete his studies in Azkaban… on the other hand, it means he won't have to see or hear this creature anymore, so really… are there any negative repercussions at all?
The feel of his neck against the back of Draco's head, his warm breath and his voice, although Draco has no recollection of what the words actually were.
The woman clears her throat again, her beady eyes staring into Harry's eyes with a disturbing light shining in them. She wants something. Harry knows that look well.
At some point, Draco’s closed his eyes too. If this is all a pain-induced hallucination, he still wants to make the most of it.
Draco’s eyes are squeezed shut and he is panting for breath by the end of it. God, it hurts so much. Almost as if someone is still weilding a knife, ripping through skin as he lay there, helpless.
They pass it without a second glance, but Harry could care less. They could live by the sea, or maybe they could keep travelling like this, from place to place. Not afraid for their lives, just exploring places that could never exist in Harry's simple-minded head.
His aunt finally relents and he can hear her heels clipping down the stairs. Harry twists the knob and pulls, feeling an irrational rush of relief as the door opens. Of course, she has unlocked it for him. How else is he going to make breakfast for them?
This is not to say that we're disregarding your views, which we think are perfectly valid; if a relationship/friendship starts feeling like a burden, like 'work', it's better to sever them rather than wait until one or both parties get hurt.
Sirius nods, decisively, as if Harry had just confirmed something for him. 'I love you. I'm going to go now, okay?'
"They're Auror Partners," Ron says, "Apparently, really good together on the field too. Kingsley used to work with Sirius, like...way back during the first war."
With another order member gone from the school… Severus shakes his head, cutting the thought midway as it was forming. He has to focus now.
"We can get out of the town, stop in the next for the night," Harry says, finally gripping his hand as they make their way outside the store.
The hissing and the cursing are back again, and Harry feels thick rivulets, warm and sluggish making their way down his forehead.
He fishes a vial of nerve soothers from the bag and Harry drinks that too without a complaint. He's gone before he even finishes drinking.
"I've heard a lot about you since I came here Mr. Potter," she starts and Harry instantly knows that he's not going to like this. "From what I've heard you seemed very close to Albus Dumbledore."
“I know how to apparate,” Draco says firmly, he does. He can do this. He can… he can apparate an unknown distance with another injured passenger. He can. They don’t have time. They have to. The ministry can already be on its way here. He just used magic. Twice. This place is a beacon now.
He'd just wanted a small break from seeing Cedric's face every night, cold and motionless, his face shocked in death, wide grey eyes and an agape mouth. Harry is sick of it. And now another face is imprinted in his mind. He wishes he could obliviate himself. The whole resurrection. The whole Triwizard tournament. A lot of other things too, if he gets any say in it.
As Harry turns to raise his eyebrows at Bill, the older boy winks at him. "It's true," he says and points at his dragon fang earring. "She's not exactly a fan of my fashion sense."
Albus goes very still as his hands touch the locket, and then he bolts upright so quickly that Severus takes a step back.
Draco's forehead seems fractionally cooler once Harry has washed the wound and dabbed his chest. With minimal difficulty, he also forces the vial of fever reducing potion down Draco's throat. However little it might help, it's still help, and Harry isn't about to be ungrateful.
This time, even as he feels sickened to the core, he bares his teeth in a smile he knows isn’t pretty, “Same as you.”
“Rosier was just randomly strolling around in the school. Dumbledore is as good as gone, do you have any idea what those mean, Harry?”
Potter takes in a sharp breath and stumbles backwards, eyes going wide. The back of his legs hit the chair behind him and it topples over with a loud crash. Severus pauses midspell and lowers his wand.
"Have you ever been to the sea before?" He cannot help but ask today, and Harry startles, wincing as he holds his arm tighter, and Draco's eyes narrow. He seems to be doing that a lot lately. It's his injured arm, Draco knows, the one with the knife cuts and Umbridge’s handy work, there's something colossally wrong with Potter's arm.
"I don't want my vermin to perish under typical curses. No…" Rosier grabs Harry's hair, yanking his head up, "You deserve this. I'm going to watch you torture yourself to death, and it will be beautiful."
Severus purses his lips, but doesn’t try to contradict Harry. Harry continues, “And it took you five days to return.”
"Harry!" Everything seems to screech to a halting stop as he hears the shrill voice of one of his best friends, right before Hermione’s body collides with him. He lets out a muffled grunt at the force of her hug as she squeezes him, and her hair tickles his nose.
"You disobeyed me," comes the gentle hiss and the subtle press of the man's firm toes on his neck, just in the hollow of his Adam's apple. The agony is beyond measurable. Evan craves death the way a thirsty man wills to do the most heinous of acts for a drop of water.
"Please, Mr. Wallwind," he waves a hand and John settles in the gigantic armchair, feeling as if he's sitting in a dollhouse, playing pretend with Fudge.
“Ohh, Harry, I just love it when you scream,” Bella says as she finally lowers her wand, only for a bit. “Like that halfblood snack Ruddie and I shared two weeks ago. She screamed so loudly, and she did it with style, do you know what I mean?”
“There’s always a way out of anything. I know that from experience. If our gig is up, then my fate would be just as gruesome as yours, if not worse. At least you’ll get to die. I’m the one who has to live with the guilt of killing you and dooming the wizarding world.”
He stops abruptly, at a distance from the dementors. Harry can no longer see them. But the cold is still there.
Not sending an owl, or at least a message plane only meant one thing, the meeting was not going to be documented, it's off records, and Shacklebolt had a slight feeling that he wasn’t going to enjoy this secret meeting. Fudge barely ever had anything worthwhile to say anyway.
"You have been very disobedient, Mr. Malfoy, haven't you?" She says, almost crooning and Draco straightens, his eyes shifting back to a dull grey.
Harry’s trembling has gotten impossibly worse and Draco’s worried he might start seizing. He doesn’t know what he’ll do if he does. Just… they have to make it a few more feet. Just a few more.
"Over," Harry says, and then applies dittany again. It's blessedly cool, and it doesn't sting like before, not anymore.
The figure steps over Harry and kicks Rosier to the ground. Harry feels his eyes losing focus. Everything hurts so much.
Harry sighs, "Yeah. But we're mailing this poor man's ID card back to him." he fiddles with the card in his hand.
"Her room is right across ours, and she's bunking with Ginny," Ron says as she closes the door behind her. "So don't be alarmed if she barges in tomorrow at the crack of dawn to study here. It's her new thing."
The man pauses for a moment, looking around his own store, then gets up from his stool and Draco wants to rear back but the muggle just hums, "Pickled garlic… must be here somewhere."
"What do you have to say for yourself, Draco?" she asks, and this time her wand is trained directly on his face. She's too close for his comfort. Somehow Draco thinks she'd be too close for comfort even if she was in the opposite wing of the castle.
"Look again," The comment is accompanied by a small smile and Harry turns back to the houses, his brows knitting as he sees the breaks between building 11 and 13 starting to rearrange themselves as if trying to dig their way out of the infused line that separates the two buildings. Harry watches with an awed smile, discontented on the behalf of the muggles occupying the other houses.
He prepares himself for the impact in less than a second, clumsily in a moment. His hand goes lax, unable to grapple for his wand anymore.
Harry doesn't quite agree with that. It's not that Snape saved them from freezing to death in a blizzard. It's just that Draco
Everything is too much. His feet hurt, his knees on the red plastic hurt, and now he keeps imagining Harry bloodied under that monstrous block of metal.
"How?" He paces, clenches his hands, he can feel them shaking, his both arms are seized by it, his breathing keeps stagnating. He might just pass out.
The injury looks like a wound from a splinching accident that caught an infection. It was designed to repel magical healing methods, that's the genius infused element. Severus has seen this curse used only once before, on a muggle middle aged man, years ago. He didn't survive the encounter.
claims that you were also present, the day of the alleged 'attack'. I looked up your hours, and it seems that you were on leave that day,"
“Telly is short for Television.” Harry is patient as he explains, something that wouldn’t really have been possible before… all this. “It’s a radio of some sort but has moving images on it, and I was painting the windows because Uncle Vernon said I had to, as a chore.”
My Safest Sound is a very vast and multilayered story. Tara and I have put in a lot of time and effort into it, and sometimes not all of the things make it to the main storyline, but we still want to share them with you. For that, we have decided to add another story to the series called
No. Oh no. Harry blinks hard, and blinks again. There's a good chance that this isn't real. Harry wishes it to be a dream, one of those
He almost wants to turn back around and go to the dorms, end this stupid arrangement. He is knowingly endangering Malfoy's life. The pain in his hand spikes and he staggers again.
He stamps down on the fury he feels whenever Harry mentions one of his awful Muggle relatives and makes himself ask, "Did you give it a name?"
“You just said that we have forty eight hours left, are you going to spend that time wallowing?” He doesn’t know when the roles reversed, from him wallowing to Harry, but they have.
Harry flushes the toilet and stands with a groan, trying to shake off the pins and needles that stab his legs as he stumbles to the sink to wash his face.
"I will floo them straight to the headquarters," he says because Albus is just staring back at him, in no haste to avoid his gaze.
"Of course there is,” Severus scoffs, he looks a bit offended, “Always remember, Potter, the best poisons are those with antidotes, the worst are the ones without."
Severus reaches Draco just in time to see the large clock in the wall explode in a shower of sparks and splinters. He doesn’t dare look back at Lucius, still occupied by Rosier and Avery as he shoves Draco and Potter into the fireplace. He hears Rosier’s bellow just as he throws in a handful of floo powder and intones, in as clear a voice as he can, “Salamander’s Enclave!”
He swallows thickly, he can’t waste any time. Even standing here, every second, he’s wasting time while Harry could be suffering.
When Albus makes no move to open the small note in the locket, Severus picks it up himself, opening it up, and instantly recognising Regulus’ writing.
He almost does it too, the spell words right on the tip of his tongue, but his wand lowers at the last second. He's breathing heavily.
"You've already consumed a large sum of my time Mr. Potter," Umbridge claps her hands once in resolution. "Detention tomorrow at two? I hope you wouldn't be late,"
Moody, unsurprisingly, is the first one to speak, "Well, would you look at that?" he looks as if he wants to smack both Bill and Tonks upside the head. "The kid overheard you two yapping."
"Thank you," he says as he counts the funny pieces of paper Draco knows as Pound and hands them over.
"A fucking dementor nearly sucked my soul dry today!" He slams his hand on the wooden table and it burns, but he doesn't care. "A man kidnapped me and then shoved me back to my house, defenseless and alone, I was so alone and you were all here?!"
The first rule of survival in Harry's books is 'adapting', but in this instance, he's not quite sure whether that's what's at stake or his general resignation regarding his fate. Because he is resigned to it.
He brews tea and Harry proudly grins. He sets the potatoes on fire but Harry still laughs and gently teaches him the right way. He's had eggs thrown at the ceiling and still feels no shame or remorse because Harry bloody Potter is the most easy-going teacher in the whole bloody world.
"We're both an accomplice! I'm a murderer!" He is near hysterical by now, barely coherent, heaving in choking breaths. He looks about ready to hurl his guts on the floor.
Harry sort of hums and lets Draco drag him inside the store, it's empty and so much warmer than the harsh, biting cold outside that Draco wants to melt right on the floor.
"Give me your glasses," he quickly says and Harry obliges, feeling the urgency crackle between them. They're still in danger, they must be or else Remus wouldn't behave in this way. The man is the calmest person Harry knows to this day, it's very unsettling to see him like this.
She hadn't been there in the graveyard when Voldemort had been resurrected, Harry can at least remember that with some sense of decorum and no self-doubt. She wasn't there, he would have known, she wouldn't have let him leave alive if she were there. Not with the way she dealt with Mrs. Malfoy just now, which thankfully meant she was still in Azkaban. Although Harry wouldn't know, he hadn't read the papers in a long time.
Harry's eyes are stitched to his shoulder. "I'm so sorry," he says, "This is all my fault, if I hadn't run out--"
"Kingsley Shacklebolt. Minister Fudge summoned me," the secretary looks up at him, her eyes raking him head to toe before she puts her fancy green quill down and straightens her skirt.
Harry stares at Sirius for several long moments and knows if he were anyone other than a figment of his own imagination, he’d have looked away by now. "You're right,” he says, his voice flat. “I'm not okay, Sirius.” He takes a deep breath, “He was right, I'm not crazy, I'm just lonely. That's why you're here, that's why Miss Simons was here, and Remus… I was so lonely for so long," he traces small circles on the back of Draco’s hand.
“I’m of the same blood,” she mutters, almost as if she wants to convince herself in addition to Draco.
Salamander’s enclave is a bit of a running joke in the Order. One that Severus himself never quite found funny. The cottage itself is absolutely useless, not even used as a hiding route, rather a small shabby cabin, etched underneath a big rock that eerily resembled a crouched salamander from afar, and that was if one were looking for it, hence its name.
Draco's arms feel like his cupboard. Now Harry understands how colossal the scale of a misunderstanding driven from that statement could be. But he doesn't mean it in a bad way, rather the opposite, really.
"Everything here? Nothing splinched?" The man asks in a tone that implies that the answer can be nothing other than yes.
But Twinky belongs to the Malfoys, not the Death Eaters. So, maybe, Draco shouldn’t be too surprised. And her words are catching up with him too. 'Not let anyone know.' His father is disobeying orders.
"I know," Harry nods in mock sympathy. "We're all a bunch of uncultured peasants. You'll have to pardon us, Prince Draco of the Malfoy dynasty."
Remus sighs, "They need someone to teach them offensive spells and war tactics so they can teach it to the others."
He pushes Harry to the ground with a curse, and Harry furiously starts crawling, but Rosier is faster. Of course, he fucking is. He kicks Harry in the stomach, twice and still holding his bleeding hand.
A loud crack rings across the air and a man in dark billowing robes appears, his feet stumbling a little on the wet sand beneath him. There is a scowl on his face as he rights himself, standing up straight. He's not one to usually
Draco for his part seems to be enjoying his food, and doesn't seem to mind the awkward tension around the kitchen at all.
Severus takes in a deep breath, praying for patience, and retrieves the locket. It's light in his hands, and there’s no magical residue coming off of it, except for the faint traces of the poison it had been immersed in for so long.
From the corner of his eye, Draco can still see Harry wielding the peeler as he glares at Severus, the man turns to glance at Potter as he feels the boy's unsettling gaze on him, and silently waits for Potter to unfold.
Elen and I are happy that you have such good friends in your life that care deeply about you and support you through tough times. Ron and Hermione-though only being fictional characters-are trying their hardest to provide a similar support system for Harry.
bother? Especially after their earlier conversation. The vials in his robes sit heavily as he ponders about his predicament. Is he really waiting in an abandoned girl’s bathroom with stolen potions waiting to heal The-Boy-Who-Lived after blackmailing the boy into helping him?
He stays there, on the floor, with his cheek leaned onto the gravelly ground and the tips of his fingers brushing against Draco's wrist, as if just checking the other boy's pulse. In reality, Harry is analysing his temperature, but is too tired to get up and put the back of his hand on the boy's forehead every time. It's too much effort, and Harry is ashamed to admit that even harboring the idea of getting up from this position is actually tearing him up.
Draco snorts, shoulders loosening at Harry’s apparent ease, and Severus half-heartedly glares at him. His face takes on a long suffering expression that often accompanies the man when Longbottom is near.
He is back in the graveyard. He knows that place better than the back of his hand now, cold and desolate as always. As if the life is sucked out of it, the soil is hard under his toes and the grass a dead, lifeless grey. As he looks up, there are flashes of light. And everything is so horrifying in its familiarity that it takes him a while to notice what's wrong with the image.
As Severus strides towards his personal quarters, he has a scowl firmly in place to divert anyone, student or teacher alike, from approaching him.
Draco wrinkles his nose at the pet name, "First of all, no. Second of all, they use slang for money?"
Harry scoffs, "When I was younger, I used to have an imaginary puppy. You're telling me that's not freakish?” he bites his lips, and doesn’t wait for an answer,  “Don't laugh, okay? It's just that, they bought Dudley a retriever, he had it for like three days before he got tired of it, but he was so kind. We cuddled plenty when I was doing yard work, and when he left… I sort of still had him around."
Severus feels his eyebrows rise on impulse. "Draco?" he repeats, a bit startled at the casual way Potter throws his godson's name around. Just two months ago they were at each other's throats, and now they were on first name basis? Well, Potter is, by the looks of things.
The Ministry, and thosevulturistic reporters, are in an uproar, and Hogwarts is being more closely monitored than ever. Black's appearance has thrown everyone into disarray, the people had already been disgruntled by Potter and Albus' claims about the Dark Lord's return, and now another bombshell had been dropped on them.
He wonders what Regulus and Morris would think of them now. Reggie had been so young, younger than even Severus himself had been when he’d joined. He’d only been eighteen when he died. Morris had lived another eight years before succumbing. Living as a recluse, sickly young man. Living in shame.
Harry tries to pull him to his feet but he’s not faring any better than Draco. His leg is bleeding, so is his arm. He’s shaking wildly. There’s frustrated tears welling up in his eyes.
"You hold onto the inkwell, and my arm too alright?" Remus says, shoving the ink well in his hand. He seems to be growing more and more agitated by the second. Harry struggles to handle Hedwig's cage with one arm and holds Remus with the other, confused and somber as Moody and Tonks round the house up.
"I cannot go back to the common room with this," Harry holds up the bandaged hand. "Ron and Hermione—"
"He means only people with high pain tolerance can keep their mouths shut," Draco interjects. In a way, he’s almost glad Moody was the only outside party who knew about their location. Almost.
"No, you're not." Remus agrees. "But you've been through a rough ordeal today, nobody is expecting you to be fine with any of this. The chocolate helps."
"I'm just saying that we're good company if he cannot sleep." Bill points out, shrugging in a way that jostles his ponytail. "That's why he was sneaking around in the first place, right?"
Moody reaches into the pocket of his leather coat, and pulls out an empty inkwell, holding it out to Remus and the man snatches it away at once, his other hand ushering Harry to stand in the middle of the living room with Hedwig still tightly held against his chest.
Kicking away a can of soda along his way, he enters the park. There are still a couple of stragglers around, but they look like they're leaving. It isn't a big park anyway. He likes it.
on the robe, repairing the damage too. Narcissa had bought him the school robes, if Severus isn't mistaken. Draco would want it intact. The fabric fuses back together, almost effortlessly, which is to be expected, since the curse only ever affects the flesh with any vigour. Which is a lot.
It’s like a moving carousel. Harry has never been on those. He’s seen a few as a child. The ones with the moving, dancing horses, that went round and round in a circle, the kind that only Dudley was allowed to ride. Harry is on top of one of those horses now, going up and down, up and down as he hangs onto the railing for dear life.
He’s less gentle pulling Harry up this time, urgency dictating his movements. He keeps a firm grasp around Harry’s waist with his left arm, and Harry's arm is gingerly draped across his shoulders, afraid to hurt him.
But he doesn't know if he's alone. If Petunia hears, if she does, then she might not let him back inside, and Harry will be left, in the hall of mirrors, with nothing but himself.
He knows how to apparate. He does. But he… hasn’t used it much. It’s too advanced magic, usually taught to seventh-year students. He’d actually just perfected it this summer. Before everything had gone to shit.
He knows when she's watching him. It's a curious little thing, the weight of her gaze on the back of his neck, prickling small hairs and sending involuntary shivers down his spine.
"I can't believe we passed London," Draco mutters, his arms crossed, and his head leaned back over the seat, "It seemed like such a huge milestone. But we just passed it by."
Harry shakes his head violently, and squeezes harder at his arms, willing the sharp pins and needles sensation to go away, "You're not even real."
“I can assure you, Professor Dumbledore, me, and Moody are the only other people who know about this place. It’s the safest place for you right now.”
"There there, you filthy bitch," the grimy voice croons into his ear and Harry can practically smell the rancid breath brushing against his face.
"I need to examine your wounds Draco," he says. "I brought some balms that might help with the scarring, two disinfectants, and a skin grafter, you know how it works."
Dinner is awkward. So awkward, in fact, that Harry cannot even imagine the thought of chewing too loudly, and so slightly settles for lightly scraping his fork against his plate. The fork, which thankfully remains in his hand and doesn’t clatter down to the table or floor.
"No," Harry closes the tap with a firm shake of his head. "Heard nothing, saw nothing, the kitchen was empty when I came in," against his better judgment, he takes another long swig of his glass. "I was just leaving,"
Umbridge steps closer, her heels dully clicking as she gets closer. Harry cannot do anything but stare at Malfoy's face, his eyes just as wide and his bandaged hand clenched.
"Listen very carefully Potter, I'm only going over this once. We'll run to the stairs. We enter the study and head
"Yeah but don't mention it to him too much. It's a bit of a sore spot." A bit more than a bit,  "But yes, he knows spells and  techniques even I don't, he can teach you, then you'll teach your students."
If Harry's lucky enough, and they really do mean it, maybe he can try picking his cupboard's lock to get some of his homework done. He hasn't done a single essay from the start of the summer, mostly because his things weren't with him, but also because… well, because he really doesn't like thinking about Hogwarts more than he has to.
An unknown, unexplored patch of his mind that was entirely new to Harry, new in imagery and sensation. He looks around the dark woods in absolute silence, not trembling, but rather, steady and calm in the face of the unknown.
"Edward Rosier would have had your tongue pulled out of your ungrateful mouth for that," Evan says pleasantly, vaguely waving a hand at somewhere behind Harry. "He wasn't as tolerant as I am."
“It won’t really make a difference, the shirt was too big anyway.” The strips in his hands are uneven, and Harry grimaces. But Draco is impressed, he hadn’t thought he would be able to do much at all with his hands.
"You know that…" he trails off for a moment, looks around their empty dorm, "We didn't mean to trap you, or anything like that last night."
Harry frowns, shifting weakly in his place as he grasps Draco’s hand with his own, which is too hot. Too hot to be normal, and he is mumbling in his sleep too, brows pulled together, as if in pain. Or perhaps having a nightmare.
on Earth is Harry managing this. Draco frowns. He doesn't have a name for it. He refuses to call it catatonic paralysis. It's not. Somehow he knows this. But
'This is the second time it’s happened. There's something wrong, Harry,' Sirius says, and Harry resists the urge to turn towards him and let out the barrage of terror in a single scream.
As soon as he sees the wands, though, he freezes, gaping ever so slightly. One of them is definitely Harry’s wand, he’s seen it enough times. And the other.  Is clearly not his.
This could be the most peaceful equivalent of a death Draco Malfoy could get. He's running a high fever, so he's probably not even registering the pain, it would be just like falling asleep. Harry could just...leave it untreated. Let nature take its course. Or even aid it in the way.
well,” she says, flicking her head towards Harry’s prone form, the boy has stopped trying to get up now and is watching them with blank, glazed eyes. “You need to take him to Slughorn. Horace Slughorn in Tattershall, in Lincolnshire, he will know how to help, but you don't have much time. There's going to be--"
"I've been having weird dreams. Like, since that night. I feel weird, all the time.” Draco’s heart drops. Harry continues, oblivious to Draco’s creeping panic, “I know I'm forgetting stuff, I sleep, but I'm still tired… I think it's the being on the run thing.” Harry turns his head to face Draco again, and Draco can only hope his face doesn’t reflect whatever he’s thinking or feeling. “Do you think that's it too?"
"This place is the headquarters of the Order of Phoenix." Sirius starts. "It also happens to be my ancestral home, you've already had the displeasure of meeting my mother," Sirius pauses for Harry to exclaim or show any sort of outward emotion, but he passively stares back at his godfather and Sirius cringes.
Moody is staring at him, his fake eye madly rolling as he regards Harry with an unknown expression on his face. As if he can see not only through walls and doors but also through his eyes and into his mind. Harry doubts he'll see much beyond little Harry's screaming in confusion and terror in his head, flipping tables and running around, whilst alarms blared overhead.
Thanks a bunch to our beta. This is the longest chapter being uploaded yet, hope you all enjoy it! We certainly did, whilst writing it.
But what makes his stomach sink is the third figure. A female figure. For one second he thinks it's Bella.
"I cannot! It felt good. I was exhilarated by their pain, I liked it when Mrs. Malfoy screamed, I made Rosier cry like a baby, I choked him with my foot! There's something wrong with me, because I thought they weren't real, I thought they were twisted dreams, but they aren't. Every second of it is true. Bellatrix killed her sister and I killed Draco's dad. I killed his dad and I was just making us dinner as if nothing had happened!"
"Where she starts on a topic and just...Goes on. We've been sitting on this for a while, and she, well me too I guess, we were pretty worried, and kind of annoyed."
Draco’s lips twitch a bit at that. And then something else Harry said catches up to him. He almost stumbles.
We were absolutely amazed by the great response we got for the last chapter. Thanks lots and lots to our Beta Amar, and also, we sure had our fun with the characters and sets with this chapter. Hoping it gets the desired effect!
Potter, Severus thinks, slightly amused, now looks a little nervous as opposed to the not so subtle hostility from earlier. After little contemplation, Severus walks over to the bed and sits down, and conjures up a chair. Wooden and hard backed, gesturing for Potter to sit.
Could it make Harry try to harm himself even while he was awake? Could it make him attack Draco? What other effects did it have? Was it also affecting him physically, poisoning him, something insidious that Draco wouldn’t notice until it was too late?
"I'm not going to their funeral. Aunt Marge might be there… and just, no. I don't want to deal with them anymore." Harry’s hands trace the edges of the packet, not opening it yet.
"Merlin," he drops his wand and slowly detaches his back from the front door. Harry closes his eyes and tries to stifle a hysterical chuckle. "Hedwig."
The thing was, that Albus had called Minerva over for some sort of hunt, Remus wasn't really listening, and Minerva was awfully worried that two of her fifth year Gryffindors were going to abuse that absence.
Here he lies, in the same Dance Hall that also harbors the body of its owner, sprawled only a few feet from Evan, sluggish blood oozing from his mangled hair, matting it down and fading into the dark marble. Evan cannot stop looking in the traitor's eyes, so chilled and graceful even in death.
Perhaps if he’d never helped Potter, they’d-- Draco shakes his head. No. Even if some very small part of him had blamed Harry for putting them here, it had shriveled up and died as gruesome a death as his mother when Harry was being tortured.
He finally manages to get a hold of his wand, it slips into his palm and he's shouting, fumbling, the wand movements all wrong, "Reducto!" Somehow, as if sensing his desperation, the spell fires, right at her face.
Harry finally decides to open the chocolate frog wrap. "Only if you stop nagging at me about Cedric."
“Master has allowed Twinky to look over Master Draco,” she quietly says, so quietly in fact that Harry can barely hear her. “Master has allowed Twinky to come even though she is not allowed.”
"Yeah,” Harry says, the smile back on his face. Knowing and sweet and just… Harry. “And I love having you around."
By the time the vial is empty, Draco is gasping and his fingers are cramped from clutching too tightly at his now wrinkled shirt.
"It won't do much," he feels stupid telling this to a man who taught this to him in the first place. "Fenrir Greyback did that to me."
He doesn't speak, Draco doesn't prompt him to. He doesn't know what happened with Rosier, Harry seems too tired to even articulate properly. They need rest.
Harry huffs, "Well, it's there. I know it's weird, I don't usually go out of my way to make people aware of the freaky things I think about and--"
But he manages to keep most of his whimpers to himself. He still doesn’t feel like his pain means much compared to what Harry went through, must still be feeling.
"The owner must have been killed," Draco doesn't doubt it for a second. He was a squib, he did have Slytherin ties, but squibs aren't meant to survive for long.
It's a very self- indulgent, bitterness-driven game, and sometimes he feels slightly guilty as he lets his hands take over the chores, and cautiously starts playing the game in his head.
"And yet," his lord drawls, his voice almost soft, he caresses Nagini's head as the snake tangles herself around him, her tongue flickering at the coppery scent of blood. "And yet I let you live."
"No,” Draco says promptly, remembering the way Pansy had followed him around every day, reporting back to Bellatrix or the Dark Lord and who knows who else. “Mostly because most of them didn't matter enough to be missed."
"How?!" He screams, "It's all so easy for you to say when you don't have to deal with another fucking death you imaginary piece of crap--"
They find the bus station a while later. It is surprisingly modern compared to the rest of the picturesque town. It has a snack booth and everything.
In a way, Harry is very similar to his godfather, and whilst Severus's face is the exact depiction of stoicism, Harry's face is a myriad of emotions so tangled in each other that they cannot be discerned into different branches.
Draco snorts, "That's an insult. Also, what happened to your huge major crush on that Ravenclaw moron last year. What was her name… Chang?” he tries not to sneer, “I'm pretty sure second base with Chang is considered dating,"
' See if you can throw up on Umbridge's plate. It's better than whatever garbage she's eating, ' Harry chokes on the apple and imaginary Sirius cackles, smacking the table as he laughs.
Severus purses his lips, well. The poison must be fading. At least that’s what he hopes. He hasn’t touched any of his old potions journals in literal decades, so the details are somewhat blurry.  He waves his wand in a simple purifying spell. And Albus relaxes minutely. He’s still severely dehydrated. Severus urges him to drink more water but the man refuses until Severus has looked at the Horcrux.
There is a sharp, unhinged laugh echoing in the air as Bellatrix waves her wand above Cedric's body over and over again. Sick pleasure is plastered all over her face.
Harry washes them away, and dispassionately watches as blood lazily starts bubbling out of the inflamed wound. He really should have asked for a disinfectant, while he was at it.
He eats about two spoonfuls of the food on the desk as Ron changes into his pajamas and then changes into his own as well.
Draco doesn’t lower the wand, but Harry seems to be relatively alive and Rosier seems to be relatively dead, so he doesn’t cast. "What are you doing here?"
A man that Draco distinctively knows as one of the Rosier family steps out, Draco knows it in an instant because of the trademark honey colored hair and narrow cheekbones. Two features exclusively belonging to Rosier men. Draco remembers it well enough. He's seen the man around before.
When Draco stares dumbly at her, still processing the fact that there’s going to be a siege, the fact that she just killed Rosier to save Harry, that-- that there’s something seriously wrong with Harry; she clucks her teeth and shoves him towards Harry.
He should. He can’t even stand straight. His legs are cramping. He forgot to wear shoes or slippers. The gritty sand itches at the soles of his feet. His knees are almost knocking together with how badly he’s trembling.
"This is the first time he's asleep since god knows when. Shut up," he whispers. Sirius is always so loud, boisterous. The exact opposite of him really. And Harry sometimes doesn’t realise how he’s matching the same volume until others have already noticed. He’s getting better at it. He doesn’t want to wake Draco up, not because he was arguing with himself. At least Draco can’t hear Sirius.
"He squealed like a little pig, before I'd even started with him," she crouched by Rosier, grabs the man's clenched jaw, "He pissed himself by the time I was done. Disappointing, isn't it?"
He stands there, not moving. The expression on his face doesn't change. His lanky black hair is falling limply over his eyes; he doesn't bother brushing it away. He stares at the lazy tides with emotionless onyx eyes, washing up against the damp sand.
Despite the chores, despite the dizziness, he feels jittery. As if waiting for something to happen. He's been feeling like this for a few days now and has mostly learned to ignore the deep unsettling restlessness. Mostly.
He waits for the boy to elaborate and Harry pouts as he dumps the pot on the stove. "To the beach. Like, my relatives took their kid every summer. Dudley," He waves a hand, as if his dead cousin's name is of any value to Draco, "They made me go to a safe house in a deserted island once, I was honestly too tired to see much."
“Master Lucius sent Twinky to give you and Mr. Harry Potter some water.” she snaps her fingers and a large pitcher of water appears in her hands, which she quickly sets down in front of them, before backing away again, wringing her hands.
Draco says nothing more, and instead narrows his eyes. He cannot take on them both. He needs a distraction. Anything to release Potter from the curse so he could help. He has no idea how Rosier is with a wand, but he knows that Umbridge isn't much competition.
"The same reason no one else can. The security regarding this house is airtight. We cannot disclose the information to just about any random person."
Draco's knees tremble like noodles as he walks into the narrow store, knowing that he looks like shit, with the terrible scar, and his unkempt clothes.
"What is…” he doesn’t think he wants to know. He looks down at his hand and grimaces, “Okay fine.” Feeling like a moron he brings his hand up to his mouth and licks off the peanut butter. He tries hard not to think about what his parents would think of this.
Harry starts slowly, and the cloak comes off easy enough. But as soon as it's off, a slow trickle of blood starts down his spine and arm again.
"Kingsley Shacklebolt." he drawls, almost as if he's talking to himself. "He wasn't in The Order before. So, they're recruiting,"
Going under his Invisibility Cloak again, he makes his way to the bathroom, letting muscle memory carry him as he loses himself in his thoughts.
One less muggle was one more victory in Evan's book, Potter's relatives were the perfect victims really, and the rest? They have been pardoned in a way. They died too quickly.
Finally, a door reveals itself, and with a sharp snap, three steps extend downwards to the sidewalk, trapped by two frail rails. Remus pushes him to the door, his wand pointed to the door itself. Hedwig indignantly hoots at the werewolf.
When the screams in his head die down, he realises with a jolt that it's not his head and temples that are pulsing in pain, but his scar that's aching.

“I have the water,” it’s terribly sloshing on the sides as Potter’s unsteady hands lower the bowl next to Severus.
'As if you would even know you're counting right.” Imaginary Sirius crosses his arms over his chest, ‘How do you know? Is it one hundred eighty-four or fifty-nine?'
"Excuse my bluntness, Kingsley. But I think I've made my point abundantly clear… if I notice such an occurrence again, that is you or any of my other employees, going back and forth to Dumbledore for whatever reason… well, I have my responsibilities and you have yours." Fudge has put his hat back on and is wringing his fingers.
"The nerve soothers you've been taking," Severus says, starting to wrap Draco's shoulder in fresh bandages, this time without the Dittany, "Bring me a vial. I want to see which one you're using."
If he leaves now, he won’t be back. He knows he won’t. This place is warded by the Fidelius charm and he doesn’t even know which county they’re in. If he leaves now, he’d be stepping into a dark abyss of uncertainty. He doesn’t have the faintest idea of where Harry is now. He could be walking into a full-blown Death Eater meeting.
Draco immediately shakes his head, "I think you were just lonely. And I think that's lovely, not you being lonely, but...having such a strong mind."
Harry pushes himself off the mirror wall, and looks down, and it's the fucking mirrors again. He's walking on it. He's leaning on it. That's all there is.
Harry groans, and with strenuous effort, croaks out, “Screw,” he pants for breath, “You.” He is vaguely aware of Draco stiffening, eyes going wide with shock.
As a child, he was simply too naive to see, to really look, when he acquired the gift of seeing at the age of thirteen, he was too jealous, too spiteful of Potter to use it on him. Now he and Harry share something incredibly intimate. They share pain, and Draco allows his eyes to roam every inch of Harry's skin as if it cures it of all suffering.
He has, hasn't he? He hadn't thought of it as a date when the idea initially took root in his mind but Harry's right. This is their first proper date.
It takes Draco a moment through his haze of panic and confusion to realise he’s pointing his wand at Harry; and horrified, he almost drops the wand from his slack hands, and lowers it with lightning speed.
"It used to have the biggest beehive farm in Sussex. I was eight, and I think my parents wanted to shut me up."
“Hush,” Severus snaps at them again and firmly ushers Draco-and by extension Potter- down the dimly lit hall, decorated with ornate, antique vases, one of them Severus fondly remembers as Narcissa’s favorite, and a few scattered portraits, that are all empty now. Lucius has taken care of everything, it seems.
When Harry smiles up at her and she winks, when Harry's hand squeezes his wrist across the table, the waitress is the last thing on Draco's mind.
He gives the man a look. He's planning something, he's always planning something, but if Harry's off behavior is anything to go on, he's not going to like it. He has yet to see what an angry Harry can do beyond hurling insults in school corridors.
Draco has no idea what magic muggles use to make the cars run. The ones from the ministry are charmed, he's only seen one from afar. It only made sense if muggles use charmed cars too.
Potter lets out a sound that may have been a huff or a gasp, and plants his hands solidly against the floor, before starting to push himself up. When Severus puts a hand between his shoulders to help him up, the boy flinches away so violently he almost falls over again. Severus has not done this in a long time. Rescuing tortured victims. He should have anticipated this, instead of rebuking himself though, he just purses his lips and simply helps Potter sit up.
The rain pattering on the windowpane is a mocking lullaby, soothing but with him unable to take any joy in it.
"Harry, take a soother," this feels like talking to a wall. Useless and pointless. Harry’s hands are shaking badly and it's painful to look at.
"Hello, how may I help you, boys?" The muggle woman’s voice is deceptively pleasant as she sits in the dark reception.

There's shifting behind him, and the woman finally steps in his sight, masked, but still imposing. She crosses her arms.
Twinky's lips quiver, but she nods, shrinking back a little. “I will- I will take my leave now, sirs.”
Harry dumps his cloak and album in the pile and grabs Hedwig's cage, his footsteps thundering against the floor as he races down for his pet. "Hedwig!" He calls and the owl comes flying at him, hooting.
"You are hopeless. Beyond hopeless at this, Potter." Draco grumbles as he vanishes the sullied liquid and shrinks the bowl down.
use any magic, do not let him get out of your sight, and do not be caught.” Her hand tightens around his injured shoulder, and she leans forward, her face inches from his, her voice lowering, “I won't save you again. Do you understand? Take him, take him now and leave."
With Harry, it’s never even a matter of pride, the way he keeps quiet and suffers silently. Unlike Draco. He used to think it was pride, of course. Some stupid Gryffindorish thing of his. But he’s come to realise it’s just a matter of convenience.
“Farewell, Potter.” Severus turns away, unable to bear the sight of Potter’s trembling form any longer.
"Now, Kingsley, I won't take up much of your time. We just need to clear a few things up and you can be on your way,"
"That's… that's why Dumbledore called me in his office. They died." Draco still hasn’t resumed wrapping the gauze. Potter is still staring at him with those eyes.
"Oh, you have got to be kidding me!" Harry raises his hands from where they were playing with the hem of his pajamas, letting out a noise more exasperated than annoyed, and Ron is seriously not sure whether that is a good thing or not.
Harry coughs and groans through wave after wave of pain. The afterpains. He's certainly forgotten about those.
It still hurts, everything still hurts and he’s cold. And he can feel Harry’s hand shaking in his own. But for a moment, that all takes a back seat. Because Harry is kissing him. Because Harry likes him. Because he didn’t ruin the one good thing left in his life.
"Well, Argent is too much of a valuable resource, it's better for everyone involved if his identity was kept a secret, isn't it?" Bill replies.
"I bashed Rosier's face in, with my foot. And I splattered Mr. Malfoy’s brain all over the floor. And I stood and watched as they killed Mrs. Malfoy, and you were there too! And you did nothing and Draco has lost so much already, and I'm responsible for it and I'm pretending that it's nothing and you're doing the same thing and that's not fair-"
It takes Draco a second to make his lips move against Harry’s. Warm and salty from tears. He can barely smell Harry, the scent of spices and their cleaner, over the smell of blood. But it’s there.
Draco never feels the need to question Harry's motives because he's JUST coming to know him, So everything he perceives is just processing in his mind as "THIS is Harry"
Harry's flipping through their Transfiguration book once he gets there, his brows knitted into a distracted frown as he rapidly shifts the pages, his poised quill dripping ink into the blank parchment.
“No,” Harry’s voice is high and squeaky, not a good sign. He also sounds uncertain. Which Draco can use to his advantage. They can’t… afford to be picky right now. Not when they have no idea what’s going to happen next.
Harry takes in Tonks' and Bill's appearances, they both look slightly haggard and almost as tired as Harry feels. He wonders how he looks.
"I missed you," he says and then flops on his back, he is soon joined by Hermione plopping down next to him, her hair brushing against Harry's face, and then Ron too, a bit awkwardly, on his other side. They all watch the bed's canopy as Harry quickly gives them a short summary of his summer holidays and the dementor attack. He learns that his 'kidnapper' had been Kingsley Shacklebolt, an Order member and a ministry Auror.
He looks towards the vague direction of the cottage, but can’t really make it out in the dark. Too far out. Harry had run all this way. Away from him.
“No!” Potter screams, lunging towards Draco, who is now on his knees. Severus acts quickly, casting a
Another hour passes, and Harry’s hand is in red rivulets, and he's sure if it goes on, the blood would make a small stream in the classroom all the way to the gates. Last night wasn’t any different from the others, the O.W.L. classes are awfully drilling, especially when you have Hermione as your friend, and Harry is reaching the end of his ropes faster than he was expecting.
Draco wants to protest, but he shuts up and just shoves the damned thing down his throat without thinking about it.
This throbbing ache makes him even more nauseous. He needs to wash his face, anything to cool his scar down a bit. He kicks the covers off with a small grunt and scrambles to his feet, his hand still tightly clasped against his scar. It feels inflamed under his palm, and a bit wet, Harry suspects that to be sweat, and prays that it's not blood.
"I see no need," Albus says, gesturing for Minerva to take her seat. Her mug of tea is already ready and kept on the table.
She doesn't, not until the fucking silver spoon is put away and she raises her steaming cup to take a small sip, not breaking eye-contact with Harry even once, not until the cup is back on her desk and her cats are throwing a fit on the walls. Harry contemplates if Azkaban is really that bad compared to this.
"You're too salty," Harry deadpans and abruptly turns away from the two to attend to the bubbling pot of carrots. "You should probably lower that, it's bad for your heart,"
be, but Umbridge is sadistic and his head is pounding. He can cast without standing, no big deal. He would be pretty incompetent if he couldn't.
"I'm sure that Professor Dumbledore will know. He will be made aware immediately, and we will look for a solution. Right now, you need to calm yourself, Potter. You cannot go downstairs like this."
There are two wands over there. Two. He’d thought he’d left his wand in Umbridge’s office, and he didn’t have a clue about Harry’s. Are those spare wands? They won’t work very well, but at least they won’t be defenceless. He gets up and walks over to the table with a slight sense of dread; better give them a try.
“Potter,” Draco slumps back down. Maybe the tortures did affect Harry on a more psychological level.
Sirius sighs, and finally sits up. He looks at Remus, that's beseeching and resigned at once, and heaves another dramatic sigh, "Remus? Take a look at me, buddy,” He gestures vaguely at himself, lifting his shoulders, and raising his eyebrows, “Do I look qualified enough to teach children so they could teach other children?"
The first and most obvious one, is that Harry’s pain limit has reached a new, unexplored high that he’s not sure anyone has ever reached yet in the history of the human kind. It’s a raw, unfiltered kind of pain that Harry’s mind only perceives as pure static, blasting into his ears, and rupturing his eardrums at an alarming rate. He’s not sure whether there’s a level of pain above this one. He’s not sure whether he wants to know.
Evan hauls Harry to his feet, this time by his throat, and Harry butts his head back to his chest, repeatedly. Rosier doesn't give in, just squeezes down on his windpipe.
He does though. He does and he's a fucking liar to ever think otherwise. He wonders if smothering himself in the fluffy towel will help. He doesn’t want to think anymore. Of Harry’s face when he’d tried to kiss him.
"Who?” Sirius scoffs, “James? I bet your right hand that he would want me to do this. In fact, if he were here he would be the one choking me to death. And Harry…” Sirius’ mouth twists bitterly, “Harry deserves a parent figure who can actually be there."
He knows nothing. Severus thinks he does, but he doesn't. Harry means nothing to Draco, and that smile isn't worth what his godfather thinks. Severus sighs and follows Potter upstairs.
"I'll drain your filthy blood, then, I will chop up your dried carcass and hand it over to my lord. He's the one getting leftovers from
Potter nods, his eyes fixate on the ground, and Severus has to bite back a sigh as he summons a roll of gauze from the first aid cabinet. Potter needs to come to terms with this in his own time, and Severus needs to make sure Draco is stable before leaving. He's still on a time limit here. He presses a fresh square of cloth, this one soaked in disinfectant too, against the ugly looking wound, he starts wrapping it up.
Death Eater. Death Eater, she's a Death Eater. She's with them. His mind is scrambling. This was exactly what he had been afraid of that very first day he found Potter unconscious.
By the time they make it up the stairs, Potter’s almost ready to collapse, but thankfully Draco looks passably alert and is supporting his own weight, and partially Potter’s, Severus ignores the glances they both throw at him and assesses the surrounding area. They have half a story to go to reach the main hall that leads to the study.
Just as the third-minute passes and Harry’s slumped down next to Draco, he hears a subdued crack, he peels one eye open and stares at the empty dark corner with bated breath. He hadn’t imagined that noise.
Chadwick Aaron Boseman was an amazing actor, he brought to life, not only a superhero, but a whole nation. May you rest in peace, Wakanda forever.
The boy knows who he is. He knows that Severus works for Dumbledore and he still dares question him right this second? The torture must have gotten to his head.
He looks at the floor. It's such a sharp contrast to the pristine dark marble floors that he'd seen in his dreams. Before they'd been stained in blood. He can almost see it now. Her twisted broken body, lying limp after what felt like
A Harry who currently looks very preoccupied with a colony of seagulls. There are two of them sitting on either of his shoulders, and Harry is actually petting one of them in his lap. Several others flap around.
He heaves his bag over his shoulder and walks out of the bathroom, and then almost groans, only smothering it by the thinnest thread of will. He doesn’t let his steps falter as he walks, keeping one eye discreetly at the shadow tailing him not so discreetly.
Rosier wouldn’t help. Bellatrix might, only after she’s had an extra round with him. Harry cannot afford either in this state, and Draco is burning up already. He needs to notify someone who might care. Maybe Lucius Malfoy. But how?
Elen and I worked very hard on plotting this fic, every little detail is accounted for to drive the story forward and present enjoyable reading material. That being said, Harry and Draco's relationship might seem like it's on a slow burner for now, but all will be rectified very soon.
Draco’s lips quirk when Harry starts ripping at the lower half of his shirt, already ragged in places from where he’d torn it last night. But then concern takes over, “You’ll be cold.” he says.
It had all felt so raw. So real. He can still hear the screams echoing around in his head and the flashes of curses. The blinding green light of the
"What is it?" Harry asks and Draco holds the stare only for a beat longer before slowly shaking his head. Harry doesn't know. Either he is unaware of this little incident of his, or he doesn't think that Draco's noticed. Or maybe, and most interestingly, Harry Potter doesn't give a shit about what Draco thinks about him at the moment, and is just blurting out a natural, automatic response as a result of Draco's eerie staring.
"Haven't you been taking any?” Severus looks surprised. Draco is too, even though he shouldn't have been. He's never seen Harry take any pain relievers for himself and like a moron had just assumed that Potter binged on the thing while showering.
“You need shoes,” Draco says, and Harry stiffens. Draco looks around the crypt urgently, foolishly, as if waiting for a pair of shoes to pop up any second out of nowhere.
“I’m making you drink it if it curdles,” Harry shoots back and they exchange a light grin before getting back to the task at hand.
"What do you have to say for yourself now, Mr. Malfoy?" she digs in her wand harder, making him wince.
But then Harry’s turning to him with his face set in mounting horror. And Draco realises the burning pain in his shoulder isn’t because Harry’s gripping it too tightly. Because Harry’s hands are no longer on him and they’re… very
The man had saved his life, after all. More than once. He even did it today, by catching Harry's poisoned hand by pure luck. Granted, the poison is his creation to begin with, but Harry prefers to look at the silver lining. If it weren't for him, Harry would have most likely been dead in a few days' time, especially with the rapid pace with which he was consuming those nerve soothers. Not only they didn't work, but also accelerated his potential murder.
'This is the third time I'm cursing my eyes in a single day, ' Harry thinks, ' That's a new record. '
Draco wraps Harry’s arm around his own shoulders, gritting his teeth at the intense ache. He can do this for Harry, of course, he can. He stands up, pulling Harry’s light body with him. The scrawny boy clings to him for life, and Draco squeezes the arm around Harry's waist.
“I’m not sure?” Potter’s voice is timid, as if expecting to be yelled at. Severus sighs. He keeps forgetting to be gentle with the boy. He avoids Potter's eyes and summons a muggle style paper and pen.
Draco thinks he can intimidate a fucking muggle into giving him something that didn't come out of trash. If he can't even do that much, then what is he?
"Alright," Sirius starts, clad in only a blue robe and his pajamas underneath. He didn't spend his morning preparing for this, he’d almost drank three more bottles of beer during breakfast. Really, they should be grateful he’s sober and present at all.
Chapter warnings for; explicit language, mentions of self harm, mentions of child abuse, blood, violence, the usual.
This feels crushing. Trying again and being pushed away. Draco groans, rubbing a soapy hand across his face.
On the way to the dungeons, Severus doesn’t encounter any other Death Eaters and doesn’t know if he should be relieved or suspicious. He settles for suspicion and asserts more confidence into his stride even as he remains cautious.
"Well, John," Fudge says, wiping his mouth with the napkin. "I wouldn't quite call it a Death Eater attack. A bit too strong-worded, isn't it?"
He pats Draco’s uninjured cheek, gently at first, then a little more roughly. Draco’s eyelids flutter, and he mumbles something incoherent.
Harry throws one last desperate look at Malfoy, who doesn't return it, before slowly pushing himself to his feet. Umbridge watches his every move, a disgustingly wide smile on her face, stretching it like pliable dough.
Potter's eyes narrow, he clutches his hand harder. Hard enough for it to start bleeding again, small droplets roll from between his fingers. "I was just leaving." Potter bites out.
The bedroom is just as sparse as he remembers it being, with the exception of the slightly rumpled bedsheets and the clean windows, which had been coated in a thin sheen of dust the last time Severus had slept there.
"I can hear you all, you know," says Julia, rolling her eyes. "You guys suck." Kingsley rolls his eyes too and steps out, passing Adams on his way out. As he passes, he can vaguely look in on the other Auror divisions, looking nearly drowned as flock after flock comes upon them.
Evan sends a cutting hex his way, this time on his calf. Harry can feel the warm blood spreading and howls.
"Matches." Harry's face pales. And he hurriedly pushes the bag aside, Draco can't tell if the shaking is from fright or the torture.
Hello dear all! We are SO in love with this chapter, and the one after this one~~~ Stay tuned for all that amazingness! Thanks a world to our Beta, you rock!
He hadn't lasted long under the Dark Lord's wand. Not even a full ten minutes. Evan somewhat envies him for it. For how easily he got away. His bleeding fingers are laced with agony at the slightest bit of twitch, even as the air brushes against the tender flesh where his nails were supposed to be.
Draco has no idea whether this is just a muggle implement or wizards use them as well. In his life from before he never even used to think about laundry.
Harry recognises Professor McGonagall’s voice too, who is partly hidden by the wall. "How is that even possible?"
“I think we can try a skin grafting potion now,” Severus abruptly announces, straightening up and vanishing the rag along with the used bandages as he produces a heavy-looking vial from his robes. Draco looks at the vial hopefully, a skin grafter would mean that his shoulder would at least stop bleeding. Which would be a huge improvement.
"Great," Harry nods, relaxing back again. After a few moments, he speaks up again, a strange tilt to his voice. "I need to tell you something."
Remus just stares at Sirius for a moment, taking in his haggard appearance. He looks almost as bad as Remus does near the full moon.
Kingsley cocks an eyebrow at the man, Murphy's earlier words ringing in his head. This isn't just incompetence. It's ignorance, bold, and repressing. Kingsley is very glad that he's joined the order once again. At least he's actually doing something for the war effort.
