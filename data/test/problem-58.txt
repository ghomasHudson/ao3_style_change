„You‘re the best thing that‘s ever happened to me, Harry. And this is the only time I‘m saying it. I am not some sappy Hufflepuff!“ Draco smirked, torn between hiding behind his safety blanket of pretend arrogance and showing Harry how much he truly cared about him. Remembering Harry‘s near panic attack just minutes ago, he realized that making Harry feel safe and loved was more important to him than staying in his comfort zone.
All fight seemed to evaporate from Harry and he sighed, feeling sick. "I'm sorry Hermione." He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand and plopped himself in the armchair by the fire.
„I messed up, Mrs. Malfoy. I said something I shouldn‘t have. I hurt him really badly. I treated him awfully and he didn‘t deserve it. I think he hates me now. He has every right to hate me,“ Harry‘s sobs were getting louder.
„Fuck, I‘m such an idiot,“ Harry murmured to himself and started backing towards the office door. Unfortunately for him, it opened at that moment and Draco barged in. A stocky young woman with long wavy blonde hair followed him inside. Harry plastered himself silently against the closest wall.
They'd agreed they would enter one by one so that they accidentally didn't bump the door and alert the robbers to their presence. Draco was to go first with Harry at his back, then Smith, and lastly Nott.
They were both naked again, their cheeks tinged with red, their hair sweaty and plastered to their face from their favourite morning activity.
Kreacher disappeared with a low bow. As soon as the door closed behind him, both Harry and Draco started laughing uncontrollably. When they were both able to breathe normally, Draco pulled Harry in a kiss. Harry tried to make it chaste but failed when he felt Draco's growing erection press against his thigh.
Draco jumped off the table and kissed Harry gently on the lips. He giggled when he heard Ron give a sigh that sounded suspiciously like retching.
"Mission accomplished, you can run back to her now," Malfoy continued. "That is how we indeed do our job. Yes, there are Sources. I and Theo find them and we dispose of them. That is the only way a ghost can truly be destroyed. Each ghost is strongly tied to an object that was closely linked to their life or death. Something that holds them in this world, something that stops them from moving on. Mostly it's their bones but it can be a wedding ring or a treasured possession they'd received from their lover. In the case of murder victims, it usually is the murder weapon. Now you can go back to Granger and report to her. No need to tag along with me at night. Now be a good boy and run back to wherever you came from."
Harry snorted. Malfoy got up and turned away, tossing the dirty, bloodied washcloth onto the edge of his desk. Harry felt the absence of Malfoy's body like a blow, his warmth, his musky scent, the softness of his skin, his breath tickling Harry's face, suddenly gone. Harry didn't know why or even how his crush on Malfoy reached epic proportions in less than one day. He only knew it now coursed through his veins, feeling as vital to life as blood.
"Alright, enough of this, Potter. Stop behaving like a child, we have to check the rest of the house," Draco said. "Together,” he added pointedly a second later.
"Even if you did, I would do it again," Harry sighed. Every second of pain he would be in tomorrow was worth the feeling that threatened to swallow him whole.
"Negative," Hopkins answered almost immediately. "Nothing recent. The door was unlocked, clear of any traces of magic."
He stopped and listened. He hoped Harry would come back, he wanted to wrap his arms around him, lose himself in Harry‘s smell, needed to feel the firmness of Harry‘s body against his own. Draco still felt betrayed but he needed Harry, he still loved him as much as he had before all of this happened.
A young wizard dressed in grey robes was crouching in the corner of the room. He was wearing a strange contraption fixed across his eyes. It reminded Draco of the Omnioculars fixed to his head with a band around his head. The wizard sneered and fired another salvo of hexes and jinxes at Draco. Draco threw up his Shield in the last second, the hexes reflecting off of it harmlessly.
Draco chuckled and wrapped himself against Harry's back. He pressed his soft cock between Harry's buttcheeks and pulled him closer.
"You can't change someone who doesn't want to be changed, Harry," Draco shrugged. "It doesn't bother me, anyway."
"It makes sense, doesn't it?" Harry asked, his head bowed in remorse. "All of this is my fault. If I didn't push you to come out…"
"Come away with me," Draco whispered. He didn't know why he blurted it out so suddenly but he knew he needed to be alone with Harry. He wanted to get to know him better desperately.
„I need help,“ Harry shouted as soon as they touched down at the Apparition point in St Mungo‘s. He‘d been here a few times before to get some minor job-related injuries treated.
"Let's head inside," Draco's voice pulled her out of her thoughts. "Don't use the flashlight, I don't want to ruin our night vision yet."
Harry ignored his quip and waited for Draco's affirmative nod. They both climbed the rest of the stairs. Harry’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. He peeked around the corner to his left, trusting Draco to do the same on his side. It was surprising how easily he came to trust him with his life. The corridor was dimly lit by the warm, yellow light of the street lamps. As Harry looked around, a sharper, whiter light of a passing car moved along the wall, brightening the space for a few seconds. The sound of the engine slowly disappeared in the distance, plunging the house into silence once more.
Draco obeyed him and crawled backwards onto the bed. He lied on his back, his torso propped on his elbows. His blood was boiling in his veins as he watched Harry crawl up the bed after him, his eyes almost black with lust. Draco wanted nothing more than to wrap his arms around Harry, stretch and lube himself with spells and let Harry ram inside his hole at once. Instead, he forced himself to stay still, to enjoy every second of it.
They'd gone through the Type Ones quickly. Draco didn't want to waste too much time on them as locating their Source was usually straightforward and the danger of being ghost-touched by a Type One was quite low. It was vital to pay attention to the ghost's location at all times but other than that, it was usually relatively easy to dispose of them.
"I didn't force her to torture him, did I?" Harry spat back. "I didn't fucking ask her to wipe his memory. He doesn't remember, Ron! I was truly happy for the first time in my life and she took it away!"
"Fuck this shit," a chant in a familiar voice resonated in the foyer and a loud banging noise reached Draco's ears. It sounded like footsteps running on a wooden floor.
Harry fidgeted in his seat, torn between telling Draco he'd snooped on him in his office and keeping it a secret. Their relationship suffered a lot in the past few days and Harry didn't want it to deteriorate any further, now that he and Draco were good again. He'd seen Draco accept such a letter, just before he went to the dark alley for the strange meeting with the hooded person. It must have been the kidnapper, Harry thought.
Harry stared at him incredulously. Draco seemed as surprised as Harry with his honest answer. It must have been all the alcohol they'd consumed, weakening the walls Draco had erected inside himself.
He fell down heavily in his chair. He expected Potter to be ecstatic to be finally rid of him. Instead, Potter looked… devastated. That could not be, he hated Draco! Draco recalled some of their last missions together. Potter always glared at him so intensely, it sent a shiver up Draco's spine and made him hot all over.
As soon as the door closed behind their client, Potter turned to Draco with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes. "He was awfully defensive when you asked him about a possible murder, don't you think?"
"Shhh, why are you crying, Draco? What is it? Please tell me," Potter closed the distance between them and hugged Draco tightly to his chest. He smelled like heaven as he whispered sweet nothings against the shell of Draco's ear. He seemed genuinely distressed. It made Draco's heart ache even more and it tore a wail out of his throat.
Harry obeyed him, mostly out of surprise. Malfoy disappeared in the bathroom and came back with a wet washcloth and a bottle of disinfectant. He kneeled on the sofa next to Harry and brushed Harry's fringe from his forehead with his hand. His touch was hesitant and his hand soft, and Harry unconsciously leaned into it. Malfoy's eyes widened but he hid his surprise by running the wet cloth over Harry's face gently. Harry's breathing quickened, he felt a thousand butterflies flutter in his stomach and he let his eyelids fall shut, lest his eyes betray the surge of tenderness and want he was feeling.
That's when the wall next to the main door exploded inwards, pieces of stone and masonry showering the ground. As the dust started to settle, rays of sunshine illuminated the hole in the wall. One very angry Harry Potter started climbing in. He looked like an angel of revenge, with his wild, untamed black hair and halo of sunshine above his head. Draco's head spun and he toppled forward, hitting his head on the marble floor. Then, there was only blackness.
"I don't know but it must have been really urgent. If I were you I would go right now," Draco smiled at him with a faked concern.
"I won't risk you getting hurt," Malfoy stood up and turned his back on Harry. He leaned against the windowsill, the muscles in his back shifting under his white shirt with the movement.
"The Dark Lord has some pressing matters he needs to attend to first. Which means I get to have some fun with you before he eviscerates you, you little cunt," Greyback growls. Draco screams and starts thrashing against his grip. He looks tiny, fragile, and vulnerable, all lean, pale limbs contrasting with the bulky muscle mass of the werewolf above him.
Harry started hyperventilating and fell on his hands and knees. He was beyond caring the alley stunk of piss, he didn‘t give a shit his left palm ended in a puddle of mud and refuse. Harry dry heaved. He felt sick to the stomach, his head was starting to spin, his heartbeat furious against his rib cage. Harry knew if he didn‘t get a hold of himself, he would faint.
„I have no idea what you‘re talking about, Potter. You should get your ears checked at St Mungo‘s,“ Draco scowled at him. It didn‘t reach his eyes though, those were still filled with happiness.
"Wait, are you saying?" Draco's grey eyes pierced him fiercely and his eyebrows knitted together. "Are you saying what I think you're saying?"
"I always knew Granger was smart," Malfoy chuckled. Harry felt his eyebrows disappear under his fringe at Malfoy's easy admission. Maybe he'd really changed for the better. Harry was certainly willing to believe it. People changed, so why couldn't Malfoy be a good person these days?
Draco couldn't help himself. He had to stare at that beautiful face only inches from his own. Potter's eyes sparkled with mirth and Draco's breath caught in his chest. Something must have crossed his eyes because Potter's expression changed, becoming serious. His eyes had gone dark and flicked to Draco's lips.
"Set up the chains, now," Draco told Harry, trusting him he would follow his instructions. "I'll keep an eye out for Mrs. Emsworth's mother. Well, her ghost, anyway. What type do you reckon it is?"
„I saw him kiss some guy in an alley. I‘m so sorry Harry, it was so awful, they were grinding against each other and… That was three weeks ago. I‘ve honestly forgotten about it until Ron told us you're together,“ Ginny‘s eyes glistened with unshed tears. „I‘m so sorry Harry, you don‘t deserve that.“
Harry beamed at Malfoy. He could picture Malfoy uttering those exact words with a look of utter disgust on his face. Harry giggled. Malfoy pointedly ignored him.
"No, it relates to everything that has even remotely anything to do with ghosts. Now hush," Draco scowled at him.
"Haven't you noticed that everyone I slept with was tall, lean, and blond?" Harry was suddenly grateful to Ron for pointing it out to him and Harry was finally able to admit to himself Ron had been right all along.
When he relatively calmed down, he explained to her the events that lead to his memory loss, as he'd pieced them together from his memories of waking up tied to a chair in an abandoned warehouse, to his hospital stay. He told her what the doctors had said and what his mother had told him about his relationship with Harry.
"I haven't thought about it that way," Draco admitted reluctantly. "All this bloody time I've been feeling so empty as if a piece of me was missing. I thought everyone felt that way after they'd lost their memories. I thought it was normal."
"We should go somewhere again, soon," Harry smiled at the real Draco, sprawled in the chair. He wanted to get away from here, from the people trying to hurt Draco, from the insults and prejudice. Get away from the pain and forever wrap himself in Draco's smell, taste, and warmth.
"I admit, I might be slightly confused. Do you or do you not want me as your partner? Not that I'm complaining, mind you," Harry added quickly when Draco looked at him sharply.
Harry seemed to deflate at his words. He pouted, bowed his head and a frown appeared between his brows. Draco silently cursed. He hated seeing Harry like this. It did weird things to his stomach, for some reason.
Harry gulped, swallowing the sudden pang of arousal that shot through his body, as the image of Draco's nose being anywhere close to Harry's naked arse assaulted his mind.
„Where are you going?“ Ron asked suspiciously. He had been watching Harry closely ever since they woke up that morning.
"It was nice working with you," Harry smiled sadly and stalked out of his former office, away from his former partner.
"I know you work hard," Harry said quietly. "I can see how much you love your job and I admire you for what you've built here. It's pretty amazing, surely you must see that. That's why I want so desperately to be a part of your agency. Being an Auror, with how badly the department is lead right now, disgusts me. I want to do what you do. Save people's lives, protect them, help them. And I want to do all of that by your side if only you let me. Not for a few weeks, until we collect the ectoplasm samples for Hermione but after that too."
Harry gulped. Harry and Draco's sex was always fun but usually, they took their time and made it sweet and loving. However, on occasions such as these, Harry loved being fucked roughly. Draco kept Harry's wrists pinned above his head with one hand. His other hand slid across Harry's flank, down his thigh, and back up to cup the round globe of his arse. His fingers dug deep in the flesh of Harry's arse cheek. Suddenly, the hand drew away and slapped him hard across the soft, firm skin there. Harry shouted out loud.
"Come on, Harry, you know that's not true. He's just a bit dimwitted when it comes to feelings. Just give it one more try," Blaise sighed, leaning against the cubicle door.
"Now that's a first," Draco chuckled good-naturedly. He wrapped his arms around Harry, settled himself snuggly on the sofa, and closed his eyes with a content sigh.
„I know that now, Harry. I love you too. I‘ve come to terms with it already,“ Ginny smiled at him sadly. „But this is important. I keep thinking about it since Monday since Ron told me you and Malfoy...“ she trailed off.
"On a case," Pansy said over her shoulder, already making her way to the kitchen to put the kettle on.
After Harry behaved like a total nutter. After Harry broke Draco‘s heart. After Harry irreparably ruined their beautiful relationship. After Harry utterly fucked up. Harry‘s eyes prickled with tears again. He blinked a few times, made fists with his hands, and drove his nails back into the wounds that were already there. The physical pain helped him overcome the emotional pain that threatened to spill over the edge. He couldn‘t fall apart yet, he had to stay strong for Draco, even if Draco didn‘t want him. Even if Draco never wanted him again.
Draco nearly choked on his words, anger welling inside him. How could he have hoped Potter cared about him when he went to pull some unknown bloke while Draco was still lying in a hospital bed?
"Finish your reading assignment, then we'll move on to equipment. I want us to cover most of it by Wednesday morning. We'll go on our first case together Wednesday evening," Malfoy informed him.
„I mean look at him,“ Harry exclaimed. „The way his hair falls in his face is so annoying. Why can‘t he wear it like in the second year, it was so ugly, slicked back and shiny and all.“
At that moment, the Floo behind Ron flared to life and out stepped Pansy and Blaise. The surprise on their faces was palpable. Draco silently thanked Harry for convincing him not to tell their friends they were dating in advance. Their expressions were priceless.
"In all honesty, I have no idea. He seemed a bit under the weather. Maybe trouble at work?" Ron muttered.
„I love everything about you, your smile, the way you scowl at me when I make your tea too hot. I adore watching you sleep. When you hug me from behind when I make dinner, my heart melts. I cannot imagine not having you in my life, Draco,“ Harry whispered. Suddenly he felt hesitant and wanted to end his speech there. Worry coiled in his stomach.
„That‘s why you love me so much,“ Draco waved his arm stoically while observing Harry from the corner of his eye.
"Yeah, piss off, Ron," Harry cut in. Draco was taken aback by the harshness of Harry's tone. He didn't sound like he was joking.
"I would set them up somewhere closer to the possible location of the Source, maybe the corridor upstairs?" Harry shrugged.
„But then I‘ll have to get off of you, git,“ Harry rolled his hips seductively. „Is that what you really want?“
„Oh God,“ Harry‘s voice hitched. He grabbed Draco‘s butt eagerly and started kneading it between his palms. He wrapped his arms securely around Draco‘s body and stood up with Drhim still in his arms. Draco bit his neck and Harry groaned. He couldn‘t believe how horny Draco made him feel all the bloody time. He nearly threw Draco on the desktop and started fumbling with the buttons of his trousers. Draco started tugging at his own trousers and pants impatiently.
„Dracooo!“ Harry exclaimed, the o morphing into a long moan. Draco suppressed his gag reflex. It wouldn‘t do to throw up all over Harry, he thought to himself. He returned to a safer position, drawing his attention back to the head of Harry‘s cock. He sucked at the head, his cheeks hollowed, with short but forceful movements. Harry‘s whole body started trembling, his legs twitched involuntarily, his chiseled out abdominal muscles contracting fast and the hand in Draco‘s hair gripped him so hard it must have surely ripped half of Draco‘s hair out. If it did, Draco would make Harry pay later. He could already think about at least a dozen ways to discipline him.
"Draco, you're such a git, you scared me," Harry breathed out in relief. "Well, you're not supposed to exert yourself this weekend. Doctor's orders."
"Potter," Malfoy sounded exasperated. "I believe you. I'm sure you are more than capable of taking care of yourself in a fight against Dark wizards and criminals, with hexes flying all around you. I'm certain your Shield Charm is nearly impenetrable. But you have no idea how to fight off a Spectre or a Poltergeist. It took me and Theo nearly a year of research to come up with the defenses we use now. All of it through trial and error," Malfoy turned around and looked at Harry. Something like pain crossed his eyes. It was gone in a second but Harry knew he didn't imagine it. "I'm not taking you, that's my final word."
He didn't see Harry in the library but found an envelope on the coffee table with his name on it written in Harry's scrawl. He eyed it warily. Why would Harry write him a letter? Did he leave? Did he want some time away from Draco? His stomach twisted. He opened the envelope gingerly and started reading.
The goblin sneered at him. "After a certain break-in a few years back, we were forced to increase the security measures. You might remember the accident, Auror Potter."
"Remember what I said, Harry. I mean it. This could cost both of us our jobs," Robards eyed him sternly.
Harry didn‘t have to turn around to know what Draco was doing. Instead, he listened for the telltale clink of the belt buckle, the sharp rattle of the zipper, the whisper of cloth dragging over skin. The quiet anticipation made his cock throb harder. Harry arched his back and huffed, sticking out his arse invitingly.
"Let's just say that Granger is much better at persuasion than you are," Malfoy snickered. "Yes, I'm going to make you my apprentice."
"I know, I just…," Harry sighed and closed his eyes. "How am I supposed to stand by and watch you get tortured?"
Draco has been behaving strangely in the past week. He's been coming home late from work, complaining about being tired all the time. Which means no sex. Harry can survive that, really, he can but he can't help but feel suspicious and decides to find out what's his boyfriend up to.
Harry exhaled deeply as he observed the mansion standing before him with suspicion. It looked different in the faint daylight, even though it was cold and damp outside, the sun mostly hidden behind dark, heavy clouds. Harry entered the house with trepidation. The atmosphere inside the mansion felt less oppressive than it had over a week ago. He could still feel the strange weight in the air he was breathing. He could almost taste it on his tongue, but it was less… less something he couldn't quite name. He started wandering without a goal through the various rooms on the ground floor.
Somehow, Harry hopes he can save him. He remembers how he used to follow Malfoy around, trying to figure out what he was up to. He remembers the times he intruded on Malfoy's private moments when Malfoy would strip, get in the shower, and soap his body mechanically, quiet sobs escaping his throat. Harry knew then Malfoy wasn't a bad person. He was caught up in a war, just like Harry was. He was forced to play a role he didn't want and Harry understood how that felt.
Harry wasn't tired anymore. His blood was singing with arousal. He should be angry. Angry at Ginny for interfering with his life, for trying to break him and Draco up. If Ginny truly cared about him as she'd claimed, she would have seen how content Harry was, how loving his relationship with Draco was, and she would have been happy for him. Instead, she got jealous and tried to destroy the best thing that had ever happened to Harry. He would be angry later when he wasn't naked with equally naked Draco on top of him, when Draco's cock wasn't rutting against his own, when the mischievous gleam in Draco's eyes faded, and when Harry wasn't so painfully hard.
"Pass the chips, will you?" someone said. It took Draco a moment to realize it was addressed to him. He blinked slowly. Before he had a chance to grab the basket of aforementioned chips, Potter leaned over Draco and propped his arm on Draco's thigh so that he could reach for the basket. Potter's hand was hot against the fabric of Draco's trousers and oh so close to his cock.
Before Pansy could reply, a loud bang resonated through the foyer. It had come from upstairs. The whole house shook with the force of it, and the oppressive atmosphere that had been pushing against their senses suddenly gleamed triumphantly. Without waiting for Pansy's answer, Draco whipped around and rushed upstairs, hand gripping the hilt of his rapier tightly.
They looked around the room, noting the position of the single bed pushed against the far wall. To the side, there was a rocking chair, situated so that anyone who would sit in it could gaze out to the garden through the double window. There was a fireplace on the wall behind the chair. Draco couldn't see the dust covering the mantel, the bed, the sheets, the carefully folded blanket draped over the back of the rocking chair but he could smell it. Trinkets, carved boxes, and framed pictures decorated the mantel, making the room look rather homely and lived in, even in the dark.
Harry carried candles over from the bedroom and arranged them on the sink, cupboard, and floor. He filled the tub with hot water and added lots of foam in Draco's favourite scent that was woody, fruity, and spicy all at the same time.
Potter sulkily flopped himself into the chair Draco had moved over for him. "I know how to interrogate people," Potter whispered furiously.
"Change of plans. We wait for it to appear again. At least I think it will. It seems to be stuck in a loop, replaying its last moments. Then we're going to try to force it back, to show us where the Source is located."
„Only in the past few days, it‘s been really strange. I think I‘ve been losing hours, too,“ Draco whispered.
"Don't burn the chicken," Hermione pointed at the stove and disappeared into the corridor with a happy laugh.
Draco curled against Harry‘s chest as Harry lifted him up and let out a shuddering sigh. He walked to the bedroom and placed Draco gently on the edge of the bed. He pulled the bedsheets down and positioned Draco in the middle of the bed. He started undressing him slowly, first the jeans, then T-Shirt. He stopped before taking off Draco‘s boxers to grin up at him.
I got back together with Ginny because I felt like I was supposed to. Everyone expected it of me and I was lost. It seemed reasonable at that time. I loved her as a sister and thought that was how one was supposed to love their girlfriend. There was never any passion between us and the relationship felt dead. It took me a long time to realize that I would never love any woman in any other way but platonic. Even after I admitted to myself I liked men, it took me a long time to break up with her. I was too scared to lose one of the few people I had left in my life after the war.
"At first I thought I was going down with the flu, except the Pepper-Up potion didn't work. I was tired all the time and my muscles hurt as if I'd been exercising," Draco shuddered as he remembered the feeling. "It was much worse on Friday though, I came to Grimmauld Place and I was barely able to stand, my vision was swimming and I felt like throwing up." Draco glanced at Harry warily and noticed the shame and regret reflected in his face.
At this, Harry's fingers began stroking Draco's spine tentatively, running over the niches and hills of his vertebrae. "Then, one day, you decide to play the piano again. You sit down and spread your fingers across the keys," Harry's fingers stilled in their position. He licked Draco's earlobe and whispered. "And then you start playing, your fingers fly across the keys, the melody as beautiful and as sweet as ever." Harry's fingers flew across Draco's spine, caressing it, his movements slow, then fast, then pausing, picking up speed again.
"I'm so sorry, darling, I really am. But why are you even here, alone? Why don't you go to him?" she asked gently.
"I am not taking you with me to get us both killed, you barmy git," Malfoy sneered. He walked around the desk toward the door, motioning for Harry to leave. "I'm sorry, I can't help you. Just leave, please," he didn't look at Harry as he said so.
To Draco's relief, Harry snickered and rubbed the back of his neck. "I don't know shit about design. You came up with this."
Draco batted his hand away and frowned. "Of course not, I'm just not overly fond of them, that's all."
"You'll think of something, now go before I give your butt the kick it deserves," she smiled at him exasperatedly.
Harry watched Draco's lean body wearily as it disappeared through the narrow opening and Harry readied himself to follow. The door slammed shut before his very eyes and dread flooded his body.
"Good," Draco answered from under a set of stairs leading up to the first floor. "The temperature is pretty stable around the hall, however it drops to nine degrees over there," he pointed to a gaping dark hole in the wooden paneling decorating the walls. Pansy realized the door must have been difficult to spot before someone left it wide open. "It's consistent with what Tracey told me. She and Potter encountered the ghosts in the cellar," Draco nodded in the direction of the looming darkness. "And the temperature dips here a bit as well. Not significantly, just as I expected. Potter found the dead Aurors somewhere upstairs, it's bound to get even colder up there."
He hated Welcome-Back Breakfasts. They were a tradition among the Aurors. Every time someone returned to work after a hospital stay, no matter if it was just a quick in-and-out, getting a few scratches treated and leaving in a few minutes, or a prolonged stay, a Welcome-Back Breakfast would follow the next day.
"I couldn't leave them there to die!" Harry shouted. He ignored the stares and glances thrown in his direction. All the dread he'd been feeling just seconds ago ignited in his chest, transforming into anger. "How could you just abandon them like that?"
"I deserved it," Harry smiled, a corner of his mouth turning up. "I wanted to punch myself too at one point."
"Yeah, sorry for being late," Draco said. He looked around the table. The only free seat was next to Potter but squeezing there would mean asking Thomas and one of the male Weasleys to get up. "I'll just grab a chair and…"
"I think, you are still in love with Harry. I find that understandable, who wouldn't be in love with him. I mean look at him, he's rather spectacular," Draco bit his lip seductively and let his eyes roam hotly over Harry's body. "However, I find your affections rather pathetic, given Harry's as bent as they go. Even if Harry broke up with me, he would never go back to you. Thats' why you made that story up, isn't it? Because you thought you could force him back into your arms?"
Mr. Gladstone seemed to think about the answer for a bit. "Two were Muggles and one of them a wizard if I recall correctly. Is that relevant?"
"I'm sorry, Harry, but Auror Malfoy specifically requested to be partnered with Auror Goldstein," Robards looked compassionately at Harry. "I thought you were getting along these days."
"Type Twos are the ones we should focus on primarily," Draco said out loud. "They retain more of their personality and in general are smarter than Type Ones. Type Twos will follow you around, some of them will even try to hurt you on purpose."
Davis nodded at him and they both entered the courtyard carefully. Gravel crunched under their feet, the sound too loud in their ears. Harry winced and moved over to make his way through the overgrown, withered grass to his left. It rustled mournfully in the wind and caught in Harry's shoelaces. He stumbled and righted himself clumsily before continuing around the house to the backyard. Dark shapes of trees appeared from the darkness before him, the leafless branches standing out gloomily against the starry sky. Harry shuddered involuntarily and banished the thought of the branches being lifeless limbs instead, stretching out in a soundless cry for help. The only sound around them was the howl of wind and rustling of leaves and dry grass. Harry shook off the feeling of trepidation that coursed through his veins. The presence of the house loomed over him as if something was waiting for them inside, holding its breath not to spook them. As if that something wanted to lure them in only to never come out again.
Draco moaned under him. He grabbed Harry‘s hips and started slamming Harry harder and faster onto himself.
They reached the back door of the mansion and Harry motioned Tracey to take the left side. He stood on the right side of the door and swept his wand around the door frame and handle, searching for any hexes and curses that might have been placed there. He couldn't find any. A feeling of unease settled in his stomach. It seemed too easy and Harry desperately tried to shake off the fear slowly building in his stomach. Ever since Ron's accident, the fear of losing another person to the ghosts was almost a permanent inhabitant of Harry's body.
"Niffler here. We found some old ones too. Nothing recent. I don't think this is the right place, Falcon," Hopkins said.
"I love you, Draco, I love you so much. I swear I will make whoever did this to you pay, they will rot in Azkaban for what they did to you," Harry whispered roughly.
Harry had to decide fast. If he didn't use the adrenaline shot on McLaggen, he would certainly die. Maybe Cormac was dead already, maybe it had been longer than ten minutes since he was ghost-touched and Harry's effort was in vain. However, the adrenaline shots were not standard medical equipment in a Wizarding hospital and if he portkeyed them to St Mungo's now, McLaggen would die for sure. No one at the hospital would authorize Harry to administer the adrenaline there. Hermione was the one who came up with it. Her research and her parent's job as dentists had proved invaluable as ever. However, the Board of Healers didn't want to acknowledge any Muggle solutions and instead tried to come up with other,
"Fuck," Harry cursed under his breath. Colin's brother, Dennis Creevey, meant well but his emotions got in the way of his job sometimes. Especially when dealing with escaped Death Eaters, who were directly or indirectly responsible for his brother's death. In Harry's opinion, Dennis should have been demoted to a desk job after the botched kidnapping case.
"I promise, Draco, I won't. Come for me. Pretty, pretty please?" Harry repeated Draco's words from earlier. He tightened his arm across Draco's chest and pulled them even closer. Draco was shaking against him, his head was thrown back, his throat stretched in an invitation Harry could not refuse. He bit the side of Draco's neck and ran his tongue along the skin he held between his teeth. Draco's body arched and the loud moan that tumbled out of his throat as he came was music to Harry's ears. God, he'd missed this. He missed this Draco, so vulnerable, yet fearless man, baring his body to Harry's eyes, offering him his soul.
"Niffler. Affirmative," Harry could hear footsteps running toward them from the dining room. Derrick and Hopkins must have moved there while Harry and Tracey were investigating the cellar.
Harry pulled away and looked Draco in the eye. He seemed to be searching for something. A range of emotions crossed his face and settled on serious.
Harry stood frozen for a few seconds, unable to comprehend what had just happened. Why was Draco meeting secretly with someone in dark alleys? What was going on? Harry started pacing, kicking the trash lying around angrily. What should he do now? How should he ask Draco what the suspicious meeting was about without giving away he"d followed him? Harry‘s stomach lurched. He‘d been in a relationship with Draco for three months now and he never noticed anything odd. How long was this going on? And what was „this“ exactly. Harry‘s thoughts started wandering in a direction he didn‘t want to examine in detail for the moment. Was Draco‘s love even real or did he start the relationship because of some ominous goal he was trying to achieve? Harry started breathing fast.
The expressions in Malfoy's face change almost too fast for Harry to see. Fear, suspicion, wonder, hope, until it settles on resignation.
Harry is pushed inside the cell by a set of rough hands. He stumbles and would have fallen to the floor had Malfoy not steadied him. The door creaks shut behind them. The inside of the cell is all stone and not much more. There is a single cot with dirty bedding in one corner and a table with two chairs in the other. It's freezing cold and Harry shivers, being naked save his pants.
„Good, I don‘t want you to forget. I won‘t ever forget it either,“ Harry whispered against Draco‘s temple and it sounded like a promise.
Harry stood there, uncomprehending. He knew Ginny was jealous and tried to break Harry and Draco up. But for Ginny to stoop so low, to use an Unforgivable Curse on someone, to Obliviate a person to cover her tracks, it was too much for Harry.
Harry changed his clothes in a rush of anger and pain and Apparated to his favourite club. He needed to blow off some steam, to stop his heart from trying to wrench out of his chest. He latched onto the first blonde bloke he saw, dragged him in a corner, and started kissing him hard. The bloke seemed to love it by the rutting motions against Harry's groin and the moans coming out of his throat. Harry tried to drown in the feeling but he felt sick. The man's tongue in his mouth felt cold, slimy, and wrong. Harry tried to breathe past it. He could do this, it would feel good soon enough, it would take his mind off of the terrible pain cutting through his insides. The bloke sneaked a hand down Harry's body and palmed his prick over the fabric of his jeans. Harry couldn't even get hard. He felt ashamed and disgusted with himself. What was he doing? Fuck, Draco probably thought Harry was a slut and Harry just went and proved him right. He pushed the bloke away, turned around, and fled.
Malfoy grabbed Harry by the elbow and squeezed hard. "Hold on tight," he spat and Side-Alonged Harry back to the Malfoy Hauntings Ltd. headquarters.
"Haven't you noticed the air being chillier than usual at night? Heard any unusual sounds, such as knocking or wailing? Found any shattered objects without any apparent cause come the morning?"
"Come here, you," Harry smiled and hugged Draco tight. He buried his face in Draco's neck and inhaled his scent deep into his lungs. "Just so you know, I'm never letting you go."
Malfoy's face twists with an emotion Harry is not quite able to identify. "I hoped you would be able to escape."
Draco noticed a blush creeping up Harry's neck. Definitely hot in the club then. Harry removed his hand hastily and Draco's back suddenly felt cold. Even in the heat of the club, he missed the warmth radiating from Harry's palm and his questing fingers.  Draco frowned. What the heck was going on with him?
Harry flooed back to Grimmauld Place in a rush, only to grab his Invisibility cloak and rush back to the Ministry of Magic. He Apparated to the nearest Apparition point, threw on his cloak, and snuck into the Atrium. Instead of taking the lift back to the Auror offices, he took the stairs to the Regulation of Potion Usage and Utilization Department. He waited for a group of Ministry employees to pass him, then silently crossed the corridor to Draco‘s office. Harry knocked and held his breath. When there was no answer, he opened the door slowly and entered Draco‘s office. Harry had been here only once before, around a month into his and Draco‘s relationship. Harry had been sent out on a week-long mission and wanted to say goodbye to Draco properly, not by Owl. The office looked the same it had two months ago. It was clean, almost sterile, the folders on Draco‘s desk marked with color-coded notes, the books in the bookshelf sorted alphabetically. Harry crossed the room and quickly searched Draco‘s desk without disrupting anything. He smiled to himself when he saw a new picture frame propped on the desk. It was a photo of himself and Draco they‘d taken during their weekend off. They‘d gone to the Isle of Wright and rented a room in a Muggle guest house in a picturesque town called rather sadly Puckaster. It had been windy and the Draco in the picture was standing miserable on the beach, wind messing up his carefully styled hair. The picture-Harry winked at the camera and ran his hand through Draco‘s hair, messing it up even more. Draco gave a silent cry of rage and started chasing Harry down the beach. The loop started again, showing disgruntled Draco and mischievous Harry laughing at the camera.
He half regretted stopping Harry. His prick was swollen and painfully hard, throbbing with the need for release. However, reassuring Harry he loved him before he managed to work himself into another panic attack, was more important than getting off.
"So, any interesting cases while I was gone?" Harry deemed talking to Malfoy the safest option at the moment. Maybe the git would piss him off and it would decrease the temptation of humping him in front of his friends. Harry discouraged the slight possibility that angry Malfoy might be even hotter somehow than he already was.
"That's enough, both of you," Hermione shouted shrilly. She looked scared and she was crying. "If you want to kill each other, take it outside, you morons! You're supposed to be best friends, you're supposed to be there for each other during the worst of times!"
Draco took in a deep breath and grabbed a handful of the Floo powder. He was going to see Harry and Harry would know what to do, where to go from here. He didn't know why but he was sure of it. Excitement bubbled in his chest. He was going to see Harry. Harry, with his beautiful green eyes and rosy lips and maybe, just maybe Draco would get to kiss him. Again. For the first time.
„That is highly inappropriate, Ms. Huntley. First of all, you are my subordinate. Second of all, I am gay. Third of all, not that it‘s any of your business, I am in a very happy relationship. You are good at your job so I will let it slide this time. I hope this won‘t happen again, I would hate to have to report your behaviour. Are we clear?“
„You‘re such a tosser,“ Draco told the picture. He ran his index finger across picture-Harry‘s face. Picture-Harry winked at him and ruffled picture-Draco‘s hair who started chasing him down the beach. Draco snickered softly under his breath. He opened a file and started scribbling something potion-related in it. Harry realized he was stuck until Draco decided to leave the office.
Ron was standing still, continuing to look rather green. He reminded Draco of a fish out of the water, trying to breathe air and failing miserably. The way his mouth kept opening and closing was hilarious.
Cold spots were areas where the chill accompanying a manifestation was concentrated. Sometimes the temperatures reached below the freezing point. He checked his thermometer, which confirmed his suspicion. Minus five degrees. Draco turned around and crossed the attic, joining Harry in the protective circle. He welcomed the heat of Harry's hand which immediately found his lower back, rubbing slow circles there, warming Draco up.
"A wuss? I'm not the one who ran through a haunted house, screaming bloody murder, while being chased by a few measly ghosts," Draco shot back.
He continued trailing his wet kisses along Harry‘s skin, down the inner side of his right thigh, stopping at the knee, then moving to his left thigh and reversing the motion. He ended up with his face almost touching Harry‘s prick. It was standing at attention, glistening with precum.
„Mouth,“ Harry sighed. „I want to come in your mouth.“ His eyes had lost focus and his face had a dazed quality to it.
"Potter, I swear, if you don't stop running around me like a mother hen, I will punch you," Draco groaned.
Seeing Draco so distressed made his heart clench painfully but at the same time, it warmed him more than a hundred warming charms ever could. After a moment, Draco drew in a shuddering breath.
Harry grinned wider. Malfoy's eyes were glazed, his pupils dilated and he was sporting a rather promising erection. Harry didn't have an excuse for keeping his hand on Malfoy's thigh any longer and regretfully turned back to his pint.
"It's not my blood," Harry waved her off. "My partner, Draco Malfoy, he was just Portkeyed through the Auror Emergency Channel. How is he?"
"You're insufferable," Draco rolled his eyes, trying to cover the fact that his heart started beating faster. "We have rapier practice on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from four to six. You can join us, I'll give you the address later. Then, only then, if I deem your fencing skills sufficient, I'll lend you a rapier."
Ron staggered off the podium and dragged a chair back up. He climbed up the chair and pumped his fist into the air repeatedly, shouting even louder into the microphone.
Harry whimpered, ice spreading through his veins. He ran over to Draco and lifted him up. He could hear awful wet gurgling sounds escaping Draco's lips as he tried to breathe and he coughed out a handful of blood. He could feel more of Draco's blood seep out of his wounds, soaking Harry's robes, sticking them to his body.
Potter ignored him in the corridors. He ignored him in their Defence Against Dark Arts class. Draco had had enough. He hastily scribbled a note on a piece of parchment: 9 PM, YOU KNOW WHERE! He charmed the parchment and sent it over to Potter‘s desk. Potter flinched, quickly grabbed the note, and hid it in his pocket. Weasley suspiciously glanced in Potter‘s direction who just shrugged and pretended to pay avid attention to the lecture.
The door behind him opened and shut quietly. He heard a sharp intake of breath as footsteps shuffled closer to him.
Harry adds a third finger and continues his careful ministrations, stretching Draco intently. Draco pants and whines and whimpers, until Harry's cock is harder than it has ever been in his life.
"For the love of… are you going to turn everything I say into a bloody innuendo?" Draco sighed exasperatedly.
Harry wiped his tear-stained face. He'd been laughing out loud while reading Malfoy's rules and instructions. The comments were so Malfoyish in nature, Harry should have been appalled, yet somehow, he found them hilarious. Harry loved every word of every page, even more so because of the drawings that accompanied each point. Harry's favourite one was a caricature of himself, running away from a procession of ghosts who wore smitten expressions on their pale faces and seemingly tried to hunt Harry down for an autograph.
"Pans?" his stomach lurched painfully and his hand started trembling. "I don't know where he lives."
"I'm not going to make a fool out of myself again," Harry's voice broke and Draco's heart almost broke with it.
Harry stared at his reflection in the mirror. He knew he was screwed. All he could think of was the flex of muscles underneath a white shirt, impeccably styled blonde hair, the secret fond smiles Malfoy shot in his direction when he thought Harry wasn't looking. He imagined what it would be like to kiss those sinfully attractive lips. Harry sighed. He knew it was wrong of him. He should be concentrating on learning as much about ghost hunting from Malfoy as possible. He needed to solve the Problem, prevent innocent people from getting hurt and dying unnecessarily. He didn't want to lose anyone close to him to ghosts ever again. However, at the same time, he couldn't help but be inexplicably drawn to the blond git. Was it selfish to want to be happy while his best friend was suffering, carrying a child whose father wouldn't be there to see it born? Harry splashed cold water onto his face to calm down but it didn't help in the slightest. Tears stung in his eyes and he tried blinking them away. He didn't know what to do anymore. He felt utterly useless. He didn't know how long he could keep on feeling that way until he crumbled into pieces too small to be glued together again. Harry sighed, feeling pathetic.
"Of course, anything Master Draco needs," Kreacher barreled in through the door, wheezing slightly. He looked up at Draco, his eyes wide and earnest in his weathered face.
The hood was pulled back by a slender female hand. As it fell back, a mass of long red hair was uncovered.
"OK, don't be long," Draco mumbled. He looked like he was going to fall asleep while still standing.
"Fuck, this wasn't one of my brightest ideas," Harry grumbled, shaking the ghosts' paralyzing effect off, and started running up the stairs.
The old staircase creaked under the soles of his shoes. Harry's whole body was rigid, the memories of running up the same set of stairs that night, searching for McLaggen and Montague, assaulted his mind. Harry reached the landing and took a deep, steadying breath. He regretted it immediately. The stench of decaying wood, dust, and mould was even stronger upstairs and he could almost taste it in the back of his throat. He didn't remember the smell being that strong, he had barely registered it at the time, his mind occupied with more important things. Like saving lives.
The door opened and a medi-wizard Draco didn‘t know entered the room. Harry shot up, blinking rapidly against the light coming in from the corridor. It was still dark outside, dawn seemed to be slowly creeping in across the sky.
"The police?" Draco frowned. "Mr. Gladstone, are your guests Muggles or wizards if you don't mind me asking?"
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy since the Battle of Hogwarts. He'd joined the Auror training program, deciding to skip the eighth year and Malfoy had disappeared from the surface of the earth. Harry hadn't seen him or heard of him once in the last seven years. Over the years Harry wondered many times (out of habit) what had happened to Malfoy and what he was up to those days.
"Sorry, you're right," Draco interrupted him. "You weren't screaming. You were wailing. Truly pitiful, Potter."
"Haha, very funny," Harry sneered. He'd nearly forgotten how annoying the prat could be. "My request might possibly not be what you are typically used to," Harry paused. "I want to join you on a job… hunt… whatever you call it."
Draco allowed himself to smile, a corner of his mouth tilting up. "Yes, I thought so too. Maybe working with you will not be such a catastrophe I originally expected."
"I'm just trying to establish the pattern, Mr. Gladstone," Draco shrugged casually. The less he revealed about the ghosts' behavioral patterns, the better. At least for the moment.
Draco contemplated the question for a few heartbeats. „Yes, I will eventually forgive you but I don‘t think I will be able to ever forget.“
Harry crumpled above him with a shout and Draco tasted come on his tongue and in his throat. He sucked at Harry's softening prick, teasing his tongue around the tip. Harry wiggled above him, as his overly sensitive prick jerked.
"Right, sorry," Harry let go of his arms sheepishly. He couldn't help but notice the feeling of warmth filling his chest. This was huge progress towards figuring out the ghost plague since it'd started two years ago. And if Harry was completely honest with himself, touching Malfoy was actually nice, pleasant even. Harry wondered what it would be like, to start over, to be friends. Maybe more than friends, eventually. Harry flushed and bit his lip to stop the train of his thoughts.
As soon as the emergency bed was out of sight, Harry flopped himself down on a chair in the waiting area, rested his head in his hands, and waited.
"Oh, that's brilliant actually, the doctor said that hot baths will help with any lingering pain. It should relax your muscles," Harry stopped his rant abruptly when Draco's head hid the dining table.
Draco so did not have to listen to this. "Not everyone here is interested in Potter's private life. Go and be disgusting somewhere else, will you?"
They Apparated back to the temporary base, that had been erected close by. A section of Diagon Alley had been partitioned off to allow the Aurors to set up a tent of operations within a close range of the bank. A table with blueprints was set up in the centre of the tent, surrounded by Aurors. A goblin Harry didn't know was standing to the side, fidgeting nervously with his clothes.
„Well, yeah,“ Harry replied. „I was a Parseltongue. I didn‘t know what that meant at that time of course. Anyway, I was talking to the snake and it was just telling me it had been born in captivity. I remember I‘d found that relatable. Suddenly, my fat cousin Dudley started banging on the glass and interrupted our friendly chat. I got so angry and at that moment, the glass separating the visitors from the snake disappeared. My cousin, who had been leaning on the glass fell through into the exhibit.“
Harry ignores the figure and turns to Draco. He holds his face in his hands and looks deep into his eyes.
Harry finally lifted his face up. He was wearing a tortured expression and his eyes gleamed strangely as if he was about to cry.
Unknowingly, Harry had moved deeper into the room. He felt hairs rising along his arms and a shiver ran down his spine. Harry sluggishly turned around. He felt slow as if he was wading through a tub of gelatine. Lethargy slowly started taking over his mind. He felt strangely numb all over. The light of his wand illuminated the corner of the room during his slow turn and that was when Harry saw it. His eyes locked on the hunched see-through shape of a person. A ghost. Its eyes were bulging out, its face frozen in a never-ending grimace of agony. There was a clearly visible hole in their temple as if someone had drilled it there on purpose. Strangely, it seemed to be one of the sharpest places on the otherwise translucent body. The ghost reached out its incorporeal hand toward Harry and it started slowly but steadily floating closer to him. Subconsciously Harry knew he couldn't let the ghost touch him but his body wouldn't cooperate. He remained rooted to the spot, more firmly with each inch the ghost neared to him. Harry's mind was screaming, fear overtaking his rational thinking. The apparition was close now and Harry could barely breathe. He dreaded the moment the cold, insubstantial hand touched him. Harry wasn't ready to die yet. His hand inched toward his pocked, slowly. Too slowly. He knew he had to reach it before it was too late. Closer and closer came the hovering shape and Harry willed himself to move, to shake off the feeling of dread the ghost surely must have been projecting at him.
„Yeah, I am, Harry, just a bit longer,“ Draco whined pleadingly. His voice was strained with effort, his face contorted in a grimace of pleasure.
and how the government didn't have things under control, you see? That's when I realized…" Mr. Gladstone's fingers twisted, knuckles white, around the handle of the teacup Pansy had brought in. There was a pause before he continued. "I only saw it once, the ghost I mean. It was about two weeks after the first death, roaming the upper corridor of the house."
There was no sign of Montague of McLaggen in the first two rooms Harry had investigated. He reached for the handle of the third door and stopped. It was colder to the touch than the previous ones. Harry realized the cold must have signified the presence of ghosts. It had always felt colder whenever the spectres were near. Harry looked around the corridor again. So far there were no shapes reaching for him out of the deep, deep darkness. He turned the handle slowly and opened the door carefully. His eyes were immediately drawn to the glowing spot on the bed. It seemed as if the mattress was dipped in places; as if someone was sprawled on the bed. Harry could barely recognize the shape of a human being. It didn't move or acknowledge him in any way. It seemed to be rooted to the spot. The room was chilly but otherwise silent and still. Harry closed the door behind him and moved to the next.
"My instincts are telling me this is connected," Harry pressed on stubbornly. "I will not endanger Draco anymore than is strictly necessary. It's difficult to make sure he's safe enough as it is. The git insisted on going back to work tomorrow, and I nearly had to bind him to the bed to stay at home, at least for today."
„Incendio,“ Draco waved his wand and the letter burst out in flames. He threw the burning parchment in the wastebasket and grabbed his cloak. He left the office absentmindedly, seemingly lost in his thoughts.
"That is brilliant, Hermione," Harry said in awe. It sounded perfectly logical. Why hadn't they thought about it before? If one could find such a source…
They backed into the corridor and Draco closed the door shut behind him. As he neared the door on the opposite side, he started to feel relaxed and all of his previous anxiety started to dissipate. So far, they hadn't encountered anything worse than a Death-glow. The house didn't seem so bad after all. It was probable that Tracey's re-telling of the events was over the top, her fear distorting the reality of what had really happened, making it seem worse than it had in fact been. He took a careless step toward the door. He would check the room quickly, then the rest of the floor, and call it a day. Potter wasn't even here, as far as he could tell. He and Granger overreacted and Potter was surely sleeping safe and sound in his bed. Draco would punch the git in the face at the first opportunity he got. Pansy was almost inside the room now. Draco started to follow her but frowned. There was something nagging at the back of his mind. Something about the whole situation didn't feel quite right. What was it? What was wrong?
"Stop staring at me, Malfoy. It's not my fault you can't keep your eyes off of me," Potter growled, his smile changing into a scowl.
"Ickle Ronniekins," Pansy's voice was pure ice as she grabbed Ron by the ear to drag him away. Pansy only used Ron's childhood nickname when she was angry with her boyfriend.
Draco set Harry down in the bathroom and went to the shower to set the correct water temperature. Harry pressed himself to Draco's back immediately and sneaked his arms around Draco‘s chest, resting his cheek on Draco‘s shoulder blade.
Nothing happened. The spell seemed to dissipate without ever reaching the ghost. The wind around them picked up, beating at their faces, making Draco's coat flap around his feet loudly. The ghost lifted a hand. It seemed to curiously investigate the barrier the iron chains had provided. The hand pushed. Draco could almost feel the ward pushing back. He wasn't worried the protection wouldn't hold. Chains were failproof as opposite to iron filings.
Draco took a shuddering breath, his chest feeling heavy all of a sudden. He looked into those emerald green eyes, and all he could see there was sincerity and hope.
"Friendship, Ron. I come here to be with my friends. Why were you fighting with Harry, anyway?" Draco grasped at the chance to find out what was going on between Ron and Harry.
Light burst from the tip of his wand, illuminating his surroundings. Harry blinked a few times to let his eyes adjust to the sudden brightness. The stairs were wooden and like the rest of the house covered in a thick layer of dust. The plaster had fallen off the walls in places and beads of condensation gathered on the revealed stonework. A waft of dank cold air crept from the cellar and chilled Harry to the bone. He shivered involuntarily. The feeling of dread in his stomach was back, stronger than before. Harry swallowed around it and gingerly placed his foot onto the first stair. It creaked under his weight but held. Harry breathed in and continued down the stairs carefully. The air smelled musty and foul, and strangely of impending doom. As he descended into the cellar, he felt the temperature around him drop significantly with each step. The stairs opened into a large, concrete room, with no windows. Harry looked around and the sight stole all the air from his lungs. There were hospital cots with mouldy blankets haphazardly thrown over them, but what drew Harry's attention almost immediately, were the padded handcuffs attached to the metal frames of the beds. There were dry, brownish stains ingrained into the sallow padding. Blood. Worse still, in the center of the room stood a surgical metal table with various scalpels, knives, scissors, drills, and other tools arranged on top of it. Harry didn't want to imagine their purpose but he could very well guess it anyway. Harry swallowed the bile he felt rising in his throat.
"Master Harry calls, Kreacher obediently serves," Kreacher nodded solemnly and snapped his fingers loudly. Suddenly, Draco was standing in the middle of the room dressed only in his pants.
"Well, we told Ron, Hermione, Blaise, and Pansy on Monday. I stopped at the Manor on Tuesday and told Mother," Draco counted out loud.
The whole morning passed by quickly in comfortable silence. Both Harry and Ron hated paperwork but Harry would happily stay behind the desk for the rest of his life if it meant Draco's safety. Draco joined them for lunch in the Ministry canteen, and Ron even managed a relatively polite conversation with him about Quidditch. Harry lounged comfortably in his seat and a wave of happiness washed over him. Once they caught whoever was hurting Draco, he would be truly happy. He wouldn't need anything else, he would have everything he ever wanted in life. Draco and his friends, together. Draco caught him looking and smiled at him gently, before returning his attention back to Ron's rant about the Cannons' chances this year.
"You're worse than my eighty-year-old grandmother. She knows how to have fun. You're actually worse than a blushing virgin," Smith taunted him.
“Oh, for fuck's sake, try to keep quiet, you moron. You almost gave me a heart attack,” Draco hissed. His voice sounded both irritated and relieved at the same time.
The long shadows had blended into the darkness. They kept the lights turned off, as well as their flashlights, not wanting to ruin their night vision.
"That would be a Changer. A very rare but powerful Type Two. Changer, not very original, is it? Theo came up with that name and let's just say he's never been the poetic sort. Anyway, as the name suggests, they can alter their appearance during a manifestation. Imagine a ghost with octopus-like tentacles. Ugh," Draco shuddered at an unpleasant memory. Potter chuckled.
Harry jumped over to a table and poured Draco a glass of water. Harry‘s eyes were glassy, the green of his irises brighter than ever, the whites of his eyes shot through with red veins. He must have been crying for hours, Draco thought with a pang. Draco gratefully accepted the glass of water and took a gulp that immediately soothed his throat.
Draco eyed him suspiciously. He would have to try to fix it anyway. What if Harry was just pulling his leg?
"Three in the span of a month," Mr. Gladstone's hand was shaking as he took a sip of his tea. The cup rattled against the saucer as he put it down again. "The police is running their own investigation into the deaths. Of course, they were not able to find any reason why our guests died. Our establishment is closed until the case is solved. I don't have much money left and I cannot afford the business to be closed for more than a few months at best. You have to help me, Mr. Malfoy. I can't sell the place, it is my whole life."
"A homonym, Harry. A word that is spelled the same and sounds the same but has a different meaning depending on the context. Trace can mean the magic used to locate someone. But it can also mean a residue or a source," Hermione smiled, seemingly pleased with her own brilliance.
„I‘ve forgotten to check on my test potion I was brewing at work. I never leave the potions unattended but suddenly, I was in my office without remembering walking there. I thought it was just the fatigue I‘d been feeling,“ Draco replied matter-of-factly.
„Honestly? I didn‘t think it was fair, telling my friends and not telling yours. I wanted to tell them all at the same time so you wouldn‘t feel pressured or sad,“ Draco squeezed Harry tightly and tangled his hand in Harry‘s thick unruly hair.
Harry cradled Draco carefully to his chest and Apparated to the tent as soon as he felt the wards lose their hold on him. He resisted the urge to Apparate directly to St. Mungo's. He knew that the medi-wizards in the Auror base would be able to Portkey Draco directly to the operating room, saving precious seconds Draco needed.
"Yeah, I remember," Draco nodded. " I thought I must have stayed longer in the office without realizing. I was really tired too."
"I've already requested the authorization from my superiors, but it's going to take at least an hour to be granted it," the goblin stated, his expression passive once again.
„OK, deal!“ Ron replied triumphantly. „I‘m going to buy loads of stuff from the Honeydukes with your Galleon, once I win.“
"I'm glad you approve of my vicious, sneaky ways. You were a Slytherin, after all," Draco replied offhandedly. He couldn't help the jibe.
„I don‘t know. Everything hurts, Harry. My whole body is on fire,“ Draco‘s voice was hoarse from crying.
„Don‘t you bloody laugh, it was horrible! At one moment, I was holding a cuddly teddy bear and the next, I felt eight thin legs moving in my arms,“ Ron squeaked. „Bloody hell, I was three years old! Surely, that‘s not an appropriate punishment for breaking someone‘s toy broomstick, is it?“
"The thermometer, Potter! I have no idea what you thought I was talking about," Draco pretended to be offended. "You're such a pervert."
"Why not? I'll pay you a double of your standard fee, plus you will be getting the money from the actual job," Harry reasoned, rather pleased with himself. Not in vain had the Sorting hat claimed that Harry would have done well in Slytherin.
"God, you feel so good under me," Harry whispered. He lowered his head again to look at Draco and circled the tip of his cock around Draco's lips.
"OK," Harry sighed. "Later. Just tell me one thing. Will you still want me to work with you? Even though I can hear the ghosts? Even though I'm different? What if it turns out my… ability is dangerous?"
Draco closed his eyes and waited. There was the softest feel of Harry's hot breath against his skin, then even softer press of Harry's lips against his, gone in an instant. A thousand butterflies fluttered in Draco's stomach as he brought his fingers up and pressed them against his lips. His eyes flew open and he stared at Harry in astonishment. It was barely a kiss and yet it was the best kiss he'd ever had. Harry's gaze was wild, hopeful, and scared at the same time. He was biting his bottom lip vigorously and Draco felt an urge to sink his own teeth into the abused flesh.
"It sounds like some kind of creaking, like a branch of an old tree swaying in the wind. Or rusty hinges of a swing on a playground," Harry said.
"Are you sure you want to do this?" Harry stroked Draco's cheek gently. Please tell me I mean something to you, please tell me I'm not just a means to an end to you, Harry begged him silently.
It felt strange, waking up in his flat. He couldn't even remember when was the last time he'd slept here. A month ago? Two? Draco turned around in his bed, his hand automatically reaching for something… someone who was not there. The bed felt uncomfortable, cold, and empty. He sighed, got up, and padded to the kitchen. He made scrambled eggs for breakfast but as he ate them, he couldn't shake the feeling they tasted wrong, even though he'd prepared them the same way he always had in the past. Later, as he stood in front of his wardrobe staring into it, trying to assemble a decent outfit, he realized that all his favourite shirts were gone. Draco felt as if he didn't know himself anymore. He felt strange in his own skin. He kept waiting for something to happen but he couldn't figure out what.
Potter looked put out for a moment but nodded his agreement anyway. Draco wanted nothing more than to capture Potter's lips with his but he didn't think he could survive the pain of never being able to do so again.
„Nah, let‘s just focus on our grades, I need an O in Potions if I want to become an Auror,“ Harry replied.
Malfoy was pacing around the room like a caged tiger. Harry stared at him. Had Malfoy really been worried about him, about Hermione? Harry recalled Malfoy's expression earlier that day, the strange flash of emotion crossing his eyes, his hand curling around Harry's wrist, as he warned him.
The front door of the Edwardian house in the Richmond suburb in the Greater London they were standing in front of opened just then. A woman around thirty stood in the doorway. Her eyes narrowed when she slid her gaze over them haughtily.
Please trust me, please open up to me, Harry thought. He had to grab the pint with both hands to prevent himself from reaching out and stroking Draco's cheek.
"I don't know," Harry replied with a shrug. "It sounds strange but I really hope so. I want to get this over with as soon as possible. I want you to be safe. I want to catch the fucker and throw them into Azkaban for what they did to you."
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that," Harry blurted out, crossing the room swiftly. He laid his hand on Malfoy's shoulder in apology.
"The Tracking spell, before you make me forget," Harry chuckled and pulled away. He cast a strong spell that Draco had never heard of, probably some special one Harry had learned in Auror training.
"What happened? WHAT HAPPENED? I always knew Potter was stupid. I knew he was a reckless dumbass and that he always acted first and thought about the implications later. I'm actually starting to suspect he doesn't have a single working brain cell under that black bird's nest on his head because the stunt he's pulled now precedes even my expectations of him. Moron, idiot, fatuous oaf, dim-witted and utterly brainless fool he is!" Draco shouted. He kicked a chair that flew across the room, quickly followed by a mug he'd left on his desk earlier. It shattered against the wall and stained it with remnants of coffee. Draco leaned his arms against his desk, his back to Pansy. She could see his ribs expanding and contracting with every single hard breath he took. A few moments later he composed himself and his demeanor changed. Gone was the rage, replaced with a blankness Pansy hated seeing on him.
Harry growled and opened his mouth to tell Mrs. Emsworth exactly where she should shove her inappropriate remarks, but he felt Draco's hand, as it lightly wrapped around his wrist in a silent plea.
Harry took two steps towards Draco and raised his hand to touch his shoulder. He stopped himself, unsure Draco would appreciate the gesture.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's thigh under to table to keep him calm. "No, I have not been in contact with any Death Eaters since the end of the war. Excluding my father of course. I and Mother visit him every two weeks, on Sundays, in Azkaban," Draco replied calmly.
"Why? Why won't you take me?" Harry pressed on, sounding petulant even to himself. He needed the ectoplasm. Hermione seemed to be fixed on the idea, even though she hadn't said it out loud. However, Harry knew it was vital to whatever plan she had come up with.
"I don't want your pity fuck! Or are you that desperate to get laid tonight? Don't let me keep you from it then," he snatched his hand away regretfully.
"That you can't feel anything before it gets dark. I did, when I was in the asylum, trying to find the Sources on my own. Before you came and saved me, I could feel anger, terror, and pain, seeping through the walls. It was early afternoon and definitely not dark yet, although I recall it was a gloomy day. Also, I know this might sound weird, but I think I heard whispers as if the ghosts tried talking to me."
Tracey's eyes narrowed. "I should have guessed that was all there is to you. Anyway, I don't care about the reason why you're doing this. All that matters is that you help Harry."
Harry chuckled and realized he didn't mind Malfoy calling him a lazy bastard in that tone at all. Harry poked him playfully in the ribs. "Any more Type Ones you want to introduce me to?"
"Let's see what the ghost does. I would prefer to find out where the Source is first. Once we locate it, we'll draw the ectoplasm into the vial Hermione had provided us with. Then we'll disable the Source."
"How did you recognize it so fast? Do we have a secret Celestina Warbeck's admirer here?" Harry snickered.
„I wasn‘t talking to you, Weasel,“ Malfoy didn‘t even look at him and kept his piercing grey eyes trained on Harry.
"I do, it feels so surreal. I don't understand how or why but he's gotten under my skin so quickly. He's so driven and determined, you should have seen him back at the asylum. He was so brave, I couldn't take my eyes off of him. And he drew me a picture brochure. I'll find it and show you later, it was so cute," Harry smiled. "But I also feel guilty because you don't have that and…"
"Are you a virgin?" Harry gulped. He braced himself, expecting a punch in the face, only it never came.
I admit, it was not supposed to end this way but the story evolved on its own as if having its own mind. But there is one more chapter to go... to make this better?
This one was slightly ajar, illuminated by the moonlight shining in through the broken windows. The room was cold, almost freezing. Harry pushed the door open with his boot, one hand holding the wand, the other gripping a handful of salt in his pocket. Lying on the floor, skin turned pale blue, lips almost purple, were Montague and McLaggen. Harry looked around the room quickly but couldn't see any ghosts.
"I need to be alone for a bit. I'll go see Mother. I'll be back in the evening, we can talk then," he yielded.
"Wow, Potter," Draco drawled. "Who would have thought you had a knack for interior design, what with your atrocious fashion sense." Draco was a bit apprehensive about making fun of Harry, but at the same time, he couldn't pretend he was anyone other than himself. He hoped Harry would take the jest for what it was and wouldn't get angry.
"Hmm?" green eyes trained on him as Harry turned around, bringing their faces close. His breath tickled Draco's cheek.
„Are you OK, can I move?“ Harry was gripping Draco‘s hips painfully, shaking with the effort to make it painless.
"Don't worry about it too much, your ability already helped us tremendously tonight. Maybe it will improve with time, grow stronger, and you'll be able to hear them better," Draco mused.
Draco picked up a bottle of shower gel and suggestively poured it in his hand. He gently rubbed it between his palms, waiting for it to lather up, and started thoroughly spreading it over Harry‘s pectorals. He slid his Hands across Harry‘s arms and neck, down his sides, and up his back. He closed the distance between them and pressed their chests together. He let his hands roam over Harry‘s back, feeling every single muscle shift under his ministrations. He dipped his hand between Harry's arse cheeks and massaged his loose entrance gently. He could still feel his own come, leaking out of Harry's hole. He felt Harry‘s prick start to harden against his own.
"Harry, given the history of Mr. Malfoy and his family, we have to ask certain questions in order to…" Robards was quickly interrupted by Harry's indignant shout.
Draco only pulled him closer, deeper into his mouth, and sucked the now soft cock firmly. Harry's body spasmed above him and a loud gasp penetrated the air. Draco finally let Harry go and collapse onto his side next to Draco, who grinned winningly.
"I threw up and fainted. I woke up in the hospital," Draco decided to skim over the details of his and Harry's argument. He didn't want to watch the anguish in Harry's eyes.
Harry stood back and watched the medi-wizards Vanish Draco's clothes, baring his chest. It was covered with drying blood, scarlet contrasting with Draco's pale body. Harry's stomach lurched and he felt bile rise up his throat. The medi-wizards worked on Draco, trying to stabilize him enough with a set of basic first aid spells to make sure he survived the Portkey travel.
"Show me where your Source is," Harry shouted desperately. He needed to find it. He couldn't go back to Hermione with empty hands.
Draco had spent the last two days in the hospital, getting checked by the doctors, being prodded by wands, and examined by various diagnostical charms. All the experts agreed unanimously. Most of his memories from the past three months were gone, taken, deleted, cut out of his mind savagely, irreplaceably. Potter had stopped by on the first day, looking like a shell of himself. Draco was still shaken and confused, and soon he drove Potter away with his snide remarks and jabs. He didn't know why it hurt so much to see Potter's shoulders slump as a single tear fell down his cheek. Draco didn't know why it hurt even more when Potter turned away and left. His mother spent most of his stay in the hospital with him. She held his hand as she told him about his relationship with Harry, how devoted they were to each other, how palpable their love was in the air. Draco didn't believe her. He couldn't comprehend how a love that grand could disappear within seconds, extinguished by a mere spell. Love was supposed to be the strongest magic of all, so why didn't Draco remember a single second of his relationship with Harry? The answer was simple, he concluded. Their love had never been as strong as everyone seemed to think.
„Hermione, Ron, I would like you to meet my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy,“ Harry said formally. „Please remember you love me and you want me to be happy,“ he added rather beseechingly.
Thank you everyone for reading my story till the end! I've loved all your comments and support. Hope you enjoyed this last chapter and that it ended the way you hoped it would!
"I'm not going to tell you who he is. But if you figure it out, I promise, I'll let you beat him all you want and I'll gladly watch," Harry said and something like mischief flashed in his eyes.
"Three," Draco released the canister and watched it disappear in the darkness. A second later, there were two bright flashes of light as his and Pansy's flares hit the centre of the room. Bright sparks of hot iron filings splattered everywhere. The good thing about magnesium flares was that they spread iron and salt in their vicinity, effectively ridding the area of any ghosts. The bad thing about them was that the Greek fire they created in the process was basically a Muggle version of Fiendfyre. Draco watched in astonishment as the flames spread quickly across the dry wooden floor in a
Harry was furious, all the pain, anger, and frustration he'd been feeling, swam to the surface. He lifted himself up on his elbows but stayed on the ground. Part of him wanted Ron to hurt him. Part of him wanted to get hurt so badly it would drown the horrible pain of losing Draco. He knew that Ron needed this too. He needed to punch some, hurt someone to get all the rage out of his system, even for a few moments. He needed someone to blame for his family's suffering and Harry was the easiest target.
"What are you babbling about, Harry?" Draco croaked as if his throat was tight. "Don't joke about such things."
Harry sighed. "I'm sorry Draco, I didn't mean it. It was a joke. A very dumb joke at that. I'm sorry if you thought otherwise."
Harry pushed Ginny away from him. „I need to be alone right now,“ he said quietly, trying to control his temper.
"What are you babbling about, Potter?" Draco stilled and tried to swallow around the lump in his throat. It fucking hurt.
"I asked to be partnered with him permanently. I thought you understood that from my letter," Malfoy said slowly as if speaking to a particularly dim-witted child.
"Get in the iron-chain circle by the front door," Draco shouted at him, just as he and Pansy started running down the stairs with the same intention. "And under no circumstances use magic or Apparate, you madman!"
"I'm not sure I want that," Harry said softly, almost too low to hear. He whistled a few notes that had stuck in his head. "it went something like this."
Draco added a second finger and started moving in and out fast, as soon as he felt Potter adjust to the increased pressure inside him. Draco was so close, he had no idea how he was going to manage fucking Potter and not coming before he even started.
"Don't flatter yourself," Draco shot back. "It's like watching a trainwreck, it's horrible but you still have to look." Draco was proud of recalling this particular Muggle saying. It fit the situation like a glove.
A hand landed on Harry's shoulder and he startled. "Go," Robards said quietly. "We'll handle it from here."
"I miss him too, all the bloody time. I'm so sorry, here I go all about Malfoy while you suffer. I won't mention him again," Harry cursed himself for being so self-centered and inconsiderate.
Harry couldn't believe it, Malfoy came to save him. He wasn't the indifferent bastard Harry thought him to be. In fact, Malfoy looked positively Gryffindorish back in the asylum. The way he commanded him and Pansy, his natural leadership shining through, the way he almost recklessly disregarded his own safety measures and rules regarding the magnesium flares. Malfoy seemed in his element, rushing to save the day. To save Harry. Harry beamed at him, excited and a little giddy. He couldn't wait to do this again, with Malfoy of all people.
"And you stay quiet, I'm not done with you yet," Pansy stabbed her finger into Ron's chest. He immediately shut up and paled.
"Stop asking me," Harry hissed impatiently. "Fuck me, already, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me," he chanted over and over again.
Ron dropped the Invisibility Cloak. He was green and looked about to barf at any second. „You owe me a Galleon.“
He underlined the words One and Two he'd written on the blackboard in white chalk twice for a good measure. Harry had to admit Malfoy was a natural at explaining stuff. His enthusiasm made Harry want to find out more, know everything there was about ghosts. He knew he didn't have to try hard and he would still remember everything Malfoy told him. He wished all of his teachers at Hogwarts had been like that. Maybe then he would have actually paid attention during the classes. Harry nodded for Malfoy to go on.
Draco closed his eyes for a minute and tried to make sense of what the doctor had just told him. He heard Harry shuffle closer and opened his eyes.
Harry paced around his house like a caged lion. Malfoy always managed to get under his skin easily, sometimes without even trying. One minute he seemed to genuinely care about Harry not getting hurt, the other he was the same sneering prat he'd always been. Harry didn't understand this version of his childhood rival at all. Forcefully, Harry decided to stop thinking about the dolt and concentrate instead on the problem (or rather the Problem) at hand.
„Fuck,“ Harry slammed Draco‘s arse a few more times and came violently. His head was spinning and he felt like he was going to faint. When he recuperated, he slid his softening cock out of Draco who whined at the loss.
"Yeah," Harry groaned. Neither he nor Draco was into pain or bondage in the bedroom but right here, right now, the sharp burn of the skin on his butt, where Draco had spanked him, was perfect. Harry's whole body convulsed as the crack of another three slaps echoed in the room in quick succession. The sharp sting and burn in the places where Draco had just smacked him made his prick painfully hard. He started rutting against the silk sheets, seeking a reprieve from the arousal burning in his blood.
"I saw you at the bar yesterday," Draco overheard Smith talking to Potter. "It seemed you were having a good time, groping the bloke. I was worried you would choke him with your tongue for a bit there. Had a good fuck?"
„Mrs. Malfoy. Yes, Draco will be alright, I‘m sure he will be happy to see you,“ Harry‘s voice was choked.
„Bloody hell, Potter, are you going to just stand there or are you going to kiss me already?“ Draco quirked an eyebrow at him.
„You‘re not by any chance trying to get your Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder‘s Map, are you? Not planning on stalking Malfoy tonight?“ Ron narrowed his eyes at Harry.
Harry tapped his ear with his wand and re-checked his Listening Spell. It was a standard Auror protocol to use the spell for larger busts when more than two Aurors were present. When activated, the Aurors could communicate with each other within a mile radius.
Draco‘s head nearly fell onto his plate. Harry glanced at him fondly. Draco was so cute when he was unguarded, not hiding behind his mask of arrogance and pureblood upbringing. Harry loved these moments the most, when he could observe Draco, take in the beautiful line of his nose, the slender, pale throat Harry loved to kiss, lick and nuzzle so much. He adored that Draco held the knife and fork properly, even half-asleep.
"Let you down nicely? What are you talking about? I didn't understand a word you had said," Draco replied in bewilderment.
"It's over now, I'm here," Harry whispered and pressed a soft kiss against Draco's lips. Draco was tense under him, his lips stiff and unmoving. Harry was dimly aware of Robards sending off his Patronus for backup but he couldn't care less at that moment.
Draco felt as if he'd been hit with a Jelly-Legs Jinx, his knees were trembling and he would have surely fallen had he not been draped over Harry.
"We already picked out names, you know? Before…," her voice broke but she carried on in a harsh whisper. "Rose for a girl and Hugo for a boy."
Potter pouted. What was wrong with that man?  Maybe he wasn't Potter at all. Maybe it was someone Polyjuiced as Potter. Draco added that theory to his growing list to check later.
Harry stood up and moved toward the front of the house, his eyes flicking across the hall, looking for any signs of recent activity. The house was eerily quiet, the only sounds were the creaking of Alpha as they wound their way up the rickety wooden staircase to the first floor. Mumbled whispers of Niffler could be heard as they moved in the direction of the kitchen area. Harry and Tracey stopped in the front foyer and eyed the inconspicuous door disguised as paneling, next to the staircase. The doorhandle was covered with spiderwebs. Suddenly, Harry was a bit relieved that Ron was not there with him. Ron would be freaking out right now, Harry chuckled to himself. Ron hated spiders, ever since Fred, his brother, turned a fluffy teddy bear Ron had been holding, into a large, moving spider.
Draco circled Potter's rim slowly with his thumb. It earned him a loud moan. Draco gently eased a finger into Potter's tight, hot hole. Potter shuddered. Draco moved his finger in and out, then curled it slightly, searching for Potter's prostate. He found it and Potter meowled, falling face down on the bed, his arse arched up for more.
Harry frowned. Maybe Malfoy was right, maybe he should have stayed behind and let Draco and Pansy handle the cases. Draco would surely be able to collect the ectoplasm without Harry around. Hermione had deemed the extraction spell safe and they were going to test it tonight. Harry bit his lip. He hated the doubts seeded deep inside his heart but he couldn't stop imaging all the scenarios where their plan could go wrong. What if Draco got hurt because of him? Harry was new to ghost hunting and he was not sure he would be able to react properly if anything went wrong tonight. Would he be able to respond in time to protect Draco, without reaching for his wand? He couldn't bear the thought of anyone else getting hurt because of him.
He looked so put down and Draco felt his heart constrict painfully in his chest at the sight. Strangely, the pain made him excited and hopeful. He didn't fully understand where these feelings were coming from as all his memories of their relationship were gone, but the feelings were there nonetheless.
"Sorry, I should start at the beginning. Today, one of the Aurors, Weatherby, ended up in the hospital," Hermione said in one breath. "Nothing serious," she added immediately when she noticed Harry's worried expression. "Anyway, he'd placed a Trace on a suspect and therefore was able to follow him and Apparate easily to his location. You know better than me how Traces work," she waved her hand impatiently.
Harry had just carried the plates to the table when Hermione reappeared, her hair still wrapped in a towel.
He threw a pinch of Floo powder in the fireplace and spelled out Draco‘s address. He stepped through the Floo only to find Draco‘s flat dark and empty. Unease flickered through Harry‘s chest. Where was Draco? Has something happened to him? He couldn't be visiting his mother or his friends. Draco always told him those things in advance. Has Harry just forgotten? He Flooed back to Grimmauld Place and walked around the house nervously. Twenty minutes later the Floo flared to life again and Draco stumbled out.
"Come on, Malfoy! Besides, I would make it good for you," Harry jumped off the desk and moved away to recuperate from Draco's remark. What had he been thinking? Draco would never go for shameless flirting. Harry wanted to slam his head against the desk. He had to come up with something special if he wanted to convince Draco he was serious about him. He had almost overlooked a memo that had landed on the desk before him.
"What's the plan then?" Harry sighed and shook his head fondly when he noticed the radiant grin that spread across Draco's face.
You became everything to me. You are the air I need to breathe, you are the water that saves me from dying of thirst, you are the food that sustains me. When I heard the words "Malfoy's cheating on you", my whole world exploded. For me, it was never about trust. I was not able to think at all, there were no words or reason in the place in my headspace I went. I couldn't breathe, I was choking and I saw red. I felt like I was dying all over again (and before you roll your eyes and snort that I am being overly dramatic, I've died once already so I know what I am talking about). It was worse than dying. Voldemort killed me quickly, I barely felt it. The thought of losing you sent a searing pain through my whole body and shattered my heart.
"What's wrong with you, mate?" Ron finally righted himself and let go of Draco, albeit after two unsuccessful tries.
Draco elbowed Potter's ribs and took pity on him. "Come on, Potty, time for me, of all people, to teach you some Muggle stuff."
Harry slipped into the water and relaxed his legs on either side of Draco's hips. He pressed his groin against Draco's lower back and wiggled his hips several times. Draco shivered and sighed against him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and slowly lowered them both against the cold porcelain of the tub so that Draco was comfortably propped against Harry's chest. Harry slid his hand between Draco's thighs and ran his index finger gently across Draco's balls. He palmed Draco's sack abruptly, eliciting a loud gasp from him. He played with it, teased it, rubbed it between his fingers, tugged at the skin softly. Harry moved his hand up and wrapped his fingers around Draco's cock. It a bit soft because of the hot water but it was soon rock hard under Harry's ministrations.
"How could you be so selfish, you idiot?" Malfoy started shouting again as soon as they appeared in his office. "Do you have any idea, how scared Granger was? She was beside herself because you decided to play a hero again, you bloody Gryffindor oaf. Have you ever stopped to think for a second what it would do to her if you died? Have you thought about me or Pansy dying while coming to rescue you?"
"Potter, drop the fucking wand," Pansy shrieked and batted at Potter's bicep. "Draco told you not to use magic, you utter nutter!"
Draco would have started laughing if his heart wasn‘t breaking at seeing Harry so distressed. Sometimes Harry was hopeless, he often misread Draco‘s words and actions, expected to be hurt. Draco knew all of Harry‘s past by now and knew that being loved was the most important thing to Harry. He knew Harry lost too many people he cared about and he seldom let anyone new into his life. Draco felt honored that Harry decided to trust him enough to open himself up for possible pain. Harry often worried that his actions would cause other people to stop loving him. It was a gruesome remnant of his awful childhood and post-war stress. As a result, Harry often suffered panic attacks and Draco did everything in his power to help him through them.
Harry pushed a pillow under Draco's hips without breaking the kiss and lubed his cock quickly. Draco felt the tip of it press against his quivering hole and reveled in the sensation. He would finally feel Harry inside him, he couldn't wait. Harry breached him gently and slid fully inside Draco in one long, slow glide. They found a slow, steady rhythm together, their bodies sweating and quivering, their hearts swelling with love.
The presence of the darkness seemed infuriated, it felt more oppressive, and pushed forcefully against Harry's Lumos, trying to douse the light completely. He felt as if the darkness was suffocating him, its cold grip reaching for his throat, trying to restrict his airways. Harry focused his mind, wrapping himself in a protective blanket of concentration. He needed to push through. The first step toward McLaggen was the most difficult one, the next one easier, and the next easier still. The darkness raged around him, desperately trying to devour Harry, like waves in a raging, stormy sea would try to swallow up a meager barge. The silence was penetrated by a cracking sound. Harry tried to calm his breathing, to hear the noise better. His free hand reached for the second adrenaline shot at his belt while his eyes and ears desperately tried to locate the source of the sound. He crouched next to McLaggen's unmoving body, his eyes still fixed on the darkness around him. The cracking sounds were growing louder now, they were coming from directly above him. Harry couldn't see the ceiling but suddenly, he felt something fall down onto his shoulder. He yelped and jerked away. He could see bits of plaster falling on top of him and all around him.
"Come to think of it, I've never heard you mentioning anyone special in all the years of being an Auror," Smith laughed out loud.
Harry didn't care who saw him, he didn't care that the Aurors and medi-wizards streaming inside the warehouse were staring at him. A wave of despair crashed through him. He fell on his knees, hid his face in his palms, and wept.
"Give me a week. That's all I'm asking. A week and if we don't find the culprit, I'll report it through the official channels," Harry pleaded. "Look, I know I'm asking for a lot here. But this is my boyfriend we're talking about. I will do everything in my power to ensure he's out of harm's way!"
"Well, he did grow up to look gorgeous. And I have to admit, he's not the arrogant prat he used to be back at school," she nodded thoughtfully.
Draco recalled all those small, sweet touches Harry had graced him with over the past couple of months. All those times Harry scowled when some random guy tried to flirt with Draco. He remembered that one time when one of those guys wouldn't take no for an answer and followed Draco to the toilet. Harry had stormed inside, utterly furious, and hexed that idiot, not caring he was a Muggle.
More and more ghosts sprung into existence to his right and left. The room was freezing now and Harry's limbs were starting to grow heavy. Soon he wouldn't be able to move and the ghosts would kill him.
Malfoy snorts. "Why would you risk yourself for me, Harry? Your life is more important than mine will ever be." His voice doesn't hold the contempt Harry expects. Malfoy says it as a statement, a truth he believes wholeheartedly.
„You are everything to me, Harry,“ Draco whispered against Harry‘s hair, kissing his temple. He settled comfortably into Harry‘s embrace. „And you were right, I am scared. I haven‘t been this scared with Voldemort living in the Manor or during the Fiendfyre. I worry that if we tell other people, if the public finds out that we are together, I will lose you. What if your friends convince you I am not good enough for you? Please let me talk,“ he said when Harry inhaled rapidly, likely in preparation to protest, but Draco pressed his fingers against Harry‘s lips to stop him from speaking.
Harry ignored him. He rolled up his sleeves, got up to wash the mugs in the sink, and started drying them with a towel. Draco observed him silently, his eyes captivated by the flex of the muscles on Harry's forearms.
"Excuse my associate for his bluntness," Draco apologized and narrowed his eyes at Potter imperceptibly. "He's new. Anyway, you were saying there is a problem you would like us to investigate?"
"It's OK Theo, you don't have to sing. Just come up here, for me," Luna whispered as if talking to a frightened animal.
"That's good. The sooner we get those samples to her, the better," Malfoy nodded. "I want to figure out the Problem as much as you two do."
He placed the flashlight between his teeth and braced one foot against the wall next to the doorframe. He pulled with all his strength but the door wouldn't budge. He could see the coils of darkness coming closer, rolling and swirling toward them.
„It‘s not like that, Ron. I didn‘t even talk to him back then. I broke up with Ginny because I‘m gay and I couldn‘t pretend otherwise anymore. Believe me, I was pretty devastated because I did love her. Just not in that way,“ Harry replied. His voice had a placating quality to it. „I was devastated but at the same time, I felt free as I had never before in my life. I went to a Muggle gay bar the day I broke up with Gin. I wanted to make sure I made the right decision by ending the relationship. I needed to know what it was like to have sex with a guy, needed to know it was what was missing in my life. I guess it was fate because suddenly, Draco was there, standing in front of me. He just sat down on a barstool next to me and we didn‘t speak for what felt like hours. Then I started to talk and it all spilled out of me, it was like a flood I couldn‘t stop. I didn‘t have to hide my feelings anymore, I didn‘t have to pretend I was something I‘m not and Draco understood. He didn‘t judge me. He told me what it had been like for him, coming out, and it really opened my eyes. We ended up at my place and I had the best sex of my life.“
? He's tired all the time, he claims his muscles hurt as if he‘s been running for hours. He's stubborn so he won‘t go to St Mungo‘s. He says he‘s fine but I know he‘s not. I can see something‘s wrong and it drives me crazy. I need to find out what‘s going on with him, even if he doesn‘t want to tell me. I‘m sure he‘s keeping something from me.“
"As soon as this is over, let's take a week off, let's go somewhere you've never been to but always wanted to visit. I'll follow you anywhere you want me to," Harry whispered and stole a kiss from Draco. Their tongues immediately started dancing against each other in an exciting, yet comforting manner. Draco felt he could get drunk on the sweet taste that was purely Harry and groaned as his cock started to fill in.
Tracey's face went rigid for a second before she hid it with a frown. Draco must have hit the bullseye. "You're a right bastard, Malfoy."
"Alright, here we go," Draco whispered. He seemed alert, his eyes darting back and forth across the courtyard they were standing in. "We go in, and I will scan the temperature in the foyer quickly. Meanwhile, you're going to set up the protective circle near the entrance."
„Of course you did, I was gorgeous back then. I still am,“ Draco stated shamelessly. „Anyway, Pansy will be ecstatic. Blaise might be a bit jealous because he would like nothing more than to fuck you senseless himself. Which is not a compliment, mind you. Blaise would have sex with anything that moves and has two legs. Or four, come to think of it. He actually had sex with a centaur once,“ Draco carried on.
Harry maneuvered him into a sitting position on a bar stool, rubbing his thumb along Draco's spine absentmindedly as he leaned over the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.
Harry had to hold Draco up with all his strength. Draco seemed boneless and if Harry hadn't held him up, he would fall to the floor.
"Now that's brilliant," Draco shouted. "Fucking brilliant, Potter. Your ex-girlfriend, who by the way wants you back, pops by and tells you "Oh, by the way, Malfoy's cheating on you" and you immediately trust her? Over me? I thought you had a higher opinion of me than that."
