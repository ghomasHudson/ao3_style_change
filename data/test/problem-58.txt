"Friendship?" Malfoy and Ron said at the same time, and then they frowned at each other when they realized they spoke at the same time. Harry nodded happily as he took a pumpkin pie.
"And why should I help you?" He asked again, feeling the initial annoyance surge in that moment.
The short answer was all they all needed to know that this was a sensitive topic, and that if they wanted to continue keeping the restored Hogwarts they had, they didn't have to talk about it again. At least not until everything was in order and in a controlled environment.
Draco felt tired, annoyed, annoyed and above all confused… he didn't know why he was there, behind a granite pillar near the door of the infirmary, hidden and afraid that someone would recognize him.
-That's...
"I went out with you because I needed to discover something, to know if I still felt something for you…" He whispered as he caressed her cheek with his pale and cold hand. And sadly, I no longer do.
He regained his courage and approached again, only until the light could shine on him and give him a better view of what was happening at that moment.
"Did you hear me, Draco?" I won't let you go, ever. Harry unwrapped the paper that was right on the stool next to his bed and slowly entered it again, showing him what he had written on it. This is your letter, where you sell your soul to the devil, to me ...
"No," Harry said, shaking his head from side to side. This should not happen this way.
Petunia was silent for a few minutes and Harry waited patiently. In case he refused, he will actually only steal money from his aunt's wallet and arrive with a bus. His aunt's cooperation would certainly make it easier, but her denial wouldn't affect him in the least. Harry is going to Diagon Alley today one way or another.
He thought about the previous days, it was evident that Draco was avoiding him since what happened in the hall that night; To say that he was disappointed by it was not enough because he believed, in his silly Gryffindor naivety, that that moment was the perfect approach to Draco Malfoy, the ideal bridge to start connecting with him, enjoying the union that was beginning to blossom ... but the other On the contrary, it marked a limit that little or nothing could cross.
Chapter Text
Apparently, that was enough for Draco to lower his barrier a lot and relax. His shoulders no longer looked tense, and the annoyed face disappeared to make way for a much calmer one — and he might dare say, slightly flustered.
"I don't have it," Harry shrugged, "but the vault number is 687. If you check whose vault it is, you'll know who I am." However, I would like to speak to a manager, is it possible? I have some questions. Please, ”he added, relieved when the goblin just stared at him and then nodded before leaving. Harry stood still while he waited for the goblin to return.
While we were getting ready, our mums readied the area we had decided on for the party after Haz's ceremony. At the same time, our dads, with the help of a Sebastian, Eliza, and Mac, prepared the circle for the ceremony. We've had almost two years of their cooperation, but it still shocks me when I see Lucius and Arthur working together. They are both utterly devoted to their grandchildren so it shouldn't come as a surprise anymore, but old habits die hard I guess.
Did you ever decide when you’re going over to see Donna? Just curi
I'm glad Siri and Zwei are making use of my running paths. There's nothing that makes for a better night's sleep, for little boys or their puppies, than a day of running through the woods getting all the fresh air they can handle. I am so thankful we decided to raise our family at the Manor. Our kids have acres of beautiful outdoors to explore to their hearts' content. I would have done anything for unlimited space to run and play in. I can't wait to go for a run with my boys, although I feel like I've gained at least a stone since I've been home and I doubt I'll be able to keep up with them for long. Seriously, I thought I had been carrying a small pregnancy bump for once and it seems as if out of nowhere, my sweet Persephone must have had her first massive growth spurt. I bet you barely even recognize me when I get home!
Draco needs something that satisfies his flair for the dramatic, his love of all things beautiful, essentially a way to announce to the world that he's proud to call these men his. Draco's need to go to the extreme is just a symbol of his extreme love.
Why would you put up with that? You should have just snatched me at some point, glared at my tiny marmoset eyes, and then told me to grow the fuck up. I probably would have still bit you, but then maybe I would have actually grown the fuck up, ugh!
I kissed you again. "My wonderful husband has been offered the position of Professor of Muggle Studies and Head of Gryffindor House."
"Alright, how?" Blaise asked with a sniff that let me know he was trying to calm down and pay attention.
Thursday May 20th
Once we were all ready, we sat back on our calves hands on the ground, awaiting instructions. We were told to go play and have fun and we certainly didn't need to be told twice. We may not do this often the way they do, but over the years I've definitely dropped into pupspace enough that it no longer felt odd to start playing. Years ago I would have let out an inelegant squeaky squeal at the idea of Charlie nosing around my bollocks or licking a stripe up my cheek, but now I just did the exact same back to him. I even added a few playful nips to his arse and headbutted his shoulder to tell him it was time to roughhouse.
Ok, I need to take a couple of deep breaths and prepare myself. Our first Unity Kid will be here in about an hour and we're not sure yet what to expect. The Ministry was able to handle the legal end and a small group went to go pick him up an hour ago. They thought my staying back to make sure it was ready and welcoming for when Mackenzie got here would be best so I readied one of the boys' rooms, baked a batch of cookies, and distracted myself emailing you. Don't be surprised if I am late home tonight, I'm not leaving here until little Mac feels comfortable. I'm so happy we've managed to get him out of a crappy situation but it breaks my heart that he was in one in the first place. Well, I knew what I was in for when I signed up for this project. I'm just so glad I'll have you to hold me and stroke my hair when I come home and break down tonight.
"Brilliant! I don't suppose that you'd sing something to him now?" Siobhan asked, looking nearly ready to wet herself from glee.
-	Age 17
Draco's home from St. Mungo's.
Draco
He looked speculative. "So... kiss him but expect him to punch me?"
Oh, the whole thing with River and nudity and shame and etcetera. Here are my feelings on the whole situation. We have taught them that there is no shame in the human body. We have taught them that bodies are not inherently sexual. That being naked either alone, or with someone else, does not have to be sexual in nature. And if we had all been sitting around nude and they had found some place to snog, I probably wouldn't have made a big deal about their nudity. But just because nudity isn't automatically sexual doesn't mean it can't be used sexually. When they made the choice to shed the clothing they were already wearing, for no other purpose than to touch each others bodies in an intimate way, they made it sexual … which is inappropriate due to their ages. I don't know if he will understand why it's not hypocrisy or a double standard, but the reality is they are children who chose to drop their clothing to do sexual acts.
Goodnight love, I hope you slept better than I did,
OH! That muggle science stuff. Not nearly as alarming. At this rate, in order to win against you, I might have to conjure up a super tiny but REAL volcano at the edge of the south lawn, haha. But please don't take that the wrong way. I don't feel I actually need to win or that we are even competing in the first place. It's like Viona (and Eris too, I suppose) in that she clings to me. Well River clings to you, and I'm about 90 percent certain it's because you literally saved him from dying. That's going to leave a permanent mark on him. Believe me, I know...
Okay, I've screamed out my frustrations. I think I'll make the decision this way, when we get there I will say "Alric, this is your room while we're here." And if Viona argues and makes a valid argument I will allow it. But I am hoping he will be so scared of being respectful that he will just stay there and I won't have to deal with the situation at all.
When I was reading all about your Boxing Day adventures Dragon, my mind took off on about a dozen different tangents that I could barely keep up. All of those thoughts led to to today, which was spent in the stables with Oberon .... and the feisty foursome of course. Plus the occasional bigger kid here and there, even having a few hours where Nora Madeline was there brushing all the horses' tails.
"Oh hell no!" Viona denied, pointing at a man standing awkwardly behind Eris. "Get over here and hex this arsehole into next week!"
So, I'm writing this email as the instructor finishes casting all the safety charms and giving them instructions. I already cast all the safety charms, but one can never be too careful. The water is nice and calm and there are no rocks to accidentally land on (I double checked!), so we should be fine. But this little magi-adventure is great because it combines two forms of cliff diving, one in which one uses a flight suit to get a bit of air time, and one in which one jumps into the water and swims a bit before doing it again. SO our kids will be jumping off a cliff, flying with their suit as much as possible, and then landing in the water and swimming until they're ready to do it all over again. This... might last days, if I'm honest.
Draco seemed to understand what Harry was feeling because he smirked and said: “If you finish before you even get started, I'm going to make you suck me off and swallow every last drop!”
I brushed a little of the glass debris out of my hair. "THEY BLOODY WELL ARE!!!"
I can't do this anymore! I'm coming home! Ok, I'm not coming home. But I really want to. It's been a week. An entire week without your arms around me. An entire week waking up alone!
I really did like having the opportunity to catch up with you and tell you all about my crazy week, get you updated on the antics of our crew, and hear about how your week was before the assault.
You laughed at that. "I *told* you I was a tricky bastard."
I don't think I need to tell you how much that all terrified me. I didn't trust him because I wouldn't trust a me who didn't have you in my life. You've allowed me to become the best version of me. He was like an angry mirror being held up proclaiming to everyone what my worst innermost fears were.
He spent weeks reminding him of the way he treated me during my school years. Torturing the poor man … er portrait. And when I acknowledged Bastian as my brother, Snape pretty much lost his mind. Once I got the truth out of him Sunday, and explained in no uncertain terms that Sirius was just messing with his head, and that there was no way he was my biological father, he has spent the entire time since following Sirius no matter where he goes in the Manor singing badly at the top of his lungs the most obnoxious songs he can come up with.
I really should go, my break is just about over and I hear whispering outside my door. I promise I'll be home in time for that family meeting you wanted. We decided on 6 P.M. right? Let me know if I'm wrong and need to be home by a different time.
Harry, this is Oliver, I'm finishing up this email and hitting send, but I'm also about to send you an Insta-owl. You said you had the afternoon off, but you must be lingering with some students, because you haven't returned to our quarters yet. Drop everything and get here this instant! Draco's sobbing hysterically and I don't have time to read his bloody email to figure out why!
Yeah, let's NOT talk about this! Let's return to my new puppy. I know that every time I fall in love with something fast and hard, and go on and on about how much I love that thing, you get super irritated. After all, when I opened my email by telling you that'd I'd fallen in love with Mahafsoun, you mistook that for romantic love rather than a sort of fatherly interest (that was twisted by her unknown Veela traits, I'll admit).
"I did," the girl - a Hufflepuff - replied a bit timidly.
Probably as much as I wanted to cry when you told them that I'd normally love to shake hands and sign autographs. Not cool Draco, why would you say that? I'm going to end up running into some of them on Diagon and have to explain to them that you were being an arse and I don't actually ever sign autographs. To be fair, by the time that happens I am sure they will be well aware you're an arse!
"Well said Oliver. Love forever, Draco and Oliver. Go ahead and send the email now."
But you have been wonderful, giving me all the attention I can stand and not even *hinting* that you're horny as fuck, which I know perfectly well that you are. You've had over a month to heal, so your libido is working just fine. Plus, your magic levels are already almost back to normal, so you've been annoyingly energetic, but that's just part of what makes you the man I married.
We're so overscheduled and under-brained right now it would probably be best to wait. I cannot believe we missed your Grand Opening! I was so looking forward to it! I will have to make it up to you in some way. Some sexy way. Some way the Viper can't even wrap his mind around trying to do. It will be the sexiest thing that has ever happened in the existence of sexiness. It will transcend sexy, we will have to invent some new word for how amazing it is.
Harry pinched his side, and Draco jerked a little and whined, his words slurring, “Leaf me ‘lone, ‘m sleepin’.”
“I know, love, you meant that you weren’t thinking of how our kissing will affect your family’s willingness to be saved by me.” Harry worded for him, cupping his palm around one of those pink cheeks. Draco nodded and turned his head slightly to kiss Harry’s palm.
Harry’s whine interrupted him, “Yes, you are and I know, I’m sorry. I didn’t have anything else that was warm enough to put you in. Why don’t you own any sweaters?” Potter tried to redirect to his fault as if that would distract Draco from actualizing that his poor cashmere cardigan got rubbed, tugged, and stretched all night long!
Draco shuddered, “All clean?”
Draco dropped his hands from his face to flop to his sides, “No. First I climbed to the tallest staircase and debated if throwing myself down them would take care of the issue. Then I had a really sobering moment where I tripped and nearly achieved a speedy, yet painful, flight down the stairs where I decided I was keeping the poor bastard. Worse was the realization I had to tell you. So, I did some good pacing of the grounds, then the rain started, and then I really spiraled mentally. That pretty much sums up my Sunday.” Harry picked up Draco’s hand and was examining for signs of frostbite or hypothermia. Were those beds turning blue or was that the poor lighting. The pads of his fingers were definitely getting wrinkly from the extended exposure to the dampness.
Draco panted into Harry’s mouth, “I’m close.”
“Right,” Harry squeaked. Draco leaned up higher on his knees, bending forward just enough to give Harry full access. Draco couldn’t tell if he imagined it but Harry might have whimpered as he presented himself. He felt goosebumps raise over his skin when the pad of Harry’s finger trailed down his bony spine to right where his cheeks parted. Draco bit his lip to keep from whimpering himself. Harry took the soap to his skin, petting the skin with the towel instead of scrubbing as he had with the rest of his back. Draco prayed his panting wasn’t evident when Harry’s left hand slid down his back and parted his arse cheeks, making Draco’s arsehole completely exposed. Harry’s thumb ghosted over the area, definitely not enough pressure to clean. Draco’s eyes closed, all the blood so effectively residing in his prick that he felt dizzy. His hands gripped the sides of the tub with fevered strength, his knuckles whitening as Harry squeezed the rag over his lower back, sending little rivers down his crack. Harry pressed against the skin above his arsehole a little harder and Draco definitely panted audibly which he took as a partial win over the whine that wanted to squeal out of his throat. He fought himself against pushing back into Harry’s hand to his arsehole that couldn’t help but flex under the attention. After one more pass of trickling water and a ghost of a touch to the puckered hole, Harry’s voice cracked, “All clean.”
“Draco? You good?” Harry asked, the airy drop off in Draco’s speech burrowed into his chest on the back of a worry bug. When he didn’t answer, Harry shook him gently.
“Uh. Well, we weren’t exclusive or anything and I went on that terrible date with Trenton. At first, when I told Draco, so he knew not to expect me home, he seemed cool. He told me to have a good time. But then the next day when I came over, he was all cold and he said that we should end this because it would never go anywhere. He said it would be absolutely mortifying to be seen in public together and who wants to spend their whole life hidden away in a flat drinking wine and eating takeaway,” Harry gritted out his teeth remembering how his heart fell out of his chest, how lost he felt when Draco shoved a miniature box into his hand and pushed him out of the door locking him out of his wards. The now enlarged box still sat untouched full of all the clothes, knick-knacks, toiletries, and his favorite mug that had wandered over to Draco’s.
“Your thoughts?” He whispered back. The muted space between them felt heavy but he appreciated how it held him down and kept him sedated from working himself up into a panic.
“Why don’t you?” Ron challenged as he lowered Draco’s feet into the tub first. Harry gaped at Ron. Where was this coming from? While Harry was glad Ron didn’t seem to still hate Draco, this was more steps forward than Harry expected.
Draco just got whinier, no endurance in sight, “Noo. I just wanna sleep.” Harry huffed with strain and amusement. Draco really had to let him know exactly whar his future was gonna look like. Though if he was really lucky, maybe he won’t ever have to carry a whiny mini Draco up this many bloody steps. Draco had held a grip on Harry's sweater, but Harry could feel it when it slackened slipping down listlessly. The unease in his chest got stronger which was not good for his impromptu cardio workout. He’ll be fine. They’ll be in their room soon. Look to the positives, whatever they may be. Well, he can’t keep bitching if he was asleep, that’s a positive. However, how was Harry going to get the door open? He pondered his options as he stomped up the remaining steps. Settling on waking the princess back up, he turned the corner to the hall with the portrait entrance and spotted Ron standing outside of it, waiting for him with the door open. Bless that redheaded menace.
Draco shook his head with lasting disbelief, face still tucked into Harry’s neck, “How did you know I wouldn’t deck you for kissing me?”
Draco’s face flamed and his mouth went dry at a loss for how to respond. His eyes flicked up in a panic but noticed that the bathroom mirror was angled perfectly for him to see Harry’s face. His face was flushed, eyes zeroed in on the line of mess leading down under the line of water. Draco watched Harry wet his lips and take shallow breaths, want so evident on his face. He felt like he was going to throw up with nervousness about the opportunity presenting itself here. Willing the shake out of voice Draco said, “Well, I won’t be able to see if I got it all if I did it myself.”
Draco whimpered when Harry pressed his thumbs into the base of his skull, “Never stop doing that.”
“Dunk under the water and get your hair wet, and I’ll start on your hair while you scrub your hands,” Harry ordered. Draco nodded and slide under, taking care to keep his body under the water, impressed with the depth Harry put in the tub that allowed him to get his whole body underneath. When he broke back through the surface, he gasped around the water running down his face. He pushed stray hairs away from his face and wiped off his eyes with the hand towel Harry passed him. Harry had to have accioed all of Draco’s soaps and shampoos over to them handing Draco the bar of soap while he poured shampoo into his hands. Draco cringed at the excess as Harry scrubbed it over his head. However, Draco lost all coherent thoughts from the feeling of Harry’s fingers massaging through his gooey locks. Draco leaned into the pressure, his lips falling open just enough for puffs of air to escape as he found heaven in Harry’s hands. His eyes fluttered closed as Harry slid a hand along the side of Draco’s face cupping under his chin gently tipping his head back. “Keep your eyes closed, I’m going to rinse out your hair,” he instructed softly. Draco hummed his assent, sighing again as warm water flowed over his hair directed by Harry’s wand and aided with Harry’s firm fingers scrubbing through. After guiding him to lean his head back up, Harry went in with more shampoo to deeply massaging his scalp and strands.
Draco scoffed and posed a perfectly reasonable question, “Why the fuck do you think you have any reason to be a part of my bath?”
Ron frowned and held the door with one foot, leaning as far forward as he could to look at Draco while keeping it open, “He okay?”
Harry
My Draco,
P.P.S. The gingers, Caelum and Gabriel, are NOT actually adopted. YOU carried both of them! Genetic matches the both of them Darling. Sorry to disappoint.
I mean that; without you, I almost certainly would have gone around the twist the last few days.
"Which is a branch of transfiguration. But I thought to myself, if there's a potion to Transfigure people temporarily into other people, and there's a SPELL that can Transfigure people into animals, then WHY isn't there a potion that can do so too. Oh sure, with the spell, it's a bit more permanent/at will, and actually, once mastered, isn't a spell so much as seriously focused intention - like with Apparation."
Merlin damn it! Now you've yanked me from all of these lovely thoughts to Greg. I'm telling you, he's not invited to our honeymoon, but if you insist on having him at any point, I'll let you have anything and everything because I want to give you everything in the world and make you happy because I can give you so much stuff. But Greg??? Wait a minute, I replaced what your wrote with something weird in my head. Hold on, let me read that again...
"Ooo! Chocolate pudding!" You exclaimed happily and crowded the bed next to me so that you could dip your finger in my (rather large) bowl of pudding and take a taste. "Mmm..." You moaned in pleasure. Then you conjured a spoon and shared my pudding with me. All the while, I was torn between telling you exactly what you were eating, and just never letting you find out.
I wonder if my parents know...
Anyway, once I got to the Leaky, I had to wait a good 20 or 30 minutes for the first person to show up. I didn't have Viona with me since I rushed off and she was off playing with her Aunts and Uncles - and Teddy. So, I decided that it was the perfect time to work on my Memory Camera.
Falling in love with you was pulling off a blindfold; "oh there you are, I've been waiting for you" only to find you'd been there all along,
I have a feeling that doing this by email is just creating an argument where there doesn't need to be one. I have to apologize for writing this rather than just talking to you in person, but as I am still having a lot of fun with Zwei and BabyMetal, I'm not going to be home for a while yet. Although I DID already subtly order Muffy to go pick up some BJ's for you.
So, she came to the conclusion that the fact that I am still craving blood despite the fact that the potion made from your blood is doing its job and all the OTHER potions are doing their jobs and I'm doing well enough to be allowed out of bed when I feel up to it - well, I DO have PICA. I'm simply craving an unusual substance. And she thinks that maybe this particular craving might be an unconscious fear that my babies won't get all the nutrients they need, even though I logically know that they are.
It all became a blur at some point, and so, while I feel I did well over all, I can't point to anything in specific that was clearly in my favor. Nor was anything clearly against me. Honestly, I think Hermione held their hearts from the beginning - being a Hero of the War and all.
You're the only one having to compromise? You? I know we each have our own perspective, I know we all see things from our own point of view. But honestly? I can see where you've compromised. I can see where you've made sacrifices or altered your personal wants to keep the peace. But you truly can't see where ... and you know what? I am going to leave Oliver out of this because he can speak for himself. I will not put words in his mouth. But you truly can't see where I have made compromises?
He cut me off by shaking my head. "No, I know. You didn't mean to imply that I was a rotten husband because I'm already moving on from my husband's death. But... part of me can't help but feel that way."
So... now all we have to do is wait until they can identify her... or not. In which case, you'll be able to take her back to England the moment the transfer papers are signed by the person in charge of Unity France and Unity England - which, correct me if I'm wrong, but we have both of those people in bed right here as I type this email. You and Oliver are playing with little Nora, and I am documenting it via email because I think THREE men fussing over her at the same time might be a bit overwhelming.
I'm going to go start researching fun places to visit while we're there so I can put together a full itinerary! There's something so great about having a moment by moment itinerary that we end up completely ignoring.
She seems to like it here, but I bet she'll change her mind once winter sets in, haha. I've filled her little area with a flock of chickens to hunt, but it's part of the North Fields, and so, she'll have other things in here to hunt too. But I have to admit that she seems to prefer me to feed her. I KNOW she's a wild animal and not tame even though she tolerates me/us, but I really do think she's Slytherin to her core in the belief that she shouldn't have to do anything she can get someone else to do for her, hahaha.
When you were full, you rested your head on my shoulder and just listened as we discussed everything that needed to be discussed. I mostly took notes so that I could not only remember the important parts, but also make a list of things that will need to be done, and then delegate it to them because there's no way in Salazar's sweaty arse that *I'm* going to do all the work when I have a team of people to do it for me. Er, you actually, but you know what I mean.
Shortly thereafter, one of the guards at Azkaban accidentally stabbed Macnair to death and - after a couple of months had passed, his skull was sent to me. Around the same time, I received a second skull and a note telling me that Dolohov was not as clever at hiding from the Ministry as he thought (he apparently tried to hide in Russia and join the Stregge). The skulls are in my closet - each in boxes so that they don't stare at me while I'm getting dressed. That said, I did actually do a strip tease for them and play with myself while asking them if the little bit of pleasure they got from me was worth dying for.
I luckily sobered up before bed and had a hangover potion ready to go just in case for this morning. I didn't need it. But that might be because for the second night in a row, I barely slept because I was so stressed out from the previous day's drama. I have a feeling I'm going to need to fly tonight if I have any hopes of getting a full night's sleep. Unless this was all a terrible dream and I will wake up well rested with a non-pregnant Farrah. Yeah?
(See the end of the chapter for
Oddly enough, unlike Kamchatka on the very eastern part of Russia, which is 11 hours ahead of us, St. Petersburg (where Pansy lives) is only two hours ahead. So, we'll arrive there at about 7 or so and can decide if we want to stay just a few hours before returning home, or if Pansy wants or needs us to spend the night and stay longer. I know she'll probably WANT us there longer, but new parents tire easily and it just may not be feasible. I understand that.
I smiled at her. "Good, then you'll be able to teach the others how to use them if necessary."
P.P.S. This isn't one of those cases of … accidentally taking a headache potion in an attempt to beat your parents at the children game right?
So, of course, practically the *moment* you fell asleep, I seemed to catch a second wind - which I used to write this. I have a feeling it's going to be a lethargic and lazy Sunday for the both of us, haha.
Again, your father has come so far in recent years, "Oh... that's alright then, I just didn't know. As long as you're happy, you know I'm pleased for you."
Harry
With all of our early bedtimes, we managed to have everyone awake, fed, and mostly happy earlier than I think our family has ever been ready. You were up in time to have breakfast … at breakfast time! Which gave us plenty of time to get everyone squeaky clean and have all of our preplanned outfits ready for when Julia showed up.
"Good," I stated, standing up and helping her to her feet. "Let's start by getting you a sandwich or something."
He shook his head. "No! I never make less than 200 euros a night just giving head, so it's RARE for me to even consider shagging for money, but there's just something about you. I feel like a moth while you are the warmest yet coolest flame ever - and I'd REALLY like to stop telling the truth now, please!"
I'm dead certain the security officers had no idea what to do at this point. They didn't seem to want to intervene, and yet, clearly needed to regain some semblance of order. One attempted to ask us all to calm down, but was snarled at by everyone on both sides.
I should go head back to the group, most of the kids out there are ours and not actually Unity Kids, I probably need to be at least a little helpful!
Draco
Poor Padfoot, maybe Viper should come back over and give him a good seeing to. Hey Oliver! It's a shame that you never got to - well not see exactly as neither of us watched it or anything, but a long time ago, Harry once walked in on Viper shagging Padfoot and he needed to be obliviated - which he obviously wasn't, but you know the feeling.
The second half was just about to begin.
I was just showing your daddy my computer, because even though I've shown it to him before, he couldn't remember much. And then "ding!" I got an email from you. It was lovely. You're lovely. I am the proudest of husbands.
Yours,
You know how you suggested that I should come up with an anniversary to celebrate with just Oliver? Well I think that will be today: The day that Oliver FINALLY accepted that the two of us have a solid relationship that is every bit as equal and loving as the one I have with you - or the one you have with him, for that matter. I saw it in him when things just... clicked. It was like a huge burden was lifted off his shoulders and he suddenly realized that he was free.
Harry shrugged his free shoulder and grinned, “Just went for it. Hoped Luck was on my side.” Draco pulled his head back looking at Harry like he grew an extra head.
There was nothing like spending your Saturday morning in a potions lab trying to complete a partnered project with the Golden Boy himself who has volunteered to be his personal bodyguard, roommate, class partner, and overall pain in the arse by the way of golden retriever antics spiced up with a mouth that could parry sass and sarcasm against Draco with frustrating ease. Currently, said arse pain was supposed to be returning the first round of ingredients and bringing forth the next, but apparently said task could not be done without a running commentary. Draco rolled his eyes as he measured out Dragon Star seed powder. Precision was key but letting Harry call him a pointy potions prat without the retort remarking on Harry being a dumb speckled git was just unreasonable. He flicked his eyes up, ready to lay out his lovely reprisal when he bore witness Harry bent over digging around in the ingredient cupboard. Those stupid, frankly criminal, grey joggers that he insisted on wearing on the weekend practically no matter what, hugged his arse so damn well. Getting an eyeful, Draco craved to walk up to that arse and slid his hand over one globe and grip, just see how much he could squeeze in one hand. Was it soft like the bottoms suggest or was it tight from the hard work Harry put into his body for
Draco gave him a sickly smile, “Worried I’m a Death Eater?”
Harry folded his arms and stared down at Draco, “You’re going to get hypothermia.”
“And what sort of competitor would I be if I gave them up?” Draco taunted though weakened by the breathy end from the glide of Harry’s cock moving in and out of him. He moved so slowly it was nothing but a tease winding him up so tautly but not enough to snap delightfully. Draco wrapped his foot around Harry’s waist and used his heel to spur him on, “Pick up the pace, Potter. Flobberworms fuck faster than you.”
Until, “So, he is your boyfriend…” Ron smirked though keeping his eyes turned away from Harry and Draco.
Harry scoffed, “There’s no way you could sleep more. You got like 18 hours of knock-out sleep!”
That wiped the mirth from Ron’s face right quick, “You want me to help you get Draco naked?!” Where was this prude ‘tude coming from? Three bros in a bathroom can’t be worse than months in a tent with your best bro and your crush.
Harry shrugged his one shoulder free of Draco, “Apparently.”
Draco discarded his smugness for pouting, “No! I can’t! I have a confession to make and I haven’t figured out how to tell you yet and I won’t be coming in until I do. So, either leave me here or join me.” Harry’s heart rate spiked, always on hand to jump to the worst possibilities at a moments notice. What could Draco possibly confess that warranted a penance through nature’s baptismal? He hadn’t committed a crime or even insulted anyone’s blood status since the end of the war. So, what did he do? There was no way he’d be able to leave Draco here to get hypothermia and die leaving Harry without answers.
“May I kiss you again?” If the first kiss was Harry’s confession, the so slight nod was Draco’s. He nodded with such a minute movement into Harry’s palm that he could deny it if Harry were to take it back, but his eyes were already narrowed onto Harry’s lips while his tongue peeked out to wet his lower lip. Harry was unable to contain the smile that bloomed on his face as he brought their faces back together in a kiss. This time Draco reciprocated the kiss and brought his hands to Harry’s neck and waist. Harry had felt warm from the Liquid Luck, but that compared not at all to the floodgates of pleased happiness flushing Harry’s body from Draco’s kiss. It was a crackling fire in his veins when Draco’s tongue tasted his bottom lip and slipped into his mouth to dance with his. Harry’s hand that was cupping Draco’s face slid back to hold the back of his head, his fingers carded through Draco’s hair. Harry pulled Draco’s bottom lip between both of his and sucked, savoring the little whimper from Draco. He wasn’t close enough and Draco seemed to agree, shifting forward when Harry grabbed his hip to pull him over his lap. However, as soon as Draco’s leg settled over Harry’s hips, effectively straddling him, Harry’s wand fell from the ledge and clattered to the floor below. The echoed clacking startled the boys, their bodies flailing as teetered on the ledge. Harry barely caught the edge with one hand and ridged grip with his legs to straightened them out before they followed the wand. Harry’s other arm was secured around Draco’s waist possessively and protectively holding him to his chest. Draco’s muscles remained taut as he frantically looked and listened for anyone’s approach. As soon as Draco realized they were still alone, the tension seeped out of him and he sagged dropping his head to Harry’s shoulder and huffing a large sigh followed by a smattering of unbelieving laughs. Harry rubbed his hand up and down Draco’s back, chuckling along with him as his own heartbeat returned to normal.
Harry
"Me too, love, me too," Mum muttered, hugging me tighter for a moment. "I'd also probably adopt them all, just because they deserve to be raised in wealth and comfort, but I... just can't. Barring any other unforeseen illegitimate children popping up, I'm at my limit. Della and Sebastian - and you - were more than enough for me, and now I have two more. It's an exercise in patience and endurance and my capacity to love. I'm honestly afraid I can't do it."
And dinner with our circle was fantastic! When we first got together, and planned for the wedding, it was definitely a "yours" and "mine" situation with our friends. But we've been married for less than six months and already they are our friends, and most of them are friends with each other! Sometimes I think they should tone it down a bit! Ron and Blaise were heckling me about how fat I've gotten (do you think I'm too fat?) and I had to threaten them with stocking their cabinets with headache potions that are just a bit "off." I have joked in the past about going back in time and reassuring little Harry that he would have a great life, but I can't imagine being able to convince him that some day Blaise and Ron would be dating, in a triad with Hermione, and would heckle me because I am so heavily pregnant with Draco Malfoy's baby. I think his brain would short circuit.
I must have made a whimpering noise because you gave me your "oi my silly puppy is so cute" smirk and told Rowe we'd most definitely like to hear it. She gave me a very similar "oi Harry is so cute" face and proceeded to project the heartbeat. Oh Merlin, it sounded perfect. Absolute perfection, tiny and wonderful, healthy and strong, and so so fast. I had forgotten how fast their little hearts beat.
Harry
You are my world Draco Malfoy.
Love and passion,
Draco
Healer Rowe thinks I was feeling my power drain, although she has no bloody idea why I registered it as a good feeling. She would have thought it would feel unpleasant. In any case, yes, I ended up wasting so much of my magic that my body couldn't cope. I am now on the strictest restrictions possible. And bed rest.
Alright, so, as you know, Sebastian and I had recently brewed a bunch of potions to possibly fix werewolves. Those particular potions wouldn't be observable until the next full moon. Pansy worked with Laila Marley to document the volunteers, and they decided that the potions were more than likely a one moon at a time fix - as opposed to a permanent fix. You know, if they worked at all.
I chuckled and added: "And besides, if Viona wants a manicure and pedicure, I'd simply get one too. What? Did you think that I can't have my nails done simply because I am a man?"
So I completely understand what you were thinking and feeling. More importantly, if you're revisiting that place in your mind so much that you're still out running, then I'm going to catch up with you and run by your side until you feel better.
You were so fucking sexy, crawling across the expanse of floor, climbing over Oliver to place your head in my lap, your thighs across his, and your gorgeous arse right in the middle where we could both easily reach. And reach we did. First I spelled off those pants. You looked so fit, but I wanted to see all that pale smooth skin before I reddened it. Without any warning, I gave a sharp smack to your left arse cheek. Oooh, it was already pinking up so prettily. Probably because even the first spank was a full strength spank. I gestured to Oliver that it was his turn to land a spank on you, he decided to start on the other cheek.
Since I've come … home? I obviously haven't remembered anything. I am getting pieces of you in my dreams. And then I had that one scary dream. But other than that, it's like I'm being introduced to a life I don't know anything about. But every place we've gone I've either felt nothing, or twinges of Deja Vu. Like – for example – the muggle restaurant we went to in London just felt like eating at a restaurant. It was eating at a restaurant on a date with a ridiculously fit man that I want to do dirty things to, but it didn't feel like anything I was almost remembering.
"Aww," younger sister purred again, staring at us with big watery eyes and her hands clasped over her heart. "I seriously hope I find someone someday that looks at me the way you two look at each other."
Age 13
Draco
Anyway, my hard limits ... scat, watersports, body-mod, mummification, the list goes on as to things I don't want. Why aren't you upset at me limiting things?
Harry feels like he hasn't seen Draco all day, and Draco is rushing around trying to get things done.
After getting a good hug or two in, I felt so overwhelmingly in love with you and everything in my life that I pulled you into my arms, kissed you rather possessively, and then sang a happy and cheery song:
Well, I am off to go play with my horses!
I smiled. "Well in that case..." Taking the lead, I danced our mental bodies around a vivid representation of what I imagine the very core of Magic Itself looks like. A sort of gorgeous, swirling, colorful jumble of - I dunno - stars and spells like fireworks, or something.
My Love and My Love,
Honoko closed her eyes and whispered: "His birthday was two days ago..."
No one snagged Serenity from Ollie and I. She was weirdly fussy today. It's probably the longest I've seen her awake in her life. She wanted to nurse near constantly and if Ollie wasn't feeding her then she wanted to be rocked and walked. If my biggest issue is my teeniest baby wanting lots and lots of cuddles? I am the luckiest Daddy in the world!
When we were done, the rest of our circle clapped, which wasn't necessary, but pleasing nonetheless. You apparently couldn't contain yourself any longer because you came over and leapt on me - wrapping your legs around my waist - so that you could snog me quite passionately.
"Oi! What are you looking at? I'M your opponent, now shape up and bloody fight me before I kick your arse so hard you end up in St. Mungo's!"
Age 15
My Dragon,
Or maybe I'm awkward. Do you think it's me? Do I attract weirdos?
He's supposed to arrive on Sunday so that he can start his job on Monday. I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and told Greg to find a spot to build him a flat of sorts. Greg seemed undecided between building a cottage on Unity Grounds but a little secluded if possible, and simply adding another floor to Unity House so that at least the one flat could be built, but also, it seems like there might be a need for storage rooms and perhaps even another dorm to use during times when you have more Kids than usual. So... I'm sure he'll probably come hunt you down and discuss the options with you sooner rather than later.
Viper allowed his Polyjuice to wear off during the interrogation, but Tommy and Bellerophon maintained their disguise so that if any of the Aurors happened to be members of that group that once repeatedly tried to kill them, their identities were safe.
So, noon to six was dedicated to the first party, with an hour or so 'break' in between to give people who were leaving time to gather up their things and say good bye. Plus, give all the kids time to finalize which Grandparents or Godparents they were going home with. Viona actually insisted on going home with her Greg, which I still find adorable after all these years.
"So?!"
With that set, he can use the rest of the time that he's in our universe to go through them individually when he's got some spare time. That said, we came out of his mind feeling refreshed. And HUNGRY!
My perfect men,
So, you know how ... um. Ok, here's the thing. Well, would it bother you.
Oh. So am I right in assuming this is the nonsense you all have to deal with when we're less than twenty-four hours away from a gala with my name on it? I apologize. I can't promise I won't do it again, and I don't think you'd believe that promise anyway, but I am sorry.
I don't think I noticed right away, and then when I did notice, I held my breath for a long moment or seven. It took me an eternity to accept the fact that I wasn't just not hearing things, but then I cast a spell to confirm what I already knew in my heart. Actually, I probably didn't even need the spell, because Venus (who normally avoids me like the plague if she can help it) started crying softly. She came over and repeatedly nudged Amala's face while making the softest noise that was not a purr. That's how I knew she was crying.
No, I'm Sirius. Shut up Sirius! Now is not the time! Read the room before you make a joke.
Draco
"Maybe it was Edmond's fault. He was an only child, so obviously his parents - who are dead set on heirs - were only able to have the one child. Maybe infertility ran in his family. Maybe, maybe, maybe.
P.P.P.S. Harry, I'm pretty sure I have gone literally and certifiably insane because I realized that my parents now officially have more kids than we do, and this seems like a sort of challenge that we definitely should not lose! Erm... I might need you to smack some sense into me.
Squaring my shoulders and preparing to use all my best insults on him (actually it was a group of men between the ages of 18-25), I was surprised that I didn't even get a chance.
"Hey now! I'm not bad myself!" Ron protested, puffing up a bit like a peacock.
I do suppose the rage monster might be appeased by you casting some covert STD spells at her. She doesn't deserve death (shut up rage monster, she doesn't deserve death) but a healthy dose of Herpes with a side order of Crabs might be just the ticket. Maybe a little gonorrhea? I don't even know what that one does, but it's a fun word.
Ananda shook her head. "Nope. They were whispering and giggling and purposely left the room separately, sneakily, but BOTH of them went upstairs, and so, it's not hard to deduce that they are up there together."
Task two! Josette's thirst to prove herself and her inflated ego from France being in charge of designing this task could have been a liability. Instead it was fuel for her victory. I do have to wonder if the French officials designed it specifically with her in mind. She swam like she was born in the water. Similar to our Vivi come to think of it.
You are probably right about the Occlumency versus Legilimency. I excelled at Occlumency because it was part of my upbringing to hide certain things. I'm sure you probably noticed this already, but even while we were at school, I almost never let anyone know when I was in actual pain unless it was to my benefit somehow, and then I made a scene out of it and milked it for every knut it was worth. Thus, Occlumency came naturally to me. I also *love* secrets, so I suppose that Legilimency came fairly easily to me too. That said, I can see how you are intuitive to emotions and would excel in Legilimency.
Harry shook his head with sorrow, “I know you are. I’m worried because it clearly doesn’t agree with you.” Anyone paying even half the amount of attention Harry gave Draco could see that.
Harry quickly dissolved into matching guffaws, “I think we just made a lot of people richer and others poorer.” Harry bowed his face into Draco’s neck and pressed a kiss to the skin, “God, Draco, that was…” Draco extended his neck soliciting for more neck kisses which he was rewarded. He hummed with happiness as he felt the edges of Harry’s smile in every kiss.
Draco opened one eye at Harry, his hand coming up to block the rain and Draco frowned, “Who said you have any sins in the first place?”
“Well, I’m open to anything. Which would you like to do first?” He teased with a squeeze to Harry’s biceps. Harry plastered his lips to Draco’s. He nipped at Draco’s bottom lip until he opened his mouth to him. They kissed deeply while Harry pushed their clothed cocks against each other. Not rutting, just pressing the idea into each other. Harry backed off, leaving them both panting. Draco’s now swollen lips peeled back into a grin, “Mmm, good choice.”
“Well, that’s not very romantic,” Draco griped. “Thought you’d be better at being a knight in shining armor with your Savior Complex.”
Draco gasped arching his chest up into Harry’s mouth. Harry had bought his beautiful lips around one of Draco’s puffy nipples and sucked. And now Draco was seeing stars while blinking up at the ceiling. Pleasure and pain zinged through his body with a new intensity. Harry popped off graciously letting Draco catch his breath and releasing his wrists. Draco let his arms fall wherever they did as he looked down at Harry’s smirking face. Harry brought a hand up ghosting his thumb over the other nipple his grin turning salacious when Draco keened, the sharp noise slipping out from the shocked bliss of the tease. “I had wondered if these were more sensitive now.”
Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder and smirked, “So, are you going to go get him out of the rain before he gets sick, or is he not your boyfriend?” Harry didn’t honor that with a reply, solely turning on his heel and leaving Ron behind. Well, he tried to leave Ron. The smug arsehole was trotting down the stairs behind him. When they broke into the common area and Harry was marching his way through it, someone asked where Harry was going in such a hurry. Ron took the pleasure of answering, with enough of a sing-song to his voice to almost get Harry to pause his march to turn around and flick him in the ball sack, “Going to get his boyfriend.”
Harry, never stop looking for me.
He had the same arrogant look, with that unique glow that only caused him to surrender at his feet, how would it feel if he pronounced his name with that impetus that characterized him? What would it be like to submit to his whims again, to indulge that indomitable spirit that he loved so much?
Soon, he felt the tingling in his abdomen, the one that told him in a hurry that he would ejaculate at any moment; He decided to let himself be carried away by the evident orgasm he would feel and surrendered to the intensity of the sensations that plummeted over him.
"Case solved," McGonagall said, walking toward the exit, urging the others to follow. I need to take you to the dungeons and introduce you to your head of house, get you more uniforms, and order your school schedules so you can work on doing your portkey again . It will be a problem to be able to distinguish yourself from the other you ...
But he didn't care. And yet it was too late.
"What happened to the thing about me leaving you alone?" Harry's voice was serious, but not incriminating.
"Did you really think I was commendable enough to cross dimensions just for helping others?" Draco nodded a little, for he truly believed that. It's what the Harry of his world has done since he was eleven years old. No, Draco… I'm not stupid or a Gryffindor enough to risk my life for worlds other than my own.
And he was determined to do what, from the beginning, he should have done.
On the other hand, Draco was surprised by the outcome of the events. It was strange how, the day he was least expecting some approach from the Harry of his world, was when it happened, and boy! His legs became a jelly-like mass the more Harry insisted on savoring his mouth as if it were the elixir Felix felicis ; He closed his eyes and tried to keep up with the kiss, biting the lips he had raved about for a long time.
"Surprising, you were early, even before me," Draco said, breaking Harry's scan, and although his voice sounded confident, he could see his hands shaking slightly; I was nervous.
"I don't know ... but it is clear that we cannot continue arguing about that."
Over time he confirmed that Hermione was a very intelligent witch. He had topics of conversation — on an intellectual and magical level — that he didn't find very often, not even with people from his own house; That, together with her arrogance, typical of the title that gave her " The most outstanding witch of her generation ", made the moments they had to spend together enjoyable. Although not enough to, perhaps, continue with that strange truce once they finished that task that McGonagall vehemently entrusted to them.
"Oh, Hogwarts, then, freshman?" Harry nodded looking relieved and Tom smiled slightly at him, though he was still a bit wary. Similarly, where are your parents?
But Hedwig was his smart girl. Maybe if he told her to stay at Hogwarts ...?
He felt his heart beat again.
Because time kept ticking by, and that afternoon, after months, he and Hermione finished helping Harry Slytherin with the diary.
Shortly after the battle, after a hot dinner and a bitter toast of victory, Harry locked himself in the books in the forbidden section of the school. The only way not to go crazy, he thought, was to distract his mind with what connected him to his lost person. Books were always Malfoy's favorites - much to his regret and jealousy - because if Draco found an interesting piece of writing, he would forget the whole world, even himself.
And much less for him.
Chapter Text
And maybe no longer wake up.
What about Snape and his mother's friendship? He didn't have the best image of Snape formed in his head, but he did have his mother's, based on everything he was told (which was all he had of her, and it wasn't even as much as his father's), and he could tell that his mother was a real gift. She was friends with Snape long before Hogwarts, and they seemed to appreciate each other very much. People change, okay, but apparently Snape's loyalty to his mother was always real and steadfast, despite everything, and isn't that a point, small or not, to give the potionist?
At least in this life.
Arriving at the entrance to the Slytherin common room, Harry stopped behind a post, waiting for Draco to mention the password for the week so that he could approach him inside his house; It would give him the advantage of engaging in conversation on his turf, but all on his terms. After all, he would facilitate that first contact.
"But it wasn't your fault, almost immediately Draco found the snitch and caught it." Hermione put on her conciliatory voice, and scowled at Ron, who just shrugged his shoulders.
The Harry Slytherin just smiled, again, that contemptuous grin.
He began to follow him, very slowly and at a safe distance so as not to be seen or perceived. It was fortunate that all the students were together in the great hall; That way, he wouldn't have to deprive himself of talking to Draco and exchanging some more furtive glances.
"So you agree?" Hermione asked and Draco was truly intrigued as to what they were talking about, or what was this secret that Harry had told them.
If heaven existed, Draco knew he was touching it right now.
-I have to go.
"Really… you don't give way without profit in return," Pansy replied, without losing the grace of an ambitious girl. Rest assured that you will have them tonight in the common room.
To the.
- Go to where is my home -.
When he saw Voldemort's body completely dissolve and the wind carried the ashes away, Harry ran alongside Draco's evicted body. His face looked gray, stiff, wrinkled ... very contrary to the indescribable beauty of who had become his platonic love. Narcissa, from what she knew, passed away confronting Bellatrix. Lucius stood next to him, simply staring at his son's lifeless body with a pained face.
"And what did you write?"
Eventually he returned to Hogwarts, very determined to, for once, be selfish and think of no one but himself; to break through and be direct with Draco, tell him that he saw him, that he felt something for him and wanted to know with him what it was about. But they barely got through the day of house selection and the whole school made a stir when they saw him walking through the halls.
Notes:
If Harry hated anything more than herbology classes, it was learning of the fantastic quantum existence of alternate universes to his own. And what better, that in each one of them - or at least in the majority -, a version of him inhabited.
"That could be a trap, right?" Ron said looking at the Harry from his world and the other Harry; he looked more confident, daring, with total ambition and control of his emotions. All a perfect Slytherin like the colors of his tie.
"Is the interrogation over?" Draco was looking at Harry with those silver eyes that reflected genuine concern for him. It was not normal for a conversation between them to be more than two dialogues before moving on to the exchange of unnecessary magic.
And the most obnoxious of all, was Harry Potter.
He felt himself falling, but he felt no pain. He felt like he was in a boat, so to speak, only the water was beginning to drown him more and more and more, and he felt his lungs melt and his heart begin to beat slower and slower, working to keep the blood going. circulating in vain. All Harry was melting, as he fell like rain in a storm
It was on a Thursday, two months after the war, that Harry felt an emotion beyond melancholy. The book he picked up for that afternoon was blue and thick paste, the pages seemed to have been treated with feathers, as they were not worn or strange colors, and he could still make out the title of the same engraving with gold right in the center of the cover .
It was relief , it tasted like tranquility .
Harry blinks to shake off the thought, but he gets it.
"Good night, Potter."
-Can I sit with you? The rest is full. ”Ron's voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he saw the redhead standing in the compartment door, glaring at him shyly. Only then did he realize that the train had already left. Harry smiled at him and pointed to the seat in front of him.
For some reason, it gave him mixed feelings; On the one hand, they got the newspaper they worked hard day and night for the last few months to fully work. On the other hand ... he felt his heart clench with despair at the resounding certainty that Harry Slytherin could leave as soon as McGonagall was told.
Dark chocolate kisses.
It's simple; It all begins with things as simple as being able to be, at least a little closer to that person who is the object of your most intrinsic desires, enjoying their very presence and then, that evolves by witnessing how perfect it can be even with its imperfections And eventually, you are grateful to have met him. But suddenly, everything you knew changes.
"Okay, it won't be a long conversation." By the way, this is Ron Weasley. Ron, this is Draco Malfoy— Malfoy sat next to him on the seat, albeit leaving a considerable space between them, and looked at Ron like someone looking at trash; Ron, in turn, was holding back a laugh at Malfoy's name.
For five damn minutes. Counted.
In addition, he took the opportunity to tell him how the diary worked once it was finished. He wanted to share with Draco, everything that was essential in his life, and that gadget that led to him was one of the most special. Soon, Draco fell asleep in his bed, consumed perhaps by the ravages of stress and the little rest he had seen him take; She made him comfortable on her bed, sheltering him in the silk sheets she had and sat close to him, as much as she could so as not to disturb his sleep, now that she managed to get it.
"But that's stupid," Harry said, frowning. I think it is impossible for a complete pureblood to marry another complete pureblood. From what I read, there are few pureblood families left ...
Fear .
"Potter sucks."
The smell of lavender incense relaxed him, and that was when he remembered that he was playing a Quidditch match, checked himself, and was even still wearing part of his sports uniform, except for the arm and leg protectors.
And little by little, a cold war against Slytherin began on the part of the other houses; more specifically against Draco Malfoy. They whispered hurtful words to provoke him, sometimes they hid their things from him and even, very covertly and on rare occasions, they had the audacity to push him or put his foot on him so that he would trip.
There were even times when he got chills.
Kisses of bread with honey.
Draco watched Pansy disappear down the library hall. They were the only ones he had left in the whole place with whom he could have a decent conversation, something where they exchanged ideas, ironies, criticism, complicity… they were the only ones whom he could consider friends. He also had his few Quidditch teammates, with whom he trained and enjoyed one of his favorite activities in the world.
"That's where you're wrong." Harry smiled coldly at both of them, even though Malfoy seemed to want to get out of there. The man who betrayed my parents, giving the information of where we were hiding, was a Gryffindor— Harry crossed his arms and controlled his magic. That same man was with them at the time, and Harry's magic wanted to kill him. And when he looked out at the landscape, ending the conversation, Harry thought that the bravest man he ever knew was a Slytherin.
"What do you mean?" Ron asked sharply, and Malfoy snorted derisively.
One thing was for sure.
He must not give up. He didn't do so much to fold his arms over something so simple.
The sun was beginning to set and the light in the streets was slowly disappearing. The curfew would come soon; Harry didn't want to have problems with McGonagall, much less that Draco had them after all he did to be okay with the headmistress, so he chose to pay the bill and leave the premises for the castle. On the way, Harry saw the other shrink a bit from the cold that was left of the winter and did not hesitate to offer him his sweatshirt; he saw Draco hesitate a bit, but allowed him to place it on his shoulders and thanked him with a nod of his head.
Harry smirked. The answer was so obvious that it was absurd, but perhaps, it was worth clarifying to Draco how the situation was inside him, exposing himself a little - again - to let the other know his feelings in other words to properly convey his message. He got up from his bed and decided to approach the other, knelt down and raised his hand, until it rested on Draco's neck, feeling the texture of the skin in that area, and allowing himself to be enveloped by the warmth that emanated.
Draco could feel a certain tension building around him as the presence - and existence - of another Harry Potter besides himself surfaced; which was very rare.
Harry Slytherin smiled. Apparently in this universe, Professor McGonagall was smarter than the one in her world.
"Yeah, well, here I am." Draco looked impatient, looking everywhere except at him. Where will we go?
A neat and elegant black outfit and over it, a cape with the crest of the Slytherin house on his chest.
Again, Harry was confused.
He didn't want to think about it too much, otherwise his train of thought would lead to a conclusion that was, to say the least, improbable and impossible.
Blurred and confused scenes came to his mind, the sour memory of watching Slytherin score point after point thanks to his team's Harry, the worry of not being able to find the snitch, the helplessness when he was distracted every time he listened like the other team. they celebrated.
"And now" Harry smiled at the two children and spread his arms, as he had seen Dumbledore do a hundred times, "let's celebrate this new friendship!"
Chapter 2 : How to Make Friends (by Harry Potter).
"Did I kill Voldemort?" Harry shook his head, ignoring Ron's pallor. I do not remember.
Harry was stunned at Draco's words, and felt a pop that was born in his abdomen.
Draco couldn't process the information he was hearing, he was totally skeptical when Harry — the one from his world — entered the common room and saw him next to his double. He thought it was a hoax, that one of them was using Polyjuice Potion and it was all a joke. But when the Harry wearing the Slytherin crest approached him and said that he would gladly answer all his questions in front of the school principal, he had to give some credit to what he saw.
Draco couldn't answer anything, and instead, he stumbled off his bed and grabbed the first change of clothes he found in his closet, walked to the bathroom and slammed the door.
He remembered when he caught Draco with the piece of journal sheet he had, and was elated to discover what it contained.
Even Hermione told him that Draco's room was the other Harry's temporary room.
(See the end of the chapter for notes .)
Chapter Text
Chapter warnings; Contains explicit Lime.
He was just Harry Potter, The Greatest Seeker in Quidditch, The Boy Who Lived Twice, Renegade of Blood — a title he earned by being the first Potter not to attend Gryffindor.
He ran like a maniac, almost tripping over his own feet. As he got close to the library doors, he saw Draco's silhouette walking in the distance towards the dungeons; for a second, his soul was calmed, more altered again when he remembered that he had not seen him eat since the afternoon snack.
Although not for everyone.
And if there was one thing a Gryffindor with a Slytherin soul wouldn't reject, it was a challenge.
You want him for yourself. It does not matter to transgress the laws of time and space ... that is only a small and vain limitation in terms of the love you feel for him.
It was a wound that burned inside; like the bitter taste of defeat, but as deep as skin that is lacerated by the fire of a curse.
Time was just a concept that lost its value to them when they were together. The timelessness in which they coexisted was just a product of the magic that seemed to glow between their bodies.
Was Draco berating him for not saying goodbye to him?
"Why do I have to share a room?" —He questioned more angrily, it really was an invasion of other people's property all that.
And so, after a frankly awkward car ride to the Leaky Cauldron, Harry walked over to the Leaky Cauldron counter and waited patiently for his turn, a little surprised at how many people there were, though after some thought, he remembered that It was the same the ... first time he came. This time, luckily, Hagrid is not screaming his name, his hair was covering his scar very well, and not many people in the place are interested in seeing a child alone in that kind of bar, besides ... Yes, there is the devil's turban. He stopped the weary sigh that almost came out of him and smiled sheepishly as Tom approached.
Then, after verifying - too many times - that he had actually returned to his ten-year-old body, a few days after he turned eleven, Harry began to think about what kind of dictator hated by the whole universe he was in his old life as not to be able to die. Okay, he wasn't suicidal, he swears, but it was funny.
Not to mention that, even though he was a little shorter, the Harry Potter in front of him had a stocky, worked body ... as if he were the fruit of a lifetime of hard labor.
Draco ... never did anything. He neither cast spells, nor insulted them, nor did he cast murderous looks.
He didn't say anything on entering, knowing that Mr. Ollivander liked dramatic entrances, so he just waited ...
Harry smirked. He was sure of exactly what they would do from there.
"You could, Mr. Weasley." McGonagall maintained the serenity that characterized her so much. But since I poured some of the truth potion into the tea I offered you just moments ago, it could mean that there is some reason in his words.
Neither of them noticed the silhouette at the foot of the castle that witnessed the last act of affection between them.
"What we can know is that you shouldn't be here." McGonagall's voice was serious, and at no point did she lower the wand that pointed every so often at the other Harry. How do we return you to your world?
It was not something sudden, rather, it was a gradual transition; as if the fruit of something he had tried to deny for a long time emerged in him. Yet it felt as natural as breathing.
"I see so much talent in you, and although I have not assigned you a house in the past, I know that you undoubtedly belong to ..." The hat saved a second and continued: "Slytherin."
"Draco is mine."
. x. x. x.
"Aren't you curious?" Harry pulled on his pajama tracksuit in front of him, standing next to Draco's bed.
A despicable but warm feeling filled him. That Draco would be alone, confused, desperate ...
"I don't mean this, I mean ..." Harry clenched his hands, hiding them in his pants pockets, "I want us to go out as a couple, as boyfriends."
Thank you all very much for the kudos, favorites, comments ... I am very happy to know that someone is reading this and smiles (or despairs, whatever the case may be)
"I don't think so much." Harry stopped playing with the bag of chips and sat across from Draco, being separated only by a couple of feet between their beds. I mean, of course you're a Slytherin, but I think now you've changed to how they knew you. I don't know what you were like before, but I definitely like the way you are now.
-I always knew. You are more of a Slytherin than a Gryffindor.
-Revenge? He asked curiously, although he already knew the answer.
The sight that greeted him was the cobwebbed stairs he had never missed, and seconds later, the voice of his aunt knocking on the door next to him and yelling at him that it was time to make breakfast.
Harry could swear not.
But when Draco approached him the day before after Potions classes and told him that he had to talk to him, his hope increased a couple of points to radically fall into the void after hearing something that left his heart hurt in moments.
"Yes, everything is correct." I was just coming to let you know I'll be leaving today, ”Harry said with a straight and serious posture, very different from that mischievous and insightful attitude he had the first time he stepped into that office.
FOREWORD
... truth?
"Bustlesong will take care of answering as many questions as he can, Mr. Potter."
"Redheads, freckles, more children than they can support." Malfoy lifted his nose. Or maybe for being recognized as blood traitors. You decide which one you like best.
Oh ... I wasn't going to be able to buy Hedwig. Even if it's not the first year, not with the Dursleys. He could easily go to Grimmauld Place for years to come, but all he knew so far about the Fidelius was that he needed a Guardian who was truly loyal and not a bloody rat. So no, it wasn't really an option. Besides, he was sure that Kreacher was there and his loyalty, whether the elf liked it or not, was with the Blacks, and not with Harry.
His next stop was the apothecary, where he bought a potions kit for beginners and, having actually learned something in Snape's classes in addition to a variety of insults, he bought the same instruments but of better quality, choosing them separately. It assumes that the potions kit is primarily to help Muggle-borns who didn't know what to look for. Ignoring her curiosity to buy some ingredients, she paid for her things and asked if they could send them to her room in the Cauldron, just like she had asked with the books, and headed straight for the scroll shop across the street.
Harry nodded, hiking him up once more, “Just cold and asleep.” Though he seemed to accept that answer, it didn’t stop Ron from giving Draco a quick once over with his eyes to confirm as Harry passed him into the common room. As soon as people saw him carrying in Draco, they all launched into a flurry asking if he was okay and what happened and why. He’d seen birds flock onto a French fry in such a similar manner. Harry happily used Draco’s long legs with purpose this time, swinging them out in front of their path sweeping the people out of his way. “He’s fine, let me through. SCOOT!” He shouted for the few more persistent people. Ron helped usher and blocked the other eighth years from following him up the final few tower steps to Draco and Harry’s dorm room. Harry popped a blood vessel opening the door wandlessly and grunted as he pushed the door all the way open with their bodies. He marched across the room, heading straight for the bathroom.
“Yes, pervert,” Draco aspirated making Harry chuckled as he dropped his hands. Harry’s eyes raked over Draco, examining the extent of the goop on him.
Harry dropped his face to shake Draco’s hips again with a rueful smile, “Already forgetting the kissing again, sweetheart? I kinda want to be able to continue doing that. Kinda have a thing for you and it’ll be a little hard to keep kissing you if you’re dead or in Azkaban for Headmaster-cide.”
“I forgot about the kissing part,” Draco muttered.
Fully dry, fully dressed, and fully still asleep, Harry tugged the blankets around Draco and tucked him in. His porcelain skin was no longer dull and stained blue but bright with a pretty pink flush. He looked so warm and soft under the puffy comforter. Squishy love warmed him over compelling him to lean over Draco to leave a kiss on his forehead. But as he pulled back, Draco made an adorable grunting noise while his fingers curled possessively around the sleeve of Harry's sweater. Harry grinned all too prepared to leave little kisses onto the fingers that he was trying to peel off of his sleeve. The gentle pressure was getting him nowhere. Harry looked over at his books on the other bed. The essay missing its final paragraph calling out to him to finish. It was too early to go to bed, Draco. He may not agree but Harry didn’t wanna. Harry applied just a little more pressure to pull those slender fingers off his sweater, but Draco whined a low whimpering sound and Harry knew he lost that battle. With the sigh of a defeated giant, Harry pushed back the blankets to crawl under them. It was a little hard to do with only one hand but he managed it. As soon as Harry’s legs swung under the sheets Draco turned onto his side, wrapping his arm around Harry’s waist, and throwing a leg over his. Regretful laughter puffed out of Harry, teetering back and forth on looking at his cuddly boyfriend with big ole gay heart eyes and gentle annoyance that the koala boy couldn’t have held off on wrapping around him until he at least laid all the way down. A sleeping Draco created struggles every step of tonight, including simply getting into bed. He supposed, while he pathetically scooted so that maybe he could curl himself to be able to lay his head onto a pillow, that if the struggle was what made it romantic, Harry was full of so much romance tonight he should just bloody well propose. He closed his eyes as his head sank into the pillow at the odd angle created by Draco’s head buried into Harry’s chest. He squeezed Draco tight and let out a deep breath as he released him. Maybe he could sleep. Yes, sleep sounded like a good idea. The essay could be finished in the morning.
Harry flushed immediately hiding his face in his hands. His voice was muffled by his hands as he pitifully admitted, “It wasn’t just once three months ago. I was regularly hooking up with Draco for about six months, but it ended suddenly about a month ago.”
“The stag caught the end of your message, mate,” Ron pulled on his Harry impression again, “
“A little warning would be nice. Also, you can put me down now, I can walk.” Draco complained. Harry grinned, plucking a quick kiss, and releasing Draco from his arms. He held back his snort as he watched Draco straighten his clothes and fix his hair while Harry scooped his wand off the floor. Jamming the wand back into his pocket, he grabbed Draco’s hand and lead him away. Draco followed but not without questioning, “Where are you taking me?”
Harry snorted folding his arms and sitting back as if he was comfortable on the stool, “Your hair and back are covered in it; you’re telling me you think you can get it all yourself?” Draco pouted and crossed his arms over his chest. Harry might have a point, however, being fully nude while Harry touched him was not going to go over very well. He didn’t suppose friends liked it when you popped a boner in front of them. Only so much imagining Snape in a bikini could be done, there was no way he was getting away without a boner. Harry rolled his eyes, “Stop being so stubborn. Get in the tub before that stuff dries. Somehow, I imagine it gets even more permanent if it gets to cement into you. Then we’ll have to shave your pretty hair which will be a damn shame.” Damn, he was probably right, he didn’t know what it would do dry but based on the pinching feeling he was getting in some spots of his skin, it wasn’t going to be good.
Hermione had told him to wait until after work because she could not condone disrupting the workplace but as soon as she walked away, Harry met Ron’s eyes with a questioning smile. Ron rolled his eyes and waved him off which Harry took as his willingness to cover for him while he went to go apologize to Draco. He scurried off to the elevators and found them too full and slow to carry his nervous energy, so he veered off towards the staircase and jogged down the steps to three floors lower where the Archive Department was housed, which was where Draco hid away most days doing his data cataloging. It will never not amuse him that it was Draco Malfoy that was in charge of the main integration of the Ministry’s back files into the adapted muggle computer system. He kind of liked the archives in the sense that the emptiness of people was relaxing, and the smell of old paper and candles tickled the nose in a not unpleasant way. While it was dim in the aisles of files, it wasn’t depressing or disconcerting, but more of settling and calming like an evening at home with a good book read only by the light of the fireplace. Not that he did much reading by the fireplace. He did like to lay on the couch with his head in Draco’s lap as he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair and read aloud whatever book he was reading at the time. Harry never got to hear a whole book through, but it didn’t matter as long as he got to listen to Draco’s voice tell the story. Fuck, how did he not notice how gone he was on the man? He had no right to be annoyed the next time someone called him oblivious to everything outside of the job. Not after this blundering failure. Bloody hell, he was back at the entrance of the stacks of files. That was why he could never love the archives like Draco loved the archives. It was so damn bloody easy to get twisted around in the maze of matching file cabinets. He had a suspicion that the files moved around so that unwanted visitors could never get through to the center. He gathered these suspicions over time as he noticed that the more he and Draco became closer over the years, the easier it was for Harry to find Draco in the stacks. He had thought that Draco may have been reorganizing them more effectively, however, most of the other Aurors were still frequently complaining about the confusing twists in this archival maze. Smith said that no matter which route he took, he always ended up at the start after three turns. Harry groaned as he spotted the opening to the maze once more. They DEFINITELY were moving around on him. “Awe come on, Draco! Let me in!” He bellowed over the files as he marched into the stacks for the third time. This time he couldn’t even make multiple turns before getting spit back out to the front. He turned once and faced the entrance again. Harry stopped and stood at the 90-degree corner and stared at the entrance at the end of both of the aisles. That didn’t make any bloody sense. Harry groaned louder and stomped down the aisle, “Fine! You win this round, Malfoy. I’ll catch you later.” Even as he stomped up every stair step to his floor, he had to admit to himself that he deserved the twist around. Hopefully, he was much better at snagging Draco than he was of him. He refused to let a whole two more weeks pass by of not getting to go home to Draco.
“Ron,” Harry tried to interrupt but Ron continued as he gently lowered Draco all the way into the water, not caring that he was getting his sleeves wet. Or not noticing in his tirade. Either way, his sleeves were getting soggy.
Ron opened one eye and peeked down at Draco’s face, “Wow, he’s really asleep. He’s one heavy sleeper.”
“Draco,” he shouted. He didn’t miss Draco hastily wiping his face as his spine straightened to proper posture.
Draco yawned, “Goodnight, Harry,” rubbing his face sleepily into the cotton of Harry’s pj shirt, “You know, I just might.”
The scrape of the broom callouses on Harry’s hands against Draco’s fair skin covered his body in goosebumps as he shivered with excited anticipation the closer Harry got to Draco’s cock. His hands were so hot compared to the cooler air on his bare skin. A scorching hand found his prick, gliding up and down his shaft spreading precum as he went. Another blistering hand traveled lower, grazing his balls before rubbing around the ring his arsehole. The first stroke was dry but as the finger passed its first rotation, it slickened with the help of a nonverbal wandless charm. Draco’s seen Harry practically shit himself to achieve a wandless nox. But creating lube out of thin air was easy as breathing. It’s amazing what proper motivation could have on a man’s magical skills. Harry’s finger breached his hole and Draco’s toes curled before relaxing with a sigh as Harry moved the finger around. Sensations without sight were quite delectable. He just might have to challenge Harry again in the future. When Harry got two fingers working inside of him, Harry started feeling around for his prostate. He was getting a little rowdy in his search so when he found it, he stroked it hard. Draco gasped, his back arching and his eyes fluttering. He resolutely held them closed even if the lashes couldn’t behave.
He shifted Draco into his arms, scooping as much of him up as he could in attempt to cover him up again with Harry’s body. “We’re all war survivors, Ron,” he tried to remind without getting tetchy.
Harry chuckled, “Only if you open your eyes, sweetheart. Let me see those gorgeous greys and I’ll give you all you want.” Draco’s skin tingled under each little encouraging kiss Harry left on his cheeks and neck.
“Now, be good and keep those eyes open and I’ll fuck you as you want. Can you do that for me?” He asked while letting his hot breath puff out over Draco’s nipple. Draco nodded his eyes latched onto the sight of Harry bringing those lips around him once more. There was nowhere else he wanted to look still trying to reconcile in his mind that that was what was creating the sensation through his body. If it weren’t for the heady leak of his cock, he wouldn’t be too sure if he liked the feeling. However, when Harry pulled away and started pounding him in earnest, Draco ached for his mouth to go back. Harry looped one of Draco’s legs over his forearm as he pressed in to kiss Draco. He was close but he could tell Harry was closer. Instead of reaching down between them for Draco’s cock, Harry reached for Draco’s hand. He entwined their fingers together, giving a little squeeze then draped their hands open over Draco’s chest, effectively pinning his nipple between their two thumbs. Each rocking of their bodies naturally pitched their thumbs together making Draco whine with each undulation. Those sharp snaps tingling in time with the attack on his prostate brought him over the edge. Draco cried out his spine arching as he coated their chests in cum trying to escape the overstimulation. He clenched around Harry as he stuttered above him filling Draco up. Harry pulled out only to collapse onto the bed beside Draco to catch his breath. Harry’s sneaky fingers found Draco’s and he weaved them together. Apparently, their sweaty shoulders touching was not enough for him. Tactile bastard. Wisps of air swept over his face following a muttered accio brought to Draco’s attention that his eyes had fluttered shut once more. He shivered with the unexpected touch of a dampened rag dragging over his chest. Like he said,
Harry chuckled but humored him, closing his eyes and covering them with his hands, “You know we’re both blokes, right? Blokes who have lived in dorms with multiple boys for years now. Blokes who live with each other currently for months now. You don’t have to be prudish around me.”
He smirked at himself before he continued his march up the stairs and responded to Draco, “Well, I didn’t lay out in the rain for hours. I still have my body heat left.” Tiptoeing around a clambering catastrophe, Harry twirled in place at the top of the stairs when he tried to turn the corner and almost knocked down a suit of armor with Draco’s long legs. Thanks to no longer starving and a bit of exercise Harry gratefully had body mass to hold onto Draco. However, this did not change the fact that he had legs for days and was too stiff and out of it to pay attention to the surrounding clutter and move them out of the way accordingly. So, Harry nearly took out one of the few suits that survived the war with his boyfriend’s protruding limbs.
—His best was 320 points in a school game against Ravenclaw. Apparently the meeting only lasted 3 hours.
I would see them again, all of them. To his parents, to Sirius, to all those who died without Harry being able to do anything. I would ask their forgiveness, and I would finally rest in peace after seventeen years without rest. The darkness was taking over his soul and mind, and Harry felt himself smile. He certainly wouldn't miss his uncles or cousin, but he wished Hermione and Ron all the luck and happiness, as well as their families. Merlin, the Weasleys were Harry's family from the time he knew them, he greatly hoped they would survive and be able to thrive.
Harry's eyes widened when he heard the annoying doorbell he remembered from his uncle's house. He was about to complain, really, Harry was having his moment as he embraced death with open arms, and being interrupted by a memory as strong and annoying as that disturbed him to hell. A damn moment of peace was asking, please.
It wouldn't be the first time that he didn't die when he had to.
He sees the tears come out of those eyes, a broken double-sided mask on the ground and blood on his neck ...
"Okay," Hermione said and Draco just nodded.
What if he wasn't a bastard like he was from first grade?
“You’re doing what?” Draco squawked and released his grip on the door which made it swing open and Harry pitch forward without the countering weight. Harry stumbled but thankfully caught himself before he face-planted and broke his nose. He did not want to get blood on these robes.
Ron put his hands up with a grimace, “I’m out.” Ron spun and left the room.
“Well, when you put it that way,” Harry laughed, amazed at himself that he dared to push Luck so far. His grin only grew wider the longer Draco stayed in his lap with his body settling into Harry even if his mind was still wrapping itself around Harry’s bold choices.
Harry rolled his eyes and presented himself around Draco’s body, “Would you rather undress me?” Ron groaned crouching in front of them and scooping Draco into his arms. His eyes were pinched closed and his head turned away like that made a difference at this point. His eyes would hurt if he had to roll them one more time tonight. Harry shook his head at his ridiculous friend and turned off the water so it didn’t overspill as he stripped.
Unsurprisingly, Draco sneered albeit lackluster compared to his typical look, “Your help? You offering to kill your mentor for me, Potter?”
While always pleased to be reminded that Harry did like him, in a friend capacity, of course, he could not contain the pouting grumble of his reply, “No, completely harmless, just a bitch to get off. It can only be spelled off of inorganic materials.” Harry’s eyes twinkled as he dropped the towel into Draco’s hands so he could wipe his hands off and the mirth of the situation returned to his face.
Harry rubbed the stiffness out of his face, “Um about two weeks, I think?”
Draco cleared his throat and dropped his hand though he couldn’t quite lose the grin, “I best be getting ready now, I suppose.”
Unable to pout in silence, Ron prodded, “So, why was the prat wallowing?” Harry froze in the middle of pushing a button through the eyelet, he knew without a doubt that Draco would not want him to tell Ron just yet. But they all knew Harry’s lying skills. If Harry was to bet on who made their secret relationship obvious to everyone, it’d be his arse he’d bet on. “Are you really trying to lie right now?”
“Wallowing? In the rain? Tad dramatic, ain’t it?” Ron snorted leaning into the bathroom doorframe with his arms crossed. Harry huffed and batted at the hair in his eyes and gave Ron what he hoped he interrupt as ‘This is fucking Malfoy we’re talking about’. Ron laughed; He got the message.
“Ron,
Harry sighed, “Please come inside.”
Static warmth radiated within his soft cocoon harmonizing with the yellow glow behind his eyelids. He was sunk into blissful heat so snuggly, so comfortable he didn’t want anything but this. The endless heat in his arms was even better than the plush heat over his back. He squeezed this blissful warmth in his arms and sighed. The pillow of incandescent heat rumbled with… laughter? Pillows don’t laugh. “Good morning, Sleeping Beauty,” his pillow teased. Draco’s brows pinched as he rubbed his face into his pillow. Ahh, the warm fibers of a sweater knitted with a mother’s love paired with the smell of the boyfriend. Pillow of heat was actually the body of one Harry Potter who prodded, “You gonna wake up now, sweetheart?” What he would give to get one of these sweaters of his own. Maybe providing Mrs. Weasley with a grandchild would earn him one.
He nuzzled Harry’s hand before muttering into it, “So, Wonder Boy, how are you saving the fallen?”
“You’re absolutely barmy,” Draco breathed out. Harry could only laugh more and tugged him forward into a hug. Draco sank into the physical affection more than Harry expected but that just inspired him to hold him stronger.
Draco laughed a little as he wiped away more falling tears, “I guess we can’t call you the biggest dolt then…” he trailed off with a small smile on his face though he was still refusing to look back up.
Harry laughed as he maneuvered Draco’s other wrist to be under his one hand’s grip, “Any other resources I should be prepared for?”
“HA! So he is your boyfriend!” Ron spun and jumped facing Harry, snapping his fingers and pointing. Harry jerked his head up dangerously close to giving himself whiplash.
Draco whined, “M’s so tired.” Harry huffed as he stepped up onto the first step of the longest flight of stairs but right around the corner would be the entrance to the 8
He held Harry’s face in both his hands and kissed him senseless, “I could be amenable to that.”
“I’m washing away my sins.” The heaviness in Draco’s tone implied that it wasn’t going as well as he wanted. Still, Harry paused; Why right now and like this? What happened to bring this on?
“Hey!” Harry shouted dropping his grip on Draco’s hip to lean up to yank Draco’s hand from his face to pin his wrist above his head. “That’s cheating.”
Harry sighed with relief, “Okay, so you won’t tell ‘Mione?”
“Room of Requirement. We need our beauty sleep, and I don’t think it’d be wise for one of us to sneak into the other one’s dorms so, hopefully, Hogwarts is feeling accommodating,” Harry mused. The Room of Requirement has helped Harry out in the past but he’s never gone to it for something like this and he truly wondered if the sentient room had purity opinions that would block them from use tonight. Draco twisted his hand in Harry’s to entwine their fingers and confidently followed beside Harry since he probably knew where Harry was headed. Watching the door form, Harry flashed Draco a satisfied smile, grateful the Hogwarts wasn’t a prude. They stepped into the room, smaller than he has ever seen it, but cozy with a plush bed beside a roaring fireplace, two pairs of pajamas on the bed, and two glasses of water on the nightstand. “Perfect, I’m wiped.” Harry pulled Draco into the room and closed the door behind them. He quickly began to shed his clothes for one set of pajamas, letting his layers drop to the floor without preamble. Draco seemed frozen watching Harry strip to his pants and redress into pajamas in front of him. Harry smirked at Draco, pleased beyond belief to have short-circuited him even if it was from accidental obliviousness, “Sweetheart, I know my ass is delightful but you’re gonna have to snap out of it if you want to change.” Draco shook his head out, blushing profusely as he bowed his head to work on his shirt buttons. Harry debated on teasing him further like oogle him as he changed but he decided to take pity on the stressed-out boy and crawled into bed, fluffing pillows and setting alarms. He didn’t look up until Draco was nervously crawling into bed beside him. Harry laid back on the pillows and opened his arms in invitation which was all Draco needed to clamber in and sag into Harry’s chest. His octopus arms wrapped around Harry’s waist and squeezed tightly. With all of the budding love and hopeful warmth, Harry squeezed him back and kissed the top of his head, “Goodnight, Draco. Sleep well.”
“I didn’t, I mean,” Draco stuttered as his face continued to blotch.
“Hey! It’s not my fault that I didn’t know that there were different consequences to when two wizards dot dot dot vs two muggle men!” Harry defended.
“What? My grandfather’s hair potion?” Harry’s voice was thick with confusion.
“You’ve got natural talent, Harry. You should go into hairdressing. Be the Boy Who Lived to Wash Hair.” Draco mumbled with a grin pushing his head into Harry’s hands. Harry laughed inspiring Draco’s grin to grow wider.
Draco popped open a single eye to look at Harry, “What?”
Draco looked up at him and smirked, “You didn’t.” Harry plucked it out of his pocket and teetered it between his fingers. Draco rolled his eyes with a big grin and stepped out of the way for Harry to come inside. As he stepped across the threshold, Harry slipped his arm around Draco’s waist and tugged them chest to chest.
“No! At least he never said we were. We never talked about it at all. We hooked up after the gala and then we both had a bad day a couple of days later and decided whiskey and sex was a great way to solve that issue and I don’t know. It just grew from there. We didn’t need a reason anymore to hang out and we didn’t even have sex every night. Sometimes, we just went to bed. But we weren’t dating cuz we never said we were,” Harry’s arms flapped in frustration.
“Oh? What is Draco doing?” Harry muttered. He really fucking hoped that he actually understood how temperature affected transfigured properties because if not, the resulting roast from Draco tonight would leave them no time for
“You seem to be touching me without aversion,” Draco pointed out with an amused lilt.
Draco huffed looking away from him as he snottily replied, “And why do you think that?” Harry took a moment to reply, watching how Draco twitched and frowned beside him. His weary body was rigid despite the evident exhaustion. The yearning to envelop his enemy in his arms so he may rest sung in Harry’s veins as loud as the Luck that gave him the resolve to try. Harry reached out to touch Draco’s face. Draco flinched from the movement, but Harry’s hand remained steady, frozen in the air relaxed with no ill intent, as Draco turned his head to look at Harry with wild eyes. Holding his gaze, Harry pushed his hand forward slowly until Draco shockingly allowed Harry to cup his cheek. Harry ghosted his thumb over one of the dark bags under Draco’s eyes careful not to put pressure on the tender skin.
“Can you imagine it? Me going up to McGonagall and telling her, “Professor, I’ve found my calling. My next contribution to the Wizarding World is really good hair washes,” Harry snorted clearly thinking about saying it to her face just to see it in person. Draco hoped that if he did pull off trying to convince the Headmistress of such an unexpected profession that he would share the memory with him.
Harry grunted again in an effort to sit on the edge of the tub without falling in with the weight of Draco against him, “Wallowing.”
Harry halted mid-step to squawked indignantly, “Excuse me? How is carrying you
Harry laughed, relieved in ways he didn’t know he needed, and nodded, “Please don’t tell ‘Mione though. We’ll tell her soon.”
His grip on Draco tightened as he tried to hold Draco into place as he begged, “No, don’t leave. I’m sorry I froze. I just needed to process that. I don’t want you to leave.” Draco lowered his hips back down but didn’t lean back into Harry, pushing his body against Harry’s arms around his back until Harry dropped them. Draco sat in Harry’s lap with his shoulders curved in on himself, looking down at his hands where he was picking his cuticles. Since he wasn’t returning to the snuggle, Harry pulled his hips closer to Harry’s core to gain back some of the closeness Draco tried to create. Draco’s hands shot out to Harry’s shoulders for balance and Harry took the opportunity to try to catch Draco’s eyes. When he effectively kept his gaze away, Harry brought a hand to Draco’s face, cupping it like before but slipping a thumb under his chin to direct his face. Draco’s eyes flickered over to Harry’s trying not to look but unable to stop himself. However, once their eyes met, they were locked into the depths of their stares. Draco’s stormy eyes were cloudy with fear, wet with sorrow. Harry felt colder so he knew the Luck had finally run out so it was with his special brand of reckless bravery that he asked, “Draco, sweetheart, do you want my help?”
hung so heavily in the air that for a brief second Harry contemplated making him walk. But Draco’s face held a bluish tint now evident in the light and the way he shivered meant Harry was definitely going to carry him. That did not mean he had to make it harder on himself. Harry sneered back almost missing the way that Draco’s lips quirked upwards with a tiny little flicker as he returned to his path up to their room.
Harry rubbed the elbow he held with his thumb, “So what do you say? Will you go on a date with me?
Draco’s face was pinched like he smelled something horrid, “Why?”
“Yes?” he whispered back.
A preemptive shiver rolled over his skin when he opened the door to the outside. He double casted his umbrella charm before he stepped out into the steady rain. Rain was so much more pleasant to experience indoors. Where it was dry and warm. The exact opposite of his soggy boyfriend in the grass. Harry wasn’t traipsing through the lawn quietly, yet Draco hadn’t twitched at all. Panic started to flare in his body that something was terribly wrong when Harry slipped and nearly wiped out into the mud, cursing the whole time as he twisted and jerked to right himself. The commotion akin to an erumpent trying to ice skate was too much for Harry to explain Draco’s lack of reaction on the muting of the rain. Harry picked up his step as fast as he was willing to risk in the slick grass and called out, “Draco! Are you okay?!” Draco’s pale hand rose from the grass and shooed him off. Harry’s never felt such relief from a Malfoy dismissal in his life.
Trailing a finger down his spine, Harry’s voice wavered, “Has gone all the way down your back and,” Harry’s finger has stopped a few inches above his arse still mostly submerged in the sudsy water, “And down between your cheeks.”
Ron’s face twisted up in all the different emotional opinions Ron experienced in his head moments ago, “You knocked up
“Harry,” Draco whispered. And his eyes flicked up and met Draco’s in the mirror with unreadable intensity. Draco turned slowly and looked him directly in the face. Up close he could see all that the foggy mirror hid. All the vibrant want was proven by the locked-in stare on his lips when Draco’s tongue slipped out to wet them. “Harry,” he whispered again, and the man whimpered. Quickly, before he lost his nerve, Draco grabbed Harry’s jumper and pulled him closer. His other hand took Harry’s face in his palm and guided their lips together. After a single touch, Harry ignited, pitching forward to cradle Draco’s face in his hands. As their tongues met, Draco pulled Harry closer yet, crashing him into the tub splashing water over the edges. Neither cared that he was still fully clothed and sitting twisted on Draco’s lap in the tub with his feet still hanging over the edge. Draco’s hands wandered through his hair and down his neck and shoulder’s impeded by the jumper absorbing the bathwater. Draco plunged his hands under the water to find the hem of the jumper trying to peel the garment over his head without pulling their lips apart. Harry laughed and took over parting with his soggy jumper. “Get rid of it all while you’re at it,” Draco demanded.
Harry used his arm around Draco’s waist to bring them into each other closer, rubbing their noses together, “Yeah.” Draco beamed pressing their foreheads together and tangling their legs. All he knew yesterday was everything had changed. All he knew when he woke was the warmth of Harry could expel the chill of the pouring rain.
Harry pinched his own, “Isn’t he the reason you’ve gotten into this mess?”
Harry let out a big huff his eye twitching as he threatened with his teeth clenched, “Draco freaking Malfoy, if you don’t help me out, I’m calling Ron back in here to help me undress you.” And Harry got no response just Draco’s mouth popping open a little leaving tuffs of breath against Harry’s neck. Harry groaned and shifted the lug over so he could tug his wand out of his pocket. He called out a Patronus to send to Ron, “Ron, can you come back?” All of the tension that was in Draco’s body from becoming partially awake leaked out of him and Harry nearly dropped him on the floor. Harry grunted, “Oh for fuck’s sake, Draco.” He didn’t see if the stag took off correctly due to being a little preoccupied gathering up the wet noodle boy.
He squeezed Draco’s hips, “Draco, do you trust me?”
activities before bed.
Got a good laugh out of all of us. So, what did he do?” Ron’s impressions were getting sickeningly good. Harry supposed he earned a swift nut tap for his efforts. Bloody arsehole.
“I thought I didn’t have anything to atone for,” Harry snarked back.
Harry pointed to Draco’s sprawled feet, “Can you get his boots off? I’ll start on his shirt buttons.” Ron flopped down onto the floor and started undoing the laces, his unwillingness displayed with every snap of a loosened lace.
Ron grimaced, “You want me to hold your naked boyfriend?” One moment, unable to stop oogling, next moment, too squeamish to hold him. Ron made no sense.
Harry nipped at the sharp edge of Draco’s jaw, “You gonna open your eyes, princess?”
But moments later, Ron bumbled back in snickering, “So what did he do?”
“We’re almost to our room. Then we got to get you in the shower and warm you up and clean the mud out of your hair,” he said as much for Draco’s benefit as his own. Hoping to spur them both on to endure.
year tower.
being quiet. You’re the one who broke the silence,” Harry gestured wildly with finger-pointing and everything, “Can we go inside now? I’m cold, you’re c…”
Ron pulled up on Draco’s heel and tugged off the boot with a little bit of unnecessary force, “It’s getting a little annoying that you keep secrets from your best friend for Malfoy.”
Ron casted a drying spell on his clothes where they had gotten wet and clapped Harry on the shoulder. The big mirthful grin told Harry all he needed to know about Ron’s resolving thoughts, “I hope this means I get to be a godfather.”
Draco scoffed and mocked, “Well, when two wizards…”
Harry pushed back the hair that had fallen into Draco’s face, and spoke calmly having to work harder to keep from spooking Draco without the Luck, “What if we got your mother to safety?”
Harry chuckled to clear the emotion thickening in his throat, “I suppose you’re right. We can reenact how we created life after dessert.” He smirked as Draco glared at him though the potency was weakened when Harry caught the crinkle of amusement in the corners of his eyes as he spun on his heel and marched into the house not waiting for Harry to follow him. Harry shut the door behind himself and locked it nonverbally as he blissfully watched Draco strut up the stairs. He should send Hermione a gift basket for being so right.
Draco sniffed and wiped aggressively at his eyes with the back of his hand and cleared his throat, “What time is the reservation?”
Draco yawned and stretched like a cat, his head and shoulders bowing but his legs stretching out as long and straight as they’d go. “Excellent,” Draco sighed out as he released his stretch, “A day in bed.” He snuggled again into Harry.
He sneered down at Harry, “That’s Malfoy to you, Potter.” Harry just rolled his eyes and hopped up onto the ledge beside Draco who stared back at him incredulously. “What are you doing?”
Harry nodded softly, letting his lips tickle this skin of Draco’s neck as he spoke, “Yeah, sorry sweetheart.”
“If we are to be able to smuggle your family safely out of their own home, we’re going to need help and I’m not risking my friends again. As much as I don’t trust Snape, Dumbledore does and so does your family. He’s your godfather, isn’t he?”
. A simple cleaning charm would do the trick much quicker. Not nearly as pleasant but definitely more effective. Was Harry’s penchant for post-coital manual cleaning the cause of their situation? Would there have been enough time for Harry’s sperm to take hold if they had used cleaning charms? Or were they fucked no matter what course they took since they took it without contraceptives to begin with? As painful as it would have been to tolerate in a room full of his classmates, a sex-ed class seemed impertinent. “What are you thinking about so hard?” Harry inquired, his normal tone of voice startling Draco. Draco jolted and blinked at Harry owlishly. Harry smiled ruefully, “Sorry.” He crawled back into bed and tugged the comforter over top of them. He curled up onto his side towards Draco who was still sprawled out on his back. Could he tell him what he was thinking about? Had he already told him about the baby? Or was that a fever dream?
Draco hummed, “Yeah, I think people might not take you seriously with your bird’s nest of a head. You have to that cut.”
“Ugh, the ground is cold and I’m getting wet,” Harry whined turning his head to look at Draco to see if his moaning cracked Draco’s statuesque mask.
Harry chuckled, “Yeah, Draco, I have a thing for you. I wouldn’t have risked getting decked for a kiss just for kicks.” Draco studied Harry’s face, touching his features with shaking but no less reverently as Harry had done to Draco. Harry kept his eyes locked onto Draco, watching him think and decide. Draco pinched his brows together pursing his lips before he held Harry’s face still and leaned in. His tight lips softened as he pressed them into Harry’s. They kissed soft and slow, ignoring the precipice they existed upon.
Draco hummed and smirked, “Make me.” Harry might have scoffed but the wandering hands over his body and renewed kisses upon his lips, jaw, and neck declared that Harry happily took up the challenge. Blindly, his hands found Harry’s head scritching his nails through his hair and rubbing down his back when he was close enough. Harry pulled back to fumble the buttons of Draco’s top. Those buttons Harry was popping open seemed bigger than his normal sleep shirts. What was he wearing? His brow furrowed as he felt his top. Was this his cashmere cardigan? “Harry, am I…”
Harry sighed a breath of relief, “Yeah, Draco. I will.” To seal the promise, he pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s neck.
“You didn’t feel like sharing?” Draco bitched. He definitely wasn’t going to open his eyes now. He didn’t want to see how bad the damage was. Maybe it could be donated to a heathen who couldn’t recognize stretched wool when they saw it.
He hiked Draco up once more in his arms, holding him out, “Okay, now you hold him while I get undressed.”
Draco sluggishly brought his hands to his face and sighed, “Pureblood wizards can. Practically improbable without fertility potions but not surprisingly, Savior sperm also defy odds of survival.”
Chapter Two bitches 💕💕💕
“But why do you care?” Draco whispered back his eyes widening at his own words, almost shocked that he had said anything at all. Even with Luck on his side, words failed to explain the same question his friends ask every time he tried to talk to them about Malfoy. Saying the wrong thing would break the fragile space he had found himself in. So, Harry took his time and tickled Draco's face with soft touches over his eyebrow, down his nose, and over his cheeks until Draco’s eyes fluttered closed again. As his thumb traced over pale lips, he knew how to explain better than with words and he leaned in pressing their lips together. When he pulled back, Draco was frozen into place with his head still cradled in Harry’s palm looking at Harry with owl-like eyes. Draco’s lips parted softly, “Oh.”
Ron blinked a couple of times more before a strangled noise came out of his throat, “Oh, I heard you.”
,” Harry begged, throwing out a bottom lip pout and desperate eyes with extreme effort because if you can’t beat them, join them. He knew the second Ron accepted his fate, but he held off his grin until after Ron verbally accepted. Didn’t want to accidentally goad him into changing his mind.
Ron put his hands on his hips and grinned, “Yeah, except I didn’t say who, you did, and if he wasn’t your boyfriend you would have said,” Ron made a mess of his copper locks and put on a mocking unamused look pretending to be Harry, “Who’s my boyfriend? Or you would have said, ‘Course he’s being weird, Ron, I don’t even know his name.” Ron’s grin only grew as Harry glared him down. The fucker had a point and Harry didn’t know how to get out of this one. It was a Western stand-off between Harry’s stubborn glare and Ron’s gloating mirth and Harry wasn’t going to be the one to break it until he had come up with a way to salvage his slip up. His eyes were parched when Ron broke with a laugh and tugged Harry’s arm out of the bed, pointing out the window, “While you keep coming up with that lie, the ferret is going to get pneumonia.” Harry stumbled out of the bed, cascading his sacrificial offerings all over the floor. His only saving grace from face planting into the mess was the same reason he was in danger of it, aka Ron’s Keeper’s hand gripping his arm. Harry straightened up and yanked his arm from Ron’s grasp and swatted him before looking out the window.
Draco screwed his face up tightly, “No.” He jerked his hips obstinately and Harry tsked grabbing his hip with a firm hand, holding him down from trying to get his way. Harry moved even slower, scooching in so close there was barely any room for anything more than a gentle glide. Draco whined with frustration, “If you think you’re going to win this way, you’re wrong and you’re torturing yourself in the process.”
Draco stomped his foot lightly and huffed, “Fine, but close your eyes or turn around while I get in.”
The individual bathrooms in the eighth-year dorms were without a bathtub which was unfortunate for Draco’s need for soaking. While Draco had planned on just taking the longest shower imaginable, Harry transfigured a mug into a full tub in the middle of their now, very cramped bathroom. He filled it with water and bubbles while Draco grumbled and grunted off his goopy layers of clothes. He was down to his pants when he looked up to find Harry pulling a stool into the room and sitting down beside the tub. Draco furrowed his brows and placed his fists on his hips, “What in Merlin’s name are you doing?”
“Hangouts,” Harry shrugged.
“Because Hermione has this theory that I’m the biggest dolt in the universe. She says that while I assumed that since we didn’t say otherwise, you and I were not exclusive nor even dating but you likely assumed the opposite since we slept beside each other most nights of the week and that’s not really something you do with your best buddy even if you’re getting some with your best buddy.” Draco’s glare was getting more violent, and Harry steeled himself for having to slam his body into the door to keep it open. “She said that you saw our takeaway and movie nights as hermit dates and I didn’t at all so then when I did go on that date, that public date, you thought I was hiding you away or ashamed to be seen with you.” Draco’s jaw clicked as he turned his head away, looking up to the sky to fight against the shine Harry could see building up. “That’s not true at all, Draco. I’m not ashamed of you, I just didn’t know we were dating.”
“And you weren’t exclusively dating?”
?! The fuck?
touching him. That wouldn’t be fun. Draco huffed with impatience. Just as he was opening his mouth to bitch, Harry crawled back in between his legs, lifting his hips to jam a pillow under him before he nestled up against Draco. He left a dirty kiss upon Draco’s lips then leaned back to guide his cock into Draco. Once the head of his cock was lined up he pushed in one solid shove with the slick of the lube charm until he bottomed out. Draco gasped and slapped his hand over his eyes to keep them shut.
“He was a dispensable pawn of the bad guy, plus the good guys leave scars too,” Harry’s voice hardened as he frowned, forcing himself not to look at the Sectumsempra scars.
Ron followed behind, shutting the bedroom door before joining them in the bathroom, “So what was he doing?”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hips gently, “I feel like I should be insulted. You’re not even out of arms yet and you’ve forgotten our kisses,” Harry whined with a small grin that grew when Draco’s lips turned up slightly as his cheeks pinkened.
Draco broke first, his body shaking as he giggled into Harry, “What the bloody hell just happened?”
Harry beamed as Draco nodded stiffly and asked, “What are you going to do for an hour while I get ready?”
“I’m pretty sure I just saw your eyes almost open,” Harry nipped Draco’s earlobe with his taunt while adding a third finger.
Draco snorted but let Harry do whatever he was doing, “About time. Only due in the morning.” Harry smirked and brought Draco’s cold fingers to his lips. He kissed the slender digits, peering at his beautiful face. Professors, the public, his friends all asked what he wanted to do post-school. Most, he would tell them whatever he thought they’d want to hear to make them go away. Some he was honest to and admitted that to him his future plans were about as clear as the world was when he lost his glasses. Hermione had suggested he sit in silence and picture what made him happiest, where he’d like to spend his time, what achievements would make him feel the proudest. He had been frustrated time and time again when the only thing he could think of when he thought of happiness was Draco. He wanted to spend his time beside Draco. Bringing a smile to his face and keeping him safe were the kinds of things that made Harry feel accomplished. And Harry felt ridiculous and sappy. A sappy ridiculous bimbo whose boyfriend was all he could think about. But now he could see a clearer picture of his future. The image panned out from just Draco to include their family. His pride would be in caring for them, protecting them, living for them. A career would fall into place one day, but his job now was them. Harry brought his hand to Draco’s chilly cheek and in the pouring rain, his whole life shifted. His future started today, and he had a family to bring in from the rain.
“You saw nothing,” he sniffed turning his head away and pretending he wasn’t affected by the gentle petting of his prostate. The quiver of his legs gave him away, but he was ignoring that too.
Draco had begun to shiver the moment they breached the indoor warmth, but of course, the prat still noticed that. “Yes, Draco. I’m not carrying you up multiple flights of stairs with you weighing an ounce more than your books.”
Draco frowned, “Are my lips blue?”
Draco sighed again as Harry ran a comb over his hair, “Have you ever tried your grandfather’s hair potion?”
He could practically hear his voice scoffing in his head. Eh, either choice Draco would gripe about it. Might as go for the one that covers his arms all the way. Harry pulled out the cardigan and slipped Draco’s arm into the sleeve. Leaning over, rolling him, and tugging the material to the other side was difficult. But he imagined tugging the crew neck Weasley sweater over Draco’s head would have been harder. He got Draco’s buttons all done up and propped his hands on his hips and surveyed his charge. Draco snored on even with tendrils of hair dripping down his face. Harry pulled the towel the rest of the way out from underneath Draco and used it to rub dry Draco’s hair. Glee surged in his body with every tuft of blonde hair that stuck out into a different direction as the last. No need to lie to himself, he was dying to see the severity of Draco’s bedhead in the morning. It’d be epic.
Draco's eyes met Harry’s with an upturned sneer, only partially hindered by a shiver, “The romance is in the struggle, Potter.” The
As he was about to cast a third umbrella charm, Draco broke the silence to gripe, “It doesn’t count if you still have your umbrella charm up.”
? What would it be like to sink his teeth into that flesh? He’d love to make it raw with his teeth marks and soothe them over with kisses and kitten licks. Daydreaming of the taste of Harry’s arse, Draco absentmindedly tipped the Dragon Star seed powered into the main cauldron instead of the mini one they had set up to create a liquid solution before adding it to the main cauldron. The liquid burped as dread filled Draco’s body. He whispered a quick, “Oh shit,” and the once thin and slippery blue potion turned thick and gooey shooting straight up out of the cauldron to hit the ceiling and pour down over Draco. He gaped like a fish, trying to breathe through the downfall of thickened fluid. He could feel it slide down his back between his robes. He was rooted and blind, unable to wipe his eyes clear because he could feel that his hands were covered in the goo too. Faintly, under the goop coating his hair over his ears, he heard Harry’s boisterous belly laugh. Hands dripping, he flipped Harry off, only making him laugh harder. Sputtering goop that was trying to slip between his lips, Draco bitched, “You think you could pull yourself together anytime soon and help me?”
Harry scoffed, “You just did!” Not to point out his chest where the rain turned his shirt into a sheer impression of one which allowed the slash scarring, turned grey from the cold, to show through it. A big glaring proof that Harry had sins to lose.
Harry grabbed Draco’s face with both hands rougher than he had been handling Draco to focus his panicked gaze onto Harry, “I need you to trust me. I’ll keep you safe and I’ll get your family out. But it’ll only work if you trust me.”
Harry smiled, “I’m trying to win you back. I know better than surprise a date on you and not give you enough time to get ready.”
“I was wearing the one that fits your gangly arms in the rain. I couldn’t exactly put that on you,” Potter griped tugging on the sleeve of the sweater to get Draco’s
Ron choked and slapped the table, “Six months?! You’re joking. You’ve been having enemies with benefits with Malfoy for half a bloody year?”
“Me too, love.” Draco picked up speed until the sparks in his balls tightened and his cum shot out over them. So determined to finish Harry, he kept going and whimpering Harry’s name as the sensitivity grew too strong. Harry grunted and came, adding to their mess. Draco dropped his hand into the murky water and leaned his forehead onto Harry’s shoulder. Harry’s finger left his arsehole and trailed up and down his spine as they caught their breath.
Harry leaned over him, his umbrella charm covering them both as he huffed, “You’re so dramatic.”
“Worth it to see you this worked up, babe,” Harry assured in a husky voice that rumbled in his ear as Harry trailed his tongue down the shell to suck on the earlobe. Bastard knew what he was doing. Draco tried to squirm. He arched and wiggled and tried to press Harry down against his cock with his heel but Harry wasn’t budging more than what he controlled. Draco was hot all over despite not moving much to work up a sweat. But he was determined. Life may have taken him down a peg or three but he was still Draco Fucking Malfoy and Potter wasn’t going to win this. Harry tangled their tongues before he slowly began trailing down Draco's neck. His hot mouth suckled and nibbled on Draco’s collar bone like it was a treat he carried around on him specifically for Harry to enjoy. And boy did he enjoy it thoroughly before he traveled on down Draco’s sternum. Each kiss caused Harry to shift his whole body down dragging his cock slowly out of Draco. His hands twitched where they were still pinned above his head just begging to latch onto Harry’s hair and drag him back. If only he could tangle his fingers into those unruly locks, then he was sure he could command Harry to fuck him good. Harry paused right above him, his breath ghosting over Draco’s chest tickling him and making him pant with the need of contact. Draco's senses burned. He knew that Harry was giving him that smug “I won” smile. That fucker was wrong. He had not won. He could do this forever. Get fucked so painfully slow that no one was satisfied? Sure. No biggie for his pride. Potter had not won.
