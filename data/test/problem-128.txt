They take an open spot near Hermione, Su Li, and Padma Patil, who are in the midst of a discussion far too intellectual for this time of morning, in Harry’s opinion. He doesn’t even attempt to parse it as he loads up his plate with what is left of the breakfast platters. When there is a lull, Hermione shoots Harry a very knowing look over her muffin. Harry smiles at her lazily, briefly dropping his eyes to gaze admiringly at the curve of her breasts in that flattering sweater. She smirks at him and turns to Su with a rebuttal.
Hermione gets a pleased, flustered look on her face. She writes something on a little scrap of parchment and slides it his way. “That?” she asks, voice low.
“Yes, thank you, that’s all very well and good,” Draco replies with a laugh. “Would you mind terribly if I rode your cock now?”
Hermione looks up from her book – and
“Yeah,” Harry responds sheepishly. “Admittedly, it was a pretty stupid idea.”
SEVEN.
Malfoy looks for all the world as though he's enjoying a tasty dessert, humming and licking his fingers clean. When he's done, he adjusts his prick in his trousers and glares down at Harry. "Get
He blinks, looks away, tries not to drown in the wave of emotion washing over him. When he turns his head and sees the look on Hermione’s face, so startled and intrigued, and he kisses her. He knows Malfoy can feel the erratic pounding of his heart, knows Hermione can see that his eyes are maybe just the
It takes a second for her words to sink in, what with most of Harry’s blood having travelled directly to his cock. Then it clicks- Good Godric, they’re still in the Potions classroom! Far from dampening his arousal, the thought gives Harry a dirty, delightful feeling. But he snaps his wand out in a rush and tosses up all the privacy charms he can think of anyway. The Charms have little chance of keeping Slughorn or McGonagall out on the off-chance they should stop by, but at least they don’t have to worry about being interrupted by a fellow student.
sort of man?” This gives Harry pause. “Do I, Draco Abraxas Malfoy, seem to be in the habit of offering up things I don’t wish to give?”
Harry hadn’t really thought of it that way, and from the look on Hermione’s face, she hadn’t either.
Harry dips his fingers lower, slides them through her folds, gets them delightfully wet, and then returns to rub gentle circles against her clit. Malfoy tugs down his pants, thick prick spilling out at the same moment, and Hermione jerks in his arms, stuttering out a surprised-sounding moan. Malfoy clambers onto the bed and there is quite a bit of shuffling; these beds weren’t exactly intended to facilitate threesomes, more’s the pity. In the end, Malfoy is pressed tightly to Hermione’s front, face buried in her tits. Hermione’s right leg is draped over Malfoy’s hip, arms wrapped around his shoulders. Harry’s left arm is trapped and basically useless, but he’s still got his right arm between their bodies, hand in Hermione’s knickers, feeling her get ever wetter as she writhes, hot and sweat-slick, between them.
,” he says, can’t seem to stop saying.
Abruptly, Malfoy pulls out and pushes Hermione further up the bed. He climbs on after her, kneeling between her spread legs and yanking her hips toward him again. Malfoy looks up, catches Harry’s eye, and says a little breathlessly, “Salazar, Potter, are you still dressed?” And then he pushes his cock right back into Hermione’s pussy. From this new angle, Harry is able to see just about everything.
Harry turns his head to shoot Hermione a look, but she’s already perched on the edge of Malfoy’s desk, watching them with a glint in her eyes. Something about her heavy gaze makes Harry feel hot all over.
And Draco does, gloriously, fairly howling his pleasure. Harry holds on as his body twists and convulses, watches his cock spurt stream after stream of come high in the air.
She stops off at her own room to change out of her school uniform, and shows up at their door a few minutes later wearing a simple, clingy black dress. Its sleeves end at her braceleted wrists and its skirt ends at her black fuzzy slippers. Harry eyes her figure greedily, and Malfoy looks about ready to pounce, but she climbs onto Harry’s bed and makes herself comfortable sitting against his pillows.
“Harry!” she says with a smile, but it fades when she notices the sour look on his face. “I’ve been meaning to catch up with you lately, actually.” She steps up, not the least bit afraid of his mood, and threads her arm through one of his. “Let’s walk.”
“Harry and I would greatly appreciate it if you’d read to us from the Transfigurations text.” She stares him down in her typical fashion.
“Do you ever think about it?” She asks breathily. She looks over at him touching himself and gasps. “I’m guessing yes, then,” she says, laughing a little, hand still moving beneath her skirt.
Malfoy is, in fact, gathering up his things for a shower. Instead of hurrying off into the en-suite as usual, though, he begins undoing the cuffs of his shirt while standing right there in the room.
“But, no, not quite,” Hermione mutters, back arching as she rubs herself with purpose.
He crowds into her space, holds her against the bookcase behind her, and lets her have her way. She kisses him, dirty and hot and almost greedy. Harry lets his hands roam her sweet little body, marveling over his luck.
“Hermione and I are friends, Gin,” Harry replies, hedging a bit. It’s technically true, but…
Harry stands back, making sure not to make any shuffling noises.
Hermione sweeps in out of nowhere, though, yanking Malfoy’s head back by the hair and laying a filthy kiss on his swollen, pink mouth. From his position, Harry can see flashes of tongue, dripping spit and come.
When she and Harry sit together at meals – which is now only half of the time, because it appears they’d decided to split Harry 50/50 without even asking him – she smiles more, laughs more, and takes much greater pleasure in poking fun at Harry than ever before.
He’s beautiful, to be perfectly frank.
Eventually Hermione loses her patience. “Damn it, Malfoy!” she says, and he laughs and puts his mouth where she wants it. Happily, Harry is close enough to really take it in this time. Hermione seems particularly wound up already, but Malfoy takes his time, laving her with his tongue. He places a sucking kiss on her clit, plays with her slick lips with his mouth. Hermine’s enthusiastic reactions are starting to make Harry think he should be taking notes, actually, but then Malfoy turns and looks at him sideways.
Draco slouches in Harry’s lap, spreads his legs wide, shows Hermione that coveted little pucker.
Draco’s words have trailed into garbled noises, and Harry finds them particularly motivating. He fucks his tongue in and out of Draco’s wiggling arse, moans happily, and is distinctly satisfied when Draco comes explosively.
“Hi Harry,” she whispers tremulously.
And she does. Within minutes, both Harry and Draco are fully seated inside her. Harry can feel Draco’s thighs on either side of his legs, straining with the effort of keeping still. Harry’s not so strong, and bucks up into the wet heat of Hermione’s cunt. He knows Draco can feel his prick by the frayed little moan he lets out. That’s when Hermione starts to move on them, twisting her hips, encouraging them to move. Draco’s got the most freedom of movement in this position, and he takes full advantage; he starts to slowly pull out and thrust back in, then picks up more speed as Hermione’s moans get deeper.
Inside the classroom, Harry takes his usual seat beside Hermione. For a moment, he's terrified that he won't be welcome - either because he'd carelessly come inside her last night with neither warning nor permission, or because he'd sat with Ron at breakfast not 12 hours thereafter - but then she looks up at him with her usual smile.
Ginny gives Harry a few curious looks when she catches him grinning at nothing, but she asks no questions and he volunteers no answers.
He’s only about two steps into the room when Malfoy launches at Harry out of seemingly nowhere. Malfoy shoves him against the wall, bumping Harry’s head against the stone painfully. He considers protesting, but. Malfoy’s body is pressed all along his front, slim and hard and lean, and he’d quite like to see where this is headed, first.
. He spins around, throws his shoulders back, and struts through the doors. Malfoy clips confidently towards the Eighth Year table, giving every appearance of not noticing the eyes on him.
It feels newly shocking, newly filthy to realize that Hermione is entirely bare beneath her uniform skirt. Harry reaches into the pocket of his trousers, touches the soft damp cotton, and feels his face flush a bit. Malfoy shoots him a questioning look, but Harry’s only response is a secretive smile.
“Pitch is free!” Ron pipes up, stubbornly pretending he’s not seen what they both know he has seen.
!” She slashes her wand at Malfoy before he has a chance to react.
Is enough to make him rapidly, dizzyingly flaccid. Which is for the best, really.
“Very good,” she says approvingly, rolling her hips to chase the sensation of his thumb. “I’d quite like your cock, thanks for asking.”
Hermione’s academic competitiveness has not wilted one bit in the face of all the orgasms Harry has been giving her, and Harry finds that fact rather comforting.
“He loves how you taste,” Draco fairly growls at Hermione. “Listen to him.”
“What?” Malfoy asks muzzily. Then: “Salazar, Potter, nothing!”
Malfoy looks at Harry, all uncertain eyes and flushed cheeks, and Harry doesn’t want to discuss anything at all. He wants to take Malfoy to the Greenhouse and positively devour him. He wants Malfoy to forget he’d ever taken anyone else there. He wants Malfoy to never be able to look at a plant again without thinking of Harry.
Post-war, post-Voldemort, post-coming-back-from-the-dead, Harry can’t think of anything he wants less than to devote the rest of his life to the unceasing fight against evil. These days, he finds Charms to be a fascinating and challenging subject, and he’s hardly the only student in his year to experience a similar change of heart. Headmistress McGonagall has been making noises about creating a sort of post-graduate program to assist these students, but it hasn’t gained much traction.
Malfoy’s humiliation has grown in proportion to Blaise’s smile, oddly. “Shut up,” he tells Blaise, rather pathetically.
Instead, he shushes Harry, runs a gentle, almost tickling hand up his thigh. He hardly touches Harry’s prick at all, ghosts over his balls, and stops to tap a finger at his hole. “Here?” Malfoy asks lowly. “Is this where you need me?”
“Salazar help me,” Draco grouses. “Good night!”
Harry feels accomplished, proud, and so fucking hard it hurts. He drops down on his back next to Malfoy on the bed, pulls his cock out of his pants, and wanks furiously, licking come from his lips, Draco’s moans still echoing in his ear. It doesn’t take long, especially when Malfoy goads him on by telling him how good his mouth is, how he’d fuck it every day if he could. He comes explosively, squeezing his prick and gasping for air.
The photograph Malfoy hands him is of a gorgeous Queen Anne style home, in white with classy green accents. It is opulent, yes, but practically understated for a Malfoy home. “Looks nice.”
After a moment, she laughs. “Thought you were going to say Malfoy, to be honest.”
“Oh, do wipe that befuddled look off your face, Potter. You’ve only been teasing me with this thing all term,” Malfoy complains, reaching up to grope at Harry’s erection.
Harry just strokes her hair. He may or may not be waxing poetic about just how brilliant that had been, but neither of them comments on his effusiveness, so he doesn’t stop.
“Yes, I do recall,” Harry replies, rolling his eyes. “I was just thinking that it’s a subject worthy of…
“No,” Harry croaks now, still devastatingly aroused. He’s wondering if it’d ruin their friendship if he took out his cock and wanked with her lying right there. The idea alone should weird him out, but his prick twitches excitedly at the thought.
Hermione just shakes her head. “Honestly, Harry, I know very well that isn’t true.”
Malfoy’s glare melts away in an instant. He blinks at Harry, mouth opening and closing for a moment. “Sure,” he finally squeaks out.
Hermione shoots Harry a look. “Discussing me, were you?” she asks, taking a small bite of her muffin.
“I slept with her,” he blurts, cringing immediately.
Hermione groans, pushing back against him in a dirty grind and grabbing hold of his right hand. He leaves his left where it is, cupping and squeezing and caressing Hermione’s breast, and lets her drag his right hand where she wants it. Fingers partially laced, they trace together down her ribs, across her belly, to the waistband of her knickers, and then underneath.
He watches Malfoy clamber out of bed and stumble to the ensuite, griping something about ‘late’ and ‘breakfast’ and ‘shower,’ but nothing about Harry’s aching prick.
“Forget-!” Malfoy exclaims, horrified. He rubs a hand over his eyes. “‘Forget about the cupboard,’ he says,” he mutters, apparently to himself. “I will do no such thing, Potter, we will discuss ‘the cupboard’ at length! Another time.”
The day seems to drag on. Harry spends most of it in an aroused haze, but as the designated time finally nears, he finds himself unaccountably nervous. He chalks it up to his own inexperience, tries to hide it, but Hermione isn’t just the brightest witch of their age; she’s Harry best friend.
Harry balls his hands into fists, head thrashing. With his eyes closed, he is no longer confronted with the sight of his agonizingly hard prick waving in front of Malfoy’s eager face, but he can still feel him, still
Harry shakes his head emphatically. “No, I didn’t. I
“Yes, Potter, I’ll give you what you want.” Draco’s cock disappears for a long moment, and then is back, slipping wetly up and down between Harry’s arse cheeks. He only teases Harry for a second more, and the next, he’s pushing inside.
He has the sneaking suspicion they’ve left co-existence behind, but he’ll try to figure out what they are now some other time. Right now, he climbs into Draco’s bed, takes up too much space, nudges and elbows him, and generally makes a nuisance of himself until Draco releases an annoyed sigh and wraps his arms around Harry.
He doesn’t need, or even want, to possess Hermione. He wants what they have now, wants to love her just like this. Freely, warm and familiar, and hot, and sweet. He tells her this, kissing down her neck. He slides down the bed to kiss her tits just the way she likes.
, but Ron was unmoved. Said Hermione would soon come crawling back.
Shaken by his own thoughts, Harry responds to Hermione instead. He uses her wand to summon the text he’d found the spell in over the summer. “Found it in here, actually.”
"I'll not be missing breakfast because you're in the mood to show off your cock. Again," Malfoy informs him, and he almost sounds as annoyed as the Malfoy in Harry's fantasies. Except he's a bit breathless and his prick is very obviously fattening up within the confines of his trousers.
Harry holds her shaking body in his arms, moaning at the feel of her spasming around his cock. When she’s calmed a bit, Hermione lifts out of his lap and poses on her hands and knees, giving Harry a smirk over her shoulder. Not needing to be told twice, Harry lifts off his heels and pushes back inside her. He grabs hold of her hips and fucks her with abandon, snapping forward and listening to the lewd smacking of their flesh against each other. It’s not long before he shoves himself all the way inside and unloads. The whole time she’s moaning, “Yes, Harry,
Harry laughs too, deciding to save his embarrassment for later.
Harry ponders this contradiction all morning during classes, but even hours later the only thing he can say with any certainty is that he resents that bloody Concealment Charm.
She nods, and then remembers to speak: “Yes, yeah, right now.” She leans forward, holding Harry’s shoulders, and closes her eyes.
Hermione has to catch her breath. When she speaks again, he voicer is much softer. “Is that so, Draco? Do you want another finger?”
Harry feels his prick bump the back of Malfoy’s throat, and that’s pretty much it for him. Stars burst behind his eyelids and his hips jerk again and again, and he moans himself just about hoarse. It's the most intense, toe-curling orgasm of his life thus far, and Malfoy just keeps sucking him the entire way through.
“It’s not that,” Harry says. He’s not particularly looking forward to the inevitable mockery, but it’s probably for the best he get this off his chest now. “Just a bit… nervous.”
Malfoy still looks annoyed, but he rolls his eyes and slaps a phial of lubricant into Harry’s hand. He then reaches for his belt, unbuckling it whilst glaring at Harry. Harry watches greedily as Malfoy undoes his trousers, lowers them, and turns to bend over the workbench. Harry can hardly see Malfoy’s pale arse on display for him, but the thought of it makes him feel a deep and nameless
Ginny cuffs the back of his head. She ignores his sound of outrage. “Harry, you’re not the best at picking up on the subtleties of other people’s feelings. I know you’re dealing with a Slytherin, and a prickish one at that, but the best thing- the
“Er, no,” Harry answers, a bit taken aback to suddenly have everyone’s focus.
From within their privacy bubble, Hermione and Ron both raise their goblets distractedly. This is one of the many reasons they’re Harry’s very best friends.
Ginny looks newly shocked. “You told him how you felt and he told you he didn’t feel the same?”
He tells him, puts his lips to Draco’s ear and tells him he’s so good, he’s so hot, how is he even real?
He’s not a bit uncomfortable to have every inch of his flesh on display, rather, seems to particularly enjoy Harry’s admiring gaze. Harry takes in all the pale, pale skin, the fat, perfect cock pointing skyward. He feels a greedy urge to taste Malfoy’s cock, and he’s thinking about it so fervently that he doesn’t quite catch what Malfoy is saying.
From the raised eyebrows of their dining companions, it is equally clear to Hermione and Malfoy.
“You remember this morning, when Harry intuitively understood that my freedom is far more important to me than any romantic entanglements? Well here’s what I intuitively understand about Harry: All he’s ever wanted were good friends, a family, and a home. He’s got the first, and as for the last… well, leaving Hogwarts is going to be quite difficult for him.”
“It’ll likely be less frightening if Ron and Malfoy come this time,” Hermione reasons, letting go of Harry’s hand to dig in her bag. Probably in search of a book.
Harry can’t help but give his prick a squeeze through his trousers, watching Hermione quiver and moan as she comes under Draco’s skilled mouth. She’s so- she’s like a piece of art, like something surreal he’d never begin to think he deserved. They’re both so bloody hot, Harry has no idea what he’s doing here, but he’s not about to leave any time soon.
join her in the library more often.
Malfoy waits patiently, but they’ve quickly reached the end of Harry’s knowledge about how airplanes stay airborne despite their incredible weight and size. Once this dawns on Malfoy, he seems disturbed. He seems about to speak, visibly reconsiders, and eventually turns back to his lunch.
“Right,” Harry replies, but then gets distracted kissing her neck all over again.
They don’t bother to respond. Harry is staring at the canopy over Malfoy’s bed and attempting to gather his wits about him.
Only, Hermione’s tie and shirt are both gone, and she is teasing a tantalizingly peaked nipple through the entirely sheer material of her black bra. Harry’s cock jerks alarmingly at the sight, but he finds himself incapable of looking away. Hermione watches Malfoy’s head bobbing over Harry’s cock eagerly, pinching her nipple with a breathless moan.
Harry huffs a tiny laugh, but dutifully obeys. He experiments with much softer, flickering licks, and finds Hermione is much more responsive to those. She moans, and rolls her hips, and tell him just how good it feels. Harry’s starting to get the hang of it, possibly, when Malfoy nudges him. He turns, spots Malfoy standing there completely bare and loses focus.
“I know, Harry, I just. Is it right?”
Harry whines at the reminder that Hermione’s arse has also been spread wide by this fantastic prick. At the reminder of what they’d got up to two nights ago. “It’s so much,” he whispers back, praying Draco doesn’t take that as a complaint.
“Ugh,” Harry groans. “What have I got myself into, Gin?”
Harry can hardly hear any of it over the buzzing in his ears. He vaguely notices Ron storming from the room, but mostly he’s thinking he should probably sit down before anyone notices his reaction to seeing Hermione behave that way.
Draco slings his arms round Harry’s neck, and Harry can’t help but arch his neck for a filthy kiss, tongues tangling. He’s so- they’re so
“Harry!” Hermione huffs, exasperated and amused.
That's when it gets much better than Harry's fantasies, because Malfoy swiftly stuffs two fingers into Harry's open mouth, pushing deep. "Suck," Malfoy commands, and hearing the obscene word in Malfoy's crisp tones has Harry's eyes squeezing shut.
Draco smirks and does as he’s told, settling on his hands and knees on the bed, giving Harry the most magnificent close up view.
(See the end of the chapter for
Up at the Head Table, Headmistress McGonagall's lips are pursed disapprovingly. "Five points from Gryffindor for disrupting breakfast," she says crisply, ostensibly to Ginny. Her icy glare is directed at Ron, though.
Malfoy’s very best Disillusionment Charm isn’t quite good enough to fool friends who’ve known him his entire life, it seems.
“What is it, brat? Something else you want?” Harry doesn’t know where it comes from, but it feels bloody good to talk to him this way.
Is Harry meant to stop? That's generally what one does when caught wanking after all, but this isn't anything like that time Neville had caught Harry in the bathroom in the middle of the night 6th year, trousers around his ankles and a finger up his own bum. Malfoy's literally eaten Harry's come, and-
The thing is, Harry and Hermione have always been friends first. He cares about her, loves her, and would very obviously not be here without her having repeatedly saved his arse over the years. He knows her dreams, her ambitions, and the things that keep her up at night. That’s what best friends do. Sure, he’s noticed that she’s beautiful and smart and possessing of a gorgeous body; who doesn’t know when they’ve got a hot best friend?
“Hermione,” Harry murmurs. “I’d never begrudge you your freedom. You must know that.”
“Me too!” Hermione replies, sounding rather more excited than anxious.
“Is it good, baby?” Harry asks in a low voice. Draco whines out a yes.
“Yes,” Harry whispers after a moment. “I had. And I was so tired, that I thought. Just for a moment, I considered staying. But I’m glad I didn’t.”
Harry blinks. He’s sure the Cloak is fully covering him, so he can’t imagine why his name has been brought into this.
? He needs Hermione, has relied upon her for years. And now, he's lost his virginity and potentially impregnated a girl, and he can't even talk to either of his best friends about it. Fuck.
“Harry,” she mewls. “I need you.”
“Ah!” Malfoy exclaims. “So it’s guilt, then?”
She looks up at him, rather self-satisfied, and lifts her hand away from her cunt. “We were just talking about you,” she says, reaching up and unbuttoning her blouse the rest of the way.
“An orphan raised by an aunt and uncle who despised him. I’m not going to get into to the rest of what he’s been through; you know plenty. All I’m going to say is this: either figure out how to give Harry the love he deserves, or step aside for someone who can.”
“God, yes,” Harry responds, caught by the image of Malfoy opening him up with that fat prick of his. The thought of lying beneath him, being held down, made to just take it, makes Harry feel hot all over. “Want you to,” he adds, rutting hard against Malfoy and biting down.
Draco Malfoy is standing above him, and he's not quite managing to sneer - the loveliest blush is spilling across his nose and cheeks - but Harry's prick appreciates the effort. His hand speeds up and a moan slips out, drawing Malfoy's gaze to meet his own. He looks surprised, turned on. Needy. Nonetheless, he tries to imitate his usual self and snaps, "Hurry it up, Potter." His voice is notably huskier than usual.
It’s charming, in its own right, but just to be a shit, Harry tells him it’s nice.
, he thinks, taking himself in hand with an air of resignation. Then he hears the shower come on, and notices that Malfoy has left the door open.
“Frankly, I don’t see how it’s any of your concern with whom I spend my time.” It’s clear that Hermione is trying to sound casual, but she misses the mark. “
“With us again, Potter?”
Malfoy seems surprised to hear this, but only hesitates for a moment before shifting off of Harry. He misses the weight, the press of him immediately, but then Malfoy’s wand taps the waistband of his boxer briefs. The next second, they’re gone, and Harry shivers delightfully at the feeling. He leaves his wrists exactly where Malfoy had pressed them, imagining he can still feel Malfoy’s iron grip holding him in place. He spreads his legs wide, feeling a blush rise on his face, grateful all over again for the darkness in the room. Malfoy lies on his side, curled around Harry. He lifts Harry’s right leg, already bent with knee pointed to the ceiling, and drapes it over Malfoy’s waist, spreading Harry out even wider.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Studying on a Friday afternoon, honestly,” he says dismissively, but reaches for the requested book.
Pansy’s eyes are wide open now, and she leans forward with interest.
Harry doesn’t hide his grimace quickly enough.
with Malfoy, so he says nothing.
Masturbation would have been a far more enjoyable use of his time.
“Oh God,” Harry breathes, collapsing on his arse. He’s fucking spent. And then the moment gets even more brilliant: he remembers that he gets to have this, for the foreseeable future.
“God,” Harry says, bucking into Hermione’s tightening grip. She squeezes him just right, moaning and rolling her body on top of his, and then she whines with loss. Harry has no idea what’s happening, until Draco’s soaking wet fingers are at his lips. He licks them, tastes Hermione, and slurps them into his mouth with a moan.
Brilliant doesn’t begin to describe it, really.
His worries are in vain, though, because once he's finally ready, Malfoy just picks up his book bag and silently follows Harry out the door and down the stairs. More silent coexistence, then. Harry finds this comforting, in light of what he'll likely have to deal with today.
Ron blushes bright red at their attentions and sends the girl a wave instead of trying to speak around his mouth full of sandwich.
“Me?” Malfoy asks, but it’s mostly lost in the shuffle as everyone begins to leave for class. Benches scrape across the floor loudly and younger students race past yelling and laughing.
“Salazar, give me strength,” he grumbles, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Gentle, Potter. There’s about a thousand nerve endings in that little nub; a bit of stimulation can go a long way.”
Not that he wants to belong to Draco Malfoy or anything.
“Well?” She asks, doing a more than passable imitation of Malfoy’s usual entitled impatience.
the phenomenon. “Well, I expect it has to do with petrol and really large engines?” It’s not the most intelligent sentence Harry has uttered in the past day, for sure, but it’s also not the least.
The fat head of Draco’s prick feels significantly larger than his fingers, but Harry feels greedy for it, even if it is rather a lot to take.
Harry says the only thing he can think to say: “Slut.” His voice comes out husky, and Draco shudders deliciously beneath him.
Harry deliberately casts his mind back to about 15 minutes ago, when he slipped his soap-slicked cock between Malfoy’s tightly clenched thighs, hips bouncing off Malfoy’s slippery arse, and wanked the blushing blond to a second wailing orgasm. He feels his mouth curve into a salacious, satisfied grin, and doesn’t fight it down. He’d not be who he was if he didn’t still enjoy annoying the piss out of Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy gives a delicate shrug. The other Slytherins seem to get more out of this small gesture than Harry can divine; they seem rather shocked, in fact.
“Yes,” Harry answers simply. He doesn’t mention that being ripped away from his life was what he’d spent all 11 of those years dreaming of.
, Ronald Weasley, and fast! Or I'm telling Mum!"
Draco responds to it beautifully, pouty and seductive. “Cock. I want your cock in me. I’m so empty,” he complains.
Draco takes his fingers back and sets about making Hermione come on them, loudly and happily. Her grip on Harry’s prick loosens as she does, or he’d have surely come with her. But moments later, she puts her lips to Harry’s ear and says, “On top of me, Harry.”
No. No, in fact, he does not. Harry is about to speak, but Malfoy goes on.
Harry jolts awake sometime later with Malfoy standing over him. His Charms textbook is in his lap, there’s a crick in his neck, and for some reason, Malfoy looks almost... fond? Harry rubs his eyes because, clearly, he is not fully awake. But no matter how much he shakes himself, and even discreetly pinches himself, Malfoy still seems to be hiding a tiny smile for the duration of their walk down to the Great Hall.
“Yes! Of course, yes.” He’d thought it was a given that he was in.
Harry’s got very little room to move but is hardly complaining. Between the feeling of Draco’s cock nudging against his, and the feeling of Hermione’s sultry body writhing between them, he’s well on his way to climaxing. Mostly he just looks up at Hermione and thinks about how breath-taking she is, how incomprehensibly enthralling.
still his best mate. He knows just about everything there is to know about Harry, up to and potentially including his recent interest in showing off his dick to Malfoy.
“He’s rather fit these days, isn’t he?” Hermione asks, sighing again and squirming a little. “Did you
to come. He has to.
They sit side by side on Malfoy’s bed, and Malfoy pulls out a stack of photographs. “I’ve contracted some renovations on one of my properties in London. The Wizarding Corner of Chelsea, of course.”
“I’m-” well, sorry isn’t
, and she’s wearing nothing but her uniform skirt, and Harry can’t imagine what he’s done to deserve this.
Who could have imagined it would be so nice to be held by Draco Bloody Malfoy?
Harry does not have a single defense for his actions, but Malfoy doesn’t give him a chance to respond either way. “Relentlessly,” Malfoy tells Hermione conversationally, giving Harry’s cock a gentle squeeze. “It’s been an unending torment: The Chosen One flaunting his prick in my face morning, noon and night.”
Draco hums, leans back in to pleasure her with his mouth, and pushes a slim, long finger past the tight ring of muscle. Hermione sighs, pushes against the intruding finger, but he doesn’t appear to be moving it much. He just keeps at licking her sweet cunt until she’s properly grinding against his mouth. Only then does he start to really finger her, twisting and pushing deep, and by then she’s already requesting a second digit. “Are you going to rush us every step of the way?” he grumbles, pushing a second finger inside her.
last under this pressure, especially with Hermione watching with dark eyes, legs spread, still toying with her dripping cunt. “I- Fuck, Draco, I’m gonna come,” he warns, just barely holding on.
Harry, who’s not ridden a broom for fun in ages, jumps at the opportunity. They head down to the Quidditch Pitch and pass an hour or two in the fading sunlight, practicing daring maneuvers and laughing at one another. Ron’s gaze skitters away every time he makes eye contact with Harry, but he’s giving his most valiant effort to pretend that everything is fine. Harry enjoys himself immensely.
Malfoy stirs his soup a bit, but it’s clear he hasn’t much of an appetite. “You went to visit your parents’ graves?” he asks very quietly, almost like he expects to be ignored.
an insufferable arsehole. I must be insane-” he breaks off to kiss and bite his way across Harry’s jaw.
So much for that.
matter, in this moment?”
been hit in the face. His jaw hangs open uselessly, and before he can gather his words to say anything in response, Hermione spins around to face Zabini, who is standing just behind her.
He’s so turned on, he has to sit back on his heels and try to remember what it was he’d wanted to do to Draco here. Oh, right: devour him. Harry smirks and digs the phial of lube out of his pocket with one hand, the other caressing and squeezing Draco’s twitching arse.
“Had enough yet, Malfoy?” Hermione asks, twisting her hand in a way that makes Draco’s whole body jerk.
When Hermione rises from the other end of the table and leaves, Harry makes a hasty excuse about needing to go to the library and scampers off behind her. She hardly seems to notice his presence at all, but Harry sits with his best friend and Goldstein and Nott and MacMillan and scribbles a very rough draft of his Transfigurations paper for a while. It’s not his best work – parts of it not even legible – but makes for a nice enough distraction.
In the ensuing silence, Harry wonders just how furious Ron will be when he learns about last night. Considering Ron's current turmoil, there's a good chance Harry's got another week or so before Ron notices. But that's only if it doesn't happen again. And when one takes into account the signals Hermione and Malfoy have been sending out all day, to say nothing of his assisted wank this morning, it seems nearly inevitable that they'll do it again. It's rather unlikely Harry will be able to keep repeated instances of sex with Hermione and Draco bloody Malfoy secret for very long, all things considered.
When the world comes back into focus, he’s got Hermione’s pants in his left hand and come all over his shirt and tie. Hermione is lying in exactly the same spot, but she’s looking up at Malfoy. He’s emerged from the bathroom dripping wet, prick thick and pointed skyward. Malfoy, unlike Harry, can see exactly what Hermione is doing between her legs and is staring, transfixed.
“You want-” Draco gulps for air. “You want us both inside you, one in your cunt, one in your arse.”
Why someone as gorgeous as Hermione – whose options are literally endless at this point – is choosing to spend her time with Harry is beyond him, but he’s certainly not about to question her on it.
Surprisingly, it’s Malfoy who fails to be casual. "Potter, what...?” he whispers, something horrified lurking in his gaze. He reaches, hesitantly, and traces the circle of braided skin in the center of his chest.
Malfoy kisses, nibbles at his neck, and Harry cries out his name helplessly. Malfoy lingers there, sucking and scraping his teeth over Harry’s skin, and Harry just knows there will be a bruise there tomorrow. He knows he’s making rather a lot of noise, but he cant seem to make himself stop. Finally, Malfoy brings his lips back to Harry’s ear and asks again, “What do you need, Potter?”
“Weasley,” Malfoy says, smirking faintly as always.
He strokes her face, pets her side, tells her how utterly dazzling she is. Her breath shudders, and Harry kisses her sweetly, tells her again that she’s brilliant, completely sexy, he’s not even sure how he’s not come yet.
And now Harry's going to have to walk into Transfigurations with a halfie. He glares at Malfoy.
Harry follows at a much more leisurely pace, well-aware that they’re not all
“All right, mate?” Ron asks.
“Nngh- No,” Harry says, now blatantly lying. He tries again to escape, though he’s not sure why.
“Harry, help me up,” she says, and Malfoy stops thrusting but keeps hold of her hips.
Harry laughs too, and regretfully lets go of Draco to search for Hermione’s beaded bag. He’d given up being surprised by Hermione’s preparedness months ago, but it’s still hilarious that she’s brought lubricant in her purse. He happily uncorks the phial and pours rather a lot of lube onto his fingers, and they’re sloppy and dripping just how he himself likes it when he brings his fingers back to stroke Draco’s arsehole. Draco cries out, arching his back, and not slowing down the rocking of his hips. Draco’s hole is tight, yet accepts the intrusion so sweetly that Harry’s prick throbs. He peers around at Draco’s flushed face, watches him lavish his feverish attentions on Hermione’s trembling body, and fucks his finger in counterpoint to Draco’s rhythm. Harry holds out for as long as he can, watches Draco and Hermione work themselves into a frenzy, and then pulls his finger out, adjusts angles, and pushes two fingers back inside. Draco cries out, clenches ecstatically on the intruding fingers, and then yells when Harry hooks his fingers and starts rubbing, partially on and partially off his prostate. He should feel bad, but he’s too smug watching Draco’s rhythm falter, stutter, and come to a halt as he comes deep in Hermione’s cunt.
He shakes his head on a long groan, arcing his hips up in supplication. Harry speaks before he realizes he’s going to. “He wants another,” he says, voice practically a growl.
“Hmmm,” Hermione hums, kicking off her shoes and drawing her socked feet up on to the bed, knees bent. Her plaid skirt slides up, revealing much more of her smooth brown legs than Harry is accustomed to seeing.
Does she mean to penetrate Draco with a dildo whilst Harry penetrates her from behind?
“Ugh.” Having entirely forgotten about his earlier conversation with Ron, Harry grunts unhappily at the reminder. He's too satisfied to be really upset, but he doesn’t love being made to feel like having a chat with his best mate is some sort of crime. “He was going to find out sooner or later, Malfoy,” he offers mildly, watching Malfoy bend over to retrieve some fresh pants out of his trunk. Godric, he’s
They've left the Common Room and are walking down the stone hallway toward the Great Hall before Ron looks around and says, “I think I’ve really cocked things up with Hermione, mate.”
It’s fine that they’re roommates, really. They just don’t talk, for the most part. Initially, they’d each spent as much time away from their shared room as possible, but once they’d figured out that neither of them particularly wanted to maintain their legendary animosity, they’d managed to just… coexist. And then, they’d begun to coexist in the Common Room. And then they’d begun to coexist in the Great Hall from time to time. They’d even coexisted in the library once or twice, one or the other of them sitting down at the same table and silently studying nearby, but not quite together. It’s totally not weird at all, aside from the fact that Harry’s dick seems more alert and active than ever before. Also, he keeps getting the urge to show it to Malfoy, for some reason.
He wants, desperately, to see them.
, she rolls and rises up on her hands and knees above Harry. She’s close enough to kiss, and he’s trying to remember why he shouldn’t, but then she’s leaning down and taking his mouth in a filthy kiss. She moans loudly, back arching when Malfoy starts fucking into her from behind. They keep kissing for a while, more tongue than anything else, until the force of Malfoy’s thrusts pushes her further up the bed. Suddenly, her tits are dancing in Harry’s face and he’s pulling on his cock again, sucking and kissing at them. Between Harry’s mouth and Malfoy’s prick, Hermione is moaning and growling and sounding very much like she’s headed towards another orgasm. Harry can’t think, is so turned on, fucking into the circle of his fist as he sees Malfoy’s hips speed up.
“Mal,” Bulstrode replies gruffly, but it’s not clear if the glare is accompanied by genuine malice, or just a general distaste for mornings. The Slytherins are far from perky in the mornings. Harry has long suspected it had to do with spending most of their time residing underground. Bulstrode turns to Harry then, and greets him with an openly suspicious, “Potter.”
Malfoy goes on: “You then had our customs hammered into your mind, given only the education deemed worthwhile by a council of ancient wizards, and will now graduate with a degree that is entirely useless where you come from. You can never go back.”
“We’ll fill you up,” Draco says on a moan. “Both your holes dripping with hot come-” And then he arches up against Harry, swelling even bigger and hotter in his hand, and bursts. Hot come splashes over Harry’s fist, dribbles across his wrist, and Harry can hear Hermione coming too, their sweet sounds of pleasure mingling into a cacophony that makes Harry’s eyes pinch shut. His hips keep rolling against Malfoy, and he’s not even doing it intentionally, but he can’t seem to stop.
Remembering this, Harry finds himself slipping out of his pants and shoving back his blankets. He should be getting out of bed right now, but he's feeling like this won't take very long at all. Harry spreads his legs and gets a firm grip on his achingly hard prick.
After a blissfully uneventful dinner wherein Ron is particularly boisterous and debating Quidditch with anyone who will engage him, they head back up to the Eighth Year Common Room.
Hermione nudges him several times but Harry’s mind refuses to focus on what Professor Flitwick is saying down in front. When it comes time to practice, Harry discovers that his grasp on concentrated weather charms is actually rather impressive. When he is called upon to demonstrate, Professor Flitwick takes the time to remark upon Harry’s recent improvement in the subject. Harry spends the entire conversation trying not to laugh at the furious glare Hermione is directing his way. It doesn’t help that Malfoy is in the row just behind, snickering quietly, but Harry holds up admirably.
Arseholes, the both of them.
“God, Malfoy,” Harry groans, watching this ethereal beauty get his pleasure from Harry’s throbbing cock. He won’t- he
“Oh God,” Harry groans, rutting shamelessly against Draco’s leg and jerking him off with short, fast strokes.
about last night (and this morning)? Harry hopes like hell that won't happen. What on Earth would he say, anyway?
the one who ended things between us,” she adds reasonably.
When Malfoy can take no more of this, he finally tells them to shut up.
Harry sighs, but they both ignore him.
He has little trouble getting back to sleep after that.
“As much as I hate to interrupt,” Hermione says, and she really does sound regretful, “we should probably get out of here.” When Harry looks, he finds her fully dressed again, but her hair is still gratifyingly disheveled.
Malfoy pushes in, gasps when Harry doesn’t resist at all.
Ron, quite red in the face, responds nastily, “Yeah, and you’re unlikely to get me back, slagging around with the Slytherins like this!”
“I see,” Blaise says faintly, but it’s mostly drowned out by everyone heading off to classes.
Mill whistles. “Impressive, Granger, congrats.” It’s the longest sentence Mill’s uttered so far, and Harry doesn’t quite get it until Hermione sits down next to Harry with a muffin in hand.
Hermione folds her arms imperiously and gives Ron her most impatient look. Ron fumbles to finish chewing and bring up their modified privacy charm, with about as much grace as he is capable of.
Harry disagrees, vehemently. He unlaces and removes Draco’s shoes, takes off his trousers, and tugs him down to the ground.
"Because she fraternizes with Slytherins??" Malfoy bursts out incredulously.
Malfoy’s fucking amazing mouth will likely be the death of him.
He moans loudly around Malfoy's fingers, sucking greedily and pumping his hand over his prick. He's going to come, really,
“Sure,” Harry replies, not hiding his confusion.
When she’s calm again, she gives a deeply satisfied hum and pats Harry’s hand. He gives her pussy one last stroke and then withdraws from her knickers. He’s thinking about sucking his fingers clean, but Malfoy snatches his hand out of the air seeker-fast and pops Harry’s soaking wet fingers into his mouth. Hermione moans at the sight and Harry gasps, cock twitching.
“I see,” Blaise says, sounding rather impressed. Then he addresses Harry again. “Listen, Potter, we’re not asking to you betray any confidences. But give us something?”
And then, beautifully, she undoes the rest of the buttons. Shows Harry her lacy navy blue bra, asks, “Are these distracting you?”
Bulstrode has always had a rather androgynous appearance, and Harry can’t remember the last time anyone had used gendered pronouns to refer to them. Mill very nearly cracks a smile at this, and says with some relish, “Haz.”
It’ll have to do for now.
“Yes,” Hermione moans, thrashing. Harry ruts against her arse happily, rubbing harder between her legs as she begins to quiver. Her moans rise steadily, possibly due to some slick magic Malfoy is working with his tongue, but maybe the combined results of their efforts. She gets louder, and Harry can’t help but echo her, reveling in the sumptuous slide of her body against his. She crests, her voice rising until it breaks off, her body shaking deliciously between the two of them. Harry presses his fingers against her clit, letting her buck and squirm and twitch against them to her heart’s content.
Sadly, it’s only Crookshanks, but he’s glad to see her anyway.
He shifts, turns, and tries to trick his body into falling back asleep. It’s no use though. He sighs quietly and turns over again. Maybe slipping off to the en suite really is his best option, and he’s trying to talk himself into leaving the cozy warmth of Malfoy’s bed when Malfoy huffs and stills his fidgeting with firm hands.
“Amazing. You’re amazing,” Harry tells him, loathe to relinquish his hold.
Hermione seems to be enjoying herself immensely, eyes bright and engaged as she pushes three fingers in Draco’s arse and curls them. Draco cries out, fucking himself on them, his prick fat and leaking on his belly.
Hermione is still saying things about Malfoy – how sexy he is, how fat his cock is, how she wants him to fill her up with it, how he’s probably in the shower right now doing exactly what they’re doing out here – and Harry topples right over the edge. He probably being quite loud about it, it’s just that he’s coming so bloody hard, milking his cock, and he can’t really hear much of anything.
“Okay,” Harry agrees. When he looks up, he finds Hermione at the end of the bed again.
“To the Muggle world?” Harry clarifies needlessly. “I expect not,” he muses. “As far as they’re concerned, my education stopped at age 11. I’m a grade school drop-out,” Harry adds with a chuckle, despite it hardly being funny at all.
“Haz,” Mill says knowingly, apparently correcting Parkinson.
She and Ron had avoided visiting Harry and Malfoy’s room for the first month of term, but after their breakup, Hermione had decided that avoiding Ron was much more important to her. She’d stormed in unannounced, much like today, and interrupted Harry and Malfoy’s determinedly silent coexistence by glaring at Malfoy and stating, “I’d like an apology!”
It’s taking every ounce of Harry’s self-control not to stroke himself through his trousers, and Malfoy is not exactly helping his efforts. He smirks lazily as he unbuckles and removes his belt. Malfoy unbuttons his trousers and boldly turns around, giving Harry a full view of his arse through his royal blue boxer briefs as he bends down to fully remove said trousers. He stands, shooting Harry a burning look over his shoulder, and then repeats the same process with his pants.
Hermione pulls away from her audibly wet kiss with Draco to ask, “Harry? Is it…? Is it okay?”
To be honest, Harry had also found Hermione’s determined mingling with the Slytherins to be odd, but he knew better than to actually confront her about it. Besides, he isn’t exactly one to talk, is he?
Ron did not take that well, to say the least. They began to argue almost daily. Harry, who had foolishly assumed that this would be a peaceful year with drastically less drama, tried in vain to stay the hell out of it. And then, Ron decides to dump Hermione. He confides in Harry that this is actually part of a master plan to get Hermione to ‘fix her act’.
A cold splash runs down Harry's opposite arm, and he turns back to find that Ginny Weasley has approached from behind and upended an entire glass of pumpkin juice over her brother's head.
Harry reflects for a moment, hyper-aware of Malfoy closely watching him. He's always like this when Ginny comes up in conversation, but Harry tries not to overthink what that may mean. "Well, yes, in the sense that it didn't much feel like I'd expected it to. But did I break up with her under false pretenses and then sling sexist insults at her in front of our peers?" Harry gives him a pointed look, and finally Ron begins to look appropriately sheepish. "No, it was not like that, and if it had been, you'd have kicked my arse from here all the way to London."
When Flitwick toddles off to extinguish a small fire down at Seamus’s end of the classroom, Harry innocently asks Hermione if she would like some tutoring to help get her up to speed.
Harry slips halfway off Malfoy’s body, wedges himself against the wall so he can get access to the front of Malfoy’s trousers. He rests his head on Draco’s firm chest, one leg still tangled with Draco’s, and peers across the gap at his own bed. Hermione has drawn up the skirt of her dress, already has a hand in her black knickers.
When Malfoy finally joins him, Harry is enjoying his delightfully hearty meal with gusto. Malfoy quirks an eyebrow at the nearby conversation that neither of them can hear, but Harry declines to explain. They sit side by side, quietly enjoying their meal.
They’re so fucking dirty. He can hardly believe his luck.
Even Ron should be able to see that this would be a good time to stay quiet, but it seems he can’t help himself. “Well that’s just disgusting,” he spits.
Harry can’t see much from this angle, but he can tell from the languid rolling of Draco’s hips that she’s quite skilled. He watches Hermione take Draco apart bit by bit until Draco cranes his neck and kisses the corner of Harry’s mouth. Harry turns, catches his sweet lips in an off-centre, but no less hot kiss. Draco moans against his lips, flickers his tongue into Harry’s mouth, and bucks wildly in Harry’s arms.
Harry isn’t left to wonder for long. Draco draws his wand, aims a quick unlacing spell at his shoes and steps out of his trousers, stands before them half-hard, flushed pink, and completely nude. Draco sees something in Harry’s open-mouthed stare that puts a self-satisfied smirk on his face, then promptly straddles Harry’s lap and sits on his prick.
“Did you only come once?” he asks. Harry is perfectly fine with his one explosive orgasm deep inside Draco’s arse, but he’d be more than happy to get Hermione off before she heads off for the night.
As it turns out, one of Hermione’s hidden desires is to have both of them, at the same time. Draco swells in Harry’s hand when she mentions this, and Harry gives him a good squeeze. Draco asks a few clarifying questions: does she mean one cock in her mouth, the other in her cunt?
When Harry’s senses come back to him, he blinks his eyes open to see Malfoy shooting him a smug, cum-smeared grin from the floor. He’s just come in Malfoy’s mouth and the Slytherin Prince is fucking grinning about it. The chances that all of this is just a particularly convincing hallucination have just gone up drastically. But while he’s here... he has a very vivid image of himself licking and sucking that mess right out of Malfoy’s mouth, and he’s going to do it as soon as his limbs are obeying commands once more. Any moment now.
And it occurs to Harry, slowly, that maybe this was never just co-existence in the first place.
The rest of the night is pretty much normal, although Harry does have a rather weird dream. It started as a re-telling of their adventures in the Greenhouse, only confusing and sinister and murky like only dreams can be. Draco had been leading Harry to the back of the Greenhouse, when the twists and turns of the aisles has become more and more elaborate. The foliage around had gotten taller and thicker until Harry realized, with a sinking feeling, that they had somehow entered a frighteningly familiar hedge maze. Harry had rushed to catch up, but Draco had turned a corner out of sight, and when Harry had tried to shout for him to come back, his voice would only come out a whisper.
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy croaks miserably into the darkness.
Eventually, Ron speaks. “I was working my way towards giving you my blessing. I was going to tell you not to wait too long, because a girl like Hermione isn’t going to sit on the shelf for very long... guess that’s unnecessary now.”
“Right, resistance,” Harry repeats with a firm nod.
Hermione pulls away, gets a good look at the lust-addled expressions on both their faces, and smirks. She raises an eyebrow at them, reaching behind to unzip her plaid uniform skirt. It falls to the floor, pools around her socked feet, and Harry just stares some more. To be fair, she’s quite a sight. Clad in sheer bra and matching knickers, and her wonted over the knee socks, she looks like something out of a half-forgotten wet dream. Saliva pools in Harry’s mouth as he takes in her gentle curves, the sassy tilt of her hips, all that smooth brown skin on display. Hermione spins on one heel and slinks towards Malfoy’s bed. Malfoy rises to follow immediately, all flushed cheeks and eager hands. Harry tries to trail along, but is foiled spectacularly by his tangled trousers and pants.
want Malfoy to come along, but there’s hardly any need to admit that just now.
, Harry’s all the way inside, and it feels- he can’t think, it’s so fucking good.
Malfoy looks up from the ledger he’s been pouring over at his desk, expression entirely neutral.
Having not at all expected Hermione to willingly go along, Harry find himself feeling a bit emotional. “Sure,” he says, blinking furiously.
The look Malfoy gives him leaves Harry feeling mystified. “I wouldn’t say so,” he says carefully.
Malfoy picks up on this, dispenses with the gentle touch, curls his fingers mercilessly.
Harry sighs quietly, wondering how the hell he’s supposed to get any work done with his prick hard and leaking in his trousers.
“Thank you, Mill. I’d heard about your Potions Master apprenticeship! Congrats, yourself.”
Malfoy hastily cuts him off, cheeks flushed. "But you needn't commit to any of that now! Right now, I know you've no plans for after Hogwarts. And you likely have several options. But this is one." He gestures between them. "Just this. We can carry on doing exactly this, if you want. Because it's what I want."
“Of course,” Harry repeats with a slight roll of the eye.
Harry’s body is quite awake now, though, so he gets out of bed as well. He takes a long, leisurely shower, and thinks about what illicit acts he’d like to learn next. He wonders if he should add a few more things he’d not initially thought of, such as Draco plowing his arse from behind while Hermione grinds her pussy on his tongue like she’d done to Malfoy yesterday afternoon. His mind wanders, but he feels no need to indulge in a wank for the time being. When he comes out of the en suite, Hermione is lounging on his bed stroking her pussy.
He peels back the duvet, and Hermione takes that as her queue to climb into bed. She’s shaking. He wraps his arms around her, and doesn’t bother asking whether she’s had a nightmare. Slowly, she calms in his embrace. A few minutes later she slides off him a little, just until she’s leaning against Malfoy.
“No, I suppose you were too busy checking out his arse and touching yourself,” she says thoughtfully.
Malfoy flinches slightly, but doesn’t blush or stammer.
Harry, graceless and randy, lifts her just enough to angle his prick up, and then lets her rock back down on it. They moan out simultaneously, and something about Draco Malfoy’s molten silver gaze, the fact that he’s about to join them, makes it feel nothing like what they did yesterday.
And then, gradually, Harry finds himself being deliciously pinned down by both of them. His shirt has disappeared, and Hermione’s legs are wrapped around one of his own, half her weight on top of him. She kisses him, long and slow, her hips squirming against him as she gets more and more swept up in the moment. Draco is on him too, one leg draped over Harry’s other leg, his erection prodding Harry’s hip while he focuses his attention on Harry’s exposed neck. There are hands stroking his chest, playing with his nipples, running up his thigh, tickling his belly button. Hermione sits up suddenly, shifts in the dark. He hears her murmur a Silencing Charm and set her wand down somewhere. When she lays back down, her shirt is gone.
It’s quiet after that. Despite himself, Harry relaxes. Hermione turns a page. Malfoy sighs, breath gusting pleasantly across Harry’s chest. Harry closes his eyes, doesn’t think about what the hell is happening here, and falls asleep between one breath and the next.
Malfoy pulls to an abrupt stop just outside the doors, glaring at Harry. “Can you not at least
“Hm?” Harry asks absently.
Caught out and awash with guilt, Harry nods, just barely. He shouldn’t be surprised that Ron knows, but he is. “I’m
“Ah!” Harry cries, pushing forward into Hermione and back onto those brilliant fucking fingers.
He's right, of course. Hermione and Malfoy manage to flirt in utter silence throughout double Transfigurations, lunch and Herbology. Between the heavy looks, suggestive handling of dirt and quills and wands, and - Godric, he doesn't even want to think it -
Draco strokes fingers over Harry’s hole, dribbles lube down it, pushes two fingers inside.
He obeys, happily. Pushes his cock an inch inside her, dazzled by how hot and wet she is for him. “Hermione,” he murmurs, trying to find the words to tell her how it feels and coming up short. He pushes in further, watches her mouth drop in a perfect “O” of pleasure. He thrusts further and further, waits until he’s fully seated inside her to arc down and kiss her exceptional tits some more.
“The Malfoy Heir offering himself up for the pleasure of some less than virtuous Gryffindor heroes: what would people say?” Malfoy continues airily.
Malfoy stares after her admiringly. "Potter, why on Earth did you break up with that delightful young woman?"
Laying kiss after kiss over Harry’s heart. It’d be difficult, even for Harry, not to read into that one.
They are, of course, late for breakfast.
As Harry ties his tie and fumbles his school robes on, it occurs to him that Malfoy is not, in fact, busy getting ready. He does a passable job of seeming to, but it's becoming increasingly clear that Malfoy is actually just waiting for him. Oh, Godric, is Malfoy going to want to
“To be fair, it was a very good once,” Hermione answers. Draco lazily twirls his hand in response. “But I suppose I wouldn’t mind another,” she adds, taking off her jumper and treating them to the sight of her exquisite brown tits. She slips out of her skirt, now magnificently nude, and wriggles her way to lie between them. There’s so much bare skin sliding together, except: “Harry, those trousers, honestly!”
Hermione gives a throaty little laugh at that and tugs Draco in by the tie for a dirty little kiss. They both moan as his prick glides wetly along her slit, but Harry can’t seem to take his eyes – or his hands – off Draco’s fantastic arse. Draco pulls back a bit to angle his prick down inside Hermione’s slick lips, but not before telling Harry with a heated look that he’s perfectly welcome to carry on with what he’s doing.
Harry goes along for want of another plan of action.
Harry bites his lip and lets his mind drift farther, to Hermione’s legs wrapped around his waist, his prick pushing deep inside her, her moans in his ear, her hands clutching him for dear life. His cock twitches in his trousers as he imagines making her come, surrounded by books. By all means, this should be Hermione’s greatest fantasy, but when he looks up, she’s completely focused on Advanced Charms, Year Seven.
Harry gulps, unaccountably nervous.
Harry blinks a few times as he tries to return to the present. “My… what?” But as he says it, he realizes with growing anxiety that he knows exactly what Ron means.
to be used by them like this. He groans and twists, fucking himself on Harry’s prick, Harry does the only thing he can: he gives Draco everything he’s got, fucking him with long, deep strokes, tells him what a greedy little slut he is. He reaches round, finds Draco hard and leaking, and makes him come again with only a few deft strokes. The spasming of Draco’s hole round his prick sends Harry over the edge, and he’s just aware enough to hear Hermione’s moans get ever louder as she comes in Draco’s delightful mouth.
Malfoy finishes chewing before he speaks up almost neutrally. "It does seem that way, yes."
He’s too worked up to go slow; he pulls out and shoves back in, hard, and Draco doesn’t object in the least. Harry tries to watch Hermione, stroking her clit with two wet fingers and rolling her hips sanguinely, but he keeps looking down at where his cock is disappearing inside Draco’s arse. His hips pump hard and fast, and suddenly Draco’s moans are muffled and Hermione’s seem so much louder.
“Come to bed, Potter,” he says, and that’s the end of Harry’s worries on the subject.
Harry admires the comfortable way that Malfoy asks for him. He watches as Malfoy slowly and seductively removes each item of clothing, hand on his growing erection. It’s rather reminiscent of their first night together, actually. All that’s missing is-
“To be fair,” Harry cuts in, dropping the hood of his Cloak and frightening the living daylights out of the Slytherins, “you usually were up to something.”
Harry doesn’t attempt to deny that.
“Yeah, in. Put it in me,” she tells him, and he’s already pushing inside before she’s finished.
They don’t seem to mind it, though. If anything, Malfoy’s mouth and hands become more forceful; Hermione’s kiss more passionate. Harry clutches at Malfoy’s hip, at Hermione’s hand, and just holds on. Hermione pulls out of their kiss, smiles at Harry, and tells Malfoy in no uncertain terms to hurry up and get his kit off. Malfoy huffs, climbs over Hermione, and begins to strip next to the bed.
“I should go,” she says. Which, not the worst idea, considering how small the bed is. But Harry gets the feeling that’s not what she’s talking about.
?” she asks, squinting incredulously.
They've made it to the Great Hall at this point, though, so Ron doesn't immediately finish his thought. Half of the students turn to watch their every move, and Harry and Ron do their best not to notice. This is their new normal, since the war. It's fine, really.
Draco moans in the affirmative, eyes rolling back in his head, and Harry has no choice but to give him exactly what he’s asked for: a mouth full of come. Draco swallows round him, again and again, and then licks Harry’s prick clean for good measure. Harry doesn’t get up, not even when the sensation gets to be too much. Something about watching Malfoy lap at his nearly flaccid cock seems dirtier than Malfoy sucking him at full hardness, and Harry’s loathe to stop him.
He wakes with a gasp, blearily blinking and trying to make sense of the Hermione-shaped shadow standing over him. “’Mione?” he asks. He’s pretty sure it’s her, but his glasses seem to be evading his clumsily groping hand.
They can just be still together.
“Y’okay?” Harry mumbles, and gives up looking for his glasses.
Harry scratches the back of his neck. “Eh, I can sorta see why he might not be thrilled to discuss the scorching hot threesomes his best mate is having with his ex and his former bully.”
He remembers Draco’s tongue driving him wild, and tries the same approach. Draco is tense and silent, so Harry tries to take a bit more of his cock, sucking and licking around his mouthful as best as he can. Draco twitches, and when Harry looks up, he’s got his eyes squeezed shut, sheets balled in his fists, teeth in his bottom lip. Harry
“Resistance,” Malfoy fills in helpfully.
Looking more disturbed than ever, Hermione turns the book over in her hands. “Harry, this isn’t a textbook. Have you been...
Malfoy stands in the middle of their room, shoulders tense, a determined look on his face. It puts Harry, who’d been in the middle of kicking off his shoes and unbuckling his belt, on his guard immediately.
Harry flushes. He’d not actually meant to say that. “Forget about the cupboard. Why are you showing me this?”
She purses her lips and looks back at her book. “Well, Harry, when I’m pursuing a new line of study, I usually start by making a list of everything I’d like to learn and go from there.”
“I don’t know,” she breathes. “Is it really okay?”
“I didn’t want to interrupt, but I’m also feeling rather peckish,” she says with a smile.
late. Interestingly, his afterglow is not lessened in the face of Malfoy being Malfoy.
known she had it in her, but he’s not about to go around
“Hmm,” Malfoy hums, kissing Harry’s mouth with plenty of tongue. Harry’s dick jerks at the knowledge that Malfoy is trying to taste himself, but he’s mostly spent. They snog lazily for quite some time, and then Malfoy climbs out of bed to get ready for Magical Theory.
“Pans,” Mill responds.
The entire Great Hall is watching them now, and the 8th years who had witnessed the events of the previous evening are visibly entertained. Harry hardly feels he deserved to be splashed as well, but the part of him still offended on Hermione's behalf is soothed by the sight of his drenched, stuttering, and humiliated best mate.
Gone is last night’s languid disrobing; his movements are jerky, sloppy. Harry watches, spooning up behind Hermione and wrapping his arms around her to unclasp her bra. She scoots back towards him, rubbing her improbably soft arse against his prick with a moan. Harry rolls his hips forward in response, instinctively holding her tighter as her back arches, loving the feel of those skimpy little knickers against his half-hard cock. Harry keeps an eye on Malfoy as he reveals more and more of his pretty pale skin, and keeps his hands on Hermione’s supple tits. Godric, Malfoy’s big cock looks delectable in those tight little pants. There’s a noticeable wet spot round the tip of Malfoy’s prick, and Harry thinks about putting his mouth just there, to taste and tease. To see what kinds of noises Malfoy will make when he’s at Harry’s mercy. The thought prompts a particularly vigorous thrust against Hermione’s arse.
He wants to go on, to lap at her cunt some more, maybe until she comes again, but just then his stomach grumbles quite loudly. Then Hermione is giggling instead of moaning, and Harry laughs too, but it’s too weird in this position, so he falls aside, and Hermione rolls onto her side.
Harry is, again, forced to choose between agreeing with Malfoy and staying silent. He stays silent. Harry gathers his things and heads up stairs and down the hall to his room. He’s fervently hoping he’ll be able to get in a good wank before his roommate comes up, but alas, Malfoy has followed him here.
, you’re perfect, fuck.” Harry clutches the obscenely, unrealistically hot blond in his lap and gasps for breath, feels his cock twitching in Draco’s arse.
It’s not as if Harry had believed Malfoy was harbouring
“Silencing Charm,” Hermione orders, and Harry throws up the strongest Muffliato of his life. She whimpers as he kisses and nips his way back up to her lips. This time, he takes control. He kisses her the way he’s wanted to for ages, takes her breath away. She’s panting when she pulls away to request a proximity alarm, and Harry, sick of the disruptions, performs the charm silently, as he licks his way into her sweet mouth. He slips a thigh between her legs, feels her immediately respond.
“Harry, Ginny told me all... about...” She gets a good look at Harry’s face and starts to lose steam mid-thought. “...Don’t tell me she was lying!”
“Accio wand,” he says, but the wand that smacks into his other palm is definitely not his own. “Sorry, Nev!” He calls with a laugh in his voice, and then quickly aims a hefty Silencing Charm at the wall separating their rooms. He really hopes Malfoy doesn’t notice Harry’s just used his wand.
Ron scratches his head distractedly. "Yeah, but. I'm starting to think that maybe I don't want her back?" It sounds like a question.
“Hi Hermione,” he greets cheerily. “Crookshanks.” The kneazle looks at Harry with the same seeming distaste as always.
Malfoy looks up at him, raises a supercilious eyebrow, silently demands, ‘well?’
“Come, old man, the idea that Harry Potter has an Invisibility Cloak is absurd enough on its own. Your assertion that rather than use it to sneak off for clandestine liaisons with his many hangers-on, he instead chooses to follow
Harry gets a rush, suddenly remembering what they’re about to do. He fumbles the phial of lubricant out of its hiding place, wondering yet again why they’re doing this with him, and pours some onto Malfoy’s outstretched fingers.
The glove is gone and Hermione’s hiked up her skirt, hand in her knickers as she watches them with heated eyes.
Hermione smirks at him like she knows what he’s thinking – and to be fair, she likely does – and picks up the pace herself. Harry laughs and does the same, and soon they’re racing up the stairs and pelting down hallways like firsties trying to elude Filch and Mrs Norris. Her curls fly behind her, free and wild, and Harry feels something bubbling up within him at the sound of her unrestrained laughter.
Watching all this on Harry’s face, Malfoy says, “Okay,” and reapplies his Disillusionment Charm.
Harry says, “Look, mate, you told me that this whole breakup was meant to be temporary, that you had every intention of getting back together with her. But at this point, you'll be lucky if she ever speaks to you again."
Hermione looks at him begrudgingly and admits, “Yes, Harry, you are quite skilled for a supposed beginner.”
Mostly, though, the picture tour of Malfoy’s home is making Harry feel a bit forlorn. He himself has no idea where he’ll live after Hogwarts, and the thought of Malfoy living here alone, or worse, with someone new, is severely hampering his ability to enjoy this.
Hermione sets her quill down with an air of finality sometime later. Harry’s attention is immediately caught, and when she looks at him with eyes alight, his own quill more or less drops to the table.
She rolls her eyes. “Well, yes, I was aware, thanks. I just meant that it’s rather unlike you to go above and beyond the required reading.” She thinks for a moment, shrugs, and adds, “Not when no one’s trying to kill you, anyway.”
“Yeah, me too,” Draco says, speeding up and grasping his own prick.
Huffing in defeat, Harry shakes his head. He lifts his weight off Malfoy’s back, pushes himself up on his palms. “No, that’s- of course I’d like your help, Malfoy-”
“Goes both ways, of course,” Blaise adds slyly. “For example, if you were curious about any of our Draco’s sensitive spots…”
my husband went down on me while I was writing one of these scenes. The first 2 people to correctly guess which get a prize~*
“Oh, so sorry,” Malfoy says, and it’d be perfectly polite if his lips weren’t shining with the evidence of Hermione’s arousal. “Did you want some?”
I’m going to-” and just like that, he’s coming. Some of it shoots across Harry’s tongue, and the rest hits his lower lip and drips down his chin.
“Aah!” Harry yells, one powerful stroke after another hitting his prostate. “Oh God, oh
He draws closer, watching as Malfoy’s head moves in gentle nods and shakes while Hermione becomes more and more vocal in her approval.
She just sighs in response, pushing Harry’s hand lower until he touches slick, velvety flesh. He strokes the hood of her clit, glad to be on somewhat familiar ground. Maybe he hadn’t always felt confident doing this in the past, but if anyone can teach him the basics, it’s Hermione Granger. She rolls her hips forward against Harry’s fingers and then back against his cock, and even though he’s wrapped around her, it feels a lot like she’s the one fucking him right now.
He’s also personally glad Ron’s got something to think about other than the brilliant sex Harry’s been having. Speaking of brilliant sex: Hermione suggests they head up to Harry and Malfoy’s room for a bit of afternoon studying. He’s not at all certain which sort of studying she means, but he’s ready to admit he needs both.
spilled anything. He’s torn between admiration of the clever little plan, and irritation at such Slytherin tactics, but ultimately, he can’t be mad. This is exactly the sort of tutorial he’d had in mind.
, Harry thinks, grinning, as they hastily put their things away and leave the library without saying a word to their study companions.
Harry’s only got a few months to make an impression on his Charms professor to that end, so he’s genuinely interested in digging into whatever dusty old tome Hermione is about to hand him. He’d quite like to come up with a project that is both compelling and unique, and because his focus is firmly on this, he’s rather dumbfounded when Hermione yanks him in by the tie and kisses him soundly.
That afternoon, Harry finds himself in the library finally delving into that book Hermione had handed him a few days back. It does more than give him an idea for his Charms project; it whets Harry’s curiosity about Charms that have long gone out of favor. It is far more engrossing than he could have imagined, and by the time he looks up, he realizes Ancient Runes must be coming to a close shortly.
Silently coexisting. Harry wants to find it comforting, in the same way he appreciates his and Hermione’s new dynamic. He just doesn’t, though. “How’s Muggle Studies?” Harry hears himself ask.
Harry stows his wand absentmindedly, dropping his hands to grip Hermione’s perfect arse. She moans into his mouth, and he hopes like hell his charms hold up, because he has every intention of making her scream right where they stand, Madame Pince be damned. He reaches low, sneaks both hands up Hermione’s uniform skirt and grabs two handfuls of her arse, encouraging her to ride his thigh. She obliges, moaning again and flickering her tongue against his. Even through the material of his uniform trousers and her knickers, he can feel how hot and wet she is, and he’s genuinely considering tugging her panties off and fingering her right here when a loud bell begins to jangle in his head.
Harry tries not to think on it too much. After all, he’s quite sure that smile will be gone entirely once Malfoy learns what he’s done. It’s alarming to learn that somehow, without noticing, Harry has started having to answer to Draco Malfoy of all people, but Harry has enough on his mental plate for today. He shelves this thought for later examination. Preferably, much later.
“Right,” Harry says again, and performs the appropriate sweeps and swirls with his wand. He maybe mumbles the incantation against the soft skin of Hermione’s neck, but can feel the spell take effect anyway.
– “Oh Godric, Harry, please don’t stop, please, fuck me,” she’s saying, so he opens his eyes-
A familiar clip of heeled boot is coming round the corner. They look up and see Malfoy approaching.
“Invitation?” Hermione asks distantly.
“Can’t reach your arse from this angle, sorry.” Harry gives his prick a teasing stroke. Guess you’ll have to ask someone else.” Harry meets Hermione’s eyes, sees them light up.
And if that thought doesn’t ring entirely true, that’s likely just a result of his abandonment issues coming up again. Nothing to be concerned about just now, surely.
for him, or anything.
Harry has decided, quite abruptly, that they should try sitting at the end of the table usually occupied by Slytherins. He sits down across from Bulstrode, and after a long moment, Malfoy sits down beside him.
Harry can feel his body tensing, straining, as he hurtles towards the edge. He looks down again, sees that some of Malfoy’s white-blond hair has fallen into his eyes, and gives in to the urge to touch. He sinks both hands into Malfoy’s delightfully soft hair, hissing when he feels the scrape of Malfoy’s teeth. "Godric, Malfoy,” he says, although he himself can’t tell whether he’s upset or sort of into it. He fists his hands in Malfoy’s hair, tugging firmly, and then again, harder, when Malfoy moans around his prick. Harry’s entire body shudders under the sensation, hips jerking, and when Malfoy doesn’t complain, he uses his grip in Malfoy’s hair to push his cock deeper into that brilliant mouth.
Both he and Draco hiss unhappily as Draco gets up and Harry’s cock slips out. It should be awkward, but they both have little smiles on their faces whilst they get dressed and aim Cleaning Charms at their persons and clothes. It takes a few attempts to get the white stains out of Harry’s tie, and they laugh as they take turns trying.
Malfoy nudges Harry aside and resumes his place between Hermione’s legs, stroking her cunt with his tongue, petting her arse with wet fingers.
Malfoy’s reaction is much more interesting to Harry. He stands, looking almost more shocked to see him than either of his friends. He’d known Harry was standing there, so Harry can’t imagine why he looks so relieved to see him.
“Where have you
Hermione rolls her eyes a little as she takes off her top and unclasps her bra, tugging the cups away from her tellingly peaked nipples. It seems he’s not the only one who’s been thinking of more than just schoolwork.
“Nothing,” Harry whispers. “Sorry I woke you.” He moves to get up, but Malfoy doesn’t let him get far.
He moans, louder, nodding his head and closing his mouth over her clit to suck, as he’d seen Malfoy do. Hermione hisses a bit in response, and Malfoy puts a calming hand in Harry’s hair.
Until Malfoy gives a none too gentle tug at Harry’s hair and tells him, “Get your cock out, Potter, I want you to come in my mouth,” at which point Harry hastens to obey. He’s out of his trousers and pants in record time, and since Draco just lies on his back, looking up at him, Harry realizes exactly what he must do.
Hermione gives it to him, nice and slow, and Draco takes it beautifully. He whines, squirms on her fingers, cock leaking and jerking where it lies untouched. Harry watches, riveted, can’t believe Draco.
“Yes, Draco, you may finger my arse.” Her tone is a bit sardonic, but Harry watches her tension drain away at Draco’s reassurance.
“Ah, here it is!” she announces needlessly, sliding past him with a smile. Harry means to check out the book, but mostly he’s just watching the sway of Hermione’s hips as she walks away.
The room is quiet as Harry’s mind runs wild, wondering what rumors Gin has spread about him this time. He doubts Ginny was being malicious; more likely than not she’s been spreading word of his (as yet undiscovered) sexual prowess, and perhaps a few more preposterous tattoos.
Harry has every intention of sharing this dirty little secret with Malfoy, but it takes a while for the right opportunity to arise. Defense class is half over by the time Harry gets a chance to sneak the panties into Malfoy’s pocket away from prying eyes, and takes pleasure from watching Malfoy’s confusion give way to realization, and then to burning arousal, and then to embarrassment. He doesn’t have to look down to know that Malfoy is now sporting a raging hard-on.
"Admittedly, I have quite a bit to learn. I like to think I’m a quick study, though?” He’s shamelessly fishing for a compliment here, but a bit of reassurance would not go amiss.
It’s a fair observation. He's not even opened the book Hermione had recommended to him, and though he’s sure it’ll be fascinating later, and he can think of a dozen things he’d prefer to be learning about at this moment. None of them are related to Charms.
His prick spurts out salty pre-come on Harry’s tongue, and Harry licks it up heartily before ducking down to suck harder. He’s just starting to get the hang of it when Draco seems to grow bigger, somehow, hotter.
“How could it
Whatever Zabini sees in Hermione’s expression seems to shock him, and the words she mutters seem to bowl him right over. He stumbles back a step and nods, handsome face utterly dumbfounded. Suddenly, Hermione is flinging herself at him, pushing his shoulders into the stone wall behind him and snogging him soundly.
Ron rushes to explain to Hermione that this is all new, and well, they’re not anything yet, they’ve just chatted a bit, but it’s a very recent development, he’d certainly not flirted whilst they were still together-
“Who cares if it isn’t ‘right’ according to someone else’s ethical standpoint? It’s right for us. Isn’t that what truly matters?” Malfoy asks, and Harry is surprised to find he agrees.
Hermione smiles at Harry and then turns to their dining companions. “He’s quite right.” She gets this dirty little smirk on her face then, and adds, “My needs are being well-met, thanks.”
Getting Malfoy off doesn’t seem to be getting old, and if the sparkle in Malfoy’s eye as he licks his own hand clean is anything to go by, he feels much the same.
Blaise laughs brightly and wraps and arm around Pansy’s shoulders. “Come, darling, it seems Potter has finally figured out the right thing to do with that Cloak. Who would’ve guessed it existed after all!”
He seems less than pleased to see them together. “Ginevra,” he says coldly, glaring at her until she removes her arm.
Draco shifts on the bed, and then, Harry feels his hot prick lying against his arse.
When Harry emerges from the bathroom, freshly washed and mostly dressed, Malfoy is adjusting his hair in his (entirely too ornate) mirror. Harry hasn't said - and has no intention of doing so - but he quite likes the way Malfoy has cut back on the hair products of late. He's given up the severe slicked back look for a side part, and just enough potions to keep it neatly in place. His pale hair looks so fine and soft, and Harry can hardly wait until he gets an opportunity to actually touch it.
Malfoy stumbles to a stop, clearly not expecting this.
, Potter," he snaps, very nearly sounding like himself again.
Normally, when one of them is changing in the room, the other turns away out of courtesy. But, what with the state of Harry’s cock (fully hard) and mind (full of images of sassy Hermione and the well-shaped Pansy Parkinson rolling around partially naked, moaning and grinding), well, turning away doesn’t even occur to him.
“And hardly even then,” Harry adds, because it’s not as if she’s wrong. If he tries really hard, he can pretend Malfoy didn’t squeeze him painfully when Hermione mentioned Harry’s tendency to draw certain danger like a magnet. Hermione lies down fully and relaxes into Harry’s side. The heavy tome adjusts automatically.
Malfoy’s eyes drop to the front of Harry’s trousers, where he knows his semi is at least partially visible. He knows he should try to hide it, but for some reason, he doesn’t mind Malfoy knowing he’s aroused. Quite likes it, even.
“Ugh!” Malfoy remarks succinctly, serving himself up a pancake or two.
Malfoy clears his throat importantly and begins to read. “Item one: cunnilingus. Item two: anal sex. I suppose we can check that one right off, hm?” Harry shouts as he realizes exactly what it is Malfoy is reading from. He dives off the bed in attempt to snatch the parchment from him, but Malfoy dodges him and continues reading. “Item three: rimming! Potter, you dirty boy!”
"Mate, you've got to help me fix things," Ron pleads, looking quite pitiful. He's had a rough day, Harry knows. A number of upper year girls - several of whom aren't even friendly with Hermione - have worked together to make Ron's life hell. He'd been sneered at, hit with tripping jinxes, sabotaged in class, and called number of rude names all day.
Mill actually gives a little smile at that.
He’s not had an incident of wild magic in several years, but he can’t find it in himself to be embarrassed. Can anyone really blame him?
that?” Harry knows his face is bright red, and it seems improbable that Malfoy would be able to hold the parchment out of Harry’s reach when Harry has him halfway pinned. He reaches for it again, but Malfoy smacks his hand away.
It feels brilliant, but Harry’s hungry for more, wants to feel full. “Two, can I have two? Malfoy, I’m ready, I want-” Malfoy obliges him without hesitation, and Harry fairly howls at how good it feels. Malfoy wiggles his fingers inside, and Harry tries to let him know without words that he can push deep, that he can fuck Harry with his fingers, that he can and should get a little rough with it.
“Ron...” Harry’s not even sure where to start. “What the hell were you thinking?” He’s aware that, under normal circumstances, he’d be much angrier with Ron.  Normally, they’d have a proper row and maybe even not speak to one another for a week or two. It’s just that it doesn’t seem fair to kick up such a fuss now, considering the manner in which he’d so thoroughly enjoyed the benefits of Ron’s blunder last night. It’s hard to still be mad about it, if he's honest.
Malfoy just moans and takes it. Looks to be rather enjoying himself, as a matter of fact.
“Yes!” they insist simultaneously, he with a sneer and she with an exasperated sigh.
Out in the hallway, Hermione says, “Thanks for joining me, Harry. You really should come to the library more often.” She’s said it to him probably a thousand times, but instead of sounding like yet another lecture from his brainy best friend, the invitation sounds almost illicit. Harry has to work not to hasten his steps toward the Common Room.
“God,” he murmurs, both hands on Malfoy’s perfect arse.
Then, inspiration strikes.
“Actually,” Harry begins, oh so casually, “I’ve been meaning to thank you for the... extracurricular tutoring you’ve been giving me these past couple of days.”
And that’s the moment when the door to their room bursts open. Hermione stands there, cheeks flushed, eyes comically wide. When Malfoy stands up, gloriously naked and more than half-hard, her jaw drops.
Harry falls asleep, more than once.
"Look, Ron." Guilt roils in Harry's belly, and he's in serious danger of confessing when Malfoy stamps on his foot under the table. Harry jumps and turns to glare at Malfoy.
The non-plussed expression on Malfoy’s face speaks for itself.
“Gin and Dean want to toss a Quaffle about a bit before dinner.” Right! Quidditch! “What do you think?”
,” Malfoy sneers, aghast.
Harry’s eyes pop open and he looks just in time to see Hermione’s hips lower onto him, his cock being swallowed up by her dripping wet cunt. Dripping wet with - his eyes roll right back into his head and he blindly grasps Hermione’s hips, thrusting mindlessly up into her. She feels- she’s so- he’s never done this before, and he’s quite sure he won’t be lasting long at all. And then Hermione is getting louder, has started
After Harry’s caught his breath and most of his senses have returned to him, he’s kneeling between the spread of Hermione’s legs. Her arse is still in the air, though she’s collapsed onto her elbows. He watches her still pulsating, shiny and wet and so pretty, and leans in to lick a stripe from her clit all the way to her dripping hole. He pulls back to look again, sees his own come starting to drip out, and decides to take a page out of Draco Malfoy’s book; he licks and licks, spreads her wide and pushes his tongue inside to lap at the sticky mess he’s left behind. It’s not that it’s delicious, as such, but the act itself is filthy and delightful, and if Hermione’s desperate moans are anything to go by, she feels the same.
Pansy starts to laugh as well, with no small amount of scorn. “Invisible Potter,” she scoffs. “Darling, now that all of that unpleasantness is behind us, are you willing to admit that Invisible Potter is the most ridiculous story you’ve ever made up?”
Harry wakes the next morning to the momentarily alarming sight of someone leaning just over his face, watching him. He blinks, relaxes when his blurry gaze focuses just enough to bring Draco mostly into focus. If he stops to think about it, that's the most alarming part of all, but he’s not thinking right now. Right now, he looks at Draco’s silver eyes, which seem unusually warm, and arches his neck for a kiss.
“Cheers,” Harry mutters.
Draco looks up at him with a sparkle in his eye, like he knows exactly what Harry is thinking. “You filthy boy,” he murmurs, the effect greatly lessened due to the fact that Harry’s cock is still sitting on his lower lip.
"Jesus, Malfoy," Harry croaks. He doubts that will ever get old.
“Okay,” she capitulates, pushing up toward Harry’s mouth. He gets the sense all she’d wanted was a bit of reassurance.
So when Malfoy hands him a photo of what is clearly the master bedroom, with it massive bed and tall windows and tasteful grey and blue bedding and curtains, Harry quickly hands it back, along with the rest of the photographs. His stomach is starting to hurt, to be honest.
And the truth is spilling out before he can think to stop it. “F-fingers! Your magnificent fucking fingers.” Here, in the dark, Harry can admit just how much time he’s spent admiring Malfoy’s long, elegant fingers. Wondering about how they might feel inside him.
For his part, Draco doesn’t seem to mind this treatment at all. If anything, he encourages it, hands holding onto her hips but not attempting to control them. He moans, muffled and sweet, into her cunt, doesn’t stop licking. Harry can just barely see flashes of pink tongue, but he can see quite clearly when Draco closes his lips over Hermione’s clit, sees his cheeks start to hollow as he sucks, and watches as the last of Hermione’s control slips.
“Around Potter, you mean!” Parkinson corrects.
“Nope, definitely listening,” Harry blatantly lies, staring unabashedly.
Hermione looks up at her perfectly positioned book, perplexed and perhaps the slightest bit offended. “I don’t recall that spell being in the assigned reading for Charms.”
Harry thinks that maybe this isn’t so different from what he’d been doing last night, and starts a vigorous and persistent licking over Draco’s hole. Draco’s response is telling: he begins to shout, and knocks several things off the worktable he’s bent over. A large bag of soil rips open, spills over the floor beside where Harry kneels. Under his tongue, he feels the muscles start to give, and he begins to prod firmly. Draco starts making this ‘ah! Ah!’ noise that makes it very clear he is close to orgasm. Harry considers pulling away, but instead finds himself reaching up and around, grasping Draco’s prick, pushing his tongue inside Draco’s arse.
He’s coming, like a shooting star bursting across the sky. His cock shoots off, entirely untouched, and come spurts across his own chest.
“You couldn’t go back, could you? Not even if you’d wanted to?”
“I’ve been reliably informed that they are spell-compatible brands. It will take some learning how to use them, but they seem so much simpler than a several fire oven that needs to be managed and maintained by House Elf magic.” He passes Harry a photo of an elegant dining room much more befitting the Malfoy heir.
be joking,” Draco says, not really resisting, but Harry listens anyway. He takes off his jumper and lays it down over the dirt, tossing his best Cushioning Charm at it. This is all he’s prepared to offer, and Draco lies on it willingly enough.
When Harry comes to, he’s relatively sure not much time has passed. He’s not alone in his bed, anyway. He feels sated, sluggish, and he turns his head to see…
Malfoy tenses, keens, and comes explosively between their bodies. Harry is moments away from following him, when suddenly Malfoy is no longer wrapped around him. He shoves at Harry, now genuinely trying to escape his hold, and Harry has no choice but to let him go.
Harry gives up trying to observe Draco’s elite oral skills and lays down next to Hermione’s hot, squirming body. She turns and gives him a little smile, and he can’t help but reach out and touch her all over. He runs a hand down her flank, across her soft, heaving belly, up between the peaks of her delicious brown tits. “God, Hermione,” he murmurs. “You’re gorgeous.”
Harry’s Fridays are splendidly free of classes. He has a plan to spend most of the day lazing about in bed, but something about sleeping in Malfoy’s bed with his face buried in Malfoy’s hair is having an unforeseen effect on his subconscious mind. He has a profoundly detailed dream about sucking Malfoy off, and when he wakes up that morning, the only thing he wants more than sleep is to make that dream a reality.
Still, things don’t seem to be quite
Harry shrugs, feeling embarrassed all over again. He hears the echo of Hermione telling Draco Malfoy to
Somehow sensing the path Harry’s thoughts have taken, Ron scoots closer on the couch and elbows Harry. “Don’t, mate. This situation is hardly your fault.” Harry’s skepticism must show on his face, because Ron goes on. “For years, you’ve said nothing,
“‘Course!” Ron warbles.
Aghast, Harry whips his head around to make sure no one is within hearing distance. They're in the clear, but he has to say it anyway: "Shut up, Malfoy." It feels good, almost comforting, to say.
year here. Personally, Harry is hoping Flitwick will be able to connect him to some post-Hogwarts education that does not actually take place at Hogwarts.
“He loves it,” Draco says, gravelly and hot. “Keep touching him like that.” And then, Draco’s hand is gone. He seems to be reaching across Harry’s body, and soon Hermione is hissing and moaning like… like she’s got something thick and perfect in her pussy.
Ron goggles at him speechlessly for at least a minute. “What?” Harry is relatively certain he need not repeat himself though. “But you just said…”
Oddly, Malfoy drops everything in his arms.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione says quietly, voice unmistakably fond. She doesn’t move off of him, so he gently rolls her onto her back. Draco appears suddenly, with a warm washcloth in hand to gently clean her up.
Malfoy laughs out loud, bright and unexpected. Hermione smacks his arm none-too-gently.
“A bit,” Harry admits sheepishly.
Malfoy looks like he’s about to say something else, but gets stuck on what Harry’s said. “A
“What, Potter.” Only Malfoy could inject this much irritation into two words.
After, Draco is still fingering him, and Harry’s panting and sighing with his face buried in Hermione’s perfect tits. He kisses them, licks them, suckles at them. He thinks, when he’s thinking again, that it’s probably time to pull out, but she stops him with legs wrapped around his waist.
“It’s lovely, Malfoy, but why are you showing me this? I grew up in a cupboard; I’m hardly an expert on interior design.”
“Great!” Malfoy says. “I hope your contraceptives stand up to that famous Potter exceptionalism, by the way; I might have accidentally planted some notions of impregnating you several years down the line.”
“Malfoy?” she asks sweetly.
“Ooooh!” Hermione says, drawn out like the slow slide of Draco’s prick inside her. “Yeah,” she declares when he’s fully seated in her cunt. “Fuck me.”
“Oh, really?” Pansy practically purrs, eyes alight. “And how has that been working for you?”
Malfoy’s voice is low and tellingly rumbly by the time he gets to the end.
“Surely you know how Potter feels about you.”
She moans and jerks in his arms, squeezing her pussy around him. He can’t help but move, then; he pulls out a bit and then rolls his hips back in, then does it again. Every time he pushes all the way in, her muscles clamp down around his prick, and he feels certain he won’t last long at this rate.
"No, not that," Ron dismisses, as though he hadn't publicly condemned Hermione over that very issue the night previous.
Hermione, who has not quite gotten off, rubs frantic circles on her clit as Draco pulls out. She gives a disappointed little moan, clearly missing the feeling of fullness, but he immediately pushes three fingers back inside her, gives her a few expert strokes that make her eyes bug out and her voice go high-pitched, and that’s it for her. She tenses all over, bucking hard on Draco’s fingers as she comes and comes.
“You can. Pinch,” she pants, and when Harry obliges, her whole body tenses. Her voice is high, almost pained, as her orgasm washes over her. Malfoy takes control again and fucks her through it until she collapses back in Harry’s arms, shivering.
Harry thinks it over. Hermione would not thank him for bragging about shagging her, but maybe he needn’t mention that at all. “I don’t think she’s looking at the moment.” He realizes as he says it that it’s quite true; Hermione is reveling in her own freedom. She’s happier and more fulfilled than he’s ever seen her. “She’s got her freedom and her studies, and she’s been accepted at the London School of Magico-archeology. And her friends, of course.”
Malfoy’s ready to give up after about 15 minutes of this. “This isn’t leaving us with many options, Potter. Trelawney keeps rather odd hours, so the Divinations classroom isn’t a very good idea. The Greenhouses are too much of a cliché, but the Clock Tower is a somewhat viable option…” He trails off at the look Harry is giving him. “What?”
bit wet, but he definitely does not want to talk about it right now. Hermione hardly seems to mind the distraction, and obliges him with gusto. Malfoy makes his way to suck Harry’s right nipple at the same moment Hermione sucks Harry’s bottom lip into her mouth, and muffled moans begin to spill out.
“See you around, then, I guess.” Ginny is clearly stifling a smile as she walks away, but Harry appreciates her not outright laughing.
They pass the rest of the day hanging out in Harry and Malfoy’s room, reading and poking fun at each other. They even get Harry to make progress on his Transfigurations essay, utilizing makeouts as incentives. Between Malfoy’s biting, almost possessive kisses, and Hermione’s playful seductiveness, Harry finds himself nearly done before he knows it.
It’s only a few hours later that Harry wakes. The room is dark, cool, and quiet. He’d had hazy dreams, and can’t even really remember what they’d been about, only that they’d left him rock hard and positively desperate for an orgasm. Suddenly, the folly of having offered Hermione his bed is quite clear. Seems a bit rude to wank in Malfoy’s bed whilst the other boy is trying to sleep, so there’s little he can do if he doesn’t want to sneak off to the bathroom for a furtive midnight jerk.
“Is this alright?” he asks, voice quite muffled. Hermione nods emphatically, eyes squeezed shut, but that’s apparently not good enough for Malfoy. He lifts his head, strokes her inner thigh with his dry hand until she looks at him. “I’m more than happy to play consent games with you some other time, Hermione. But for the remainder of the evening, I’ll need a clear yes or no. Now, is this alright?” He rubs a wet thumb over her arsehole, as if it’s not perfectly obvious what he’s asking about.
Hermione moans back, asks him in a low voice if he likes it.
“Go ahead,” he encourages, patting Draco’s arse and nudging him forward. “Give our gorgeous Hermione the shagging she deserves.”
Harry is far too impatient to undress; he unbuttons and unzips his trousers, taking his cock out of his pants and rubbing it against Draco’s arsehole teasingly. Draco’s hole twitches needily under Harry’s gaze, and Harry moans shamelessly at the sight. He has to dig around for several seconds in search of the lube, but soon enough he’s slicked up and pushing inside Draco’s perfect arse. “God,” he verbalizes, staring as Draco’s greedy hole sucks him in. Hermione had prepared him so well, Harry pushes all the way in to the hilt without pausing, watches Draco’s back arch, listens as both Draco and Hermione moan.
to wipe that well-shagged look off your face? As if our traipsing in late, together, isn’t going to draw enough attention on its own.”
“Great!” Malfoy chirps, rolling under Harry to lie on his back. He somehow manages to knock one of Harry’s arms from under him, and Harry lands on top of him with an ‘oof!’ Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind at all, carrying on reading the list of Harry’s fantasies while Harry hides his hot face in Malfoy’s incredibly soft jumper. His neck prickles like someone is watching him, but he definitely doesn’t want to see the look on Hermione’s face right now.
Harry should resent Malfoy’s deviousness, but ever since term started, all Malfoy’s little schemes have turned out to be very personally profitable for Harry. He’s starting to see what the Sorting Hat had meant about him doing well in Slytherin…
“Yes, rather,” he agrees. “But back to Granger’s filthy fantasies: am I to understand you’ve written a list just like this one?”
Hermione pulls back a bit and Harry kisses his way down her chin to her neck. Unlike Malfoy, Hermione would likely hex Harry for leaving a mark, so he’s careful not to nip or suck too hard. Her skin is so soft, so sweet, he can hardly get enough.
Malfoy purses his lips, but it’s clear he’s hiding a smile.0
Malfoy nuzzles Harry’s bared throat – because that’s what he’d instinctively done, thrown back his head and bared his neck to Malfoy – and asks, “Potter, do you-” he pauses to groan when Harry bucks up against his thigh. “Do you wish to be free?”
, Harry is fit to burst by the time the two of them take off for Ancient Runes together. Harry, who has a free afternoon, practically races up to the Eighth Year dorms.
“You’re an animal,” Draco tells him, nuzzling Harry’s neck. “An absolute beast.”
“Oh, such a slag, am I?” Hermione yells back dangerously. “I suppose you
“Oh Harry,” Hermione says affectionately, shifting from underneath him. Malfoy is still giggling, and she looks distinctly amused, but they start working in tandem to strip Harry completely naked, so it’s hard to be very mad. Hermione gives an appreciative hum when they’re done, eyes trailing down Harry’s body at a leisurely pace. She traces her finger across his collarbone, down his chest to toy with a brown nipple.
“I’ve been around,” he answers vaguely.
“Yes, perfect for lurking about under a shoddy Disillusionment Charm, I’d say.
“God,” he murmurs, never having guessed being held down would make him feel like this.
go back, now that the creature who tried to kill me during my last visit is finally dead.” Malfoy rolls his eyes, but Harry is filled with genuine gratitude all over again. He lifts his juice goblet and toasts it in Neville’s direction. “Thanks again, mate!”
Malfoy pulls away again, looking aroused and irritated in equal measure. "Absolutely out of my mind,” he continues, shooting Harry another searing glare before dropping entirely out of sight.
his arse? Would it be alright if Harry maybe spanked it a little? A soft grunt escapes his lips as he pictures just that: Malfoy's arse jiggling while Harry smacks it, again and again. Would Malfoy like that sort of thing? Would he moan like he had last night, when he was buried deep in Hermione’s cunt? Would he let Harry touch his hole between spanks? Maybe Harry could even slip his finger inside, just a bit. Harry squeezes his own cock and moans quietly, thinking about Malfoy's tight little hole gripping his finger. In his mind, Malfoy whimpers, and it sounds so real that Harry opens his eyes -
Hermione abandons them early on Sunday, off to the library. She encourages Malfoy to join her, but he adamantly refuses to get up.
“Anytime,” he says rather sincerely, eyeing the red knickers she leaves behind.
“So!” Blaise pipes up 15 minutes later, clapping his hands together. “Potter, what’s the deal with Granger?”
Harry had tried very hard to convince Ron that the last thing that would convince Hermione to give him what he wants is to bail on her,
Malfoy complains throughout the entire walk down to the Great Hall, expensive boots clipping against the stone in an angry staccato. His school robes billow behind him with almost Snape-like drama. His scathing tirade covers a breadth of topics including but not limited to: Harry’s Gryffindor tie, Harry’s hopelessly messy hair, Harry’s scuffed trainers, and Harry’s poor time-management skills. Mostly, though, he complains that they will likely miss all the good breakfast foods.
Her moans get this scratchy quality, like she’s on the verge of losing her voice, and Harry takes this as his cue to rub her to orgasm with a slick thumb. The move is perfectly well-timed, as it turns out, because Malfoy pushes deep inside just then and starts to come. Harry imagines he can feel it, hot and spurting inside Hermione’s arse, and just the thought of it sends him over the edge.
Harry complains loudly about Malfoy signing up for a Friday class, but Malfoy’s only response is the pleased look he wears as he dresses and finally leaves.
Hermione is worn out, and they convince her to stay the night. “Yes, I suppose you’re not using this bed anymore,” she mutters sleepily.
Surprisingly, Ron elects to sit with them at dinner. Unsurprisingly, it is the most awkward meal of Harry’s entire life. All things considered, that’s saying a lot.
Several gasps sound throughout the very crowded room, and Harry finds that he has jumped up from his seat by the fire. “Over the line, Ron,” he says tightly. He wonders wildly if he’s going to have to punch one of his best friends in the face.
Hermione snorts loudly from Harry’s bed as the ghostly figure dissipates.
Harry hesitates a bit too long, and watches Malfoy’s playful expression melt away, leaving nothing in its wake.
He feels feverish, like he’s swimming, caught on powerful waves but not the least bit frightened of drowning. She feels so bloody good under him, and Draco puts his hands on Harry’s arse, touches him fervently. Harry is lost in sensation, and is glad Draco doesn’t ask.
Malfoy makes some noises about checking his schedule, just to be a pompous arse, but then suggests they do it the very next day.
"Worth it," Ginny mutters, glaring at Ron once more before stomping away to Gryffindor table.
Harry whines embarrassingly, but Malfoy doesn’t mock.
Hermione cuts him off with a little laugh. “It’s quite alright, Ron. I’ve moved on.”
It seems that that thought had not previously occurred to Ron. He looks bewildered. "Didn't really think about that." He rubs the back of his neck and looks down, thinking for a bit. "You can, you know,” he says when he looks up again. “Hit me, I mean. If you want."
Malfoy looks up at Harry, a spark in his eye and a smirk around Harry’s fingers. It seems Harry had spoken aloud. He’d try to take it back, only Malfoy doesn’t give him much chance; he climbs over Hermione, pushes Harry flat on his back, and straddles him.
Ron nods, and doesn't bother to finish chewing before responding. "Maybe it was just time for things to end. I mean, I care about her and all, but it didn’t feel like I'd always thought it would, you know?"
“I suppose,” she allows. “Perhaps I ought to get my hands on a hero of my own?” She and Zabini go back and forth for a minute, naming names in a blasé fashion, debating the pros and cons of using their classmates for their own personal gain.
“Yes, but,” she hesitates, biting her lip. “I wouldn’t want to get in the way.”
He tries very hard not to hear the desperation in his own voice.
“Privacy Charm, Harry,” she repeats, her words gratifyingly breathy.
“God, Hermione,” he pants into her neck while he thrusts inside her. “I want to make you come. Can you- will you tell me what to do?”
Malfoy does little more than shoot him a disapproving look. There are more photos: a formal front room, a much cozier sitting room equipped with a large fireplace and an incongruously comfy-looking couch, and a slew of bedrooms, one of which has built-in bookshelves taking up three walls. Harry can’t help but smile at the last, a bit. It fairly screams Hermione.
“Well you should have considered that before you took up with a greedy only child. I want you now, and I’ll not be made to wait.”
“Good night,” Hermione murmurs from Harry’s bed.
Malfoy withdraws his fingers, eyes burning with satisfaction and desire. Slowly, he drags them through the streak of come where it's spattered across Harry's belly and brings them to his mouth for a taste.
stop coming, and then he blacks out.
Harry groans, nodding and pushing towards the teasing finger. The finger disappears briefly, and he can hear Malfoy digging around. The pop of a phial being uncorked sounds, and Harry tries to suppress his shivers, but he can’t, not until Malfoy’s hand is back between his legs, wet fingers circling and stroking his hole. Harry holds out for as long as he can, but only seconds later he bursts out, “Malfoy,
year when she’d received Outstandings on all of her O.W.L.s. She’s even started socializing more, having made friends in other Houses who appreciate a good study sesh just as much as she does.
this is a good sign, but just in case, he pops off. “I haven’t… that is, I’d welcome any… feedback you might have.”
Professor Slughorn eyes the mess impatiently. Malfoy has happened to spill a somewhat volatile ingredient which would react unpredictably to being swept up with a spell. No, each bean will need to be picked up by hand, and their professor looks none too pleased about it. Everyone knows he has a standing appointment to get completely sloshed with Professor Flitwick and Madam Hooch once a week, on this particular day.
A full minute passes before her surprised, “Draco! So good of you to join us.” Then, catching sight of Harry, she issues a disdainful greeting of, “Potter.”
“Then… yes. Tomorrow,” Hermione agrees breathlessly.
Harry, Hermione and Malfoy snag the coveted armchair and couch nearest the fire in the 8th year common room. Hermione gives an exaggerated yawn and claims, rather uncharacteristically, to be tired of reading. Malfoy and Harry aren’t buying it for a moment, but when she puts her socked feet in Harry’s lap and pressures Malfoy to read the assigned chapters for Defense Against the Dark Arts aloud for them, they indulge her.
It’s not necessarily that Harry had thought that Ron and Hermione would be together forever. They weren’t exactly well-matched in intellect, interests, or temperament. However, Harry couldn’t find it in himself to try to stop them from colliding; they’d been undeniably drawn to one another since first year. So yeah, it isn’t a surprise when things do come to an end, but he’d kinda assumed their relationship would last a
“Oh, is that the time?” Hermione asks. “I’m quite late,” she continues, sounding more like dreamy Luna Lovegood than frazzled Hermione Granger. She kisses both of them on the cheek and then is gone, presumably to the library.
, no,” he says, and has to bite his own lip to stop from saying ‘never.’ Once he’s sufficiently swallowed the urge, he speaks again, slurring a bit. “Feels so good.”
“Yesssss,” she hisses, planting her feet on the bed and rolling her hips up against the thrust of her own fingers.
“Harry!” Hermione admonishes, sounding entirely intrigued. “Is this true?”
Now, Harry climbs onto his bed, letting his books fall to the floor. Maybe he can make Malfoy go away with the power of his mind? He sits and stares, silently demanding that Malfoy fuck off.
lie about this sort of thing. He blinks at Hermione, who seems to be coming to the same conclusion.
Incredibly, Malfoy’s cheeks flush. He throws his hands in the air dramatically, scoffing dismissively to try to cover it up, but he’s bloody well
When he doesn’t say anything else, Harry tries to speak up. “We were just-”
“Close the door, will you, Granger?” Malfoy asks, sounding for all the world as though he’s fully dressed and completely composed.
When they subside a few minutes later, Ron punches Harry’s shoulder, none-too-gently. “Didn’t mean to,” he mocks, but that just sets them off again.
“But not ‘just’ friends, right?” She gives him a knowing look. Harry tilts his head in acknowledgement. Ginny thinks on it for a moment. “I’m hardly surprised, Harry. Ya kinda love her.”
Harry sits by the fire, feeling oddly solitary in the half-full Common Room. All things considered, that conversation had gone as well as it possibly could have. Ron is a notorious hothead, and it might have gone drastically worse. He’s still got about 40 minutes before Hermione and Malfoy come back from Ancient Runes – assuming they don’t stop off in a darkened corridor to make good on the unspoken promises they’d been making at each other all day – but his original plan of jerking off is looking rather less than enticing right about now.
