“There’s only one spot on the sofa left,” says Draco quietly, eyes flitting back to Samuel momentarily. “If you want your new friend to stay, you’ll have to sit on my lap.”
Harry watches him drum his long fingers anxiously against the ceramic of his mug, and takes another sip of his own tea. He imagines those fingers wrapping around his wrists, pinning them down. Leaving a bruise. He was telling the truth earlier, pain doesn’t really interest him, but the idea of Draco leaving a mark on him does.
Draco swallows, opens his mouth to speak, but only hears a strange croaking sound come out of his mouth. If he’d known at the time, that his sworn enemy was watching him at such a vulnerable moment, he doesn’t know what he would have done. Actually, that’s a lie. He likely would have taken one of his father’s tacky decorative swords from the wall and impaled himself on it like a dishonoured samurai- just out of sheer embarrassment and rage.
“Better,” says Draco, his voice low. “I’ve insulted that crows-nest many times, but you don’t look right without it.”
They stay like that for what could be minutes or hours, Harry doesn’t know. What he does know is that every third turn of the page, Draco checks he’s still with him. He strokes his hair, murmurs to him. He kisses his temple, strokes his thumb across his cheekbone, looking into Harry’s half-lidded eyes. Asking a silent question that Harry finds a way to just as soundlessly answer. Sometimes with a nuzzle into the starched fabric of Draco’s shirt, sometimes just with a sigh and lazy look. He probably would have fallen asleep without these peaceful disruptions, feeling so safe, because he knows Draco always takes care of his things.
Draco has a few ideas why it might appeal to someone with his particular issues, but this isn’t the time for armchair psychology.
He hides his head in Draco’s chest but he can’t stop crying. He manages to prevent any more embarrassing sobs from escaping, but his breath is still stopping and starting like an old car. Draco’s arms are warm and strong around him, and he clutches at his back in return.
Harry and Ron burst into very unmanly giggles, and eventually Hermione succumbs to laughter as well.
The man laughs, clearly unbothered, but Harry misses his response. There’s a sharp look in Draco’s eyes when he watches Samuel stood by his side, and it makes a shiver run through him. He hands Draco his drink, and receives murmured thanks, before that gaze is directed at him again.
Harry’s heart beats so fast his chest hurts. Does he trust Malfoy? A few days ago, he might have said no. Yes, he’d spoken up for him at the trials. Yes, he’d saved his life and vice versa. But, trust him? No. After that tour the other day, when Malfoy told him about being a lonely child, reading stories to a ghost he pretended was his sister. When Malfoy apologised, in his stilted, formal way. When he said he would always argue with him, instead of lying and pretending there are only calm waters between them. Harry can trust that person to be exactly who they are, and he doesn’t think that person wants to hurt him anymore.
Draco put his arm over his eyes, shielding them from the sun and Harry’s gaze. “I didn’t want you to save me again, to be the hero again. To show how much better you were than me.”
Since they’re still quite far away, and the gate is already loose, he lets himself in and starts walking to meet them. Arthur waves a hand above his head. Once he’s in hearing distance, he starts calling to him.
When Harry was twenty years old he danced with Oliver Wood at a charity ball. His skills weren’t much improved since fourth year, despite all the functions he’d been forced to attend. He definitely trod on Oliver’s foot more than once, but the man only laughed. They spent all night reminiscing about their years on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; their improbable wins, bitter defeats, and the trials of captaincy. Near the end of the night, they drifted onto a balcony away from the crowds. They’d both had a lot to drink, and when Oliver joked about Harry choking on the snitch in his first match, he does something unexpected. He tells Oliver about how Dumbledore hid the resurrection stone inside the snitch. How Dumbledore had always known that he would die.
Draco keeps hold of his hand as he leads him upstairs, and he can’t ignore the thrill of it. Everything he’s done, everything that’s been done to him, and holding this one man’s hand is making his heart race. It seems more intimate, somehow, than anything else they’ve done. Perhaps because of its innocence.
Weasley leans forwards, his elbows on his knees and his hands clasped under his chin. He doesn’t start right away, as if unsure what to ask first.
Hours later and they’re both bladdered. They say their goodbyes, Simi trying to dart meaningful glances between Harry and himself, but too bleary-eyed to execute it properly. Draco hails the Knight Bus, and the lurching and squeezing makes him cross his fingers and beg to Salazar that he doesn’t throw up all over Harry. Harry’s head is flopping on his shoulder, and he keeps rubbing his cheek against the silky fabric of his shirt. He strokes carefully over Draco’s eyelid, looking at the glitter now on his fingertip, mumbling something that sounds like
Yes, dinner goes well. It goes very well indeed. They talk and laugh well past the time they’ve cleared their plates, until they’re moving into the living room, wine glasses in hand. Harry has his legs tucked up under him on the sofa, his knees pressing into Draco’s side. They’re listing closer and closer together as the night wears on and the wine bottle empties, voices softening and lowering with the light.
Draco stands abruptly, and wipes his hands on his trousers. “Okay then. We’ve still got lots to talk about, so we should probably get comfortable. Finish your bath and I’ll meet you in the kitchen.”
He’s saved from further interrogation by Millicent and Blaise, who sit down in Potter and Finch-Fletchley’s vacant chairs.
. How fucked up is it that he can have sex with a man he’s wanted to murder on a dozen different occasions, but not with his loving boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend, now. Thinking of being on his knees, almost choking but still so turned on, he feels a shiver run through him. That part was almost better than coming himself, and isn’t that a revelation?
Draco folds his arms, trying to hide his trembling. Whether he’s shaking with anger or trying not to cry, Harry can’t tell. Maybe both. “Then what was it like?”
Draco unlocks Harry’s hands from behind his neck so he can tug his t-shirt over his head. He rubs his hands up and down Harry’s chest, his eyes a physical weight. Harry notices that he’s avoiding paying too much attention to Harry’s nipples, and he realises that he’s probably worried about setting him off on another panic attack. On the one hand, he’s grateful for the consideration. On the other hand, he wishes he wasn’t such a headcase- that Draco didn’t need to be careful with him.
In the end he doesn’t say anything. Actions always speak louder than words. Harry strides into the room, Draco straightens up as he sees him, his smile growing wider. Cupping the back of his neck in his hand, he brings their faces together. The first press of their lips together is firm, unyielding. Draco opens his mouth in surprise, and it becomes warm and impossibly soft. Draco brings his hands to hold Harry by the top of his arms, and for a few delirious seconds he kisses him back. Draco pushes Harry away, keeping his grip on his arms.
His mind turns to Draco. He’s lost everything, everyone. He still found the time to visit Luna and apologise. Harry jolted upright. Luna. If there was ever anyone who’s outlook on life was refreshing, if not the most down to earth, it was her. He goes to the fireplace and flicks his wand, igniting a blaze too warm for the summer evening. Taking a pinch of glittering green powder from the pot on the mantelpiece, he throws it in. The fire turns a deep emerald, and the heat cools to something bearable. Harry kneels down and cranes his head into the flames.
What should he tell him? I’ve been having nightmares and now I think something bad is going to happen to you, so I want you to get your fortune told by an old lady I’ve only known a week? That won’t go down well. Harry’s stomach grumbles. In trying to escape Narcissa he’d left without breakfast, and it was well past noon.
In reality, it’s very unlikely someone will hear them. There’s no reason for anyone to be in this part of the Manor. Unless, of course, they also plan to have earth-shattering sex with their partner who used to be their fuckbuddy who used to be their nemesis. Still, that small kernel of doubt is both dangerous and exciting, sending a wriggling little shiver up his spine.
He surges upwards and climbs onto Malfoy’s lap, the need to finish momentarily eclipsed by the need to kiss him. It conveniently puts him in reach of Malfoy’s hands, and that hasn’t gone without notice. One wraps around to the small of his back, pushing them closer together. The other moves to his flies. Dozens of times, this has been the moment Harry backs away, when someone tries to touch him. Right now, he so busy sucking a bruise into Malfoy’s neck that he forgets he’s supposed to panic.
The voice is weak, but definitely present. “Here, duckie.” In the back room Granny is settling herself back into her chair, looking shaken but unharmed. “Set her down on the chair, Draco.”
“They’ve just finished their Master’s degree, and want to celebrate with an inordinate amount of booze, and weed, and fun people,” he says. “It’s not that complicated.”
“That’s right,” Draco nods. “Well, I noticed there’s a certain… dynamic we seem to fall into, when we have sex, and I wondered if you wanted to explore that further.”
Harry gasps. It feels like there’s a buzzing under his skin, causing liquid to bead at the tip of his cock. He’s never felt anything like it. Draco’s tongue is almost rough, his skin so sensitive he thinks he might be able to feel the tastebuds. Harry wriggles, overcome with a potent mixture of bliss and embarrassment.
Ginny opens her mouth to explain, but he’s promptly saved the embarrassment by Arthur sinking onto the sofa beside him and declaring “We’re saved!”
He raises one eyebrow and taps his nails on the cover, and Harry see he’s painted them an understated peach colour. Harry doesn’t know any other men who paint their nails, and it manages to be unbelievably elegant, ballsy, and sexy all at once. A lot like Draco himself.
He’s sweating, and from the glimpses of Draco caught between trees, the back of his neck as he hoots and speeds away, his sharp and blinding grin as he manages to attack without warning, Draco’s getting hot too. Harry pauses for a moment, the sun piercing his eyes, when something crashes into him from behind. It’s solid, warm, and heavy. Harry clings onto the fabric of Draco’s shirt as he tries to knock him to the ground and pulls him down with him. The breath is forced from his lungs as Draco lies on top of him, his own fall broken by Harry’s body.
The Ace of Cups is tricky. Harry’s first thought is of the Goblet of Fire, and being thrust into something he isn’t ready for. His second thought is of the passage he’d read in ‘
Draco trails off, and he knows exactly what he’s talking about. When Draco told him about his teenage fantasy, and Harry rode him for the first time.
“But you’re reading a book, and all the books in the library belong to Papa.” Dudley took the book and closed it, sneering at the cover. “Not you.”
With that, a familiar expression blossomed on Dudley’s pale face. It’s the expression he wore when he was aware Harry had just said something insolent, but wasn’t intelligent enough to work out exactly why it was insulting. This combination of anger and embarrassment unfailingly resulted in violence. The book came down on hard on Harry’s forehead, splitting his scar and making it look new for the first time in his memory.
Harry grit his teeth. “So you talked about it in public where anyone could hear? You couldn’t even go to a muggle bar to discuss my private business?”
He frowns, and tries to channel his inner Hermione. “Um, the more you revise the better you’ll do. It’s up to you how your exams go.”
His words ring a faint bell, an echo of another conversation. Another kiss. The thought fades as fast as it came- overtaken by the press of Draco’s thigh against his dick. He removes Harry’s glasses, barely pulling back far enough to take them off, and tucks them into his breast pocket. Little red lines mark his face from where the metal frames have pressed in. He kisses Harry again, several short kisses, like he means to stop but keeps being reeled back in.
The approval moves through his blood like honey as Draco leans down to kiss him. The caress of his tongue on the roof of Harry’s mouth is a sharp contrast to the hands that clamp down on his hips, threatening bruises. Draco grabs his wand and casts the usual spells, nipping and sucking at Harry’s lips all the while. He moves away, tugging at Harry’s bottom lip with his teeth as he goes. His own are shiny with spit, and Harry strains his neck to try and chase him. Draco has no mercy, and only shuffles back, parting Harry’s legs to make room for him to lie between them. Instead of putting his fingers where Harry expects him to, he ducks his head down, bypassing his aching dick to lick his hole.
said Draco, wondering if magic had a scent their sensitive noses could pick up on. Of course, he’d forgotten who he was with. Simi leaned in, sniffed, and nodded.
The kitchen is down a set of stone stairs, worn to a curve by hundreds of years of feet. Windows line the top foot of one kitchen wall, casting sharp beams of light onto the sturdy wooden table. Draco flicks his wand and lamps flare to life, suspended from the ceiling in clusters.
He whispers, scared to break out of the scene they’ve painted themselves into. “Do you want to go upstairs?”
A blonde woman runs out of the back room, knocking into his shoulder in her hurry to leave. Barely noticing, Harry walks into the room she’d just left, and freezes in the doorway. Granny lies in front of her chair, her head pillowed on her arm, grey hair spilling over her face. Earl sniffs around her, whining softly. Harry throws himself to his knees beside her, and sees the hair over her mouth moving gently with her breath. She’s alive.
“Actually,” he says. “This soot is a bigger problem than you might think. If it had been removed right away it wouldn’t matter, but it’s corrosive, and it eats away at the stone over time. The walls, the ceilings, even the marble floors. They’re all going to need work.”
“I’m not sure I do. I’m average at a lot of things, and I’m good at Quidditch, but no impressive skills,” he says, staring into his mug.
“I didn’t expect it to hurt this much,” she says, shaking her head. “I hadn’t seen her in years, and I’ve lost the people dearest to me in the world; it should be a drop in the ocean by now.”
“All I know is that you’re injured, and I don’t know if you’re going to be okay.” He takes a deep breath. “That’s why I wanted you to come here, so Granny can read her Tarot cards and see if you’ll be okay.”
“Yeah. It actually happened last Thursday, but I wasn’t ready to talk about it before. I know I should have said something on Friday, but I just… It was like I thought if I didn’t tell anyone then it wouldn’t be real.”
Draco lifts Harry’s chin with a crooked finger, a treacherous smile on his face. “You don’t mind if I take this do you, darling?”
Harry’s eyes widen, blurring with guilt. “I didn’t mean to lead him on. I wasn’t trying to flirt, or anything.”
“Yes, that’s my good boy,” rumbles Draco, voice deep enough that Harry can feel the vibrations in his mouth. “My sweet darling.”
When Draco runs his fingers over Harry’s scalp he can’t stop a moan sounding, guttural, from the back of his throat. Still loose from his first orgasm, his muscles relaxed under the hot water, he might have fallen asleep if he wasn’t so turned on. Draco shields Harry’s eyes with his palm and tips his head back under the water, rinsing out the suds.
Lying on their backs in the sun, they let the silence wash over them. Soon they’ll go their separate ways to clean up and put salve on their bruises. Soon they’ll go back to their adult lives, with their adult responsibilities, and forget the innocent joy of the afternoon. Soon. But not yet.
“You keep saying that, and yet you’re not actually moving.” Harry turns to go, and actually takes a few steps towards the door, when Malfoy speaks again. “Wait. There really was something I wanted to talk to you about. What I actually wanted to do was apologise.”
Draco Malfoy looks like he wants to lean casually against the doorjamb, but that would mean getting his clothes stained with curse residue, so he has to make do with an insolent expression. This time he’s dressed in muggle clothes, instead of the black robes Harry saw him in before. They would look completely normal, if Queen Victoria was still on the throne. As it is, the silk waistcoat, the pressed trousers, and the embroidered cuffs of his shirt make him look like a fairy tale prince. Or an eccentric. Possibly both.
He doesn’t get up from where he’s sitting on the hardwood floor, so Draco walks over to stand in front of him.
The other finger joins the first, still only up to the knuckle. It doesn’t hurt yet, but Harry knows they’ll need more than spit to prepare him properly.
Harry decides to take her original advice, and goes for a walk. He takes precautions, pulling a Molly-knitted hat over his distinctive hair and scar. The muggle park is close to Grimmauld Place, with a large pond lined with bulrushes, and he always used to like feeding the ducks.
They set off into the treetops, Draco using his shirt to collect ammunition, and Harry choosing to stay mobile and pick apples from trees as he flies. The first sails past Harry’s ear, and while he laughs, a second hits him in the shoulder. Soon unripe fruit flies through the air and is met with grunts of pain and squawks of laughter. It’s all the fun of a snowball fight without the wet gloves and cold hands; the elation of Quidditch without the pressure of an audience. He’d be covered in bruises, but what’s magic for if not smoothing over the inconvenient edges of life?
Harry cuts off his raspy babble with a desperate kiss. Their teeth clack together, and there’s no finesse in the way Harry’s tongue is licking into his mouth, but it’s still the best kiss of Draco’s life. There’s one hand pulling at his hair (just on the wrong side of too hard and just the way he likes it) and another hand pinning him back to the arm of the sofa. Harry’s never taken control like this before- Draco’s never wanted to just sit back and let someone ravish him like this before, either.
He comes midsentence, like Harry before him, sighing against the wet skin of his back. They just breath for a minute, Draco softening on Harry’s leg.  Then, Draco starts to wash him. His hands are so gentle, such a contrast to the frantic energy of the moment before. When he’s done Harry’s back half he turns him round by his waist, still so, so gently. He reaches out and grabs a bottle from a shelf, pouring a small amount of shampoo in his hand and reaching up to lather Harry’s hair. There’s no scent, and for a moment Harry regrets that; he want to smell like Draco. Like he belongs to him.
Millicent kisses Draco on the cheek, slaps Blaise a little too hard on the back, nods to Potter, and makes her way round the rest of the pub to say her goodbyes. At that point, Blaise spots Goldstein on the way to the bar, his eyes lingering on his (admittedly firm) behind. He buggers off to flirt with him or bother him, depending on your point of view, leaving Draco and Potter alone. They barely have time to look at each other, Potter drawing a breath to speak, when Granger and the Ginerva claim the empty seats.
That makes absolutely no sense, of course he’s the same person as himself, but Harry’s distracted by the realisation of where Draco picked up his habit of saying ‘Lord’ from.
The crows erupts into noise, vaulting so many questions at him he can’t hear a single one. He pushes through to the door, where he turns round to address them. “Quiet!” he calls, trying to conceal his impatience but still needing to be heard. “Can somebody, and by that I mean one person, please tell me what’s going on?”
“That’s a shame, because it’s the last time I’m touching you tonight. You’re here for my pleasure, not yours. You’re here for me to use, isn’t that right?”
Ron takes a loud slurp of tea, and Hermione glares at him. Harry clears his throat. A large part of him wants to just spill his guts about everything that’s happened with Draco, but an even larger part of him knows that Ron would blow up, and he isn’t in the mood to deal with that. He’s going to have to get a little creative with the truth. Shit. Harry hates lying, and what’s more, he’s terrible at it.
He palms Harry’s crotch where he’s already half hard, and pulls his trousers and boxers down together. Holding Harry in the circle of his fist, he begins to move up and down, until he’s finally ready. Pushing Harry gently to lie flat on his back, he takes him in his mouth without hesitation. Harry’s breath hitches, half reaching for Terran’s hair before changing his mind and twisting his hands into the bed sheets.
“We were just telling Harry about Draco’s younger days,” says Tabby, before turning back to him. “He was a mess.”
“He’s been very polite in his letters,” he explains. “Been very apologetic, too. He’s also very passionate about the project, so I don’t see why he can’t be a partner.”
“In the end, the facts are these,” says Granny. “One: our memories are powerful enough to influence the present. Two: love can be used to save someone from certain death, as happened to Harry as a baby. Three: Harry has some power over the dead, the limits of which we don’t yet know. From there, we can only draw our own conclusions.”
“Yeah, yeah,” he says, waving a hand. “I’m lazy, I’m arrogant, and you hate my hair. I’ve heard it all before. Will you come back to bed now? You’re making me cold just looking at you.”
He shifts Teddy’s weight over to one arm, feeling a small familiar thrill at being better at something than Malfoy, and hands her the small parcel. She opens it, revealing a rubber duck. At first it looks clear, with a small mechanism inside. He flicks a small switch underneath and it starts glowing pink from within, then promptly fades into purple. Every few seconds it switches to a new colour of the rainbow. Teddy changes the colour of his hair to match, giggling every time.
Harry turns in the circle of his arms and drops roughly to his knees. His kneecaps smart against the cold floor, but he barely notices. He takes Draco’s cock out and swallows him down without preamble. He’s gotten a lot of practice at this since that first time, and he only seems to enjoy it more each time. Maybe it’s because he always learns a new way to make Draco’s hiss out a curse, or the increasing ease with which he fits more and more into his mouth. Maybe it’s the way he’s gotten used to the bitter taste, so he can actually appreciate having yet another of his senses taken over entirely by Draco. Maybe it’s the way he feels so vital and wanted, on his knees in worship. It’s moments like this he can believe Draco when he says he’s beautiful, precious,
He rushes into the space between Harry’s thighs and kisses him with an almost naïve enthusiasm. Harry feels worn out, and still shivery with praise. Draco pushing back in batters against some wall in his head, one that somehow hadn’t been knocked down when Draco was fucking him before, and he is inexplicably euphoric. He’s soft, his dick can’t even twitch, but it still feels so good. Facing him, he can finally see how dishevelled Draco looks, the flush on his cheeks. Making Draco this undone feels like a bigger achievement than anything else he’s done in years.
The night Potter slept in Draco’s bed was simultaneously one of the best and worst of his life. The best, because he had Potter sleeping next to him. He’d curled around his body, heard the noises he made in his sleep. The worst, because it was a stolen moment. Just a teasing facsimile of what he really wanted.
He ducks his head, somehow embarrassed despite just having had Draco’s cock in his mouth. “Don’t make me say it.”
A realisation sparked from the back of Harry’s mind. “The woman with the blue eyes, is she a relative?”
Lying there, sticky and uncomfortable with his head on the kitchen floor, Harry catches his breath. Draco is a solid weight above him, platinum hair tickling his face.
In moments like that, he could forget he was bored. He could pretend that his thoughts didn’t stray to messy hair and green eyes. He could pretend he didn’t want to apparate to wherever Potter was and pick a fight with him almost every day, just so that he would look at him again. Maybe even hit him. That would be better, that would mean touching.
Granny sips her tea. “Did you know a cat’s purr has a healing, soothing property? Science says it’s something to do with vibrations, but you can’t deny the element of companionship, the restorative power of just being there together.”
Once the strong, but not entirely unpleasant, tea was finished Granny pushed her own cup in front of him. “Swirl the dregs and tip them into the saucer then tell me what you think.”
Number Twelve Grimmauld Place had been the scene of countless meetings for the Order of the Phoenix, and they all took place around the kitchen table. The wood is dark, with deep gouges sanded over but still visible, like curse marks that couldn’t be fully repaired. There are still dishes in the sink, and Harry sets them cleaning with a twirl of his wand. He always forgets to do it. The light is low, but warm, reflecting off the shiny brass handles that adorn each cupboard.
Harry’s thoughts stutter and die at that last broken sentence, and he hears himself whine from a distance. He arches his back, pushing his chest harder into the wood, doing everything he can to keep Malfoy saying these things to him. He’s hitting his prostrate almost every time now, small sounds escaping and being stifled in an endless cycle.
Harry nods, too tired to deny himself something he wants so badly. Draco takes his hand again, and apparates them straight into Harry’s kitchen. Without saying anything he goes over to Harry’s kettle, and with slow and unsure hands, starts to make tea.
“Now now, there’s no need for that,” says the bearded man. “My name is Wolfgang. This is Herbert, and our intern Marla. At your service.” He makes a deep and extravagant bow.
“And you’re not to call me Malfoy. If I’m going to have you screaming my name, you’d better call me Draco.” He tilts Harry’s chin up until their lips brush. “Do you understand?”
After that, Nick goes to fetch another drink and doesn’t return, and Jake and Tabitha become embroiled in a complicated discussion of figure skating with a professorial looking gentleman. That leaves him and Angus, sitting together awkwardly.
The idea of Malfoy coddling him again, like he did yesterday, makes him tense up. If it was Terran, he’d want to be held and reassured. But coming from Malfoy, it would be out of a sense of obligation, not affection. Still, he had seemed concerned, yesterday.
Draco cocks his head thoughtfully. “Everyone looked to you to save them. You had to make the kind of decisions no one should ever have to make, let alone a child. That kind of responsibility is a lot to bear. It would make sense, if you needed to let go, let somebody else take charge.”
Apparently Blaise is the Designated Disapparater, because he’s nursing a coke with a bewildered expression, eyes going back and forth between him and Potter.
“That you’re at the beginning of something important, and the choices you make now will change the course of your life. You are about to transform, in one way or another.”
Harry whacks her shoulder, and taking a deep breath, decides to deal with one dilemma at a time. “How did you know you like girls? As well as boys, I mean.”
Harry thinks of curses cast in a flooded bathroom, and grits his jaw. Draco has scars from a spells Harry cast in panic, so he can’t exactly condemn Aisling for the same. If Draco can forgive, then so can he.
“I meant it.” He cradles Potter’s face, encouraging him to meet his eyes. “Is that something you want?”
“Well,” says Draco thoughtfully, leaning back in his chair. “You can do something for me. Would that satisfy your Gryffindor sense of fairness?”
Splashed across the front page, in moving black and white, is Terran Jones. And he’s holding someone’s hand.
Angus’s hands are nearly twice the size of his when he goes for a handshake, but his grip is light and easy. “Good to meet you, Harry.”
Funny indeed. Harry takes a breath. “I want to hire you to fix the wards. You’ve been looking at them anyway, and I know it’s something you can do because you’ve done it before. Anyway, it just seems important, and it would mean a lot to me if you would.”
Harry clenches his fist in his own hair, pulling until it’s painful. “You can still stay; I just can’t do that tonight.”
Sometime later, and they’ve forgotten what they were supposed to be doing, in favour of talking huddled close together. It’s an unseasonably cold night, and the fire and heat of their bodies draw them closer. A cool grey figure drifts through the wall behind them, already speaking.
When a burly, dark haired man arrives, Draco nudges him with his elbow. “This is one of people I wanted you to meet,” he says, before waving to the man.
“So,” says Granny, plonking two mugs of tea onto the table and sweeping the cards out of the way. “I see death is on your mind.”
The funeral is predictably bleak. A handful of people gather in the mausoleum, in a circle around her obsidian coffin. It’s strange to think her body is inside, when Harry had listened to her teasing and complaining just that morning. The service is short, and no one makes a speech, but a few people leave flowers. Malfoy clutches a bouquet of daffodils to his chest, before laying them on the casket. Their bright yellow colour and common nature seem incongruous with their family’s love of all things monochrome and elegant, but he supposes they must have some personal significance. He’d ask Narcissa, if he didn’t think she’d object to such a personal question. She’d probably walk through him. Harry shudders thinking about it.
It’s as her wide eyes sweep the room that she sees Draco, her smile turning from dreamy to sunlit. It always amazes him how someone as kind and lovely as Luna could want to be friends with someone like him, but he supposes that’s just one of her eccentricities. She hunts for imaginary creatures and thinks a former Death Eater is ‘sweet’ and ‘funny’. Waving over-excitedly, she almost knocks Potter’s beer out of his hand. Potter looks up to see her beckoning him over, and Draco obliges, filled with gratitude and relief. Not only has he been welcomed into the fold, but he has an excuse to spend time with Potter without it
Draco wastes no more time. Fucking Harry with an almost religious ecstasy, he looks like a devout man lost in prayer. Harry feels torn apart, like Draco could rip him to pieces and he’d kiss him for it. Draco said this was about control for him, but Harry has never seen him look wilder. His eyes are the colour of ice, of hell frozen over, and he can’t look away.
He stands and takes hold of Harry’s wrist, pulling him up. Keeping hold of him, grip not tight but still firm, he leads Harry to the bedroom. His breathing is coming faster, nervous anticipation coursing through him. Draco guides Harry to stand in front of the bed, closing the door behind him, and finally lets go of his arm.
Draco continues, seemingly unaffected. “Did you imagine leaving the curtains open, so that if anyone happened to walk by, they’d see us? Did you imagine having to stay quiet, because the house is full of people preparing for tonight? Or maybe it’s the opposite. Maybe you want to be loud, maybe you want everyone to know.”
Draco sighs, and stares into his glass. Looking into the fathomless green of Harry’s eyes as he tells him this can only make it more overwhelming. Nervously, he licks his lips.
The Healer goes over to the young woman where she’s sat in the purple chair, and presses her wand to her chest. The sound of her breathing is amplified, and he hears an unsettling rattle.
Harry unrolls the newspaper he’s still clutching, and a picture of himself looks back. It’s from yesterday, and shows him leaving the shop, the sign carefully framed in the background. The headline reads: ‘
Arthur shakes his head. “I would ask what happened here, but I don’t think that would be helpful or productive. Let’s just see what we can do about it.”
Unbelievably, Harry starts to get hard again. He hasn’t recovered this fast since he was a teenager, but everything about Draco is getting under his skin.
“Fine then,” he says, throwing up his hands. “I’m not sorry I acted like a mad man, and shoved you, and made you sit on the floor for ages. That was all completely normal, I’ve no idea why anyone would be bothered about that!”
Arthur descends the stairs into the living room, brandishing a rectangular object. “I found it! It was buried in a box of walkie-talkies, but I found it.”
There is nowhere he’d rather be right now. Offer him the endless mirror of the Bolivian salt flats, the stars reflected in a desert oasis, the aurora borealis seen from a snowy mountainside- they’re nothing compared to this bed, in this little cottage in Hertfordshire, where Harry Potter is.
Outside the shop, he turns to the owl and says “Can you find number 12 Grimmauld Place? I’ll meet you there later.”
Harry panics. He might not hate her anymore, but he certainly doesn’t want the ghost of a middle-aged woman haunting his bedroom. “Wouldn’t you prefer to spend time with Malfoy? You said he’s alone.”
Teddy starts gurgling, and Harry pulls him onto his lap. “It’s not like you to downplay an injury. In third year you milked that scratch for all it was worth.”
Draco cocks his head and hums thoughtfully. “I think they would feel extremely supported and grateful if you would find something to do, preferably in a different room, so that you stop giving me miniature heart attacks by constantly bending over to pick things up.” He shakes his head in exasperation. “Either you forget that you have a wand to do these things for you, or you’re determined to drive me to distraction!”
Malfoy grits his teeth and nods. “Potter.” He looks down at Teddy and tries to manoeuvre him onto his hip to free up his hand, but can’t get it right. Andromeda intervenes and takes Teddy from him.
“What?” says Jake with a mild frown, the most extreme expression Harry’s seen from him. “That posh boarding school in Scotland?”
Draco crooks his fingers, stroking inside him. “You’ll probably come if I get you ready for my cock like this. We can’t have that, can we?”
Harry giggles again, youthful and relaxed, and turns in his arms to face him. “He did look at me a lot.”
“So what did you tell Hermione?” asks Harry, as he places two plates of the hot and garlic-heavy Bolognese on the kitchen table. The steam from the pasta fogs his glasses, and he wipes them with his sleeve before replacing them.
Draco sighs wistfully. “I’ve missed this shithole. I miss having tea with Mrs Lali upstairs, and fighting with the landlord.”
Minutes later he sends his Patronus trotting up to fetch Draco for lunch, feeling that he wouldn’t appreciate Harry yelling up the length of the house. He walks into the kitchen with a pleased flush on his cheeks, his hair in his eyes, and a half drunk mug of tea. Harry wants to see that every day, if he can.
“When we’re like this,” he says, illustrating his meaning with a squeeze at Harry’s waist. “I’ll call you darling. It rather suits you right now, though I imagine I’ll feel differently when you’ve got your clothes back on.”
Malfoy is still there, looking out the empty window into the night. Harry marches towards him, barely slowing down, almost colliding with him before Malfoy turns around. He doesn’t have time to form a question, or even an expression, before Harry is kissing him. It’s short, but fierce, with a flash of pain as Malfoy’s tooth cuts into his bottom lip.
Grabbing his wand, he summons a dildo. Not one of the biggest but definitely a mouthful. Draco holds the plastic head against slack lips, not pushing it inside- letting Potter decide if he wants it.

“I understand,” says Draco. “I wouldn’t say I’m happy about it, but I understand. Fear can make us do terrible things.”
“Well You-Know-Who didn’t have shit on me,” she says. “Do you remember when Daphne Greengrass spilled punch down my dress at the Yule ball, just because I called her a fugly slag?”
He hadn’t been sure that Pansy knew how he felt until that moment, but perhaps he really is that obvious.
After that it’s a whirlwind of fabric, Harry occasionally nipping back to Grimmauld to offer up different shirts and shoes for their inspection.
“Don’t pretend!” he shouts. “Don’t pretend you care when I know you’re only doing it for her. She told you to help me, because of the fucking life debt, but I don’t want you to.” He swallows, and gets to feet, looking down on Harry. “I don’t need your pity, Potter.”
Draco grins, pleased with himself, and pulls Harry out of bed. “Don’t bother getting dressed on my account.”
, he’d said. It feels a little like a lie. Or else, it’s not the whole truth. Because ever since Terran cornered him in his own kitchen, Harry was forced to admit to himself that he everything he’d ever felt for that man isn’t even half of what Draco makes him feel with just one glance. ‘I care about you’ feels like a lie, because he wanted to say ‘I love you.’
Draco’s bathroom manages to be both cluttered and orderly. Every shelf seems to host a wide array of gels and potions and creams, all spaced a centimetre apart, labels facing outwards. How long does it take him to get up in the morning? Still, whatever he does, it works for him. Hair shiny yet soft, skin clear, and always smelling dark and sweet. Like burnt sugar. Harry supposes some people would describe Draco as feminine. The way he dresses, the way he moves his hands. Still, there is a power behind his pretty façade, a confidence that doesn’t rely on proving he’s a man.
He grabs Draco by the hand and pulls him out into the hall and through the winding manor. He hears Draco making token protests, wondering if he heard anything else he’d said, but he clearly doesn’t mind. Everything really is done, Draco’s fanatical organisation skills winning out over Arthur’s absentminded optimism, and now he’s just fussing. Eventually, Harry leads them through the opposite wing of the Manor to the ballroom. The guests won’t be anywhere near this part of the building tonight, and it’s completely abandoned except for the two of them.
Up close, he can see the flecks of blue and gold in Potter’s green eyes. It’s like looking up through a canopy of trees in summer. Draco starts to worry his lovesickness is showing on his face, so he says something glib as a distraction.
Then it clicks, and he walks Potter backwards into the wall of books. Crushing him into the shelving, the wood must be digging into Potter’s back, but his gasp doesn’t sound pained. He leans into him, letting him feel his weight, and Draco wonders if Potter can feel how hard his heart is beating where their chests are pressed together. Stood together like this, Draco can really take advantage of the height difference between them. It’s not dramatic, only a few inches, but enough that he can give the impression of looking down on Potter. What was that silly thing he’d said? That he wanted to ‘have his wicked way with him’? Well, he certainly feels wicked now.
“I told you about my twin brother, and how he was the only one in my family who really cared for me. What I didn’t tell you, was that we were identical twins. My apparent lack of magic wasn’t the only reason my parents disapproved of me. After my brother died, he left everything to me. His money, his house, even his pocket watch. In his will he called me his sister, Lynn. My parents said that since he didn’t have a sister, only a brother, that everything would go to them.” Granny turns her face upwards, as if lost in memory. “They were rich, they could afford lawyers, and I had nothing. I stayed for Rowan’s funeral, then I took the pocket watch and ran.”
Ginny sighs with relief. “Thank fuck for that, because if you blew your lid and asked me to stop seeing her I’d have to say no.”
“You should wear your own shoes though,” says Millie. “It’ll be terribly obvious you’ve had help if you look
Shame that Malfoy had to ruin it by being a prick, but then that’s why it worked in the first place. The tension between them can be put to other uses. He’s not going to do it again, though. Harry’s proven that he can do it, there’s no need to go back for more. Still, there’s a thread pulling at the back of Harry’s head, reminding him that Malfoy hadn’t been a prick the whole time. An even more traitorous part of his brain whispers that Malfoy had been kinder to him than Terran, more patient. That doesn’t change anything, though. He loves Terran, and running back to Malfoy isn’t going to get his real relationship back on track. Harry drifts off to sleep remembering the feel of Malfoy’s fingers running through his hair.
He pulls them both to the ground until they’re lying in the doorway, half on the kitchen tiles and half on the wooden floorboards of the hall. Draco knocks his elbow on the floor on the way down, letting out a very un-sexy yelp.
Narcissa remains silent, as she has all morning. He opens his wardrobe, and takes out a dark suit. It’s the same one he wears for all formal occasions, and is probably extremely unfashionable by now, but at least it still fits.
Draco frowns. “I can barely understand how you can want me at all, let alone love me. I know you’re stupidly selfless sometimes Harry, but you don’t have to say you love me because you think I want to hear it.”
Harry swallows, and sits himself down on Draco’s knees without a word. Draco’s arm wraps around his stomach, squeezing once before going lax, and staying there. Harry gulps at his drink, wishing he’d made it stronger. Samuel sits in the vacant spot, and it puts him directly opposite Harry and Draco. As hard as Draco’s stare is, Samuel doesn’t flinch.
Draco was oddly touched. She invited him for Christmas dinner every year, but Draco always refused. He couldn’t see his mother, as she was on house arrest and he couldn’t go anywhere as magical as
Harry laughs, and Hermione’s anxious gaze is directed at him instead. “How are you, Harry? We’ve not really talked since last week and you’ve been a bit… quiet.”
If they’re going to do this, for the first time, it’s not happening on a sofa. Draco breathes his answer, so quiet Harry mostly reads it on his lips. Harry apparates them straight to the bedroom; he doesn’t want to wait any longer. They collapse onto the bed together, and Harry pulls Draco to lie on top of him. He wants to pretend the rest of the world doesn’t exist, wants to shut it out and fill the space with Draco.
If they weren’t in company, Draco might have succumbed to a similar level of childishness and stuck his tongue out at him.
She picks up the worn t-shirt he’d flung over the back of a chair instead of putting away with her thumb and forefinger, like something disgusting she was about to throw in a cauldron. “Under normal circumstances, I’d say you were right.” She gives him a disapproving look, and throws the t-shirt at him. “But I am as likely to become a poltergeist as you are to clean up your mess.”
Draco holds his hand out for Granny to shake, looking like he expects to be turned down, but resolutely keeping it there anyway. “A pleasure to meet you, Ms Lynn.”
“Excuse me for not attending to it sooner, Potter, but seeing as I was exiled to live as a muggle, it was rather out of my hands.”
Harry doesn’t voice his thoughts aloud. Instead, he says: “It’s not that bad. Fighting each other’s just habit, at this point.”
He kisses the tears away from his face, never ceasing the steady pendulum of his hips. Draco continues to whisper sweet nonsense to him, cradling his head in one large palm and holding up his leg with the other.
Draco captures his hand, and presses his knuckles to his lips. “You deserve to be taken care of Harry.”
Weasley nods. “Fine. But I’m bringing the verituserum, so I know you haven’t fucked with it. And it’ll have to be later, my lunch break’s nearly over.”
“Sorry Harry, the pixies get very grumpy without a proper nights sleep and light wakes them up. Noise doesn’t seem to bother them though, so don’t worry about that.” She puts three mugs of Gurdyroot ‘tea’ onto the table. “Yes, she’s upstairs. I’ll just go and get her.”
Draco cleans them up properly this time, feeling a pang of regret as he watches the dripping mix of come and lube and salve wash out of Potter’s arsehole. Maybe he should ask Potter if he can leave it there one time. Draco sighs. It’s dangerous to make plans; they have a way of falling apart.
The reply is surprisingly swift, and appears to be scrawled across the back of a page of notes on Giant-Centaur relations.
“It’s Harry, remember?” he huffs. “And I think I’d know if there was a whole other room in my own house.”
landing on top with a foreboding thud. It’s upside down, so he can’t see the headline, but the sheer thickness hints at a scandal.
Watching the scene unfold, Draco wants to vomit a little. To see another man with Potter, with his mouth on him, makes him so jealous it blinds him for a moment. Then he breaths, and looks, and he wants to be sick again. Potter looks so nervous, his fingers twisting in the sheets, his expression unsure. The blonde man moves his mouth off him, says something, and suddenly Draco recognises him. Star Quidditch player Terran Jones, Potter’s ex-boyfriend.
We'll be back to Harry's POV next chapter, and then mixing it up from there on. No additional warnings in this one, it's actually a very wholesome chapter.
He’s standing in front of his floo, powder in hand, and at this moment he’d rather face a basilisk armed only with a quill and a dungbomb. It’s time for Sunday lunch at the Burrow. It’s not that he doesn’t want to see them, but he doesn’t want to see them knowing full well that he’s had sex with Malfoy four times in less than a week. There’s no way he’ll be able to look Molly in the eye when he can still feel him inside him. Not literally of course, he’s had two showers since then, but he can still feel him somehow.
Draco moves to help him, undoing the buttons faster than Harry’s shaking fingers. His shirt hangs off his shoulders, but their pressed to close together. Then his hands go to Harry’s stomach, the touch to his sensitive skin making him jolt upwards.
“Nonsense,” she says. “We both know you’ve got absolutely nothing better to do, so sit down and have a cup of tea with a poor old woman, there’s a good lad.”
It’s true that he wants to use Potter, wants to own him like that, but it’s not the whole truth. He also just wants it to last, wants to drag it out. Every moment he has Potter he’s counting down the seconds until he leaves again. If he can keep him in limbo that way, like a stasis charm, Draco could fool himself into believing it’s forever.
Death is simpler. Granny has talked about it more than any other card. They had discussed it in relation to the baby in his tea leaves. Endings making way for new beginnings. A transformation.
“Fine,” he says, caving like a house of cards under Harry’s hopeful gaze. “But you’ll have to check with them first, I refuse to turn up unannounced.”
Harry breathes a sigh of relief tinged with pleasure. Draco stands and moves towards him, but still doesn’t touch. He feels greedy for him, desperate for Draco to kiss him, reassure him. Still, underneath the frustration there is a layer of…something. Maybe he enjoys being teased, or maybe he just knows that Draco enjoys teasing him; he knows he enjoys giving Draco what he wants.
So he kisses him again. And he doesn’t intend to stop. Draco seems to agree, because he wraps one arm around his back, puts one hand at his waist, and holds him so tightly he might burst. Distantly, Harry recognises it’s good to feel like he doesn’t have to be strong. He can be, but he doesn’t have to be. He lets Draco take the lead, pushing him back onto the sofa.
“You should have come to us straight away,” scolds Hermione. “I can’t believe you just dealt with it by yourself. Or didn’t deal with it, knowing you.”
“Thank you,” says Andromeda. “This will be very helpful.” She puts the duck down, and claps her hands together. “I’d better get started on dinner. You’ll both stay, won’t you?
“Right,” says Draco, standing abruptly. “It’s been a pleasure. I’ll see you all soon, though some sooner than others.” He’s rambling now, but he can’t seem to stop. “Au revoir, à bientôt and all that.”
Harry huffs. Malfoy thinks he far cleverer than he is, but right then he doesn’t care. He just wants to touch him. He closes the distance between them. “Is that everything? Because I think I want to try and suck your dick.”
“He’d do no such thing, I raised him better than that. Besides, It doesn’t matter how you do it, just that you do. I will be staying right here until I feel you’ve fulfilled your promise to me,” she says, sitting down in a chair by his bed and crossing her ankles delicately.
“Oh,” says Harry. He’s surprised at Malfoy’s… thoughtfulness, he supposes. Harry’s stomach lurches as he remembers Terran’s words.
He wraps one arm around Harry’s chest and puts the other at his hip, just like when he fucked Harry on the kitchen table. Harry pushes his arse backwards, into Draco’s erection. “Squeeze your thighs together, darling. I promise I’ll fuck you properly later.”
“Good boy,” purrs Draco, and he’s not smiling- he’s baring his teeth. He grasps Harry’s hands and winds them round the back of his neck. “Can you keep them there for me, darling?”
“Now I can only speculate about that,” says Granny. “But I’d like to hear your side of things before I do.”
in 1989. Picking up the battered magazine, he settles into the lumpy cushions. A few minutes later, Draco leaves the room looking shaken.
“How?” asks Ron. “You’ve always been weird about it, ever since Trelawney called you ‘uptight’ or whatever.”
Reluctantly, Potter lets him take the toy away. Draco cleanses it, and sends it back to the chest it came from. He slides down to lie on his side, so they’re facing each other. They lie like that for a few minutes, Draco just watching him, until Potter finally speaks.
Malfoy is impossibly close, close enough that he has to look down slightly when he speaks. “Potter, do you trust me?”
The girl turns red as she writes that down, word for word, but stays silent. The man in the green fedora grins maniacally.
They drag themselves out of bed with hangover potions acting as a powerful incentive. Harry’s eager to get home to his clean clothes and toothbrush, but before he leaves, he grabs Draco’s wrist.
Once again, he taps the base of the dildo with his wand, and it starts to piston back and forth. It fucks into Potter’s mouth at the same pace he’s fucking his arse, backing off just in time to stop him from gagging. Draco fucks him faster, watching as the toy speeds up to match him.
Draco laughs, shaking his head in wonder. “I didn’t even know it was a competition, but you always have to win, don’t you?”
Draco tenses behind him, but doesn’t comment. Harry swivels in his lap so he’s sat sideways, where he can look at him. He doesn’t want Samuel’s attention; he wants Draco’s. The last time he sat like this it was just before Draco was inside of him, peacefully reading a book. Then, he’d made a game of withholding his attention. This doesn’t feel like a game.
“Well, I suppose because Luna is your friend, and I should have told you. I just wanted to wait until you were seeing someone before I said anything, to make it less awkward, but...”
The man smiles, sunny expression contrasting his leather jacket and fuck-off boots. “Draco! I hoped you’d be here.”
It had been over a week since he’d seen Teddy, so he takes him and Earl to the park. Teddy has inherited Tonks’ metamorphagus gene, and though too young to talk, he often expresses himself through the colour of his hair. Today he’s sporting a cropped head of dappled grey to mimic Earl’s shiny coat. The ghost of a young woman trails behind them, saying nothing but keeping close.
Harry backs up and starts to stand, meaning to collapse onto the bed next to Malfoy, but Malfoy’s expression changes slightly. Becomes cooler, back to his usual calm. He stands up, casts a cleaning charm over them both, and rearranges his clothing. Harry sits down, feeling heavy all of a sudden.
Harry needs to outsource this dilemma to someone who knows what they’re doing. Ron and Hermione are out of the question. Not only would Ron rather die than help Harry do anything to impress a Malfoy, but neither are very invested in fashion. He’s always admired Luna’s unique style, but he doesn’t think edible earrings and hand-sewn dresses are the solution here. Ginny would just laugh. Maybe he needs to think a little wider. Zabini is always impeccably turned out, but they’re not close friends. They only ever see each other at the monthly pub nights. Still, Harry gets the feeling he might help him anyway.
There is no way this owl is only thirty galleons. The one nearest to him has a label on the cage for sixty-five, and it isn’t nearly so impressive as this one. He hands them the money anyway, and walks out with the most impulsive purchase of his adult life so far.
Long sleeves go without saying; he doesn’t even like to have the mark on display around muggles, too stifled by guilt to fabricate answers their innocent questions. He chooses a black shirt with vines embroidered in black thread, almost invisible against the fabric. It’s only standing closer that you can see them. Subtlety and misdirection are tonight’s prime directives.
Draco smiles and says “Good, keep talking like that,” before taking him up to the entrance of his throat in one staccato movement.
When Harry was twenty-five, he met Terran Jones. It was at Ginny’s birthday party, and she’d invited all her teammates on the Wasps. His mother had a degenerative illness, so he had asked to be home-schooled, rather than leave her for months at a time. Terran wouldn’t tell him that until months later, however. At the time, Harry only knew that he didn’t recognise him from Hogwarts.
Draco could, as well. There are hundreds who would kill to even see this, let alone be in his place. Not that he would ever do it. Obviously, he doesn’t need the money, but even if he did, he would never betray him like that.
Samuel laughs, rich and deep. “Now, you look like a man on a mission. I hope I’m not keeping you from anything.”
Harry had told him about his mother’s ghost, but clearly that was not enough to prepare him for seeing her with his own eyes.
On the other hand, Potter is asking him if he wants to spend time with him, in public. It’s not much of a choice in the end.
Ginny looks down into the mug clasped in her hands, and smiles softly. “Yes. We haven’t said anything yet, but I think soon. She goes on her expedition in two weeks and I don’t want her to leave not knowing I love her.”
, thinks Harry. He turns around to go and see, and collides with another body. Luckily, neither of them are holding anything liquid.
Drizzle finds its way past the collar of his jacket and down the back of his neck, but he’s thankful for the rain. Nice weather for ducks, as Arthur would say. Or nice weather if you want to be left alone. The park on a Saturday would be packed if it had been sunny. As it is, there’s just a man sitting on a bench by the lake, staring at his shoes, while his dog barks incessantly at him. He doesn’t look up, even as the small dog tries to bite his trouser leg, but instead its snout goes straight through. Harry comes closer, and the dog turns to growl at him. It’s a miniature dachshund, its coat a dappled grey. The man is similarly coloured, and now Harry is directly in front of him, clearly a ghost.
The pink tip of a tongue pokes out ever so slightly to wet his lips. “An invitation. Come to my house tonight, and we can deflower you more…thoroughly.”
Weasley comes back on the dot of half past five. He escorts him into the living room, sitting himself back down in the armchair and gesturing for Weasley to take a seat on the sofa. Nothing about this is comfortable, but he’s still going to try his hardest to make it so.
“It’s Saturday, so I have the day off. I’m out with friends tonight, but apart from that, I intend to be lazy.”
He cups Harry’s chin and lifts it, forcing their eyes to lock. Whatever he sees there must answer his unspoken question, because he wraps his arm around Harry and apparates them upstairs. Malfoy lowers him onto a bed.
The owl merely blinked at him, and flew away. The great flapping of its wings blew the hair up from his forehead, cool air brushing his scar. Harry watched it fly away until it was a black speck in the sky, and then turned back to his letter. It was the only piece of correspondence he’d ever received, and the best birthday present he’d ever had – not that he’d even opened it yet.
“Yes,” says Harry, huffing in exasperation. “And calling us hooligans makes you sound about a hundred years old, by the way.”
1: I'm sorry this took so long, but on the bright side, I've finally finished uni! I am free of the shackles of academia! Now I must don the self-imposed shackles of self employment (ooh kinky) as I prepare to become a freelance structural editor.
is more of a concept than a real person. For almost ten years he’s been someone to fight, to hate, to compete with. ‘
“Er, I’ll have a glass of the house white, please,” says Hermione, her eyebrows raising almost to her hairline.
Harry kicks up the gravel, scuffing his trainers. What stings more than anything, is that he doesn’t hate Malfoy at all. It seems too petty now, and his letters have become increasingly sincere. He’s got a wicked sense of humour that chimes with Harry’s own when it isn’t fuelled by bigotry. In less than a week, Harry’s begun to think of him as a friend. It’s a bad idea. This whole thing is a bad idea, and he never should have agreed to it. Then again, he didn’t have much choice.
He went on a few dates after that, but none were promising, until he met Raphael. Raphael was a muggle, and had no idea he’d killed a dark wizard and also died himself. It was brilliant. After a few fun dates, they went back to Raph’s house. They couldn’t go back to Grimmauld, as it was too obviously magical. Things started well, until Raphael asked Harry to fuck him. Harry had a panic attack and fled the house. Thus begins the tale of Harry Potter’s incurable virginity.
The water is warm, lapping at his chest, and Draco’s chest is firm and strong behind him. He’s so relaxed he might fall asleep then and there, with a low voice murmuring in his ear. The steam makes curls at his temples, and smells of the cheap soap he always buys. Vaguely, he wishes he had something a little fancier. If they do this again, he’ll have to make sure he has bubble bath, oils, that sort of thing. Draco’s bathroom had been full of products like that, and he wants to give him the best of everything.
, about you working here, Harry. I thought a Seer might be able to help me find the watch, put my Grandpa’s memory to rest. I made an appointment with Granny,” she says, before nodding towards Draco. “It’s like you said yesterday. Granny opens and closes the watch all the time, without even noticing. It’s so distinctive, a purring pocket watch, and I knew it was fate.”
At one point in the night, he starts ordering sugary cocktails for him and Potter. Draco’s reasons are threefold. One, they taste fucking fantastic. Two, Potter’s face when he sets them in front of him is priceless. Three, he gets to watch Potter’s mouth wrapped around a straw. He knows he’s getting less and less subtle as the night wears on, and Potter’s own subtlety was wearing thin to start with. They’re both drunk, but so is nearly everyone else.
I've split this chapter in two so you don't have to wait as long for an update. Additional warnings in the end notes.
After imagining the look on his father’s face if he’d lived to see the Malfoy money handed over to a Weasley, for a project like that, his mind was made up. When he realised that the Manor could also be put to use, Draco almost cackled.
“No, Potter. I know you think I’m a heartless bastard, but even I wouldn’t just leave you in that state.”
Draco preens. “Very nearly. It’s what I spent most of last year doing, and I’m only just finishing. It’s sort of like a puzzle, if that puzzle was also a bomb. You have to take it apart to get rid of the bits you don’t want, but if you take out the wrong piece at the wrong time it’ll explode.”
Flushing red, Harry pulls back a little, suckling at the fingers like he used to suck his thumb as a child.
towards him. He flips through until a flicker of colour and movement that catches his eye. The Tower is wreathed in painted flames, waves crashing at its base. A man falls down into the sea, appears back up at the window, and falls all over again. It plays in a loop, the tiny features of his face open in a scream. Harry shudders. It reminds him of how he used to replay Dumbledore’s death in his mind, lying awake at night, watching him fall from the tower every time he closed his eyes. If he’d dreamt of it, if he’d seen it coming, could he have stopped it? Why was he seeing the future now, and not before the War? It would have been more helpful then.
“Now we’ve got you here, I’ve been meaning to have a chat with you,” she says, stroking the dog in her lap.
Potter takes him further down, the head pushing at the entrance to his throat. He presses his palm harder on his own dick, not rubbing, as if he’s trying to stop himself from coming too soon. He suckles and swallows around him, deep as he can go, the movements back and forth becoming shallower.
“Are you sure?” he asks, voice less teasing and more serious. “I’ll have to tell them what’s happening. If we’re involving them in a scene, they need to consent.”
“What about tonight?” Potter looks sheepish, as if he’s asking for too much. “I’m at Ron and Hermione’s tomorrow, and if we wait much longer, I’ll go mad thinking about it.”
“Do you want anything more than that?” he says, voice on the edge of breaking. “Because this isn’t just physical for me.”
“You know, a bunch of people from Hogwarts go to the pub every month. Almost all of our year, actually. Not all at once, obviously, but everyone comes from time to time.”
Draco nods absentmindedly, already conjuring a magnifying glass to study the jagged lines etched into the obsidian walls of the machine. Harry smiles, and heads to the kitchen. He feels like a ham and cheese omelette. Absentmindedly, he thinks Arthur Weasley would have some kind of joke to make about that. ‘
He pulls Harry back in by the back of his neck, his hands becoming more demanding at the same time that he forces his mouth to be tender. The kiss turns languid as he guides them down from the giddy height of their confessions and back onto solid ground. Draco sits up straighter, pushing back against Harry until they’re balanced against each other like a house of cards.
The outside is addressed to ‘Potter’, and he immediately realises who it’s from. Malfoy did say he would send him his address, even though Harry had never said if he’d come. He blushes, and flicks the note open just enough to confirm its contents, before stuffing it in his pocket.
His left sleeve. Harry wonders if he’s showing him the Mark on purpose, and if so, why. Is he trying to push Harry away by reminding him about his past, or perhaps he’s making himself a little vulnerable too, to even the playing field? He knows Draco too well to think it’s merely a coincidence.
After they finish their tea, an inch of cold liquid still left in Draco’s mug, they both get to work. Harry tries to memorise the different types of Tarot cards, and their meanings.
The lull is broken by the harsh ringing of a phone. He jumps a little, still not moving from where he’s draped over strong legs and a firm chest. Draco makes soothing shushing noises as he puts his book down and summons the mobile. The noise stops, and he feels rush of relief. Then he hears a greeting, and he realises Draco hasn’t hung up. He’s answered it.
Draco reaches round to stroke him just once, before letting his hand drift down to cup his balls. Harry whimpers, grinding back into the hardness he can feel through Draco’s trousers against his bare arse.
“No reason,” says Harry, fiddling with the sleeve of his crumpled jacket. “I just thought it would be nice. Molly and Arthur really like you, you know.”
That evening, he turns up at Pansy’s London flat. He didn’t warn her he was coming, but impropriety means nothing when you grew up with someone. Not when you helped them hex off their teenage spots, held their hair back as they vomited coconut rum, and shared an embarrassing first kiss. Normally, he doesn’t talk to Pansy about matters of the heart. He suspects that she’s known about his Potter-related obsession for longer than he has, but would never disgrace either of them by mentioning it. Usually, he talks to Simi about these things. It was Simi who comforted him through his fist anticlimactic breakup, patiently watching Legally Blonde with him at least seven times.
He was about to tear the thick paper around the intricate wax seal, when Dudley’s voice rang out through the library.
Draco snorts. “You know, if you feel like polishing some wood, I’m sure I’d appreciate it more than the ladder.”
Harry bit his lip to stop himself from laughing. “Trouser snake? Do you thing parseltongue would work on one of those?”
“Actually, that’s not a bad idea.” His voice is dirty and dangerous, as he says “Beg for it. Beg me to fuck you.”

Malfoy beckons ostentatiously, welcoming him into his home. It’s too large to be a cottage, but only just, and too picturesque to be called a house. It’s nowhere near as grand as the Manor, but the wisteria draping over the doorway and the herbs he brushed past on his way up the path give the impression of pastels and sweetness. Everything Malfoy is not. Because he is a dick.
He wrestles with himself for a moment. Is this okay? This isn’t something they’ve really discussed how to handle. Then again, it would definitely be more distressing for Potter to stop suddenly, jolting him out of it, than to see it through. Mind made up, he kisses Potter’s cheek in a gesture that feels more illicit than Draco’s cock in his arse. Perhaps because it feels stolen.
Dying must have changed him, like it changed everything else. The horcrux is gone, but he still doesn’t feel entirely himself.
“Care to elaborate, sir?” squeaks a voice from his left. The man from the prophet is back, this time flanked by a tall and bearded man, and a girl about his age who’s scribbling in a notebook.
He apparates into the alley behind the pub twenty minutes late. On time is early, when it comes to social functions. Or so his mother always tells him. The Huntsman’s Hound is busy, a muggle pub with low beamed ceilings and an old-fashioned atmosphere. There are paintings of dogs on every wall, some old and expensive, some new and amateur, and all exceedingly ugly. The one by the entrance looks more like a cow, but if he has to hazard a guess, he’d say it was a beagle.
Draco slides his hand up Potter’s neck, enjoying the line it makes, the vulnerable softness under his chin. He’s at Draco’s mercy, and this time it’s by choice. Then he undoes Draco’s trousers, and he remembers that he’s at Potter’s mercy, too.
“I was just telling young Draco why I’m up here, and not downstairs with the other paintings,” she says.
When Angus gets up, Simi quickly replaces him. “Harry, I’ve been meaning to ask. Have you got any embarrassing stories about Draco from school?”
“Sometimes people are playing a role, or they get so worked up that they say ‘stop’ but they don’t actually want to, or they want to stop what they’re currently doing but not end the scene altogether. If you use your safeword I know something’s wrong, and I end the scene right away.”
Draco clucks his tongue and says “You’re clearly not,” but instead of interrogating him further he just walks Harry back into the adjoining bedroom and sits him down on the bed.
Harry’s been told many times that he fidgets. He doesn’t notice it himself, but he used to get in trouble for it even before Hogwarts. Teachers would snatch away whatever he was playing with in his hands, and say if he was fidgeting then he wasn’t paying attention. So, then he would bite his nails. Tug at his hair. Tap his foot. Nothing can stop him moving, except this. It paralyses his mind, and then his body follows after.
“Well,” shrugs Ginny, “It wasn’t something I really thought about that much until recently. I was so obsessed with you in school. Then I started spending more time with Luna, before she was taken away.” She breaths deeply, and blinks away tears. “When she was gone, I thought about her every day. I was so scared they’d hurt her, or kill her. I didn’t realise until she was gone how much I needed her. After the battle, when I saw her for the first time, I just held her. I hung onto her and I realised I never wanted to let go.”
Harry reminds himself to pull back, and breaths heavily. “Is this what you want?” He is wound so tightly he isn’t sure if his mouth wants to produce kisses or curses. “Are you sure you want to do this?”
Draco crawls over him, straddling his hips. Harry wishes he would lay over him, let him feel the solid realness of him. Instead, he gathers Harry’s hands up once again and holds them over his head. Rather than a solid piece of wood, the headboard is made of carved spindles, and clearly Draco spotted an opportunity. With a whispered
“I still think you need to change the name,” she says. “It’s not clear whether you’re trying to educate wizards about muggles or muggles about wizards.”
Harry and Draco once again return to Grimmauld Place together. Instead of heading to the kitchen like they normally would, he leads Draco into the loving room. Going over to the stack of records, he pulls out one with a cover spelled blank. Originally it had been a Kate Bush track, but her wailing had unsettled him. He hands it to Draco.
Ron leans back and sits up straight so fast his chair almost tips back. “No thanks, mate. Actually, I think I might just pretend you’re still a virgin, for the sake of my sanity.”
Draco suddenly becomes incredibly heavy where he’s lying on top of him, and Harry shifts them until they’re facing each other. Draco kisses Harry, mouth closed but firm, then twice more in quick succession as if he can’t get his fill. He reaches for his discarded wand, and casts a cleaning charm over them both. Harry sighs in relief. Coming in your trousers is never comfortable.
He lines their cocks up with each other, and strokes them both at once. Harry is almost completely soft now.
Granny laughed at him. “Just swallow them, but in the future blow on your cup every now and then and the leaves will float away from your mouth. If that doesn’t work use your teeth to filter it- it’s not elegant but it works.”
He asked Ginny about him, and subtle as ever, she yelled across the room to ask Terran if he liked blokes. Terran had only laughed, walked over to where they were standing, and told Ginny that if she didn’t know he was gay before then she was certainly about to. Then he kissed him. Square on the lips. Not long, but firm, with his hand on Harry’s jaw. A peck on the lips, but not the kind you’d give your aunt. Unless you were fucked up, of course. Harry was stunned, his face was red, and his stream-of-consciousness was babbling.
Draco lowers his head into the pensieve, and then he’s falling, falling, falling. He’s only done this once before, when he’d had to submit memories for his trial. It wasn’t something he’d ever wanted to repeat, but the fact that Harry wants him to is enough to sway him. Harry Potter wants
Potter’s eyes are completely shut now, cheek resting on the pillow. If it weren’t for the way he’s endlessly gripping and releasing the bunched-up sheets in his fists, Draco would think he’s asleep. The way his cock nudges softly inside, barely moving back and forth, reminds him of the way Potter suckled on his cock, his fingers. He thinks Potter found that comforting, and that’s the reason why he’s doing this right now. Potter needs soothing, reassuring.
“You’re so desperate for me, aren’t you? What a needy little slut.” Draco strokes a finger down his spine, his crease, over his hole. “Don’t worry, darling. I know what you need.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” he says, rolling his eyes. “It’s just that your elf is likely to know more about your wards than you.”
Despite Harry’s request to fuck him, it doesn’t take long to get them off like that. They breath into each other’s mouths, a string of spit connecting them for a moment, before breaking. There’s come on Harry’s stomach and pyjamas, as well as on his own shirt, sticking them together. Harry lets his head fall back onto the tiles, panting. He strokes Draco’s hair, guiding his head down to rest on his chest.
At first glance, Isla Black looks nothing like Draco. Her hair is dark, and falls in soft waves where it isn’t pinned in elaborate braids around her face. She has a button nose, where his is pointed, and a rounded face. Her mouth however, he realises as he comes closer, curves into the exact same shape as Draco’s. Harry feels slightly nauseous that he knows his smile well enough to compare it, it seems like he knows something he shouldn't. Something he hasn't earned yet.
The shy young man says ‘yes’ at the same time that Angus, just as emphatically, says ‘no’. Draco doesn’t say anything yet, and Harry just stares at them in bewilderment.
And really, he was being very complimentary. Does he want to get back together with Draco? Does Draco want to get back together with
Malfoy stands fluidly, still staring Harry down. He moves round the table and pulls Harry to his feet in one long stride, pulling Harry’s mouth to his without hesitation. He brackets Harry’s hips with his hands and pins them against the table, almost bending him backwards with the force of the kiss. Not one to back down from a challenge, especially one issued by Malfoy, he kisses back with equal intention. Malfoy’s mouth is less desperate and more demanding than before, his tongue sure of itself as it strokes against Harry’s.
He blinks his eyes open. Draco is leaning over him, wearing a wry smile that he quickly covers with annoyance. He’s fully dressed, in the same combination of fancy shirts and trousers, minus the waistcoat. His socks look hand-knitted, and for a moment Harry wonders who is knitting Draco socks. For some reason he can’t imagine Narcissa clacking a pair of knitting needles together. The image of Molly and Narcissa trading knitting patterns comes to mind, strange as a dream.
Now it’s Harry’s turn to freeze. Luna looks between the two of them, and wanders out the door with an airy sigh of “The dirigible plums need picking. They prefer it by moonlight, it tickles them during the day.”
They shuffle upright, Draco’s arm around his shoulders, supporting his head. This time Potter holds the mug himself, his hands steadier than before. He tries to drink too fast, and some water escapes and runs down his chin.
“Felix it is.” Draco clears his throat. “I know you’re not all that familiar with all the options, but is there anything you can think of that you particularly want to try? I can’t promise I’ll agree to it, but I won’t judge you either.”
The day his three years living as a muggle were over, Draco Malfoy cast a patronus for the first time. It was a stag. He’d known it would be, of course, but it still wasn’t pleasant to have it confirmed. The memory he’d used was of when Simi had thrown him a surprise birthday party, about a year after they’d moved in together. He hadn’t thought about Potter at all. Still, he hadn’t forgotten him. Part of the reason that he chose the patronus as his first spell was because he’d always been so pissed off that there was yet another thing Potter could do that he couldn’t. So, he’d sat at the end of his single bed in his tiny flat, and watched the stag prance around the room. He had to sit on the bed, because there wasn’t room for anything as superfluous as a chair. Their flat was a bit of a shithole.
Draco’s mouth moves down towards his neck, thumb sliding underneath the collar of his t-shirt. Harry takes advantage of their new position to dance kisses over Draco’s face. Along his jaw, up the line of his cheekbone, over the soft skin of his temple. The kisses are almost too tender, too innocent for how heated things have become, but Harry doesn’t care. Draco doesn’t seem to mind either, because his hand traces a similar path over Harry’s face. He reaches the scar, and touches it so lightly it tickles.
Harry smiles, reaching out to touch Draco’s hair like he’s wanted to ever since that day in the orchard. Ever since the memory he used for his Patronus. The one that belongs to Draco. He closes his eyes and presses his face into Draco’s neck. Another yawn pushes its way to the surface, and Harry tries to fight it down.
There’s another buzzing response. Harry has to stop himself from wriggling on Draco’s dick. Someone, somewhere, knows exactly what a slut he’s being for Draco right now.
“Tea?” ask Harry, blindsided. Sitting between them are two mugs of half full, still warm tea already. Still, there’s no accounting for an old woman’s idiosyncrasies or her obsession with the magical and medicinal properties of bergamot. The most confusing part is that the only time she had ever let him so much as touch the kettle was when she was ill in bed.
UPDATE: unfortunately there’s going to be a short break in posting. Ironically it’s partyly because I can’t stop dissociating, but also because I have uni deadlines. Don’t fear, it is not abandoned, and I’ll be back before you know it!
The clinical answer is that it’s the right thing to do. No one, dom or sub, should participate in a scene unless they’re prepared to perform the necessary aftercare. However, that’s not the whole truth, and it’s not what Harry’s really asking.
For their first date they went flying. Obviously, Terran was a professional, but he was also a beater. They played a seekers match to even the playing field, and Harry won two out of three matches. He never admitted it to Terran, but he let him win the third, because he was starting to look embarrassed. The sun lit up his hair, and his grin lit up his face when he caught the snitch, and so it was worth it to lie just a little bit. When they were tired and ready to go home, Terran kissed him again. Properly, this time. Harry steeled himself, and resolved to explain about his problem before it went any further, and hoped he would understand. Before he could, Terran pulled back, and asked if they could take things slow. He’d had a string of high-profile flings followed by a one-sided attachment, and he wanted to settle down and take his time. He liked Harry, and he didn’t want to ruin it. Harry had rarely been that relieved since the end of the war.
“I can only explain what happened before you arrived, after that we’ll need to piece it together between us.” Granny sighs. “After I left my family, taking only the pocket watch I’d given my brother, my family disowned me. They told everyone I’d died with him. They even put up a headstone, over an empty grave.”
Harry blushes. “It was pretty amazing. I had a few weird moments, but not during, and he was actually really good about it.”
His cheeks burn. “Yeah, but I don’t know if I actually want to kiss him. When I first felt it, the room was hot, it made me feel weird. And today…” He trails off. “Maybe I have food poisoning. Maybe I have food poisoning and it’s making my stomach do weird things, and I don’t want to kiss him at all!”
Draco whimpers. He’s only human, after all. Moving to cover Potter with his body, cock nestled between his cheeks, Draco murmurs in his ear.
“Harry,” he says, struggling to look them in the eye. This person knows exactly what he and Draco get up to. They even
“What is it you’re worried about? If you like men and women, that’s great. If you just like men, that’s good too. Your family won’t care, they just want you to be happy.”
Draco looks into his eyes for a long moment, before shaking his head in wonder and disbelief. “You’re insane, Potter. Even I don’t want to be me.”
“It’s hard. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but I ended up here and I never looked back. There’s only one thing I would change.”
It feels like a small victory. Harry strokes Bunny’s ear tufts, and unfastens the letter from her leg.
“Sorry about this,” says Harry, gesturing to the bath. “I’ve spent all day wrestling with your bloody house and I’m knackered.”
Tuesday begins with blissful silence. Harry wanders downstairs in his pajamas- he’s taken to sleeping fully clothed since the random appearance of women in his bedroom became commonplace- and begins making breakfast. He’s stirring scrambled eggs when Bunny knocks her beak against the window, and as soon as he lets her in, she steals a rasher of bacon from the kitchen counter.
“You dropped it before the reading began, which usually means that there’s something the deck wants you to know, that doesn’t relate to your question.”
Draco grabs a pillow and pulls Potter up by the hips, placing the pillow under them. As he lifts him up, he sees Potter’s mostly-limp cock just hanging there. He wants to touch it, wants to squeeze the soft flesh and say
Decided to update two chapters in one day thanks to the speedy work of my beta Dia3012 (@dreamerthinker on tumblr)
Draco tightens his jaw, and squeezes Harry’s arm. “And I’ve noticed you and your friends aren’t all that touchy-feely. A quick hug and a slap on the back here or there, a kiss on the cheek, but that’s about it. Am I right?”
“I’ll be so good, I promise.” His voice is so low and broken it’s almost a croak. “You can have me whenever you want, wherever. I’ll do anything if you just keep-”
After Ron leaves, he looks at the records he hasn’t had a chance to play yet. The older man in the muggle shop had an eclectic taste, and Harry had put himself in his hands, not having listened to much besides the WWN in years. Bruce Springsteen, The Who, Leonard Cohen. He recognises some of the names, but overall was at a loss. He puts one on at random and relaxes back into the sofa. Closing his eyes, he wonders what his parents played on this same machine. He wonders what the soundtrack of their lives was, if they had a song that was theirs, if they danced to it in the kitchen. Wishes there was someone left to ask.
“It’s at ten o’clock, but I’ll need to be a few minutes early as I’m providing the drinks. You don’t need to bring anything; I’ll just come over at ten to and we can side along there.”
Weasley shrugs. “I also wanted to check you weren’t blackmailing him or slipping love potions into his tea.”
Now that he’s really looking at him, he can see the beginnings of fine wrinkles around his eyes, the tight set of his mouth.
There’s no reply that he can hear. He begins to run up the stairs, but as soon as his foot touches the first step, they flatten out and start to move beneath him. Remembering the spiral stairs up to Dumbledore’s office, he stands still and lets them take him.
“Wait a minute! Come back here and tell us what Gryffindor nonsense this is,” she orders. “Or Blaise will never shut up about it otherwise.”
“I’m sorry,” says Harry, unsure how to comfort someone who’s been dead a hundred years or more. “I can move you downstairs if you like, so you won’t be on your own.”
Malfoy fucks him with precision. Each movement is calculated to be as destructive to Harry’s sanity as physically possible. Every now and then, he pushes in with a force that leaves his feet scrabbling at the tiled floor for purchase. However, it’s Malfoy’s
Draco takes the vial from Weasley and holds it up to him, as if making a toast. “To trust,” he says, smiling bitterly.
“It should be something you’ll remember, but not something you would say normally. My safeword is Mandrake.”
Harry shrugs, and nods at the same time. “That would be easier, but it doesn’t help me now. Obviously, I care what Terran thinks.”
. Draco smirks, and lowers them down until he’s stretched out over him, pressing him into the mattress.
This time he’ll only have to face one man, but he doesn’t feel much better about it. Considering the line of questioning, Draco’s biggest secret is bound to spill out. He’ll know that Draco’s in love with Harry. He can only hope that Weasley will keep to the terms of their agreement, and not tell his friend what he knows.
The man leaves, and Granny wheels out behind him. “Just wait a moment, dear,” she says to the woman, “I’ve just got to speak to Harry for a bit.”
Draco rests his forehead on the back of Harry’s neck and moves his hips in earnest. “Merlin, what you do to me. Did you know what you were doing, when you said I could have you whenever, wherever I wanted? Fuck, I want to
“You know, if there’s one thing I regret not doing at Hogwarts, it’s that I never pushed you up against a library shelf and had my wicked way with you.”
“The more you work with them, the easier they are to recognise. For most people they’re just an energy, a feeling you get when you enter a house. For houses as old as this one, as old as the Manor, they develop a sort of sentience. They react to your presence.” Draco leans back in his chair. “The wards aren’t as dark as when I was here last, but they could do with some work.”
Potter whines and buries his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulling tight enough that he can feel the sting of it.
. He won’t, though. They haven’t discussed what they’re doing right now; this isn’t a scene. He might want to destroy Potter in a perverted mirror of the way he’s destroyed Draco, body and soul, but he doesn’t have permission for that. Yet.
He seems to decide it’s not worth wasting time that could be spent kissing Harry by finishing his sentence.
“You’re not getting away with it this time, Potter. The whole point of this is so you can have sex without panicking, so you need to tell me what makes you panic.”
Draco extends one long finger to trace over the crest of feathers on the bird’s head, his face illuminated with blue and silver. He looks like some forgotten god, ruling among the stars. Harry loves him so much he temporarily forgets how to feel anything, think of anything, else.
Harry can feel his socks wiggling themselves off his feet, and he picks his legs up so his jeans can slide down and off his legs. Malfoy flicks his wand to end the spell, and curls his fingertips over the waistband of Harry’s pants.
“So pretty,” comments Draco. “I should dress you up one day. White lace, I think, would be best. Or maybe red, with your colouring. What do you think?”
Eventually, Arthur looks at his watch. “I’m afraid I’m expected back, boys. Can I leave you to look at the last two rooms?”
“That makes no sense.” All the blood drains from Ron’s face. “Wait a minute! I know what’s happened. He’s given you a love potion.”
Granny halts her shuffling. “Everyone who comes to me is uncertain in one way or another. I can’t offer them certainty. I will never claim to be right a hundred percent of the time- but I can guide them onto the right path.”
She nods and presses it into his hands. He goes into the shop, and expecting the mob to tail him, gets his wand out to lock the door behind him. To his surprise, they make no move to follow him.
Harry untenses his shoulders, but his stomach still feels uneasy. “We probably don’t need to worry. Most of the dream was nonsense anyway.”
They continue in this vein for a while, the argument devolving into some nonsensical debate about carpets, of all things. Harry stops paying attention, and is quietly finishing his burger, when he sees an owl tapping at the window.
Before he can even contemplate the answer to that question, Zabini drops down into the seat next to him. He’d left briefly to take Draco home, and Harry takes a moment to wonder if he’s alright. Draco had seemed unusually ruffled when he’d left.
Malfoy’s mouth forms a curve, too thoughtful to be called a smile. “I’m not a fan of sadomasochism, so if you want to fight, I’d prefer to finish fucking first.”
Last time he’d had plenty of milk and sugar, and he tries his best to match the shade as exactly as he can to what he remembers. Making someone’s tea right is important, and though he’d left it up to Draco before, he needs an excuse not to turn around for just a few moments longer. When Harry finally brings the mugs to the table, Draco moves to sit across from him, and his little smile grows and takes root in his lips, his nose, his eyes. A small, almost invisible, dimple appears in his cheek. Harry wants to die, just a little bit. Just once more.
