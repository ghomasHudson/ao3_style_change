Harry frowned. Here being pissy and pregnant and horny. He slumped down against his propped up pillow, even pissier and hornier than before. He thankfully stayed exactly the same amount of pregnant.
“H’rry?” Draco mumbled, pushing up onto his elbows and looking only about 23% awake. His hair was sleep-messy and ruined, sticking up one one side like a particularly blond feather duster
One day, Draco thinks as he sits next to Harry with a short smile, he’ll get around to asking him what’s become of his old wand. It’s funny that Draco has ended up seeing Harry most nights and yet he’s never brought this up. Maybe he never will; it’s miraculous enough that they spend any time around each other, and they don’t talk much. Draco isn’t sure what Harry’s doing out here, why he keeps creeping out of the castle too. It’s not spitting
"What the fuck are you doing here?" Draco replies harshly. The tremble in his voice surprises even him.
"Hello. Um. Beg pardon?" replies Draco, awkwardly reaching out to steady Harry and then putting his hands in his pockets instead. "Please don’t hex me?" he adds, with a glance at Harry’s wand.
He shakes all thoughts aside of the mornings he won’t have as the door swings open, and Gerhalt ushers him inside with a close-lipped smile and a genial pat on the shoulder. Draco lets the warmth of the bar and the syrupy combination of thrumming bass and rowdy chatter swallow him whole.
―to find answers for him, a resolution as best they can. He deserves that, and Draco knows that he can help.
"I thought so." He licks his lips, eyes flitting over Harry's face. Slowly, he raises his hands, long fingers reaching towards Harry. Harry holds his breath, then lets it out in an audible rush as Draco pulls his glasses off his face, gentle as anything. He folds them, the click of metal on metal so faint in the quiet, lamplit room. Harry watches his hands, the barely visible shake in them. Nervous, Harry thinks, his stomach somersaulting. He feels it inside himself too. Nervousness, excitement, anticipation. It buzzes through him in the echo chamber of this room, of the chemistry between them, with the bond exacerbating that what which was already there into cosmic proportions.
"Oh, fu―" Harry breaks off into a moan, head tipping back against the bed. His hips circle between wanting to press up into Draco mouth and to bear down against his long fingers as Draco moves them inside him. He feels Draco's answering groan against his cock.
Draco smiles, the curve of his lips sweet and enticing, as he moves his left hand closer to Harry's face.
But he could still do his job fine without one. It just meant that he kept asking to smell Laura’s during staff debriefings. Harry did also find he couldn't go out on the field without feeling the need to apologise to the baby every step of the way. And he was definitely still mortified about the time he’d spilled some of a Confidius Reduction on his stomach and had to Floo home in a panic to ask Draco if he could accidentally give a baby some kind of damage via osmosal potion absorption.
He fails to suppress his sound when Potter makes short work of undoing his jeans and pulling them open. Having been given permission Potter shows no hesitation. He kisses the lowest part of Draco's belly once, open-mouthed and sweet, then looks up at Draco as he mouths over Draco's cloth-covered cock. He's not hard, but he starts filling out quickly at the soft, warm press of Potter's mouth, at the dampness his tongue leaves as Potter presses it against the black material of Draco's boxer briefs. Draco feels almost dizzy with anticipation as he looks down at him.
Potter is gone for over an hour. Seventy-three minutes, to be precise. Draco can’t help but count every one of them. He stares at the decrepit clock on the wall opposite, at the watch on his wrist. He fiddles with the dark leather strap of said watch, agitated and uneasy, as he nurses a cherry brandy and soda. It’s sickly sweet on his tongue and coats the back of his throat. It matches the discomfort he feels in the club. At Potter being hidden away behind moth-eaten velvet and in the company of God knows who.
thing of use. Sometimes that's all there is, at the end of a case. There are no cures, no magical resolutions or closure, but there is always an ending. The chase, the discovery, can often be the best part. He wants to work on this with Potter―
He thinks Potter is leading them back to their previous secluded corner, but Potter takes them past it. Understanding blossoms in Draco's mind as they arrive at the men's bathrooms. Draco gapes for a moment at the implication of it. Not that he's surprised for himself—he's gotten off in a grubby loo before and felt no shame―but
"No." Harry laughs again, miserably. He pushes his fingers through his hair, then straightens up. He needs to get a grip, and just deal with the consequences of his actions. "It’s fine." He takes a deep breath, Draco watching him with wide eyes and a worried furrow between his brows. "Did you come straight here?" he asks. Draco looks clean-shaven, his clothes neat and pressed. He smells nice, Harry notes wretchedly. He doesn't seem like someone who’s just long distance Floo’d.
She stretches one paw out, flexes it then releases, and blinks at him syrupy and slow. Harry smiles.
“Illicit Potions smuggling,” replies Draco. “As you should know, Potter. Stardust, Euphoria, Mother’s Milk. The usual candidates. Apparently this is a tipped off meeting point for the exchange but I’m not feeling overly confident. I think our informant’s been telling porkies to try and save his own skin, really, but.” Draco shrugs. “Still needs to be checked out. Merlin, you’re fidgety, Potter, just sit still will you?”
"Can I say something?" Ginny takes her legs off the chair and places them on the floor so she can rest her arms on the table and give Harry her full attention.
, he explained while gesturing at his left forearm and the pale serpentine scar etched along it. Harry’s own body is mottled with scars from the past, too, on his chest and hand and forehead. They make a nice pair, Harry supposes, with their blemished and tarnished bodies―all these marks that cover them. Harry wants to put his mouth over every single one on Draco’s skin.
"What?" Potter scoffs, leaning forward now too. His fringe falls into his eyes and he shakes it away in annoyance. "How am I supposed to do that?"
Harry threads one hands into Draco hair again, lets the longer stands at the top fall over his fingers. "Yeah?"
A top and a pair of grey pyjama bottoms hit him on the face just as he’s shut his eyes. “Oi,” he groans, pulling them away from his head and glaring up at Draco.
Potter catches Draco staring, and Draco holds his gaze for a long moment. He turns so they're no longer side by side against the dark wall, but he makes sure they're still no less close. The movement brings him into Potter's space. It's no accident.
proved, as far as he’s concerned, beyond any shadow of a doubt. He’s really very good at his job, and Aneta’s husband is really very stupid.
Harry hums, kissing over Draco's skin again. He can't describe what he feels, beyond a heightened awareness of every place his lips touch, his mouth almost tingling. He feels starved for it, and he cups his own hand over the back of Draco's, shifting his hips restlessly as he brings Draco's wrist closer. Draco lets his wrist go lax, easier for Harry to manoeuvre. He rests his knee on the bed between Harry's parted legs, inches from his groin. Harry feels so aware of everywhere Draco is, feels like he could almost whine with it.
Draco blinks, quickly gathering his wits from where Potter appears to have scattered them. "We've an appointment," he says, his voice scratchy. He clears his throat, remembering his lines. "With management."
already thinking it. It's hard to imagine a person disappearing without a trace without assuming the bleak worst.
As far as explanations go, this is far from what Draco is hoping for. "That’s it?" he asks, nonplussed. "You’re looking for some
"Yeah, I guess so." Harry finds himself oddly excited by the prospect―that there’s still more of Draco to know.
“I asked first, Malfoy” he says, voice low, rather than mention any of this to Draco. It’s too new, too uncertain. How does he say,
Potter groans, deep and throaty, when Draco slightly tightens his fingers in Potter’s hair, and Draco loses it. He lets out a low and almost silent moan as he spills into Potter’s mouth, feels Potter swallow frantically around him. Potter breathes out through his nose in desperate puffs but doesn’t move away. He stays until Draco has finished, sucking him down and breathing heavily, until Draco has to pull him away from his twitching cock. Draco's entire body is on edge from the aftershocks, small jolts of pleasure still coursing through him. Potter kisses the base of Draco’s softening cock, then at his belly. He’s breathing hard, letting out soft moans on every other exhale and Draco slowly sees, through the fading fog of orgasm, that Potter’s hand is moving between his legs. He pulls himself off in quick, fast motions, with the kind of efficiency that comes with being right on the edge. He can’t pull his eyes away from Potter’s hand, the way it fits between his spread legs. He can see the glistening, flushed tip of Potter’s cock in quick glimpses when Potter’s hand moves just so, and Draco cards his fingers through Potter’s hair, stroking him gently.
"Oh," Draco manages to eloquently mutter in response. He's still mulling this revelation over, letting it seep slowly through his brain and trickle down his spine, when the barman returns.
to people. The best bet that anyone has come up with is that the space where the, the"—Potter gestures vaguely at his own chest—"where the Horcrux was, that it carved away a piece of my
Potter gives nothing away when Draco tells him he’s found his mystery person. For all that he confessed he trusts Draco, Potter remains guarded and elusive when it comes to divulging what his purpose is, what he's seeking from Darya and her ilk.
“You need to dilute it, then let your arm rest in it. Might be awkward, sticking your whole forearm in it,” Harry breaths a little half laugh, “but the solution really does help it feel better.” Harry’s throat works as he swallows, before he slowly moves his hand forwards then curls his fingers around Draco’s left wrist ― right above where Draco’s fingers have started absently scratching at the Mark, through the material of his top. “It might help with this, too.”
Draco yanks Harry’s jeans down to his thighs, palms him through his underwear and then pulls them down too. The brush of cool air is starting against his cock. Harry manages to do the same, getting Draco’s trousers and pants down under his bum. He pulls Draco up against him, sighing at the feeling of bare skin on skin.
“Um.” Harry clears his throat, coughs into his fist. The sound is startlingly loud in the quiet night, even though Harry’s voice is a low murmur. “I noticed, like. I thought.” He twists something he’s holding in his hands, a glass bottle. The light from Harry’s wand catches on its carefully crafted angles, refracting slightly. “I noticed you sometimes, on your arm.” Harry gestures at Draco’s forearm, then makes a scrubbing motion with his hand.
"You’re welcome, Harry," Draco replies thickly. He hopes the choked-up quality of his voice can be disguised as tiredness, although he doubts this given he’s already confessed to Potter that he doesn’t even need to rest anymore. Draco lays on his back, keeping his breathing steady. He can tell that Potter is looking at him, and even though the room is dark Draco feels exposed. He turns and, feeling for Potter’s shoulder with one hand, pulls him into a kiss. Potter makes a faint sound of surprise before he responds, a soft press of lips against Draco’s, a hand on the back of his neck.
He does do stupid things though, this he can admit about himself. Quietly, in the most personal parts of his mind. Never out loud, and never to Pansy, thank you. But to himself he is quite true.
to Potter before. Potter saved him, true, but not because he liked him. Potter saved the fucking world. He’s just a good person. Draco has no right to be bothered by being amongst the swarms of people who don’t matter to Harry Potter. And yet, it stings, just like that rejected boyhood handshake did. He focuses on his bitter drink, and not on the bitterness churning in his stomach.
Draco shakes his head as he straightens up. "Not in the slightest. I was early. I’m annoyingly punctual these days," he jokes, wryly self-deprecating. It’s better than saying that he had nothing else to do and couldn’t get Potter out of his mind.
Harry morosely sips on his tepid tea, the still as-yet-unnamed cat sitting in the bread basket on the bench and blinking serenely in the mid-morning light. Harry needs to take her into the village soon, scope out the vets and see if anyone is missing a cat with a taste for eating plants and moving into other people’s houses. He’s left a window open each day and night so she can leave if she has a home to go to, but so far she hasn’t gone much further than the overgrown back garden. She’s not wearing a collar, and doesn’t seem mistreated but she’s thin, and on closer inspection has a badly torn ear that appears to have healed long ago. She seems marvellously at home in this house as well, which makes Harry wonder, rather dismally, if someone who lived here before him just left her. He knows people do that sort of thing. It makes him feel a bit sick and miserable, an animal being left behind like that.
“Without medical intervention, that is,” The Healer clarifies. “We are luckily in a position to have this resolved by, at the very latest, Sunday evening. Given that it’s Friday now, or technically the very early hours of Saturday morning, I should think we will have the necessary potions on hand by then. These cases don’t happen often, but we do like to get them resolved quickly.”
Harry messily kissed Draco’s neck, up to his ear. He gently pulled the lobe between his teeth. “I want you to fill me up,” he mumbled, aiming for sexy and breathless. That’s definitely how he felt, at least, as well as just sweaty and insanely turned on. Harry bit down again, softly, as he heard Draco groan, low and guttural.
He grins as he sits down on the bed heavily, toeing his shoes off and pulling his wand out of his pocket so it ceases jabbing him in the thigh. He lies down backwards, legs dangling off the bed as he breathes out a long sigh that feels like it’s been building in him for hours.
Potter doesn't say anything back. The rain plasters his hair to his forehead, a dark tangle above his glasses, before he pulls out the folder. He holds it out towards Draco.
“Fuck,” Draco panted, pushing back up onto his hands. He pulled out, cock dragging over the oversensitive rim of Harry’s arse, before he thrust down hard, and then again, his rhythm turning erratic.
Potter nods, holding Draco's gaze. Draco feels struck by those eyes again, startled once more by how vibrant, how intense they can be.
"Grand. Back in a sec, then." With a last squeeze of his arm, Ginny heads to the bar, her sandals softly slapping on the slate tiles.
He has a sudden massive urge to go outside and check the house number. He looks around the kitchen instead. It feels like he’s in the right house. That’s his breadbin. Those are his grotty dishes still in the sink because he was too mopey to do them last night, and that’s his cat sitting on the bench and watching them with vague interest and possible distrust. And that’s Draco stood in front of him.
Dying is painless. Being undead is easy. Surviving a decades-long war in which he was on the wrong side was a piece of fucking cake.
"Oh." Harry glances down at the pages next to the typewriter. He looks back at Agatha, then gets up. "No, it’s crap."
Harry kicks his legs out petulantly, banging his ankle on the window before slouching off to his typewriter.
They haven't got long before they'll be kicked out when some poor bastard is desperate for a wee, or if security comes in looking for too many feet under cubicle doors. As if thinking the same thing, Potter asks, "What do you want?" He kisses down Draco's neck while he waits for a reply.
Change sucks. Being an adult is hard. Harry is so glad he has nice people around him to swear at him and like him even when he can’t do things for them, and to let him weep on their casual business attire.
Harry laughs, then groans. He slumps belligerently into the kitchen, his typewriter sitting stationary on the table and somehow managing to radiate menace, and sets about making what will surely be the first of many many cups of tea.
Another moment passes before Draco breathes in deeply through his nose. “Sorry,” he mumbles, pulling his fingers free from Harry slowly, then wiping his hand against his pyjama bottoms. Harry makes a face; it doesn’t hurt, but the sensation is strange, a little uncomfortable now he’s come. He clenches down on nothing, and almost misses Draco’s fingers.
Well. Possibly the fact that Draco hasn’t replied, even though time zones would absolutely have allowed him to have seen it by now, is a bit worse. Harry sinks in his chair. Okay that’s maybe a lot worse.
“I thought I’d just use your toothbrush!” Harry calls out to Draco’s retreating back. Harry can’t make out Draco’s reply, but he’s certain it’s heavily expletive laden.
Harry sulkily writes three pages―about a wizard named Harvey who had an excellent cat called Martha who fancied herself a garden landscaper, and who also had a posh friend named Derek who was part Veela and a giant buzzkill. And an awful cook. He’s okay at crosswords though; Harry doesn't want his character to be
“Oh, not in the slightest. It’s rather rare, in the scheme of things. And it was a comet, I think you’ll find.”
, for Potter. Is it loneliness, boredom, curiosity? That he sees in Draco a sense of shared history, or just a familiar face in a foreign country? Draco doesn’t know what exactly brought Potter back to this same table to wait for Draco, but he’s sure it’s more than just wanting to make sure Draco keeps his mouth shut about seeing him. There’s no way Potter has managed to keep off the radar this long based just on asking people and goodwill alone. There's something else there. Draco sees it on Potter’s face as he shifts in his chair, mulling Draco’s words over. He looks slightly caught out, but not upset. Perhaps even he didn’t realise there was more to this until Draco put words to it.
Harry feels that shiver again, eyes flicking from Draco’s eyes to his lips, and he can’t tell if the answer is
"Will this get you off?" Harry rumbles, grabbing Draco by the arse and pulling him closer. He slips one hand down lower, cupping the join of Draco’s thigh and arse.
“Yep,” Harry adds, his smile falling off his face in his confusion. He wonders if he’s posh enough to try a piece of grapefruit for his breakfast, or if perhaps go for cereal instead. Honestly, these spreads Draco puts on are too much decision for him. At home he’d be fine with just toast. “Very pepperminty.” Harry licks his lips and avoids eye contact, suddenly reminded of how viscerally he’d responded to the scent of the lotion in the shower.
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” he says, walking backwards to the door. Harry watches him go, still lying on his back on the bed and tilting his head at an awkward angle.
"Yes." Draco dares to step closer still. "Drink with me, Harry?" They're close enough now to share a breath.
"Is it the bond?" Harry asks, even though he doesn't think the bond works like that. "Is it just...only right now?" The words fall away, falling petal soft between them.
Potter snorts, then finally responds. "Excited isn’t the word for it, Malfoy." They both nod at the bouncer as he waves them in with deliberate disinterest.
He dozes off right before dawn, the curtains drawn tight and a thin sheet spread over his legs. The folder from Potter lies on the small cedarwood desk in the corner, pages reverently turned as Draco devoured its contents. It didn’t reveal too much, but every word was something Potter was allowing him to see,
Potter smiles ever so slightly. He moves to mirror Draco's posture, turning until they're both facing each other. The movement is languid. Around them, the club churns. People talk, drink, dance. Draco is barely aware of them, pulled into the vortex of Potter's intense gaze.
Harry had recently been promoted to Head Auror, and Draco was in his second year as captain of Puddlemere United. Both jobs were high profile, lucrative, and not exactly best performed while up the duff. Not to mention who would take paternity leave ― Harry’s job had better systems set up for that, but both of their careers would likely take a hit if they took a prolonged leave of absence to raise a child. They’d each agreed they were willing to take it, but Draco didn't want Harry to damage his stellar rise through the Auror ranks, and Harry didn't want Draco to ruin his chance of taking Puddlemere to the Quidditch World Cup this year; the team were so,
"Okay, we’ll bench that topic." Ginny crosses her ankles and wiggles her toes, painted nails poking out the top of her sandals. Her expression grows somehow even smugger. "So are you dating Draco Malfoy yet?"
“That's what I thought his morning, when I woke up to a raging erection that wasn’t entirely my own doing.”
The difference between then and now feels vast. It feels earned, as well; Draco is not the same person he was then. Potter, asleep in Draco's bed in a messy sprawl, is not the same boy either. Draco revels in these differences, in the opportunity he sees there. He feels galvanised this evening after Potter's revelations and Draco's most recent dream. Things make more sense, pieces for Draco to try and put together to make a solid picture. This is, after all, what he does. He investigates, he solves things.
Harry lasted about two months of glaring sullenly at Draco whenever they both happened to be at the same event, before he realised it was getting in the way of actually enjoying the parties. And, it was making his face look really squinty and jawliney in the bad way in all the event photos. By the time Harry’s first book was published, he and Draco weren’t speaking, but they were nodding across the room, and by the time Harry’s second novel was out they’d had all of three conversations, and quite pleasant ones too. They had also had a really fabulous yelling match in the back garden of Sandra Kernig’s (budding fiction author) fancy London house. Harry had been slightly too drunk to remember the details of what set it off, but it started at the canapes when someone mentioned the war, and ended near the coy carp pond with both Harry and Draco
Convincing Cat to hop into the bike basket is, as predicted, not an outcome Cat is remotely interested in pursuing. Harry tries luring her with tuna. He tries luring her with a sardine. He tries using a sprat, gags, and then has to wash his hands for ten minutes because oh lord, he smells like the arse end of a fish market now, how lovely. Cat remains unmoved, and eventually Harry gives up and Transfigures the breadbin into a cat carrier, shoves a few tea towels in it, and unceremoniously but gently plonks the cat inside too. She doesn’t fight it or seem really that fussed, which is both nice and also deeply annoying for Harry’s now sprat-scented soul, but whatever. He trundles into town, narrowly pranging into only two privet hedges, and finds out from the vet that Cat is a) not microchipped or listed as missing, b) not pregnant (thank Merlin) and c) absolutely looking for a home. Harry tries not to feel smug when he pops Cat (name still pending, he’s working on it, really) back into her makeshift carrier and prepares to message Draco all about how he’s now a responsible and loving cat owner and Draco was wrong when he said this was just Harry procrastinating from working on his book. Turns out, it was both.
“Yes, obviously.” Draco crossed one ankle over the other, folding his arms as he leaned back against the kitchen counter. “But I’m not really sure this,” he waved one hand at the two vials of potion Harry had procured from the Healers and left on the kitchen table, “is the best way to approach resolving the issue of parenthood.”
He found, to his surprise, that the row was actually a bit cathartic. The next time Harry saw Draco―at an industry event in support of fuck knows what, Harry just went where Aggie told him to―they got drunk again, and they didn’t fight once. They even made paper cranes out of the napkins, because
Draco weaves in and out of the scant crowds, watching his feet as he heads towards The Opal Cauldron. He knows it’s nearby, and for all that his date was a bust, he’s due a celebration. He’s wrapped up this case, or as good as wrapped it up. He’s just waiting to be paid, and to have confirmation that Aneta is satisfied Draco has proved her husband is not only cheating but also fabulously bankrupting them on a Doxy-smuggling scheme that is going to go absolutely tits-up any day now. Which Draco
Harry sniggers, once, then dissolves into proper giggles as he tries to arrange the floating tea leaves into any kind of discernible shape. If he swishes his spoon it looks a bit like a string bean. A demented willy? Harry snorts.
For now, Harry decided to blame it on hormones, even though it was possibly too early in for him to be able to do that. And at least they weren’t going to have to buy a new house to accommodate two extra additions to the family.
Of course, he doesn’t exactly want Potter to know that. For this purpose, Draco’s gone for deceptively casual: tight black jeans and laced-up leather boots, a white top with a muted flower design at the chest, and his favourite tan leather jacket. It’s not as nice as the leather jacket Potter was wearing the first night they saw each other. Draco would even go as far as to bet Potter’s is real dragon leather, which is not something easy to come by these days. Draco’s is worn and soft though, artfully made to appear decades older than it is. It suits the pale of his skin and the Nordic blond of his hair. It cost him a mint and he looks amazing. Potter need only to be aware of that final element.
“I.” Draco licks his lips, his heartbeat thumping in his ears. “I just keep picking at it.” It’s an astoundingly edited version of the truth, and he doesn’t want to say why. He’ll probably throw up if Harry asks. He expects Harry has figured it out anyway, if he’s astute enough to notice Draco’s habit. Harry’s nowhere near as oblivious to what’s going on around him as he seems. Draco knows this, but it always catches him unawares anyway.
“Oh, well far be it from me to tell you what can and cannot do,” the Healer says somewhat smugly. “But should you initiate physical contact, you will most definitely intensify the ability to receive each other’s emotions or reactions. This may also occur during periods of heightened stress or strong emotion, even without any physical content, so do try and have a relaxing weekend.” He smiles his awful pleased smile. Harry would be annoyed if he wasn’t busy being confused and wildly embarrassed at all this talk of touching and feelings.
Draco wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. “Well, that’s got me right in the mood,” he said sarcastically, gently tossing his empty vial into the sink. It landed with a clunk, Harry’s making an even louder sound as he threw it in too. He hummed contemplatively, then turned to Draco.
Draco stops in front of him, right between Harry's parted legs. Harry's thighs strain slightly, tension thick through his muscles. He curls his fingers into loose fists, his face tilted up meet Draco's eyes. The air between them feels charged, electric. It isn't magic, Harry knows this. It's just
The night is warm and still as Draco exits the establishment, his back straight and his hands in his pockets. The streetlights have flickered on, illuminating the few people around and glinting off the windows of parked cars. It catches on Draco's hair, and then on the silver signet ring on his smallest left finger as he drags it through the white-blond strands. His heels click on the stone pavement, a comforting sturdy rhythm that blends into the night-time sounds of the city.
"This is," Harry adjusts his position, trying not to rub up against Draco and summon the powers of his upstairs brain. "Okay, ignoring my lower half," Draco chuckles against Harry’s cheek as kisses it, "we can be slow. Have dinner instead or something. You said you’re bad at this, and I don’t want to rush and make you—" Harry doesn’t say,
"Lie back." Draco pushes at Harry's stomach, Harry goes with it, flopping backwards against the bed as if boneless. "Leg up, too." Harry lets Draco lift his right leg, resting his heel against the bed. Like this, Harry feels opened up, exposed, and not a little bit ridiculous, arse up and with Draco's face so close. It makes everything feel sharper, somehow, the lack of control over what's happening, letting someone else call the shots.
Draco has two jobs, ostensibly. On the one hand he handles houses which contain magical artefacts or signatures, curse damage, old and malfunctioning wards and protections, malignant plumbing and, one time, a whole bunch of actual poltergeist activity.
Draco is both aware of what is likely to happen between them from here, and unable to comprehend it at the same time. There's no need for Potter to touch him. No need for them to walk so close together, for Potter to lean against him as they wait for traffic lights to turn green. Potter's warmth bleeds into Draco through the layers of their clothes. He runs cold these days, now that the blood of strangers fuels him as well as his own. Draco feels Potter's heat down to his core.
“Oh, shit, sorr ―” Harry started to rise, but Draco wrapped his arms around his thighs, pulling his back towards him with a rumbling moan. Harry groaned, rolling his hips and grinding himself back against Draco in time with the urging movements of Draco's hands as he set the pace.
God forbid there actually was an illicit potions smuggling ring going off in the marshlands, alerted to their presence by Harry moaning about the cold log and dodgy tea. He’ll never live that down.
Harry winces as Agatha’s voice sings out to him from the front door. Oh fuck. Oh fuck and crap and shit and―
Draco pulls away to allow them both a breath, before tilting Harry's head to the side so he can kiss down his neck. Harry almost jumps at how good it feels, his hips stuttering forward. He wants to grab Draco's thigh and pull it against his own groin, but he'd have to stop petting at Draco's hair, and he can't bring himself to do that. He can't stop himself from shivering either as Draco kisses his way down his neck to his throat. He bites gently, pulling at the skin with his teeth and Harry feels Draco shudder with pleasure at almost the same time Harry does.
Harry stared down at the test in his hand, the paper slip turning blue as he pulled it out of the ConceptiTest Potion solution.
favours people will be calling in. Work done for free. Information he will have to divulge in return for the information he was given. He understands why, though, as soon as he fully realises who Potter is looking for, and how deeply illegal the rabbithole she lives down is.
"Oh, Harry." Ginny’s face is kind as she leans closer to him, which oddly makes Harry feel worse. He doesn’t like being felt sorry for, even if he is being a bit tipsy and pathetic. Especially then.
He leaves a pile of notes and coins on the bar (possibly too much, Merlin knows Draco can’t get his head around the Koruna-to-Euro-to-Galleon exchange rate) and then heads out to find somewhere more palatable to drink.
Harry sits up with a frown and some effort, and a typewriter to the guts. Okay scratch that, Draco's question maybe
Cat wrangling achieved, the second thing Harry does is: finally reply to Aggie and sets up a meeting with her on Thursday.
Draco shrugs, crossing one leg over the other and letting his foot dangle. “I can think of worse things to wake up to.”
He tightens his fingers in the back of Potter's shirt, letting himself be led towards a neon-lit bar.
Harry oohs theatrically, shifting slightly in his squatting position. “Well now, a badger. I take it back, this mission isn’t a total waste of time. We’ve already got results.”
“I’m thrilled to hear that, Mr Potter,” The Healer responds, his voice heavy and tired. “The effects of this kind of phenomenologically induced pairing are often quite subtle, however, and not likely to be noticed until they truly make themselves known. In fact, had we not found you tonight, in the open air and suffering symptoms which at least six other couples have also presented with in the last four hours, then we might not have made the connection as quickly as we did. As it was, by the time you were both brought in, prone after a bout of stargazing, we were confident you were case number seven.” The Healer smiles.
Draco bends forwards, his words sliding off into a gasp as Harry presses his lips to the thin skin of Draco's inner wrist.
“Space magic,” says Draco, tapping long fingers irritably against the arm of his chair. “You’re saying we’ve been zapped by space magic.”
Ginny comes around at roughly 5pm with a Duffel full of clothes for Harry. She stays only briefly, the spike of Draco's jealousy a tangible thing that arrives on her heels. Harry's feels it settle in his lower back, an ugly throb, and an exciting one too. Ginny's no threat here, nothing for Draco to feel jealous of, and yet he does, and there's only one reason why―because he wants Harry, and she's had him before. By the time she leaves, Harry's more wound up than ever, arousal settling over his skin like moths wings. He wonders if Draco can feel it, and doesn't even try to pretend that he hopes otherwise. He wants Draco to feel as pent up as he does―to feel that he’s as much on the precipice of something happening as Harry is.
The rap of knuckles against Harry's door is startling in the quiet of the room, and yet not surprising in the least. Harry doesn't move, except to turn his head to look at the closed door. His fingers still linger along the waistband of his joggers.
"They've really committed, haven't they?" Potter's voice is close to Draco's ear as he leans in. His breath ghosts along Draco's neck. "Of all the dodgy places I've been, I think this might be… the dodgiest. In every sense of the word."
He gasps again, ending in a low, shocked groan, when Draco leans forward, releasing Harry's thigh and grasping Harry's prick. He runs his loose fist up and down it once, and then again, before tipping forwards and wrapping his lips around the head.
him to see and give due diligence. Draco’s already filled three pages of his own notebook with ideas about where to start, when he forces himself to stop and put it aside.
Draco shuts his eyes in a hard, stern blink. He can't think about that. When he opens them again, Potter is still sitting there, smiling and unconcerned, chatting to a man who looks to be in his twenties. Who knows how old he really is, considering where they are. Potter shakes his hair out of his eyes, leans back to casually sling his arm over the back of his chair. His scar is hidden. His forehead is bare. It's him, though. Draco knows it. He's not even wearing a Glamour.
," Draco corrects himself, forcing himself to say the name. He clears his throat, shooting Potter a quick look before he continues. Potter is staring straight ahead, the cherry of the cigarette flaring to life as he takes a drag. "I know Voldemort made one."
“Drink your tea,” Harry orders gently, tapping his finger against the lid again. “It’ll be cold soon.  You know I'm only allowed to use a weak stasis heat charm on it.”
"Okay?" asks Draco, pulling his finger out slowly and then pushing back in, this time to the second knuckle. Harry nods, still keeping eye contact with Draco, who rises up up off his haunches and higher onto his knees. He sets up a slow rhythm, his expression almost wondering. Harry can only imagine what he's feeling, if Draco's own arse is clenching down around nothing when Harry himself tightens against the clever, perfect intrusion of Draco's finger. He already wants more―more fingers, faster, everything. Distantly, Harry is aware that his right hand feels overly warm, and fidgety. His mouth feels empty again, his skin prickly; his cock is a hot line against his belly when it touches his skin.
at this. I’m not just saying that." He slides his hand up Harry’s chest, over the pearlescent buttons on his shirt and up to his bare collarbone. He strokes his thumb against it. "I’m not good at dating. I have one ex, and she left me with a kid and a fear of rejection the size of Ireland and I just…" Draco taps his thumb on Harry’s heated skin, then slips his fingers under the collar of his shirt. "You’re my friend now and I would rather not shit the bed here, as it were. It’s hard to think of someone wanting to get in line for me, when I come with…so much baggage.
But Harry was coping okay with being a twenty eight year old pregnant elephant. What he was finding distinctly unexpected and infuriating was that he was so fucking
"I’ve wanted to do this for so long," Harry groans, mouthing at Draco’s jaw and pawing at his back, his arse, getting his hands under his canvas shirt and rubbing over his shoulder blades. He wants to touch him everywhere, all the inconsequential places and the exciting ones too: the backs of his knees, the dip of his throat, the shadows under his clavicles. It’s maddening and brilliant.
"Ah." Harry lets his arms fall back to his sides. Right. So, that’s a no on the convincing beaming, then. Harry sags in his chair, relieved at not having to fake productivity at least. He blows a loud raspberry, at his book, at the universe, at his writer’s block. And all over the table in front of him.
“Wonderful. Make yourself at home, then. I’ll be just in the room one door down, and if you need anything in the night,” Draco’s smile softens, “sort it out yourself because I don’t want to be woken up,” he finishes softly, looking at Harry with such an unerring fondness that Harry almost has to look away. He doesn’t though, letting himself enjoy the moment and trying to differentiate what’s his own affection, and what’s coming from Draco. It’s like trying to follow motes of dust in a sunbeam with his eyes, a confusing and mesmerising dance of near identical particles, but one that he enjoys watching all the same.
“It was good.” Draco’s voice is softer his time, but no less sure. It’s odd how settling Harry finds that. There was a time when even the sound of Draco’s voice could piss Harry off, set his nerves on edge. It’s quite the opposite now.
"Far from it," Draco explains. "I’ve just wrapped up a job. My dance card is clear, for the moment. And I don’t want your money, I’ve already told you that."
Harry crosses his arms, then lets his breath out in a whoosh. He nods. He's not quite up to saying yes out loud yet, but he's thinking it, feeling it settle down in his chest.
There’s an abandoned greenhouse, right at the back of the lot. There are unruly trees, and snagged brambles, and the grass is long and lush. It feels like the Forest, but tamer somehow, and Draco likes it. It feels like the spot where the castle meets the wild, or where the wild is trying to creep back in. There’s something mildly thrilling about it at night, the potential for danger, for something to look back at Draco as he stares into the dark, lush woods. Draco’s always loved that feeling.
And he does feel besotted. It's not a new feeling exactly. Draco's never before felt love for Potter. Admiration from afar, and then bitter and covetous jealousy, and then something like a helpless and useless crush in his sixth and seventh years at Hogwarts. He knows none of those are love, or being in love. They're branches on the same tree, perhaps. And none of them are the same as the fondness he feels now, and knowing he is
“Yes, yeah,” Draco mumbled, cheeks flushing and soft prick starting to fill out again as it lay against his belly. “Fuck, yes, do that.” He moaned, all teasing forgotten as Harry lined up, slowly thrusting inside.
fucking close. Harry thought that at least his way they would just both take the fertility decoction, and then deal with the aftermath when it happened.
A hit, that is, in the sense that it has a small launch, and gets sent out to all the schools in Harry's area, and ends up on a bunch of shelves in local libraries. Harry has never been prouder.
"Aggie!" Harry beams as she walks in. Or, he tries to. It possibly works. "So nice to see you, my favourite agent!"
"I’ll be here," he says, as the baman impatiently motions Potter towards one of the velvet-curtained doors across the room. Potter nods. He lets his hand fall away from Draco’s arm, running his fingers down to Draco’s wrist as he does so.
Potter picks up his pint, and takes a slow sip. It leaves his upper lip damp. "I could ask you the same thing," he states in a calm and measured tone. Draco feels the exact opposite of calm. His fingers tighten around his cool glass.
Draco busies himself with finding clothes for Potter to wear, a spare set of soft pyjama bottoms and a plain black vest. He estimates they are a similar size. He adds a pair of thick, soft socks to the pile, and then feels mildly ridiculous for doing it. He leaves them there all the same; Draco hates sleeping with bare feet. For all he knows Potter might be the same.
Still, it’s not something he’s sure he wants Draco to know about. At best, it’s a bit creepy of Harry to watch him so much ― at worst, it’s far too revealing of how Harry feels about Draco himself.
“You’re welcome, Draco.” Kill ‘em with kindness, is apparently Harry’s sparring tactic du jour. He very badly would like a nap. Before either Draco or the Healer―whose name is Jones orJefferies or something j-ish and dull that Harry’s managed to already forget―can start off again, Harry speaks.
No one really talks to Harry as plainly as Draco does, and Harry repays the favour. He likes that they don’t appear to be afraid of calling each other out, dispensing with sugar coating their barbs. It’s an odd thing to value in a friend, Harry thinks, but he’s an odd person, who’s lived an odd life.
Draco doesn't tease this time, moving his lips down over Harry's prick. His mouth is hot, perfect, and Harry's own mouth waters. He laughs, breathless, when he realises what it is he's feeling―Draco's mouth between his own legs, mirrored for Harry. Harry writhes against the bed, sucking on his own tongue. He nearly chokes on it when Draco's fingers brush his prostate.
"Are we doing this, then, Harry?" His hair falls across his forehead as he raises his hands back to Harry's face, stopping just shy of touching him. Harry breathes in deeply, drinking in the sight of Draco, warm and real and right in front of Harry. Ready for him.
He doesn’t know much about Horcruxes, really, only the basics, uncovered from the darkest tomes in his father’s private library. There was no mention of there being more than one, though, or what they were. Draco feels deep apprehension at the idea of Voldemort having split his soul so many times—even more so the implication that he made one unintentionally. He listens intently to Potter’s every, quiet word.
“Wonderful.” Draco sits back, takes a tiny bite at one corner of the toast he’s so meticulously spread. “And how was the wank?” he asks crisply. “That was also satisfactory, I take it?”
Harry grunted in reply, too furiously turned on and determined to wallow in his middle-of-the-night body crisis to speak properly.
Draco nods, shoulders slumping as he relaxes. “Good,” he says quietly, allowing himself a brief flash of a smile, before turning back to meet Harry’s eyes. “That’s a fucking relief.”
?" Harry yells, lurching backwards and almost tripping over his own feet. His wand is pointed straight at Draco’s chest before he even notices he’s raised it.
It takes a few more tugs of Harry's fist to have him fully hard, and he pumps his cock once, twice more before letting it go. He eyes Draco's lines of shampoos and body wash, a crimson coloured soap that smells of berries and citrus. It turns Harry on even more, the scent of Draco's products and body potions and illicit and daring thrill. He tips a small circle of a lavender coloured lotion into his cupped palm, his breath catching as he angles his body away from the stream to rub his hand along the length of his prick.
Draco is sat in his flat, smoking, when he hears the soft pitter-patter of raindrops hitting the pavement two floors below. He has the window already open, to let the smoke out and the cool night air inside in exchange. He leans out a little, the rain landing gently on his face. He shuts his eyes, then smiles.
Draco thinks his heart stops. He's worried he may have misheard, but at the same time he knows he hasn't. He just can't take it in.
“It’s okay, Draco,” Harry repeats, right as Draco feels himself drifting off, cheek pressed to Harry’s messy hair.
That's why Draco relies on real donors, not blood bags. He has contacts these days, and very good ones. He's smart, and he's safe, and he could still end up on the pointy end of a wooden stake despite it all. Knowing as much as he can is his best precaution; he makes it his business to do this for every place he goes to. As a private eye, it’s essential. As a queer vampire, it’s survival.
It was like a kind of second puberty, Harry thought as he sat up in bed, cock throbbing between his legs at ― he glanced grumpily at the bedside clock ― two am in the fucking morning. He pulled another pillow behind his head, let his neck rest against it. He couldn't remember the last time he’d been woken up by an erection. Woken up
Draco looks away, moving so he only has one elbow resting on the bar. He focuses on how revolting it must be, all the grubby hands that have been here over the years and all the times it hasn't been wiped down, and not on the giddy swoop in his stomach at Potter's words. Draco's craved positive attention from him since he was eleven, yes. That doesn't mean he knows how to handle it when he gets it, though.
Harry’s children's book, about a garden-traipsing cat and the two enemies-turned-friends who solve crimes with her and with illustrations by one Dean Thomas, is a massive, massive hit.
Potter nods as if in agreement. "You’re probably right. I don’t think many people know what Voldemort had done. I doubt he trusted many with that secret." Potter pulls out his wand, having wisely decided not to bother with jumping the fence, and mutters an
. Draco lifts his own head away from the wall to stare down at Potter, at the stretch of his mouth around Draco’s girth, at the gentle crease between his brows as he concentrates on taking Draco down. The suction of his mouth as he pulls back to suckle at the head is mindblowing, and Draco’s mouth drops open once more on a silent groan. His breath hitches as Harry swirls his tongue around the slit of Draco’s cock, then runs it along the underside of the head. Draco’s thighs are starting to tremble.
Ginny tries to hold it in, then snorts a laugh. "I know, sorry, the drinks have caught up with me. My point still stands though!"
Harry only really registered that he’d screamed that in Draco’s stunned face once he was done, which did make him realise he was reacting a little more animatedly than he usually would. It had taken him another hour to apologise to Draco about it, but he suspected that was actually some kind of record between them in terms of making up; they were both capable of a mean sulk, and Draco was reigning king of the silent treatment, as was decreed after the great Christmas Brussel Sprout debacle of 2002. (It wasn’t Harry’s fault he forgot them, honestly, there was no need for Draco to cause such a stink about it, since when does Christmas cheer depend on the sodding
knew it, too. "I’m not having a go at you about it, honest. Really. I just." She puts her arm around his, her small hand gripping his bicep. Her fingers are cool from holding her Bellini, and her nails press in gently as she squeezes. "I feel like…maybe you put off doing it, and stayed in something you didn’t like because you felt like you had to. And maybe you’re doing that with your book? Because you’re stuck but you don’t think you can say no to doing it." Harry squirms a little in his chair, his face hot and his chest tight. He nods after a while, for her to go on and also because she’s hitting a nerve. He thinks she might be right.
He turns to find Potter watching him. He's put a distance between them since the strange closeness of only moments before. His expression is a little strange, but not unhappy.
"Yep," Potter replies blithely, popping the P. "That’s it. And before you ask, no, I do not care to expand on that in any way, and yes, that is all you are getting."
Ironically, and annoyingly, Harry often finds that when he’s truly overtired he can’t get to sleep for hours. It’s like the moment Harry’s head hits the pillow his brain decides it needs to be alert, just to fuck with him. Thankfully, for once in his life, tonight seems to be an exception to this. As he burrows down into the soft blankets of Draco’s guests room, clad in a top that smells of Draco’s laundry powder, Harry feels himself slipping off into a thick and dreamless sleep almost instantly.
"You want to help me?" Potter sits up even straighter, his back against the headboard. "You're… still working this case?"
“It looks sore,” Harry mumbles, finally looking up from the bottle and meeting Draco’s eyes. Draco wishes he’d looked away. Harry’s expression is earnest, and not unkind, but far too knowing. Draco feels flushed and humiliated, and sick. He wants to pull his sleeve down and run into the Forest, keep going until something catches him. He doesn’t move a muscle.
Harry drops his head to one shoulder with a low moan. "Yep," he manages, before giving up and letting himself fall backwards against the bed. Like this, the angle is better, as his body accommodates the stretch of both of Draco's long fingers. He maybe should have gone slower, but he likes the slight burn of it, the way Draco isn't letting up and trusts Harry to know what he likes. And he
. His wand skitters along the wooden floor, under the crack of the door, and into Draco's palm. Harry can't see what's happening, only hear it.
.” Harry drops his head into the crook of his bent elbow, in lieu of simply Apparating on the spot. “I cannot believe this.”
Draco’s sure he’s got him, even if Potter’s not ready to say it. He just has to seal the deal now. He tries not to let himself think about how much he desperately wants this, or why.
“You want that, don’t you?” Harry lifted his legs higher, one heel digging into the small of Draco’s back. Draco choked out an affirmative sound. “Come on Draco, do it, I want to feel you making me pr―”
Harry gusts a laugh, then frowns. "But you didn’t reply," he says softly. It’s not accusatory. His head is still too muddled by this whiplash-inducing conversation for that. He’s happy he’s still standing really. There’s a smile buried in his chest, trying to ride up onto his face in a wave of emotion. He swallows to keep it down, in case this really is too good to be true and he’s daydreaming it all.
He doesn't know how to put this into words, for all that he is a loquacious man. Instead, Draco moves his hand, lays it out on the bed between them palm up.
"In the most basic sense," he eventually responds. "I understand it is the splitting of one’s soul through the act of murder. He-Who…
He pulls his lower lip between his teeth, bites gently down on it as he toys with the waistband of his joggers. He could touch himself, now, let Draco know what he's doing to him. Harry knows this is an invitation―it can’t be anything but, given that Draco is aware what Harry will be feeling right now, having been on the other end of it this morning. Harry wants to lie back and let himself wallow in it, slip his hand between his legs. He wants more, though, more than just an echo. He could have it too, could get up and go to Draco's door. There's a curious passiveness coursing through him, however, a desire to stay put and make Draco come to him. Harry doesn't know why, but the sudden knowledge that yes Draco is interested in him, yes Draco does want him, feels satisfying beyond measure, and yet he still wants more. He wants Draco to say it to him, to come and get him―to mumble into Harry's skin what his body is whispering to Harry through the bond. He’ll sit here and wait for that.
Draco groans against Harry's skin, planting kisses as he nods. His hair tickles at the base of Harry's sternum. His cock feels heavy and feverish between his legs, his head spinning with over stimulation. Draco's barely even touched him.
He celebrates all of this amazing Getting Things Done A Bit Sort Of by riding his wobbly cat bike into the town and meeting Ginny for boozy brunch. The pub is called The Holly Tree, and is a bit old and doesn’t have the nicest menu, but they open at ten for punters to drop by, and they don’t seem to mind that Harry and his friends are always rubbish at giving them the right money (Ron even tried to pay with a Galleon once, which Hermione quickly jumped in and pretended was an antique coin,
He senses Potter wants to give it, too. People who aren't desperate to reveal their lonely, solitary burdens don't respond in leading half-answers the way Potter does. They don't stand so close to their childhood rivals and boyhood enemies. They don't lean in when others would lean away, the way Potter is leaning closer now.
Draco’s dreamt of the dark figure in his room every night since speaking with Potter, since helping him with this case. He knows there must be a connection. One doesn’t accept a job to search for a necromancer—for someone who’s got both arms elbow-deep in the grave and beyond—and also dream of looming apparitions, and not see the link there. Or at least, Draco imagines that ignoring the likely connection could lead to some trouble down the line.
Eventually, Potter shrugs. He breathes a soft sigh. "Fine. I suppose I don’t have a choice here, anyway."
Potter blinks. "You seem awfully confident about that for someone who has no idea what I’m even looking for."
But Potter's apparently none of those things. He's just… right there, messy hair and boyish cheeks and easy smile. It's so familiar it makes Draco's nails scratch against the wood of his table as he stares.
It's also almost nice in a way, to be reminded of his own mortality―for there to possibly be something other than the sun that can truly hurt him. He decides to keep this thought to himself.
Harry falls asleep to the memory of Draco’s skin against his lips, and the sound of Draco’s soft breathing as he sleeps.
"Yes, really." Draco fights to keep his voice neutral, parroting the string of words he was told would bargain them entry to see Potter's witch. "The delivery arrives on the eleventh. My friend here needs to speak with the Ferryman to confirm."
Harry bursts into a hysterical laugh. "God." He rubs at his eyes, pushing his glasses up into his hair. He leaves his hands over his face. "Yeah, I’ve been meaning to buy a new one," he mumbles through his fingers.
Potter manages a weak but genuine smile at that. "Well, you can’t sleep on the floor either," he counters, kneeling up onto the bed.
It’s been three years since he saw a sunrise. He does miss it, for all that he never appreciated it when it was his to observe pain-free.
“I’ve ruined my pants,” Draco replies, shamelessly. His voice comes out rough. “Both inside and out.” He trails his index finger over the sensitive side of Harry’s knee, down to his ankle. He grips Harry’s ankle lightly, then squeezes. Harry wonders if Draco can feel that, too, through the bond, or if it’s simmered down now that both of their feelings aren’t at such a fever pitch.
"The―oh, you know what! The thingy, that you do. Make smug, smirky faces when I talk about Draco." Harry frowns when Agatha just raises her eyebrows. "We’re mates and that’s all and you know it."
"Fuck," Draco mumbles after a moment, mouth pressed tight against Harry’s shoulder. Harry can feel the heat of his breath through the material.
happen to be precise, and Draco decided not to punctuate the silence in which they walked to the club with his questions. They bubble inside him, just under the surface, alongside the intermittent kicks of lust that spike every time the back of Potter's hand brushes against Draco's fingers.
“About this bond business,” Harry says, having taken the time to select his words and still coming up rather short.  Draco smiles wryly, leaning against the wall once more as if he’s too tired to properly hold himself up. “Have you been able to. Y’know.” Harry shrugs, makes a swirling motion with one hand. He leaves it half extended between them, careful not to make contact.
Harry’s taking this all in, trying to think of something nice to say, when another message pops in under the last.
Harry furrows his brow as he thinks. “I think it means space is really big and they have no real idea how this works,” he posits. The Healer smiles what looks to be his first genuine smile of the evening.
“I just feel.” Draco pauses for a moment, closing his eyes and choosing his words carefully as he rubs slowly over his temples again. “That this has got to be complete horse shit.”
's been having kittens about it, running tireless articles on where he's gone, why he's gone, who he's run off with. He's undercover in Spain, he's an Unspeakable of the highest ranking, he's gone Muggle and joined MI5. His body's lying in a forest in Devon, bones scattered by the smallest creatures and carrion birds. That last one caused a riot, condemnation falling on the paper for daring to even think it. The
. Draco's wanted this: to be helpful to Potter, to be of use, to give something back. It's trite, and it's nonsense, and it's burned Draco up since Potter saved his life. He's so desperately wanted to do something in return, anything. Something that comes close to reparations.
"Oh god." Agatha lets her bag drop onto the floor, the strap sliding off her shoulder dramatically. "You’ve not written a thing, have you?"
"Ohhhhhhh," Harry says, nodding and drawing out the word in an attempt to seem natural and normal and prepared for the horrible conversation that is surely about to ensue. Nothing good comes of ‘we should talk’, especially when it’s coming on the heels of a drunken confession, forty-eight hours of text silence, and a surprise blond in the kitchen. And a wasted sausage roll.
Potter nods, still blinking sleep out of his eyes. "Yeah." He yawns, wide enough to crack his jaw. "Like a log, actually."
as he spurted over his fist, pulse after pulse of warm washing over his fingers, onto the pillow before him, and he swayed, dizzy and overstimulated. Draco licked at him again, mouth opening wide as he exhaled in a warm rush, hips lifting off the bed as he came himself. Harry leant his head against his outstretched arm, catching his breath and letting the warm post-orgasm lethargy overtake him, as Draco’s breathing slowly came back to something slightly more normal.
"Yes. Okay then…" Harry looks away, then back. He slowly pockets his wand. "Are you not meant to be in Australia right now?" he questions.
, sausage roll held in his mouth and shopping bag and wand held in each hand, and then reappears in his kitchen moments later.
“Bingo, Mr Potter.” He points his quill at Harry. “Albeit, again, an oversimplified view of the situation. You see, we have astronomers, Muggle and magical, who can map the stars for us, the turn of the planets, the pull of the moon. They can predict some significant astrological events, but they cannot predict all of them, and they cannot thus predict with reliable certainty if and when these events will affect the magical fields on earth, and of those inhabiting it. Sometimes what we see in the sky passes us by with barely a glance our way. Other times, such as we saw tonight, these anomalies seem to catch those who watch too closely in their wake. And when they do,” The Healer brings his hands together, quill cupped between them, “there is often a magical surge which in turn creates an orbital pull between two magical beings, and thus.” The Healer claps his hands fully around the quill. “A connection is made between them.”
“To sleep,” Harry grumbled, closing his eyes as Draco ran his fingers up and down his cloth-covered cock. Draco chuckled against his skin.
Draco’s eyes were glued to the dirt on his face, at the red of cheeks and around his eyes. There was a reflex in him to do just what Potter’s warned him not to; to ridicule, to tear him down for crying while sat in a pile of wilting weeds, alone at night.
“Very well. First, how long it will last,” the Healer states. “As I mentioned, these bonds do not happen often. They will fade on their own, usually within six to eight months ―”
The image of Draco in tiny swimming togs and scowling on a crystalline beach, clear skies and clearer waters in front of him, his hair salt-water tousled and his chest bare, swims into Harry’s head. Harry snorts a laugh, and then blushes all the same. It’s a stupid mental picture, and also a very sexy one. Harry wonders if possibly the fact he hasn’t seen Draco in person for almost a month has led him to daydream him as being fitter than he actually is, or if the accidental intimacy of talking with him every day has instead made Harry’s crush expand to gargantuan proportions.
The barman ambles over, and Draco's words dry up on his tongue, evaporating like all unspent emotion does. Draco swallows the bitter taste away.
“Mmm. Fine, I think.” Harry frowns. “You? What time is it, it feels…early.” Harry waves a hand to indicate how he feels about that, which is essentially, vague and half-asleep. He thinks he communicates this to Draco well enough, based on his amused expression.
After a moment Draco clears his throat, coughing into his cupped fist. "Granger gave me your ward keys," he explains, his voice pitched low like he’s confessing to something dodgy. Which, hang on a second.
"So you’ll be okay with me being blunt, and saying―stop being a fucking martyr." She grabs Harry’s free hand with both of hers, shaking it once and smiling at him benevolently. Harry’s hand bangs against the table, limp and shocked.
“It's not dark. The lamp’s on.” Harry inclines his head behind him, indicating the bedside. His fingers scrunch against the bed covers as his arms bears his weight behind him. “What were you doing?” he asks, moving his other hand away from his waistband and resting it back behind him. The change in position opens him up even more, his arms behind him and his legs parted. He watches the bob of Draco's Adam's apple as he swallows. He wants to lick at the dip of Draco's flushed throat. His mouth waters with it.
Harry nods, ignoring the frightful remark; he deserves a medal for not pointing out that Draco looks like a surprised scarecrow with his current bedhead. “Which guest room is that?” asks Harry as he follows him down the long hallway. “Don’t you have roughly seventy-five spare rooms in this colossal eyesore of a house.”
. He sits up, and contemplates healing the weeping patch on his arm, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t hate his new wand, but he’s still not that familiar with it, and he prefers to only use it for things he can’t get by without. On some level, he also doesn’t trust his subconscious not to blast his entire forearm off as he tries to heal it, given it wants him to scratch it off in his sleep. The new mark on his arm isn’t deep anyway, just raw, and it’ll heal quickly enough on its own. At least, it would, if he could just bloody leave it alone.
On a hunch, Draco tightens both hands again, just the slightest increase of pressure, and hears Potter let out a high and needy gasp. His breathing is erratic and frantic as he presses his face into Draco’s belly, his free hand still hanging onto the open waist of Draco’s jeans as if for dear life. Dracp does it again, alternating between gentle strokes and tight pulls, following the hitches of Potter’s breath as he does. Potter’s entire body feels tense, his muscles straining towards release, and he lets out a deep and guttural groan as he rises up onto his knees. The sound is buried against Draco’s belly as Potter comes, his breathing hot and damp against Draco’s bare skin. Draco spreads his fingers through Potter’s hair, soothing and calming, as Potter comes down from the high of orgasm. It’s a full minute of Potter’s laboured breathing, the slow tremble of aftershocks running over his shoulders, before Draco hears Potter mutter a quiet spell. The zing of the Cleaning Charm running over his lower half is startling and unexpected, as is the realisation Potter has cast this wandlessly. Potter mutters the same spell again for himself, for the mess over his own hand and groin, before he looks up at Draco. He slowly moves both hands to tuck Draco’s soft cock away, to do the button and fly of his jeans back up again. It’s so surprisingly intimate, being put back together when Potter just recently took him apart, that Draco finds it hard to breath. He keeps his hands in Potter’s hair, holds his eye contact as Potter finishes. He eventually stands with a shaky motion, coming face to face with Draco.
Harry smiles to himself about it, smug and pleased, all the way down the hall to where he vaguely remembers the bathroom is.
Harry laughs, giddy and relieved too. He bumps his knee, still hidden under the covers, against Draco’s back, then leaves it there. He’s itching for a point of contact. “Were you worried I’d say no?”
"How did you guess," Harry grumbles, chin resting on his cupped palm, face smooshed up. He picks at a piece of croissant left on his plate.
It’s huge. He has no idea what he’s going to say to her, or how he is going to sort out this mess of a book deal. He should ask for more time, but he has no idea how much he would need considering he’s got, and had, buckets of the stuff and still can’t write a damn word. A word that isn’t a silly story about cat and detective adventures, that is. He’s got two days to think of something, at least
He doesn’t remember getting here, just waking up under stiff hospital sheets with a banger of a headache and a weirdly desperate need to know where Draco was at. The answer to which turned out to be: Draco was similarly miserable, and in a bed right opposite Harry’s. His hair was sticking up like mad, the way it always does after a sleep and a fact which Harry is only privy to because of Draco's propensity to nap at his desk during late night shifts. He’s like a cat sometimes, Harry thinks. He can fall asleep anywhere.
Slowly, but clearly Draco nods. The smile that spreads across Potter's face is wide and beatific. He takes the half-drunk beer from Draco's hand and sets it on the tall table nearby. Potter sets his own glass next to it. He runs his free hand down the side of Draco's jacket, then grips it in a loose fist. He pulls Draco closer, inch by slow inch, turning away just as their bodies meet.
Their fingers brush as Draco takes the bottle from him. Draco hopes Harry doesn't notice the shake in his hand. If he does, Harry doesn't mention it. He tucks his hair behind his ear, shuffles closer still. Their thighs are pressed together, and Harry’s side is warm against Draco’s. Harry clears his throat again, a nervous habit it seems.
“Heathen,” he mumbles, before shaking his hair out of his eyes and tucking his wand away. “Right.” Draco plants his hands on his hips, his jacket and shirt rolled up to expose his forearms; Harry resists looking at the somewhat mottled and faded scar on the left. He knows Draco hates that. “That’s the bed sorted. You can borrow some night clothes of mine, if you’d like? We’ll sort out fetching some proper things of yours for tomorrow when neither of us are dead on our feet. Toothbrush and so on.” Draco trails off as if talking to himself, already turning to head out the door and to his own room to gather some clothes for Harry.
"Maybe." Harry presses his forehead against Draco's. "I think I'd like to hear it?" he admits. His voice is low with arousal, but he can hear the tremor in it. He knows Draco will hear it, too.
Draco kisses the inside of Harry’s thigh as he eases Harry’s leg down from the bed. Harry struggles up onto his elbow, his arms wobbly and his breathing still uneven. He’s sure his face and chest must be a hectic red. Sat between his legs, Draco looks no better, his usually neat hair wild and messy across his forehead and his chest mottled a blotchy pink from exertion. Harry stares down at him for long moments, drinking him in. He wants to save this memory, preserve it in his mind and keep it as pristine as if it were in a pensieve.
He’s much more equipped to deal with the pull between his past and who he is now, though. Trimming his hair short is something that he oddly still finds comfort in, a way to bring The Boy Who Lived and Just Harry together that Harry feels comfortable with. Or maybe he’s still just not in the mood to be arsed with brushing it; it was always a complete mess, and it still grows thick and fast. He thinks he cuts a striking figure with it, too, even though some people still see it as an odd form of punishment, just as his aunt had when she’d cropped it all off. Hermione says he’s got the cheekbones to carry it off, and Ginny used to like running her hands over it while they were in bed together. Harry’s not had a lot of experience with men, but he’d like to know what it feels like to have their hands running over his hair in bed, too. The thought of specifically
Harry burrows sleepily into the mattress, stubble scratching against the pillow and limbs warm and lazy. The neck of his borrowed top is loose and open, and the room is dimly lit by the sun; the thick curtain block most of it out, charmed no doubt to give Draco's guests the optimal amount of a lie in. Raised to be ever the gracious host, is little lord Malfoy. Harry rubs his forehead against the pillow, a rhythmic back and forth as he tries to decide if he'll get up now or try and catch a bit more sleep.
At midday Harry notices that Draco hasn't messaged him yet, which is definitely weird. At the time, he thinks nothing of it and just puts it down to timezones or Boggarts or any number of other things that might be occupying Draco’s time. When he opens their text chain, though, ready to fire off the usual
knows it, the parasitic force that transformed him three years ago is more than fucking aware that it has been sated. He wants it, though.
"Potter, are you okay?" There’s the sound of the teapot being put down against the table. Draco sounds genuinely concerned.
Draco laughs in a gust of wry exhaustion. “Well, you know they exist, and you seem to understand the situation well enough, so surely you know when these things are going to go off?”
Harry sits on the foot of the bed, bare feet flexing on the floorboards, as he tries to decide if he's tired enough to try and sleep now or if he should perhaps venture downstairs for a book. He knows Draco's turning in early, having announced as much after finishing off his bowl of watercress soup. Harry's tired as well (neither of them got enough sleep) but he's also not used to having this much unfilled time of a weekend. The only outside time they've had today was taking Nettle for a quick walk around the nearby park, where she sniffed every blade of grass possible before finally having a wee. The three of them are feeling a little cooped up as a result. There's nothing for it, Harry knows, but he could really do with a long, exhausting run right now, to knock some of the overtired and fizzy energy out of him.
“I feel I need to point out,” he kissed gently over Harry’s Adam’s apple, “that this is the most Gryffindor approach to conception that could possibly exist.”
," Harry gasps out as Draco moves his hand faster, fucking him on his fingers. Harry stomach tenses, his cock leaking against it as he digs his heel into the bed, the toes of his other foot pressing against the floorboards.
“It’s not an ideal place for a drop off, though.” Harry frowns. “I'm surprised they’re taking the tip seriously.”
Harry considers arguing with him, for the sake of it, but gives in. His calves are starting to ache from the weird position, anyway, and they’re rostered to monitor this area until the sun comes up. He might as well save his bickering for the smaller hours of the morning, when he and Draco are properly sick of each other and starting to snipe. They’re friends now, and far better mates than anyone would have anticipated (least of all Harry himself), and they are astoundingly good at pissing each other off and getting on each other’s tits and verbally swatting at each other like irate cats.
“You need to sleep,” Harry whispered, unable to stop himself from grinding down against the firm ridge of Draco’s thigh.
"Take the bed," Draco says. "I don’t really even need to sleep." He feels strangely exposed saying this, in revealing this strange new quality in his life.
He doesn’t know if the rest of the world is aware of this, though. In his experience, some people have been, while others were clearly terrified of so much as accidentally nicking their lip on Draco’s teeth. He can’t really begrudge them their ignorance, as it isn’t as though he knew better before he joined the realms of the undead.
Harry sets the cup down with a solid clunk against the hardwood table. He wonders if 2pm is too early to admit he’s having a crisis and give up for the day. He’s already having mental conversations with his tea; it’s hardly going to get better from here.
And when it comes to sex, nothing thrills him more than putting that control into practice, in refusing to give in to what the creature in him wants versus what the man in him will allow. It’s a powerful, powerful rush.
Harry spreads his legs slightly, sighing as he works himself over. He rests his free hand against the cool glass shower wall once more, leaving a smear of sweet-smelling lotion in his wake. Peppermint, Harry realises, the same scent he's smell before on Draco's skin when Harry's leant close to read a document over his shoulder or sling an arm around him in the pub. He bites his lip, a low moan slipping out as he grips himself tighter.
"Pardon?" he says redundantly on an embarrassingly breathy voice. In a last ditch effort to poke holes in an unexpected positive thing, Draco reasons that Potter is most likely just telling him he's also into men, or not straight at the least. It's not a come on. It's not what Draco's gut tells him, and not what the tight feeling in his chest hopes it is.
Harry spits his sausage roll out. It lands with a soggy splat on the floor. "I said what the fuck?" Harry drops his shopping bags by his feet too, then looks around, stunned. "What’re you…how…" He blinks, trying to compose his thoughts into some semblance of order, only it’s like herding cats and they’re all on skateboards, and also on ice. That’s covered in marbles. Harry’s got no hope.
Harry sighs. “My wand is around here somewhere.” Harry flops a hand behind him, starts to lean up to get it. “I can try and cast a cleaning…”
He’s not overly surprised by this, although his mother is, based on the histrionics pouring from her room when she finds out. Draco’s somewhat relieved; there’s nothing for him there except guilt, and the need to watch his back, and the lingering smell of smoke in every hallway and behind each glowering statue. Draco’s haunted by that scent now.
He hands are behind his back, his pyjama bottoms slung low on his hips. Harry can see the jut of his hip bones, leading up to the smooth muscles of his abdomen. He smiles, lets his eyes linger obviously over the bare expanse of Draco’s stomach, his torso. They're criss crossed with the faintest white scars, thin lines that are too neat to be anything other than magical. Harry knows he should feel guilt at the sight of them, that he left those marks on Draco, but he doesn’t now.
The door to The Opal Cauldron is deceptively dull. Little flecks of dust come off on the backs of Draco’s knuckles as he raps them against it in the specific rhythm needed to gain him entry. His mouth twists in distaste as he flicks his fingers to cast the dust away; someone has clearly been overdoing the Concealing Charms here. There’s no need for the door to be bloody disintegrating off its hinges. He tucks his hands back into the pockets of his jacket. It’s tan leather, coming to his waist bomber style. The evening isn’t quite chilly enough to warrant a jacket, considering he’s wearing a long-sleeved white shirt underneath, however it’ll be cold later. Draco will likely be out until the wee hours of the morning, before he needs to retire to avoid the sunrise.
He’s still puzzling it out, in a languid way, when his eyelids begin to droop, sleep pulling his mind away. He lets it go; he decides he doesn't need to know. Whatever it is, it’s real, and it’s coming from him. That’s enough.
nightmare." Potter laughs, wry and a little helpless. "And for once, I wasn’t having them. Not once." He rubs his hand over his mouth again.
Long minutes passed as Draco tried to figure out whether Harry knew he was there, if he ought to say something, or if he should just turn around and leave. He didn’t want to do the latter; he couldn't sleep, and this was his spot. But now, it was Potter’s spot too, and Draco, overtired and surprised, didn’t know what to do with this new information.
"I’ve Hobnobs around here somewhere," Harry goes on, filling up the tense air with jabber and the sound of opening cupboards. "Or Digestives maybe, but the shit ones, with no chocolate."
Of course, the fact that he keeps being distracted by lemon tart might be one of the reasons this book is taking so long. It shouldn't be this hard to concentrate. He shouldn’t be this bored by his own plot.
"A shitake." Ginny giggles, then playfully thumps Harry on the shoulder. "No, shut up, stop distracting me. You’re not a shitty mushroom, that’s my point! You don’t have to just make do with whatever is going on. You can stop doing things. You
The sensation he feels when Draco touches the back of his neck is unlike anything he’s ever known, and yet familiar at the same time―it’s the prickle of electricity, the bitter tang of magic in the back of the throat, static shooting up his neck and down between his ribs and thighs.
Draco’s frown is anything but. “Hang on, so this is common, then? People getting pinged by passing stars?”
"Fine, I’m just." Potter’s voice is irritated but he goes on anyway. "I’m looking for something, an answer I need, and the person or people who might know it. Or…" Potter shrugs his shoulders. "Who might know where I should look next. That’s it." Potter’s tone is final. "That’s all you’re getting, Malfoy."
Even so, Draco’s immensely glad to do it. He wants to help Potter. He wants to be useful to Potter, to offer him something. Draco has always wanted Potter’s attention and for it to be
“Sexy,” Harry interrupted, ignoring the amused lilt of Draco’s voice. “I look sexy and like you wanna come in me.”
―  that spot that make him see stars. He dug one heel into Draco’s arse, gripped the pillow underneath his head tight as he tried to focus on the feeling of Draco’s cock as it pistoned into him again and again, on the way his balls felt as they slapped against his arse ― and on not bloody coming. Harry groaned, curling his toes and feeling his mouth drop open on a low grunt as Draco leaned down close, hitching one of Harry’s legs up around his waist and curling his fingers around Harry’s knee.
He thinks about changing it, then doesn't. He knows he should talk to Aggie, then he puts his phone on silent and his Floo on private lockdown instead. He watches a lot of telly, takes up knitting only to get fed up with it and give up, and then takes up watching his new ginger cat friend annihilate the poor attempt at knitting, which is much more fun.
"Draco thinks I should write my autobiography," Harry says once they’re settled. He sips his tea and makes a face when he gets a mouth full of leaves. Fucking worst strainer in England.
There’s a figure in the corner of his room. Draco knows it’s there even though he can barely see it. He has the feeling of being watched, can make out the shine of eyes. The room is pitch black, the kind of dark that only comes from deep night. That’s what clues Draco in to this being a dream. Night time is when he ventures out, when the streets are his to prowl. This dark room, and those shining eyes in the figure’s face, are therefore creatures conjured of his mind. At least, conjured from
"This is my house," Harry says, but it sounds like a question. He takes in the table setting, the cups placed neatly on his recently tidied table. He has no idea how long Draco has been here waiting for him. He feels infinitely worse at the sight of the tea things, the brewed pot and the terrible strainer and his chipped china. Bad news is always delivered with a cup of tea. Harry swallows, wiping his sweating palms on his jeans.
“Let’s shower,” Draco kisses Harry on the lips this time, “and then go and take this wretched potion,” another kiss, “and then see what sex is like without any bonds involved. I’d like to see what it’s like to have you inside me without also having you inside my head,” he whispers against Harry’s lips.
Harry huffs out a breath, another half laugh of a sound. The heat is ebbing away from his face, thank god. “Okay, let me rephrase that, then. You think waking up to
Draco moans, as affected as Harry, if not more so. He pulls back and flicks his head to the side, shaking his hair away from his eyes. Harry's mouth feels strange and empty. He sucks on his lower lip to try and sate the feeling.
The giddy swell peaks, plateaus, then absolutely splats when he goes through the dizzying emotions of receiving and then reading Draco's first text to him.
Potter chooses the club, and Draco doesn't argue. There's a fever bubbling beneath Potter's skin, Draco can tell. He's been in Potter’s shoes before, when the sudden feeling of the rug being swept out from under previously sturdy and hopeful feet, leaves one reeling. At least he thinks this is how Potter is feeling. Potter hasn't divulged what happened, or what
Harry’s cheek hits the freezing ground, glasses tumbling off, as his conscious flickers out with it.
"Oh, hardly." Draco makes a face as though he’s smelt something unpleasant. "How crass. No, keep your gold, Potter," he says dismissively.
"I lied." Harry smiles sweetly, and Agatha laughs, loud and genuine. He doesn’t think his story is actually crap, but he doesn't want to show her anyway. He’s weirdly fond of it, especially after he added more to it last night. It’s almost a proper story, now, and it’s still not what Harry is meant to be doing, but he’s having an odd amount of fun writing Harvey and Derek rescue Martha from the evil gnomes in his garden.
But the mood swings, and the huge belly, the weird stares from people who couldn't understand why on earth he had suddenly ballooned, and the articles in the Prophet about how the baby wasn’t really Draco’s and was the result of a torrid affair Harry was having with Ron ―  well, Harry could cope with all of those things just fine. Better than Ron and Draco were coping with the last one, even, though it had caused some impromptu outraged bonding between them, while Harry and an equally pregnant Hermione bonded with a few bowls of ice cream on the sofa. And then a pack of Ferrero Rochers. And then about six Curly Wurlies.
Draco rests his hands over the tops of Harry’s thighs, then lays his cheek against it, watching Harry back with the same tired, fond expression Harry’s sure is on his own face. The lamplight casts shadows in the dips of Draco’s cheeks, under his collarbone and ribs. It should be haunting, perhaps, but his face looks so deeply satisfied, so calm. Harry can’t look away.
Rather than throw a jab back to Harry, as he would normally do when Harry points out that Draco likes a lie in, Draco stays quiet instead. After a moment, he extends the parchment he’s holding out towards Harry. “We’ve had an owl.”
Harry pushed his hair away from his sweaty forehead as he canted his hips up higher, feeling Draco slip in deeper and hit ―
The barman raises one eyebrow. "Oh?" He leans closer, intimidating in his unexpected proximity. "Do you really, now?"
This time Draco’s laugh ended on a groan. “God, you’re ridiculous.” Draco thrust in hard, then stayed there, rolling his hips before pulling back and picking up the pace again. Harry managed a strangled “Mmhmm”, before he shut his eyes, breathing out harshly through his nose and trying to get a grip. He was meant to be making Draco come first, not getting off himself, bloody hell. Fat lot of good it would be with both of them having taken the potion if Harry blew his load before he even got Draco on his stomach, and
,” Harry repeats, wiggling his toes, encased as they are in thick woollen socks, and leather boots. “Everything looks the same, all flat and miserable.”
As he orders a Negroni, Draco contemplates a third factor which also seems likely given their respective location—Harry Potter is either looking for Dark creatures, or he is one himself.
Draco's thumb rubbed back and forth at the base of Harry's stomach, just under the swell of his belly. There would be a scar there soon enough, in about four months time. A scar and a house full of noise and sleep deprivation, mess and chaos and promise and hope. Harry couldn't wait. He knew the Healers could probably get rid of the scar too, or cover it up, but he found he didn't mind the prospect of it being there to stay. He had had worse, in his life, and he was okay with ending up with this one.
“Oh, you can fuck me,” Draco lifted his hips to emphasise the point. “In fact, I insist on it. But the job’s done.”
It felt like a friendship was inevitable after that night, Harry seeing Draco at his probable worst and Draco in turn not reacting badly to this. As fighting a troll forged a bond between Harry, Hermione and Ron, so did holding Draco's hair out of his face while he upchucked make Harry warm to him a surprising amount. Fatherhood suited him, and hanging out with Draco suited Harry. The fancying part came later, and was inconvenient but not the end of the world. There are times, even, when Harry wonders if it would be so bad to just tell Draco he likes him, that Draco wouldn’t mind or that he already even knows. Draco certainly gets a kick out of talking about made-up trysts they've had.
“Fuck, I’m close.” Draco’s palms skidded against the sheets, hair falling over his eyes as he dropped to his elbows.
“Yes.” Draco sniffs, then rests his elbow on his knee and his chin on his hands. “There’s something about this place, isn’t there,” he finishes quietly, his words trailing off into not-quite-a-question. “It’s eerie.”
. It's been a while since he had sex, but it's not been a while since he's tugged himself off. There's no reason for it to have been so intense.
Beside him, Draco hasn’t said a word, and that more than anything sets Harry on edge. He wants to ask him if he’s seeing what Harry’s seeing, if his ears are ringing too― if Draco too can feel the low, rumbling
“Oh, good. That’s nice of you,” Draco says. Harry honestly can't tell if he's being sincere or snarky at this stage.
“Always,” replies Harry easily. Draco seems off this morning, awkward. Harry wonders if the past evening and bad sleep is perhaps hitting him harder than it is Harry. He sits down, his chair magically tucking itself in behind him. A white napkin unfolds itself from the table setting and lays itself down gently across his lap.
“Check the time yourself, you lazy sod. There’s a clock on the wall just there.” Draco raises his eyebrows and nods, pointing in the direction of the clock with the rolled up parchment.
in his gut that isn’t related to his cock, that comes from a hunger more primal, and infinitely more deadly. The blood that pumps in his veins is flush with dark particles, whatever it is that makes a vampire tick and keeps him hungry for human blood. Draco won’t give in to that. Of all the things in this world, this he can say with complete confidence and conviction.
Draco properly wakes in the dim light of evening, but the dream lingers. Draco has no explanation for it. He doesn’t really search for one either. Not yet.
The Healer leans back in his chair then taps the feathered end of the quill against the small ink jar nearby. His mouth twists pensively. “Because there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” he quotes.
"Hardly." Draco resists the urge to scoff, levelling Potter with a pointed look instead. "She's not exactly my type."
"I trust you," Potter replies. It's equally as stunning as Draco's blurted thanks, and ten times as unexpected. Draco doesn't know how to react. He thinks maybe it's just lip service but Potter's face looks sincere, serious. The words hit Draco hard and potent. He wants to be worth that trust, however deeply Potter means it. Draco thinks it must be quite a bit; Potter doesn't strike Draco as someone who trusts on a whim.
"Let's get some fresh air," Potter suggests in a rough voice, and Draco nods, kissing his flushed and full lips one last time before they leave.
Draco pointedly eyes Harry’s short, cropped hair. Harry runs a hand over the familiar blunt strands. Draco’s eyes are smiling, and he can see there’s no barbs in the comment, which is welcome. He’s been shaving his hair short for at least four years now, and it's been a while since someone implored him to grow it back.
Potter’s lips are soft, and his mouth tastes like mint. It’s the same spell Draco uses for his teeth in the evening, the familiar taste strange when it’s on the other end of a kiss. Potter is eager and subdued at the same time, kissing Draco back with a pace so much slower than the frenzied rush that hit them earlier in the club. It’s no less heady, though. They kiss lazily, for long, slow moments as things heat up between them. The build of pleasure in Draco’s gut as he presses up against Potter’s lean body is maddening, made all the more sharp for the slow way they move. It’s tantalising and comforting in a way, taking their time to bring each other to the edge. Draco feels his cock thickening with each grind against Potter, the corresponding hardness he feels between Potters legs spurring him on. Potter sucks on Draco's tongue, on his lower lip. He rolls their hips together, creating as dirty a rhythm as the one in the club, but which feels infinitely filthier in the quiet, dark intimacy of Draco's bed.
