"I can feel it...your drawing the magic to you even from me. Oh it's so terrifying, but exhilarating. You could kill me right now if you wanted to, but I know you won't do that." He said energized just talking about me. I felt like I had the world's greatest hype man and I couldn't help but smile.
"Why would you need to work? He makes more than enough money for you to never have to lift a finger your entire life." She said as if she thought I was daft.
"I am nothing like him." I said defensively. He quirked an eyebrow to this.
When I entered his throne room I immediately bowed down kneeling at his feet and kissing the hem of his robe obediently hoping tonight wouldn't be another bad one.
"Funny how it actually ended up being true." He said with a smirk.
“You deliberately disobeyed me. If you want to be dark I can take you to the Dark Lord and you can feel the pain that comes with going to his side. Did you not see what he did to me?” I yelled, grabbing another book and throwing it at her. She leapt up to doge it and was still grinning not seeming terrified of me. I growled and stalked to her wanting to put the fear of God in her. I couldn’t lose her. I would do anything to not lose her, even if she hated me for it.
“I just wanted to make sure you didn’t have dibs on him or something. I know last year both Ron and him tried their chances with you. And I know you told them no but…”
"She hasn't commented. I think she just assumes I have some sort of special skill." I said with a sarcastic chuckle.
"It's funny how Dumbledore always gets credit for being the leader of the light, when we both know he's only shades better than Voldemort and who the real hero has been this whole time." He said thoughtfully brushing off his old ragged robes absently. My glare narrowed.
"Miss. Granger, I needed to make sure you weren't practicing the dark arts." I said making sure not to use her first name and anger her more. She huffed. astonished I would be so bold.
"Exactly Severus. What else does she need? There's no point in her remaining a student here. It will only cause unwanted drama. She can stay as a teachers apprentice or something." The Headmaster said patiently as if I were a five year old. I tapped my fingers on the chair seething.
It was Helga Hufflepuff's goblet.
"I'm...I'm not sure..." Hermione said, confused rubbing her head. Poppy fussed her over instantly running a whole host of spells while giving me a spare glare when she had a second.
"What the fuck Minerva!" I yelled trying to get away from her. She chased me around the headmaster's desk, her old features overrun with anger.
"How many order members died?" I asked quietly. He gave me a confused look.
“Great. Leave it on my desk.” Snape snapped pulling me back to him ready to finish what we started. He raised a hand to cast the spells around us again, but the headmaster stopped him.
"I'll take your word for it. Whatever you want, take it." He said feeding me French toast apparently serious about his desire to fatten me up. I smiled, shaking my head.
Curse pain relief
"It would make sense. I don't know of very many empath's that didn't turn evil though. I don't think its something you should exactly hope for. My father told me some stories about a few growing up. Nasty endings to all of the tales." He explained slowly considering the ramifications of if it were true.
"Expecting anyone?" I asked, stiffening a bit realizing they were aurors catching sight of the medallion on their coats. One was a tall thick dark man, and the other quite skinny with his wand already out ready for a fight.
"Do you ever hear yourself? The Dark Lord? What, are you joining his side or something? Ron was right about you all this time." She said disgustedly. I hadn't even noticed my slip. Apparently I was really spending too much time with Snape. She turned on her heels and stomped off before I could stop her.
“I may be a mudblood, but at least I know penough to put the mandrake root in AFTER the unicorn tears to remove the effects of the cruciatis curse.” I said softly finally bringing my eyes up to meet his after gathering my strength. He had made a comment two classes prior about the current potions for that specific curse being so mild you didn’t even bother using them. The original formula was one of his own izealnvention so I knew the insult burned like a hot knife.
"No. Harry, please..." I said crying instantly, my heart entirely crushed and I fell over him desperate for him to live.
"Of course."
He pulled away, panting slightly out of breath, but smiling enjoying himself quite a lot it seemed.
"Of course. If you had the chance to stop time, wouldn't you?" He asked me seriously, stopping under a tree that was bare in the cold winter, but still gave us a good relaxing spot in the winter. He cast a wandless warming spell and sat down with me.
"If I didn't care for you, you would not have any clothes left and I would be deep in you making you scream in pleasure." He said, his dark eyes grazing over me in a way that suggested he was ready to do exactly that.
“Any’on have an idea what this is?” He asked the crowd. The girls were cooing at baby bird excitedly and were hardly paying attention.
"Say what you want, but justice has been served. I did what you were too cowardly to do. Not that it didn't suit my needs as well. The Dark Lord was pleased I killed a disgusting squib and the Headmaster was pleased I killed a child abuser. I couldn't thank you enough for your lack of action actually. Its served me perfectly. Now...if you don't mind I must be back to Hogwarts. I have things to attend to." He said with a smirk getting up to leave. The Aurors immediately had their wands drawn and pointed at both of us. He chuckled sourly.
It misbehaved and would leap up from my fingers when I didn’t want it to and somehow I got the sense it was amused. I could see the light blue wisps of energy fluttering around me randomly. When I passed Dobby in the halls it vanished seeming to understand it couldn’t show itself to others. Much like Snape. He seemed so different when it was just him and. I.
"Oh shut up woman. The only reason you didn't die too was because I didn't want to leave Elijah an orphan. I picked the worst of the two evils to eliminate. You stood by while your husband hurt your child and did nothing." Severus said darkly, the coldness in his tone silencing her and making her drawback afraid.
Could he though? It was almost as if Malfoy Sr. knew I would be there. I didn't know how, but he didn't seem that surprised to see me. Snape seemed genuinely surprised to see him, but even Voldemort seemed only mildly shocked at my presence. Almost as if he was waiting for me.
It wasn't my fault Lucius had kissed me, it took two other people holding me down for him to even get that. He was a selfish bastard and I needed to stop forgetting that. This was all a game to him after all.
What happened and why does he look so upset?
“Is it though?” I said with a dark grin. He wasn’t scared of me like most of the teachers. Unfortunately. He just rolled his eyes at my comment.
I spent all day trying to get her out of my mind. I was just relieved it was Friday so I wouldn’t have to see her for a few days. I needed to clear my mind and get my bearings before I did something I would regret with her.
“I knew they weren’t done with me. Why won’t anyone tell me what his plans are since they clearly involve me.” I said a bit annoyed at being left out again.
“I…I…Ron will you let go?” I stammered unable to do it. It was messed up, but there were feelings there much to my dismay. He smiled sarcastically and shook his head.
I knew it was Tom Riddle. Without a doubt.
"STOP." The Dark Lord yelled at last ending the onslaught. He parted his ranks stepping forward seeing Harry and I in the circle.
“You remind me so much of my granddaughter. Your hair has those same curls and all. What are you doing here alone?” She asked curiously. I smiled with an ironic snicker.
"Ah, Tom. We meet again. I wish it was under better circumstances of course, but it seems like you have something of mine." The Headmaster said calmly coming in flowing purple and silver robes looking quite dramatic in the seas of blackness from the death eaters.
"It's a horcrux." I said dropping the pocket watch to the table, the dark magic overpowering even just to touch for a few moments. He laughed at this and went back to his cooking.
"Oh, but I do. I have you." He said standing up stalking to me dangerously. I didn't fear many things in life, but I felt more than a twinge of fear piecing together where this was going.
“Yes, well apparently calling her a shrew who couldn’t even keep a bee's attention got to her. She’s quite sensitive.” Minerva explained.
I was hoping for another dinner, but the second he donned his death eater mask, I knew I wouldn't be so lucky. He didn't seem worried about what would happen so I tried to relax, but I also knew he was just annoyed I had walked out on him last time we talked and skipped classes.
“Kill me for failing your plans, but don’t touch her. If you kill me, you are promising me that.” The magic I knew would protect her. A life for a life. It was what had protected Harry when his mother gave her life. It was ancient and dark magic, but it was what I needed to save her.
"Of course you were. Now though…my family is very traditional. I don't think they could accept…" He said unable to actually finish the sentence due to his immaturity assuming we had gone further than we had. I rounded on him fast not in the mood to deal with his crap.
“That’s meant to be dosed at a tablespoon per ten minuets under the cruciatis curse.” I told him breaking the silence. He raised an eyebrow to me.
I sat down and watched her work for a solid hour trying to get her stable. Finally at last Hermione gasped suddenly and her eyes fluttered open. I let out a breath of relief glad I hadn't killed her with my idiocy.
“He wanted to know why the feeling of her magic was weaker around me, not stronger. He was unpleased.” I explained not wanting to go into detail about the hour of torture I endured. The headmaster nodded understanding. He got up and poured some bourbon in my drink for me.
"The Dark Lord will not accept the excuse 'I am busy Granger'." He whispered quietly, his black eyes lighting up with a fire I had become well accustomed to.
I knew Snape had told me to refuse, but I didn't know if I was willing to trust that. If I refused, the Dark Lord would undoubtedly kill me, finding me not useful anymore. If I gave in, I was risking the entire collapse of society. The options were exceptionally dim for me.
"Ah, look! Severus's pet has lost its way." Lucius said, finding me with his gang of cronies quite drunk if his stumbling was any indicator. I felt my breath hitch knowing this was trouble.
“Fine. Go ahead. Make it quick though.” I said reluctantly slowing down my pace of walking so he didn’t have to race to keep up.
I felt a cold shiver run through my body walking closer to the smiling manic watching us with glee.
“What the…”
I sighed closing the book on Horcruxs exhausted and my mind overwhelmed. It was a lot to consider after a long sleepless night and I knew Snape would be up shortly.
“Oh gosh.” I mumbled to myself blushing thankful when she left me alone in the middle of the books again. I sighed looking at all the options trying to find one that would suit my needs. I had read most of them, or at least glanced through them and decided they weren’t worth it.
Nick pushed Draco onto the bed, crawling up on top of him, his hands unbuckling Draco’s belt as his mouth bit at his neck. Draco threw his head back to give him more access, his eyes rolling back into his head in contentment. He felt hands pull off his pants, he leaned slightly forward and slipped his shirt off his back, tossing it to the side of the bed. It was his turn to be teased, he could see the mischievous glint in Nick as he slowed down their pace, placing slow kisses as he trailed down. Draco groaned in frustration, his cock twitching at the thought of being touched. Nick came back up, their faces inches apart as he reached a finger down to the rim of Draco’s ass, watching his face as Draco moaned, leaving harsh scratches down Nick’s back. The cold finger pressed gently against the entrance, slipping in slowly as Draco squirmed at the feeling.
Harry complied, despite his frustrated look. Draco wasn’t sure what had gotten him all pissed but he was not in the state to deal with an angsty Potter. He quickly made the pancakes, each of them glazed in a perfectly golden crust, and set them onto two plates for the pair of them to eat. He figured if he fed Harry it might have made him a little less aggressive and on edge.
He began to saute the ingredients over the stove, his patience growing thin in desperation to leave Harry as soon as possible. What was one a bearable harmony in between them has quickly turned into a suffocating prison that he was subjected to.
“Hard not to”
“You have no idea” Draco sighed, gulping down the rest of his drink and setting the glass on the floor beside him. He watched Harry, inching over closer to where he was standing. He knew he was far drunker than he was, taking comfort in knowing that even if he did something he would later regret he could always blame it on the alcohol.
The wedding was just a week away and Draco had been desperately clinging onto each day, hoping it wouldn’t pass on to the next. Having to go and be happy for Noah when he in reality quite resented him for having to face his emotions and on top of that, be rejected, was not something he was looking forward to. Although the last few months have been difficult, a flurry of strange men in his bed and too many times Aaron has had to come to his aid to get him out of his alcohol binging. Luckily, for the most part, that was a thing of the past. Apart from a few gruesome nights where he catches himself slipping back into those habits, he has been mostly healed from the incident. He knew it would still hurt being at the wedding and seeing him and Aurora live out their happy ever after - if it can even be called that considering all the things Noah is keeping from her - but they were friends first and good friends come to each other's weddings. So he had RSVP’d and was dreading the day.
“Thanks so much for having us.” Harry said, grinning from ear to ear.
“I did mean it by the way. What I said last night? It wasn’t just cause I was really drunk or anything.” Harry said, his hand tugging at his hair lightly.
Once he got home he was greeted with even more small talk from Harry, nothing like the conversations they used to have, and nothing that satisfied his needs for companionship.
“I don’t know. Being vulnerable, I guess.” Draco didn’t know how to reply. Although they had often had late night conversations where they talked about a plethora of things, they had never gotten into the inner workings of Harry’s mind, he was always too closed off to share.
Hope you enjoy! Let me know how you're enjoying it so far :)
As the door shut behind them and they made their way down to the taxi, the silence was comfortable in between them.
The concierge at his building eyed him suspiciously as he stumbled in through the front doors of his apartment building. Most likely reeking of alcohol and looking more than disheveled. He took the elevator up, enjoying the quiet jazz ambience music that played on his way up. As he stepped out, he turned the corner, eyes barely open and head rolling back, one placing itself lazily in front of the other. He reached his door, seeing the door slightly agape. Draco straightened up almost immediately, reaching for his wand and having it out in defence. He pushed the door slowly, it creaking slightly from the rusty hardware. He cast lumos, as he aged, his need to say easier spells out loud decreased with his strength. The light cascaded over his apartment, revealing a violent raiding. Nearly every drawer open, his belongings scattered across the area, glass broken, and furniture ripped. He walked further into the apartment, still on edge, unsure if whoever it was that did this was still there. The rest of his space was just as battered up. Draco made sure to check all the rooms and anywhere that someone could be hidden before letting the extent of the damage finally settle in.
“It was all 11 year old me could muster, and after a while I just had to stick to it. Couldn’t be going around being nice to Harry Potter all of a sudden could I?”
The location was gorgeous, it was held at an old rustic barn, aged with vines and worn out wood. They had candles as ambient lighting and a general bohemian feel to the wedding. It was all very romantic and quite not the place to go alone. Draco felt awkward and out of place. Luckily, he spotted Marie and Oliver at a nearby table and went to greet them, glad he could have some sort of buffer at the event so he didn’t have to seem lonely for too long. He walked over to the couple with a wide grin, it had been a couple months since they got together at the restaurant and he missed their presence. Marie embraced Draco largely and gave him a tight squeeze, and Oliver followed, both of them eager to catch up with him.
The walk was cold but not unbearable, it's hard for even the most mundane tasks to not be romanticized simply by his presence in Italy. He walked slow and leisurely, taking deep breaths of the fresh forest air, following a man-made path from what must have been years of continuous walks amongst the same ground.
“Are you serious?” He snapped, his eyebrows furrowing in anger.
“I know. Trust me. I just didn’t know what else to do. I should’ve never slept with him.” Harry sighed, his head rolling back in desperation.
He was unsure why seeing Potter after so long had this effect on him, he couldn’t have cared less if Potter was in his presence when they were in school, so why did it matter now? He stared at Aaron to find a glimpse of explanation in his eyes. Draco had never paid attention much to how Aaron presented himself, sure he was a fair bloke, he had dirty blonde hair and a solid body on him, but nothing that Draco would ever see as more than platonic. He was grateful for this as he was not one to shit where he ate. His mind wandered back to Potter. Draco noticed this and put it to a stop, this was the last thing he needed. He thought he was rid of the prick back when he left Hogwarts, and having him in his life again, whether in his head or in reality, was not something he was eager to repeat.
Draco slyly stood up from his hiding spot, brushing off his shirt from dust, and giving Harry a warm smile.
“You know what? I don’t even care that you knew before me, I understand. But I asked you, I asked you if you knew specifically and you lied to my face!” Draco said, tears now streaming down his face.
“So, you never did tell us Draco, have you met anyone? It’s been three months since we’ve last got together like this, surely you must be on the lookout” said Marie. Easy for her to ask, she’s been with Oliver since her school days and had never really had to date.
It was Friday in the late afternoon, the weather was grey and gloomy, a perfect scenery for Draco’s depressive slump. Harry was about to get home soon, his shifts at work seemed shorter than usual this week, Draco considered this might have been because of him but he knew better. Although they were friends now, he doubted Harry would go as far as cutting work shifts short for his well being.
He unraveled the paper of the gift, underneath revealing a dark wooden box with golden latches at its front. Draco glimpsed up at Harry curiously who simply encouraged him to keep going, he unclipped the latches, lifting up the top of the box to reveal a large handcrafted cooking set. It was filled with a plethora of different cooking supplies, and paired with a cookbook from one of the most famous wizard chefs, which was signed to Draco.
“Do you want one?” he asked as he offered the box to Potter.
Draco changed into a pair of casual sleep clothes that were left for him on the bed, the clothes hung loosely around his body, as he was a little shorter than Aaron. He unraveled into the bed, sleep becoming him nearly as soon as he hit the pillow.
“Draco?” Harry said, eager to get his opinion on this.
“As we all most likely know, Draco Malfoy’s apartment was recently raided.” A couple of murmurs travelled in between the aurors, quickly put to a hush as Marvin continued.
How do you guys like reading the same situation but from both POV's? I'm also going to be done my semester in 2 weeks and after that my updates should be more frequent (2-3 times a week!)
Once Harry took his respective seat next to Draco, cozying up his knees just under him so he was compacted into a ball, he cast a quick spell and a somewhat large box wrapped in festive paper made its way down the stairs and under the tree. Draco gave him a disapproving look.
“Ok. My turn” Draco said, suddenly filled with nervous excitement for Harry to open his gift. He grabbed the envelope and placed it in front of Harry’s lap.
Once they had left, Harry and Draco went back to the dining room, cleaning up the remnants of their night, several wine bottles and enough empty plates of food to fill up their sink. There was an unspoken comfort in between them, both of them full with food and fuzzy with wine, the cool breeze still floating in from the agape balcony door. Draco thought about kissing Harry. Not in a sexual way, or even in a romantic way. He just wanted to express his liking towards him, somewhere in between friends and lovers. They always fell somewhere in between. Instead he brushed the hair off of Harry’s face, an act that was no more innocent than a kiss.
By the time it was evening, and they were all getting ready to go out to a small club in the town, the silence in Harry and Draco’s room was thick and pressing, both of them feeling the tension in their chest.
“Of course.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He unlocked the door, stumbling into the front entrance, he hadn’t realized how hungry he was until he was welcomed by the smell of pancakes and coffee. He followed the smell, desperate for any sort of nutrition, his sunglasses still on to deflect the light away from his burning eyes. Stepping into the kitchen, he was greeted by a bed-head Harry Potter, whistling quietly as he flipped burning pancakes over on the pan, fuck, he muttered to himself, throwing another one into the garbage. Draco leaned against a wall with his arms crossed, watching Harry attempt to cook. It was all very amusing.
"Severus, I hope there's a good reason for Christmas dinner being interrupted today?" The judge said with a drawn out sigh, rubbing the temple of his forehead annoyed.
"Don't think such things." He admonished me gently. I turned around in his arms angrily.
“Well of course old man. Who else? I’m supposed to be making her bond with me, and she’s over there kissing Weasley! Its unfathomable what she sees in that redheaded, stubborn, self-centered fool. Don’t get me wrong. I know I’m not personable. I’m good looking though and she was eating out of the palm of my hands. She was so into it…then she goes around and kisses him! I swear she did it just to make me angry.” I ranted until I felt the anger starting to lessen up and I plopped down in the chair opposite of the headmaster.
"You're more like him than you realize." Severus said, evenly taking a long drink of his wine. It was my turn to be surprised.
"I'm not sure what you mean." I said shaking my head. His jaw quite literally dropped open.
"I don't think that will be necessary. Severus was right behind me, he should be here any moment." I didn't have time to process what he said. The doors banged open to the hospital ward and Severus came in calmly, his eyes locking with mine immediately.
“Clearly.” He waved his hand and in seconds my potion in the cauldron was in glass bottles and stacked quite nicely on one of the shelves with its own label.
"No offense…but your boring. Its not like I'm going to tell him you guys are studying spells to defeat him. Not to mention he couldn't stop you even if he tried. He has given up on his whole kill Potter idea and has moved onto way to slowly drive you to insanity I think." Draco said musing the insane man's decisions as if he were a logical being.
"Please don't tell anyone. Harry would be...I can't let him know I failed." I said horrified at the very thought. He had been lost in thought, but his snake like eyes flickered back to me, his smile returning.
“I’m well aware.” He had finished half the bottle.
I finished studying the effects of magical exhaustion in my Magical Healing Properties book I was studying and headed to the common room. The halls were empty and silent even though I was heading back before curfew, which was unusual for me.
“Goodnight Miss. Granger.” He said dismissing me. I wanted to stay and see where this was headed, but whatever direction things had started to head was clearly gone. I left quietly walking back to my rooms toying with the magic I could feel swirl around me teasingly.
I vaguely heard Poppy fussing over me and several calming spells being cast on me until I finally stopped sobbing, my emotions held back by her spells.
“Severus!” The headmaster came in the otherwise empty library calling for Snape unable to see him until Snape unwillingly waved his hand dropping his charms around us.
“Are you okay? You have something on your mind.” He said more of a statement than a question. I hated people prying into my business.
"OW!" I moaned relieved he at least was alive. He pulled back realizing my pain instantly handing me a bottle of my own pain relieving potion.
Elijah was standing there, his eyes wide having witnessed me question her about her loyalties and me hug her. It was entirely inappropriate and was not allowed by any means. I wasn't scared of being fired, I was untouchable legally, but I knew she would be devastated if word got out. Judging by the way she rushed past him looking down, she was already embarrassed. She wouldn't want anyone to know she had feelings for someone like me, I was sure of it.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea. She’s underage.” Snape said sneering down at me in despise.
It was almost worth the torture. Almost.
"Let's do it."
“Well, well. Look what we have here! Severus, you have yourself a little toy and you didn’t even offer to share?” Lucius said stalking around Snape and to me eagerly taking in my disheveled appearing and assuming the worst. I glared at him and struggled back to my feet refusing to let him tower over me. I was just over five foot so he was unfortunately still towering over me, but I felt better at least.
“I’m pretty sure this is my dream actually.” She said bemused. She looked me up and down. I was wearing a muggle style suit, Italian made with gold cuffs. It wasn’t my style, but she seemed to like it.
I wore a simple black dress that was thick and lined with wool. The white pearl buttons gave it a classic feel, the soft material hugging my curves quite nicely without being provocative. I didn't want to risk Lucius coming after me again.
“Snape’s in trouble I think.” I said hoping he didn’t blow up. He just nodded.
“Your blood pressure is dangerously high. You need to take tomorrow off and just sleep.” I advised him uncorking the potion for him. He just grinned childishly.
I could feel her light magic swirling with mine, an addictive substance that seemed so different from mine that its presence couldn’t be denied.
"He...he made you dinner?...but why?...wait...were the rumors true? I thought I just picked up on a cute bonding moment but I kind of wondered..." She trailed off excitedly.
I hadn't expected it to be that fucking good. It was devilish and now I understood why people thought it was so taboo. To feel such immeasurable pleasure and indulge in it was quite evil in itself.
We walked silently through the halls and I slowly woke fully up. I was curious why he was already in full death eater robes, but I didn't question it too much and risk angering him.
“Does that mean were done with class today then? I have some studying to do.” Harry asked excited at the prospect of ending early. The only studying he had planned was exploring the inside of Draco’s mouth.
“I think the bonding has started.” I said looking to him just to get my eyes off her.
A hand slammed on the desk inches from my book and I jumped up shocked. Speaking of death eaters.
"How are you alive?" I asked, having no idea how he managed to survive the killing curse.
The water poured over me cleansing me and washing away his scent just to be replaced by my lavender body wash scent. I needed a sense of normality back. When I was done I stopped in front of the mirror since I was alone looking at myself almost fascinated. He had left bruises on my hips and arm from where he had me roughly. I traced a finger over the sensitive skin and closed my eyes replaying the scenes in my head repeatedly. It wasn't necessarily a bad feeling that replaying the memories brought back.
I went deeper in her mind scrolling through flashes of memories that I shouldn't be seeing. She had no defenses and was an open book. Thousands of memories of Potter, Ron, and Draco surfaced swishing past me so fast I couldn't grasp any of them. That's not what I was looking for anyways. I got to the memories from earlier today in defense against the dark arts and pulled them to the front for me to see.
“I…I was with the Dark Lord. Now I’m here though and I don’t want to go. Ever. I want to stay here, with you!” I announced twirling her around, her light dress flying up a bit. She smiled with a small giggle, but then her seriousness returned.
"If people want to talk. Let them talk. They can arrest me. I haven't broken any laws. Even if I did, I would just buy my way out of it. It would be worth every cent." I said coldly not ready to negotiate on this. I expected him to argue more and refuse to give in, but to my surprise he sat back with a genuine smile.
I couldn’t do such a thing. Ask him to kiss me? I didn’t want him to kiss me. That’s was preposterous. Insanity. Yet the way his breath tickled my cheek, his fingers threading into my hair waiting…anticipating my request.
"Did it say anything about the bonding process?" I asked spinning a little gold wheel on the table absently.
"Meeting, she got quite cold." I said not wanting to go into details. The shame of my outburst weighed heavily on me and I would much rather blame the Dark Lord than myself.
“No.”
“Come on Severus. Up you go.” He said helping him to his feet seeming to understand his unspoken need. The walk to his rooms was silent and I couldn’t get there fast enough, ready to help him get healed. He was dirty and shaking so I knew the torture had to have gone on for some time. As soon as his room doors closed behind me I couldn’t resist and had to ask.
“I don’t know.” He said simply. He sent a patronus towards Snape’s rooms, but headed towards the front doors anyways. Seconds later his patronus was back shaking its head no.
"Well, not all of us can be as disorganized as you." I said playfully brushing out my hair. Since I had started to use hair straightening potion in my hair, it looked so much nicer. It still fell in curls around my face, but manageable loose curls.
"What have I told you about exhausting yourself in your state?" He said with more than a hint of his trademark annoyance. She folded her arms defiantly.
"I have a plan to keep both of you alive and safe. You just have to trust me. I know that's a lot to ask. Just know when I give you my word, I won't break it." He said carefully, choosing his words refusing to let me in enough to know what said plan was.
“Something on your mind?” The headmaster asked watching me carefully.
I woke up with a start sure I wasn't alone. Ginny had been rooming with some other girls after my kiss with Severus so I should have been the only one in the dark room, but I heard a small shuffle near the door.
"Hermione, why are you out at this time of night, surely you know what lurks in the darkness." Hagrid said good naturedly following us up to the castle.
Harry caught sight of me and came to me relieved. He was in his pajamas and his hair a right mess, but he was somehow adorable in his sleepy state.
“We really must stop meeting like this. You climbing on things…” A familiar silky voice said from behind me. I felt my blood run cold realizing I had been caught by him.
“My family had one. I couldn’t ever go near it.” Draco commented looking at me curiously and almost suspiciously like I was up to no good.
I sighed deeply, the day having taken a bad turn before it could even really start. By the time I had gotten to breakfast she had evidently told Ron who was glaring at me again, and Harry who seemed more concerned than angry. I didn't even bother sitting down, I grabbed a roll and left for my first class which was Herbology.
“Of course. No problem.” I said making him light up with excitement.
"Severus!" I cried falling to my knees horror flooding through me.
I poured over the dark texts feeling disgusted, but also intrigued by the horrid spells they contained. I had no idea the horrible thing humans could think of doing to each other, but it seemed the evil we dealt with nowadays was nowhere as bad as the cruelty that magic folk had back when magic was created.
"The Dark Lord required you to bond with me. I assumed this would be a one way street." He explained. I scoffed at him.
"He has tracers on the horcruxes. You can't destroy them until right before the battle, otherwise he will go on a death spiral and we won't be ready." He explained.
I didn't try to do an incantation like I normally did with my practices with Snape, but just let the feeling control the direction the magic was going. My magic seemed elated and swirled through my fingers and into him taking on the challenge I gave it with a pent up excitement. It was so natural and all this time I had been trying SO HARD to change the magic. I didn't realize I just had to relax and let it flow, directing it to my whim.
I could feel his breath behind me and his arms wound around me comforting me and pulling me to him. I heard him whisper some spells to give us some privacy, his voice calming despite my anger with him.
"Nothing. I think it's one of those things you will know when it happens. Or maybe not. I don't think I have read much on empaths since most of their history was scratched out when they were killed off." The headmaster said rubbing his temple showing an uncharacteristic sign of stress. I had to get her to Voldemort's side to save her life, but could I do it without turning her dark? If I bonded with her would she take on my darkness also? Would I be responsible for ruining her and bringing into civilization a dark being worse than Voldemort?
“Ron…I”
"Your right. I...I touched them." The cruciatus curse hit me hard, his anger intensifying the curse to an almost immeasurable degree. I curled down into myself holding back the scream that so desperately wanted to come out.
"YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT?" He screamed at the top of his lungs, his magic sparking around him with his loss of control. I took a deep breath trying not to panic and in a split second knew what my plan was. I looked up at him looking him in the eyes seeing the anger rolling across his contorted expression.
He said back possessively. He tipped my chin up to him and I felt my heart racing realizing he was going to kiss me. I closed my eyes waiting curiosity overwhelming me even in my pained state. When he didn’t kiss me immediately I opened my eyes back up wondering what was wrong. He was staring back down at me with a small smirk playing at his lips, his dark eyes filled with mirth.
"Miss. Granger!" The Headmaster said coming in, quite alive and well in stunning blue robes, the evidence of the battle quite nonexistent on him.
My mind reeled with what he said and I stood there in the office for what felt like forever. He knew Dumbledore wanted to replace the ministry, but how? Was he being honest? Was this all nothing more than two grown adults fighting over government control? Was magic really going to keep getting weaker until eventually it disappeared with mixing with muggles? The logic wasn't wrong.
"Am I not unstoppable if I stay light?" She asked me, tilting her head a bit confused and hurt by my logic. She was entirely right. She pulled herself from my arms and turned to leave stopping realizing we had been watched.
I was anticipating torture. Pain. Taunting. Not to just to be invited in to dinner like family.
"Yes, well I'm not the person you want to sneak up on." He said annoyed slightly turning back to the lake watching the waters calmly lap on the shore. I watched for a few moments with him surprised by how calm he seemed.
"Old dear Dumbledore has an empath right under his nose and didn't even know it. Not so brilliant now, is he? Brightest witch of our age. Except she's no ordinary witch. Her DNA is from an entirely different branch of witches and wizards that died out thousands of years ago. Or so I thought. It seems she somehow managed to get both copies of her families recessive genes." He said getting pleasure out of having one upped the headmaster.
I wasn't quite so cool about it. I felt tears welling up again. He sighed even more drastically whispering 'women dramatics' under his breath and gave me a hug.
"I think we better give them a few minutes." The Headmaster said with his characteristics twinkle in his eyes leaving us alone.
I couldn't admit to myself that I was lovesick over Snape. My thoughts continually went back to him though and I found myself crying more than a few times before taking a deep breath and throwing myself back into my studies.
"I got lost!" I said defensively taking a step back. He grabbed my arm roughly and dragged me down the hall towards the room everyone was in.
"I have a potions business." He said vaguely. I snorted in amusement.
The look in his eyes had been relief, like he could finally relax now that he had found me. Was it possible that he felt some sort of affection for me now that we shared magic?
"I didn't think you had done such a good job Severus. I was over here thinking you were a failure." The Dark Lord said surprised, his mood shifting incredibly fast realizing the dark was calling to me. This was what he wanted. An empath that was at his command, it was his ultimate dream realized.
“Draco, darling. You’re rambling.”
These patterns of unrequited affection in Draco’s life were taking a toll on him, and he didn’t have the energy to beg for proper attention from Harry Potter of all people. He would get through this just like he did with Noah. Begrudgingly and with a lot of alcohol.
On the walk to the club, they were split off into the same groups. Ron was blabbing about some case that he was deeply invested in, parading around a bottle of scotch as his companion. All that was on Harry’s mind was Draco. More specifically, he was growing angrier at the situation at large, displacing whatever guilt he felt towards hurting someone important to him with growing enraged at Draco for getting mad in the first place. It was an outrageous thought, he knew, and he also knew that he had no right to tell Draco how to react, but he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t know if it was the alcohol pulsing through his veins or his fear of failure but he was growing increasingly impatient.
“You’re drunk.” he replied, not sure what that had to do with anything but felt the need to point it out.
Draco considered what Harry was implying, but he had been so distant to him ever since that it was difficult to believe.
“I did not have a crush on Draco! Were you not there as we literally despised each other through all of school?” Harry said, feeling himself getting defensive.
“Hadn’t had one this bad since Noah’s wedding, and you know how that one went” Draco said, his eyes widening for dramatic effect. Harry felt a tinge of guilt pulling at his chest, he felt wrong for not telling him about his parents, he rationalized it by convincing himself it would make Draco’s mental health worse, not to mention Harry would lose his job.
“Is this?” Harry gasped, his eyes widening. A grin spread across Draco’s face and he nodded quickly.
“How have you been? I haven’t seen you in ages!” Harry said, immediately regretting his word choice. Obviously you haven’t seen him in ages you oaf, you bloody cheated on him.
“We had… a moment of sorts.” he sighed, meeting Aaron’s eyes for the first time. He continued to explain how he was in a deep depressive episode when Harry came home, leading to both of them getting drunker than necessary and nearly kissed on the balcony. He chose to leave out the part about him jacking off in the shower thinking about Potter, and more specifically while Potter was waiting outside of the door. He figured that would make him seem a little more interested than he actually was. He was just desperate for a shag. That’s all.
“Hi there, I’m Matt. Care if I buy you a drink?” he asked, his mouth in a cocky smirk. Harry mentally rolled his eyes.
He felt himself dancing, his hips grinding on another body, a hand wrapped around his waist, his head thrown back against a shoulder.
“Aurora and I are um.. actually engaged, she doesn’t know about us and I ask you not to tell her. I love her, you know, and I really wanna marry her.” There it was, the conversation that Draco had felt coming for a few months now but was hoping it would be something along the lines of I’m leaving her for you, not the other way around.
“You know what, Harry? You don’t have to worry about me anymore, alright? You don’t have to worry about whether we will be okay anymore or how you can fix us because there is no ‘us’ anymore. I’m done.” He spat, walking through the front door and slamming it shut.
“Well, after having to pick up your drunk ass off of the washroom floor in the middle of the night so many times, I figured I might do both of us a favour and make myself a key” replied Aaron, grabbing himself a water bottle from the fridge and sitting down onto the barstool.
Draco began getting up, placing money down on the table to cover both of their drinks.
Hermione pulled him into a swift yet tight hug.
“Wowww so fancy! Just what I expected from pompous Draco Malfoyy” Harry slurred, unable to give him a proper complement.
(See the end of the chapter for
They agreed to get ready and regroup downstairs in 10 minutes, which gave Harry just enough time for a quick body shower before they left.
That was all he needed to say for all of Draco’s inhibitions to fall, he pushed Harry off of him, taking his hand and bringing him into his room, unbuttoning his shirt as he walked.
He stumbled into the kitchen, his face flushing up as he felt the alcohol he had consumed begin to fully take its effect. Draco poured himself a glass of scotch, clumsily tilting it up to his mouth. He just had to be drunk when they had that conversation, if he had been sober he would have been able to brush off the news as if it was just another random engagement he couldn’t care less about. But with his emotions heightened, and the expectation of some sort of hook up between the two of them tonight, it stung all the more.
Casper was obscenely tall, having several inches on Draco. His hair was pitch black, with light grey eyes that were rimmed with blue. He had a kind look to his face, one that made everyone feel welcome in his presence. His hand was outstretched, daring Draco to greet it. He reached his hand forward, shaking his hand firmly. It became clear where he knew him from, he had seen him at Noah’s wedding, waiting for Harry after their talk. He had seemed more sulky then, although he didn’t dare get a good look at him then, in fear of seeming too interested in Harry’s life. Draco turned around, reaching for a coffee mug, uninterested in making small talk with the two aurors in the kitchen. Harry signaled to Casper, and they both started heading towards the door, shutting the door behind them, Draco was met with the deafening noise of silence.
Draco sat up out of his seat, finishing off the smoke before putting it out on an ashtray on the table, picking back up his Firewhiskey. He stumbled over next to Harry, tripping slightly but grabbing onto the railing to hold himself up.
Aaron knocked on the door, calling him out for the last shot before they headed out. Draco scurried to the door, kicking on a boot onto his foot. Aaron admired his pants on Draco’s frame, complimenting him on his appearance before leading him into the kitchen. They clicked their shot glasses together, before the burning liquid grazed the back of their throats. Draco had made a potion earlier in the night that allowed them to down the shots without the pungent aftertaste, which made drinking shitty alcohol much easier. They debated apparating to the club but decided to take a taxi instead, well, Aaron basically forced Draco too, concerned so as not to get dismembered on their way there.
“I swear he can never get tipsy, he has to blackout.” Hermione complained, sipping on wine with her other hand.
“Ron and Hermione are throwing a party at their place and we are going.” Harry said, his smile creeping up his face.
Eventually, they both fell asleep on the couch. Draco wished he had kissed Harry that night. He wished he had kissed him on multiple occasions. Although he knew that even if Harry was standing right in front of him now, he still wouldn’t do anything. He was too afraid of what that would mean for them, their relationship was too fragile, a vase made of thin glass that Draco was trying desperately not to drop.
This had got to be a new low for Harry, and boy, was he gut wrenchingly aware of it. It twisted his stomach to see who he had become, the old Gryffindor bravery was nowhere to be found. Instead, he was sitting across the building from a man he most likely loved while avoiding going home and not having the courage to go inside. How pathetic.
Draco was confused, as far as he knew, Aaron was never one to shy away from taking initiative.
“I don’t know what I was expecting but this was certainly not it.” Draco said slowly as he eyed the rest of the room. Taking in the wall of framed photos of him with Hermione and Ron, a few photos of Sirius and Lupin, and his parents in the centre.
“So Potter huh? Did not expect you to be starstruck by him” Aaron joked, pushing himself slightly into Draco.
Harry gave an awkward wave, clearly slightly annoyed by the hitch in their plan to undress each other as quickly as possible.
“So you didn’t kiss him? And that was all that happened? Just a kiss?” Harry asked, fidgeting with his fingers, not maintaining eye contact.
They waved over a waitress for another round of mimosas, laughing violently at stories from their youth, clearly causing a slight commotion at the bistro. They had fallen into an effortless banter, their legs touching underneath the table, a subtle hand on the wrist during conversation or an eye intently watching each other's every move.
A silence fell in between them, Harry had overstepped an invisible line that was drawn before them, like he always did. He always took what he wanted, in spite of the consequences.
“Merlin, don’t remind me. I am so embarrassed.” He groaned, rubbing his hands over his eyes to ease his discomfort.
Can't wait!
“I’ve barely opened my eyes and you’re already tugging me out of the most comfortable place on Earth. Do you know how cruel that is?” Harry said, throwing a disapproving glance towards Draco.
“Alright. I’m not sure it’s a good idea either. Conflict of interest or something like that” Aaron joked, his mouth barely upturned into a smile. Draco just nodded.
“Last I checked, the only groceries you have at your house is a bottle of year old ketchup in the fridge - if you think you can miraculously feed us both a meal with that said ketchup, be my guest.”
“What’s up between you and Noah? I saw him glaring at you like a lost puppy all night.” Potter asked between swigs of his smoke.
Harry nodded, “Yeah, I agree.” he let a moment pass before continuing.
They didn’t speak anymore, instead Aaron nodded his head in defeat, and turned to walk out the door. Before he left, he looked over his shoulder back at Draco, desperate for an interference, for Draco to beg him to stay, but after a few moments of nothingness, he dropped his head and closed the door.
“Oh. Yeah. Sure” Draco responds, still slightly in his head. He should really stop thinking about Harry like this, they had just started dating - or whatever it was that they were doing - and he didn’t want to put this much pressure on it. Certainly not you are my home pressure.
“Honest about what?”
“It’s fine, could you at least explain what’s going on?” Draco sighed as he placed his palm over his eyes. All of the exhaustion that he thought he had slept away coming back.
“Sorry about your chest.” Draco said, short of breath.
“Harry. You’re rambling” Draco chuckled as Harry’s cheeks blushed.
Draco kept his jacket on, stopping by the kitchen for a glass of water to relieve his scratchy throat before heading to the store. He heard a knock on the door. There was no one that he knew that would come badgering on his door at 3 in the morning, so he was hesitant to respond, staying silent to hope that whoever it was would think he was sleeping.
“I’m sure there are many places that would love to hire you, Potter. You’re not exactly just anybody.”
“Harry. What happened to only small gifts and nothing extravagant?” he asked, his eyes serious but his lips unable to keep themselves from forming into a slight smile.
Harry bobbed up and down the length expertly, Draco’s stomach formed in knots as he did. The warmth of his mouth around his cock turning him on more than he could imagine. The sight of Harry’s mouth around him was enough to make him cum on the spot.
“Cadmus! Don’t be a fool. Those Ministry pricks got to him before we did.” her voice was sharp, matching her appearance. It was deeper than Harry imagined, but still maintained an elegance to it. She had a disgusted look on her face, her eyes judging everything they fell upon.
Harry turned his head to look up at his face, missing this proximity between them. He gazed into his cool grey eyes, which were dilated with his pupils, he glanced at the soft pink of his lips. He nodded.
“Fine. I’ll go along with it if you really want.” Harry responded, as he pulled a jumper over his head.
Draco unbuttoned his shirt slightly as to give him more sex appeal, not like he needed it, he saw the looks that he was given by several of the men at the bar already. One of them had come up to him and offered to buy him a drink, he wasn’t exactly Draco’s type, but he wasn’t one to be picky at the moment.
“Happy Christmas, Harry” Draco responds, leaving a trail of kisses starting at his forehead and down to his chest, Harry pulling him into him and wrapping his body with his arms afterwards.
Even now, as Harry was walking into his office at work on a Saturday morning, his mind was riddled with images of the man he was desperately trying to avoid. Not even an hour ago he had ensured Draco that this was a one time occurrence, and although Draco looked convinced, Harry was still trying to push down any feelings that shouldn’t be present after a one night stand.
“I think it's you that doesn’t talk to me anymore, Harry.” he spoke coldly, his gaze falling off of Harry.
Harry withdrew eventually, making up an excuse about needing to get some rest before tomorrow, saying he had some big work event. He could tell that the man was pissed, probably thinking about what a waste of time this was and how he could’ve spent 8 pounds on a drink for someone who actually would have slept with him.
Draco simply sat himself on the opposite side of the couch, his demeanour cold and unwelcoming yet ravishingly attractive. He was acting as if Harry was an inconvenience he couldn’t wait to be rid of.
“Anyways, the Renovation headquarters have been seized, just last night actually -” It was at this point that Draco peeked his head into the room, throwing a warm smile towards Harry as he placed down a bowl of breakfast for Harry to enjoy. He walked over and placed a silent peck on Harry’s cheek, wrapping his arms around his waist. “And I cannot express my gratitude for your compliance enough, I know it must have been hard for you to maintain silence about Malfoy’s parents for a few months - him living with you and all, but it made my job exponentially easier.” Harry’s head whipped towards Malfoy who had let go of Harry and taken a step back, his eyes wide and filled with pain. “You could not imagine the bother it would have been had he tried to get involved” Marvin laughed over the phone. Draco stormed out of the room, his violent footsteps shaking as he slammed his feet down the stairs.
Draco had been trying to grasp his feelings for Harry at the time of his arrival and the idea of Aaron having a romantic interest in him was lightyears away. His mind was bewildered with questions that he didn’t have the space to ask. So, in short, after a few painfully long seconds, Draco shook his head in indecision. Almost to say, I haven’t even thought of it.
“I’m sorry!” Harry yelled out, tears now soaking his neck and the hem of his sweater.
“Harry, we have been over this before, I do not have another choice other than to leave him with you, I need you to stop being difficult so we can focus on the actual problem at hand here.” Harry huffed in frustration, his anger rumbling through his body.
“Well, what exactly did you want to know about that time?”
He was halfway through the door when he saw Harry speed walking down the hall, his partner not far behind him. Harry slowed down to nearly a halt when he saw Draco, clearly confused as to what he was doing there.
Although that was a one time occurrence for him and Charlie, they had remained close friends, enjoying their own banter together while the rest of the family badgered them about finding someone to bring to family events.
“Happy New Year to you too, Harry. I just wanted to quickly brief you on what’s been happening here at the Ministry, and I know, I know, you’re on holiday, but it should only take a moment of your time, no more than a few minutes.” Marvin stated, Harry rolled his eyes slightly, he never could properly disconnect himself from his job.
He continued to slide closer to Harry, who was now aware of what Draco was doing and was eyeing him with a smirk, taking the last drags of his cigarette before putting it out.
“I would love to go out with you. I just might need to stop by my apartment to pick up some proper clothing though?”
Harry eyed him suspiciously, noticing the obvious displacement in conversation.
Draco often found his mind fixating on their lack of a label, and all of the constant mixed signals he was getting from Harry. On the one hand, he had invited him to spend a week together in Italy, which is - in Draco’s eyes anyway - about as romantic as it gets. On the other, he freezes and not so gracefully changes the topic whenever Draco begins to hint at wanting to be official. It’s not that he’s worried about being exclusive, they spent so much time together that Potter would have to try really hard to sleep with someone else - and even if it weren’t for that, he doesn’t really think he would want to.
The night continued on and the questions about Draco’s love life had luckily stopped, it was nearing the closing time of the restaurant and Marie and Oliver had been eye fucking each other since their first finished bottle of wine. They made an excuse, something about Oliver having work early tomorrow morning and Marie needing to feed her fish and quickly wandered out of the restaurant, giggling amongst themselves. That just left Noah, Draco, and 4 empty wine bottles, never a good combination. They were sitting across from each other, ankles slightly grazing. Draco looked up from his glass and was met by light green eyes and a shackle of brown hair, the things that got him wrapped up in this whole mess in the first place, and after copious amounts of alcohol, made it very hard to resist his urge to invite Noah back to his apartment. He reached his arm slightly out and across the table and placed his fingers gently over Noah’s, holding his gaze and trying to search for reciprocation. They hadn’t said a word since Marie and Oliver left, and they usually didn’t need to, whatever they had was always unspoken about.
“Let’s go to a club tonight” Aaron urged, his body language shifting forward in anticipation. He rarely saw Aaron this excited about going out, he was usually more of a stay at home type.
“Let’s just say it wasn’t fun watching your friend or fuck buddy - I don’t know - get married” Draco sighed, his eyes staring out at the skyline. Harry nodded, they were back to a comfortable silence. Harry tucked his hands under his arms for warmth as they leaned on the balcony railing, their arms still pressed together. The evening had actually made Harry feel better, he had almost forgotten about his work from earlier in the day, glad to have the distraction of someone to talk to when he got home. He had spent far too many nights getting drunk on his own to try and numb his pain before, this was far more effective. Draco threw the butt of the smoke into the ashtray. He turned his body towards Harry’s, leaning in so their torso’s were inches apart. Harry’s heart rate sped up. Draco was looking down at his hands, which rode up the side of Harry’s arm. Harry leaned his head back with a grunt, looking up at the sky, his throat feeling lodged. He knew hooking up with Malfoy right now would be a bad idea, for both of them, yet when he looked down at Draco, his mind seemed to fog. Draco took half a step forward, bringing their faces closer together, and looking down at Harry’s lips. Harry leaned forward, their noses touching. He turned his head slightly to the left, grazing past Draco’s face and leaning further forward to put out the rest of his cigarette.
“If I was, who would you be to judge?” I snapped taking a drink of the hot chocolate trying not to act worried at all. Internally I was panicking.
“What are you doing here? Ginny said you didn’t come back again and asked if I could find you. She was worried. I don’t know why considering you always sneak off.” Harry said grabbing the book I was reading and putting it on a random shelf annoying my OCD mind.
I left quietly to my rooms to get out the booze. Never a better time than now to get smashed and forget who I was.
"Wow. I think whatever reporter that wrote that story is in the wrong field. They should get a job in divination instead." She joked amused.
I glared at her in the hallway hating myself for the darkness I introduced her to.
"You heard me. No. She got dragged into this entire mess to save our asses and buy us time to figure out how to get rid of the Dark Lord. I'm not going to then turn around and tell her she needs to give up time at school also. She has yet to complain about anything asked of her. Didn't complain when she was tortured by him. She forgave me when she found out I was intentionally manipulating her for my own selfish goals." I explained realizing how true the words were as I spoke them. She wasn't an angel, she had a defiant devilish streak, but she was also very selfless. I couldn't force her to drop her classes also. She was going to hate me once she read the paper, but I didn't want her to suffer anymore than necessary even if she wouldn't be with me.
When we got to the Headmasters office he gave me a hug goodnight and left me, our friendship on much better terms it seemed.
"I asked Elijah what he wanted for Christmas. I delivered. I couldn't deny a young boy his Christmas wish, could I?" He said with an ironic smile.
As the students filed out I waited for him to drop dead, start foaming from the mouth, anything that would show his poisoning, but he seemed to be fine and his mood less intense. Was it possible my potion had ACTUALLY worked?
“Severus. I have to find you. I have to go.” She said getting on her tippy toes and pulling me down to kiss my cheek.
The brick mansion was large and steady, and when we went inside the grey brick transformed to a beautiful white marble floor that gleamed. The entrance hall was massive and held a huge glass chandelier above it, reflecting the pristine white surface back on itself.
My blood still leaked from my wounds slowly and I knew I didn't have long to decide my fate.
“We will obliviate her before we bring her back. No harm done. She will assume it was just me if I’m the one who brought her back.” Malfoy Sr. reasoned thoughtfully. I thought Snape would argue more and come to my defense, but he just watched me darkly not moving or doing anything to indicate he cared at all.
That was not withstanding Severus's genetics. His child would be horribly conniving and his dark sense of humor would be intolerable to deal with.
"Fine." I agreed reluctantly. He stood up happily oozing triumph and held out a hand to me. I didn't want to touch his pale stretched inhuman skin but I let him help me to my feet.
"Where are you going?" I asked standing with him. Severus gave me a pointed glare.
Harry and Ron came down from the boys dormitory filled dressed and ready to go.
"The Dark Lord gave it to me the day my father died. Its not a locket though, it's a pocket watch." He said showing it to me, flipping over the silver cover to reveal a ticking clock inside. The carving around the edge of the pocket watch was unsuitable though. I reached out to touch it and immediately recoiled feeling the dark magic wafting off it.
“It’s just taking your magic. I can’t seem to call mine back.” He said frustrated. I grinned quite pleased with that.
“I’m right, aren’t I? He wasn’t just taking me to annoy Harry, there’s more at play here.” I said feeling my anxiety increase and my heart racing at the thought of being kidnapped again.
Scared.
"Fiendfyre." I said emotionlessly holding my wand aloft focusing my magic on destroying the two dark objects. The fire washed over the horcruxes, heating them and making them rattle noisily. After a long moment I ended the curse, but the horcruxes were still there.
He grabbed me by my waist and put me on the bed roughly, kissing my neck gently trailing kisses access my skin. Every inch that he touched felt alive in a way that was scandalous and yet so addictive. I wanted more.
I wish I hadn't told him. His pain was ten fold.
"The party?" I asked tiredly, suddenly feeling exhausted and so relaxed.
I dreaded explaining to the Headmaster what was going on with his master plan. She had somehow gone from not competent at all with commanding magic to perfection in minutes. We thought we had months still to prepare for an eventual all out war, but with him using her as a tool if we didn't destroy him soon he would be too powerful to kill even with all the horcruxes gone. Potter was the one who was supposed to kill him and he was hardly the strongest wizard anyways.
I assumed she would pass us, but she grabbed the front of my robes and pulled me in for a kiss. I stopped in my tracks, all rationality entirely gone. I had always kissed her, not the other way around. Somehow the fact she initiated the kiss made it even more delectable than usual and I slid my arms around her pulling her in then slid a hand into her hair turning her head to deepen the kiss.
“And?” He said as if this was a null point.
"Obviously its Stockholm syndrome, you know when you fall in love with your attacker." Draco said with a smirk biting into one of the fruit from a basket on the center table.
"Perhaps, yes. Hmm...Severus, your dismissed." He said waving me off in a distracted way not even giving mind to my presence anymore. He had no idea how much information he had just given us. We had no idea he was monitoring the horcruxes, but now that we knew he could remove the tracking we would catch him even more off guard.
“I knew my father was behind this! This is my fault. Last year I talked so much about how annoying she was and it was a shame she was pretty for a mudblood.” Draco admitted guiltily sitting next to Harry on my rug.
“Severus if your done playing with your toy our guest has arrived.” Voldemort said switching the attention off of me. I looked behind me and sure enough an enraged Harry and Draco were both quickly approaching the group of death eaters wands pulled out. They would die if they fought, for sure. Strangely enough Voldemort made no move to attack either boy, he just sat on his throne thoroughly pleased to have riled them up.
“I thought it would be shite when I first got there if I’m being honest, but it was actually fun, dare I say” Draco replied, tripping over some of his words.
“Honest about what?”
“Lets go.”
Draco nodded. He looked over at Harry, only now realizing how good he looked tonight. His hair was messy but well managed, he had a navy suit that fit him incredibly well, hugging his legs and thighs in all the right places.
“Well. I suppose this is it then. Draco we will be in contact with you if there are any more advancements with the case, but I suppose most of them shouldn’t concern you.” Marvin stood and outreached his hand to Draco and he reluctantly shook it, turning around and walking out of the room as soon as they were finished.
He was now working as a pharmaceutical alchemist, spending his days testing out and attempting to invent a variety of potions to solve medical issues or reverse specific hexes. It had been extremely rewarding and felt just stimulating enough without arising feelings of trauma from his past. Currently he was working on a potion to clot blood at the area of a wound in order to stop the patient from bleeding out entirely, it had been difficult and he had felt stumped for several weeks now.
“Let’s get out of here” A scruffy voice whispered. Draco simply nodded, as the man grabbed his arm gently and led him out of the building.
They hadn’t been nearly as close lately, Draco spending most of his time either on his own or with Harry. It made him feel like a bad friend, maybe he was.
Draco reeked of alcohol, smelling it seep out of his pores. He groaned as he turned over onto his side, rubbing his eyes with the base of his palms. He threw his feet over the bed, steadying himself with his arms on either side. He was wearing just his boxers and an old shirt from a quidditch match that he had gone to see with his dad. As he walked out of the room, walking past the kitchen he saw two glasses and an empty bottle of scotch, paired with a full ashtray on the dining room table. He sighed out loud at the sight, reminders of last night creeping back into his head. He walked into the washroom, turning on the shower and letting the steam fill up the room. The water hitting his back felt incredibly cleansing, he began to feel the grime from the day before begin to clean off. He thought back to his arm against Harry’s over the balcony, how close he had gotten to his face. He looked down at his half hard cock, shaking his head at how turned on that prick makes him. He continued on with his shower routine, washing his hair and body, hoping that somehow this problem would leave by the end of the shower. Yet the images of last night kept creeping into his head, even though nothing happened, the tension alone was enough. He slid his hand down his abdomen, grazing his hip bones and running his hand down his thigh. His dick leaked with precum, washed away quickly by the hot water. He wrapped his hand around the length, beginning to pump up and down in a rhythmic motion, picturing it was Harry’s mouth that was around him. He let a groan escape his lips, slapping his free hand over his mouth to stifle the sound. He heard a loud knock at the door.
Harry raised a bottle of scotch up to his face, taking a swig.
“Alright, I guess I’ll be the first to break the silence.” Draco said, Harry’s cold stare rested on him.
The air in the room was incredibly awkward, the only noise being the occasional shifting of someone readjusting in their seat. Curse Marvin for choosing this day out of all to be late.
The energy in the room shifted into one of awkwardness, both of them unsure of what to say. Draco scoured through the tea cupboard, desperately trying to find the chamomile quickly so he can rush back to his room and escape the tenseness of them being alone. He scrummaged as quietly as he could but from the look on Potter’s face from his peripheral, he wasn’t being as stealthy as he thought. Harry rose from his chair obnoxiously, stomping over to where Draco stood, reached into the cupboard and pulled out the chamomile, slamming it down onto the counter. Draco was about to protest at the rudeness of his actions, but chose to hold his tongue, he was in his turf.
His toes were cold and wet from the snow, his jacket wrapped tightly around his body to keep whatever body heat he had left trapped in. He was quite eager to get inside, run himself a hot bath and let sleep take him. Somehow, he knew once he saw Harry sitting on the porch, his face tear soaked, that he would have to adjust his plans for the night.
“I never took you for the breathing exercises type.” said a scruffy voice, Draco opened his eyes, and sure enough, Harry Potter stood in front of him.
Harry focused back on the task at hand, his eyes wandering down the street for any sign of movement. The Ministry had given them instructions to avoid engaging if possible, they were to gather as much new information as they could without being seen. It was difficult, considering the state they left Draco’s apartment in, it was clear that they were going to be thorough in the wreckage. Casper spotted a flash inside the house, a silhouette of a body grazing the first floor. They had brought Harry’s invisibility cloak, running over to the side of the house towards a door that led into the laundry room. Harry cringed as Casper turned the knob, hearing every slight movement, the door squeaking slightly as they pushed it open. They stood in the same spot, holding their breath, anxiously waiting to see if they had been heard. The body in the house kept moving, showing no sign of being aware of their presence. Casper pushed the door the rest of the way and they slid into the house. They heard the man walking throughout the rest of the house, being quiet in anticipation. Another woman apparated into the living room, barely in Harry’s sight but enough to distinguish her appearance. She was dressed in dark black cloaks, Harry recognizing them from years ago. Her hair was silver and shoulder length, prominent cheekbones carving out her face, paired with angular eyes. Harry didn’t recognize her, and from Casper’s perplexed expression, he was guessing he didn’t either. Her hands decorated with silver rings, the cuff of her sleeve riding up to show the end of a snake tail.
“Alright.” Draco said, shoving the rest of the pizza in his mouth.
“Everything okay Severus?” The Headmaster asked. I hadn’t realized I had frozen with my fork halfway to my mouth. Even Hagrid had noticed and gave me a weird glance.
“Sorry.” I said jumping back not wanting to hurt him. He ran his fingers down my cheek letting them linger before dropping them, looking to the Headmaster a bit desperately.
“Yes, well, do you do personal checks on all your students that skip or just the ones you kiss?” I asked him crudely wanting him to leave. I had been doing so good trying to ignore his existence. Him existing was messing it up. I tried to go back to my book, but he slammed my book shut almost shutting it on my fingers in his anger.
"Damn it Hermione. Don't scare me like that. Fuck. What are you doing out after curfew anyways?" He asked getting up and helping me up before brushing himself off from the castle's dirt.
I reluctantly got up and took out my wand facing him, all eyes on us. He gave me an encouraging smile, but my anxiety had never been worse. The last time I was in a real duel was in the ministry of magic. I tried not to think about it, but the quick powered spells being thrown everywhere trying to kill me came back to mind.
The last student bottled their potion and finally it was just us.
He stretched me inside and the pressure slowly became easier to handle, but the fire he had caused burned hotter and hotter. I moaned with desire, sure I couldn't handle it much more, but just as I felt I was about to fall over the edge he pulled back from the kiss slightly.
"The plan was to make you fall in love with me and not develop feelings, but here I am at midnight in the middle of the night risking everything just because you looked a little sad." He said quietly with a bit of a sarcastic laugh, his frustration with himself evident.
“Let me start, I’m sorry for how much of a douche I’ve been. I don’t care about purity, I was just angry. I know you didn’t want that to happen. So…can we be friends still?” He said interrupting me, but actually apologizing, though how sincere it was, was questionable.
"Suit yourself."
"You sure you didn't put him under a spell, right? That would be some great revenge though. His worst fear is falling in love." Draco said with no small amount of amusement at the idea of Snape in love.
“Sorry, what?” I asked trying to focus more on them this time.
"Waiting to be kidnapped." I said truthfully. He raised an eyebrow and held his hand out to help me up.
“Not for the reasons you think though. I regret you not getting to make the same decisions you made there in your own room. I regret not being able to have you so relaxed you were moaning with pleasure, sweating from how hard your heart was beating, begging me for more.” He said simply, his eyes grazing my body slowly as he explained. My heart started beating so fast I was sure I was going to have a heart attack. I could only imagine how red my cheeks were. He brushed my hair out of my face and pulled my chair to his without asking.
"On the count of three." Professor Lupin said kindly, his own wand drawn.
I would rather die and spend time with him, wherever he was.
"It's okay Hermione. Save yourself. I'm an old man and lived my life already." The Headmaster said gently without judgement. It was the first time I had ever truly seen him for what he was.
I got her quickly to the hospital wing knowing this wouldn't look good for me at all, but knowing she needed healing to prevent frostbite from settling in.
She had been pointedly ignoring me again and had skipped our next meeting apparently trying to keep her distance. I knew her magic would try to keep pulling her closer and closer to me. I had her within fingers grasp and I was terrified of loosing her.
"Umm...not really." I said trying not to sound suspicious. Her eyes flew to me immediately picking up on my high pitched tone.
"You could feed an extreme village for a year with that kind of money. I've never read about that in any books." I said surprised.
The Headmaster had played his own part in this war and had used me for his will.
If my suspicions were correct Dumbledore knew as much and there were more. Including one that had killed his hand.
Everywhere his hands touched warmed me and fed the quickly building fire of desire I had for him. I barely noticed as he cast a warming spell then had my dress off entirely. I took off his shirt then unbuttoned his pants, never breaking the intense hot kiss and his desire was immediately apparent.
“A magical bonding takes time. Little jumps. A baby elf bonds with their master in a year. If baby is taken from Master, he doesn’t bond fully. He is a bad elf.” He said offering me a puff pastry filled with some sort of cream.
"NOOOOOOO." My scream echoed in the round room as his body crumpled to the floor lifeless , his green eyes open, but without their sparkle anymore.
"He wasn't exactly faithful while he fucked me, was he?" I asked, loving the horrified look on his face. He released me as if burned shoving me as far away from him as possible.
The mix of emotions that Draco was feeling that morning were enough to have him confused at where the two of them stood. After Draco finished in the shower he walked out to Harry having breakfast in the kitchen, reading the Sunday paper like he hadn’t just been in him just 12 hours earlier. He simply offered him some eggs and went on with his business like usual.
So, Draco had always preferred one night stands with muggles to keep himself out of such predicaments. He turned around and did a shot with the random bloke that had offered them to him, he never really bothered to get their names as rarely was there a second date. Draco was getting annoyed at the slow pace that this muggle in particular wanted to go at, asking him questions about his job and childhood, when all Draco really wanted to do was to have somebody to pass the time with so he could pass out and continue living his life again in the morning. Draco decided to take matters into his own hands and stood up from the barstool, grabbing the strangers wrist and insisting he follow him to the hall where they could have a little more privacy.
Draco woke up in his room, alone. His head was throbbing from the night before, he always amazed himself with how drunk he could get without puking. The memories of last night didn’t come back to him until he rolled over on his side and he felt a twinge of pain in his ass. He couldn’t believe that he fucked Harry Potter the night before. The worst part was that he enjoyed it. But the sight of the other empty side of the bed left him feeling that he was the only one.
“Afternoon Draco, thank you for showing up at such quick notice.” Marvin spoke, his voice raspy and quiet sounding. Draco nodded his head in response.
The purchasing of two bottles was a realistic approach to the night, he knew that if he were to be camped out at the building of Malfoy that he would need plenty of alcohol to not grow too guilty over his treatment of Draco. So he popped off the bottle cap and took his first swig out of plenty, walking back over to the curb across from the building pathetically.
His mouth fell agape as he continued to inspect each intricate detail of the set.
Their arrival in Italy was less than ideal. They had chosen to stay in a rather remote town and the bus there was filled with potholes and sweaty passengers that had chosen to sit far too close to them for their liking. They made a unanimous decision to take a portkey back to London in the new year.
Despite this, despite knowing that being with Harry would lead to chaos and destruction, he still couldn’t resist whenever he as much as caught sight of him. No matter how much he swore he would stay away, give him the cold shoulder, ask Marvin to move him somewhere else, the second they were together again he was fighting for his love like it was his life source. A futile attempt most of the time, the once warm and giving Boy Who Lived was now cold and reserved, fucking his friends and leaving them hopeless at his feet.
“You’re not gonna let me dance alone are you? That’s not being a very good friend.” Harry teased, grabbing him by both wrists and attempting to pull him up off of the couch. Draco groaned in response but complied, allowing Harry to lead him to the makeshift dance floor by his wrist.
They had decided to go to muggle stores to find the suit for Draco, the wizarding world was great for many things but clothing was sadly not one of them. They had been shopping for what felt like ages, especially considering they were both overheating and getting progressively more irritable. So far nothing had taken Draco’s interest, they were all too mundane or too flashy and he wanted to land in an effortless middle. They made their way into one last store, Draco getting ready to swear off going shopping and just chose some random suit from his closet. The only reason he had chosen to even give this store a chance was because there was a particular suit in the window that seemed like it could be promising. It was a tan colour which Draco felt would compliment him well, he wasn’t one for drastic contrasts. They entered the store and he slipped into a changing room to try on the suit, eager to get the situation over with and to get home as soon as he could. He pulled on the pants, turning around to take a glimpse of how his ass would look in them, the pants hugged him well, accentuating all the right places. He put on the rest of the suit, in awe that he actually found one that gave him exactly what he was looking for, it fit his shoulders perfectly, making him look structured and put together. Draco stepped out of the changing room, doing a tiny twirl for Aaron, smiling from ear to ear.
“Are you coming?” said a voice from behind him. Draco nodded slightly and stomped on the butt of his cigarette. Turning away from Harry, he stepped into the cab.
Draco loved when Harry got slightly awkward, clear that he’s trying to choose his words wisely yet failing miserably.
Once in the car, the two rested their heads.
He rose slowly from the bed, careful to avoid sitting upright for too long. He slipped on underwear and pants and walked out into the hall. He picked up his shirt off of the floor that he had thrown off in a horny rush last night. As he walked past the washroom he heard the shower turn off, Draco knocked lightly and the door opened. Harry stepped out with a towel barely hanging onto his waist, his upper body trickling with water.
“If you still feel the same way in the morning, when the sun is up, then we can talk. Ok?”
As he phoned the taxi he leaned over onto a side table, steadying his body. He thought about his moment with Harry earlier on the balcony. They had gotten so affectionate in the last few months, always acting nonchalantly about it, as if they were just friends. Draco wasn’t sure how to react to this, the uncertainties of their relationship always leaving him dizzy.
Harry placed the head of the dick into his mouth, teasingly focusing on just the tip, making Draco groan for more. Harry looked up at Draco, his eyes mischievous. Draco moaned in anticipation, a desperate please escaping his mouth. Harry took the entirety of his length into his mouth, Draco’s cock hitting the back of his throat, making him moan loudly.
Harry walked behind Draco as he was doing his hair in front of the mirror, some sort of mask underneath his eyes to seemingly get rid of the puffiness. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, watching as Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath in the mirror. Just as Harry got a glimpse of what their relationship was before that dreaded phone call, Draco pulled him off of him and left the bathroom.
There wasn’t much noise this early in the morning, only the song of birds outside and the subtle drip of the coffee machine, this kind of serenity was incredibly rare in Harry’s life.
Draco’s body had gone cold. His heart beating through his chest. That was the last thing he had expected to hear.
Draco straightened up, “Oh. Um sure. My bad, I should have left something on the bed for you. Although I can’t say that I hate the sight of this.” He teased, the corner of his lips tugging upwards into a smirk as he gave him a wink, before walking into his bedroom.
“Wow, rooming with Draco, I’m sure you must be enjoying yourself” Ron said genuinely, giving Hermione a look and giggling lightly.
Draco leaned back into the freezer and threw Aaron another. Falling back into thought quickly after.
As the 15 minutes was nearing to an end, Draco began to pack his things back into his bag, he had been reading a book on alchemy to pass the time. As he was packing passive aggressively, he saw Potter stroll down the hallway, as if he had all the time in the world.
“You didn’t.”
At this Draco returned back to his earlier thought and placed his hand over Harry’s, watching his shoulders slightly fall in relaxation. His slender fingers laid against his, the warmth from his mug radiating onto Harry’s hand.
He was watching Draco take inhales of his cigarette, admiring his ability to look so annoyingly attractive even in the middle of the night, hoping he wouldn’t look down to see Harry on the curb.
Draco rolled his eyes without even looking over. The bartender slid over the glass to Draco slowly, unsure as to whether it was ethical giving a man this drunk more alcohol. Draco snatched it from his hand, gulped it all down in one go. He turned to Potter, raised his middle finger in his face, then placed the glass back on the bar before turning around to head back to his table.
They spent the next couple of hours continuing to catch up on each other's lives, Aaron had been given an exciting new project at work, one he felt really pushed his potions skills and forced him to become more innovative. Draco barely remembered the last time he had really been invested with work, most of the time he floated through the day, doing the same mundane potions over and over. Although he was eager for an opportunity like Aaron’s, he also knew he didn’t have the mental capacity to throw himself into his work right now. They talked about his depressive episode, and what triggered it. He wasn’t entirely sure as it was a plethora of things, but he was used to the chemical imbalance in his head that caused him to experience days like yesterday quite frequently. Aaron was usually around to bring him food and comfort him through the day, but yesterday forced Draco into a complete shut down for the majority of the day, which led him to be unable to even want to call Aaron.
“Harry” Draco groaned in between kisses.
“I’m sure you have overheard conversations at the Ministry that hint at the attack of your apartment being planned. There’s currently a group of death eaters calling themselves the Renovation, that are targeting other death eaters that have renounced the ways of the Dark Lord. They have been targeting them one by one. You and your family have been at the top of that list for a while now, hence why you have been placed under the protection of Potter.” Draco scoffed internally at this, his past rivalry against Potter convincing him that he definitely didn’t need Potter’s protection, despite how friendly they had gotten. Still, his pulse rate increased and he found it hard to swallow.
Aaron tapped his arm, eyes wide, and pointed towards a person walking down the street towards them. It was Potter. Again. Second time in two days felt excessive and had dropped Draco’s mood nearly immediately. This time however, Draco decided to be an adult and greet Harry, after all, they weren’t teenagers anymore. He waited till Harry got a bit further up the street and noticed him, Harry’s eyes did a double take to make sure it really was Malfoy that he was seeing, before he recontained his cool and dusted off his shirt.
They walked mostly in silence to a bistro, Marie periodically chatting about her life at work. Although Draco hadn’t so much as brought up Harry since her and Oliver had come over for dinner, he had a lingering feeling that this lunch was about to be centered around that.
He lifted Harry off the couch and led him to the bed, changing him into a pair of pyjamas before laying him down to sleep, placing a glass of water on the bedside table for the morning. Despite Harry’s constant resistance against going to sleep, he was quick to pass out as soon as his head hit the pillow.
So that’s why, despite all of his gut feelings telling him to go home, he stayed.
Harry eyed Draco for a moment, taking a pause to look down his suit. If Draco didn’t know better, he would have thought that Potter was checking him out.
“Do you want to go out for lunch?” Aaron asked.
“I see.”
“Can we talk about literally anything other than Harry please?”
The night they had slept together was a drunken blur for Harry, but Draco’s presence illuminated his memory, the soft gaze behind his eyes making his stomach churn, not in lust, but in longing. He remembered staring at Draco as he was nearly taken by sleep, his eyes fluttering shut, his bare chest rising and falling with his breath. The moonlight from the window had cascaded onto his face, the cool air entering the room to wash away the thick, hot ambiance. Harry laid there, analyzing Draco’s sharp, cold features until they turned soft and homely, his platinum hair falling over his eyes. What amazed Harry the most was his lack of insomnia that night, Draco’s warmth swallowing him into a deep and restful slumber, much to Harry’s discontent.
If Draco didn’t know better he would have thought that the expression on Harry’s face was concern. Even though they were friends, it was difficult to imagine Harry caring about his emotions or state of mind after he had basically rejected any romantic future for them.
Her response was groggy, but there, giving me hope.
Of me?
I knew we didn't have much time together, but it didn't matter, I just wanted to savor what time we did have and foster the connection I felt. I knew the moment we went back to Hogwarts though we would have to act like we barely knew each other again, the distance difficult when I had to be so close to him.
If everyone wants to talk about how I'm going to the dark side, or whoring myself for grades...well I might as well do it? Why hide when they enjoy talking about it so much.
"I love it, thank you." I said honestly having to pace myself so I didn't drink and eat too fast.
We walked slowly towards her and her eyes shot up from the paper to us, her expression of utter fury. She would probably hate me now and want nothing to do with me. I had ruined her perfect reputation and the embarrassment she felt would have been overwhelming.
"Aren't we going to practice deflecting?" I asked confused as the class hurriedly filed out of the classroom talking in hushed whispered.
"I guess I just want to make sure I keep up on my studies so I can get a good job after school." I said vaguely not really knowing what to say. She scoffed at this.
“Misunderstood what? She had her tongue down the imbeciles throat!” I retorted hotly. He rolled his eyes and gave me his trademark smile.
I gasped taking in my surroundings looking around wildly for Tom.
“Yes, I just got caught up with school work. That’s it.” I lied not wanting to burden her with the details of my every move. She rolled her eyes dramatically.
"She doesn't remember how she got like this. Potter told me she tried some of his potion. I get the feeling that isn't all that happened?" Poppy said accusingly to me, her tone clipped unlike its usual firmness she had with me.
“I wasn’t flirting. My potion is simmering CLEARLY.” I said not in the mood to be the well behaved Gryffindor right then. I normally would simper to his every whim, but just couldn’t bring myself to. The class turned to me shocked and I heard a whisper go around the room. Snape’s eyes darkened dangerously and I saw him change his mood from annoyed to dangerous fast.
“Hermione.” He gasped taking in a shaky breath before collapsing to his knees. I was to his side in a slip second not caring what anyone thought if they were out at night. I threw my arms around him hugging him tightly so relieved he was okay I felt I might burst. He chuckled returning the hug gingerly.
"I forgot the fairy wings." Potter admitted suddenly, more panicked at the thought of someone else taking the potion.
Snape knew what he was doing and his confidence teased me into a relaxed state I didn’t know I wanted to be in. His kiss was deep and controlling leading me down a path there wasn’t any going back from. It was wrong. He was my teacher.
Hopefully the pain would keep him fighting though.
"You've been helping Dumbledore destroy my horcruxes, haven't you?" He said, his eyes red with anger and lack of sleep. I knew I had only minutes to calm him down and heal the wounds before I would die from blood loss.
I hadn't expected him to hit me at all. He seemed just as stunned. His anger evaporated in a second, horror written across his face. It was strange, he was such a guarded person, but when he fucked up it showed in every inch of his body.
"You aren't going to accuse me of being dark again are you just because I like him, right?" I asked her. She shook her head.
"Your kidding! There's no way...I mean I was just kidding. The hell. No wonder. It's the biggest potions supplier in all history. I mean the monopoly you have on the market for potions and ingredients is just...wow." I said when I recovered from the shock. He chuckled a bit and glanced to me enjoying my reaction.
“Well yes obviously. He was so geeky looking when I first started Hogwarts but now…” She trailed off blushing.
"Exactly." He said pointedly, squeezing my waist a bit, his eyes drifting over my body, his mind back to a very dirty place.
"I should be angrier. I should hit him or something. I just can't seem to bring myself to actually do it." I admitted hating how weak I was.
I sobbed hard holding him tightly, my pain as much from losing him as it was from the lies I was fed from the person I loved the most.
"Clearly. Incendio!" Draco said decisively, trying to light the diadem on fire. It didn't work. I could still feel the dark magic calling to me.
“So, show them what this side is capable of to build a better support system for ourselves?” I asked. Snape nodded.
"Severus, I have some important matters to discuss." He said urgently. I passed the lines of students making sure to take extra measures to ignore Hermione.
“I’ve never heard that one.”
“Severus, not insulting is not the same thing as showing genuine affection and sweeping her off her feet.” I couldn’t deny he had a point.
"I was looking for dittany, and you know that can ONLY be picked in the moonlight and there is a patch just beyond the gates. Ow! Can you let me go, that hurts!" I retorted hotly playing into the scenario, but also very pained by how strong his grasp was. He turned on me in a second, his anger surprisingly believable.
"Did he say specifically what?" I asked curiously, trying not to sound alarmed.
I didn’t think she had bonded with me yet. It was a step in the right direction. Somehow I had assumed the bonding was only one way. I didn’t anticipate her taking my magic or being left with a piece of hers. It was somehow far more intimate than her kiss had been, and that had been fiery in the best of ways.
“Everyone is capable of running a marathon everyday, that doesn’t mean they will do it. People go to for the easiest way out usually, which in this case is nice predictable spells they learn as kids. Also saying words is not enough. You have to direct the magic.” He explained twirling his wand in his hand calmly observing me.
I expected him to have me appearate to Malfoy manor, but he pulled me away suddenly when we got out of the gates and we spun rapidly together.
"She woke up in hysterics. I had to put several calming spells on her. I think she might need a psychiatric evaluation, she's been through a lot Albus." Madame Pomfrey said worriedly as if I wasn't there. The Headmaster gazed at me deeply as if reading me.
“Is that so?” He asked silkily. My amusement died down just a bit and I realized I had just stolen one of the most corrupt people I knew magic. Then joked about it. He could kill me and get it back. I was nothing to him, right?
I didn’t feel so stupid for hating Snape after seeing how fast he was betraying me.
“You have failed clearly Longbottom. Leave class and study more so maybe there will be one class you don’t fail this year.” Snape said with a sneer waving his hand evaporating the potion and smoke instantly.
I gasped stunned at my reflection. I had the diadem on and a beautiful flowing white and purple lace dress that was fit for royalty. I was beautiful. Gone was the plain boring Hermione, I could actually see some beauty in my reflection. My hair fell in soft curls around my face and my eyes were shining with their bright brown warmth. I was not a vain person, but I was in love with what I saw instantly.
It’s because of Harry isn’t it?
“Because we are going out tonight.” Draco’s shoulders relaxed but he rolled his eyes at the proposition.
A stifled groan could be heard from behind Harry’s door, a sound of a face jabbing into the pillow. Draco let out a chuckle, laughing at the probable feelings of realization that flooded back from the night before.
“Considering my slight alcohol abuse problem and overall lack of emotional stability, I would say it was often.” Draco said, getting a giggle from Harry in return.
They prepared to head home, Draco walking into another room to call a taxi while Harry and Hermione talked more.
Despite Hermione adamantly yelling at them early in the morning that this must be done - at least the decorations - before she was back from the store, they were still sprawled out lazily across the cloud soft cushions of their bed. They had their limbs wrapped around each other, Draco’s long and gentle fingers running soft circles around Harry’s spine.
“Woah… What are you guys doing here?” Harry said, trying to keep the confusion in his voice to a minimum.
“It wasn’t too often - was it?” Harry asked, finally looking up from his mug.
“Somebody passed out for a while” Aaron joked as he added some white wine to his pan. Draco thanked him for the bed and sat at the kitchen table, asking him what he was making. It was now around 6 in the evening, and he was starting to feel his hunger.
They didn’t talk much, he made her a warm dinner, choosing to do it himself rather than ask the house elves for the additional personal touch. Her eyes which were once filled with life were now dull and averted. It pained Malfoy to see his mother in this state, especially when, for some reason, he felt he was personally responsible. He should have gone against the Ministry’s requests and gone on his own investigation to try and find them.
The warm air from the ceiling vent was blowing onto Harry’s forehead, his body aching and groggy from his destructive state from the night before. The silk sheets were smooth against his skin, urging him to bury his face deeper into the bed and let sleep take him. A compelling proposition if it weren’t for his being in Draco’s apartment, not even a day after he had moved out. He groaned at his pathetic behaviour, showing up on his doorstep drunk and disorderly, in the middle of the night at that. He was lucky that Draco wasn’t one for sleep, or his grand romantic gesture (he hadn’t completely thought it through and now looking back it was more poignant than anything) would have been a failure.
Draco was sitting on the couch with Hermione as Harry and Ron were in the kitchen taking what they called ‘obligatory pre-party shots’ which they both claimed were vital to have a good time while they were out. Truthfully speaking, Harry just needed an excuse to drink and survive this night of painful tension with his boyfriend.
As Marie and Oliver got ready to leave, stumbling slightly from the wine, they said their goodbyes to both Harry and Draco, this time bringing Harry into a hug as well, promising to keep in touch. Marie groaned as she put her heels back on, mumbling something about the patriarchy. Draco stood back, watching as Harry and Oliver exchanged phone numbers, Harry looking giddy like a child. Marie caught his eye, giving him a knowing wink before grabbing Oliver and leaving the apartment, blowing kisses left and right.
His sleep was restless and light, waking up at even the slightest noise from outside. The insomnia that he had thought he had outgrown was now coming back at full force, depriving his body of any rest.
“Oh. Wow. Okay.” Draco found himself stuttering.
The illusion of their mundane life had been broken when Draco had been called into the Ministry, within the hour his troubles became much bigger than whether or not he should have kissed Harry. In fact, they made those worries seem so minuscule it could have given Draco the confidence to do it, if he hadn’t been so heart wrenchingly distraught.
Harry took a seat, ordering a scotch on the rocks from the waitress.
“Draco, are you okay?” Harry asked as Draco got closer, attempting to place a hand on his shoulder. Draco shrugged it away, pushing Harry to the side as he continued walking. He wasn’t sure why he was mad at Harry but he felt the need to push this anger onto somebody, anybody.
Harry’s eyes widened at the mention of the case. He had almost forgotten about his white lie which had dug him further into a hole. He wasn’t sure what compelled him to avoid telling Draco the truth, but something about seeing Draco torn down and broken had ignited pangs of severe guilt in Harry; guilt that he wasn’t ready to face or be responsible for. There was also a part of him that didn’t want their relationship to be tarnished by his nonsensical tucking away of important family matters. It was now that Harry considered that maybe Draco was too good for him, despite the obvious power imbalance between them when they were younger, Harry felt like a worse person than even an ex follower of Voldemort.
Harry was laughing at something the other man said, throwing his head back and having an effortless appearance to him. He had grown a beard and had filled up generously, his shirt fitting his arms nicely. Draco felt like he had seen a ghost, he had been staring for far too long and as he expected, Harry met his gaze soon enough. Harry’s smile had dropped almost instantly as he saw the realization come to him. Draco was not about to this right now, not tonight. He turned around quickly, walking back towards the man he left in the corridor.
Matt had attempted to kiss Harry multiple times throughout the night, trying to lean in slowly while they were talking and his gaze constantly switching to Harry’s lips. He wasn’t sure why he kept avoiding the kiss, normally it didn’t matter to Harry if the man had the driest personality or barely peaked his interest, he was just looking for a good snog.
“Are you saying what I think you’re saying?” Draco asked, scared of the answer.
“You could’ve talked to me about it!” Draco was fed up.
The elevator opened and they moved towards the door of the apartment, their lips only parting in order to open the door. Harry closed the door shut and pushed Draco up against it, grinding his hips against him. His mouth travelling down onto his neck, his teeth biting at the skin lightly, causing Draco’s head to throw back in pleasure.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That being said, I am a mess and would love to use your shower and take a nap on your couch if you will let me.” Draco said, just the sound of the two things beginning to relax him a little. Aaron agreed swiftly and even insisted that he sleep on the bed, ensuring him that it wouldn’t be an issue. Draco complied and walked over to the washroom to start the shower. He got undressed, looking in the mirror and turning around to see some of the scars on his back. They were smaller, nothing compared to what others experienced during the war, but a constant reminder nevertheless. He reached his fingers over them slowly, feeling the rivets in and valleys in his skin. He stepped into the shower, letting the warm water hit his back and relieve his aching muscles. Draco had to actively keep himself from falling asleep under the stream, deciding that it would be rather awkward for Aaron to have to wake his naked body from in the shower. He cleaned his body and washed his hair as quickly as he could, longing for the bliss of finally hitting a pillow to sleep. As he stepped out, realization dawned on as he noticed the lack of towel hanging on the wall, calling out to Aaron to bring him one. Aaron yelled back an agreement, ranting about how apologetic he was as he opened the door a crack and slid the towel in, opening it a little too wide and accidentally getting a glimpse of Draco’s wet and very naked body.
He had just gotten used to the distant and argumentative ways that they had begun conversing in, but now, he found himself lying awake at 8 in the morning, and wondering if Harry’s drunken confession from the night before would result in any change between them.
“I can’t really do that.” Harry said, leaning against the door frame.
The night unfolded in a way that Draco simply hadn’t expected. While he realized that he and Harry were in the biggest fight they had thus far, he still didn’t think that would mean he would spend most of New Years night alone. He was sitting at the bar of the club, drinking a soda, surprisingly not in the mood to swallow his troubles with alcohol.
Draco made his way downstairs to prepare a quick breakfast as Harry stepped into the en suite of the home, stretching his arms above his head to extend his spine from hours in bed. He found himself in awe of the life he was living, with Draco at his side.
“This Potter thing has been killing me.” Draco grunted, he had explained his growing feelings for Harry to Aaron a few weeks back. It hadn’t been met with as much surprise as he had expected, but Aaron has been avoidant of the subject since then. He could have sworn he saw Aaron roll his eyes, he decided on giving him the benefit of the doubt.
Sitting in his office chair at work, Draco was deep in contemplative thought, going over the interactions between him and Harry that stood out to him. Aaron knocked lightly on the door, a pointless act as it was already half open.
“I can see what you mean, you could’ve cut the tension in there with a knife.” Casper said followed by a slight laugh.
Harry pulled off of the dick, leaving a string of spit. He pushed Draco’s legs up, exposing his ass. Harry muttered a wandless spell, leaving his hand slick with lube. He pressed one finger against the hole, making Draco’s dick twitch. Harry smirked at the sight, pressing his finger in completely. Draco’s eyesight began fading at the sides from the sensation, his moans filling up the room, causing Harry to cast a silencing spell.
Draco just nodded in agreement, taking a seat on the other side of the couch, careful to keep his distance.
His first visit to the Manor after months of being away had him filled with nostalgia and turmoil, the memories of his childhood bittersweet in his mind. The tall hedges blocking the sun as he walked towards the front entrance, seeing the grand doors that led to a life he left behind. The building always looked so ominous, as if the structure itself was soiled with the secrets and wrong doings of the Malfoy name. His mother, who he hadn’t seen for nearly a year, had aged significantly. The wrinkles in her face and the dark circles under her eyes gave a view into the painful past few months that she had, it hurt Draco to see his kind mother like this, and burned a sense of guilt into his chest.
Draco nodded in agreement but couldn’t help but feel hurt. He realized he had misread the situation just as he had with Noah a few months before.
“What is that supposed to mean?” Harry was confused.
“What have you been up to the last few years? All the same questions apply.”
“Well, the morning after me and you… you know - I invited him over. Just to talk and hang out - nothing more. He ended up kissing me.”

The roughness of the fabric slid up his legs as Draco put on his jeans, the pants a little tight around his thighs, having been borrowed. He fixed his hair in the mirror, scrunching it to make it seem effortless and unkept. Him and Aaron had spent the day together, going to get lunch at a bistro down the street and watching a movie before beginning getting ready for the night. He had already had a few drinks to ensure he was a little tipsy before getting to the club, unwilling to pay for too many overpriced drinks. They had chosen to go to Essence, a gay club in downtown London. Aaron had allowed Draco to choose the place as he had no interest in hooking up with anyone that night, Draco didn’t either but always wanted to have the choice.
They felt silent for a few moments, both of them contemplating bringing up the metaphorical elephant in the room.
“Don’t even get me started, you would not believe the weekend I’ve had” Draco sighed while dropping his head into his hands. Aaron was someone he truly felt he could confide in, maybe it's because Aaron also struggled with parents who were death eaters as a child and they could relate to each other through their trauma.
Maybe Draco had grown delusional and Harry was only putting up with him because he was required to for work, but at times he thought they were actually friends, the time they spent together was usually pleasant.
