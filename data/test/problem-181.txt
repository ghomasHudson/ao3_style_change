She choked and hugged him again. Harry felt like she was trying to seek some comfort from him this time rather than giving it to him, and he suddenly felt so tired. Harry hugged her back this time anyway, it wasn’t fair to her.
Ron and Hermione took him to Madam Pomfrey the next morning. The previous day they let him be, though he’d felt their concerned glances all the time. When after an awkward breakfast Hermione raised to her feet swiftly and took Harry’s arm, he didn’t resist. When he realised they were going to the Hospital Wing, he merely sighed but let her tug him along, Ron by his side with a serious expression.
“Get out,” he said quietly and almost flinched from the cool steel in his own voice, it sounded raspy from disuse.
Harry suppressed a shudder. Malfoy’s voice was so quiet, Harry was half sure it was in his head. And he could feel the burn of the memory behind his neck as well.
"C'mon, Harry, let's go find an empty compartment." He didn't smile and Harry thought he otherwise would have.
Then, as he lay in the darkness, exhausted after all the smiles and thankful feelings, he let the inner darkness match the one above him. Then he would wait until Malfoy came. ‘I can’t sleep anyway’, he thought. ‘I don’t care if he comes, why should I care, I don’t.’ Then he waited for the soft opening of the door, anyway.
Harry woke up slowly to the bright sun shining in his face. He grimaced and turned away, but the comfort was lost and he opened his eyes. They felt puffy and heavy so he blinked a few times. Everything was bathed in bright morning October light, making already mostly white surroundings blindingly so. Harry supposed it was early.
After a bit Malfoy looked up at Harry and there was a strange expression on his face. Harry blinked away the tears and everything became slightly more focused. Malfoy was looking at him with… Harry couldn’t really decide. Horror? Pity?
"I like you too," Harry found himself whispering. Draco's hand clenched into a fist in Harry's hair on the nape of his neck.
The morning promised a clear, sunny day and Harry couldn’t wait to go out. He kept the enthusiasm to himself with some effort. Although he had his suspicions about his traitorous leg that felt like bouncing from time to time. At some point of the early afternoon, clouds hid the sun, heavy and grey but that wasn’t enough to reduce Harry’s determination.
There’s an awkward silence for a bit and I let the relief wash over me. Stupid, that, because you exclaim:
Ron just eyed him suspiciously and with some concern but nodded without complaint. Well, Harry really did want to rest from all the attention for a bit but also he wanted to stay because of Malfoy. At their last meeting, Harry asked him if he was going to leave for the holidays and Malfoy said no. When Harry asked why, he kept silent for a long time and then just said that he hated that house. Harry didn’t say anything.
He tore his eyes away with some effort. He needed his head clear. That thing yesterday had messed up his thoughts and then Malfoy came and made everything worse. Harry felt like thinking hurt.
He nodded and they headed for the nearest entrance in the train. The crowd parted and quieted as they made their way through.
“Why not? I’ve cast them, you know, plenty—” Malfoy’s sneering voice broke off, and Harry’s wand shook badly in his hand.
It was the wrong thing to say. Ron was dealing with his own crisis and it was hard to blame him. All of the Weasleys were mourning after Fred still, and Ron wasn’t taking it easy. He spent a lot of time with his family, trying to figure out the new painful way of living. A lump still formed in Harry’s throat every time he thought of Fred. But he didn’t dare to come to Weasleys. He knew he didn’t really belong there, at least for the time being. Hermione felt the same, he was sure of it, even if they hadn’t talked about it.
That night he dreamed about "I hate you" kisses again. Only this time it was accompanied by tears in stormy eyes that weren't shed.
“Oh! Wait! That horrible one in second year?! It was so humiliating! You said it was Ginny?” Shiiit.
Interesting thing was, Malfoy hadn’t come here when Harry was at the lessons once, even if Malfoy himself had a free period. But Harry didn’t ask.
The water licked the shore hesitantly, swaying back and forth, back and forth with the smallest of waves. It was cool and dark.
The shadows of Grimmauld Place looked down at him from the dark corners, breathing disapproval and strange quiet knowing.
He searched the map for the name and almost laughed at how familiar that was. Malfoy wasn’t in the dungeons, nor was he in Library or the Great Hall. Harry’s heart quickened as he looked for the Pitch. And there it was, not really in the same place the day Harry saw Malfoy but near. And Malfoy was moving slowly, walking to nowhere in particular.
Hermione seemed satisfied and Ron quickly switched his attention to the breakfast that appeared on the table. Harry looked up to the enchanted ceiling just to find slow, fresh snowflakes shimmering from the grey clouds. It hadn’t been snowing since the last time Harry went flying. He glanced at Malfoy. And found him looking up as well, a strange expression on his face. Harry swallowed. Yeah, it was the same Malfoy he saw last time in the snow after all.
Harry felt the heat on his cheeks and god that was a disaster. Malfoy was looking at a loss during his speech but at the last question his pale eyes widened and the colour drained from his face. He stared at Harry for a couple of seconds. Harry cursed himself for talking at all and, anyway, what Malfoy was reacting so dramatically for? He didn’t say anything
For some time, they looked at each other. The setting sun coloured Malfoy’s hair slightly pink and gold. The sharp shadows made his nose and chin look even more pointed than normal. There was a slight line at the side of his mouth, as if he smirked entirely too much to one side.
He went to the centre of the clearing and sat on the grass. There was some soft noise in the distance, the hum of the river and the ticking of the clock. Harry looked around.
Harry really didn’t mind. He supposed he should have found it annoying, as Malfoy didn’t have the nicest voice, he sometimes got so excited his voice went pitchy, he loved bad impressions (Harry told himself he didn’t find them funny, not one bit) and he had a very high opinion of himself but… He hadn’t insulted the people Harry cared about for some reason, hadn’t insulted anyone much for that matter. He just, well, talked about details and things that didn’t really matter. And of himself, of course.
The next time he woke up it was night. He sat up in the bed, swallowing as much air as he could and trying to erase the images of the nightmare from his mind. The spilling blood and the suffocating darkness of the passageway, scared screams of his mother pleading for him, the shut door of the cupboard under the stairs… Harry pulled his knees up to the chest, swaying a little and concentrating on breathing.
On Christmas morning, Harry went straight outside only to find Draco with a broom in hand and a golden snitch, smiling nervously. The snowfall had stopped a day ago and now the sun warmed their faces and the crisp cold air was clear and inviting. Malfoy was hesitant at first but after a while regained his usual confidence, smiling brighter than the white light of the snow under the morning sun. Harry let him win and Draco was so smug about it, Harry just had no choice but to kiss him. That was an amazing Christmas present if you ask Harry.
“S’not like I care.” Potter mumbled so that Draco just caught the words. He continued in a louder voice. “We had a batch reunion about five years ago and you weren’t there. Neville asked after you for some reason and Luna told us you’d left the country. That’s all.” he finished in a defensive tone.
am not a child anymore,” Draco retorted, jaw clenched. “I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions, and if I choose to not leave the Manor, so be it.”
“Anyways,” Draco continued. “I finished my Mastery but had no desire to return just yet. The professor I studied under in Paris suggested that I travel and gave me a list of Masters I might look up on the way. I’d never really done much travelling before, except for the occasional shopping trip to Paris or Milan with Mother, so I thought why not?”
“Oh, I see,” Draco sniffed. “So you’re only apologising for your excessive rudeness and false accusations because you want to keep your bollocks intact. Such a display of repentance as I’ve never seen before.”
Harry chuckled, pausing in his torrent of kisses to give Draco’s neck a fond nuzzle. “Have I ever told you, you have a beautiful neck?”
They ate in silence except for the occasional remark about how good the food was. Merlin, he wondered at the Weasleys not being fat as stuffed pigs if they ate this kind of food every day. When they were done, Draco leant back on his hands with a contented sigh.
“It’s not like I’d be doing anything better with my time.” Draco shrugged. “And anyways, this way we’ve made much more progress.”
Ginny’s eyes narrowed. “Draco,” she began slowly. “You are going to meet my brothers and that is final.”
Potter didn’t seem to be listening, too intent on glaring across the room at Draco. He’d been like that for a while now and for the life of him, Draco couldn’t fathom why. It couldn’t be because of the match; Potter was an appallingly good-natured loser and had even congratulated Draco on a fine catch when they’d sat down for supper. In fact, he’d been reasonably polite for most of the evening until this sudden shift in mood, and the only explanation Draco could come up with was that Potter didn’t like the way Ginny was plastered against him. Even now, she was casually placing her head on his shoulder, and as far as Draco knew, Potter wasn’t aware of his sexuality and it probably
“Well Jamie, didn’t you already introduce yourself to him, seeing as you already know his name too?”
Draco nodded mutely and with a squeeze and a pop, they were standing in front of a tall house of the likes that Draco had never seen before. It looked more like parts of many houses mashed together actually and he wondered if magic kept it standing since it looked like it would topple over at any moment. He was tempted to back off now, seeming to finally realize that he’d be entering
“Well, if he was as horrid as you make out, I guess it was only natural to want to stay away from someone who seemed just as bad,” he rationalised aloud, for both his own and Potter’s benefit. “I’ll admit I may have overreacted as well, and it’s not like I don’t know what people think of Slytherin House, especially after they hear of its history.”
Harry does so, keeping his expression as serious as he can. Draco is snuggled up against him in an instance and Harry lowers his arm to rest on his narrow shoulders. It was a surprise, but the fact that Draco’s a shameless cuddler isn’t something Harry complains about.
tell me what is going on?” Ginny interjected heatedly. “And what in the world happened to Draco’s neck? He looks like he got attacked by the Giant Squid.”
involving the War, but his mother thought differently, hoping that discussing what had happened would help them move past it.
He’d been with Harry for a long time now and while things hadn’t always been perfect, these years together had been some of the happiest of Draco’s existence. There were still times when he’d randomly wonder how his life might have been, had he not plucked up the courage to pursue what he wanted. In the still hours of the morning when he was coming home after a long shift at St Mungo’s; during quiet evenings by the fireplace, snuggled up to Harry as he recounted the heroisms of his day… Draco would wonder for the sake of wondering, although it never lasted long. He knew that in the grand scheme of things, what was most important was that he was here with Harry
The familiar voice had Draco springing up and away as if he’d Apparated, and sure enough, he looked down to see Ginny Weasley staring back at him furiously.
“Malfoy?” The hand on his shoulder made him jump and open his eyes in a rush, but it was only Weasley. “You alright, mate?”
He jumped into the Floo before Draco could dredge up a retort, his laughter echoing behind him. Draco scowled, following behind with a muttered curse.
In all truth, Ginny didn’t look surprised at all, and she was grinning from ear to ear as if she knew something that Draco didn’t. Swallowing his mouthful, he rose to give her a hug and customary kiss on the cheek, and only belatedly remembered that kissing her with Potter a few feet away might not have been the best of ideas. When he chanced a glance at him, Potter was staring back with a strained expression. He didn’t voice any complaints though, and sat placidly as Ginny made her way over to him to plant a kiss on his cheek.
“Weasel can’t, but I’m pretty sure the rest of the family aren’t nearly as dim-witted. Remember the pranks the twins used to play in school?”
?” Draco was scandalized. The robes that they’d eventually bought were utterly gorgeous and would suit Ginevra as if they were
proud of it. Instead of continuing on as archaic bigots stuck too firmly in the old ways, they were accepting and unprejudiced, both of which were admirable traits to have.
Draco lay on his back and covered his eyes with his arm. How like his mother to provide relief but keep it far enough away that he’d suffer whilst getting it. He dragged himself off to his ensuite bathroom and cast a quick breath-freshening and teeth-cleaning charm on his mouth before stripping off the pants he was wearing and sliding into the shower. A cold shower helped to wake himself up a bit and feeling more human, he exited the bathroom with a towel slung low on his hips, another one he used to wipe his head.
“You already knew what I really was so don’t act so surprised,” he answered loftily. “Besides, he’s my cousin, and family has always been very important to me.”
“Good.” Potter said, taking Lily back onto his shoulders. “We’ll see you then. Oh, and Malfoy, wear Muggle clothes. Casual.” He smirked when he said this and Draco had a sudden urge to stick his tongue out at him.
Draco sighed, looking out at the fields that surrounded Luna’s quaint house. The last time he’d been there had been a decade ago and he’d been fresh out of Hogwarts. He’d visited a few days after her father’s funeral. He would have liked to have come for the funeral itself, but with memories of the War still fresh, he hadn’t wanted to cause trouble with his attendance. So he had come later on, holding her close as they’d sat on this very veranda, watching the fireflies dance in the mellow colours of twilight. Luna hadn’t shed a single tear though; instead choosing to tell him about the wonderful things she and her father had done together, a smile firmly on her face the whole time.
A good thing I’m not like them. I would sooner bite you than smile at you the way they all smile, full of wonder and
“It’s not pathetic, the way you feel. I know it sucks, believe me, I know,” he pushed at Malfoy’s shoulders a bit harder. “But you can’t dismiss it forever. Can’t hide from it.”
“So, my name is Lynda Wright, I’m a mind healer at St Mungo’s but often work on the continent. I studied Muggle Psychology after my graduation from Hogwarts.” She paused, looking around with a somewhat melancholic look to her eyes. “It’s good to be back.”
Harry smiled to himself. He thought of finding a passageway he’d used a few times as a shortcut. Some students passed in the corridors, greeting him. Harry nodded to them absentmindedly. He turned in the direction of the passageway. Its entrance was on the second floor behind a tapestry and led to the first floor with a narrow staircase. It wasn’t really popular but could be handy when one needed to get to the library fast.
Somewhere in a space between the 8th second and the 10nth, you come close enough to talk. I feel drunk, smirking at your faintly annoyed and hard expression. People are looking.
“Would you like some tea maybe?” Mrs Wright asked. A tray floated to her and steaming tea poured itself into the two cups. Harry shook his head. Mrs Wright nodded and gestured at the chair opposite hers. “Please sit, Mr Potter.”
“Wanna fight, Ferret?” Ron’s face was red with anger. Harry grabbed him by the elbow as Malfoy brushed past.
“Well, dragons don’t talk, do they,” he said and Harry looked at him pointedly. Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, well, okay I do. But you can be one as well, if you want. With the condition that I’d be a cooler one of course. I’ll speak with fire.” He hissed threateningly and Harry snorted again.
"Fuck, everything is bollocks, everything going straight to hell, and I can't even bring myself to—" Malfoy was getting angrier and seemingly more confused with every second. As if he had the right to get fucking confused by the situation he created. "And the worst thing is you! You with your fucking— That I want to— To—!" he started to raise his voice.
When Hermione asked him why he was frowning for the third time that day, Harry sighed and asked if she was going to the library. She gave him her usual worried-exasperated expression and nodded.
They never talked these days. Not even to make the usual poisonous remarks. Harry's heart strangely fell out of rhythm on the thought. He made the remaining way to his usual place. Hermione was already there, buried in some massive book. She greeted him distractedly and Harry nodded. He swallowed the remaining lump in the throat and started to help himself with some toast.
In the next moment he lowered to his knees by the bed. Harry tried very hard not to flinch in surprise. Malfoy’s face was closer to Harry’s now and he could see such an open expression he was taken aback. His brows were furrowed and mouth turned down at the edges, pale skin contrasting to the shadows. He opened his mouth slightly.
Harry rolled his eyes at that but stepped away, glancing at Draco. He was watching Harry with an unreadable expression. Something akin to…wonder? He didn’t pay Ron any attention. Harry felt strangely flustered and looked away.
Malfoy was laying in the snow with his hands thrown open. Harry vaguely thought that that must be cold as hell but Malfoy didn’t seem to think that. Snowflakes seemed to melt fast on his slightly pink cheeks, Harry even could see snow on his eyelashes if he could fly a bit nearer…
How could he answer that? He didn’t know why. He couldn’t say that he just wanted to see Malfoy… Harry looked at the snow beneath the broom, there were deep tracks Malfoy left. For several seconds everything was quiet and Harry felt a searching look on his face but didn’t look up. Malfoy didn’t seem willing to break the silence first. Harry glanced at his legs in black trousers that were buried in snow.
Hermione ended up hugging him so tight he could hardly breathe. And even if she did cry she didn’t give it away (much) and Harry was grateful. He loved his friends but he couldn’t shake off a feeling that he was causing too much unnecessary worry for them. He wished he would listen to Malfoy talk about everything but Harry instead.
The hallway was rather dark and the emotion behind his eyes wasn’t clear. Harry stared back with a strange fascination of waiting to see what would happen next. Ron glanced at him and then back at Malfoy.
Malfoy bit his lip (oh Harry really shouldn't look there) and ran a hand through his hair. Then that strange determination fell all over his features again.
As they prepared for the night an almost palpable tension hung in the air. Harry could tell Ron was confused and annoyed at the new revelations. Harry sent him a sheepish smile. Malfoy didn’t really look at Harry, he went out of the door and returned at the usual ungodly hour. Harry felt him hesitate near Harry’s bed (Harry never closed the curtains for the night, it was too dark that way). Harry heard him sigh so quietly Harry half-suspected the sound wasn’t real.
Draco rolled his eyes but returned the grin. He was looking at hem with the same excitement Harry felt.
You stare as if you have no idea what I’m talking about, too. Then you look around slowly, the crowd around us started to resemble a circle of a proper audience now. Without looking at me you say:
They walked for a while in silence and the chilly weather. Draco stopped abruptly with a curious expression on his face. Harry stopped as well, glancing at him in question.
,” he looked pointedly at Harry, “didn’t bother to return my old wand, I, what, would go to Ollivander’s and buy myself a nice new one and all would be lovely? Well, too bad, the fucking Ministry gave me this useless piece of wood with tracking charms and all because they didn’t want a little
“I’m terribly sorry, Potter, I had an impression your attention was reserved for people well above my rank, all this lovely crowd around your shining frame?” I have no idea what I’m talking about. “Just lovely, this evening, isn’t it?”
“This autumn is surprisingly warm so far, isn’t it?” he murmured. “I always preferred the autumns of Wiltshire rather than how it is here. The sun there lasts longer. I remember it being warm till the second half of October.”
Harry just wanted to fly alone. He wasn’t entirely sure why he wouldn’t just say so to Ron. Maybe because Ron would go with him, and it was a fine concept but wasn’t something Harry wanted at the moment. As Harry was making his way through the castle in a quick pace, almost every student in his way made sure to greet him. He smiled back politely not changing the tempo.
He didn’t hear a word Professor McGonagall said. Headmistress McGonagall. Frankly, there were hardly any first year students this time. Maybe a few joined their table, but Harry hadn’t paid attention to the sorting. After a short time, he watched in a haze as the feast appeared before them, and at this sight his stomach rolled and clenched painfully. Somewhere to his left Ron reached for something and hesitated before helping himself to the smallest portion Harry had ever seen him put on the plate. He was pretty sure Hermione wasn’t eating either.
Harry made a step from the wall, getting angry now. There was some bitter disappointment somewhere inside him where he didn't want to look too closely right now.
There’s an awkward bit of just lips connected and then you draw away slowly, uncertainty drawing your brows in a frown. I blink at you, not knowing what just happened.
“I’m aware of your circumstances,” she said, and Harry looked away. “And you won’t have to speak until you’re comfortable doing so. For now, I just want to tell you about something that can help you understand what’s happening.”
Harry closed his eyes, trying to imagine a smaller Malfoy looking at the stars and getting lost in the height, up and up, so far no one could imagine going, and being scared of that. Harry smiled in spite of himself. It made sense. Harry had been scared of small places when he was a child.
“Harry— You, you’re not cursed are you?” she asked suddenly, quiet and still not looking at him. At Harry’s other side, Ron listened intently. Harry blinked a few times and shook his head, looking at each of them in turn. Ron was frowning suspiciously and Hermione’s eyes were desperate.
“I heard you aren’t talking,” Malfoy said abruptly and Harry turned to him. His brows were slightly furrowed and he wasn’t looking at Harry.
“Does Malfoy study in the library?” he asked Hermione in the common room. She was reading a charms textbook and startled in the chair, looking up. Harry realised he hadn’t talked since the morning.
"What did you do?" Harry scowled, he felt like there was something and he probably wouldn't like it.
“Ok, I’ll see you in the morning.” She smiled at them and headed to the girl’s dormitory to the right.
A good thing I hate the whole world that revolves around you. I’m not a part of it. I proved as much, remember? I wonder if I’m going to throw up the second I’m out of everybody’s line of view, out of this farce. The charity event, they said, in the remembrance of the war, they said. The attendance is compulsory, said my home arrest. And a good punishment that is, too. Looking at you over there, surrounded by the unwanted people but staring at me as if—
Harry stared. Something hot rushed over him at the sound of his name. It really shouldn’t have sounded so new when Malfoy said it, he heard his name all the time. Hermione said it constantly, with concern most of the time, or sympathy or exasperation. Ron said it with delight or excitement or alarm. But Draco never called him Harry of all things and now it felt strangely intimate to hear that. His name sounded almost tender, Harry realised.
Some level of calmness finally took place from the familiar feeling of flying. Harry looked around for a figure but all he could see was snow. So he flew in the vague direction he saw Malfoy on the map. He took a little higher to see the ground better.
Ron and Hermione were still walking on eggshells around him. Harry finally decided he needed to do at least something. He went with Hermione to the library and wrote her a note. He had trouble picking the words but eventually handed it to her.
Harry couldn’t fully process this new information. There was a name to the thing he felt? It was apparently a medical thing with symptoms. Was he sick? Would it happen again? Harry felt a wave of fear wash over him at the possibility. He looked at Malfoy again, alarmed.
“What?” He asked quietly and Harry turned his head to look at him because he expected something more cruel and snarky.
He returned to that classroom in the evening after dinner. He told Ron and Hermione that he was going to the dorm early. They hadn’t seemed concerned. Harry suspected they wanted some time together. He didn’t mind.
“Okay, if you say so, Harry,” he said. Then looked at Malfoy with narrowed eyes. “Don’t expect any gratitude from me, though, Ferret.”
Harry didn’t moved though, he was supposed to be asleep anyway and what was his concern even if Malfoy had come here to steal medicines? Harry would tell Madam Pomfrey in the morning if it was something important.
After a couple of days at breakfast, Harry tried to wake up properly with the help of a cup of tea. His eyes were on the Slytherin table, as it later became his habit (again), where Malfoy just arrived. Harry lazily thought that it would be great to go flying again today and that Malfoy looked more tired than yesterday. He sipped the tea and glanced at Hermione and Ron who just sat at the table — Ron still yawning and with sleep dishevelled hair, Hermione as collected as always. She smiled at Harry.
Something bumped into his right shoulder, cutting off the train of thought, which was unpleasant. Harry blinked and turned.
The snowfall wasn’t bad, but it was dark, as they came here only after their lessons. Malfoy cast some charm on the snow so that they could sit on it without falling through. Harry’s Firebolt was at his right arm. It was rather awkward for him to always hover in place because Malfoy never took a broom and Harry didn’t ask again if they could fly. He was beginning to enjoy these short meetings even without flying. As it appeared, watching snow was rather calming.
“Of course, ‘Mione, I’ll be just fine.” He met her gaze stubbornly, crossing his arms over his chest.
“And what the fuck are scum like you doing in here? Hasn’t your daddy got himself into Azkaban already for messing with us? Wanna follow in his steps, little Death Eater?” There was a shallow thud of a punch, followed by a groan.
The noise coming from the bushes on the edge of the clearing reached Harry and he turned, opening his eyes. All the colours were too faded and grey after the warmth of the sun under the eyelids, and Harry blinked several times. He smiled the moment he recognised the coming figure.
Hot hands went for his hair and Harry found a moment to realize that he’d always imagined them to be cold but they weren’t. Teeth closed on his bottom lip and Harry made a little sound he didn't know he was capable of making.
“Damn mate, that was scary as hell. We thought something awful had happened.” He sounded concerned and a touch suspicious. Harry felt a small wave of frustration. Hadn’t that been ‘awful’ enough? He dismissed the thought. Ron probably didn’t want to mean it like that.
Harry’s first thought was that he was drunk, but he didn’t sound drunk. He sounded like he was in pain. The fall couldn’t be that bad, Harry thought. He wanted to turn his head and look through the curtain. He didn’t move.
like myself walking the halls of this lovely school armed, you see. So yes, my fucking wand is in the dorm because it’s
You drift closer with every minute, unnoticeable, in the stream of people surrounding you. I can’t tear my eyes away even to check who’s near me. It’s darker here, in my corner. I hope you’ll enjoy it, that spotlight seems to be very tiring for you to bear for long.
He stormed out of the common room. It had been four days and he was going mad. Ron and Hermione treated him as if he would break any time they spoke too harsh or let Ron beat him in chess. Harry scoffed under his breath. The look of pity in their eyes reminded him every time that something was wrong with him, and he hated this feeling. He just wanted to be normal again.
"Malfoy!" The strange thing was, Harry couldn't believe he hadn't been saying this name all the time, it felt so familiar and easy to say. Even if earlier it was with nothing but dislike to it.
“There’s a fire dragon behind us,” he whispered. “It will burn me alive, I can feel it close, breathing with smoke. I want it closer.”
Malfoy didn’t stop to frown and looked around them. The forest nearby was still sinking in shadows, and Harry only now noticed that the sunny day was only within the clearing, while the grey sky hung low above the trees. Everything now was almost perfectly quiet, the leaves trembled in the crowns, but the sound was not reaching the only visitors of the forest. A gentle breeze was wondering through a clearing that Harry didn’t feel, but saw the stir of the grass and light moving of the platinum hair of Draco.
We stand on the balcony for a minute, staring at the dark garden spreading below. Warm yellow light from the party washing our backs, muffled noise of conversations feels so very far away. This balcony is a place in-between two real worlds, not quite in either of them. I glance at you and think “
“Yes, I do remember. But I think we should ask him when he’s awake and not make any harsh assumptions,” Hermione said.
Harry flinched and felt the urge to turn around and go for the castle before he got noticed. He remembered uneasily the last time he watched Malfoy when no one had been supposed to. He really really should just turn and fly away. Right now.
"Malfoy! What the fuck are you on about?!" Harry took a step further without realizing until the moment those grey eyes shot to his with visible distress written all over them. He didn't understand anything.
“Hi Hermione. I’m sorry I wasn’t here earlier. One of the girls from my year almost fainted as we got close to the castle. I had to go with her to Madam Pomfrey.” Ginny dropped her eyes. “Her sister died in the battle.”
Harry held on to him, Malfoy surprisingly steady on his feet. He was so warm. And Harry was freezing. Malfoy’s hands tightened around him. And it felt just like the hug from Mrs. Weasley after the night Cedric had died. It felt so good to feel someone so close and take a bit of comfort from them. Harry inhaled shakily and recognised that smell from days before. Clean and sharp and mostly
As soon as he walked into the common room alone (Malfoy said he wanted to talk to Madam Pomfrey more) he saw Ron and Hermione sitting together closely on a couch, deep in conversation. A couple of Ravenclaw girls were chatting on the other side of the common room. It was relatively early Monday morning and breakfast hadn’t started yet. The room seemed quite cozy with the light streaming in from the circle of glass in the ceiling. Hermione noticed Harry and leaped to her feet.
“Harry,” Draco said suddenly, with surprise. “I guess you’re ‘Harry’ now, aren’t you. That’s strange. Harry.” He looked thoughtful but kind of pleased.
“I’m Muggleborn, you see, I always was interested in Psychology. For some time I lived mostly in the Muggle world, although I always loved magic.” Harry couldn’t help but understand what she meant. He glanced at all the things still arranging themselves around the room.
Harry stopped at the door to their room. He was just going in for the night, wandering later than usual. He was in a better mood after the walk in the night air, had evening listening to Malfoy, who had apparently started his project in Potions and was intent on developing his own novel draught. He wouldn’t shut up about the wonders of Porcupine quills (at Harry’s blank stare he sighed dramatically, “
Harry waved his hand, “No-no, it’s really nothing, I know what to write and will do it at lunch break.”
“Harry!” She was before him in a moment, hugging him tightly. He hugged her back, feeling better from her familiar embrace. She leaned back and looked him in the eye. “Are you all right?”
Then he stood for a while, breathing deep with closed eyes. Malfoy was all blue-grey and almost glowing for some reason, so far from the darkness under Harry’s eyelids. Harry watched him as he just stood there some feet away.
Harry learned two things that evening: the brightest star in the Draco constellation was called Eltanin and Draco Malfoy talked a lot.
He was nearly growling now, closer and closer, taking Harry's face into his hands, grey eyes growing darker, becoming the shade of the stormy cloud, one that seems so heavy with rain it feels almost dangerous. The danger was so obvious, so sharp and fresh, Harry felt alive with the energy, he hadn't felt that way for a long time.
Oh... I search frantically in my mind for even one instance to prove that wrong. The Hogwarts Express (I broke your nose), Myrtle’s bathroom (you sliced me up)... There have to be something else!
You stare at me with a strange expression. Cruel, I notice, oh well... Cruel was always a bit of a my thing.
Malfoy grimaced and kept quiet for a while. It was obvious he didn’t want to talk about it and Harry felt awkward for asking. He of all people should have to understand a person who didn’t want to talk about something personal, for god’s sake.
“I think the school will absolutely need a mind healer this year, just for some therapy. It's always a good thing, you know, Harry?”
Malfoy turned around… and fell in the snow with his back first. Harry’s breath caught, but he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes closed and he would say something at least if he saw him there, wouldn’t he? Wait, what was Malfoy doing in the snow?
“I’m sorry for the mess, Mr Potter, I’m afraid I haven’t yet unpacked everything, it will be done in a second.” She walked past him, weaving her wand to levitate a stack of books and send them neatly onto the shelves. She then turned to Harry and smiled apologetically. He hesitantly smiled back.
“I’m meeting with Ron tomorrow and I don’t know when we’ll meet later. I’ll owl you as soon as I can. Will you be okay?”
Harry opened the door, and they immediately turned to him. Ron’s wand was in his hand and Malfoy had a look of cold fury melting into surprise when he looked at Harry. Ron’s expression flicked with concern but he didn’t lower his wand.
It was a feeling strangely welcoming, in a way that was never fully understood. Nonetheless, it kept coming.
He didn’t answer. Malfoy waited for a bit, as if hoping for Harry to rise the bait, and then rolled his eyes, holding his wand to him. Harry took it. It was probably the closest he’ll get to gratitude from Malfoy.
"See you all later," he didn't want to wait for their expressions of confusion, so he just turned away towards Malfoy again. The moment Harry was on his feet, the blonde strode to the exit from the Hall, not waiting for him to follow. Harry's heart picked up the speed the same way as his feet did to keep up.
Malfoy never seemed surprised and they didn’t even talk sometimes. Malfoy asked him the third time Harry flew to him on the broom how Harry could know he was there every time.
Harry came closer and stopped several feet before them. He could now see Malfoy, just laying there and not moving. He felt a cold rage going through him in a wave. He looked at the shocked boys.
Harry took a few steps forward, noticing a look of brief confusion flash across Malfoy’s face. Then Harry turned and stood between them, stepping in front of Draco and facing Ron, trying to communicate with a frown how he felt. Ron’s wand wavered and he lowered it, opening his mouth slightly in shock.
"Okay, I'll tell you." Harry crossed his arms on the chest, partly to hide his surprise, "I assure you it's not something dangerous."
Something hit Harry in the chest, leaving him sharply exhaling. And he remembered with a somehow familiar shock of recognition. This is a dream. The excitement shot through him and Harry shivered. Their meeting. Harry wiped away the last shock (he would never get used to the feeling of sharp transition from the dream to the realisation of that dream) and new hungrily inspected Malfoy (no,
Harry walked into the Great Hall to the hum of conversations and clicking of dishes with food, the warmth of it and a delicious smell. He didn't notice any of it.
My knees feel weak when I taste you. You’re hot and wet and forceful and I think I’ll taste this kiss for weeks. Your tongue slides into my mouth, your hands into my hair, ruining them, ruining me. Fuck.
I’m a bit at a loss for what to say in return. My tongue goes heavy and the only thought circulating in my head is “this is some surreal shit right here.”
There was an understanding pause and Harry almost smiled bitterly. Yeah, that’s what it was. Almost all of them felt the presence of grief, hiding between the lines spoken and looks thrown at each other. The usually cheerful atmosphere of the first Feast was ever so slightly off. The grey enchanted sky shimmered in confusion at the students.
“It has to be Dumbledore,” said Blaise, and Harry found himself agreeing. In no universe would it have been from the Dursleys, and Harry highly doubted that Professor Lupin would have the funds, and as much as Professor McGonagall liked him, he did play for an opposing team. Maybe it came from Snape, he thought wryly before laughing a little at that absurd idea.
Nevillle was trying to remember what he had forgotten when Harry spotted Draco walking up behind him, and snatched the Remembrall out of Neville’s hand.
“To Hogsmeade,” said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger. “There are seven in all.” They then laid out all the passageways. The ones that Filch knew about and the ones that only they knew about. Including one that led right into Honeyduke’s cellar.
Sirius was looking back to normal, and if the way Mrs. Zabini was looking at him, quite devastatingly handsome. “You know, if it wasn’t painfully obvious that your godfather was completely owned by Mr. Lupin you and Blaise might have had a chance to become more than friends.”
Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.
Turning away, then back he had to clasp his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed—for he had seen not
“Hagrid,” said Harry, the same time Malfoy made to say something. Malfoy backed down sensing Harry was thinking the same thing as he was. “What if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?”
Then she pointed to the side where Sirius was transforming and Remus was leading the “dog” in a series of tricks and the two girls were laughing hysterically. “Two and Three.”
“I thought you’d be busy with the team? And Wood, too. I didn’t think professional athletes took breaks.”
“…he’s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury like this...” he gave a huge, fake sigh…” who knows if my arm’ll ever be the same again?”
Best, sweet, dangerous, forbidden and desirable. So, so needed, it hurt. It would never be his. Never could and never will. The golden light of the sunset cut his closing eyes, looking disappointed in him the way his best friends were. He closed his eyes anyway because Malfoy was kissing him still.
“Yeah, maybe but I didn’t realise that while I dreamt, did I?” Harry grinned a bit nervously. Now with the more clearer mind, he remembered why exactly he didn’t like this place.
Harry hesitated. He could swear he heard voices. He scanned the room one more time carefully, frowning. Something felt off but he couldn’t say what and he wasn’t sure he wanted to worry his friends more.
Harry moved his head away and tried the handle. When the door didn’t budge, he murmured, “Alahomora,” and it clicked open quietly. He opened the door a tiny bit, trying to see something through the gap. His heart raced.
“Don’t make me repeat myself. If I ever see this shit again, you’ll be out of Hogwarts sooner than you can ‘sorry’, do you understand?” The two boys looked guiltily at each other, and Harry continued, “I didn’t go through all of the trouble of killing Voldemort just to let even more suffering happen in these walls. I’m disgusted to see my house colours on your robes.”
A strange nervousness was taking hold of Harry as the morning went by and the lunch break came nearer. It was the last days before the Christmas break so the classes were more or less relaxed, students were excited about the holidays and spending time talking with friends about their plans. But now Harry just thought about flying and definitely not about how Malfoy’s face looked that day under the snow.
Every night Harry looked at the ceiling for hours, listening to his roommates breathe. Ron would occasionally stir and sometimes jerk awake after a nightmare. If this happened, Harry would sit up and conjure him some water with a calming charm on it. He tried not to hear Ron’s heavy breathing and occasional muttering of Fred’s name. After Ron would quickly fall asleep, Harry stared up some more, searching the shadows for something and never finding it. Waiting for the door to open.
Harry startled so badly he almost fell from his boom, pulling the handle up too fast. But he regained his balance fast and looked down at Malfoy, who was now sitting upright and staring at him without a bit of surprise. Harry felt his cheeks go hot.
Harry swallowed. He really shouldn't, it would be so stupid to lose himself again, and he must hear what's happening, he couldn't give up so easily, to let Malfoy kiss him again—
Malfoy stood after a couple of seconds and there came a familiar tumbling into the bed. Then everything was quiet.
Sometimes he would ask Harry something like, “Potter, have you noticed the new garden in the Middle Courtyard?” Harry hadn’t. “Of course you haven’t, you’re such an inattentive oaf sometimes, really. There’s some Blue Flyeating Heather and it’s so fascinating!”
“Glad to hear that I was such a threat,” Harry glared at him. Then Malfoy looked forward again with a serious expression. “I did like flying. Quite a bit.”
He tried to remember how he’d gotten here, but the only thing that came to mind was Malfoy tugging him along, not looking at him. Everything was a blur. He thought he remembered Pomfrey’s concerned face and her soothing words about some Calming Draft. Harry felt heavy now, ready to fall back asleep. He heard hushed voices nearby though, and concentrated on them.
Malfoy started coughing and Harry didn’t like the sound of it one bit. He flinched, looked around for some rubbish on the floor. He found an old quill, quickly transfiguring it into a cup and casting an Aguamenti. He held it out to Malfoy, half expecting for him to knock it out of his hands. But he sat up and took it, not looking at Harry. His hands shook violently, spilling some water on the floor. Harry sat back and waited. He had no idea what to say.
He started making his way to his place at the Gryffindor table with a wave of students like him, his mind deliciously blank. This morning was just the right amount of empty, exactly the way he liked it, full of automatic familiar motions and some greeting through the throat that was refusing to speak more than three words at a time. Harry reckoned it was Sunday. A small glimpse of disappointment shot through his mind at the thought that tomorrow was Monday already. It was familiar and fleeing. He really--
“Yes, you did! Malfoy, what the hell,” you laugh. “I should’ve known, really! Ginny was awkward then, sure, but she wouldn’t have written me a song that was that awful! What was it? Something how my eyes are like a frog? Oh my god.” You laugh harder and I think I’ve never heard anything more amazing.
He made his way out and into the cool evening air. The sun was just beginning to set and the sky was slightly pink on the west side. He breathed deeply and went out onto the grounds that were mostly deserted at this hour.
For a moment Malfoy looked at him with an unreadable expression. Then he turned to him and made a step, hesitated, turned away, cursed and looked in Harry’s direction again. After another handful of seconds he made his way to Harry’s bed quickly. Harry lowered his eyelids to appear sleeping, his heart racing and thoughts confused. He still saw Malfoy coming near.
Then Madam Pomfrey’s door clicked open and she appeared, briskly awake and wearing her usual uniform. Harry sat up as she noticed them. He waited for a look of surprise and maybe outrage on seeing Malfoy there. But she just acknowledged him and Harry with a nod.
Malfoy did smile at that, just with one corner of his mouth and so quickly Harry felt that he wasn’t supposed to notice.
“I need a drink.” And then you’re moving past me, for some reason brushing my elbow when you didn’t have to do that, at all, frankly.
When he came to the spot where No. 11 and No. 13 stood side by side, he took a few steps back and stared at the space in between, repeating the address in his head as he’d been advised. Soon enough, the two houses shifted apart and Grimmauld place sat snuggly between. Taking a deep breath, he walked up the steps but before he could ring the bell, the door swung open to reveal a panting Potter.
“Do tell Luna to join me for tea one day. I miss listening to her talks.” his mother said with a fond smile.
Out loud Draco said, “Well this was fun, but I should be getting home now.” Potter bit his lip and looked as if he wanted to say something and Draco waited patiently.
“You came!” he said with all the excitement of a child on Christmas morning and Draco was momentarily stunned.
Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him along as he rushed after the children. “Here’s the plan. We find some eggs, eat some chocolate, get the kids home and in bed in less than ten minutes, and then…” He leant in so that he could whisper huskily into his ear. “You’re all mine.”
fairly trying, having to fit my head in next to Pansy’s fat one…” Blaise began with a sly grin and then cut the call.
“That was pretty nice,” Ginny said as they exited his room. “I’ve never really seen how you behave in front of your friends. For some reason, I used to think you all just sat around morosely when you were alone together.”
“Relax, Malfoy,” Potter laughed. “I meant that sometimes I stay back at the Academy to get in some more duelling practice. Or I go out late with Gin and the others.”
Her eyes widened a fraction and she motioned for him to bring it to her. He watched nervously as she pulled out the robin egg blue cashmere scarf he’d picked out for her, wondering belatedly if he should have stuck with the silver one instead. However, his fears fell away completely when her face lit up in pure delight.
Potter gave a dismissive wave. “It’s already been a year now. I can truthfully say I’ve gotten over it. Though,” he had a self-deprecating smile on his face now, “I sometimes wonder if I’d married Ginny just because it was expected. Not to say that I didn’t love Ginny, because I did, but I’ve always wanted a family and the closest I’ve had is the Weasleys. Being with Ginny felt so
and it seemed to be crashing about in an almost frantic manner. Draco wasn’t taking any chances, especially with the children around, so he quickly (and effectively) pulled out his wand, pointing it in the direction of the sound. Lily had stilled and tightly wrung her arms around Draco’s neck. James too had ceased in his prattling and huddled closer to Draco, while Al seemed to have woken up fully and was tensed up with a hand gripping his shirt tightly. They all waited in silence. There was more rustling and then through the bushes came a –
in front of Potter! You know how I feel when it comes to him!” Draco blinked as he registered his own words. He really didn’t know why he was so angry, but the thought that Potter was most probably with his friends right now, no doubt having a good laugh over poor, jobless, weak Draco Malfoy, was enough to make him want to scream.
?” Now Potter looked a bit too pleased with himself for Draco’s liking. Very well then, two could play at this game.
Draco had no idea what a battery was but he nodded nonetheless. “I’ll start juicing it up then. It’s best done bit by bit or the toy could get damaged, especially if it hasn’t been used in a long time.”
Potter choked. On what, Draco had no idea but he choked nonetheless. “Easy Potter. I warned you beforehand, didn’t I? And anyways, that isn’t really all that shocking. The son was quite the piece of arse. Honestly, if I’d known Blaise was shagging him that summer, I’d have asked him if he was willing to share.”
Ginny whooped loudly and gave Potter a comradely smack on the back that made him take a step forward.
Draco blinked. Surely he’d heard that wrong. “A lily fell in a hole?” he asked slowly. The boy nodded vigorously. Well, apparently he hadn’t misheard it.
“Bad communication,” Ginny repeated. “You two really need to sort out a couple of things, so I’ll leave you to it.” She made it halfway to the door before she turned around again. “Oh, and just to be clear, I’m dating Neville, not Harry.” And then she was gone.
“We can invite Pansy and Blaise over too, if you want,” Harry continues slowly. “She and ‘Mione have apparently become best friends ever since they went shopping together that one time.”
“I came here for some supplies a couple of weeks ago and Bob was the one at the counter. He didn’t know who I was either but this other customer came up to me and asked for my autograph.” Potter let out a resigned sigh. “Bob asked me if I was a celebrity or something and the witch who I’d given the autograph took it upon herself to relate my entire life story to him.”
From what Draco could remember Potter telling him, it was Muggle but quaint and intimate. Ginny would love it.
At this point Draco thought it best to get to his feet. He moved Hugo to his shoulders and stood, Lily still nestled against him. The Weasley brood stared at him and truth be told, it was rather terrifying. Just when he thought the room couldn’t get more oppressing though, Harry stalked in.
“I didn’t know how to bring it up,” Potter whined, embarrassment colouring his features. “It’s not like I have any experience dating blokes.”
The Snitch still hadn’t made an appearance and forty five minutes had already elapsed. The two teams had managed to remain more or less tied in points, but Bill’s team was now beginning to creep ahead. He and Angelina were proving to work startlingly well together, while Weasley was an immovable rock in front of the hoops. Charlie was doing fairly alright considering he’d never played Keeper before, but he had next to nothing on his brother.
Draco nodded mutely, suddenly feeling like an idiot. “Well, you dated in sixth year, didn’t you? And after the War too.”
“Do you fancy him?” she asked bluntly, and if Draco hadn’t already been seated, he might have fallen over.
century and has been in the family for centuries. You can’t just discard such a valuable part of our heritage–”
“Good afternoon Harry. I was just asking your friend here if he was feeling alright.” Mrs Spencer interjected. “He’s suddenly not looking too well.”
. He rolled over onto his back and spit out a large clump of grass and soil, fervently praying that none of his teeth had been knocked out by the fall.
“Wouldn’t that make a good story for the papers? The Boy-who-killed-You-know-who, finally done in by a bit of risqué gossip. Skeeter would have a field day.”
Harry’s seeker skills certainly come in handy as he dives onto the ground after the snake, snatching at its tail and swinging it off the ground with a triumphant cry.
They’d reached the gates now and as they stepped through them, Draco felt his nerves coming back to him. Pretty soon he’d be faced with a houseful of Weasleys, not to mention Harry would be there.
It was a handsome piece of furniture, made of a dark rich wood that had been lovingly worked over using magic until it was covered in dainty carvings. A figurine of a fairy sat prettily at the top centre, her slender legs curled over the surface of the mirror, and even now she was scrunching her nose up in disgust.
“You haven’t finished up with the library either,” she continued, warming up now. Draco could practically smell the lecture coming up.
Draco still hadn’t quite come to grips with what had just happened, and he remained silent. Luckily, his mother had her wits about her, ever the dignified Malfoy matriarch, and could answer instead.
He wanted to lean into the man sitting so vulnerably before him, wide-eyed and unsuspecting. He wanted to bridge the scant gap between them and really take this ‘second chance’ to a whole new level, and he was about to do just that when he suddenly remembered why they’d been talking about second chances in the first place.
“I would not, as a matter of fact.” Draco shuddered at the very thought. “It would mean the day wasn’t completely unique to me.”
!” Draco stared at Potter in disbelief. “No, that isn’t possible. You’re such an utter Gryffindor, it makes my teeth ache.”
It all sounded like gibberish to Draco and he didn’t ask any more questions for fear of looking like a fool. Instead he contented himself with playing with Lily whilst Potter made polite conversation with some Muggle woman who sat next to him. The bint didn’t seem to understand that Potter obviously didn’t want to speak to her, batting her eyelashes in a sickly sweet manner. Potter shifted uncomfortably next to him and Draco almost wished the She-weasel was here to put her in her place. The strange thing was, Potter never once told her he was married and surely when faced with unwanted flirtations, anyone would brandish a wedding ring like a battle axe. Come to think of it, Potter wasn’t even wearing his ring in the first place!
It was late when they finally said their goodbyes and Teddy had long since fallen asleep on the couch. Draco helped carry him to his room and ended up tucking the boy in alongside his aunt. Then he side-alonged his mother back to the Manor. They had hardly been there five seconds before his mother pounced.
,” Draco gasps out when he pulls away. “I thought you were dead, Harry, and I didn’t know what to do. I don’t– I can’t–” Draco takes a shaky breath. “If you died, I don’t think I could–” Harry cuts him off with another kiss, feeling like the worst possible berk ever.
Draco recoiled in revulsion, practically choking on his disgust. His wand was in hand with a flick of his wrist, and he would have assuredly ended up in Azkaban that very day if another voice hadn’t spoken up indignantly.
“She speaks highly of you,” he went on, studying Draco as if he was some sort of tricky curse that he just had to
A shimmering silver swan flew past him, gracefully circling the room once before disappearing through the wall. He closed his eyes, the sight of the familiar Patronus calming him almost instantly. When he’d been a child, the swan had sometimes sung him to sleep, those times when Narcissa was busy elsewhere but somehow knew exactly when she was needed.
“Better close your mouth before you catch flies Malfoy.” Potter’s teasing voice made Draco close his mouth with a snap.
“Ginny, that’s enough,” Draco interjected sharply before Pansy could say anything. “You may know my situation but you don’t know theirs, so kindly refrain from antagonizing Pansy. She’s still one of my closest friends alongside Blaise.”
“Perfect conditions for flying,” she remarked, turning her face up to look at the clear sky with nary a cloud in sight. “We’ve been sitting down on our arses for too long and I feel stiff. Fancy a flight? I’ll even let you use my usual broom while I take the old one.”
They sat in silence for a bit, but Harry didn’t think Malfoy was waiting for an answer. It didn’t feel like it, and Harry liked the feeling. The last light of the settled sun was starting to dissolve and he felt a chilly wind through the warming charm.
Harry didn’t know how to answer that. A prickle of irritation went through his stomach and he thought about biting something in response but then he noticed something. Even though Malfoy appeared annoyed as always, he seemed much softer than he usually would. His shoulders were relaxed and eyes clear, and he hadn’t stormed off yet for some reason. Harry tilted his head.
And this part was the best. Or maybe it was not, Harry could never say for sure, couldn't he? There was nothing to describe, to feel or comprehend. And this was what Harry liked. For some time there wasn't anything left, not even the self-consciousness. And that was beautiful.
“It doesn’t matter, I’m here now. Why would you dream of the Forbidden Forest?’ He frowned a bit but not enough for that little line between his eyebrows that Harry knew well to form.
Harry was spending breakfast as usual: staring at Draco Malfoy and trying not to notice anything about him (he failed, of course). Malfoy had been avoiding him the past few days and was now sitting with his back to the Gryffindor table. Harry still found the brisk morning light illuminating his hair quite fascinating.
Of course it was Malfoy. Because it was Harry’s life, how could it not be him? At least Ron would still be with him Although, Ron didn’t seem really happy about it. He moaned loudly and broke into an angry tirade about his luck and damned blond gits. Harry couldn’t help but feel better at that; at this pace, Ron would soon be his old self again. They would be sharing their room with Neville and a Hufflepuff, Wayne Hopkins, with whom Harry never spoke before.
With a last glance at McGonagall, he went inside, looking around. The room was well-lit and broad, done in woody colours. There was a big desk with two chairs opposite each other. Some things were floating out of bags and finding a right place to settle.
After a while of Harry definitely not staring at Malfoy, the patch of light moved and fell right in Malfoy’s face. Harry had a moment to notice how his eyelashes seemed to glow white under it before Malfoy stirred, grimacing slightly, and then opened his eyes. Harry’s heart caught and he looked at the door to Pomfrey’s cabinet. He still saw as Malfoy blinked a few times, rubbed at his eyes and undoubtedly looked in Harry’s direction. Harry felt his cheeks go warm.
Ginny was talking about the next Quidditch game against Ravenclaws or something, Harry wasn't listening. His attention wasn't needed anyway, because Ron was engaged in the chat so much that it could compensate Harry's and Hermione's absence. It was nearly time to go.
"I'm really... The truth is—" He was seemingly fighting for the words, so quiet, but Harry felt them on his lips, somehow he didn't want to open his eyes just yet. "Oh, Harry."
The birds sang something to each other from opposite sides of the lake, something quick and light, echoing in the air. They could fly to be closer.
When Draco opened his mouth to say something, Harry leaned in and kissed him. He liked when Draco talked, but this was better. He felt warm all over in spite of the cold wind. Draco leaned in and kissed back with a quiet moan, Harry felt another hot wave rushing through and curling somewhere in his stomach at the feeling of Draco’s tentative tongue.
At some point during the feast, Harry felt someone sit down close to him. He jerked back out of nothing and turned. It was Ginny, with much shorter hair and tired eyes, as warm and familiar as ever. She smiled at him timidly and turned back to the food, filling her plate. Harry realised he hadn’t even noticed her. The uncomfortable thought at the very back of his mind said, ‘
The holidays went by too quickly for Harry’s liking. The morning after everyone had returned he was restless at the Gryffindor table. They couldn’t meet the previous evening and Harry couldn’t wait to see Draco again, he got rather used to him during the holidays. Instead of constantly glancing at the entrance, Harry tried to concentrate on the story Ron was telling him about something featuring Percy and his new girlfriend. Hermione was looking at Harry curiously.
It seemed, he was doing nothing at all. He just laid there and Harry couldn’t see his face. Was it some kind of a trap? Harry still held his breath, afraid to ruin the silence of the snow. After a handful of seconds of stillness, Harry lowered the broom some more.
Madam Pomfrey was nodding. “Yes, Mr. Malfoy, thank you.” Harry turned to her, and she shook her head at Malfoy disapprovingly but good-naturedly, then smiled at Harry. “It’s ok, with the calming potion I’ll give you it’s not going to be that bad. You can also use it to fall asleep easier. Although, please, no more than three days in a row, this potion can be a bit addictive.”
“And yet you ran from my Mark when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky. Yes, I know about that. You have disappointed me. I expect more from faithful servants in the future.”
Harry looked out of the corner of his eye, and finally noticed Remus glance their way. The man was still laughing at Sirius’ antics, but his eyes were trained on Harry, assessing the conversation that was going on between him and Mrs. Zabini.
Next, Bill, the other brother, got to his feet smiling. Harry knew from Ron that Bill worked for the Wizarding Bank Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at Hogwarts, but where Harry had always thought Bill would be just an older version of Ron’s other brother Percy, fussy and law abiding, Bill Weasley looked down right illegal.
“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said Ron defensively. “An ordinary or common garden rat like this can’t be expected to live longer than three years or so, but if you were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of these.”
Fred, finally, looked over at the Slytherin table, and Millicent forgot her breakfast and looked back at him. Almost daring him to keep going.
Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagrid sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon, hope, happiness, the desire to survive, but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.”
“You---Potter---why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? You almost make me consider taking points from my own house, perhaps we can move you in with Longbottom and we can solve both our problems.”
He wasted no more time after that, jumping into the water then diving under. He stayed under for so long that Harry thought that he might have to dive in after him, at least to get his egg back. But just as Harry was about to do just that. Draco popped back up. But didn’t say anything.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?” He was headed down the hall fielding Malfoy’s remarks when he heard someone else call his name.
“You’d have to paint me with sleeves,” said Draco. “Or are you planning on Granger burning me with her eyes or somewhat? I can’t say I’d be pleased, but it would make the piece more interesting.
Ron seized his knife, pulled Malfoy’s roots toward him, and began to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.
“An’ now e’s out,” said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of Black’s gaunt face again. “Never been a breakout from Azkaban before, ‘as there, Ern? Beats me ‘ow ‘e did it. Frightenin’, eh? Mind, I don’t fancy ‘is chances against them Azkaban guards eh, Ern?”
Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats. Harry would miss the silver and green scarf he had so often worn this year. He would have no need of it this summer. Finally, they pulled into the platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
“Yes,” said Lupin. “I thought it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. I was worried about it for a few people, but yes….”
And just like that Professor Lupin’s chances of getting someone to volunteer improved dramatically. Harry didn’t know if Lucius Malfoy was still on Draco about Hermione out scoring him, but Draco’s ears did perk up at the words “extra credit”. Blaise, too, was gazing at the pop up pond interestingly. Harry didn’t really need the extra points in Defense, but he did like Professor Lupin and knew that if he volunteered that some of the others might do so too out of pure spite.
“That doesn’t mean that you don’t love him.” Please mean that you love me, Harry prayed. Harry watched as tears came to his mate’s eyes that little Rose reached up and wiped away.
He was tall, like Ron, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail. He was wearing an ear ring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. He looked like he had just come from a rock concert, with leather, no, dragon hide boots, too.
Harry pushed his bangs out of his eyes. He was already sweating in this suit Sirius’ had insisted he wear. People respect a well-dressed wizard.
“Yes,” said Hermione proudly. “I’ve decided to call it SPEW. The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and the first step is making clothes.”
The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows.
We are being taught an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history wizarding or Muggle will show how impermanent both the choices and prejudices must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought already laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system. And those of us who are more robust,” she eyed Zabini like Pansy eyes third years in last seasons’ robes.
Harry was about to pull his wand from his bag when the shutters on the windows banged shut, and the not so pretty in pink professor waltzed into the room.
“I did always say you were a bad influence,” Millicent said, sitting down beside Blaise, and patting his cheek lovingly.
“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies, no use here of course, too many students lying about why they didn’t do their homework. That mirror is my Foe Glass. See them sulking around in there, well I’m not really in trouble until I can see the whites of their eyes.”
“Did you see how I took out that Kappa?” Crabbe asked Tracey Davis. And Harry wondered not for the first time if Crabbe was sweet on the snobby girl.
Finally, Harry decided to just try opening the egg while he was in the water. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom and he quickly closed it so as not to attract Filch. Wouldn’t that be awkward?
And like all the other pieces of soulmate information that Draco knew and collected through his life, he knew this, that true soulmates, that two people who loved each other equally would never be rid of their marks by accident or design, even if one had it burned off. The mark was there and served the purpose that it always did, it said that Harry was his, and that Draco, that Draco was always and would always be Harrys.
“I know Eloise to be a very respectable kind of girl. So, I’m not too sure if I believe you, Zabini.”
Keep your eyes open, particularly around certain other headmasters, and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble. For the love of all that is holy keep yourself out of trouble before I have a panic attack.
“What do you know, Potter,” snarled Snape. “Everyone from the Minister of Magic down is trying to keep the famous Harry Potter safe from Sirius Black but famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself. Let the ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences.” Snape seemed genuinely angry so Harry stayed silent.
Harry knew it was cold for a reason. The whole portion of the wall farthest from the entrance and part of the ceiling was nothing but fortified glass. The lake filled with algae and water plants bloomed, but Harry was sure if he looked down that he still wouldn’t be able to see the bottom. The room was magnificent and ornate, every surface looked like something out of one of aunt Petunia’s regency romance novels.
Harry gathered his things. Lupin clearly didn’t want to talk about it, but Harry did. “I’m getting better, I think,” he said as they walked toward the door.
Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed the door --- and it was locked.
“Lie still for a moment,” Dumbledore said. Harry looked to the hill behind them where Karkaroff was running toward them with alarming speed, clearly having been summoned by Dumbledore.
He raised his wand to cast something, anything that might save him, but then the dragon sat back on her haunches and she lowered her nose to the eggs, and touched the golden one. Then, it did the most remarkable thing. It nosed the golden egg right to Harry’s feet.
“It was a retirement present,” Harry defended. Then clearly pissed, “I don’t understand that,” and alarm bells started to go off inside Draco’s head. “You’re my best friend. We spend nearly every day together and you’re telling me that you don’t think you mean more to me than our old librarian?”
Her shoulders lowered and her gaze turned away from Harry’s. Yes, it was the wrong subject to bring up. The silence stretched on, obviously agreeing with him, mockingly filling his ears and pushing in with sickening thickness.
Harry gaped at her for a second. Muggle Psychology? He remembered a talk about stitches from ages ago when they first visited Mr Weasley in St Mungo’s in his fifth year. Was muggle medicine more wide-spread than he knew?
Harry realised that this corridor led straight to the Pitch. Did Malfoy come there and then change his mind? There was no one in sight, everyone was in the Great Hall at lunch. Malfoy gave him one last glance and made a couple of steps past Harry.
I walk out to the cool September night, the noise of the ballroom dying out considerably. You don’t turn to see who I am.
It was a feeling strangely welcoming, in a way that was never fully understood. Nonetheless, it kept coming.
It was so quiet in here. His mind jumped feverishly from the dark entrance of the passage to the ‘it’s my fault’ and then… Harry remembered shaking hands on his face and an accidental embrace and a tingling feeling of someone else’s magic under his fingers, flaming stubborn eyes and a trace of blood from the lip.
“Spare me your pathetic revelations, Weasel.” Harry froze at the sound of Malfoy’s voice. It was so different from what Harry heard just an hour or so ago.
Harry opened his eyes and let go of Malfoy's robes he was clutching tightly in his fists (when did he even..?) and pushed him away hard. Draco opened his eyes, disoriented and flushed so deliciously with those red swollen lips, fuck, that was Harry's doing, the thought made his chest swell. Malfoy blinked and Harry returned to reality.
You’re a star. And all I want is to go find the darkest ditch somewhere and die in it, alone and undisturbed. Too bad the darkness makes me sick with memories, too.
“Mr Potter,” McGonagall called him and he turned to look at her. “You don’t have to speak if you find yourself unable to. It’s going to be fine.”
“Why didn't you came earlier?” Harry observed one strand of the blond hair lightly falling on the Draco’s cheek.
When they parted, Hermione wiped her eyes quickly and gave him a tentative smile. He tried to smile back.
They kept finding each other. Harry had no idea how Malfoy was doing it, because Harry was simply looking for the most isolated places. Maybe they had the same idea. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy beaten again but he saw once how some students were whispering as he walked down the corridor with telling scowls on their faces. And so they kept spending time either walking on the grounds or in the abandoned classrooms.
Sometimes, he watched Malfoy in the Great Hall across the tables. Malfoy often looked back, frowning from time to time or scowlingor sneering for no reason, and Harry would grimace in return, feeling slightly better for some reason.
Draco was lying on his side, eyes closed and evidently unconscious. His face wasn’t damaged badly except for the split lover lip that sent a trace of blood down his chin. Harry supposed it was because those arseholes didn’t want to leave any obvious traces of their “fun.” Even unconscious, Malfoy’s hands were on his stomach and Harry suspected that had been the main target. Fresh bruises mottled his hands. Harry felt sicker with every second.
“Draco, my brother from another mother!” Blaise’s head appeared next to Pansy’s and he had the audacity to grin. “What brings you fire-calling?”
The owl turned its head around to look at him and Draco could have sworn that if owls could smirk, this one would be doing just that now.
Draco snorted. “Hardly. It belonged to my maternal grandmother and is frightfully unreliable. Mother’s wand doesn’t feel all there either, but it will listen, almost as if it’s looking out for me.” He broke off before he could say any more, aware of the fact that Potter was now looking at him strangely.
“Wait, so let me get this straight,” Ginny finally spoke up, shaking her head vigorously as if water had gotten in to her ears. “You thought. Harry and I. Were dating.
He was pleased to note that the wards he’d set up were still in place and seemed to have even been strengthened. He wondered who had done it. Most probably one of those Gryffindors that Luna seemed so fond of. Eventually he reached the edge of the wards but on a whim he decided to take a walk. After all, it had been ages since he’d last been here and he’d always enjoyed his strolls with Luna before. He set off, lifting his face to bask in the sunlight that streamed down on him. He didn’t really have a destination in mind, and decided to just walk until he grew tired and then
“Does he honestly think I was going to just come back and continue with the library?” Merlin help him, Potter was hopeless.
“Of course I’m still having trouble with it. This wand never chose me and I have no connection to its previous owner either since Grandmother Druella died before I was even born.”
In retrospect, Draco would kick himself for forgetting that any form of half-arsery was extremely inappropriate when one is dealing with the Dark Arts, and this fact was made
Pansy sniffed scornfully. “I’d have joined Draco as a recluse in the Manor. My mother, no matter how terrifying she may be, would never barge in unannounced and I’m certain the Manor’s wards can keep her away.”
“I assure you, Potter, I have no intention of seducing Ginny or any such nefarious deed. We’re only friends and as you may have noticed in school as well, my female friends often tend to use me as a human pillow, and I tend to allow them to do so. However, if it troubles you so much, I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.
closer to Potter than Ginny. Perhaps close in a way that wasn’t appropriate when she was away at Hogwarts and had no way of knowing what Potter was up to.
take a few tentative steps first, and he hurried in after him, praying Potter was still in one piece. It wouldn’t do for the Chosen One to die of some unknown curse, the very day he invited an ex-Death Eater into his home.
Pansy looked even more delighted. “I’m beginning to seriously like you Gryffindors. We girls must get together for dinner one day.”
.” Bob smiled even wider when he said this and Potter backed away slightly in alarm. Draco had to agree. The man was really starting to creep him out too.
“Harry, that harpy’s watching us,” Draco hisses as he glares across at the house opposite. Harry glances over as well and can make out the outline of a woman behind the curtains. When they’d moved in last week, she’d mistaken them for brothers only to have Draco politely inform her that they were boyfriends. Ever since then, she’s already told them at least fifty times that they are ‘living in sin’. It’s even starting to get on Harry’s nerves now.
“Draco, why did you not let me know you were back?” Narcissa asked with a frown as she came in. “Blinky had to tell me that you’d returned.”
“Why ever would you think that, sister dear?” George hurriedly retracted his arm from around Draco and patted him companionably.
Granger visibly shook herself and then smiled at Weasley. “Yes, I believe you already mentioned his seating arrangement.” She looked sharply around the room which was still filled with smoke animals and creatures and then turned her gaze on the children. The scene before her looked harmless enough in Draco’s opinion. The girls were still huddled around him, examining each other’s and their own hair with the hand mirror he’d conjured up. The boys were also sprawled nearby as he’d been in the middle of a tale about the time a peacock had chased Greg around the gardens. Lily was still on his lap though she looked like she was about to doze off, one chubby hand holding tight to his shirt and of course Hugo was still camped on his head.
The place was under a Fidelius Charm and he didn’t know if he ought to be touched that Potter trusted him enough to give him his address, or insulted that Potter thought him not a threat at all anymore.
“You told me about your little journey of discovery, so I suppose it’s only fair if I tell you mine in return. You’ll see what I mean better if I do. That is, if you want to know.”
Harry nodded, but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you can tell me…things I want to know the truth about…..”
His head was tender where Vernon had hit him yesterday. He had accidentally burnt the dinner rolls, but how did they expect him to do everything at once. He was ironing Dudley’s school uniform, cooking dinner, and fetching drinks for Petunia and Vernon as they watched the evening news. It had been a simple mistake, and honestly they weren’t that burnt. Marge would have gladly had fed them to her dog if she had been there. Lucky for him, that meant that he got to eat them instead. It was the most that he had had to eat in weeks.
