is the teacher. He’s supposed to be the one in control, the one with the upper hand.
what he was doing. He wanted to kiss Draco. He wanted to fuck him in that dirty bathroom. He wanted to tell him that he
“Wow, this is really hard to explain. Okay. Um. So, we have this box. We call it a television. Televisions receive signals, and they can turn those signals into moving pictures and sounds.
There’s a stair on the right leading upstairs and a door to the left, probably leading into the kitchen.
Dean seems devastated as he gulps the rest of the liquor down.
Draco doesn’t say anything. He’s breathing heavily. So is Harry.
When Draco announces that he will take a long, warm bath, Harry jumps up and rushes into the kitchen. He has a plan. A special surprise for Draco. Even though they agreed on no presents and keeping Christmas as casual as possible, Harry can’t help himself. He wants to make Draco happy.
Harry doesn’t really know what to say. “Because … - Because he doesn’t really like me like that. And …- uh ..- we’re trying to be friends for now? I don’t know, okay? We both agreed on it.  And now we’re doing it!”
Draco shrugs. “There wasn’t much fun at the Manor in general, Harry.”
His leg bounces up and down, he searches the Great Hall for Draco, but he can’t find him anywhere. Maybe he’ll see him at dinner.
And Harry does. He talks about Judith Butler and her gender theory and how she revolutionized the idea of Gender and Sex and how Harry finds the whole theory very interesting.
He writes ten million text messages, ready to send each of them to Draco’s new phone. But then, he deletes them again.
to put us two together in Potions today. That set everything off."
Neville stares at Harry in disbelief. “Harry, what the hell?”
“I don’t wanna bother”, Harry begins with a grin “but do you mind giving me a ride home?”
Draco opens his mouth, feeling panic swell up inside of him. “That’s not true, Harry.”
Harry frowns. “Malfoy, you’re talking about
now, Harry. He has literal heart eyes every time he looks at you!"
Harry groans. “I know. I’m sorry. I wasn’t ready to talk about it.”
, I guess?”
Harry nods. “Hi.”
A warm hand wraps itself around Harry’s arm. It’s very soft and gentle, and it immediately soothes him.
“You mean you still feel like this when we don’t drink the Armortentia?”
Harry sighs. That means they’ll be working on this assignment for three weeks.
The body on top of him cuddles even closer, tucks its nose in the space between Harry’s shoulder and neck, and sighs happily.
“Potter!”
“Why?”, Draco asks dumbly.
Draco squeezes his hand and kisses his cheek.
“God, I missed this”, Harry sighs and pushes Draco closer to the bed. “Bed, bed, bed. Now!”
Harry shrugs. “I’ve never really thought about that to be honest.”
"But I still chose your lecture voluntarily!", Harry quickly adds causing Draco to chuckle.
“Uff”, Harry makes. “That means you have to travel with her to France then?”
“Okay,” Blaise says. “Let’s see. Take a shot, place it in between Hermione’s boobs, and drink it.”
Draco presses soft, wet kisses right into Harry's hole, not quite eating him out yet.
He can feel Harry’s breath on his neck when Harry suddenly leans towards him. “You look so fucking hot, you have no idea.”
"I said you're glowing", she repeats. "Have you met someone?"
Draco eventually loses his strength and gives up. He grabs his phone Tuesday night and texts Harry.
The students whisper relieved.
Draco bites his lip, suddenly feeling very self-conscious and awkward. "Um. Harry."
Harry hands Draco a Christmas Star made of glass. Draco watches him in confusion. “What am I supposed to do with his?”
He surges forward and places his hand on Draco’s shoulder. The other is gripping the dildo tightly. He conjures some lube and places it at the entrance of Draco’s round arse.
He takes another sip of his drink. Draco does the same thing.
“I don’t know what to do. He doesn’t attend my lectures, he doesn’t accept my calls, he doesn’t text back.”
Harry quickly nods. “Yes. It’s brilliant, Draco! Thank you.”
Harry follows his orders. He moans, loses himself in Draco as he starts to feel his orgasm slowly building up inside of him.
Draco presses his lips together. “Nah ah.
“Please just leave me alone”, Draco almost cries. “It’s only going to get worse.”
Draco simply nods. “You’re welcome. What are you working on?”
Harrys sighs and begins to roll his hips into the mattress. "You're going to pay for this, Draco. I'll make you suffer five times as much."
The house-elves bow in front of him. They all repeat “Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy!”
Harry watches him confused. “Um.”
Harry shrugs. “It’s whatever.”
"Religious studies. It's just not my thing", Harry explains.
Harry only nods. “Me too. Please, don't stop!”
Eventually, Draco conjures some lube and begins to rub Harry’s hole.
“I always wanted one for my birthday. But I only ever ate lemon cake here at Hogwarts as a dessert.”
Harry nods and the smile is back on his face. "Thank you. I don't know what I'd do without you."
He smiles when she waves at him hesitantly and rushes to her boyfriend, a student with bright red hair. Draco notices Harry talking to them both, making them laugh and Hermione gently slaps Harry’s shoulder.
Draco follows him close after. The moment he comes, he starts to tremble, groans and moans, and tenses in Harry’s arms.
He sits down next to Harry and presses his lips together.
Draco’s head suddenly snaps up. “You’re brilliant.”
Harry smiles at him. Not one of his fake smiles, the kind of smile that he flashes around a lot lately. The genuine smile, only reserved for special occasions. “Yeah. I agree. I was afraid that it would be weird.”
Harry grins. "Hm. I could think of a thousand more things you could do to make it up to me."
. Fuck. Fuck me good and make me yours!”
This is stupid. Harry probably isn’t even interested at all. Why would he? He doesn’t even study history. He probably only asked because he wanted to be nice and -
He watches the others set up the big tent in the garden. Charlie prepares the music, Luna handcrafts some decoration, and Ginny sends out the last invitations. Harry sighs and walks up to his room to take a nap.
Harry sighs. “I don’t really know. I wasn’t thinking. I didn’t want to destroy what we had.”
Harry watches Draco. He wishes he could read anything in his eyes or his face. But his expression is blank. There’s nothing to read, nothing to see, nothing to figure out. They sit in silence for a while.
Neville only grins. “You’re so head over heels. Merlin.”
Draco pulls down his jeans and his boxers, urging Harry to do the same, then the boy sits down on Draco’s lap and presses his lips back onto Draco’s.
Draco smiles softly. “Page 271.”
Harry doesn’t want to rush anything. He wants to soak this moment, breathe it in and never forget how happy, complete, and fulfilled he feels. This view of Draco being sprawled all over the bed will haunt him for the rest of his life. He reaches out and begins to run his hands over Draco’s back. He gently traces patterns on Malfoy’s muscles, squeezes every now and then, and begins to massage him.
His heart stops beating when he sees Harry in black joggers, a grey Nike hoodie and a cap on top of his head walking down the stairs towards the front of the lecture hall.
“You found me attractive from the very beginning?”
They kiss for a little more until they both start to get too tired. Draco rolls off Harry, snuggles into his side, and throws his arm over Harry’s stomach.
It doesn’t feel good. Harry hates it. Lucas’ stubbles itch Harry’s face, his hair doesn’t feel as soft as Draco’s, he’s too bulky, and his hands are too thick. Harry pulls away. He forces a smile and lies: “You’re cute.”
Harry has to cough every few minutes, causing Draco's heart to swell in worry.
"I'm ready, Draco!", Harry grits out.
Draco presses his lips together and forces himself to stop staring at the boy. He really needs to get his shit together, it's starting to get creepy.
“I do”, Harry whispers. “I like it a lot. It makes you look softer.”
Eventually, Draco sighs. It seems as if he has given up fighting against Harry’s help. “I’m turning into a Veela if you really must know.”
“I guess you’re right”, Harry says slowly. It’s strange admitting this out loud. “Draco might actually be the best-looking guy in our year.”
"I can't believe we just did that!", Harry giggles when they drive back to Draco's flat.
On Thursday, Draco gives his lunch away to his coworker Luna who looks like she might pass out. She's trying this new crazy diet that Draco consistently tried to talk her out of. Before she could pass out, Draco gave her his organic roasted chicken with potatoes and veggies, reassuring her that it's fine, that Draco could eat something else.
“Harry”, he whispers. “Not in here.”
Draco huffs. There’s a deep blush on his pale face. “Um. I.. Urgh.”
Harry nods, still feeling very far away. He could’ve kissed Draco. He
“Harry?”
Harry shakes his head. “Yeah, I still don’t get what happened that night. It’s all a blur to me. Draco’s behavior didn’t make any sense.”
After ten minutes, he gets back into bed and sighs again. His mind is racing and he doesn’t feel tired at all. He wonders what else he could try when suddenly, there’s a knock on the door.
Harry watches him and eventually nods. He closes his eyes and quickly dozes off. Draco doesn’t even notice when Harry’s head sinks down onto Draco’s shoulder, it happens so softly and it feels so natural. But when Harry nuzzles his nose into his neck and wraps an arm around Draco's waist, Draco feels a thousand butterflies inside his stomach and he is so utterly fucked.
“Let’s conjure a Christmas tree!”, Harry suggests after breakfast. “We can decorate it together!”
“I use a lot of conditioner.”
Draco nods. "Yeah. How can I help you?"
“That's what I thought.”
He nods and lets the witch drag him with her. “I know, I know.”
“Very.”
"So what's his name?"
"Draco", Harry says sternly "Didn't I ask you to be rough with me?"
unprofessional.
Harry obliges because the desire, the want, the lust is burning in his lungs and he needs all of Draco, right now.
Draco seems absolutely confused. “Okay. I’m not sure if I actually understand all of this, but I’ll just go with the flow.”
So, Harry stays quiet and follows Draco. Draco seriously is a master at potions, Harry thinks. The moment he sits down in one of their classrooms, he begins watching Draco gather all of the needed things, and the other boy starts to brew.
Draco trusts Harry and follows him inside. It’s pretty and cosy. The restaurant is dimly lit and the tables are decorated in velvet red.
“Top or Bottom? Come on, spill the tea.”
“I’m not going anywhere”, Harry announces. He could never leave Draco alone now.
Draco gulps and feels sweat forming on his back. Shit.
Harry steps inside, Draco following him after. Then, the younger boy nods and stops dead in his tracks. He looks up at Draco, presses him against the door and
“Thanks for driving me home”, Harry speaks softly.
Draco stares at the ground. His hands are trembling. “Because I ruined everything by falling in love.”
“Ughh,” he groans. He needs a moment to relocate himself.
He likes reading student's work, especially if the work is good. He's read an amazing essay from a student called Hermione Granger.
Draco sighs. "Well, I’ll head downstairs then.”
Draco tilts his head back and barks out a loud laugh. It’s –
Draco opens the door, and when they step inside, they almost have to laugh. The room has stayed the same, but the sofas are now gone. Instead, there’s a huge, comfy looking bed in the middle of the room.
Draco begins to move against Harry, rubs himself on him, and Harry never thought he’d enjoy this as much as he does. He loves allowing Draco to be in control.
Harry nods eagerly. “Yes! But you have to help me with it.”
Draco watches Harry. He watches him wet his hair and his body with the warm water and Harry’s throat suddenly feels dry. Maybe he should’ve thought this through. Maybe he shouldn’t have urged Draco to help him with his hair. But now it’s too late anyway. He’s sitting as good as naked in a bathtub. Draco Malfoy, the man he’s fucked countless times and Harry still feels awkward being naked in front of him, sits next to him. This is a surreal, weird situation. Harry truly has the talent to get himself into the most fucked up situations.
Harry’s head snaps around. He knows right away who that person is. He could recognize that voice even in his sleep.
And Draco does. He speeds up his movements, begins to thrust harder, his nails sink into Harry’s stomach, and he grunts into Harry’s ear.
Right at that moment, a door reveals itself next to the boys.
Harry rolls his eyes again. He wishes Draco would stop staring at him through his intense, unreadable eyes.
Hermione sighs. “Harry! Getting drunk won’t help either. What the hell is wrong with you? I’ve never seen you act like this.”
Harry tilts his head and thinks for a moment. The thought of Draco not having a good time during Christmas breaks his heart and his hero complex is coming through. “Remember right before the Halloween break, when we thought about staying in Hogwarts? Just the two of us?”
“No,” Draco mutters, “Not in the same way. I
between them. With or without the Amortentia, Harry enjoys Draco’s presence.
Harry pulls out of Draco, whispers a cleaning spell, and lays back down on top of Draco. He wraps his arms around Malfoy’s petite body and presses a kiss on his shoulder. Then, he closes his eyes and eventually nods off.
“Less talking, more kissing,” Draco replies and immediately presses his lips back on top of Harry’s. They begin to kiss passionately, both moving against each other, longing for friction.
this to be a thing?” Draco asks.
It’s certainly
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
He feels panic building up inside of him. Oh, crap. This isn’t going to end well. He catches a glimpse of Draco, staring at his own hands. The boy seems lost in his thoughts. Harry feels like throwing up. Maybe he should, just so he could get the Veritaserum out of his body.
We all know that the mysterious boy is Draco,” he rushes to say.
Draco takes a deep breath and frowns. “Get a grip on yourself, man. You’re a professional, serious professor.”
Draco turns around and smiles at him through soft, grey eyes. He’s never looked more beautiful in the dim light.
“Mhm”, Harry mumbles. “Yeah, fucking you is so much nicer.”
Again, Harry doesn’t want to leave things on this note. He feels as if he has to speak up. “Are we good?”
“And because
Harry’s head snaps around. What the - “Oh. Okay. I don’t care.”
“I thought of your tummy, so toned yet so soft. I dreamed of biting your soft skin, licking it, and moving lower. I imagined myself sucking your cock and making you cum.”
Ron winks at him knowingly, Harry only grins.
He still doesn’t look at Draco. The other man steps closer to him but keeps enough distance. Harry can smell the alcohol surrounding Draco from here. The man must be as drunk as him, maybe he’s even drunker.
Draco smiles and moves closer to Harry. Together, they step into the big bathtub, letting the water warm them both. Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s torso from behind and begins kissing his neck. “I’d do anything for you.”
Therefore, he tries his hardest to hide the bruises on his body. He wears his thickest jumper and a scarf. But he’s sharing the room with four blokes who know him better than he knows himself. Obviously, they notice something is different the moment he enters their shared dorm room. He knows because they stare at him with raised eyebrows and questioning eyes. But thankfully, they don’t ask any questions. They know Harry well enough, and they give him his space. Harry couldn’t be more grateful.
in that black button-up shirt.
Ron hesitates. “Hm. I’ll take Dare.”
Harry’s heart starts to beat faster, Draco must hear it for sure. He tries to collect himself. Keep it together, Potter. When he speaks, his own voice sounds off to him. “Yes. You could do that.”
Draco bites his lip and watches Harry carefully. He doesn’t know where this is going. “I don’t know. Whatever this is between us.”
Draco bites Harry’s neck and rubs his free hand over his stomach. The warm water soothes his muscles and helps him relax. When Draco pushes in a second finger, Harry bites his lip and holds on to the bathtub.
Harry loves listening to Draco begging. Who would’ve thought that Draco begging for it could be so fucking hot? He licks the inside of Draco’s left thigh. Draco shivers.
“Fuck!” he moans as he comes inside Draco. It won’t stop. He’s coming and coming until he feels close to passing out. He squirts his cum inside Draco’s hole, slows down his movements. He has never come this hard in his entire life. He feels dizzy and breathless and so, so good. Harry continues to stroke Draco.
doing here?”
“Merlin, no. I’m not uptight!”
Harry smiles back and walks to the counter ordering his hot chocolate.
* * *
Harry smiles softly at him and shakes his head. “No. Of course not. You can stay.”
Malfoy grunts. “What the fuck? You really are the definition of a Precious Golden Boy. What about abs? What about eyes, hair color? Nothing?”
Draco can feel himself getting harder and harder with each and every minute. “Fuck, I need you.”
“It’s a disaster!”, Draco screams outraged and throws his hands up in the air.
Draco stares at his hands, he suddenly seems unsure and nervous. Harry waits for him to speak up. “I – um. I could just stay here, you know. Don’t wanna get up and move again.”
The moment the love potion begins to have an effect, he lunges forward. He grabs Draco’s face, presses his lips on top of his, and guides him to the bed. Draco lets it all happen. He kisses him back, grabs Harry’s waist, and pulls him closer. They let themselves fall on top of the bed and into the sheets.
Harry grunts. “Oh, shut it. That didn’t feel like ‘too old’ to me!”
Then, he straightens his own T-shirt, buttons up Draco's shirt and fixes Draco's hair. He lets his own hair be messy, there's no difference to its usual state anyways.
Draco knows it's not just about sex. They get along too well and there are way too many feelings involved already.
The fact that he’s looking forward to his Tuesday history lecture scares him. Nothing about that lecture is special, nothing makes it different than the others lectures or seminars. Nothing makes it stand out.
Draco sighs. “That’s what I’ve been trying to figure out over the past month. I had hoped you would have an answer.”
Harry knows he’s only saying this because his mind is intoxicated. But it still feels nice hearing him say this.
Draco grins. He lets go of Harry’s hands and he suddenly feels empty. “I know.”
“I’m ready,” Draco sighs. “Please, I’m ready.”
“I don’t know. I really didn’t wanna go to the Leaky Cauldron again.”
Draco smiles softly. He seems much more relaxed now. “Yes, I agree.”
“I’m also here because I was hoping to see you”, Draco admits shyly.
“Um”, Hermione begins. “Are you sure that you and Draco are just friends? Because friends usually don’t book a house and spend Christmas with each other.”
Harry feels confident about their plan. The Armortentia agreement had to stop eventually. And Harry is glad that they found a healthy, mature way to handle the situation.
“I need to see him. Do you know where he is?”
“How did you know I – um. I - “, Harry doesn’t know how to finish his sentence, but Draco understands.
Draco runs a hand through his hair, not wanting to fail him but also not having any other choice.
. Draco’s hair falls onto his forehead, his eyes are closed, his lashes throw shadows on his cheeks. Merlin, how long those lashes are! Harry has never noticed before how full and glossy Draco’s lips are. Fuck, he wants to bite them and taste them.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
But that means that Draco doesn't have something to eat for lunch anymore. Therefore, he finds himself getting some pasta and veggies in the crowded cafeteria. He sits down in a quiet corner where he won't be disturbed and begins to eat his meal.
* * *
"You're already inside", Draco states, noticing how unfriendly he sounds.
“But I’m not attracted to you, okay? I don’t find you attractive”, Malfoy spits out.
“Sorry.” He blushes.
Harry gets up and turns on the TV. He mutes it and sits back down on the couch. “Okay, listen. Muggles have many electric devices that witches and wizards don’t know about.”
Harry's eyes are dark, his cheeks are flushed pink and his lips are puffy. "Yes. 100 per cent."
Then, Harry looks up and stares right at Draco. “I’m coming over”
“Harry!”, Draco moans and grabs Harry’s hand. “Touch me, need you so much closer.”
“Harry,” he presses out. “I’m ready. I need you. Now!”
“I know that you are, in fact, bisexual. A friend knows a friend who knows someone who hooked up with you,” he purrs.
He takes the bottle and gulps it down in one take. Last time, he was nervous because he didn’t know what was expecting him. Now that he knows, he’s confident, and he can’t wait. Draco drinks the bottle and puts it back on the table.
just fuck then?”
Harry chuckles. He feels tired, but he doesn’t want to sleep yet. “I’m scared of tomorrow.”
And then, he presses his lips onto Draco’s. Harry's arms wrap themselves around Draco’s neck, pulling him as close as possible, while Draco eagerly responds to the kiss.
Draco hides his face behind his hands now. Harry grabs them and pushes them away, laughing. “You’ve got to be kidding me!”
Draco simply nods and begins to roll his hips into Harry’s. “Please, move.”
“Just go with the flow. You don’t have to go on a date with him. Talking after lectures is perfectly fine, just see where it goes from there.”
After half an hour Harry shifts towards Draco and places his hand on Draco’s thigh.
“You’re not helping, you’re making everything wor-“
They sit in silence, while Draco finishes cooking. Harry enjoys watching him. The blonde man seems so concentrated and focused.
“The room of requirement”, Harry whispers. “That’s perfect.”
Draco licks his lips. He seems unsure, but that can’t be. Draco Malfoy isn’t the kind of guy to be nervous.
Harry nods and grins. He puts his bag down. „Sorry I just came from the gym, I didn’t have time to shower.“
Harry swallows thickly. His eyes flicker between Hermione and Ron. “I really, genuinely love him and I don’t want to lose him.”
Draco hums and hands him a towel. Harry takes it and begins to rub his body dry.
"Hm. Well. Maybe Mr Malfoy can help you catch up on today's potion. You haven't even started brewing yet and Mr Malfoy seems to be half finished."
“I haven’t gotten laid in ages, too. But for different reasons.”
When they sit down, he has to take a deep calming breath, adjusting his trousers.
Harry grins and adds another finger, and Draco spreads his legs further apart, his hips trembling as Harry stretches him open with his fingers.
Draco hides his face in Harry’s neck. “Shut up!”
Harry presses his lips together. He definitely doesn’t want to admit to Draco that he can’t sleep without him by his side. That would be embarrassing. And it would probably ruin everything between them.
“I was wondering if the Boy Who Lived would like to get some …
Draco blushes and presses his lips together. “I’m starting to think you’re not paying attention during my lectures.”
For a moment, Draco’s eyes soften and his lips twitch. What did Harry want to say again?
Neville rolls his eyes and gets up. “I’ll get some ice cream now. But stop crying, you literally put yourself into this situation. This is all your own fault.”
His fingers are shaking.
Harry only laughs at that. It’s the most beautiful sound. “Okay, maybe I am flirting with you. What’s so wrong about that?”
Draco can’t hold himself back any longer. He slams into Harry full force, grabs his waist and pulls him up. "Oh god!"
“Promise”, Draco answers truthfully and puts the little note inside his wallet.
Harry blinks at him in surprise. “You – what?”
Draco is smart, he hands out the tickets and makes sure not to be seated next to Harry. He wouldn’t survive three hours next to the boy.
He clears his throat. “It’ll be horrible not seeing you for an entire week.”
Harry shakes his head. “No, trust me. Let’s just start watching a movie and you’ll see what I mean.”
Draco frowns, but the boy quickly adds “I'm sitting on that table over there. I'm studying for an exam, I can concentrate here way better than at home. I recognized you straight away when you walked in. I just wanted to get another hot chocolate for my study session and well - um - I just wanted to say hi."
“Your hair is so soft,” he states.
The blonde man shakes his head. “Please, shut up!”
He decides to take a risky step and be straight forward. "Why don't you study with your boyfriend?"
“Don’t”, Draco hisses in pain. He looks even worse up close.
Harry frowns. “Really?”
Draco squirms uncomfortably, but he smiles nevertheless. He greets all of them with a wave.
“Already feels softer”, Draco whispers, his voice sounding raspy. He clears his throat.
Harry looks at him in disbelief.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Harry jumps out of the bed, rushing to the bathroom and reaching for his glasses. He doesn’t even remember putting them down yesterday. Then, he hurries to his bedroom and grabs a jumper and a pair of sweatpants. He gets dressed as quickly as he can manage and almost runs downstairs, tripping on the stairs.
Draco looks up and stares into those emerald green eyes that seem to burn right through his soul. He holds his breath and straightens his back. Act cool, Malfoy. Calm and collected.
* * *
Draco nods eagerly and lets Harry push him on the bed. Harry falls on top of him and continues to kiss Draco as if his life depended on it. He feels like he’s falling, deeper and deeper into the unknown. When Draco’s tongue licks his bottom lip, begging for entrance, Harry’s mind goes blank. His dick is throbbing painfully as he rolls his hips up against Draco and moans. “Fuck, Draco!”
Harry swallows and turns around. He keeps himself busy by tidying up.
“Shut up”, Draco argues. “I genuinely do it for the students in general. Harry simply inspired me.”
“I really needed this,” Draco mumbles and presses soft kisses on top of Harry’s chest.
like you said, you can’t risk it, right? I’m not worth the risk.”
“Don’t think about it too much, Harry.”
Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s forehead. “You don’t have to be anything but yourself. You have to be true to yourself and do whatever makes you feel good. And I’m here for whatever that might be. Okay?”
But for some reason, he enters the lecture hall on Tuesday with weird anticipation and a tingle inside his chest.
After five minutes of cleaning, he feels a lot better already. He gets out his phone and texts his mum a list of things he needs from the grocery store. Then, he grabs his coat and his bag and exits the office, locking the door right after him.
Just as he wants to write down the grade, he hears a knock on his door.
Harry jumps up again and knocks over the glass of water Draco had used for his paintings on the floor. “Shit!”
“A what?” Ron squeaks and moves away from Harry.
“Oh my god, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!”, Draco cries and then, finally, he sinks onto the mattress and relaxes.
"I think we should take a shower", Draco grins. "You know, just to get warm again. We don't want to get sick, right?"
His sensation must be nothing compared to Draco’s.
Harry looks taken aback. “That’s not how you confess your love to someone.”
"Go on! Go on, tell me how much I disgust you! Make it so much bloody fucking easier for me to leave. Just say it already! I know you want to, I can see it on your face, go on, father. Tell me you can't stand the sight of me! Tell me I'm such a disappointment, a burden, an ingrate, all because you can't accept that your son's a fucking fairy, a bloody poof! So fucking
"Sure, whatever you say, Golden Boy," Draco smirked and walked over toward his front door, leaving Harry in the grass. "Try not to attack any of my other friends, should you come across us messing around."
"And if I don't forgive you, hmm?" Dad smiled mischievously, bringing his hands to rest on Papá's hips. "Then I suppose I'll have to make it up to you some other way,
“I’m getting hungry. I think I’ll head to the Great Hall for breakfast now.”
Ginny grins. “Because you two are being absolutely ridiculous, and you really need to get your shit together. Off you go.”
Draco’s cheeks turn pink. “Yes. The best sleep I’ve had since October, probably. You?”
happy that Voldemort’s gone and that the war is over. But. I don’t know. Hogwarts just feels different.”
“That’s okay,” Draco says. His own voice sounds strange to him.
Draco recognises him immediately. Lean body, messy raven hair and glasses that he could recognise everywhere.
Draco slaps his hand across his face as the group breaks into a great fit of laughter. "Great. Thanks, Nev."
Draco hands him the lighter. They both light up their cigarettes and begin to smoke.
“Hmm?” Draco hums.
“Oh”, Draco says awkwardly. “I’m so sorry.”
Draco huffs, his eyes wide open. “Are you being serious?”
“I’m going to remove my fingers now”, Harry announces. “Prepare yourself for the pain.”
Draco opens his eyes and slowly turns his head to stare at Harry. Harry’s eyes are dark, filled with lust. Draco breathes hard and feels himself getting more aroused with every second.
Neville, Dean, and Ron burst out into a fit of giggles. “Sure. That’s why you’ve been getting ready for over an hour now.”
They don’t say anything for what feels like an eternity.
Harry knew it was a bad idea the moment Dean had shouted: “Party at the Leaky Caldron!” But he didn’t have a chance. Ron had dragged him all the way to Hogsmeade, even though Harry had protested the entire time.
He starts picking up a few papers, either throwing them in the trash or putting them away, grabs all the pencils lying around and puts them back to where they belong.
Draco meets every thrust, moaning and crying at the same time. “Harry, you have no idea how fucking good this feels. Please, fill me up, fuck me, touch me. I need you so much, please don’t stop.”
Why won’t Ginny just shut up? Harry feels as if he’s drowning in his embarrassment. Fuck. In the corner of his eyes, he notices Draco shift uncomfortably.
“Fuck”, Draco cries. “Oh, Merlin. I don’t think I’ll survive this. Don’t stop, I - fuck - I can’t - please - I need -“
Draco shrugs. “I was thinking.”
“What?”, Draco asks and his eyes shoot open. “Harry, What -“
!", Draco says throwing his hands up but even to him it sounds pathetic. "Everything is wrong about that!”
“Like this?”, Harry asks.
Under normal circumstances, Harry would not have approached Draco Malfoy. He would've just left him be. But this is not a normal circumstance. Malfoy looks worried, he looks hurt, he looks as if he is in major pain.
Harry shakes his head. “I fell asleep.”
“Fuck off,” Draco hisses at the guy with such dominance, even Harry raises his eyebrows at him.
He opens the box and sees a banana, a yogurt, a croissant, a sandwich, and a few crackers inside. Harry is speechless. He looks up at Draco, who keeps himself busy looking through his bag again.
They step outside the bathroom half an hour later, both adjusting their trousers and trying to look as innocent as possible. Draco grins at Harry and presses a kiss to his cheek. Harry blushes and giggles like the lovesick teenager that he is. They look around, but it turns out that no one actually cares about them, since everybody is already gathered outside.
“Shhh”, he hisses. “I need to focus!”
“I fucked it all up”, Draco cries. “He’ll never speak to me again. It’s probably for the best anyway, it was meant to go downhill right from the start.”
Draco huffs. “Why don’t
second, please? You’re being annoying, and I can’t concentrate.”
Harry’s heart beats faster. He runs a hand through his messy hair – Draco follows the movement with his eyes.
“Yes, Potter. You are.” Draco jumps up and begins to walk through the room. “We could brew Armortentia. It would make us believe that we are crazily attracted to each other. We could fuck and release some pressure. And then we can go back to normal.”
Draco hesitates for a moment but then he grabs Harry’s hand. “Nice to meet you.”
“Figure out what?”
The door is being opened and a particular young man enters. "Hey, Draco. Can I come in?"
from a fit guy like me?”
“You seriously asked me if I care about you?”, he shouts suddenly angry at himself. “Hell yes. More than I’ve ever cared about anyone.”
“I kinda took advantage of the situation, I guess? You being desperate and horny and hot and all”, Harry eventually forces himself to say but immediately regrets it. He doesn’t want Draco to hate him for taking advantage of him during a private and intimate moment.
Hermione eventually agrees to do it just because the others offer her a joker for when it’s her turn, and she really doesn’t want to do a task.
Draco smiles and squeezes his arms around Harry even more tightly.
Me, Harry thinks. I have. But he doesn’t say it out loud.
When he gives his next history lecture about how the First World War developed, his eyes wander across the room. Beautiful green eyes stare back at him intensively from one of the seats in the back and Draco has to turn around in order to concentrate.
The next morning, they are already much less awkward around each other than the last time. Draco accepts the fact that Harry doesn’t want to have breakfast. He gets dressed and hands Harry his clothes.
He fights hard against the urge to pull over and offer Harry a ride. He couldn’t just drive his student home, for God’s sake! But eventually his self control shedders and he parks right in front of the bus station.
“Sorry”, a familiar voice says. “I didn’t want to scare you.”
He gets up and slips past Luna. The moment he rises, people’s heads turn. They start to whisper and point at Harry. He wishes he could disappear.
He closes the distance between them and presses his lips against Draco’s as fireworks explode around them.
Harry bites his lip and breathes out. He wants to enjoy this as much as possible. It’s been almost two months since he last felt Draco’s hands on his skin and it shouldn’t feel this fantastic, but he can’t help it. He loves Draco’s hands on his body, he craves it so much that it physically hurts his body.
Harry nods even though he wants to argue with Malfoy and tell him that he doesn't believe him. He steps closer to Malfoy and has to close his eyes for a second. Draco smells absolutely amazing, it drives him crazy.
Harry comes right then and there. He groans, spilling inside of Draco and bites on his shoulder. He strokes Draco one more time before Draco follows Harry over the edge and collapses on the bed.
Harry turns around and watches Draco smile at the tree. He radiates so much joy, peace, and happiness – it actually makes him look much younger and softer than he actually is. It’s insane, looking at Draco now and comparing him to the Draco before the war. Harry can see the difference right before his eyes and it makes him incredibly sad to think what Draco must’ve been through during that time. He vividly sees War-Draco in front of him – the frail, skinny boy with huge circles under his eyes and a frown gracing his face every single day looking like death himself. Harry’s heart swells at the sight of a happy, soft, peaceful Draco and he realizes how utterly fucked he actually is.
Harry frowns. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Are you going home?”
But Dean grabs his shirt and pushes him back down onto the couch. “No chance. You’re playing!”
acknowledge the timid “Hi” when Draco walks out of the lecture hall.
Draco nods. “Hm. I thought about staying here, just the two of us. But I already told Mother that I would be coming home. I guess it’s better that way anyway.”
He reaches down and takes the glass, puts it on the table and grabs his wand to clean up the mess. Once he’s finished, he grabs the brushes and the paintings Draco had left on the floor and puts them aside. His hands are trembling and he feels nauseous. He fucked it all up again.
“There’s a mouse!”
“Well”, Draco clears his throat. “I guess you already know who I am.”
Harry shakes his head and rubs his hands together. He envies Malfoy for the scarf because it’s really getting colder every day. “Fuck, I hate it.”
“Draco, what the hell are we doing?”
grins. "Hm."
Draco clears his throat. “About Voldemort. And the time when he lived with us. It was the most terrifying time of my life.”
Draco takes a quick sip of his drink. “Well, that’s too bad, Potter. Go cry about it somewhere else.”
“In the afternoon we’ll visit the Victoria and Albert Museum. This will take about three hours. In the evening you’re free to do whatever you want to do. Go have dinner, get drunk, go out, I don’t care as long as you don’t die and are fit enough to participate on Friday.”
Harry smiles. “Yeah, me too.”
Harry draws a flower on the open page of his book, earning a stern glance from Hermione which he shrugs off. He hasn't slept well last night and he wants this lesson to be over with as quickly as possible. Potions had always been his least favorite subject, but after the War it had only gotten worse.
He’s thankful for the distraction. He needs a moment to cool off and collect himself. When he finally feels a little calmer, Harry rolls them over. His head is spinning. All he can think of is
Harry nods, runs a hand through his sweaty hair, and tries to catch his breath. “I have no fucking idea. That was fantastic.”
They all order another round of drinks. Hermione, Luna, Dean, and Neville head to the dancefloor, ready to party. But Harry and Ron stay behind. He doesn’t feel like dancing. He wants to find Draco.
They grab their stuff and hide it under a staircase. Then, Harry guides Draco towards the kitchens.
Harry nods. “Exactly.”
The play starts again and Harry reaches for Draco's hand, grabs it tightly. Draco squeezes back.
Whatever they were expecting, it probably wasn’t the huge cramp that follows. Draco almost falls to the floor if Harry hadn’t caught him just in time.
“Malfoy, stop being ridiculous. You just described
Harry feels a sting inside his chest. He swallows down the lump in his throat.
, you idiot. Have you ever looked at yourself? You’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever met. Inside and out. I couldn’t confess it back then. It was embarrassing to admit that I, a former Death Eater, former enemy of Harry freaking Potter, found you attractive. I knew that you didn’t find me attractive, therefore I couldn’t admit it. I was too proud.”
Ginny grins. She tilts her head and considers this for a moment. “I mean, I was in a relationship with Harry after all. Not for too long, but still. I’m sorry, Dean. My answer would have to be Harry.”
“Uh. Okay”, Draco seems to concentrate on Harry’s words now.
“Say my name again,” Harry demands, watching Draco in anticipation.
"100 per cent?", Draco repeats, looking for any sign of doubt or uncertainty in Harry's eyes. He finds none.
Harry nods. “Yeah. There was this girl in year three, right? She came up to me at lunch. I think she wanted an autograph. She stared at me, got pale, and then she just fainted.”
Fuck this. Fuck Draco, fuck feelings and screw this stupid agreement that they have. Fuck thinking, fuck falling, fuck being horny. Fuck.
Harry’s heart speeds up. Oh, God. What is he supposed to say? He shrugs. Play it cool, Potter! “I guess.”
He listens to Draco’s steady heartbeat, feels every part of Draco’s skin. He swallows the moment and never wants it to stop.
The boy smiles, pushes his glasses up and nods. “You should know that I’m not the only one who loves your lectures.”
Harry feels a heaviness inside his chest and he feels tears burning in his eyes again. “Did you mean it? When you said that you love me? Did you mean it?”
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that. He knows they’ve let their differences and fights in the past. So technically, everything’s good between them now.
Draco has never been this intimate with someone before. Sure, he’s had sex and blowjobs and all that. But he’s never held someone this close before, calming them down and being their rock.
So he gets up, gets rid of the food and the tray and walks back to his office.
Harry avoids his friends’ attentive eyes. “Maybe.”
Draco turns around surprised. Harry jogs up to him with a smile.
Harry can’t fight back the bubbly feeling inside his chest. He wishes he could, but it’s so strong, he can’t push it down. “Sounds good.”
So when Draco and Harry step into the pub they're all supposed to meet up, he can't help but feel extremely nervous.
just fuck anyone here at Hogwarts. We can help each other out. It’s amazing.”
Slowly, he slides in all the way. He swears, he sees stars at the sensation of being inside Harry’s tight arse.
Harry licks his lips and pulls Draco’s cheeks apart. Then, in a moment of bravery, he sinks down and begins to fuck Draco’s arse with his tongue.
“Don’t trust me?”
Draco stares at Harry. See you on Tuesday. As if it was a settled agreement between them.
“Rough, I guess. I don’t know.”
“Wow, it’s so nice!”, Draco exclaims and Harry raises an eyebrow at him.
Harry holds his breath. He doesn’t want Draco to think that he’s getting onto him. Harry doesn’t find Draco attractive. Sure, he’s a handsome man. No one would argue otherwise. Anyone who says differently would be blind and delusional. But Harry doesn’t want to
“Where are you going?”
“My number!”
“Please don’t call me Sir”, Harry cringes.
“Harry, I transformed a condom into a mouse. Meet me at the Prefects’ bathroom in ten minutes. D.”
Draco shakes his head. “You’re not my type.”
The raven-haired man stares at the ceiling, feeling out of place in this huge bed and empty room. He should be with Draco right now. After spending the past two days together, watching movies, taking long walks at the beach, cooking together, reading or painting, and even spending the most relaxing and peaceful Christmas Eve with him, Harry begins to feel empty the moment Draco wishes him goodnight and disappears in his room.
* * *
“I haven’t felt this peaceful and happy in a really long time,” Harry eventually admits. He squeezes Draco.
His mum shakes her head confused. "Why is that a problem?"
Harry doesn’t know himself. He simply doesn’t want to sit still for another hour. He needs some sort of release. He needs Draco, to be exact. He misses Draco. The weekly meetings with him simply aren’t enough anymore. Harry wishes he could see him every single day.
It’s small. There’s no real entrance hall. They step inside and immediately find themselves in the living room. Huge windows are allowing the light to get inside, a chimney in the corner, and a huge dark green sofa.
Harry nods.
Harry runs his hands up and down Draco's body and begins to open the buttons of Draco's shirt.
Draco blushes. “Um. Well, I’m trying to. I can’t guarantee that it will actually taste nice. I’ve never really cooked before.”
Harry doesn’t dare to ask the others if it’s actually certain that Draco will attend this Halloween party. He doesn’t want to embarrass himself. But if there’s even a tiny chance of seeing Draco again, he will take it. It’s pathetic. Harry forces himself not to think about it.
It’s quiet between them again. Harry decides to speak up. “Thank you. For calming me down, you know.”
“That’s very sweet, Nev”, Hermione reassures him.
“Stupid British weather”, he mumbles.
Harry has to stop for a second. His head falls onto Draco’s shoulder, and he bites it, groaning. His dick is so hard, it’s actually painful now.
Harry grins smugly and sits down on the couch. "But you're missing out on a lot."
Harry clears his throat and focuses on the box of DVDs on the floor. He rummages through them and eventually finds Disney’s “Lady and the Tramp”.
Draco huffs out a humorless laugh. “Potter, it’s already ruined. Look at us.”
"Morning", Harry replies and smiles.
“I’m scared too, you know?”, Harry admits. He looks just as surprised as Draco.
“Fuck, Harry. How did I survive the last few weeks without this?”
Harry is speechless. He can’t believe that Neville would notice all of these things.
“Top or Bottom?”
Draco grabs the phone, opens the camera, and holds it up in the air. He points the camera towards Harry and snaps a picture. “Lovely.”
“I hated watching you kiss him.”
Feeling proud and confident, he walks into the lecture hall next Tuesday and waits for the students to come in. He sees the boy entering the hall and gives him a timid smile. Draco feels giddy inside when the boy returns the smile and sits down.
Draco smiles. “That’s really sweet.”
Draco only grins. “Fantastic. Slowly going back to the good old times, then, are we?”
"I'm going to cum if you keep doing this", Harry groans as he rolls his hips in sync with Draco's tongue.
* * *
Without hesitation, Harry opens the door and jumps inside the car. “Sorry, I’m soaked.”
"This wasn't so bad, huh?", Harry asks as they get out of the cap they had taken back to Draco's flat. They both had been drinking so driving would be a bad idea now.
“Fuck, Draco, I need you so much”
Draco can’t sleep. The events of the night repeatedly play inside his head like a movie that starts again and again every time it’s finished.
. I can’t wait much longer.”
“I am not -“
He runs up to the young man and grips his arm.
He breathes heavily, can’t wait much longer, because he wants this so much he can’t bear it.
Harry notices Draco’s long, clean fingers. He watches his blonde, soft hair. He can’t wait to kiss the pale skin on Draco’s neck soon. He feels a bubble of excitement inside of him, just thinking about that. He isn’t aware of the fact that he hasn’t even started drinking one sip of the love potion and already feels excited. No, he’s pushing that thought far, far away, not wanting to understand what it all means.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“What the hell?” Ron squeaks, his eyes are wide open. “Did the mouse just give you that?!”
Draco snuggles even closer, squeezes his arms around his torso, and burrows his nose in the space between his ear and neck. Harry shivers.
Neville gives him a knowing smirk. "You're head over heels for that boy, you do realize that, right?"
Malfoy has now turned on the water and lets it run over his heated body.
"Yes, I have heard you loud and clear. I just don't understand why that would be a problem. Unless he's a minor, of course."
“Wait. Halloween. Were we really that obvious?”
Draco presses his lips together. "Is that what this is all about? Sex?"
“Your what?”
It becomes a habit. Draco gives his lecture and tries to ignore Harry as best as he can so he doesn’t get distracted.
Draco happily kisses him back. He grabs Harry’s waist and pulls him so much closer. Harry presses Draco against the wall and kisses him as if his life depended on it. Draco eventually pushes him away to catch his breath and to look Harry into his eyes.
“But it doesn’t have to be like this every time. I enjoyed the switch, but like-“
He eventually starts to feel tired again. His eyes fall shut, and he drifts off into a more peaceful sleep.
When they’re finally done, Draco reaches for his bag, ready to leave. But Harry doesn’t really want him to go just yet. Surprisingly, he really does enjoy his company even when they’re sober and doing boring stuff. Doing homework together, for example. “Draco?”
Harry frowns. “I’m not uptight.” He feels the blood rush to his cheeks.
“Fuck, I
“Harry, for fuck’s sake, Draco is obsessed with you! And you’re obsessed with him, how can you be this freaking daft, I don-“
With an excited shy smile, he hurries to the lecture hall and unlocks the door. He’s half an hour early, as always. Draco isn’t crazy, he just likes to be prepared and he likes things to be well organized.
Draco eventually goes back to working in silence and Harry watches him crack a few nuts, cut some shrubbery and add some strange looking powder into the Cauldron. Harry gets lost in the movement of Draco's long, slim fingers. His hands are beautiful. Strong and pale.
Harry smiles. He watches Draco from the side and feels his chest tightening. “It’s magical, isn’t it? It’s always so busy down here. The house-elves love cooking. Every time I come down here with an extra wish, they get all excited and bubbly.”
Harry immediately rows back. “No, no. No. I – I don’t know. I just enjoy these moments with you so much. I’m sad when they’re over.”
Everything he felt in that club was completely Harry, not some weird love potion. And Harry can’t help but wonder whether Draco felt the same.
Harry watches him just as intensively. “Mind if I join you?”
Harry sits down on the bed. He frowns at the scenario in front of him but decides not to say anything. After all, Neville always accepted him for his bullshit. He’s not going to give Neville shit for stroking and flirting with a plant.
Harry nods and pulls his wand out of the pocket of his jeans. He takes off his shoes and transfigures one into a nice pink dildo.
“But what about your friends?”, Draco tries helplessly. “Don’t you wanna spend time with them?”
He bites his lip and shakes his head. “I can’t. I really can’t. I – Fuck, I don’t know. I’m too scared.”
Eventually, after half an hour of waiting and drinking the rest of their alcohol, they get inside the club. The music is loud, it’s dark, and there are people everywhere. If Harry would be sober, he would absolutely hate this. Thankfully, he’s already feeling the alcohol clouding his brain. His muscles feel much more relaxed than usual, his brain is foggy, and he feels more carefree.
If Harry had received attention before the war during his time at Hogwarts for being known as the Boy Who Lived, it was absolutely nothing compared to the way people treat him now.
“Deadline will be on the nineteenth of December.”
Draco takes a deep breath. “I’m in love with you, Harry Potter.”
“I know what you’re thinking: Neville doesn’t know the whole story. It’s complicated. Blablabla. But honestly, both of you seem so much happier ever since you started hooking up, I think you – “
“Fuck”, Draco sighs. “God, Harry. You have no idea what you’re doing to me.”
“Mum”, Draco argues “I don’t want you to go grocery shopping for me. I'm thirty-one years old!”
Draco smiles. “You know what? I trust you. Just do your thing and I’ll try to tag along.”
Harry sighs. “Yeah. No. I don’t know. I just lost it.”
“I love you, Draco!”, he whispers before
. First, when we made this stupid deal to fuck while high on Armortentia. And then again, when we agreed on being just friends.”
They eventually leave him alone. Harry finally feels a little calmer now that he’s by himself. He begins wandering around the castle, turning left, then turning right. He doesn’t really know where he’s going until, all of a sudden, he finds himself at the Room of Requirement. He opens the door without thinking about anything in particular and steps inside.
Neville nods. “Yeah, we all know that. That’s why we didn’t ask. We didn’t want to pressure you.”
Draco beams at Harry. “Okay. Well, then. If you’re serious about this, then I’m down.”
Draco leans his head against Harry’s and smiles. “I’ve never really said that out loud. It makes me feel so dumb. But – I don’t know – I guess I’ve always struggled with wanting to be the tough, dominant guy and knowing that I’m the complete opposite.”
He wraps his arm around Draco’s waist and pulls him close to his body. The other hand wraps itself around Draco’s throat, and he kisses him. Draco kisses back with just as much passion and want. This was probably the best idea they’ve ever had.
Their hands touch for the tiniest moment, sending shivers down his spine. Draco licks his lips and gulps.
Harry ignores the tight feeling in his chest and decides not to comment on that. He lets Draco work in peace. Harry tries to stop himself from thinking.
“Oh my god, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!”, Harry cries and then, he sinks onto the mattress and relaxes.
Harry’s jaw drops. “
He’s so thankful that they have touring guides in each museum so that Draco doesn’t have to focus on speaking since Harry is everywhere.
Harry shakes his head. No, that’s not the case. He does trust Malfoy in a strange way.
“I have to suffer through this, even if it might kill me”, Draco finishes, eyes still closed. He tenses his whole body, clearly signalling another cramp. “Fuck.”
Harry has no clue what Draco is talking about, but he’s glad the other man likes the house.
Harry rolls his eyes. “He’s not everyone. I’m pretty sure that he doesn’t even like me if it weren’t for the … um … - the
“Do you want to watch a movie?”, Harry suggests when his eyes land on the little TV next to the chimney.
“Hm. I guess I’d still consider Cho Chang the most attractive in our year”, Harry finally admits. He’s always thought that she’s one of the most beautiful girls he’s ever met.
“Escape from school, I guess. From the people. The noise. Stress. It’s all a bit too much, you know?”
The boy smiles shyly. “Hello.”
“Finished”, Draco whispers and turns off the water.
with Draco. And he really doesn’t wish for Draco to think that he might want something sexual from him.
Draco shrugs. “Yes. Because it does mean nothing. What’s your problem?”
Draco pushes Harry off of him gently and Harry rolls onto his back. Now, Draco lying on his side next to him, the blonde man watches him curiously.
“Have you not talked to anyone about this? Haven’t they told you what you’re supposed to do?”
“That’s my sister!”, Ron barks out a laugh and conjures glasses for everyone.
She nods surprised. “Oh, I didn’t think you’d remember my name.”
“Okay,
"Okay, what should I do?", Harry asks him feeling completely lost.
“I haven’t felt this peaceful in a really long time”, Harry eventually hums into Draco’s ear.
Draco eventually looks up. “I’m sorry for disappearing the other day.”
Draco gathers his things and puts them back inside his bag, turns off all the electricity and grabs his coat. The moment he looks up, he notices a beautiful raven-haired boy with cute glasses and impossible green eyes. Draco's breath catches in his throat and he’s mesmerized.
Luna giggles. “I know. It’s my favorite drink.”
Harry raises his eyebrow. “What?”
But the sight of the beautiful boy with black messy hair haunts him for the rest of the week.
“Harry, mate”, Ron says. “I think I’ve found Malfoy.”
Draco wants to say something but Neville interrupts him. “Shut up. He knows you’re not ready for more. You’re using that stupid excuse of being his professor for avoiding the real stuff - which is love. If you’d be completely honest with yourself you’d realise that you’re in love with him too. Have been since day one.”
* * *
Draco grins. His usually perfectly styled hair looks messy for once as if he had run his fingers through it multiple times.
Harry. The name suits him.
Gently, he pushes in a second finger. He tries to open Draco, lets him adjust to the new sensation step by step. Every now and then, he strokes Draco’s back for comfort. After he’s added a third finger and pushed in and out for another couple of minutes, Draco nods.
Slowly and hesitant, Draco reaches out his hand and softly strokes Harry’s hair. “I’ve always wanted to do that. Since the first day we met.”
“Why don’t we hang around in the common room?”, he suggests as they pass the Fat Lady.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Just a habit.”
He did. Draco missed him like crazy. But he wouldn’t say that out loud.
Draco gives his best friend a death glare and takes a bite of his lasagna. " I don’t want to talk about it anymore. This conversation is giving me a headache.”
“Still. He wouldn’t have spent all of this time with you if he found you annoying and ugly. He obviously cares about you. And who knows, maybe he feels even worse than you do because he thinks you’re not interested in him!”
This is absolutely amazing. Harry has never felt like this before. And then, he opens his eyes and looks at the man in front of him. He watches Draco’s face. He notices the fluffy and tender state of Draco’s blonde hair. He realizes how smooth and soft Draco’s skin actually is. His eyes slide lower to Draco’s throat. Harry feels a strong desire to kiss his neck. He’s never seen someone so
Draco nods. “Always thought your hair looked hideous and it needed my special hands to style and tame them.”
Neville presses his lips together. “You can’t expect him to just come running towards you.”
Harry actually laughs out loud now. He tilts his head back and wipes away a few tears forming in his eyes.
Harry lowers his hands and begins to unbutton Draco’s belt and jeans. He pushes them down as far as possible. Draco helps him with his own jeans.
Harry breathes heavily, the rhythm of his hips stuttering as he holds on to Draco’s shoulder with one arm, the other arm reaches around Draco’s torso and grabs his pulsing cock. He begins to massage him, matching the rhythm of his hips.
,” Draco moans. “Please, hurry up!”
find me attractive now?”
“Sorry, but I really can’t”, Harry says. Even if he wanted to leave, his overprotective heart would stop him from doing so.
Harry frowns confused. “Then, why did you?”
Harry’s hand travel lower, resting over the other man’s stomach. Then, he slides his hand into Draco’s boxers and begins to massage his cock slowly.
Harry opens his eyes. “Do you mean –“
Draco frowns. “The lines were starting to blur?”
“It’s beautiful here”, Draco speaks and for a moment, they simply stand in the middle of the sand dunes, watching the ocean and the beach. Harry hasn’t felt this peaceful in months. He squeezes Draco’s arm and feels a weird tightness in his chest.
Draco rips off his tie and furiously fumbles with the buttons of his shirt. “Fuck, Harry, help me take this off. It’s way too hot, I can’t breathe. I feel like suffocating.”
“What exactly?”
Harry nods. “Yeah, I get that. Sounds awful.”
He paused and glanced between the pair, making both look down guiltily. The pair sat silent as they waited for Blaise to finish. He took a deep breath then rubbed at his temples before continuing again.
"I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific, my pet. What do you need? From whom?" Harry asked, pressing a finger in alongside the plug. He tugged at his rim, loving the feeling of Draco stretched around him. His pet let out a sharp gasp, eyes snapping open, wide, and pleasure dazed.
Disgust.
"I did it! I told them." Draco smiled easily, situating himself next to a blinking Harry. He casually wrapped his arms around one of Harry's and lent against him as he continued to speak.
Harry whipped his head back to face the doorway. He'd recognize that voice anywhere because it was distinctly peppered with a soft French lilt, though he'd never admit it.
Draco could hear Luna speaking frantically, he couldn't recall her ever doing anything frantically before, why did she sound so far away?
are you on about? What-"
"Dray, Dray! Breathe, please. You're hyperventilating, I need you to breathe!"
"And you and I will be discussing this later, although, I wouldn't mind doing some more of this later either," Draco said, planting a few chaste kisses onto Harry's lips. His brain seemed to short circuit at the action and all Harry could manage to do was nod dumbly in response, wrapping his arms around the blonde.
"Now, come here. This isn't just for you, you know."
"Alright, alright, it's fine right there. Set it down and we'll have some tea and biscuits." Draco said, smiling as they put it down with grumbles and Pansy walked over swatting at both of them.
His pleasant reverie came to an abrupt stop when someone began pounding on his front door.
With that he drew back and smiled venomously, patting the older man’s cheek. It was a purely condescending gesture and Harry watched as Lucius angrily threw his head in the opposite direction of his touch. Like he was poison, like it burned. Harry hoped it did.
"You wouldn't know how to mend a broken heart would you?" He asked cryptically, almost wistfully, as he dropped his hand again and drank some more of the tea.
Draco cringed at the words but Blaise only smiled wryly. He tugged Draco against his side and pulled them both down into the grass of his front yard. It probably wouldn't be long till Isaac got there, he always was impeccable with arriving on time, they might as well spend what they had left outside. The blonde sat cross-legged beside him and laced their fingers together.
Même s'il est une brute, c'est une jolie. = Even if he is a brute, he's an attractive one.
shields. But he doesn't. He can't. If Draco lets himself feel this it will kill him. He
"You won't. I've got you, my darling, my Draco. I'm here, just let go. I'll keep you safe." He speaks it like a promise and the word safe is what does Draco in. It's all he wants. All he's wanted for a long time. Safety.
"He called you a fool. Suggested you would end up poisoned just as your father did for disagreeing with his wishes," Draco began to ascend the steps to the dais as he spoke, "His disrespect of you was cause enough, but it was his veiled threat of your downfall that I could not let pass."
Please take care of yourself and be careful while reading!
"Well? Aren't you going to say anything?"
Harry led Draco over to the back room where Ron and the others were sitting along his sofa.
Just as they went to part ways Hermione broke the silence with a dully spoken excuse.
He pressed the tip of his wand further into his neck, if it had been a knife it would have more than drawn blood, and leant in leaving them nearly nose to nose, his voice dangerously low as he continued, "Draco is a
"Lord above, I don't know, Blaise. This is all such a mess!" He groaned, dropping his head in his hands as he went. Draco heard Blaise sigh as he tugged Draco's hands off of his face.
he'd spat back, fury in his eyes, utter revulsion and hatred. It had sent a strange pang of shame and pride through Draco's body. He'd never had the boldness to do anything so blatantly defiant. Then he'd seen the boys tie. It was red and gold and an act of defiance in and of itself. A flash of Harry's face had crossed his mind and he knew he needed to protect the insufferable brat causing such trouble.
"Yes."
"Oh, er, hello." Draco hovered on the last step looking at the boy, Harry, presumably.
"Harry!" He shouted excitedly, nearly jumping into the other boy's lap when he pulled him into a hug and startling the others out of their kissing.
Harry watched the blonde in question laugh at something one of his fathers had said. The seemingly carefree smile and eyes alight with amusement struck Harry. He'd never seen anyone as breathtakingly gorgeous as him before. Damn himself for changing schools last year when he could've been around someone so bloody attractive every day. He didn't know how Ron did it without staring at Draco all the time. If he had the chance, he'd be all over him in seconds.
, I-"
This time Harry didn't stop himself from peppering his wet cheeks with kisses. He covered his pets face in kisses and he didn't stop till he felt Draco quirk a small smile.
breathe calmed him a little.
Shouting came next, followed by a door slamming loudly, another thud and then what sounded like crying. The fact that all of these sounds were filtering through Draco's ceiling made it finally click for him. It was Harry's flat again. Bloody hell.
"Please," Draco begs weakly, "Please, they're dirty. I-I hurt, I
He'd spent the better part of the day feeling empty and lifeless. No tears had made an appearance and he hadn't crumpled to the floor sobbing just yet, but he hadn't planned on feeling so worthless after telling his father everything either. Draco had mostly felt numb.
Draco gave Harry his signature Malfoy smirk, mischief glinting in his eyes as he placed his hands on top of Harry's and pulled them away.
He did
me. Like I was broken Harry, or I'd caught some sort of disease! He spent a month drilling into my head exactly what was expected of me, an heir, a perfect little pure-blood bride for a wife." Draco said bitterly he face twisting in disgust. He still couldn't believe, after all of this, he still wanted his fathers' love.
"So I-"
Draco hadn't seen Pansy and Blase since they'd moved two weeks ago. The trio had texted and called and video chatted since he'd left but it wasn't the same. So, against his better judgment, he conceded.
Ça va, mon bébé? = Are you okay, my baby?
"And I love you."
Cela ne se reproduira plus. = This will not happen again.
"Not a slut, but maybe a man-whore. Ack! You asked!"
"I will not have it, you are my
"Harry," Draco sighs a little, "I really wish you wouldn't tell me these things without discussing them with Dudley be-"
Harry still wasn't sure what exactly had happened. And as much as he had wanted to pull Ron into a bone-crushing hug, it seemed as though Draco was handling him rather well and he wasn’t even sure how to help the situation. He'd gathered that 'Mione had done something. Something awful by the looks of it. Especially since he had just pushed her out of the flat with an apologetic smile. He'd have to ask Ron once he had calmed down enough. And Hermione as well, and soon, there always were two sides to everything and he needed both if he was going to try and help. Plus they were Hermione and Ron, whatever it was it couldn't be the end of them. Not even a war had ended them. Harry wasn't sure what he would do if his best friends hated each other all of a sudden. Once he knew what was wrong then he could fix it.
"Draco, I know this is difficult. I can tell you care about this, about Harry, but it sounds like you've already realized that you can't do anything." Blaise said softly, as he held one of Draco's hands, rubbing his thumb over the back of it in a comforting manner. He hated when Blaise pointed things like that out, especially when he was right.
No touching be damned! If he got punched for trying to comfort his boyfriend, then so be it. Draco grabbed Harrys’ wrists softly, pulling them away from all the glass. And he watched as Harry’s entire body stiffened, eyes shutting so tightly it almost looked painful.
unless something is wrong or I'm in a panic."
"Hmm?" Draco hummed his eyes blinking groggily as he sat up and winced. "Ahh, my head."
"Hello, my names Harry Potter. I live just across the street and a mate of mine goes to Hogwarts with your so-"
"That- that sounds good. I think I'll do that. Just-not today, and I don't...I don't know if I'd be comfortable sharing it with-with all of your friends but maybe just you, Luna, and Dudley would be okay."

. And he feels like a
later that week. It surely was a sight to behold, the big bad Lucius Malfoy splayed halfway up a wall by a teenager on a rampage. He could see the headlines now,
Draco carefully walked towards Harry and sank to the floor beside him.
"Draco, dear, how lovely to see you! I-"
"But, Pansy, the brownies are done!"
"STOP!" He yells the word frantically, Harry halts his movements.
dégueu = yucky
But mostly he just feels useless and sorry so very sorry.
"The boy is not worth King Riddle's anger! He is
shag. And I did no such thing. I didn’t do anything to her that she didn’t beg me for.”
"Look, it was dark, alright! Jeez, 'Mione it's not like I would've done it if I'd known they were playing around." Harry said defensively as he grabbed at her wrist before she could smack him again. Hermione retracted her hand and sighed. She shook her head, pressing her fingers to her temple.
between my legs, as you've so distasteful put it, is your Prince Consort. You will do well to show him respect! You will know your place!"
The two boys exchanged a look which consisted of Harry glaring and Blaise studying him closely. A long beat of silence followed. If that wasn't awkward enough, Isaac decided to pull up on the curb, right at that moment, the headlights of the vehicle putting them all in a spotlight. Sometimes Draco swore he was in some bad romance novel. Ever the peacemaker Blaise offered him a hand to shake, which Harry took, albeit begrudgingly.
"I'm sorry, Dragon.
"Then who was it and what happened?
"Here we are." Harry half-shouted to be heard over the music. He leant against the wall as if to wait for Draco to be finished. He really couldn't handle that right now.
"Such a pretty, pretty boy," Theodore grinned dangerously, his tongue flicking across his bottom lip as he pressed his knee between Draco's legs. "I wonder, will you scream out in English or French? What do you think,
"This was-"
Like he hadn't just admitted to being in love with me or nearly kissed me! And he hasn't spoken to me since! What in Merlin's name am I supposed to
Rage blossomed in Harry's chest like a roaring wildfire as he shoved his books into the nearest students’ arms, which just so happened to be Ron, and stormed toward the two Malfoy's. His eyes were blazing with anger as he whipped out his wand and harshly pressed it into Lucius Malfoy's neck, completely unfazed by the Death Eater. He stood between one of the most infamous dark wizards and Draco without an ounce of fear. He vaguely remembered Draco calling him stupidly heroic and awfully Gryffindor-ish earlier that year as he did so. Draco was probably correct.
"Draco. I know you can hear me, just listen."
He's scared. So, so scared. He isn't ready. He'll never
Pettigrew was incongruous when compared to Harry's other advisors; Lord Sirius Lupin-Black who was dangerously charming, incurably strong-willed, and loyal to a fault, Lord Remus Lupin-Black who was a sneaky sort of clever that left even the most brilliant confounded, Lady Minerva Mcgonagall who was more courageous and honest than any man he'd ever met, Lady Arabella Figg deceivingly kind to the point where people couldn't help, but to tell her secrets, even his least favorite, Doctor Severus Snape who was both calculated and cold in equal measures was better than him and he did nothing, but grate Harry's nerves. Compared to just the handful Harry thought up, Pettigrew was nothing, but a dirty coward. Harry fixed him with a withering glare and continued.
Draco scanned the floor of his newly bought flat and suppressed a groan at all the boxes laid about. He'd definitely have to ring up Pansy, and the boys to help him unpack and organize everything.
." Sirius said softly as he wrapped his arms around the both of them and planted a kiss on his forehead. The trio stayed like that for a while, Sirius rocking them ever so softly until Draco calmed down and fell asleep, no doubt, from the exhaustion of the night.
With those words and one last meaningful look, Draco turned to leave. There wasn't anything else he could do. He heard the man clear his throat just as he was going to step away, so he turned towards Harry quickly as to not miss his words.
"Now, you are going to tell us exactly as much as you want or need to. We'll discuss whatever you want, leave out the bits you don't, then I'll hunt-"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Weas- I mean,
"Nah, not my fight, mate. I'm not about to get in between that." Ron shook his head, and let Hermione continue.
"Now, wait a minute. Blaise."
Harry sat propped up against the pillows an armful of pretty blond. Draco was curled up against his body, a shaky hand clinging to his shirt as they cuddled in a cot. Despite the near foot he had over Harry he always was more of a little spoon.
A plea. his voice bordering on begging. This time he does. Harry should never have to beg someone so monstrous for anything, it's wrong.
draco has a panic attack, a brief mention/discussion of rape
Harry brought a hand up to run through his hair in frustration. He glanced at Draco's front door once again with a defeated look and then wandered across the street back to his own house.
"Okay...so what's your question then?" Draco asked, he drew his legs to his body, flicking the phone to speaker, and set it down before wrapping his arms around his knees. He wasn't sure how he felt about where this was going but he knew it would be easier to talk about with his arms around himself. There was something oddly comforting knowing he had to autonomy to hold himself, to leave the room, the conversation if he needed to.
Draco pressed a few peppery kisses to Harry's neck,
Anger swirled in his stomach and he wanted to hate her for it. Couldn’t she simply go off and find some foreign rich man or woman that none of them knew who would dote on her endlessly instead? She hadn’t even
"Don't
"I'm so sorry, please, I can fix-"
"Hey, what can-Harry? W-what happened?" Draco asked, his stomach dropping, suddenly, he felt stressed and anxious and sick all over again.
happened? How many new bruises had Harry received from this last round of beatings? Gods, Draco felt sick. He needed to tell someone before the worry ate him alive.
"I love you Pans, you too Blaise. Thank you." Draco said placing a kiss on both of his friends' cheeks. He leant against Blaise and held onto Pansy's hand firmly as he dove into all the horrid feelings and thoughts he'd been having ever since Nott had harassed him.
Riddle always picked his words with meticulous care, made sure they were full of fake endearments, and cutting enough to leave Draco believing no one else could ever love him as Riddle did. He didn't think Harry had the focus nor the malicious intent to be able to say such backhanded things.
"The muggle relatives I lived with um..."
"Harry, dear," Draco called, giving him concerned eyes, "Would you please, get a pair of pyjamas for Ron? I think some of mine will fit. Oh, and cast a few freshening up charms on the guest bed, please."
know you, not really, but I'd like to."
"You know you're allowed to have other friends, right?"
Draco also knew that Harry felt so much guilt over the war. He had convinced himself that all the death and fighting was his fault and he constantly made himself a martyr in his own mind, seemingly forgetting Voldemort's part in the war completely. And although Draco did not agree nor understand he did know that he would
"Of course, would I ever lie to you, love?" Harry replied raising an eyebrow at Draco, almost as if to dare him to say otherwise. The other boy shook his head, no. A smug look crossed Harry's face, his nose wrinkling in amusement, as he poked his tongue out to tease Draco. He giggled shamelessly and stroked the back of Harry's neck fondly.
"Draco, love," Harry asked groggily from the steps, rubbing his eyes, still half asleep. "What's with the shouting? What's happening?"
, kill him now. He quickly turned back around and gave his fiancé a panicked look. Harry then had the audacity to prop himself up on his elbows and instead of clarifying the situation, he shot them a smug grin.
"No." Ron said softly, in a subdued tone that was so unlike him, "I-I don't know how I would react. I'm not sure what I would say, or do. I-I think-I think it would break me."
He smiled fondly at the thought, his gorgeous wife with her tongue poking out of her mouth as she concentrated on reading something. He still couldn't believe someone as brilliant and beautiful as her had married him not even after being married for over two years.

Non, Papá, non! Il aidait! = No, papa, no! He was helping!
Harry glanced up at him when he spoke and bit his lip like he was stopping himself from responding. So, Draco continued,
Draco gave him a sweet smile and leant up to kiss him, only for Ron to burst into the Hospital Wing with a loud slam of the doors and Harry's books in tow.

him, it made Draco's skin itch. But he didn't see anyone who looked even remotely familiar. It made Draco want to curl up and hide.
Harry slowly rose from his spot on the floor and followed the directions. The position Draco had put him in offered no support and they both knew holding it would make the punishment seem so much longer.
Draco's eyebrows knitted together, a sad smile resting on his face, he hated that Harry felt guilty for what those nasty muggles did to him as a child. And he hated that he hadn't known till now, if he ever saw one of them in public he'd hex them into oblivion. Not even Merlin,

Hermione swatted at her girlfriend, shaking her head fondly when Pansy gave her a quick peck on the cheek to placate her even though it came with a mischievous smile.

"'Mione is cheating on me with Parkinson. Caught them in her-
"Totally whipped." Ron said looking at Harry with a shake of his head.
Harry could still recall dozens of shouting matches between the two on bar nights when Draco had finally mustered up the nerve to invite his friends along. How they had transformed that sort of volatile relationship into a romance was beyond him.
." She growled releasing him and rushing towards the front door.
Theodore threw his head back and laughed. "Can't hold your liquor, pretty boy?" He sniggered taking a swig of whatever it is he was drinking. Draco wanted to go home. This was not what he had signed up for. What time was it anyway?
"Well, if you change your mind-"
Riddle.

"You aren't going to ask what happened? Not gonna ask what's
The couple held each other for a long while after, neither ready to let go of the other quite yet. Dinner was left forgotten on the cold stove.
? What happened? Why were you out so late? Why didn't you answer your phone? And why do you look like you've been crying, Draco?"
Hermione had cheated on Ron with Pansy Parkinson. Who was not only a
"I've asked you to refrain from killing my staff without reason, have I not, sweet one?"
Blaise pointedly switched his focus from Pansy to him.
-love me anymore?" His voice broke a little and he looked so small. Smaller than Harry could ever remember him being. Draco stood looking like a ghost, silently shaking and Harry could see the panic and unshed tears in his eyes.
He tries to get away from him, scrambles off of his broad chest, and tries to pull far far away. Draco doesn't deserve to touch someone so good with his hands that have hurt and maimed and-and
"You are happy here. Right mate?" Theo asked quietly, after a beat or two of silence, his and Blaise's hands tangled together. Draco smiled at them out of the corner of his eye. He knew, as much as they liked to say they were casual, that they were end game for sure. He and Pansy had even gone as far as to discuss what their future wedding might look like.
The pair stood staring into one another's eyes until Harry heard Ron shout from somewhere within the crowd.
"I suppose it was a funny way of doing it, but it worked."

"Draco!" The quick snap of Dudley's voice drew him back out of his head, "Stop thinking for a second. Focus on something else. Here."

fallen into bed with her, while married. She fidgeted under his gaze and ducked her head before looking back up with tears in her eyes.
"Then perhaps you can tell me why you've been so snappish and huffy at me all day? Or why exactly you feel the need to disrespect Blaise and cut our visit short. That man has only ever been kind to you; he always brings you little trinkets from when he travels and he always shares his stories with you, so why in
Draco sighed and stopped himself. He dug his nails into the palms of his hands painfully. He wouldn't try to defend himself anymore, not to the likes of him. If this is what his father wanted, then so be it. He wasn't worth the effort anyway.
Draco and Pansy had arranged for two of Harry's old school mates to meet them there. Harry had shown Draco a photo of all three of them in his 4th year just before they'd graduated and he'd told him about how he regretted losing touch with them once school had ended. So, being the amazing boyfriend he was, Draco snapped a photo of the picture and sent it to Pansy with their names asking her to help find them. Pansy then hired a private investigator, a little over the top if you asked Draco, and made quick work of finding Hermione Jean Granger and Ronald Billius Weasley.
"Do you know why we are in here Harry?" Draco's voice was stern as he walked toward his desk on the right-hand side of the room, just next to the bathroom door.
"Come now, my love," Harry whispered against his neck, nibbling at his jaw, breath ragged as he continued the merciless snap of his hips into Draco's poor, stretched out and sloppy hole. Draco whimpered at his words, hands grasping at his shoulders painfully, nails piercing his brown skin.
quoi = what
"Dance with me, Luv." His words came out more as a statement than a question as he interrupted Draco once again and pulled him up off of the sofa. Oh, Lord.
"Yes, love?" Draco asked as he finished buttoning up his shirt and turned to face his boyfriend of three months. Harry gave him a coy smile, his pretty green eyes, something Draco could never get enough of, full of mischief. He grabbed Draco's hand tugging him down till their faces were mere inches from each other.
"-like being touched, got it. Won't happen again, I promise." Harry said, giving Draco what he hoped was a reassuring look. The blonde nodded stiffly and Harry gestured for him to follow along.
Draco smiled apologetically as he stood up from his seat and Blaise followed suit.
. I fucked up."
"The past three days, but not today. I didn't today."
Harry wished Draco didn't need to thank him for being a decent person towards him. It felt wrong and weird. Everyone should be respectful of other's boundaries, especially such physical ones. He nodded.
"How you view me, Draco, matters more than anyone else. Their words carry no weight, no value in comparison. Not even big bad Death Eater, Mr Malfoy."
A loud crash, one that sounded an awful lot like glass shattering, cut Draco off from finishing his statement. The sound had come from the flat above his and he drew his eyebrows up in confusion, then shrugged. Someone had most likely just dropped something, it was fine.
"Go on then, Harry, or we'll be out here all night."
Harry wasn't Riddle.
it will.
"Draco!" Harry shouted reaching out towards him as he fell down with wobbly legs. God, Draco really hated the after-effects of having a bad attack. He wished his body would calm down quicker. That mixed with whatever Nott had put in his drink, wasn't exactly helping.
as you put it. And I don't date so if that's what this-" Draco began defensively, dropping his arms down to his sides and then wrapping them protectively around his middle.
"What do you think, darling?" She asked tossing her head to the side and glancing at Draco with her perfectly winged eyeliner.
"Do you remember the last thing you said to me the last time we spoke, love?"
," Ron grinned, turning to face Blaise and yanking him down by the collar till they were full-on snogging for nearly an entire minute.
"Hermione, get out. Don't make this difficult-"
"I know. I love you, too." Harry replied.
"Hands on the edge of the desk and bend over."
The redhead only snorted in reply and bumped shoulders with a glowering Harry as they finished their food. He did not
Draco shouldn't be able to cry. His shields are slipping and he knows it. He hates it. He doesn't reach a hand up to wipe them away. He lets himself be kissed on the forehead. Let's himself be pulled over towards the fire and cradled into a warm embrace. Draco's tucked against a scorching body on the sofa and a blazing fire just beside them. He should be burning alive but he still feels ice cold.
After leaving the manor in an almost trance like state, Draco had spent time wandering around a muggle park Harry took him to for one of their first dates.
"Evening, Harry."
"Alright, I'll have Luna put us in a group chat and we'll plan something simple, fun."
He said nothing as he watched Madame Pomfrey clean up his boyfriend. He silently pet Draco's hair and rubbed his back soothingly as she gave him a calming draught for the panic attack that seized him after he'd snapped out of his stunned stupor. Harry stayed that way as she healed him and finally finished flitting around them anxiously, leaving them alone with an exasperated huff.
"I'm not a victim."
Harry let himself melt into Draco's touch as he pulled Harry down into his chest. Harry's arms wrapped around Draco neck, his head resting on one of his shoulders while Draco had one hand stroking his hair and neck, the other holding Harry around his waist. Their bodies pressed together, both feeling marginally more relaxed than they had before.
"Are you implying I don't have friends?" Draco arched his eyebrow in a questioning manner as Harry fidgeted more. That
"Er, mind showing me to your bathroom?" Draco asked, trying his best to keep the polite smile on his face. It had been a while since he'd had to actively interact with so many people and seeing Luna for the first time since he'd frozen her out had taken a toll on him. He needed a moment to himself.
"It's alright. Not every day you get a" --he looked him up and down then beamed-- "cute french boy falling for you, now is it?" The boy said licking his cupid's bow lips.
"Hmm?" The ginger-haired boy looked up from his phone and glanced at Harry who was staring blatantly at his new neighbour across the street.
"I know."
"I think not! He won't be seeing the likes of you anymore, not while he lives under my roof. You've filled that boys head with enough nonsense and I won't stand for it!" Vernon yelled, then promptly slammed the door in his face. Draco was fuming.
He wonders.
, that someone would walk in and stop Theodore. He wished he had never left the house. All he wanted was his dad and his papá. He wanted to wake up to Blaise's snoring and Pansy poking his cheek and realize this to be one horrible nightmare. But this wasn't a nightmare and this boy was
Draco scrunched his eyes tighter and tried to focus on the new voice that seemed to breach its way through the chaos. He felt rough hands grab his and press them down on someone's chest. The hands held his there firmly and covered his small ones almost completely. Draco felt the rise and fall of their chest as they breathed in and out slowly.
"Dad!" Draco said accusingly, folding his arms across his chest as his father walked in carrying two mugs full of hot cocoa instead of three. Now Draco knew they were actually making him go to the party across the street.
"Sorry I grabbed you like that, I didn't know how else to calm you down. I know you don't like being touched but it always works when my cousin has one of his...um...his father was horrible, but, anyway, sorry." Harry scratched the back of his neck guilt written all over his face. And Draco just stared.
to go after him? Send an owl?" Pansy asked raising a brow at him.
He watched as Draco yanked his arm from Lucius and hurried over to help him up with a soft smile that Harry returned. Harry held firmly to the blond's hand and gave it an encouraging squeeze as Draco faced his horrid father.
“Yes, I expected as much. Bloody Gryffindors and their need to hold grudges.” She said flippantly, throwing her manicured hand about as though to wave away the thought. Draco soured at the comment. His silver eyes narrowed at her and he sat up, properly this time, to watch how she reacted to what he said next.
, Draco." Blaise breathed as he lifted himself to face Pansy and exchanged a look with her.
"Poor, Princess Pansy, having to visit her dearest friend in squalor, so terribly close to peasants, however will she survive?" Draco cried dramatically, leaning his hip against the counter as he waited, a snooty smirk plastered on his face.
"His name's Draco-something. He's quiet, bookish, think he's on the swim team? I reckon he and Mione'd get on if he ever put his books down long enough to speak." Ron said, shrugging lightly. He'd known Harry for years and had since become accustomed to his fixations on the people he fancied, boys and girls alike. That and he really wanted the food Harry had promised him earlier.
But he had to stop. If Draco didn't stop now he knew he might never be able to put all the pieces back together. He needed to be strong because if he lost it now it meant his father won. And he couldn't let him win.
French Translations
Draco's face was flushed and his hair was in disarray. He turned the faucet on and splashed some water onto his face. Running a hand through his hair, he took a deep breath.
"Please what, sweet thing? What is it you want?"
and his all body encompassing sobbing morphed into small and quiet whimpers, Draco decided it was safe to move away from him for a second. He knew the reason Harry hadn't moved was because he was waiting for another smack, but it would never come. Instead, Draco walked over to the dresser on the other side of the room and grabbed a pair of pants and one of his shirts. He knew Harry always felt more comfortable in one of his shirts after a punishment.
to call his Draco a slag, a common whore.
Draco lugged the last two boxes into his new flat. One pushed through the door by his foot and the other in his arms. He settled them both on the ground and sighed with content. Finally, he had all of the boxes out of his car, even if it had taken all day.
"I hate this," Draco whispered, leaning back in his chair and shutting his eyes. "I wish I didn't care so much."
Draco lay diagonally on the couch with Harry resting between his legs, Harry's back pressed against his chest. He had one arm wrapped around Harry's belly and the other over his arms. Draco's head resting on one of Harry's shoulders as he planted a few small kisses to the side of his face. Draco could still feel the slight tremble in Harry's body and he subconsciously held him tighter.
"Hold on, sorry, back up a second. Who's Harry?" Pansy asked snuggling a pillow to her chest.
He stormed over to the shocked couple and continued to speak, his voice steadily rising to a yell.
good care of me toni-”
"And do you know why I am so upset?"
"Upstairs, bedroom. Strip,
"I was just saying, Remus.
"Protect me, yes, I'd gathered that much, Potter. You've said so yourself multiple times." Draco huffed, folding his arms across his chest as he continued to glare Harry down.
Harry grabs a box filled with stamps from the cupboard on the left and transfigures one of them into fairy lights. Then, he transfigures the others into Christmas tree baubles and tree decoration.
The whole situation is getting messy. Draco thinks about Harry nonstop. He wants to see him, talk to him, be around him. It's crazy.
It’s almost like a book, it can tell stories. But the images are already acted out on the screen with sounds. The pictures move fluently.”
The door opens, and Draco’s head pops through the door. “I saw the light in your room. I figured you couldn’t sleep either, so I thought I’d knock.”
“I thought of you screaming my name. I pictured me riding you.”
Harry shakes his head again. He sighs. “I don’t know. I just don’t like talking about sex in general. It’s super private.”
Harry doesn’t want to think about the fact that
Malfoy doesn’t say anything. He gives him the time he needs. When Harry feels a little calmer, he opens his eyes again and sees Draco leaning against the door watching him. Harry feels exhausted now.
They rush through the club, they open the bathroom door and lock it.
Harry can’t hold himself back any longer. He slams into Draco full force, grabs his skin tightly and he’s sure there are going to be bruises tomorrow. “Draco! Fuck.”
Harry shakes his head. “No, I’m serious. I’ll stay here.”
“A bad kind?”
Draco presses his lips together. Then, he takes a deep, steadying breath. He squeezes his eyes shut and rushes the words out as if to get them over with as quickly as possible. “I fancy the shit out of you, Potter.”
They both walk towards the Great Lake, both keeping their distance.
“Yeah, I’m okay”, he presses out. “Please just leave me alone.”
Harry’s eyes shoot wide open. “Say that again.”
“Fuck. Ok. I’m in.”
Harry shakes his head and shuffles closer, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. “No, it doesn’t. I get what you mean.”
Draco huffs and runs a hand through his hair. He seems very tired. There are dark shadows under his eyes and he looks a bit slimmer than usual. Harry's heart clenches. “Hi.”
“I don’t know if the cake is any good”, Harry apologizes. “I’m not the best baker, to be honest.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Potter. I just really want to get laid. I’ll go insane if I don’t. And this is a perfect opportunity. A one-time thing. We’ll do this once, tonight. We’ll release some pressure, help each other out, and then we’ll go back to how it was before. I mean, we don’t even have a relationship that we could risk. We’re literally former arch enemies. What is there to lose?”
“Shut up!”, Draco shouts. “Do you have any idea how fucking lost I felt without you? I’ve literally gone crazy without you! How could you just disappear and not call, not text back, not say anything?”
Draco nods and sits down at the table, Harry sits next to him. He watches the blonde man open the present carefully.
“What is your favorite cake?”
Draco immediately follows his lead. The way Draco moans into the kiss is mesmerizing. He kisses him back just as passionately. After making out for what feels like hours, they pull apart.
Draco continues to massage his shoulders for a couple more minutes. Then, he washes his hair again and makes sure that all of the potions are washed out.
He finds Hermione at the bar and rushes up to her. “Hermione!”
“Oh”, Ron looks surprised. “Really? You’ve come to your senses then?”
Draco doesn’t have time to disagree, she’s hung up the phone before he could answer.
“For fuck's sake, Potter, no.”
Harry eventually decides to leave Hogwarts as well. Hermione, Ron, Harry, and Neville head to the Burrow on Friday evening.
– No. He’s not going there! He can’t allow himself to go in that direction.
Draco gets up and steps closer to Harry. “I want to watch.”
Draco licks his lips and stares at Harry for a while. He clears his throat, lost in his thoughts. “Yeah, I guess I do.”
He can see some of his students eagerly writing the stuff down. Draco smiles. „You don’t have to write all of this down, I have printed the information for you. I’ll hand them out later.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “I have to send these to the office.”
Harry licks his lips, but nods. His hand leaves Draco’s thigh, and his mouth Draco’s neck.
Neville seems caught. He clears his throat.
Harry continues to watch him until his eyes are closing and he eventually falls asleep on the couch.
“See you in two weeks!”, Draco says and waves at the students. They wave back and hurry out of the lecture hall.
“You don’t know that. He’s not like that.”
Harry holds his breath for a moment. His heart is probably going to explode any minute now. “Merry Christmas, Draco.”
He notices that the loo is actually a tiny bathroom with one toilet and a sink. So much for space.
It all would have been fine. Draco finishes his lecture, smiles at the applause he receives and starts packing away his stuff. Then, he waits for the beautiful student to approach him again. Instead, the boy exists the lecture hall talking passionately to a male student with bright red hair. Draco frowns.
Draco notices Harry's presence way too clearly and even though he's soaking wet, he begins to feel hot all over his body.
But he won’t do it. He’s too scared of ruining things between them, and he doesn’t want Draco to feel uncomfortable.
She smiles when she seems him. “Harry! You look great. Ginny was right, green looks good on you.”
Draco relaxes but chooses to ignore how his heart stings at the realisation that Harry joked about wanting to see him more.
“Draco”, Harry whispers “Maybe we can fake this?”
“Are you ready?”, Harry whispers and Draco nods.
Draco shakes his head. “You wish, Potter.”
Harry sinks into Draco's arms and lets his head fall against his chest. He wraps his arms around the younger boy and presses soft kisses to his throat, jaw and neck.
“This is fantastic!”, Draco shouts in excitement. He looks like a proud puppy.
Draco stares at Harry in confusion. “Why are you so angry? Did I do something?”
“You’re doing what?!”, Ron asks, dumbfounded.
"Just to be clear: You're my boyfriend now, right?"
Draco frowns. “I don’t understand.”
Harry closes his eyes. “I’m sorry you have to go through this right now. And I honestly couldn’t care less about the past. We were both behaving like immature dicks.”
Even though that’s not really part of their just-a-shag agreement, Draco nods. “Of course.”
"Still wouldn't make moving on from you any easier."
Draco runs a hand through his hair. “Harry, I -“
"You on top of me, massaging me, kissing me, fingering me, fucking me...", Harry moans and sucks the soft skin on Draco's neck.
Neville rolls his eyes. “Wow, the Boy Who Lived really can be stupid, huh?”
Neville sits on the chair in front of the little desk and pulls back the blanket that was covering a big, bright yellow plant. Then, he begins to gently stroke her and whispers sweet things to her.
He begins to build up a steady rhythm with his tongue. Draco starts to move restlessly below him, arching his back and grabbing the sheets for support.
Harry takes a deep breath. “Yeah, I am. You?”
“Ummm.”
Harry sighs. “I don’t know…”
to be taken care of. I don’t know. That sounded really stupid.”
He puts on his coat, grabs his bag and walks up to the exit of the museum.
The man underneath him seems to relax at the touch.
“I guess they know?”, Draco asks quietly, pointing to Harry’s friends.
“This is nice”, Draco exclaims softly, eating his spaghetti. He seems so much younger. Harry wants to hug him and protect him from the world. Merlin, he needs to get a grip.
But then, there are also terrible ones like the one he's reading right now from someone called George Weasley. The poor boy didn't get the memo that he was supposed to write about the historical politician Napoleon and not about the company Napoleon producing grills.
It’s nice. Harry and Draco, cooking together in their little apartment, music playing in the background. Harry could get used to this. He probably shouldn’t.
“What?”
Harry smirks. "I know, babe. It'll be just as hard for me. Literally."
“Seems like you’re having lots of fun.”
Draco chooses to ignore the boy. He doesn’t look up as he grabs his belongings, he doesn’t search the room for messy black hair, he doesn’t feel tense when he walks past him and he
Draco laughs and decides he’s not going to tease Harry any longer.
“I wanted to touch you the second we left Hogwarts”, Harry admits. He knows he’ll regret this once he’s sober, but he can’t stop now.
Harry presses his lips together. He hates it when they are so straight forward. It makes him feel incredibly uncomfortable. “No, I’m good. Thank you.”
Harry groans and it almost sounds as if he's in pain.
“Do you want to try it?”, Harry asks and hands him the knife.
. Harry forces himself not to think about any of it.
Draco doesn’t move.
But still. Harry sits down next to Dean, Neville, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. He immediately begins to fill his plate.
Draco shrugs his shoulders. „ I don’t know. 24? Maybe 25.“
Draco smiles awkwardly, unsure what to say next.
Harry beams. “Are you serious?”
“You look great, Harry. Don’t worry. Whoever it is, they’ll be blown away”, Neville reassures him.
Every other student at Hogwarts behaves like a mentally insane person around him. They don’t act normal and he seriously begins to hate it. It stresses him out. Why can’t he have one normal conversation with someone who isn’t one of his best friends?
Harry chuckles softly. Draco almost doesn't hear his response over the pouring rain. „I see.“
It isn’t ‘whatever.’ Everybody knows that. But there’s nothing he can do about it. “I have to use the bathroom.”
Before Draco can ask what's wrong, Harry throws himself into Draco’s arms.
Draco presses his lips together and shakes his head. “I’m not comfortable with this.”
him with such soft, gentle eyes that Draco forgets everything he wanted to say.
“Okay”, Draco shouts and tries to focus on his task as a professor. He should not let Harry get to him that way. “Everyone listen up. Please build groups of five. We won’t be able to go up altogether, but with five people, we should be fine. We should have six groups. We’ll meet down here again in an hour!”
“Oh my god,” Draco cries. His body begins to go slack. “Please, please, Harry!”
Harry chuckles. “You know what? I actually prefer us this way.”
Harry smiles and pats the other side of his bed. “Yeah. Do you wanna sit here for a while and talk?”
Draco hiccups and snorts into his tissue.
When Harry wakes up a couple hours later, he knows something is wrong right away. The bed feels empty and cold. He reaches around, but Draco is nowhere to be seen.
Draco begins to bite his neck. He can feel himself growing harder each second. Draco’s hands roam all over Harry’s body, making him shiver. Finally, Harry turns around in Draco’s arms and begins to kiss him slowly. There's much more passion between them this time. There’s no need to rush anything.
What? No, no, no. He can’t come over. He couldn’t help himself if he saw shirtless Harry this close, this private, this intimate. Draco quickly fixes his hair, suddenly feeling very self-conscious about the stubbles on his jaw and straightens his pyjama.
Harry stares at his hands. He feels irritated. And somehow disappointed. “Okay.”
Neville raises an eyebrow. “Okay?”
Draco smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Well. I’d be a hypocrite if I had a problem with that.”
The mouse slowly moves closer. It grabs Harry’s finger with her little paws, places a piece of paper in it and then, happily takes the cheese. She stays where she is, hidden behind Harry’s bag, and eats the cheese.
She presses her lips together. After taking a long sip from her cocktail, she sighs. “We’re friends with him too, you know? We thought it’d be nice to invite him.”
Draco’s arms tighten around him. “Mhm. Don’t worry, you’re safe now.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry presses his lips together. “Yeah, same.”
Draco presses his lips together awkwardly. “The first.”
“Fuck,” Draco sighs. “God, Harry. You have no idea what you’re doing to me. Please, keep going.”
The evening comes quicker than expected and soon, the group finds themselves in front of the London Eye.
since he last saw Harry.
He takes a deep breath, wipes his hair out of his face and shakes his head.
Draco bites his lip. “Maybe we should stop with the Amortentia once and for all. It had to end eventually, anyway.”
Harry hums. “Lovely.”
"Hey", Harry greets him timidly.
Harry looks up, hair even messier than usual. "Oh, okay."
When Harry jumps off the Hogwarts Express, he feels a strange mix of joy and nostalgia. He made the right decision coming back for repeating his eighth year, that’s for sure. But he can’t help the memories of the war flooding in.
Draco wants to kiss that skin, feel it, touch it. Wait - where did that thought come from?
“Because you’re uncomfortable around me?
Draco clearly starts to freak out, his paranoid thoughts ruining his peace.
He only has time to apply some deodorant to make himself a little fresh, and then, there’s a knock and Draco knows he won’t be able to resist. He walks up to the door and opens it with trembling hands.
* * *
Harry hums as he listens to Draco’s gentle instructions. He shivers when water splashes over him. Then, Draco runs his hands through Harry’s hair softly, and Harry tries to suppress a soft moan. This feels too good.
Harry looks at him confused. He decides not to ask any questions and just accepts Malfoy’s wish. “Okay, but what can I do? And don’t say I should leave. I’m not going anywhere!”
Draco clears his throat and breaks the admiring gaze. „Where can I drive you?”
Draco shakes his head. "No, I don't. I only cuddle with my boyfriend."
“Hi,” Harry tries to break the uncomfortable silence between them.
Draco waves at him. “Yeah, me too!”
"I'm sorry. I had no idea", Harry says and genuinely means it. Watching Draco in so much pain was terrible. "I hope I never have to see you in so much pain again."
sparks Harry’s interest. “And who would that be?”
“Okay, okay”, Harry says and rushes towards Draco. He quickly unbuttons the shirt and helps Draco out of it.
“No, thanks. I’m good. I’ll stay here and chill for the night.”
They order, eat their lunch and chat about work. But Draco's mind stays focused on Harry the entire time, his mum's words echoing inside his brain.
Every other Partner that Draco has had (not that it had been many) has eventually annoyed the crap out of him. He simply enjoys his peace and quiet and most people don't respect that. They start a conversation with him after 30 minutes or they start getting really loud.
Draco nods. "That's great. Politics is always great to write about. You could analyze the differences between males and females in politics. Analyze their success, their popularity, what kind of criticism they get and for what they are being critizied. And then you can use Judith Butler to support your analysis."
Draco chuckles at Harry's eagerness and grabs his head with both his hands, stilling the boy. He kisses him passionately now, much slower, much more intimate.
Harry presses his lips together as Draco chuckles amused. He straightens himself and walks up to Harry. He holds his breath and anxiously waits for Draco’s next move.
Draco only nods, eyes squeezed shut in pain and shoulders shaking. “I can’t put into words how much.”
“For real?” Harry asks and moves away from Draco. He doesn’t want to allow him to back away now. “And you said
Harry tilts his head confused. “What do you mean?”
Ron claps his back. "I'm glad you got your shit together, mate!"
Harry shakes his head. “No. There are a million things I’d rather do.”
Suddenly, Draco huffs out a laugh. “Merlin, I can’t believe what just happened. I can’t believe we just did that!”
They sit down in a quiet corner. Harry orders pizza and Draco orders pasta with salmon.
Neville hands him a tissue and lays down next to Draco. He wraps his arms around his sad fried.
“So?”
“Don’t run away again.”
Draco should’ve known Harry would not let this thing between them go. He freaking should have known.
"You've been really sick, huh?", he whispers.
Draco watches him from the side. “What do you mean?”
Draco smiles.
Harry doesn’t know whether he wants to cry, or smile, or hug him, or kiss him. He feels his heart beating faster and faster.
Draco suddenly seems unsure.
Something has shifted last night. He can feel it. He simply cannot say what it is. And this morning has changed everything between them. Draco doesn't know what exactly happened between them, but the way Harry has looked at him before leaving Draco's room sends terrible shivers down his spine.
They stay like that for what feels like an eternity, both panting heavily and getting down from their high.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Um,” Harry exclaims. “Are you okay?”
Draco looks up as well and raises his eyebrows in confusion. "Excuse me?"
Harry shakes his head, blinking in irritation. “But, you’re attractive as fuck!”
“Any food wishes?”, Harry asks and Draco shakes his head.
Draco nods and gently bites into Harry’s shoulder. “Yeah. You smell like delicious marzipan.”
After about two hours, there's a knock on his door. Draco groans and runs a hand through his hair.
Draco seems to understand. He removes his hand, spreads some lube onto his dick, and positions himself. He kisses Harry’s neck to calm him.
Being just friends with Draco turns out to be so much harder than Harry originally had thought. Sure, Harry had noticed before that he felt strangely attracted to Draco. He had noticed weird feelings beginning to develop.
“Yeah. You make me really, really happy, you know.”
Harry sighs. “I have five essays to write.”
Draco tilts his head in confusion. He looks adorable.
So Draco nods. When he gets up, his hip brushes Harry’s hand accidentally. A shot of fire shoots through his body straight to his cock. He takes a sharp breath and avoids looking at Harry, instead looks down. He can feel the heat coming from Harry’s body. Since the aisle in the train is so small, Draco has nowhere to sidestep to.
He begins to rub his hands all over Draco’s arms and back and is relieved when Draco’s eyes flutter open.
Harry hides his face between his hands.
“Mhm. It always made you look so cute, sleepy, and confused. Like you just rolled out of bed.”
Harry watches him curiously. “Like what?”
“Um”, Harry says nervously. “How is that supposed to help us? Malfoy, you still haven’t explained to me what’s wrong.”
He doesn’t think because –
Harry only hums. “My focus might be on someone else.”
Harry chooses not to answer. Instead, he snuggles into the blankets and pulls Draco’s arms tighter around his body. “Please stay with me for the night.”
“That’s illegal.”
Draco turns around to see the person waiting in line behind him. His eyes widen at the sight of the young beautiful student in Nike sweatpants and a black sweater. His hair is sticking up in all different directions and his cheeks are a wonderful rosy colour.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry begins to stroke Draco’s hair gently. He doesn’t really know what to say. It confuses the hell out of him, seeing Draco so vulnerable, and all he wants to do is kiss him, hug him, squeeze him, and make him feel better.
The bottle spins, and it lands on Ron first. Harry doesn’t really register any of it.
Harry smiles and cuddles into Draco's arms. "Always."
“Uff. Okay. I don’t know. I’ve always wanted to be dominant, you know? I envied you for having your shit together all the time. I envied you for being so fucking brave and strong. Hell, I even envied your outbursts of aggression. So dominant and powerful. And sexy. I always wanted everyone to believe that I’m like that, too. That I could be a little bit like you. But I’m really not.”
Draco shrugs. “Um. I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do.”
But Draco has a good view of him. He's wearing a grey jumper and blue jeans. His hair is messy as usual and he looks incredibly attractive. Draco sighs.
Dean shrugs. “Sorry, mate. But we’re just trying to help, okay?”
Harry is still unsure. He doesn’t know what to do. Hogwarts is his home, after all. And he doesn’t want to allow the war to take over his precious Halloween feast. He used to love Halloween at Hogwarts. But he also doesn’t want his friends to spend Halloween without him.
Draco opens his mouth and closes it again in disbelief.
Harry points to the seat next to him near the window.
have let Pansy come and attack the man upstairs, instead.
"O-okay, I-I think I'd like that."
"I love you, my Harry, my darling."
a week." He grouched before turning to Draco with an altogether different look and demeanour.
. No. That wasn't correct.
? This was both unsettling and unbelievable. Hermione had never shown the slightest bit of interest in women before let alone gotten along with Parkinson of all people.
"Go on,
“And I know you, Pansy, you’re far too devious to ever be caught unless you wanted to be. You
"Tell Luna I said goodbye and to call me. And thank that Ginny girl for me. Goodnight, Harry."
Then he kissed her on both cheeks and walked out the front door.
He shouldn't be able to miss that right now.
Draco grinned at the irritated scowls Theo and Blaise carried and Pansy's utter obliviousness to it. He really appreciated his friends for helping him get settled into his new home and the entertainment they brought with them, too.
“You saw me this morning, you impossibly sappy man. And I’ll let you ‘take care of me’ as you put it, later when we get home. Yes?”
"You just wanted to see me. Don't lie to me and say that isn't what this is. I miss you too but-"
A litany of
haunt him. Draco wouldn't allow it.
"I-" He huffed out an awkward little laugh, "I guess so. I think I'd rather regret a compliment than not having said anything."
"What if-if they don't-
"Now, didn't you say something about biscuits, Draco?" Theo asked waggling his eyebrows at him. His notorious sweet tooth making Draco shake his head in fond exasperation.
Ron's heart clenched at the name.
"What's happening?" Theo asked as he and Blaise stood up and Pansy walked back into the room holding a bottle of Firewiskey, scanned the room and then set it down with a questioning look.
He smoothes out the wrinkles in between Harry's brows with a swipe of his thumb. And places a kiss there too. He hates to see him so exhausted with the weight of the world on his shoulders. He should have noticed sooner.
Blaise paused the movie and glanced at Draco with a look.
"Not a word, if I'm not allowed to go after and murder this Nott-boy, then I'm allowed to do this." She tutted continuing to coat his fingernails with careful and meticulous brush strokes. At least he knew it would look nice afterwards.
It has been a week and three days since Draco had last seen Harry and he had counted every second of it. The last time he'd been this stressed out and high strung was when some prick at school had threatened to out him to his parents. And his friends had noticed, which is why they were all piled around his coffee table sitting on the floor in front of the sofa and playing board games.
"Sweet one, what is it?" He asked again. He supported Draco with an arm around his back and reached the other up to cup his face. His pet leant into the touch, turning his head to kiss his palm.
He tried to avoid tugging at his jumpers already worn sleeves or chewing on his chapped lips. And politely declined Harry and thems offer to play football, settling for watching instead. He really just needed the peace of being alone for a while, only that wasn't what happened.
mentions of self-harm, draco talks about the incident at the party
"It's-but that's different. They-you can't control-"
Harry and Ron were walking through one of the outside corridors, returning to the common room after a day of classes, when the pair unexpectedly rammed into a bunch of other students. The two Gryffindor's exchanged exasperated looks. Large groups of students gathered together never meant good things for them. They usually ended in fights and house points being taken away. Reluctantly, they pushed past the dense and chattering crowd only to find Draco and an older wizard in the middle of it all.
"That's it! I am going to slaughter whomever this prick is, what was his name Draco? I swear to heaven above I will maul the bloody bastard!" Pansy snapped as she jumped off the bed and began to angrily pace the perimeter of the room.
"The things you do to me, Harry James Potter." Draco sighed over dramatically pulling a laugh from Harry as he went to make tea.
"Wanna talk about it?"
"I thought I could handle him on my own. I didn't think he would show up and make such a scene. I thought I could-could make him see reason about me, about us," Draco said, his voice getting quieter with each word, "It was childish, a stupid idea. I was being foolish, seeking his approval. I'm sorry for how useless I am, for dragging you into all this."
A loud voice called from inside the flat and Draco saw the young man visibly flinch. This was not good. This was terrible, actually. The man swallowed and looked back at Draco.
"You did what?!" Hermione gasped swatting at Harry's head as he tried to dodge her.
He looked up to find Lucius raising his wand at not him, but Draco with a malicious and manic grin on his face. Harry's eyes flared, his hand clenched around his wand as he lost complete control of his emotions which set off his magic as well. A strong wind whipped around him as he marched towards the Malfoy patriarch, a murderous look on his face.
"Lucius!" Narcissa said aghast, her face pale and ghost-like, almost as though she couldn't fathom what she'd just heard her husband say. She stumbled to her feet and latched onto his arm, giving him pleading eyes but Lucius didn't spare her so much as a glance.
Draco bit back an apology and opted for a sympathetic smile instead. He hated it when people apologized, he figured Dudley might feel the same.
Instead, a fat, red-faced, man opened the door. He had more hair on his upper lip than on his head and the moustache only served to make him look even angrier than he already did.
