“We’re cool, right?” she asked, sounding uncertain. “This doesn’t need to be weird. We can still be friends.”
They both froze. Harry’s heart sank; it’s not like he had realistically expected Draco to be happy at his intrusion, but he still felt guilty. He should have just refused to accept a program from the greeter when he originally walked into the church; scratch that, he shouldn’t have come into the church in the first place. This had all been a big mistake. It would have been less weird to loiter outside Draco’s home.
“Now we wait for it to dry,” Harry says, trying to keep his voice steady. His hands are clenched on the edge of the table, knuckles whitening with the effort to keep them there.
“Dunno. I wanted to see if it would work out. I just wanted something that was all mine for a bit, you know?”
“I swear, Malfoy, if I get consumed by an evil cloud because I’m too busy making a fucking wish, I’m coming back to haunt you.”
Teddy was now laughing too hard to reply, so Harry gently lowered him to the ground head-first, then laid the rest of his body down after. Teddy immediately rolled over and pushed himself to his feet once more. He turned his attention to Draco for the first time, who had held himself back during this whole encounter, and immediately grabbed on to Harry’s trouser leg and gave him a beseeching look.
Harry sat back, stunned. He wasn’t sure what kind of answer he had been expecting, but it wasn’t that. “Huh,” he finally said.
Harry’s flagging spirits leapt, suddenly buoyed by the prospect. “You’re on,” he said with a grin. He turned back to the papers in front of him and found his place and resumed writing. He knew he had to take care; his handwriting deteriorated rapidly when he wrote too quickly, as Draco was wont to point out.
He’s not even looking at the stool as it hits the floor once more. He’s watching the curve of Malfoy’s lip, the flush of his cheeks, and he would swear he can feel a force pulling him towards the other man. Harry has to grab on to the edge of the workbench to keep himself from approaching Malfoy, which feels like it would be a bad idea right at this moment.
Reminding himself not to look down, even though he had no idea why it felt important to do this Malfoy’s way, Harry realized that Malfoy was right—his hands were starting to compress the outer edges of the clay. He flexed them, raising his fingers away from the wheel and stretching them out one by one before lowering them back down and giving himself time to become familiar with the shape of the clay again.
triggered by Harry’s little barbs then he’s actually helping them avoid a false negative. Really, he’s doing Malfoy a favour.
“Only that I had a great-great uncle who all of a sudden went into seclusion,” Malfoy says, casually, like it’s only mildly interesting. The tension is still there, though, as prominent as ever. “He had a promising career in the Ministry, many high-level connections, everything on the up and up. And then he went and decided to become a recluse and stopped accepting visitors.” His roaming hands still, and he meets Harry’s eyes. It’s electrifying. “The obvious conclusion is that he was afflicted the same way that I am, without prior warning,” he says, and Harry finds himself nodding along. “I won’t have it!” Malfoy is all steel now, the commanding patriarch. His gaze holds Harry’s completely. “I am all that is left of my family, and I will not allow myself to be shunted aside like an embarrassment.”
“Is that so?” Harry asks. He shuts the workshop door and leans against it, crossing his arms against his chest. “Did you learn anything useful about your ‘situation,’ then?” He exaggerates the word, knowing he’s being petty about it. Malfoy’s demeanour is setting him on edge.
“Harry, please,” Malfoy says, and there’s something in his face, a rawness, that makes Harry hesitate for a moment. He hates himself for it. “I am truly sorry for the way I treated you. I shouldn’t have done that. But my magic is… broken, and I don’t know who else can help me.”
“Right, the Diagon Business Improvement Association came to us. They said there had been a string of thefts for the past few months.”
with it, but he doesn’t notice any resonances or interruptions as he maintains the charm; the wand produces a faint but steady light from its tip. That’s an unsurprising result, given its supposed allegiance, but Harry always makes sure to follow the basic diagnostic methods he learned under Ollivander’s guidance. He hands the wand back to Malfoy, who seems surprised that he’s done with it so quickly.
“You promised to tell me what’s going on,” Potter said, taking a step backwards, away from Draco’s reach. “Now’s your chance.”
Potter’s blush deepened. “When I have them, I don’t think I ever… you know.” He put his face in his hands.
“You tell me,” Harry gasps, then he hits the switch for the lathe and flings himself off of the stool, away from Malfoy’s burning touch, and over to his chisels once more. He replaces the large one on its mount before turning to face Malfoy. “I’m going to need another hair,” he says. He tries to look anywhere else in the room, but his gaze keeps being dragged back to Malfoy’s. It’s far, far too much for him to handle.
Once in a while, something about Harry’s behaviour apparently caught Draco’s attention, and Harry had to quickly busy himself with his own paperwork lest Draco realise that Harry was mooning over him. He was pretty sure he avoided detection, but there were definitely some close calls.
“Far, far too long,” he says, and then Draco’s hand is in his hair, sliding along his scalp torturously slowly. Harry can barely think; his entire existence has dwindled to the sensation of Draco’s long, slender fingers burrowing through his hair, dragging along his scalp. Harry feels Draco’s other hand against his bun, and then that same hand is undoing it and allowing Harry’s hair to cascade down his hyper-sensitive neck.
“Hello!” He was greeted by a brown-haired woman wearing a smock covered in streaks of something grey. She straightened from where she was arranging one of the final desks in the circle. “Are you here for the beginner pottery class?”
been married, back in their early twenties, but they’d also gone through a divorce only five years ago. While it wasn’t unheard of for people’s dreams to regress to earlier parts of their lives, integrating older memories, it still seemed odd.
Harry shifted uncomfortably, hearing an echo of his own thoughts while talking with Malfoy outside the studio the previous evening. “No, you’re right,” he said with a sigh. “That wasn’t fair of me.” He drained his glass. “You know, I should probably go. It’s getting late.”
Potter appeared to consider this for a moment, then nodded. “Yeah, that makes sense,” he said. “But what do we do now?”
As Malfoy accepts the wand, his eyes widen. “It did it again,” he breathes. “It was almost tingly for a moment.” He peers at the wand, as if trying to see what’s different about this one. “What did you do to it?”
Potter stilled above him on the bed. The sudden absence of motion caused Draco to groan, and he pressed their crotches together a few more times to convey his disappointment.
Just as he was trying to figure out some way to deescalate the situation, Malfoy tapped out his cigarette and stretched. “Break’s almost over,” he said. “Good chat.” He strode briskly by Harry and re-entered the studio. Harry watched him through the window as he exchanged a few words with the teacher then made his way to his wheel. He didn’t turn it on immediately, just sat there, looking at it, and for a moment Harry thought he looked very small and alone.
One of the advantages of dreams, in Draco’s opinion, was that the mind would attempt to incorporate any kind of new idea or stimulus into the dream, regardless of how unexpected or unrealistic it was. It certainly made it easier to find justifications for surprises, because when prompted appropriately the dreamer would generally go along with anything.
Draco eyed him doubtfully. “Are you sure about this, Potter?” he asked. “This isn’t exactly the optimal time for experimentation.”
“Don’t be daft,” Draco said sharply. “But think of this: even if we don’t work with the Evidence people directly very often, we still have our own records of cases where evidence was filed for them. If we find the records for those cases, we can match them against the records stored in the Evidence department and compare them. That should allow us to build up a list of shorthands that they use, and then we can use that to decode Lord Fauntleroy’s paperwork!”
“Well, never mind that,” Draco said. Deciding on a new tack, he put on a haughty air. “Come on, I won’t have you lazing about and making me do all the work for our assignment.”
“That’s fine,” Harry reassured him. “Teddy loves talking about Quidditch if you get him going, and if you run out of ideas, you can just ask him to show you his training broom.”
“Well, I don’t dislike it either,” Draco said, his cheeks reddening slightly. He busied himself looking down and arranging his papers. “Back to work!” he said abruptly. “The idle brain is the devil’s playground and all that.” He refocused on the parchment in front of him on the desk, but Harry could see a small smile appear as Draco resumed his notations.
A few moments later, a hand appeared in his field of view, steadying the owner against the pew in front of Harry.
“No,” Jenkins said. “We’ve got him in the ward up ahead. All the diagnostic tests have come up inconclusive, though. He just registers as having a really good sleep.”
He kept an eye out as they walked, vigilant for the approach of the dark cloud. He couldn’t help noticing that Potter’s dream version of the library was made of stacks that loomed over them, extending far enough to disappear into a gloom that hid any actual walls. It lent the space an eerie atmosphere, and Draco began to regret his impulsive plan to bring them there.
“Jesus Christ,” Harry mutters to himself, but he looks over his shoulder even though he should know better. Draco is standing just behind him, looking through the book on wandlore that he was reading earlier, and Harry suddenly remembers that there is actually a chapter called that and it covers exactly what he’s about to do. “Do you have to do that?” he snaps. “Isn’t it enough that you’re, you know, projecting your sexy aura all over the place?”
Draco hummed before falling silent once again, while Harry picked up the original report and stared at the word in question. If it didn’t stand for ‘buying,’ then what could it be instead? Not ‘being.’
Another breath. Draco’s still waiting for the other shoe to drop; so far this sounds like a relatively normal shift, if slightly more chaotic than usual. “There was a lot of pressure to free up beds,” Harry continues, monotone. “Something about it still felt weird, though. I pushed back and ordered some more tests. I went to see other patients again… then the girl started seizing.”
“See if I ever try to help you again,” Harry muttered, but he couldn’t help smiling when Draco laughed openly.
Malfoy casts the levitation charm once again and the stool begins to hover without any incident; Harry barely even waits before baiting Malfoy again. “You weren’t even that good, that night at the club,” he says. “It was really a forgettable experience.”
Draco was already shaking his head. “That didn’t work even when you didn’t realize it was a dream,” he said morosely.
“This is the worst,” Harry sighed. “What if we owled Robards to ask him to recall someone who could help us for half a day or something?”
This wand will do, he decides. It lacks some of the finer detailing touches he’s done in the past, but now is not the time for subtlety. He tosses the chisel carelessly to the side— it’s worthless to him now that it has accomplished its goal. He’s done with making wands; he has Draco and he needs nothing else. He stops the lathe, extracts the wand and tosses it at Draco, who catches it with his seeker’s reflexes.
“Now, my second question, Potter,” Malfoy continued. “Which Quidditch team will take the cup this year and why will it be Puddlemere United?”
Potter’s brow furrowed in concentration. “I was…” he began. “Checking my wixmail? That’s all, just reading and answering messages on my computer.”
“Good,” Ginny declared, as if that settled the matter. “Now, spill the details on Malfoy. I’m not the only one keeping secrets, clearly.” She grinned at him wolfishly.
He’d sharpened his knives earlier in the afternoon, so the blade slices through the meat with barely a hint of resistance. He makes short work of the remaining breasts, lays the knife down and washes the meat juices off of his hands with soap and water, then he pours himself a glass of red wine and sits on the kitchen stool that rests by the sink, considering the contents of the island.
Harry clears his throat. His shirt collar suddenly feels a bit tight. “Yes, I believe that,” he says drily. “And did these portraits reveal anything else of interest?”
Draco’s mind began to race. Climaxing in a dream as a way of waking Potter up certainly had potential, as far as Draco was concerned. Oh, the logistics of it might well turn out to be a nightmare, but the concept was sound. Sex had the advantage of being a prolonged activity that could potentially act as a distraction for Potter, too. Perhaps they could solve both of their problems.
“Ah, ah,” Draco said lightly. “None of that now. You’re supposed to be reading, if I remember correctly.”
Draco looked up again and found Potter looking nervously towards the encroaching dark cloud, the book hunt abandoned. “It doesn’t matter,” he said curtly. “But you really need to grab that book right now.”
It was Draco who broke eye contact first and resumed putting on his coat, and Harry let out a breath. Draco had a direct and penetrating gaze; they had deployed it to good use when questioning suspects in the past, but Harry had never truly been the subject of it before. He fiddled with his program while he waited for the crowd next to him to thin out, scanning the words in it without really taking in anything.
Harry felt the clay mould and stretch around his fingers as the wheel forced it round and round. He spread them in the shallow depression that had formed while they had been talking, feeling it slowly deepen as he pressed downwards.
Ginny took a drink, then wiped a bit of beer off her top lip. “Sounds like therapy. Are you seeing a therapist, then?”
“Ok,” Harry announces, louder than necessary. “I have some good news and some bad news for you.” He tries to concentrate on the experiment he just did and what it means, rather than what Malfoy just said. Down that path lies danger. He turns his entire body away, and it takes real effort. “But I’m going to tell you it while I look out this window, because I need to not look at you for a bit.”
Malfoy looked back at him, a small smile appearing on his face. “If you'd like,” he said, and it seemed almost bashful.
wait until the new year. Draco was very careful about keeping anything urgent off of Harry’s desk, so by process of elimination anything on Harry’s desk could not be urgent. It turned out to be a very effective system.
“Sorry, I can’t hear you over the sound of me winning the race,” Harry said nonchalantly as he turned back to his paperwork. He knew his shield charms were strong; Draco would have to work to break through. That should give him at least a bit more time to try to close the gap between them.
"I’m not going anywhere until we’re done with this ridiculous paperwork,” Draco scoffed, but Harry was pretty sure he could see the tips of his ears turning pink. “Let’s not make this unseemly.” Still, he reached out and shook Harry’s hand.
Harry was in the middle of watching a memory of the stakeout that finally led to the capture of the Diagon Alley thief when he felt a hand shake his shoulder. He seized the opportunity to return to the world outside the pensieve, and brought his face out of the swirling liquid to find Draco holding on to him.
“Not at all, not at all,” Arthur said expansively. “Harry, Teddy will be excited that you’re here. He’s off watching the Quidditch with Andromeda; you should go and say hello.”
A horrifying thought occurred to Harry, and he couldn’t stop himself from glancing quickly towards his own desk. Draco noticed, and a thundercloud passed over his partner’s face.
“Very well,” Malfoy says. He licks his lips, then casts the spell with such a pretentious flourish that Harry rolls his eyes. The stool gracefully lifts off the ground and hovers at the level of Harry’s chest. “Is that good?” Malfoy asks.
His hands were suddenly clammy as he picked up the paper from Tran’s desk. “Well, it’s like we talked about. I was working pretty hard before all this—it was pretty intense. This has been a good break. It’s helped me reset.” He focused his attention on the paper’s contents, determined to read it all.
“Very well,” Malfoy said, and to Harry’s disappointment he abruptly pushed his chair back and stood up. He walked around the side of their desks and out of Harry’s field of view. “Eyes forward, Potter,” Malfoy said from behind him when Harry attempted to crane his neck to see where he was. “You should probably look at your clay for this next part, anyways. Now, you were just about to tell me some deep and dark secret about how you came to be in the class.”
Malfoy blinked; he appeared taken aback by the question. “Merlin, no,” he said. “Don’t get me wrong—I enjoy working with the students. Against all reason, I’m even enjoying working with you—”
Potter let out a long breath. “I can’t believe you,” he said, but he opened the book anyway and began to read it. He was remarkably pliant now that Draco wasn’t trying to win a battle of wills against his dream brain. As positive reinforcement, Draco ran his hands down Potter’s chest again, stopping to cup and squeeze the man’s swelling cock through his jeans when he reached the bottom.
When he looked up again, Draco was looking into his own mug again. After a moment he raised his eyes to meet Harry’s, then thrust his mug forward and pronounced, “To family, old and new!”
“She seemed very reserved,” Draco said, before taking another pull from his mug. “I’m more worried about whether she’ll like me.”
“Cheers to that,” Harry said gratefully, raising his cup. He couldn’t help feeling slightly disappointed, though—Draco hadn’t even acknowledged Harry’s words. At least he didn’t appear to have ruined anything with his spontaneous declaration of feelings; he had never been great at thinking before speaking. The last thing he wanted to do was make things awkward between them before Draco left him forever.
Malfoy turned to look at him. “I’ve been thinking…” he began, a bit cautiously. “There’s this branch of Muggle therapy—it’s called art therapy. It might be nice to get a degree in that.”
“Well, hand me some more, and we’ll see if I can finish those as well before you’re done,” Draco said, smirking.
“I just…” Harry begins, before trailing off, sounding lost. “That only happened because I wasn't here with you. I could have left earlier. I didn’t actually
A few minutes later there’s no sign that Draco was ever in the throes of dinner prep, and he’s eating his week-and-a-half-old pad thai at the kitchen island and listening to the wireless. It’s a repeat episode of a murder drama that he remembers hearing last month, but it’s better than silence. He casts a glance at the empty harvest table that he and Harry usually sit at to eat dinner, sized just right for the two of them. He had extracted it from one of the Manor’s more intimate dining rooms, and Harry had argued at first that he didn’t want any of the Manor’s furniture when they moved in together; he’d called it ‘tainted.’
When he opened his eyes, it took Draco a moment to recognize the space that he and Potter found themselves in. He let out a long breath as he looked around; the room of hidden things in Potter’s dream was much smaller, less cluttered with junk, than when he had last been inside of it. There was much less all-consuming fire, too, which he supposed was a good thing.
would have done,” he said. “I like to think that I've moved on since then, but sometimes it’s hard to outgrow old habits.”
“There are two things,” Harry says, and he attempts to inject confidence he doesn’t quite feel into his voice. “We’ll use one of your hairs to provide the link with your magical core. Also, the wand must be crafted under your… influence. This will allow your magic to be used in harmony with your, er, other magic.”
“Potter,” Draco said, and Harry forced himself to meet his partner’s gaze. “What an unexpected surprise.”
“Just give me a second,” Harry said. He felt sweat beading on his forehead; there were too many things he was trying to focus on.
“I—” Potter panted, still continuing to use Draco’s mouth as he pleased. “I finished the book.” He was still holding on to it with one hand; the other had fisted itself in Draco’s hair at some point. His eyes looked wild—he seemed half out of control as he chased his impending orgasm. “What now, Malfoy?”
Harry gratefully abandoned his current attempt and stood up. He rolled his head between his shoulders, feeling the muscles in his neck begin to loosen as he did so. He watched Malfoy get up as well and stride out the door; before he realized what he was doing, he was following him outside.
“I don’t get it,” Harry said instead. “Why were you so carefree about working through the holiday? Didn’t you have any plans?”
Harry took an involuntary breath, but he tried to play it off nonchalantly. “Oh, well, that’s easy enough,” he mimicked. “I just needed something to keep me busy.” His fingers continued to roam over the top of the clay, sensing its motion as his palms settled on it.
Strangely, Harry found that the reminder only made him more determined to continue. It would be easy enough to stop, but he didn’t want to. He looked down at his clay—it was surprisingly well-centred, nice and wet, and ready to be pulled upwards to deepen the bowl shape. He took a breath to steady himself, then set about gently, slowly extending the rim as he spoke.
Looking at the proto-wand on the lathe, he abruptly realizes that he has forgotten to sand it down. He silently berates himself for a moment; Malfoy had made him so flustered that he had been about to rush through the next steps, and that was a very risky path. He won't allow it to happen again.
“Yes, and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,” Draco said. He held out his hand; after a moment, Teddy reached out and shook it, at first mirroring Draco’s solemn attitude but quickly getting excited about pumping their hands up and down repeatedly. Once Draco was able to disengage, he knelt down to Teddy’s level, who by this point had come out from behind Harry’s legs.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Well.” He cleared his throat. “Obviously, you should do whatever makes you happiest. I’ll be fine.” Impulsively, he stuck out his hand. “It’s been much better than I feared as well. I’d even go so far as to say it has been a pleasure.”
Draco looked at Potter, who had apparently had the time to remove his shirt while Draco was in the throes of an existential crisis about the whole thing. “Oh,” he said, feeling like a fool as he gazed at that expanse of warm brown skin. “My.” He suddenly recalled the dream from earlier, in Potter’s office, when he’d seen a similar sight. Perhaps this wasn’t a
“It was the clean up that was taking a while,” Draco murmured, and it didn’t sound like he was paying much attention to Harry any more. “Lots of witness testimony and memories to sift through in Pensieves. Evidence to compile. There were… lots of little items stolen, right?”
He hears Malfoy moving closer behind him, and Harry grabs the dogwood block and spins around, holding it in front of him like a protective charm. Malfoy’s close enough that he’s practically shoving the block into the other man’s chest. “See?” Harry asks, and it comes out slightly breathy. “I start with this block, then I use the lathe to turn it and carve a wand from it.” He’s pretty sure he’s babbling, but he desperately needs to keep his mind off of the predatory look in Malfoy’s eye.
Harry spluttered as he took a sip from his glass. “What, like, on a date?” he asked, trying to turn it into a joke. “Are you trying to get the inside scoop to sell to the Daily Prophet?”
“Oh, goodness, yes,” came a new, feminine voice. Draco spared a glance over his shoulder and saw Hermione Granger sitting next to her husband; she must have arrived while he had been inside Potter’s dream.
“Hello, everyone,” Malfoy said, carefully avoiding looking at Harry. “Just raise your hand if you're having some difficulties, and I’ll try and help you out.”
“Fuck off,” Malfoy growls, and something at the base of Harry’s spine thrills to hear him say it. It reminds him of that night they spent together, the way Malfoy had made his way over to Harry at the club. He brushes the memory aside as the stool suddenly drops almost a foot before its fall is arrested once more, and he quickly looks at Malfoy.
“Guess who I brought back with me!” Ron called as he pushed open the front door and they all stepped inside.
Draco threw up his hands. “Wonderful!” he said. “I guess it’s time to pull out my Ancient Runes textbook and see if it can provide any help here.”
Draco sniffed. “I may have been… overzealous, earlier,” he allowed, busying himself with unnecessarily straightening the piles of paper on his desk. “I hope my criticisms of bureaucracy do not needlessly complicate our work.”
He led Draco back out of the living room to the door that opened into the back garden, but he paused when they were outside the house and hidden by the garden fence. “What’s wrong?” he asked.
like you,” Draco said, but he was grinning ferociously. “Giving the appearance of caring about law and order and decency, right up until it benefits you to ignore them all.”
Potter was sitting on the sofa opposite the hearth, looking around a bit dazedly. “Malfoy?” he finally asked. “Where’d you come from? What are you doing in here?”
Malfoy adjusted where his elbows were resting on his desk, leaning forward slightly as he did so. It wasn’t much, but it closed a bit of the distance between them, and Harry had to fight the urge to match him. “How am I as a teacher?”
The method that Ollivander taught Harry for wands choosing their wizard really only applies to children; their magic is so unformed and wild that it tends to cause exciting displays during the selection process. Adults, unfortunately, require a process that is much less interesting—Harry makes them cast a familiar, comfortable spell, and if nothing happens they move on to the next wand candidate. Malfoy has the additional issue that sometimes the first cast doesn’t work, so he has to try the spell multiple times.
That had been one of their first big spats, when Draco had stood his ground, when he’d refused to excise everything in his life that had ever been touched by his family or the events of the war. Harry had eventually come around, but it had been a tense, drawn-out affair, one that had eventually resolved into their first big compromises. Draco had agreed to incorporate more Muggle activities as a gesture of good faith. They’d taken part in cooking classes together, and Harry had been absolute pants at it. It wasn’t really a surprise; cooking turned out to be a lot like potions, and Draco found it all rather satisfying. When Harry’s Healer training finished two years ago and his schedule only intensified, it simply made sense for Draco to assume all the cooking duties between them.
"Would you believe I’m here for assistance with my wand?” Malfoy replies, still refusing to meet his eyes, and Harry snorts.
Draco huffed and threw himself back into his own chair. “Ok, so we were investigating it back in...July, right?”
“Please, Harry,” Draco says from behind him, and Harry remembers the promise. Anything he wants, once the wand is finished. He starts to apply small grooves to the spinning wand, carelessly sending tiny shavings flying everywhere. He knows this work well—Ollivander was an exacting teacher, and he’s practiced this on dozens of wands on his own since his old teacher retired. Even in his distracted state, he’s confident that he’ll be able to create something as beautiful as Draco, that will serve him well for many years.
“How good are you at talking to 5 year olds?” Harry asked as they started walking towards where the game was taking place.
“It’s a simple question, really,” Malfoy continued evenly. “Does being an Auror bring you joy? Or any pleasure at all?”
“You’re right,” Harry said, feeling his face heat. “I’m sorry. You don’t actually need to tell me anything about it.”
Potter hesitated at the library’s threshold, peering in through the doorway. “Where’s Madam Pince?” he asked quietly. “I don’t see her anywhere.”
Draco huffed. “If you don’t want to say yes, then we’ll just keep brainstorming other possibilities,” he replied curtly. “It’s fine, Potter. It wouldn’t really be any use anyways unless you would actually enjoy it, or at least find it pleasurably distracting.”
Harry stared at the perfectly shaped and centred proto-bowl. He felt like a child being handed a delicate and beautiful piece of glassware, and it made him nervous. Sitting down in the chair, he started the wheel once more and resolved that this time,
“I believe if you look at the list of classes being offered this term, you will find that it disagrees with you,” Draco said smoothly. “I think it’s on that parchment to your left.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, rubbing his hand across his face. “I know you both mean well, and I know I brought this on myself somehow.” He pasted a smile on his face. “I swear I’m going to take the class seriously—I don’t want to ruin my best chance of going back to work at this point, after all!” He’d meant it to assuage their fears, but for some reason it didn’t seem to be helping.
Malfoy chuckles. “Well, how do we start?” he asks, and it comes out like a purr that Harry feels all the way to the base of his spine.
Potter closed his eyes, apparently trying to reconstruct the scene. “There were several student queries about the latest assignment… then there was the message to all the faculty about scheduling exams… and there was the leak about the upcoming Firebolt, but the details were in the attachment… oh. Bollocks.”
“Ah, if only we frequented establishments that would serve such fine cuisine,” Blaise said forlornly. “Instead we are here.”
“Mmmhmm,” Malfoy says, and Harry shivers. This is insane. He has no idea how he’s going to complete an entire wand under these conditions.
Malfoy’s hand instinctively goes to the top of his head, running his fingers through the thicker hair there as if reassuring himself. “Why?” he asks suspiciously.
“Does it matter?” Draco asked. He made a notation on the parchment he was working on, dotting a letter with a completely unnecessary flourish that lifted Harry’s mood a little. He lived for the small details these days, cooped up in this space with Draco hour after hour. He was rapidly becoming attuned to all of Draco’s moods and idiosyncrasies.
Potter flipped another page and appeared to skim it, before his whole body shuddered and he slammed the book shut. “What the fuck is this?” he asked uncertainly. “I’m not even sure I can tell you what’s on the page, but it’s doing
“Yes, well, I felt bad that I got to have my Christmas tradition last night, but you’re stuck here with me and don’t get yours. So. Happy Christmas.” Draco flashed him an apologetic smile, then turned back to his work.
A slight frown appeared on Draco’s face. “Typical eloquence from you,” he said, sitting up straighter and grabbing a new piece of parchment. “Well, are we finished prying into my personal affairs? Can we return to our endless stacks of paper yet?”
“Me and Pansy,” Ginny replied amiably. “I figured it was time to give her the full family experience. She’s holding up remarkably well so far.”
“Am I interfering with the work?” Malfoy asks mockingly, and his voice caresses something deep inside of Harry.
Somehow that appeared to assuage Potter’s concerns. He bit his lip as he watched Draco wanking him, his fingers a thin, pale blur as they moved against the dark skin of Potter’s cock. His breathing was getting more erratic, his face flushed, and Draco realized that yes, he truly wanted this. He wanted nothing more than to feel Potter come apart over him, under Draco’s control.
Harry chose a bench down the street from the front door where he could unobtrusively watch for Malfoy’s arrival. It was a standard Auror observation tactic, as was the copy of the Muggle newspaper that he raised to obscure his face from anybody else passing nearby.
Is this how Potter saw him, Draco wondered? Or at least, imagined him? Did Potter actually spend time imagining him? The idea was ridiculous, of course. It was foolish to read too deeply into dreams, which were simply the product of an overactive unconscious mind. And yet…
Harry realized he’d been staring at the paper without actually taking in any of the words. “Make beautiful bowls and cups,” he read out loud. “No experience required. So that
Potter barked a laugh. “Yes, that’s what I turn into over the school hols,” he said. “Just lying in wait to trip unwary members of the public.”
Draco smoothed down the sides of his coat. It was probably unnecessary, given how thick it was, but it made him feel better. “I knew it,” he said. “You were always a rule-breaking terror. Don’t know how the press continues to overlook it.”
,” Harry repeated under his breath. The woman sitting on his left gave him a weird look, so he wasn't being quiet enough, apparently. He tried to give her a reassuring smile, but he was pretty sure it came out a bit manic. Harry noticed Malfoy's gaze briefly dart over to him; he looked a little nervous, which Harry found surprisingly reassuring. A nervous Malfoy probably meant he was hiding something, and dealing with
Harry felt the tips of his fingers make contact with the clay once more. He was still only half-expecting it, but at least this time he kept himself still. “That’s a crap answer and you know it,” he said, but part of his attention still lay with his fingers. He moved his hands along the sides of the ball of clay, getting familiar with its dimensions and the shape of it.
When all remnants of the day’s trials have been washed down the drain, Draco replaces the soap in the dish and wraps his arms around Harry once again, placing his face against Harry’s neck. “Come on,” he says into it, quietly. “Let's go to bed.”
Draco worried at his lip. His mother said it was a bad habit, one that suggested poor self-control, but he had never been able to help himself. Potter had never joined the Aurors; maybe that had been the plan at one point, but upon leaving Hogwarts he’d continued on to secondary education with Granger and Weasley instead.
“The worst,” Draco drawled. He kept jerking him off slow, stroking the hard evidence of Potter’s arousal. He knew he
Draco accepted it and proceeded to sniff the contents guardedly, as if afraid that the drinking vessel may have ruined it somehow. When the drink appeared to pass muster, he pulled his chair forward so he was within arm’s reach of Harry and sat back, waiting. “Well?” he asked. “I believe I heard something about a toast.”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think that will help,” he said. “We need to trick your brain, somehow. Find a way to distract you so that it’s like you’re experiencing it in the dream state again.”
Tran looked at him over her hands for a long moment. “Do you have something else you would like to do instead?”
Baffled, Harry stood and let Malfoy take over his wheel. Malfoy set it spinning and looked at the clay for a moment, before slowly reaching out and grazing one finger along its edge. As Harry watched, the shape of the clay slowly refined, gradually becoming rounder the longer Malfoy continued to exert small pressures against the spinning blob.
“Wait, are we going into the restricted section?” Potter asked. He sounded excited at the prospect; Draco rolled his eyes. Typical of the man, really. He would take any opportunity to break a rule he could get. “You’re just planning to walk right in?”
Draco threw his hands up in the air. “I don’t know!” he hissed. “And I am extremely concerned that we’re supposedly prosecuting someone for this crime for which we apparently have no records!”
He was shocked out of his grumblings when he opened the office door. While he’d argue that he had spruced up the bare aesthetic of the space the previous day with his conjured additions, he had expected those to fade overnight. What he was confronted by was a whole other level of Christmas spirit—in the corner behind his desk stood a large Christmas tree whose tip just missed the ceiling, wrapped in tinsel and covered in twinkling lights. There were large decorative snowflakes hung all over his desk, and a large pine wreath with a wide, red bow adorned the back of his chair. Draco sat at his desk, for all intents and purposes working steadily on translating another piece of excellent yet inscrutable penmanship, but Harry could see him carefully watching for a reaction.
Draco snorted. “Yes, I am sure to succeed where many of the best theologians are unable to agree. I admire your confidence in me, Potter.”
Curious despite himself, Harry stood up and walked over to Draco so he could lean over the other man’s shoulder. “Do you mind?” Draco growled.
“I think cousin will do,” Draco said smoothly, and he smirked at Harry as if he could tell that he was trying to remember the difference between a second-cousin and a first cousin twice-removed.
The sound of the office door banging open caught Harry by surprise and the chair immediately overbalanced and sent him plummeting to the floor. Draco stalked by without even offering him a hand up, making his way over to his own desk on the other side of their shared space.
“You really went all out, mate,” Ron said. “You wouldn’t know any of this is here from the outside.”
Potter’s breath caught. “Are you going to—” he started, then he hissed as Draco freed his cock from its confines. “Yes,” he said breathily. “Yes, please.”
Potter blinked. “But I don’t teach Potions,” he said. He sounded uncertain, though. Draco found that communicating with dreamers often ended up becoming a test of wills.
Draco quietly removed himself from the crowd around Potter’s bed while attention was focused on the tests being performed. As he let himself out of the room, he turned back for one more look, only to find Potter gazing after him inscrutably. Draco paused for a moment, just to see if Potter would do or say anything else, then he gave the other man a professional nod and allowed the door to swing closed.
“Wherever you would go, just… picture it,” Draco said impatiently. “Think about it really hard. Like when you’re about to Apparate.”
The moment stretched out for too long. “My what?” Teddy asked, impatience beginning to overwhelm his caution around strangers.
He settled for a dismissive “Yes, of course,” as they looked around the dimly-lit restricted section of the library. There were so many aisles to choose from; they really needed some kind of guidance to know where to look.
“Gentlemen,” Robards said, sticking his head around the ajar door. “Everything on track for a clean holiday break this year?”
“My casting is inconsistent,” Malfoy says. “Sometimes it’s fine. Sometimes spells will just stop working while I’m focusing on them, or they won’t even cast at all.”
“Oh,” Harry said. “I’m glad to hear that.” He didn’t really know what to say next. After a moment, he felt Ginny’s shoulder knock against his and he looked over at her.
Harry gives this little sigh, like Draco doing laundry is just slightly too much to take on top of everything else. “Honestly, the sacrifices that I make for you,” Draco says. Harry huffs a small, breathy laugh in response, and Draco feels his heart unclench a tiny bit. He walks, dripping, out of the bathroom to the linen closet across the hall and grabs one towel to tie around his waist, and another one he makes sure is extra fluffy for Harry’s benefit. Making his way back to Harry, he envelops his husband in the warmth of the towel, receiving a soft thanks in response, before he sets about drying himself off with his own.
Harry had completed another sheet by the time he heard Draco emit a sound of surprise. He maintained his focus, rewriting yet another long-winded report concluding that no forensic traces of the thief had been found after one of the earliest burglaries.
“Correct!” Draco announced furiously. “There is no sign of the paperwork for the case that goes to trial first thing in the new year. And despite my best efforts, I have no recollection of what we did with it!”
to have faith in my methods.” He looked at Harry consideringly. “I believe it’s my turn to ask a question again.”
“I’ve just got a good feeling,” Harry had said, refusing to be drawn into an argument. “We’re on a streak. If this continues, we can wrap everything up and have a nice, relaxed Christmas for once.”
Draco dropped his head down on his desk, seemingly giving up on the parchment for the time being. “No, Potter,” he said, wearily. “I do not perform rites in the nude. I also do not swim in the Channel. The plans that I do have, however, happen to take place at night.”
“Promise you’ll take the class seriously,” Hermione jumped in quickly. “If this is part of your therapy, then it could be really important!”
Jenkins had been standing by, letting Draco take the lead, but he shook himself and stepped forward. “Yes, thank you, Healer Malfoy. Now, Mr. Potter, I’m going to start a series of diagnostic tests, if you don’t mind. We’ll start with your lower extremities. Keep your legs still, if you please?”
“He’s teaching it,” Harry said. “Or at least he’s assisting with it. Which—let me tell you—is super weird! Why is Malfoy assisting with a pottery class?”
“Shall we?” Draco asked, taking Harry’s arm in his hand. Suddenly unable to make a sound, Harry settled for a brisk nod when Draco gave him a quizzical look, and he felt the lurch of a side-along Apparition as everything went dark.
“You go for a swim in the Channel as the moon rises,” Harry said, getting into his little game now. He leaned back in his chair, carefully placing his feet on his desk without touching any of the assorted paper chaos that covered it. “Then you perform ancient druidic rites on the beach in the nude by the light of the moon.”
“We should toast your new prospects,” Harry insisted. “Besides, I’m about to go out of my skull if I have to read one more witness report praising the actions of Diagon Alley’s BIA.”
The darkness spread more rapidly the further into the room it penetrated, as if spurred on by Potter’s agitation. Draco held himself very still as it approached him, coating the floor and chair, and then what was left of the room
“Relax,” Ginny interrupted firmly. “Your secret is safe with me.” She waggled her mug at him. “I’m going to get a refill. You want some?”
“As you should,” Draco said primly. He felt a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. “The wizarding world deserves a higher class of saviour than you, honestly.”
“Giving it your full attention obviously isn’t doing the trick,” Malfoy said, sitting down at his desk opposite Harry’s. “Now, off you go. No time like the present.”
“Malfoy,” came Potter’s voice from above him, and the note of triumph from before was gone. “What the fuck is that?”
Harry regarded his partner, worrying his lower lip. “So you don’t get together with your mother or anything? Not even for a meal?”
“Indeed.” Draco smoothed down his robes absently. None of the prior tests had shown any acute magical changes taking place inside of Potter’s body, but he worried about the curse traces. “Well, all of our tests suggest that Potter is enjoying a particularly deep slumber, probably even dreaming while doing so. With your consent, I’d like to go in and wake him up.”
“Yeah, next time,” Harry mumbled. The instructor turned back to her own wheel and he hurried outside into the night, his retreating steps hastened by the sensation of Malfoy’s ever-present gaze.
Harry can’t quite get enough air. “Honestly, I have no fucking idea right now,” he says. He can’t even conceive of where the test wand ended up; he doesn’t care about it at all. He needs to get his hands on Draco. He crosses the space between them in two steps, and Draco’s eyes widen in surprise as Harry brings his palm up to cup his face.
“How generous of you,” Harry said, rolling his eyes, but he could feel himself grinning foolishly. “I suppose I have no other choice.”
“Er.” Harry stared at his clay, completely caught off guard. It went round and round on the wheel with a repetitive, hypnotizing motion. “It’s not really that kind of job, is it?” he finally asked. “So it doesn’t really matter if I enjoy it or not. Someone has to do it.”
“The service has already started, but there’s some room in the back for you,” she said, extracting one of the programs and holding it out towards him. “It’s just through there.” She motioned encouragingly with the program towards the doorway where most of the light was coming from. Harry could hear what sounded like a scripture recitation, and he reluctantly accepted the paper from the cheerful woman. “Happy Christmas!” she said. “Lovely to see a new young face around here.”
“Well,” Draco said from behind him. “I don’t know about you, but this has been a most unexpected afternoon.”
He was actually at loose ends for the first time in… a while. December 22nd and there were no fires that needed to be put out. Harry knocked on his wooden desk so as not to jinx it, but he was really looking forward to an uninterrupted winter break. He wouldn’t have believed it possible back in the summer when he and Draco were assigned one urgent case after another with very few leads and Ministry officials breathing down their necks. Still, it seemed as though the criminal element of the wizarding world were finally taking some time off. Spurred on by the elusive prospect of a holiday spent outside of the office, Harry had forced himself to stay on task with his paperwork so he could catch up and finish the year with a clean slate.
“Harry?” he tries again, and this time Harry moves his head to look at him, and Draco almost takes a step backwards. Harry’s face is naked, raw, and even though it’s hard to tell through the streams of water running down it, Draco is pretty sure he’s crying.
“In that case, shall we?” Draco asked, motioning with his head towards the exit. The crowd had thinned out; there were still some congregation members milling about and exchanging Christmas greetings, but there was now a clear path out of the church.
Harry tipped forward in his chair out of surprise. “Wait, what? Do you actually perform ancient Druidic rites for Christmas? Is this another one of those pureblood things?”
“And you staring at it is really such a big help right now,” Draco hissed back. “Pick up the fucking book, Potter. We’re not leaving here without it.”
“Potter, shove over.” Pansy’s voice came from over his shoulder. He looked behind him and saw her standing next to the booth, looking at him impatiently. He slid towards the booth wall, leaving lots of room for her next to him. Pansy was the only person who regularly called him by his last name without prefixing it with Auror, and he was abruptly reminded that Pansy and Blaise might be able to help him understand the mystery of Malfoy’s sudden reappearance in his life.
“You could have anything you wanted,” Draco says, voice full of promise, and Harry summons all his will and yanks a couple strands free at once.
“When you put it like that, I guess I do,” Harry admitted ruefully. “And she’s… treating you well? You’re happy?” He wasn’t actually sure where he was going with his line of questioning. Maybe he just wanted to see if Ginny had any regrets.
remember that they were explicitly instructed not to use the spells except in cases of emergency. However, Draco forgetting his wand
, Draco thought to himself. “It’s my number,” he snapped. “In case you ever want to get a drink with me, just as a completely random example.”
Harry couldn’t keep himself from laughing. “Just trying to add some Christmas spirit around this dreary place!” he said.
Malfoy held his gaze for another moment. “Whatever you want,” he eventually said, turning away and walking back towards the main studio space. “You’re here as my guest. Don’t trash the space, check with me before you use any of the equipment, and tell me if you're going to use any of the common supplies.”
“My aunt decided Teddy looked cold and took him inside, so I thought I’d come find you,” Draco said, which didn’t answer the question
Draco always takes Harry’s estimates around his work with a grain of salt, but he had been buoyed by Harry’s insistence. He likes to make food for Harry, and he’d planned a nice meal for that night. Harry’s Patronus, several hours after he was first called in, does not bode well, though. Draco wanders over to the fridge and pokes halfheartedly through the leftovers; he’s no longer in the mood to follow through with his original plans when Harry won’t be around to enjoy the dish. There’s some pad thai from a while ago that should probably be eaten soon or else binned, so he decants it into a bowl before grabbing his wand off the kitchen island and casting a gradual heating charm over his new dinner. While he waits for it to warm, he collects the in-progress chicken jalfrezi ingredients into some containers and attempts to find the matching lids that will allow him to store them and make another go at dinner tomorrow. The drawer they keep the lids in is a disaster; it looks like Harry’s been rifling through it again in a hurry to bring some food with him to St. Mungo’s.
“Is it because you’re a prat?” Harry asks. He’s enjoying turning the screws a little bit, out of spite.
Draco gingerly laid his pages down on Harry’s desk. “I think it may be a shorthand? I expect the Evidence people use it in their materials, but it wouldn’t usually leave their department.” He stared down at the stacks of paper, tapping one long finger against his pale lips. “There is no way we can submit any of this material for consideration in the trial,” he finally said.
“Finish,” Potter said through his fingers. “I always wake up just before I’m about to—. God, please don’t make me keep describing it. I don’t know why I even brought it up.”
Weasley boggled for a moment, and under normal circumstances Draco would have allowed himself to enjoy it a bit. The other man appeared to pull himself together quickly, however, so at least there was that.
“Allow me,” Potter said, pushing his hands out of the way as he lifted one leg over Draco, so he was sitting tantalizingly close to Draco’s crotch. Potter leaned forwards and focused on removing Draco’s shirt, causing their cocks to brush against each other through their trousers. Each time it happened, Draco felt all thoughts leave his head as his focus narrowed to that small point of tantalizing contact.
Harry sat there, stunned. “You’re— you’re leaving?” he asked. That possibility had never even crossed his mind. This conversation was not going the way he had hoped, or even feared. It was inconceivable.
“That’s worse!” Draco erupted. “That means we have to sift through months of accumulated detritus in order to find it!”
“It’s just so ridiculous, though,” Harry said. “What’s pottery got to do with showing that I’m ready to get back to work? Nothing, that’s what.” He took an annoyed sip of his beer. “I did a little bit of accidental magic and everybody overreacted, and now I’m stuck playing their games.”
,” Draco said, taken aback despite himself. He had no son in real life, of course; he had neatly avoided his parents’ attempts to pair him up with some society woman. But for Potter’s mind to conjure this for him? It could not be borne.
This isn’t the first anniversary dinner that Harry’s had to miss—in four years of marriage they’ve only had one completely uninterrupted anniversary.
Harry glanced over at his partner, who had a furrowed brow and was reading the first paper closely. He grabbed one of the Pensieve summaries and passed it to Draco, who took it without a word and subjected it to the same close scrutiny.
Harry grumbled the entire way there, but he arrived at Diaz Fine Art Studio five minutes before the beginner pottery class was scheduled to start. It was a two-story building boasting a sign covered in elegant lettering that advertised the studio’s name.  The sign was hung over a large glass window, providing a view into what Harry assumed was the main studio room. The lights inside blazed in the gathering dusk, and they illuminated a circle of desks that held what he assumed were pottery wheels. See, he knew what that was—he had read the pamphlet on the class that Healer Tran had given him. The Hermione voice in his head congratulated him on taking proactive steps towards his goals, but he quashed it grumpily. Still, he reflected as he pulled open the studio door, he’d promised to take the class seriously, and he intended to do just that.
“No,” Malfoy says tersely, still focusing on the stool. They both watch it in silence for what must be at least a minute, and there’s no change in its state. “I’m not making this up,” he finally says, sounding disgruntled.
Draco suppressed a groan. “Merlin,” he said. “You know it’s not real, and you’re devoting your full attention to it, so your brain isn’t treating it like anything other than a normal book now.”
When Harry arrived at the office on the day following Christmas, everything felt a bit off. He found that the day passed with aggravating slowness. The Christmas decorations had been removed; clearly, Draco was one of those people who believed that all Christmas spirits must be exorcised as soon as the holiday was officially past. Harry caught himself sneaking peeks at Draco throughout the morning, trying to memorise the mannerisms that would soon be gone from his life.
Andromeda and Hermione had interrupted their conversation to watch them, and they now made their way towards Harry and Draco.
“I didn’t want to leave him behind while I skived off here,” Harry said. “And Ron said that Pansy’s here, so he wouldn’t be, you know, completely stranded. And then we realised that he's never met Andromeda or Teddy…”
Harry and Draco looked at each other and silently came to the shared conclusion that their boss did not need to know anything about the current dilemma.
“What is it?” the other man asked, leaning forward to get a closer look at the changing wisps. Draco resisted the urge to pull him back away from the patient. “What did you find?”
“How can you know?” Draco asks quietly. The question hangs between them, slowly expanding to fill the little space that separates them. “That night at the club, too—what if you only feel this way when your judgement’s impaired?”
“I’m Healer Malfoy,” he said, and it felt like it came out far too calmly. “Who can tell me what happened?”
Shaking his head, he went inside and collected his belongings that sat next to his wheel. Malfoy was there, standing beside one of the other students and giving advice as something that could be a bowl took shape in front of them. Harry could feel the other man’s gaze on his back as he approached the instructor.
Fleur had been happy to talk about her history with wands; apparently her parents had commissioned a custom wand for her in order to avoid her wand core interfering with her magical core. It was this custom wand that was making Harry anxious; after Fleur described how the wand itself had to be crafted under the influence of the Veela’s pull, Hermione had noticed Harry’s expression and made him tell her everything.
There’s no other word for it—Draco squawks at the sudden pain. Harry quickly takes a step back as he feels the attraction between them dim. “Just the hair, thanks,” he says, and he turns back to his workbench, smirking a bit to himself. He hears Draco chuckle quietly, but it feels like he temporarily has the upper hand in whatever is going on between them.
Harry’s breath ghosted in front of him, fogging up the glass, and he reached up to wipe it away and get a better look. He immediately cursed as the motion drew Malfoy’s attention; the other man’s head whipped up, and they stared at each other for a moment before Malfoy reached out to turn off his wheel. He stood up, wiping his hands on a worn apron that was streaked with clay, then walked over to the studio door and unlocked it. Harry withdrew from his spot at the window and waited to enter. He supposed he had made up his mind about Malfoy’s offer after all.
Draco looked around them. Slowly, ever so slowly, he could make out the leading edges of the darkness extending their tendrils between the piles of objects that filled the room of hidden things. He swallowed.
There were only a couple of free ones left. Harry sneaked a look at the other students as he sat down on a stool; on his left was an Asian woman that Harry guessed was somewhere in her forties, while on the other side was a dark-haired man who looked about Harry’s age. In front of him was a short, small table, just large enough to hold a bowl of water and a basin that contained the wheel. Harry assumed this would help contain any messes as well.
"Right," Harry said as he nodded slowly. "Okay, I'm going to go deeper into the magic, see what I can figure out, Dobby. You watch. Pull me free if I go too deep. And if you can't, go get Draco and Ivy and Grandpa Arcturus and Amal. Not Professor McGonagall and Remus. They're too messed up."
He wouldn't stop. He wouldn't give in. This was too important. They had to stop Fake Dumbles. They had to save everyone. Draco was waiting for Harry. He wouldn't fail Draco, no matter how hard it was to drag a foot up, push it forwards, set it down and then drag the other foot up.
"Oh, Gran has this," Neville said, surprised. "She says they're obsolete but that they used to be very popular. You have to be stupidly strong and open to Magic to make them work."
"Okay," Harry said as slowly as Draco had, "if Remus was officially family, could you do more to help him? I mean, like help him with the whole werewolf thing."
Harry shook his head. "No, I don't think we should. Look. The ritual is supposed to be a secret one. Says so right at the top. It's done quietly, in hiding, with no one the wiser until it's done. The more people who know, the less likely it is that it'll work."
Draco nodded. "We will be fine. I'll deal with this and then we'll… figure the rest of it out later."
"We need a way to destroy the heart of his power for good," Draco prayed with all the strength in him.
Inside, it was warm and welcoming. The walls were whitewashed, yes, but everything tended towards lovely deep sapphire blue, ruby red, emerald green. Most of the furniture was covered with old leather that had worn as soft as silk with time. The rug in Draco's bedroom was so plush that he'd stopped and just stood there, letting his feet sink into it.
Obviously, no, it wouldn't because frankly, if you could cure lycanthropy by transfiguring someone into a teacup they would have been taught that in class. Dobby beamed at Draco and clapped his hands, stopping Draco's heart in his chest. All the adults' jaws dropped so at least it wasn't only Draco caught flat-footed.
"You can't be serious," Draco asked in a much more shocked tone. "There haven't been any soul bonds in Britain in decades."
"More than likely," Draco said smoothly as he perched on the arm of the sofa next to Harry, "Dumbledore set it up and enforced your mother's expectations because he wanted to control Harry. The Potter and Black families both have a great deal of power and could have made things quite difficult for him if he hadn't taken… steps."
"That does seem to be the solution," Mother said while rubbing her chest. "Goodness, I feel so… strange."
Draco had felt Grandfather Arcturus' agitation the instant he came through the floo. Harry had felt it a moment later through their bond. No one was ever going to get the drop of the two of them, at least not if they were sufficiently focused and aware of what was happening around them.
"Can we send Pansy after Dumbledore's bollocks?" Harry asked Draco far more seriously than he really should've.
He shuffled a little closer to Harry, hands clutched to his chest. They lay there together on the pile of rubble, just breathing as they worked to gather enough energy to get up and out of here. Draco dearly hoped that the others would make their way in here once Dumbledore was properly dead.
Draco put his bleeding hand on the ward stone. Dropped to his knees. Pressed his forehead against the stone.
The doorway in the cellar was just a little door set on the wall back behind a barrel of sugar. Harry shook his head and then braced himself.
"I know," Harry said as he stomped over and flung himself onto the bench. "I know. I just. Would wards feel this soul anchor thing? I haven't figured out how to read what Potter Keep's wards are telling me yet."
"I'm going, I'm going," Harry said with a nervous laugh that he cut off immediately because he could feel it sliding right towards tears and panic attacks that he couldn't afford right now.
"We… can help with that," Fred said slowly. He grimaced as George rubbed the back of his neck. "But we'll get in an epic amount of trouble with Mum and Dad when they find out about it."
"Ah, yes?" Remus said. He rubbed the back of his neck, a sheepish smile on his lips though it didn't reach his eyes which were glowing gold and very serious. Wolf looking out while Remus talked.
"You only call me Potter when you're mad at me," Harry complained. "I think I removed the blessing. Probably. Maybe? Not sure. We should have the adults check."
Draco got up and then cursed in a way that would've made Father proud, but which would've had Mother scolding him for being uncouth.
Those stars shifted so that they whirled into a vortex that plunged into Harry's core. Well, not plunged. It was more like the vortex of magic reached gently in to brush over his core. Gentle and soft, not hard and sharp like being punched.
That didn't make it any easier to listen to the Goblins drone their chants in Gobbledygook. He wished he'd never begged Mother to let him learn Gobbledygook. Then he wouldn't have to know that the chants were full of prayers to their gods to keep Harry from having a heart attack and dying. Or the bit about spleens exploding. Or the bit where they held their hands up while staring at the ceiling with magic swirling all around Harry and screamed for help from the Goblin gods because they were just small creatures who couldn't possibly do this by themselves.
"You're trying to free him?" Remus asked Grandpa Arcturus with so much raw painful hope in his voice and eyes and face that Harry fidgeted.
The wards laughed at that. It wasn't a sound or any words or anything but yeah, that shimmer in the magic surrounding Harry was absolutely amused. He grinned, shrugged, and then reached out to Dobby.
"Ah, yes," Remus said. He rubbed the scars on his cheek and then shook his head. "Quite so. Good point, Harry."
"Title" made a knot form in Harry's stomach. He hadn't any idea that he had some sort of title waiting for him. That was… not good. He might have to spend time around Malfoy and that would be a recipe for disaster. The two of them could barely be in the same room together without starting a fight.
"At first, yes," Grandfather Arcturus said. He laughed and shut his eyes again. His hands clenched on his thighs. "The first decade or so, yes, he used Polyjuice extensively. We found several journals full of notes of how he accomplished it without being obvious about it. But after that, it really wasn't necessary. He grew his beard, wore bright obnoxious clothes, used his warped blessing to control people's perception of him. He didn't need to… to keep Dumbledore alive after that."
And really, Harry had reason to be delighted. Potter Keep was beautiful and warm and homey but it didn't have much in the way of land around it. Cliffs and the loch and wind-swept pines, yes, but not formal gardens and a hedge maze and a Quidditch pitch. Harry pointed at the peacocks, laughing with delight at their grand white plumage.
Amal grinned. The grin faded as Fangtooth started chanting in the goblin's language Gobbledygook. A glow surrounded Lord Black, pale rose with hints of silver and green. Then it was shot through with emerald green, lemon yellow and celadon green at the same time that Fangtooth added Harry's blood. There was a deep tug at Harry's magic that he promptly encouraged, though, really, he hadn't realized that his magic had those specific colors.
"I would pray to Lady Magic for help," Mrs. Malfoy murmured as she set her nearly untouched gin and tonic on the tray and watched it disappear, "if only I knew what to ask."
"You're terrifying," Draco finally said. "Stunning and ridiculous and terrifying. How do you make these leaps?"
"First, we need to get information from Gringotts," Amal said, "and direct messages from Croaker. The phoenix—"
"We need to talk about it," Grandfather Arcturus said with a sigh. "Lock the floo down again, Harry. This is only getting more complicated."
"Okay, so, how do I tell the wards that yeah, I expect an attack, but not right now and they shouldn't be reacting to me this way at this moment?" Harry asked Draco.
Dobby sighed and shook his head so hard that his ears flapped. There were grass stains on his ridiculous yellow cabbage rose cargo pants' knees. His shirt looked as sweaty as Draco felt. And he looked so tired, so very exhausted.
The approval for the blessing, the gratitude, made Draco's core twitch along with the blessing. There was a little surge of pain as the blessing seemed determined to do even more but then it abruptly let loose. As Draco blew out a breath, the blessing unraveled entirely.
And it made Harry feel bad for all the ways he'd poked at Draco last year. Still didn't feel a tiny bit of guilt for stealing Dobby, but he probably shouldn't have been such a prat to Draco. Even if he'd been a massive prat first. Several times.
Harry sucked in a breath and let it out so slow that it hissed between his teeth like a snake. There wasn't anything for Harry to do but feed power to Draco so that Draco could lock Malfoy Manor's wards down entirely.
Moody frowned. They'd separated Draco from Mother about half an hour after they arrived. The entire investigation had been nothing but questions and doubt and Draco attempting to hold his temper. Between his hunger and exhaustion, Mother's pain, and the lingering aura of those horrible dark artifacts in Father's office, Draco wasn't sure just how much longer he could handle this.
"Um, he kind of had a crossed-out bit that mentions um, a… torrid affair," Harry said, stumbling over actually getting the words out his mouth.
While Father and his other grandfather had never been religious at all, the vast majority of the Malfoy family had been devout followers of Lady Magic going back to the founding of the family. Draco, personally, had always found the little rituals they kept in Slytherin to be comforting in the extreme.
Either way, Harry poked the Potter wards and triggered them to war status before putting his face in the crook of Draco's neck. They were at war. That's what those wards were for. Tomorrow, or probably later today once Dumbledore figured out that he'd been tricked, Harry would have to do what Draco had.
"Can carry them but you can set up the floo to allow messages to specific parties," Amal continued as if he hadn't been interrupted.
Dumbledore, Gellert Grindelwald, was dead. Together, Harry and Draco had succeeded in stopping the most powerful Dark Wizard the world had ever known.
Fangtooth waved his hand and Arcturus took a deep breath as if he'd been held down so tightly that he could barely breathe. To Harry's surprise, Fangtooth stepped back and let Arcturus sit up without assistance. Harry pulled free from Amal and ran over to help Arcturus.
Summer's heat had long since turned the grass brown around the Keep but there were wind-twisted pines and a swathe of ivy that clambered up the shortest square tower as if it intended to envelope the entire Keep. Below the cliff, the loch gleamed in every shade of blue as the morning sun turned its rippling surface into diamonds.
"And on top of that he's layered a bunch of charms and potions and stuff that manipulates people into being just what he wants," Harry said with a nod towards Remus. "The strongest and most frequent ones applied to Remus because he shrugs them off as a part-werewolf, the least on Draco and me because we're kids and just had one year of being around him."
But his whole body shook. A fine tremor that made Draco's stomach clench in worry. Harry's hand tightened on Draco's. They'd still been down in the ward room when Grandfather Arcturus returned. Or, more accurately, Draco had been in the ward room. Harry had been outside of it, asking chirpy questions about the rune circles on the wall and pestering Draco to ask the ward stone all manner of odd questions about the Malfoy magic and history and what it thought of the whole soulbond thing between them.
Draco licked his lips and decided to let that one go for now. He could feel Harry's curiosity about what Peter / Scabbers meant to Remus, about what could make Remus lose control in such a dramatic fashion, but they did have a bigger problem to deal with.
Hedwig flew down to land on Harry's shoulder. She cooed and groomed his hair, loving on him as if she was as desperate for their time together as Harry had been.
They sighed in unison, turning back to their food. Both of them were hungry. And thirsty. Draco was far too tired given that he hadn't been part of the ritual. Harry was quite justifiably exhausted.
And then they hit the wards and Harry nearly did crash into the walls as the wards clawed at him, trying to keep him out.
Or right. Something was clearly going right. Draco had only the barest sense of what Harry was doing through their bond. There was so much wild magic surging through the wards that Draco simply couldn't keep track of what Harry did.
"Ivy is not expecting it," Ivy said. "Master Draco will fuss and fume and pace and be very cranky in the morning. Ivy will bring the strongest tea. Master Draco will drink it and be jittery and very cranky. Master Draco and Master Harry will have a screaming fight. Then will be ceremony time and will all be over."
Ivy stopped patting first. Then Dobby. Finally, Cooper pulled Harry's head down by his ears so that Cooper could stare into Harry's eyes for a long, unblinking while. He heard people come in behind him but trusted that Dobby would protect him, and that Draco would say something if Harry needed to pull free.
It was four towers, three round, one squarish, tied together by a training yard surrounded by a high stone wall. Potter Keep stood on a cliff overlooking a loch, Draco didn't know which, with the sea just off in the distance. The hills around it were covered with brilliantly green scrubby pines sculpted by the wind and grass that had gone brown in the summer's heat.
The family magic filled Draco until his hair stood on end. Until his breath came in pants and huffs that sent bolts of blue shooting across the ward stone room. He could feel Ivy pressing against his thigh. Blue and Vern and Yule were kneeling on Mother's bed, keeping her safe as the family magic flooded the Manor.
"Definitely," Grandpa Arcturus said. "I've some familiarity with other traditions and it doesn't match any of them."
"Oh, you'll live, Lord Black," Fangtooth said with a snort. He waved one hand and diagnostic spells like the ones Madame Pomfrey used flashed into place above him. "You've a great deal of healing yet to do, but you'll live thanks to Mr. Potter. The Potter magic is what saved you."
Remus shuddered and turned away. He wrapped his arms around his waist, hugging himself the way Harry used to when he was locked in his cupboard and hadn't been allowed to eat for a couple of days. Which, wow, that was not good.
But there was no sign of Dumbledore so they didn't have much of a choice but to sneak down into the library that must have been put in place by the Founders. Harry didn't look at the books. No time, no interest, too afraid of what would happen when Dumbledore realized that they were there.
They all paused in the hallway leading up to the floo room as the Manor shook so hard that the paintings rattled on the walls, startling the occupants into screaming. Dust drifted down from the ceiling as the peacocks outside screamed in terror.
They had to find a way to free everyone Dumbledore had "blessed". And then they had to find a way to stop him from ever controlling anyone ever again. No way was Harry giving up, not when they'd finally made some progress.
That was a huge relief. Harry blew out a breath, turning back to Fangtooth and the healing. Still lots of chanting and lots of magic that looked like Harry's swirling around but no progress that he could see. Or feel. Yet.
Remus swallowed and rubbed the back of his neck. "I… don't think I could go. I feel. I need. This is so odd. I need to be here, near you. It's…"
"Ivy's bond to me is very robust," Draco said. He laughed softly as Ivy popped in and bounced at his side. "She'll be fine. Honestly, I could take all of them, but I'd hate to take Vern away from the gardens."
"We didn't… do that," Draco said as he sipped the milk more because he didn't want to disappoint Ivy than because he wanted it.
Draco stared at him; lips pressed together. "Wards? They landed on me like a ton of bricks when Father died. Not to mention that Mother flatly insisted that my suite be on the absolute other end of the family wing from Father and Mother's suites. Distance did nothing to stop her screams from carrying down the hallway."
He leaned forward and put his empty glass of whiskey on the tray Dobby had left behind. It disappeared instantly. Remus did the same with his empty bottle of orange soda, nodding thoughtfully.
"Well, what are ye waiting for?" Professor McGonagall demanded. "Open up another of these cells and put me in it. I'll not allow anyone to control me, not now that I know. Ye cannae let me go and ye cannae trust me to run free. In the morning, the goblins can work on me just as much as poor Remus."
"Magical children learn how to write with quills when they're tiny," Draco said. "As for why Muggleborns and Muggle-raised kids don't learn, well. I think you know the answer."
Harry wasn't sure what to make of that. He hadn't been sure when Silverclaw show it to him the first time. Seeing it today, full of goblins and Silverclaw and Grandpa Arcturus and Mrs. Malfoy all working together to purify and ready it, Harry still wasn't sure.
"Dumbledore had it," Harry said. "He wanted me to sneak around Hogwarts so that I found the Mirror of Erised. Which, you know, I did. That was, well, not good. It shows you your greatest dream which was to have my family around me. Fake Dumbles said that he saw getting a nice pair of socks when he looked in it."
"You've got the labyrinth," Harry agreed. He looked to the door of the ballroom and frowned. "Did Remus and Professor McGonagall get these books cataloged yet?"
Harry's prayer echoed in the wild magic surging around them at the same time that Draco's did. Their hearts sang the same song of love and freedom, redemption, and release. When Draco tilted his head back to stare up into the emerald and sapphire sky overhead, Harry did the same. While Draco knelt, Harry stood, arms outstretched in a plea so open that awe filled Draco.
"I can't see it as anything else," Harry said with a sigh. He sipped his tea and added a little more milk, only another couple of teaspoons though. "Dumbledore put me there. He's apparently my magical guardian. You said that there're ways to track how kids are doing. He must have them. Or he deliberately chose not to use them for some reason for me."
Harry bit his lip, staring at the very, very unimpressive Weasley tent. It was a pathetically small thing, plain white canvas that showed its age with raveling edges and stains along the grass line. At best, optimistically, it could hold two small children. Even Aunt Petunia would've hesitated to shove Harry into it. It was just that small and pathetic and ancient-looking.
No, it was because Lord Black's face twisted as the magic grew brighter around him. Even unconscious, it was hurting him. His hair had been black at one point but now he'd gone silver at the temples. His beard was longer, ragged and streaked with silver from the corners of his mouth nearly to the tip of the beard. There were wrinkles like craters around his eyes and the one between his brows said so much about pain, pain that went on and on and on and on.
Dobby's frown shifted from disapproving to confused for a moment. Then he clambered up on the bed, patting the air around Draco's body. After a few seconds, Dobby nodded. A few seconds more and Dobby grinned and bounced on the bed just like he always did whenever Father wasn't around for a few days or weeks.
Professor McGonagall scowled. Remus groaned and finally looked around the corner. He looked so incredibly tired that Draco just sighed and walked down the stairs to pass the letter to him. Harry saw the moment that Remus got to that crossed out bit, too. The first crossed out bit made Remus moan very quietly. The second bit made him splutter and blush.
"Oh, no," Draco said. "Turn the vehemence down a touch, yes. It's rather like having Dobby yell in my ear constantly."
"No," Draco said. "He did not. Pansy is a brilliant young woman with a huge well of magic. I'm sure that she'll make a very advantageous match. I would ah, how shall I put this? Well. I'll be blunt. Pansy's already learned the castration hex, sir. I recommend that you ask her about her preferences and pay close attention to her responses. The older girls made sure that every girl in Slytherin learned the hex within three hours of arrival at Hogwarts."
So having a place that could be used to save Harry from Voldemort tainting his mind and his magic was good.
Harry didn't take Remus' hand. He took Draco's hand, which was good. Draco was tired enough that he nearly fell down the stairs halfway down into the dungeon. Grandfather followed them. So did Mother. Amal and Professor McGonagall stayed in the parlor, both of them looking too tired to even get up.
Shockingly informal, but not dead. Draco shook his head and went to find Mother out in the conservatory. He could remember her spending time there when he was a tiny child, not yet out of a baby's dresses. She hadn't spent any time in the conservatory since Draco was turned over to Father for his training.
"…No." Draco frowned, trying to remember where they'd come from. "No, I don't think that they did. No one has seen these yet."
Draco nodded. "And perhaps a look out a window as we pass. Just to be sure we're not doing this on our own. We really need the aurors and everyone fighting Dumbledore to get down to the ward room safely."
The real question was how strong Mother's marriage bond to Father was after everything she'd been through. If it was too strong, this was going to hurt her along with Father. There was little that Draco could do about that.
He leaned his forehead against the blond wood door, shaking. Father served that monster willingly. He had always served willingly. Maybe if Father had truly wanted the Dark Mark removed, Mother would have succeeded.
Deeply entrenched, those blessings resisted everything Draco pushed at them. He bit his lip and prayed again, wordlessly begging Lady Magic to help. To save them. To free them. To let the world be free and whole and happy.
Harry grinned, petting the blue phoenix's chest. "I guess they think I need the help, just like you do."
"No, you can't," Draco said immediately. "The Weasley family are all huge Dumbledore supporters. They'd do exactly what he wants and not question it all, even if you swore up and down that you were in danger from their actions. Hermione? I don't know. Would she listen to you long enough for you to explain what's going on? Because my impression of her is that she makes up her mind and then won't budge."
"No, the boy is best for this," Silverclaw said. "Their bond is… profound. Chosen as well as Destined soul bonds have deep effects on one another."
"I begin to see why you have not been to see me, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "This will need a great deal of effort to repair. Where did you wish to begin?"
Harry's joy surged through the bond, capturing Draco's attention. It pulled his mind away from Fake Dumbledore and back to the waves of magic radiating out from Malfoy Manor's labyrinth.
Harry stared at Grandfather Arcturus, turned to Draco who shrugged because what did Draco have to do with Harry's wards? Harry snorted and then locked the floo down with an authoritative snap that echoed through the room. And perhaps through the entire castle. When Harry strode off, Draco followed. The adults trailed after them.
"That… makes sense, actually," Harry said finally. "Um, is Voldemort going to come after you and your mom? I'm pretty sure we can get you somewhere safe."
The entrance to the kitchen was less than a dozen feet from the secret passageway down into the ward room, much to Draco's relief. He tickled the pear and then they slipped into the kitchen together. He'd been to the kitchen a couple of times last year, mostly for nights when Pansy decided that they had to study in their common room. If Pansy was going to study somewhere private, she required treats and she was never, ever the one who went to get them.
A wave of reassurance came from Draco, washing over Harry like someone had just pulled a blanket up over him and tucked him in. It was so strange, so unlike anything he'd ever had until the last few days that Harry turned and stared at Draco who got those spots of color high on his cheeks again.
"How are they doing?" Harry asked with a nod towards Remus and Professor McGonagall. The bond made it utterly clear that he wasn't ever going to bring the subject of Draco's almost-betrothal to Pansy up again.
"Probably not," Draco said. He flickered a glance over at Harry, then went back to staring at the ritual room. "I was… instantly aware of the damned anchor at Malfoy Manor. It was one of the first things the wards screamed at me. I couldn't avoid being aware of it. It was honestly rather like having Dobby yelling in my ear and pulling at my sleeve for hours on end."
Draco made his way down to the wardroom, not surprised that Ivy popped in when he approached the ward stone. No sign of blood remained. Ivy smiled and nodded once, firmly, when Draco patted her shoulder in thanks.
The magic of the ward stone pushed Harry's hand towards the knapped knife-edge of the stone. He blinked, starting as he realized that wow, yeah, that thing actually was razor sharp. He'd had no idea stone knives could be that sharp but then obsidian was basically glass.
"Do you trust Professor McGonagall not to turn you back into Dumbledore?" Draco asked. "She's not at Hogwarts right now. I believe she has a home in Hogsmead. If anyone would be able to handle this transfiguration, she would."
"You tried," Harry said. "It's not your fault you're up against people stronger than you. So am I. I mean, I can't fight Uncle Vernon. He locked my wand in the cupboard with all my books and my trunk and broom and everything, so I'm helpless. We're just stuck in the middle. It's okay, Dobby. At least I know I'll have to face something dangerous again. It's the best you can do."
Behind Dobby, Mother pursed her lips and shook her head sadly. Grandfather Arcturus looked dismayed, exhausted, and frustrated all at once. On the other hand, Amal had his head tipped to the side as he frowned at Dobby.
They spun off through the floo. For the first time ever, it wasn't dizzying. Harry could feel the twist of the magic as it spun them around and whipped them off to the fireplace in Potter Keep. Better still, he could feel Draco's magic through the bond.
Thankfully, despite the questions echoing through the bond, Harry didn't protest after that. They ran to the ballroom, told Professor McGonagall, Mother and Amal, and then watched as they all ran from the ballroom together. Professor McGonagall's cursing echoed despite the shut door. Draco sighed, looking at Mother's notes. None of them made sense to him.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, I don't think so either. But my point is, Quirrell was possessed by Voldemort all last year. The troll? That was Quirrell. And now I've got a soul anchor in my scar? Wouldn't the wards at Hogwarts have told him about that? Supposedly there's wards on my aunt and uncle's place. Dumbledore said he put them there, building on the protection my mother gave me when she died. Shouldn't he have felt the soul anchor then? Or at least the abuse I got? I'm not so sure that "everything bad in my life" isn't exactly what Dumbledore is going for."
"I… right," Draco said while rubbing his blazing-hot cheeks. "Thank you, Ivy. We'll leave that alone. And be very cautious about any other books we find secreted away. Though if we've got any books hidden away about blessings and ancient religion and prayers, do please pull them out."
And they were. Slipping out of their suite was easy. Going down the stairs was scary as anything because all the grownups were still up and around. Remus was in the ballroom. Mrs. Malfoy nearly walked into them as they went down the grand staircase. She had stacks of books in her arms and Blue at her side with even more books.
Rich and delicious, not overpowered with either onion or garlic. The peppers added a bit of bite that worked wonderful with the sweetness of the onion and the pungency of the garlic. The sausage filled out the hash and the potatoes bound it all together into something gloriously unlike anything Draco had ever eaten before.
It didn't hurt. If anything, Draco's magic surged to meet Tippy's, singing with excitement that came through Harry who was echoing the same sensation through their bond.
"We'll go get Mother and Amal," Draco said. "I assume Remus will return when he's regained control of his temper?"
It was small, ridiculously so for a place that was renowned for being one of the best and most secure magical castles in the world. Where Malfoy Manor was huge with three wings and four stories, Potter Keep had ten bedrooms. Total.
"We are being blocked by several forces within the Ministry," Silverclaw said. "At present, our team working on the issue does not believe that they can get him out anytime soon."
As he took those last few steps into the heart of the golden light, the bond to Draco flared alive after being silent since they parted on the stairs. Draco's faith was there, pulsing in the bond. His hope, his belief, his trust of Harry was right.
He caught Draco's hand, sucking in a breath when the contact abruptly calmed his racing heart. Draco's eyes went wide as he sagged a little, fingers so tight around Harry's hand that it hurt. Okay, so yeah, the wards were absolutely doing something to them. Dumbledore might be aware of them.
Draco nodded. "Get rid of my blood. And get me to my bedroom. This… people will have noticed. And make sure that Mother knows that the wards have locked down several… very dark artifacts."
Now, Harry was sitting cross legged on the floor in the sitting room next to one of the antique credenzas. Not the sleek and lovely half-circle maple one with the marble top but the hand-carved Spanish oak one that looked like it had been created in the fifteenth century despite Father having said it was made in the early nineteen hundreds.
Another long moment passed before the blessing abruptly unraveled under Harry's persistent, gentle encouragement. He breathed in stars, breathed out a vortex of sad, confused blessing, and smiled as the wards slowly eased him back to his body.
When Harry touched the display, it shivered and then became English. Not one of the warnings was for Harry and his scar which made him stare. Draco nodded before pointing at the warnings near the main doors, the castle gates and at the floo.
"I'll be back soon," Draco promised. "Keep everything safe for me, please. Hopefully soon I'll be able to introduce you to my soulmate. He's a dreadful mess but then he's a Potter, so what else could he be?"
"I kinda want to know if it might be something that Dumbledore would notice," Harry said. "Not a ritual. I'm sure that'd be obvious to him. The blessings letting go, though, that's what I wonder if he's aware of. Could feel? I don't know. I mean, I just don't want him to arrive and try to batter his way through the wards or something."
Draco stared, mouth open, and then shook his head. He tentatively put his hand out, hovering over Harry's for a long moment before Harry nodded that yes, it was okay to touch. Hopefully. Harry really wasn't sure what would happen.
True. She would. Draco still had to struggle to kick the stupid slippers off. He latched onto Harry's wrist, keeping him from pacing around the room. It took a good bit of mumbling and tugging but eventually Harry gave in and curled up in the bed with Draco.
"It's what he did," Harry said with a jerky, furious gesture towards the door out of the library. "Dumbledore sent Remus here to die. To be killed. By us. To test us all. And no. Just no. I won't play his game. Remus deserves to live no matter what's going on. So we have the elves contact Professor McGonagall to see if she'll come rescue Remus."
"Master Harry is all right!" Dobby exclaimed. "Dobby was worried. Master Harry went far too deep for a…"
"Ah, well…" Remus winced as Harry glowered at him. "This. How can I believe that? You don't understand, Harry. The Wolf is so angry at the blessing. Half of me is snarling at it. The other half is terrified that I'll be no better than Fenrir Greyback once the blessing's influence is gone. I can't…"
The healer finally shoved his way past the Unspeakables, glaring at Croaker as he passed. Draco told him what to look for even though Mother tried to hush Draco and then sat blushing furiously as Draco ignored her and told the Healer just what he was looking at.
"Lady Magic," Harry said as the prayer required, "grant us aid that we might save our friends, our allies and even our enemy's forces from, from the warped blessing nestled in their cores."
Mr. Swashlin was about forty, maybe fifty years old. He had dark brown skin and curly black hair that was a lot like Harry's. His chin was covered with stubble. His smile was so bright and welcoming that Harry settled into the comfortable armchair in front of Mr. Swashlin's desk without apologizing for taking his time.
"Is Black Manor safe?" Harry asked Amal without looking his way. "I mean, safe for him to go back to."
"Right," Draco said. "Remus, Amal, go! No arguing, you idiots! I'm the one holding the wards up. The sooner you're gone, the better."
He slipped out of the library and left them to their research. It wasn't the real reason that they'd left Potter Keep, of course. Grandfather needed to put pressure on the DMLE to get Sirius free. Mother intended to help in Draco's name. Getting some research done before their morning meeting was simply wise. There were books here that didn't exist in Potter Keep or anywhere else, hopefully. It was quite possible that Father had destroyed the books in a fit after the Dark Lord punished him for not being sufficiently devoted.
Harry nodded and then sighed gustily. "Fine, but it's a short explanation, right? Because I want to sleep."
Why did his hands ache? Had Father…? No. No, Father was dead. Draco had killed him to free himself and Mother.
"Mistress' elf Blue can ease her sleep," Ivy suggested. "Blue does so many, many times. Will keep Mistress asleep."
They pressed their hands against the wards, reaching with the strange, shifting magic of the house elf out to Ivy who nodded and nodded and nodded.
"Tonight," Draco agreed, seeing blue highlights skittering over Harry's warm brown skin from the magic in Draco's eyes. "Let's go out into the garden, duck around to the stairwell at the end of the wing. We should be able to avoid everyone that way."
"Dumbledore made my parents hide," Harry said, ticking things off on his fingers. "Dumbledore is Voldemort's greatest enemy, the one person he fears, but he's never tracked him down and stopped him. Dumbledore was Supreme Mugwump, right? Chief Warlock, too. He could've gone after Voldemort with all the power of the Ministry and the ICW behind him."
He drank it without blowing the flame out and then blew several smoke rings while glaring at the ceiling far overhead.
"Master needs Dobby?" Dobby asked. He blinked and then wiggled happily. "Wards is nice, Master! Dobby likes them. They is much better than Malfoy wards. Ivy said that the Malfoy wards is better now, but these is better than them by far."
Draco smiled. They'd left the door between their connecting suites open. Mostly at Draco's request but Harry had seemed pleased to do it. He wasn't sure if that was because Harry wanted to spend more time with him or if it was because this was a new place and Harry found it comforting to have access to Draco.
"A curse," Draco breathed as his eyes went wide. "Oh, damn that man! He could curse a werewolf, and no one would look sideways at him. Harry, check the wards. Specifically, have them look for curses that would bind a werewolf in unstoppable ways."
"I'm not joking when I say that the wards are screaming, Mother," Draco said. He grimaced at the second round of diagnostics Healer Smethwyck directed at him. "They are quite literally telling me every single thing Father did to you, every injury you've ever had and all the curse damage you're laboring under. As well as moment by moment notices about your general and specific pain levels."
"You should've had an intro class that told you all about family magic," Amal said slowly while his frown went from confused to thunderous to about to make angry goose noises again.
So many warped blessings. So many bits of magic desperately working to do the right thing even though it was impossible.
Harry snapped his mouth shut, the bond going worried and fearful as Harry's eyes locked on his plate where he pushed around his eggs instead of eating them.
They couldn't reach out to each other, not with broken hands, but that didn't matter. The soulbond pulsed between them, strong and bright and beautiful with all the colors of magic. There were a million things that needed to be dealt with. Healing and cleaning up Dumbledore's messes. Unlocking Malfoy Manor. Making sure everyone was freed from the warped blessing, all across the globe.
Harry frowned, well aware that Remus had gone stiff and wary again. Another set of behavioral spells, maybe? Or something else. Oh well, it didn't matter. He looked to Draco who shrugged before turning to Mrs. Malfoy.
Draco nodded. "I… don't know if our bonds to the elves might function well enough. I suspect not. We've had to be very specific asking the elves things. Dobby might have the independence and force of will to be able to tell Harry if there was something influencing the bond, but I don't know that Ivy and the other Malfoy elves would even think to mention it to me. It's not part of their training."
As Harry flailed and tried to escape from Mrs. Malfoy's very determined cooing and hugging and petting his hair, Remus stood up and started pacing in the floo room. This time the growling didn't seem like a threat at all. The wards stopped poking Harry about Remus entirely.
Draco didn't need to say it for Harry to realize the next moment that there was only one person who would try this. Silverclaw had access. None of the other goblins would try it. Amal was here. So were Mrs. Malfoy and Grandpa Arcturus.
Harry coaxed the blessing free from his core in just the same way he'd coaxed the baby snake to go hide in the grass under Aunt Petunia's huge old rosebush, the one with the inch-long thorns that would scratch anyone up if they got too close.
There were exactly three people in Hogwarts: Harry, Draco and Dumbledore sitting in his office doing who knew what. Even the map called him Dumbledore, so Harry didn't feel at all bad about continuing to do so. He licked his lips and did the second check that Remus had taught them, the one that said where the elves were.
They were a spear bringing the light of hope into the darkness. They were twined souls working to save the world. They prayed, together, silently, lips moving and feet pacing as one towards the monstrosity that Dumbledore had created underneath Hogwarts.
"Mmm, about four or five minutes," Harry said. "And yeah, I didn't do a thing. That was all Draco. Just like I was the one that freed myself. That might be a key."
"Good choice," Draco agreed. "I believe we're just under the threshold that Father put on the contract, sir. That said, I wouldn't object to adding to Pansy's dowry. Perhaps an emerald and yellow topaz tiara? With a matching bracelet?"
Their class had gotten a trip into London when Harry was eight. They'd been taken to the Guildhall Yard and shown around the looming historic buildings. His teacher had been as impressed as Harry, telling them all about the incredibly powerful people who lived and worked in the area. He'd all but said that there was not a hope in hell of Harry ever being worthy of so much as breathing the air here.
"Wrong about what?" Hermione asked with no small amount of panic. "The Event? No one knows what caused it or why it changed people's personalities or anything."
Mr. Parkinson's jaw dropped open just a hair which was a huge response for a man like him. "He didn't ask."
"Mr. Potter," Mr. Swashlin said as he set the tea aside without even sipping it. "I am at your disposal. Let me set up a few things and then I'll have you tell me everything. Absolutely everything. Whatever you can tell me will help us make sure that Dumbledore never touches you again."
Harry nodded. He grabbed Grandpa Arcturus for a bear hug that made him wheeze, then looked over at Amal who was a little bit pale but who grinned encouragingly at Harry while holding two thumbs up. Mrs. Malfoy smiled gently at Harry. She had her hands clasped in front of her chest like she was praying.
Seriously, Harry needed to figure out a way to get all of Dumbledore's power taken away from him. He'd done so many terrible things to so much of Magical society. Once the letter was done and dry, Harry put it in an envelope and then slipped off the couch to go over to Silverclaw who'd retreated back to the fireplace with his notes.
There had to be some way to feel it, right? Some way to sense Harry who had to be fretting himself to pieces, too. Unless, of course, Harry had dropped right off after he went to bed.
"He's Grindelwald," Draco said. When Hermione turned to him, eyes uncomprehending. "He kept Dumbledore alive for about a decade, to use his hair in Polyjuice. After that, he'd been established for long enough that he felt secure in killing Dumbledore. The man you knew last year at school, that we knew, wasn't Dumbledore. It was Grindelwald pretending to be Dumbledore while casting control spells on everyone and putting potions in our food to keep us from disobeying him."
She giggled as he ran back down the stairs to the kitchen. And then to the library because the grownups had left the kitchen by the time he was done tucking Draco in. They already had a zillion books laid out and Mrs. Malfoy was pulling even more of them down when Harry came in.
"No, I'm Harry," Harry said. "But we'll get Sirius back. I mean, once you're stronger. Amal has news about him. It's bad news, but, you know, it's news. There is good news though."
Father had done something to ensure that Draco wouldn't notice the potential bond. Actual bond? From the way Ivy talked about it, Harry and Draco were already soul bonded. They just hadn't noticed it.
George said, laughter echoing even though there were no bodies, no voices, no eyes, nothing but the gentle white supporting the four of them.
Two sides of the same thing. Wild and harsh, like a shifting, rag-clothed wolf hunting his prey, tearing its throat out, like blood spilling onto the grass while the wolf howled his fury at the clouds rumbling overhead.
She looked down at the dirt smudges, green streaks across her skirt and sleeves and then raised an eyebrow at him. Her hair was dark again, fully dark instead of partially spelled blond to suit Father's idiotic insistence that everyone wearing the Malfoy name had to have blond hair.
"Tell me everything, Lord Malfoy," Silverclaw said as he scribbled a note on a scrap of paper and dropped it into his message box. It flashed away. "Spare no details."
"Fine, I'll sleep," Draco complained as he flopped back on the pillows and crossed his arms over his chest.
"Ivy," Draco said to Ivy who popped in to properly bow to Draco even though she was outside the flames and thus not visible to Mr. Parkinson, "please help me choose a proper apology gift for Pansy and her mother. Something that will keep me from getting hexed."
Harry's worry and exhaustion were right there with Draco at the end of the tunnel. It was hard to believe that it was done.
"The reason is named Dumbledore," Harry agreed. "Seriously, Ron. He's my soulmate. I will drop you like a hot potato if you keep this up."
Enough that Draco was sure it would be inedible. Harry was full of anticipation for the hash. His hunger for it had Draco craving it even though he'd never been one for that much garlic. Or any garlic, really.
Harry nodded but didn't say anything. They ate their breakfast. Drank more tea. Wandered out of the kitchen and then through Potter Keep. Mr. Swashlin left them to their own resources, marching off to help Grandfather Arcturus and Mother sort through what needed to happen to purge the control curses from both Remus and Professor McGonagall.
"He lied," Harry said, shutting his eyes and gritting his teeth against the need to go punch Dumbledore in the nose. "He lied and made me a target. Damn it. Right. Okay. I knew I couldn't trust him. It's fine. I'm fine. Okay, so, what progress have you made? And why hasn't anyone come to wake me up?"
Draco stared at him. Hermione stared, too, mouth dropped open as she made incoherent little noises. At least she'd stopped with the chattering teeth and her hands had begun to warm up. That was good. Kind of horrid that she'd been so frightened by that betrothal contract that she'd more or less gone into shock.
"Ivy." Draco held his breath and then blew it out a moment later when Ivy, his personal elf, appeared in front of him.
"Mistress Kitty will be free?" Lilac breathed, tears welling up as she clasped her hands against her chest. "Lilac is so happy! She will bring Mistress Kitty's favorite night things and a hot toddy. Mistress Kitty will rest and be better in the morning. Promise now!"
Five minutes passed. Then ten. Twenty. As the clock struck the half hour and Professor McGonagall started pacing and cursing under her breath, a shiver of lavender and puce magic cascaded up and out of Amal. It dissipated like mist torn to shreds by a strong gale, then Amal's magic swept over the room in a surge that was warm and soft and laughing.
"No, sir," Dobby said so sadly as he shook his head and his ears drooped even further. "Will be worse. Much worse. The Master said so. The Mistress tried to stop him, but she could not. Master hurt her until she gave up. And the little Master…"
She ran over and tackled Harry with a hug that almost knocked him flat on his back. Harry staggered, holding Hermione who shook so hard that it felt like she was either freezing to death or going to lose her teeth from them chattering so hard. Draco put a hand in the center of Harry's back, making sure he didn't end up on the floor.
Harry looked around the dingy little room. The only things he cared about were Hedwig and his trunk. Everything else in the bleak room was just there. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon hadn't allowed him very much stuff. They'd begrudged him the most basic things, honestly. So he didn't have very many things to pack.
Both Grandpa Arcturus and Mrs. Malfoy had moved off to the end of the hallway to talk in whispers about what to do when, not if, Remus failed to escape Dumbledore's control. Rude. He could still do it. Maybe. If he stopped running in circles like a puppy chasing its tail.
The contrast between the weight of the cloak and the near nothingness of seeing through it, made Harry's stomach lurch a little.
Harry tilted his head to the side, fingers clenched on the gracefully carved railing so hard that he vaguely worried about breaking it.
They'd asked for what they needed which might not be Dumbledore himself. Draco could only hope that it wouldn't be the horrible old man. He'd rather break a prayer circle or something than fight a grown man who'd caused thousands upon thousands of deaths all across the magical world.
Draco stared at her. So did Harry. The strange part was that both Grandfather and Mother had smug little smirks as if this meant something more than a simple reference. Which… well, maybe it did. Professor McGonagall didn't lapse into brogue all that often, only when she was furious or profoundly relieved.
"I wouldn't dare!" Draco squawked, face going so red it looked like he was about to burst into tears.
Harry nodded. Then nodded again as he rubbed his hands over his thighs to get rid of the sweat. He turned to Grandpa Arcturus who was pale as the white in his beard and clutching the doorjamb like he could barely stay on his feet.
"Huh," Harry grunted as he sat cross-legged in his chair. "I wonder why Mr. and Mrs. Weasley didn't have it done for Ron, then."
Fred and George exchanged looks. Bill snorted and patted Fred's shoulder while Charlie draped an arm over George's shoulders. The two of them smiled, eyes bright and smiles firmly determined.
"He doesn't want to be free," Draco whispered again as he turned and then went to curl up in a ball on the wing chair set before the blazing fire.
He hadn't been sure, deep inside, whether this would work. Yes, it should have. But when had Harry's luck ever been that good?
But Dobby and Ivy and Cooper all saw magic as fully and totally alive. It was as alive as they were, or Harry was.
The stubborn blessings dissolved. Further off, far away from Malfoy Manor, more and more blessings unraveled like bonfires flaring up into the night. The sky went brighter and brighter until it was teal with bright gold stars spinning waltzes across the night.
"You're here!" Mr. Swashlin exclaimed as soon as Harry stepped inside. "Thank goodness. Come sit down. I've so many questions. You have been getting my letters, right? Emily will be bringing tea, I assume. She always does, especially for my more important clients. No one's more important than you, though. Goodness, you're the image of your father with those glasses but those eyes are all Lily."
He reached out and pulled the limp fabric of the tent flap open, giving Harry a good look into the interior of the tent. Which was huge and beautiful with yellow and burnt orange wall hangings, couches and multiple rooms that had a Middle Eastern feel to them. Harry blinked and stared, shaking his head.
"It's not much of a maze," Harry commented. "I can see that there's no wrong turns. It's not even that high. In a year or two, I'd be able to see over the top of the hedges without standing on my tip-toes."
"All right then," Arcturus said with those smile wrinkles blooming around his eyes even as Harry heard laughter in his voice. "What's the good news?"
"Eh, that's just track record," Harry said, snickering. "We'll get through this. I won't let you go, and you won't let me make stupid mistakes. We'll figure it out eventually."
"No, he would have," Professor McGonagall agreed. "All right, you children will stay here. We'll attack as soon as we get changed."
"All of those things… feel familiar, Draco," Harry said, frowning. He tapped the display again and yes, all of them had the same magical signature. "That's… I'd swear that it's Dumbledore."
They'd gone back and forth between the dungeon and the library, searching Potter Keep's records for anything that might remove the curses. Between what they found there, the goblin's efforts and the suggestions from both Mother and Grandfather Arcturus, hours upon hours had passed in brutal tests that only a werewolf could have survived.
"Yes," Draco agreed. He tugged at Harry, pale and shaking. "We have to go. The wards will keep him out but—"
Especially when Professor McGonagall casually mentioned the soulbond and both of them reacted as if they'd been slapped.
"Yep," Harry agreed. "Everybody take a seat. Do I need Dobby to bring you a different chair, Silverclaw? I'm sure he can find something if you need it."
"What ritual?" Hermione asked in a screech that might have broken glass. "Harry! You can't do rituals! You don't have the training!"
Amal shuddered before shoving a whole biscuit in his mouth, chewing like he was trying not to scream or get sick right there on top of his notes. Harry slowly sipped his tea, staring at those final two biscuits, not because he was hungry but because he needed to focus on something.
Moody caught the back of Draco's jumper, hauled him back upright and then passed him off to the green-faced junior auror whose hands shook as he held Draco up. Amazingly, Moody nodded approvingly to Draco even though he'd almost fallen down in front of everyone.
Or, you know, maybe not proud. It would've been perfectly appropriate coming from an exhausted wolf, though. Sort of.
The lobby of Gringotts was busy, as was to be expected in the middle of the day. Draco had spent more time with the wards than he'd intended. It was approaching noon already. Despite that, Mother got them an appointment with their account manager Silverclaw with no delay at all.
"Did Remus rip Dumbledore's throat out?" Draco asked, blinking at the torch-blackened arches of the ceiling as he tried to sort out if that'd been real or imagined or some sort of magical allegory that he would have to study for the rest of his life and leave reams of notes for their heirs to figure out.
"Yes, I will," Draco promised. "Call the other elves, Ivy. Bring them here. I'll free them all from Father and let them bond to me. Every single one of them."
Draco and Harry left Mother to her outrage, following Mr. Swashlin to the floo. To say that Mr. Parkinson was displeased to receive notice through the floo was putting in extremely mildly.
"…When would I have had the time?" Draco asked, more than a little annoyed. "Father died yesterday just after noon. The wards landed on me as he died because I was the only Malfoy nearby who didn't have the Dark Mark. There hasn't been a Malfoy with the ability to interact with the wards in two full generations. Perhaps three. On top of that, the aurors and the Unspeakables didn't leave until after midnight."
Harry opened his mouth to ask something. Something horrible and terrifying, or that he was terrified by. He shut his mouth again when Draco urgently shook his head no.
Remus howled like a wolf as he charged at Dumbledore on all fours, awkward and terrifyingly wolf-like despite being mostly human.
"He's thirty-three," Amal said very sadly indeed. "He was just twenty-two when he was sent to Azkaban for betraying your parents."
"Down to the basement," Harry declared. "We'll give it a try. If nothing else, we'll have eliminated one more thing that doesn't work. That has to help. Eventually we'll find what does and then we'll be able to figure out how to help everyone else so that there's no more Dumbledore controlling everyone's lives.
Frankly, Draco had wished quite ardently that she'd pass out from shock and exhaustion more than once.
"So, anyway," Harry said, hoping that his blush for the affection didn't show too much, "I need to have a safe place to stay. I think an unplottable location with the best wards the world has to offer would be good. I need allies. Amal suggested that we contact my godfather's … patriarch?"
“Yeah, don’t do that,” he grits out. “It’s really fucking annoying.” He tries really hard not to think about those eyes raking his body, Malfoy’s wiry forearms pinning his body to the mattress.
It was Draco who pulled back first, to Harry’s disappointment. He released Harry’s robes, and Harry avoided the risk of his knees collapsing under him by resting his weight against the desk behind him. They really were the perfect height for these kinds of activities. They were both silent for a moment, breathing a bit harder than usual as they gazed at each other. Harry wasn’t quite sure what his face was doing; it didn’t feel like he had full control over it yet.
Draco’s answering grin is positively feral. “You wish,” he says, and just like that the room is too small, they are too close, and it’s all Harry can do not to throw himself at the pale blonde git. He wants to rip open Draco’s robes and run his tongue along the sharp collarbones he knows are lurking beneath them. He wants to kiss a trail down the length of Draco’s left arm, press his mouth against the remnants of the magical tattoo that’s still there, an unrepentant symbol of Draco’s past that he’s left behind but refuses to hide. He wants to get on his knees and—
Draco smoothed his hair absentmindedly, seemingly lost in thought. “I think I would like to meet her, even if only so I can stop wondering.”
you have an invisibility cloak,” Draco said in disgust. “Because why wouldn’t you? And did you have that when you were in school, too?”
He doen’t know how long they remain pressed up together like that. They certainly don’t speak for some time, and when Harry doesn’t push him away Draco begins rubbing himself against Harry, slowly, tortuously, and Harry lets out a guttural moan. He deliriously wonders if they could stay like this forever.
Harry crossed his arms. “Yeah, well, you’ll just have to live with that,” he said. No way was he telling Malfoy anything about why he was stuck in this class.
“Potter, you of all people should understand when someone else is trying not to call attention to themselves,” Pansy said, giving him a hard look. “This wasn’t a plot against you; it was common decency and respect for Draco’s privacy.”
Harry shook himself. For all his talk about professionalism, it clearly didn’t take much to push him past the boundary in his head. He had to focus. Ginny had made assumptions, but she was wrong. He and Draco were a very effective Auror team, and it would be foolish to jeopardise that. Beyond foolish.
“What?” Harry asked. “I can’t even look at it?” He couldn’t help it; he kept darting glances back to his spinning clay.
“We were just talking in your office,” Draco said. He still wasn’t sure what had just happened, but it seemed wise to try and maintain some kind of continuity. “We decided to visit some old haunts in the castle, for history’s sake.”
Draco turned around to regard Harry Potter, who was staring at him determinedly further down the street, mobile pressed against his face. He allowed the corners of his mouth to curl upwards as he said, “I’d like that very much.”
“It looks like it’s all here,” he said as he glanced cursorily at each page. “There are victim interviews, summaries of key Pensieve records, the list of trainees involved in the surveillance, the list of all items stolen and later recovered successfully. Oof, that one goes on for several pages.”
