fasttttt
He turned to Harry. "Daddy, can daddy stay?"
draco we should have matching nicknames too
sirius i dont think we should do this
wtf how
why would he be jealous?
oh dont worry
I got into my apartment all choked up. I know I almost kissed Harry out of habit, but thing is, I think I actually wanted to kiss him.
no u idiot
His mother knelt down next to him, and cradled his face in her hands. "I know. It must be hard."
hey ginny
I did. I got under the covers, and was so tempted to hold him.
"Honey, why would he die? He's going to be okay. You're both going to be okay." She held him close as he sobbed and cried and shook. This was a type of hurt no mother could fix with a kiss. Teenagers were supposed to be full of hope, yet her son was feeling hopeless.
also what do u mean 'just like u were with harry'
he trust that you will not leave if he shows sadness
"Daddy!" Pax screamed at me, perched on Harry's shoulders. This all felt normal. Almost as if we had never gotten divorced and I was only coming home from work only to find my husband, kid and dog destroying the house.

"No, Paxey. It's not, and never will be, because of you," Harry answered. He held Paxton's hand, which was positioned on top of my thigh. And yes, it was shitty of me to not want him to remove it. Luckily, he didn't.

u guYS LETS CELEBRATE US FAILING CHEMISTRY AT MY HOUSE
Harry was pretty sure he had just let his soulmate go. He was beating himself up for not putting up a harder fight, for not trying enough to make him stay. He felt so stupid. His thoughts were all over the place, and he just needed someone to talk to. He just needed Draco.
i repeat
I fully turned around so I was completely facing him. I took both his hands in mine - they were all over the place, I had to calm him down. "Harry. Harry, you did not make me uncomfortable."
"So. I hope you're happy with him. Or, if you guys broke up, I hope you'll find happiness soon. I've found mine. Not the one I was looking for, or the one I wanted - but it's still happiness. If, four years ago, you would've asked me what happiness felt like, my answer would've been you. My answer still hasn't changed. It's still you. Accompanied by a few other names, too, though. I've made progress. I'm growing. I met a lot of people. I had sex. I still miss you. Maybe not like before, but I miss you. I always thought you were my happy ending. Maybe I don't get a happy ending. I hope you get one. You deserve it." He withdrew a breath. He was holding back tears.
"There was no mistake," Kingsley said crisply, rounding on Harry. "I specifically told the DMLE to keep the release a secret. So I want to know how is it that you managed to find out about a highly classified transfer that no one except me, the Head of the DMLE, and the Head Warden knew about."
Before Malfoy could respond, Camilla took the opportunity to say, "Which is why I suggested that you be his healer, Draco."
Harry shook his head. "I still don't understand. Why didn't I go back to my world? Why am I connected to you?"
Draco opened his mouth to make a sound and alert the Aurors outside, but the man pressed a hand against his mouth and motioned for him to be quiet. Draco remained frozen, pure terror coursing through his veins, trying to send telepathic messages to the men outside, when something caught his eye.
She frowned. "I know, Harry, and I won't tell Ginny unless you want me to."
forgotten about their promise. The one they had made so many years ago, while trying to recover from their war trauma, when they had promised each other that they wouldn't pointedly dig up stuff from the war and would just leave things be. He remembered what Ron had said very clearly, now.
Harry shrugged, making an impressed face. “I could get used to this.”
She nodded and offered him a reassuring smile. "And, although Kingsley had you believe otherwise, Robards was appointed as head of the undercover unit mostly because he offered to take the post. Your week off was just a convenient time for his promotion."
The two nodded and began the process of sealing the evidence in a magically reinforced case that preserved it against damage. Harry left them to themselves and strode across the room. Catching Buxley's eye, he jerked his head to the side and walked to the far wall. Buxley excused himself and walked over, looking tense.
turf without telling me." It was his turn to raise his eyebrows, and her turn to look annoyed.
"Yeah," Neville mumbled, and Harry sighed.
"Hey, Al, sorry. C'mere." He held out his hand, and Albus hesitated for a moment before slowly taking it and cuddling up against him.
"Hermione, if I could talk to Ginny about this, I wouldn't be here, now, would I?" he snapped, frustrated that she wouldn't just let it go.
He really had meant what he'd said to Mrs Buxley; he would always be grateful to the man. But everyone has their time in the limelight, after which they need to step back and let other prospective candidates take their place and support them to the best of their abilities. Harry knew his time would come sooner or later, and he knew that he would be more than glad to hand everything over to his successor and retire. Although he was passionate about his job, he didn't quite love it as much as Buxley did.
"The vase," Harry said, stepping forward. "Will remain here."
"Alright you guys, come on, give Daddy a break," Ginny said as she pulled James off from Harry's shoulders.
“Well, you know, considering your, uh, special circumstance, I was worried that word might spread and—” he broke off when Draco shot him a cold glare, floundered for a bit, and then continued. “People have been taking notice of your, uh, monthly absences around here. Mine is a small business, Mr Malfoy, you must understand.” He was looking everywhere but at Draco, wringing his hands and wiping the sweat from his brow as he spoke. “I still wake up from nightmares of my shop being shut down. You can hardly blame me for worrying that someone like you—someone with your, uh, problem—”
Harry continued to stare after the car till Hermione touched his arm and called his name.
"Good afternoon, Mr Potter. I hope I didn't inconvenience you by asking you out on such short notice," she said politely as she shook his hand.
"I'd forgotten how sharp you are, Mr Sandford. We use custom-made air purifiers, here. It has a soothing effect on the patients and helps them calm down before they meet with their Healers. We have them sit in the lounge for a good ten minutes before we call on them."
"The place I told you about; it's called Antares. Be sure to use an alias when you first start the correspondence."
"I only found out two days ago myself, Hermione, and in case you've forgotten—which I don't think is possible considering
The man's eyebrows fly up into his hairline in an exaggerated manner. "Are you sure you're on the wrong bus?"
The blond then moved his hands so that he had his thumbs pressed against Harry's temples and had his fingers splayed across the sides of his head, applying pressure on different spots along the back. "Tell me when to stop," he said again as he began to massage the pressure points.
"Why not?" he asked when he kept drawing blanks to every line of reasoning he could come up with.
He stood up and let her help him to the sofa, feeling drowsy and like his head was full of cotton. She helped him out of his coat and tie, undid the first few buttons of his shirt, and helped him take off his belt and shoes. He lowered himself onto the sofa and fell back against the satin cushions, sighing at the feel of the cool material.
Draco snapped his book shut with a nod and stood. They headed out of their shared living quarters, appearing from the outside as a small camping tent but magically enlarged on the inside to fit six single beds and lockers.
holding her wand out and illuminating the path ahead. Draco waited a moment, until she was one step ahead of him, before joining her, and that was when a startling realisation hit him: it wasn't Hermione who had been walking ahead of him; it was Draco who had been walking behind her.
viously."
The blond was quiet for a moment before saying, "People change."
It took Harry a whole, awkward minute to process that Draco Malfoy, who he couldn't stop picturing in green Quidditch robes, with a sneer on his face, on the Quidditch Pitch, yelling out insults at him, was asking him
Harry nodded his thanks and made his way to the back of the luxury suite. Pausing at the bedroom doorway, he watched the two Aurors as they went about searching for clues, and motioned to the closest one.
Harry nodded, and, satisfied with the affirmation, Demitri took off again, leaving the two men to watch as the glass ceiling slowly begin to crack and cave in. Harry grabbed Draco and pulled him to the circle. "Focus," he said. "Open the portal so we can escape."
"Just the usual. You?"
why you're here? Because I'd booked a room for five?"
something or someone."
"I'm not entirely sure about when I'll be back, actually."
Ginny had gotten paranoid about it because Rose had apparently lost all of hers and Albus still hadn't lost all of his. So Hermione had spoken to her dad and Ginny'd taken Albus to see Mr Granger the second he had stepped out of the bath.
"But you told Hermione."
Harry shrugged a shoulder and mumbled, "Won't get myself splinched, 'f that's what you're asking."
He thought it would at least give him the evil eye, but the bloody owl simply ignored him, and he muttered some more as he pictured different ways in which he could end the stupid ball of fluff's life. He rummaged through the cupboards and found the owl treats Ginny had splurged on the past week, and emptied the whole box on to the table.
"Yeah, I can. Where are you?"
"It's three, counting the flat." Harry shivered as the cold breeze nipped at his face when he stepped out. "Anyway, I'll be back before suppertime."
"My pleasure, Liz."
Harry glanced up at Neville's grinning face and grunted.
Harry blinked, confused by the sudden compliment thrown at him, and, feeling slightly embarrassed, nodded his thanks.
-headed?" he asked, and the owl clucked reproachfully. It finally took the letter from his hand, and he pulled his fingers away just before the stupid bird managed to nip or claw at him.
"I—I'm sor—"
"But Mum, we need to show this to Dad!" James said, leaning around Ginny and beckoning to Lily.
Draco looked up from his essay and regarded her with contempt. "Don't be mistaken," he said. "Just because Harry follows me around doesn't mean you and I are friends."
While on their way back, Draco asked, "Why
Harry nodded. He was thinking the same thing. First of all, the alleged thieves stole the vase. Harry wasn't sure yet whether or not the perpetrators knew that the vase was a monumental artefact from the war or that it had belonged to the Blacks. And, if they did know, and that was the reason for why they had stolen it in the first place, why'd they come back for a seemingly useless blueprint? Was it because, as Lisa had claimed, they were sending her a warning for going to the authorities?
Dumbstruck, and completely nonplussed, Harry slowly turned to look down at Lestrange, watching in disbelief as a single, clear teardrop escaped from the corner of his eye. And as they watched, Lestrange's eyes slipped shut, and he lay unmoving.
It wasn't time for him to break for lunch, yet, so he resorted to pacing around the room just to keep himself occupied. He'd been feeling fidgety for a while, now, since he had already finished his quota of paperwork for the day and didn't have any pressing matters to deal with at the moment. He kept thinking about Malfoy and Antares and Camilla and Liz and the vase and the Blacks and the kids and pre-schools and how Ginny hadn't called him any time recently, and it was all driving him mad.
Hermione hummed. "You haven't actually relaxed at all today, have you? Molly told me you've been up and about, taking care of the kids and meeting Audrey about pre-schools and stuff. Speaking of, I kept meaning to ask you but kept forgetting—why not just put them in the same one Rosie and Hugh go to?"
tell you is that the general suspicion regarding the accident being orchestrated by a third party is true."
Harry turned to see Ginny and the kids dancing around in a circle and watched them for a long moment, his mind whirring, but when Lily called to him, he grinned and joined in. So had he really just been paranoid about the whole thing? Had this surprise been what Ginny and Hermione had been hiding from him all along? There were still things Ginny had to explain, like why she'd lied about the tickets or why she hadn't just come clean to Harry about everything, but that was a matter for later, he decided, because he'd finally gotten what he'd wanted—all of his family together. Maybe this trip wasn't a complete waste after all.
"Harry, you know I love you and the children very much, and that we love having them here…" she paused, a conflicted expression on her face, and he turned towards her, worried.
"I don't feel too good either," he slurs.
Harry's meeting with Camilla stems another horrifying nightmare; Hermione has uncovered some interesting information about Lisa Barkridge's identity; Draco and Harry's meeting regarding a new healer for Harry goes sideways when Camilla makes a startling suggestion.
"I don't. I do it in retrospect."
"Very well, thanks for asking. So, this thing you wanted to talk about…"
"It's really not as big as it looks," I say, somewhat embarrassed at having my family's wealth thrown in my face—something I was used to flaunting, up until I moved to this humble little town.
He felt a surge of emotion and gulped a little more Firewhiskey before nodding. "Yeah, alright, I'll see what I can do." Neville stared at him, a dumbfounded expression on his face, and Harry smirked. "But, on the condition that I babysit you—me and a whole
Leaning over his desk, Harry clicked on the button connected to Buxley's buzzer multiple times, his mind racing at the same speed as his heart. His deputy threw open the door thirty seconds later, wand at the ready as he looked around the room. Finding only Harry standing in the middle of the office with a wide grin on his face, Buxley made a confused gesture and put away his wand.
Instead of replying, Harry began to undress, and Draco spun around, his heart jumping into his mouth. "At least
Harry glanced around, looking for Malfoy's roll of parchment and Self-Inking Quill, and as though reading his mind, the blond said, "My way of doing things is a little different from the others. Everything that transpires in this room will remain between us only. I'll be taking a few notes for my records, but beyond that, our conversations or the tests and tasks that I give you—"
Harry watched as they walked to the far side of the room. Malfoy's back was towards him, but from his rigid posture and his tense shoulders, Harry could tell that he was agitated. Camilla, on the other hand, seemed to be enthusiastically trying to get the blond to see the appeal in her suggestion.
"Neville," he urged again, trying to pull his friend off of the dying wizard, but Neville wouldn't relent. "Mate, it's too late."
She nodded distractedly, but still called out, "And I haven't forgotten about the paperwork!" as he pulled the door shut, causing Harry to pull a face and wonder if there was somebody else he could dump Buxley's work on.
Neville shrugged. "That's what I did."
"Because then there would be someone on the inside who supports your cause."
Scorpius threw his head back and groaned, throwing his arms in the air and stalking down the stairs as he demonstrated his frustration, and Draco chortled to himself. He would never have dared exhibit such behaviour when he was his son's age, but he had decided years ago that he liked his—now ex—wife's more relaxed parenting style, and, over the years, it had helped him become less of a stick-up-his-arse kind of person himself.
Harry relaxed then, grinning as he said, "Alright, alright."
"Why's that?" he asked, conscious to keep the accusing tone from his voice.
"Wouldn't you, if you were being accused of a murder you didn't commit?"
"Please, tell her to take another day off. No, actually, tell her to take the rest of the week off, if she pleases. The longer she's gone, the better for the rest of us."
"Wai—" Harry was cut off as Draco pushed him gently, and, once again, he was hurtling backwards into darkness.
"That's good, then." Harry signed off the last sheet of parchment and kept it to the side, placing his mug before him. "I hope I don't have to remind you that you'll only be present during the release? And you'll remain with the other unit once the transfer starts?"
"Well," the wizard replied, holding up the black book, "I can't say if any of the rubbish she went on about is relevant to the case or not."
"That bad?" Harry asked, grinning at her.
"You should've slapped me awake. Who carries another grown man to his bedroom?"
Lately, his relationship with Ginny had gotten sort of… tense, if he had to put it in a nice way. He had thought that he was at fault, at first, considering how much he'd been away recently due to all the Auror work, and his insomnia, but Ginny wasn't making it any better.
"Both you and I, are. Except yours is by choice, while mine is a necessity."
"I'm not sixty yet," Buxley grumbled, but Harry knew that the other man knew he had to accept defeat.
"Oh, she's doing great, thanks. The Leaky's been really busy lately, and she's finally decided she can't run the whole pub on her own."
Harry shook his head, breaking off that train of thought before it took a turn for the worst.
incorrigible," Harry said, eyes wide, and Draco laughed.
I inhale sharply, startled to have the subject of my recent emotional conflict sitting beside me. I smell a whiff of the familiar sweet scent again and involuntarily turn my head in the slightest to inhale again.
He stared at the Muggle pen, and then at her, and could've sworn that she was silently laughing at him by her blue eyes twinkled in amusement. Of course he'd have to use a Muggle pen, they were in a Muggle town, surrounded by Muggles, and he looked suspicious as it was, what would happen if he were to whip out a fancy-looking quill?
"I swear, Neville, it's a good thing I have self-control or you'd have my fist in your face right now."
Harry ruffled his hair and nodded. "Yeah."
"Look, get me home and then I'll let you lecture me all you want."
Hermione didn't look very convinced, but before she could reply, there was the gush of the Floo and Ron's voice called from the next room.
“What?”
Lily shook her head, snuggling against him, and he held her close, humming in the way he knew calmed her.
, as Draco called it with disdain, taking more time to explain the origins of the flowers he painstakingly grew than his own.
Camilla laughed airily and waved her hand. "No, no, nothing of that sort. The fault lies with me, and I understand your confusion, which is why I want to explain to you certain things about myself in order to iron everything out."
"No, Harry, that's not my point. My point is that if I were to have told you about this release, you wouldn't have taken that vacation, and trust me when I say
He nodded. "Yeah, yeah. We're all good, here."
Harry frowned. "What's the difference?"
He pointed his wand at the box and the cardboard dissolved to reveal the vase that had brought him so much misery. The goblin's eyes widened at the sight of it and he took a moment to examine the vase from all angles, nodding and making sounds of appreciation every now and again, before turning his attention back at Harry.
"Sure thing, boss."
For the time being, that was all that mattered.
"Mr Potter?"
Harry nodded. "Yeah," he said after he swallowed. "I want her there when we uncover worthwhile information. I'm still on the fence about whether or not she's a complete liar or just hiding certain information."
"Antares."
"That's too bad. But Ginny'll be coming back soon, anyway, and besides, I don't think the boys would've even missed their mum all the much in all the excitement."
He tried to laugh it off as he led Hermione to the sofa, but she really

"So, is he causing trouble?" Harry had asked after he poured me a cup of tea. Just like old times.
We spent the next few seconds sitting like this. I felt seventeen again. Fuck.

"Yes - you, son." I said, wrapping my arms around him. I could feel Harry shifting closer, too, so I decided to let him in this embrace.

yeah okay
wheres hermione
and ginny walked in
They haven't spoken since their phone encounter, almost two years ago. Yet, Harry can't stop thinking about him. Of course, nobody knows that. Everyone thinks he's happy, but that's because he is. Except when he's all alone and it's midnight and he's staring at their pictures together.
well u looked funny
bathroom
fuck off dksjkjd
do we care

nO GINNY WHY DID U DO THAT
draCO NO
dracos looking down at the ground
ok everyone come up to my room we'll talk about this later
"Yes."
and now shes dating ginny
ginny its okay
And when he watches years-old videos of them on the beach, his heart just clenches. And he feels empty. He doesn't cry, though. He smiles, and laughs, and dies a little bit inside. But just because he can't forget Draco, it doesn't mean that his whole existence has to be defined by him.
My heart was now racing a million times a second. Harry giggled - literally giggled - and squeezed my hand.
oh no
ur bribing him
what the fuck
woah why
hes making a mess in class hes muttering shit to himself
Pax nodded again.
i want to be there for him
i mean whatever
u know shit like that
question time
I groaned as I pushed all of Paxey's books in his backpack. I didn't know if I was supposed to bring clothes or not, because I knew Harry had a closet just for Pax. I brought his school uniform, though, cause I wasn't sure if Harry had one of those. I also brought Pax's favourite pair of shoes. I didn't know if I should've brought something for me to sleep in, cause technically Harry didn't invite me to spend the night, and I didn't wanna look like I was inviting myself in.
u guys want another sleepover next weekend?
u do realize that hes literally with me right?
but this is not the only reason i kissed u
aaaannddd the 10 minutes are up
"Then why divorce?"
well yea but
i need more
"I can't believe my own son would rat me out like this," I half-joked, poking Pax in his stomach. But seriously, Harry was so focused on making Pax feel better that he could've probably never noticed how red my face was.
rdaco

He cried and kicked and screamed and cried until his mum was kneeling down next to him, the same way she did when Draco first went away. But this time, she didn't tell him it would be okay. It wouldn't. They both knew it.

He was drunk off his ass, his hands shook as he sent Draco a small, very simple text. A small, simple text that held so much meaning and so much heartbreak.

lunA WHAT IS HAPPENING
i knew u would do this kind of thing so ive been waiting for 5 minutes outside ur house
yeah one sec
"I appreciate the thought and everything, but I can't just leave like that. No matter how much I hate my parents." He traced Harry's jawline with his thumb. "We will make this work." He tried to kiss Harry's tears away, but with each tear he made disappear, another one fell. And Draco just wanted Harry to stop crying. Draco was trying so hard to keep a straight face, to stay strong for the both of them, but he was failing miserably. Just like he failed everything else in life.
so i know what i did was shitty and i regret it more than anything
but that was 10 minutes ago

and i was hoping u still liked me too

Approximately an hour later, I was back at Harry's. He lived fifteen minutes away, and really, it should've only taken me around half an hour, but I was so nervous.
hermiones stalking skills are 10/10

harriet is pretty funny
added
added

"Me neither," Harry added.
oh yeah i remember that
wait what
changed their own name to
mission completed
no nicknames for me
'goodbye gays + ron & hermione'
and have sex
so he said 'maybe we could yk end whatever we have and see what happens?'
we have a test tomorrow
dean why are u sitting like this wtf

changed
yup yes we did
ur gonna thank us later
"But you don't know that! You don't know if- if what you're saying is true. What if the plane crashes? What if he gets hit by a car while crossing the street? What if his parents never let him come near me again? What if he dies and I'm not there to say goodbye?" His sobs came out muffled, his voice weak.
i have 0 idea where im going with this
yeah he did actually
couLD WE PLEASE STOP TALKING ABOUT THAT
"I want to stay with daddy AND you! Both! I been running around all day to stop you from leaving, cause I want both!"
he said so are u with ginny now?
and i wanted to leave but then he kissed me
and draco will be too
added
remus leaves some usually when he comes over
so me and dean talked yesterday
we know what we're doing
do u guys think he likes seamus too?
wait whats happening
very short chapter i know djkhdshd but im uploading 2 chapters so its okay jskjssj
"honestly i thought u were.. going out w someone else"
seamus has been exposed
not really
so mcgonagall said no
i feel like we should get the gay masters
me and dean havent been the same
i didnt know how
shit delete everything
i was playing with his hair
yo bitches
and draco said yes
I let go of his hands, and put my own on my lap so they wouldn't take control of themselves and accidentally hold him or something.
ok no one leave
"Paxey, come here, darling."
Harry broke down sobbing again. It was fucking pathetic. But it's been over a year since he last heard his voice. It was still so warm and so safe. "Why did you call me?"
"You could've at least returned my texts."
i mean im not complaining
alright im coming over
does anyone know where dean is i havent seen him since he got here
i think u should sort ut shit our with ur bf and his best friend
: dean tell him
leave me alone
do u?
changed
added
yes u idiot
mcgonagall is asking me if i knew about this
theyll be grateful for this okay
so weve decided tomorrow to hangout after school at that restaurant
knew it
what test u got
so he apologized and said 'ur a really great person and everything i just dont know'
who is it ginny
"Yeah. They both like each other very much. I think they might be soulmates."
That kinda broke my heart. I wanted both, too. I didn't know what Harry wanted.
And, of course, Cosmo wanted to join, so he did.
But then, what he did surprised me. With his free hand, he took mine and brought it up to his lips and briefly kissed it.
what is going on
well i mean
ugh fine
uGH THIS CHAT IS PRIVATE
but he said he'll tell u eventually
, but then it shrank down again, because I realized he must be saying this just for Pax.
bc hes single
ok so this is gonna cause a mess so just tell them that u lot have to sleep thats why we removed u
update: i cant find the spider
bc dean and ginny are dating
well idk if i should tell u guys
ur all dysfunctional gays who need supervision
where is she now
DFHJKSHSKDJJHDS
changed
for the record
"Did I make you uncomfortable?" He finally asked.
ohh the one who used to date luna?
just like u were with harry and shit
i have to do something
Cosmo barked once and wiggled his tail. Pax took that as a yes. "Cosmo says yes!" He hugged Cosmo and went back inside.
is this what it feels like to be in a relationship
yes thank u
"Um, well. Yes. Technically, we're divorced." I could tell Harry was surprised by Paxton's response.
to get ginny to confess who her crush is
sirius u werent dating anyone back then its not the same
sO THATS WHAT YOU WERE WHISPERING ABOUT
bc experience
"Harry-"
will you stop with these
and if hes not okay
hes never acted this way before
"Oh."
he might be thinking that too
changed
renamed the group
i just saw my girlfriend kissing her ex boyfriend
"Because, well, you were kind of red, and- and I thought you might've gotten a bit uncomfortable," he said, after another second of silence.
oh u guys btw
the rules are the rules
"Good. Me too."
he wasnt really upset when we got here
and very gay
i obviously said yes
and that hes been acting weird for like a week
think u idiots
Harry nodded, taking a bag from me, completely ignoring that I told him no. It felt a bit good, though.
oh my gOD DRACO
shouldve probably deleted that whole thing before adding u lmao
i love him so much and i just want him to trust me
well yes
weeeelllll
Harry threw his head back in laughter at that. God, he was beautiful.
It's been almost four years. Harry now has a boyfriend. And a job. And his friends are still by his side. He should be happy. He should feel grateful. Yet, a small part of him wishes he was still sixteen. He wishes it was still Draco's lips that would caress his  own. He wishes it was still Draco he would go to sleep with.
shes not in harrys room anymore
and shes saying something to seamus
"And I wanted to. Really, I did. I miss you all the time. I miss you like crazy. I still have all our photos and I look at them all the fucking time. But this was easier."
looks like it
U GUYS THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION
and where are u exactly
ah that was good
sleepover time?
to talk about u seamus
"Divorce," Paxton said, his eyes watering.
why did u leave tho
i cant come
does anyone even care about what i say
so has anyone talked to neville lately
ugghhh f i n e
why do u guys have so much chocolate in ur house
and me!!
Pax turned around to me again, "You want to stay?"
we're taking a break
bye dad bye remus bye sirius
it was just an i like u remus
ugh fine whatever
thank u
"You know," he let out some air. "I haven't cried about you for years. This is the first time. And," he tried wiping his tears away, "I just. I just wanted to hear your voice. Maybe get some closure. I don't know if you changed your phone number, but I never did. Just in case you decided to call me. Man. This was a stupid idea. I should just stop talking. I'm sorry. Goodbye."
nope u will not make us feel sorry for u
not happening
what contest
its fine
"Oh. Okay."
added
u can all talk to him if u want idfc
we are very proud of u
im kind of with ginny on this one
hermione wanna come over
so what did he say
really
i shouldnt have said that
yeah we are
how did u even get here
ur welcome
no srsly not ur business
i dont wanna be murdered by ginny
so anyways
ginny found luna and neville kissing in the bathroom
bc drama
exactly
"Why didn't you call me, then?! What is it that kept you from texting me?"
she did tell me she was going to the bathroom
is anyone up
but he was so fucking quiet and i didnt know what to do
welcome back
do u like ginny
"I don't know. A bit less than a year." He can't remember a time he felt genuine happiness during that year. Sometimes, when he misses him the most, he would close his eyes and try to remember how his arms felt wrapped around his waist. He would try to remember how his hair felt between his fingers. He would even sometimes try to remember how warm Draco's laugh had once been.
so do u like dean
ok theyre gone
i like u
listen dean there are some things that should not be said aloud
dude s h i t
"You wanna, uh, be closer, or something?"
thanks
"Okay. Do you, uh, wanna go to sleep? We have to take Pax to school early tomorrow."
all of us
stop adding me wth
could u be a bit more specific
name to
: sorry dean
it doesnt matter
we're all with u
leave me alone
ginny/luna/neville is now a thing
Pax looked a bit confused, but looked at Cosmo nonetheless and asked him very seriously, "Cosmo, do you want both daddies here?" He pointed at Harry, then at me.
noice
allow me
After putting Pax to sleep at around 8 PM, Harry and I went back downstairs.
go have fun lmao
Silence.
what do we do
nothing harrys being dramatic
"Why didn't you come back?"
"Okay. Okay, good. But just in case you are, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to-"
seamus is shaking his head
whats happening
He was right when, four years ago, he had said that Draco was his soulmate. He was also right when he said he would never see him again.
thats cause he likes u
removed
"Come on, get more comfortable."
yes child
so are me and hermione the only single people in this gc
ah welcome to this v dysfunctional group chat friend
want me to come over and help u?
"Yes, baby, serious."
y e s

I felt like we were both teenagers again. Re-doing all of our first steps. But this time, with a kid.
yeah they were just showing us around
"He is."
we have to help these poor gays
so at least u dont like draco
"Daddy, you gonna stay?"
eating disorder
my uncles
so u know how seamus likes dean
lets talk
tell dad everything we just talked about?
"How long has it been?" One of his friends had asked.
u all have 10 minutes to get here
valid
i thought youd be cool with it
had Draco replied. He threw his phone across the room and curled himself up, letting his screams out. He heard his phone ring a few seconds later, so he reluctantly got up from the floor to fetch it and flip off whoever was calling him.
"Is that okay?" I looked over at Harry. He nodded. "Okay, I'll go bring his stuff for school. Should I come and get him tomorrow?"
hE SAID IT WAS SEAMUS?
u know she has a point
we're the gay masters
what?
can everybody stop leaving
ginny knows tho doesnt she
so we got detention tomorrow
OMG U GUYS THEY SAW HER
oh no its fine
im crying ginnys throwing a fit its the funniest thing ever
seAMUS WHY DID U BRING A LAMP
i have severe anxiety
"Yes. I am. And I'd appreciate it if you'd be happy for me."
"Do you?"
well he told sirius
changed
changed
snape is getting suspicious
"Why? You could just come live here with us. Your parents suck anyways." Draco couldn't help but smile at that.
sorry guys
then ur not either

how come u dont have a nickname harry
added
u know?
he was like 'idk do u?'

IDK I PANICKED
i think we all just witnessed something incredibly cute
: im sorry
renamed the group
but remus
removed
hola u people
what happened
God, I remember how excited we were that we were gonna finally have a kid. Harry almost cried the day we decided to signed the  adoption papers. I still remember the way he put his hand over his mouth and his eyes watered a bit. And I knew, that day, that I was always gonna be with him forever. Or, I thought I knew.
ginny are u talking about
well he didnt show it at least
ah yes perfect
changed
pft okay fine

harry wouldve won
but its just
has dean ever talked about seamus to u
"Whatever works."
i love you too
sorryyyy
"Honey, dinner's ready," his mother said, opening the door halfway and sticking her face through. Harry was shaking, his back turned to her. He knew he had to stop the sobs from coming out, but this was his mother, and he really needed her right now.
someone eavesdrop on themm
stfu draco ur always there anyway
I looked at Harry. "Pax, we have to go. Daddy and me both have work tomorrow. And you have school."
very veRY late i knOW
i think hermione and seamus are coming back

harry listen to me
"But where would you sleep?" I felt like a dumbass.

g u y s

i am so not ready for school tomorrow
dean and ginny broke up
"We have to talk," Harry told him, calmly.
i very am
he talks abt him all the damn time
"No."
i knoiw
yeah i mean dean has just admitted his undying forever love for you
we both like someone else
i know!!
We went into his room, and I changed into more comfortable clothes in the bathroom - I didn't bring my own clothes, so I borrowed some of his.
ur not even with us
so many issues
added
the spider is down
we were there for like two seconds - remus
yeah so i told him okay
oH COME ON
"I don't know, darling. Ask daddy."
no shut up
name to
dont add draco back okay?
isnt that right draco
"It's been months since we last talked. He promised he would never let me go." Harry felt a tear scroll down his cheeks. He was so angry. He was angry at himself, angry at the universe, angry at his parents. He was angry at Draco. What a prick, leaving him at the mercy of his own thoughts.
When he got here, all he whispered was, "Serious?"
solve ur shit bois
nO dean dont sit like that
hes coping
add ur friend ginny
interesting
theyre being disgustingly cute rn
this is bad
this is cyber bullying
was that u screaming
well idk they said something about dean

read back
I looked at him, cringing a bit, "Not really."
all u have to say is hey???
tell ur bf we love him too
"So what? Next thing you'll be getting a boyfriend."
we can talk this one out
added
he ended up falling asleep after a few minutes
i wanted us to get back together
We turned the TV on, but didn't really watch any. I could see Harry was lost deep in thought, and I was lost in how gorgeous he was. I wondered why or how someone could be so beautiful. His curls fell perfectly on his forehead, and his glasses were perched graciously on his nose, threatening to fall down. His eyes were fixed nowhere in particular, and his brows furrowed. His pink lips were pursed in thought, and I felt like kissing him then and there.
but she wont tell us who
so the parents
seem like it
oh yeah whos that
uhm i go too
"You talked to me about divorce before. Last day we lived together."
Harry had just come home from the airport. He had just said goodbye to - he thinks - the love of his life. And yes, three months is too short to know everything about someone. But to them, those three months felt like three years, And no matter what was going to happen to them after this, Harry was glad he had met Draco.
we'll add u later
this is not your fault
ugh hurry up im lonely
i feel like theres something going on 100%
changed
: yes so who is it
and like
now that weve all made up
but hes been playing w his hair a lot
he got out of his own class and into ours, saluted mcgonagall and told her that ron would like to get out of her class
wait so sirius has depression too?
we didnt want u to get hurt so we told them
DJSJKSJSKSJ DR AC O
well usually id say hes joking but i think we're gonna come back next week
also me n draco are leaving now
about what
"I did go on with my life, but I swear not a second passed where I didn't think of you."
"Yeah?" His head popped out of the kitchen.
he trusts you enough not to act okay around you all the time
luna's here
"I'm sorry I let you go."
what?
"Adoption. And no, never. We'd never put you for adoption again, baby." He looked so sad that I couldn't help but bring him closer to me and just hugging him. Harry sat down next to me. And I knew this wasn't the right time, but I felt like a high schooler again whose crush just sat down next to them in maths class.
renamed the group
do not worry ginny
u miss urself?

"Draco. Uh, hey. I'm not sure if you remember me. I'm Harry. Um. I thought- I don't know. I'm a mess. Sorry. I don't know if this is a good idea. But my boyfriend just left to pick his sister up from the airport, and I'm home alone. Yes, as you can see, I have also got a boyfriend. Anyways, I wanted to apologize. Last time we talked, I went crazy when you told me you were dating someone," Harry chuckled. He so desperately wanted to go back in time.
let us handle this
draco u son of a bitch
so then when she kept on ignoring him
well seamus hasnt
so anyways
and i took his phone
he was like hey sorry i thought no one was in there
pray for me
Harry propped himself up on his elbows, facing Draco. He felt his breath hitch in his throat and his eyes water. Draco gently caressed his lover's cheeks, leaning up to kiss his soft lips. "Don't cry," Draco whispered, holding back his own tears.
bro i didnt even notice that wtf
theres nothing to talk about
oh god
ok goodbye u old hags
uhm so do u wanna maybe come over
sorry
that is some delicious information
congrats u gays
ive been seeing someone
uh yeah

"I know. I don't blame you."
will u let me bathe in my victory for 2 seconds u assbrick
"Draco?"
or a kiss
i dont know
i think
IDK I PANICKED
i think rons right ginny
"Did you really- did you really mean it when you said-"
my eyes
what how
And Harry never knew if this message got to Draco, or if he responded to it, or if he even listened to it. After hanging up, he quickly blocked and deleted Draco's number. This was his second chance at life. And he was gonna make the most of it. Even if his heart still belonged to a certain sixteen year-old boy with a beautiful laugh who lived miles away.
we were talking to harrys uncles
"And we'll respect that," Hermione said, giving the girl a stern look, "Won't we?"
“It’s…” Draco started, “it’s beautiful." Draco sat down on the soft sand, letting the grains run through the spaces between his slender fingers.
Draco let out a short whine, growing impatient. Harry had promised him he’d stop by once school let out and the blonde didn’t know if he could wait any longer; the boy was probably the only one to make him feel okay, even if it’s for a mere few hours. Their relationship was growing stronger by the day, the past two weeks spent together full of just them. The blonde was beginning to get comfortable with the idea of having Harry around, after spending almost two years of aimlessly pining after him. Until his depression decided to ruin his happy streak.
“Shhh, it’s okay,” Harry soothed, rubbing Draco’s back, “I shouldn’t have said that.”
“Aha!” He exclaimed as he managed to hack into their security cameras. He stood, grabbing his necessities with a smug smile. “Soon you will be mine again,”
Stay - Post Malone
“What do you mean
But instead, he silently watched from afar, making sure that the blonde was okay at all times.
“We should go,” Harry whispered softly. Draco nodded, but he remained in the same spot. The dark-haired boy sighed and moved to sit up but was stopped by a hand pushing him back down.
He walked up beside him, leaning down to whisper, "I can't wait for tonight,"
“…you what?”
AND he was openly bi! Draco sighed in contentment, allowing a fond smile to grace his features.
Harry looked up and watched Draco take out his phone. A smile appeared on his pale face, making the girls immediately question him. He swatted them away and typed a reply.
A timid knock sounded on the door, "Draco, may I come in?"
The waitress came and politely led them to a table for two. She introduced herself as Alyssa to Harry, winking at Draco.
The man, narrowed his eyes at him in confusion, lowering his hood and mask. “How’d you know it was me?”
extra long chapter to make up for the awful chapter before this one :)
playlist:
His mind wandered to his parents for the first time in a while, specifically his mother. Draco hardly sees her anymore between his schooling and her job, plus any time he spent the night at his friend's. He'd been so worried about himself that he nearly forgot about her. A deep sense of guilt settled in his chest; he should be there for her.
Daddy Issues - The Neighbourhood
Draco groaned as he woke, his head throbbing in pain. He winced, moving his hand to massage it, only to find it tied down. His eyes shot open, falling shut again, hissing at the sudden bright light stinging them. He forced them open to find himself in his own living room. Surprisingly, nothing was out of place, aside from the fact that he was strapped to a chair in his own home with no one to be found.
i'm so surprised by the amount of attention this is getting?? thank you to those of you who have read this so far :) next chapter will be up soon!
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry, though it feels like it's been years. Sure, he crushed on him forever, but he never got the chance to see this side of him. He can't help but think he might be.....
Blaise pressed his pointer finger to his pale lips, which was quickly slapped away by the angry blonde. "Woah there, Princess. They let me enroll again."
“Oh, they’re wonderful. Do you think you and your mum would be up to stop by sometime? Adrien asks about you
“Wouldn’t I?” He taunted, folding his arms across his chest. “I will do whatever it takes to get you back. You have my word.” Anger overpowered Draco's fear, pulling harshly against its restraints.
“As young and rebellious teens, we partied
Heavy - POWERS & Kiss - Pale Waves
Draco walked tiredly down the steps of his house, having gotten maybe two hours of sleep the night before. He was kept up by his thoughts, mainly remaining on Harry and his father. Narcissa came to greet him, giving him a peck on the cheek before letting him go off to school.
“The m-moral of the story being that I’m a-afraid; afraid to lose whatever i-it is that we’ve established between us. A-Afraid to hurt you because of my own stupid p-problems. Afraid to lose you.” Draco whispered this last part, almost too quiet for Harry to hear. The tan boy kissed the top of Draco’s blonde covered head, leaning his cheek against it. “I-I’m sorry I avoided you. I-It was stupid of me and I’d go back and undo it if I could.”
“I feel like I’ve failed as a mother,” Narcissa cried, “Letting him get to you like that,”
“What. You’re blackmailing me?” Draco hissed in disbelief, keeping his voice down as if his neighbors could hear him. “And why should I listen to you?”
Draco blushed, scoffing in disbelief. He took a deep breath, closing his eyes and mentally preparing himself for the wounds he would soon be reopening.
But after what happened…he didn’t know if he was ready. “I don’t know.”
Harry walked through the school hallways, an abnormally large smile on his face. He received some weird looks, only slightly different than the usual, but he couldn't care less. He was actually
WASTE - BROCKHAMPTON & i miss the old u - Blackbear
Ron winced at the use of his full name, Harry knowing full well that he hates it. Ron fell silent, leaving Harry feeling slightly guilty. He muttered a quiet 'fine', leaving Harry to walk on his own.
The crisp air grew colder as they lay there, though neither of them really cared. However, they knew that they would eventually have to leave.
“Hell yes.”
“Yeah...have I not told you?” Harry asked, furrowing his eyebrows, racking his brain for any recollection. Come to think of it, he hadn’t even been home enough in the past month or so to have a conversation that didn’t include whether he had eaten or done his homework.
The car soon slowed to a stop at a forest, though it was nowhere near as menacing as one would think. Draco got out of the car, looking around in wonder. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, splattering in odd patterns on the brush-covered ground. The trees stood proudly in their glory, almost as if it were inviting Draco to walk between them. Harry joined him at his side, a cooler strapped over his shoulder.
“Shall we?” Harry smirked, and the blonde rolled his eyes, but intertwined his slender hand into the larger one anyway. Nerves bubbled in Draco’s stomach, a few people already giving them odd looks. Naturally, Harry noticed and rubbed the back of Draco’s hand with his thumb, the same way the pale boy did to his. He leaned down and whispered into Draco’s ear, “You okay?”
“You need it more.” Harry cut him off. A teasing smile made its way onto his face. “Don’t make me force this on you too.”
Draco looked at him in surprise; that was not the answer he was expecting, "Me too. If only it were easier..."
The blonde frowned, twisting his wrists within the ropes; the more he tried to escape, the more it felt as if they were slowly tighter. “An offer? For what?”
“I think,” Draco started, letting his breath catch up to him. He took a deep breath in before letting it out.
left him that day just one year ago, Draco was stuck picking up his own broken pieces. His eyes soon fluttered shut in exhaustion, his vision slowly fading into sleep.
"O-Oh, well, I just wanted to make sure." Pansy stuttered out, forcing a smile on his face. "Draco's kind of skeptical."
It remained that way for the entire period, to the point where Draco's neck felt stiff from keeping his head facing the board at all times. The bell rang as a signal for lunch and Draco shot out of his seat as fast as possible. He made it into the quickly-crowding hallway, pulling out his phone to shoot his friends a quick text. The blonde made a run, or as close to one as he could manage, for the library; a place he hoped the other male wouldn't even think to check.
happening again. But I think you should give the poor guy a chance. He’s been waiting a long time for this too, you know.”
A gasp was heard to his left, a watery voice piercing Harry’s heart in familiarity, “Harry?”
"Are you implying that there will be another one?" Harry smirked, regaining his playfully snide composure. Draco's face heated for probably the hundredth time as he looked down at his lap. Harry did seem to have that effect on him.
“Dray, you need to eat,” Harry replied sternly, concern dripping from his typically honey-like voice, though he couldn’t hold the act for long. “I’ll force-feed you if I have to.”
Draco sighed; maybe it was too good to be true.
“Did you say ‘he’?” Sirius teased, a grin wide on his face. Harry lifted his head, narrowing his eyes at them quizzically, nodding slowly.
“I’m still sorry you had to go through that,” Pansy mumbled into his chest, loud enough that he could just barely hear her, “No one should have to, especially not you.” Draco smiled sadly, feeling that for the first time, maybe that statement was true.
Draco stared at him, anger, sadness and confusion swirling together in his stomach in an angry dance.
“Babe,” Harry said, giving the latter’s shoulder a shake. The blonde shifted but remained asleep. Harry rolled his eyes playfully, a smile splitting across his face. “Draco!” His eyes opened, squinting at the curly-haired boy sat in front of him in sleepy disbelief. Draco breathed out a laugh, before yawning openly. He was dressed in his usual letterman jacket, for what he could only guess as football; the one Draco had always admired from afar. His glasses were perched on the bridge of his nose, glinting playfully at him.

Sirius shook his head no with a smug smirk on his face; it takes a lot to get anything out of Harry these days. The curly-haired boy blushed, fidgeting awkwardly. “Oh. Well, now you know I guess… Anyways, back to him. What should I do?”
Time went on and things were slowly getting back to normal. Draco returned to school, though he looked much sadder than when Harry last saw him. He ached to just give him a hug, hold his hand in his own and tell him
"What the fuck are you doing here?" Draco hissed, as if people would hear, pushing at the other male's chest. "What makes you think you can-"
Suddenly, an idea popped into her mind and she smiled. Draco watched as she let go of his hand and whipped out her phone, typing a few things in.
Draco jerked away from him, turning his head to the side out of reach. Blaise let his shock slip for a moment, his stony face molding back into place within seconds. He let his hand fall to his side, crouching in front of Draco. The blonde made eye contact with him once more, his eyes shooting daggers at the man in front of him. “Why are you here?”
Draco held his breath absentmindedly, waiting for what he knew was coming.
Draco took a deep breath, summoning any courage he had left and unlocked the door, swinging it open to find the one person he didn’t think he’d ever see again.
Draco looked up from their clasped hands in surprise, “I figured I’d be the one asking you that, Mr. Popular.”
Draco pulled away breathlessly, lips red and puffy. He leaned his forehead against the latter’s, slowly opening his eyes to look at the boy underneath him. Green met gray-blue and Draco knew his heart was set. On what he wasn’t sure, he just knew he was finally
Draco backed away slowly, bumping into the stair railing. He was wearing a mask, but the familiarity of just his stance was overwhelming. He contemplated running back up to his room, hoping that they didn’t see him. His mind raced as the person on the other side started knocking, confirming his worries.
"Listen, Draco-"
Harry Potter? You’re joking.” Draco started, nearly laughing at his own stupidity for even believing it for a second. “You must be.”
Draco scoffed at his poor flirting, though his heart still skipped a beat. Man did he like this boy. "
“Draco!”
“Hi. Pansy and Hermione, right?”

“I-I…” Draco stuttered, and looked away, his mind reeling. Of course he likes Harry.
Pansy pursed her lips, rolling off Draco to flop next to him instead. She moved closer, curling into his side, “But you haven’t had that ‘dream’ in months…right?’
The boys walked hand in hand through the entryway, and the hall went silent. Draco was sure he could hear a pin drop. Harry practically pulled him down the hallway, for he was too frozen to walk himself. The eyes of the other students burned holes in Draco’s back, but he didn’t dare let it get to him. With one look at Harry’s determined face, he felt instantly better. The blonde stood up straighter as they rounded the corner to the next hall, filled with the same reaction.
“Tell me,” Draco replied, grabbing one of the large, tan hands on the table in his, “You clearly want to get it off your chest.” Draco may have seemed composed on the outside, but he was secretly losing it on the inside. He didn’t know what made him do it, but he didn’t regret it at the look on Harry’s face: contentment.
“Draco?” He yelled, pounding on the door, “I know you’re in there!”
“I…don’t know what to say.” Harry said, resignedly. He pinched the bridge of his nose in irritation. “It doesn’t excuse the fact that you did what you did and made me hurt Draco.”
Harry looked away from the blonde’s eyes, looking up at the bright moon illuminating them. “Because I’m a fucking idiot. Why did I come here? My friends could care less if I came or not. In fact, I haven’t seen any of them all night. Except…you know.”
Before dating Draco, his life was pretty boring. He was stuck in this repeated cycle, involving the same people who aimlessly follow him around. It never bothered him before, mainly because he didn’t have a reason for it to. It had become his life, to be popular, athletic, smart, the works. He couldn’t remember how he got here; perhaps it was when he first joined the soccer team in fifth grade. The coach thought he was amazing, one of the best he had seen in years. His teammates loved him, always complimenting something he did on the field and just hanging around him. At the time he didn’t care whether they were being fake or not, using him for his newfound popularity; he was just glad to be accepted. Now, he didn’t know why he had stuck with these people all these years. He was never truly happy, and he knew, deep down, that they didn’t

“Scout’s honor,”
"I know, mother. It's just...hard to talk about some things with you," Draco started, adding quickly before he made things worse, "I mean, not everyone talks about their love-life with their parents. That's just weird."
Draco soaked it all in, looking down at his black converse in consideration. Harry took notice of his own hoodie, oversized on the blonde’s small frame, the hem reaching his mid-thigh. He looked innocent, like a child being scolded for doing something wrong.
Draco blushed harder, turning his head and kissing Harry’s clothed shoulder, “Me too. I mean imagine having the biggest crush on the most popular guy in school for
Draco giggled, the sound bubbling from his throat freely, “Why thank you, kind sir.” He didn’t know how long it had been since he’d felt this at ease. The blonde settled into the shiny leather seats, internally rolling his eyes because
“Shh, it’s the thought that counts.”
Draco sighed heavily, feet planted on the school courtyard, almost afraid to walk between those red double doors. For what he wasn't sure, but he knew in the back of his mind that something was going to go down today. He inhaled deeply through his nose, the cool air coating his insides with dread. The thought of skipping class briefly flashed across his mind, but he knew his mother would surely kick his-
“Hey now, don’t get all depressed on me, Dray.” Hermione said, nudging him with her shoulder, though due to height difference, she shouldered him harshly in the side. Draco yelped in pain, rubbing the sore spot. Before he could retort with how he was depressed all the time, Pansy came bounding up to the pair. She squeezed in between them, wrapping an arm around Hermione, pecking her on the lips. They’ve been together for nearly three years now, having found each other during their freshman year. Draco pretended to gag, though he couldn’t help but wish he could find his soulmate too. The girls ignored him, sharing a loving look. Draco knew they were doing it to rub it in his face.
“Sorry,” Hermione said sheepishly, “I just couldn’t wait to tell him. And he was definitely shocked.”
Draco held back a laugh and opened his mouth to protest, receiving a salt and vinegar chip instead. Harry smirked triumphantly, popping one of his own into his mouth.
"Now. Let's get you ready."
Draco paled slightly, though he wasn’t quite sure what he was afraid of. Lucius has been against the idea that Draco is gay for years; he’s a firm believer that
“Hey love.” Pansy said, smiling brightly at her girlfriend. She looked up at Draco and ruffled his hair. “What’s got you all down in the dumps?” Draco gasped, frantically patting his hair back in place. He shot her a scowl, but she didn’t see it.
Draco could have sworn time had frozen in that very moment. The words spoken from the one person he wished to hear it most. But the real question was,

“The beginning would be nice.”
Harry breathed out a humorless laugh, removing his glasses to rub a hand down his face in exasperation. “Are you serious? Draco, what more can I do to show you how much I love you?”
Stop being a depressed nobody who can’t do anything but wallow in self-loathing and bother people with his own problems. He wanted to be able to go out with his boyfriend and not be afraid of the judgement or anxiety that he got from the looks he received from other people. He wanted to be
She said it like a statement, rather than a question. Harry blushed, containing his smirk in exchange for a kind smile; Draco must've told her a lot about him.
Draco smiled, shaking his head and taking Harry's right hand in his, "Just... nothing."
Harry strayed by the living room couch, back against the wall and cup of generic alcohol in hand, trying his best to keep himself away from the loud music and dancing. He made sure not to drink too much, wanting to go home sober to Draco. He still couldn’t figure out why he agreed to this; his so-called friends continuously pester him about it, still claiming that Harry deserved a night out to just hang with the guys and let loose a little. Despite wanting to hang with only one certain boy, he agreed, though mentally deciding this would probably be his last party.
“Yeah. Of course.” Draco faked a smile, grabbing Harry’s hand in his. “Go hang with your friends.”
Draco paced the carpet in front of his closet, desperately trying to come up with an outfit to wear. He knew he was acting like the stereotypical teenager going on his first date, but he couldn't help it; turns out it actually happens.
It was getting harder for him to make his decision; he didn’t want to let another Blaise into his life and get hurt all over again, though this time would be obviously worse. At the same time, he knew Harry; he was definitely not the type to cheat, even if it were a mere drunken kiss at a high school party. But he also didn’t think Blaise was the type either.
Harry was confused by her meaning behind that, but answered anyway, “I won’t.”
Harry let a few of tears of his own slip out. Draco doesn’t deserve this trauma. He wished he could take the pain away; whatever it was that the blonde was feeling, he would switch places with him in a heartbeat. “I r-remember screaming my l-lungs out, c-crying there f-for what felt l-like hours. P-Pansy was the o-one to f-find me; s-stayed with me until I c-calmed down. The p-police and a-ambulance arrived eventually, and I was r-rushed to the hospital, j-just so they c-could make s-sure I was f-fine.”
"Do you...ever think about who your soulmate might be?"
Draco sighed reluctantly, finally getting out of bed for what was probably the first time that day. He straightened out his clothes and ran a hand through his messy blonde hair and slipped on the nearest pair of shoes, which happened to be his black converse. He grabbed Harry’s hand in his, offering him a small smile and letting the tan-skinned boy lead him out of the house.
Bloom - Troye Sivan
Much to the pale boy’s surprise, Harry only hugged him tighter. Draco’s heart swelled in his chest at security he felt in those tan arms. His tears had slowed and begun to dry; he was thankful that the darkness hid the puffy skin under his eyes.
As much as he didn’t want to break up their chat, Harry couldn’t stand not talking to Draco any longer. He whipped out his phone, finding the blonde’s contact and texting him.

That shut her up. Pansy’s ears perked up, reminding Draco of a dog at the mention of treats, “Spill.”
“Oh, Draco…” He stopped, not needing to say more. Harry moved closer to Draco, pulling the trembling boy into his arms.
“Uh, yeah, actually.” He replied, looking at his phone in his hand. “I’m looking for ‘Nightmares and Dreamscapes’ by Stephen King. I can’t find it anywhere.”
“I missed you more.” Harry frowned into the blonde’s hair, breathing deeply, the familiar scent bringing an ache inside his chest. “What happened?”
“You don’t know how long I’ve wanted to do that,” Harry whispered, his soft voice sounding out of place in the room that was filled with sounds of lips locked together just moments before. Draco pecked his lips again.
The two lay there in the pale moonlight; for how long neither knew. They just enjoyed each other's company until they would have to leave each other's embrace.

“Ah, I’m sorry!” He said, stepping back a little bit so he wasn’t too close. “I wasn’t paying attention.”
“…Kiss you?” Draco said nervously, though it came out as a question. Harry’s expression changed into something Draco couldn’t decipher. The tan-skinned boy walked the small distance between them, tentatively putting his hands on either side of the boy’s small waist.
"What'cha smilin' about, Dray?" Pansy asked instead of answering, her eyes glinting wildly.
Draco narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the boy with his stare; he wasn’t acting guilty as one would in this situation, and Draco’s had lots of experience with that in his past. Harry fidgeted with his hands out of nervousness, not quite sure what to do with the rest of his body. He just wanted to hold the blonde and apologize as many times as his tongue would allow. Draco sighed, seemingly coming to a conclusion.
“But he’s mad at me.” Harry whined, frown deepening.
Harry spluttered momentarily, the smile leaving his face, before regaining his composure. "It's no one." He tried to sound casual, but the lies shone through his voice.
"What's up?"
The day went by quickly and the boys were now intertwined on Draco’s bed. Harry checked the time on his phone and groaned.
Draco made a strangled noise in his throat that he supposed could have been a flustered laugh, nudging his shoulder with the other’s, “Shut up.”
"Of course," Narcissa said, "since you won't tell me anything anymore."
“But really,” Pansy continued, pulling back enough to look the blonde in the eye, “Crying on the first date?”
The girls’ eyes widened simultaneously, looking at each other that said,
Draco sighed, closing his laptop and massaging his temples just as he heard the doorbell ring. He froze, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion. He knew of only two people that could be, though one should be at work and the other he wasn’t talking to.
"It's fine," Harry cut him off quickly, "I understand. It can be hard sometimes. Especially after, you know… seeing someone who doesn't turn out to be 'the one.'"
The voice didn’t respond. Draco sighed, in relief and exhaustion, willing the time to go faster. He turned his head towards his nightstand, checking the time on his small analog clock.
"Why not, Drake," pansy asked softly. she grabbed his right hand in hers and held it in a comforting gesture. This was one of the times Draco was grateful for having these two as his friends.
Harry looked between the two of them, earning encouraging smiles. He nodded once, standing up and fleeing to the blonde’s house.
“I know,” Harry spoke a little too quickly, making Draco’s face heat up again. “It was Pansy’s idea.”
Hours later, Draco sat in his history class, doodling aimlessly on the paper in front of him. The teacher, Mr. Binns, droned on about the civil war or something, while Draco looked up at the clock for what was probably the thousandth time. Draco sighed, willing time to go by faster, in hopes to get to his next class, pre-calculus, also known as the one class that Draco had with Harry, meaning his favorite class.
Draco swallowed, his mouth growing drier by the second, “I thought so too…but don’t you think maybe we’re moving too fast?”
Harry broke the short silence when he noticed something, “Why aren’t you eating?”

"Stop lying."

. They were the last people he could withstand judgement from.
Draco nodded quickly, attempting to take a deep breath, “Just get me through this,” It had been a while since he had any sort of anxiety attack, and he wasn’t about to start again. Especially not in front of the entire school.
He bent down close to Harry's ear, whispering, "So who's the lucky girl?"
“They just don’t…respect me?” Harry started, adding quickly, “Not that they have to! I just figured that since they’re my

Draco thought, knitting his eyebrows together. He finally had the boy of his dreams, and this was how he was acting? Said boy caught his stare, smiling at the blonde before returning his eyes to the road.
“It was just…” Draco began, massaging the back of his neck, sore from sleeping on the floor, “
“What makes you think I’d want to?!” Draco cried, distress leaking from his voice. Blaise hid his offense well, but it didn’t stop it from churning in his stomach. “I’m finally
Harry walked down the aisles, searching aimlessly for a book to read to pass the time. He ran his fingers along the bindings, stopping on one that piqued his interest. Satisfied, he returned to his table at the back of the library, hidden by rows of lined up bookshelves. Harry sat down and sighed in content, opening the front cover of the book to read.
WASTE - BROCKHAMPTON & i miss the old u - Blackbear
The blonde smiled wider, returning to his bed nonchalantly. Harry shook his head again, turning to leave the room, adjusting his suddenly tighter boxers in discomfort, ignoring Draco’s smirk.
"Ah, okay. Well, tell him I said hi," Harry said, turning to go back into the room, though he stopped, "Oh, by the way... between you and me, I've liked him since freshman year."

“Then do it.” Harry muttered, his voice gravelly with longing. Draco leaned in slowly as Harry did the same. Draco cupped the tan face in his hands, his confidence building as he pressed his lips against the latter’s. His eyelids fluttered shut, Harry following his lead. Harry responded quickly, hooking his fingers in the belt loops of Draco’s skinny jeans and pulling him closer. Draco tilted his head, giving Harry permission to deepen the kiss by practically crushing their faces together. Harry swiped his tongue along the blonde’s soft bottom lip, asking for entrance. Draco’s lips parted, allowing Harry’s tongue to slip inside, licking at the inside of his mouth. It felt as if they were on a cloud, with no one in sight but the two of them. And Draco loved every second of it.
He trailed off, leaving the statement in the dying wind. Draco’s chest ached as tears stung his eyes, but he willed them away. One tear escaped over his sharp cheekbones, trailing down and slipping over his jaw. He wiped it away quickly and sniffled.
Harry sighed in relief, giving Draco’s hand a soft squeeze, “I’m glad-“
“Draco Malfoy.”
Pansy grinned at him, slinging an arm around his waist and leaning into him, “Me too.” Draco was glad to have these people as his best friends.

"Yeah, but they're kids, Harry. I don't think they're half as worried about it as we are."
He stared up at the rather large building before him, taking in the ordinary white and glass exterior and the large, green plus sign in the middle. There was no name; it just said 'Clinic' in big, shining green lettering across the front. It looked like an ordinary Muggle hospital for all intents and purposes.
"So you don't know where he is?" Draco asked, stumbling again.
"Alright, men, it's time to move out."
"I managed." After a moment, he said, "Why did you think your parents came to this camp?"
Harry hummed and settled back as they watched the files, revelling in the silence of the Ministry at night, the only sound coming from the files stacking themselves.
"Harry." Kingsley stopped his pacing to come back and sit in the chair. "You know that not everyone is very happy with you becoming Head Auror."
Leaning forward, Harry clasped his hands on the table and eyed Lisa with a serious expression. She shifted in her seat. He cleared his throat and said in as calm a voice as he could muster, "I know Hertzfeld is innocent."
"Master is summoning Leeky?"
And Harry hoped, expected, even, to plummet into darkness, but Harry felt his back hit the asphalt as he skidded to a stop and collapsed back onto the pile of boxes, his mind going black just as he wondered if he would remember any of what had happened.
"Azkaban Prison," he muttered, feeling his stomach churn.
He'd just reached the bottom when he heard a rattling from the living room. Stopping dead in his tracks, he reached for his wand and realised he'd left it upstairs.
But even as he thought that, he could feel the gnawing tug in the back of his mind that confirmed that he had much more selfish a reason to do what he had done. Somehow, after embarrassing himself for the sake of sparing Malfoy a complicated conversation, he felt a twisted sense of relief settle within him. As though saving what could have ended up as a terrible argument between two people he wasn't close to at all somehow acted as a form of repentance for what had happened between him and Ginny.
“Ah, fuck,” he swore, dusting his worn jeans and straightening his loose T-shirt. His parents hated how he had started dressing since he had left St Mungo’s, several months after the war. He had left in one piece, but the patchwork that was his skin was a constant reminder that he would never be the person he was before the werewolf attack. Considering all he had lost in that one year, he didn’t see the necessity of dressing all posh and pretending to be the rich heir of a (mis)fortune that he was supposed to be.
"You seem surprised."
"I think…" He gestured to the older witch. "I think this lady here knows your parents."
"Harry?"
"Liz."
Harry nodded, motioning for the group behind him to swap places with the group around Lestrange. They paused for only a minute, just so the two groups could switch positions, but those sixty seconds happened as though in slow motion, allowing him to recollect everything that occurred as though he had paused time.
Harry gave him an incredulous look. "Trained Aurors stress you out while you're completely fine having a tea party with dangerous prisoners?"
"A wise decision, as always. Please, take your time; this is an important decision, after all."
"Why not? I miss her!"
"Ginny—" he hissed, trying to pry her hands off the wood, "let go, damnit—"
He lay on the bed for a long time, and when he felt like he had enough strength to stand, he rolled out from under the sheets and rose slowly to his feet. Dragging himself to the bathroom, he splashed his face, revelling at the coolness of the water against his burning skin.
"Let me cool it; don't be in such a rush," she admonished as she flicked her wand and cast a cooling spell on the tray. "There,
Harry grimaced and whispered, "Look, I'm sorry that things turned out the way they did, but next time, maybe you can talk to me before barging in here unannounced and demand that I do as you say in front of everybody?" Her lip twitched, but he continued quickly, "And maybe you could rely on me for help, next time, as I did with you, instead of going behind my back and forcing my hand."
Draco laughed, his breath warm against Harry's arsehole, and spread his cheeks for better access. 'I'll carry on, then,' he mused, kissing the rim more firmly, swiping the tip of his tongue over it just to relish in Harry's gasp. It seemed so small in that moment, so
‘They’ll be back,’ Draco dismissed, ignoring the glare Ron sent him. He did remove his hand, though. ‘Tell me something, would you? Have you seen Harry?’
Of course it didn't. How could it? How could any lame, sorry trick ease Harry's nightmares? Solve his insomnia, appease his running thoughts - no, nothing short of leaving the bed entirely could do that. Nothing except for cold air and laughter and liquor.
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
Come yell at me on discord, at autumn#2451
Most likely because of whatever connection the house had with his late godfather. Draco had never been one for gossip, but sometimes he found himself disappointed that this particular story hadn’t been more spoken of - he knew close to nothing as it was, and it bothered him that such a clearly important part of Harry’s life was a stranger to him.
He walked away briskly, coaxing Harry with a steady tug on his arm. At the center of the hall, amidst the spectral figures, were Pansy and Luna already.
‘No.’
He elbowed his way through the mass of bodies and set his glass on the bartop. He’d order a shot, he decided, as soon as he was done with his first drink. Something different, exotic and vicious on his throat, that would clash with the firewhiskey. Maybe then he’d get a headache, or he’d feel nauseated, or some other kind of physical discomfort that would blissfully distract him. He’d hardly think of Potter if he was retching in the bathroom.
‘She’s a nice girl.’
Or sometimes, most obnoxiously, he'd sit in front of him in class, shifting in his seat, dipping his head  to write something down - which really was just to spite Draco, could only be, because Potter used glasses but he surely wasn't that blind -, or leaning to whisper something into Weasley's ear and then sniggering against the muffle of his hand.
‘You look awfully normal.’
'Yes?'
‘Who were you with?’ Blaise repeated. His long fingers wrapped tightly around Draco’s knee. Draco huffed.
‘Well, you
him - how was it now that he’d forgiven him? Could he even extend this invitation in the name of the entire group? Would they want him there? Did
Harry laughed, shaking slightly in Draco’s arms. ‘Yeah, you were definitely a good choice.’
‘Don’t be smug, Malfoy. The snakes look good. Almost the best of the party. Pass me the red one now.’
Hermione regarded him with something akin to pity. Why wouldn’t she, when Draco was the height of pathetic, sputtering helpless nonsense, clinging to his lie and begging for secrecy?
Harry’s smile quirked into a smirk. ‘Good. Just wanted to make sure, since we’re a bit shit at
‘Well, I really don’t see it as a quality,’ Harry retorted. He might have been looking at Draco - he sounded so annoyed that he probably was - but Draco couldn’t be sure, couldn’t summon the courage to look, lest he find their noses too close together and his lips search Harry’s unbidden. He was seriously considering retrieving the rum, if only to keep his lips occupied, even though the notion of relinquishing this intimacy was frighteningly unappealing, when Harry continued in a slightly wistful tone, ‘Ginny’s great.’
He closed the door behind him and went about finding the vials of veritaserum. Supposedly, they’d be like water, unobtrusive between the exuberantly coloured potions and various jars of ingredients. It was taking a while, and Draco found himself taking worried sips out of the bottle - he couldn’t bear going back empty-handed, not after he’d made such a big show out of going in there.
‘This?’
‘May we go fetch some from the greenhouses?’
‘Why’d you light the bloody candles?’
anyway.’
‘Well, it’s hardly the place for an apology.’
Harry was flushing a delightful shade of pink, and he rolled the sleeves of his white shirt with a frazzled, disbelieving laugh. He took another gulp of the firewhiskey, then said lowly, so only Draco could hear:
Draco sighed. He reckoned when Ron got his glass back it’d be empty.
‘I like it.’
It wasn’t like Draco had never thought about it. He remembered how resolute he’d been when 8th grade started: set on making amends with Potter’s friends. He would have charmed them, first with small, honest words that would earn him a neutral state as an acquaintance, later with enough polite trivialities to be considered, by temptative eyes, as a friend. And then, when Potter heard of Draco’s redemption, he’d already be insinuated into his group.
Harry was still glaring, and Draco dropped his gaze to find his own shirt. He didn’t want Harry angry, didn’t want to dispel the brief sweetness between them so completely. Perhaps he shouldn’t have said anything - but it was so easy to forget loyalties when Harry was near, when he was overrun with the instinct to help
That surely wasn’t what Draco had expected. He’d have guessed the unfamiliarity of the experience would have softened his erection, even despite how aroused he’d looked, how wanton and pink as he swallowed around his cock… but the thought that Harry had been so desperate that he couldn’t resist waiting, that he’d taken himself in hand as he sucked Draco off, that maybe he hadn’t even bothered to unbutton his slacks and simply palmed himself through the fabric, frantic and red-eyed and so utterly lustful... that was too perfect and too unlikely for Draco to actually consider.

‘Alright, I got one,’ Harry’s voice cut through his thoughts, ‘When we drank those shots, the other night, it was too much for you, wasn’t it?’
Harry raised an eyebrow, His fingers clutched the little thing against his chest, instinctively protective. Draco couldn’t much blame him - it was a bloody strange thing to ask.
Useful note: Alihotsy is a potion that makes one laugh uncontrollably.
‘I’m not certain if it counts as a scar, but I still have the Dark Mark.’

But the problem was: the night had passed.
uptight he was, he turned on his heels and marched down the corridor, a chorus of murmured 'good lucks' blurring with his footsteps.
'Are you going already?' he asked. When he properly looked at Harry, his smile grew infinitely more amused. 'I dare say, the colour looks better on you than it does on Lovegood.'
Then again, Draco hadn’t been much concerned about Harry’s self-respect when he was blowing him in the stall.
‘That’s the plan, Malfoy,’ Ron scoffed - there was a hint of annoyance there, but subdued, without harm, and Draco figured it was a good start.
Draco sighed. ‘Is she asleep now?’
‘Impossible.’
‘I doubt that’d be wise. What ridiculous things I’d say.’
Doubt creeped in. He murmured, half-hearted, staring at the box in his hands, ‘What the fuck do you know?’
And the way she stared at him confirmed it - like he’d been shaken by some sickness, raked by some worrying symptom only she could see. Like something dreadful would happen if she didn’t cure him soon. Draco understood: it was always difficult to see a friend swept up by hope.
When he couldn’t take more of the excited, erratic chatter of his table, couldn’t bear faking another smile nor utter another polite word, he leaned closer to Pansy to murmur:
‘Hm?’
‘I was thinking,’ Draco reasoned, ‘We could both do that. Call our replacements, that is. Come on, Potter, you’ve got nothing to prove. You’ve been here long enough - everyone knows how brave the Golden Boy is. No one will judge you if you ask to trade.’
When they came down from the edge, bodies spent and fingers sticky, Draco’s stomach was an insufferably painful knot high up in his throat.
Potions, that was worth his time.
It was heaven, sucking Harry off. It was the heady, hysterical feeling of having accomplished a lifelong fantasy: he'd wanted it for so long, and imagined it, shaded and choreographed it in his mind, when he saw Harry all pink and panting after a Quidditch game, eyes shining with adrenaline, or when he'd catch him studying in the library with the most utterly bored look on his face, and find himself barely resisting the urge to crawl under the damn table and give him the distraction he was so obviously hoping for, or when he came down to the Great Hall in the morning with his eyes half-squinted, his hair untidy and his tie hanging from his shoulders, and Draco wanted more than anything to take him back to bed… It was so much of what he'd dreamt of, but warmer, softer,
'Merlin, if I'd known this is what happens when I'm nice, then I'd have been your best friend by second year.'
‘You plan to murder me, Weasley?’ he said. He began surveying the grounds for the Snitch again.
Harry was actually focusing on the game.
The students stifled their laughs in the crooks of their elbows and the backs of their hands. Pansy, always one for subtlety, kicked him under the table, then smiled sweetly when he faced her with a glare.
leave?’
Harry cut him off with a firm kiss, pushing him against the door. Draco’s back snapped against the wood, his hands fell instantly to Harry’s hips - and his lip had healed, and he could kiss
He was going to ask Harry whether he rathered getting blowjobs or giving them. He was going to ask it, because he
‘I see that,’ Harry snorted, so utterly nonchalant. Granger hadn’t told him, then. Yes, it was all fine. He just had to excuse himself and leave. ‘Are you alright? Were you ill? Absinthe is wretched to keep in the first time.’
‘Lovegood’s raven was good.’
‘Not at all, though-’
They left in a fit with Dean and Alicia hurrying behind them. The rest of them moved to the living area. Some squeezed into the ragged peach sofa; Ginny took an armchair; Harry and Neville hopped onto a sturdy table; Draco, who hadn’t wanted to intrude in case there was an ordinary sitting arrangement, and Fletchley sat on the nasty rug, leaning against the coffee table.
‘Wait,’ piped up Sue. ‘You didn’t fuck, or you
‘You know, I won’t tell. I don’t care what you twats do,’ he shrugged, ‘I just think watching it might be entertaining. Besides, when your plan goes to shit, which it inevitably will, it might do you good to have a clear head with you.’
Harry laughed. A ghost woman hovered past them in a frenzy, hips swaying in pale static as she neared her friend. He followed her with his gaze, then let it scan the entire hall, the strange formality of it, the decrepit decorations and moth-eaten curtains. When he looked back at Draco, he seemed thoughtful.
He suspected the moment might mean more to him than Harry, even though it would be Harry’s first time. Harry moaned regardless, eyelids fluttering like he could envision even a fraction of Draco’s fantasy.
‘You know, the last time you had that kind of thought process you pushed me off my bloody broom,’ he said. ‘Trust me, I’ll be alright.’
Draco went, biting his lip to keep from saying something entirely too inappropriate and
‘Why?’
it, and Draco was drunk on his every moan and small thrust onto his tongue, and he pushed in as much as he could until his jaw was numb, a proper rimjob to make him see how could good it could be, how good Draco could make it, everyday if he wanted it, if he let him.
‘Why there?’
Once more, Harry tried to shrug. The movement came out stunted, his broken arm barely moving under the covers - it seemed to irritate him, a groove digging in between his eyebrows.
There was a beat of silence - in which Draco had to pin Harry’s hand to the mattress, because the git had no shred of self-control - before they heard Ron shout back:
‘No. Actually, I’d like some beer as well.’
He knew, and the alcohol had surely made him overly sentimental, because he couldn’t bear the thought of Potter not getting them.
Oof, alright, I apologize for the brief angst with the argument between Ron and Draco, but I wanted Draco's past to be fully addressed so we could all get closure.
Draco wondered if he himself looked quite so noticeably drunk.
Draco.'
nice,' Harry panted against his mouth, and Draco, whose mind had short-circuited as he tried to pull Harry as close as possible, took entirely too long to remember what they were talking about. When he did, he let out a surprised laugh.
Harry, which Draco couldn’t even hate him for, because Harry was frustratingly attractive and a brilliant Quidditch player and a better person and the only bloody human whose silences were
Sue snorted, bottle dangling from her fingers. ‘Why do
‘What, do we have to be married first or something?’ Harry smirked, already flattening himself against one side of the mattress. ‘Come here, you look about to fall over.’
'Fuck, Malfoy,' Harry breathed, trying not to buck his hips and further the careful stimulation, 'Will you fucking- go faster, will you?'
‘Do you plan on telling me exactly why you’re so crossed?’
, just- more people. Just tell your team to clear off.’
‘I’m sorry, were you under the impression I was talking to you?’
‘Don’t be curious, Draco, it never ends anywhere. Here, share a butterbeer with me.’
deal of self-control.
‘Well? Go on, mate, bleachers, or you’ll get in the way,’ said Harper, ushering him away with a dismissive hand.
'Draco' Harry called, his voice much smaller than it'd been before. 'Come here.'
‘Something strong before we go, I reckon.’

Draco felt close to collapsing.
'The lipstick was your bloody idea.'
Content.
'Are we all here, then?' came Ron's voice, 'Malfoy, finally, did you fall in the fucking loo?'

Harry huffed a laugh.
‘Harry,’ Draco sighed, ‘Could you possibly,
‘D’you remember what you said, when I asked you about this scar?’ Harry traced a light finger over Draco’s middle, ‘Of course I resent you. It’s a bloody big scar.’

to,' Pansy rolled her eyes, 'There was no need to pester him as much as you did.'
‘No offense, but we don’t give you that much thought,’ Seamus shrugged. ‘You coming?’
, entirely and hopefully - Merlin, Draco hoped - for a very, very long time. So long that a mortal would call it forever. He could do that now:
He wandered back to the conversation, finding Harry’s gaze still on him expectantly.
Because time had never been in their favour. They'd always been furtive, rushed, with an impending sense of urgency. And now there was a soft bed for Harry to writhe on, covers under Draco's knees while he hovered over him, and a room all to themselves with thick walls and a suitably locked door. So Draco took one of Harry's nipples into his mouth, the left one so he could hopefully feel his heartbeat kicking up, and sucked the little nub without mercy, persistent but lazy, set to unravel Harry like he'd never had the chance to do before, slow and gradual and with a level of care bordering on
‘Brilliant excuse.’
‘You kicked me out the the bloody infirmary!’
Harry huffed. ‘You didn’t apologize to Hermione. You told me you fucking would, Malfoy. I didn’t even think you were coming tonight.’
The bartender finally caught her eye, and she ordered some wizard’s brew. ‘Do you want anything?’
‘Is he alright?’
Harry attempted a shrug. His smile was a tired, lopsided thing.
‘What happened to you?’
‘Alright,’ Harry slurred the word, looking at Draco like he was some strange, incomprehensible creature. ‘And why the fuck do you want Luna’s lipstick?’
'I don't think I like some of your friends,' Harry mused once they reached the deserted dungeon corridor. The ghostly symphony was but a faint murmuring in the back of their ears.
'I'm gonna head back in,' Potter shuffled between his feet, staring at Draco in that little amused way of his, 'Will you join me, or are you going to stay here and freeze?'
'Alright, then,' Harry gave a little wave, wavered a little where he stood, then held onto the railing with one firmly decided expression.
People went beet red again. It was entertaining to watch, and Draco prided himself in not having to drink this round - unless Harry fucking Potter qualified as a fetish, he’d been pretty straightforward with the few partners he’d had. Not having to drink made it easier to take in the people who
'Are you suggesting I get better company?'
be serious about it.’
‘Not long,’ Harry replied, casual, light, his hand lingering on Draco's neck.
For a long time, Draco repeated this thoughtline to himself, leaning against the sticky door and willing his pulse to slow and his breaths to steady. The lanky Hufflepuff gave one unimpressive groan, then left with a loud snapping of the door shut; the guy in the other stall gathered himself and left as well. Some stumbling pair barricaded itself in the stall adjacent to his and made out against the wall dividing their stalls, which was particularly awkward and only gave Draco the sort of ideas he was most trying to ignore at that moment. The people around him changed, footsteps coming by ever so often, the sound of a faucet running or a stall door opening and closing, the beats of the music outside muffled and entrancing. He was calmer, after a while, and the plan he’d been reciting in a patient, if somewhat desperate monologue was finally starting to sound appealing, and he finally left the stall. He had to find the man who’d checked him at the door and retrieve his coat before he could leave and put that dreaded night past him.
'I was looking for the commons,' Ron waved the bottle around aimlessly. 'He found me.'
Harry snorted. 'Since I found you here in the bathroom, basically.'
He wondered how exactly did relationships begin. Did they stem from some clean confession, like Draco’s when they’d been under the effect of Alihotsy, which had been so bittersweetly discarded? Did they turn so quickly into open kisses and implicit commitment? Were they meant to be this foggy?
‘Are you planning on kneeling then, Potter?’
, from kissing him?
Fletchley laughed. ‘Ingenious place to hide the alcohol.’
Like he didn’t have a place in Harry’s life.
‘Forget that.’
'Pansy, Merlin, stop talking.'
the time in the world, you know?' Harry mused.
indeed fucked.
‘No. No, I think I’d rather stay in tonight.’
been a stupid question, really - Harry and his friends hadn’t spent a Friday night at Hogwarts since the year had started.
Harry was only tipsy that night - that was the first one. He’d told Draco that they should do it again. Kiss again, fuck again, Draco didn’t care for the specifics. That was fact number two. Ron knew. He’d seen it and looked properly disapproving and ran off. Harry hadn’t cared: he’d kissed him despite it. Numbers three and four, respectively.
‘She was, wasn’t she? Funny, seeing as she wasn’t even there that night.’
Hermione rolled her eyes dismissively, like his words were entirely meaningless.
‘Do you?’ Harry asked, just as hushed, meeting his gaze.
Harry gave him a sly smile, and they headed towards the exit. They didn't get very far - Blaise, the inconvenient pest he was, quickly intercepted them.
‘As long as you don’t do it in front of us,’ said Ron, and the impatient tone he’d used - for he looked in all aspects like he wanted to turn around and bolt - brought an air of finality to the whole thing. A moment of curiosity, shameless prodding and ogling eyes. Over now. The faces by the door dispersed, their voices gave way to gentle music once more, and Draco and Harry were not quite alone but mostly forgotten.
‘Am I supposed to know what on earth you mean by that?’
‘Worked out for everyone, then,’ Draco smirked before dipping his hand down to search Harry’s crotch. ‘You hard, Potter? Want me to take care of it?’
Harry regarded him for a slow moment.
‘What is it?’
The symphonies blurred together without pause, long crescendos and the thrumming of strings in their ears lulling them into a wordless rhythm. It was Harry who, after a while, broke the strange spell with a mild complaint of his feet hurting. They walked out to the edge of the dance floor, their fingers still entwined. Luna followed them out.
Harry shrugged. ‘If I have one, I’ll come find you.’
‘It’s not my fucking fault. This stuff you’re drinking is pure alcohol, Potter,’ he waved the bottle around as if it’d offended him. Harry was looking dreadfully smug. ‘Was I in the common room when you and Ron broke in?’
. How did he keep from laughing whenever he saw Harry, when he was shaken mute and breathless with the urge to touch? Crippling love. A joke.
Draco’s heart seized. His lungs kicked every inch of oxygen out, and in this state, breathless, with no blood in his extremities, with the taunting sound of Harry’s bones breaking in his ears - and Harry was going to
‘Not on the lips, no.’
But perhaps it would be temporary. There’d been genuine want in Harry’s eyes that night, hadn’t it? Draco’s memory was a fickle thing, too twisted by a life’s worth of dreams to be properly trustworthy, but he’d
The tower was also never truly silent: there was the incessant ticking of hidden clocks - inexistent clocks, perhaps, but there nonetheless; the whispers of the wind as it whizzed through the cracks and eroded the old, porous blocks of stone. A little soundtrack composed of nothings which played a slow rhythm in the back of Draco's mind as he settled down under the window's archway, intent on studying some advanced formulas for the manipulation of potion scents. It quickly proved fruitless, however, even in the melancholic calm the space evoked; each phrase and diagram served only as a reminder of that day at the start of the year where Potter had sauntered past him, the
‘Come on, Malfoy, what do you say? Brave enough to steal it, but not to drink it?’ Harry drawled, and it was that tone, so reminiscent - fucking identical - to the one with which he’d called Draco
His voice was ragged - Draco
Ron smiled in pure relief, then promptly dragged himself back to a corner, laying his head over his arms on one of the desks. He stayed like that for the rest of the class.
Draco could hardly contain the bitterness in his gaze:
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Potter shrug:
Not that it'd ever happen.
Maybe Draco could ask him.
speaking to Draco. At all. And it wasn’t like Draco was entirely shut out: there were other conversations, with Neville for example, whose irises were glistening an eerie red and gold, or those fools Thomas and Finnigan, who had both charmed their skin half of each Gryffindor colour, or Luna, whom he genuinely liked. But every conversation where Harry was involved seemed to swim away from him. He’d take a sip of his drink for courage, intervene with something small and attentive, and Harry wouldn’t quite look at him, nor draw those smiles, and he’d find himself feeling rejected for no explicit reason. He could still feel his warmth and hear him talk and feel his body shake against his with laughter, but he felt distant nonetheless.
‘She’s really nice,’ Pike supplied. He sounded absent as he watched Blaise’s work.
At least that granted him Harry’s full attention.
'Yes, I got it.'
‘What d’you do last night?’
‘You haven’t. You ought to show it better.’
'We ought to stop doing this in places where we can get interrupted,' he said, catching Harry by the arm to pull him against his chest.
He walked right up to them, in the Great Hall no less, by the bustling Gryffindor table, touched Harry’s arm and spoke:
‘I dress up for everyone, dear,' Pansy replied. ‘Don’t wear that shirt. Colours make you bland.’
'I won't. She wouldn't care.'
‘Give me a minute, you go on ahead.’
Harry laughed. ‘Really? D’you do it often?’
'I can take pain.'
‘Tutoring from the best in Potions, huh?’ Harry hummed, irresistibly close, that teasing smirk in his lips - lips still slick with stray droplets of spit and come, still raw red and swollen, so bloody beautiful Draco could feel heat pool at his stomach again.
There was a pulse of silence, during which Draco was content watching Harry mesh the different shades in uncoordinated tries, and suppressing the insane urge to offer to properly help, to feel the thin skin of Harry’s eyelids under his fingers. Then, the bathroom door slammed open - a high-pitched laugh, a squeal, a groan from a lower voice; the door slammed shut equally as loudly, and a mess of entwined limbs and clashing lips stumbled through the bathroom. The couple ran into the middle stall, paying them no mind, and locked themselves inside with a hysterical fit of laughter.
Draco wasted no time in following him, though his place was slower, more measured. Far, out the corner of his eye, he could see three silhouettes in the stands - Granger, Finnigan and Longbottom, still in the first row, now leaning against the railing, avidly following the game.
and Harry was the most reckless little thing, moaning in abandon, no precaution, no

Draco raised his brows expectantly.
Harry didn’t falter at Draco’s unfriendly tone. His teeth were clenched resolutely, and he huffed in frustration. 'Why’d you do it, Malfoy?’
But Harry and Luna only laughed and came down themselves to join them in the dungeon hall. Harry stepped towards him, shifting his weight between his feet, a crooked,
'I think so, yes.'

'They made us promise we'd be here. Said it was only fair that we all suffered,' Hermione explained, a huff of annoyance in the end. Draco, on his part, could barely stand to look at her without remembering that little corner in the pub, the thoughtless words that had come out of his mouth, Hermione's expression when she'd
Draco nodded absently, his gaze falling on the row of girls waiting in line. Some were throwing glimpses their way, and Draco
‘You think I’m ashamed of you.’
When Draco finally managed to catch up to him, his voice was a wild and furious rough sound.
‘Having a shot without me, are you?’ Potter said as he neared the group. His arms were wrapped around himself, and Draco was suddenly aware that it was cold inside the pub, the stone walls and dim lighting making it feel almost hostile, and why did no one offer him a fucking jacket?
Harry's smile went utterly warm at that, and his fingers trailed down Draco's arms almost temptatively.
For an eighteen years old, Draco thought he was doing rather fine.
'That black silk shirt, I think. You look quite dashing in it.'
‘Can’t keep up,
Harry hissed when he finally got a hand around himself. Draco’s own erection was sliding in dizzying friction against Harry’s shirt.
‘Just…’ he gestured vaguely at his eyes. Draco took a few steps closer to the mirror. ‘Do they look the same? At all?’
‘Was it?’ Draco smiled. When Harry nodded, he kissed him softly on the lips. ‘Harry?’
‘Twat,’ Harry huffed, but he still kissed him goodbye as he left, and Draco still watched him go with the fondest, most hopelessly lovesick look the Great Hall had ever seen.
'Then it's decided. We're going to Hogsmeade next week.'
‘Are you going to shadow me for the entire game, Malfoy?’
Harry quirked a brow impatiently. ‘What do you want to ask, then?’
And so, Draco pressed his back against the glass, letting himself be swept into a world of measurements and technique. Behind him, snow began to fall, swaying slowly in the air, painting the window white.
just like the rest of them.
She smirked, because she knew the effect that would have on him - that the idea that Potter had agreed to wait for him, even after parting ways inside the pub on such a cold note, would fucking

Nonetheless, he hopped up from bed, creeping down the stairs. He jumped when the bell rang a few more times, walking faster down the remaining stairs. He peeked out the window by the front door, eyes going wide in shock.

Suddenly, a bushy brown-haired girl stepped in the way of Draco’s aggressive stride. He raised an eyebrow at her, moving to walk around her. She followed, standing her ground. Draco sighed, knowing this must be important.
The dark-skinned girl squealed in delight, hugging Draco happily, "I’m so proud of you!” Draco blushed, though he couldn’t help but smile.
Sure enough, he heard a faint “
Harry sat in the library in freshman year, a place he had begun to visit months before, somewhere he could go to get away from everything. He always liked reading since he was a child; the idea of being able to visit an imaginary place in his mind was fascinating to him. His parents made it all possible, raising him to the best of their ability after his biological mother left him on their doorstep.
"Okay, cut the shit, Drake. Tell us what's wrong," Pansy snapped, before adding at Hermione's look, "please."

“I guess it’s about time I told you… Over a year and a half ago, I met a boy named Blaise through mutual friends. We clicked instantly and soon grew inseparable. After a few months, I had realized my feelings for him, as he did for me. Naturally, he asked me out and I said yes. We became that gross couple that did everything and anything together. We were happy. I, for once, felt the happiest I had been in a long time.”
to go. Something was wrong and he knew it. He snatched up a random jacket from the end of his bed, which happened to be one of Harry’s hoodies he’d brought over.
“Draco.”
The blonde leaned on the car door, tucking a strand of loose hair back into place, “I had fun tonight.”
“Before I tell you this,” Draco started, hesitating, “promise me you won’t laugh.”
Draco was close to sobbing now, clutching the soft fabric of Harry’s shirt in his fist, his tears slowly drenching it, “H-He got angry, p-probably the w-worst I’d ever seen him. I t-tried to s-stop him from leaving, b-begged him, s-saying we could m-make it work. H-He th-threw me o-out of the w-way, into the w-wall.

“Anyways, enough about me. Come on. I want to take you somewhere.”

“Wait.” He said, standing from the bed and stalking up to the latter with purpose. Draco reached a hand to cup the back of his head, crushing their mouths together in a hard kiss. Harry moaned in surprise, wrapping his arms around the blonde’s back and pulling him closer. Draco nibbled at Harry’s bottom lip, taking it between his teeth before reattaching their lips. Draco slipped his tongue past the latter’s lips, quick to explore his warm mouth. Harry growled lowly, thoroughly enjoying his treatment. The blonde pulled away abruptly, a string of spit hanging between their mouths in aftermath. Harry’s eyes opened to see his boyfriend still standing there, a cheeky smile on his swollen, red lips. Draco removed his hands, stepping away from Harry to let him leave. “Bye. I love you.”
"Scared, Malfoy?" Hermione teased, though he knew she was joking. He nodded, not feeling up to giving his usual retort. The girls shared a worried look again; something was terribly wrong. Even on his worst days he'd at least give them a curt 'fuck off,' "I was joking."

Draco buried his head deeper into his pillow, wrapping his large comforter tighter around his body. One of his kittens, Tiberius, hopped up onto the bed, his small paws quietly pattering across the soft sheets. He paused in front of Draco’s face, mewling and pawing at the blonde’s nose. Draco allowed himself a small smile, ruffling the thick white fur on its back; his cats always knew when he was feeling sad. He sighed, content leaving his body just as quick as it came.
“No, but-”

Draco chuckled lightly, though he still wasn’t in the mood, “On top of that, we skipped first period together,”
Draco’s face turned a red that put tomatoes to shame, “Y-Yeah, of course.”
“He hasn’t answered any of my calls or texts,” Harry said, “I figured he was sick or something, so I let him be for a few days. But now I’m worried about him.”
“I missed you.” Draco mumbled softly, sniffling. He didn’t realize the extent of that statement until he was right there in his arms. “A lot.”
Pansy smirked smugly, hugging him back and burying her head in his shoulder, her smirk turning into a frown of worry, “I know.”
At the same time, Draco couldn’t help but wonder what Harry saw in him; he could have almost anyone else, so why him? His personality consists of sarcasm and sardonic humor, used as a façade to better hide his true screwed up self that no one bothered to help him fix. He had a below-average build, no outstanding or attractive features to be seen. So why?
“I mean,” Draco breathed out, “that I agreed to try.”

“I told him about his new date.” Hermione answered for him, wiggling her dark eyebrows.
Later came sooner than he hoped, his two best friends practically demanding answers. Scratch that, they were demanding. Judging by their tones, they clearly noticed Blaise was back and that he was hot on his trail. Draco fought with himself internally over whether he should tell them the whole truth; not only is it dangerous, but

“Shut up.”
"Will you be my boyfriend?"
Though he’d rather be hung by his boxers on the flagpole in front of the school than to admit this, Draco knew he was head-over-heels for the stupid Potter boy.
“-Mother called, yes.” Draco cut her off matter-of-factly, earning an eye roll from the dark-haired girl; whenever his mother sensed something wrong with him, she called Pansy immediately, as she knew Draco would never tell her. “Why?”
"Hey,” Harry replied, smiling brightly. He watched as Draco adamantly shooed his mother from the door; she left with an
. He still had about two hours before school started for the day, but he knew he wasn't getting back to sleep.
“Is…that okay?” Harry asked hesitantly. He was silently begging the blonde to ask him to stay home, though he knew Draco was too nice for that.
"Good." The bushy-haired girl smiled, grabbing both of their hands, pulling them along. "Now. Let's go get ice cream and cry over sad romance movies."
Though she knew it wasn't up for debate, Pansy rolled her eyes with a short nod, amusement decorating her cheeks.
Draco flinched at the alcohol on his breath, but said nothing. He figured Harry would understand. They stood quietly, less than a foot apart, for a few moments before Draco spoke again. “Well, I should get going…”
“Do you have any better ideas?”
“Have any ideas yet?”
On cue, said boy walked in, surrounded by his guy friends, a few giggling girls trailing close behind. Draco couldn't help but stare. Something was different about him. He wasn't talking much and was adamantly searching the room, most likely for someone. Harry's eyes soon found Draco's, emerald green on blue-gray. Both boys felt a jolt go through their bodies, as if they were electrocuted. Draco jumped, quickly dropping his eyes to his desk and pretending to be writing something down, his face heating up in a bright red flush. Draco sighed, knowing he made himself look like some creep.
Draco sighed, “We were sitting next to each other on the sand, and naturally I was thinking too much for my own good…so I asked if he thought of his soulmate…” The memory resurfaced vividly, as if he were still there on that beach.
Draco chuckled lightly, sniffling, “I hate how understanding you are. It makes me feel bad.”
Just as the man at the front of the room began to call of names, a knock sounded at the door. Quirrell grumbled, standing to reprimand whichever late student it was. Draco felt nauseous; he knew he couldn't put it past him to match their schedules as best as possible. He avoided eye contact with his deep brown eyes as the boy stopped at his desk.
Draco’s inner-voice in added. This only made his already extreme nervousness worse.
but Harry somehow still had this effect on him, “And I do you. I’m fine with… ‘coming out’ as long as you are.”
Truth is, Draco couldn’t stop thinking about Harry. More specifically, the kisses he’s shared with him. It felt right in the moment, so why is he regretting it now?
He could feel him boring holes into the back of his head, but he ignored it, paying his full attention to the lesson before him.

It was times like this that he felt jealous of them; they had it
playlist:
“Just…please.” Harry started, slowly backing away. “Leave me alone from now on.”
"Uh-huh," Pansy deadpanned, letting the topic drop, knowing Draco wouldn't answer. Draco sighed in relief, delving back into his thoughts of the night to come.
playlist:
"Draco, please-"
Luckily, the music remained unbothered, still flowing out from underneath the second door on his right. He soon reached the top of the stairs, moving towards the door in anticipation. Harry rapped his knuckles on the door lightly, hoping it was loud enough for the boy inside to hear.
"I just can't do it. He probably thinks I'm some creep."
“You told him without me? Damn, I wanted to see his reaction.” Pansy pouted, earning a glare from Draco and an apologetic kiss on the cheek from Hermione.

The sound of a car horn startled him from his thoughts, his head automatically turning towards the source. He brushed it off as a random student before recognition flooded his mind. The blonde looked around cautiously, before walking over to the compact car. He pulled open the car door and sat himself in the passenger seat, shutting the door behind him.
Draco sighed, knowing exactly what the ‘beginning’ entails. He removed his laptop from his lap, closing it and placing it on the floor beside the bed. Draco moved to take his glasses, but stopped at the sound of Harry's voice,
Lucius swung so fast Draco didn't see it coming, but he felt it. Everything was slow-moving, his vision blurry but for the sight of his father still standing there. The impact left him delirious as he let his head drop to the carpet, though he didn't remember getting there. His left cheek stung, something trickled down it. He lifted a hand and tentatively touched the spot, pulling it away to find a blotch of red; blood. His father adjusted the ring on his left ring finger, which was now lightly tinged with red.
Harry sighed again, his heart clenching at the sadness in Draco's voice, "Yeah, of course."
After their second date, the simplest things were followed by an “I love you.” May it be in between classes, or their goodbyes after school, they never failed to remind each other of their love. Maybe it was a little excessive, but they just wanted to relinquish in their relationship for as long as possible. Pansy mock-gagged over the excessiveness of it all, while Hermione would coo over the romance, reminiscing over the times when she and her girlfriend acted the exact same. But they didn’t care, as long as both boys were happy.
Draco closed his mouth in a mock-pout, chewing indignantly, “You’re lucky these are my favorite.”
Pansy made a noise in her throat of a mix between a squeal and a snort,  sitting up in surprise, “Draco! That’s great!”
“I’m willing to try, though.” Draco blurted out.

Pansy bent over in an obnoxious cackle, those around her looking at her in surprise or disgust. Hermione let out a small giggle, though she was used to this. Draco ducked his head in embarrassment.
“Do you know where Draco’s been?” Harry blurted, scratching his head subconsciously.
Draco felt his eyes burn with tears as he ran from the hall blindly, hoping desperately to find his way out.
Harry turned back towards the ginger, pushing him as hard as he could into the wall opposite, Ron seemingly sobering up on impact. “You fucking asshole! Why the fuck would you do that?!”
I need out. Let me out.
"What's got you all smiley, Harry?" his red-headed friend, Ron Weasley, asked. Harry shrugged, his smile brightening as he thought about Draco again.
They frowned at that, including Hermione who was listening quietly by her girlfriend's side. She furrowed her eyebrows, silently brainstorming all of the possibilities that could come out of the boy's mouth. She slowly found it only worried her more than it did help, shaking her head to clear her thoughts. Hermione began to understand Pansy's frustration, though it's hard to tell when she doesn't express it.
Pansy was becoming frustrated with him at his lack of explanation, telling by the way she was gripping his hand. Hermione was quick to grab her free one in attempt to console her. The black-haired girl took a deep breath and nodded at her girlfriend.
Harry looked at him in confusion; you could practically see the gears turning slowly in his head, making Draco feel guilty.
He sighed, heading for bathroom. Draco didn't usually shower in the mornings, but he figured he could use one. He turned the water on, stripping himself of his clothing. The room quickly filled with steam, oddly giving him a sense of comfort. The blonde stepped in the tub, leaning his head against the wall to let the water course down his back.
