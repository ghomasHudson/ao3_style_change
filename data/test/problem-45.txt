"We simply need to come to an agreement," Bones countered diplomatically. "If we can show the Prime Minister that suspicions around certain ingredients are unfounded, I'm sure—"
After Draco hung his cloak on a cloak rack, where it instantly disappeared, he made his way into the ballroom. The terrace doors were open, soft violin music drifting in along with the crisp, cool autumn air. The guests had wide smiles, most giving the area appreciative looks, and everyone seemed clearly comfortable (probably more so than they would admit) to be surrounded by pure magic and nothing industrial or Muggle whatsoever.
want this potion to succeed. Belby confessed he figured that because Sorcerian Malfoy was involved in the creation, those most likely to protest would be forced into silence or allow it simply because he was Sorcerian Malfoy. That if nothing else, because of his involvement, no one would believe the potion to be as life-changing as it was sure to be, not until it was too late to stop it.
Draco was able to grab and finish a drink before a soft chiming warned everyone the courses were about to begin. Lucius took the head of the table a few chairs down from Draco with Narcissa to his right. The Minister of Magic sat on the other end, looking pompous indeed.
Regulus gave a soft smile, and Draco had to squint again to make sure he was seeing properly. The stiff, regal Sorcerian Warlock Master Sir Regulus Black, Magician of Witchcraft and Wizardry that he was so used to was gone, and in front of him was indeed the Regs he remembered. His body language was more relaxed, his face significantly more open, and although his eyes were just as sharp and cool as ever, they looked more receptive rather than calculating. The last Draco saw of this kind of Regulus was the last vacation they shared in Scotland before Regulus was officially inducted into the Sorcery and Royal Court as one of their main epistocratic chairs.
The amount of history Draco had been forced to study over the judicial side of things was dizzying to think about still today. However, he did understand, probably more than most, where the Muggles were coming from. He had seen, up close and personal, just how
There was very little cause for pretence currently, Draco thought. They both knew exactly why Draco had been invited over, exactly where any conversation would lead, and the reasoning behind all of it. He would really rather just not bother, but as he himself wasn't quite sure how the inevitable conversation would result, he supposed he would just have to trek through it. His top priority was not declaring himself one way or another; not in opinion, not in politics, not in beliefs.
Whoever they were, Harry loved the grandparent who wrote this one. It was exactly what he needed. Hopefully it could answer his most pressing questions clearly, with no roundabout explanations that only Hermione could understand, thank you very much. Speaking of Hermione, he figured it would be a good idea to tell her about the books. They would probably get through them faster if Hermione knew, even if Harry was the one who could actually read most of the books in the chest.
“It was…...well, I think they are going somewhere. One of them was a general I think. He didn't want to give any details. I don’t remember a whole lot,” he scratched his head in frustration.
“Where was I? Oh! Mr. Dumbledore will be taking the pleasure of telling Dad about our departure and telling the ministry with Mr. Weasley about your change in guardianship. Mr. Lupin will be your new guardian with my mom. And once we get to the manor we'll meet up with Granger, the Weasley family and Madame McGonagall. Then we'll decide where to go from there. The letter I sent to Charlie was telling him that we were ready to go through with the plan and finalize everything. Hedwig will come to you, I think Saturday afternoon, with confirmation from Charlie and Mr. Dumbledore.”
As he placed the plates on the table Uncle Vernon comes stomping in and stares at him with his beady black eyes as if he was seeing some kind of disgusting bug, "You will NOT be getting any dinner today! If you cannot follow simple instructions why should I spend any money on a FILTHY ORPHAN LIKE YOU?! Make sure you stay in the kitchen boy, you need to be taught a lesson about gratitude."
“I nominate the High General to take lead of this mission, and to take along three more comrades with you” Tassarion met Enáretos’ eyes as he spoke for the first time.
As you may have noticed there were a few new words in there as I was writing this chapter I was struck with the idea to give time variables there own vocab in Aitherios. And Voltron fans yep that's where i got the inspiration so here they are
(meaning: Air crystal) to let the commander know of the happening, and as he talks to guard about what he must tell their protector, he realizes for the first time since the change in stars, the reality: The new royals have been chosen and the evil, the monstrous devil's evil, would be returning. Soon Aitherios would be facing danger, but this danger would not come without the kingdoms most powerful Guardians: The New Royal Line.
sister here: I beat her up for you guys, so don't worry. If you still wanna harm her. I give you full permission. BYE. ENJOY!
“I agree with Tassarion as well. There is no other suited to lead this mission more than you Enáretos” Ralael adds.
P.S. They don't learn about Aitherios till much later into the story. So I humbly request your patience  :)
Reason 2: My account was suspended for a like a month and halfish I think. This was because I posted a work looking for a fic and that's against the terms and conditions. But I've seen a few people do it so my stupid brain was like lets do it too!! and then I got suspended. SO just a reminder to you guys as well don't put up posts searching for fics because after 3 warnings your account may be deactivated.
“She was taught that the moment I placed her in my service, why do you think she’s a rumor in the wind General?”
He watched with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension as Enaretos made his way to the observatory, praying to all gods to give him strength to face the terrifying satyress who seemed more like a impenetrable fortress than the warm head healer to him.
“Ralael, dear friend, this argument is already many centuries old” Anagnostis comments as he enters to take his seat. He looked exhausted, as if he had trekked the most treacherous swamps and mountains in Aitherios.
Just shy of midnight, Anagnóstis notices a sudden change in the stars that were normally calm. He notices the stars starting to dance with each other, their light mixing and fading, crossing each other as if they were doing a váls itself. Their colors changing and just...happiness presenting itself within the stars of the night sky. But the moment the clock strikes twelve, the stars shrivel, as if in fear, and the sky is filled with the moon shining brightly along with the red stars gathering together. Anagnóstis gasps, his glitter gray eyes widening as he watches the stars play a story of disaster and prosperity. In his four hundred seventy-five years of age, he has never before seen such a display by the stars.
We are getting closer to the main charcters getting to know about AItherios and it will happen in the next few chapters. You will have to pardon me about Draco and Harry, their relationship is yet to begin. But once they make contact things will pick up at a much faster rate.
Harry burst into Hermione's room, the door slamming into the wall with a sharp bang, jolting her awake, “ ‘Mione you have to wake up!” exclaimed Harry, dragging her out of bed.
There was a lot that happened over the last two years in my university career that pushed me to focus my energy on school for the most part. Therefore I cannot apologize enough to the community of wonderful readers that have taken an interest in this story, especially for leaving you alone for a long period of time. With the terrible situation of COVID 19 I am exclusively at home due to online class implementation. Hence my return. I have few chapters that will go up for you wonderful readers in the next few weeks. I will not promise update dates since its a horrible crime to not keep a promise and I am clearly wonderful at committing this particular one. What I can say is that compared to the last 2 years there will be a few frequent updates in the upcoming weeks.
“Xaliv! Good to see you as well, and yes, I bring wonderful news, but the actual witness of this will be delayed a few hours. Till he arrives let us deal with other matters.”
“I understand Sir, also now that it is confirmed that both you and the pointy overachiever is departing are the plans for mission Naldievix in effect?”
at the legion headquarters after you have picked your troops. I wish to know who will accompany on this mission. I shall await your call.”
To the right of Anagnostis' empty chair, sat the Arch Satyr, Tassarion and the seer, Xaliv. Tassarion was expressionless as he surveyed the room. His horns fully grown and curved at the end, small ears covered under his unruly brown hair, eyes cold and calculating, he emitted a rather intimidating aura.
“Yes young one, another world, and please do not interrupt while I am disclosing such important information” Xaliv shrinks from the stern stare directed at him, embarrassed at the reproach.
“Yes Ruegalic, there is much I must attend to and we must not waste even a second. Let us move quickly” Enáretos declares as he mounts Ruegalic, who takes flight, hooves thundering and wings spread, catching the night wind as they make their exit.
The Satyr seer walks out of the Lair with a slightly disdained expression and welcomes them with an unimpressed smile.
“Of course young Arch. Now, from what I saw that night, the stars have told me that our young rulers are in another world”
It had been a few weeks since Harry and the Evan's had moved into the Potter Manor, but he had yet to finish exploring. He had underestimated the sheer size of the Manor. It seemed his little forays around his new home would continue for much longer than he expected. Madam Pompfrey had already made a few stops to give the Evans’ a general check up. She’d also kindly treated Harry for his injuries.
To save my readers (if i have any left the trouble of checking every morning (i know there's those who do and people, i KNOW the pain), check every Wednesday and Friday. If i do update, it will be on those two days. The next chapter will be on AItherios, don't worry, we haven't forgotten about our world.
The seat right next to Enáretos was occupied by a member named Bladefeed. His rather small stature called for his seat to be set a slight bit higher than the others, to ensure that he could maintain eye contact while engaging in conversation. Bladefeed was the Goblin representative of the few who were serving Aitherios. They were responsible for protecting most of the Royal family’s treasures and important scrolls and books. As he was quite an old fellow, his white goatee and hair was what caused most races to respect him before getting to know him as the chieftain of the goblins.
Noticing the sudden quietness and lack of wind rushing next to him, Enaretos slowly dropped his arms from his face to see Talian staring him apprehensively.
Because of the tragedy that fell upon the ruling family, the High Table had to make sure that the world did not fall into complete chaos, and that the clans didn't see this misfortune as an opportunity to start any kind of animosity between each other. They have made sure that the Kalardr be reported as soon as they are sighted. They also generously offered their men for proper combat training in order to have better means of defense to keep the creatures at bay.
Nueleth chuckles softly at the remark and rises, welcoming Anagnostis as she speaks to the table with innocent authority, “We must discuss the prophecy and discuss the methods in which to find and bring our rulers to the palace. Star reader, if you could inform us of the details and the location where our rulers are residing currently, we can start with that as our basis.”
“Well! Why didn’t you tell me so in the first place?” exclaimed Talian brightly, a smile replacing the murderous expression she had, “Come come, I know just the person.”
Talian is a four foot eight inch satyress and has been head healer of the legion infirmary from the time before the royal slaughter. She had known Enaretos even longer. But above all, she had terrified the Fae General from her mother's womb itself. Now she was finally going to tear him apart.
Harry gave her one last smile before shutting her door and heading down the hallway to his own quarters. One thing he noticed about the manor was that even after a startling dream or a nightmare, the walls and the general atmosphere of the Potter manor never felt hostile. Instead it was warm and light, almost as if it were comforting him and reassuring both Harry and his magic that they were safe within these walls. This was something that Harry rarely experienced. Even at Hogwarts he seldom felt this way, no thanks to Mr. I-have-a-fancy-acronym-Voldy chasing after him each year. This was a welcome change. Most of his summer seemed to be a welcome change.
After getting the necessary vials for his headaches, he made his way to the Scholar’s Veil to recruit the scholar he had in mind. He needed to meet with the scholar soon so that Enaretos would be able to join the goblin for dinner. It was proper tradition and etiquette.
Ralael's seer was his own son, who developed his powers at a young age and improved rapidly. Father and son could pass for twins except for Shael's hair which was a beautiful midnight blue unlike his father's cyan hair. Although both were lavender-eyed, Ralael's eyes were filled with wisdom accumulated over the long years, while Shael's eyes shone bright with the promise of youth and possibility.
Harry closed his eyes and for the first time this summer, he sleep tight with no nightmares, even with the pain from the bruises.
“You just want me to dig you out of trouble don’t you? That’s why your mood changed so fast and you have that awful smirk on your furry face right.”
“You did not inform us of your return and you have been making visits, which seem to be incomplete, seeing as you are headed in the direction of the Scholar’s Veil.” answered Gryn.
Enáretos was riding the winds of Aitherios with his companion Ruegalic, the Pegasus. It was an important trip in his lifetime, perhaps one that would give him some peace and comfort. As the High General, he commanded his world's forces with pride and dignity, even after the slaughter of the former Royal line. Furthermore, yesterday night, his good friend had given him news so great, he felt his will to protect the world renew just like a dying flame catching onto dry wood.
mused Enáretos. The arrogant seer’s horns were half grown and his small ears were out for the world to see. His hair……seemed to be slicked back using Onros knows what.
His companion Ruegalic gives a deep laugh and shakes his sapphire blue feathers in a way that it almost seems like he shivered. “
“I had a dream, and I heard two people talking. I could almost see them but I don’t remember anymore. Their appearances are hazy to me for some reason. But I knew that I had seen the building they were in. I saw it in a picture in that book! I went back to the library and found it…... And that picture, those people were
As Enaretos made his made his way to the infirmary, he dreaded asking Talian for one of her healers. He could swear a hundred times that the woman would genuinely go back on her healer oath than let him borrow a healer and walk out unscathed.
“Didn’t I give the two of you orders a couple of minutes ago, shouldn’t you already be on your way?” leered Enaretos at his First and Second.
This was a hard chapter to write mainly because I'm world building as I go and have to constantly go back t the old chapters. We have a put a lot of care and effort into writing this piece and it is an important chapter with some underlying character developments and personalities. One of my favorite characters are in here as well.
his thoughts ran rampant, until he no longer had the energy to keep thinking. Sleep engulfed him and for the first time since he was a child, Harry truly just slept, knowing no harm would come to him in the embrace of his new home.
Ruegalic the pegasus is Enaretos bonded familiar, but this does not mean he is treated as a pet. Rugalic is sassy and all sorts of wonder, he has his own character and freedom.
“Please, I cannot say anything except that it will help end the war for good!” He swore he felt a strand of his hair sliced as he rolled away from two more scalpels (
“She has solved some of the hardest treatment plans and also assisted me in my standalone operations. She was the only one I have seen that was capable of doing so and the only help I trust when working alone.”
“Yes, it is Gryn and change both your expressions right now both of you!! Naldievix was a honorable hero that served our world well.” expressed Enaretos with a face that said that he would not expect any other description on this ‘Naldievix’ person.
His seer Flinar, on the other hand, was the opposite of his race's nature. His face, though soft and angular like all sylphs, was hardened as if he had seen too many horrors for his immortal life. His eyes and hair, the color of the deep blue ocean, he emitted a formidable aura. He gazed at the High General serenely, his long front hair moving gently from a subtle night breeze.
“Asdern, you will be coming with me to the human world along with three others. I need you to start checking the perimeters of the legion, the city and our borders. Implement any extra precaution that will help the guarding protocols stand strong even with our absence.”
Maybe these aren’t Draco’s scones.  Harry turns towards the pantry and repeats the spell.  It is, to all appearances, a pantry with foods under a stasis spell.
“Of course not.  Don’t be ridiculous, Potter.  But who else could it be?  It’s a simple deduction, even for you.”  Malfoy sneers, but his heart clearly isn’t into it.  Malfoy’s eyes are darting around the room.  He looks trapped, and he’s breathing too fast.
Off to the side of the room, there are two chairs in the kitchen with a small table between them.  Harry sits, crossing his legs in front of him.
“Maybe we weren’t, but this girl certainly is,” Hermione says.  “And that’s not even the worst of it.  A third-year Slytherin boy went to Madame Pomfrey’s for…” she trails off.
Harry’s heart seizes.  What is Malfoy doing?  Just giving up?  The victory tastes sour and Harry cries out, ‘Malfoy, wait!”
Harry wears his invisibility cloak, even though Draco isn’t here.  Currently, Draco is alone in the Slytherin showers.  It’s a weird time to shower, mid-morning.  Harry is supposed to be in Transfigurations right now, himself, but he has a hard time going to classes.  He wanders a lot during the day, trying to find a place to be comfortable.  Today was a ‘wandering with a purpose’ day.  A ‘keeping Hogwarts safe’ day.  Not a ‘weirdly stalking Draco day,’ regardless of what Hermione says.
"The same as always," Draco lied, giving the petite journalist a knowing smile. "It can always get heated when what's on the dock incites passionate reactions, but in the end, everyone puts their differences aside in order to rule fairly."
His mother was usually the first to host galas during the season, and she always did the bulk of the ones involving education. The Manor's Floo Hall opened down the corridor from their own gallery, which opened to a large ballroom with a terrace to the gardens. The ballroom itself was two floors, the first floor having a larger gallery and a very large balcony that overlooked the gardens. It was there that the food would be served, but plates full of hors d'oeuvres and drinks still dutifully floated around the ground floor where guests were beginning to settle in. The decorations were elegant with soft cream colours, and the muffled voices of conversation humming pleasantly off the marble floors.
"Three." Nott granted him a small nod. "I take it that this award marks the end of this most recent academic stint?"
"Three," Draco bristled. He had only earned three. It was true, however, that his advancements in the art of potion-making practically made him a Master. In fact, as much as he studied and brewed with Sorcerian Master Snape, he
Most guests were slowly making their way up the marble stairs, and Draco quickly made his way up, pausing only now and then when he was effectively cornered by someone. The first to corner him was, of course, Sorcerian Slughorn who still to that day kept attempting to wrangle Draco into accepting some kind of apprenticeship with him. The next was Minister Fudge, who was singing praises of Draco's father's work this year in the courts. Then there was Sorcerian Karkaroff who had a nasty habit of attempting to get Draco to agree to meet with him privately, and finally, Sorcerian Crouch Jr who had an increasingly crazed look in his eye each time Draco saw him.
Draco tried his best not to look surprised. "Again, some issues incite passionate reactions, but I have yet to see any issue that couldn't be ruled on amicably."
was the deconstruction of light. Healing magic, for another example, was the construction from damaged molecules, and curses were generally the deconstruction of healthy molecules.
A chill crawled up Draco's spine because he knew definitively that Nott's actual meaning was the opposite.
. He was already well known by the time Draco was grown, and Draco had had to watch in horror as he grew in influence. Not many people knew he was behind Minister Fudge's policies and the decisions his administration made. Fudge was nothing more than a fool, a puppet, a stooge. No, Riddle was behind the current administration, breeding in frankly old-fashion and all-around ignorant ideals, and Draco was genuinely sad it was working.
, but that he would only ever admit to himself. No, in public, when he was called to weigh in, he was, indeed, neutral. As most were.
"Because your magic is bound by our laws," she persisted. "Without our laws, your kind could do anything you wanted."
old," Draco groaned, rolling his eyes. It should have been worrisome he could fall so readily into the ease they used to communicate. Instead, it was a relief.
Being a Sorcerian and a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, Draco by law had rights to cast three epistocracy votes a year. That was, of course, in Royal Court, where Muggles and magicians together ruled on issues. In the Sorcery Court, Draco had an outstanding seat and unlimited votes. For the first three years, he had actually enjoyed it. For the last seven, now, he had convenient academic trips, experiments, or emergencies whenever the Sorcery Court voted on anything more serious than the regulations of cauldrons.
He enjoyed the gardens anyway. They were, of course, always altered and decorated for these events, but even in the day-to-day, Narcissa Malfoy loved her gardens. Fairy lights twinkled over the most colourful of flowers, and the large bushes were cut to depict either famous or magisterially obscure magician statues. The gardens probably had his second favourite smell outside his labs.
With Snape's antisocial lack-of-contribution, Regulus usual crypticness, and Bones' jovial willingness for whichever subject was brought up, the rest of the courses went smoothly, and Draco found himself remembering why some of these things could be enjoyable. The food had exotic themes while not being too adventurous, and the taste met his mother's usual demand for excellence. They finished with the dessert that was some kind of flaming pudding, the last of the palette cleansers being passed around as the pudding was reduced to embers.
Luckily, Bones immediately picked up on that change of subject, and Draco happily followed along. He didn't miss, however, Snape's cold glare or Regulus' calculating one.
Muggles were flourishing, however, in areas no one could have predicted. Hell, the current Muggle administration had even removed all sodomy laws. His father's face when that news reached them was priceless, making Draco quietly celebrate with the Muggles.
"Which is stirring further unrest in the Royal Court. As you know, Sorcerians do not need court approval to perform any kind of magic, as is their blood right. The Muggles feel it is a mistake to allow any kind of magic to go unsanctioned and unmonitored any longer, and the idea that a Sorcerian can create mind-potions in secret is…"
"Yes, thank you." Draco paused to sip his soup, thinking of the best way to answer her question. "I've moved a bit more into practical research these days. Academic research will always be my lady-love, but I do enjoy the break from theory into application on occasion."
Yes, Sorcerian Draco Malfoy had the utmost confidence in their respective governments and their leaders, and he gave his full support to the administrations that worked so tirelessly for their people. "Our governments have to make hard decisions day after day, and while some might not be popular, I know they have our best interests at heart."
"No, not at all. If the court genuinely feels that is the best course of action, I, of course, will stand with them proudly."
He immediately chastised himself for allowing such a nervous-tell to show, having spoken between constant sips. The abolishment, as always, sounded like his father's voice. He had mostly been successful getting that voice out of his head, but at moments like these, when he was forced into the company of the members of the Court, that voice grew stronger. This was another reason to stay away, he had adamantly defended in the past, ignoring suggestions from Sorcerian Master Snape that perhaps exposure would be better.
Staring carefully at the cover of the book, he noticed that the script was not in English. Actually he wasn’t sure what language it was, but strangely enough, he could understand it.
Zuleru looks around the room and speaks, “We must not frighten them once they are found. We must provide them with the knowledge of our world and politics and train them in Magic and combat, should they not have any knowledge in such matters. They will be entering a world embroiled in war…....They will be
“How are you sure that the stars entailed that particular meaning if you’ve never even seen it?” Xaliv blurts out, unable to contain himself.
Sighing at the boy’s lack of patience, Anagnostis glances at him with disapproval, “I would advise you to
“Of course, of course Dudley. Ask your mother to take out the bird from the freaks bedroom after dinner, but make sure he stays out my way son.”
“Fine!!!” growled Enaretos, prompting a full blown smile to bloom on her face.  He turned to the dragon, “Iktix was it? Are you knowledgeable with all creatures and races along with their life developments?”
Huge thanks to my sister who is my wonderful Beta reader and alarm clock for the writing deadlines!!
“Well then, I believe this meeting has adjourned until further notice” Anagnostis says, pushing his chair back and standing up.
He already had an idea of who else he needed. Asdern was somewhat familiar with the ways of healing, but they would need a highly skilled and properly practiced healer in the troupe. They would also need a scholar to ensure the royal family is educated in Aitherian ways and have some knowledge about the political propaganda at the time of their arrival. Hopefully such knowledge will allow them to secure an edge over the ambitious noble families.
keen to learn. There is a shortage of healers as it is and the war spares no one. She was much too valuable to let go.” explained Talian earnestly, trying to make him understand.
Slipping away from the others from time to time, it had taken Harry a while to look through the manor. It was quite the adventurous journey if he said so himself. He’d discovered (read he got lost and stumbled upon it) a large garden in the back of the Manor on his first departure. He had also found two large libraries, one apparently for the guests and another one exclusively for the Potter family, to Hermione’s absolute delight.
“Thank you and uh..have a pleasant day.” He replied and spared a smile at the young apprentice healer in his urgency.
She turned to face him unhurriedly and he could slowly but surely feel something rising within the room.
“Luther's right. We cannot expect the dragons and the dragon shifters to aid us on the front lines, Ralael. Their race remains neutral even though they provide us with supplies and information.”
Her seer, Luther, was a Dragon of principles. The horns on either side of his forehead displayed the guardianship and loyalty he had to Nueleth. Luther's eyes, a mix of brilliant yellow and green, were haunting to meet and promised death if crossed. At an impressive height, Luther towered over Avaren himself.
I do not have a surplus of healers to just give away here and there and they are much too valuable for me to let you
“ I understand Lian, I understand! Spare me!!” He shrieked as another came flying at him, barely missing his robe this time.
“Anagnostis foresaw it.” He stated firmly, pulling the scalpel out of his robe and rising to his feet as the satyr shoved the drawer in and made her way to him, arms open amicably.
Said chosen one had spent his days being zoomed through lessons on etiquette, history, law and a bunch of wizarding related courses he couldn’t be bothered to keep track of. Of course, he and the Weasely’s staged escapes enough times to take Petunia and Dudley around Diagon Alley, the Burrow and even demonstrate a small Quidditch game. A furious Mrs.Weasley had stormed out armed with a pan and sent them all to pluck the weeds and dust every corner possible.
“And….you want someone who has the highest skills but remains hidden and unknown to most if not all? Am I getting every one of your demands right so far?” she asked with a blank face.
It's a double chapter update to make up for my days of laziness and guys!! Draco's finally here! The man has arrived!! In the next chapter tho. But again, I am really sorry about the whole ghost author business. I didn't mean to. But human nature has a way with me.....sorry.
After speaking to Ralael about what happened to him in the human world, both of them decided that it would be best to get the troop together before next dawn. Enaretos had already decided that his first would accompany him, now he just had to find three others to accompany him. On second thought, he only had to find two others, Bladefeed would be sending one of his people as discussed at the High Table meeting. He had contacted the chief in advance to make sure the representative was well on his way, and received the good news that they would be arriving at the capital by dusk today.
“And this is why she is your perfect candidate. Nobody knows she is here and nobody can ever know. But I can guarantee she is much better than any healer I know, even me…..and she needs to disappear.” Talian faced Enaretos with that sly, dumb smirk of hers.
Chapter 09 will be up within the week and some special people will be introduced to you. Look forward to it.
Aitherios has had no contact with the Human world at all. Those who fled found out through contacts that were serving higher ranks. Only those trusted few have proper knowledge of it ex-High Table(even they don't know much)
Comments, Kudos, Questions and Constructive criticism is always adored so please don't be shy.I just wanted to let you know that i have started a blog dedicated to Aitherios so we can converse and have more updated on how the fic is coming along. The link is below:
Talian released her aura to lightly touch the heavy white doors, urging them to make way. As they gradually opened for them, Enaretos found not an unoccupied garden but rather an occupied one. He could only see their back and Enaretos slowly reached for his sword, stopping when he felt Talian’s hand on his arm calming his movement. Waiting for the doors to close, Talian called out to the person, “Iktix dear, would you come over here?”
“The mistress is observing an operation at the moment. If you would like to join her, the observatory is on the ninth floor General.”
He gazes upon the clouds of the setting sun that act as a camouflage to the entrance of the Sky Lair, which holds residence to the High Table. The thirteen members of the High Table consisted of each magical folks' chieftains, their most knowledgeable seers, a goblin, and one royal seer. They were responsible for their clans and the happenings that occurred within; the chieftains have been taking care of all conflict and battle plans along with the Royal legion and navy, for the past few hundred years.
Enaretos startled hearing the name, whipping his head to face the head healer so fast he could've been one of her flying scalpels, “Talian why do you have a dragon shifter working for you?!” he hissed at her under his breath. Suddenly, her words of not having extra wounds than necessary in a war made sense, “This is dangerous, what you are doing Lian!”
“Then I propose that the General first cross the portal, and return to pick his comrades afterwards. That way we can be prepared to a certain extent when entering. We won’t be going in blind and I am sure the High General is more than capable of coming back alive, should he be faced with trouble on his scouting” Flinar comments.
Sighing, he opened the door to his chambers, immediately slipping back under the covers and sinking into the pillows. The satin sheets and the mattress was just the right amount of softness. Harry settled in and spent a few minutes setting up his occlumency shields before he let his thoughts take over.
Iktix grinned at the General and answered, “General I am a healer. And not just any healer, I am a dragon healer. I know more than a normal healer would learn and practice. I have also had the joy of reading some ancient healing books, so I am very well versed in my field. With all due respect, you can spare such worries General.”
“I will ‘Mione. Thank you. I’m sorry for waking you up” he apologized sheepishly but Hermione smiled, rolling her eyes.
“I have sharper hearing than any of you General, it does no good to whisper under your breath with me present in your vicinity.” The dragon shifter smiled at him, now standing in front of them.
He listened to her closely as she described the recruit and was pleased that she seemed to be a ‘ghost’ but capable. Although why one healer would cause more damage in the war, he didn't quite understand.
The Arch Sylph Avaren, had a large broad grin on his calm face; he was a gentle creature. Being a sylph, it was in his nature, but he was a creature with a strong sense of justice and unwavering loyalty to whomever he deemed genuine and worthy of his trust. Avaren was a man with a soft angular jaw; his eyes were the brightest light blue color ever seen on a sylph. It matched the blue ends of his long white hair. Naturally, as a sylph, his body structure was small but it was lean and cut. Anyone could sense that it was a body hardened by battles and endless control of magic.
Malfoy finds a piece of parchment from somewhere.  Harry creeps closer to look over Malfoy’s shoulder.
Harry knows it’s something wrong.  Before Harry can knock it away, Hermione takes it from Malfoy and Harry wakes up screaming.
The room next to the kitchen has a small door set deep into the stone.  Harry isn’t sure what he expects, but it definitely isn’t a small kitchen.
Some instinct must triggers in Malfoy because he looks sharply into the empty room.  Malfoy is still, and Harry thinks of prey animals, quivering before predators.
Malfoy’s muttering to himself, no, humming to himself.  He walks into the pantry and grabs an enormous evil book.  How had Harry missed that before?  Probably a concealment charm.  That bastard.
Instead, Harry’s treated to the most bizarre scene.  Malfoy just… bakes.  He’s meticulous about it, careful.  He looks almost how he looks in potions, only now his face is almost relaxed.
Something in Harry settles.  Yes.  This is right.  Draco snapping and Harry defensive, the air crackling between them.  Something is finally normal.
Malfoy’s all elegant lines and pale, pale coloring.  His eyelashes are thick and black and fringe eyes the color of a winter storm, grey and troubled.  He’s pale, of course, and fine blue veins rise out of surprisingly strong-looking wrists.  Malfoy will never be a big man, but he’s filled out over the summer, his shoulders broadening.  He looks less like the sneering boy and more like… someone else.  Someone Harry doesn’t know.
“Tcch '' He clicked his tongue, observing the blood dripping down his thumb. Swiping at the blood to take a look at the wound, Harry noticed that there was no wound. Brows furrowing he stared at his thumb, bewildered, when he heard the padlock click.
“Look into the preparations for the goblin representative’s welcome and brief the soldiers and the lieutenants. Take care not to provide too much information about the events taking place. I could sense their overwhelming desire to bury me with questions, do not give in to any of them. Excessive curiosity will only work towards our disadvantage if any unnecessary trouble picks up on valuable information.”
“Our rulers are in another world. More specifically, the Human world. Now, there are two reasons for this: The first is that when the stars started dancing, the lights faded in and out which tells us that the rulers are from another world. This is an extremely rare occurrence, one that I never knew I would witness with my own eyes.”
two hours before dawn, not a minute later, is that understood? Both of you?” demanded Enaretos with a hard voice, expression one of steel.
with us, no less in the LEGION infirmary, there will be dire consequences. I am sorry but I need to let the Chief know Lian. There is no more I can do for you.”
To Zuleru's left sat the two dragon shifters. Their Archiean was the only other female. Nueleth was the epitome of strength, even though she looked like she would shatter from the simplest push. Her misleading appearance gave her an advantage in both battle and social meetings. Her golden Dragon eyes showed innocence, but when in court or battle, they glinted dangerously with an eerie glow that seemed to paint the surroundings with crimson red blood. The Arch's fiery red hair was as always let down, glowing around her as if it would harm anyone who got close enough.
answers. School starts in two weeks and I won’t be able to focus on anything,” he scowled, tired of not knowing.
“Yeah except that he was a tiny little tree branch brought to life by the Fae healers and thought that he was the bachelor that could seduce the King’s two year old daughter.” This only caused Asdern to choke by trying to hold in his laughter and caused Enaretos to stop and just glare at Gryn.
Sensing his distress, Hermione slipped her hand into his, giving it a comforting squeeze, “I’ll send an owl to McGonagall, she should get back to us in a day or so. In the meantime, you should go back to sleep Harry. It’s almost morning, we all need rest. Make sure to occlude. We don’t want anyone slipping into your mind. Not with what you know now.”
As the kingdom's and Royal family's official star reader, Anagnóstis sees in front of his eyes, a prophecy that has only been written in history books, come alive. He calls upon the Faun guard through the
Orfeo= evil asshole minion who has power over kalardr and is like a lieutenant. Went on a seer hunt and spilled the blood of many seers. Remembered with terror and fear.
“Get out of my room Harry,” she said playfully, “I would give you a hug but those are for Mrs. Weasley.”
“I’ve already packed sir, I also have some healing kits as well,” a proud smile formed on Asdern’s face, “I read some books on the human world from the scholar library the past few nupas in preparation. I hope my efforts won’t go wasted.”
He pulled out the padlock from its hook and slowly opened the chest. Magic seemed to amaze him and annoy him simultaneously. There were more books inside, but these seemed different to the rest of the books lying on the shelves of the library. For one, they were not at all worn out, which was weird. The paper was different, the binding was different and when he lifted one, it was definitely a lot lighter than expected.
“I will contact you in two weeks time” Enáretos leaves with a bow and makes haste till he meets Ruegalic outside.
I should die a painfull and tortuous death I know. My sister, your beloved editor is in the current process of skinning me alive so fear not i am being punished. But finally here it is a chapter. Enjoy!!!!
“Mate, you really worry too much, but I'll tell you anyway. I talked to your Headmaster, well, more like wrote a letter to him. Told him that blood wards or no blood-wards, if you stayed one more summer here, you were gonna die before the madman got to you. And I asked him if the ward was only linked to my mom and not the house. Well I didn't think that up, Charlie's brother Bill did”
Bladefeed raises his hand, “I recommend you take a goblin and make it four comrades. The human world, to my knowledge, has a vast amount of goblins residing and working within it. I am very certain that you will encounter magic that can only be dealt with by a goblin.”
The courtyard behind the garden harbors the entrance to the Sky Lair: an archway that appears to be made of glass but in reality, is formed out of frozen air, much like the
“Anyway, turns out in theory, because my mom has the same blood as your mother, the ward is just that, a blood-ward. It's not connected to the house and that means as long as my mom's near you, they can't find you. And I'm really betting everything on this theory right now for your sake.” he explained.
“Well...with you this is nothing new, just higher stakes” he muttered, heaving a sigh, even though anyone could spot the fond look in his eyes, “I will see you tomorrow, be safe on your journey.” he said, knocking their foreheads gently together in their own parting gesture. He still remembered when she first banged her head against his when they were younger, so hard he
As went down the stairs to the kitchen Harry sees Dudley sitting at the round table in front of the TV, finishing his letter to Charlie Weasley. Their friendship was a shocker for him. Harry would think that Dudley would be friends with Fred and George, considering their ability to accept anyone who has good intentions despite a bad past. But it was Charlie that Dudley found a friend in, maybe because he's a Dragon trainer back in Romania and he deals with creatures that are “vastly misunderstood” as Hagrid says. As Harry started on dinner, which for today would be roasted salmon with a side of boiled vegetables, Dudley lets me know that Hedwig would be returning with a reply in a few days instead of the usual week, as Charlie was also visiting The Burrow for the summer.
Asdern grinned at his commander and also turned to head towards the perimeters on the west end, “No need to get touchy Sir.”
Enaretos thanked the gods while following her out of the office, but did not forget to question her sanity (in his head of course, he didn't need her scalpels thrown at him again).
The journalist pressed forward, clearly not willing to let it go, but Draco took the opportunity of a new wave of Muggles coming back through the balcony doors to make his exit.
Centuries ago, the Muggles won the war, but by a stroke of unprecedented empathy, they did not attempt to stomp magical people out of existence. Instead, they forged a treaty, so they could live in peace.
"I see," Nott hummed. He stared at Draco for another moment, assessing, then turned back to look out the window. "Until next time, then. Good day, Sorcerian Malfoy."
He had successfully been distracting himself for seven months now with his work with Belby. They had made some great strides, and for the first time since starting the project, Draco was beginning to realise that they stood a real chance at creating something that could change lycanthropy as the world knew it. It was literally ground-breaking, and it terrified him.
Draco Malfoy, the youngest in the Sorcery Malfoy family of the Royal Sorcery Court, sat in an elaborate drawing room, unimpressed. Theodore Nott, of the Sorcery Nott family of the Royal Sorcery Court, sat across from him, probably equally unimpressed but far more practised at concealing it.
It felt like an eternity before he was able to pull himself away and go to the Floo hall where he Flooed to, no surprise, Malfoy Manor.
"But you admit that it is possible? That this kind of magic is possible, and magicians are capable of it?"
There were times Draco couldn't even bring himself to say the name Riddle, but it was better than thinking of him as
"And he was right. Those were declined, but these are the exact same, just renamed and rebranded to sound less malicious and more helpful to both the inflicted and the nation."
Draco stood studying his new installation of iceboxes for about five minutes before he realised he was distracting himself from his original distraction.
It worked and had been working for a very long time. Draco just couldn't understand why it seemed to be failing now. Sure, there were people like Nott and his father who were part of the government and directly behind the winds of the climate, but surely, not even they… well, surely, Nott would not wish half of what was resulting.
"How are your studies, Sorcerian Malfoy?" Nott opened. He said this as politely as anything, but his lip curled slightly at the word 'studies'.
"Ah, Sorcerian Malfoy," said a voice to his left. Draco turned and saw Sorcerian Bones, and he felt himself relax further. Bones wasn't his favourite person, but she was probably the fairest member of the courts and always willing to talk about subjects other than politics.
As political tensions kept rising, and more and more people were going missing or straight-out being killed, as protests in other countries were being met with brute and fatal force, and rights of citizens and immigrants alike kept being systematically stripped away, Draco's silence and neutrality were beginning to become a problem for both sides. After all, he was Sorcerian Draco Malfoy, the sole heir to the Malfoy bloodline. He could go to a party for five minutes and end up in all the papers, particularly in the society pages. Any speech he gave, which were mostly academic speeches and lectures, ended up on the front page. As an elite Socrcerian, he was, for all intents and purposes, as close to actual royalty a magician could get without actually being a
Wadpey shifted nervously. He knew she knew he was joking, but Dobby was the only elf that seemed to know how to handle when he did.
Nott didn't answer at first, his back perfectly straight where it faced Draco. Then, his voice back to that perfected political-polite balance, "Times are indeed changing. The Muggles are becoming more progressive each year." He turned his head slightly to regard Draco over his shoulder. "We must, of course, remain neutral."
Draco's carriage arrived to double lines of Muggle coppers holding back the yelling journalists and flashing photographers. He ignored them as he made his way inside, but inside, he had to do a circuit to pay his respects to the location and actually talk to members of the press who somehow earned a special pass.
Draco could honestly say he didn't agree with most of the values or beliefs he grew up in, nor did he agree with Slytherin politics. In fact, most of his opinions sided more often than not with
Sorcerian Draco Malfoy continued to give his apologies, but, with a charming chuckle, "I don't discuss my private life; besides, there are so many more things worthwhile to speak of tonight than whom I may or may not be dating."
"Well, this has been a lovely visit," he said with a smile, setting his empty cup on the table and standing. "As I had warned, I can't stay for long. I'm afraid I must be off."
Nott narrowed his eyes. "Perhaps, but you are always wanted. Last year, you barely cast your three allotted votes."
"I can understand that. I imagine it keeps you quite busy. This is why we haven't seen you in the courts this year?"
"I imagine that makes it challenging for you, Sorcerian Malfoy," Bones said, clearly trying to include him.
It was thoughts like that which reminded him just how comfortable burying one's head into the sand really could be.
Draco suppressed a wince, feeling his father's eyes on him from down the table. He made sure to lower his voice under the pretence of blowing politely on his next spoonful of soup. "I've tried to keep up, but there's only so much my head can hold these days."
If he had the mind to, he could play a critical role in having the harbouring of Muggle refugees by magicians, the Goldsteins' crime, illegal and punishable to the greatest extent in both courts.
Yes, Sorcerian Draco Malfoy was still heavy in academia and research, and he believed education, in particular, was the cornerstone for good politics and charitable communities. "I began my education as a humble sorcery apprentice, and now I lecture at prominent universities and have assisted to make several breakthroughs in health and healing magic. With education, anything is possible."
"Altogether, yes, I suppose. But the Sorcery Court has also heard rumours that it may be feasible for a potion to allow a lycanthropian to keep their mind during the full moon."
. Many were angry that the Muggles had constricted and regulated so much of their magic, forcing magicians to follow laws that bound their capacity and their very nature, only to turn around and create sudo-magic of their own while conveniently not breaking any established restrictions magicians had.
As the guests made their way downstairs and the music turned into something more upbeat and dance-worthy, Draco made sure to stop by his parents. He shook his father's hand and kissed his mother's cheek, complimenting them on the turn out and the excellent food and decoration. His mother welcomed him as she always did, and his father merely commented that he was surprised Draco could get away—telling Draco in his own way just how angry he was in Draco's continued absence.
He lived in London, just a hair away from Canary Wharf in a magician district, in his own townhouse. He had converted the entire basement to be a potions lab, and while he didn't have the room to be as well-stocked as his work lab, his stock was far more precise to his needs and held a collection of rare ingredients. The whole lab had a permanent scent of goosegrass and cottonwood, from both his brewing and his attempt to rid the room of some of the more unpleasant side effects from mistakes. Or, with some particularly nasty potions, from successes.
Draco took a steadying breath as he leaned back to allow Bones and his very own cousin, Regulus Black, to talk.
Nott abruptly stood and strolled toward his large townhouse windows. They were in London, and from outside Draco could hear the low rumble of the public, a few shouts of merchants, the clomps of horses and whooshes of the carriages they pulled. Draco idly wondered after the sky, it's standard city-grey making it almost impossible to tell if it would rain or not.
"What is that you're working on these days?" She asked to continue the conversation as the washbowls were replaced with soup. "And congratulations on the latest award. It was for burn-salve, correct?"
“You can get back to work for now my dear, and when I return we can start packing.” She offered Iktix a kind smile and led Enaretos out, the doors closing behind them to protect a secret so dangerous to all their lives.
Asdern and Gryn both hid their snickers behind their hands that clearly indicated that they disagreed with their commanding officer. This was further proven by Gryn snorting.
“When my dad leaves for his meeting early next Tuesday, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Lupin and Mr. Dumbledore will be coming here. Mr. Weasley will be dealing with your residence change and luggage transportation, Mr. Lupin will take us to our new residence, apparently your dad has a manor Harry. Here, sit up straight so I can wrap this around your ribs.” I turn towards him and sit up, still trying to wrap my head around what he's telling me.
It was relatively calming to gaze upon smiles and glowing faces after seeing centuries of weary faces, worn down by constant battles. It seemed the difference was due to the main topic of the day, a topic that brought hope and the possibility of a better world. “Unfortunately, Anagnostis will be delayed. While we await his presence, let us go over the defense plans.”
“Zuleru, I do not understand the female specimen that is my mate nor do I understand why I still have my sanity when I have been bonded to her for the last three centuries.”
SHOUTOUT to my Little Sister (JUST ASKED MY SISTER HOW TO SPELL LITTLE, I CAN"T- ) who pushed me to write the chapters and then painstakingly edited them for me. I LOVE HER and you should THANK her for the chapters mostly.
I AM SO SORRY ABOUT BEING MIA!!! SCHOOL WAS HORRIBLE, HAD A WRITERS BLOCK SO THIS IS AN APOLOGY AND A CHRISTMAS PRESENT. *BOWS DEEPLY* *KOW TOWS* *GIVES U THE PUPPY EYES*
Talian glared at him from across the room, and he felt the room temperature start to drop. She walked over to her tool drawer leisurely, and slowly opened it, the sound of wood sliding  painfully drawn out and causing every hair on him to stand at attention. Enaretos was observing her on high alert and cautiously moved his own hand closer to his left thigh where his dagger resided.
The pair walked back to Talian’s office in such tense silence that whoever encountered them, lowered their heads and didn't glance at them or speak a word till they passed. Once they reached the office, Enaretos immediately made sure that there were strong wards and barriers safeguarding their conversation as he had done when he first entered the room earlier.
Harry pulled a lagging Hermione upright and pushed her over to the chair in front of the desk. It was almost as if she was a puppet. Once he was sure that she was a good amount of coherent, the life returning to her bright eyes, he slammed the book down in front of her triumphantly. With the chapter on the Scholar’s Veil wide open, he rushed to explain his night's tryst.
Ruegalic starts to dip his body down as he says this and Enáretos looks up to see the Sky Lair in the distance. The beauty of the Lair was only second to the Royal Palace and the Seed tree. The majestic structure was hidden among clouds of light pink and purple hues, its garden of floating flowers and crystallized water being the first thing to appear before them. The three towers catch the attention of the guest immediately, the main reason being the massive two horned dragons perched on the right and left towers, winds spread and bodies alert. The middle tower stands the tallest and has the mighty Griffin standing guard, hidden inside it, ready to leap out at the slightest hint of danger.
“That is why I gave her to you. I trust you to take care of everybody.” she said placing a hand on his shoulder, a genuine smile making its way along her lips as she looked at him with such certainty.
is. The archway is adorned with beautiful, ethereal carvings portraying harmony among the races and the world's other inhabitants. At the doorway to the entrance stand two faun guards. The walls behind them hold statues of past chieftains and seers who have done more than consult, who have displayed enormous bravery by leading the most courageous of soldiers and engaging in the most fiercest of battles. The statues are of the most loyal and spirited subjects to have ever sat at the High Table.
Ruegalic the pegasus has a telepathic bond with Enaretos to communicate. They are bonded Partners. There will be more info about bonded animals later into the story.
The Arch Fae Ralael, was as always, clothed in dark colors of nature. Even the glow around him itself, was a dark green. Strangely enough, his eyes were an unnatural lavender. His ears were long and so pointed that it seemed sharp enough to prick one's finger on if touched. His cyan hair was tied in a small knot at the top of his head while the rest fell like a waterfall, against his back.
The General stared long and hard at Iktix, almost evaluating her through sight alone. Finally, he sighed and turned to leave, “Talian bring her to Ruegalic’s stable two hours before dawn tomorrow, packed for warmth, healing and make sure she knows how to mist and stay in the shadows.”
That night after Vernon had gone to sleep, Harry let Dudley into his room with some medicine to apply on the bruises and cuts. While Dudley applied the healing salve on his shoulders Harry asked about what he had written to Charlie in the letter.
He was anxious to recruit members with unquestionable skills, the dangers were high and he would prefer to minimize the risk of harm.
“Ha..rry..” groaned Hermione, barely opening her eyes, voice thick with sleep, “What are you doing?? It’s the middle of the night..!”
Reason 1: I am going through a writers block for the second half of the chapter therefore what you guys are getting to read is the first half as the moment. I am having some trouble describe the Scholar's veil appearance and the characteristics of the scholar in the team. SO heads up if there is an update after this chapter is posted is because I am updating this chapter with the second half.
“End the war for good? Are you sure?” She asked, her furry brows furrowing as she placed the scalpel back in the drawer.
The book beneath it though had an English Title and appeared to be fairly newer with the familiar English binding and all. To his surprise, the title was pretty straightforward as well.
The pair arrived at one of the infirmary’s very own herb gardens. This particular room only allowed entrance to the head healer. As herbs were the main ingredient in nearly all the potions, slaves and other medicines, the important and volatile herbs that could be manipulated for different reasons and required careful growth, were under the head healer's care.
I apologise for the late update. School started this week so it took awhile to get the chapter edited.
His seer, one of the only two females who sat at the High Table, was one of the oldest seers he has known. Zuleru was the only seer who escaped from the bastard Orfeo, when he hunted the seers. Her eyes were both difficult and comfortable to look at. Great pain and great joy could be seen in her silver eyes. Her blonde hair was put up in a tight ponytail at the top of her head and her ears, though shorter than Valoweith's, were no less pointed. Her ear clasp was an intricate design of periwinkle and yellow buttercups. She had nothing but serene smiles to offer at the table today.
“Yes, of course. Everybody else has arrived, let us make haste” Xaliv replies as he turns haughtily to lead the way to the High Table.
“Harry” Hermione gasped with realization, hand frantically tapping the small table in front of her, “Harry, maybe you were actually there! Maybe your astral body went to this place!”
“So please just one healer!” He yelped, raising his arms to protect himself from any more flying medical death weapons.
Talian lowered the next scalpel she had readied at the mention of the war, watching Enaretos collapse onto the floor. Stupid robe. She had warned him to be careful with that flimsy thing. Served him right for ignoring her words.
there. The picture looks exactly like my dream! This place exists Hermione! I think, contrary to what great grandfather believed, Aitherios might still be there. I don't think it was destroyed!”
Excited, he grabbed the first two books leaving the chest in the protective care of the private library it was housed in, and carried them to his room. He carefully set one down next to his bed before settling down comfortably with the book for the descendents. Filled with anticipation, he turned to Chapter 1, eyes moving over the words with wonder.
The Arch Elven, Valoweith, has always worn a look of pride on his face, no matter the circumstances. Enáretos was starting to think that the Arch’s face was just frozen, either that or his facial muscles didn’t know how to form any other expressions. Valoweith has always looked the part of a perfect elf, with silver eyes, pointed ears and beautiful platinum blonde hair. He had braided it today and it now lay falling in front of his shoulder. His broad shoulders didn't interfere with the height that gave the grace and elegance only an elf could have. The Elven mark of leadership was shown by the prominent golden rune adorning his forehead.
Asking the apprentice at the front for some vials on his way out would be the fastest, even if the young thing stared at him far too much. This way he didn't have to come back here soon. Although he could not come back even if he wanted to, not without making progress.
like a flipping KNIFE ENA!!!!!” she thundered, launching the scalpel at him with all her indignation and wrath. It flew at him, cutting through the air, a flash of silver with startling accuracy for one thrown by a healer.
“I'll be down soon Aunt Petunia”, he replied as he got up while holding his tender ribs and grimacing when he put pressure on his swollen ankle. At least he could feel his ankle now, thanks to Dudleys' tape that was wrapped around his ankle for the better part of the day.
Enaretos chuckled and tilted his head slightly in Gryn’s direction, “Don’t forget to breathe when you speak Gryn, but you are right. I have been busy and it was good on your part to have seeked me out. I have jobs for you.”
As he walked in through the calming green doors of the infirmary, he was greeted by the soldiers on guard duty, the injured and the other healers. He walked up to the reception and asked the apprentice for the head healer Talian.
“I knew this year was gonna get worse, each year you come back and-” he paused, composing himself before speaking again, “but I'm a god forsaken coward you know that Harry, but last summer when I read the letter from Charlie and Ron about you being forced to face that mad man, I just …. I knew I had to get you out and I…... I told myself to grow a backbone and I did.” Harry couldn't believe his ears, Dudley Dursley telling the 'boy-who-lived' that he was gonna save him while applying healing salve.
if they were from this world, the star’s lights would have brightened while they danced. The second reason is when the war started, and our former rulers were slaughtered, many of our races fled this world for the safety of themselves or their children. Most of them escaped to the human world through a dangerous portal.”
It was almost as if someone purposely made the chest appear plain and ‘normal’ to the normal person’s eye. But the intricate crafting taken to the wood had clearly been embedded with creature magic connecting to his own. His fingers reached for the padlock that appeared to have no keyhole,  when all of a sudden, Harry felt a sharp pain in his thumb.
“But, Avaren, we cannot continue to expend more sylphs. Your kind are brave and swift in the air, however, they are also our greatest and most talented healers. We cannot afford to lose them.”
“Fellow High Table members, it is a pleasure to see you again under good news instead of the bad for once” Enáretos says as he walks in to take his seat at the High table. Looking around, he realizes that every Archiean, their respective seers and the Goblin representative are all here, and the only person missing was Anagnostis, the royal star reader and seer. Enàretos looks at each member and they face him wearing smiles on their faces as they nod in greeting.
