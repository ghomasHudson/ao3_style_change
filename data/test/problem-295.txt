"It sucks that he's your crush, if it were someone like Zabini you'd probably tell us." Pansy figured.
qt was treating him so nicely, meanwhile he had just cuddled another bloke an hour or so prior..Draco knew he didn't deserve qt.
"Actually, if you browse it on a dictionary site, you will see two different definitions and meanings-" Hermione insisted.
Draco's eyes were closed when he noticed Ronald's presence near him. Ronald was sleeping on Draco's right side, but it seems that the red-head would no doubt accidentally slap him sooner or later.
"That's weird? You two both got out of relationships recently..was it so you two could be together?" Draco implied.
"You wanna know why I haven't had a girlfriend since age 15, Ginerva? It's because I turned her down for sex..I've never had sex with a girl, probably never will..all cause of me being gay." Draco admitted.
"I guess not many wizards at 11 can do something like that, but I know you'd save me if I was in danger." Harry believed.
"No. You're the first Malfoy in Hufflepuff, that's a milestone..If you were to be in Slytherin you'd grow into a replica of Lucius, who wants to be someone who already exists? It's a good thing to be different, I think it makes you cool." Harry believed.
"Fine, I've spent too much time around this filth anyways." Draco moved out of the other bloke's way, and began walking to his dorm with Harry.
What if he never found Hermione?? What if she was alone and got kidnapped? What if someone kidnapped him?!
"Theo's still in the closet to his parents, he wants to wait, and if it means fake dating you than that's what'll happen..unless you aren't onboard." Draco explained.
"Harry, I'm the first Malfoy in Hufflepuff, it'll disappoint my father and our name!" Draco worried.
"I'm sorry, I swear if it were my decision I'd tell you guys, but he told me specifically not to.." Harry frowned.
"I can give you a few pointers, it's nothing too in depth..just make it seem real if that makes any sense? Honestly, nobody knows that we're together, and we'd like to keep it that way for as long as possible..so please don't tell your friends about this?" Draco hoped.
"You mean the world to me." Draco flushed, and Harry assumed he flushed too. Harry sorta thought Draco's choice of words sounded like something a boyfriend would say, which he knew was a ridiculous assumption..but for some reason it made him feel quite giddy.
Draco had taken Harry's accident very badly..he hadn't done any school work in the past month, he never played lacrosse, he didn't keep up with his hygiene..he took it so hard to the point where he got kicked out of the hospital.
And because Harry was his robot, Draco assured him that he'd be able to go. At the time he didn't think much of it, but now that he and Harry were so close, letting him down was the last thing he wanted to do.
Draco knew before even opening it that his father had been the one to write it..he's seen the way he writtened plenty of times.
Harry knew there seats were closer to the stage, so he figured that would be his best chances of finding her.
"Yeah, actually you're the moron! You've only known Harry since June, how is it you keep defending him!? He's a robot, you don't know what he's capable of doing!" Theodore spat.
"I'm pretty sure it wouldn't come as a surprise to most people, it honestly makes me laugh when people ask if I'm dating my best friend." Draco chuckled.
Shit, Hermione and Pansy were for sure gonna bombard him with questions once he sees them..and Draco told him specifically to keep everything about their conversation a secret. Sometimes it sucks to have girls as best friends, they won't let things go..
"Y-yeah." Draco stuttered. Harry couldn't help but look at Draco in concern, he's never stuttered in front of him before..maybe he was too close.
"Mister Potter, this isn't sex ed..I will be telling your father about this inappropriate state of mind you have..now keep quiet!" Umbridge yelled.
Draco really didn't mean to, but he scooted closer towards Harry..hoping the chances of getting slapped were lower.
For more clarification, Harry's hair looks very well done due to Lucius' hair spell..therefore Draco has never seen his natural messy hair. Thank you for reading :)
"I'm a wreck t-too..you know I don't cry, but lately all my tears have been about you..missing you."
"Oh my god..i'm so stupid..this is when we first met! The same seat number and everything!" Harry realized.
"Look at how uncenetery this is..what if we're getting chased, this tunnel would do us no good." Draco crawled inside.
"Your mother and I went to this school, we found each other..I have no doubt you'll get along with the others." James patted his back.
"He just asked me about the fight, what was happening, and why I was on the floor.." Harry explained.
"No, I'm being unreasonable..father hates denial, he would've been more agitated if you didn't listen. Considering you're my robot, it's a responsibility that I make sure you're not hurt." Draco believed.
McGonagall opened Umbridge's door, her gaze falling to Harry, who was holding a sharp pencil above his palm.
Draco couldn't decide what made him more mad..Theodore's cruel insults or the defeated look on Harry's face? He frankly didn't care as he tackled Theodore, pinning him to the ground.
"Pansy, you know absolutely nothing on how to comfort someone..did you see the stadium? Of course she's here somewhere, the problem is how to find her." Draco scoffed.
The good thing about Harry was that he didn't push Draco for answers, the only exception being if Draco was near the extent of crying..he understood Draco's lack of emotion.
"You know for a past Slytherin you sure suck at lying..now what did you do this time? Sign me up for a gay porn site?" Draco assumed.
"Master Draco, Master Lucius told Beeve to tell you that lunch is served." Beeve, one of the house-elves said.
"The decent-looking Weasley is here, got that..Mister Potter, wish you were expelled instead..Malfoy, your father isn't happy I assume..hey, where's Lovegood?!" Umbridge wondered.
"I know. You can tell me anything, even if I don't understand, I'll always be there for you." Harry promised.
"Scorp is a bit shy, but he means well..I got him as a pet for my 9th birthday, and unfortunately he's staying at the manor while I'm at Hogwarts." Draco explains.
"You always t-treated me d-differently than the others..like I meant something bigger to you, or that you liked me a little bit..but when I saw Nott kissing you, I realized I'd been wrong.." Harry frowned.
"Draco is strong in many ways..he is a strong quidditch player, he has a strong heart, he's the strongest person I know!" Harry stated.
"There's a secret? Oh, if you don't feel comfortable we won't force you to say.." Hermione reassured.
"Yay! I was real worried about you!" Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, hugging him affectionately.
"These barrels are the entry way, we get in by tapping on this specific barrel..see how I'm doing this? If you do it correctly like I did, you'll be able to crawl through the tunnel and make it to the common room. Everyone follow me, please be respectful and go one at a time!" Reina guided, entering the tunnel first.
"You don't really need to ask me that..I like stars, my name is based off a constellation, It'd be bizarre if I didn't." Draco laughs.
"Now, back to the nickname thing..you can call me qt, or pot because I have tons of pots." Planter P shifted.
"Thank you..I'm opening a bakery soon, and if you want you're welcome to stop by whenever." Draco offered.
Harry had absolutely no idea where they were heading, but he kept his grasp on Hermione's hand, not wanting to risk the fate of accidentally being separated.
"Dolores! I was informed a student has been harassed in your care, from the looks of it, they just may be right." McGonagall examined.
"I don't care who you runts date, but locking me in my office, roaming the halls during detention, and cutting Lovegood's hair so she looks like a boy? It's sinful behavior." Umbridge disapproved.
Draco shared one final look with his mother before beginning to board the train, he knew deep down that he'd miss her.
"Father might have another one of his tantrums, he despises when unexpected guests arrive..mother and father would scold me for my behavior, I definitely can't have that on my very own birthday." Draco remembered.
Harry remembered the day Hermione gave him the exciting news..not only was it his birthday, but it might've been the best gift he's ever received.
"It will be over before you know it, I see Snape right now..besides I think a certain blonde boy was chatting with Harry here." Hermione smirked.
Harry looked around the field, quickly noticing that Ron Weasley was being charged at by some bloke on the other team..this set off alarms, alarms forcing him to run over as fast as he could.
"I've told you thousands of times to study with me, but never once have you agreed!" Hermione huffed.
Harry laughed, even if his face hurt like hell, he was sure feeling happy about his new proclaimed friend.
"In my defense, it's impossible for her to have known what your mother would've said..I found that hateful." Hermione comforted.
"Ah, and Malfoy..the one who locked me in my office. And quit gaping like a fish Potter!" Umbridge accused.
Even though Harry insisted that he could get on the boat fine without falling into the water, it didn't stop Draco from practically carrying him to one.
"He'll do what makes me happy, he's simply reminding you not to call me that stupid nickname!" Draco raised his voice.
"Hermione and I were trying to head back to our table, but of course I got knocked into..twice." Harry explained.
"We were already friends before we got together, so not much changed..well besides the fact that I told her I didn't like her because I was gay. Funny enough, she actually had been suspecting it." Planter P laughs.
"Yeah, my best mate was so confused at first, but then he started picking up on all the gay signs I had during Hogwarts." Planter P said.
"Please, don't joke about that sinful behavior in this school..or, just keep quiet like I said in the beginning!!" Umbridge demands before heading back into her office.
"And I know there's a bigger reason why..I'm not trying to annoy you..I just wanna know if something's wrong." Harry frowned. Draco moved to sit in front of Harry, looking a bit distraught.
"Sure, I won't tell anyone..I guess I'll help, plus, it means you can do my Chemistry homework." Harry jokes.
Please note my intention was not for Draco to originally be a Hufflepuff, but it kinda just happened as I was writing this chapter..It won't change Draco's character too much, it'll simply be a different atmosphere. I hope you don't mind Neville being in Hufflepuff, there's really not a lot of canon Hufflepuff's and I felt he was my best option. Thanks for reading :)
Draco kept his eyes set on the cauldron, the boil looking seemingly content..that was until the boil started overflowing.
"I must go, my dad just arrived..stay calm for me." Luna smiled, pushing the exit doors and heading to the parking lot.
"Draco, of course she's intolerable, but what makes you think that'll somehow work out in any of our favors?" Hermione wondered.
"Quit arguing!! This topic was something Harry wanted to avoid, this will not solve anything." Hermione objected.
"She wants us to be quiet, yet when we are she thinks we're up to something? This woman drives me mad.." Ginny complained.
"I accidentally gave him Professor Snape's drugs! I must've mixed up his for my headache one!" Hermione realized.
"When I asked my date to the Yule Ball, she admitted to me that she assumed I was gay..I wonder why all females seem to already know." Draco snorted.
"I'm sorry qt, I'm so sorry..I was with some people from Hogwarts, and we had some butterbeers..we were all stargazing, and I fucking cuddled up to the bloke next to me- and y-you are m-my favorite p-person, and I feel so s-selfish for n-not thinking a-bout you..I'm sorry." Draco cried.
"Potter was just holding a pencil, there's no harassing of any kind happening in my office!" Umbridge reassured.
"No, please don't sort me in Hufflepuff! No Malfoy is and I want to keep it that way!" Draco begged.
The train pulls into the station but Harry doesn’t notice. He’s stuck, frozen. They’re close, too close. The castle. Everything happened there. Everyone died. He died. He can’t go back. He just can’t do-
He thinks he’s going crazy. Post-traumatic stress, or any other of those muggle health problems Hermione has tried to diagnose him with.
Harry slams his hand down on the table, launching himself from the seat. His hands flail as he tries to articulate something, anything, in response to that.
"Harry's my robot, he could've fallen into the water and if that leads to carrying, so be it..besides, there's no way in hell I'm letting anyone else touch him." Draco defended.
"My first time skipping a whole class period, in a bathroom stall floor next to Draco Malfoy." Harry stated, laughing a little.
"Don't be ridiculous, he'll do you well..if not, I can discard him by the end of your first year." Lucius reassured.
"I understand if it's sudden..but do you wanna be my boyfriend? I mean, I love you and we kissed-" Harry rambled.
He knew the punishment could've been worse, but Draco simply didn't care..he was looking forward to the holidays. His parents would host a formal Christmas Ball and invite tons of wizarding families, most of them being purebloods of course.
Ron clears his throat, wand in hand, "Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, turn this stupid, fat rat yellow!"
"I do not approve of violence, but I'm not Head of Hufflepuff for no reason..It's clear to me that you were only trying to protect Harry. I didn't see you as a Hufflepuff right away, but the hat of course is never wrong. Seeing students in my house protecting one another is exactly what I cherish..5 points will be taken. I advise you to study and keep your distance from others for the night." Sprout decided.
Harry nodded, entering the bus. Now that Harry was 8, he thought it'd be fitting to pick that number to sit in.
"Sorry Dray, but a robot?? I understand that he looks un malfoy-like, but he clearly doesn't pass as a robot." Pansy snorted.
"Thank you..there's so many other blokes, what makes you think Harry of all people?" Ginny wondered.
"Yeah, I know..you don't need to ask someone you don't like..Is there anything else bothering you?" Harry wondered.
"As in relationship wise? Oh, uh..I only dated girls, but funny that I'm honestly more attracted to men. Well, it's not actually funny, but yeah. Uh, what about you two?" Harry struggled.
"I don't know why he was saying those things but I swear they aren't true..I would've been devastated if you didn't come to Hogwarts with me." Draco reassured.
"No! Mister Potter has scars, as Principal of Hogwarts High, I find this a violation of discipline! I hear by fire you from teaching ever again at my school!" McGonagall ruled.
Draco knew where this was leading, he wasn't totally naive. People don't just constantly think about a friend, unless there's something more to it..and he knew his thoughts about qt were beginning to be more than just platonic.
"I could say the same about your atrocious mane, Umbridge! Luna's hair looks amazing, maybe you need some tips from her!" Ginny snapped.
Harry was still haunted by the memory of Nott, but it didn't compare to what Draco witnessed during his coma..even if Draco didn't return his feelings, Draco was still his best friend.
"He'll read to me, watch me practicing quidditch, match with me in a game of a chess, he'll protect me as well." Draco listed.
"Quit laughing Potter, and you Granger! Stay to your seat, no touching your boyfriend!" Umbridge ordered.
"Yes..Lucius gave you to me. I'm his personal robot that will do anything to make him happy." Harry declared.
"Oh, he yelled a lot, but It was my fault for upsetting him..I was more sad about having to leave without you." Harry explained.
"Father says a lot of nonsense when he's frustrated. I said it looked good, and nobody's judgement is as accurate as mine." Draco reassured.
Draco wants to lock Umbridge in her office, Hermione elaborates on jealousy, Luna speaks once every thirty minutes, Ginny talks about her brothers, and Harry is scared of Umbridge's "pencil."
"I said he was, but I was just joking with him..he has a girlfriend, he can't have romantic feelings for guys." Draco explained.
"It doesn't matter..it's just a school dance filled with sweaty middle schoolers." Draco rolled his eyes.
"Lucius said it made me look fat, I suppose he doesn't want an even worse image." Harry smiled sadly.
"He would never hurt someone on purpose! What are you? Scared of robots? I find that pathetic." Draco sneered.
Therefore, Draco hesitantly went over to Harry's bed. Feeling a little bad that he had his eyes shut too..
"If you allowed me to finish you would've known that I was gonna say you were thinking about your new cake idea." Pansy scoffed.
Harry knew Draco was gay, at least, he was aware of it..but he wasn't aware of his fascination towards bloody Nott. The more he thought about it, the harder it was to hold back his cries. Harry always felt that Draco treated him differently..he would always hug him, compliment him, all things he never did to Ron or his other friends. Harry thought he was special.
"You don't even address them by their real names, how do you expect them to agree?" Hermione wondered.
"No, I told them it was private, and that you didn't want me to tell anyone..they didn't budge too much thankfully." Harry smiled.
"That wizard made me angry..I wanted to do something, but I was afraid I'd end up proving him right." Harry said as they walked.
"The hat chose, not you..he can't get mad over something you weren't able to control. It wouldn't be valid." Harry stated.
"I'm working on getting my new shop finalized..it will be located in Diagon Alley once it's open." Draco shared.
"I know your mind keeps drifting to that, but put it away for a minute..you don't know me that well." Luna shifted.
"I love you too." Harry smiled. He really meant it too..Harry has never said those words to him before, nor has Draco said it to him. They would always just comfort each other by saying, "you're my best friend." Which, of course, was true..but it didn't nearly make Harry this happy. Harry has said the words many times to his parents, but with Draco, it was a different kind of love. He couldn't really explain why it felt so different, but it made his heart flutter with pure happiness.
Draco decided it'd be best to tell Harry right then and there about his letter. If he waited til tomorrow to tell Harry, he could get upset before the day even begun.
"I know we already talked about this, but what kind of pencil did Umbridge give you?" Draco wondered.
Harry barely sat himself down at the lunch table before his best friends began swarming him with questions.
Draco took a sip of his tea, thoughts drifting to qt. He could be emailing him right now, which sounded much more pleasing than this awkward lunch. He couldn't wait for later tonight. No, he wasn't having sex with anyone..but he and qt would be visiting each other again. With the spell of course.
"That are utter useless. This robot however, holds countless benefits. Unlike the house-elves, he'll be able to attend Hogwarts with you." Lucius went on.
Harry couldn't describe the sinking feeling in his chest..but it was enough for him to run out of the locker room immediately. He didn't even care if the two noticed he was in there, all he cared about was the repeating image of Draco being kissed by Theodore.
Harry snapped back into his conscious state, still feeling the urging pain from his hit to the face.
"Having a B is a great score, Lavender can barely get that high of a marking..she could never be as smart as you, don't listen to her." Ginny comforted.
Towards the end of the game, things started to get more aggressive between the two teams. More of Harry's teammates were getting injured, the other team was going up in scores, and Harry was seemingly more stressed.
"I guess she really didn't do the dirty with you..can't blame her, you probably have a small dick." Draco assumed.
"Fine! Have it your way, but I'll be the one winning! I bet they'll already have a new seating table by the time you ask!" Hermione bet.
"Don't be embarrassed, hell, even Harry has-" Ronald spoke, who received a smack on the face from Harry.
"This isn't grade specific, and let's face it..Pansy has predicted maybe 3 things just today, I don't doubt her." Harry defended.
"Fine, then I'll have to do it for you." Draco says as he squirts a few pumps of lotion on his palm.
He knew Draco's seen Theodore shirtless before, almost everyone has..but this situation was different. Harry could tell. It was slowly making his blood boil the longer Theodore stood there shirtless..but he was extremely livid as Theodore pressed his lips to Draco's for a kiss.
"Just stop talking..you know I love you, Dray. I wouldn't say all these things about you if they weren't true." Harry spoke a bit slowly.
"Anyone with proper sight should've noticed that..what should I do to fix this current problem?" Severus questioned.
Ginny attempted to take a nap, but it seemed Umbridge was getting mad at her for being too quiet..which meant, sleeping wasn't an option.
"Are you talking about the sinning of liking both men and women?? Did I hear mister Potter is this?" Umbridge approached.
Draco couldn't deny that Harry reading to him was nearly as calm as to when his mother did..Harry spoke gently and kind, never raising his voice or stuttering in between a line.
"Good afternoon, class. Welcome to your first flying lesson..well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up! Stick your right hand over the broom and say "up." Madam Hooch instructs.
Draco remembered Harry's motivating words when he first got sorted, and for the most part he believed them..although, the result was unlucky as he originally expected.
"Oh..I'm not mad you know. I'm kinda sad, because I wanted to go with you..but it's ok, I'm happy to still be celebrating Christmas with you." Harry smiled sadly.
"I'm sure your father would be upset if he heard what I had to say about your behavior..shut it this instant." Umbridge threatened.
Draco began looking through compartments, along with constantly checking to see if Harry was following him.
"Quite well, and not just because I'm sitting next to an attractive bloke." Draco laughed nervously.
"Well, I currently have a boyfriend, but I have dated a few share of girls in the past." Pansy answered.
Harry was beaming with adrenaline, the bleachers were extra packed for today's game. Draco seemed to be a bit more nervous than usual, but maybe it was his way of dealing with the excitement.
"Warn a bloke perhaps?? And no, I'm not! Ron Weasley stalked Hermione when she was at the library yesterday." Harry explained.
Draco blinked furiously, who in the right mind would invade someone's home, and on top of that..who the hell would kill a plant so meaningful!? Draco tried to calm down, but with his consciousness still a bit dead, he couldn't contain it very well.
"Also, I know this isn't my place, but Ginny's latest relationship was with Dean Thomas, not Harry." Hermione claimed.
"Harry, because you've been a great robot, would you like to eat at the ice cream shop?" Draco asks.
Harry kissed back right away, adjusting to the feeling of Draco's mouth on his..and of course, he was an amazing kisser..but boy did it hurt.
"Yes..but I let my emotions get the best of me. It's stupid, but I was crying and stuff..and I..when I was driving home, I saw the car about to crash into mine, b-but I didn't do anything to stop it..I made y-you worry, I'll b-because I w-was being s-selfish..I'm s-sorry." Harry explained.
Hey everyone, this is the last chapter..I can't believe I finished this story in barely 72 hours. I guess writing during school keeps you busy lol. Warnings: Harassment, Drugs.
"I will not be sharing anything of that information..it's nobody's business but mine." Hermione stated.
"Father can barely handle a string of my hair un slicked, I imagine he'll throw a tantrum once he sees this..we better find him. Nice to see you both, now follow me Harry." Draco waved goodbye, leaving the shop with Harry.
Draco smacked himself in the head, how could he be so careless..Severus would've been disappointed at his lack of liability.
"Lucky for you, I have a green apple to offer." Hermione smiled, grabbing an apple out of her bag and gesturing it to Draco.
"Oh god, Pansy looks like she's about to tear Seamus' hair out! I'll be right back!" Hermione rushed back.
"Yes, they were both sorted into Slytherin..actually, every Malfoy/Black that's still on our family tree has been sorted there. No doubt I'll be as well." Draco figured.
"And knocked Harry over! Honestly, do people watch where they're going?" Hermione helped Harry off the floor. Harry gave her a quick thanks as he brushed his knees, only to be knocked over again.
"Yes, she mentioned that when we first became friends..she told me it was about Zacharias and drama with her ex-girlfriend, but she doesn't like talking about it..I mean, who would?" Harry said.
"I should too, Pansy will exaggerate the whole conversation." Harry leant next to the pillar with her.
"If you were the smarter person than you wouldn't continue making Draco angry. I think that makes you the moron!" Harry thought.
Draco didn't feel like arguing with his robot any longer, and instead drifted off to sleep at the sound of his favorite bedtime story..
"So do your manners, now quit whining! I'll be in my office." Umbridge said, entering the office area.
Draco almost fell out of his chair, qt just sent him a heart!! Draco felt like such a softie, he was 23 not 13.
"Hey? Are you two alright? We've been waiting for a few minutes!" Reina interrupted from the end of the tunnel.
"Good, because I love you." Harry said again. Harry honestly didn't know where his mind was at, he wasn't the type to be so "lovey-dovey" but with his heart so full, he just couldn't help but say it.
"Yes and no..but that doesn't matter, you kept me from getting hurt! How should I repay you, mate??" Ron wondered.
He felt horrible, he worried his parents for a whole month..if he wasn't so careless, he could've gotten out of the situation safer.
"No foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art the dispersion making, however for those select few who possess in the predisposition. I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death." Severus stated, his eyes beginning to gaze at Harry.
"Sh, sh..baby, I got you." Draco caressed his hand and smothered it with kisses. Harry's heart melted at the pet name, no one has ever called him that before..
Draco had kissed Harry on the cheek before, and it made him believe that something might've been there..maybe there was..but whatever it is, Nott definitely had more of it to land himself an actual kiss on the lips.
"I'm just saying that even someone I've known forever didn't wanna be my friend, why would you be any different?" Draco wondered.
Harry didn't know what he got himself into..not only was Draco gay and taken by bloody Theodore Nott, but he wanted to fake a relationship with Harry of all people?! Harry tried to not show his disappointment when Draco said he was dating Theodore, but it did hurt to know he wasn't single..at least he was getting something out of this, better grades in Chemistry.
When Draco filled Harry in about what the holidays were like at the Manor, Harry had been fascinated by the idea of going to a Christmas Ball.
They are talking. Not to each other, but at someone. He can’t see who until the boy with curls shifts, removing his arm from around Pansy Parkinson’s shoulder. Grey eyes look up.
The bottles he stashed, shrunken and in a locked box, in the bottom of his bag won’t last him long and he’s worried. He’s not had to deal with himself fully sober for a long time. Since Lavender’s funeral to be exact, a month after the end of the war. The sight of her eight-year-old sister screaming after her as the casket lowered into the ground branded his mind. The casket of a girl he had felt nothing but contempt towards, but who still fought with him. Who had put her trust in him and died because of it. Hers was the last funeral of many, he had attended every single one, and that night he had drowned himself in alcohol. It was also the night of the first tattoo. A sprig of lavender carved into the side of his right pinkie in black ink.
Ron had called it morbid the first time he’d seen it. Hermione had just looked at him weirdly, as though she could see through him. It didn’t bother him though. He was used to those looks, and Ron hadn’t been all that far from accurate.
It’s silent as they open. The crowd creeps forward, crammed together. Harry sees a few tears ghosting people’s eyes. He watches, as Parvati and Padma clutch each other reassuringly, but Parvati turns, for the smallest moment, Harry almost misses it. It’s inconsequential. But it’s as if to check if Lavender’s alright. But she’s not. She’s not there.
He doesn’t want to. He’ll have to hand one to the person in the other side of the room who he’d been ignoring even though he could feel silvery eyes boring into him. But Hermione is watching him expectantly and he doesn’t want to give her another reason to yell at him, there’s only so much of one person’s voice you can hear without going mad. And Harry thinks he’s already pretty close to going mad.
“Merlin’s saggy balls!” He yells, pressing his back against the separator, wand in hand immediately. It had seemed a handy reflex at the time he’d learnt it, you know with the war and all, but now he can see how it could come across as threatening.
Harry tunes out, casting a look at Ron as they both grin at the constant that was Hermione Granger, thankful that something hadn’t changed.
But, out of all choices, this was the best place to stay. He couldn’t stay at the Weasley’s. Their grief was suffocating. He didn’t begrudge them it of course, it was his fault they felt this way, but he couldn’t see Mrs Weasley smile that smile around her tear-swollen eyes again. No. They needed to be alone together. George needed his family. And that wasn’t Harry.
im not sure how i feel ab this chapter so if it’s shite feel free to tell me ( also I figured out how to do italics on ao3 so things should read nicer now I hope )
He lurches his aching body up off the floor, stumbling as his leg cramps. Sleeping on the kitchen floor while covered in your own tears and sick probably wasn’t the highest point in his life. But equally, it wasn’t the lowest. He was just glad he’d numbed his brain enough the night before to have even just a little bit of restful sleep.
She whips round, he almost smiles at the oh-so familiar incredulity on her face. He’s knows he’s about to be lectured, “Worms? Harry it is not about worms! It is about how certain creatures use insects and other smaller creatures, such as worms, as a trading system to…”
“It’s alright,” he assures her. There’s been a lot of that lately. No one can seem to say the right thing. All so caught up in their own grief or their own relief that they don’t notice others. Or don’t care. Harry doesn’t care. He knows he should, but he can’t find himself to care about that either. “It’s… fine.”
“Er… yes alright.” Hermione doesn’t believe him. He sees it in the way she looks at him. “If you need us Harry we are-“
He walks out of the compartment, shaking his head in disbelief as he slams the door behind him, revelling in the surprised
“I-“ His voice catches around the word as his eyes burn as he continues his abuse on the door. But he can’t stop it when he slumps against the door, hand still weakly bashing the wood. “Fuck you Hermione,” he says as he slumps to the ground, pressing his hot forehead against the cool surface of the wall, breathing heavily.
“Um…” he starts, tilting his head back and stroking the snake wrapped around his throat as he tries to conceal his annoyance. He just wants to board the bloody train and get this hell over with. Luckily, he never gets to finish as he looks back at Hermione and spots a group of people near the end of the almost empty platform huddling together and muttering as he freezes.
Harry thinks, scrubbing at his face for the thousandth time, messing up his already tangled hair even more.
He retches into the sink. Even in his drunken mind he knows what he just thought, just did, was not good. He’s not alright. He needs help. He’ll hurt himself. But he can’t bear the thought of another person seeing him like this.
He’s running again. Sheer adrenaline pushing him, stumbling over roots, stones, leaves. He hears the footsteps following at the same frantic pace all around him. How, he’s not sure as his ears blare with the rush of his blood. Mud cakes the bottom of his jeans; it doesn’t matter. He can’t stop running.
A sob breaks the crowd. A heart wrenching cry that is too familiar to everyone here. Harry sees a girl, a Ravenclaw he doesn’t recognise, on her knees. She’s clawing at the patch of stone beneath her, nails scrabbling against it. She’s whispering something, Harry can’t quite hear what. He edges through the crowd who are all staring at her. Her eyes run with tears as her nails start to bleed. He’s not sure what he hears first, the scratch of the stone, or the girl’s voice. “Mum, mum, mum, mum, mum. Where are you mum? Mum stop this isn’t funny! Come back to me mum. Mum!”
With that, Malfoy turns and walks out of the carriage, leaving Harry to question what had just happened.
He stumbles back home. He’s sure the only reason he isn’t somehow stabbed in the depths of London was because he throws up at least twice. He’s not quite sure what though. He can’t remember the last time he ate.
She can’t, not yet. “Okay, that’s okay. I’m just going to cast a little charm on your hands okay,” he takes out his wand and the girl jumps, trying to scramble away if not for his grip on her bloodied hands. He puts it down immediately, “no, no, no. It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you. I’m just going to heal your cuts alright?”
He’s scraped his knee somehow. It stings. He splashes some of the… what was it? Oh yeah, gin, onto the cut, barely wincing as the sting increases tenfold. He does it again. Another drop. The pain feels good. It grounds him. He wants more.
"Yeah..I know it happened years ago, but sometimes I wish we were still friends..I've mentioned it to Theo, but he never liked her much, so he didn't really get it I guess.." Draco trailed off.
Harry concluded that it felt good, being this close to Draco. Harry wanted to test if it would feel even better laying his head against his upper shoulder.
"You would say "no" even if you didn't, how am I supposed to know you're saying the truth?!" Ron snarled.
"Sure, he may not look creepy, but once we're asleep he'll make a plan to hurt us all." Zacharias assumed.
"I'm fine, now kiss me-" Harry insisted, grabbing Draco's shirt, but rather disappointed once Draco stepped away.
"Seriously? The fight barely begun, why'd you drag me away?" Pansy complained, slouching at the table.
"I've never seen your hair in this state..someone must've casted a hair spell on him!" Draco guessed.
"I hope it doesn't make you mad..but during lacrosse practice, I went to go see what you and Nott were doing..because, I noticed you guys left and I figured you guys were skipping or something..but I uh, I saw Nott standing in front of you, shirtless...he kissed you, and I got upset." Harry began.
Harry was a bit surprised when Draco interlaced there fingers, but he found himself liking that too.
Harry watched as Draco stood only a few inches in front of him..Harry picked up right away that his best friend was uneasy.
Hermione, Harry's best friend, well, Harry had more than 1 best friend..however, Hermione buying the tickets for them, might've helped her claim the "ultimate best friend" title.
Draco shot awake at the sound of his laptop beaming, as tired as he was..he reached for it quickly and soon winced at the bright light.
Draco did not like waiting, having a tunnel as an entry way was so inconvenient..Draco didn't wanna see an arse up in his face.
"'Mione we're in school! And besides, staring is different than following a person into a bloody library!" Harry covered the girl's mouth.
"That was brave kid, we wanted to invite you and your parents for brunch next week?" Arthur Weasley offered.
They finally entered the common room, and Draco couldn't deny the place had a calm demeanor. It was sunny, full of grass and plants, it seemed cosy.
"Yes, but I haven't been on a broom since the war..Quidditch felt more like a chore than a fun game to me." Draco replied.
"Well I am your teacher, and you will do as I say! Now, come over here and open this door!" Umbridge demanded.
Ginny Weasley entered Hogwarts High, the feeling of dread overwhelming her. She had Saturday detention, which meant she had to get up at the crack of dawn. Umbridge was a monster, Ginny insisted to her parents, but they didn't do anything to prevent her from going.
Funny, Harry was Draco's ride home too. Although ditching him just allows Draco to ride with Nott, and as much as that hurt Harry to think about..he'd rather have that than even look at Draco.
It wasn't just due to him being anonymous, the feelings were more than that. Draco fooled around with Adrian Pucey, Terry Boot, but it was just sex, no pure romance.
"Lucius..remember, the times are different now that he's dead..we can't torture muggleborns forever." Narcissa reminded.
Draco had viewed his previous email to Planter P, who still had yet to respond. Draco would be lying if he told someone he didn't enjoy the emailing. He actually really liked the fellow wizard. Draco wasn't necessarily keen on figuring out who it was, he didn't wanna find out and somehow regret anything..most importantly, he didn't want the planting wizard to end up hating him. Not many people liked Draco, and it was a bit saddening to think about his online friend disliking what he saw.
"Don't think because you're a robot that you'll be granted with any difference in expectations.." Severus warned.
"I've never had a best friend before, nor a friend..you're the first person who's ever cared about me." Harry smiled shyly.
That's how he knew qt was different from his past lovers, just the simplest touch made him feel so content.
"It's f-fine..I missed you." Harry tried to touch Draco's hand, but a broken wrist made it a bit difficult.
"I always believed that wizards were the greatest people in existence..however, robots evidently hold that spot." Draco stated.
"Sorry, I know you aren't used to muggle jokes..It was clever though, you were gonna continue calling me that." Planter P smirked.
Harry made it to the destined area, but his breathing soon picks up when he doesn't see Hermione anywhere in sight. Harry was beginning to think he should wander around the mass of people until he found her again, but when Harry Styles appeared upon stage, his plan was quickly subdued.
He slams his hand against one of the walls separating the hallway from a compartment, tension falling from his shoulders when it shakes the entire row of wall. He smashes into it again. “Fuck.” He kicks at the door, hand still flying against the hard wood. “Fuck-“
Maybe it was the anger still flashing in his mind from his conversation with Hermione, or maybe it was just seeing Malfoy’s sneering face again that when he advances, crowding Draco and pressing the advantage of his height, that he doesn’t even question his own actions. He looks down at him, their faces inches apart as Harry smirks. “That’s funny, Malfoy.
“You already have two tattoos Harry!” he stopped listening to Hermione a while ago, when they were still in London, but tunes back in at this.
But he reaches them all too quickly and passes the schedule to Pansy before holding one out for Malfoy. He doesn’t take it straight away. He taps his right ring finger on the bottom of the paper
“Yeah,” he mutters, snorting, knowing he’ll come to regret this, “two that you know of love.” It was childish. He knows that.
“Go on,” he whispers, almost mocking as he nods toward Harry’s outstretched wand, “do it. Do your worst.”
He catches a glimpse of his body in the mirror, still lean, he’d never quite got the hang of eating enough. Habit. He blamed it on that. But still, he had quite a few muscles on his slender frame. Fighting a war apparently would do that to someone. Well, that as well as the many, many people he’d fucked over the last few months. Stamina apparently gave its own contribution to muscle mass. He needed to get his anger out some way, he reasons, and apparently copious sex with men and women alike was the most enjoyable way of doing that.
He sees another person come up behind her who crouches down and places a hand on the back of her neck, applying light pressure. It’s the point that calms people, if Harry can remember correctly. He doesn’t know who it is but he’s grateful as he sees the girl break through her eyes a little.
“Shame” Malfoy snorts, pushing himself upright, “you’re not as fun as you used to be. What, are you becoming one of those peace-makers now that you’ve fought, and killed may I add, in a war? I’ll grieve for that loss Potter, I truly will.” He says, pressing a hand to his chest.
“Better,” she says, almost hopeful, “still angry I didn’t tell them what was going on. I cant blame them for that really. But we’re all still alive-“
“Come on Harry,” Ron slaps a palm to his shoulder, almost too forcefully, “last one to the carriage has to eat the rotten fish Bertie Bott’s I found.”
She freezes as she realises her mistake, they all do, and turns, aghast, to Ron, her face almost white, “Oh Ron, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean-“
The person, however, seems unperturbed as Harry’s eyes travel up their languid stance. Legs crossed at the ankle, hands intertwined across a flat, wide chest, body leaning back against a wooden beam. Grey eyes gleaming in the lamp-light.
He’s done the whole obligatory “Yes I’m the saviour of the world you may ask me every single personal question you can think of and then some” rigmarole. He doesn’t need anymore questions.
Clearly being drunk almost twenty-four seven didn’t make you exempt from the side effects of a hangover, he discovers as he shoves the last few items into his suitcase as his head protests every movement. He’s pretty certain he’s still a little bit drunk.
It’s been 4 months since the war had ended and he was dead, since Harry had finally killed him. But of everything, every twisted thing he’s seen or done, the cruel thing people call fate has decided to taunt him with that memory. He’s not sure why he hates it so much. In comparison to everything else it’s positively mundane. But he is sure without a doubt that that is his worst memory.
“Harry it is too far this time. Too far,” Hermione chastises, she’s been doing it for the past hour but still refuses to look at him. He’s not listening to her, “the neck… abomination was bad enough but this… I just can’t believe why someone would want to do that to themselves!”
He scrambles for any idea of what she might’ve said but can’t find anything, “Sorry,” he’s said that a lot lately, “was lost in my head. What did you say ‘Mione?”
“I think we all have,” the other person says. And now Harry places the voice as he looks up, straight into gleaming, grey eyes. “McGonagall should be out in a minute, come on let’s get you sat down over here.”
He twists, showing his back to the mirror as he did every morning and checks the tattoo spanning across his shoulders, the largest of the many he’d acquired. He imagines the shock of the people at Hogwarts when they see him, sporting swirls of ink over most visible surfaces except his legs. He got them whenever he was consumed by guilt, finding the sharp nicks of the needle soothing. Needless to say he had quite a few. Nodding he turns back, retrieves his clothes and makes his way over to his wardrobe to grab clean ones for the trip to school.
There were three of them that he’d could see. A boy with dark skin, hair cropped almost to his head who stands next to another boy with dark, brown curls. This boy has his arm around the shoulders of a girl with an unmistakable sleek, black bob.
“Yeah I think I can,” she says as they pull her to her feet. She sways a little, stumbling before Harry catches her and she rights herself, “sorry for all the trouble. I just had a little shock seeing… well.” She snorts as she gestures futilely to the space before her.
He scrubs himself hard, hoping to wash away all of the many things he’s not quite sure he did from last night, and winces and let’s out a stream of expletives when his flannel rips off the half-healed scab on his knee, new blood mixing with a trickle of water running down his knee. He ignores it.
He hated that anger. It felt like he couldn’t separate them again. That even though he was dead, he was still a part of Harry. A ghost. Controlling him until the line between them blurred and Harry had no idea how to stop him.  He couldn’t even say his name anymore. He was now scared of the thing people were not afraid of any longer.
Malfoy. Harry knew he’d be at school this year. Everyone did. It was part of his parol, the terms of which was splashed over every paper’s front page the day they were released. Harry had been to Draco’s hearing. Fuck he’d even testified. He’d
No one sits in the back-most carriage of the train. Rumours it haunted or something, Harry’s not quite sure, but he’s seen enough horror for the threat of a ghost to put him off as he slams his way into the final cabin.
“No.” He says. He couldn’t care less about what she was saying. He didn’t need to care. She has it under control. She has everything under control.

"What would you know?! I'm pretty sure the lacrosse players would know more than you." Harry glared.
"The beds at your manor are definitely bigger in terms of size, but these beds are much more comfortable." Harry thought.
"I'm leaving with my father, thank you for making this detention one I'll never forget." Hermione waved, following her father out the door.
"Dolores, this pencil is sharp as a needle point! Care to explain why Mister Potter has it?" McGonagall observed.
"I mean, I don't really wanna go, but I like it the best when I spend my time with you." Draco shared.
"Make sure to listen really well, I know you aren't performing any real magic, but Professor Snape has extremely high standards." Draco warned Harry before entering the potion's room.
"He is not creepy! In all honesty you look creepier, which says a lot about your looks in particular.." Draco insulted.
"Harry, I know the timing is bad..but you remember the middle school dance? You kept wondering what was wrong, but meanwhile I was jealous knowing you were gonna go with some other person..Harry, I've always liked you..loved you." Draco revealed.
"Just sod off, Malfoy..no wonder you haven't had a girlfriend since the age of 15." Ginny widened her eyes.
"What's it to you with all these questions? But no, I'm an only child, and I doubt father would ever consider adopting..whether he's a robot or not." Draco crossed his arms.
"Aunt and uncle always said I didn't belong at an event like this..maybe they were right." Harry sighed
"Hermione, let's face it. Studying with you is like us studying for a final exam- oh shit there's Weaslette!" Pansy noticed.
"I don't care about this little argument, what are they doing here Draco? Your mother and I specifically said no party." Lucius reminded.
"He's a good looking red-head, wouldn't you two be celebrating? If Weaslette stalked me, oh I'd be screaming." Pansy shared.
"...I mean, it makes me a bit sad that you cuddled with another bloke, but if you really are sorry.." qt trailed off.
"Absolutely, and somehow they aren't! I've behaved perfectly this whole year, what did I do to deserve that?" Draco complained.
"Are you sure that's a real spell? Well it's not very good is it..I've only tried a few simple spells for practice, and they've all worked for me." She gloated.
But of course, some random ass person had to walk right in between there intertwined hands, causing them to split apart.
Yes, Draco had attended them numerously in the past..not a big surprise considering his parents were the one's hosting.
"Sure, it's bad luck..but I don't really belong here. Let alone looking at Harry Styles.." Harry frowned.
What will his friends say? They always talked about being in Slytherin together..more importantly, what would his father think??
Hermione reveals the truth about her ticket to detention, Ginny is trying to help everyone, Harry talks about his childhood, while Luna and Draco share something personal in common..and Harry accidentally consumes drugs.
"Yes..you aren't a bad person. I don't think." Planter P smiled, although Draco could barely see it.
"You don't even know if that's true, and if it is..why would she be sitting with them?" Hermione reminded.
Once Ron visited an awake Harry, it was mentioned that Draco wasn't doing well..hell, even Harry's own mother said Draco wasn't doing well.
"I'm sorry Harry, but we can't go to the Christmas Ball like I promised..my parents aren't letting us come back to the manor." Draco revealed.
Of course, Harry couldn't compare himself to someone that brilliant..but he still felt he could relate to the star.
"It's about Pansy, kind of..I'm just really sick of everyone telling me to ask her. You know I don't fancy her..and it's getting under my skin." Draco explained.
Harry didn't care if practice was still going, and instead sprinted to his car, knowing he would explode any second.
Including the debate he was having about Draco possibly visiting him..he missed Draco, really, really, bad.
"Pansy! What the hell, that makes me look like a 10 year old?! What if this person finds my place when it opens and totally digs at it!" Draco scolded.
"Living with Draco has been absolutely boring lately, he's always on his laptop." Pansy rolled her eyes.
"How about we spend the last few hours of detention roaming the halls? I think we suffered this library for long enough..Potter, the choice is yours?" Draco smiled.
"Well I better keep searching for Neville's toad, make sure to change into your robe's Ron." Hermione reminded as she left the compartment.
"From what I know, most robots don't show a lot of emotion..however, it doesn't seem to be the case with yours." Hermione noted.
"It's hard to understand..I was in a car accident with my parents when I was little, m-my mom died, and I, along with my dad lived..he was struggling, and couldn't take care of me for most of my childhood. I had to stay with my aunt and uncle for over 10 years, but they hated me. My cousin, Dudley, had two bedrooms, while I was left with a cupboard to live in..when I finally moved in with my dad, he was always trying to get me above everyone. He's always pushing me into relationships, and especially lacrosse. Now for the relevant part..my dad told me to tape up Creevey. That's why I'm in detention." Harry revealed.
"She'll find out within an instant, then we'll get into more trouble..I don't know about you, but her yelling is unbearable." Harry huffed.
Due to the difference plot wise, I had to cut out a lot of original scenes from the first book..I wish I could've added Fluffy and the remembrall scenes, however I couldn't fit them into the story properly. Sorry if this took awhile to post, I'm currently busy with finishing my school year and driver's ed..all that aside, happy pride month everyone!! :) Today at school these guys were holding the door open, and right when I was about to go through they automatically stopped holding it. Maybe it was my pride backpack..#homophobic? Anyways, enough with discussing annoying ass 15 year olds..I hope everyone has a great month of celebrating who and what you are. Edit: Finally finished this chapter, the notes before are from last week lol. Very sorry for the wait, luckily, I completed driver's ed. It's also my last day of school, I intend to update more frequently.
"Not becoming friends my ass! Now, I better head on out to meet Hermione and Harry at the pub! I'll see you later." Pansy left.
No, Harry didn't like him just because they happened to have the same name..he liked the celebrity for many reasons.
"I've talked it over with Theo, and he's fine with it..unless you aren't willing to help. By all means I understand, we barely talk..but if you aren't against it, I was thinking we can fake a relationship..it'd make things easier for us." Draco explained.
"You'll regret ever firing me, have fun teaching a school with sinful students!" Umbridge stormed out of the office, leaving the library, driving to home, and never looking back.
"According to him he was looking for a book in the romantic fiction section, but it was actually the historical part of the library..it was rather barbaric." Hermione laughs.
"My parents, they would adore you, and, you're friends with Ron..If you need a second-family, you can always join us for brunch." Ginny offered.
Funny, Draco had a very similar reaction when Pansy mentioned qt..if Draco was looking at this correctly, then it seemed Harry might be seeing someone too.
"I knew you weren't gonna actually take a piss..besides, I wanna know what's wrong." Harry shrugged.
Harry moved towards Draco so they would sit together side by side. Harry felt rather brave today, and couldn't help but wrap his arms around Draco's one arm.
"..you know my jealousy towards Lavender? It's not necessarily due to her connections with others, it's a lot of things..well for one, I fancy her boyfriend, your brother, Ron..but that's not the situation. She and her friends were saying I wasn't smart, but instead utterly annoying. When she saw the B I received for my Chemistry test, she said I should shoot myself for having such a disappointing grade..the school found a firearm in my locker. That's why I'm here." Hermione explained.
"Dear god I will never be that careless again! I thought I'd never find you!" Hermione squeezed his arm.
Umbridge's door isn't staying open, Hermione's dad is the school janitor, Ginny starts to question things, Draco is acting more human, Luna suggests to read everyone's palms, but Harry has scars on his.
"Once the stories over I'll leave..I'm sorry, I need to do what makes you happy, and that's reading you a bedtime story." Harry opened the book.
Draco got up on his feet, debating whether to tell Pansy he was leaving or if he should just ditch them all together.
"No, it's a good thing they found the gun though..you can't go back after something like that." Draco's gaze flicked to his feet.
“Erm yeah no I’m not feeling too good,” he interrupts them, forces a smile and shrugs sheepishly, “probably just tired. I’ll catch you guys on the train yeah?”
“Harry,” the tone of Hermione’s voice broke through the fog of Malfoy’s face in his mind, “are you even listening?”
He points to the shop next to them, he doesn’t know if what he’s about to say is right, his memory is hazy at best for the past few months, but he needs to speak so they don’t suffocate on the awkward air, “Hey Hermione, didn’t you want that new book on… worms?”
He tilts his face back into the stream, letting it wash away the lather in his hair that’s growing quite long. Long enough actually for him to need a hairband to keep it out of his face in a loose bun at the back of his neck. He ignores his half-hard cock as he washes the last of the shampoo out and grabs his towel from the floor, sniffing it to check if it’s clean. It isn’t. He uses it anyway.
“I was here to ride an erumpent to candy land and live out my wildest dreams,” he says, clasping his hands in front of his chest. “Want to join?”
He nods as Hermione says something with her eyes. She’s asking permission. He knows she has to do something to disguise him. It’s their safest best. He braces himself as the glow of a stinging spell rushes from her wand. He hates this part.
Harry’s heart stutters as he stumbles, his mind immediately placing a body at his feet. He grabs Hermione’s arm, she looks at him before grabbing back, misgivings forgotten. Ron comes up on his other side, walking close as they guide Harry forward. Hermione squeezes his hand as they walk past the place where
"This is the common room! To the right is our stairs that lead to the boy's and the left stairs lead up to the girls! All your luggage is up in your dorms, if you have any questions feel free to ask me, the other prefects, or even Professor Sprout!" Reina explained.
"Absolutely bollocks..she's nice, but I don't thinks she's learned how to keep her hands to herself." Draco thought.
"How come you always take her judgement over mine?? I have the better record after all." Hermione thought.
"I'm just saying, sometimes you need to be curious..I didn't even know they were shagging, maybe Pansy should be more investigative! Or whatever you wanna call it." Harry backed up.
"You look like Malfoy, who's a boy! If you want your hair short, at least have it look good." Umbridge scoffed.
Draco really felt like he should be the one thanking Harry, but, maybe they were both equally thankful.
"Hermione, wait up!" Harry called, but it was useless once he realized he couldn't see her anywhere.
Draco returns home after spending two weeks out of the UK, he decides to pay Luna Lovegood a visit, and a favor as well.
"I might be thinking a bit crazy because you're attractive..but yes, I think you were meant to be here." Draco's eyes locked with his. Harry didn't respond to this right away, and instead took a moment to really look at the blonde beside him. Harry must've been getting dehydrated, because he now couldn't stop thinking that Draco was the most attractive person ever.
"Took long enough, great, all you wrecks are here! As you know, this is saturday detention, which means no talking, no moving! You are to write on your parchments why you're here." Umbridge instructed.
Draco's first potions class goes simple enough, however, the tension escalates between his robot and Theodore during their flying lesson. Later that following night, Draco gets a letter from his father.
"The spells I casted beforehand will allow him to eat one meal per day...too much of it could cause immediate damage." Lucius warned.
"I'm such a bad person..here you are being so kind to me, while I just did something awful a little over an hour ago.." Draco frowned.
"This is another level of risk taking, let's go Hermione-" Harry moved, but of course a body had to knock him over.
"What are we gonna do then? Sit and talk? To me this just sounds like detention with a different room number." Draco snorted.
"How did Lucius get a hold of a robot? Tell him to contact my parents so they can get me one too!" Pansy cheers.
But things change, and Harry can't believe that he's about to enter a stadium for bloody singer, Harry Styles!
"I lived with him, I know way more than you do! Harry's been nothing but kind to you, he only did otherwise because you insulted his friend!" Draco protested.
"That's a shocking one..since you're my personal robot, I take it I can tell you anything?" Draco assumed.
"Follow me then, Potter." Draco guided. Harry hesitantly followed, very confused as to what Draco could possibly want..they hardly talked on a regular basis, so there had to be some sort of catch.
It starts out with Umbridge bringing everyone back to the library, Ginny defends herself, Luna likes her haircut, Hermione is trying to keep a high Harry on a low profile, but when Draco is accused of locking Umbridge in her office, a high Harry takes the blame instead.
"Ow." Harry grimaced, placing his hands on the ground to stand up, which was definitely a mistake once two big shoes stomped on them.
Draco apparated home, fighting the urge to cry..qt was so happy to receive Draco's green lily..of course, Draco didn't know if qt returned all of his feelings. But if he did, Draco simply forgot about him to cuddle Harry Potter of all people??
Having a personal robot is weird, but Draco's parents weren't lying about how beneficial Harry would be.
"You best be! Do you know how unprofessional the Malfoy's look with your atrocious mane?" Lucius ridiculed.
"It may not sound cool to your relatives, but your house doesn't define you as a person. You have well-dressed robes, a snake, amazing quidditch abilities..you're really strong and smart..you're hair is very cool, and you have the prettiest shade of eyes I ever seen." Harry compliments.
Harry could tell they were just being playful, but the arguing back and forth rattled his insides even more.
"I'll have you know that being a janitor comes with a lot of privilege..I see everything, what your lockers store, I know a lot about you all." Janitor Granger claimed.
"What is wrong with this door?! Mister Potter, I know you can hear me! Come open this!" Umbridge ordered.
"He already suffered with the pencil marks, he wouldn't want you to go through the same thing." Ginny explained.
"I am..qt, I'm s-so s-sorry. I sw-swear I d-don't like that o-other guy..s-sure he saved m-me from d-dying, but n-nobody compares to y-you." Draco swore.
Draco knew this made him look like such a git..and he hated himself for it. He's lucky that he woken an hour prior to the time he'd visit qt, he would feel 10x worse if he somehow missed it.
“Two that we… two-“ she stutters indignantly, “what are you on about Harry? How many do you… No don’t answer that!”
They’re not running to a particular place, or in any particular direction. Just away. Away from the people who seem intent on chasing them until their bones give out.
“I asked if you had enough of that essence of murtlap we need for potions this year.” She says, still looking at him weirdly. He needs her to stop looking at him like he would explode. He has had enough of people looking at him.
It doesn’t stop the whispering though. Witches and wizards alike, trying to be subtle as they point him out to their friends; relatives. He gets coy smiles and giggles, Ron does too which Hermione seems disapproving of as she glared at any witch who dares to ogle him. Hermione gets positively leered at and even Harry feels grimy from some of the stares as him and Ron try to shield her from the worst of them.
Apparently this was the wrong thing to say as he sees Hermione tap Ron’s arm, not-so-subtly gesturing for him to help her out.
Hermione is looking at him oddly as she nudges Ron subtly before whispering something in his ear. He looks at him as well and frowns as he regards Harry. Hermione had asked him something.
Except she had. Her monologue stops. She flinches. There’s a memorial on the side of the road. For Ollivander. She shakes herself, Harry can see she’s telling herself she’s fine, she’s alive, he knows because he’s done that too many times to count. She walks on.
“See this year won’t be drama free, eh mate,”Ron says, throwing an arm around Harry’s shoulder. The courtyard is almost empty now, Hermione, Ron and Harry stood in the middle watching as McGonagall guides the girl into the school, Malfoy having disappeared in seconds. Harry looks around for him, an odd little weight in his chest when he can’t find him. Harry ignores it, telling himself it’s just old suspicion. “Come on. Let’s get this hell over with.”
He pulls on his shoes. He has things to do today. They’re all going back to Hogwarts tomorrow. Him included. Even though he has pleaded, begged even, at Kingsley’s feet to not make him go back to that place. That place where so many people died. People he loved. People he didn’t even know, but who died because of what? Oh right, because of him.
“Hermione enough.” Harry shouts, voice cold. They both stop. He rubs at his temples, trying in vain to ease the headache curling at his skull, but he winces as his thumb brushes over the reason for this entire argument earning a scoff from Hermione. “Just… enough.”
funny. When did you grow a sense of humour, hm?” He moves closer, his eyes boring into Malfoy’s. He could feel his own eyes gleam as he sees Malfoy’s flicker between his. “Was it the months you spent in Azkaban? Or the week you spent on trial?”
None of that is there of course. The courtyard is just the same as it had been the first time they walked into Hogwarts. But Harry can’t see it that way ever again. Not when he’s seen these cobbles bear what they have. The courtyard seems endless in memory.
He takes a swig of the open whisky bottle on the side, checking the label as it glides down his throat. He takes another gulp but the bottles empty. When did that happen? He can hardly remember. He didn’t need it, he’s drunk anyway. He’s always some degree of drunk now. It’s easier. It shuts the faces out. Fred, Lupin, Sirius, Tonks, Collin, Lavender, Cedric…
“Don’t worry. That yell wasn’t anything bad. Someone’s just going to get help okay?” He keeps his voice soft, “you’re okay. Can you tell me your name?”
He lifts her hands in front of her eyes, showing her   the blood. “Is it okay if i heal your hands?” He asks. The girl nods and he turns her left hand so her palm is facing upwards. He raises his wand very slowly as the girl watches his every move, before casting a light
"Being calm tends to spread, the more calm I appear, the more likely it is you'll be." Luna explained.
"Affirmative! Invite Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Daphne Greengrass, Theodore Nott, Pansy Parkinson, and Blaise Zabini. Say to arrive at 6, and also make sure that my parents don't see them." Draco instructed.
"Before I go, I wanted to say sorry..for how obnoxious I acted when I had the drugs in my system." Harry laughs.
Draco had a lot of shopping to do with his parents, all for his 1st year at Hogwarts. Harry would even see Draco get his wand, and it would look even more impressive.
"I was embarrassed after the match, everyone said it was small..so that clearly boosted my confidence." Harry slumped.
Harry entered the boys locker room, he knew Theodore and Draco were in there somewhere. If they wanted to skip lacrosse practice, they should've at least let him join.
At first, Harry was beyond pissed about Draco..he drove Harry to his level of stupidity..but also, Draco wouldn't have known, so it wasn't even his fault..Harry was just hurt.
Number 1, he's very supporting, number 2, his style was great, number 3, his music was incredibly written, number 4, he had an amazing voice, and to top it all off, he was into women and men..just like Harry.
Luna and Pansy drag Draco out to lunch, he wanted to stay home and email qt..what makes it more unbearable, is that the golden trio was eating lunch with them. They didn't torment each other, or use any childish antics like that..but it's always awkward having lunch with your prior rivals..and even weirder to get drunk with them.
Harry can't tell Pansy or Hermione about his conversation with Draco, but things get heated during lunch when people start accusing Thomas and Finnigan of shagging.
"No! Don't you understand!? If Umbridge finds out I told you 4 or any other teacher, she'll give me the pencil! Then she'll somehow convince my father that I'm a liar!" Harry revealed.
Harry was beginning to feel at ease, but now that Hermione wasn't answering, he felt a knot in his stomach twist.
"There's no need to be jealous of her, she is nowhere as smart and interesting as you." Luna spoke up.
"I do, but I like you the most..these past few months have been the happiest moments of my life." Harry poked Draco's right cheek.
Growing up Harry always admired concerts, but of course, he was never eligible to attend thanks to his awful relatives.
"Quit gaping like a fish..I've assembled a personal robot for you, addressed by the name Harry." Lucius explained.
"Well you see, I recently came out as gay and my mom was like "you must be dating some bloke!" To put it shortly, I'm dating Theodore Nott, and we've known each other for years, which means my mom absolutely adores him..but the only downfall is that mother thinks we're dating..you and I." Draco explained.
Harry knew Draco, he knew when Draco was upset, and right now was one of those moments. Harry noticed that Draco always seemed to avoid the topic of when it came to the school dance. He didn't wanna annoy his friend and pry about it, but when something's up with Draco, Harry wants to know.
"Well, turns out they were..and of course Thomas dates Ginny, Ron finds out they cheated, he gets mad, and then they fight. That's pretty much it." Harry explained.
Draco wasn't dumb he obviously knew what the spell would do..but blimey, did this mean Planter P wanted to touch him?! He needed to mentally prepare himself before the clock hit..Draco needed to think rational. Planter P was clearly distressed, and this was him simply calming his friend down..nothing to overthink, right??
Draco preferred to stay out of life risking danger, however, Harry was right. If his robot were to be in danger, he'd have no choice but to take a stance. Harry's only been his robot for a short three months, but he really meant a lot to Draco..
"Uh, Draco? Now that I finally have my phone, do you wanna trade numbers or something?" Harry tried to ask casually.
"He's so daft, why did he cover for me?? I have a pocket-knife, I could've defended myself." Draco shook his head.
