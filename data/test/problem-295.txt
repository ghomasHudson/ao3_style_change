“Someone's excited about something," he said, placing his food on the small coffee table. He grabbed the apple from the air and placed it on top of his sandwich. He waved his hand and cast a Stasis Charm over his food, before he straightened up and turned to face me. “Why are you so happy?"
“The wizarding world will never to cease to amaze me. So, you're saying that you could get pregnant if you wanted to?"
“Harry's ex-boyfriend, Charlie Weasley." I said, taking a sip of my tea.
As we approached the doors, they swung open without a sound, and with no one there to open them. I led him up the steps and pulled him across the threshold. Harry paused and looked around the entryway.
I reached into my pocket and pulled out my pack of cigarettes. I removed a cigarette from the pack and then tossed the pack to him. He caught it in his hand. He looked at the pack for a moment before bursting out laughing.
“Well, why don't you stay with the Weasleys?" I asked.
“How can you say that? Don't you remember when you asked me about you dating other people? It pissed me off and I didn't answer you for almost ten minutes," he said. He looked down at the guitar next to him, before he looked back up at me.
He let out a soft groan as my magic began to take effect. I began to move my hand slowly around the bruise. He let out a little moan and I opened my eyes. His eyes were closed and his head was thrown back against the wall.
She walked away and I opened my menu. Harry leaned across the table and pointed out where the drinks were listed on the menu. Suddenly, two glasses of water were placed on the table. I looked up. There was a young woman standing there, her name tag reading Joanna.
Kingsley looked like I just announced that Voldemort had come back from the dead. “Are you serious? You're dating Lucius Malfoy's son? Merlin Harry, what are you thinking?" He asked.
“I did, but the doors were locked and he didn't answer when I called out to him," Hermione said.
“You want to know something? I never would have thought that
----------
“Did you want something, Draco?
I let out a heavy sigh, and raised my head to look at him. “Well, Harry, right now I don't think there should be an ´us'," I said. Harry looked down, crestfallen. I reached out my hand and gently cupped his cheek, tilting his head so he would look at me. “Now, hear me out about this. I'm not saying that I don't want us to be together. I mean, come on Harry, I've wanted this since we were thirteen. But I was thinking earlier that maybe our problems developed because we jumped into being a couple too quickly."
“Normally, that's what I get. I have a lot on my mind and needed something stronger."
“Does that mean I get to ride in your car this time?" Pansy asked, coming up to where the rest of us were.
Before I could respond, Draco caught my hand and shoved me into the fireplace with my boxes. He threw some floo powder down and shouted ´The Serpent's Den'. Everything vanished in a swirl of color.
“Hello Auror Sanders. Tell me, what's going on with the prisoners today," Kingsley said as he stepped up to the desk.
I thought. I squeezed my way through the doorway and the door shut behind me.
“Don't you remember? You snapped your fingers and the bottle of lubricant flew into your hand."
(Personal note: This chapter might be the longest one that I've done so far. It certainly will have a lot of sections, but it will all be done in Draco's point of view.)
I slid into the booth on the opposite side of him. He turned his head and smiled slightly when he noticed me sitting. A strange little shiver slid down my spine at his smile. I shook my head, and noticed for the first time the rose colored liquid in the glass in front of him.
“Oh, really? I have proof of you saying you didn't care if I wanted to die."
While celebrating Draco's twenty seventh birthday, Ron catches Draco kissing another guy. Ron tells Harry, who leaves.
“Well, I told him I was bringing my boyfriend, but I didn't say who. I thought it would be fun to see the look on his face."
I had just finished placing the blanket over my lap when Kreacher reappeared, holding a tray with my breakfast. He looked at the blanket for a moment, eying it like he had the first time he had ever seen it, shaking his head at the way it was wrinkled. He balanced the tray in one hand, before running his free hand over the blanket to smooth out the wrinkles. He then placed the tray over my lap. He bowed again, then disappeared with another pop. I picked up a piece of toast and nibbled on the edge of it, watching the flames dance in the fireplace.
With a sigh, I pulled out my wand and began to clean up. The first flick of my wand made the dishes rise from the table and scrape themselves into the trash bin. Then they drifted to the sink and stacked themselves neatly. Another flick of my wand and the sink turned on, water splashing on the dishes as the bottle of dish soap tipped over and squirted a little bit into the sink. I stepped over and picked up Charlie's chair. I pointed my wand at the wax on the table and it disappeared. The dishes were washing themselves, rattling gently as they clinked against each other.
“Are you sure? Not about him, but about going through with..." I trailed off, not really wanting to voice what I wanted from him.
Hermione looked up. “Harry, I'm so glad that you came. Come, meet Rose, your goddaughter."
“You didn't have to do that," Potter said. I shrugged. “By the way, I'm not lying about what happened."
“Well, excuse me, but there are some others I need to say hi to," I said. I made my way through the kitchen and into the living room. Hermione was stretched out on the couch, her hand resting on her slightly swollen belly. Percy and Penelope were standing by the front window, brushing soot off their clothes. Mrs. Weasley stood next to a young woman that I assumed was Penelope's sister next to a large pile of presents. There was also a birthday cake that read ´Happy 60th Arthur' and had an owl made of icing flying around the edge.
He grinned at me before wrapping his lips around the head of my dick. I moaned and thrust my hips upwards. Harry immediately placed his hands on my hips and pinned them down. He pulled away from me. “Draco, were going at my pace, remember? Try to stay still," he chided me.
Several cheers and whistles suddenly erupted around us. Harry broke the kiss. I blinked several times and looked around. Nearly everyone in the place was watching us. They were clapping. A blush spread across my cheeks.
“Actually, your mother is watching her today. She really wants to see you happy again. She told me yesterday that she hasn't seen you smile since your party," Hermione said, her attention on the road. The way she drove was so secondhand nature to her, that she didn't seem to really pay much attention to what she was doing.
“Oh how sickeningly sweet of you; you actually care about him. News flash Potter; Draco's a Death Eater as well. If the wizarding world wants to lock up the Death Eaters, why is he still free?" Father asked, sounding very pleased with himself.
“Why a Muggle bar?" Mother asked.
“I guess Harry and I should get going. You need to get some rest," Draco said. He stood up from the side of the bed and leaned over to give her a hug. Narcissa looked at me for a moment, then gestured me forward. I moved closer and bent down as her arms wrapped around me a little awkwardly. The hug was brief, but I appreciated it.
“Look, this table is big enough to hold four people. It's not like you have to sit right next to me," Potter said, turning his head to look out the window.
“Why did you bring me here?" He asked. I knew he was probably remembering the last time he had been here; when Voldemort's supporters had brought him and his friends here. I had tried to protect them all by lying to my family that it wasn't Harry Potter that they had captured. His friend Granger still had gotten tortured by my aunt.
“Why did you say it was alright for me to be with someone else? That seems kinda stupid," I said, folding my arms against my chest.
“But why not tell me? You and I have always told each other everything," he said. It sounded like he was ready to cry.
Harry pressed a quick kiss to my lips before he released me. “We should get going. Kingsley will be waiting for us. Just remember, Draco, we're in this together."
“That response is exactly the reason that we came up with this idea. The four of you were raised in pureblood households and I know three of you were raised that purebloods are better than half-bloods, Muggle-borns, and Muggles themselves," Harry said folding his arms.
The gates swung open. Harry drove through them, turning left onto the road. We drove in silence for a while, Harry easily turning the car onto different roads. “So, where are we going exactly?" I asked, the silence finally getting to me.
“I said it, because I knew that's what you wanted me to say! It was your idea for us to slow down and become friends first! You wanted to fix our relationship! What was I supposed to say when you were practically begging me if I'd be okay with you dating other people while we work on our friendship?"
Harry began to kiss his way down my body. He gently traced each scar with his tongue, before moving farther down to my belly button. He dipped his tongue into it, before tracing around the edge with just the tip of his tongue. He moved lower and caught the waistband of my pajama pants and my boxers with his fingers. He pulled them down just enough to free my erection.
“Oh, Harry, this is Chase. Chase Reynolds. He's a veterinarian," Pansy said excitedly.
I made my way to the bedroom. I pushed the door open and walked into the familiar room. I picked up a few of my things from the nightstand and the top of the bureau. I laid my things on the bed and turned to the wardrobe. I pulled open the doors and began to look through the items inside.
“Gods, I'm so stupid. I have to talk to him," I said, standing up from the marble bench I was sitting on. I turned around and walked up the stone path to the Manor. I pushed open the door and paused in my tracks, not knowing where Draco would be.
“I think he still likes you."
“Sure. Meet me at the Leaky Cauldron around two. I know a place we can go."
“I told you I was bringing my boyfriend with me."
I pushed myself up on my elbows and looked down at him. His eyes were closed, but I couldn't tell if he was still sleeping. His short, red hair was mused where I had dragged my fingers through it during the night. The freckles spattered across his nose were barely visible anymore, but they were there nonetheless. There was a fresh burn on his skin, right in the spot where his neck connected with his shoulder. He was always coming home with burns and scratches from the dragons that he worked with, but it never seemed to bother him. I gently traced my fingers around the burn, then leaned down to press my lips against it.
“Their not mad that we hid our relationship; well most of them aren't. He wouldn't talk to me," he said, hanging his head.
“Sure, unless you know someone else with the name Potter," Marko answered. His hand was still poised over the Firewhisky, waiting for me to decide if I wanted it.
He sighed. “Draco, look at me," he said. I raised my head, but kept my eyes down. “No, I said look at me," he repeated. I raised my eyes and looked into his green ones. “You want to know why I broke the kiss and pushed you away? Because I was so turned on, that if I hadn't gotten away from you when I did, I would have dragged you to the floor," he said, staring into my eyes.
~~~~~
I bit back the sharp words on the tip of my tongue. Of course I was feeling guilty about the whole situation, but I wasn't going to admit it. My feelings of betrayal were a lot stronger than my feelings of guilt. I forced myself to look into Seamus' eyes. “Personally, I don't care if he wants to kill himself. I'm done with him and I could care less if he decided to get married to Blaise right now. If you'll excuse me, I have other things to be doing than having this conversation." The words were like poison on my tongue. I didn't mean them at all. I pushed myself to my feet, and made my way towards Dean.
Harry raised his head, breathing heavily as he looked down at me. “If you really want me to stop, push me away. I can't resist you anymore, and I'm not even going to try," he said.
“I wanted to talk to you," he answered. He turned the key and the oh so familiar, but long time missed, purr of the engine came to life.
My birthday party was in full swing. I glanced around the foyer of the Manor, taking in the unbelievable sight before me; my friends and Harry's friends, once former enemies, actually getting along with each other. I saw Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan laughing with Theodore Nott and Gregory Goyle in one corner of the room. Blaise and Pansy were talking to Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom not to far away from her.
Harry and I sat down on a couple of chairs, both declining Sanders offer for a drink. She left us alone in the small room, walking out the door and closing it gently behind her. I glanced around the room and shuddered slightly as I remembered when I had been brought to this room while I had waited for my trial after the war. I looked down at the table as the memory assaulted me.
“I told you, this place was packed when I got here. Wait a minute, you've had at least twelve Firewhiskys, how the Hell are you still sober?" I asked.
I thanked him, then turned around and walked towards Draco. He had nodded off again, his chin dropped to his chest. I placed my hand on his shoulder and cast a silent
He caught my wrists and pinned them to the wall above my head. “I'm gonna prove that you want me," he said before he leaned down and crushed his lips to mine. I tried to pull away, but he pressed his body closer to me, effectively cutting off my struggling.
Before long, we pulled into the parking lot of an amusement park that I vaguely remembered. “I've been here before. Once. When I was little," I said.
I chuckled as I straightened up. Percy and Penelope were now watching me. Percy moved forward and held out his hand. “Good to see you again Harry," he said as I shook his hand.
WARNING: This chapter contains EXPLICIT content. If you don't want to read about two males having sex, I would suggest that you skip this entire chapter.
I sighed, closing my eyes as I thought about how my life has changed in the past two months. Mine and Harry's relationship had grown during the course of the last two months. Most days, we were inseparable and could be found lounging around on the sofa in the bedroom; reading, playing chess or just cuddling together. That is, when we weren't in the Manor library.
“Why did you even go out with him? After what happened at the bowling alley, I'd have thought that you would understand Harry's feelings," Ron said. He turned his head and glared at me. “Besides, didn't you go out with him on two dates?"
“I was there that night. Dumbledore jinxed me so I couldn't move or speak and he covered me with my invisibility cloak. I saw it all. But you shouldn't feel bad about it. Snape was a spy for Dumbledore and they actually had the whole thing planned out between them."
“I know what I said, but he won't accept my apology now, not after I went on a date with Chase," I said, feeling bile in my throat at the admission.
He sighed. “Right now, I don't even want to think about him. I want a chance to be happy, even if it's just for a few hours. He's been sort of pushing me away for the past couple of weeks."
Harry didn't respond, but he began to pick up his pace, sliding in and out more quickly. I gasped when his hand slid between our bodies and his fingers wrapped around my dick. He began fisting my shaft, sliding up and down my length in perfect rhythm with each of his thrusts. I moaned loudly and thrust my hips upwards into his hand. He tightened his fingers on my shaft and moved his hand a little faster.
“Yes, but he looks worse than I did. Do you want to call the rest of the day off?"
“Harry, you are moving into Malfoy Manor this morning, and Mother does not tolerate tardiness of any kind."
She sighed. “I would have done so if I could have. In pureblood families, only the Head of the family has any say whatsoever. If I had left, Lucius could have had me thrown in Azkaban for leaving without his permission. Same thing with divorce; purebloods can only divorce if the Patriarch wants it. Now my family didn't abide by that, but Lucius' did." Shock flowed through me, but before I could comment, the memory solidified, showing a different moment from the past.
“Sleeping in the bed with me isn't the same thing. And the last couple of nights you've slept in the guest room." The tears started to spill down my cheeks.
I glanced down and saw that I was only wearing my boxers. I snapped my fingers and summoned Draco's house robe from the bed. I slipped it over my shoulders and belted it around my waist. I rounded the sofa and took the pot of floo powder from the mantle. I knelt on the floor in front of the fireplace. I took some floo powder in my hand and threw it down on the hearth. The familiar green flames burst into existence. I took a breath before plunging my head into the flames, calling out “Ministry of Magic, Minister's office".
“He did. One day, he left. About two days later, he came back to get his things. Haven't seen him since. Haven't been to that apartment since either."
“Oh, good. That gives us plenty of time to finish our meals and show you to your room," Mother said.
I stood staring out our kitchen window, pretty much the same spot I had stood in since my arrival back at our apartment two hours ago. My cloak laid abandoned on the couch where I had thrown it. The cup of tea on the counter in front of me had long since gone cold.
“What do you mean?" I asked. I raised my mug to my lips and took a sip from my tea.
With another wave of her wand, small little plates and forks flew in our direction. Suddenly loud voices could be heard from the other room. “Just let it go, Percy!" Charlie yelled.
I glanced over my shoulder at him. He had stood up from the couch and was watching me slightly. I nodded briefly. “So, what things do I need to sort through?" I asked him.
“Tea?"
“Since he's in prison, all the power goes to my mother. If I say that I want to marry you, for example, she could allow it and Father wouldn't be able to stop us," I said.
Draco began slowly, pulling his hips back before sliding forward again. He kept his hand gliding up and down my shaft. “Draco, more," I whimpered. He obeyed instantly, snapping his hips forward and burying himself to the hilt. He began thrusting faster and harder. He dropped his hand away from my dick and caught my hips in both hands, dragging me against him. I wrapped my own fingers around my shaft and jerked in rhythm to his thrusts.
He rolled off of me and we both just laid there panting, trying to get ourselves under control. Harry snapped his fingers and my arms were released from the headboard. I slowly lowered my arms, glad to ease the stiffened muscles.
Harry rolled his eyes, but slid his belt through his belt loops. He fastened his belt, and placed the matching navy blue tie around his neck. I couldn't resist walking forward, grabbing the ends of his tie in my hands. I looked up into his green eyes as I tied his tie for him. I adjusted the knot against his throat, and stepped back before I could kiss him. He looked at me for a moment, then picked up the navy blue vest from the bed, the last piece of his clothing that I had laid out, besides his dress shoes. He slipped the vest on and buttoned the two buttons. He held out his arms. “Do I pass?" He asked, jokingly.
“HARRY JAMES POTTER!!"
“That's good," Harry said.
He turned his head to look at me. “What do you mean, Harry?"
“I'm fine. Can we just continue the game? Ron, you're up," I said, not looking up.
“Well, by the time you got a hold of me, I had already been asked to come by Harry. He thought it would be funny to surprise you when I told you no, then showed up anyway," Theo laughed. He sat down on Harry's other side.
“Let your instincts guide you, Draco. Just follow the things that I have done to you," Harry said.
“Just tell me. I can handle it. Remember, I took down Voldemort," I said.
. I tilted my head, looking up at the underside of his strong chin. I pressed a kiss to the column of his throat, before I pushed myself slightly away from his embrace.
I was unaware of how long I had laid on the floor. My tears had stopped long ago, but I hadn't had the strength to pick myself up. I raised my eyes to look at her.
He had rolled over at some point. He was now lying on his side, facing the far wall. I draped my robe over the foot of his bed. I walked around the bed and slid under the covers next to him, so that I was facing him. I let one arm slide around his waist and pulled him closer to me.
“Open your eyes, Draco," he whispered. I dragged my eyes open to find him kneeling on the bed, rubbing the lube around his shaft. I moaned as I watched his large, tan hand sliding along his shaft. I tugged on my bonds one more time. When they still didn't budge, I once again gave up and just watched the sight in front of me. Harry released his shaft and moved between my legs. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he positioned his dick at my entrance.
“When I caught a glimpse of him, he was running towards the Quidditch pitch. He might still be somewhere outside," Mother said. She turned back to the parchment in front of her.
“I'll meet you back at the table," I said. With that I made my way out the door.
I unlocked the doors and we slid in. As I stuck the key in the ignition, Draco rubbed his hand over the red leather seat. The engine purred to life as soon as I turned the key. I pulled out of the parking lot and smoothly slid in behind Ron's car as he pulled up to a stop sign. He continued forward, and after a brief stop, I followed him. I knew I would have to follow him to his house; the only way I knew how to get to his house was by apperating.
“I remember that," Ron said.
“Why'd you do it Blaise? What happened to all of us getting along like we have for the last couple hours?" I asked. I was genuinely confused.
“I've done nothing wrong. You've got nothing on me, Hermione," he said, but there was a spark of fear in his eyes.
I felt like I was going to be sick. I now had to tell my best mate what a jerk his older brother was. Fortunately for me, Draco spoke up first. “Your brother was an arse who got what he deserved."
“I love you, Harry," I whispered, pressing a kiss to his collarbone.
“Harry, don't worry about last night. I think we both can agree that our argument got a little out of control. By the way, how's your hip?"
Charlie looked stunned by what just happened. He knelt down next to me. He reached out to me, stuttering out apologies.
“Well, to be honest Harry, he couldn't tell you because of Lucius. Lucius probably would have murdered Draco in his sleep if he knew he was gay and that he fancied The Boy Who Lived."
Hermione was shaking her head as I told my tale. The look on her face mirroring what I felt inside. “And Harry wouldn't let you explain? He didn't use Legilimency on you?"
I swallowed hard, before I pulled my wand from my pocket. I took a breath and lifted the glamour off my wrists. My arms were shaking as I held them towards Harry.  Harry gently caught my hands in his and turned my arms over, exposing the scars to his gaze. He stared at them for a moment, then he released my right hand and gently ran his fingers over the scar on my left wrist. Before I could pull my hand away, Harry leaned down and gently pressed his lips to the scar.
Sanders raised her head and looked at me, then turned her eyes to Kingsley. He nodded at her. “Well, Lucius Malfoy managed to throw Auror Jensen against the wall and took his wand. He had somehow slipped out of his cell when Jensen found him. Almost made it to the end of the corridor before he was stunned by me," she said.
“Now that you mention it, I remember that. However, this discussion can wait until later. Mother is waiting for us," I said. I waved my wand at the pile of clothes I had laid out for him when I had gotten up. The clothes flew over to him and landed next to him on the floor. He stared at me for a moment, then looked down at the clothes. He rolled his eyes but stood up with the clothes in his arms. He laid the clothes on the bed and sat down.
Ron nodded. I climbed out of the car and shut the door. I turned around to face the house as Ron pulled away. I squared my shoulders, took a deep breath, then made my way slowly towards the door. It opened before I reached it, revealing Neville standing there.
“I know I can heal it. However, it does require me to put my hands on you. For my Healer's magic to work, I literally have to touch the injured area. I won't help you unless I have your express permission."
The mirror exploded, glass flying in every direction. A small shard of glass hit my cheek as it flew past. The brief bite of pain that rippled through my skin sent a shot of adrenaline throughout my body. I raised my hand to my stinging cheek, letting the wound close. Without giving myself time to tell myself that this was wrong, I grabbed a large piece of glass, placed it to my wrist and pulled sharply. I cried out as the glass ripped through my skin, but I enjoyed the pain as well. I watched my blood drip into the sink. Within seconds, the blood stopped as my Healer's magic closed the wound. I placed the glass on the other wrist and repeated the action. I sucked in a sharp breath at the bite of pain.
“You got a problem with me, Parkinson?" Harry asked. He didn't look at them but I could see his jaw clench.
~~~~~
I took a step forward and Charlie stepped into my way. I went to step around him and he stepped into my way again, effectively blocking me.
I didn't favor her with a response. Instead, I picked up my drink and took a large swallow. I coughed slightly as the alcohol burned down my throat, stronger than before. Ron and Hermione stared at me, then glanced at each other and shook their heads. Theo and Pansy stared at me for a second, then turned back to watch Draco. I glared at any one of them that glanced at me. The game continued, with me giving them all the silent treatment. Draco seemed a little hurt that I had fallen silent, but I ignored the looks of confusion he kept sending me.
“And you won't say no to sex now and then, right?" I teased.
That made Kingsley and the Aurors all smile. Kingsley motioned us forward and we surrounded the table. “Alright, everyone. On the count of three, reach out and touch the portkey. One, two, three," Kingsley cried. As one, we surged forward and pressed our fingers to the teapot. Again I felt like a hook had caught me behind my navel and pulled.
“So, how much further do we have to walk?" I asked. I noticed that he still held my hand.
“Hard to picture the Wizarding World's Golden Boy as being gay," I replied with a shrug.
I turned around. “Look, Potter, I may dislike you, but even I have a heart. You look like you've been crying and I was curious if you're okay. I don't really like to see people upset."
I kissed my way up his leg, along his hipbone and across his stomach. I pulled back and placed a kiss to the head of his dick. He moaned. I planted open-mouth kisses along his length, occasionally letting my tongue slide around it. I brought myself back to the head. I wrapped the fingers of my right hand around the base of his dick and sealed my mouth around the head, sucking slightly.
I didn't answer, just continued eating. My mind flashed back to the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. The task was to collect a golden egg from a nesting mother dragon. My dragon for the task had been a Hungarian Horntail.
Draco runs into Harry at a bar. After Harry gets Firewhisky spilled on him, he goes to the bathroom to clean himself up. Draco follows him and things quickly turn heated.
I moved away from the window as a wave of grief threatened to bring me to my knees. I grabbed my cup of tea and moved towards the living room. I sat down on the couch and tucked my legs underneath me. With a wave of my wand, I cast a warming charm on my tea. I held it in my hands and let the warmth seep through me.
I groaned softly before waving my wand to make the numbers disappear. I waved my hand and levitated my wand back to the nightstand. I turned towards Draco and pulled him closer to me. He snuggled deeper into my side as I wrapped my arms around him. I let out a soft sigh as I closed my eyes, and drifted back off to sleep.
I wrapped my arms around him and pulled him closer to me. I swiped my tongue across his lips and he opened his mouth easily. Our tongues slid against each other. I moaned in the back of my throat. Draco broke the kiss when we heard Ron clearing his throat. Draco and I were both panting heavily. There was an uncomfortable tightness in the front of my jeans, and I knew Draco could feel it by the way his pale cheeks darkened. He untangled his fingers from my hair, and gently straightened my glasses across my nose.
I glanced over to where he was sitting on the edge of the fountain, then I turned my gaze towards the Manor. “I don't get it either. He wanted me to move back in, we shared the bedroom for about three days, then he made me move back into the Gryffindor bedroom. He's turned cold towards me. I feel like an unwanted guest here, much like I felt with the Dursley's," I said. I buried my face in my hands.
I heard Blaise behind me, but I didn't focus on that. I watched as Ron made it to the foyer and disappeared through the door. I put on a burst of speed, trying to reach him. When I entered the foyer, I saw that I was too late. On the other side of the room, Ron placed his hand on Harry's arm to get his attention. Harry looked at him and when Ron started whispering to him, Harry shook his head and glanced in my direction.
“That's what his father always did to him. Abraxas Malfoy was never much of a father; always putting Lucius down, beating him when Lucius displeased him. When Lucius first found out that I was pregnant with Draco, he vowed that he would be a better father than Abraxas. But as you clearly have seen, he wasn't any better."
“Apparation charms. You can apparate from room to room, but no one can apparate directly into the Manor. You can even apparate out of the Manor," I said. I dropped my arms from around him and stepped up to the gates. I pulled out my wand and tapped it against the iron bars.
I sighed as he pressed his lips to mine. I pulled away quickly. “Hang on Harry," I said and tightened my grip on his hand. I twisted and we disapparated again. We landed in front of a large set of double doors. The doors were nothing special; they were a deep grey and had serpents for door handles. I paused and turned to Harry.
“So, can I ask again how you two got together in the first place?" Ron asked.
“Alright you two. You don't need to embarrass my husband. Come on, I have dinner ready. I made spaghetti," Hermione said, appearing in the kitchen doorway.
“Arcade? What is an arcade?" I whispered, slowly raising my head. The nausea and dizziness were slowly fading away.
“Harry, just tell me who you slept with last night. Please."
“You really think that I'm the embarrassment here, Mr. Potter? My so called son won't last long when the whole wizarding world knows that he's dating the
“Have a good night, Draco. See you tomorrow." He pressed another quick kiss to my lips, then he turned around and disappeared into his room. It took all of my strength to stop myself from following him. I took a step back and twisted on the spot, making my way home.
“I got it, Krista," Harry's voice said. I glanced towards the sound of his voice and saw him walking around the end of the bar, his black hair now pulled back into a small ponytail. He moved quickly towards the end of the bar where I was sitting. He reached up and pulled down a glass tumbler. He filled it with ice. Krista stared at him as he dumped ice in a black metal shaker. He began grabbing different bottles of liquor and pouring various amounts from each bottle into the shaker. He put the lid on the shaker and began shaking it up. After a few seconds, he opened the shaker and poured it into the tumbler. He passed it to the man before Krista finally found her voice.
" I asked.
“Harry it's not like that, I promise. If you don't believe me, look in my mind." My own eyes filled with tears.
“Hey Draco, Pansy," he said. I smiled slightly.
My gift was last and as he picked it up, a lump formed in my throat. I knew what was behind the wrapping paper. He glanced at me as he pulled the ribbon off. He looked back down at the package as he ripped open the wrapping paper. The black leather photo album fell into his lap. He picked it up and opened it. Without a word, he continued to flick through the pictures, occasionally letting out soft chuckles. When he reached the middle of the photo album, he stopped as tears filled his eyes. I knew what picture had made him stop. It was a picture of the family when we had gone to the Quidditch World Cup. Fred was in that picture.
“Well, let's get to it. And Ron, we'll eat when we get to the other place. Try not to focus on your stomach," I said. We headed around the arcade; Pansy and Draco following me over to the hunting game in the corner, Theo headed towards the racing game, and Ron and Hermione headed towards the pinball machine.
Alan sighed. “Mr. Webster, collect your things, and turn in your apron. This is not the first time a customer has complained about sexual harassment from you, but it will be the last. Apparently, being suspended for two weeks did nothing. Wait for me in the office."
I spun around to face Blaise when he placed his hand on my shoulder. “Get! Out!" I growled through my teeth.
“You okay, luv?" Charlie asked. I turned towards the bathroom, and he was standing there with nothing but a blue towel around his waist. I nodded, a blush spreading across my cheeks, letting my eyes travel down his body. I licked my lips. “Not now, Harry." he said with a chuckle. He walked up to the end of the bed and picked up his jeans from the night before. As I moved to the bed to pull on my socks and shoes, Charlie stepped over to the bureau, opened a drawer, and pulled out a pair of black boxers. I looked away as he started to unwind the towel from his waist. I concentrated on my feet because if I watched him get dressed, we would really be late to the party.
I leaned down and buried my face against his shoulder as I let myself cry. Draco rubbed his hand up and down my back, making soothing sounds in my ear. We stood there for several moments as I cried. Hermione just sat there on the bed and watched us. When my sobs quit and I was hiccuping every so often, I finally raised my head from Draco's shoulder.
“So what if I did? Why do you care?" He replied. His voice was steady and the slurring was gone. He sat up straighter in his seat.
“Well, you're not around anymore. What else am I going to do in my free time?"
----------
“No, that part was true. I meant him breaking up with me was a lie.
I thought about that for a moment. This was Narcissa Malfoy, wanting to bear her soul to me and show me things about her son that I couldn't possibly imagine. I really wanted to understand what Draco had been like before, but still I hesitated; I really wasn't too comfortable with viewing Narcissa's personal memories, even with her permission.
“Harry Potter, as I live and breath."
We sat there for a moment, letting my breathing return to normal. Draco suddenly raised his hand, and pressed his thumb against my bruised lips. I felt his magic again as he moved his thumb back and forth. When my lips were healed, he dropped his gaze down to where my hands rested in my lap.
When I next opened my eyes, I discovered that Draco and I had rolled over so that I was spooning him. His back was pressed against my chest, his arse against my groin. My right arm was under the pillow beneath his head and my left was wrapped around his waist. My face was buried against his neck. I breathed in, enjoying his scent as it tickled my nose. He sort of smelled like a forest after a rainstorm. I pressed my left hand to his stomach. I gently began tracing one of the scars that I had caused with the Sectumsempra curse ten years ago.
“I didn't want you to regret your decision about moving in here. I wanted you to be able to call this place home," I said. I waved my hand towards the desk. “That bookcase holds some books that I thought would be of interest to you. Books on Quidditch, books on animagus forms, things like that."
“Merlin, Malfoy. Don't want to know about your wanking habits," Ron cried out.
Before Hermione could respond, I heard the sounds of feet heading in our direction. We both turned towards the kitchen and much to my disappointment, Jolene was standing there with her breakfast on a tray like mine.
“Hey, Kingsley. Listen, I need a favor."
We landed roughly, my feet sliding on the rug in front of the fireplace, and Draco stumbled out of my grasp. I caught him before he fell. We stared at each other for a moment, then I dropped my arms. I leaned down and pressed a quick kiss to his lips.
The sound of chains dragging along stone reached our ears. The three of us turned towards the door as it was thrown open. Robards and Briggs came through the door, my father in chains between them. I could only stare at him; a lot had changed with him in the last two years since I had last seen him. His pale blonde hair hung halfway down his back; it was tied at the base of his neck with a small strip of black cloth. His clothes were now slightly baggy on his thin frame. His Azkaban prison tattoo that had been burned into his skin was visible just above the collar of his shirt.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I really don't see how you can use that. It makes no sense for a twenty-six year old wizard to use Muggle things. Your phone, your car. Harry, I just don't understand it," he said, his voice barely above a whisper so we wouldn't draw attention to ourselves.
When my feet touched down in Kingsley's office, I actually managed to stay standing. Kingsley dismissed the Aurors. After they left, Kingsley slumped in his chair, head dropping down to his desk. “Oh this has been a long day."
“I didn't mean those words. I was very upset when Seamus told me that you had been in St. Mungo's. Draco, I don't want you to die, especially if it's because of me."
Harry must deal with the fall out of his treatment of Draco. He also suffers from strange magic.
I pulled my hand away from his. “I'm not jealous, Draco. I just have something on my mind." I said. I forced myself to relax.
“When you told me that Lucius would punish you when you displeased him, I didn't believe you. But after today..." he shook his head, unable to finish his sentence.
With a low growl in the back of her throat, Hermione moved forward and pinned Carlos to the wall, with her arm at the base of his throat. She had her wand in her other hand and the wand tip was pressed deep against his stomach. Carlos' eyes widened, but he didn't utter a word. “Alright you pathetic worm! You better tell me something, or I'll tell Kingsley that you've violated your probation," she growled out. Her voice was pitched low, and the threat was more real than if she had shouted.
I let out a heavy sigh and threw the covers off my legs. I swung my legs over the side of the bed and I stood up, glad I had put on pajama pants before I went to bed. “Alright, Draco. Lower your shields and let me see," I said, mentally preparing myself to use Legilimency.
“If we are going through with this, we'll be more alone here then anywhere else."
I felt my stomach drop slightly. This had been our chance to talk to Harry and it was gone before we had even really had a chance. I let my ´Malfoy Mask' slip into place, keeping my face schooled in boredom and not betraying what I was really feeling inside. It was almost like a knife had been driven into my gut as I realized that I was not going to get the chance to see Harry.
“Morning, Charlie," I said. “I need to talk to you about last night."
I nodded and began making my way over to his massive fireplace. “Uhh, Harry?" I turned around to face him. “If you're going to floo call the Minister, you might want to put some clothes on," he said, pointing.
“Harry, I'm sorry. I know that you are in a relationship with someone, but I couldn't help myself. For some reason, I've wanted to do that all night." I blurted out. He didn't answer, just continued to rinse out his shirt.
“ Yeah, just the two of us. Can we get a booth if possible?"
“Harry, are you trying to ask me on a date?"
“Blaise, what is going on with you? Ever since you found out that Harry and I are involved with each other, you've been acting funny."
“You know, the bruise on your collarbone doesn't even touch the one on your neck, Charlie! If it came from the dragon's tail, it would be consistent."
“You became my friend, Draco. I'm loyal to my friends and helping friends when they need it is what I've always been good for. I better get going, but I'll see you soon," she said, stepping away from my embrace. I watched her walk away, smiling for the first time since my birthday party.
“So, Harry, what brings you in today?" Dean asked, sitting down on the stool in front of me.
“Exactly what I said. You said that you wanted this, so come over here and get it. Where's your Gryffindor bravery?
“And I didn't tell you because I didn't know if you were gay, and I didn't want to be rejected by you again. I mean, after all, you rejected my friendship in first year," Draco said. I turned my head back to look at him and found him looking down at his hands.
I looked down at the drink in my hand that I had completely forgotten about. I looked back to him.
“Go ahead and take him out the back door. It's probably closer to your car anyway," Peter said.
“You got a problem with that? I think you would be grateful to have the extra help, especially on a busy Thursday night."
“Well, to tell you the truth Harry, with the right spells and potions in place, and if I find the right person that I want to father my child, I can sufficiently give birth to my own kid. I learned that at St. Mungo's," I said, blushing.
When he emerged a couple moments later, he carried a small, flat, black velvet box in his hand. All I could do was stare at it as he approached the bed. Harry climbed up the bed and held the box out to me. I took the box with shaking hands.
Harry hesitated for a moment, then extended his hand towards me. As soon as I touched his skin, he breathed out a sigh. I felt his magic stabilize almost instantly. I studied his hand, noticing how much it had swollen. “Damn Harry. You hit him harder than you hit Charlie. Your palm is swollen," I said as I placed my palm over his.
“I had my interview at St. Mungo's today. Actually, I just came from there."
“I think you should talk to him, Harry. At least give him a chance to explain everything," he said gently.
“Not sure. We were downstairs when he started screaming. I apparated in here, and found him like this. Now, this is going to sound crazy, but those wounds don't appear to be real, but he cries out if their touched," I said. My heart was pounding, as I tried to think of a way to help him.
“Carlos Madole? Yeah, he's here. Do you want me to get him out here?" Steve asked. He glanced down at my wrists then looked back up at me. I shoved my hands into my pockets, hiding the scabs that were half healed on my wrists. “Draco, what happened?" He asked.
I pulled myself out before slamming back in quickly. I repeated the action over and over, grabbing his hips and pulling him against me as I thrust. He moaned loudly, his head thrashing back and forth more than it had been. I reached between our bodies and wrapped my hand around his dick. He groaned and thrust into my hand.
“I should have trusted you. I should have given you a chance to explain. My own insecurities from my previous relationships made me blind and mistrustful. I'm so very sorry, my love."
Harry was silent for a moment as he followed behind the Tahoe that Hermione was driving. “Well, when we visited Lucius in Azkaban, you told me before that he turned violent because you told him you're gay. But according to the memories your mother showed me, you told him back when you were sixteen. I guess my question is, why did you have to tell him again? Shouldn't he have already known?"
Sanders rose from her desk and led Harry and I through the door on the right. We followed her down the hallway and down a small flight of stairs. She turned left and led us into a small room. There was a small table and a few chairs in the room. A large mirror took up one wall; I knew it was a two-way, so that Kingsley could monitor the prisoners being interrogated. I had actually witnessed my mother's interrogation shortly after the war ended. On the floor, on either side of the table, large iron rings were fastened to the stone floor. The rings ensured that the criminals could be chained down so that they wouldn't be a danger to others in the room.
I glanced over my shoulder where Draco was still sitting at the end of the bar. Sure enough, I watched him as his head dropped to his chest, only for him to jerk back up. I sighed, knowing his body wasn't used to staying up this late. I glanced down at my watch.
“I'm not going anywhere right now."
“Sure, how about you sort through things, and I'll pack them in the boxes for you?"
I drove in silence, the only sound was Draco's snoring. When the gates of the Manor came into view, I drove closer to them, surprised when they opened. I pulled through them and followed the pathway around the Manor. I pulled into the underground garage and shut the engine off. I slid out of the car, rounded the hood, and opened Draco's door. With a snap of my fingers, his seatbelt became undone. I cast a silent feather light charm, and picked Draco up into my arms.
“I'm Alexis, the trainee bartender. Can I get you something to drink?" She asked me.
I thought.
“Well, it all started the day Rose was born. After I left the room, I was heading to the Apparation room. I wasn't looking where I was going, and I literally ran into Draco."
He smiled and grabbed the bottle. He placed a glass in front of him and poured a generous amount of Firewhisky into it. He then picked up a pitcher full of a gold colored liquid and added that to the glass. “Butterbeer and Firewhisky, just like every week," he said.
“Not sure. Maybe, before I would have said that it's because Mr. Potter is here. But no one's paid him any attention since he got here," Marko answered. His hand reached for the bottle of Firewhisky.
“Draco? Draco, honey, are you alright?" Mother asked. Her gentle hands lifted my face from the floor.
“Harry, do you regret last night?" I couldn't help but ask. He paused in the middle of pulling on his socks and shoes. He looked up at me. He was silent for a moment, and a little sliver of panic formed around my heart. I looked away from him, and stared at the floor.
“Okay. You two are good actors, because I'm guessing you live at Malfoy Manor."
“You don't have to say it. I'm a Legilimens. If I open myself up, I can find out on my own what you can't bring yourself to say." He looked at me, waiting for my response.
I ignored her and dragged the broken glass across my wrist again. I cried out as my skin ripped open once again. I had long since lost count of how many times I had already cut both of my wrists, only to have my Healer's magic close each wound. The physical pain seemed to lessen the emotional pain. The physical pain made me forget; if only for a little while.
He held up his hand to stop what I was going to say next. “Now it's my turn to be honest. I don't want to be your friend Draco; I want more. I want what we had before your birthday. It breaks my heart to hear that you went out with that guy twice and it hurts that you think I should be okay with it. I will never be okay knowing that you want to date other people while we're trying to fix things between us. I love you more than I've ever loved any of my ex's, and it scares me because that gives you the ultimate power to break my heart. I'm sorry, Draco, but I can't sit here with you anymore; it hurts too much."
I opened my eyes, looking at Harry's sleeping face on the pillow beside me. We laid on our sides facing each other. He looked so peaceful in his sleep, his dark lashes making little smudges against his cheeks. He had one arm around me and the other was tucked under my pillow. I gently removed myself from his embrace, slipping out of the bed without waking him.
“Well that might just mean he fell asleep. Or he could be in the library. He does like to read," I said.
Green flames roared to life as Draco emerged from the fireplace. “Oh, Harry," he said. He dropped to his knees beside me, one hand snaking around my waist to rest his palm against my stomach through my shirt. After a moment, he quickly tugged my shirt free from my waistband and slipped his hand under my shirt, now resting his palm against my bare skin.
“How can you say that? He cut his wrists because he was hurt that I left. I'm just as responsible for what he did to his wrists as I am for the four scars on his chest," I said.
“I'll just have some water, please," I said.
“I didn't mean for it to happen Charlie. I'm so sorry. I'll understand if you want me to leave or something,"
I felt Draco stiffen slightly next to me. “Yeah, I got my things. We were there on Sunday," I said. I put down the chunk of sandwich I was holding, my appetite disappearing.
I knew I couldn't tell him about my Healers abilities yet. He wouldn't understand. I went for the simplest explanation. “You keep shifting in your seat. Every time you do, your face twists up in pain. Did he hurt you?" I repeated.
“Well, because everyone in the wizarding world still stares at me. I'm
“Someone has a goofy looking smile on his face," Harry said as he wrapped his arms around me from behind. He pressed a kiss to my cheek.
“I can't say that. I would be lying if I said I didn't have feelings for you." He turned to face me. “I want you to give us a second chance, Dragon. You know I can make you happy," he said. He began to move towards me.
“Who broke up with whom?" I asked.
“No, no you don't Harry. I don't know how you could. We may be in a relationship with each other, but that doesn't have anything to do with love." With that, I turned away from him. I walked over to the window and looked down at the garden. I could see several of Father's white peacocks strutting across the grass near the fountain in the center of the garden.
“Oh, my little Dragon, what happened?" She asked helping me into a sitting position.
This is the story from Draco's point of view.
Harry's voice pulled me from my thoughts. I blinked several times before I could raise my head to meet his gaze in the mirror. He was watching me curiously.
I thought. I shrugged to myself.
Millicent Bulstrode and Hermione were in one spot, swapping stories of motherhood. Ron and his siblings could be seen scattered throughout the room; Ron of course was near the buffet table. George was threading his way through the crowd, trying to sell the products from his joke shop. Ginny was telling anyone who would listen about her new career with the Holyhead Harpies. The oldest brother, Bill, whom I had officially met for the first time today, was sitting on the sofa with his boyfriend Jason Brooks sitting on his lap. Even Ron's parents were here; they were sitting by the fireplace with my mother, all three of them playing with little baby Rose. Charlie and Percy hadn't come; Percy claiming that he had to work and Charlie had returned Ron's invite unopened.
“It's nice of you to come out here Harry. I was kinda lonely," Hermione said as I sat down.
“Oh, shut up," I said, raising my wand and canceling the spell. The mirror became cloudy for a moment, then it became the way it was supposed to be; it was my reflection once again, now bare chested and with the dragon necklace hanging against my bare skin. I carefully removed the chain from around my neck and carefully opened the hidden compartment in the wall. As I placed the dragon necklace in the compartment, my fingers brushed against a small box.
“Harry, that sounds great. Now, we have to get clearance from Minister Shacklebolt, so we won't be able to go for a couple of days," he said, looking down.
“Oh, yeah. It would help if I told you why you've been sick. Harry, you're about seven weeks pregnant."
“I honestly have no answer for you. I would suggest that you come with me and find out for yourself." He shrugged his shoulders, then stepped into a lift. He held the door open, waiting for me to decide if I would join him. I took a breath and stepped into the lift with him. He let the door close behind me.
I fixed Seamus with a stare that had him squirming on the box and trying his best not to look me in the eye. “You're going to lecture me about my feelings when you yourself couldn't even admit your own to the man you loved the whole time that we all shared a dorm at Hogwarts?"
“You don't mean that," Blaise said.
“Can I get you guys some tea, or hot chocolate, or something?" Charlie asked.
I twisted on the spot and apparated in front of the bedroom doors. I took a deep breath before pushing the doors open. Harry was standing at the bed, throwing things into his trunk and suitcases. He glared at me when he noticed me. He pulled open the drawer of his nightstand and threw a couple more things into his trunk.
“Hey, I was going to wear that Harry," I whined.
“They weren't real, Harry. It was all just a nightmare," I said. I walked further into the room and sat down on the edge of his bed.
I glanced around, but didn't see Harry anywhere. I stood there for a moment, before I heard the sound of a guitar being strummed softly and I followed it. I came across a small pond with a small willow tree at one end. Harry was sitting under the willow tree, his back towards me. I began to make my way towards him, but I paused when I heard him singing; the beautiful tenor of his voice reaching my ears.
“Yeah, I wanted to apologize for what Blaise did," I said, waving my hand towards the sink where his shirt still rested.
I pressed my lips to his again and tightened my arms around him. I twisted on the spot and apparated us into my bedroom. With our lips still pressed together, I backed him up until his legs hit the edge of my bed. I tumbled us onto my bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not because of you, no. It's because of what he's done to you. I'm guessing that the wounds on his chest were something that he caused you?" Dean asked.
He spun his head around, eyes wide. “Really? You'll go with me to Azkaban?" He asked. He sounded hopeful.
, my silvery dragon Patronus burst from the end of my wand. It floated lazily in front of me.
“That's sounds like a good idea. Draco, would you go with me when I collect my stuff?" He asked me.
Harry still bartended almost every night and I was becoming a regular visitor to Rainforest Falls. Just about everyone that worked there knew my name and knew that I was Harry's. Harry had finally managed to get me to drink some Muggle alcohol, laughing at me when I found it quite enjoyable. There was also the occasional morning bartending shifts that he would pick up.
“Save it Potter. I was a fool to think that you ever really cared for me. You're just like everyone else; you don't care about me at all. And why should you care? I'm just a lowly Death Eater," he said, before he turned and walked back to the window.
My vision blurred as the tears filled my eyes. I let them fall freely down my cheeks. I couldn't believe the crashing halt my relationship had come to. It felt like my heart shattered as I remembered what Charlie had said in the kitchen. “Oh my God," I sobbed.
“Knowing George as I do, it's most likely something that will embarrass you, not hurt you."
As the Aurors forced him into a chair and used their wands to bind his chains to the rings in the floor, he stared at me with his cold grey eyes. His eyes immediately shot down to where Harry was still holding my hand. A scowl appeared on his face as the Aurors tightened the chains in place before stowing their wands away in their robes. They both moved to stand behind the chair that Kingsley had sat in.
“What? You think that just because we broke up that I can't be a decent server to Harry? Even if he's on a date with someone, that doesn't mean I can't be civil!" He snapped at her.
“Alright, come out of there or I'll blast the door from its hinges!" I yelled. I kept my wand trained on the door. It opened slowly. A man stepped out, dressed in a pair of Charlie's pajama pants. I knew him as soon as I looked up at him. He had short black hair, crooked teeth and dark grey-black eyes. There was a Slytherin tattoo on his left shoulder.  “Flint!" I growled.
I stared at him, utterly confused. He reached up and pulled me down to him, kissing me deeply once again. I relaxed against him as he continued to kiss me. I heard the click of the bottle being opened, then Harry's hand reached between our bodies. I about jumped out of my skin when his fingers closed over my erection, rubbing lube up and down my shaft.
Suddenly, Josie stepped up to the table and set down a large plate of nachos. “Here darlings, my uncle said that these are on the house."
“Awe, did you miss me, Krista?" Harry asked, a grin splitting his face. He glanced at some kind of screen in the corner, then back at Krista.
I couldn't answer her, for at that moment, I was still heaving dryly over the rubbish bin. I straightened up slowly, still feeling like I was going to puke. Harry's cup, and I knew it was his because he was the only who still had liquid in his cup, was suddenly pushed into my hands. I glanced at him briefly, before taking a grateful sip of his lemonade.
Harry hesitated for a moment, then his arms wrapped around my waist, pulling me even closer to him. I closed my eyes, enjoying the sensation of our bodies pressed against each other. One of his hands slid up my back and his fingers tangled in my hair. He tilted my head back a little, and deepened the kiss. I felt his tongue slide across my lips. I parted them, and he slid right in. He explored my mouth, swirling his tongue against my cheeks. I boldly slid my tongue into his mouth and repeated his actions.
“I don't know. But right now, I can't be in the same room with you," he said. He stepped towards the door.
“You can't use magic for everything. It's about time you stopped following your father's view of the world and make your own path. Besides, I can communicate faster with my phone than with floo or an owl."
I came first, releasing myself all over my hand and my stomach. Harry came a moment later, his hips thrusting into me as he released his cum inside me. He thrust a couple more times before collapsing against me. We laid there, breathing heavily. Harry's head rested in the crook of my neck. He pressed a kiss to my sweaty skin. He withdrew from me and rolled to lay next to me. Suddenly, his wand was in his hand. With a muttered spell, the sticky mess across my stomach disappeared, as well as what he had left behind. His wand disappeared from his hand.
“That was amazing," he said, rolling off of me to sprawl out on the bed beside me. I rolled over and tucked myself against his side, resting my head against his shoulder. We laid there for a while, just holding each other.
In answer to that, he waved his wand and the lift stopped. He turned to me, leaned up on his toes and pressed his lips to mine. My arms wrapped around him, seemingly of their own accord, as his arms slid around my neck. Draco broke the kiss too soon for my liking. “Yes, it was true. I used to fantasize about you quite a bit. Haven't fantasized about you in a while. At least, not until after our night together."
“Be right there Harry," came his response from the bedroom. I let my eyes travel over the living room and I noticed the stack of boxes piled up next to the couch. I stepped over to them. The top box was full of my pictures that had been around the apartment. I closed the lid on the box.
“Did he tell you why we broke up?" I asked, straightening my shirt across my shoulders, and I began to button it.
I awoke to Harry's lips pressing gentle kisses along one of the scars on my chest. I laid perfectly still, not even opening my eyes, as I enjoyed his kisses. His tongue slid across the scar in a slow, gentle caress. Harry shifted lower and let his lips travel over another scar. I fought back a moan, trying not to let him know that I was awake.
“No, last night wasn't the first time this happened between him and me," Flint said casually.
Harry's wand was in his hand and with a muttered spell, both of our bodies were cleaned from our love making.  He levitated his wand back to the nightstand before pulling me into his arms. I snuggled against him, the fingers from one of his hands buried in my hair, while his other hand rubbed up and down my arm.
“Then he must not want to be my friend. A real friend would be happy to see me meet new people that seem to like me."
I focused on the pain that I felt in my hip. I knew that when I no longer felt pain, he would be completely healed. The pain was still intense. As my magic worked its way over his hip, the pain lessened little by little. His body began to relax and the pain drifted away. I kept my hand in place as I opened my eyes and looked down at my hand. There was no trace left of his his injury.
“Why are you so determined about this?" I asked, starting to push myself to my feet.
He thrust a finger into me at the same time as he thrust his tongue into my mouth. With a muffled gasp, I arched my back, thrusting my shaft through his fingers. He steadily moved his finger in and out several times before he added a second finger. I moaned, braking away from the kiss, my fingers searching for the lubricant bottle. Not finding it, I whispered a spell to lube my fingers and I wrapped them around Draco's dick.
“Yes, Master Draco. Right away Master," she squeaked out. With another small pop, she was gone. I smiled as I went back into my room. Harry was still on the bed where I had left him, his glasses and his wand laying on top of my nightstand. I let him sleep and began to gather up our clothes from the night before. Harry's clothes I left in a pile at the foot of my bed. My clothes,  I carried into my bathroom and dropped them into the hamper. When I emerged from the bathroom, I ducked into my closet and found another robe for Harry to wear when he woke.
“So, do you guys need a ride?" He asked me.
“Proving that I love you. I want you inside me, Draco," he said to me, his fingers still sliding up and down my shaft.
“Actually, I think she'll be disappointed if you don't come back. She's been looking for you since I was admitted to St. Mungo's," he said rubbing his hand up my back.
“What do you want to know, Draco?"
Draco made a growl deep in his throat, twisting his fingers before adding a third finger. I slid my hand up and down his shaft, spreading the lube around. He twisted his fingers again and hooked them, hitting my prostate. I cried out in pleasure and dropped my hand away from his shaft. He immediately slid his fingers from me and lined himself with my entrance. He slid in with one thrust, burying himself deeply. His one hand still around my shaft.
Ron grabbed Harry to get his attention again. Harry turned back to Ron and looked into his eyes. He stumbled backwards and looked towards me again. The pain on his face was like a knife to my heart. I took a step forward just as Blaise entered the room behind me. Harry's eyes flickered to Blaise, and the pain on his face became more pronounced. Harry shook Ron's hand off his arm and disapparated with a loud crack.
“I do love you, Harry. Please, give me a chance. I promise this isn't what it looks like. I have no interest in Blaise like that," I said. I could feel the tears begin to fall from my eyes.
The young man we had been watching earlier came over to the table. He looked like he was ready to start screaming at her for coming over to us. “Look, Kyle..." she began, but he cut her off.
“Oh, Ron and Hermione just had a baby and they named me as her godfather. I just came to pay a visit," I answered.
“Ginny and I came up with this plan yesterday," Charlie answered.
I nodded and allowed her to help me to my feet. She gave me a kiss on my cheek then gently pushed me in the direction of my bathroom. I made my way over to my bathroom, dragging my feet the whole way. I entered the bathroom, closing the door behind me and pulling out my wand. “
He stared a moment longer, then stood up and pulled the trousers to his waist. He left them unfastened and reached for the light grey shirt. He pulled it on, and quickly buttoned it. As he tucked the shirt into his waistband, I noticed the perfect way the shirt fit him; snug against his chest and biceps, loose around his waist. A perfect fit for his body. He fastened his trousers and reached for his belt. He looked up and caught me staring at him. A smile appeared on his lips.
“Harry, I'm sorry. I think I was surprised by the fact that you've been hiding this from me. It felt like I couldn't trust you anymore."
I read Harry's note several times, before I glanced over to where Draco and Chase were standing by the jukebox. I watched as Draco reached out and began to play with Chase's ponytail. I shook my head and turned back to the notebook.
“Because you and him need to have a serious talk. I know you don't want to hear what he has to say, but I want you to listen." She motioned Draco forward.
It felt like someone had just slapped me across the face. Ron's words hung in the air, ringing through my ears. I choked back a sob as my eyes filled with tears. I turned on my heel and made my way to the bedroom.  I closed the door behind me and walked over to sit on my side of the bed. The tears threatened to fall, but I brushed them away angrily.
He looked shocked at what I was showing him. “Harry, you cheated on me?" He asked, sounding hurt.
“I'm gonna go make us some tea," I said as I finished tying my shoes. I left the room before I was tempted to pull him back to bed. I walked down our hallway and through the living room before reaching the kitchen. Walking over to the stove, I flicked the burner on underneath the kettle. While I waited for the water to boil, I pulled down two mugs from the cabinet. I reached up on top of the fridge and pulled down the box of instant tea. The kettle started to whistle and I flicked off the burner. I poured the water into our mugs and added in the tea. I flicked my wand to make the tea stir itself. I added just the right amount of sugar and milk to both mugs as the tea continued to swirl around.

“No, I don't want to hear it, I don't want to see it. I think it would be too painful. Can you just leave now?" I asked, rubbing the back of my neck.
------------
“Draco got sick after getting off the ride. So, we're going to cut short our time here and go onto the next phase of our day," Harry said. He stood, before reaching out a hand and helping me to my feet.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible.
“Just get out, Potter. Get out and leave me alone."
“If it's my mother, I don't want to see her. I don't want another lecture about my stupid behavior. I get it; I was very stupid," I said and turned back to the window. I knew the image in the window was false; all the windows in St. Mungo's Hospital were enchanted to look like they were looking out over a massive lake.
“Well, well, Harry. Haven't seen you lately," she said.
Hope you enjoyed it. Stay tuned for the next chapter. It will be ready as soon as possible
Harry choked on the chip in his mouth. He quickly swallowed some water. “You want me to move into your house?"
“What do you want, Potter?" He asked, bringing the cigarette back to his lips for another drag.
“I'll see you inside, love," he said. Connie tugged on my arm and led me away from him. As we went around the front of the building, Connie and I talked, getting to know a little about each other. She told me about how she had met Harry and how she thought of him as a brother. I told her about how Harry and I had gone to school together, leaving out the part where we had hated each other in those days.
“Honey, does he mention why he left?" Ron asked, sitting down next to me.
“So could you Harry. And with as powerful as you are, I bet you would only need a fertility potion to get the pregnancy started; your magic is strong enough to do the rest of the baby's development. Heck, you might not even need a fertility potion."
“All the good looking ones are either gay, taken, or both," she said. I recognized her voice as the one that had spoken when we had entered.
“So, have you been looking for a new apartment?" I asked. I reached for a chip and dipped it into the queso, right in the center of the chili. I brought it to my lips and bit into it. “Wow, that's good."
Without a word, Draco came over to the couch and began to gather up the boxes. He began to stack them into the empty fireplace. When he had four or five boxes stacked, he drew his wand and preformed a sticking charm to keep the boxes together. He took a pinch of floo powder from the pot on the mantle and threw it in. “The Serpent's Den," he called, naming his bedroom. He stepped into the green flames and disappeared with the boxes.
Neville helped me to my feet and I headed back towards my room. “I'll call Seamus and tell him you'll be late this morning," Neville said as he headed back towards the living room. I walked over to my wardrobe and pulled out a set of robes. I also pulled out a shirt and a pair of trousers. I dressed quickly, then headed out of my room. I met Neville by the fireplace, fighting nausea the whole way. Neville grabbed my arm and apparated us out.
“That's two questions, but I'll answer them. First, the stuff was rattling because of my temper. For some reason, my magic has always been hardwired to my emotions. The angrier I get, the more I lose control of my magic. As for the other question, when you put your arm around me, your touch actually began to calm me down."
“You told us that Ron saw him kissing Blaise, but did you actually talk to Draco about the kiss? Did you stop to think that maybe he didn't want to kiss Blaise?" Seamus asked walking over to a box of books and sitting down on it.
He looked up at me. “What do you mean, Harry?"
A sick feeling began to form in my stomach. “Blaise, please tell me that you don't still have feelings for me," I said.
Harry chuckled and turned to face me. He reached out and pulled me against him. We laid there as our breathing quieted down. I felt myself getting rather sleepy. I snuggled against him and let my eyes close. I let myself drift off to sleep, my head snuggled against his chest.
Draco smiled at me. “Poppy," he called. The house elf appeared next to the bed, seeming unfazed by seeing me next to him.
As I started to pull away, I felt a hand close around my wrist. I shifted my gaze and discovered that Draco had slid his hand out from the sheet. I glanced towards his face to see his grey eyes were slightly opened. “Please stay," he whispered. His eyes closed and he let out a soft sigh. His fingers released my wrist as his hand dropped to the bed. I hesitated for a moment, before I waved my hand, stripping myself down to my boxers.
I opened the door of Marko's tavern and I froze.
“Does it matter that I didn't say who I was bringing?" I asked him.
“Actually, that's what started our fight; I accused him of cheating on me. I noticed there were a couple bruises that looked like hickeys on his neck, and I know they didn't come from me."
Relief flooded his face, then he leaned down and kissed me again. Harry pulled away from my lips and began kissing his way down my chest, dragging his tongue against each of the four scars before moving lower. His lips brushed along my erection and I jumped slightly. He chuckled softly before moving even lower, until his lips and tongue brushed my sack; I gasped.
At that moment, the waitress reappeared with our drinks. She set them on the table without a word, and picked up the empty glasses. “Will you be needing anything else?"
to the wizarding world. In the Muggle world, I'm just Harry."
“You wish," he replied.
“Don't touch me," I gasped.
“Where the Hell have you been for the last month?" Krista demanded.
“I'm assuming that in his mind, he actually felt the wounds cutting through his body. His magic made him believe the wounds were real, and I bet that if he had opened his eyes during that time, they would have become real. But that's just a guess on my part," Dean said, rubbing his hand through his hair. I noticed that he was biting his lip as though there was something else on his mind.
He snuggled deeper under his blanket. I reached out and gently took his glasses off his face. I set them on his nightstand before I pulled the blanket up to his chin. I reached out to run my hand through his hair, but stopped myself. I sat there until his breathing deepened and I knew he was deeply asleep. I watched over him for a moment longer, making sure that the potion was working.
I flinched when I saw his eyes. They were red and puffy, as if he'd been crying. He noticed my stare and quickly looked away from me. “Just leave me alone, Malfoy."
He sighed. “I got into an argument with my boyfriend. After he left, I came here," he said simply.
He turned his head and pressed a kiss to my forehead. “I love you too, Draco. Happy birthday," he said. We laid there just holding each other.
After bowling almost a whole game of nothing but gutter balls, I turned around from my turn on the lane and froze. Draco was sitting on Chase's lap and Chase was pressing kisses against Draco's jaw. I felt like a balloon had burst inside my chest; I felt deflated. My heart ached and I felt tears prickle my eyes; Draco looked like he was enjoying himself. I glanced at the screen and discovered that there was only three frames left of the game. I picked up Hermione's bag, and quickly extracted my wand and phone, then I reached further into the bag and pulled out a Muggle notebook and pen. I glanced around quickly, but none of the others were paying attention to me; Hermione and Pansy had gone to get themselves more drinks, Theo had disappeared into the men's room, Ron was stepping up to take his turn, and Draco was preoccupied with Chase.
With a snap of my fingers, I summoned the lubricant. Draco caught it in his hand. He squirted a large dollop on his fingers. He sat up on his knees and reached his lubed up fingers behind himself. I was fascinated as I watched him prepare himself for me. I took some lube and began to rub it over my shaft.
“Be patient, Draco. I'm not going to let your fascination with my body stop me from giving you a real present," he said as he slid out from the tangled sheet. He strolled over to the walk-in wardrobe and disappeared inside of it.
“I don't think he's used to this. I'll take him out to the car so he can lay down, and then I'll come back in to help you finish cleaning," I said, leaning my broom against the wall.
“I didn't know that. I've been here several times and I've never picked up on his magical signature," I said.
I landed us outside the gates around the Manor, which swung open almost at once. Harry and I stepped through the gates, and began the long walk to the doors. The gates swung shut behind us. A loud squawk above us drew our attention upwards. One of Father's white peacocks was strutting along one of the hedges, fluffing out his feathers. The peacock stared down at us for a moment, squawked again, then turned around and marched along the hedge.
“Will you stop being like that? I just want to talk to you," he said.
“Yes, Master Draco?" He squeaked.
“I'm a Healer, Charlie. I can feel the pain of those around me. When Harry and I got here, I felt a dull burning sensation in my crotch area. It intensified when you came out of the bedroom."
I closed the door and went around the car. I climbed into the car and started the car. Draco slumped in his seat as I pulled from the parking lot. He staring snoring at I drove down the street. I glanced at him from time to time, but otherwise I kept my gaze on the road as I drove back to Malfoy Manor.
He sighed. “I have to go."
“I can handle it." He stared at Harry for a moment, before he seemed to notice that I was at the table. He stared at me and I stared at him. An angry scowl started to form on his face.
“I came to visit Mother. She's been having bad nightmares lately. What about you? I mean, this is an odd place to run into you."
“Why won't he talk to me?" I asked out loud. I wasn't expecting an answer; I had asked the same question several times over the last few days.
“I can't believe this is all for me. Thank you," he said, turning to look at mother and I.
I left the room and went back to the room where the other four were still waiting for me. After explaining to them about Harry wanting to sleep, Dean advised giving Harry a Dreamless Sleep Potion to keep the nightmares away. I promised him that I would give Harry the potion and the two Healers took their leave.
“Going to join me for breakfast, Harry?" He asked.
“Have you ever taken a fertility potion or male pregnancy potion," Dean asked.
“So, what are you waiting for? Go in there and talk to him," Ron said.
“Yes. Please Harry, fuck me," I said. I used my legs around his waist to pull him closer.
“Just a slight concussion from where his head hit the wall. Patrick insists he's fine though," she said.
I took a breath to steady my nerves. No matter how many times I've used floo, I still don't like it. The dizziness from spinning through the different fireplaces was one thing, but if you didn't speak clearly, you could come out of the wrong fireplace. I took another deep breath and stepped forward. I took a small pinch of floo powder and tossed it into the fireplace. Green flames erupted once again. I stepped into them. “St. Mungo's," I called. The room vanished in a sickening swirl of color as I spun around in the fireplace.
“Fuck, Harry, stop teasing," I panted. I felt him grin around my shaft, then I gasped as he took me completely into his mouth. He began a slow rhythm; first dragging his mouth up my shaft until he almost completely removed me from his mouth, then sliding back down to my base, sucking gently the entire time. I moaned, and dropped back to the bed, my arms no longer supporting me.
“It wasn't real though Harry. It was all in your head." I quickly explained what Dean had said in the other room. I reached out and took his hand, holding it gently. “I know you saw me hurting you during the nightmare, giving you the same wounds you gave me. That won't happen, ever. I could never do that to someone."
“I think we have. Draco?"
“But, how did his magic make the wounds appear, but not actually be there?" Shawnna asked, speaking for the first time since Dean's arrival.
“I figured you would like some company," I said. She smiled at me. She shifted her legs against the couch to make room for me to sit down next to her.
“Did you tell Harry that Blaise kissed you? I'm guessing that's what Ron was whispering to him?"
With a groan, I pulled away from him. I reached for the bottle of lube that he had dropped on the bed. I squeezed it onto my hand and began to rub it over my fingers. Harry shifted his position a bit, giving me access to his entrance. I traced my finger around it, still not quite sure of what I was doing.
“Go away," he groaned, his voice slightly muffled under the sheet.
“Going down, Mr. Potter?" He asked me. He looked very familiar to me.
“No one will ever love me, not when I have this
He chuckled under his breath. “Harry, yes, we were enemies back then. But your not the type of wizard to willing use Dark Magic against a fellow human being. It's not in your nature," he said. He pressed another kiss to my lips before he rolled away to lay on his back next to me. He sat up and scooted up so his back rested against his pillows. He patted the pillows next to him. I smiled as I sat up and scooted back against his pillows.
“I don't think you really want to know. They say the truth hurts."
We stood there for a moment. I tightened my grip on his hand. “Well, let's show him what he's missing," I said. I dragged him over to the doors and walked inside.
“Don't be stupid. I was downstairs with you when he screamed, remember? Besides, I don't know how, but these wounds aren't real," I said. I pressed my hand against his chest for a moment, then lifted it to show that there was no blood on my hand. Harry still screamed.
“I'm perfectly fine right where I am," he answered. I could hear the first hints of anger in his voice.
The waitress wrote it down on her pad of paper, then flicked her eyes to Draco. He glanced at his own menu. “I would like the ham and cheese on wheat, with the creamy potato soup."
“I took him to lunch the next day, and we've been together since," I finished.
“Yeah. All of the fireplaces in the Manor are connected to the Ministry of Magic."
“Does that mean I have to move out of the Manor?" He asked.
Kyle choose that moment to appear with our food. I went to pull my hand away, but Harry flipped his hand over and grabbed mine, stopping my retreat. Kyle glared at our hands for a moment, then placed the food on the table between us. “Is there anything else I can get for you?" He asked. He sounded desperate.
“Arthur, Molly, would you mind if I took my breakfast into the living room? I feel bad that Hermione is all alone out there," I said, suddenly wanting to get away from the table as quickly as I could. I still felt weird about calling them by their names.
“That queso dip sounds good," I said, glancing down at it on my menu. I let my eyes travel over the menu. “Man, everything looks so good. I don't know what to get."
He squeezed my fingers before he spoke. “I've been thinking about visiting Father in Azkaban."
“Well, my, my, my. Are my eyes playing tricks on me, or is that Harry Potter I see?" One of the guys said. The group chuckled. There were two brunettes, a red head, and a blonde with honey gold colored hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Suddenly, Harry started to chuckle. “I know your awake, Draco. Your body is responding to my kisses," he said. Sure enough, I felt myself starting to get hard. With a sigh, I opened my eyes. I looked down at Harry as he pressed another kiss against the scar. He moved back up my body. When he laid across my chest, he pressed his lips to mine and kissed me deeply. My arms came up and I wrapped them around his neck.
“I thought that was my present. If not, can we have sex instead of a real present?" I asked as I forced myself up against the headboard.
“Leave it to me," I said. I dropped his hand and swung my legs over the side of the bed. I stood up and stretched again. “ Is your fireplace over there connected to the Ministry's Floo Network?" I asked him over my shoulder.
“How do you know so much about it?" I asked him.
“Take me, Harry. Take me now," I cried out. I dropped my hand from his penis. Without a word, he removed his fingers from me. He pushed my legs further apart and I felt him position himself at my entrance. He began to push his way in slowly, giving my body time to adjust to his invasion. When he was fully inside me, he leaned forward and took my lips in a bruising kiss.
“But what can we do about it? You're in a relationship with someone."
I didn't answer, just continued to drink my tea as the silence settled around us. Suddenly, he looked down at his watch and stood up. “Alright, we need to get going," he said.
I thought to myself. Suddenly, I wanted more than just oral sex with him. I wanted to make this a night to remember long after it was over. I wanted him inside me.
“Harry, please stop feeling guilty about the scars. I know you blame yourself, but I don't. You didn't know what that spell would do. Please stop blaming yourself. I'm perfectly fine."
My heart cracked as I looked at his back. I slowly crushed out my half finished cigarette and stood up, my legs trembling. I slowly walked out the door, closing it behind me. In a fog, I made my way up the different flights of stairs. When I reached the fourth floor, I made my way to my room, not even glancing at the doors to his room as I passed them. I walked into my room, closing and locking the doors behind me. I threw myself down on the bed, burying my face in the pillows, as I fought back tears.
“You could have warned me," he said at last, as he stepped closer to me and set the box down with the others.
“You do realize that you just called me by my name right?"
That got him to look up. He slowly lowered the book into his lap. “I guess I forgot about your healing abilities, even though you saved Rose's life yesterday."
I let out a sigh of my own, before I unbuckled my seatbelt and opened the door. “There's no need to wait for me. I'll floo home from here."
“Thank you Harry. It's been hard without Fred. Your gift is special, not just to me, but to Molly as well," he said. He hugged me for a moment longer than let me go.
Charlie stepped towards me and bent down to press a kiss to my lips. He stepped away and sat down in his chair. “This looks amazing by the way," he said, picking up his silverware.
“I brought someone else to see you," he said as he let her go. Her eyes drifted past him to find me standing by the foot of her bed.
“Thank you, Jolene. It's beautiful."
Harry began walking down a small hallway. I was vaguely aware of entering a bedroom, and hearing the door shut, before I was shoved against a wall, Harry's mouth still devouring mine hotly. I jerked away from his mouth, panting heavily. Harry pulled away, looking down at me, also breathing heavily. “Draco, are you sure you want this? I know I do, but do you really want this?"
Draco takes Harry to Malfoy Manor. They spend the rest of the night in each other's arms, not caring about the consequences of their actions.
“Actually, Harry, why don't you go ahead and take him home? He looks ready to fall asleep as it is," Peter said from behind me.
“Harry, are you alright man?" I heard Neville ask.
“Oh don't pretend you didn't notice. You were the one to push your hips against mine," he said with a smirk.
“Draco, I did permanent damage to you. How could you just forgive me so easily? You have to live with those scars ruining your body. It's my fault," I whispered. I turned my head away from him. He cupped my chin again and turned my head back. He leaned down and gently kissed me.
“Come back to the Manor, Harry. Come home," he whispered, pressing his lips to my hair.
“Yes Krista, what's the matter?" He asked.
“Then lower your shields, Draco. If you can't say it, then let me feel it."
“Well, anything like that. Elf, fairy, really anything," Dean said, leaning back in his chair.
“Really? You'd be okay with me coming along?" I asked.
We all nodded our heads. Kingsley turned towards his desk. With a flick of his wand, the portkey appeared on his desk. The portkey was nothing special; a porcelain teapot with a large crack down the side, a chip in the spout, and a broken off handle. I remembered that portkeys were made out of stuff Muggles would think was junk so they wouldn't pick them up by accident.
I thought to myself as I rubbed a towel against my hair. I glanced at the robes that were on my bed. I was preparing to head to St. Mungo's Hospital to visit Hermione and her newborn baby. I glanced at my watch. Ron would be arriving in about a half hour to take me to Hermione's room at St. Mungo's.
“Why does everyone think that it wasn't true?" He asked exasperated.
," he sneered the word at me.
“Can I ask what's going on?" I asked him after a couple of minutes.
Penelope was the one to speak about it. “Charlie, why don't you let Jolene sit there and you sit on the other couch next to Bill?"
“You want me to be honest? Fine. I didn't just go out on one date with Chase, I went on two dates with him and both of them were disastrous. I bet if I hadn't spent the whole time with him thinking about you, I might have enjoyed myself better."
Harry has a small spat with Draco about his Dark Mark. Later, Harry reveals to Draco that he is a bartender in a Muggle bar.
“That's what we agreed to. You and Draco are taking turns riding with me and it's your turn," Harry replied.
“Over my dead body!!" Pansy growled.
I took the quill from him and signed my name under his. I laid the quill down. Draco led me over to a door on the left side of the desk. He reached for the door handle, but before he touched it, the door opened. Narcissa's voice came out as a medi-witch came out in a rush. “You better not come back in this room or I will see you fired!"
“I have every right to be defensive! My boyfriend of almost seven months is accusing me of cheating on him!" He yelled. I flinched and turned away.
. I'm putting it that Harry wrote it and Draco hears him playing it, giving him a clue how Harry really feels about him.
“Do you really want to?"
I nodded and turned my attention to the fireplace. Harry stepped towards the fireplace and took some floo powder from the pot. He threw it down in the hearth and called out, “Ministry of Magic, Minister's office." He disappeared in a swirl of green flames.
“The fault is mine, Narcissa. I refused to get out of bed," Harry laughed. I dropped his hand as Mother opened her arms. I stepped into her embrace, feeling the way her hand smoothed over my hair, like she has always done.
I hope you enjoyed it. The next chapter will be ready as soon as possible.
“Are you really that thick? Harry won't have a beautiful life with Jolene because he's GAY!!!" Charlie yelled.
“Draco, look, the reason that I'm angry right now, is that I know what it's like to be abused by the people who are supposed to take care of you."
He smiled. “Yeah, it's really me, Harry. Good to see you again." With that, he turned and walked away.
I raised my head and shifted away from him to give him room as he rolled over to face me. He propped himself up on his elbow and looked at me. I dropped my gaze and looked at his scars. I whimpered in the back of my throat. Draco reached out and gently cupped my chin and tilted my head so I was looking into his eyes.
“ You're lying, Charlie! If you had brought him here because he was drunk, your bottle of lubricant wouldn't be on the floor!" I yelled. I pointed to the side of the bed. His eyes traveled in the direction that I pointed and he let out a soft curse.
“I've been an arse about this whole situation. Can we talk?" He asked, looking at me as though waiting for me to close the door in his face. I turned and walked back to the bed. He followed me. He sat down next to me on the bed, but he wouldn't meet my gaze.
I glanced at the clock on the wall. 7:25 p.m.
“Well, you like grilled chicken right?" He asked.
“Okay. I'll be back in a few minutes." With that, she disappeared.
“What?!"
“Dra..Dra..Draco! St..st..stop it," he choked out. He was laughing so hard that I knew he was running out of air. He raised his hands, trying to push me away. I gave up tickling him as I caught his wrists and pinned them down to the sofa above his head. Before he could catch his breath, I leaned down and kissed him, easily sliding my tongue between his parted lips. Harry responded by sliding his tongue against mine. He tried to tug his wrists free from my grip, but he gave up and relaxed against the sofa cushions.
I turned back to the table and growled, “You did that on purpose Blaise. Don't deny it."
“I want you too, probably more than I've ever wanted anything in my life."
“I couldn't tell you the truth, because I knew it would upset you. I apparently love you too much, because it hurts me when you're upset."
“Seriously, Charlie, just give them a chance to get to know each other. I'm sure they would have a beautiful life together," Percy said.
“Yeah. I've been staying here since my break up. The apartment was his and when I caught him with Flint, I moved out. I still need to go back and get the rest of my things, but I was waiting until I have my own place. If you're ready to go, let me just grab my jacket."
“Yeah, turns out I was more attracted to her cousin Franciois. He was just as beautiful as she was," Bill answered. Everyone snickered.
“ Well, I can't very well show off my boyfriend if he stays home."
“I just cast a Muffalito spell. No one will be able to hear anything that is said in this booth. We need to talk."
“I have some in my room. Try not to fall asleep until I get back. I'm gonna go tell Hermione, Ron, and the two Healers from St. Mungo's that you're going to go to sleep." I said. I made my way to the doors, glancing over my shoulder at him. He was relaxed back against the pillows, his eyes watching me carefully.
“Minister Shacklebolt, yes it's been awhile since we last saw each other. And yes, I'm well. Are you?" I asked.
“I can't really blame you either. I broke the rules first by kissing your cheek. I guess just being friends for now might be harder than we thought."
“Yeah it was in the Prophet. What would give them the idea to set you up with Harry?" Hermione asked.
“Have them pull over and I'll get in front of them," Harry replied.
“Are you cheating on me?" I asked again. I looked up. The look on his face was a cross between horrified and angry.
“There you two are. I was beginning to wonder if I had gotten the wrong time of your arrival, Harry."
“At first I said no, because I was sure he was still in a relationship. When he told me that him and Charlie broke up, I agreed to the date."
“Good to see you too, Lisa. Now let me go," he said, laughing.
I served the food onto the plates, casting heating charms over everything and carried the plates to the table. Then I sat down to wait for him. I fiddled with the stem of my wine glass. I glanced at the clock again. 7:40 p.m. I took a sip from my wine. I ran my fingers through my unruly black hair, trying to make it lay flat.
“I can't really pinpoint an exact reason why I ever started sleeping with Marcus. But if you can forgive me, I will never do it again. Harry, please tell me if you can forgive me."
~~~~~
“How can you say that? Nobody but my mother will ever truly love me! I don't deserve love from anyone!" I yelled. I sprang up from the bed and began to pace back and forth.
Hermione apparently followed my gaze, then let out a soft chuckle. “Who would have thought that we would find something created by Muggles that Draco and Pansy would enjoy?"
“Well, we have rode quite a few, and I'm guessing that there's several more. I want to ride them all," Ron said, his eyes lighting up at the thought.
“It isn't what you think. Harry, please listen to me," I begged.
Ron laughed and pulled me into a hug. “You can't get rid of me that easily. You're family no matter what."
“So, Draco. Is it time for the cake?" Ron asked, turning back to look at me.
I glanced at my watch as I approached the Leaky Cauldron. It was 1:45, which ment that I had fifteen minutes before Harry would meet up with me. I had butterflies in my stomach as I thought about how this would be our first date. Harry had sent me an owl last night, suggesting that I wear Muggle clothes, but nothing too fancy. I had dug in the back of my closet until I had pulled out an old pair of blue jeans and a long sleeved black t-shirt. I had even found my tennis shoes. My coat was the same one I had worn three weeks ago.
“Draco Malfoy wants to visit his father. He would like me to go with him, sir," I said.
“Well, Flint, if you must know; my ex-boyfriend had been cheating on me. I found out, threatened to leave him. He begged me to forgive him and I did. Not long after that, he was cheating on me again. I won't go through that pain again," I said. I looked over at Charlie. “It's over Charlie. I'm leaving."
“Make it two Narcissa. Have the second one plain vanilla," Harry said before I could answer her.
“Those rules were stupid anyway," I mumbled. He chuckled and we both drifted off to sleep.
I turned around to find her and Ron standing just inside the door of the sunroom. It was strange to know that they still wanted to be friends with me, even though Harry and I were having problems. Ron still occasionally called me ´Ferret', reminding me of when I had been turned into a ferret. But no matter how many times he said it, the words didn't have the same sting as they did before.
George stood up. Him and I moved over to Mrs. Weasley and the three of us turned towards the kitchen. We walked in silence for a moment. “Harry, dear, where did you get those pictures of Fred?" She asked.
I glanced around the room. Charlie was at the stove stirring a large pot of oatmeal. Mr Weasley stood next to him mixing a big batch of scrambled eggs, occasionally flicking his wand to keep the bacon moving. Ron was toasting slices of bread with his wand. Ginny and George were busy setting the table. I didn't see Mrs. Weasley, Percy, or Hermione, but I could hear their voices from the other room.
“Draco, can I ask how you knew something was wrong with Rose?" Hermione asked him.
“It's not that hard, Draco. I was raised by Muggles, remember? Anyway, the longer you're in a relationship with me, I'll get you to use them. I'll even get you to understand Muggle money," I whispered back.
A small pop announced Charlie's arrival. I turned my head to look at him.
I sat there in silence for a moment, thinking about everything Seamus had just said to me. I felt a pang of guilt that Draco had hurt himself over me. As I processed all of the information, something was bugging me in the back of my mind. “Hang on, if Draco caused himself harm, why didn't his Healer's magic take care of it?" I asked.
He turned his head and glanced at where his suitcases and his trunk were stacked against the wall. He looked at me. “I see you already packed my stuff for me. I guess the only thing left for me to do, is to pay Tom," he said. He picked up his wand from the desk, and pointed it at his luggage. It all shrank down and then flew into his hand. He tucked his stuff into his pocket and grabbed his jacket.
He must have heard the desperation in my tone, for he removed his fingers. I heard him whisper the lubrication charm, and then he spread my cheeks again and slid into my hole slowly. I moaned at the sheer sensation of him sliding in; I could feel him more than normal from this position. When he was buried in me to the hilt, he paused, holding himself completely still. “Fuck, Draco. You feel so good. You're so tight around me," he said.
“Yeah, everything is fine, Kingsley. Look, I'm sorry about what happened in there," Harry answered.
We drove in silence for about twenty minutes, before she finally pulled to a stop in front of a small brick building. As I climbed out of the car, I looked at the small building, feeling the magical tingle of wards that had been erected to keep Muggles out. “I'm guessing that this is a wizard bookstore?" I asked. Hermione nodded briefly, before pulling open the door.
I swallowed, trying to keep my mind off of how good his skin felt underneath my fingers. I concentrated harder when my fingers brushed against the puncture wound. I closed my eyes again and pulled the magic from deep inside.
“From George. He didn't know what I was up to. I just asked him if he had good pictures of Fred." I answered. George blushed slightly.
“Already tried. My wand didn't seem to help much," he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can I get you something other than water to drink?" She asked.
I froze in my tracks and slowly turned to look at him. He was sitting on the bed, green eyes now smoldering behind his glasses that were now on his face. “What did you say?" I asked timidly.
“Give him a chance? To do what? There's no way I'm gonna let him get anywhere near..."
I took a breath and slowly pulled my finger out. When just the tip of my finger was still inside him, I gently slid it back in. He groaned deep in his throat and began to thrust himself against my finger. Encouraged by his actions, I began to move my finger a little faster in his hole. Suddenly, it wasn't enough for me; I wanted more. I pulled my finger completely out of him and then shoved two fingers back in. Harry gasped and his legs spread out a little more, giving me more access to his hole.
“Sounds like their crushing on you, Harry," Hermione said with a giggle.
“No matter what the consequences are for my actions tonight, I don't want to walk away," he said. He used his grip on my hand to pull me against him.
He stepped closer to the bed and finally raised his head. His grey eyes were slightly red rimmed, like he had been crying. My heart went out to him, but I stubbornly refused to let it show on my face. “Harry, I want you to know that I didn't plan that kiss with Blaise. I was very happy with you, and he ruined it."
“That's awesome Draco," Harry said, pulling me into a hug.
I opened my eyes and stared at the green curtains around the bed, that were blurry without my glasses. I blinked, trying to figure out why the curtains were green instead of red. As I tried to shift on the bed, I felt a heavy weight against my right side. Turning my head, I glanced down. Draco was curled up against my side, his head resting on my shoulder. His right hand was laying across my stomach. I smiled, remembering how he had wanted me to stay after I had tucked him in bed. The curtains were opened slightly and a small shaft of early morning sunlight shown through and gave Draco's hair a golden shine.
“Draco! Draco Lucius Malfoy open this door!" Mother's voice yelled. She pounded on the door again.
“Well, if you want to drink that, you don't have much of an option. I highly doubt that you seen another place to sit," he said, pointing.
“Honestly, Harry, I don't know if Abraxas ever used the Cruciatus Curse on Lucius when he was growing up. Lucius didn't talk about his father much when he started courting me. Look, Harry, if this is bothering you, we can stop," Narcissa said.
~~~~~
Reluctantly, I pulled myself away from Harry and walked over to the desk Mother was sitting at. I turned back around to watch as Harry sat up on the sofa. He straightened his glasses across his nose and straightened up his now wrinkled t-shirt. I watched as he bent over to pick up his book from where it had fallen to the floor when I was tickling him. He raised his head to catch me staring at him. He grinned at me before raising his hand and giving me the finger. I chuckled at him as he hid behind his book again. I turned back to Mother to help her, my heart feeling light and happy.
“I can change that, but I don't think you're ready for it," Harry said. He pulled the car into the parking lot behind the bar. When he shut off the engine, he seemed to notice that a group of guys stood by the back of the building. He stared at them for a moment, before he turned back to me.
Just as I felt my body tense with the approach of my orgasm, Harry pulled his mouth away and slowly kissed his way back up my body. When he got to my chest, he began to place tender, loving kisses to the scars that marked my skin. He started with the longest one that began under my collarbone. I groaned as he gently ran his tongue over each scar before he shifted his mouth and latched onto my left nipple. My back arched as he sucked on my nipple as though his life depended on it.
“No. He's not my best friend. Best friends don't keep secrets from each other. He lied to me," Ron said turning his back on the room. He faced the fireplace and just stared at the dancing green flames.
I fought back the wave of nausea that passed through me, as I remembered everything that had occurred. I swung my legs over the side of the bed and stood up. I wobbled slightly, my legs a little weak after spending most of the previous day in bed. I made my way to my en suite bathroom, grabbing my towel along the way.
“Where are you going?" I asked.
We sat there silently, feeding each other bites from both cakes. I glanced around the room, watching as Ginny began chasing George for getting cake in her hair. I smiled and turned back to Harry. He raised his hand and cupped the side of my face. He pulled me closer until our lips met. I sighed and relaxed against him, bringing my arms up around his neck.
“Okay then," she said and walked away.
I hesitated, before I slid one finger into him slowly. He hissed slightly at the intrusion. I paused, fearing that I was hurting him. “Am I hurting you?" I asked desperately.
I watched them for a moment, before turning back to face the Pensieve. Draco's memory was swirling around the Pensieve. I took a deep breath and plunged my face into the surface of his memory. It felt as though the floor tilted beneath my feet and I was falling into the Pensieve.
“Well, we've known each other since we were eleven. But we still don't really know each other. I think we should just start all over, become friends, and then we can decide if we want to continue what we had beforehand."
“Not in a long while," he said looking at me.
“Draco, stop. Look, me breaking the kiss had nothing to do with my boyfriend. I wasn't even thinking of him."
“Now, you'll have to go to the front door because this door is for employees, but I want you to come meet those guys over there," he said, pointing to the group. I nodded and climbed out of the car. He met me in front of the hood of the car, grabbed my hand and lead me towards the guys.
Harry emerged from the bathroom, and I thought my heart would punch straight through my chest. I couldn't help but stare at him as he made his way towards me. However, when he got closer to the table, I looked down. I didn't know what he would say, but I was afraid to find out.
“Since when are you two on a first name basis?" Blaise asked looking at me.
I was right on his heels as he pulled open the door. Linda looked terrified as we stopped next to her desk. “What happened in there? What caused Harry's anger?" She asked.
“Then what happened?" Harry asked, his green eyes shining with excitement.
“The bar I work at is called Rainforest Falls."
“Ginny? What are you doing here?" Charlie asked lowering his wand.
“Thanks Marko. Now I'm gonna go see if I can find a seat somewhere," I said, picking up the glass. I cast a No Spilling Spell over the glass, so I could weave my way through the crowd, and not spill my drink.
“I'll call my boss later tonight. If he
“The Healers tell me I'll be out of here as soon as they know that I'm not going to hurt myself again and that my wounds are healed. Should be a few days."
I wasn't aware of how long we were there. I occasionally joined in the conversation around me, but I was mostly silent and just listened to them. Before long, the was a knock on the door. The door opened, and a young medi-wizard came in, carrying a tray of potions. “Alright Mrs. Malfoy, it's time for your potions."
“Father used to drive when Voldemort first lost power, but after he returned, Father got rid of his car," he answered me. I pulled the Lamborghini to a stop and killed the engine.
Before I could protest about him not kissing me, he raised his head from my neck and pressed his lips to mine in a hungry kiss. He slid his tongue against my lips. I opened my mouth and his tongue slid in easily. As our tongues danced against each other, Harry's hand came up and cupped the side of my face, angling my head to deepen the kiss.
Jolene rolled her eyes but didn't respond to her sister. I noticed her cheeks were slightly pink and I caught myself wondering if she knew what they were up to.
I tried to force myself to my feet, but I barely managed to get to my knees before I toppled over. My vision swam and everything started turning black. “Dempsey, Poppy," I said. The last thing I was aware of was the sound of two loud cracks, followed by a scream, before I lost consciousness.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You really think that you can heal it?" He asked. He sounded hopeful, but at the same time he sounded afraid.
“Listen, Harry. Mother showed you those memories, because we wanted you to forget about the guilt you feel. I forgave you a long time ago for the scars on my chest, and you are not responsible for what I did when you left," I said. Harry opened his mouth, but I raised my hand before he spoke. “No, Harry. You don't need to feel guilty about my wrists. Yes, I was hurt that you left me, but there were healthier ways of dealing with it. I resorted back to harming myself, but you aren't responsible for my actions."
“The only reason I got upset, is because you two have kept it from me for so long. I was trying to help Harry find someone."
“You're pregnant Harry. And judging by the color when I did the spell, you're carrying a boy," Dean said calmly. Blood rushed through my head and my vision went black as I fainted.
I broke away from the kiss when I felt a stinging sensation across my back. I turned my head to see Blaise with his wand in his hand, staring in our direction with a scowl on his face. When he caught me looking, he turned on his heel and stormed out into the hallway.
I looked back up at him. His eyes were still closed and his head was still against the wall. “How do you feel Harry?" I asked. He opened his eyes and looked down at me. His green eyes had darkened, and his breath was coming in short pants. It was then that I noticed he was a half a foot taller than me.
I sighed happily and rose to my feet. I walked over to the bed and gently shook his shoulder. He grumbled and rolled away from me. He caught the sheet in his hand and pulled it up to his shoulder. He snuggled deeper into his pillow. “Come on Harry, it's time to get up," I said, catching the sheet in my hand and tugging on it. His grip tightened on the sheet as he tried to hide under it. He managed to pull it up over his head.
I pulled the small box from the compartment and held it in my palm. I opened it to reveal the lion shaped necklace that I had gotten Harry, that I had wanted to give him for his birthday. The lion had a snake wrapped around it lazily. In the mouth of the lion was a ruby; Harry's birthstone. The snake held a pearl in its mouth; my birthstone. I felt tears welling up in my eyes as I looked at the necklace in my hand. I carefully closed the lid on the box and replaced it back in the compartment.
His body relaxed and he seemed to drift off to sleep. The light from Dean's hands slowly began to fade from around Harry's body. When the light was gone, Dean slowly opened his eyes and sat up. Dean raised his wand and the chains binding Harry fell away. Harry promptly rolled over and snuggled deeper into his bedding. Dean breathed out a soft sigh.
“Draco is eight years old here. He accidentally broke the practice broomstick Lucius had bought him. He got a bad spanking from Lucius, thus the tears and his fidgeting," she answered.
“Look at it this way...You've been like a son to my parents ever since the first day they met you. Ron has always thought of you as another brother. And let's not forget the age difference between you and me."
Harry chuckled, but before he could answer, there was a loud squawk and Pansy turned into a large yellow bird. The room burst into laughter and all eyes sought out George Weasley. He jumped on a chair and took a bow. After a moment, Pansy lost her feathers, and returned to normal, laughing with the rest of us.
“Harry, are you alright?" I asked him.
“Dean? Is there something that you're not saying about this?" I asked. He tensed slightly, before looking over at me.
“It's certainly not something I expected to happen today. I can't believe how easy it's become to be his friend and nothing else," I said, watching as Draco and Pansy kept in perfect rhythm during their dance. Ron and Theo stood amongst the crowd that had gathered around the two dancers, and I knew they were taking bets on which one would win.
“Thought about it. Unfortunately, that would make things even more uncomfortable between me and my ex. You see, my most recent ex-boyfriend is Ron's older brother Charlie."
“Please Harry. Give me a chance to explain. I didn't kiss him. He kissed me. I actually tried to get away from him, but he used his body to pin me against the wall. I never wanted to hurt you," he whispered. Tears began sliding down his cheeks and he lowered his gaze towards the floor once again.
“No, I want to ride with him because he has a Lamborghini Gallardo," I said, watching Pansy's eyes widen in surprise. The Lamborghini was the one Muggle car that Pansy loved.
“Maternity," Ron answered.
I looked directly into his green eyes, knowing that's how Legilimency worked; as a Legilimens, Harry needed to look directly into someone's eyes to gain access to their mind. I took a breath and concentrated on the shields that protected my mind. Slowly, I let them drop. Immediately, I felt Harry in my mind, running through the last few moments. As soon as he pulled away mentally, my shields snapped back into place.
~~~~~
After showering, I dressed in jeans and a pale green t-shirt. As I emerged from the bathroom, rubbing a towel against my hair, I was greeted by the sight of an old, wizened house elf making my bed. My personal house elf; Kreacher. I had inherited him when I had inherited Grimmauld Place after Sirius' death. He had worked at Hogwarts until I had moved into the Manor. When he had found out that I was living in the house of Narcissa Black Malfoy, he readily came to the Manor, vowing only to serve me. His bat-like ears curved towards his back with tufts of grey hair sticking out of them. His long nose pointed towards his chin and it looked like there was a permanent scowl on his face. For clothes,  though he was technically a free house elf, he insisted on wearing a blood red pillowcase embroidered with the Black family crest. He had used gold colored thread and had sown my initials into the bottom corner.
“Can you tell me what you've been experiencing?" He asked, as he pulled out his wand and began casting diagnostic spells over me.
“You two look good together, Draco. I'm glad that you finally have a chance to be happy." Mother said.
Needing no more encouragement than that, I slowly pulled myself out of him. I thrust myself forward again, burying myself deep inside him. He moaned loudly, hands falling from my back and tangling in the sheet underneath him. I got a rhythm going; slowly pulling out of him, then slowly thrusting back in.
“Ready to go, Draco?" He asked me. He slid his wand into his pocket and his jacket across his shoulders.
Harry was standing on the corner of the street, leaning against a tree. I moved towards him. He straightened up at my approach. I walked right up to him, wrapped my arms around his neck, and pulled him down, locking our lips together.
“It's good to see you Steve, but can you tell me if Carlos is working today?" Hermione asked him. I noticed her hand was in her pocket. I assumed that her fingers were wrapped around her wand.
“Normally, I would use the visitor's room, but after what you just told me, I want Lucius in chains. Now, please take Mr. Potter and young Mr. Malfoy to the interrogation room. I'll catch up shortly."
“Do you know what happened to his face?"
“How do you keep doing wandless magic? I first noticed it last night when you closed the door."
This chapter contains EXPLICIT content.
? Have you lost your mind?"
I made no effort to remove my hand from his hip. I was still trailing my fingers on his bare skin. His skin was so smooth, it felt like silk. I could feel heat between my legs and looked down. A small tent was forming in my trousers.
“Oh, really?" I asked, glancing at the man over my shoulder.
I wasn't aware of him climbing out of the bed, but the next thing I knew, his hands were on my waist and he was turning me around to face him. Without a word, he leaned down and gently pressed his lips to mine. I hesitated a moment, then I leaned into the kiss. Our lips moved gently against each other, soft and warm.
“You know we just broke your rules, right?" He whispered as my eyelids started to close.
“I needed the help of a Mind Healer. I don't know what he's suffering from, but it is clear to me that this is all in his head. These wounds aren't real," Shawnna said.
“Harry, you alright?" Pansy asked.
“ Want to sit down?" Potter asked suddenly.
“I'm a Healer. When it felt like I was choking on something, I knew something was blocking her airway. Not blocking it enough to stop her breathing, but enough to cause her serious pain."
“I noticed last night and right now that you have a far away look in your eyes. Something on your mind?" I reached over and gently grabbed his hand. “You can tell me anything," I said.
I thought to myself. I twisted quickly and apparated into the living room. I turned and ran down the hall to the bedroom.
“But, can't he still make you get married to a pureblood witch? He is still the head of the Malfoy family," Harry said.
“If you don't believe him, Harry, let him show you," Hermione said. She reached out and gently patted his hand. He raised his eyes and gave her a watery smile.
“I don't want to talk about it. Here in your arms, I really don't want to think of him." His arms tightened around me.
“Shall we expect you at the dinner table, or do you want to go back to sleep?" I asked him.
He nodded then reached out and grabbed my hand. He threaded his fingers through mine. We turned and walked down the path away from the cliff, back towards the door. Harry pulled open the door and we entered Azkaban, making our way down the short corridor to where Kingsley and the Aurors were waiting next to the portkey.
Unfortunately, that's how Ron found us. As Blaise ran his tongue across my lips, trying to gain entrance to my mouth, I saw Ron out of the corner of my eye. I opened my mouth and when Blaise swept his tongue in, I bit down as hard as I could. Blaise jerked away as blood spilled from the corner of his mouth. I quickly brought my knee up, catching him in the gut.
------------
“What are you doing here?" I asked him.
“I think that sounds fair enough. We can build that friendship that we should have had since day one."
“I'm awake. Can we talk for a minute, just you and I?" The words came out hesitantly before the stag faded away.
“I can make one for around three thirty this afternoon. Floo directly into my office and I'll escort you there," he said. He stood up from the floor and sat back down in his chair.
“Uncle?" I asked.
He turned from where he was standing next to my fireplace, his robes swirling around his ankles. “Draco, do you not want me to come with you?" He asked. He sounded slightly hurt.
“Yes, I'm his son. But I told you before that he punished me when I did something that he didn't approve of. I'm used to it," I told him.
of all people, would get turned on by
Charlie shook his head vigorously, still not looking at me. I looked down at him for a moment, then I turned to face Draco. “Tell me what's going on," I said.
The memory swirled around us, fading away. “Was Lucius always like that?" I asked.
“Exactly what it looks like; I pulled a few strings and I got you an interview with all of the top Healers at St. Mungo's. You're a great Healer, Draco. Now, you'll have a chance to prove it."
“Draco, I'm fine, really."
“Get Out!" I yelled. I took a step forward. I raised my hands and pushed him. He stumbled backwards. “Get Out and never come back! If you ever step inside Malfoy Manor again, I'll make sure the house elves lock you in the dungeons!"
With those words, he pulled me into a brief hug. I held onto him for as long as I could. When he started to step back, I reluctantly dropped my arms from around him. Harry stepped away and Disapparated with a small pop. I left Mother alone and headed to the library.
