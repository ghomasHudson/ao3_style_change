While he knew where the Slytherin house was located he wasn’t supposed to know, and even if he managed to make it to the entrance, he had no idea what the password was. Groaning at the unfairness that was his life he rubbed the bridge of his nose trying to alleviate the mounting pressure behind his eyes.
“Well, if they are truly your friend Harry, they would know you didn’t mean for them to get hurt,” she said and Anderson nodded his head in agreement, he let out a laugh.
“It gave me no indication what had warranted such a decision, was there anything mentioned to you?” the pit of unease grew, and Harry licked his lips.
“Hey girl,” he said with a smile as she flew straight towards him as he entered the owlery, Draco had gone to find his own familiar while Blaise stood off by the door, not a fan of the winged birds in the room.
As they stopped in front of a large double door Harry breathed deeply trying to calm his erratic heartbeat. Briefly he moved his hand and touched at the vial in his pocket, the pieces of parchment, and the locket with his wand still firmly clenched in his hand.
“I find it interesting that this regards Mister Potter, yet Mister Potter hasn’t spoken,” Harry felt his mouth go dry as all eyes were on him.
“Please Professor, let me go, please!” the cries were getting more hysterical and just as Harry moved enough to see the person pleading a glimmer from his side caught his attention.
“Draco, Blaise doesn’t mean any harm, he just wants to help, I bet he has a potion that could fix up my wrist, do you know which one he’d need?” Harry could feel Draco’s heartbeat pulse rapidly and the blonde clenched his silver Veela eyes shut; Harry could only assume he was battling his Veela side.
“A few weeks ago, Dumbledore asked me to his office and told me that I’m the only one who can destroy Voldemort,” neither of the boys moved and Harry ran his fingers threw his hair, “he told me that Voldemort created a Horcrux of himself, I don’t know why he did, and Dumbledore said that if we found the Horcruxes, destroyed them, we could then destroy Vold – Tom, for good,” Harry trailed off, closing his eyes for a moment.
“Draco, it’s not worth it, he’s harmless, yeah he was behind what happened to my room, but aside from that he’s just acting like a child,” Draco’s ears perked at the mention of his room.
“Think nothing of it Mister Potter,” the three walked to the entrance and Harry was in awe at the sheer size of the manor.
So, nine in the morning on September first had Harry standing in Mister Spaulding’s back office in front of the floo. The man had told him that it would take him to Kings Cross Station and at Harry’s confused look the man explained how the floo system had been put in at the station years ago to help families.
“But I will always be by your side Harry, I will always support you, I will always believe in you, I just need some more information to go off of,” Draco stressed and Harry heard the truth of his words and his shoulders deflated.
“It’ll be fine,” and as Draco tugged Harry into his arms in the Floo he looked up at his mate questionably, the blonde pressed his lips to the top of his head, “The wards won’t recognize you without a Malfoy accompanying you,” he muttered and clenching his eyes tight he pressed into Draco’s chest as the Veela grabbed the Floo powder and with a shout of ‘Malfoy manor’ green smoke swirled around them and they were gone.
Finally gathering his Gryffindor courage, he picked up his bookbag and made his way to the library, checking once more that Malfoy hadn’t moved.
“Uh, well Nott, bathroom’s all yours, I’ll just be heading out then,” it was two steps before a spell sizzled by him, frowning, Harry tempered his annoyance.
“I won’t let anything bad happen, Severus,” there was a moment of silent debate between the two and Harry held his breath.
“We were wondering if anyone happened to come in here of late?” it was the dainty voice of missus Malfoy and Harry’s curiosity peaked, they were searching for someone, but who.
Draco had wrapped his arm possessively around Harry’s shoulders and snarled at the trio, Harry could only imagine what his Veela side was feeling.
“What do we do next Professor?” he questioned as the silence lingered longer than normal and with the absence of probing his mind for information Harry was getting increasingly on edge.
Heading back to his group Harry was grateful that none of them had gone off to see what had been keeping him though as Harry sat down, he realized Neville was packing up.
Harry felt warmth blossom through him as he pressed his ear against the other teen’s chest, taking a moment to feel at ease at the heartbeat.
The group chatted for a few more minutes before both the Head Boy and Girl announced that they were headed to the Great Hall. Harry watched as Pansy sulked back to Nott when Draco had ignored her in favor with talking with him and Blaise.
Shoving the key back into his pocket he gave Hermione and Luna a hug goodbye seeing as the girls were staying at the castle for the break.
“What brings you in today?” Harry’s heart was racing, and he could only hope that Mister Spaulding wouldn’t call out his action.
For the next hour Harry told her everything, from being resorted into Slytherin to befriending Blaise, he told her about his fallout with Ron and how Hermione and his friends had been supportive of him. Once she seemed to relax, he felt more at ease opening to her. He opted to not tell her anything about his dreams or being Riddle’s heir but told her of the special things Draco had done for him; she seemed to puff up as he praised her only child.
“Well Potter, we had better make the best of our time,” he had just pinned Harry’s wrists above the tasseled hair when a loud knock had them both glancing towards the door.
“You knew Draco’s parents when they were bonded?” he asked incredulously and snapped his mouth shut at the man’s annoyed look.
When Harry had finally got back to the Slytherin common room he plopped next to Draco who had his own texts sprawled open and his History of Magic essay half-way completed. Blaise was sitting across from him jotting down his own set of notes.
Keeping his wand level as he stared down two wands, he could feel his magic tingling beneath his skin.
They walked past the sections he had seen before until they got to the furthest corner of the shop. Harry looked at the cabinet interestedly as there didn’t seem to be a theme of what they items were. Alexander grabbed a flat stone from the top shelf and rubbed it gently before presenting it to Harry.
Though between classes Malfoy was no where to be found yet managed to already be sitting in class or show up right before it started.
“Explain Potter, because if I can’t kill you, I’d be happy to kill your companions,” there was a lack of heat behind Tom’s words and Harry had a feeling that the man was more talk then anything.
he hissed and gave a satisfied smirk at the click that came from the door, pushing it open he peered inside.
“Get Snape,” not checking to see if Blaise had heard him, he rounded the next corner and in front of the familiar stone passage.
Hermione, Neville, and Luna had found him at one point, Luna thrusting a sandwich and apple into his hands with a knowing smile. None of them questioned his mood but opted to talk about classes and how the other two resorted students were handing their new houses.
“Well, you’re healing Mister Potter, but your body took a substantial amount of injuries and while I believe you’d be best here for the following few days,” at Harry’s look of misery, she chuckled, “I know you’d sneak out of here as soon as you could,” Harry gave her a cheeky smile.
“And you two have known about this?” the question was directed to both Draco and Blaise who nodded in confirmation, and Hermione sent a very McGonagall look at him, Harry shrugged helplessly at her.
“Despite what you might hear, Malfoy’s aren’t abusive to the help, while I have no idea of the names, we don’t hurt them,” memories of Dobby flashed and Harry just hummed; tugging at the blankets wrapped around them he let out a chuckle as Draco whined.
“Caught two Gryffindor’s snogging, and a group of Ravenclaw’s leaving the library after curfew, Madam Pince vouched for them, but other than that it was uneventful,” the blonde groan as Harry wiggled to get into his favorite sleeping position with the blonde.
“No, they don’t know, I hadn’t expected to talk with them about it until the Easter holidays, if even then,” the tension grew thick and Harry shifted uncomfortably.
“You said that Dumbledore was going to talk with Severus, we should ensure that he’ll agree to support you going to Zabini manor over holidays,” making a silent        ‘ah’ motion with his mouth the three entered the Potions room after hearing a summons from the other side.
“Harry, you know there’s nothing going on between them, right? You’re his mate, he loves you,” still feeling tense Harry gave a curt nod, his eyes homed in on the common room entrance.
“It was a great break Professor, I’m really happy that I got to spend time with Blaise,” thinking of Draco he felt himself give a genuine loving smile, Dumbledore nodded as he stroked his beard.
Ginny shifted uncomfortably in her seat as Neville shot Harry a worried look. Luna just smiled and reached forward to lightly touch his clenched fist. Threading their fingers together she gave his hand a squeeze.
Grasping the sides of the basin Harry pushed all his magic into it, to reaching the locket, and it was as if a tight band had been broken and the locket shot out. It went sailing past him and rolled down towards the edge of the island. Without thinking Harry rushed after it, using his magic in such a way had unexpectedly drained him and he fell to his knees panting and gasping for breath. He barely noticed as white bone curled around uninjured calf and dragged him under the water once more.
“So, if we make the potion and use some of my blood then we can see if it’s true?” Draco nodded and Harry sagged in relief. While it wasn’t an immediate answer, they had a direction to go with.
“Mister Potter?” but before Harry had a chance to speak Professor Snape entered the room followed closely by Professor Dumbledore, both men looked less than pleased at the situation.
“Got it, I’ll be right back,” the Zabini heir stepped outside of the room and returned a few minutes later with the potion needed; he edged cautiously towards them and handed the vial to Draco, which was immediately snatched and analyzed, despite the trust between friends Harry felt the flicker of uncertainty flare through their bond.
No points had been assigned so far; McGonagall wasn’t one to reward students for doing what was expected.
holding his towel tight Harry’s conjured shield was able to absorb the first spell though he was surprised to see that the Reducto had been aimed at the wall next to him. As the spell hit the brick Harry winced as it shattered.
Harry let out an unsteady breath and held himself, he knew he wasn’t crazy; Draco let out a small sigh.
“These dreams have led me to find out that I’m a Riddle’s heir,” Harry waited for any sort of acknowledgment, when silence greeted him, he opted to continue.
Students were still wandering around the halls as dinner ended and Harry bided his time until someone walked in or out of the Hospital Wing.
he moaned and tried to roll over, it was only half five and he wanted to get a few more minutes of sleep.
The snowball war between the three went on until it began to get too dark to cast spells towards one another. Soaked and pleased with themselves Harry, along with his two cohorts, made their way into Hogwarts.
“I’ll see you in the morning Harry,” making a noise of acknowledgement Harry barely managed to get in his pajama bottoms before sliding under the covers and falling asleep.
Turning slightly, he found himself in one of the alcoves off to the side. There was a plump chair with a table next to it angled just right to look out the window. It was such a secluded spot Harry could only imagine it was the Headmaster’s personal space to unwind. Eyes flickering, he looked up and found himself unable to control his mouth dropping open.
It was one of the mysteries that had eluded Harry since the incident happened, now he only hoped that Dumbledore punished them accordingly.
“Interesting, well as soon as you have a vision, please see me immediately,” sensing that the conversation was over Harry made to stand.
It was the beginning of March when Snape had held back the trio after one of their Potions classes, homework had become exhausting and each were looking forward to a reprieve from it all.
Hand’s raised in a defensive gesture Blaise took a step back and looked at his best friend concernedly.
Relaxing his shoulder’s, he felt the stress of the situation ebb away and he smiled as Draco pressed a kiss to his temple as he pulled away. Snape was watching the two as if he was searching for something, Harry wondered if he found whatever he was looking for.
“I’m sor-” Draco hand was quick and with ease he placed it over Harry’s lips, effectively silencing the smaller Slytherin.
, with this is what you’d get in ‘traditional’ torture like blood and screaming except rather than knives or other means of torture it’s magic causing the victim pain.
“Well, if you need anything Harry, let me know,” beaming towards his friend he nodded and his attention was diverted when a second year, the name completely skipping him, came over to ask Draco for help with homework.
“I, I fund Slythrin’s book, for – for,” he panted, feeling helpless as Draco ushered him back into bed, “Horx, takes nngy to read,” he sighed and leaned into Draco’s hand that started to caress his head.
“Let’s go Potter,” the teasing tone wasn’t missed and Harry felt his ears burn that he’d been caught ogling the taller boy, it had been happening more lately and Harry admitted to himself that he was curious about things more than kissing.
He had confided more in Seviper and the snake was adamant to accompany Harry when he did eventually meet with Tom, especially once Harry had told the snake that Tom had one of his own, Nagini.
Another pop and Laci had brought a tray of tea and another that had sandwiches on it. Harry eyed Blaise who picked up the tea and sipped on it carefully, mimicking his friend, he did the same.
“Wait, you were alone? Harry,” toeing the rug that was identical in his room Harry rubbed the back of his head uncomfortably.
“Find the Horcruxes and locate a journal that Salazar Slytherin left?” Harry nodded as Neville ran his fingers through his hair.
Harry had managed to read half of Salazar’s book and while he still hadn’t found anything about the Horcruxes he had learned a lot about the man himself. Salazar was present each night, reminding him to concentrate when his mind would wander, and to clarify something when his magic mixed up words or phrases.
Harry ushered the group into Honeydukes and made quick work picking Blaise’s favorite chocolates. He picked up some extra and figured that if anything he could overwhelm the taller boy with a mass amount of chocolates for a gift. He picked up a few items that Draco liked and made sure he grabbed some raspberry and orange chocolate for himself. He wouldn’t be back to Hogsmeade until the start of next term and needed to be stocked up for the holidays.
“A blind wizard could see that Blaise fancies her, they had Prefect rounds together the last two weeks and I overheard him asking McGonagall if he could be assigned with her again,” Harry’s eyebrow raised and he gaped, he didn’t know that; Draco smirked at the stunned expression.
“I promise I’ll tell you everything Hermione, just,” he paused, “not right now,” at her hurt look he felt a pang sting his heart and as much as he wanted to comfort her, he refrained.
“Harry, there is no way that you can be Riddle’s heir,” it was Hermione who spoke first, she looked between him and the two other Slytherin’s that sat next to him, “are you sure you haven’t been influenced to think this?” she commented hesitantly and Harry immediately picked up what she was implying.
“And, what now, we’re stuck together for life? You’ll have control over me? Demand submission and I’ll be pregnant with a kid by the end of the year? Stuck at home taking care of a family?” the questions seem to flow, and with each one Harry found his frustration grow, “and with no choice or say in anything,” he finished softly.
As Harry walked to the door his hand stilled before he touched the knob, there was something that had been nagging at him since he had looked at the Pensive.
“I gave birth a week early on a gloomy night. I had one contraction after the other throughout the day and the women of the facility surrounded me, comforted me. It was nearing ten at night when I heard the first cries. My heart felt full of love at that moment, my baby was a little boy,” Harry felt his own heart swell at the happiness etched on her face.
“We can find a nice classroom to work on it,” her curly blonde hair was in his face and he controlled a gag as her perfume wafted around him, it was sickly sweet and made his stomach curdle.
The blue wings stretched out and Harry picked up Missus Malfoy’s subdue demeanor on the side; she seemed panicked at what was transpiring yet didn’t move to intervene.
Creeping slowly, he edged around the first corner at the bottom of the stairs and measured his footsteps carefully; while he knew nothing would crawl out of the shadows at him that didn’t mean he wouldn’t be cautious.
Dumbledore picked up the ring, and Harry felt his pulse in his ears; he felt sick, he wanted nothing more to be back at Hogwarts. He wanted Draco and he wanted to be as far away from Albus Dumbledore as possible.
Harry’s anxiety spiked and he looked panicked at the locket. His magic was reacting to his emotions running high and the locket started to stir, as if trying to follow through a summons, his concentration shifted as something clutched at his leg.
“Well no one has tried to attack me, everyone’s pretty much ignored me,” Neville nodded, and Harry’s mood soured, “Ron had a blow up with me before breakfast,” Neville’s eyebrows shot up.
“I know you’re their Potter,” finally letting out a laugh that he had held in he was quick to move out of the way as Draco tried to reach for him.
“What do you want Potter,” the sneer on his face was reminiscent of the last five years and had been absent since the start of term.
Deciding he needed to do more research on meditation he grabbed the books he was flipping through, even the few about inheritances he hadn’t read, and rushed back up to Madam Pince asking about meditation books. She looked as suspicious as she had been earlier but directed him to a different part of the library.
The remainder of the night was spent with the two intertwined with one another and Harry sporting a few new marks on his neck.
“You could have called a house elf to get you your things,” the blonde teased and Harry laughed, feeling much better than he had earlier that morning.
There was swift movement and with an ease that the Slytherin Prefect possessed Draco positioned himself in front of his mate. Draco’s shoulders were taunt, and Harry had to push aside the urge to rub them until they relaxed, he did take note that Draco hadn’t reached for his wand.
“How was your night?” he asked Draco as Blaise ushered them to the nearest couch and Harry felt momentarily relaxed as he realized they weren’t rushing to Malfoy manor.
The bond between them screamed and Harry dropped down on a knee as his vision began to get clouded, he felt as if he were under the curse itself, Draco was in so much pain.
“Draco, darling there you are we were beginning to wonder what had taken so long,” recognizing the voice of Missus Malfoy Harry tried to push aside the pounding in his ears as he could barely see the woman stand and approach her son.
“He’s clearly let his Veela side take over, will you wait here?” Snape nodded and Missus’ Malfoy’s blue eyes turned towards him, oddly enough her eyes reminded him of her Veela’s wings.
When he had explained to his friends what was happening each had their own idea how to boost his energy after Draco had warned him that he could become addicted to the Wideye Potion. Neville had suggested coffee, which Hermione had pointed out would have adverse effects on his health; Luna had opted for an herbal blend, which Hermione had made a face, and Blaise had suggested liquor or sex, which had Hermione smacking him upside the head – a fond gesture that had Blaise smirking towards her and Harry watching the exchange interestedly.
“Missus, there’s a man in the main waiting room,” the elf trembled, “he’s be wanting to see Mister Potter,” Harry stilled as did Missus Malfoy; she regained her composure quickly and dismissed the creature, standing and turning towards him she brushed off his shoulders.
Magic continued to swarm around Tom’s heart as a red pulsing orb lift out of the man. Harry noticed that Dumbledore was sweating something fierce, whatever he was doing was taxing on his own magic and his own strength.
“I wish you and your boyfriend the best of luck in these trying times Mister Potter,” saying his goodbyes Harry left the shop as his mind kept wandering to wings; he knew that Veela had wings and he couldn’t help but wonder what Draco’s looked like.
“S’kay?” distracted by Draco’s morning voice his eyes caught sight of a house elf on the side of the bed, hands covering its face and Harry detected that it was shaking.
“I’m sorry Professor that we couldn’t get the locket,” he lied easily, and the man turned glanced towards him.
“Mother, I’m fine, and I will be fine,” Draco said with a crack in his voice and Harry’s heart leaped and he quelled the urge to offer him water.
It was the last weekend that students were able to meander through Hogsmeade and Harry was soaking up the sun that he so desperately missed while he was in the dungeon’s. There weren’t too many students who took advantage of the break ask they flooded to the library to get some extra time in to study but Harry was jittery, he needed a break.
It had been there since before his first day of Hogwarts and according to the ghosts the book was Rowena Ravenclaw’s idea to help students find their way around the vast library. The book was like a large index, flipping through the pages a student could look up where in the library the book was that they needed. Presently, most students still relied on Madam Pince who knew where everything was at, but it got Harry curious.
he waited a moment before he felt the snake slither along the sheets and flicker its tongue out at him.
“Draco will be fine, he’s strong, whatever happened, he will be okay,” Harry nodded moodily. Shaking his head to quell the fear in his mind, he wiped off his face with the sleeve of his shirt and pushed back his shoulders.
Whomever had sabotaged his room hadn’t let up, and Harry had been on the receiving end of powder, slime, and glitter, all which caused him some sort of harm. He still hadn’t gone to Madame Pomfrey but opted to get help from both Hermione and Neville. Harry had finally perfected a ward for his room only after approaching Professor Flitwick who, once he had corrected Harry’s wrist position, had conjured a perfect ward; he had received fifteen points and the Professor’s high praise.
Sagging in Draco’s arms Harry felt the last bit of strength leave him and as Draco urged the group to head towards the common room Harry rested more of his body weight on the Veela. Draco didn’t seem to mind at all.
Harry hesitated, eyeing the students nearby, while most were in their own conversations it was the Slytherin house and someone was always listening in. Blaise immediately picked up the body language and grabbed a bagel and an apple.
A cough brought the two out of their trance and Harry felt his ears warm as Hermione looked at them with a raised brow, Blaise smirking next to her.
Blaise was hesitant as he left Harry at the door to his dorm room, but Harry swore that he’d stay put until the following morning. It was only late afternoon, but Harry had felt like he had been up for hours.
“My husband and I knew that anyone could have ended up as Draco’s mate. The Veela side of him seeks out the most compatible partner. We had hoped it would have been someone of different standing,” she said silkily and set aside her napkin, she gave him a pointed look.
As Draco ushered Harry to an available bed Blaise directed the two first years to the ones next to him, Madam Pomfrey had heard them come in and her eyes narrowed at the sight of them as her steps quickened. She waved her wand over the nosey students and pulled their curtains shut.
Harry watched in horror as the green light morphed around Tom’s heart and a cut was ripped through his shirt and through his skin. The screams were becoming unbearable, yet Dumbledore didn’t seem swayed by them.
The following night Harry kept an eye on Draco and Blaise as they headed out of the common room prepared to make their rounds, he observed as Draco wore one of his nicer coats and stuffed an ingredient bag in his breast pocket. The boys said goodbye and Harry waited until the common room entrance closed before hurrying back into his own room.
It was when Draco asked him to pass him something for his hair that the blonde caught sight of Harry’s swollen and bruised wrist, grabbing his arm gently the blonde looked down at his mate with a mix of horror and fury at the injury. Harry blinked a handful of times and rotated it, wincing as it made a clicking noise and pain shot up his arm.
“Draco, Draco, Draco,” he blabbered, eyes clenched shut, he could feel the build up as his cock pulsed, once, twice, and then he was cumming in Draco’s mouth.
It was evident that the store had been around for quite some time, paint was thinned on parts of the wall, shelves seemed to be worn, and there was a musty smell that lingered which reminded him of parts of Grimmauld Place. Harry could see rings, ornaments, knickknacks, canes, earrings, lining the shelves and walls of the building. Glancing towards the voice Harry saw an elderly man sitting behind a counter with a smile on his face. His greying hair was trimmed short and large round glasses framed his face, he was wearing a thick flannel sweater and his blue eyes were watching him carefully.
“What is this Potter,” he hissed, and Harry refrained from reaching out to steady him as the man swayed.
Flopping on the bed, Seviper slithered over his shoulder and coiled up on his chest, stroking the scales Harry closed his eyes.
“Of the three blood heir rituals that were done with success it was found that they were the heir but,” she hesitated, “it wasn’t the success that was expected.”
“When I told you in the library that Draco and I were in a relationship, I didn’t manage to tell you that he was a Veela,” Harry glanced towards Draco who was relaxing a bit more having controlled his Veela side when no one was attempting to insult his mate or himself.
“C’mon Harry, this way,” the taller boy steered him towards the entrance of the manor while explaining the various aspects of the garden.
“This is the room Missus Malfoy told me to take you too,” Harry went to say something when the elf shook its head, ears flopping from side to side.
“What are you talking about Harry, Dumbledore is the beacon of the light side, he could never, would never, create Voldemort,” Blaise cautiously said, worry masking his face.
Students were chatting and Harry felt the familiar presence of Draco next to him as a fifth-year student came to check both him and Murphy over; he was an aspiring healer and had been given clearance to be stationed on the sideline for minor injuries.
Not seeing either of the first years where they were earlier Harry shrugged and left the common room.
“Draco, it can’t be real,” his voice cracked, and it took all his control to reign in his emotions and to not let his magic lash out around them.
With students dragging their feet Snape shot the stragglers a glare and within a matter of minutes the common room was empty except for the injured group, Blaise and Draco, and the remaining Prefects; both Head Boy and Girl had been instructed to check on the students in their rooms and verify once more that everyone was accounted for.
Harry wasn’t interested in doing homework. The Horcruxes were still at the forefront of his mind and as his emerald eyes wandered the library, they landed on the large book sitting on a table near the library entrance.
“I hope that you’ve been enjoying your stay! What can I help you with?” putting the papers on the desk she focused on him, seemingly trying to look more collected than she was.
“What happened to my son, Mister Potter,” she hissed, yet before Harry opened his mouth to say something she continued, “I felt my husband’s rage, his uncontrollable fury, and once he got back to the manor he had Draco in his arms and he didn’t even recognize me. Do you understand how far back he is into his Veela mindset? It’s been years since Lucius has lost control, so explain to me, how in such a short amount of time something managed to happen, and I want all the details,” it was a fury like no other and Harry winced as she explained her husband’s state, he clearly lacked any understanding of the Veela nature.
“He is my mate father, you will accept it because I’m not leaving him, not now, not ever,” anger surged through their bond and for a moment Harry’s vision swayed, Draco was mad, very mad.
“I don’t trust you Malfoy, you’ve been awful since our first year at Hogwarts and I don’t know what you’ve said or done to convince Harry that you’ve changed but I’m not buying it, it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve convinced Harry –“ she was about to continue when Draco roared and made to move towards the witch.
Glancing up at Draco the Veela’s face was blank, but Harry could sense that the boy was angry, even looking towards Blaise his brown eyes were darker than they had been before.
It was Friday night and Draco had Quidditch practice, he had left in a good mood after spending time with Harry, but right before he left he had handed Harry a box with strict instructions not to open it until the following morning after breakfast.
From what Harry could tell, it was a normal stone. It was flat, grey, and incased in a silver chain. Weighing it in his hand it felt light and smooth to the touch.
“If I can’t kill you with magic,” he didn’t finish what he was staying as his hands lunged towards him, his fingers barely grazed his neck as Harry shimmered gold once more. Tom hissed as his pulled back his hands, Harry looked down to see that they were red, as if burned.
“Those who have been sorted into Hufflepuff are some of the kindest people that you can meet, people who want the best from you and for you, that are supportive; Hufflepuff’s shouldn’t be put down because they aren’t brave like a Gryffindor – being a loyal friend takes more bravery than facing down a beast in the forest; Hufflepuff’s don’t need to be sneaky and sly like a Slytherin to get what they want, they work for it and earn it, and Hufflepuff’s brilliance can rival that of a Ravenclaw because they believe in themselves and of other’s,” as he thought of Neville, one of his most loyal, true friend, the door splintered behind him but Harry was too angry to care.
“My gran explained to me that I have control of the Longbottom finances since my parents passed away, you’re not a legal adult in the wizarding world until you’re eighteen but it’s been found that between sixteen and eighteen witches and wizards can adjust into their responsibilities rather than be forced to understand right at eighteen,” Neville interjected, face pinching as he mentioned his parents.
As she pulled away, he watched her glance at something behind him and whatever it was that she saw she looked up at him with curiosity.
“As we have been working on Harry is putting you under increase pressure to make you control your focus on your wandless skills and not have it waver with distractions,” Harry shifted between his feet with unease, he had a sinking suspicion where this was headed.
“I see your lying skills haven’t improved in the slightest, Mister Malfoy must not be teaching you the tricks he learned at a young age,” at the mention of his mate Harry’s face fell and he heard the Professor sigh.
“Well, we weren’t able to celebrate Valentine’s together, so I wanted to make it up to you,” tugging at his arm Harry let himself be pulled into the blonde’s embrace and opened his lips willingly as Draco’s lips descended on his.
“That was Fiendfyre Harry, no matter what magic Tom had around the locket, it would have been destroyed,” sagging in relief Harry had to refrain from reaching down to check in is pocket that the locket was safe, the Riddle magic was there, he knew it.
“We each found our place where we wanted our portrait’s to be hung, places that meant the most to us, where we could be the most useful to students, we never intended to be moved and hidden away,” Harry felt a pang at his heart.
Thank you to everyone that has reviewed or followed the story, it’s so encouraging to know so many people like what I’m writing.
Professor McGonagall congratulated the students on their house placements but as she went to reach for the hat when the hat did something unexpected, it sang again.
There were certain things that she wouldn’t divulge with him. He had pressed and she had changed the topic immediately, Harry suspected that once she told him certain things that she’d disappear for good.
Harry peered into the depths of his bag with a grin at the snake’s look of agitation directed at him.
Draco tugged at the hair on the back of his neck, which tickled, “I feel fine, there are some lingering twinges and I’ve had a few spasms, but Severus stopped by yesterday and said that was completely normal, a few more days and I should be perfectly fine,” the blonde responded just as soft, Harry hummed and shifted between his feet and caught Draco’s perceptive glance.
“Draco, don’t you have a group to join?” Murphy’s tone was light but that didn’t stop Draco from shooting the older boy an irritated look.
“So, really, all you have to do is think of a happy memory,” she took a step forward and Harry felt a trill of panic.
He didn’t understand how Tom had come about learning what a Horcrux was let alone how to split his soul into not one, but multiple pieces. If there was little to no information inside the school, and Tom rarely went back to the orphanage except for summer break, someone had told him about it. Though, who would know enough of that dark magic to even understand it themselves.
Neither spoke as they rounded the corner, yet Harry caught Blaise’s excitement as he was pressed towards the bookstore.
“It’s nothing Draco, promise, I can handle myself,” as Draco stalked closer to him Harry felt his skin tingle as he could feel the power emitting from the blonde.
“I forgot that I have to meet up with the fifth years for a tutoring session, will you guys be okay?” the taller Hufflepuff asked and Harry rolled his eyes good naturally, he heard Draco lecture their fellow sixth year that Harry was to be with someone at all times.
“Well, I was angry with you, I was frustrated that you had the information that I’ve been looking for,” Salazar waved a hand at him, clearly annoyed.
Both teens made their way onto the Hogwarts Express and found a compartment in the middle of the train. As they got comfortable and waited for the rest of the students to arrive Harry and Luna chatted amicably about their summers. Luna was explaining how she and her father had sought out a group of Wackspurts that had been causing their neighbors distress.
Palms sweating and heart racing Harry sat on the stool once more, a second later his vision was obscured by the brim of the hat.
“I see you’re having troubles getting ready for your date tomorrow,” picking up a few articles of clothing Blaise hummed as he started to divide the clothes into separate piles.
Moans filled the room as Draco let himself go and Harry was pleased not fifteen minutes later, he was being held by the taller teen, both completely satisfied.
“Tom was always interested in the Dark Arts during his time at Hogwarts, it was evident with his career choice that he was planning something, but,” Dumbledore’s tone changed, “I believe that if we find the Horcruxes, destroy them, we can destroy Voldemort,” Harry’s heart hammered in his chest, this was a lot to take in.
“Murphy,” Draco said curtly, with his Pureblood mannerisms in place, but Harry pushed aside the blonde’s cold tone as he looked at the number of students that filled the room.
“Talking doesn’t hurt, if anything it might clear some things up,” the dark-skinned boy said confidently.
“I saw that you left it in the hospital wing, it helped calm my Veela down. After I had woken up I was on so many different potions my Veela side still tried to find you but seeing your robe gave me hope that you were okay,” he finished with a whisper and Harry tugged at him and pulled him closer for a kiss.
Still a bit shaky and at random moments would involuntarily twitch, Harry managed to help Draco to the bathroom to relieve himself. It didn’t take much coaxing to get the Veela into the shower and cleaned up and Harry eagerly stepped in behind it.
“I don’t know what to do Draco, what are you supposed to do with this information,” the adrenaline that had been coursing through him from the last hours had whittled away and he was feeling drained.
It was a surreal feeling coming to terms with no longer hating Tom. He hated Voldemort, the Dark Lord had killed his parents, his Godfather, and probably thousands of other people, but Tom had been used and manipulated by someone he trusted to be a pawn in a game where he lost everything.
“Will you teach me? I can imagine lesson’s with you would be a lot easier than with Snape,” he said bitterly, and Draco made a murmur of agreement.
Dinner was a typical affair except that the group sat with one another at the end of the Slytherin table. Since it was an informal meal setting many students mingled with another and sat at various tables, the group did receive some odd looks, especially once the Weasley siblings had entered, but with ease the looks were ignored.
“Veela’s love their families, Mister Potter. A Veela takes a lot of pride in their children, just as much as they have for their mate, Draco is everything to Lucius,” her voice was void of the anger that had been there a second earlier and still rooted to his spot, Harry didn’t know what to say.
“I will never forgive you for putting them in danger,” he bit out and Ginny let out another sob, Hermione clucked disapprovingly as she hovered next to the Gryffindor.
“I’m impressed,” Harry chuckled, wiping the few tears away that had appeared, and Draco looked down at him.
“Harry,” and in that moment, Harry’s heart began to beat rapidly, glancing towards Draco, Harry looked back at the parchment at the blonde’s surprised look.
He also hadn’t expected the resulting spark that the impact had triggered, it felt like a burst of electricity had run up and down his entire body. Dazed, Harry looked into the concerned eyes of Zabini and the stunned expression of Malfoy, who Harry had bumped into. Waving off the offered hand Harry stood up and moved around them, muttering his apologies he hurried back into the castle, unaware that Malfoy’s eyes hadn’t left his retreating form.
“You were meant to be with Ron, Hermione, and Harry we were meant to be together, we’ve crushed on each other for awhile now,” Harry winced.
“He did, it’s one of his favorite accessories,” he said with a fond smile, which was completely true – Draco had a habit of making sure his pocket watch was always on him and had even charmed it unbreakable when he played Quidditch.
Scarcely acknowledging the pulse of magic from the locket Harry cried out as a wave of heat pushed them forward; rocks were beginning to fall as the cave began to shake and with one last burst of adrenaline Harry tumbled into the rowboat.
It wasn’t until Madam Pince shooed the boys out that the three made their way back to the common room. Lost in thought he felt a gentle bump on his shoulder and looked up to see that Draco had nudged him, giving him a smile. The butterflies returned. As the three said goodnight for the evening and went into their separate rooms it was the first time Harry felt a special sense of happiness wash over him.
“There’s no spell or something you needed to say for me to enter?” his green eyes peered into the room taking in the blonde’s space.
Once in his room Harry glanced up to see the Slytherin Prefect had walked to his closet and hung up his robe, Harry couldn’t feel anything and wondered what was going through his mates’ mind.
“Professor Dumbledore, attacking a student has a minimum punishment of suspension if not expulsion. They knowingly went out of their way to target Harry and the first years,” her tone was clipped, and Harry picked up that she was angry, very angry.
“When word got out this was your introduction duel they wanted to see how you would fair,” motioning him into the center of the oval Harry watched as Draco leaned up against the wall, wand clutched in his hand with his arms folded and his eyes did not leave Harry’s body.
His body shivered as the crisp air whipped around him as they left the manor and he cursed himself for not grabbing a jacket, he truthfully hadn’t expected to need it. If his discomfort was noticeable Missus Malfoy didn’t acknowledge it.
Harry surveyed their surroundings carefully and held his wand tighter. He knew that the forest was dangerous and really hoped that they wouldn’t come across anything that wanted to hurt them.
“My boy, you’re in no state to be disagreeing with me,” the Headmaster’s wand prodded the sphere and Tom let out another scream.
Though as Dumbledore’s eyes softened as he looked from the sixth year Slytherin to the fifth year Weasley, Harry realized with much anger that his fellow housemate was going to take the brunt of the punishment.
The walk back to the common room was quiet as Harry still couldn’t believe that he had gotten off from a hand job in the darker hallways of the dungeon; sneaking glances Harry chuckled at the saucy look that was plastered on the Veela.
“Not much Professor, many won’t talk to me outside of our schoolwork,” he said guardedly, Dumbledore looked disheartened.
The cut had gone down through the middle and his papers scattered everywhere while his bottle of ink shattered. Harry’s anger spiked and the light fixture above them moved.
“I’ve noticed you’re spending more time with Mister Malfoy and Mister Zabini,” Harry began to feel uncomfortable; he knew the Headmaster was probing for information.
Zabini had the group stop in front of wall and Harry smiled at the curious looks that were directed towards the taller boy, smirking their Prefect looked to the wall and gave the password.
She returned minutes later with a jar of green paste, she instructed him to coat the burn with it, wrap it, and then wash it off the following morning. It would take a day or two before it healed completely, as Harry thanked her and walked towards the entrance of the green house, she called out to him.
“Draco? Draco? You’re okay, I’m right here,” murmuring random nonsense the Veela seemed to calm down and the twitching lessened at Harry’s words.
It was the second Saturday of the month and Harry had found himself on the bleachers in the Quidditch stands watching the Slytherin’s first practice. He hadn’t participated in tryouts nor had been asked, which frankly, Harry wasn’t too disgruntled about. Shuffling his papers about he watched as Malfoy assigned practice maneuvers; the teams new set of Beaters were two third years, both unfortunately lacked the strength necessary for the position; Crabbe and Goyle had been ideal, and with a lack of participants the two third years were the houses’ only option.
“We have to leave soon, if we’re lucky mother hasn’t cleared the table of breakfast,” Blaise said dryly as moments elapsed in silence, each teen lost in their own thoughts.
Grabbing a handful of floo powder Harry thanked Mister Spaulding once more before the green light surrounded him and he shouted, ‘Kings Cross Station.’
Though now, Harry wasn’t in any position to listen to them talk as he dry-heaved in the boys bathroom, shivering and shaking as his body tried to throw up his insides. Draco hadn’t moved from his side and was whispering comforting words and as Harry began to stand up Draco had held under his arms as he swayed.
“Thank you, Neville,” she giggled as the Hufflepuff’s cheeks tinted pink; Harry was about to make a comment when he watched Hermione walk in next to Ron and his heart dropped, unsure what to make of the scene.
Unsure of how to wake himself Harry slipped into the library and hid among a row of books. Clenching his eyes shut tight he concentrated hard on waking up in Flagley. The door to the library open and closed and Harry could make out footsteps coming his direction. Pinching himself his eyes snapped open.
It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the dark consuming most of the room as his eyes easily trailed the sides of the wall towards the lit candles at the opposite end. Sitting between the candles, thumbing a book between his fingers was the man Harry had been looking for.
“You’ll be able to flow to and from the Malfoy manor,” Draco said as they found an available bench in the courtyard, it was fairly empty as many of the students were filling the library to its capacity, or to the amount that Madam Pince could tolerate.
The first snowball that his Neville in the back of the shoulder had the Hufflepuff stopping short and looking confused over his shoulder. Brown eyes were stunned as he realized a moment too late what was about to happen as another snowball crashed down onto his hat.
“Harry, where are we? I was in a dream and then everything changed, I felt a pull and then suddenly I was here,” he trailed off as his silver eyes finally locked on the woman behind him and a flicker of jealously flared. Harry stepped closer to the Veela and coaxed his mate to look down and lock eyes with him.
It was nearing the time when the train was scheduled to leave the station that Neville opened the door with a huff and Harry waved his friend in. Sitting himself next to Blaise and across from Harry the Hufflepuff pinned him with a look.
“There is nothing, nothing going on between Draco and Astoria, I promise you,” Harry held back the scathing retort and turned back towards where his dorm room was. He didn’t want to deal with this right now.
“Moving on, I’ve found the potion instruction that we’ll need to brew, there’s,” he hesitated, and Harry was on alert, “some challenges to it.”
“I want you gone, I want you no where near my son!” the voice had dropped an octave and as Harry glanced up at the man standing above him, he finally took note of his Veela characteristics on display.
It was a gloomy Tuesday afternoon that Harry found himself in an unusual group consisting of the Slytherin first years, Hermione and Luna. The five were insistent on passing the end of year exams in the top of the class and had pestered Harry for additional advice on study techniques.
“What happened to your leg?!” came the surprised cry and Harry blearily opened his eyes to see Draco’s look of distraught as he caught sight of the dried paste covering a portion of his leg.
“He’s remembering, we have to find the rest of them,” he murmured and the Slytherin’s shared a glance.
“Why do you have to like them!” the voice had come out of nowhere and Harry turned in his chair and gripped his wand tighter as he came face to face with Ginny, the red head had a look of hurt and anger in her eyes and Harry shifted uneasily as the group got quiet.
The three boys agreed that they would spend the remaining days leading up to break trying to learn more about Harry’s dreams and what it could mean. Heading back inside Harry felt better knowing that he wasn’t alone with this, and while his heart longed for both Ron and Hermione, as he listened to Draco and Blaise map out what books they should look through first, he was grateful he had another two he could count on.
Neville looked unconvinced and Harry was counting down the seconds until the spell would start, Neville needed to be gone because he needed Blaise and Draco to leave.
“The Floo will recognize you if you need to return,” Blaise held up his hands in defense as Draco shot him a scathing look, “if you return tonight or tomorrow, or whenever, Draco – calm down, all you have to do is say Zabini manor and you’ll return to this room here. You can call for any of the house elves and they’ll come find me or take you to wherever I am,” a surge of adrenaline coursed through him as if he was preparing for a Quidditch match and he let out a breath nodding that he understood.
wrapping around Harry’s wrist and slithering up his arm the snake flicked out his tongue in means of comfort.
It was dark and raining and glancing around Harry could barely make out the signs of the shops that were nearby but as he looked up to the creaking above him, he could see the words Borgin and Burkes illuminated as a flash of lightening lit the ominous sky.
“Would you be surprised if I were to say this wasn’t my first time here?” snickering at the boy’s suspicious glance the conversation stopped as the entrance opened and a wave house mates entered.
A storm was raging, and Harry didn’t have to look out a window to confirm how bad it was; rain was hammering against the roof like knives and the flashes of lightening were one after the next followed immediately by a roaring sound of thunder.
“I left after he said that, after I told him that nothing will come between us,” Harry eased up and they spent the next few hours wandering the gardens.
“Would you like to go on a date next weekend?” the butterflies returned, and Harry wondered if they would ever go away around the blonde.
“Have you talked to your parents?” he watched Draco’s reaction carefully and noticed a slight tightening of his mouth yet aside from that the teen seemed unperterbed.
“Much better,” his voice came out hoarse and Draco was quick to summon him a glass of water, rubbing his back gently and ushering him to drink slowly. Harry didn’t have the heart to fight the coddling, in a way, it was nice to be fussed over.
“It was fine, we corrected some of the issues that were caught in the last match and we should be ready for the match before winter break,” Harry nodded as if on autopilot.
Harry spent the next hour just staring at the quill willing it to levitate. Annoyed Harry rocked back on the legs of the chair, he tried to recall how he had felt when it had happened earlier, he had felt happy in Charms, having recalled a pleasant memory and earlier he had been angry at Ron.
Harry wanted to get frustrated with the man, he had been emotional, that’s probably what had triggered it, yet taking a deep breath he vaguely recalled feeling himself channel his magic.
It was an enraged trill that shot through the blonde that had Harry looking at his mate with panic. He found himself held in the Veela’s arms as the noise sounded from the blonde once more.
She let out a tinkering laugh and sipped on her own tea the smile on her face still evident behind the rim of the cup.
Heart feeling light Harry concentrated on the bond between him and his mate and focused on the blonde. The bond still felt numb, but he could feel that Draco was there.
He’d be joking around with Seamus, Ron, Neville, and Dean in their room in the tower right now. All unpacking forgotten they would have stayed up late reminiscing about the summer holidays, Seamus would have been flailing dramatically about his latest romantic conquest and Ron would have been eating the leftovers he snagged from dinner. Dean would have fallen asleep first while Neville would have been the only one to open his trunk.
It was a few moments later that Draco eased as well, Harry caught a glimpse that his eyes were his normal stunning silver.
“What are you supposed to be Parkinson, Dracula’s whore?” Harry shot back and the brunet’s face flushed as she clutched the lace on her dress having attempted at embodying the Queen of the Underworld, elegant and regal, and failing miserably.
He snagged an apple from the kitchen and bit into it with a moan as the crisp, tangy flavor hit his tongue. Having not ate anything since the previous day he was taking a risk with an apple, but he’d flirt with death so many times before, once more wouldn’t kill him.
“Pity you didn’t bother to check the archives,” came a snooty comment and Harry shot the man a glare and as he went to push open the tomb closest to him and quick smack to the back of his head had him glaring.
Harry knew that he was as surprised as anyone else and looking towards McGonagall she seemed equally as stunned.
Draco’s eyes slowly turned back, and Harry watched as familiar silver eyes stared down at him, and confusion was plastered on both Prefect’s faces.
It was a nursery lined with pink walls and cute animal print, with a crib off to one side and various toys lining the other, there was a rocking chair and a dresser with a drawer halfway opened. For a moment Harry imagined himself in his own nursery with both his parents playing on the floor with him, rolling around, and for that moment, it took his breath away.
The loneliness was quick to be replaced by anger as a few other kids made their way towards him tossing stones close to his feet. One struck Tom’s thigh and the boy visibly winced. It was the first time Harry had felt pity for his enemy; being bullied was a terrible thing.
The next morning Harry found himself at the entrance of the Great Hall waiting for Luna and Neville to arrive. Draco and Blaise had already headed towards the Prefect meeting not before making Harry promise that he wouldn’t go anywhere by himself. Harry had pushed the two off swearing that his friends would be there soon, he watched with fondness as Draco kept him in his line of sight until he rounded the corner.
Harry stood up and followed him down towards the dungeons with the five new Slytherin first years. The remaining Slytherin’s were watching them, and for a brief second Harry caught Malfoy’s eye, he didn’t react but continued to talk to his house mates.
He glossed over his discussion with Helga Hufflepuff and the information that the Hufflepuff founder had revealed, he needed to talk to Salazar first.
“C’mon Potter, you can’t think you’d wear that tonight,” Harry groaned as Blaise cackled behind him and he begrudgingly followed his mate towards his room.
“Helga Hufflepuff?” he asked even though he knew who it was, she let out a tinkering laugh and nodded.
“I’m not your mate, Malfoy, you’ve got that wrong,” though as Malfoy responded with silence, a blank look on his face, Harry felt his stomach churn.
Mister Malfoy is a dream for lost heir’s of a family line. A spell was cast on this family to ensure that the lineage would never disappear. Once an heir turns sixteen the magic is enabled to lead that individual back into the family fold, to accept what it means to be the heir,” Draco nodded his understanding but bit his lip.
The piece of sphere and the cup had merged into one and as the cup settled back on the table it glowed once more before dimming. Harry realized then that he was witnessing a Horcrux being created, he knew it didn’t make sense that Tom had figured it out and done it to himself, it was Dumbledore who had created the Horcruxes from Tom’s soul.
“No, this is just how the Zabini manor has always been. Though, each manor may have something different when accepting a new person,” he said with a shrug.
“Houses don’t make you evil, who you are makes you good or bad, I know of people in every house who aren’t as good as they seem,” the words had flowed out of his mouth with an ease he hadn’t expected; which must have struck a chord because the first years were looking at him with a mixture of surprise and awe. Harry caught a brief glimpse of Zabini’s astonished look before his fellow sixth year quickly masked it.
Peeking out the front door Harry was relieved that the neighborhood was quiet, most neighbors were very ritualistic and came home right around dinner time so Harry knew that not many people would see him leave.
Slowly Tom extended his own hand, and as their hands clasped in a handshake the magic in the room swirled around them, the locket had left Tom’s possession and hovered in front of him. Harry could feel Tom’s magic from their grasp and as the locket glowed green Harry felt the same pull in the cave when he had freed the locket from the basin.
The three headed in silence to the room that they had set up to brew the potion. It was in the furthermost part of the dungeon and just before they made the turn to lead them down the hallway there was a noise from behind them; spinning, the group looked up at their Potions Professor who, with an eyebrow raised, seemed suspicious about their behavior.
“My Lord, my Lord –“ Bellatrix gasped as she caught sight of him, immediately her wand was out and a deranged gleam appeared in her eye.
“Father, I would appreciate if you wouldn’t point your wand at my mate,” the Malfoy heir said coolly, and Mister Malfoy snarled.
Neville and Luna were waiting for him at the end of the street and from the matching rosy cheeks he could only wonder if it was the cold weather or something else that had each of them flushed. Neville tossed an arm of his shoulder and beamed down at him.
“The potion confirmed that I’m Riddle’s heir, but didn’t explain how I am, we’ve scoured every book in the library that talks about being an heir and nothing explains how it’s possible,” Harry spoke, feeling the all too familiar wave of defeat wash over him.
“I told Anderson that I wanted to try to go to the Halloween feast and when we were walking down the hall a bunch of red lights started shooting at us!” her body shook and Harry tightened his grasp around her, red light sounded like stunners, “Anderson told me to run and when I looked back he was on the ground, he wasn’t moving Harry,” the tears came thick and fast and Harry’s blood boiled.
“It’s one of the most detailed potions that can be made, the instructions are written out almost to the hour at some parts,” Harry’s confidence deflated, he was no where near the level of potioneer that was needed to complete the potion, if he was lucky and started it this week he might have it completed once break ended.
Hurrying down to the Dark Arts section Harry took a split second to take note that there were thick layers of dust covering the book. Finding
“Well, at least you thought enough to go to Severus and get help, I’ll be sure to thank him,” he said and picked up his robe tossing Harry’s Christmas gift towards him.
Grateful that Blaise hadn’t followed him Harry arrived at his room with minimal interaction with another of his housemates. Pulling down the ward to his room he entered in to find Seviper completely stretched out over the length of his bed.
“The Hospital Wing isn’t just for injuries, it’s traditionally a place where students go if they are missing home, hurting emotionally, or needing the comforts of a familiar place,” she said, and in that moment, Harry knew that hiding away the portraits was only hurting Hogwarts.
For the first two weeks of the school term Harry found himself buried in books more than he ever had during his previous years. Many of the Slytherin’s had gone out of their way to avoid him, except for Zabini, who had sought him out as partner in Divination.
Before Harry could knock the door swung open and Harry tentatively stepped inside. Dumbledore was off to the side standing next a wide dish, decked with jewels and intricate detail carved into the side. There was a shimmering liquid, and as Harry got closer, he swore it looked like molten metal.
groaning in frustration as the Veela’s wand sailed above his head he vaguely heard the clatter of it from behind him.
Sinking into his bed Harry pushed his face into his pillow, the pressure of his glasses pushing against his cheek and nose, but he barely felt it as his heart ached at the thought of losing Hermione over being Draco’s mate.
Bolting upwards it took Harry a moment to remember that he wasn’t in his dorm room in the dungeons and the memories of the previous afternoon came rushing back. Groaning he flopped backwards debating on the ramifications of skipping out on class today. Mentally picturing his schedule, he knew it wasn’t a day he could miss; double Transfiguration, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Slytherin had Transfiguration with the Gryffindor’s and same with Potions. Harry could only imagine it was because both Professor Snape and McGonagall were no nonsense with the drama between houses. Walking up behind the group of Slytherins standing outside the door Harry’s eyes immediately landed on Malfoy who was talking with Zabini and Greengrass. His stomach did a flip and he backed up.
“Artists who paint and charm moving portraits have to rely on their own magical core to bring the portrait to life. It’s why only some portraits talk, and others just move, while some portraits have a vast array of knowledge and others just know of their surroundings. When magical portraits are created most knowledge and information that the painted knows can be incased in the portrait with them, though that information is limited up until their death,” Blaise paused at the confused look the three were shooting towards him, “the portrait might know where they wanted to be buried but not necessarily if that was where they were buried,” scratching at his chin Harry drummed his fingers against the windowsill.
