together.
to be with Cedric, he would be? Do you think that Harry would put up with your grumpy ass in the mornings if he didn’t
“I have to go and tell Ron, otherwise he might try to beat you up when he sees you with Malfoy in the halls,” Hermione teased.
“Are you going to make him carry you inside, as well?” Hermione questioned with a sly smile. With a sarcastic laugh, Draco huddled into Harry’s side and walked through the door to Suzanne’s Sushi. The rest of them followed. Inside, it looked almost like a coffee house crossed with a restaurant, it had the same cozy air. It was a surprisingly nice place. The walls were painted in color blocks of black, white, orange, and green. There were tables scattered around, little flower vases filled with purple blossoms placed in the center of each. The place was buzzing with the noise of people, not exactly busy but enough to keep the staff occupied.
Draco smiled and replied, “Yeah, of course.” He unraveled his arms from around the other boy and walked through the door with a last look over his shoulder at his boyfriend.
“Yeah, okay,” Hermione whispered. Harry kissed her forehead again before gingerly shifting her off of him and onto the couch as he stood up. “I’ll be right back, okay? I promise,” he stated in a firm but soft voice. She only nodded and squeezed his hand before he left for the kitchens.
In the end, logic won out. “Come on,” Harry said gently, sitting back up with Draco reluctantly following, “we need to get you packed.”
He felt more than heard Harry’s laughter. “Someone’s a little drunk.”
Harry burrowed further into his boyfriend’s soft, worn shirt, curling his arms closer around him. “I told Hermione when we were twelve. I’d had a panic attack and she found me in the closet I’d hidden in. I told her everything. I don’t think she left my side that entire week.” Harry paused, fisting his hand in the smaller boy’s shirt. “Ron’s never known. None of the Weasley’s do.”
Hermione snickered into her hand from Harry’s other side. “Well, Harry, someone thinks you’re quite a sight for sore eyes.” Blaise, Theo, and Pansy joined in her laughter while Harry just shook his head with a fond smile and wrapped his arm around Draco’s shoulders.
The shorter boy screeched in outrage, shoving his boyfriend off him.
Harry gave him a sideways glance, the corners of his mouth lifting in a smirk. “I suppose you may,” he teased. Draco only rolled his eyes in response. He looked out the window and thought for a moment.
Pausing, Harry whispered, “Thank you. For trusting me, for calling me, and for telling me.” He opened his eyes to see Draco already looking at him with red-tinted, puffy, miserable eyes. He tried to convey what he couldn’t put into words through that gaze. “What your father did, what he said to you, all of it was
Draco swung their hands between them. “Do you want to talk about why you’re needing to hit things?” His voice was casual but Harry could hear the concern behind them. He supposed now was as good a time as any to start telling Draco about where he came from. And—for better or worse—Harry trusted Draco. And he wanted to trust him with the things he kept closest to his heart.
“I don’t
When Harry’s fingers dipped beneath the waistband of Draco’s jeans, he let out an embarrassingly loud moan, prompting Harry to kiss him harder, like he was trying to swallow the sounds and memorize every millimeter of his mouth, inside and out. He nipped Draco’s bottom lip with his teeth, then licked over the bite like he was soothing an imaginary pain. Draco could feel pleasure dripping down every nerve in his body, he was drowning in sensation, he was on fire, a fire that Harry had breathed to life.
He saw the near madness burning in his gaze, reflected in the way he almost fouled on Nicole—roughly but efficiently stealing the ball back with a complex maneuver Harry had only shown him once. It was messy and needed work, but he had the ball back.
“What do you mean?” Harry turned to her. “Why not?”
He was still a bastard, though.
Draco tried to swallow again in the face of Harry’s small, soft, understanding smile. Now, he felt as though he’d been overly worried for nothing. What had he expected? For Harry to get upset? Or angry? For him to say horrible things and make Draco feel ashamed and embarrassed for asking?
“Are you joking?” Harry laughed. “Of course I’m scared! I’m terrified, Theo!” With large eyes, the other boy looked up at him. The captain allowed himself the smallest of moments to feel the panic he kept at bay. He only allowed it to touch him before he locked it away again, working to convert it into stamina for the game. “But we’re all going to walk out on that field together—and win or lose—we’re going to kick Ilvermorny’s
Harry could almost hear the gears turning in her head, warring between her logical self and her emotionally wrecked self.
Draco hummed in response and kissed him again, this time short and sweet and hard before he sat up, straddling Harry’s waist. “It’s always a pleasure to see me, darling. I mean,
” A disbelieving laugh rushed from his mouth. Draco had been trying for about a week or so to find a pet name that suited Harry, but so far none of his attempts had been successful. He’d tried sugar, sweetums, sugar plum, loverboy, and so many others that had only made Harry laugh.
“You seem more like a human being.”
“I know.”
His godfather nearly squeezed the breath out of Harry with how tightly he held him before reluctantly letting go. Sirius’ quicksilver eyes lingered on Harry for a moment but quickly turned to look at Draco, who Harry knew had been standing slightly behind him with an awkward air surrounding him.
Discomfort passed over Draco’s face, but it was gone so quickly that Harry
But that had been before Harry met his godfather, Sirius. The man had been falsely accused and convicted of Peter Pettigrew’s murder and imprisoned for twelve years, depriving him of the chance to raise Harry as James and Lily had wanted. Pettigrew was found when Harry was thirteen, and his godfather had been released. Their first meeting had been full of tears and slightly awkward hugs and promises that Sirius would find a way to get Harry away from his aunt and uncle and into his custody—if that was what Harry wanted. Six months later, Harry had moved into Number 12 Grimmauld Place with Sirius. Almost immediately he’d started asking for stories about his parents, and he knew for certain that the horrible things Snape and his relatives said about his father weren’t true.
He was leaning against the wall, looking at his nails when Harry saw him.
“I want an apology. Then I’ll think about it.”
“Mama said to come bug you.”
And that's it until next week! I would love getting some feedback for this chapter, I'm a little on the fence about how I wrote it. Comments and kudos are always appreciated!
Draco followed him through the giant doors, sunshine spilling over both of them. It was getting warmer now that spring had a firm grip on the weather. The evening daylight was Harry’s favorite—just warm enough to bask in it without being too hot.
(See the end of the chapter for
The most Harry could manage was a pointed glare in Lavender’s direction. Ron saw this and huffed out an exasperated breath. He snagged a jacket from the floor  beside his bed before grabbing Lavender’s hand and leading her out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
“I’m alright,” Harry replied shortly.
When Harry arrived at the door to Draco’s common room, it was Pansy who answered, in her pajamas with her hair in pigtails. Harry nearly laughed at the image, but he knew that she would probably break his kneecaps. She simply pointed him to Draco’s dorm as if to say,
“Don’t you worry, Draco,” Fred interrupted, George beside him. Both were drenched in sweat but were practically glowing. “You can kiss your atrocious boyfriend all you like at the party in our common room tonight.”
Without hesitation, Harry set off towards the stairs, Draco trailing after him. Weaving their way through the throng of students, they made for the stairs. Draco could see Harry’s eyes roving over each and every face, looking for his best friend. But they didn’t catch a glimpse of Hermione until they reached the stairs.
He knew what he needed, more than anything else.
” he shrieked. The boy rushed forward as quickly as his legs would take him, the biggest smile Harry had ever seen on his face. With glee running through his veins, Harry scooped up the toddler, whirling him through the air and thoroughly enjoying the squealing laughter that burst from him. The extensive amount of energy Teddy had in his small body never failed to astound Harry.
“Harry,” Draco said, swallowing past the lump in his throat and meeting Harry’s gaze, “please tell me we’re not actually going in there.”
Harry’s eyes shot open as soon as Draco touched the mattress.
“Draco,” Harry pleaded, “he’s my ex. Nothing is going on, I promise. Just—meet me after classes today. I don’t care where, but let me explain. Please?”
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Harry’s fists clenched. His breathing stuttered.
N-no!” He gaped at her, trying to process that he was having
The sound of the door banging open didn’t reach Draco’s ears—he was too busy being utterly consumed by Harry. His mouth, his hands, his body, his tongue, teeth, warmth, and breath. Heat poured down every inch of Draco’s body. He couldn’t decide where to put his hands, moving from Harry’s shoulders to his waist, his ass, his hair.
Though he stayed quiet, Harry could practically feel the comforting atmosphere Draco exuded.
The message sent, and no more than a few seconds later, the “read” banner came up beneath it. But Harry wasn’t typing. Draco mentally cursed himself. He cursed himself for his own patheticness, that he seemed so reliant already on a boy he had only just met. He cursed Harry for his stupid power over Draco. For the effect that he seemed to have on him. He cursed Harry all throughout Maths because, by the end of it, Harry still hadn’t messaged him back. And Draco was beginning to think that he wasn’t going to.
A crooked grin spread on Harry’s face. He knew what Draco was trying to say.
“What?” Harry asked, feigning innocence. “You’re the one who kissed me first, you know.”
“There’s a little sushi place downtown that Draco’s been wanting to go to,” Harry answered. Giddiness flooded through Draco. He’d only mentioned the restaurant in passing, but Harry always seemed to remember everything he said. Since he’d heard about the place opening a few months ago, he’d wanted to go there, the sole reason that it was exactly the kind of place his father would never permit him to step foot in. The place was downtown, and Lucius Malfoy was known for never settling for anything less than high-class restaurants and service. And while Draco enjoyed those things, he also hated his father’s attitude towards anything he deemed below him.
the fact that you’re not perfect. I love each and every piece of you, sunshine.”
“Speaking of which,” she said, letting go of Harry so they could climb up the stairway to his dormitory, “what time is he picking you up?”
Draco stopped at the entrance to his
Harry nodded, gave him a small smile, and fell back on his pillows, much to Draco’s amusement. Even as his green eyes fluttered shut, the taller boy whispered, “Stay?”
“Perfect timing,” Pansy snarked. She picked up her story where she had left off, but before she got very far, the common room door burst open.
Harry felt the relief in his bones. Angelina Johnson, his best centerfield, whacked his arm as she walked with him towards the locker rooms. “Any plans for the weekend?” she asked with a tired smile on her face, a sheen of sweat over her face.
Harry reached for Draco’s hands. Those grey eyes dropped.
“Definitely disgusted. I’m sure he’d
Until a screeching, piercing noise cut through the fog.
Harry wouldn’t admit he was nervous. For the most part, he wasn’t. For the most part, he was sure that Draco would love what he had planned. There was just a small part of his brain that was worried Draco would absolutely
uncomfortable—”
chance I’m ever going to
Rolling her eyes and spreading a small smile on her face she scoffed, “Shut up, Potter.”
“They can’t hurt you anymore, my love,” Draco whispered, his lips grazing against the shell of Harry’s ear. “You’re safe, sunshine, you don’t ever have to see them again.”
Suddenly the door swung open to reveal Coach Hooch, her grey hair spikier than ever. Her piercing gaze immediately fell on Harry, then swept over each of the football players in the locker room. She looked at Theo, her face softening for the most minuscule of seconds before she turned to steel again.
“Cinema?”
Joan turned her vibrant smile on Harry, looking him up and down. Harry offered her his hand, and after a second’s hesitation, she shook it.
Harry had been so sweet throughout; he’d carried all of Draco’s things, smelled everything he’d been told to smell, sampled every lotion he’d been told to sample, and Draco had felt strangely comfortable ordering him about. He hadn’t felt judged, or self-conscious. He’d felt… safe.
Draco shifted closer to the door, which creaked when he accidentally touched it. He didn’t dare to breathe, the silence that fell over the two in the hall was deafening in its intensity.
“What’s up?” he asked when he reached Alicia.
After a minute of scanning the two of them, Sirius’ grin wavered and his eyes flicked between Harry and Draco, a worried gleam in their grey depths. “Is everything alright?”
“Not even a little bit.” Draco held up his hand when Pansy’s eyes got that familiar questioning glimmer. “I don’t have any of the information you’re probably about to ask for, Harry didn’t have time to explain anything to me before the bell rang.”
Draco braced himself before asking quietly, “What happened to your parents?”
“Something’s wrong with him, and Hermione sent me to come get Draco,” Ron replied, looking more urgent and panicked by the second.
“Harry’s just going to bring these up to the dorm with me,” Draco said, cutting off his friends before they could say anything stupid.
Draco had never trusted
your place on the team.”
“Pansy said you liked your lotions and such, so I brought you to the best ones. I figured you’d like it,” Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco could feel his arms tense under his hands, “Do you? Like it, I mean.”
like an idiot!
He was ready now.
“I don’t know, I just…” The shattered look in Harry’s eyes made Draco’s lungs stutter. An influx of something sorrowful and relieved and painful surged inside of him. It filled his veins and buried deep in his bones, like needles poking into his skin.
Harry knew that his boyfriend was awake. He didn’t blame Draco for moving away from him sometime in the night, but he couldn’t help the small twinge of hurt he felt. But he understood—at least, he thought he did—and he set it aside as he watched Draco lift his head and set his chin on his knees, his gaze unfocused on the red curtains. The elegant, sharp lines of his face were nearly overshadowed by the bruise-like dark circles under his eyes—lighter than they had been the day before, yet still evident. The blotchiness of his impeccably pale skin made worry crawl up Harry’s spine like chilled fingers.
“I think,” Harry started, trying to swallow past the hurt in his throat, “I think that I need to get to class. I don’t want to be late to first hour.” He stood up from the couch, grabbed his bag, and started walking towards the door. But he paused, looked over his shoulder at Ron, and said, “Come talk to me when you get your head outta your arse.” Hermione stood up again and follow him out the door.
“I hope I do, too.”
“You came back,” he muttered. Laying down, facing his boyfriend, Draco kissed Harry’s forehead and snuggled into him.
“It’s okay,” Draco murmured back, tugging ever so slightly on Harry’s hair. “I have more than enough brains for both of us.”
Slowly but surely, Harry watched as Draco’s resolve strengthened—as if realizing he truly had a choice made him more resilient in his decision. “I’m okay.” Draco took a step closer, his hand released the fabric of Harry’s t-shirt, his long fingers splayed across his chest. “I’ll be okay, muffin, I promise.”
Not some half-wit bastard with a pretty face.”
“It was a compliment of the highest order, my love. I have no idea how it could be anything else. Everyone knows that the gentlemen are the sexy ones.”
He looked down at Hermione only to see her looking up at him as well, her cheek a little squished against his arm. The sight made him smile with fond memories of when they were younger, and smaller, with fewer inhibitions.
“Okay,” was the only reply he could manage with how overloaded his head had become.
“Who. The
For a while, nothing significant happened—until Theo stole the ball from another Castelobruxo player in a fantastically executed move and passed it to Harry with twenty seconds left on the clock.
Her dark eyes were trained on Draco’s hands as she replied, “His father thinks it’s a waste of time. He got annoyed at how much time Draco was spending with his art. He called him out on it, told him that he wasn’t any good, that it wasn’t going to get him where he needed to go in life.” Pansy paused, looking up at Harry, who was staring at her in shock. “His father loves him, in his own way. Lucius just doesn’t understand him.” A smile spread across her purple-painted lips. “So, thank you. For understanding him. For bringing this part of him back, when he couldn’t do it himself.”
Draco felt lighter, in nearly every way possible.
Harry’s brows drew together.
“How unfortunate, Professor. But whether or not you believe me, that is the explanation I’m giving.”
That didn’t mean he had to be
Harry felt it when Draco drifted to sleep, his chest moving against his own with deep, even breaths. He finally allowed himself to reflect on the events of the night. Whatever Lucius had done, Harry knew there was only so much he could do about it.
Cedric Diggory, who was handsome and undeniably good-looking. Who had looked at Harry with so much admiration and hope in his sparkling gray eyes, who had felt comfortable enough to press his leg into Harry’s and reach for his hand. Who had practically undressed Harry with his eyes; it was like he knew what lay underneath. Cedric Diggory, who had looked at Draco like it didn’t matter that he was there, it didn’t matter that he was the one holding Harry’s hand. Cedric Diggory, who had basically proclaimed his love for Harry, who had declared that he missed him, that he wanted him.
He was too tired to feel anything that he was saying. Harry’s mind and body had been too full for too long, he would work through what he felt tomorrow. For now, he just wanted to get it off his chest. He just needed someone else to know.
Harry snickered with him as he sat up and gently maneuvered Draco so they could both stand up. “I have to go talk to Hooch and shower, and I’ll meet you after, my love.” Feeling somewhat unreasonably disappointed and disgruntled, Draco leaned up to kiss Harry again, only for his boyfriend to press a finger to his lips and continue, “I heard a rumor that Fred and George may have planned another party, just in case we won tonight.”
“Sorry, sorry, the alliteration was kind of funny,” Harry laughed. “I just needed to distract him so he wouldn’t go snooping and find you, too,” he paused as if realizing something, “he didn’t find you, did he?”
” Hermione’s hand pressed down on his shoulder, rolling her eyes. “You’re
“I missed you, too,” Draco whispered, his long fingers slowly and soothingly threading through Harry’s unruly, slightly damp hair. “I missed you a lot.”
“What?” he asked.
Harry abandoned the toiletries he’d been packing and walked over to where Draco stood by his bed. He could practically feel the agitation oozing off of the smaller boy as he gently hugged him from behind, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and hunching over to set his chin on his shoulder. The fabric of his pull-over sweater was soft against his hands. He felt Draco freeze, then all the tension seemed to melt from his body. His arms dropped to his sides and his head came back to rest on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry whipped around to look at the Weasley twins, who were both sporting devilish, wicked grins on their freckled faces. “Party?”
But, just as the call was about to end, Draco answered, cursing under his breath. He was greeted by a smiling Harry leaning against the wooden headboard of what must be his bed, with his glasses perched on his nose and what looked like a dog—Snuffles, if he remembered right—laying across his lap.
Memories from the previous night swirled in Draco’s thoughts. He couldn’t stop thinking about what Harry had endured, what he’d been subjected to in place of a childhood. But through the hours of sleeplessness, Draco had come to realize that the scars on his back didn’t only exist as painful memories. They were reminders that he had come through. Harry had survived and he’d found a way to live again. He’d fought for years to be the person he’d become. The boy that he’d fallen completely in love with.
“You don’t… you don’t think it's too soon? Like I might be pushing him into something?” Harry stopped for a moment before continuing, “I don’t want to do that to him, I don’t want to pressure him into being stuck with me, Hermione.”
The possibility of having this—someone like Harry, to love him, hold him—had always seemed impossible to Draco. It had always seemed like a fantasy, something that he saw others have but never experienced for himself. Looking at Harry, he realized that he never wanted to let this go.
All the tension that Harry’s body held seemed to melt away, and Draco felt himself relax in return. He pressed closer to the bigger boy’s side, trying to absorb all the warmth that the very early spring atmosphere denied him.
Harry hadn’t had a chance to see his boyfriend in four days. Coach Hooch had been working the football team overtime to prepare for the game against Beauxbatons Institute. They’d had practice after classes, before classes, and Coach had ordered all teammates to spend lunch working out and going over strategy for the game, in hopes that they wouldn’t lose this time. Harry was drained. What little free time he had was spent doing homework or sleeping. He knew that Hooch would lay off eventually, she couldn’t overwork them or they’d be too beat to play, but he wished she would do it sooner.
“Harry?”
There wasn’t a hint of hesitation in his voice when Harry responded, “I promise.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dray, I think you’re drooling a little bit,” Harry teased with laughter in his voice, pulling an old t-shirt over his head.
Draco could feel his resolve to stay strong withering. (How could a boy with such life inside him be surrounded by so much death? If there was so much darkness in his past, how did he manage to come out of it brighter? Harry was so kind and compassionate, and he was gentle even in his strength. How did a person from such a miserable background become like this?) He felt himself grasping for straws, for an explanation of how Harry could have possibly become who he is.
for this. Can’t you just… I don’t know, get Angelina back? Find someone else—
what does it for you?” Draco’s hand squeezed his own, the other coming up to comb through Harry’s hair. If he thought his lungs would cooperate, Harry might’ve laughed. The most he managed was a pathetic huff, his lips twitching upwards.
Sirius had seen his inner turmoil. He’d gotten Harry a dog as a way to help cope, allowing him to name him—Snuffles, of all things—and take care of him as a way to take care of himself)
Until Madam Pince coughed from a few feet behind them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is there something else you came for?” asked Harry.
Reaching a hand to twine his fingers with Draco’s, Harry tried to find the right words to begin.
As soon as Harry finished, he took deep—nearly gasping—breaths as he set the empty bottle on his bedside table. Scooting closer to him, Draco gently grabbed one of Harry’s hands and pressed it against his chest, right where his heart was. The beat was slow and steady. Turning to look at him, Harry’s green eyes looked calm once again. Exhausted, but calm.
Harry’s father had been Indian, his mother had been white. And Harry looked so much like his father, his skin only a few minuscule shades lighter. If Draco knew that Harry himself was biracial, what horrible things would he say about him, if he could say those things about Hermione? Hermione, who had always been there for Harry, and who was possibly the smartest, kindest person he knew. Hermione, who was always willing to help anyone struggling in class.
And she was. She was completely right.  Harry had done all those things for him and more. Every time without fail, he had given Draco his hoodie—if he had one on him—when he complained of the cold. When Harry had first asked him to wear his football jersey, he’d been so shy about it—so nervous—like he’d been afraid that Draco might say no. Far from rejecting him, Draco had beamed so brightly, he had felt the exhilaration exploding in his chest. He’d worn that jersey with pride every game day since; even if it was big on him—practically falling off his shoulders—Draco wouldn’t have had it any other way. With Harry’s last name and number—thirty-one—emblazoned on the back of it, Draco felt his boyfriend’s presence with him throughout the entire day.
“Dray, really, it’s just a backpack,” Harry tried, trailing after his boyfriend down the corridor, “I can carry it.”
if you’d just
him. The first night Harry had spent at Grimmauld Place, Sirius had held him close and spoken in a soft, soothing, comforting voice when Harry had jolted awake screaming from nightmares—and he had done the same every night after.
“I’ll go and let him know you’re here,” Pansy said, leaving Harry with Theo.
“I was angry, and stupid. I only remember that she had one-upped me in class, and I was so embarrassed and angry, and I just said it to her after class in the hallway. But Harry,” Draco paused, “the moment that they came out of my mouth, I wanted to take them back. I hated the way that word tasted, and I saw the look on her face, and I knew that I never wanted to be like my father.” He hesitated again, his hands moving back to his sides, and his eyes looking down. “I was just too ashamed and prideful to apologize.”
“...but you’re okay. Just breathe with me, alright? You’re safe, I promise, sunshine.”
or what his father did there. He had
“What about me?”
“I think,” Harry started, trying to swallow past the hurt in his throat, “I think that I need to get to class. I don’t want to be late to first hour.” He stood up from the couch, grabbed his bag, and started walking towards the door. But he paused, looked over his shoulder at Ron, and said, “Come talk to me when you get your head outta your arse.” Hermione stood up again and follow him out the door.
He found a tree to sit against and decided that this was where he would do his Maths homework, right where he could concentrate (on Maths, of course), which also happened to still have a decent view of the football field. Draco watched as the team ran their last lap, and Harry ran a hand through his damp hair, screwing it up, as he gave the team orders. Some were playing a mock game against each other, while others started running again. Harry himself joined the mock game, and Draco decided that he could probably watch Harry play football for hours on end. The way that he moved was graceful and almost beautiful, but every movement was also precise and not without purpose.
“Do you
It was
Harry took a deep breath, having only ever admitted what he’d said to himself. He waited for his boyfriend to say something.
“Three months, three weeks, and three days,” Draco said, straightening his shoulders at the giggle that came from her. He’d proudly kept track of every single day he’d gotten the privilege to call Harry his boyfriend. Blaise had eventually stopped teasing him about it. Those were two weeks that Draco would rather not relive.
Where he hadn’t really seemed to be paying attention before, Harry jolted upright. Draco quickly got the message and scrambled off of his boyfriend’s lap. His knees ached from being sat in the same position for so long, but the concerned look on Harry’s face and the uneasy feeling in his chest made him ignore it.
“Hi.” Draco smiled against the nape of Harry’s neck. “Someone’s still as devastatingly handsome as ever, I see.”
I’m always
Draco’s hands came up, palms facing Harry as if trying to calm an animal. “Of course I remember. Harry, please, let me explain.” Draco’s grey eyes were pleading with him, and his pale face was contorted in a mixture of guilt and fear. “Please.”
I’ve only been playing for a few days, and this is just too much—it’s a
“It’s nothing bad, I promise!” Harry laughed, having seen Draco stiffen. “It’s just, Hermione was saying something earlier, and it got me thinking… Do you, um… Would you want to be my boyfriend?”
Draco had pinched the tender part of his bicep—not hard enough to hurt, but enough to let him know that he didn’t like it.
“I need your help getting him to his dorm.” Hermione shifted her body as she spoke, pulling away from Harry’s back, flinching at how his breathing quickened. “It’ll be quieter there, and maybe lighter if we can get enough lanterns.” Both she and Draco moved to either side of Harry, taking his arms and settling them over their shoulders. With some struggle, they managed to help Harry stand. To Draco’s surprise, it felt as though his boyfriend was managing to hold most of his own weight.
This is an important note, dearest readers. I won't be able to update this work for the next two to three weeks. I swear I'm not abandoning this work, believe me I've worked too hard to give up now. I'm in my school's musical, and for the next two weeks we'll be rehearsing nonstop, all hours, zero breaks. So, even if I did write anything in what little time I would have for sleep and homework, it would be complete trash. So please just stick with me, I'll update as soon as I can, but just be forewarned that it won't be for a couple of weeks.
. They meant that Harry intended to stay, to stick around. They meant that Draco was wanted, maybe even
Draco. It was Draco holding him, Draco talking to him. Then Harry heard Hermione’s voice, farther away but still there. It didn’t sound like anyone was talking back to her, though.
“You know, you’re adorable when you blush.”
“I’m gonna kill him if he hurts you,” Theo threatened, squeezing Draco a little tighter for a second. The blond boy rolled his eyes but felt complete knowing that his friends would be there for him.
“Anything.”
Sooo this took me forever to write, it was seriously soo hard. I hope it isn't complete trash, because it's kind of a really important chapter?? And it's the longest one yet?? But yeah, so I hope you all enjoy it!
It seemed to be just the thing he needed to get the words to come out of his mouth.
Harry was in the middle of chemistry class when said boyfriend texted him.
Sooo. This chapter is a week late. And I am deeply, incredibly sorry for that. It's also probably complete trash but like, oh well.
“Yes.” Draco kept his words short and curt. Getting Harry water wasn’t enough to make up for what he’d done. Harry had told him what Ronald had said to him that day that they’d fought. Draco didn’t happen to like it very much. “Is that a problem?”
house again. That house that had become the embodiment of his own personal hell.
One of Harry’s hands came to rest on Draco’s thigh, his thumb running up and down the inside of his leg in a slow, soothing rhythm. Somehow, Draco found the courage to slowly uncurl himself and lift his head to look at Sirius. He was sure that his face was still flushed bright red from his chest to his ears, but he found nothing but kindness and laughter in Sirius’ steely grey eyes. His black, wavy hair hung down to his shoulders, his eyes were wrinkled in the corners with how wide his grin was.
he thought, shifting so he could sit beside her. The smell of vanilla rolled off Narcissa in waves; the smell ignited a million locked away memories, reminding him of the good moments of his childhood.
“It’s not your fault, Harry. I’m just being clingy.”
Draco smirked, recovering from his moment of self-doubt. “What a fancy way to tell me you think I’m pretty.”
Harry’s fingers gently smoothed the conditioner through his hair, combing out any knots. A different sort of ease came over Draco, more peaceful and soothing. Neither of them had said much, but Draco didn’t feel a need to. He just tilted his head back and leaned into his boyfriend’s hands.
Harry flopped onto his four-poster bed in his dorm room. He smiled to himself, which seemed to catch the attention of one of his roommates, Ron.
However, when he heard the heavy sigh through Harry’s nose, Draco knew he wouldn’t be getting the answers he wanted right then.
Pansy you’re
The arm around Draco’s shoulders tensed slightly. He looked up at Harry, only to see him staring at the floor in front of them. It was a strained sort of silence, his fingers were fidgeting in Draco’s hand. The blond didn’t think he would get an answer to this question, but Harry seemed to push through whatever barrier had been holding the words in.
The tears pressing behind Draco’s eyes only made him hold Harry even tighter to his chest.
“Harry, Ron didn’t mean those things he said. He’ll come to his senses, I’ll talk to him. I don’t really understand why he’s being like this, I told him that Malfoy apologized, I told him that I was okay with you and him,” Hermione explained.
It was so ridiculously delicious, it should have been illegal. Of course, Draco had to make sure no one important was near him when he devoured everything in sight, but the tastes made it all worth it.
After he nodded his understanding, Harry watched with blurry vision as his godfather turned to Draco.
Harry watched as the front doors opened. A man with shoulder-length white-blond hair stepped out of the farther driver’s side door, dressed in a lavish black suit and holding a cane in his pale hand. Harry felt a surge of combined nervousness and animosity hit him like a punch to the stomach just looking at Lucius Malfoy.
A pang of longing writhed in the pit of Draco’s stomach. He wanted to
“You know,” Draco said, his voice thick and wobbling, both of his hands coming to tangle in the hair at the nape of Harry’s neck, “deep confessions of love like that aren’t usually meant to be made when your godfather is less than ten feet away and you’re about to leave.”
Draco’s other hand settled on his knee, but it didn’t stay there long; he slid his hand up Harry’s thigh, all while looking him straight in the eyes with a sly smirk on his pink lips.
“You’re right,” Ron whispered. “I’m sorry. I wanted to apologize to you. To make things better. I didn’t want to fight with you.” He slid down the wall to sit on the floor, his forehead against his knees. Nearly against his will, Harry moved to sit beside him, his head against the wall, staring at the ceiling. Waiting. Hoping.
“Bye-bye!” He obediently handed Harry the phone when he asked if a little reluctantly.
He didn’t want to be competing. Not for Harry. He wanted to be the one that Harry chose, over everyone else. Maybe it was a pipe dream or asking too much of his boyfriend, but it was what he wanted. (But he would compete for Harry. He would bulldoze over anyone who got in his way if it meant he could be with Harry. Draco would do everything in his power to make sure that he got to be with Harry)
Just then, the cell pinged again.
Draco had looked everywhere for Harry: the showers, locker room, he had checked with Angelina, he’d even gone so far as to question the Weasley twins. The only places he hadn’t yet looked were in Harry’s common room, and his dorm room. He had tried waiting outside the locker room door for him, but Harry hadn’t shown. Draco was feeling slightly put out by this, but he tried to sympathize. He knew how hard Harry had worked to win this game, how important it was to him that he won.
Draco’s hands curled into fists as he stepped into Ron’s way, effectively stopping the other boy. Ron opened his mouth, a malicious glint in his eyes; Draco lifted a hand to stop him again.
There was a long moment where the only sound seemed to be shuffling sheets and Harry’s repressed laughter. Then Harry’s phone was on the move until Teddy’s too-close face came into focus with Harry behind him. The toddler looked slightly older than he did in the pictures and his turquoise hair was fading into its natural mousy brown. His sweet face and sparkling eyes made him all the cuter.
What do I do now? There was no way that Draco was willing to leave his place tangled within the boy’s warmth, but he worried that he might have been making those green eyes uncomfortable. But wouldn’t he have just pushed Draco off if he didn’t like it at least a little?
“I promise.” Harry punctuated his words with the last kiss to his boyfriend’s forehead. “There’s nothing else I would rather do, my love.”
In fact, his distress over the situation is what made him walk into the boys’ locker room, hoping that Harry would be the last one left. The locker room was fogged with clouds of steam, his nose was immediately assaulted by all the different cologne, body spray, and deodorant scents lingering from their users. At this point, it wasn’t so much a specific scent as an unidentifiable smell.
Once Pansy retreated into Theo’s side, Harry said a quick farewell to Blaise and hugged Hermione—he knew that she wouldn’t need or want an elaborate or theatrical goodbye.
Draco answered in Harry’s stead, sarcasm lacing his voice, “Well, Pansy, I suppose you’ll just have to sit on someone’s lap.” Pansy glared at Draco and planted her hands on her hips, letting out a miffed huff.
“No!” Draco sputtered, “No, of course not, Pansy!” His face felt hot again. Why was he blushing so much recently? What was it about Harry that made Draco’s blood go hot and rush to his face in the most embarrassing moments? Draco immediately set his phone down, hoping that the conversation would end there.
Distantly, Harry heard Draco’s footsteps against the tile as he strode out of the bathroom. Emotions warred within Harry at the thought of Draco leaving him—fear, sorrow, sympathy—but he didn’t have long to worry about it. Coughing, Harry finally managed to stop vomiting just as he heard Draco walk back in.
“Alright, look,” came Fred’s voice over the music from behind Draco, his words slightly slurred. Startled, Draco pulled away and glared over his shoulder at the Weasley boy. “I know what I said earlier, but there are good people here who would rather not see your tongue down Harry’s throat, Draco.”
“Oh, come on, they can’t be
Nothing you could have done would have changed who he is, and
And just to his luck, Harry turned around and jumped, having seen Draco. “Holy- What the hell, Draco?” Draco’s anger came rushing back through him, almost completely forgetting about the scars and the fact that Harry was shirtless. He tried not to notice how Harry was even more gorgeous from the front.
Finally, with a beaming smile, Draco pulled Harry down by the back of his neck into a slow, melting kiss. It was all soft lips and warmth. It was slow, tender movements that stoked the burning embers in Harry’s chest. It was Harry pulling Draco closer until their bodies were flush against each other. It was Draco threading his fingers through Harry’s hair, and it was Harry tilting his boyfriend’s head back to kiss him deeper, more thoroughly. It was tongues slowly, intimately brushing against each other like they had all the time in the world.
Harry snickered and reached across the console to hold Draco’s hand. Draco’s heart stuttered. He could feel the heat rushing to his face, he ducked his head in an attempt to hide both the blush and the smile that crept across his face.
Hermione turned back around. “What?”
“So what? You’re just choosing him over your best friend?”
The moment he’d walked in, Pansy had seen the pink in his face and demanded details. Blaise, of course, went right along with her.
Harry laughed, loudly and boisterously. Oh, how he loved seeing this side of Hermione, every time she came out to play, it always left him entertained and impressed for days afterward. The last time she had come out was when Ron had been dating Lavender Brown. Ron hadn’t talked to Harry or Hermione throughout their whole relationship. But oh, the moment that it was over, Hermione had practically tortured Ron for weeks with the stupid things he had done in the name of what he thought was love.
On the way to the stairs, Draco saw Hermione—fresh-faced and glowing as usual—laughing with Blaise. A smile spread across his lips and he tucked himself into Harry’s side, trying his best not to trip over his own feet. He could practically feel Harry’s warm sheets under his fingers already.
Pansy’s eyes dropped down to her plate. Beside her, Theo squeezed her shoulder fondly before returning to his breakfast, chatting idly with Blaise across from him. Her moment of solemnity didn’t last long, however.
“But—”
“Honestly?” Harry sighed, “I didn’t. Not for what felt like forever. I had a pretty bad breakdown. It was hard to just make myself get out of bed for the first few days. I had to have either Hermione or Ron with me pretty much at all times, to make sure I didn’t do something desperately stupid—like go and beg Cedric to take me back or some shit.” There was a huff of a laugh from Hermione on Harry’s other side. The corner of Harry’s mouth twitched upward in a reminiscent smile. “After that, I was pretty angry. At Cedric. At Cho. The universe or some shit like that. But mostly, I was just mad at
Besides, he was only going to be gone for a few days.
She shook her head. Draco was about to say something, demand that she tell him what she meant when Harry stirred and pulled Hermione impossibly closer to himself. Both of them snapped their heads toward him, but he remained asleep.
Draco laughed as Harry scooped him up and kissed him, smiling against his lips. He wrapped his arms around the bigger boy’s shoulders, holding on tightly when Harry spun him around in a circle. Harry pulled away, beaming at him with so much excitement in his green eyes.
“I’m going to pretend that was a compliment.”
Harry hesitated. Draco could see it in the way his shoulders stiffened slightly, the way he clenched Draco’s hand just a little bit tighter.
“Draco, I need to call Sirius,” Hermione said, crouching in front of Harry, “I need you to hold him tightly from behind, just like how I was.”
I can, okay?”
Makes you sound like a right proper gentleman from the eighteen-hundreds or something.”
“Yeah.”
“I need to talk to you.”
Draco snuggled in closer to Harry, laying his head on his shoulder and against his neck. He could already feel the contentment spreading in his chest, the warmth seeping through his skin, sleep pressing heavy on his eyelids.
“Draco!” She exclaimed, rushing forward and pulling Draco into a quick hug. “I haven’t seen you walk through those doors in far too long!”
Hermione had looked excited, up until he said his name. Her eyes went wide, her brow furrowed, and her mouth opened slightly. She looked down at her hands, which were clenched together so tightly that it seemed she was about to break her own fingers.
A comfortable silence fell between them. Draco moved his head so his ear was against Harry’s chest like he was listening to his heartbeat. Harry drew lines between the sparse freckles on his boyfriend’s shoulders and back, his other hand still in his blond hair. Harry knew that they should be getting to Draco’s dormitory so he could pack, but… he didn’t want to let him go. He’d planned on spending every spare moment with Draco before he left, but now those moments were cut short.
The only reply Harry gave was an affirmative hum. He was far too busy simply taking in the entity that was the boy before him—Draco’s bright eyes, his elegantly sharp cheekbones, his lean frame, his jaw that was so defined he could cut himself on it. His taut stomach and navel. The distinct lines of his hips revealed by his low-rise jeans.
Harry waited a moment for a reply to come, but when nothing appeared, he sighed in resignation, stashed his phone in his locker before grabbing his towel and turning on the shower water.
Harry ran a hand through Draco’s hair, a thrill of pleasure running down his spine. The smaller boy was trying to comprehend what he’d just heard, what he’d just been told.
“I kept a few,” Harry admitted, “the ones I liked the most, I may have… slightly stolen them.” He felt no regret for taking them—he knew that most of the others had been kept in Draco’s sketchbooks. The same sketchbooks that were now nothing more than ashes in a fireplace.
“We’re going to the championships!”
So, it turns out I actually am alive. My dearest readers, I'm sorry it took me this long to write this chapter, but I made it *extra* long for y'all, even if it still feels like it's trash. I think this might actually be the longest chapter yet, but I'm too lazy to go and check the word count for all my other ones. Anyway, I hope that you all enjoy this!
Hermione sighed. At long last, they reached the Great Hall, and the first person they both saw sitting at their table was a certain Ronald Weasley, who had his arms around Lavender Brown’s waist, and his tongue down her throat. Lavender’s hands were raking through his red hair in an almost animalistic manner.
“The old man’s right.” Sirius smirked as Remus shoved him, just hard enough to nearly knock him over. “Tonks only lent Remus to me for the afternoon so she could go get her hair dyed and let the kids have a day at Andromeda’s. And Draco looks like he could use some sleep.”
Hearing the window roll down, Draco made himself as small as possible, hiding his face from Harry’s godfather.
“I think I do, Harry.”
In the low light, Draco whispered back, “I love you, too. Even if you are a complete animal.”
Blaise only shook his head in disbelief and leaned forward to get a poke in for himself. Harry’s smile was crooked when he looked at an aghast Blaise, who continued to nudge at him like he was making sure it was real. “
“Finally,” he grunted, pushing past Harry and flopping onto one of the other three beds.
“He said he was sorry.”
Draco stayed quiet for a moment.
Harry knew full well that Draco had seen the expanse of scars on his back. He knew that his boyfriend had questions about where they came from, how he’d gotten them. Why he hadn’t explained them sooner. It had been slowly eating at him, keeping what was probably the biggest part of his past from the boy he loved. But he just hadn’t been ready.
Harry opened the door to the common room as quietly as possible. When he looked inside, a weight was lifted off his shoulders. Draco was sitting on the couch next to Hermione, Pansy on her other side, while Blaise and Theo sat by her feet. From what he could hear, Hermione was giving an animated retelling of how she had met Harry.
That he would take you out to lunch when you can’t handle the noise in the Great Hall? Do you think that Harry would give you his football jersey to wear on game days, or his hoodies when you’re cold, if he didn’t want to be with you? For heaven’s sake, Draco,
in boredom, suffering for your sake, surrounded by vile smells and horrible-”
“Thank you,” he mumbled, just before sleep pulled him under.
Draco looked at her with resentful fondness before he whispered, “I saw Harry at lunch today. He seemed…
one, too.”
“Draco, sweetie, we both know you did,” Pansy chuckled.
This was the most nervous that Draco had seen Harry since he’d met him, and the thought of that gave him somewhat of a confidence boost. Without a word, he took his cell out of his pocket and handed it to Harry with a new contact form open. Harry looked at Draco and smiled at him, that same small twist to his lips that melted Draco’s confidence as if it were snow in the springtime sun. His face felt hot, and the slight brush of Harry’s fingers against his when he took the phone made his chest feel as though it would burst open.
When Harry pulled away, Draco reached up and kissed the corner of his mouth.
The only reply Draco gave was a nod before leaning forward and pressing his lips to Harry’s. The kiss was slow and careful; Harry was afraid that if he pushed too hard, Draco might shatter in his hands. He felt one of Draco’s icy hands delve into his loose tank top, splaying over his broad shoulder. Harry could taste the salt of their tears on Draco’s lips. The tender, soft glide of Draco’s mouth against his own made goosebumps rise on his skin and cool affection and fondness pool in the pit of his stomach.
looking particularly gorgeous.
paying for all of this, Harry!”
The way Draco whispered to him didn’t sound angry—rather it sounded like he was reaffirming it for Harry. It was gentle and knowing, and it only made Harry’s heart grow fonder of the boy in front of him. Understanding energy seemed to flow out of him, curling around Harry and whispering sweet nothings in his ear. Even though it wouldn’t even be a total of three whole days, he knew that he’d miss simply being in his boyfriend’s presence.
The buzzing persisted, drawing Harry’s attention away. It felt like a phone, and Harry was certain it was coming from the pocket of Draco’s borrowed sweatpants. The drawstring on said pants was pulled almost all the way out and tied tightly to keep them up on Draco’s smaller hips. The sight made Harry smile. Draco had a tendency to steal his clothes and Harry had no qualms about it when he looked so adorable in them, practically drowning in the swell of fabrics that were much too big for his smaller frame.
Watching Harry run and play was just as satisfying and attractive as it had always been—possibly more so now that the stakes were so high. The way his body moved was both fluid and controlled at the same time, well-practiced and personalized to play on Harry’s strengths. Draco could see his muscles moving under his skin all the way from the stands, could see the sweat dripping down his face and soaking through his clothes.
The exhaustion that weighed on him wasn’t just physical. Everything inside of him—his mind, his emotions, whatever it was—felt completely drained. Nearly numb. These attacks were nothing new to Harry, but he knew that this one had lasted longer than most of the others. This one had hit differently. His eyes fluttered closed, his breaths finally in time with Draco’s.
Harry had no idea how a person could sleep this long on a flight. (Not that he was complaining) There were only thirty minutes left before they arrived in London, and he had no idea what he would do when they landed. Would he just give the blond boy a nod and he on his way? No, there was no way that he was leaving the airport without the boy’s number. Luckily, just at that moment, the boy moved, and he seemed to be awake. Oh, this was about to get good. The ancient crone in the window seat had also fallen asleep, and Harry was beyond grateful for that.
disappoint you?”
“I happen to know that you
Draco stopped in his tracks, staring at Harry’s receding back.
“No one hates you, my love. It’s not your fault that you didn’t win, no one blames you. The team may have lost the game, but you all did
Cedric Diggory was beaming at him, a smile that seemed too bright. (That smile used to have him coming apart at the seams, always extracting a matching grin from him. His smooth voice used to have Harry falling on his knees. Those grey eyes had once looked at him with such love and adoration, his tanned fingers had traced the lines in Harry’s skin, known every inch of his body. Harry used to adore his dark, bronze-colored hair, his chiseled face, and his gentle laugh. There were a great many things Harry used to love about Cedric Diggory. But looking at him now, everything was so much different. Looking at him now, there was nothing Harry needed from him, nothing Harry
“Well?”
“See, Ron, he apologized! I don’t see why you’re so upset. Hermione’s alright with him, so what’s your deal?”
It didn’t work.
So, Draco just kissed the back of Harry’s hand and walked him the rest of the way to the rest of the team, and then left to wait for him outside of the locker rooms.
He chanted in his mind. If possible, he beamed even brighter.
I had worked so hard on, everything I… I couldn’t
“Hey, Harry.”
“...what did it say, Harry? And when?” The tone of Sirius’s voice struggled to remain even, he was obviously rattled.
“Harry, is there something wrong with me?”
Draco handed him another glass he hadn’t seen before after he finished, which he guzzled without stopping. He heard Draco sigh through his nose, but he couldn’t bring himself to take smaller sips as he should have. The water settled his stomach, if only by a fraction.
Blaise hesitated. “I’m getting Pansy.”
Yet, Draco wasn’t ignorant enough to think that Harry’s therapy sessions were anywhere near the same as the ones Draco had been to.
Everything crashed into him all at once as he stared at what he sincerely hoped was the right door. Leaning over with his hands on his knees, Draco’s mind reeled, trying to pull himself together. The only sound he could hear was the pounding of his heart, the blood rushing in his ears. Every thought jumbled in his head until they were completely incoherent.
Then there was a sudden pressure against his back. It wasn’t warm like the last one had been. It was chilled, like being dunked in ice water. Harry felt a piece of himself snap back into place when the new voice began whispering to him.
It was dark. It was dark, and Harry didn’t know why. Panic began to set in. His heart started racing, his breathing labored. He could have sworn that two seconds ago, he’d been with Hermione in the common room. They’d been fine, talking quietly in the corner. He’d been working up to telling her what had been pressing on his mind, working up the courage to take down that first stone in the dam that he’d built to hold everything back.
Harry walked Draco all the way to his first class and paused outside the door, pulling Draco closer to him.
At this, Harry’s eyes flicked up to look into Draco’s, though he didn’t stop wiping away the emerald green paint that had found its way onto his boyfriend’s neck. He saw the mild hesitation in their grey depths and answered with his own question. “Is this going to be like your last off-topic question?”
. I can barely even draw a stick figure; these are-”
“Yeah, I guess I just… felt like doing it again.”
The same shoulders that
“Not like this!” Draco’s lips were turned down in a pout, which Harry found both adorable and endearing. “I’m not some stereotypical housewife you can just spoil.”
Blaise’s voice came out rough and deeper than usual, his words laced thickly with a whining tone. Draco heard him shuffling around on the floor on the other side of the curtains, groaning with each movement. Pressing a finger against Harry’s lips to keep him quiet, Draco stopped talking. A hungover Blaise was
“You know,” Draco said while wiping at his face with a wet cloth in the bathroom, “you’re lucky you’re cute, or else I would really, really hate you right now.”
angry before I got to him, and when I asked him what was wrong, he said he couldn’t tell me. But he asked me to meet him in the library after class so we could study together and he would tell me then. He said something about needing to get back to Hermione.”
What he’d learned, the insights he’d gained, the twisting pain and grief he’d felt for Harry—it all made his heart drop to his stomach. It made him feel sick just thinking about it, it made the pressure build behind his eyes until they glistened with held-back tears.
Draco thought. He shoved his hands into his pockets, dropping her gaze. “I just… I don’t like the thought of someone else with Harry. Yeah, sure, I didn’t like that Cedric talked to Harry, I didn’t like that Harry didn’t tell him to screw off.” Draco’s frustration returned, he scraped his hands through his hair. “I don’t know, Pansy! I just… I want to be with Harry and I want Harry to want to be with
“Do you want to come and sit with me at dinner?” Harry asked in a soft voice as if he was reluctant to make too much noise and break the silence. Draco could feel the grin splitting his face as he replied, “I would love that.”
The blush on Draco’s face deepened impossibly, and the satisfied smirk only grew on Harry’s. He loved how his words still affected Draco, still made him flush red and drop his gaze as if he was feeling shy.
The man’s scowl had deepened. His nose had wrinkled. His piercing grey eyes glared up at him, sweeping up and down his body, lingering on any place he found skin. His
For a moment, nothing happened.
“Haha, you’re
“Is that so?” Sirius asked, a new light in his eyes. Remus perked up at his curious tone, setting his phone down and finally tuning in to the conversation. “What mediums do you use?”
“Real focused on food aren’t you?”
“Some members of the Dolohov family have been brewing up a gang of wizards with anti-muggle sentiments.”
When Draco caught Harry glancing at him with a furtive smile for the fourth time he rolled his eyes. “Would you just tell me where we’re going?”
“You told me nearly everything irrelevant too,” Draco contested.
“Any other names on that list stand out to anyone?” she asked.
“Ah, it’s alright, Dud.” Harry brushed off the reminder of how shite the situation was, “Tell me what’s been going on with you over the last year or so.”
He picked up another paper, from late summer that read:
“I really believe there was no way she was involved,” Harry replied solemnly.
“A deal?” Harry had known that his plan was to get a mastery in DADA, but he hadn’t been made aware of any such deal.
Thankfully, neither Draco nor the Harry that was truly present during the incident, did. He couldn’t help but let out a little shout of triumph as a powerful looking patronus flew from Draco to charge at the dementors, followed by Harry’s stag.
“Fourth year, Potter.”
She nodded sympathetically.
of Draco.
A screeching noise cut through the sounds of traffic and Ron said quickly, “Brace yourself, Harry.”
Kreacher, thankfully, acting for once as the well-trained elf serving an ancient pureblood family that he was, skilfully guided Longeman into the sitting room and left him waiting with tea. Though Draco preferred to apparate home, today he opted for the floo so that he could give himself a moment to prepare in the kitchen first. Harry paced the kitchen anxiously until the flames flashed green and, with a whoosh, out strolled Draco. He may not like floo travel, but he was certainly able to manage it with more grace than Harry.
I’m so stupid. He asked if there was anything I’d forgotten to tell him that about that night and I said no. I’ve made myself look so suspicious.”
“Sorry,” Draco pressed his lips together, looking not at all sorry.  “What’s your favourite sweet?”
Dudley chewed dramatically for a moment before swallowing and firing back, “Okay posho. So, Harry?”
“Ah well,” Harry shrugged. Hagrid and Draco seemed to be good mates nowadays. Hermione had told Harry that had been the result of Draco’s apology campaign the previous winter.
“Ron,” Harry asked, frowning, “would you take over the stir fry?”
“Yes, I do,” Malfoy said assertively. “So I’m sorry. For being such a bullying git to you and Hermione and the Weasleys. For breaking your nose. For nearly casting an unforgiveable on you…” His pale features were tight, and it was clear that speaking this all out loud was unpleasant for him.
The two of them carried on without Hagrid, gravel crunching beneath them as they wound up the path to the castle.
“Ah.” Malfoy nodded, finally glancing towards Harry. “Would you want to walk around together, then?”
“None more than any others I guess.” Harry made to move out of bed, “Is that it? I’d like to find a nurse for my next dose of painkillers.”
With a small smile, Draco took another step closer to Harry. “Do you imagine that we’ve always gotten along splendidly?”
“Do you?” Draco replied, amused. He hung his robes on the hook that looked like a unicorn’s horn and bent down to pet Gandalf.
Harry, to the surprise of both of them, burst out laughing. “You’ve got me there,” he acknowledged.
Oscar clacked his beak irritably at her.
“I’m not,” Draco protested petulantly, his stomach growling loudly in disagreement.
“I- “ Harry’s throat caught, “I’m feeling better.”
They started down the hallway towards the kitchen. Harry recognized immediately that that bigoted old banshee Mrs. Black’s portrait had been replaced with a painting of Hogwarts, lights twinkling in a twilight backdrop. “How’d we ever get her off?”
“You know,” Malfoy said as he put the top slice of bread on his plate, “I think I might need to learn how to unhinge my jaw to manage a bite of this monstrosity. This is a sandwich made for dragons.”
“It’s sort of like entering into a film, watching everyone act around you. Only they don’t know you’re there at all.” Harry nibbled on his lip. “I’ve never seen a memory with me in it before. It’ll be a bit odd, I suppose.”
Harry stared into Draco’s left eye (the other was smushed against the pillow and firmly closed). Their legs and arms were tangled around one another and their faces were so close that Draco’s one open eye was squinting. It really was a wonderful shade of grey, though. Like a soft cloud covering on a cozy day, where you could expect a light spring rain.
“Huh,” Harry let his grin loose. “Well, you must be a good listener.”
“Yes. Sorry if I woke you. I just was trying to figure out why I know Clarice Brunetto.”
“She lied to Voldemort just to make sure you were safe.”
He picked his way across the room gracefully, then crouched down on the other side of the newspaper fort Harry had ensconced himself within.
“Brilliant, Teddy!” Harry exclaimed as Andromeda grinned her approval at the toddler.
Letting out a huge gust of breath, Draco nodded, “Okay. Yes, okay. Good.”
Harry thought, panic taking firm hold of him now. He had never felt so disjointed, so disoriented.
in the embrace.
Once in Harry’s old apartment, Harry took a look around and smiled. He had rather liked the place, as much of a shoebox as it was.
“Yeah,” Harry muttered to Niamh.
Harry rolled his eyes, “I’m fine, Molly.”
Nodding, Malfoy raised his brows just slightly, confirming the significance of the tattoo for Harry.
The feeling of Malfoy’s breath on his ear made Harry shiver a little, and he shot an elbow into his side. “I’m trying to pay attention,” he hissed.
They were nearing the far end of the park they’d been strolling, and the night was getting dark. Harry pointed towards the glimmer of street lights guiding them forward, “There’s a fish and chips place just across the road there, isn’t there? We’ll grab some of that, shall we?” Draco nodded and Harry moved onto the next question on his list, “Did you ever have a pet as a kid?”
While the Fellowship of the Ring film didn't come out until 2001, at the time this story takes place filming was underway. I imagine that Harry and Draco would've liked to add a twist to the theme of naming their pets after gay icons by naming their puppy after the wizard played by Sir Ian McKellen :)
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged. “Took a headache potion already.”
“What?” Harry asked. “Didn’t they already get your statement back when this first happened?”
“Uhm alright, I suppose. Bit tired, but getting used to things.”
And while he didn’t know exactly what he’d done to cause those dozens of small, quiet injuries, Harry knew exactly how badly he’d hurt Draco by risking his progress during his memory binge and his safety by sneaking out on the Auror watch, And he knew the quarrelling was wearing on them both.
“Thank you, Kreacher.”
Malfoy pursed his lips, eyes going blank, “No.”
“Were you wearing pajamas last night?” Harry whispered, certain that he hadn’t been.
“Not a problem, sir,” Kreacher reassured.
“It’s not alright!” Draco snapped, eyes flinty. “I
Draco hummed, then  said, “You don’t have to answer this question in return, if you don’t want to, Harry.”
Hermione, looking as nervous as Harry himself felt, shifted her hand to hold his more tightly and a sharp poke drew his attention. A glimmering diamond ring adorned her finger.
Harry was rarely left alone over the next three days. Hermione had taken a leave from work (which was probably more easily given than it would have been if they’d been any other two people). Each day she was there when Harry woke, ready to coax breakfast into him. Ron would drop by during breaks in his training schedule to check in on them.
Hermione’s single, soft, “
It was sort of lonely, to be viewing the memory on his own. It was a fairly light one, though. Harry went to Malfoy’s fancy, sterile flat in Diagon Alley for their second intentional meeting. He laughed to himself as he watched Harry from the past try to unnerve Malfoy, and put them back on more even footing. He sort of wished he could see the present-day Malfoy’s expression as their past-selves negotiated terms for their project and, as though playing a calculated game, pushed one another’s buttons.
“I did, thank you. I never used to like to talk about it. I’d have to hide it from my father. My mother would owl me supplies without his knowledge.”
accompanied physical blunt trauma.
McGonagall whirled around and regarded him sternly. “What do you mean young man?”
Groaning, Draco buried his face into Harry’s shoulder. “We promised we’d meet everyone at the Hog’s Head.”
“What are your leads?” Harry asked, leaning forward from his chair.
They watched as their past-selves headed to their respective locations to prepare. After a few moments, Draco hissed and pulled Harry out of the way of three dementors which came gliding past them and into the alley.
Draco pointedly flagged down Aberforth to put in orders for shepard’s pie and butterbeers, and once everyone had put in their orders, turned to Hermione. “So what’s in that file of yours?”
Every time Harry’s knuckles brushed against his skin, a thrill of pleasure shot through his veins. When the sweatpants had dropped to the floor, Harry hooked two of his fingers in the elastic band of Draco’s briefs, tugging Draco closer to him. Draco couldn’t help the sharp breath he took, the feeling of Harry’s fingers on his sensitized skin nearly overwhelmed him. Pleasure shivered down his spine and goosebumps appeared on his pale skin. He felt dizzy, like the smell of Harry, the feel of him touching his skin, had all gone straight to his head.
“Harry,” she whispered softly, “honey, it’s not your fault. It’s nobody’s fault, I promise you.” Hermione’s heart fractured when she saw a tear trickle from Harry’s closed eyes. His brow was furrowed, his lips were pressed together—like he was trying to keep the thoughts inside his head, attempting to control the screams begging to be released.
At least until Harry kissed over his chest and discovered how sensitive Draco’s nipples were. Then he tossed his head back onto the pillows and his kiss-swollen lips dropped open with a sultry, nearly obscene moan, and he was drowning in the sensations of Harry touching him in all the right ways. And although it was an oddly new sort of feeling—somewhat awkward and uncomfortable at first—he found he quite liked having Harry’s fingers inside him.
Harry opened his eyes again to look at Hermione, who nodded in agreement. He waited a moment, waiting for Draco to complain again about leaving the couch or not being hungry, but his boyfriend seemed to have tuned everyone out in favor of burying his face in Harry’s neck.
Draco snatched the hoodie the moment Blaise gave it to Harry, pulling it over his head. It was a deep navy blue fabric that was soft to the touch. Had he been standing, he was sure the hoodie would have almost completely covered his thighs with how big it was on him—he was able to wrap the ends of the sleeves around his hands and he still had plenty of room. He buried his nose in the fabric, surrounded by the familiar, comforting smell of Harry. The cold left him almost immediately.
Harry nearly snorted with how hard he laughed, and Draco beamed at him, amazed at the fact that
It didn’t go half as well as Harry had imagined. Which wasn’t very well, to begin with.
And waited.
Harry was most definitely
Draco didn’t even try to fight the urge. He collapsed onto his bed with a flushed face and a sigh that he was sure was still in hearing range to hear.
Draco slumped onto the bench beside Harry’s bag, letting his head fall into his hands.
After pulling his phone from his front pants pocket, Hermione crawled across him to lay her head on his stomach. Out of habit, Harry’s other hand went to fiddle with the ends of her curly, dark hair. “He said seven. I can start your packing if you want to sleep for a few hours.”
“It’s raining,” Harry explained. Looking out the window, he saw that it was pouring outside, rain sliding down the windows. A crash of thunder sounded; the lightning couldn’t have been very close to the school. The bigger boy stood up, heaving Draco up with him.
Narcissa chuckled. “Is that so?” She leaned over and poked him in the ribs, whispering in his ear, “Is there something specific that made it so…
would never see me that way. What was I
conversation starter.”
“You’re not stupid, Hermione. You’re not,” Harry assured, his own throat clogging with tears as he picked her up again and sat back down on the couch with her against his chest. Her arms wound around his chest, her head in the crook of his neck. “Maybe…” Harry licked his lips, trying to decide whether to go on. “Maybe having feelings for him was a bad idea, but you’re not stupid, Hermione. It wasn’t exactly a choice you made.”
“You know that after my parents died, I was sent to my aunt and uncle.”
“Harry! This is not the kind of carrying I had in mind!” Draco grumbled from behind Harry’s back.
The juxtaposition of the situation was quite disorienting.
“We could go to lunch, or something?” she suggested, “A movie?”
“You can paint me for as long as you like.” Harry raised their interlaced hands and kissed Draco’s knuckles. The lingering pink color to his ears made him look nearly angelic. “On one condition.”
Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s temple, nuzzling his hair and sliding his hands from Harry’s shoulders to his waist and around to his stomach, tracing random shapes and circles onto his shirt. Harry could feel his boyfriend’s gentle smile against his skin, his delicate fingers leaving cool trails on his skin through his worn shirt. He felt Draco’s heartbeat through his back, his own falling in time to match the rhythm. An almost drowsy feeling filled his head—only it was less like sleepiness and more like he was drunk on relaxation.
Another update?? So soon?? And almost four thousand words?? I mean, I guess so. This chapter just kind of came out, you know? With school out on Thanksgiving break, I actually had time to write. I hope you guys like it!
He could see with perfect clarity the snarl that must have been on Snape’s face as he commanded, “Detention every night this next week, Potter. Starting Monday, six o’clock, in my classroom. Now get back to your common room, immediately.”
Instead, Draco stood from the bed and took a few steps in Ronald’s direction. “I won’t lie and say that I forgive or believe you,” Draco started. “At least not right now. But, in all fairness, I could’ve handled the situation better on my end as well.”
His boyfriend had seemed fine, happy and content after they’d arrived back at school after the cafe fiasco. He’d walked Draco back to his dorm room and kissed him goodnight. Everything had seemed fine. More than fine, really.
“Draco!” Pansy hissed, suddenly appearing at his side, seemingly from thin air. She hooked her arm through Draco’s, steering him in the direction of their common room—where he had already been heading.
“It’s… the doctors have told him that it’s most likely a cross between a panic and anxiety attack, but they’re not really sure,” Hermione explained. Draco recalled Harry mentioning in passing that he’d had panic attacks before, but he hadn’t ever imagined anything like this. “They don’t usually last much longer, but nothing we’ve done before is helping. It’s like he can’t hear me.”
“Can… can I ask you a really off-topic question that’s kind of… somewhat, maybe, awkward?”
“I’ll tell you more about him when we see Hermione at lunch,” was all Harry decided to say.
he thought. His stomach dropped, he felt his heart twist.
“Harry!”
The ball was flying in the next second.
With that, Sirius turned and walked into the shop, the other man he had glanced at following him inside.
not to be a stranger? What was your deal in the hallway?” Draco fired questions like bullets, he could feel his chest constricting with each one, his anger giving way to fear of what Harry might say. Or do.
Ron looked down at the ground. His shoulders slumped. He backed away a few steps, moving to lean his back against the corridor wall.
he snapped at Ronald, who had been a step behind him, nearly bumping into him when Draco stopped.
Pansy looked annoyed. “Harry dearest, how exactly are you going to fit six people in a car that only have five seats?”
Harry kept saying that,
of that red-headed
Which led to more.
“But-!”
Only, they lost the sparkle they had seconds before. In their stead came a steady coldness that spoke volumes, even from across the hallway, where Harry kept walking in the direction that Draco had just come from. His smile slipped and melted off his face, as Harry slightly shook his head, leaned closer to his red-haired friend and whispered something, who then gave him a similar look.
He could easily be bitter. He could easily be hateful and cold and cruel. And yet, he chose to fight to be the person he was—kind and happy and caring and strong and loving and everything that made up
Harry pulled into the parking lot and stopped the car. Pansy immediately opened her door and practically flew out. Draco chuckled as Harry walked around the car to open Draco’s door before he could do it himself.
With a smirk on his face, Harry dropped the shirt in his hands and turned around to look at his boyfriend. His smiling, flushed, grey-eyed boyfriend. His boyfriend that was dressed in a white crop top that Harry had never seen him in before, along with his superbly tight black skinny jeans. The shirt’s hem fell just below Draco’s ribcage, and his pants hugged his legs in all the right places.
“I would venture to believe it was a draft of wind from an open window.”
“Aren’t you always?”
Draco closed his eyes, pressing his lips together. Harry laid his forehead against his, whispering, “That’ll be Seamus.” He sounded almost
memories, tended to be extremely unhelpful.
And there was one moment, in the thick of everything, in which the heat and passion and tension ran high and were nearly unbearable, where Draco met Harry’s eyes, and the cord that connected their hearts pulled taut.
Harry waggled his eyebrows at her suggestively.
“I missed you too, you know,” Harry said, sliding his arms under and over Draco’s body, bringing him close enough so that if Draco shifted his head forward the tiniest bit, their noses would be touching. His hand was rubbing circles into Draco’s back, making him feel drowsy as well. “It was nearly impossible to concentrate on those strategy meetings, you were constantly on my mind.”
Despite the recent developments in Harry’s relationship with Ron, Fred and George seemed relatively as they were before. They didn’t appear to care what their brother thought of Harry; after all, he was still their captain.
Sounds of clinking weights filled the air, accompanied by sharp breaths and grunts of exertion. Some sort of rock music played in the background. Harry tapped his foot to the beat, looking down on Katie as she lifted the barbell away from her chest, the strain prevalent on her face. There weren’t very many weights on the bar—she was better built for speed than muscular strength.
“I,” the red-headed boy swallowed hard, “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m sorry for saying those awful things to you, for just assuming the worst of you.” Ron removed one hand from his pockets to rub at the back of his neck. “Ginny came and told me everything. Almost beat me up for being so stupid. I know you didn’t just… I’m sorry. I was horrible to you.”
That didn’t mean that Draco didn’t want to kick a soccer ball into Ferriera’s head for targeting his boyfriend. Hard.
Once Harry had calmed down and recaptured his breath, he said, “Alright, well, I need to get Ted to Remus and Tonks. It’s almost his bedtime.” He sounded apologetic.
“Netflix. Obviously.”
“I very much do
“Fine,” Draco grumbled, pulling his shirt over his head, then unzipping his jeans, “but you’re going straight to sleep.” When he was down to his briefs, Draco climbed in bed beside Harry, closing the red curtains and pulling the blanket up with him.
So... This chapter gets a little more physical (I'm not really sure if I wrote it well enough or if it's really cringy, but I guess we'll find out) so if you're uncomfortable with that just go ahead and skip to the first asterisk. This chapter is a little bit longer, so I hope you all like it!
But fear… It was a powerful thing. It coursed through Draco’s entire body, holding his legs as if they were stuck in wet cement. He felt himself drowning in it. Fear for Harry, fear for what might have happened. Fear of seeing what lay behind that door.
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” he responded. He hung up first. But instead of going to sleep, he sat down at his desk and turned on his lamp. He took out his sketchbook and started to draw.
Both boys froze in place, slowly lifting their heads to look at the door. Draco could feel his already scarlet face flush with embarrassment when there was a shout from the other side of the door.
“Will you hand me my laptop from the drawer in my nightstand?”
“That’s good, I suppose,” he paused when Theodore Nott came up behind Pansy with a slight scowl on his face, “Is Draco in?”
But it was worth it.
Those green eyes regained a remnant of wakefulness when Draco lightly kissed Harry’s nose, a wide smile on his lips and scarlet staining his ears. “I believe you mentioned something about food earlier?” Draco quipped. Harry laughed airily, tiredly.
The expression on Draco’s face when Harry looked at him was a medley of gratitude and quiet pain—Harry realized that talking about his art must remind him of the night before, of what his father had done.
“I don’t usually sleep very well after nightmares.” Harry looked at him through his lashes. Draco squeezed his hand, feeling his heart squeeze at the same time. His stomach clenched, his brows drew together. “I just… couldn’t sleep.”
Harry caught sight of Draco right before they left the doorway, the same second that those grey eyes caught him. Harry couldn’t even smile at him, or wave at him, his mind was too occupied with the scene he had just witnessed as he walked away. He somehow pressed Hermione closer to his body, ushering her back to their common room, which he was positive would be empty.
He missed the warmth of Harry’s presence. His smile, his laugh. His body. Draco’s mind continually drifted to the feeling of being wrapped up in his boyfriend, being curled together with him and tangled in his sheets; he’d snuck some of Harry’s clothes with him just to get some remnant of that feeling—his football hoodie, a few t-shirts, a pair of sweatpants, all of which were ridiculously big on him—though he had a sneaking suspicion that Harry knew.
Harry plopped down at the dinner table next to his boyfriend. When Draco turned to look at him, he kissed the smaller boy and wrapped his right arm around his waist, sliding him closer so their thighs were touching. Draco did the same, his arm around Harry’s waist.
So, with furrowed brows, Draco asked, “Who’s Teddy?”
I feel a little guilty for that cliff-hanger. But also not really. Comments always make my day, so leave them!!! I love hearing from you guys! <3<3<3
had had the nerve to demand what
He quickly brought Draco back to him. Harry felt him grip the back of his shirt in fists as he cradled Draco’s head against his shoulder, pressing his lips against his hair, wrapping his other arm around his waist. All of Draco’s weight sagged against him like the boy couldn’t find it in himself to support any of it.
After carefully picking their way through the dorm room of sleeping, hungover boys, and the common room in a similar state, and calling Pansy to let her know about Draco’s newfound situation, Harry found himself in Draco’s dorm room, attempting to help fill his luggage bags with his things. Draco was currently folding his clothes in a nearly violent manner, muttering under his breath about how unfair the situation was. The line between his brows was more prominent than Harry had seen it in a while. His narrow shoulders were inching towards his ears, strained beyond belief.
The smile on Harry’s face was bright and immediate. He dug his phone out from his pants pocket, talking as he scrolled through photos. “He’s my cousin. Well, sort of. It’s kind of like he’s my nephew, too. I don’t know. His dad, Remus, is Sirius’s best friend. They were both best friends of my mum and dad, too.” Harry stopped scrolling and handed his phone to Draco. The photo was one of Harry and a little boy, no more than two years old. The boy—Teddy—was sitting on Harry’s shoulders in a stairway, a beaming grin on his young face like he had been laughing. The thing that caught his eye, however, was Teddy’s teal blue hair.
him.” The fingers in his hair receded. “I’m completely and pathetically in love with him. And he loves me, too.”
“Never.” Draco smiled, leaning forward to softly rub his nose against Harry’s. “Only when your godfather catches us making out in your car in a parking lot.”
” he shrieked.
(Draco couldn’t pinpoint what it was—but Hermione looked lost. Perhaps it was her eyes, lowered and swollen. Or maybe it was the set of her trembling mouth, it was like she was trying to keep her sobs inside. Or maybe it was something he couldn’t see. Something was hidden inside her heart. A fracture, a hole that she was struggling to fill, a tear that she didn’t have the needle to sew back together. Draco knew the pain of losing a friend, but he was certain that whatever Hermione was feeling, whatever plagued her heart—it was worse than anything Draco might’ve compared it to. After all, it is impossible to know exactly what someone is feeling unless you are that person. And even then, it can be hard to tell)
“Is that all?
The laughter died down. Draco didn’t want to leave. He didn’t want Harry to stop touching him. He
“I tried to follow him down the stairs—but I tripped over myself halfway down and fell the rest of the way.” Draco pulled back only far enough to face Harry. The dejection that was written across his face, the trembling line of his mouth, the tears trailing down his blotchy cheeks—it all made Harry’s heart splinter into a million pieces. Harry slowly leaned forward and gently leaned his forehead against Draco’s, trying to keep the images of Draco—crumpled at the bottom of the stairs, bruised and screaming and sobbing—at bay. It didn’t work. Before he could make any more effort to stop them, tears ran down his face. “I watched my father throw
Draco had decided to go on a walk after Maths, to try and clear his head, despite the slight chill in the air on the grounds of the academy. He’d walked almost all the way around the grounds when he came to a stop at the football field; because there, leading the group of people running laps around the field, was Harry Potter. Harry, who was wearing a grey pair of shorts and a grey tank top, the latter of which was covered in sweat, like the rest of him. His glasses had seemingly disappeared from his nose, but as they turned a corner of the field, he seemed to be able to see just fine.
“Um, y-yeah, yeah I did.”
Draco huffed a breath in exasperation. He knew that she wouldn’t stop texting him if he didn’t do as she wanted.
Just like how that cupboard under the stairs was dark—especially when Vernon shoved him in it as punishment.
His mind wandered to that morning, where, true to his word, Harry had shown up to breakfast on time. However, his eyes had been shadowed like he hadn’t slept much the night before. He’d spent nearly the entire meal hunched over with his chin on Draco’s shoulder and his arms wrapped around the blond boy’s waist, hardly eating anything at all.
After they shared a laugh, a comfortable sort of quiet took over them. It was like they were both simply basking in knowing that the other was there, even if not in person. Draco nibbled at his bottom lip, debating on how to bring up what he’d really wanted to talk about. His fingers twitched. Burning heat had already rushed to his face, and he hadn’t even said anything yet.
Draco’s eyes only softened while his smile spread. His fingers trailed down Harry’s stomach until his fingers hooked in the belt loops of his jeans, jerking Harry closer with his hold. “I love you,” he whispered, almost conspiratorially.
“Is that how… Tell me that’s not how—Your
Also, trigger warning for the end of the chapter, when the big chunk of text in italics starts, there is a scene about child abuse, and some of the writing afterwards might be triggering for someone with an eating disorder. If you're not comfortable reading that, don't worry, I totally get it, I'm going to include a short summary in the end notes.
“So it’s
“They can squish in the backseat.”
“I did not!” Draco protested, his face flushing and his hands fidgeting.
Two days. Draco had already spent two days in Malfoy Manor, avoiding his father and trying to find a moment alone to talk with his mum—only she was being constantly bombarded with last-minute plans for the party that would be taking place the next night. He hadn’t been able to find a convenient time to just…
Draco bolted, shoving other students out of his way without remorse. At the moment, he couldn’t care less about any of them. He just needed to get to Harry. After searching aimlessly for what was probably too long to be rational, Draco had to reel himself back in and think logically.
Ron looked up at him with a shaky smile on his face.
Slowly, giving him time to move away, Harry moved his hands to cup Draco’s face and kissed his forehead, then moved down to kiss cheeks. He could taste the salt of Draco’s tears on his lips as he kissed them away. A trembling sigh escaped Draco’s mouth. His chilled fingers pressed more firmly on Harry’s pulse—just enough to make Harry feel it too.
The scarlet flush and baffled look on Draco’s face would have made for an adorable combination if Harry’s brain hadn’t still been going a mile a minute, trying to process everything that had just happened while also calming itself.
“Okay,” Hermione said, standing up. “I’m going to go clean my face. Harry, I heard a rumor that Fred and George may or may not have snuck in a few bottles of Baileys in celebration of their magnificent captain.” She looked at him with a smile that was almost a smirk. “Go have fun, I’ll be down in a few.”
Draco dragged a hand down his face. He hated the pleading tone in his boyfriend’s voice, hated that he was right. He just wanted to help. He just wanted to make things better and make it up to Harry somehow.
“Come on, am I going to have to carry you?” Harry asked sarcastically, poking his boyfriend in the ribs.
“Here, look at me,” Draco whispered. His fingers gently grasped at Harry’s chin and pulled him to face him. He held a damp washcloth in his other hand and began gently dabbing at Harry’s mouth.
this. To finally be able to tell someone. To be heard, after being silenced and broken for so long.
From the passenger side door came a woman—assumedly Narcissa Malfoy—who also had blonde hair, although it was a few shades darker and the top section of her hair was nearly black. She wore a deep green colored blouse tucked into a pair of black dress pants, both looking like they were made of extremely fine materials. Although instead of the scowl that adorned her husband’s face, Mrs. Malfoy’s held a warm smile as she looked at her son.
Draco watched with bated breath and anticipation pooling at the base of his spine. His fingers twitched with it. He watched as Harry dribbled the ball up the field with incredible speed, the seconds ticking down against him. And yet, just as the clock was down to three seconds, Harry had reached Castelobruxo’s goal.
“Then explain to me how he’s been happier since he stopped talking to you. Explain how he didn’t go to you, he didn’t ask for you, he didn't even wonder where you were. If he needs you so badly, why haven’t you been there?”
The grin that spread on Harry’s lips was wide and crooked and made Draco’s heart pound and his mouth twitch upwards. “I’d like that,” he answered, and intertwined their fingers.
“Dray, I need you to send me the address, okay?” Harry’s heart had dropped to the pit of his stomach, fear burrowed down deep in his bones.
“I’m sorry, I just wanted to see if you were as red as I thought you’d be.” Harry appraised him and shrugged nonchalantly—before his demeanor suddenly became more serious. Draco instantly felt as though he had his boyfriend’s complete, undivided attention, and the frown on his lips dissipated. “I would also really rather be able to see you, especially when we’re talking about something important.”
His mind went blank. Harry wasn’t even thinking about the punching bag in front of him anymore. He’d reached that mind-place where he was moving purely on muscle memory. He was barely even comprehending what he was seeing in front of him, Harry was so zoned out. Someone could have screamed and he probably wouldn’t have heard it. (This was the best part for him. This was the place where nothing and no one bothered him, not even himself. This was the place where he got to forget who he was, where he got to forget everything and just
As much as Draco loved the sound of Harry’s laugh (it was a deep sound, like he was using his whole chest space to laugh with, and it was such a light, airy laugh that instantly made you want to be let in on the joke, it made you want to laugh with him) Draco couldn’t see what was funny. Did he ask it wrong? He knew that there were definitely wrong and offensive ways to ask, but Draco was pretty sure that he hadn’t said anything offensive.
And somewhat literally.
(See the end of the chapter for
The next thing I remember he had shoved me away and grabbed everything off my desk… my sketchbooks, pencils, all of it. Before I knew it he was down the stairs and—and I was…” Every inch of Draco’s body was quivering with the force of his choking sobs, as though he was trying to keep them quiet, to silence them. Harry could feel the pain emanating off of him. “I was
Shivers of bliss ran down Draco’s spine. Every nerve under his skin felt as if it had been lulled into some pleasurable trance. The soothing smell of lemons and lavender filled his senses, seeping into his skin and filling the air.
TW: Descriptions of a panic/anxiety attack
He couldn’t let himself fall asleep without telling Harry as much. Receiving a soft kiss to his head, Draco finally found himself falling into the depths of sleep in the arms of the boy he loved.
The drive back to Hogwarts was quiet. In the backseat, Pansy swiped through Harry’s photos with Theo, cooing over the ones with Astrid especially. Hermione and Blaise were silently looking out of the window, watching the road go by. Harry held Draco’s hand over the center console, rubbing circles into his soft skin with his thumb. The radio was a distant background noise, Draco humming along to the slow melody. When Harry parked in the school’s garage, the calm atmosphere followed them out of the car and into the school’s corridors as they made their way to the southern common room once again. Harry held Draco’s hand and walked behind Pansy and Theo—who were now giggling at the pictures of Draco on his phone—swinging their hands between them. Harry could hear Hermione babbling excitedly about the books her parents had sent her, telling Blaise all about the new things she’d been studying.
“Healer Brady said you might need to stop in the middle of a memory if you develop a headache or confusion. I’m coming. Especially since you’ll be starting with technically two memories.”
Everything in the kitchen looked state of the art. A mixture of muggle and wizarding tools and technologies. There was an extra wide oven with six gas burners. Clean, wide, grey and white granite counters and pale grey backsplash. The cabinets were lightly stained pine wood. Gandalf, who had been winding around Harry’s ankles, stopped him at the corner of the counter and yipped up at it expectantly. Harry found a jar of dog cookies resting there, and mindlessly pulled one out and offered it to Gandalf, who jumped to grab it out of his hand. Hermione sniffed in disapproval.
“Harry,” he said quietly, walking towards him. “Can we talk?”
“Ron and I train in here,” Malfoy explained. “Sometimes you’ll join us. Or Dudley, even.”
Instead, another knock sounded on the door, this one with a more frantic rhythm. “Harry!” an unfamiliar women’s voice called through.
Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever had breakfast for dinner, but it did sound brilliant. “Yeah,” he smiled.
“Whatcha making?”  Harry asked.
Walking down Diagon Alley side by side with Draco was strange. People were staring at them. Not that Harry wasn’t used to it. Or to being scrutinized. But it felt as though every aspect of them was being analyzed for gossip fodder. Could people tell the current state of their relationship based on how closely they were walking? The way their heads tilted as they talked to one another?
“Yeah, Ron knows it was an accident.”
“I’m sorry for last night,” he said, voice tight.
Harry watched as his other self opened his eyes and pushed to his feet, then cast a solid corporeal patronus just as Malfoy’s mist faltered. The stag drove off the dementors, and Harry fell right back to the ground.
Also, has anyone watched Schitt's Creek? I just finished the last season, so if you're not caught up SPOILER ahead, but I just really feel like David and Patrick have such Drarry vibes and need someone to geek out about it with!
Draco went to pick it up, but Pansy slapped her hand, tipped with sharp purple nails, down to hold it to the table. “
Ire instantly rose up in Harry. “Those dishes are from my breakfast.”
Firstly, Oscar threw a near fit that they wouldn’t let him join them. It was the middle of a Saturday and they were headed for a muggle park, though. Finally, Draco tossed him a large piece of jerky. “You spoilt brat,” he muttered, in a tone that held both fondness and irritation.
Gandalf was nowhere to be seen as Harry slipped out of bed and headed downstairs. Draco’s office was dark and empty, which made Harry even more nervous. As he reached the stairs to the kitchen, though, Harry could register a dim glow.
“How are you feeling?” he asked Harry worriedly.
.” He waved his hand between them significantly. “Back when we first got together, I was a little more experienced than you, but not much. And now, you don’t remember anything.”
“You want to go out? Like… a date?”
Harry hadn’t told Niamh, as the nightmares weren’t any worse than he’d remembered them being. “No, but I will, if you think I should. Sorry to have woken you. I forgot the silencing charm.”
“I’m just here for emergency support,” Ron said, wrinkling his nose at the idea of having to watch the memory. Hermione was supposed to have joined them as well, but had gotten held up at work.
“Hah! I knew it,” Harry didn’t know why he was teasing Malfoy. They hardly knew one another well enough for it. But he couldn’t help it. And with the adorably rattled look on Malfoy’s face, Harry couldn’t bring himself to regret it.
It was strange to have lost his memories of slowly coming to terms with his sexuality. Now that he’d woken up to the reality of it, it was ridiculously obvious. He wasn’t easing his way into his attraction for Malfoy, he’d been plunged in deep. To his credit, Malfoy did seem to be trying not to make it harder on him.
“That’s cute,” Harry laughed. “I wanted to be a superhero… one of those heroes with an alter-ego. No one would know I secretly had super powers and saved them from all sorts of evil. I was just scruffy little Harry, after all.”
Harry took note of that before asking his next question, “What was your favourite class in school?”
Longeman frowned slightly, clearly unimpressed with Harry’s attitude.
“Do I just not deserve to be happy? Is that it?” Harry was fully yelling now. “Was I happy, Hermione? With him? I sure fucking look like I was!”
“Yeah,” Harry gasped, untangling himself from the sheets. He added worriedly, “Are you?”
“Auror Longeman,” Draco greeted pleasantly, while Harry stared Longeman down with flashing eyes. “Please, sit. How is the tea?”
Harry squinted at Malfoy, turning his words over in his mind for possible alternate meanings. Finding none, he nodded, “that sounds like a better idea than starting with Potions, anyhow.”
Taking umbrage with Harry’s concerned tone, Draco snapped, “It’s fine, Harry.”
The house-elf (apparently a free elf, dressed in a well-tailored suit) nodded as she poured steaming tea into three cups and passed it around.
“Yes like a date. A proper date.”
Once Annalise had left, with a promise of returning with a wine for Draco and a sparkling juice for Harry, he reached for Draco’s forearm, “Fuck, I’m sorry.”
Something else about the reality he’d woken up in was far from what he’d expected though.
just yet, whatever would come out would do just fine, he was sure) when Draco spoke again, this time so softly it was nearly a whisper.
“Thought you’d get a kick out of that one,” Malfoy chuckled. Then, he added seriously, “When I first managed the charm, it was a leopard. Then, after that… a stag.”
He snatched a photograph of the two of them racing on their brooms in the Weasley’s orchard off the wall and threw it across the room. The harsh sound of broken glass made Hermione gasp.
They fell into silence for a moment before Malfoy said, “Today’s my last day home before I’m back to my regular training schedule.”
“Fuck. That was stupid of me. Sorry. Again.”
“Oh.” Harry stared at the wall over Draco’s shoulder. “Right then.”
All the same, after dinner when Draco headed for the pensieve, Harry swallowed back his anxiety and said, “Draco…”
Ron unwrapped a chocolate frog from the table next to him and held it, its little legs squirming out between his fingers. “I reckon so. Last time I sort of… forgot to ask. I just told you all the things that I wanted for my stag. Hermione’ll approve of this, at least.”
Stay safe and well everyone! Thanks for reading and comments are always appreciated - even if not replied to right away! :)
“I can’t remember
“Sure,” Draco smiled indulgently as he tugged Gandalf away from a tree stump that held some interesting smells. “Who goes first then?”
His breath caught in his lungs and he stuttered to a stop as he realized who was next to Ron. The two of them, both over six feet, made quite a stately pair in their well-tailored Auror robes. Dark grey wool, with red sleeves and vermillion piping, blue badges on their chests marking them as trainees.
each other.”
“Yeah,” he rubbed at the back of his neck. “Yeah. I mean, I know it’s all going to be terribly awkward. So I’m sorry about that part of it all. But your friends with all my friends now, and I have to trust past-me’s judgement I suppose. I thought what you said, about getting to know each other as friends made sense.” He shrugged helplessly. “I’d like to get to know you.”
The oldest paper, save from those that spoke about Harry’s testimony at Draco and Narcissa’s trials, had a photograph of a distressed looking Harry cradling an unconscious Malfoy in his arms as he walked down a dark street.
Draco murmured his appreciation for her sympathy, then asked, “So you’re happy?”
Then there were the Aurors. Longeman had been infuriatingly both useless and condescending during their meeting yesterday. Harry was still being kept prisoner in his own home and frustration was bubbling up inside him.
He reached a hand across the table and wrapped it around Draco’s wrist. “I don’t think you have to worry about that.”
“Yeah, sorry.” Harry said as Draco took a few more steps into the room. “Nightmare.”
Using Draco seemed a little too personal, still. Like jumping ahead of the point they’d been forced to rewind to. And calling him Malfoy would probably be hurtful, given their relationship.
“Headmistress,” Malfoy’s smile matched hers.
Rolling his eyes again, Harry replied. “Right. Well, you ready?”
Slowly, though, he managed to get his mind under control. Moving through the motions of all the drills was both soothing and exhilarating. Harry felt as though a piece of himself was falling back into place as he ran, directed, and observed on the field. His body simply knew what to do. The scent of freshly cut spring grass was a familiar embrace to his senses. Warm sunshine shimmered in vibrant hues as the sun continued its descent towards the horizon.
Harry slowly pulled away. Draco opened his eyes to see his boyfriend already looking at him, his hands moving to cup Draco’s face. The blond boy leaned into his hands, savoring the way that Harry traced his lips with his thumb, the way that he was looking at him like there was nowhere else he’d rather be. Draco linked his fingers behind Harry’s neck. Looking deep into his sparkling green eyes, he realized something. It had been building up from the moment they’d met, and he was sure that it had clicked before this moment. But now felt like the perfect time.
Draco thought. But he couldn’t find the strength within himself to look away. He had a broad back, and hips that were narrow, but certainly not as small as Draco’s. His skin was a rich, almost-light brown with olive undertones, and the lighting of the room seemed to make him glow.
A small smile seemed to find its way onto Harry’s face. “I’m not going to make you do anything you’re not comfortable with, my love.” Harry lightly tugged on one of Draco’s braids. The smaller boy only settled further in his boyfriend’s lap and cupped Harry’s face in his hands, caressing his cheekbones with his thumbs. Overflowing fondness filled Draco’s heart, an uncontrolled wave of affection. “If you don’t feel comfortable going in there, we won’t go, and that’s okay, baby.”
Draco finally felt Harry’s chest movements begin to slow. Though it was still too shallow and fast to be considered calming, Draco would take what successes he could.
Sooo... yeah. This wasn't really where I was going with this chapter? But it just sort of came out that way? Anyway, I hope you liked it. Comments are always welcome! I'm gonna need 'em to get me through these next few weeks <3<3<3
The sternness in her gaze immediately commanded Draco’s compliance. “Promise me that you’ll stay calm.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair and down his face as he replied, “Sleep, Angie,
Harry’s grin was practically invincible. Seeing Sirius, Remus, and Draco talk and laugh together was everything Harry never knew he wanted. Or
,” Draco interrupted, gently but firmly. Those anxious green eyes snapped up to look at him, slight surprise in their depths. “First of all, you shouldn’t have to hide or avoid talking about your past just to accommodate others. It
And like lightning, Draco’s head instantly snapped up, startling Harry. His grey eyes were wide and nearly horrified. His hands suddenly grasped Harry’s and yanked them to his chest as he exclaimed, “No! No, Harry, God, no, never.”
, Harry thought, sitting on the bench in the locker rooms, minutes before the game was going to start,
“Sweetheart, why didn’t you
When he was finally able to collect himself, after what felt like forever of listening to Sirius’ cooing words, Harry pulled away. Pressing the heels of his palms into his eyes, he felt icy fingers dusting against his bicep. It served as a comforting reminder that Draco—who had seen him weak and vulnerable and a mess—hadn’t left his side.
“Will you…” Draco swallowed and rested his cold hands on top of Harry’s. “Will you come with me when my parents come to pick me up? Meet my mum?”
“Theo,” Harry started, “You’re going to listen to me, and you’re going to listen very carefully.” He tightened his grip on the other boy’s shoulder. He tried to put as much force and authority into his words as possible without overwhelming Theo. He remembered all too well the suffocating fear that Theo was enduring. “You
And then something occurred to Harry.
By the time she’d finished, Pansy was pink-faced and had planted her hands on her hips, a stance that Draco knew all too well. It usually meant that whatever she was ranting about, she was right.
Pansy smiled up at Harry, and he knew right then that none of his friends would be leaving him any time soon. They would stick by him, as long as he did the same. That thought brought more comfort at that moment than any of his calming techniques. The only thing that could have made it better would have been Draco, sitting there with them, laughing and smiling with them.
Pansy’s purple lips were pursed in a thin line. The apprehension in her gaze caused Draco’s brows to rise as he stared at her, waiting for an answer. One that didn’t come until they were safely seated on a couch in the southern common room. Theo and Blaise were already there among the other students milling about, almost as if they’d been waiting for them.
he chided.
“Well,” Draco asked, “was it worth dragging me into the rain?”
Shaking his head the other boy answered, “No. But- But I’m going to go and talk to him tomorrow. I’m going to tell him it was my fault and-”
“Alright, alright,” Harry surrendered, a sly, mischievous smirk on his face, “you can pay me back later. But just so we’re clear,” Harry leaned in close to teasingly brush his lips against the shell of his boyfriend’s ear, lightly nibbling his earlobe, “you would be the hottest housewife on the block.”
The newest member of their team looked around at his teammates. Ever so slowly, the worry melted off his face, leaving the smallest of smiles behind. Lastly, he looked back at Harry, who felt a spark of pride in his chest. He’d given similar pep-talks to each and every one of his teammates and been on the receiving end of them more than once. The other boy’s eyes had lost the majority of their uncertainty, his shoulders lost most of their tension.
Harry squeezed his hand and brought him closer to his side before answering, equally quiet.
“Where did you go? After your parents died, I mean.”
Draco didn’t know what to do. He had taken his seat on the plane, between an old, cranky bat of a woman and what could possibly be the most dazzling pair of green eyes he’d ever seen. He’d done his best to avoid being awkward, he made small talk with the other boy (although calling him a boy did him no justice, he was well built with slightly broad shoulders and messy, fluffy black hair that looked so soft, and he couldn’t possibly be much younger or older than Draco and-)
Breathing was nearly impossible, his lungs stuttered and heaved. One of Harry’s hands gripped his hip so tightly, he was sure he would leave bruises behind—but Draco couldn’t care less, he wanted Harry to mark him, to leave reminders that he’d been there. His other hand plunged underneath Draco’s shirt, grazing up his sides and eliciting another high-pitched whine from Draco. Having Harry touch him, kiss him,
Hermione’s almost black eyes narrowed, “There’s someone new?”
His favorite store, Soap & Scents Essential. His mouth dropped open. He grabbed for Harry’s arm and gripped it with disbelief, he knew his eyes were wide as saucers, his father
Malfoy smiled gently at Harry, who kept his attention steadfastly on his jumper, which to the likely dismay of Molly, was now unravelling. Something niggled at Harry’s memory. Ginny had mentioned that when he broke up with her, he had come out to her as well.
Professor McGonagall had written him up a list of the subjects he was pursuing at the NEWT level, and the course content and assignment outlines. She’d crossed out the assignments they’d decided not to bother having him repeat and stars demarcated the ones he would need to do again.
The crup crawled right up Harry’s lap until his paws rested on Harry’s chest and he could swipe his tongue eagerly across Harry’s face. Harry looked up to see Ron and Hermione studying him for signs of recognition. He sighed and shook his head, before standing up. Harry had opted for Malfoy to leave the crup, figuring that the company would be nice. Harry had always wanted a dog.
“Hermione said it was your favourite fancy place,” Harry kept his tone casual, but in reality he was quite pleased with himself as well. It was good to see Draco happy.
Harry nodded his acceptance. “I’m not hungry. Can we just go home?”
Rolling his eyes, Draco swatted at Harry, “Oh, piss off.”
“Auror Longeman,” Harry replied in an equally cool tone. “Thank you for meeting me.”
“Well,” Harry grinned, “breakfast for dinner’s a fantastic idea. Breakfast is the best meal of the day, but who wants to wake up that early to eat it?”
Draco looked at him resignedly. “Because it won’t make any difference.”
“The healers have told me I need to remove myself from the situation, for now.” Malfoy said, clearly deciding he didn’t want to discuss whatever it was the Prophet had to say after all. “That it will be too much of a strain on Harry to have me around. That someone who he trusts deeply should explain it all to him.”
Draco went pale and it was Harry who had shut down the idea.
“Good morning, boys.”
true stories.”
Why couldn’t they have assigned his case to an Auror who’d been a part of the Order as well? Ron’s reassurances that Longeman was a strong investigator and generally known as trustworthy somehow didn’t feel like much right now. Not with Longeman studying Harry with those watery brown eyes of his and his military style, light brown hair.
His evasive tone sparked Harry’s suspicion. “If you had to choose, though. Go on, tell me.”
“Blood pressure: 124/82, Heart Rate: 86, Blood Oxygen: 98, Respirations: 14 a minute. Great,” she clapped her hands and stood back from Harry.
Draco was ambitious and determined, yes. And back at school Harry would have counted those as terrible traits that proved Draco was a shadow of his detestable father. But now Harry recognised that Draco’s ambition was fuelled by earnestness, by his want to learn and to contribute to the world. Draco was specific, sometimes to the point of rigidity. But he was also playful and witty. He could be stern, but it was tempered by how freely he expressed fondness. Watching Draco with their friends and even with Oscar and Gandalf, caused Harry’s insides to melt. In comparison, Draco held back with Harry. Each unsaid thought, each move to reach for him followed by withdrawal and a furtive look to see if Harry had caught on, if he was uncomfortable or angry about the slip up. It made Harry long to break that barrier.
He’d hardly done anything but pay attention to Draco. And there was a lot to pay attention to.
“Good morning,” Harry interrupted, feeling that it was now safe to do so.
“Harry, you may have forgotten many of our arguments, but I’m sure it comes as no surprise that your frequent disinclination to dress for the occasion is a never-ending source of frustration for me. I’ve hardly ever seen you looking so done up.”
Completely stunned by the change of pace, Harry couldn’t do more than blink at him.
“Okay,” Draco replied, reaching to grab Harry’s hand for a moment. “It isn’t, you’re right. But it is what it is and I don’t think they’re going to pursue me as a suspect, so it doesn’t matter.”
A surging mixture of excitement and anxiety washed over Harry. “Great!”
Harry blinked at the fireplace as Draco disappeared into the floo. He glanced towards Ron.
“You were brilliant, Gin,” Harry said as he gratefully accepted the mug of tea.
Not twenty minutes ago Draco had, in fact, let his mouth fall open in clear awe and admiration when Harry had walked into the master bath to ask Draco what was taking him so bloody long.
“Save it for another day, Theo,” Pansy said, drawing him onto the couch to sit beside Draco, “when you have some actual backup. Besides, I already broke his nose. It’d be cruel to let you at him already.”
“Well, my father has decided that it would be best if he took me out of school a few days earlier than planned.” Draco laid his head on Harry’s shoulder. The smaller boy shifted so he was fully in Harry’s lap, burrowing into him. “Like, today, early. In two hours, early.”
“You’re more help than you think,” Hermione whispered to him. Draco felt pressure building behind his eyes, but it wasn’t enough to make him cry. He just held her tighter.
deal? Why’re you two so quick to forgive him?”
“I shouldn’t
But the voices hadn’t come through until he stopped moving. Once he felt himself be lowered—onto something soft, a bed maybe?—his body moved without his consent, curling in on himself. Maybe if he made himself smaller, the fear would ignore him. Maybe if he took up less space, his heart would stop beating up his ribs. Maybe his lungs would start remembering how to breathe.
“Do you want a kiss to make you feel better?”

see them again soon.
“You have no idea how unbelievably happy I am right now,” Harry said kissing Draco’s forehead. He started leaving tiny kisses all over Draco’s face, little pecks that made Draco giggle and smile like a lunatic. His entire being felt warm, he was used to feeling cold, but he felt
He’d had to use so much of Pansy’s makeup to cover up the mark on his neck Harry had left. But Draco didn’t mind, he kind of liked the reminder that Harry had been there, that Harry had kissed him and
“I’ve looked into it,” Draco said. He leaned further into Harry, his bony shoulder pressing into the muscles of his chest. “It’s always been a dream of mine to go to art school. It's just that… Well, my father wants me to go to business school.” Draco’s smile transformed into a scowl, his nose wrinkling. “Not so much
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah.” Draco could barely hold eye contact, and his face was just as flushed as it had been the night before when he’d called Harry. His fingers twitched at his sides, and Harry could see his feet shuffling ever so slightly while his brow furrowed.
When they finally parked in Hogwarts’ garage, Draco had fallen asleep with his head against the window. As Harry got out of the car, he decided to leave his boyfriend’s things in the trunk until morning. He gently shook Draco awake, but the boy only latched onto his neck with his eyes still closed, so Harry carefully lifted him up and out of the car, clutching him close to his body. Draco’s legs wrapped around his hips and his head lolled onto Harry’s shoulder.
his thoughts were too occupied with questions he wanted to ask Harry. He was just now realizing how little he knew about Harry’s life. Sure, he knew
Grinning down at him, Harry leaned in and pressed a swift kiss to Draco’s lips, pulling away and smirking at the sight of Draco chasing him for more. With a quick kiss to his forehead, Harry replied, “I love you too, kitten.” After adjusting the strap of the duffle bag on his shoulder, Harry turned Draco back around to face the great door.
with the way Harry had been brought up. “How was… how was Harry raised?”
He threw the blankets off of him and ran like hell to the bathroom, nearly tripping over Blaise and Theo’s sleeping bodies on the floor. He threw open the door, reaching the toilet just in time to disgorge the contents of his stomach. He clutched the sides of the toilet, his head pounding and his throat burning. Cold sweat coated his forehead, a droplet running down his temple.
He ran a hand down his face, looking down at his hands in his lap.
Harry had never been so wound up for a football game. Well, not one that he could remember at the moment. The last time Hogwarts’ football team had played against Beauxbatons Institute, Oliver Wood had been captain, and they’d lost. Drastically. The memories were still ingrained in Harry’s mind; how Oliver had stayed strong in the face of defeat, the manner in which he had managed to cheer up the team despite their bitter moods. Despite
“If Petunia has your mum’s stuff,” she continued, as if he hadn’t said anything, “then where did your dad’s things go?” Hermione tucked herself closer into Harry’s side to avoid getting jostled by the other students, wrapping her arm around his hips until her thumb was tucked into the belt loop at his other side to avoid getting separated. “I mean, if Sirius or Remus had it, then you would’ve known already, right?”
He heard Draco groan from behind him—but when he went to stand again, Draco just remained attached to his back, almost like a monkey would. His arms moved to clutch at his shoulders when Harry stood upright, shaking his head at Draco’s antics. Theo and Blaise burst into snickers while Pansy took out her phone to snap a picture and Hermione covered her mouth to try and keep her own laughter to a minimum.
The memory of her, curled in on herself on the stairway in tears, was burned into his brain. Ron had already caused both of them so much pain and so many problems. The things he’d said had opened too many wounds; it would be a while before they could heal. But no matter how much time they gave it, Harry knew that there would always be scars on the once-clean surface of their friendship.
Hermione had noticed these same things about Harry, had asked the same questions, had received the same answers. But whenever Draco saw her looking at Harry, she always had the same analyzing glint in her dark eyes.
the thought of you with someone else, and there’s
Harry Potter
What kind of comforting information is that?”
“It’s nice to meet you, Joan,” Harry said, plastering what he hoped was a convincingly pleasant smile on his face. It became less forced when she smiled back at him.
He was ready now. In hindsight, Harry didn’t know why he hadn’t said anything. Why he hadn’t told anyone what had been bothering him. He didn’t know why he bothered to bottle it inside him. It had never done him any good before. But now, he was ready to get everything off of his chest before it crushed him.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat, then started pounding double-time. He felt nearly light-headed. He crushed his lips to Harry’s, bringing his body as close to the other boy’s as possible. His chest pressed into Harry’s, his hands ran up and down his strong shoulders. He wanted to be zipped into the same skin with him, he wanted to learn every inch of him, he wanted to touch him and taste him and
Staring at the screen for a few seconds longer, Draco finally let his arm drop back down to the mattress—just as his bedroom door creaked open. Snapping his head to look at the intruder, he saw only his mother with a small smile on her face. Her hair was pulled back in a messy knot on top of her head and she was dressed in a threadbare t-shirt and tattered sweatpants—the sight reminded him of lazy Saturdays in the living room while his father was away.
Draco closed his puffy, red-tinged eyes, tilting his chin down to his chest. “I-I was—and, and Father came in—and—” Words sputtered out. His face crumpled and more tears flowed down his face, a choked breath escaped his lips. Harry felt as though someone had sucker-punched him in the stomach.
Only to find his boyfriend in only his boxer briefs, his sweatpants and t-shirt tossed onto the floor while he had been distracted. Planting his hands on his hips, Draco playfully scowled at his drowsy boyfriend.
it. He loved that there was still more for him to learn about the other boy.
delectable, really.”
to even come
Harry caught Draco looking at him and pointed out, “That’s Sirius behind me. That picture was taken the day Astrid was born.” Draco looked up at his boyfriend to see him smiling affectionately down at Astrid.
A small laugh was the only response given. A gentle smile sat on Harry’s lips as Draco allowed him to clean up his own mess. Though, he had to admit that this paint-streaked version of Draco was absolutely adorable—what with the light in his eyes and the blush rising to his cheeks contradicting the faltering scowl on his lips.
Draco immediately tensed, expecting the worst.
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry I haven’t had time for you lately,” Harry whispered softly, his peppermint breath caressing Draco’s ear, his neck.
Harry’s eyebrow rose of its own accord.
“Can we talk? Please?”
“Harry,” Sirius said, quietly enough so no one around them might overhear, “how are you, really? Any new developments with Ron?”
“Oh, come on,” he said, a teasing lilt to his voice, “we
“What? What is it?” Hermione blurted.
With a quick glance at Hermione, he leaned a little closer to Harry as he said, “I’m sorry, Pansy needs me. I have to go, sweetie, but I’ll be back as soon as I possibly can be, alright?” Harry opened his eyes, and Draco could almost see how hard Harry was working to believe that he would really be back. Draco squeezed his hand and kissed him lightly, before getting up and making his way to the door. Looking over his shoulder with his hand on the door handle, he saw Harry and Hermione settling back into sleep, and this time, Draco wasn’t nearly as bothered by Hermione’s hand in his soft hair.
Alright, I hope you liked it! Comment, comment, comment! I love them and they basically make my day. So, I hope you liked it!
“Harry,” Hermione was whispering, glancing at Draco’s scared eyes, “I need you to take deep, even breaths, love, or you’re going to get a nose bleed.”
My dearest readers, I'm seriously so sorry that this chapter is so late. There's been so much going on, my life has been so hellish and for the past two weeks... this chapter was sooo hard to write, and I'm so sorry that it's not as good as usual, so I hope you accept this apology and don't hate me too much.
It had no doubt left Harry aching and drained, and a multitude of other things that Draco couldn’t even begin to comprehend. Draco knew that he couldn’t ever forget the fear that had nearly stopped his heart.
Harry thought.
“Harry… Do you remember back in year nine, when that boy called me-” she cut herself off.
bitter mood.
Racing down the steps, Harry practically threw himself into Sirius’ arms. Though he was taller and broader than the other man, he felt like a boy—a child—when his godfather hugged him tightly. He couldn’t choke back the hot tears that rolled down his face. He couldn’t withhold the sobs that wracked his body, nor the pathetic sounds that burst out of his mouth. The fast pounding of his heart made him feel like he was nearly dying.
Without question, Draco did as he was told. He slid onto the bed behind Harry, wrapping himself around his boyfriend as Hermione had. He felt Harry’s rapid heartbeat through his back, felt his lungs struggling for breath, his warmth seeping into Draco’s skin. Draco held onto him as tightly as possible, nuzzling his face into the juncture of Harry’s neck and shoulder.
Fred kicked the ball to Theo. It was a farther distance than Harry would have liked.
—like they were anywhere near
A huff of a laugh came from Harry’s barely-there grin. He felt Draco squeeze him as if reiterating the sentiment. His breath fanned across Harry’s skin, cool and soothing.
Boredom rolled over Draco in unrelenting waves as he listened to Professor Binns drone on about whatever it was he’d been lecturing about for the past hour. He hadn’t cared enough to pay attention to any of it. Hopefully, Draco could get notes from Hermione before he had this class again.
, you
Draco
“Hello, Mrs. Malfoy. It's lovely to finally meet you.”
“Ferreira,” Harry greeted him, his voice tight and clipped, and when the other boy was within reach, offered his hand, “you played well. Dirty as always.”
Despite the wave of affection Harry felt for his boyfriend, his fists were aching to get back to beating something, the agitation was still settled in his bones, his skin was itching with aggression, and he knew that if he didn’t work it off now it would just grow into something uglier and heavier.
“Who’s Harry?”
That was, at least, until Draco begged him not to be.
Harry thought, his stomach twisting into a knot. He’d tried calling Draco earlier that night, but he hadn’t picked up. Harry had just assumed that he was still at his mother’s party. He quickly answered his phone, his voice gravelly and deep with sleep as he spoke.
not.”
Ronald nodded sharply. “Yeah… Well, goodnight then, I guess.” He turned and walked into the bathroom without another word.
Draco nodded. His face fell like he already knew where Harry was going with this. His pale fingers tightened on Harry’s, encouraging him to go on.
“Look,” Pansy pinched the bridge of her nose, “I get it, okay? I do. You’re uncertain, you’ve never been in a relationship before. It’s okay to have feelings, it
Warm bath water swirled around Draco’s legs. He was sitting back against Harry’s chest, in between his legs with his strong arms wrapped around his waist. His boyfriend had had to carry him to the bathtub, his body was so limp, so exhausted.
Once Harry had Teddy settled—if you could call sitting on Harry’s shoulders and excitedly babbling settled—he hugged Tonks, careful not to crush Astrid. The baby’s dark eyes looked at Harry widely, her mousy brown hair still a slight mess. Her nearly toothless mouth pulled into a shy, giggling smile, warming Harry all the way to the center of his heart.
There was no part of Harry that was ugly, no part of him that Draco didn’t love with every fiber in his body. It was a miracle, some work of heaven, that a person so kind as Harry had emerged from the darkness of this past. Draco would need time—time to come to terms with everything he had learned.
Making as little noise as he could, Harry dashed out of his dorm room, then down to the common room and out into the corridor. He listened closely to Draco’s breathing as he ran to the secret passage that led closest to the school’s garage, completely disregarding the fact that it was nighttime and he could very well get caught for sneaking out after curfew.
“I’ve been looking around at a few—”
do this. Everyone gets nervous in their first game. Everyone gets scared. But you
Alright, so I've gotten a few requests for a sequel, and I decided that I actually wanted to write one. I planned on ten chapters. Since the first chapter of this was just meant to be a one-shot, there isn't really a whole lot of plot or depth of character, so I kind of had to cram some of it into this chapter (sorry). It's a little bit of a filler. I also decided that I really liked the idea of a black Hermione, and a biracial Harry (he's half Indian). I hope you guys enjoy it!
An obnoxiously high-pitched giggle sounded from behind the door frame, announcing Lavender Brown’s arrival. “Ronnie, what’s taking so long?” she whined, “It doesn’t take much time to grab a jacket-” she stopped as soon as she stepped into the room, seeing Harry and Draco entangled on the bed. “Oh!” she squeaked, too loudly for Harry’s taste. Draco shifted, his nose scrunching and his brow furrowing like he detested the noise even as he slept.
“You must be Draco.” Sirius teasingly shoved Harry out of the way and offered the boy his hand, a warm smile on his face. “My son here has told me a lot about you.”
Draco watched as Harry’s lips spread in a soft smile, “Thank you.”
Light from the rising sun filtered through the curtains surrounding Harry’s bed, casting a red-hued haze over Draco’s vision. The smaller boy had been awake for nearly an hour, just listening to the sound of Harry’s breathing and studying the texture of the curtains. They had shifted sometime after Draco had fallen asleep. The pale, bare skin of his back was pressed into the warmth of Harry’s chest, with his boyfriend’s arms enveloping him, keeping him close. Draco had tossed away his shirt sometime in the night, Harry had been more than enough to keep him warm. Their legs had tangled together underneath the worn sheets. With his head tucked under Harry’s chin, Draco curled perfectly against Harry’s body.
To his own credit, Ronald didn’t flinch when he met the fiery, blazing determination in Draco’s eyes. “They were in that corner,” Ronald said, gesturing across the room, where the shadows seemed to be thickest.
thought he imagined it. He gave his boyfriend’s hand a gentle reassuring squeeze.
Pulling away, Narcissa gave him a watery smile. “My son loves you, Harry. So, I hope to see more of you. And get to know you better.” She waited for him to nod his head before leaving, closing the gates behind her and walking to the doors of the manor.
Harry once again picked up the damp cloth and set to cleaning away the rest of the paint on his boyfriend’s embarrassed face, once again feeling grounded and together. Drawing Draco closer, Harry asked him, “Are you ashamed about being a virgin?”
However, the moment that Draco felt Harry’s fingers clench around his shoulder and saw his eyes once again shut tightly, all empathy for Ronald was instantly replaced with worry for his boyfriend.
As a sort of separate note, I hope that you all can find the courage to stand up for yourselves and for your fellow human beings in today's world, especially for pride month and for the BLM protesters trying to change our world. We're doing good work in the face of such adversity, and the world is long overdue for change. Lots of love to everyone out there!
Despite the obvious exasperation in Draco’s voice, Ronald did as he was told, and Draco and Hermione were able to stagger with Harry to and up the staircase. There had been more than one instance in which Hermione almost missed a step, where Draco had stumbled, where Ronald had dropped his flashlight, but they were eventually able to get Harry to his bed.
Harry had thought that once Draco had left, the three of them wouldn’t have bothered to associate with him and Hermione—except for Theo, of course. Instead, they had all huddled in this very room each night that Draco had been gone, watching movies and laughing by the fireplace. The grin on Harry’s face only left when he turned to say something to Draco—only to be reminded that he wasn’t there.
“When Sirius got custody of me,” Harry answered, “he practically dragged me to a therapy appointment twice a week, or whenever he could when I was home from school. Eventually, I realized that they were actually helping me—but it was hard, talking about everything I’d spent years hiding.” He took a deep breath, savoring the feel of a weight lifting off his chest. “The nightmares still get to me sometimes.”
trying.”
field.
“What, um, what did Hermione say?” Draco asked as they started walking. He definitely wasn’t trying to steer the conversation away from blush-inducing topics.
“Oh? When?”
Harry looked back at him, and asked, “Yeah?”
And then Draco’s phone pinged. It was a message from Pansy.
was in.
“Okay.”
“You don’t have a big problem with sneaking out after curfew, do you?” he whispered.
“Oh?” Draco intoned, nipping at Harry’s finger indignantly. He felt a thread of anticipation weave its way through his ribs. He’d had quite the pleasurable time—for the majority—at the last party the Weasley twins had thrown, and he had an inkling that this one would be better. “Well, darling, perhaps I’ll just have to escort you there.”
A warm feeling blossomed in the pit of Harry’s stomach, spreading all the way to his fingertips. “Everything’s… okay. A little bumpy, but we’re okay.” Harry took this moment to look down at Draco. His eyes were downcast, his pink lips were pulled into a small frown, and his pert nose was slightly crinkled. A charged, tense air surrounded him.
Apprehension crept up Harry’s spine. It filled his lungs, stuttering his breathing. His heart skipped a beat and jumped into his throat. His tongue felt like sandpaper in his mouth.
Harry kissed Draco goodnight when they reached the southern common room. The smaller boy was instantly pulled back into the haven that Harry’s arms always created. He felt Harry’s hands gently cupping his face as he kissed him.
“Of course I do, I’m not stupid Ron,” Harry said, a snap to his voice that he rarely used, “but this time is different. He does go here. We both thought it was weird that we hadn’t run into each other before, but he does go here.”
Icy, soft hands suddenly trailed across the skin at Harry’s hips, just at the hem of his shorts. That, combined with the cool breath fanning across his shoulder, made him shiver as goosebumps flowered across his skin. A familiar pair of silky lips pressed a delicate kiss between Harry’s shoulder blades. Both relief and excitement poured in through every pore in his body, flooding his every sense.
(Not that Lucius Malfoy was in any way a large man, neither in height or in girth—but as a child, your father is always the biggest person. He’s always towering over you, looming over your shoulder and intimidating with his presence. Your father is just…
worse.
“No?”
Draco was the first to see him and immediately leaped off the couch. His hands came up to Harry’s face, scanning him for any signs of discontent or uneasiness. Harry leaned into him and whispered, “I’m alright. I’ll tell you everything later, I promise.” Looking over his boyfriend’s head, he saw Hermione staring at him like she was trying to extract the conversation he’d had with Ron from his brain.
“Harry Potter! You and your boyfriend had better be decent within two minutes or so help me I will send someone to go fetch Professor McGonagall! I’m too tired to deal with whatever it is going on in there.”
He couldn’t even find it within himself to laugh. Pansy pulled away and looked at him with concern in her dark eyes. He wished that she could talk to Harry for him. He didn’t want anyone else talking to Harry, at the same time.
Cedric’s grin faltered at Harry’s detached tone, but he quickly brought it back again. His eyes wandered for a moment, giving Harry a languorous once-over. He lingered on Harry’s lips, on the muscles under his brown skin, on his shoulders—which were now broader than his—before looking him in the eyes again.
Harry had said.
The man who had insulted Harry’s people, his friends, his family—perhaps not directly, but any time those words were uttered, it pained them all.
“Are you… Have you talked to anyone else about this?” Draco asked.
Opening his eyes, Draco scanned the corridor for whatever had gotten Harry so excited. There was nothing. He looked up at his boyfriend, eyes narrowed.
“What? What’s wrong, Hermione?” Harry’s mind raced with the possibilities.
“Is he alright?” Draco asked softly, not wanting to wake Harry, “I waited for him outside the locker rooms, but he never came out.” He took a moment to glance at Hermione before continuing, “I just…
Draco’s trail of thoughts disappeared as the laptop hit the bed, as Hermione closed the door behind her. He turned back to face Harry, who was rummaging through the basket and pulled out a container of sandwiches.
Yes, there was no doubt that Draco was perfectly delectable.
“Nope.”
Silence.
Too soon for his taste, Draco ran out of breath and was forced to break the kiss. He looked up at Harry and wished that he could freeze this moment. The other boy’s smile was soft and tender, even as his hands remained on Draco’s skin. He leaned in and rubbed his nose against Draco’s, his smile becoming wider. Giggles burst from the smaller boy’s mouth despite his still heaving breath.
Harry kissed his fingertips as they passed over his lips. He removed his hand from Draco’s hip and intertwined his fingers with those of Draco’s that had been touching his face. He kissed the smaller boy’s white knuckles, a small smile spreading on Draco’s lips.
Pansy’s purple lips fell open. “You’re kidding, right?”
Not a huge deal, but seeing me definitely is.”
“Yes, of course, Father.”
Draco was filled to the brim with anticipation. This would be the first date that
angry at myself—for not seeing it earlier, for being so incredibly stupid and naive, for being so dependent on Cedric and falling apart over him. I sought validation anywhere I could get it, made a lot of stupid mistakes for it.” Running a hand down his face, Harry slightly shook his head. Draco watched as his broad chest moved with a deep breath. “But, through all of that, though, and after, it was
Draco’s mind felt as though he’d left it behind in his common room, still trying to process that there was something
“Hooch let the team have the weekend off?” Draco asked in surprise. He’d half expected to not see Harry until the game with Beauxbatons was over and won. It only contributed to Draco’s dissatisfaction over the entire situation.
Draco hesitated, narrowing his eyes at his mother.
“Ah!” Sirius exclaimed, leaning his chair back like a teenager in a boring classroom. “A kindred spirit! My parents were the exact same way, Draco. My entire family, really. Believe me when I say that I understand how it feels. But,” Sirius stared intently at Draco, who clenched Harry’s hand, “I basically said screw it and did what
“Yes, Harry,” they said in eerie unison, “party.”
“I thought I might find you here,” Draco said. His face was pink, he wasn’t looking Harry in the eye.
“So, after the football game last night,” Draco recounted, taking a deep breath, “Harry asked me out on a date-” Pansy squealed loudly even though she already knew this part, “-and that’s pretty much it. I told him I would love to.”
It was as they were dancing that Draco stretched up to whisper in Harry’s ear, inducing goosebumps and a shivering sigh, “Take me to your room?”
Alright guys, I hope you liked it! I seriously get so excited when I get comments, it's ridiculous, but I love getting feedback and hearing what you think. So, comment, kudos, advice, I love it all! Thanks a ton for reading!
Draco furrowed his brow in concern. Harry sounded dejected, morose. As if someone had kicked his puppy and run away laughing. The sparkle that usually resided in his eyes had gone out, he looked exhausted, his shoulders were slumped and his smile was shaky at best. Draco reached across the table and interlaced his fingers with Harry’s as he said, “Harry, will you tell me what’s wrong?” Draco was certain that his hand fit perfectly in the other boy’s, and he immediately felt the warmth that seemed to constantly surround him.
Stiffly, on both sides, father and son shook hands and exchanged a few rigid words, quietly enough that Harry only heard mumbling. With deliberate steps and an absurd amount of brainpower focused on not falling, Harry walked down the steps to stand about a foot behind his boyfriend, meeting Mrs. Malfoy’s softened eyes before his attention was drawn to Lucius Malfoy.
Draco laughed at his boyfriend’s faux mocking expression, snatching a sandwich before the starved athlete beside him ate them all. Draco opened the laptop and set it between them, the two quickly finding some mindless movie to watch. Draco snuggled in closer to Harry, laying his head on his shoulder and against his neck. He could already feel the contentment spreading in his chest, the warmth seeping through his skin, sleep pressing heavy on his eyelids.
Ron studied him closer, trying to dissect all the different parts of what Harry might have been thinking. “You met someone, didn’t you?” Ron sighed loudly, the way Hermione did before she started a lecture, “Harry, we’ve done this before. If they don’t go to school here, there’s no way that it could work out. Do you not remember-”
Harry exited the shower, threw his clothes on as fast as humanly possible, and made his way to the door. But not before seeing all of his teammates, apparently waiting for him. Harry swallowed past the lump in his throat, shifting his face into what he hoped was a passable smile.
The smile on his lips was surely permanent.
“Just fine, Dray, just fine,” he mumbled, his voice deep and gravelly with sleep. Even if Draco could see right through his boyfriend’s lie, he figured calling him out on it wouldn’t help. Instead, he just rubbed soothing circles into his hand.
—he might have disappeared as soon as he opened his eyes, only to squint in the morning sunlight that filtered through his bed curtains. The fear he’d felt last night, the terror that something horrible had happened—he’d had a feeling that sleep would only torment him once he’d closed his eyes.
“It wouldn’t be the first time you only wanted someone for sex. Ginny was one of those people, wasn’t she?” Ron tilted his head as if he were genuinely asking. Hermione made an outraged sort of squeaking noise, shooting up from the couch she and Harry had been sitting on, adjacent to Ron’s chair.

Harry snickered into his boyfriend’s hair, “Well?”
had happened, like he hadn’t done anything
Just as his stomach paused in its upheaval, there was a knock on the open bathroom door.
Alright guys, this week has been a rough one (and it's only Tuesday). And while I'm aware that I'm updating early, I just kind of felt the need to write and update today. And so, I present to you, chapter five.
Draco cursed, once again opening the door to the northern common room. He hadn’t been gone very long, an hour at best, and yet Ronald Weasley was already making out with Lavender again.
Harry kissed him like he was afraid he would fly away. One of his hands was on his waist, bringing his body closer, the other was in Draco’s hair, gently playing with the strands. Both of Draco’s hands moved to Harry’s shoulders, around his neck, into his hair, trying to press himself as tightly as he could. Harry’s lips were pressing against his own with a delicate kind of ferocity. Harry’s lips left his mouth, traveling across his cheek, stopping to mouth at his jaw. He kissed under his ear, then came back to kiss his lips again. Draco’s mind was full of Harry, his smell, his taste, his warmth, the feel of his surprisingly soft hair, the feeling of his chest against his own. Draco was drowning in him, and he couldn’t think of any other place he’d rather be.

Draco thought.

Draco nodded. His bottom lip was caught between his teeth. “Okay, well, do you want—”
No, the voice was one Draco knew all too well. Professor Snape.
“Really?” Grey eyes widened even further and pink lips parted in what Harry recognized as disbelief.
Draco felt the heat in his face but decided to retaliate. “Of course I am, I’m absolutely mesmerizing in anything I do, Potter.”
“He will be studying to take over your company, yes?” Iris asked Lucius.
It was only natural for Draco to grin back down at him, then slide his hands to the back of his neck, lift his head and kiss him. Passionately, and with absolutely no regard for anyone who could be watching. He could taste the saltiness of Harry’s sweat on his lips, feel the adrenaline running through his body, feel his rapid heartbeat, and the sweet glide of his lips against Draco’s own. There was nothing else but Harry—nothing but the string that connected Draco’s heart to his.
Silence fell over the room.
But Pansy leaned over, and faster than Draco could stop it, snatched his cell. She tapped away and looked up at him after a few seconds of staring at his phone.
He made sure that no one was around when he entered one of the many secret passages he’d found over the years.
“Remus,” Harry greeted with a wide grin on his face, hugging the man after he stood up, “I think your kids have given you a few more grey hairs, mate.”
A throat being cleared in front of Harry made him snap his head up, only to see an annoyed Snape standing in front of his desk. He was looking down his hooked nose at the boy, a venomous glint in his black eyes.
A stroke of apprehension swiftly wrapped around Harry’s heart like a clawed hand, each finger a fear that relentlessly dug into him. He knew, logically, that Sirius and Remus would like his boyfriend, and that Draco, in turn, would get along with them just fine. But the ‘what ifs’ of the situation nonetheless threatened to overpower Harry.
Time seemed to slow. Draco’s limbs all felt like lead even as he pushed them to go faster, to get him to Harry as fast as possible.
“Thursday,” Harry said, quickly removing his hands from the table, “at six o’clock, on the football field.”
The response was almost instantaneous as Harry opened his locker.
to do, to stop him from leaving. It was what it was. For now. At least he left the flashlight.
“All six of us aren’t going to fit in your car, you know,” Draco pointed out.
He’d been the one to convince Harry that therapy was a good idea. Despite Harry’s reluctance to go at first, Sirius had coaxed and encouraged him until, one night, Harry had broken down sobbing in his arms, and finally realized that he
“Does it make me an awful person,” Draco asked, “if I’m already dreading having to see my father?”
“Cedric,” Harry acknowledged, trying his hardest to keep his voice composed, “what can I do for you?”

“She doesn’t hate you,” Harry reassured.
He’d been getting better grades thanks to the help of his boyfriend (
Sirius and Remus had both waited for them next to Harry’s car with pleasant smiles on their faces.
“Yeah... I already knew that, Draco.”
one he wanted to deal with. Once the boy found someone to complain to, they were roped into taking care of him until he felt better. And while Draco loved his friend dearly, he had no intention of leaving this bed to take care of him.
