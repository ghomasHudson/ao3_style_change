He sighed, couldn't they just put trackers on the students so that they know where they are, what they're doing at all times of the day? This would make life so much easier.
What will be the Malfoy's plus one's reactions to the 'Shaming of the Weasley's'?
“I’m sorry Ginny.” Not. “I don’t know you that well and I have no interest in you! Now, please leave me alone!” Get off me bitch!!! She is such a whore. I literally saw her and a Ravenclaw dude sucking each others faces off yesterday and she now has an interest in me?!?!
She kept fingering the necklace during the classes I had with her. She did it when she was nervous or unsure. She. Is. Adorable. I noticed many people asked her about it. Harry (My love) said she was being courted but was very tight lipped after that. I noticed she was getting frustrated with the questions so I decided to distract everyone's attention. It was quite easy really. All I did was ask her who it was from. She said her courter and so I said (quite loudly so everyone heard) "Your courter? Well, good luck Potter. You're very lucky. I am sure everyone wishes to be courted so grandly which is probably why they are trying to suffocate you."
"I'm bisexual actually. Only people who know are me, Hermione and Draco. And now you." Ginny watched as Harry's hand crept around Draco's waist and pull him close to his body, making soothing motions with his thumbs.
"Yes, I know love. But what if I stub my toe or I get a paper cut?" Harry interrupted Draco's rant about how and why Harry will never get hurt again. Draco shrugged his shoulders, jolting Harry from where he was settled. Severus chuckled lightly, "If you ever get hurt again, it can only healed by your soulmates touch or a direct relatives touch. For example, if Draco is unavailable for any reason, Lucius or Narcissa could heal Harry in his place. But Draco, can unfortunately only be healed by Harry and Harry only as we killed his last relatives yesterday."
"How long have you been married?"
"Oh yeah? Prove it." Hermione replied
Neville bared his teeth at Draco. “He isn’t yours Malfoy. He is mine. I saw him first! So I own him!” Draco growled loudly, “no he isn’t longbottom. For two reasons: 1, he has chosen me as you can tell by the fact that he hasn’t moved and he specifically told me not to let go. And 2, you’re scaring him which suggests you’re a poor match for him anyway.”
"My cousin Dudley, is an obese kid who likes to use me as a punching bag. He gets fatter everyday so he has lots of clothes left lying around because his parents buy him new ones. I get the hand me downs. Most of the time, they are too large and fall and sometimes they have stains on" He stopped suddenly. "Who on earth would treat a magical child like this?!" he asked, furious.
"Last night, when I went to the toilet I swore the floor was covered in rose petals... Jesus I have the weirdest dreams."
Draco caught up to him. "I have something to ask you. I was dared and I have to report my findings to my friends."
"Harry, chill. If no one knows, it means he doesn't know." Hermione butted in. "Anyways, what do you want your gay name to be?"
From the front of the classroom Snape spoke, albeit slurringly. (XD That's not even a word. Deal with it)
“Oi! Malfoy. What did you just say to me?” he demanded.
I could care less about the fact I'm in the middle of the corridor with hundreds of eyes on us and I do care less, but I am feeling slightly conscious of the fact I
Pansy hummed, "Hmm I don't know. It would be hilarious if it was Potter-Malfoy."
"Oh merlin no!! He can't replace me with a ferret, then bloody marry him! I won't stand for it!" Ron objected.
Draco felt Harry tenses in his arms and cursed silently. He needed to make sure Harry knew his real intentions. He didn’t want Harry to feel like he was using him, because he wasn’t! There was something he has never told Harry, and he hates how he has to say it now but there really is no better time.
"Har! Get your lazy arse out of bed!" Hermiones voice sliced through my lovely dream about blonde hair and mercury coloured eyes. "Ugh, mione!" I whined. "I was in a nice dream as well." Hermione smirked at me. "Who about? Draco?" She asked with a raised eyebrow, a teasing tone to her words. I blushed furiously. "No!" She giggled, "Sure Har, sure."
"Aw that was so cute!!" I whipped around as fast as I could without falling over from exhaustion and Pansy squealed. "Hermione!!! We were just talking about you!!" Granger just laughed and pecked my best friend on the lips. "I know love. You two are so cute." I pouted. "I'm a Malfoy. Malfoy's are
e. The paperwork on the poor goblins desk flew up in a flutter and swarmed him, suffocating him in the redheads fit of rage.
Wait. Fuck! I just called him Draco. Fuuuuuuuck.
"On the walk over to Gringotts we spoke. I learned how he has been treated, what his friends think of him and who he knows and thinks he can trust. Strangely, although we met like, 20 minutes prior, he felt he could trust me. I mean, he trusted me enough to tell me of his crush on a certain platinum blond haired, grey eyed slytherin..." Fenrir smirked at Harry's discomfort whilst Draco snorted and Harry blushed.
He snarled in the fat man's face and grabbed his cheeks with red-hot hands. Harry's magic had gone haywire and had taken control of Harry's body. It was almost like the magic was punishing Vernon, making him have a taste of his own medicine. There were burn marks all over his face and neck from where Harry's hands had touched him. They had the weirdest shapes too. They weren't hand prints at all, almost like they were grill marks or frying pan shaped...
Ginny shrieked and ran out of the house crying as she went. Harry breathed in deeply a few times to calm himself down. When he felt he was calm enough, he turned around and slipped back into bed and clutched onto Draco. He noticed the blond was shaking and sniffling.
"No way!"
I fell out with my friends and family. I haven't spoken to them since we graduated. That was 12 years ago.
"RON!" Harry shrieked. "He might know!! What if he does know? He'll spread it around! The whole school will know by tomorrow lunchtime!"
Merlin, I feel like I'm about to explode. I need his lips and I need them
His eyes widened. Oh shit, no this means that he won't win the bet with Minerva! It was a girly moan, definitely, meaning Minerva will win. She says Draco will be shagging Granger in secret but Severus thinks it will be Potter. He sighed. Better get this over with.
"You're being a prat. Stop being mean to me." I pouted and played with the end of my hair. Blaise and Pansy just laughed. Bastards.
I woke up by falling onto the floor this morning. It should have hurt and it should have been cold and it should not have been a soft and quiet landing. But it was. And why is that, you may ask. Well, I landed on a bed of rose petals. Pink ones and red ones and the occasional white one too. There were so many petals. They were about twelve inches deep from the floor and I almost suffocated!
"Draco Malfoy!" Draco groaned and thudded his head on the table in mortification.
"I dont know about that... I mean, there is so much chemistry, passion, tension"
"God damn you boys!" McGonagall yelled before handing over the money.
In unison two sets of eyes, one bright green the other dark grey, widened in disbelief and understanding looking at the other before looking away again. "So... what you're saying is that... we're soulmates?" Draco whispered shakily. Tom nodded. "Oh my god." Harry breathed before passing out in Draco's arms.
Also, I personally prefer Harry and Draco with their original names, even when they are in a female role. I think Harrietta or Dracophine sounds so stupid and so I will use their names like normal.
I grinned at him before looking at my old best friend.
“Malfoys are not cute or adorable potter!”
Harry goes to pour them orange juice but when he walked round to Vernon, Dudley, stuck his leg out causing Harry to trip and spill the orange juice all over his Uncle. Vernon is furious. He tells his wife and son to leave, ‘Go take him to get new clothes dear, treat him for being such a good son.’ Once they left, Vernon removes his belt. ‘Lie down, on the floor freak.’ Harry lies in the spilt orange juice and removes his shirt. This has happened enough times that he knows what to do. Suddenly, a slash of the belt hits him on his back making him jerk. Another happens just on his spine causing him to cry out. ‘Like that Freak? You deserve this. If I had just left you in an orphanage this would have never happened.’ Slashes of the belt caused Harry to cry out this time. ‘Shut up Boy, or this will get worse.’ Vernon growls. But Harry can’t help it, the next hit makes Harry scream and Vernon decides to punish the boy more. Fetching a knife from the counter, he starts slicing all over Harry’s body, marking it, scarring it. He laughs manically, enjoying watching his nephew squirm and writhe under him. He holds Harry still, and starts to carve words into Harry’s skin. FREAK, MURDERER and WORTHLESS are the words that Harry will now carry around him forever. The obese Whale relish’s the small boys screams. Vernon starts on another word, WHORE, but he doesn’t get to finish it as Harry has had enough. With some accidental magic, he blasts Vernon backwards before chanting, ‘Take me where I will be safe’. The last thing he sees is Vernon fuming, red as blood and spitting obscenities when it all goes black.
Tuesdays. Not so bad as mondays but still bad. At least I didn't fall out of bed this morning again. That's always a bonus.
Yes, we are most definitely not hiding anymore .
draco and harry were partners in potions class and about half way through started calling out their own last names at each other in potions class and everyone is confused when ron asks what they were doing and harry simply says arguing about who gets who's last name before going back to arguing realising ten seconds later that he had just outed draco and himself.
“Leave him alone weasel.” Draco said with a sneer. “Don’t tell me what to do snake. How about you leave him alone you slimy git!?” Ron retorted. “No, no don’t. Please love, do not let me go. I only want to be with you.” I shoved my face into his neck and he started gently stroking my hair again. Around us the Gryffindor’s gasped in horror. Cries of “you’ve poisoned harry!” and “the slimy slytherin has used his power to control harry!” were heard from the crowd.
No. I did not squeal. I'm a Malfoy. We do no such things.
“Pleased to meet you Harry!” She winks at me and flounces off.
The dog barked once and smashed his snout into the wall. Draco peered at the name. "Colin Creevey." He looked at the dog. "Good name, you." He said, patting its head. The dogs tail wagged and it stood up, starting the walk. Draco sighed, imagining Colin Creevey's future if he were alive.
"To confess." Harry whispered so quietly that Draco barely heard him. Draco raised an eyebrow.
He decided not to tell Potter that he moaned like a girl, that would just be cruel.
. Could we not do something more fun?"
"WHAT THE FUCK POTTER!!"
You could hear ‘Dray’ sigh. “I know love, I know. But think about it this way, it won’t be long before you can put those good for nothing Weasels in Azkaban.”
Harry nods furiously. "Okay, I believe you."
"Okay, Tom. Please. He helped me. Please don't punish him or anything. He was doing what any decent person would do!" Tom didn't say anything, acting as if he hadn't heard Harry. Fenrir swallowed in fear, back stiff with anticipation.
"Did you hear??"
Malfoy smirks at me evilly with a dangerous gleam in his eye. A shiver racks my whole body. I have to tell myself the smirk is NOT hot. But fuck it is!
surname and we can fuck with people in public. I mean, listen to this -"
I managed to buy all the present I wanted to buy for Harry. There are seven presents. One for each day starting from Monday and two to give to her when I ask her out. Hopefully she says yes.
He watched as Harry shakily stood up before collapsing again. Immediately Draco was by his side checking him over.
He slowly and softly placed them on his face, gently stroking his cheek with a thumb. ‘Hi Harry. How are you feeling?’ he looks him straight in the eyes that had captured his attention all those years ago. ‘Please don’t lie to me. I just want to help you.’
Today however was one of the worst days. As Lupin was a professor this year, he had to make him the Wolfsbane potion but it went wrong this morning because his stasis charm wore off. Then he had Slytherin and Gryffindor to teach potions to first thing this morning and Malfoy and Potter were extra loud today. Honestly! Couldn't they just shag each other already?!?! Then Longbottom and Finnegan blew up their potion. BUMBLING IDIOTS.
He took a breath before continuing. “I know his little quirks; he bites his lip in concentration, his eyebrow twitches silently when annoyed, he chews something when he is nervous and he cards a hand through his hair when stressed. I know how he likes to cuddle – the little spoon and I know what he likes to do in the morning when he wakes up. He has two routines – one when he wakes in my arms and one when he wakes up on his own. I won’t go into detail about them because it sounds creepy how I know them so well. I know how he likes to shower with a vanilla shampoo and shower gel. I know his sweet spots, his tickle spots. I know a goddamn lot of things about my boyfriend, Weasley, so piss off before I shove a broom up your arse.”
Harry giggled again, "Well, to be honest I wouldn't mind it if you did kiss me again..." he said cheekily as Draco fake gasped.
"You do not know how long I have waited for you to say that." He said in a tone just as quiet before leaning in and showing Harry really just how long he had been waiting for.
- If Freak talks back 3 times, 25 lashes and burns from fire
Pansy flinched. "I'm sorry Draco." He glared before loosening up a bit and smiling widely at her. "What do you think he wants as his gay name anyway?!"
What wins out in the end?
It means I can't go home for many months.
“Yes you do. Here let me tell you what to do correctly. There are 4 steps, okay?” she nods her head, intrigued. “First, you offer friendship, nicely. Once that step is complete, you make sure he has your attention on him at all times. Pester him till you do – you’re doing that step already but you are doing it incorrectly. It needs to be subtle – NO TOUCHING.” He smirks at me before looking back towards Ginny.
"Uhh, I can explain!" He managed to get out whilst he had a 16 year old cutting off his oxygen. Harry laughed happily and then pulled back giving Fenrir enough space to breathe again. "Dont worry Fenny. Its okay." He reassured. "You know those muggles I told you about? I asked Severus for help and they saved me! Although that wasn't what I asked for but I'm not complaining."
It means I have to be so secretive.
“Harry what the fuck?!” Ron shouted at me. I flinched and huddled into Draco more. He stopped stroking me and instead clutched me closer whilst glaring at my best friend.
"Alright! Fine. I'll help you." Gosh, Pansy is such a toad in the morning. So grumpy. So grouchy. She needs multiple mugs of coffee I reckon. "YES!" I yelled, punching the air with my fist. I watched as Pansy stumbled out of bed and plodded towards my wardrobe.
"Owl? What owl?" "The one I sent yesterday afternoon."
"Alright, school tomorrow. I want you boys to pack your trunks tonight, before dinner so you can spend some bonding time with our guests."
I glare at him as he raises his eyebrow at me.
"Avis!"
: WATCHING US MAKE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT HALL
Draco sighed. "Yes, I believe, we may have been... set up."
"MINERVA! YOU OWE ME 40 GALLEONS!!!!" He yelled as he strode into the hall.
I live with my gorgeous spouse in Hogsmeade. No one knows who we are as we hide. We aren't ready for the world to know. We just want peace.
Who froze the vaults sending in the money huh??
"You're rivals! What common ground do you two have that we don't?"
: HARRY JAMES POTTER
I take a chance and I mouth the next bit: please help me, I beg you. However, the cold hearted bastard just smirks at me.
He saw Draco's shining eyes look back at him before he closed them and pushed his tongue hesitantly into Harry's mouth. Harry whined when he felt the Slytherins tongue swipe around his mouth, his own tongue dancing with Draco's.
Ron glared and spat at them before he lumbered off. The students around them were gaping; some with jaws on the floor, others squealing from cuteness overload.
His lovely, sweet, caring and straight girlfriend was fucking around with the oppositions teams. In the changing rooms she was named The Whore.
In public.
"You always were one for dramatic entrances weren't you?" Harry sighed exasperatedly before flashing a quick grin at Draco. Draco spluttered. He opened and closed his mouth a few times before snapping it shut and choosing to glower at Harry instead of insulting him. "Watcha need Malfoy?" Harry asked politely. "Um... do you have any dark coloured Dhalias and light coloured Daffodils?" Draco asked.
Warming charms!!! Once again, I am an idiot.
He turned around, “What Malfoy.” He spat.
"Enough bitch." Draco interrupted, furious with the girls audacity to actually apologise. "You broke his heart, and left someone to pick up the pieces. He was lucky I was around otherwise I suspect someone else may have done the same as you: fix him partially and then shatter him further. I am fixing Harry's heart, and I wont leave, even when it has finished healing. I will be there forever. I swear." Draco hissed the last words at the ginger haired girl.
Malfoy had come into his inheritance as an alpha, and a fucking powerful one too. This led to rumours spreading that if Omegas existed; he would be an Alpha powerful enough to have one. Malfoy did not taunt us that much anymore, it was crueller teasing. We all believe he is just concentrating on finding his mate (although they do not exist) to bother with annoying us.
"Your right, Draco can't do magic outside of school. However, there are 4 adults who can." Tom said before stepping between Vernon and Harry. Draco looked over at Harry. He was just sat there on the floor gaping at Tom.
LOVE YOU ALLLLLLL
news that her account was empty and that all the accounts sending in money were frozen... she lost it
"Bout bloody time!" Blaise said smiling from ear to ear.
Harry gasped and his eyes lit up. "Oh my god Ron you have the best ideas!" he ran back out shouting "Dray! Dray I have a better idea!"
"10 points to Matter! No, Palfoy! No no no that's not it. DRARRY! 10 POINTS TO THE MALFOY POTTER COUPLE!!" Yeah, Snape was definitely wasted.
I smirk at him. He is flustered.
"HARRY SHUT UP!"
A silver dragon erupts from my wand, a reminder of what I want and yet cannot have.
He squeaked and turned around but ran into Harry. They fell in a tangle of limbs onto the cold stone.
As he walked past the memorial and chose a name, it had turned a corner and saw him. It had stuck by his side since. Whenever someone sneered at him, the dog would growl low in its throat, threatening them. Most people knew about Sirius Black and assumed this was him. They all knew he died though, maybe this was his ghost protecting fellow Azkabaners?
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Care to tell me?"
Once Harry had finished in the shower and dressed in some of Draco's clothes, they headed downstairs to get some food. The adults were already seated at the table waiting for the teenagers to arrive before they started the meal. When they boys walked in side by side, Lucius started snickering quietly while Narcissa held an amused smirk on her face.
The movement brought a delicious moan from Draco and Harry bit his Adam's apple sharply as another moan bubbled to the surface. Harry laved his tongue over Draco's neck, sucking, licking and biting, adamant to leave a mark. The blond withered beneath him and burrowed his fingers deep into Harry's hair causing him to lift his head from his soulmates thoroughly bruised neck and moan loud, punctuating his pleasure with a desperate, hard roll of his hips.
He smirks at me when he sees my reaction to him growling. His eyes were twinkling dangerously and he looked like he wanted to eat me.
"Malfoy?!"
Fifth year, my Princess warned me, helped save me when I couldn't save myself and in return, I saved them from their nightmares.
Draco put Harry back down onto the floor carefully and looked him in the eye. When he spoke his voice was much lower than before making Harry shiver.
"Probably die." Pansy drawled. I smacked her arm. "Hey! What was that for?"
Draco sighed in fake exasperation. “But harry loveeeeeee. I want to make sure you’re okay!!! I’ll carry you?”
I dragged Hermione out of the room, down the stairs and into the Great Hall for a quick breakfast.
I thought so.
"Food?" Tom asked. "Of course, dear guest. Where are my manners?" Lucius said and clapped his hands twice. Food appeared on the table making Harry gasp in delight. There were foods like roast duck in a sauce that goes with it (A/N – it is obvious I don't know what I'm saying? XD) with a load of vegetables surrounding. On another platter sat a variation of salads that looked very enticing. There were multiple breads and cheese lying around too, making Harry's mouth water.
"How long have you guys been there?" Harry demanded. "We have been here the whole time Harry. You woke us up by the way." Tom replied an amused smile playing on his lips. Draco's giggles got louder and Harry glared harder. "What's so funny ferret?" he sneered. Draco could not contain it; he snorted so loud and fell off his chair laughing his head off trying to speak but failing every time he tried. Gasping for breath, he finally calmed enough to speak, "I'm sorry Harry, it was just your face and yo-your scream and it was so funny and I cant stop laughing. I am sorry! Honest!" He broke into another fit of giggles again. "It looked like you were about to piss yourself!!"
- If Freak makes his presence known when we have visitors 4 times, 50 lashes and no food for 4 days
Don't tell him that. He'll braid my hair for months as punishment.
"I do read Mione'!!"
"Wait. My room?" Harry interrupted Draco with disbelief in his voice.
Sirius hummed and then giggled. He turned to Remus with a smile on his face. "Remember when we were like that at age 15? Literally couldn't keep our hands off each other once we had sex." Remus flushed before punching his mate in the shoulder. Harry's face was pinched in a way that signified disgust. "Ew, Siri I did not need to know that." Draco snorted before steering Harry into the shop.
Oh shit, does Draco like me back?!?! Or, is he taking the piss? I sigh. Probably the latter.
Hermione gasped and her hands flew up to her mouth. "Oh my gosh Harry! We need to find you a cute outfit! As it is still snowing slightly, wear something warm and cute yes?" I nodded, thankful for the help.
the time now.
"Dunno. Haven't opened it yet." I shrugged and then grabbed my school uniform to get changed. When I got back from the bathroom, he6rmione was already changed and poking and prodding the box with her wand. "Anything gonna attack me mione?"
Harry sighed. "Look up."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Boys, I just want to know... Are either of you trapped in some way?" the professor asked curiously. The boys both looked at him, lifting their head slowly before giving a short nod and looking away again. "Mr Potter, can you tell me why you're trapped please?"
His platinum blond hair was shining in the moonlight coming from the window. It was so bright and Harry wondered how he missed it. He slunk over as quietly as possible, trying not to wake him up, as he didn't want to confess to Draco. When he reached Draco, he was nervous and his hands felt all clammy and sticky. He was about to lean down and peck his lips when Draco mumbled and moved ever so slightly. Harry froze.
Ginny catches Harry and Draco in their bed and Ginny calls Draco a Death Eater. Harry defends Draco and its bye-bye Ginny.
"My poor Harry." Draco mumbled into the ravens hair. He stroked the back of his head in soothing motions knowing that this was a difficult topic for his soulmate. Harry smiled sadly before continuing. "Did you read my chart? The punishment one?" Everyone nodded. "If I do one thing wrong, I get a specific punishment for it. Depending on the situation depends on the severity of the punishment. Dudley, my cousin, was a bully. Not just in the house but outside too. He was the reason I didnt have any friends. Yet another plan from Dumbledore. Since my parents died my life has been controlled. Its tiring." Harry sighed.
"Yes, I do." Said Lucius as he stood up and left the room. He came back a few moments later with a dish of water floating before him. It rested on top of the coffee table beside Harry's and Draco's half finished desserts. Draco cleared them off and a house elf took them away. Slowly, Harry extracted the needed memories and dropped them into the pensive. This process was silent, no words were spoken by anyone; they were all waiting in anticipation.
his smirk. He trailed a line of hot, searing kisses along my jaw, teasing me into making short sharp gasps until he reached my mouth. He was a hairs-breadth away from my lips, breathing on my lips as his eyes bored into my wide eyes. I think I whimpered... but I'm not too sure. He looks quite smug so if I did, he definitely heard it.
Ron POV •
Hermione's flag was a deep maroon with the words Hermione Granger – Walking dictionary – Awesome Girlfriend to Ronald in a gold thread. Her boyfriends was a bright orange to show his love for the Chudley Cannons and had his words in a black thread. Ron(ald) Weasley – Weasley is Our King – Awesome Boyfriend to Food (oh and the Bookworm). Lets just say... Hermione didn't approve of his flag. Neville's flag had the words Neville Longbottom – Snake Exterminator – Secretly a Hufflepuff in black on a bright blue background.
I heard a snort from behind me and I whipped around
He took in my shocked appearance and chuckled warmly. Potter walked forward a few steps so he was in front of me.
Harry's contagious laughter and smile could be heard and seen down the hallway. A/N Cute right?
A/N : I dont know what this is, but I like it. It's kinda cute. X
‘When suddenly I realised Pansy and Blaise were right. And I started crying. In front of them as well and they were so shocked. The Slytherin Prince, crying? Was the world ending? As I said earlier, only my family could make me cry, and you. And I told them. I was sobbing my heart out as I told them I did love you, I did have a crush on you.’ He chuckled remembering their reactions. ‘Pansy squealed and kept jumping up and down, clapping her hands whilst Blaise just stood there gaping. ‘I was just joking!’ were his exact words.’
Harry groaned. "Its Padfoot and Moony isn't it?" Lucius smiled, "Maybe..." Draco shot up from his comfy position. "Haz! We can play dress up!" Harry's eyebrow curled. "Aren't we a bit too old for 'dress up'?" Draco smirked his signature Malfoy smirk. The one he knew got Harry all hot and bothered. "Not to play my dress up."
Hermione squealed. Ron gagged (IN JEST!!!) "Harry that is sooooo cute!! I need to go to the library, I have something to do." And she was off.
"Anyways! We need to have a serious chat, boys." Tom pulled everyone back on track. "Okay, so we know that you can only find your soulmate if one is in unbelievable amounts of pain and the other is in the same room right? The fact that you two have found each other, and so young I might add, is astounding yet sad. The amount of pain Harry was in makes me want to kill those muggles all over again. But, I am happy for both of you. Finding your soulmate is rare, finding them and living together is even rarer."
need some.
"I wish to discuss what I found in person, if that's okay. I have put too much in my letter and if someone were to intercept they would most likely go to Dumbledore. I have one more thing to tell you before I wrap up, though. Going back to my 'wellbeing' and my treatment worse than a house elf I wish to inform you of one more thing. If you couldn't tell by now, I am abused. They call me Freak and Boy. I don't know my real name till my Hogwarts letter. But it isn't just verbal. The physical abuse is serious. I will send a copy of my 'punishment chart' and the 'punishments' I have before I return. I don't think I will be able to get to Hogwarts in time and I suspect I will be unconscious for a day or two. Could you create a portkey for me? Please? It could just ditch me into the Infirmary at school so Poppy can treat me. If it is alright with you, of course, could you make it so that it activates itself after 2 days or something? It would be much appreciated if you can conform with my request.
"Feel better for that Princess?"
Meanwhile, Harry was gaping at his friend. He would have left his Lord to follow him instead!?
I hope so.
I untied the ribbons before sliding them off. Dropping them down onto my bed I slowly peeled off the lid to the box. Moving the tissue paper to the side I gasped when I saw what was inside.
"Hermione! Look at her shirt!"
Fuck off puny human.
Then I saw Hermiones spare bags enchanted with an undetectable expansion charm. I grabbed one and started shoving petals into it. Hopefully she wont mind.
"You read Terry Pratchett?!?!" Draco interrupted Hermione's response to Harry's 'claim'.
The plan was mapped out over tea and coffee at about 9:30 on a Thursday night. It was decided that Harry would send an owl saying they were breaking up and that he never wanted to see her again.
{Harry James Potter - thinking of changing her name to Harry James-Lily Potter or Harry James Potter-Lily.}
Once harry saw him standing there with about 2 metres of space around him, singling him out, he burst into tears at seeing the broken boy. He lunged forward and wrapped him up in a hug, ignoring the flinch from the older boy. He sobbed into his hair pressing him close to his body whilst Draco snuggled into his neck and wrapped his arms around his chest. Draco sighed into Harry's collarbone and let a few of his own tears go.
Harry smiled at his best mate. "You're not angry?" He whispered to Ron.
"How was your shower boys?" Severus asked with a blank face, eyes twinkling with amusement. "I think you'll find there were two showers, thank you very much." Harry sniffed and turned his nose up. Lucius barked out another laugh, "You got so dirty you had to shower again?! Really boys!"
"Alright boys, I am outing you to the school so be prepared for the jealous looks!" Snape said whilst looking Harry and Draco in their eyes, revelling in their horror stricken looks.
"Well, how else am I supposed to show how much I missed you?" He smirks at me and starts to drag me out of the hall, grinning wickedly at all the shocked, blushing and smirking faces in the room.
Not gonna lie, I am confused where this is coming from but it is kinda hot though.
The last observations he made, was when he managed to push through the crowd into the burning building. Vernon's body lay mangled on the floor in the hallway. Well, Albus thought, that explains the blood. As he walked further into the house, he could smell burning flesh. As he turned left in the kitchen, he saw two bodies hung by the fire place burnt to a crisp in the middle of the raging inferno. The heat was most intense here and Albus thought he should probably go before his beautiful beard singed off. It took him 50 years to get it that long!
Harry gulped. "I-I like you. Like more than a friend. I mean, I don't even know if we even are friends but I want us to be well more than friends and my friends, the bastards, pressured me to tell you 'cos they were apparently sick of me pining after you and so here I am telling you that I like you very much and its okay if you don't like me back but when you reject me please do it kindly 'cos I have like you since 3rd year and this will be hard to get over but I think I may actually love you and-"
I swallow loudly. My gulp sounded loud in the pupil filled yet silent corridor as he nuzzled his nose under my ear. I am sure my whole body is boiling hot, bright red and my heart is running laps around the Quidditch pitch. "What do you say? You wanna make bracelets? Something more than just-friendship bracelets?" DAMN HE KEEPS WHISPERING! I'M HAVING A MENTAL BREAKDOWN.
I pull away, frowning at him.
"Mine says Draco Malfoy - Gay as fuck – Anti Social as fuck." Harry chuckled deep in his chest; the rumbles moving to Draco's chest filled him with a warmth he had not felt since the end of 5th year. "Cute." Was all Harry said before turning around in Draco's arms. Their faces were right up close and they could feel the others breath ghosting over their lips. Harry unconsciously licked his lips, Draco's eyes tracking the movement as the pink muscle disappeared back into Harry's mouth.
"What was that?" Draco said.
Draco stiffened beside him. "Who?" He asked resignedly.
As he trudged up the stairs, he noticed there was a layer of dust, like ground stone on the stairs. He scuffed it as he walked up and could see worn stone underneath. He had never noticed the dust before. Why? He put these thoughts to the back of his mind when he reached the wooden door that stood in front of him proudly. The raven-haired boy did not bother knocking. Why should he respect the Headmasters privacy when he did not respect his?
Yet, no one thinks about the other side of a patronus…
Harry nodded before handing it over. Draco pulled his own one out and compared the too. They were practically identical apart from his note at the bottom.
Draco,
‘Draco?’ a timid voice broke through his thoughts. Draco saw shy, entrancing green eyes look at him over the top of his arm. Draco hummed to tell harry to carry on. ‘What did you mean it was Pansy and Blaise who made you realise you loved me?’ He blushed as he spoke getting quieter towards the end.

The hall was silent by now everyone waiting to see what would happen next. Hermione gasped again. “Oh Harry. You have just come into your inheritance right? Malfoy here is an alpha but it confuses me as to why he is so interested in you. You are clearly an alpha too. You’re a powerful one though, just like him.” She inhales sharply. “Harry! This explains your magical outbursts! You couldn’t control your power at the time but now you’re fully changed, you can!” I gaped at her, then Draco.
"Draco! Why are you crying?" Harry asked frantically. "You kicked her out for me. You chose me over her. You defended me. Why? She was right! I am a Death Eater!" He sobbed into his hands.
"You..." Harry whispered so quiet Draco almost didnt hear him. Draco grabbed his chin with soft fingers and pulled his face up to meet his own.
"I hope you understand that if I could, I would not put you with these muggles. However, it is for the greater good. I am truly sorry. I know of your... dislike shall we say, for your family, but they are family. Your only family left. Please do try get along with them; it is for your own good as well." He says with sorrow clouding his eyes. Harry scoffs internally. He wants to argue but if he does, he shows his hand too early. Instead, he nods his head once, sharply, before standing up swiftly. "Is that all?" he asks in a hard cold voice. Albus looks taken aback at his tone but merely smiles and waves goodbye. Harry turns on his heel and exits the room brooding over the audacity Albus has to leave him with those Muggles.
Harry giggles quietly, trying to muffle his amusement but failed. Ron still heard him.
“I love you too Dray.”
Hermione breathed a sigh if relief. "For a minute there I thought I would have to punch you for abandoning your friend when he needed the support the most, but you finished and I don't have to."
The adults see, smirk, and coo knowing Draco is in love and that the love is returned.
Harry blushed and said something inaudible.
~~~~~
I sighed. Merlin, all I want is a break from these lunatics I have somehow surrounded myself with. I am exhausted. Leave me alone!!
"Was that your first kiss boys?" Hermione asked knowingly.
"I don't know mate, that is a strange question for him to ask." Ron was trying and failing to console Harry.
expect a 25% discount at the end on the bill."
The bodies in the bed shuffled even closer whilst they slept. Although she should be mad, Ginny found it quite cute. However, she wanted to know who the girl was that had captured Harry's attention. He was madly in love with her, so why did he fuck this girl?
"He was stuck! He was trying to put his shirt on but like the idiot he is got stuck and asked for help!" Harry defended.
Meanwhile in Draco’s head…
Harry,
Severus removed his Notice Me Not Spell and started clapping excitedly. He was grinning from ear to ear which was scaring everyone but Tom. Tom hadn't seen his husband smile this blindingly for years. Once everyone saw Severus clapping some joined in.
I hate kids. I hope My
This could only be one person:
I hope this doesn't deter any of you my lovely readers, but I thought I should probably give you a heads up.
If you could not tell by now, I am trying to court you. At the end of the week I will send a note to you asking to meet up.
He turns around and stalks off towards the bathroom, and I follow cos how can I not when that gorgeous ass has a chance at being mine?!
Malfoy tapped Harry on the shoulder and pointed to me, stopping Harry from rambling as to why Harry... keeps his surname - What???
A whisper.
"A horcrux is an object formed by dark magic that is used by a witch or wizard. It splits the witch or wizards soul in half, making them immortal so long as the soul piece is not destroyed." Draco replied shakily. "Are you?... No, please tell me the Dark Lord didn't create them?!" Draco was starting to go into hysterics, panicking and crying as the burden Harry had on his shoulders crashed down onto him.
"KISS KISS KISS KISS KISS!"
"Why?" Draco asked.
They were definitely naked but the funny thing was, the blond girl didnt have breasts... this was a guy!?!?! She peered at his face.
The bed he slept in was situated underneath the window, meaning he could have a lovely breeze wash over him as he slept. His bedding was a plain white linen but it had dragon outlines that trailed across the cloth. They moved and breathed fire and the flames they produced acted as heating charms for when he got too cold. Draco often found himself talking to them about his day and a voice in the back of his head would always tell him 'Malfoy's don't talk to their bedding' but he didn't give two flying fucks. He wasn't a Malfoy for all he cared.
"Hello Draco." Her voice is angelic.
REQUEST FROM WATTPAD AGAIN! :)
I nod and burrow my face into his neck. He laughs and my cheeks heat slightly as I feel the vibrations of his chuckle emanate from his chest.
"I offered to stay with Harry while he discovered the truths about this world and he accepted. Turns out, I was needed. I had to explain many things that the goblins had because Harry was confused by their wording." Fenrir looked back towards his Lord. "I'm sorry my Lord, for disobeying your order, but I had to help him. No child, magical or muggle should have to go through what he has been through. I hope you understand. If you dont, I will leave if you so wish..." Fenrir trailed off sadly, head hung down in shame. Harry looked on in surprise and glanced at Tom, pleading with his eyes to let him be.
And a shop.
However, when the goblin told her the sad,
Harry grinned at him before pulling Draco onto his lap and holding him close. "You idiot," he said. "Why didn't you bring your bloody coat? Or your hat, scarf and gloves?"
Narcissa watched in horror as Harry's magic controlled his body. She watched as the furious boy left red welts and burn marks on his skin and made his blood boil. She watched as her only son threw himself at Harry and tackled him to the ground. She watched as Draco miraculously managed to calm down the enraged boy, not even being hurt by how hot the boy was. She watched as a bright light shone from both of them as they clung to each other. She watched as two halves of a soul joined.
“Aww is the great, cold hearted Draco Malfoy blushing?” I tease
After harry had calmed down and wasn't sobbing as hard anymore he pulled back and looked at Draco who had suspiciously gone still. Draco had fallen asleep in Harry's arms with tear tracks running down his face and a soft smile, and Harry melted. He smiled softly at the boy and picked him up bridal style before carrying him up to the school.
Knowing you Professor, you are probably confused as to why I called my 'best friend' by his surname. I discovered something very interesting before the holidays. I am not sure if you are aware of where the Weasels and muggleborns loyalties lie, but know for sure that they aren't with me. They never were. They lie with fame, money and Dumbledore. I know you are a spy, and I'm pretty sure it is for Riddle not Dumbledore. How on earth did you manage to convince the old coot you were on his side? I congratulate you; it must have been challenging.
Draco looked up. He groaned and slumped back down onto Harry. Harry oomphed as the weight resettled onto him.
"Yes, owl would be preferable if you dont mind." Harry answered sheepishly.
Draco smirked and raised an eyebrow. “Oh would you look at that? The Weasel finally bites back.
the attention seeker. She also wore a tight fitting grey t-shirt that showed off her curves. I was not interested in those. They are too...
It was a short flimsy thing. Black and pleated, it barely covered her arse and many people were gawking at it. I rolled my eyes. In addition, she calls
My best friend threw me my clothes for today. Today was the first Hogsmeade weekend where it was snowy and I can't want till I get to smash Ron in a snow ball fight. Hermione calls us children (we are 14, but still) and rolls her eyes before going back to her reading. I'm hoping I may be able to tempt her into a snow war today.
I rise from my musings to knock on my bosses door.
3 hours later, 3 people walked out the shop laden with hundreds of bags full of clothes for one person. There were about a hundred more shrunk in their pockets. They trudged over to the nearest cafe to wait for the rest of their group to come finish.
He falls asleep but has a horrible nightmare. He screams and thrashes around in his sleep kicking Draco and crying out.
"WILL YOU TWO CUT IT OUT ALREADY? I'm sick of hearing you yell you're surnames at each other. Why are you yelling your surnames anyway?" I screamed, effectively halting any conversation.
"Oh Harry, why on earth didn't you tell me all of this sooner? I could have prevented the war from turning out like I did! You should have told me in 3rd year you git. I love you too! And now your in my arms, you're not leaving. Ever."
Albus Dumbledore
woozy. Maybe I'm hallucinating? That explains why Harry is shouting Potter at Malfoy and Malfoy shouting his own surname at Harry. Weirdos.
After the War, he shot up. Now he was taller than I was and
I gaped at him. Harry. James. Potter. Saviour of the Wizarding world. Saint Potter. The Chosen One. Boy Who Lived (to be a pain in my ass).
- If 3 chores are incomplete, 20 lashes from the belt and a beating from Dudley
...I am still 15.
SLAP!
Harry is sick of it. He just survived his worst year yet - and that is saying something. First year he had a murder/Dark Lord after him and in second year a Basilisk was let lose upon the castle. Third year he had another murderer after him who really just wanted to have custody of him but it did not seem like it at the time. One of his teachers was a werewolf too. However, last year, in his opinion it was the most traumatizing year yet. Fighting a dragon, saving your 'rival' from mermaids and then watching a nice guy be killed in cold blood would do that to you. Oh and to top it all off, the Dark Lord, Voldemort, moldy shorts, moldy voldy whatever the hell you wanna call him was resurrected and then promptly tried to kill him. Ah, life is great.
"Draco Malfoy is in love with Harry Potter!"
Oh yeah, Minerva thought I would be a great teacher. I guess I am, but the part I hate is all the questions. They're the same every year.
"Harry!!" Draco cried before shaking the raven haired shoulders frantically. A panicking Draco is not a very smart Draco. His mother thrust a wand under his nose and told him to calm down. "Panicking wont help him Draco." The boy nodded, took a deep breath to compose himself and then he grabbed his wand before shouting "Aguamenti!". A stream of water trickled onto Harry's face making him splutter as he breathed in and opened his eyes.
Then my world came crashing down and I gasped. I staggered backwards. I felt like a bucket of ice water just dumped itself on my head.
Harry hesitated. "Sure." His voice cracked and he looked as if he was about to cry. "When my parents died, I was left with my aunt and uncle. They, they abuse me physically and mentally. I'm starved and beaten, raped and treated like a house elf." The class was in shock. The Golden Boy was abused? It was unheard of!
Everyone then left her alone. She looked quite shocked really. I winked at her before I left making her blush deliciously. I cant wait till the weekend.
The break before 8th year had done Potter good. Although Draco himself was skinny and pale, Potter had grown, now to be taller than Draco. He must've been working out over the break as he was ripped which always made Draco's brain swirl into fantasies that could never happen. It didn't matter if they were friends now, Potter had the Weaslette. After the war, Potter got rid of his glasses and replaced them with muggle contacts. Now it meant that whenever they made eye contact, his green piercing eyes looked into Draco's soul. Draco found it scary but hot at the same time.
“But Harry pettttttttttttt!!! Pwease!” she bats her eyelashes in what I believe she thought was a seductive way.
Clopsy popped back in to the living room and passed out the drinks. "Clopsy, could you please go and fetch Harry and Draco?" "Of course Mistress-"
Draco's bed had a velvet green throw on top of a white bedding. Hiding on the bedding, emerald green dragons flew around at the sight of Harry and blew small flames. Harry giggled and walked over slowly, stroking the dragon's scales. They purred beneath his touch and rolled onto their backs. Harry laughed and gazed around the rest of the room. There was a walk in wardrobe to one side, an extra door, for what Harry suspected was a bathroom, a huge bay window overlooking the Manor's gardens and there were shelves full of books. There were so many books that the shelves were bending under the weight and some were lying on the floor in stacks.
I scrambled to get dressed in a cute outfit. I emptied my wardrobe and stood at the end of my bed in despair. What am I going to wear?
A/N... um... so... it may get a bit hot where you are... PLEASE DON'T JUDGE ME. FIRST TIME WRITING SMUTTY TYPE SHIT.
"Fuck you." Draco groaned, he had walked right into that one.
The class looked at each other warily until Hermione sighed exasperatedly. "Avis!" Toucans erupted into the air making her smile brightly. "Well done Miss Granger! 5 points!" Professor Flitwick congratulated her. "Come on class! Don't be scared!"
"Anyway, enough about Weasley. Tell me your favourites books and chapters...." Draco dragged Harry off to compare their thoughts.
Slytherin, grey eyes, my whole house just growled at him, male and, now I actually look, striking platinum blond hair.
Nothing happened.
My cousin Dudley, is an obese kid who likes to use me as a punching bag. He gets fatter everyday so he has lots of clothes left lying around because his parents buy him new ones. I get the hand me downs. Most of the time, they are too large and fall and sometimes they have stains on – what they are I do not know and do not ever wish to find out. For the first 10 years of my life, I didn't have a bedroom. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs – I kid you not. It was always dark and cold. There were spiders and the occasional cockroach. Being a lonely young boy, naturally I made friends with them. I haven't ever had friends when I was younger, so when I came to Hogwarts and Draco insulted Weasley I decided I didn't want to get to know him. I regret that now but I do not know how to bring it up with him. Do you have any suggestions? I just wish to mend bridges I should've crossed years ago.
“Are you sure you’re a Malfoy then?” I smirk at him.
Draco and Harry bloody Potter were in a compromising position against the wall of the broom closet. Severus smiled, Draco was so top in their relationship. If you couldn't tell, he was inside Potter so it was kinda obvious.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes! Its amazing! My favourite character is Commander Vimes, and my favourite couple are Angua and Carrot!" Harry replied giggling slightly. Draco gasped.
Whilst Draco sorted everyone out with his or her drinks, Severus read the letter silently. His audience waited patiently for him to finish. When he finally looked up, they could see tears brimming his eyes, threatening to fall. He took in a shuddering breath. "Lucius, he-he has be-been through wha-what I-I have b-been through." He sobbed falling into his Tom's arms.
- If 7 things are burnt, 20 lashes of the belt
He sat on the floor next to him and pulled the sobbing Slytherin onto his lap rocking them back and forth whilst the class watched with tears streaming down their faces. They listened as Harry whispered sweet nothings into Draco's ear, trying to calm him down while his own tears fell down his face, obviously not believing his words.
The air was soon full of birds from all over the worlds when suddenly, two flocks of yellow canaries flapped into existence making the class oooh. Hermione and Professor Flitwick gasped in delight. "Professor! Professor! There are soulmates in this class!!!!!" Hermione jumped up and down in excitement. "Yes Miss Granger, you are correct. Canaries, I believe, are happy birds, spread joy and a sense of well-being. Flying canaries can be a sign of freedom while others see it as a sign of gossip." He smiled sadly. "But, canaries can be seen as a sign of selflessness and entrapment, especially if the canary is caged." He looked around.
- If 5 things are dropped, 2 days no food
Who is buying me these??
When I saw Draco walk into breakfast I stopped breathing. She was breathtakingly beautiful. Her thigh high boots were a gorgeous black leather that finished just over her knees and that green turtleneck. Why does she look so good in turtlenecks??
He just laughs and says:
"Well done Miss Granger, 10 points to Gryffindor!" He turned back to the slightly disappointed class. "Now, I want you to all stand up and follow me outside."
Harry blushed, "Uh, yes. When you reject me 'cos you don't feel the same way." he mumbled looking down at the floor again in embarrassment.
When Albus reached Harry's home for the summer, he noticed some things that you would most definitely not see at the Dursley's. Their door was ajar, and the whole neighbourhood was outside... That was strange. Were they holding a bake sale? No cant be, the building is on fire. He wondered how that happened. The third thing he noticed was the blood. Now blood in the Dursley household was not unusual, but in this quantity it was certainly eye brow raising. This couldn't have come from someone Harry's size. So whose was it? One of the crowds? No, they all looked fine.
About a month after he found out about Ginny's whorish tendencies, Harry got a customer he would never have expected.
“Aw nah it’s cute, adorable, hot…”
Draco growled, "First off, I wont let you get hurt again. Ever. And-"
"Bloody hell cub!"
"Harry! What the hell was that?"
She just gaped at me. Honestly. I give up.
Burn anything ~ 20 lashes of the belt {total: 26 times}
With a soft smile, she proceeded to finish waking them up. "We are going shopping today, for multiple things. First your books for this year and-"
"...sorry mione."
Severus did a double take. "I beg your pardon?" he asked incredulously.
Harry J Potter."
I just want to say, I have had one kiss EVER. Like, it was a press of my lips on my boyfriends for like 3 seconds. I was 15.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well fuck me." was all Vernon said before punching Draco.
At the end of sixth year, they proposed. I said yes and we were married before the end of the summer holidays by their mother, before I had to leave my Everything to destroy the Horcruxes.
He pulled Draco flush to him, grabbing onto whatever he could find with curious hands - shoulders, waist, arms, face and at one point, his arse. Draco nipped his bottom lip every so often, making Harry weak in the knees and turning his wandering hands desperate.
"I wonder what you like Draco. I will discover everything tonight so I won't be wondering much longer." And with that, Harry threw Draco onto his bed and if they forgot the silencing charms? No one cared, they were just glad that the two boys finally found each other.
Harry beamed at Draco and lunged forward smashing their lips together in a sweet but soon turned heated kiss. They eventually pulled away for breath when oxygen became a necessity and just grinned at each other, their love for one another reflecting in their eyes.
Harry gasped into the kiss, opening his mouth just as Draco had anticipated and opened his eyes.
Why am I so nervous?!?! It's just Harry. You know, the girl of my dreams, my heart and I am pretty sure she is my soulmate. Okay maybe that soulmate part was a bit far fetched... And anyways, dumbass, that 'pep talk' was crap.
Tom curled his hands around his love and pulled him into his lap. He gently kissed the top of his head before answering Draco. "Sev didn't have the best childhood when growing up. He was abused. He still has scars today, mentally and physically." He stopped, pulling Severus tighter onto his lap.
Pansy yawned. "Hmm, what about the green turtleneck, the skintight one?" Millicent suggested. "Ah Millicent! Welcome to the land of the living!" I teased lightly. "Fuck off Draco. Do you want my help or not?" I giggled. "Thanks Millie." "Oh, and do that half up half down hairstyle where the top half is in a plait." I beamed at Millicent and thanked her.
"Good morning students."
Thank you, for taking the time to read this letter. Like I said at the beginning, you don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes.
Woah!!!! Harry is such a drama queen. 'Oh i just found out me and my crush are soulmates so I'm just gonna go ahead and faint into his arms like a damsel in distress'
Malfoy-Potter.
"Oh merlin, that was so hot." Pansy sighed dreamily.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay students, I want you to stand in a massive circle, yes that's it, and here we go. Now, copy me. Avis!"
And him of course, but mostly his lips.
over me. The one thing I had over him when we were younger was my height. Now that is gone and he can lord it over me all he wants.
"Pffft nope. Nothing is there there is no spark."
Harry hummed and flashed a grin at Draco before disappearing into the bathroom. He sighed 'this is so weird'. The past few months have been a rollercoaster for Harry, discovering his cheating friends, being choked to death by potions, learning about his history with Grapclaw in Gringotts, scaring the shit out of the Headmaster and then him retaliating by forcing Harry to live with his abusive relatives. And then being rescued by the 'Dark Lord', his husband and his crush and crushes family. Plus, what was that light that had surrounded him and Draco?
: HE STOLE MY BLOODY HEART TOO. GIVE IT BACK PRAT
Severus sighed wetly before saying, "It appears so. I haven't even looked at his punishment chart yet." "Punishment chart?" Tom asked aghast. Severus hummed and handed him the letter.
One day, Draco decided to run a little late, just to see what would happen.
We grabbed our bags and our money from the dorms and headed outside to go wait for the teacher to take us down to Hogsmeade. I saw Harry, Hermione and Ron in the corner of the courtyard whispering and giggling to each other as flakes of snow decorated their hair and hats. Hands covered their mouths as they leant towards another's ear and spoke words I was unable to hear from here.
"No, I didnt. Why didnt you tell me face to face?" Ginny asked furiously.
Severus grabs pain relieving potions, blood replenishing potions and calming droughts and levitates them over to Draco who is comforting harry. Draco asks if Harry can drink these for him and Harry does. He starts to go sleepy, cuddles up more into Draco, and eventually falls asleep in his arms. Draco kisses his forehead and Narcissa coos. Draco sent her a glare and positioned Harry in his arms so he can hold him without dropping him. The four take him back to where they are staying; however, there are no spare beds so Draco suggests him and Harry share.
I groan, she is so clingy!! I look around to see if I can find someone to get me away from the ginger whore. Something bright and shiny caught my eye. Fuck! Malfoy is coming over!
"Dear Professor Snape,
"Good morning Professor Flitwick." The 6th year class chorused. This class was a mixture of Gryffindor and Slytherin and they were eagerly awaiting to learn a new charm to hex each other with.
"Uh, sorry Ron." Harry replied sheepishly.
However, if we did, then I can safely say I most definitely choked on my bread.
"Yes, Draco. They would." He still spoke in a hushed voice. I don't even remember what my question was. But he said yes, so... that's what I wanted right?
"Yes, he is. But I suspect it was a survival instinct." Draco said sadly. The adults immediately sobered up before listening to Tom finishing the letter.
Draco sneered back. “Oh, my bad, how could I get in the way of one third of the Golden Trio? How rude of me. I’ll be seeing you Weasel.” He turned to walk off but Ron retorted.
"I honestly do not know Draco. Can you bring me the letter? Thank you." He said, as the letter was passed to him. "I know this is a weird observation to make, but his handwriting is so much neater than normal. I wonder why." He mused the last bit to himself.
"Hmm. Its a Saturday so you can spend the weekend getting everything you need and then you can distribute it during the week. It should still be snowy next weekend so you can ask her out at the weekend." Pansy suggested. I contemplated it for a moment, eyes automatically flicking over to Harry who still has flakes of snow in her hair. "That sounds like a good idea Pans. What on earth would I do with out you two?"
?? Have you lost your mind? Skeeter would have a field day!" Sirius scolded. Remus rolled his eyes in exasperation at his partner and Harry groaned and buried his face into Draco's chest. "Oh,  also, have you two snagged yet? That sexual tension I saw in your third year was
There are too many children. Why did I become a Professor again?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Well, we could play games? Or tag? Or play a one on one seeker match? Or..." He leaned towards my ear and as his breath fanned across my cheek, I froze. Suddenly, I'm no longer tired. It's like a switch flicked inside me although I am pretty sure my cheeks are flaming red. This was new territory! I don't know how to act! His lips are so gorgeous and they're right by my ear and I don't know what to think!
"Yes it was ferret face. You need to learn some discipline. You can't just pick up a random person and start running around with then on your shoulder and not expect then to retaliate!" Harry snarked back.
cute."
"Harry."
On the 15th meet with Harry, Draco had an idea. Harry should confront her and then break up with her. Say they are over forever. Harry was a bit sceptical at first but decided he would do it like that. Ginny was unfaithful. Harry was not gonna deal with her shit.
"Oh, you're married are you?"
"That poor elf!" Narcissa cried. "I always knew those Weasley's were despicable, but to abuse a creature? That's disgusting!" Remus exclaimed, angrily throwing his hands up in the air. Everyone nodded in silent agreement, silently seething.
knows how much taste I have. She tastes me often you know." I wink at him before looking around the hall, feigning interest. At the other end of the table I can see Hermione staring at me with her mouth wide open. I don't acknowledge her.
When he returned for 8th year, he was thrown into the spotlight again. It was brighter than ever this time and he hated it. He just wanted to see Draco, the boy he has been in love with for 7 years now, to see if he made it.
My body shivered, my cheeks warmed and my pulse began an erratic beat beneath my skin. Draco grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the exit. As we reached the magnificent doors, he looked over at the teachers sitting in shock and gestured with his head. Out. Now. We then walked hand in hand to Albus’ office.
“Harry potter is my best friend! Move!” bellowed a boy of 16. This voice belongs to Ronald Billius Weasley. He isn’t a very nice person and he uses people as we can clearly see. When he first met Harry Potter, he was 11. He was a sweet boy but him being Harry’s best mate got to his head and demanded privileges he did not earn. 5 years later, he believes he owns the school and can often be seen belittling his ‘best mate’. This caused Harry to have insecurities and he often believes Ron. It’s a toxic relationship, which Harry feels he cannot escape. Not even when he found out Ron was stealing from him.
This may come as a surprise and you are probably wondering why I am writing to you. Please read the whole thing. You don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes, just read the whole letter and I will be very grateful. It will be a very long letter and I suggest you sit down with a glass of something strong. It will help – trust me.
. If you get what I mean. What I
"Harry." I started. "I have liked you since second year. We are fifteen now. I decided I should do something about it. I bought all these gifts for you because I can see you wearing them, they suit you, I could afford them, you deserve them and they all reminded me of you. I looked at each one and the first person who came to my mind was you, so I bought them." I looked down to the ground, necklace still in my hand. I took in a shuddering breath, to calm my nerves, before asking Harry the important question.
"MALFOY PUT ME DOWN!"
"You're comfy, and warm and I am cold. So shut up and prepare yourself for my cold hands." was all Harry got befre two ice-cold hands were shoved under his jumper.
THE END
The two boys kept looking at the door in fear and jumped high into the air when the doors burst open revealing a smug Potions Professor.
I accept her handshake warily and reply, “Potter, Harry Potter. “
??? What the hell?
The Gryffindor blushed at what his soulmate was insinuating. He sighs exasperatedly, trying to hide how he is really feeling. "Fiiiiiiine." He said, getting up and wrapping the blanket around himself. "Oh, dinner is in about three hours, so you have plenty of time." Lucius said, winking suggestively. "You can pack and repack your trunks as many times as you want."
"I-I mean that you have staked your claim on me - you have claimed me. Just... just as you said you wanted to the other night- OH!" Draco chuckled in the crease of the Gryffindor's neck as Harry's voice broke off and his hips bucked up to Draco's and his answering hardness.
“Hmm she did didn’t she?!” he laughs and I can’t help but smile softly. I love his laugh, makes me happy. “Ginger whore huh? I call her the Weasley slut but I prefer yours more I think.” He laughs again. “Wait…!!! You like me too?!?!”
Draco gasped in realisation. "So
doesn't plan on having any.
I picked up her necklace and held it in my palm, watching the sun glint off it.
"PANSY! I have a problem!!! I dont know what to wear! Today is a hogsmeade weekend and I bet she will be there and I am freaking out cos I want to make a good impression on her and-"
Draco sighed and sacrificed some of his bacon. It wasn't like he was going to eat it anyway.
"Hello Harry." I replied softly.
"What are you doing?!" Harry shrieked.
I saw this and thought of you.
Harry screamed.
The Malfoys and Severus Snape were in the Amazon Rainforest helping Severus look for special potions ingredients when an unconscious Harry Potter appeared in front of them. As they rush over, they notice he is shirtless, beaten black and blue and is bleeding heavily. Severus and Narcissa immediately stop the bleeding and enervate him. Harry sees them and starts to cry silently. He suddenly rolls over and retches but as he has not been fed, nothing came out except for saliva. Draco runs over and tries to help him. He soothes him and calms him down stroking his hair lightly.
I hear a pointed cough behind me but ignore whoever it is so I can snog my husband.
Hermione gushed over it for six minutes straight before putting it in my hair. She agreed with my courtier, it suits my hair very well.
Dropped: 9 days no food
When I managed to get up without dying, I saw a red package on my bedside table by my glasses. I grabbed my glasses and shoved them on my face, checking the time as I did so. 5:34 AM. Great, no one else is up yet. Maybe I can try move some of these petals so we can get out of the room...
Harry received and owl from Draco 2 days later. It went something like this:
“WEASEL GET OF HIM BEFORE I KILL YOU!!!” Draco yelled before trying to pull the furious boy off Harry.
October 31st, my parents were killed. I was orphaned and Dumbledore ensured I was placed with my muggle relatives – Petunia and Vernon Dursley. He left a letter with a large amount of money in to ensure my 'wellbeing'. My 'wellbeing' isn't what you would have expected from the 'Chosen one'. You would've thought it was meant to pamper me, give me the best luxuries money could buy. I didn't get that. I was treated worse than a house elf. I still am.
As this was outside the Great Hall, a crowd had started to gather, students joining one by one. They were all holding their breaths, wondering what was about to happen next. What did happen next surprised them immensely.
A silver stag bursts out of my wand, a reminder of what I want and yet cannot have.
Anyways, I don't actually know what snogging is like. I have no desire to snog/kiss/make-out/whatever you want to call it. As an asexual hooman being, I personally cannot really handle physical contact but that's just me so I hope I write the kissing scenes correctly.
by showing us your best clothes. I
"For those of you who do not understand what drarry is, it is my One True Pairing and the two boys are – drum roll please." The school started to drum roll on the tables in excitement.
Severus spoke up, "I can't wait to see their faces when we tell them." Tom smirked, "I have a feeling it will be a pensieve moment." The adults snickered before grabbing their own desserts and following the boys into the sitting room. They were blessed by the sight of Draco feeding Harry a forkful of treacle tart, blushing furiously and swaddled in blankets, cocooned together on the love seat by the fire.  Tom snorted quietly, and lowered his voice so the teens couldn't hear. "I bet this is why Draco asked to sit in here with dessert..." he trailed off looking very smug when Draco kissed the top of Harry's head affectionately, not even realising he did it. Harry blushed more. Draco had pulled Harry so Harry was snuggled in between Draco's legs, his back to Draco's chest, their plates lay forgotten on the coffee table next to them as they curled into each other, practically glowing with happiness and content.
I am a Malfoy. We do not choke on bread.
Don't get me wrong, I love it when he plays with my hair, especially when we... um... you can guess that bit, but when he braids it? It looks horrible. I am manly. I cannot pull off a plait.
The next day around breakfast time, just outside the Great Hall a boy with messy raven hair and emerald eyes was walking to breakfast when a red headed male behind him shouted for his attention.
I swagger into the full Great Hall, acting as if I haven't just disappeared for 12 years. Acting as if I own the school.
I grabbed his hand and pulled it off where it was stroking my hair and dropped it. It gravitated back to his body and hung limply beside him. Giving the best glare I could muster whilst feeling so embarrassed about having Potters hand in my hair and being so tired, I spoke. "Don't touch my hair Potter. Or I will hex you into next week." He sighed mockingly and replied with a "But you do that
The rest of the month went on like that. No matter what, the dog was always on time. He never saw it outside of their walks. Until one time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry whipped his head around as fast as lightning to look at who spoke. The man wore a leather jacket with deep blue jeans and a pair of thick black boots. His partner wore the same but he was holding a leather satchel and had many scars on his face. The one who spoke had black shoulder length hair that contrasted to his friends sandy blond locks.
Chapter 2
Harry was working on his Charm's essay in the Gryffindor common room when a Second Year with pigtails came and handed him a note. She scurried away as quickly as she came. He rolled his eyes, and opened the note.
I'll ask Harry later though, they have finally finished yelling and now I can concentrate on making my potion. Mione says if I dont finish it and get at least an acceptable then she'll drag me into the library for 3 weeks straight! That's torture that is!
Enjoy!
He stands up and touches my arm lightly and just like that, the fight is drained out of me.
Returning for his eighth year, Draco did not expect to find himself curled up on the sofa in the eighth year common room in Harry bloody Potters arms.
"Harry James Potter. I like you a lot, and I think you do too. Wi-will you be my girlfriend?"
Were they always going to end like that? It's cute.
Harry has gone all shy now; does he like me too?
"I would have done the same Fenrir." Severus said softly. Tom sighed again. "And I too, would have done the same. Come, sit down Fenrir. There is much to discuss." Tom turned to Harry. "If it is okay, may we know what you discovered?" Harry nodded hesitantly. "I suspect it may be a long explanation as I would have to go back and explain some things. So to make things easier... does anyone have a pensive?"
Harry excitedly took it out of the tissue paper and slipped it on. As she admired her bracelet, I took the empty box from her hand and replaced it with the other gift.
and he absolutely needed
P.S If you do not go, I will hex your balls off. Love you!
"Oi!!!" Draco shouted before grabbing Harry by his waist and hoisting him up onto his shoulders again. Harry shrieked as he dangled upside down once more. "Don't you dare slap my arse again Potter or suffer the consequences! They will be much more intense than last time." Draco said warningly as Pansy laughed.
"Oh and Mione, can you do my hair please?" I asked shyly. She smiled at me. "Of course! Now, lets find you some clothes."
Harry just wants to get away from his abusing relatives. He has just watched someone die and then someone else come back to life and you would have thought he would have been allowed to stay at his best mate’s house right? Wrong. Dumbledore said he had to stay with his relatives, the Horse and two Whales. Said it was "for the greater good, my boy".
Harry sent the letter with his trusty owl the next day. He then floo called his blond to tell him how it went. "She should get the owl soon. I really am just done with her." Harry said making Draco laugh. Harry's face adopted a confused frown causing Draco to stop laughing and enquire as to what was wrong.
They didn't notice Draco picking up the pieces of paper that slipped out. They didn't notice him starting to cry as he read the cards slowly. They did notice, however, when he yelled and his magic lost control. Once he got himself under control, he spoke. "School starts in 2 days, Mother. We're too late." Were the dreaded words that fell out of his mouth.
I ignore them.
*Charms Classroom*
"'Mione wanted to show me something after tea."
"That's the second time you have done that now. Did you not even realise you were doing it?" Severus asked curiously. Draco shook his head, "No, I didn't. I just had an urge to do it but I put it off. Apparently, I did it anyway. Which, not gonna to lie, is a bit worrying because there are some things I want to do but I shouldn't..." He trailed off and Harry frowned, "Like what?"
Harry squirmed, not really wanting to talk about it but knowing he had to. Everyone must have so many questions...
"You're not best mates are you?"
He laughed and the sound made my insides tingle. What is going on?!
"Can the two who produced the canaries step forward please?"
Draco carries on speaking when Harry didn’t say anything. ‘I just want to protect you. Keep you safe. Heal you. Calm you. Make you smile, make you happy.’ Draco felt a tear roll down his own face. Well there goes keeping his emotions in check.
: MY EVERLASTING LOVE (and no use of blackmail for two years against catcher)
“What do you think ferret?” I spit making him chuckle slightly. I raised my eyebrow. I was not expecting that.
The two boys in question flicked a glance at the other, not quite meeting the others eyes, blushing furiously as they nodded.
A voice interrupts the two before Ron got a chance to reply. “Oi, Weasel.”
As Harry tries to sleep that night, he wonders if Draco likes him too. He wonders if Draco really cares about him. If he doesn’t mind the fact that harry is broken and scarred mentally and physically.
"I agree, but first shall we finish this gorgeous meal and then head to the sitting room for comfort?" Narcissa suggested glaring slightly at Tom for unsettling Harry. Tom smiled sheepishly and nodded in agreement. "Good." Narcissa said before Lucius clapped his hands once more and the food disappeared to be replaced with lots of desserts. Lucius smiled at Harry's awed expression. "Gon on child, take whatever you want and however much you want."
Finally, he reaches Draco and he just sits there on the floor looking wretched. It tore Draco’s heart to see his love like this. He just gazed into Harry's emerald orbs trying to push his emotions like love, care and worry to the front. He didn’t want harry to see the anger, fury and rage he felt. That would not help Harry right now. Another time maybe. Harry had stopped crying by now; however, he still looked skittish so Draco moved slightly to gauge his reaction. Harry didn’t flinch which was good. Draco slowly reached out towards the cute boy and made sure harry could see his hands.
Harry mustered up all his courage and closed his eyes placing his lips ever so gently onto Draco's. He held them there for three seconds, marvelling at how soft they were before pulling back and smiling softly. He turned around to leave and was tiptoeing out but froze when he felt two arms wrap around his waist. His breath hitched and his heart hammered in his chest even harder than before.
"Yes, that is how my family brought me up," Ron replied sadly. Hermione opened her mouth to say something but Ron cut her off. "But, Charlie is gay, and I'm pretty sure the twins are pansexual and I'm bi I think, so it doesn't actually bother me in the slightest. My parents were angry when Charlie came out but they eventually warmed up to the idea. Its Ginny you should watch out for. She knows all the derogatory terms for LGBTQ+ people I swear. Its disgusting." He said, pulling a face.
"Because you didnt deserve it. Someone who cheats on you does not deserve to be broken up with face to face." Harry spat.
Harry slowly wriggled out of the bed he was in admiring the bedding as he went. He needed to pee. Where was the bathroom?
The train ride was soon over and Harry hopped off just behind Draco. He exited through the wall and spotted his relatives scowling at him. He walked briskly over, knowing the longer he took, the more painful his punishment would be at the end of the holidays. The Dursley's has made a chart. A chart for his punishments, showing what his crime was, and the type of punishment he had and the total time he would be punished for it at the end of the holiday. Last summer, he was punished for 2 hours and 43 minutes. He hated it but it meant he could get treatment almost immediately when he got back to school.
"'Having fun'? That was the best you could do?!" Sirius laughed at Lucius' choice of wording. Just then, the door to the living room creaked open and two faces appeared; cheeks red and mouths swollen. "Clopsy!! I told you to leave them be if they were having fun!!" The adults laughed at Lucius who was whining and pouting. His wife opened her arms with a wide smile and he settled into them.
Sworn enemies turned soulmates.
After two weeks, a sign was posted all around the school.
Harry looked to Draco and they had a silent conversation through their eyes. Eventually Draco nodded and Harry smiled before casting a Muffliato around the four. "We are soulmates! Over the summer, I asked Sev for help. The Dursleys were particularly abusive this holiday so I was forced to ask for help. I asked Severus, thinking he may have a soft spot for Lily still and he is good at healing. I was anticipating a portkey to Pomfrey. Instead I got this gorgeous blonde, an awesome second mother, a snarky second father and two amazing uncles. They took me in and I have been with them since." Harry smiled at Draco and snuggled into him.
Harry pouted, "I was!!! I got up to find the bathroom, couldn't find a light, remembered I had a wand and then cast lumos to see where I was going and you were all THERE!!! I literally was almost pissing myself!!!" Draco laughed harder if that was even possible. Even Lucius and Severus had to clamp their mouths shut to stop their chuckles escaping. Narcissa didn't bother, she was grinning widely at Harry's discomfort and her son's giggle fit. Tom just sat there, looking slightly amused by it all.
It was silent for a moment and when I looked up at Harry, she flung her arms around my neck chanting "yes, yes, yes" in my ear. I grinned and wrapped my arms around her, nuzzling into her soft hair.
Malfoy-Potter
This morning I got a beautiful knuckle ring(A/N is that what it is called? Lol). This admirer of mine is going all out. They're obviously rich. Draco is rich... no it cant be. Why would she like me when she can have Blaise or Theo?
[Moving house as I'm writing this - so excited!]
What_u_fell_over_for ~ thank you so much for the request. I love this idea.
Draco's eyes couldn't look away, he was hypnotized. Only when the door had shut with a soft click did he realise he had been staring. He was so fucked.
Fourth year, my darling didn't lose faith in me and supported me when no one else did.
Merlin she is so cute.
He got up and walked to the door, face burning as people mocked his shriek. He grit his teeth and ignored them best as he could. He had completed all his work for the day so he decided to go sit down under a tree by the lake. It was cold without his cloak so he cast some warming charms.
It smelled of cinnamon and he wondered if Harry knew he smelled of cinnamon. He made a mental note to ask him later and instead found himself carding his fingers through Harry’s hair.
Draco looked at me with a strange face. He looked fiercely protective but very possessive at the same time. And that’s when I promptly fainted.
He was very agitated throughout the rest of the day but it went smoother than the morning, thankfully. Now it was after curfew and he was patrolling the corridors looking for students who were out of bed.
Harry drags in a deep breath as if to reply.
"Will you two shut up?!" He yelled at the boys, making them blush- wait blush?
I hope you like this gift for you. It will go perfectly with your beautiful, soft hair.
Draco sighed quietly and looked down at Harry in his arms who was in a similar state as the crowd. He looked at Draco in shock. “I-I-I thought-“
"SILENCE!" Harry roared. They quietened down almost immediately. He fixed them with a cold glare before speaking in an equally cold voice. "It is none of your business what is going on. You just carry on insulting the Slytherins like normal and you won't have to deal with the change. Merlin knows you Gryffindors are too incompetent to understand simple things so all I am going to say is leave me the fuck alone and we will not have any problems. Do not bother me, do not question me and no one will be hurt. Is that clear?"
"And that is?" Draco's voice came from the closed door, confirming Harry's thoughts of it being a bathroom.
Harry just sat there in Draco's arms a dazed look on his face, still trying to process the information he had just been given. "We are soulmates?" He breathed. Draco nodded and Harry's face lit up. "Awesome!!" Was all Draco got before Harry smashed his lips onto Draco's. Draco's hands flew up to grab Harry's head and hold him in place as he kissed back. Harry tilted his head more to the side to allow Draco more room to get closer. To reward him, Draco swept his tongue across Harry's full, lower lip making the raven haired gasp. Draco swallowed the gasp and plundered his soulmates mouth, tasting every single inch of him.
"GODDAMMIT HARRY JUST GET A GODDAMN SHOWER!"
It made me jealous, I'm not going to lie, when Ron whispered and smiled at Harry. Especially when she smiled back.
In the crowded corridors of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there is always one voice that drowns out all the rest.
“Malfoy.” Ginny snarls and clings to me more digging her nails into my arms almost drawing blood. .
"He reminded me of you and your husband. Broken, helpless and in need of hope. He has been through a similar past to you two, and if the need would arise, I would have left you to follow him." Fenrir flinched at the fire in Tom's and Severus' eyes at the mention if their past. Severus' eyes softened.
The end. :-)
"She looked at you didnt she?!" Pansy whisper-yelled at me. I blushed darker and smiled at the ground before throwing a quick glance back at Harry. She was looking at me still. I am pretty sure my face is a tomato now.
“HARRY! Where were you last night? You did not come back to the dorm; I stayed up all night and you did not fucking come back! What the hell mate?” Ron was furious.
“Ah, you have trouble with flirting weaselette” Draco says knowingly with a mischievous grin plastered across his mouth.
Draco's mother just laughed and walked out with a gaping Lucius trailing behind. "Oh and boys? I would suggest a silencing charm, the bathroom is quite echoey. See you in an hour!"
Draco smiled faintly, stroking Harry's face. It's silent for ages. The men had migrated to the sofa and were clinging onto each other for support. "I think it doesn't hurt as much because I think I might've moved on..." Harry said breaking the quiet atmosphere.
"When I reject you?" Draco interrupted.
"That was such a Draco reaction. I am so disappointed in you Harry." Narcissa teased lightly. "Mum!" She just laughed.
“Potter…” he growls again.
The summer included Harry being belittled 24/7 and starved for the smallest of things. Once he was starved for dropping a spoon – 2 days no food. The Dursley's were harsher this summer – as if he could take it.
Harry sighed. "I don't actually know- hang on I have an idea...." he said grinning madly. Malfoy, who couldn't see his grin, was still running with his prize over his shoulder, and did not expect what came next.
“Hmm? They are?”
"Mipsy!" Severus called. A small pop sounded and a house elf appeared at his side to serve. "Master Severus? What would you like?" she asked in her high-pitched squeaky voice. "Can you bring us some scotch and glasses please Mipsy?" Severus replied smiling faintly at the elf. Mipsy nodded, her ears bobbing up and down as she did so. "Of course Master Severus! Anything for Master Severus!" She popped away instantly and a few moments later returned with the alcohol and glasses. "Can I do anything else for Masters?" she asked. "No Mipsy, that's all thank you." Tom replied.
"You'll be screaming that at some point..." Harry said, wiggling his eyebrows, his voice dropping down a tone.
Draco didn't mind his companion. He was pretty lonely, which was to be expected. He liked the company, but he was sad when it left five minutes before they returned to the castle. It would always run off and he wouldn't see it till the next day after school.
is not cheating on me.
"I'll do whatever I bloody want to do Potter."
Draco chuckled, "No problem Potter."
He grabbed Draco by the chin and slammed him against the nearest piece of furniture. This just so happened to be the receptionists desk. (She was out luckily.)
Its only a small bit.
Harry has been different since Thursday. It is now Saturday. I sent her the note earlier, no gift. She was doing her best to not look at me. I didn't realise she looked at me that often and when she started to ignore me, it hurt. Like, really hurt.
"CLOPSY!" The house elf squeaked before blushing and looking at the ground. Harry spoke softly. "It's okay Clopsy, we will pretend we don't know anything other than that there are photos involved, and you can keep doing your surprise yes?" The small elf nodded happily before snapping her fingers and hot chocolate in mugs filled a tray on the table. "Bye-bye Masters and Mistress!" She popped away.
"You seem awfully lonely and sad, is your wife cheating on you?"
The rest of the school year went with Harry ignoring the Gryffindors and politely nodding to the Slytherins. The first time he nodded to Malfoy, the blond gaped at him until Harry smirked at him. He scowled and strolled off away from Harry.
interested in however, was the friendship necklace around her skinny neck.
What is the time? I use my wand to cast tempus and-
Just then Hermione walked into the dorm. "MIONE!! HELP!!" I screeched. "My courtier wants to meet in half an hour!!!"
Harry flushed. Then he smirked. "You sure you're a Malfoy then?"
I am sure I'm a tomato red right now.
"Boys, I need you to look at me. This is important." Tom demanded. Both boys turned their heads towards him curiously. "Now, what just happened and that golden light are connected, yes? That light only appears when a magical person is in unbelievable amounts of pain and their soulmate is in the same room." He stopped to let it sink in.
Snape hesitated, enjoying the discomfort he could see emanating from Harry.
Harry gasped, "Really?"
"Harry, it's actually normal to feel like this..." Narcissa said into Harry's hair. "Really?" he asked, bright green doe eyes peeking up from under his hair. "Yes, Harry, it is." She reassured. "This actually is something we needed to talk about. It concerns the golden ball of light yesterday," "The one that made me hurt?" Narcissa flinched. "Yes Harry, the one that made you hurt."
A week has passed and the school was divided. It was split in two, people in support of drarry, and people against drarry. Most of the school supported drarry, this was mainly made up of the slytherins and gryffindor house. Amusing right?
Ron was interrupted before he could speak.
Cute.
Harry had had enough. If this man was going to eye fuck him any longer he can eye fuck
"Hear what?"
The dog was always on time. No matter what day of the week, it was always there, and sometimes it even helped pick out a name by pressing its wet snout onto the polished stone. They were pretty random names.
Harry,
Snape smirked, "Last night." He drawled. "Oh and Draco is top."
His love for the boy grounds him so he doesn’t go and kill whoever did this to Harry in a fit of rage. He has to be calm for Harry. He can’t scare him away or Harry will never recover.
SHE WAS STARING AT ME. SPECIFICALLY MY ARSE! OH MY GODDDDD - I said cAlMlY inside my head.
To say the least Draco was confused about the last part. Who had captured Harry's attention? Or was he just saying it for effect? When he brought it up with Harry all he got was a blinding grin before he chugged the last of his cold coffee and left the cafe to go home. This did nothing to calm Draco's panicking brain.
Someone sits next to me.
He walked past a broom closet shuddering in disgust when he heard a sound.
The Hall is unnaturally quiet but I pay no notice to it as I stare at my soup morosely. I just want my lover.
“Harry! Please just go on a date with me this weekend to hogsmeade!! I’m begging you! Pleaseeeeeeeeeeee!!!” Ginny whined.
Ginny looked crestfallen. "Harry I'm so sorry, I really am I-"
"Took your time cousin dear!" Sirius said, smiling brightly at Narcissa. "Sirius! Remus! How nice of you to join us. Can I get you a drink?" The hostess snapped her fingers and summoned an elf. Clopsy popped in to take her mistresses orders and soon left with a quiet crack.
"Actually Malfoy, I'm not a Potter."
I have a plan. It involves expensive gifts, a lot of planning and cooperation from other people, notes and lots and lots of petals. But that might change.
The chart went something like this:
"Here are your flowers. On the house today. Bye Draco! Dont get too wet!" Harry waved the blond out his shop and grinned when he got a smile in return. He couldn't wait to fix bridges he thought he had destroyed 10 years ago.
"Not my son you son of a bitch" Narcissa growled and sent a Crucio his way. Vernon fell to the ground writhing in pain as Lucius started sending Stinging Hex after Stinging Hex at him. Whilst his parents were destroying Vernon, Draco tried to stop the bleeding coming from his nose. He tried to make his way to Harry but his broken nose was painful and he feeling very lightheaded.
"Sounds perfect." Draco whispered and kissed him again, harder and more passionate than the last one. This kiss conveyed all the emotions they were feeling; love, hope, sorrow, hurt. It was a promise to the other that they would they would stay with each other.
By the time I managed to fit all the rose petals into the bag it was 6:13 AM. Merlin, it is too early for this. A rustling alerted me that Hermione was awake. She poked her head round her curtains and frowned when she looked at the floor. "What's up mione?" I asked.
He walked up to his dorm, dropped his back and books but pulled out a book to read. Draco plopped onto his bed, and read a chapter. It had been 15 minutes so he decided to go downstairs and go for his daily walk. He donned his coat, hat, scarf and gloves as it was cold and briskly walked down to the War memorial. There it was. The dog. Lying down, head on its front paws. It cracked an eye open and took in Draco's amused smile.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO IT IS!!
"Boys! Wake up!!" Narcissa's voice pulled Draco and Harry from their sweet dreams. She had walked into Draco's room to wake the soulmates up and had found them spooning on top of Draco's covers, still in their clothes from yesterday. The dragons on the bed spread were curled around the twins boys protectively making Narcissa coo internally.
"Hey Harry," he whispered. "We're here to take you away." Harry's eyes flew open and looked at Draco as if he was Harry's world. Narcissa and Severus just cooed in the background. "Really?" Harry asked hopefully. "Yes, re-" Draco was cut off as Harry was grabbed by his hair and thrown into the wall behind him.
"Can I come over Harry?" When Harry nodded Draco stepped through the green flames into Harry's home. He wrapped his arms around the brunet who stiffened at first before finally relaxing. "When you found out... did it hurt?" Draco whispered.
I grab the roll and start eating it.
Mon, 17 Aug, 2020
The bell on the door tinkled as a customer stepped through. It was Draco's mother. The boys groaned and slumped onto the table and slowly sat up to compose themselves. Narcissa had a smirk on her face as she saw the swollen mouths and fast rising chests and rounded onto the shop owner. "Does that suggest neither boy are interested into you?" The man nodded, ashamed. "My son and his boyfriend are
All of a sudden, a warm, hairy body brushed against his legs making him shriek and drop his fork. Everyone turned to look at him, some snickering, some confused. Draco blushed. He was not going to be able to get people to forget about this.
I have something to show you. Meet me at the Astronomy Tower after dinner.
Anyways, don't forget to let me know if you want a request written. I have some more to do (and I am so sorry this was so late) but I guess having things pile up motivates me lol.
I thought so.
‘Harry! Harry, love wake up! Please wake up!’ Draco shakes him awake. Harry wakes with a scream, eyes wild, breathing erratic hair messed into strange angles. He sobs, his tiny, scrawny body shakes with how big they are.
He read the letter aloud to the Malfoys. "I should probably start at the beginning. The very beginning.
Broken: 3 days no food and 25 lashes
"WAIT! Please, do not disturb them if they are having 'fun'? I want them to enjoy this bit of time to their selves" Clopsy nodded dutifully. "Of course Master Lucy." With a smile, Clopsy disappeared upstairs.
She looks gorgeous wearing that in her hair. I wonder if she knows she does. I was silently musing over which gift to give her next as I stared at her through history of magic. She turned around and looked at me. I smiled at her and faced the front of the class. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Hermione and Pansy smirking and a blush evident on Harry's cheeks.
Draco tilted his head to the side to deepen the kiss and relished the moan that escaped Harry's lips when he plunged his tongue inside the Gryffindors mouth. He was so focused on mapping Harry's mouth with his tongue and getting more noises like that from Harry he didn't notice when he had started to grind against the raven haired boy. When Harry tore his mouth from Draco's, panting and looking thoroughly debauched, Draco finally realised where they were and what they were doing.
"Oh, okay then. Thanks Potter!" Draco stalked off to his friends to 'report his findings'.
I turned back around to join Pansy and Blaises conversation, not noticing my cheeks had blossomed a pale pink. Pansy noticed my flushed face and poked Blaise.
The former slytherin couldn't understand why Ginny did it. She had everything with Harry; money, probably fantastic sex, unconditional love and security. Why was she throwing it around for a few meaningless fucks? Draco couldn't wrap his head around it.
Chapter 3
Harry,
Draco pouted. "Oh my god that's adorable." Harry breathed whist staring with wide eyes.
Draco had actually considered leaving the Manor and his parents. He could emancipate himself as he was old enough but he didn't want to leave his mother with his father. That was the only reason he became a Death Eater – to protect his mother. But no one knew that, and no one asked so he didn't tell. He had a feeling Potter knew a bit. He didn't know how though, but he always seemed to know what Draco was struggling with even if he didn't even know he was struggling.
“No I don’t!” Ginny argues hotly.
I love you so very much. I can get lost in those beautiful green eyes. I hope you have a map to help me get out of them! ;)
Malfoy looked terrified whilst Harry mumbled to him, words inaudible to the rest of the class.
Harry whined. “But Drayyyyyyy. I don’t wanna,” he said whilst giving his boyfriend he best pout he could.
Chores: 40 lashes and 2 beatings form Dudley
I laughed. "Mione, the floor was covered in rose petals! I literally just finished clearing them up. I hope you don't mind, I borrowed one of your spare bags." Her eyes lit up. "Oh no, Har that's okay!"
"Depends. What do you want me to do?" He asked with a little hum at the end.
A/N - okay, so. Thoughts? Please don't mind my red face and ignore my embarrassment at actually posting a chapter when Drarry is getting more comfortable with each other. It is so weird writing smut like scenes when I'm not male and have no sexual experience lol. All my knowledge is from sex ed classes (fuck these classes - go away Sally) or reading Drarry smut... eh.
3. HE DIDN'T EVEN KISS ME. The only time he has touched me was to kick me under the table!
"Poor guy, Harry would never love him back."
He grins coyly at me.
Harry completed the charms and started to wrap the flowers up. "Say, it's been ages since I last saw you... and although we arent friends... we did get along more in our eight year. So I was wondering... if you want to go get coffee sometime?" Draco asked hesitantly, shuffling his feet on the sodden mat. Harry was taken aback. He thought about it for a moment before replying. " 'Course! That sounds great. I open the shop at 0830 in the morning and close it for a 30 minute break for lunch at around 1230. I close up for the night at 1900, but that can always change. So whenever you're free around those times I'd be happy to go out for a drink with you." Harry smiled brightly at his customer.
"Draco. You are not a Death Eater. Not any more. People recognise that! When was the last time you were shunned or hexed in public? When was the last time you were spat on just for existing? And just now doesnt count." Harry reminded.
"What did I do wrong Draco?" He whispered.
The Dark Lord sighed and looked down. Severus patted his knee in comfort and Tom looked back up to Fenrir. "Why? Why did you help him?"
Draco gapes at me.
She crept towards the bed, hidden in the shadows. One head had a mop of dark curly hair - Harry. The other head was platinum blond and cut short. It looked like a dudes head to be honest. Carefully, she peeled back the covers.
Harry remembers his reaction when he saved him in the second task. He just sat there, staring at harry, gobsmacked, blushing furiously and silently seething (his hair was all dirty now. Bloody lake). He was obviously feeling so many feelings at once he didn’t know what to do about it.
"What the fuck just happened?" Blaise demanded.
"You'll what?" Draco scoffed.
I slowly felt myself falling asleep, already planning ideas and colours for our matching boyfriend bracelets.
Draco and Harry just looked at each other in fear, who was this imposter and where is their teacher?
I miss My Love.
"Fuck yes," breathed Draco before slamming his lips down onto Harry's.
"DAD!" Draco yelled in mortification, hiding his face in his hands. Harry burst out laughing. "Dray, you practically asked for him to respond with that!" "Shut up Harry!"
"You two do not know how much this made my day!" he said whilst grinning from ear to ear.
"When you go out of your room, you turn left-"
"Nothing to say? Well, if not, I am finding Draco's room and I am going to pound him into the bed. I have missed my husband you know."
"Move boy." Harry trudged over to the car and pulled his trunk into the boot. He slid into the passenger seat next to his fat whale of a cousin and stared out of the window until they reached the house. He sighed, this was going to be a long summer.
Draco smiled at the Gryffindor. "Yes, Harry, really. Your mine now and I'm yours, I swear."
Soon enough, Harry and the ferret were whispering, louder and louder their voices came. Soon it became unbearable.
"I've never had a room so beautiful. What does yours look like?"
I hope you liked this @Hufflepuffpride13!! I loved writing this. I hope you didn't mind me putting the photos in, they helped describe the gifts from Draco to Harry.
"Well," Tom said, "Are you going to open it? What does it say?"
Does she know it's me? Is that why she is ignoring me?
Back chatting: 25 lashes and fire burns
I woke up to just a note on my bedside table beside my glasses. I pulled them on and picked the note up.
So please, comment, vote, share, kudos(what platform am I on again?! XD) and save in you libraries! That would be lovely 🥰🥰
‘I just want to love you.’
The crowd around them had increased now and many looks of confusion were worn as they saw the Golden Boy in the Slytherin Princes arms.
It was dinner, and Draco was sitting at the end of the Slytherin table, closest to the door. He wasn't feeling very hungry and was playing with his food with his right hand. His left was holding his chin up as he looked around the hall.
Lucius had bought all of Harry's books and was now in Gringotts making sure Harry's accounts and vaults were all secured. Whilst he was there, he did admin on his own vaults to protect them from old, manipulative, senile men. Once finished, he followed his Point Me Spell to his wife, child and his childs soulmate.
Chapter 6
So much.
Draco Malfoy could never be his in any way shape or form.
I hope she does.
~ Jaz
After all, it must take a lot of trust to fall asleep in your supposed enemy's arms, right?
Chapter 5
"Ah, Unspeakable Potter. I have a job for you."
"So, when they red ball exploded, that removed my pain?" Harry asked. "Yes child. That is exactly what it did." Harry bit his lip thoughtfully. "If I get hurt again, would it heal like that again?"
And a final one, I'm thinking of keeping Drarry as switches. No specific top or bottom and everyone is happy. No fights pwease 🥺
"Who would marry you?"
- If 5 things are broken, 2 days no food and 10 lashes of the belt
He acknowledges us with a tilt of his head and the Malfoy smirk on his lips. “Hello Potter. Weaselette.”
"And!"
Draco giggled slightly with a wide smile on his face. "You can pick the name today." he said, sobering up pretty quickly.
A cough pulled them out of their lust induced haze and they blushed heavily. "Hot but seriously. Leave that to the bedroom boys. Please. I don't really want to see my son ravishing his future husband in front of me." Begged Draco's father. Narcissa and Severus giggled and Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust. "Bleugh, father please don't call us making out hot." "If you wish," Lucius said smirking.
"Yes Dragon, that is the other plan for today. Play dress up with Harry. You can pick his clothes, if that's alright with Harry of course." She looked at Harry before being startled by Draco's shout of "Fuck yes!". A fist pump into the air accompanied this exclamation, making Narcissa frown and Harry giggle.
"You may look now." Harry whispered.
Drop anything ~ 2 days no food {total: 42 times}
(See the end of the chapter for
Thank you, for taking the time to read this letter. Like I said at the beginning, you don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes.
"Shut up you prat." Draco said and slapped Harry on the arse lightly with his shirt.
My Love can though. He can pull off anything. Even my clothes!
Harry lifted his head up and looks the enraged red head straight in the eyes. “Well, yes. That was exactly what I was doing.” He said with a sneer gracing his heart shaped face.
The dog launched itself at Draco who just managed to catch it and started to lick his face. "Ugh! Ew! Bad dog- Bad dog!" Draco spluttered as he tried to push his bouncing companion away. The dog ceased immediately, and sat down looking ashamed and embarrassed.
Pushing the tissue paper away I almost dropped the box in shock.
Please come to my office. We must speak about your living arrangements when you return home.
"Hey Draco, I know what to get you for your birthday!" Harry said.
Pansy gasped, pointing a finger at me. "Your thigh highs...." she whispered. I gasped too. "My thigh highs!!! Oh that will be perfect!!" I squealed.
Harry released all the breath in his lungs as he fell to the floor with a weight on his chest. As he looked up, he saw 2 words on the ceiling:
Draco glared at Ron and shifted Harry into a more comfortable position in his arms. “If you must know Weasel, it is none of those.”
He scowls at me before replying.
He is obviously coming to save his damsel in distress, me.
Harry frowned. "But how does kissing me deal with him?" Remus sighed and rolled his eyes. "Well cub, Draco was staking his claim on you so the owner would know your off limits. It was quite a smart idea to be honest." Draco beamed at the compliment from his old Professor.
Once the young soulmates were before the big glass windows of the required shop, Draco halted and grinned at Harry mischievously. With no warning, Draco wrapped his hand into the front of Harry's - no
"Hermione! Look! She looks so cute!"
Okay, what the fuck?
Ron’s eyes widened and a snarl escaped his lips as he bashed Harry’s petit frame against the wall. His head took most of the impact and the result was a sickening thud. Draco gasped as Ron lifted him up to do it again.
: HARRY JAMES POTTER, YOUNGEST SEEKER IN A CENTURY, HANDSOME, BIRDS NEST FOR HAIR, DORKY GLASSES, PITIFUL FASHION TASTE, GOLDEN BOY, BI WHO LIVED AND DRACO'S CHOSEN ONE
Pansy, Hermione, Ron and Blaise stood there, some smirking and some looking green.
I smiled at her before holding out the boxes. I have no words. I can't speak. I am shocked. She did like me!
After a while of silent contemplation on various subjects in various minds, Draco spoke up. "You called us down? What for?"
A way to remember whom you love but cannot have, to remember them in the worst of times but to also remember what you want is impossible, to know your love is unrequited.
Ron flushed red. “What. Did. You. Just. Say. To. Me?” he asked in a dangerous tone.
Harry blushed, "Um well, Malfoy-Potter, cos Draco is hotter obviously."
"Ah, Harry my boy. Good to see you. How have you been?" Harry was assaulted by Albus' voice as he stepped through the doorway. He did not reply immediately, instead taking time to survey the room around him with cold eyes. The desk was still in the middle of the room, and shelves lined the walls with an assortment of objects decorating them. Fawkes sat on his perch watching Harry with a warm gaze and Albus sat behind his desk, hands on the table fixing Harry with his twinkling eyes.
"Can I put it in your hair for today?" Hermione asked after a few minutes of silence. I nodded eagerly making her chuckle. I turned around and she set to work weaving it into my hair. When she was finished, I admired myself in the mirror before gasping at the time. "Mione! Breakfast! We are going to be late!"
Ron gaped and scoffed. “You love him? But you don’t even know him!”
The adults were in the living room, discussing Harry's safety for when he returned to Hogwarts. They were bouncing ideas back and forwards but could not find the perfect idea. They wanted to protect Harry and Draco's relationship from the Light side but at the same time, they wanted to exploit its uses. A chime from the floo brought the adults back into reality as their eyes registered a pair of men standing in the middle of the room; one smirking and confident, the other blushing and more awkward.
Fenrir shuffled his feet and sighed looking down at the ground. "It was the first week of July? I think? And, I was in Knockturn Alley looking for some stuff when I was approached by a child. The child was covered foot to head in soot from a fireplace. They had obviously said the wrong word when stepping into the floo." He broke off, looking at Harry asking him how much he wanted to tell them. "You can tell them everything Fenny." Harry's voice soothed his fears.
Sixth year, well, sixth year was when shit hit the fan. I obsessed over them, I couldn't care less if anyone found out we were dating. I just wanted them to be safe.
When Draco settled down again, Harry breathed out a sigh of relief. He pulled his flag more securely around his shoulders to make sure it doesn't fall and wake the sleeping Slytherin, and slowly leaned down towards Draco's face. His eyes wide open, heart hammering as he took in the sleeping boy below him. Face relaxed, beautiful eyelashes stroking his cheek as he dreamed, lips partially open as his breath rushed out of them.
Draco hummed lightly before frowning. "Speaking of relatives, why did they hurt you?" Harry sighed. "Ask the hard questions first why dont you?" Harry teased. "When I was orphaned, I was left with my muggle relatives. That was the first mistake. Petunia was jealous of my mother. She hated her sister and despised magic. It was a wonderful thing she could not weild. From the very start I was bound to be neglected by her. Dumbledore, however, anticipated this and ensured it would happen by paying them to abuse me. He wanted me broken, easy to manipulate and manage for his own uses and plans."
Once everyone was served, they ate in silence. It wasn't awkward, it was a comforting silence. The silence was broken when Tom cleared his throat after taking a sip of his wine. "We should talk about what happened yesterday."
I admit, I am being slightly hysterical but the prick deserves it.
"Well! Let's go save the Saviour of the Wizarding World!!" Narcissa yelled before apparating to Little Whinging. The others followed with Draco side apparating with his father. Four sharp cracks could be heard in the quiet hamlet.
Harry sighed. "Okay what is it?"
‘I just want to love you.’
"Mother, if we are not going to get clothes for my beautiful soulmate, I am not leaving this bed until tomorrow." Draco grumbled sleepily at his mother and she looked on in amusement as Harry, still sleepy, flushed from his words.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Harry nodded. "Yes, we are clothes shopping for me. We were about to walk in but Draco kissed me and... then..." The raven haired blushed furiously as he remembered exactly what just happened. Sirius snorted and Draco just smirked. "The owner of this shop is a flirtatious prat who takes a shot at anything that moves. I swear I saw him flirting with an owl once. That was amusing."
Harry grinned at scribbled a reply before sending it off with his new owl, Hestia.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Did she send you a letter?"
It was Draco Malfoy. The Death Eater!
Feedback would be lovely, especially constructive criticism!!
She looked over to my bedside table. "What's that?" She asked, pointing at the red box from earlier.
I asked her who she thinks my courtier might be. She wasn't sure, but she suggested someone with lots of money. Ron thinks it is his sister, Ginny. She had a crush on me for like, two years but she is now dating Luna. He doesn't know! Shhh!
"Well..." Hermione said.
"But why is living together rare?" Harry said, voicing the question Draco was thinking. Tom sighed. "As I said, soulmates can only find each other when one is in immense pain. Most of the time, this pain they feel was due to a fatal injury such as a stab wound. The soulmates would recognise one another. They try to bond quickly but most bond too slowly to prevent the death of the other. The pain of being apart from your soulmate once you find them tears you apart and the sadness makes you kill your self. It is unbearable and I hope you never have to feel it. That is why it is so rare." The room was filled with a dull, gloomy silence.
Once Draco got there, at the top, on the floor he saw 2 words.
He kisses me on top of my head before stroking my hair with a huge, calloused hand.
Severus stopped and glanced at his guests. "If I were you, Severus, I would read the whole thing. There's no harm in that, is there?" Narcissa assured him. Lucius was next to her, nodding his head. "You can choose if you want to read the whole thing aloud. It is addressed to just you so we would be imposing."
Anyways. They are yelling their own names at each other! It's so weird! Like, why???
A low growl emanated from Draco’s throat. “Where do you think he disappears off to everyday then? We have been dating since 2nd year, so I am pretty sure I know him. Want proof?” he enquired with a raised eyebrow. Ron nodded.
The whole Hall is looking at us and our exchange right now. The attention is making me slightly dizzy with excitement.
Hermione squealed, "Okay, on 3 we will say it at the same time, got it?"
I always get that last one and it always makes me scoff. No, my
I took in the black, polished pointy shoes, the smart, pristine trousers and the required school shirt. I admired the way the trousers wrapped themselves around the males (for it must be a male by the way they dress) muscular legs and then I took in the school robe. Slytherin. Well, that explains the growls. I tilted my head up further to meet his eyes. Stormy grey, like a swirling pool of silver. My breath caught. Oh my. He was gorgeous and I must have made a noise because his eyes glittered slightly with amusement.
"Sureeeeeeeee."
Dear Professor Snape,
Shit now I am the one blushing profusely. God dammit.
Talking back ~ 25 lashes and burns from fire {total: 3 times}
What did you think about the shame of the Weasleys? If I was naming the chapter titles I would have this as 'Shaming the Weasley's'.
He pushed Draco onto his back and laid him down onto the table before claiming his mouth in a harsh, demanding kiss. Draco moaned almost instantly and bucked his hips up, still slightly hard from their makeout session out the front of the shop. The Gryffindor growled low in his throat before attaching his lips to Dracos neck and pushing himself down onto Draco's waiting groin.
Pansy xx
I choked on, but I choked on something. Once I had stopped dying in the middle of a Hogwarts hallway, surrounded by unhelpful students, I looked at my best friend with betrayal all over my face. "You- you
be my best friend Dray. It is a necklace my girlfriend made for me."
." Harry whispered again to Draco and Draco replied just the same: "I know."
Draco frowned. "Of course Harry, it is your room now. If you prefer, you could share with me."
One passerby hexed Mrs Weasley with a Stinging Jinx. She shrieked and jumped a mile high, much to the amusement of everyone around. She was fuming and stomped over to Gringotts with her ginger ducklings following behind.
robes - and kissed him full on the mouth. Harry squeaked in surprise before he let a muffled giggle loose between their lips and Draco smirked.
Ron sat there horror on his face whilst everyone was pissing themselves laughing.
Draco carries the smaller boy into the bathroom and strips him. He places him in the bath and fills it up with water. Slowly, as to not damage the wounds further, he washes the sleeping boy and cleans him from all the mud and blood. As Draco washed him, he found the scars left behind oh Harry’s skin making him want to cry. He also found scars on his wrists, suggesting Harry self-harms. He made a mental note to ask him about it when he was better. Once Harry was clean, Draco gently dries him with the fluffiest towel he can find and dresses harry in some boxers and one of Draco’s long shirts. As the boy is small, it works like a nightie and Draco thinks Harry looks adorable in it. He carefully picks the still sleeping boy up and places him on his bed. He gets in himself and curls around Harry, putting him in a protective and warm embrace and Draco slowly falls asleep with his face buried in Harry’s curls.
Tom took a deep breath before dipping his face into the water. Severus and Lucius then followed. "Are you sure you want me to see Harry?" Narcissa asked quietly. Harry nodded. "Of course! Draco and Fenny too."
"Wait! Potter slapped your arse so you kissed him?!?!" She asked astounded.
They come back in later bringing in breakfast and see Draco making Harry as comfortable as possible, making a nest around harry with the bed sheets. Harry pouts when he realises Draco is outside the nest and wants Draco inside. Draco sees and starts to panic because Harry is looking sad and he does not know what he did wrong. Harry shyly asks Draco if he can come in and join him and Draco gives a sigh of relief when he realised that was why Harry was pouting. He sits next to Harry and pulls him onto his lap stroking his hair and Harry just gives him a cute, adorable smile that makes Draco realise that he would do anything, anything, for this boy. Just to see him smiling that smile (preferably at him) again, just to hear him giggle, just to see him blush and get all shy and flustered.
"#DRARRY IS REAL!" he yelled, arms wide open, head back as the whole school looked at each other in bewilderment. Had their Professor finally gone nuts? Did the potion fumes finally get to him?
A/N - Does not take part in 3rd year btw. Pretend Lupin came back to teach in 5th year instead of Umbitch. - HAPPY READING!
"Potter!"
“Come along potty, you have a stain on your shirt; I will take you to the bathroom and help get it off.”
They throw a bread roll at me to gain my attention.
SHIT! IT IS 09:55!!!
“I know what he looks like when he is happy or sad, angry or aroused. I know how to help him with his insecurities and his panic attacks. I know his favourite sweets, chocolates, places, people and smells. I know his dreams, his nightmares, where he wants to go in the world. Where he does and doesn’t feel safe – one place he does feel safe is in my arms and a place he doesn’t feel safe is his dorm. Just thought you might want to know.”
After the excitement faded Tom and Severus headed back to meet the Malfoys plus one.
"To come into my room, kiss me and run." Draco interrupted, slightly bitterly. Harry flinched. "Yes, but there was another thing I had to do if you woke up." He trailed off, looking at the ground.
Narcissa snickered, "Yeah Dragon, eat up!" "Mum!" Draco whined, lifting his head up off the table to scowl at her. She just grinned; smug bitch, he thought.
Okay, Wednesday morning and I got another hair accessory. It is so beautiful it makes me want to cry.
Harry scoffed. Hogwarts is his home not that blasted Muggle house. He sighed and stood up, packing his schoolwork away as he went. He walked out of the common room, down the stairs and through the castles cold corridors until he reached the Headmasters Gargoyle. "Flying Saucers" As the Gargoyle moved slowly, Harry started to get impatient. Honestly, why couldn't he have a portrait like everybody else does?
The Hogwarts potions master was in a meeting with Tom Riddle and the Malfoys in Spinners End when an owl tapped on his window.
"FENNY!!!!!" Harry yelled before launching himself at the werewolf. Fenrir soon found his arms full of Harry Potter in front of his Lord, his Lords husband and his most loyal family. Well, shit.
This is in 1st person but I wont tell you when the person changes. It will be pretty obvious who they could be lol.
"HARRY! You cant just go around replacing me!!"
"Boyfriend." Ginny whispered.
The one that only came out of the wardrobe so she could impress...
Severus stands at the doorway, looking at them and wonders what would have happened if Harry hadn’t rejected Draco’s friendship those years ago. They were rivals last time they saw one another but now they are madly in love. He wonders what happened along the way that he does not know about. He voices his thoughts to Cissa and Lucy later when the boys are asleep. They wonder too.
We have been together for 19 years, married for 13 and dated for 5 years. (yes I know, the math doesn't add up and I am so confused lol. help?) We got together in my second year.
I sigh against My Loves lips.
The blond had been back at Hogwarts for 2 months before someone saw his room. Usually he would defend it like a dragon with a lair, but this time he was asleep and didn't notice someone entering his room. Now, you would think, was he stupid enough to forget charms to keep away attackers? The thing is, he didn't. Minerva had convinced him, reassured him that no one with ill intent could enter his room as she had placed wards on his room herself. And those words held firm until this night. But who were they, and why did they wait 2 months until they could get Draco?
"W-would they symbolise something? Represent ah- a um r-relationship?" I asked timidly. Merlin I can
I scowled at Hermiones grin before walking out the dorm with a 'see you at breakfast' yelled over my shoulder.
"Draco... I can't eat all this. I'll be sick!" Draco  chuckled, "Well, eat as much as you can and I will finish it. Okay?" Harry sighed and nodded. Draco grinned and started to pick out his own plate of desserts piling it high. He got a few weird looks from the adults but he sniffed and glared lightly at them, challenging then to tell him to remove some. They backed off.
"Do you have the Dark Mark?"
No wonder no one loves him.
“What why?” she looks at me incredulously.
"Hermione look at her shoes!"
"Avis!"
Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy this book so far, comments, votes and shares would be lovely. xx
He pushed his shirt back down and exited the bathroom, knocking lightly on what he thought was Draco's door. A muffled, "Come in!" was barely heard and Harry hesitantly pushed open the door. He saw the room had a green theme going on, not necessarily Slytherin green, but that was there. It had a massive painting of a forest on one wall, the trees moving in the breeze. Tigers could be seen prowling around, hunting for food. Harry gasped, it was beautiful!
"I guess you have claimed me then Dray." Harry breathed, groaning as Draco bit down sharply on his collarbone. "What do you mean?" Draco replied huskily. (A/N another made up word. Go away)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Yes its true!"
"How can somethiNg be so cute yet disgusting!?!?!" Ron shouted to the heavens, as of asking them for an answer. The girls giggled and Draco chuckled at the red heads statement.
Oh yeah! Harry!!!
"Oh my god, Hermione Granger I am going to kill you." he said.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stopped. Draco smiled encouragingly. “At the start when you said it was none of those things, I was heartbroken.” Draco flinched. Harry put a hand on Draco’s cheek and he was sounding slightly breathless. “Then you kept on talking and… I think I just fell in love with you even more.” He blushed a colour so red it rivalled the Weasley hair and he smiled shyly, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck. A chorus of ‘awwws’ surrounded the couple and Draco glared at them.
The door opened and Draco appeared, shirtless, obviously just having got out of a shower as water was still on his chest. He was wearing black joggers that rested low on his hips and his hair was mussed up in a sexy way. He was holding a shirt in his hand, pulling it on as Harry stared, mouth dry at his host. "I quite agree with you, I could really do with some new shelves." Draco said, voice muffled as he struggled with his shirt.
badass. She's a literal
Rom frowned. "What do you mean I'm not angry?"
Harry was sharing a dorm with Neville for 8th year. Their room just so happened to be the biggest, no one knew why, not even Minerva. She suspected it was Hogwarts showing her gratitude at protecting her but she wasn't quite sure.
This may come as a surprise and you are probably wondering why I am writing to you. Please read the whole thing. You don't have to reply or fulfil my wishes, just read the whole letter and I will be very grateful. It will be a very long letter and I suggest you sit down with a glass of something strong. It will help – trust me."
Ah shit, that was hot.
In my pockets I have my last two gifts. Another necklace and a bracelet. I. Am. So. NerVOUS!!!
." Draco huffed a laugh, "I think it worked love." He said, carding his fingers through Harry's hair. Harry hummed, content with his life now. He could vaguely hear sniffles from the adults but a sharp voice cut through them.
Harry flushed. "No. But I want one. I know what I want but it's uh- it's a bit embarrassing."
2. He threw a bread roll at me!
Albus Dumbledore was cleaning the mess his last victim made when the alarm connected to the Dursley's went off. It always went off; it was an alarm connected to Harry and it tracked the progress of the abuse the Dursley's had inflicted. This meant it measured the amount of pain they put Harry through but this time the alarm was whining so loud it suggested Harry was dying. Albus panicked. He couldn't die now! He had plans for the boy! He had a path to follow - his fate was written in the words of that prophecy! Harry will defeat Tom and he will make sure Harry gets into a tragic accident afterwards, in which he dies, and gain his fame. That's how it will work! Well, it wont if he doesn't get a wriggle on and go save the boy's life.
"WHAT Hermione?"
Draco smiled and leant forward. He cupped Harry's face in his pale, long fingered hands and slowly, ever so slowly leaned forward, inch by inch. Harry's breath hitched with anticipation. His heart was flying laps around his ribcage, acting like it was the snitch itself. Their lips hovered near, ever so slightly brushing causing fireworks to erupt throughout their bodies.
This rejection led to harry being hated by someone he loved for 7 years. The taunts, the pain, hexes and curses. He never forgave himself for almost killing him in that bathroom the day Katie was cursed. He knew Draco was forced into all of this, so was he! He understood how Draco felt but all Harry did was push people away.
Harry laughs wetly. ‘No Draco,’ he whispered, ‘I’m okay. Really. It was a nightmare but you saved me. You pulled me out from the depths of pain and torture towards something better. You saved me from drowning in my own despair.’ Harry was full on sobbing now, so Draco stroked his hair and neck. ‘I love you. I always have and I felt like shit knowing I had hurt you in the past. I still kept on hurting you, hoping that it was just deep, ugly, vicious hate instead of love. It never worked. It made me hate myself. I mean, I had to be pretty fucked up if I was purposely hurting the one I love and have only ever loved. There was never anyone else. I tried. I tried to get you out of my head but it never worked.’
"Hmm... I suppose I have, haven't I? I have claimed your lips-" A chaste kiss was placed on Harry's lips. "I have claimed your throat-" A small nip on the largest bruise blooming on Harry's neck. "And..." Draco whispered. "And I want to claim the rest of you too."
“And then, only then can you ask him out, but you have to give about 2 years because he will complain that you don’t know him well enough and you might take him out to the wrong place. Got it?”
I look over to Snape. He looks wasted. Like literally. Is that a bottle of firewhiskey in his hand? He bloody needs it with this two prats yelling over there. Fuck,
A/N Pinterest is a great place. I got the pics from there. I never usually add pictures in like this. I hope no one minds. The fic is already over 3k and adding pictures in helped me organise sections out lol.
And that is fine by me.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re looking a disgustingly Gryffindor red today.” Draco sneers, looking at Ron with disgust.
with me?!"
Third year, my dearest helped me save my godfather's life.
"Two?" She asked. I nodded. She, once again, opened the box carefully pulling the ribbons apart and began teasing the lid up. Then, she started crying.
Neville is actually quite observant. He knows, I know he knows but he didn't tell me when I asked. Just gave me a smirk and said (quite mischievously!) "You wont be disappointed!" then winked and walked off leaving me more frustrated than before.
"1..."
1. He didn't even tell me he was coming.
Remus noticed Draco's thunderous expression and smiled knowingly. "Hey, cub, might want to get back to your boyfriend..." Harry turned around to look at Draco who was trying and failing to paste an innocent look onto his face. Harry giggled before throwing himself into his soulmates arms. He kissed Draco hard on the mouth and discretely squeezed Draco's bulge making the blond want to take him right there and then.
The whole school yelled and screamed in excitement before lifting the boys in question up onto shoulders until they met on the top of a table. Their schoolmates then started to chant:
Draco ignored it and continued up the stairs and walked onto the Tower. Harry followed cos why not?
"Someone with no taste."
“Oh fuck!” I whispered. My eyes were wide and I was trembling so much I needed the table for support. My legs felt like a jelly jinx was used on them. I couldn’t stop shaking.
~Jaz xx
The two teens spluttered and blushed furiously. "NO!" They yelled in unison. "We had separate showers father, I will have you know. And please, get your heads out of the gutters, it is highly indecorous." Draco said, embarrassed about his misbehaving family.
Incomplete chores ~ 20 lashes of the belt and a beating from Dudley {total: 28 times}
Draco cooed before kissing Harry on the head. “I literally could not survive without you, Harry. I love you so much to ever let you go.” He admitted with a soft smile. “Now, come on. Let’s get you to the infirmary shall we?”
"What is a horcrux?" Neville asked.
Draco Malfoy.
Draco had Harry pinned to the sofa and relished in the moans he tore from the boy as he assaulted his ravens neck. Biting, sucking and kissing resulted in leaving enormous hickeys adorning Draco's soulmates throat as staked his claim.
Draco winced remembering his time he spent under Hermione's fist in 3rd year. "Yeah, weasley, be glad she doesn't punch you. She knows how to punch for sure." He said looking at Hermione with respect. Beside him, Harry snorted in memory.
Back to HARRY 
into here like you own the place and
Tom had found the other two muggles in the living room watching the TV. Well, they must have been before they heard the whale's screams. He trussed them up by the fireplace and set it alight. He left them there to be burned alive and relished in their screams of terror and pain. As he walked back to the hallway, he found the two younger boys encased in a golden light, Narcissa watching with a gooey expression on her face, Lucius had just spat in the fat muggles face and Severus was looking into the cupboard under the stairs.
JUST READ IT WHILST I HIDE MY FACE IN MY HANDS.
"Oh yeah? So why was Harry taking your shirt off?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Draco..."
"HERMIONE WHY IS SHE LOOKING AT ME!!!"
Being stuck in his cupboard with nothing to do makes one think. And thinking is a dangerous thing. Harry, is thinking about his sexuality. Dangerous to think about. Better stop before he starts picturing himself with Crabbe or Goyle. I mean he sees himself with Draco Malfoy anyway but that doesn't matter – nobody needs to know that, especially Draco. Not like Draco would ever love him back... right?
It was beautiful. There were separate strands of lights in the ball, which were green and grey. At the centre, you could see Draco and Harry but they weren't alone. There was an angry sphere of red too and it was pulsing. It was coming from Harry but the light was attacking it. Small bits of red came from Draco too but not much. The green and grey strands from the circle started to wrap around the red ball of light, making a shell. They then started to squeeze causing the boys to gasp in pain but the red ball was disintegrating. This went on for about 2 minutes before Harry screamed in pure pain and the ball exploded outwards.
Two shrill screams of excitement exploded from the library signalling Operation: Malfoy-Potter was a go.
"– what they are I do not know and do not ever wish to find out. For the first 10 years of my life, I didn't have a bedroom. I lived in the cupboard under the stairs – I kid you not. It was always dark and cold. There were spiders and the occasional cockroach. Being a lonely young boy, naturally I made friends with them. I haven't ever had friends when I was younger, so when I came to Hogwarts and Draco insulted Weasley I decided I didn't want to get to know him. I regret that now but I do not know how to bring it up with him. Do you have any suggestions? I just wish to mend bridges I should've crossed years ago." Tom looked over to Draco who was staring at the wall with a small smile across his face. The adults gave each other knowing looks.
Not long after Severus started to clap everyone was clapping, whooping and hooting. They clapped the Weasleys out of Gringotts and down the street, everyone joining in no matter whether they knew what had happened. All they knew was that they wanted to Weasleys gone.
Vernon was trying to breathe but he couldn't; it was like the fire had spread to his lungs. He started coughing or at least tried too. It was quite hard with a teenage boy on his chest. He could feel blood on his back and chest and wondered where it came from. He was vaguely aware of other screams in the background but the pain in his body was excruciating. His veins felt like they were boiling. Was this how lobsters felt when they were boiled alive?
Chapter 1
It means I can't go and see my spouse.
As one, they silently and gracefully walked over to No. 4. Lucius rapped on the door with the head of his cane and stepped back. A yell was heard from the other side of the door. "BOY!" Severus whimpered. Tom growled, Harry hadn't been lying. The door creaked open and a skinny, pale boy answered the door. His raven coloured hair covered his eyes slightly which had widened when he saw who was there.
"Does it hurt as bad now? Or do you feel like it is unbearable even knowing what she had done. She hasn't cheated just once. She has cheated many times on you. How do you feel now?" Harry sighed. "It doesnt hurt as much as it did when I found out. It felt like my world had shattered when one of the girls told me. Now it's just a throb on my chest making me angry because how daRE SHE?! I loved her! How could she just throw away something as special as love? I know I had a shitty childhood and I didnt get any love. But surely I deserve that now?"
I cough into Harry's shoulder.
She skipped over happily but she looked really nervous. When she saw me her face lit up. Pansy and Blaise must have been right. She does like me?
Draco titled his head up with a hand. "And that is?"
Severus and Tom stayed to the side to watch how this encounter was going to play out. Molly had marched straight up to the nearest goblin and demanded why she could not pay for anything. Goblins hate wizards and witches who just
Malfoy stands up before slamming his hands on the table in anger.
Draco blushed. "D-do you have a gay name?"
"Okay so, today we will be learning the Avis charm! Can anyone tell me what this charm does?" Professor Flitwick pointed to Hermione who had her hand up, shaking it madly. "Yes Miss Granger?"
Potter had come up to him two days after school had started. Draco expected a fight, but was shocked to say the least when the Gryffindor pulled him into his arms. Draco considered squirming and fighting but he was too cold and Potter was warm. Fuck, he was hot – in both senses of the word.
I nod in reply.
When the heat of the charm settled on me I saw a person in the distance walking my way. It was Harry!
"Have you called a truce?"
Draco flushed red. ‘Um, well… I would rant about you. Everyday. It must have annoyed them so much that they just wanted to shut me up so as a joke, they said I loved you and was crushing on you. It made me stop short and I didn’t finish my rant as I was too busy looking at them gobsmacked that they could even say anything like that to me. I must have scared Blaise and Pansy as they just saw me standing there, getting paler and paler and they shook me to get me out of my stupor. They said it was just a joke and they could not believe I had taken them seriously. After I reassured them that I was okay, I sat down and then I started to think. And think. And think.’
