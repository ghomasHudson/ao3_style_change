“Help me take off my jeans, then. My hands are sticky.” Harry laughed heartily as he held up his hands, moving off the bed to make it easier for his trousers and pants to slide to the floor.
Fortunately, we gain an early lead. We’ve been playing well throughout the tournament, and it shows. I scan the stands near where I know Hermione and Ron are sitting, even if they’re too far away for me to see the details of their faces. They can’t stay for the night, but just knowing my family is there, cheering me on, helps.
Harry counted to ten and hoped the throb in his temple would fade before he joined the impromptu task force meeting.
Harry took the opportunity to tap Malfoy’s shoulder, feeling the Warming Charms that were woven into the fabric of the blond’s robes.
“Me and Blaise. Then we realised there would be another heist in Paris. We knew with our skills we could get the necklace out first. So we did. As a test run… and it worked. Then, Boston, Egypt and now here. It was the right thing to do. Of all people, you should get it!”
The entire day he marvelled at the closeness of the siblings. Being an only child, his parents had doted exclusively on him. He didn’t know how to follow the casual banter or the retellings of stories from decades before.
And then a whistle blows. I watch the familiar golden streak fly into the air, and my world shrinks to me and that winged gold.
The sun rippled over the water as families and couples enjoyed the late afternoon of a summer day. Some people walked along the sand or sat under rented chairs and umbrellas. Other Muggles played football and volleyball; Draco had never seen either sport before and kept asking for the rules as they watched.
The letter came up clean, so he cautiously opened it and scanned for the signature… Hermione Granger. His eyes immediately jumped back to the top of the note, desperately needing to know what was written.
I send the note fluttering off to HR and turn my gaze to Harry. I slowly, suggestively, run my hand up his thigh. His eyes darken with anticipation.
Master Malfoy is shaking. I’ve used up almost all my energy. It’s up to Master Potter to comfort and protect him now.
Of course, the Magpies players enthusiastically greeted Harry (and were visibly less excited to see Draco, even though the team knew who had donated the new training and exercise facilities). Now that they were friends, Draco had grown accustomed to the hero-worship Harry often experienced within the Wizarding community. Not that Harry noticed the casual flirting and batted eyelashes.
“You bring joy to kids all around the world with your stories.  You write to bring hope and teach acceptance.  You’re literally shaping a generation,” Harry would say if he were here.  I can’t understand how he sees terrible things every day and still has so much optimism.
After changing, he headed towards the river, letting the rhythm of his heartbeat and his footfalls fade into the background as he passed by Muggles and wizards alike enjoying the Esplanade. He could finally breathe again after the oppressive stress of a mission.
“Do you see me riding motorcycles with and kissing Thomas down the hall?” Draco scoffed at the thought. “So there.”
“Draco, I’m... good.” Harry panted out the words against Draco’s lips, and it took Draco a few seconds to register what they meant. He was torn between desperately clinging to their current connection and moving on.
Harry nodded, and Draco called over a server to bring an extra glass and pour a serving. Three pairs of eyes watched with rapt attention as Draco winced when Harry took a swig without even sniffing it first. Harry then wrapped his hand around the bowl instead of the stem, and Draco’s face paled further. He loved the wizard, but not his lack of wine etiquette.
out loud.) No one’s life depends on the outcome today, but I desperately want to win. I want to savor that feeling of victory. There was too much grief to rejoice in the end of the War, but if we win this? It’ll be pure, unadulterated joy.
He spat the name of his former captain, then forcefully pushed the door open, stalked out, and disapparated.
This pregnancy is worse than the last.  I can’t breathe properly.  I can’t sleep.  I haven’t had sex in days.  It isn’t because I’m huge (although I am).  It isn’t because I can’t even see anything anymore below my belly (although I can’t), nor is it because Harry isn’t up for it (he always is).  I’m often too exhausted, or we get interrupted.
He savoured the melange of flavours on his tongue, especially the earthiness of the roasted beets. The vegetables were high quality and harvested at peak ripeness.
He laid back on the sofa, arm thrown over his eyes as he thought through the little actions that Harry did for him without asking—the pastries and coffee (even though Harry preferred tea), the way he colour-coded his notes the same way as Draco, and how he had even left his job.
When Harry got home, he immediately walked to the bathroom, stripped, and drew a bath for himself. It was his first actual break after days of long hours, and he was determined to enjoy it. Worse, he would leave for Cairo in the morning to review the crime scene, so it promised to be yet another long day.
“Your hair is the same shade as your cousin’s favorite. Teddy Lupin. He’s my godson, y’know. And a Metamorphagus. Your mother and Andromeda have been taking care of him.”
Pansy then had the gall to complain about taking an international Portkey because it was “rough on her delicate constitution.” (Draco had tried not to snort when he’d heard
placed bets on when the oblivious pair would eventually become a couple. Blaise had bet a month, Pansy two months, Neville four months, and Ginny six. The former Slytherins had apparently scoffed at the timeline their significant others had painted, then horrified as the weeks had passed by. In the end, Neville was closer than Ginny and won 60 Galleons.
“Are you sure, Harry? Rumour has it you’re likely the next Head Auror when Robards retires.” Kingsley’s voice was one of the many that expressed disapproval and concern.
Without fail, the next morning, we’d wake up in one of the dingy rooms above the bar, blindly rummage around for bottles of Hangover Cure on the bedside table, and head back to our own homes to send off an owl to ask an expert.
“How do you know he doesn’t hate me? Has he told you?” Draco asked. He hated himself the minute the words left his lips because he saw realisation dawn on Blaise’s face.
His eyes scanned the sky, then caught sight not of the Snitch, but of Harry. Harry’s eyes were wild, his messy hair blowing up in the breeze, and his top dark with sweat and clinging to his body. His grin was unreserved, and he laughed, seemingly not at anything in particular but out of sheer joy.
“I can talk to the hotel staff and get it changed,” Draco offered, hoping Harry did not hear his disappointment.
Harry vanished it. Draco groaned, seeing the wiry curls of hair smattered over Harry’s well-defined chest. He ran his fingers over the muscles, watching as Harry’s abdomen contracted at the touch.
“There are some very promising NEWTs students this year, but mostly it’s a lot less exciting than when we were students.”
That flight to get Neville’s Remembrall was the first time I had felt like I was good at something. Good for something. Coming back to that years later was a glimpse of the childhood the Dursley’s never let me have.
“You know,” Draco drawled as he pushed the head in and paused, making Harry cry out impatiently. “I may need to teach you more about the
prettily. And fuck, am I here for it. That flush travels slowly down his pale neck as he thoroughly tries to avoid me.
Harry had imagined that first kiss many times and always as passionate and heavy. Sweet was unexpected. If they weren’t in public, then he would have gone back in for the second kiss to see if the passion would flare or if he could unlock more of the first’s vulnerable innocence.
“Yeah. I talked to Hermione a few days ago, and she said she contacted Blaise to review the spells he uses. She was impressed and called it the magical equivalent of “hacking.” Everything seems to line up except I’ve found no mention of VILE anywhere in the DMLE archives.”
He only had 5 minutes to finish the mission and counteract the wards. He listened to Blaise’s suggestions on how to disable each charm. The first few fell quickly, but the red turned out to be harder to break through.
“I never give up and neither does Harry. He has been practically living at the Ministry, going through records of Vernon and trying to connect locations and other companies that might be involved. If they use the VILE acronym twice, they probably use it more than that.” Hermione’s words were sharper than he expected, and he felt the sting of shame.
I want to be angry at Draco, but I can’t be upset about him being scared about how our children will perceive him in the future.  I wish he could see what I see, and what I’m seeing now: a child that idolizes his Daddy.
Four masked figures in black robes appeared with the telltale crack of apparition. Harry’s heart raced. The masks were not the same as the Death Eaters had worn, but the similarities were too close to be a coincidence.
He idly wondered if he would face the thief in the red hat today and what it would mean if they took the diadem just to give it back again. In the last three weeks since the return of the Salem Ring, the artefact from Egypt had been returned, but not the pieces from the first two heists in London and Paris. No one on the task force had an explanation for what had changed between the first two heists and the last two.
Tipsy and after wanking in the shower as surreptitiously as possible, he curled up only a few feet away from his half-naked crush. In bed.
He chose to disregard Theo’s incredulous tone as he turned the idea over in his mind. Hotels already prepared for romantic situations, like honeymoons, so a holiday would be perfect. But where?
Finally! He spotted the well-worn corner of the map he had been searching for and pulled it out, causing a small landslide of papers. He sighed. Today was not his day.
Breathe in. Breathe out.  I pull up the memory I usually use to cast a Patronus: our wedding.  I try to infuse that happiness in my smile.
Then I hear his voice again, “Draco, hi.” My name comes out rough on his lips. Gravelly. Like it did when he had just woken up from our night together.
He leaned over to check Harry’s progress and found an unanticipated problem with this exercise. Was that squiggle how Harry saw him? What did blue represent? Or purple? Were those colours good? Bad? Indifferent? Was green a reference to Draco’s former house?
I wait until I’m back in London to send the first letter, which starts a chain of correspondence (mostly on my end):
“You’ve been rearranging the straws for the past ten minutes, even though they’re indistinguishable. How much more cleaning can you have left?”
“Sorry! Sorry! I’m late!” Harry dropped his messenger bag on the ground and leaned over to kiss Pansy and Ginny on their cheeks. He nodded at Blaise and rested his hand on Draco’s shoulder as he stood. “Where’s Nev?”
Harry is too good — I used to resent him until I learned that he really is just maddeningly noble.  He helped me navigate the trials after the war, vouched for me, and extended an offer of friendship.  He even chose a profession to keep others safe and has risen through the ranks to become Head Auror.
“If you didn’t think of today as a date, that’s okay. I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable. I just thought... a film and dinner is one of the most traditional Muggle dates, and so I assumed you meant it as... yeah.” Harry’s voice trailed off as he spoke. He looked down and tried to pull his hand back, but Draco wouldn’t let go.
He ignored Harry’s questions as they sped towards the exit. Cars and black cabs rushed by. Across the busy street was a park, so he waited impatiently for a lull in the traffic to cross.
After a year of dating, their communication had improved, which Draco credited to their very active sex life. Both were willing to be accommodating, within reason, which meant negotiating and talking about boundaries and desires regularly.
Harry shot off three spells in rapid succession towards the two men closest to the bride and one to shield himself.
“Hi Draco, and is that... Harry Potter? I’ll introduce you to the team.” Draco’s former captain waved and walked over. Draco turned to peer over his shoulder at the mention of Harry.
Harry looked down at the floor again. “It’s just… I can’t believe how much I’ve missed. Ron, Hermione,
Harry held out his hand to Draco so they could Side-Along apparate. Draco decided not to let go first, so the two continued to hold hands as they walked up the drive to the eclectic house. He relished in the contact, the simple warmth and comfort that one hand could provide.
They both sat in silence, sipping their drinks before Neville launched into updates from his Hogwarts colleagues. It was a comforting topic and reminded Harry of their school years.
My teammate on the Tornadoes, Costa, winks and salutes as he flies past me before they settle to wait for the referee to release the balls.
And then we break our “No Relationship Talk at Work” rule, and all the warnings Hermione had given me about staying Auror partners with Draco come back to bite me. Of course she’s right.
“What do you think about the thief returning only one of the artefacts?” he asked, aiming to have his voice sound disinterested and his face neutral. Hermione’s eyebrows lifted, and he realised that tricking suspects was much easier than someone who had known him for fourteen years. She knew him better than anyone.
Neville, at least, appeared sympathetic, although his pitying glances and murmured words of encouragement made Draco feel even more self-conscious.
Blaise had his usual stony thinking face, but his annoyance showed as he crossed his arms and tapped his foot. Draco watched as Neville put a light hand on his boyfriend’s forearm.
He worked most Saturdays, so this was his opportunity to experience the everyday domestic life of a single wizard. “Opportunity” was too positive a word; the reality was unsurprisingly depressing and lonely.
,” he cast quietly to reveal the charms surrounding the ring, and he glanced at the guards to make sure they hadn’t overhead. All clear.
Having only dated Muggles since leaving Wizarding Britain, I’d forgotten how much magic could… ease getting down and dirty. (With much less emphasis on the dirty.) How had I ever lived without cleaning and lubrication spells? But Harry had applied them deftly with a lazy wave of his hand.
The large Barred Owl is staring back at me, tapping its claw rhythmically against the glass pane. Then it hoots, as if to shout at me to hurry.
How much has Draco Malfoy changed in ten years? I’m desperate to know. If a wizard who’d barely stepped foot out of the Wizarding world until he was seventeen has managed to survive as a Muggle, then surely there are more changes, deeper changes, than the ones I’ve seen.
The sun was going to set shortly, so they stopped by another stand to buy plastic cups of açaí. This time Harry bought two so he could focus on eating his own instead of how Draco’s tongue swirled around a cheap plastic spoon as he ate the cold, sweet treat.
He was about to suggest Warbeck when Harry reminisced, “Sirius loved the Clash. It always reminds me of him. With Sirius... it was the first time I really felt like I had family.”
Even though I read more now than ever before, I always feel like I don’t know exactly where to look in a bookshop. Do people just choose the prettiest covers, despite the common adage? Am I supposed to amble over to a specific section of interest? The closest one to me is “American Political Theory,” so at least that’s
I can’t get attached. I can’t allow myself to get attached. This has been just a one-night stand with someone from my past that I’ll never see again.
He tested the water. Perfect. After setting a Temperature Stabilisation Charm, he dropped in a purple bath bomb. He hadn’t understood the power of a long soak before his ex, but now scented baths were one of his favourite little luxuries in life.
Neville took off his coat, and the tight tee shirt underneath had a hole near the collar and a dirty handprint near his hip.
Rifling through the selection, my fingers unconsciously fly over most of the parcels until I feel a warm pulse when I brush against a thin package.
“Mm... I am. Now, before we head to the Burrow, I have a gift for you.” Harry grinned and handed over a box with green wrapping paper.
They worked for hours, poring over the evidence as it came in. The same glow appeared, but there was no sign of the red hat. This time, another four unidentified wizards showed up after the artefact had already been stolen. One of the wizards was caught and brought to the Egyptian Ministry of Magic, but escaped before his interrogation started.
“At the Manor,” Draco’s words come out clipped and posh as always, as though this is just something he
Draco no longer played often. He missed the rush of adrenaline, the rousing cheers, and the anticipation of glimpsing gold fluttering in the distance.
The rest of the garden was equally impressive and full of exotic plants shaped into intricate hearts. As with any high-profile event, he assumed there had been a team working on customising the entire garden for this wedding.
I’d nearly lost a finger to a Crup, been too embarrassed to be a Dom, and while I enjoyed visiting Charlie at the Dragon Sanctuary, it was too remote.
They passed a coconut vendor, and Harry bought one. They watched as the man readied the green fruit and opened it up to slip in the straw. Harry took one sip and groaned, savouring the sweet and salty flavour.
“On that note, I’ve modified my map to include the signatures of the aurors and VILE agents who have shown up so far. That way I can warn you if their magical signatures are near you. Shame we can’t get full visuals,” Blaise pivoted back to the original conversation.
Harry slowly relaxed under his gaze, watching as Draco’s eyes caressed his body. His past boyfriends and partners had been nice, but he had never trusted them the same way he did Draco.
I relish the warmth of his mouth and the variety of licks, nips, and touches that put just the right amount of pressure on the shaft.  I come quickly.
As Harry and Hermione explained the situation, Ron kept one hand on his wand and the other holding a biscuit. Occasionally he would get up and pace, not noticing the trail of crumbs he left in his agitation.
“Daddy! Daddy!” I hear our son calling for me.  I frantically wipe my face on my sleeve before Harry puts a hand on my wrist to stop me.
Another piece of the puzzle that still didn’t seem to fit was the bright red hat seen at the second scene. The security guards could not describe anything definitive besides that hat. Why a hat? Why red? Was it not one thief but an organisation with the hat as part of their statement?
“What are you going to tell me next? That you have a pottery wheel and a kiln in the next room over?”
It was his usual Friday night of burning the midnight oil with an empty carton of lo mein and the details of his latest trip strewn across the conference room table. He had expected more progress and had even reached out to Bill Weasley for contacts he knew from his former job as a curse breaker.
“It’s brilliant. Of all people, Ron will probably take it the worst, given his duty as an auror and his dislike of Draco. No offense, Draco.” He shot a small smile at the blond, who nodded. “Luna will be a calming influence, but if we can convince him, then we can convince almost anyone else.”
We walk towards the water, and Dad uses a spell that swirls gold and shows footprints heading in the same direction as we are.
He saw a glimpse of something sparkling in the light and heard an audible gasp. The bride had arrived with her jewel-encrusted diadem.
How did that magic work that it picked a book so similar to our situation even before I’d seen Draco?
The room was overwhelming: filled with balloons of all colours and at various heights, their strings spiralling down for patrons to grab onto. There were various steps and ladders so one could closely examine them and try to guess what colour powder would be inside.
His eyes drifted closed as he leaned against Draco on the couch. They had planned to go for a picnic in a nearby park as a date, but the skies opened up just when they were about to leave. Typical London. Not that Harry minded the opportunity to cuddle with his partner for a lazy day indoors.
“Smith,” Draco repeated, trying to calm his racing heart. He’d been certain he was staring in the face of a dead man. James was the spitting image of Harry Potter. “You just . . . you look like someone I know.”
“Let’s go!  I miss Daddy and he’s probably scared without us!” I grab his hand like we do when we go on adventures and when we cross the street.
I hate trips by Portkey.  It always makes my tummy hurt.  Dad rubs his hand on my back until my tummy no longer hurts after we arrive on a small street.
Harry splutters as his head bobs above the surface, pushing his black fringe away from his face, only to be splashed again as Draco slips in.
Draco laid awake in bed late that first night, his mind reeling. He listened to James’ steady breathing and wished he had some way to contact Pansy or Theo. It seemed, even after all these years, Harry Potter was still haunting him.
“Fine. I am willing to help, but anything illegal is off limits for me. I won’t destroy my career for Malfoy or Zabini. But I’ll talk to Mum about organising a dinner for everyone, and we can see what people think,” Ron relented.
With her guidance, they set up their colour schemes and set to work. Draco first covered his blank canvas with a base of a deep red, then added streaks of pink and yellow.
The former Slytherins looked equally deflated, and the room fell silent beyond the crackling of the fire. Neville looked thoughtful and was the first to recover.
Fuck. What would our lives have been like if we hadn’t been groomed to fight on opposite sides of the war? Could we have overcome our differences back then?
“You’re here,” the cab driver states, double parking on the busy street and index finger peeling off the steering wheel to point out the windshield.
Draco moved to get up, and the pain returned. He thanked Merlin that he had brought healing potions in case things went sideways. As he turned his back to Harry to walk to the emergency kit, he heard a gasp.
“No matter which name you use, you’re still you. You’re the thorn in my side from Hogwarts and you’re the one who has kept me company on what otherwise would have been a very lonely and pathetic Christmas Eve.”
Both bride and family member were incapacitated and knocked to the ground before they could scream. Before one of the thieves could bend down and snatch the diadem, an invisible force grabbed it, and it hurtled towards Harry.
While I’d spent my morning lie-in adjusting my plans for the new variable in my life: the possibility of
Harry is too overwhelmed with emotions to move: fear and embarrassment that something might go horribly wrong, excitement at the realization of his fantasy, and love for Draco.
Draco was too content to complain that they were betting on his and Harry's relationship again. Not that he could protest too much, he had bet 20 Galleons on Hermione and Charlie getting together within the next month.
His voice rings out in the space, but I pretend not to hear. I bite my lip so the question “Against who?” doesn’t slip out.
Capucine explained a bit more about the creative experience and flow states, emphasising the importance of not fretting about the details or brush strokes. She gestured to the wall of paints and recommended they choose colours that spoke to them. When Harry scrunched up his face, she’d laughed and suggested that he go with his instincts.
He saw a playful gleam in Harry’s eyes. Harry coated his fingers liberally, then used his hand to cover what his mouth didn’t, furthering Draco’s sensation of being engulfed by warmth.
When it’s time for the kids to wind down for the day, my friends leave, and I realize that if I thought meals were complicated, putting Reg to bed alone will be even more challenging.
Someday maybe I’ll tell him I’ve listened to old wireless streams of his matches. I put them on when I’m cleaning or folding my laundry and cheer as though I were there in the stands when he inevitably catches the Snitch. Because of course he does. I only listen to his victories, waiting to hear the stupid grin in his voice as he gives a post-match press conference. (Then, obviously, I picture him in that glorious bespoke suit. And out of it.)
Harry had been in the kitchen with no shirt on one of the days the blond had popped over for a visit. The auror’s chest was littered with scars, but Draco had focused more on the defined abdominal muscles. The chest hair was thick, wiry and dark, highlighting the line down to the low-slung joggers.
“Want to try a bite? I love it, but I’m not stupid enough to blunder through explaining flavours to a food critic.”
“I’ve got it. Let’s go now,” Draco whispered harshly, trying not to bring more attention to the room while he clutched the golden cup to his chest and reached into his trench coat to grab the tranquiliser gun.
He pictured the room that housed the special exhibit: the haunting paintings depicting women in dark, colonial dresses being sentenced in Muggle courtrooms, the display cases of court documents, and the carefully planned lighting. The ring was in the centre of it all, accompanied by a magnified 3-D rotating display to allow visitors to study its features and imperfections.
Harry’s hand grasps mine, warm to the touch as we descend the marble stairway, and I don’t focus on the lion sculptures or the paintings on the walls because his fingers are deliciously calloused. I’m not sure how I’ve lived without feeling that roughness against my skin for so long.
“I see you, Little Dragon. The special exhibitions wing has six security guards, two in the room with the ring. The others would need at least 5 minutes to arrive. Should be easier than the last mission,” a mischievous voice echoed in Draco’s ear as he pulled on dragonhide gloves.
understand. It was hard in the outdoor space, where sound carried differently and the guests numbered in the hundreds, but with some concentration and a few minutes of exploring the area, he spotted a trio speaking in English and a couple speaking in French. He put on his businessman smile and sauntered over to the trio.
He had seen Harry come out of the shower. While drying his hair with a fluffy towel, Harry shyly asked if he could sleep shirtless and in boxers, as he usually did. He gestured to his body, naked except for the pair of black underwear.
“So fucking eager. Should’ve done this months ago.” Harry took the head of Draco’s cock into his mouth, tongue swirling over it. Draco’s hips jerked. He wanted more dirty talk, more touching, more Harry. His fingers wrapped in the messy black hair.
Draco looked at him, at his messy black hair, his too-green eyes behind wire-framed spectacles, the charming crooked smile, his
Despite Harry’s question, he was stunned when Harry straddled his abdomen and used a cleaning charm on himself. Draco could only watch as Harry bent over him, lubricating his own fingers before using one to breach his entrance.
Finally, we arrive. Pushing my way off the train savagely, I run through the gates and bypass the escalator to take the stairs two by two.
I regret leaving my wand on the bedside table.  If I had it, I could cast a cleaning charm.  I’m too ashamed to look at the floor to see if there are any droplets or a puddle of urine.  I wouldn’t be able to bend down to clean it up the muggle way anyway.
Draco smiled his first genuine smile of the night. Only a Gryffindor would be so bold. Maybe he would be playing with fire, but what harm could one night of fun do?
It was in one of those intimate moments that I made the connection that the new Master was the same Harry that Master Malfoy had cried over during holidays away from school. Back then, he’d stare at his reflection in the sink forlornly and ask, “Why can’t we be on the same side? Of all people to fall for, why him?”
It’s true. We haven’t made love in a while. It’s not that I haven’t wanted to. It’s just that I’m tired. And never home. I feel as though pulled in a multitude of directions, and there’s not enough of me to go around. Right now, my family and friends need me. Father is ill (he was never quite the same after Azkaban) and Mother needs my support. Pansy’s going through a rough breakup, and next week is Vince’s birthday, which is always hard for Greg.
“Honestly? I like it. Let me enjoy it just a little longer.” After everything, Harry’s blush came back with his words.
This isn’t the first time I’ve had a breakdown in front of my husband, and I’m sure it won’t be the last.  He’s my rock.
“Oh, before I forget... you need to tell me if you want a ticket to Sunday’s match,” Ginny interrupted his thoughts, and Draco nodded absentmindedly.
“Draco, if you don’t stop staring at the door every five seconds, I’m going to bloody murder you,” Blaise muttered, kicking his friend under the table.
Draco left one hand on Harry’s hips while the other wrapped around his prick. He stroked roughly over and over.
I try to explain how this is an act of love and how I’m acting for the greater good.  I rub my belly for strength and reassurance.
As soon as the end credits rolled, Draco jumped up and grabbed Harry’s arm, mumbling, “We should talk.”
“I’m glad.” Draco took a swig of his Firewhiskey. He hoped the dim lighting hid his flush; if not, he’d blame it on the alcohol. If Harry noticed, he didn’t comment.
Quidditch. He and Harry had played against each other often at Hogwarts. Harry had a natural talent for being a Seeker and, had he wished, could have played professionally. Draco, meanwhile, had worked hard to be a worthy opponent but always played better against Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw when he was less... distracted.
“You know, Draco, I could use a change of scenery for the off-season. I’ve been looking into some places in Salem. Thoughts?”
I’ve cried more in the past three days than I have in years.  I feel like I’ve fallen in love with Harry Potter all over again.  Or, as he loves to correct me:  Harry Potter-Malfoy.
I miss Daddy.  He is the bestest.  He loves baking biscuits with me for my class and doing voices when he reads bedtime stories.  He’s Hugo and Rose’s favoritest uncle too.  They told me when Dad wasn’t around so his feelings wouldn’t get hurt.
Harry’s mouth twitched in an involuntary smile. “Surely you wouldn’t have been so lonely? I’ve seen how Thomas from down the hall has been eyeing you.”
They entered, and Harry let go of his hand as he was swept into a sea of redheads. While the entire family hugged and welcomed Harry, Draco stood stiff as stone in the doorway.
The embrace became closer, and their pelvises brushed. Harry moaned at the contact, cutting it off as soon as he realized they were still in public and rutting on the dance floor was not acceptable, no matter how closely some couples danced.
His father clung to the past and to the prestige their name once held. After the war, Lucius Malfoy had barely escaped a sentence to Azkaban and only did so after relinquishing many of his assets. To avoid complete destitution, his father put most of the remaining family wealth in Draco’s name. The Malfoy family’s political influence was lost as they were also stripped of their legacy seats in the Wizengamot and on the Board of Governors of Hogwarts.
“Sounds great,” Harry responded with a smile that made Draco’s heart stutter. His entire body felt lighter, and he could have sworn the wine tasted better.
They walked towards the clock tower and found the doors of the cathedral still open, as expected. They slipped in.
much.  We cried a lot because we couldn’t find you.  I had to remind Dad that it’s ok to cry, just like you said.  And Grandma Cissy and Grandpa Lucius even came over to help look.  Oh!  Dad can’t pick out pajamas right.  And he can’t make hot cocoa.  It was
When he finally returned to the table, their dessert had arrived. Harry had his spoon poised to take a scoop of the bowl of dark chocolate mousse infused with port wine and mint.
“What do you recommend, Draco?” Harry asked, not even glancing at the wine list. Draco took pride in how his friend deferred immediately to his expertise.
“Excuse me sirs, if you must be noisy, please go to the courtyard to speak. You’re causing a ruckus.” The curly haired docent smiles politely as she points towards the window, where I can see the tips of the green trees in the courtyard below.
Draco picks up the wine bottle and slams it down right next to my glass before stalking off to help other customers again.
“Love you, Draco,” he slurs and turns over to go back to sleep.  He’s snoring again within minutes.  I don’t know if he’s even aware of what he said.
“Well, Malfoy and Zabini, seeing that Harry has the only Invisibility Cloak in the world and disillusion charms would be noticed or are prevented, how’d you do it?” As always, George was available to dispel tension.
So here he was, hiding in plain sight in the United States. And he, who used to think his family could buy quite literally anything they wanted, had become a thief.
I don’t know how much time passes as I sit there, my fingers running over the words, my connection to Draco.  I’ve always been impulsive and been able to jump into action, a trait that has made me good at my job, but this time... I can’t do anything but sit and read.  Again.
Draco had been admitted as a patient at St Mungo’s after a particularly bad case of food poisoning from a trip to the jungle. Harry visited and brought a little green dragon soft toy. He’d shuffled his feet when handing over the present, claiming that he hadn’t wanted to arrive empty-handed and that it had reminded him of Draco. When Draco saw Harry’s hesitation and reddened ears, he’d known.
One of the reserve Beaters asked Harry a question, and Draco realised another problem with this attempted date: there were too many other people around. He gritted his teeth. This was another failure.
Harry was an excellent auror, but oblivious when it came to his friendships. He also didn’t seem to notice how slowly their friends walked past the windows, craning their necks to see better. Ginny gave an encouraging thumbs up when Draco looked her way.
I debate telling Harry, but I do feel better now.  I know he’d leave work immediately, but he’s already getting off early to pick up Reg today.  I don’t want to ask for more, even if I know he would happily help.
When I’d heard about being an Auror, I’d thought it was the perfect career for me. I wanted to help people. But then the nightmares started. I was chasing evil wizards and nearly dying in my dreams. Did I want that to be my waking reality, too? And the Aurors I’d thought to emulate, like Kingsley (now Minister of Magic) and Tonks (deceased), wouldn’t even be around for me to work with.
“Just a preview. I have champagne for after the festivities at the Burrow,” he whispered and pecked Harry’s lips before straightening and getting up to grab his coffee.
“But it’s Miami, so we need bright colors! We need to show some skin if we’re going to the beach. Plus, it’s your birthday, and we should go clubbing!” Pansy picked up a navy lump from Harry’s open suitcase on the floor. “Harry, is this a Weasley jumper?”
Slowly, Draco regains what little color he usually has, and his body seems to sag from exhaustion as his breathing finally evens out.
“Does it have to be so... red?” Draco complained, a little mollified by the explanation and unsure what the appropriate reaction was to a practical but hideous gift from a boyfriend.
Today we woke up together at the ungodly hour of sunrise because that’s when Harry likes to go for a run.  I usually sleep through it, but today I was up.
Dad’s head is in the fire to Floo call someone.  He asks about a trip to Spain.  When he finishes up his call, he looks surprised to see me when he turns around.
Draco pulled Harry’s face back up for a long kiss, until he felt the tension leave his body. He tugged on the hem of Harry’s jumper and murmured, “Off. Now.”
“That’s one of the flavours. When we visited Paris on holiday, my mum would bring me to that chocolatier and let me choose three. It was so hard to decide if I should get the ones I knew I liked or try something new.”
They both looked back at the sunset; Harry reached behind them to put his hand over Draco’s. While everyone else packed up and walked down the rocky slope to head to the bars or to their beds, they stayed put, delaying the inevitable.
Even though Draco loved flirting and sharing dirty stories with his friends, he was inexperienced with sex. In the moment, when clothes came off, he always felt awkward. Everything felt too dirty—literally. Over the years, he attempted a few one night stands and dates, but he would always lose his nerve at a certain point. He bought a couple toys instead and kept them so well-hidden not even a house-elf could find them.
Draco. The man was better than he remembered – sexier, taller, kinder. Maybe tonight he could cling to those broad shoulders for the first time. His cock twitched, and he was grateful that his robes hid his body’s reaction. He wondered if reality would match his fantasy.
He confided a lot in her. She was the first person to know when he started dating his first boyfriend, and she had immediately taken it in stride. Ron, on the other hand, had not taken the news as well. Not that Ron hadn’t tried to be supportive, but it took a while for him to process. He was (as Hermione would put it) his usual tactless self, with the emotional range of a teaspoon.
As I walk past the open door of my son’s playroom, I hear it: “I don’t want to be Death Eater spawn.”
But more noticeable than any of the stores are the throngs of people crowding the sidewalks, arms weighed down by bags of various sizes and colors holding the day’s purchases and extravagances.
I can’t get enough air in my lungs with each breath. As my eyes lose focus, it hits me: I’ve never quite lost that crush.
“We should still consider that they might not be working together, and maybe they were competing,” Harry offered.
Grunts of exertion and steady squelches filled the room. Sweat dripped from one body to another. Skin slapped rhythmically against skin.
As the sun set, they sat in silence while cheers erupted around them. Many brought out their cameras to capture the blues fading into oranges, pinks, and yellows. He could see the word forming on their lips—
Draco, goddamn him, has put a star on October 26th, to make up for the star we missed on October 2nd. And October 2nd was the first star on the calendar since… no… I don’t want to think about it.
The crowd roars at the spectacle, and even with the Sonorus, it’s almost impossible to hear the commentators announcing our names.
Logically, the hotel room can’t be as tiny as it feels. But the walls feel like they’re closing in on me as the potential headlines flash through my mind:
“Nice to meet you, Draco. What do you do?” Viktor asked politely. He still had an accent when he spoke in English, but it was less pronounced than when he was a student.
Subtlety be damned, he was going to do it — he would paint the outline of a white heart in the middle of his canvas. He started with a slow, intentional glide of white curving then straightening along the surface. The pressure on the bristles was too strong, and the line thickened more at the bottom than when he first set the brush on the colourful background. His inner perfectionist wailed at the inconsistency.
“Have you asked Reg for help or about places Draco’s mentioned?  If something was on his mind, he might have let it slip without realizing.”
“He went to dance with someone,” Neville said as quietly as he could to still be heard over the pounding beat. Draco shut his eyes and groaned, slumping over the table at the lame attempt to be subtle, as though everyone in their friend group didn’t know he was pining desperately for their friend.
Harry gasped as he took in the new art studio. There were three easels set up with canvases. Next to each easel was a stool and a small table with an empty palette and an array of brushes. One wall featured an array of paint tubes hanging in every hue imaginable. Another wall had hooks for two smocks — one red and one green — and a set of vertical racks for storing paintings.
I’ve known Master Malfoy since he was little and couldn’t reach the sink without a stepping stool. I’ve seen him grow up, go to school, then move out. The years without him were lonely. I thought we, Malfoy Manor, were dying then. Losing our sentience as our humans dwindled and disappeared. As the love of a family disappeared. But he came back and brought Master Potter, and WE came back, as well.
“It’s nice to spend time with just the two of us,” he commented when there was a lull in the conversation after their main course came out.
“Why leave the extra protections, then? We have virtually no leads and they know it. If the next heist is as clean as the ones before, they’ll get away with it. And the next. What if they stole it to return it?” Harry argued.
I am about to show them the letter just so they can read it for themselves and maybe there’s some message in it that I’m missing, but the letter’s missing.  I look for the trio of youngsters, and sure enough, Rose is slowly sounding out the words on the page for a captive audience.
“Fuck Potter… I’m… I’m trying. After the war, my life was shit. I had already realised all the Death Eater rubbish
Hermione was automatically co-opted into the group after she returned from completing a doctoral program at a Muggle university in America. Her focus was genetics, and she had been highly sought after by the Ministry to transfer her skills to study lycanthropy, Squib births, and rare diseases. Draco didn't understand most of her words when they discussed her work.
“Pascal here. The pink is an alarm, so disarm that first. Then, in order, lime green is for preservation, purple is for repulsion, red is for incapacitation, dark green is a general Protection Charm,” the voice came into Draco’s ear.
“Your text was filled with truly atrocious typos. I wanted to make sure you didn’t splinch yourself getting home,” Harry overheard. He looked back over at the couple as they waved goodbye and headed towards the apparition point.
“You came to ask for romantic advice from your single friend,” he dryly interrupted Draco’s explanation.
He opened it to find tickets to the Premier League: Chelsea vs Arsenal. They had started watching the games together on the telly after seeing the beachgoers play in Rio. They yelled at the screen at terrible calls and went to a local Muggle pub when their team won. Draco considered it
“We can talk to the house elves to see if Draco went to one of the vacation homes.  His favorite is the one you went to for your honeymoon in Provence,” Lucius offers.
“We’re still trying to get ahead and alert local aurors where we think major heists could occur. Given that we suspect they are British and supposing they can speak French, we are focusing on Canada, Australia, Belgium, and Switzerland.”
I pull back long enough to summon parchment and a quill. I quickly scribble out a note, my handwriting not its usual tidy script (it’s Harry’s influence—or perhaps my own need). We have the highest solve rate in our unit and a well-deserved vacation is in order. Nobody will bat an eye at us taking some time off. Maybe we’ll nip away to some place warm. Or perhaps we’ll lock the Floo and just stay in our flat. It doesn’t matter so long as we’re together.
“Cheers,” Draco raised his glass to clink the rims and take a sip. His mouth was dry from nerves. “Actually, do you remember Colour Harvest?”
Better to leave than to have the awkward exchange of, “Sex was fun and I’ll tell you we’ll stay in touch, but we both know we won’t.”
“Malfoy, it’s nice to see you. I don’t know if you remember him, but this is my fiancé, Viktor Krum.”
He shook off the thought of Las Vegas — if he and Harry were to wed someday, he wanted it to be a momentous occasion and not a drunken decision. For Harry’s sake. He was tempted, though.
Taking in the surrounding room, I realize it’s a luxury suite with period furnishings. The low hum and faint bustle below is from a city waking up. The birds chirping in the trees on the Common, angry Boston drivers honking their horns as they slowly crawl to their destinations, and I can imagine the loud swears of pedestrians yelling at those same drivers as they cross the street. Or maybe barely audible on the street below would be the steady rumble of the Green Line underground.
The rest of the evening, the conversation was awkward but less hostile as they discussed strategy. Beyond the Order, Ron suggested reaching out to other friends of Blaise and Malfoy, whose relatives could have had connections to VILE to see if further records could be found. Surely the Malfoys and Blacks weren’t the only pure-bloods involved in England.
His favourite room in the house was the smaller library, which, at least, theoretically was always supposed to be near silent. This library was a magically curated selection of works from the main library, based on the topic you desired when you entered. It was while restoring this room that he and Blaise had discovered the existence of his great-uncle.
When the brunette turned, his smile faltered, and he nearly stumbled. He knew she had attended the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum back in fourth year, but he never expected them to still be in communication. After all, he barely saw Pansy anymore, and she had been his date
He wondered if the Gryffindor would only get it if he outright admitted that his first wet dream back in fifth year had featured his enemy below him, taking every ounce of Draco’s frustration from being inexplicably bested by Potter in Potions. That, however, was a secret Draco would take to the grave.
Harry laid on the bed, the only thing his mind processed about the room, and pulled Draco down on top of him.
The speed was terrifying at first. James had reached for Draco’s hands and placed them around his waist, which made Draco blush, but he felt a bit less like he would fall off at any moment. He watched the lights whizzing by and wondered idly how long James had been using a motorcycle - whether he’d done it before he was James.
Is Harry Fucking Potter flirting? With me? I hate my pale skin because I’m sure as hell not getting tattoos on my face, so I can’t ever hide my blush. My heart is pounding with anticipation and hope.
At the end of the night, he and Neville made to leave. As they stepped into the cold London night air, cheeks and bodies warmed by the alcohol, they saw Blaise Zabini. He stood a few feet away, face lit by a Muggle mobile.
The Squid loosens its hold just enough for Draco to slide his hand between them. In concert, Draco’s hand wraps around their cocks and a slimy limb parts Harry’s cheeks to slide enticingly over his entrance. His eyes lose focus as he gasps, back arching as he calls out for more.
And just like that, I feel like I’ve been transported back to the halls of Hogwarts, as a teenager unable to understand why I just didn’t want Pansy the same way I wanted
When they arrived at the Burrow, they were the last couple to arrive. All the Weasley children had come to visit, and those with children had brought their own children, so the home was lively. He wasn’t sure if he would ever get used to the chaos, but one look at Harry, and he knew Harry felt at home.
“Did you honestly think I’d do the dinners, the paint night, the Quidditch match, and the holiday for just anyone?”
During the day, I love how he’s my Auror partner, with the highest solve rate in the Department thanks to his meticulous note taking (always written in dark green ink with flourishes on the Ds, Fs, and the Ts). We never talk about our personal life at work. It works better that way, I think.
Thrown on the floor next to the suitcase was a red fedora with a black trim, an odd juxtaposition to the neutrals of the room.
He buries his head in his hands making no move to get up and leave. His shoulders are curved in defeat.
As he got up to shower, he tried to tamp down his optimism that Harry would be at the dinner and had promised to sit next to him.
“Then they should have fucking worked with us, not against us,” Lewis stated coldly, and the rest nodded in agreement.
Instead, the sound of an accordion rang out through the room, and a smoky voice crooned, the melody swelling around him. No one saw the pair in the doorway, too engrossed in the rhythm.
I vaguely remember asking last night, “So are you really that into the national team that not only did you come all the way out here, but you ordered champagne?”
“We could, but we won’t. That’s how we lost Severus Snape, and it’s not worth it. Since Ron will still be in the Auror Department, I will resign so I can help Draco on the ground. We still have to build contacts and gather information so we can target VILE where it hurts. Since the heists have been failing, they will change tactics soon if they haven’t already.”
Draco didn’t understand Ginny’s disbelief. Where else was he supposed to paint? They would not be painting landscapes or in the impressionist style, so he didn’t fancy braving the elements and setting up easels outside.
As far as they could tell, no one suspected them, so the Order was still a step ahead of VILE. To be safe, Draco and Harry started setting up explanations for their world travelling: conferences, foundation check-ins, diplomatic missions, etc.
He had also learned to accept the casual affection Harry showed him, the light kisses on his forehead and temple which reassured him of his boyfriend’s feelings. He had never felt comfortable reciprocating, and he wondered if Harry knew how much he cared.
After every match, our coach spends the next day reviewing every move made, analyzing for flaws and missed opportunities. Most of the time, I appreciate his meticulous methods, but I’d really thought the high of finally winning the World Cup would have given me a reprieve.
He pointed his wand at the fireplace to disconnect from the Floo Network before taking a book she offered.
“Wait, Draco,” Harry whispered, “when you said you ‘met at a gallery’... you didn’t mean the Tate Modern, right?”
“I can explain,” Harry heard as he stared at the hat. He had seen that specific hat before somewhere, but he couldn’t place it. It also had to be the hat reported in Boston, right?
“Well, there has to be a catch. I told you they’re fucking playing us,” Lewis added. His partner nodded.
It was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes but he wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. “Well, there’s no rush then isn’t there?”
“Anything I need to look out for?” Draco asked, again ignoring Harry completely, except for the hand he had rested on Harry’s arm.
He then glanced around Draco’s flat. It was, of course, sophisticated. But it was also comforting, modern, and dearly cared for and lived in. He walked towards a crowded bookcase with Draco trailing behind.
“So um do you have any other plans for the weekend?” Harry asked, slightly at a loss of how to proceed now that they were in this moment. A moment he’d fantasized about for the past year yet found himself suddenly drawing a blank.
Malfoy nodded stiffly, but didn't make any move to speak or leave. "Um, how can I help you?" Harry tried in response to Malfoy's silence. "Would you like a seat?" he continued, gesturing towards the chair opposite his desk. Malfoy nodded again and sat down distractedly at the seat’s edge. He glanced down at his lap for a moment before finally looking up and speaking.
Draco Malfoy stood there with a slightly awkward slope to his stance as if he wasn't sure whether he should leave or not. Harry stood up quickly as he said, "No, no. I'm sorry. It's been... a trying day. I didn't realize it was you."
They took turns in the washroom and Draco shyly pulled a spare sleeping shirt and pajama bottoms for Harry. Slipping underneath cool, soft sheets together, Harry felt something inside himself start to settle for the first time - the parts of himself that he pushed into the darkest parts of his mind, like his cupboard under the stairs. The parts of himself that shrunk at the reminder that he grew up with no parents or family, wondering for years where he would ever belong. The parts of himself that, even after he learned about the wizarding world, still felt like the loneliest person.
“Daaaaaad! You’re not allowed to have favorites. We’re all your favorites!” James whined indignantly.
They breathed each other in for several long, reassuring moments. Finally, Draco muttered, “Your partner?”
“Another Weasley taking the Quidditch route? I guess the Cannons can use all the help they can get.”
“Well,” Ron grimaced. “I know, mate. But you need to at least ask him so you can get an answer. Or you move on.”
“You love it. And you love calling me ‘Potter,’” Harry said confidently and moved his arm around Draco’s waist.
Malfoy nodded appreciatively and they stood up to head back to the MLE offices while Harry attempted to manage the giddiness of his heart. It was a promising start, but he had been under that impression before. He wasn’t eager to relive that crush of disappointment again, but the way Malfoy kept rising and meeting Harry past his usual point of comfort gave Harry cautious hope and determination to return the favor in kind.
“Merlin, even in the middle of a heart to heart about our tragic pasts, you’re still annoying. And you keep smiling like a loon when I drag you for your utter lack of decorum during dreary date night conversations like ours,” Draco ranted, but the effect was diluted by the way his other hand stroked Harry’s arm.
Dinner was great. It was fantastic. Draco was quieter while Harry more talkative per usual, but the atmosphere was intimate, the food delicious, and the conversation flowing. Harry would ramble and Draco would offer his two cents here and there, but when he wasn’t speaking, he was quietly engaged, reacting to Harry’s words.
, Malfoy,” Harry declared before waving his wand and sending a puff of bright pink powder at Draco’s shirt, careful to avoid Lily.
Harry turned his head and took Draco’s hand and this time, didn’t let go. Draco squeezed back and they stood there silently as the photograph continued to loop and the small, crystal crup re-settled into sleep.
As Harry paid (much to Draco’s protests), he asked carefully, “Do you want to come back to my place for a cuppa?”
They Apparated to Harry’s flat (he thanked Merlin it was relatively clean). Seeing Draco stand, albeit awkwardly, amongst Harry’s things made him feel loopily warm inside. Before he let himself bask too long at the sight, he cleared his throat and told Draco to make himself comfortable while he prepared tea.
“He’s my partner,” Harry finally murmured, throwing hell to the wind. “We’d appreciate it if you kept that out of the papers, please.”
“Sorry actually wait wait,” Harry managed to get out and gently push Draco back slightly. “We were meant to take things slow!”
Gulping at nerves and pleasant surprise, Harry nodded and stepped forward to fold his body into the curves of Draco’s side and under his arm. He wrapped an arm tightly around Draco’s waist and breathed in the crisp, fresh, and warm scent of Draco’s coat and closed his eyes as the world twisted and bent around them in a snap.
They appeared in Draco’s living room. Harry held onto Draco for a couple moments longer than necessary as they balanced the landing, taking advantage of their height difference and the way the top of Harry’s head tucked under Draco’s cheek.
“Let me be clear, whichever one of you is causing me the least amount of grief and clean up, is my favorite,” Draco provoked with a smirk. “And right now, that’s your little sister.”
“If I’m extra careful,” Harry started, clearing his throat. “Maybe I’ll be around for the rest of our lives.”
“Thank you, Potter… for trying to be careful but I know what you’re like. But… I expect you to be around for quite a long time so you’ll need to do your best.”
Harry laughed, full of joy and warmth as Ron and Draco continued to jabber back and forth. He laid his hand upon Draco’s and settled in to be entertained by Ron and Draco's increasingly creative insults.
“This was some time after he was released from Azkaban early. We were walking through the outskirts of the grounds, the farthest part from the Manor, as the land had finally started to heal there. My mother told me to bring the camera and of course, I wanted to be a prat about it. Who were we kidding? The war had only been about two years ago and we had been undeserving but lucky for the light sentences we got thanks to my mother’s lie and your testimony. I felt my mother was deluded and father was still like a ghost of himself. What good would flouncing around and photographing our gardens do especially since the only reason the Ministry didn’t seize the Manor was because the property was so poisoned, ruined by him that it was a crueller punishment to leave us with our rotting ancestral home than take it away and deal with it themselves. I was walking behind mother and father, not wanting to be there, when the sun started to set and everything seemed to glow and the wind blew in the freshest air I’d felt on the grounds in years.”
Fully content with warmth rushing through his being and filling him with a deeply settled happiness, Harry turned his head and quietly murmured a “Thank you” into Draco’s hair.
“Potter… Harry,” he corrected with a sigh as Harry raised an eyebrow at him. “Shall we head to one of our flats for a cup of tea?”
“Maybe we reset and start slow?” he offered up. “I’m knackered from today but maybe we could meet up for tea or lunch tomorrow?”
Draco rolled his eyes, but his gaze was warm before turning mischievous, just like his eldest son’s. He leaned against the counter, reached back with a hand, and threw a handful of flour at Harry’s face.
Draco paused and drew in a deep breath before continuing quietly, “I think this was the moment she started to forgive him. And forgive herself. And I thought we might all be okay one day.”
Draco looked down at Harry. “No, there isn’t. I think we can fail to schedule an introductory brunch for a few more weekends.”
He leaned forward in his seat slightly and made gentle eye contact with Malfoy. “Yes. Yes, I’m amenable,” he offered with a hopeful smile.
"Oh okay," Harry replied dumbly and tried to hide his disappointment. Malfoy gave him a curious glance before waving his wand so that all their strewn parchments and quills flew back into their respective boxes. They grabbed their robes and briefcases and headed to the lifts. Before they were about to Apparate to each of their own homes, Malfoy turned to Harry and opened his mouth after a moment of hesitation.
“Sorry. I mean, yes of course I’ll meet your parents, but really I think it’s up to you to decide. They’re your parents. But since this is going well and hopefully… will continue and become more serious… and we’re basically boyfriends… I would probably need to meet them at some point, right?” Harry asked, biting his lip.
His words met silence. Draco remained staring at the opposite wall in apparent deep thought and confusion. Harry fingered the edge of one of sleeves as his discomfort increased exponentially with each passing second.
He clambered around in the kitchen and returned to Draco, who was looking at the pictures on the bookcase. They were photos of Harry’s parents dancing, Teddy with ever-changing hair, and Harry with Hugo and Rose.
Chaos immediately ensued. James and Scorpius were up in arms immediately, giggling with mirth and scooping out piles of flour from the floor to throw at each other or their parents. Albus grinned on the sidelines before Harry scooped him up and gleefully twirled him around the kitchen that was truly snowing with flour at this point.
“No, I just like you,” Harry said. “But if you’re not a fan of my dope-y smiles, you could call me ‘Harry’ instead.”
Malfoy blinked in surprise and considered Harry, who tried not to fidget. After what felt like forever, Draco opened his mouth and said slowly. "Sure, Potter."
A pause before Draco carefully responded, “Alright, Potter. The rest of our lives. That’s quite a long time.”
Harry trudged himself to work and dreaded every moment. Luckily, it was unlikely that he'd cross paths with Malfoy given where their offices were. But his mind kept returning to the agonizing misunderstanding of his and Malfoy's "date" as if determined to make him relive his hellish embarrassment over and over again. He knew that trying to get any productive work done would be impossible with the distracting memories in the back of his head. As the lift doors closed behind him, he sent a silent prayer that the day would be an easy one.
For a long moment, Draco stayed facing the door, his back to Harry, despite the hand he laid on Harry’s arm.
Draco stood near the counter, hands on hips, glaring at the mess upon his usually spotless kitchen. In the far corner, their twins sat side-by-side at the table. Albus, the more serious of the toddlers, looked gob-smacked, mouth open, eyes darting around at the expanse of flour covering every object and surface. Meanwhile, Scorpius snickered alongside his older brother, the lead troublemaker in the family.
Harry was determined to keep it slow, allow Malfoy the time to reach where Harry had been for the past few months - in the massive I-have-a-walloping-crush-on-you-and-just-want-to-spend-more-time-with-you-so-I-can-find-more-things-to-like-about-you-please phase. How Harry had ended up there himself, he wasn’t even fully sure. The tentative colleague relationship he and Malfoy had carefully built when they first crossed paths at the Ministry had morphed into an appreciative wow-I-admire-your-work-and-love-working-with-you and then Harry started noticed things like Malfoy’s hair, clothes, hands, determination, competency, wand work, quirky way he furrowed his brow, preference for steaming hot cups of tea, etc. etc.
“I’m sorry, Potter,” he said quietly, still avoiding eye contact. Harry stood too, fearful at Draco’s words.
“Um, shall we?” Harry asked, gesturing towards the lift. Draco nodded and Harry followed him into open lift.
“Yes yes yes,” Harry panted as he cupped Draco’s flushed face. In response, Draco’s hand played with the waistband of Harry’s trousers before diving underneath to grasp his bare cheek and pull Harry even closer. The bold movement made Harry want to melt even further, but then his brain jolted with sudden realization.
“Mate, the way you go on about Malfoy’s hands when he works a potion or the way he arranges his parchment or whatever… sounds kinda romantic and
“You look like you’re trying to swallow a sherbet lemon,” Malfoy observed drily as his eyebrow remained raised at Harry’s face.
“If you weren’t in this hospital bed, I’d swat you for that.” Draco’s words were softened by the kiss he then pressed to Harry’s lips.
James rolled his eyes while Harry fondly wrapped an arm around his oldest son. Cass ran up to Harry and butted her nose against Harry’s free hand, which he used to scratch at her ears.
“Being rude, am I?” Draco said in a dangerously saccharine tone. “Someone seems to be volunteering to help James clean all this up without magic.”
"I've thought a lot about what you said the other night," Malfoy continued. "And I still find myself unsure what to really think because that's not what I ever expected, especially from you. What you said was very... kind. And um... thoughtful. Clearly you've given this much more thought than I have–" Harry couldn't help his blush–"but I admit... I'm a bit intrigued and... we do get along well now... and you're actually intelligent and capable and... good-looking. And part of me is curious and would like to see... where this could go. So if you're amenable..." Malfoy trailed off, looking at Harry.
Draco sighed before grabbing Harry’s shirt and pulling him in. “Yes, Potter. You’d have to meet them at some point. And I’d have to meet the rest of the Weasleys. Because it’s going well and I expect us to continue for… as long as we can and yes we’re... ‘boyfriends’ even though I think that word is juvenile.”
"I've thought a lot about what you said," he started. Harry opened his mouth to protest that it was alright, they didn't need to talk about it again or ever, but Malfoy cut him off. "Please, just let me finish before you say anything," he requested. Harry gulped and nodded, wondering if he was headed towards his doom.
They eventually made their way to the sofa with cups of steaming tea. Harry’s knee accidentally brushed against Draco’s as they both settled in, but he didn’t pull it back far. Draco remained facing out to the rest of the room while Harry’s body couldn’t help but turn towards Draco instead.
“Merlin,” Draco gasped in turn. As his hand gave a squeeze to Harry’s arse, he muttered between kisses, “Is this okay?”
Harry nodded. “I’m taking Bill and Fleur’s second, Dominique, flying. She wants to be a Chaser one day.
“Yes. Um yes, I have been for a long time,” Harry said at first. Then he figured he might as well go all in. “But I’m more than just attracted to you. I mean, you’re bloody handsome, but you’re smart, brilliant at your job and I love working on cases with you. And I like your sense of humor, even if it’s at my expense, which is most of the time. And I admire you for working to become the man you are after everything you’ve been through. You’re incredible and lovely and I want to spend time with you, talk about everything there is to talk about, see what we could be together. Because I’ve thought about this a long time and I think it could be really good. I want to… to try with you. If- if you’re interested.”
It wasn't an easy one. Harry ran his hands through his hair for the hundredth time that afternoon and then rested his head in his hands as he sat at his desk. Files and briefs had taken over his workplace as they continued to stream in as memos or attached to his colleagues all demanding impossible deadlines.
Draco leaned his head back and blinked down at the sincere look on Harry’s face. “Rest of our lives…”
“Harry,” Ron sighed. “Please end your misery and ask him out. And by your misery, I mean me and Hermione’s misery.”
Harry’s heart swelled. And he found that he suddenly could not help himself. He put his cup on the side table and reached for Draco, his hand falling gently on Draco’s shoulder. Draco looked up in surprise and turned his face towards Harry’s, a question on the tip of his mouth. Not wanting the moment to break, Harry leaned in and pressed his lips softly to Draco’s.
It was truly telling that it was the mention of Malfoy’s arse that finally got Harry’s brain to wake up. “Oh Merlin.”
"Okay." Malfoy continued to look at him strangely, as if Harry were an odd puzzle he hadn't yet solved. Harry pushed the thought aside in wake of his amazement and now incredibly nerve-wracked jubilation.
“Sorry, sorry! Mind drifted off,” Harry hurried to explain and hopefully avoid the fact that he’d been remembering the moment when his best friends had to tell him who he fancied.
Malfoy’s eyebrow, which had been encountered to its usual resting place, raised up again as he took a moment to look at Harry’s hand. Harry held his breath as Malfoy appeared to rapidly run through a hundred different thoughts in his mind before arriving at some decision point. Pale cheeks turning slightly pink, Malfoy reached out with his other hand and softly, slowly stroked a finger down one of Harry’s.
Malfoy looked back at him for a moment, expressionless, before returning a small, tentative grin that made Harry want to lean across the desk between them and plant his mouth on Malfoy’s in a dramatic snog. But now he knew better where Malfoy stood on it all. Malfoy had done as he said he would. He’d thought it over and came to a decision to stride into Harry’s office and extend a hand to meet Harry in the middle, an odd and ironic twist of the rejected hand in friendship from First Year. But this time, Harry was determined to reach back out and meet Malfoy in the between.
A few weeks later found Harry wincing as he shifted in his bed in St. Mungos and saw an approaching, furious Draco.
“Harry?” Ron waved a hand in front of his face. “Don’t you remember wondering how Malfoy must’ve gotten his arse looking like that when all he seemed to spend his time on was potions?”
“My grandfather was a very smart and artistic and curious man. He was also wealthy, powerful, Pureblood, Slytherin… a society figure. But at his heart, he was an explorer and I think if he hadn’t been the heir, he would’ve spent his life traveling the world and discovering everything there is to discover. But he had a duty. Sometimes though, I would see how he kept that spirit… in little pockets here and there. And he would share it with me, his only grandchild.”
The thing was Harry thought about kissing Malfoy a lot. Too much. So much that it was a head-to-desk situation. Or a head-to-bar situation at the moment.
“Thanks,” Draco replied just as quietly. When he took the steaming mug, he lowered his gaze from the photos to the cup. Harry gnawed on his lip in a bit of hesitation wondering what his next move should be.
“Do you want to sit?” he finally suggested. Draco gave a small nod and followed Harry to the worn couch. He settled about a foot away from Harry, which simultaneously felt like too much and not enough space. It made Harry antsy.
Despite his exhaustion and assured that he'd soon be blind from pouring over the same parchment spreadsheets repeatedly, Harry was elated - delight drawn from the adrenaline of the late night that had been long, but brought them close to finally closing the case. And delight that it was just him and Malfoy. Seeing Malfoy slightly rumpled more than his usually pristine self gave Harry a lovely, squirmy thrill. With his hair falling over his eyes and his sleeves rolled up, revealing the faded Mark, Malfoy looked softly vulnerable in a way Harry, and doubtless everyone else, rarely had the privilege of witnessing. Harry's heart thumped loudly when Malfoy stretched his back with his arms overhead.
Harry was momentarily surprised by Malfoy's offer of affection. Although, was it affection? Surely it was more than collegial acceptance? But with Malfoy being more guarded than the average person, who knew what his range was for interpersonal disclosures? Harry, aware his mind was about to dive into a never-ending cycle of considering all possible meaning behind Malfoy's words, attempted to pull himself back to the present moment only to realize that Draco was now looking at him confused. Because he had spent so much time analyzing Malfoy's facial expressions, Harry also recognized the wary nervousness in his gaze. Again, the evidence of Malfoy's vulnerability squeezed Harry's chest and before he knew it, he blurted, "Would you like to have dinner together tomorrow night?"
Draco nodded and led them out the front door. He paused briefly again before offering out his arm. “Side-apparate?” He offered.
“What?! You are? Oh Merlin, congratulations!” Harry burst out before standing up and hurrying to hug his best friends.
“I know,” Harry murmured, turning his face towards Draco’s so his nose nudged against Draco’s cheek.
“I wouldn’t expect your unsophisticated palate or mind to appreciate such culinary delights or innovations,” Malfoy had playfully sniffed after Harry had only somewhat successfully avoided the swat to his head and failed to hide his chuckle.
“I’m here solo tonight. And you? No partner?” He needed to be sure, regardless of his friends’ input.
Neville looked disappointed at the negative response. He knew Neville had been honest with him about Blaise and that he should be open too, but he wasn’t sure what he felt for Malfoy anymore. He might have dated some arseholes, but never wanted criminals.
“Is ‘good friends’ what they’re calling it these days?” Harry blushed, and Draco froze, unsure how to react and too surprised to redden.
We don’t have to wait long. Master Potter immediately reaches for his partner, giving the protective comfort that I couldn’t.
My pulse had skyrocketed and my stomach flipped as I wondered just how much practice Harry had with those very spells… not that I could or would judge him for having an active sex life. But I didn’t want to just be a quick fuck to a wizard who’d exerted such an outsize influence on my life. Even though that’s exactly what we had done: a one-night stand.
I smile when I see the table—Harry’s left me dessert (chocolate mousse, my favourite) and a note on one of those ingenious Muggle postey notes. His writing is atrocious, cramped and uneven, but my heart flutters in anticipation. He’s such a thoughtful and attentive boyfriend. But as I read the note, my stomach clenches.
Hermione shifted uncomfortably at her true plan being exposed. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose in frustration, pushing up his glasses towards his forehead. Ron could be dense with emotions but was always surprisingly good with strategy. They should have known he would catch on and see two moves ahead, as he did with chess.
He wiped his brow and neck with a handkerchief, frowning as he tried to decide how best to expend the residual adrenaline. Even though he logically knew it had to be early, he checked the time for confirmation:  5:42 PM. Too early to go to a bar or a club and meet someone. A run, then.
A few days before, Draco had visited his parents for the winter solstice. It was their family tradition for exchanging gifts and eating sumptuously, but it had felt like they were playing the role of a celebrating family. Before the war, his godfather, his aunt and uncle, and other family friends would stop by. With just his parents and himself, it was a reminder of all they had lost.
“Seeing as I have the only known Invisibility Cloak, they probably aren’t expecting it,” Harry agreed.
“Couldn’t make it. He had to cover detentions for Sinistra,” Blaise replied, taking a sip of his wine to hide his smirk.
It’s been so long since I’ve seen her smile so brightly, allowing her eyes to crinkle. She’s happy, and it eases the guilt I always carry with me for having left home — having left her.
Draco wondered how Harry seemed so at ease and confident. He, too, wanted to look sexy and composed. Instead, he worried that he looked awkward, squirming to find the best position as he lay back on the bed. As he fidgeted, the bed creaked and the headboard lightly thumped against the wall.
Harry sent off a Patronus to his friend, and Draco was jealous of the ethereal stag that bounded away. He had failed the last time he tried to conjure one. The memory he used to use of his eighth birthday party had become bittersweet over the years as his relationship with his parents deteriorated.
I see the piece of parchment on the kitchen table, and the tension leaves my body — my husband just went out for a walk, and he’ll be back soon.
Scrubbing harder at the invisible stain on the other end of the wooden surface from Potter and adjusting liquor bottles a few millimeters each to line up perfectly, I try to quell my questions.
I finally drag myself up the stairs to our bedroom.  I curl up on his side of the bed and inhale the scent of his aftershave on his pillow.
As a bartender, I know the recipes and proportions for mouthwatering cocktails that go down a little too easily. But despite my profession, I’ve never been a good drinker. You know that phrase “flush with drink”? Yeah. That’s me. And the blotchy look is
“Aye. Now put on your Captain’s band. You deserve it,” Oliver replies, passing over the yellow armband with a capital C.
The overlapping rings of protection glowed faintly around the ring, each layer a distinct colour. He and Blaise would have to dismantle them one by one in the correct order. They reminded him of Muggle action films, his secret guilty pleasure, where spies would have to cross a laser array or cut wires to stop a bomb from detonating.
Harry swore and winced as the light scars on the hairless torso were revealed. Draco never thought about them anymore; they were just a part of his body. Panic gripped him as he realised Harry had stopped his caresses, his fingers trembling and hovering millimetres over the raised flesh.
Draco looked at the bed that could easily fit four adults. The two could comfortably share with plenty of space in between them, but it would be torture to sleep so close and yet so far from Harry.
As the Seeker, I take to the air last. I push off the ground firmly, my broom shooting straight up before I warm up with barrel rolls. I’ve never understood the need to show off with stupid tricks, but management
“Fu—” he started before realising that he couldn’t say anything. Harry had the right to date anyone. Draco switched to a terse, “Harry, see you soon... and you too, Flint.”
He had few people he trusted, but he wanted to trust Harry Potter. It was a new feeling, seeing as he only trusted Blaise because of 20 years of friendship. He trusted Neville only as an extension of that trust. Harry had hated him, fought with him, even accidentally nearly killed him. Even then, he had always been honest.
“I know it’s summer, but even charms aren’t strong enough to deal with this heat,” Harry complained, pulling the sticky fabric of his shirt away from his skin. He added, frowning, “Maybe the beach will be refreshing.”
Draco cast the spell to show the wards and found that they would still have to counteract a few charms, despite the Muggle location.
Draco turned at the noise of the body falling to the ground, and he wasn’t the only one as another wizard rushed in, just to also be taken down by Harry.
“I can’t believe it’s just a few more months, and we’ll have another family member,” he whispers.  The baby moves in response to their father’s voice and kicks.  Harry marvels, as he always does, at the gentle pressure from inside against his hand on the outside.
“Potter, how’d you find this place?” He asks tentatively, as though I or someone are after him, and not like the coincidence it is.
It’s ludicrous for me to consider dyeing my hair considering I haven’t even changed my haircut since Hogwarts. I don’t do well with change.
“Thank Merlin you’re already at Grimmauld Place. It looks like there’ll be a heist in the morning in Seville: a relic in the cathedral. It’s where Christopher Columbus is buried, so there’s significance for Muggles. We won’t have much time to scope out the site and develop a plan of attack first.”
The couple also instituted regular paint nights. Those nights often entailed experimenting with edible paints in their bedroom, rolling around on a canvas to "enjoy the process of creation.” They hung one such painting over their bed. Harry had wanted to put it in the sitting room until Draco pointed out that even if no one could tell that some of the smears were cockprints, the handprints were a little too suggestive of which positions they had used.
It just hasn’t fit in the schedule lately. We spend all day together at work, but he’s been Flooing to Pansy’s or the Manor afterwards and coming back late. Or we’re out on a stakeout. Or we’re babysitting Rose and Hugo. Basically, anything and everything but sex.
“I am a super thief who has international escapades.” Blaise’s voice started coming into the blond’s ear with a hint of static. “Sorry for the delay, but I guess it’s too late to warn you that Potter is right next to y – Nev, mmm… stop that…” Draco wished he could berate Blaise for being a shit partner out loud. The string of curses he suppressed would impress any sailor.
“I see them on my map, Little Dragon. Not too complex. You might be able to do it now instead of risking a second trip.”
“Excuse me?” Harry said sharply. He himself had barely accepted Malfoy’s innocence, and while Ron had matured, Harry knew he still held a deep grudge against the Malfoy family. Ron was bound to take the whole situation terribly.
He opened his eyes, seeing a blur of what seemed to be a face topped with blond hair. Draco? How did he get here?
I hear the shuffle of papers, and I see my husband organizing the drawings on my desk in the corner of the room.  He never organizes his own work, but he knows how important organization is to me, so he will clean mine.
he was invisible since the room had anti-Disillusionment charms,” Moreau, the French auror, reminded everyone.
“I shouldn’t be surprised that you know how to dress like a Muggle, Potter, but you should probably know… wearing a ring like that… it sends a certain signal in the Wizarding world.”
A year turned into two. Then two into three. Now, ten years later, I’ve stopped looking for something more fulfilling for a career. Quidditch is enough.
As predicted, Luna put a gentle hand on his arm, but otherwise let him absorb and process the blast of information, from Malfoy’s heists to the existence of VILE, unimpeded.
“Do you have any idea where he might have gone?” I ask when they finally raise their eyes from the words back to me.
I snort. Even if Hermione hadn’t mentioned that the owner was a Squib, I’d have found all the magic references suspicious. Then again, I
It finally registers in my brain: there’s a Compulsion Charm and some other unknown spell at work. I wouldn’t have noticed it if I were a Muggle, but these are
For the first time in my life, I had nothing scripted in my life path. Not school, not fighting, not a relationship… just an open expanse of nearly a century and no ideas on how to fill the time. Hobbies? I wasn’t even sure if I
My hand reaches to draw my wand from its holster. It’s an old reflex from the War, as I haven’t carried a wand regularly since I lost mine back then. There are some parts of our past we can’t outrun.
“It’s a coat to match the hat—it has lots of pockets to keep potions and things you might need. In it are a few prototypes of products George has been working on for future missions,” Harry explained.
Harry brushed off his attempted apology and ripped open the paper to see the rows of perfectly formed truffles. He wasted no time in taking off the lid noisily and popping one in his mouth.
“Blaise, I got it. I’m back,” he told his friend as he sank onto the firm mattress. He was grateful to be alone so no one could see his back was soaked in sweat. He had a reputation to maintain.
While the Muggle capital of the country had moved inland to Brasilia, the Brazilian Ministry of Magic (Ministério da Magia Brasileiro) was still headquartered in the old capital of Rio.
Draco’s heart clenched in sympathy at the misery clear in Harry’s voice. “You don’t have to figure all that out now. One step at a time, okay?”
A failed contract marriage with Astoria Greengrass had shown him he couldn’t just ignore his sexuality. The Wizarding community was usually accepting of all sexualities, but his father? His father had sputtered and continued to demand he produce a biological heir.
The bartender sports the same shockingly teal hair that Teddy prefers. Unlike my godson, I’d need to substantially lighten my own black locks for any dye to take, so I’ve never attempted it, even though Fred and George have been pushing me to try Weasley’s Wizarding Wheeze’s new line of temporary hair color charms. It’s hard to trust them, but would I even look good with blue hair?
“What a lucky couple! I’ve never seen such compatibility in the colours before. There’s a Compulsion Charm to help your magic choose the right balloon, y’know. Young love... well, the server will be with you shortly.”
“I love you, but I think we’re better as friends,” Harry quipped. Hermione rolled her eyes but couldn’t stop her smile.
“You daft git, we can’t be a family without you!  You’re our rock, Draco.  It doesn’t matter what anyone else says, you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to us.  And honestly, I can’t deal with another night of
Harry hadn’t known the trip was only supposed to include the two of them, so he had mentioned it to the rest of their friend group. Their meddling friends insisted on joining in to celebrate Harry’s birthday.
I send my Patronus to my in-laws with a message to come immediately.  For all their faults, they love their son and grandson, and I know they’ll Floo or apparate directly here as soon as they see the white stag.
After the War, Harry had testified on behalf of Draco and his family; then they lost contact for three years while Harry went through auror training and Draco travelled the world to find himself. It was as he’d moved from country to country that he’d fallen in love with trying different cuisines and found his calling.
We know things, but can’t speak. That’s also why I can’t tell Master Malfoy that Master Potter has a tail now that both were seemingly too preoccupied to notice.
I sometimes miss the times when we slept through the entire night without him telling me that our child is pushing on his bladder or having Reg come in after a nightmare.  But I wouldn’t trade our children for anything.
“I’ll be back.” Neville squeezed his shoulder and left with the woman. He watched as they let their bodies speak for them, and he craved the intimacy of that interaction. It wasn’t intimacy in the sexual sense, as he knew Neville had his boyfriend at home, but it was still sensual to an observer. It was a completely new side to Neville.
We ascend the marble staircase, and I bypass the reading rooms and galleries to bring Harry to the collection of John Singer Sargent murals on the third floor.
As my aunt and mother take Teddy’s hand to lead him to the restroom in the new side of the building, I take Harry into the original section. It’s not the most impressive architecture I’ve seen, nor the oldest (although by American standards, it’s positively ancient), but it’s the building in my adopted city that reminds me the most of home.
I can’t tell him we’ve seen worse. That we know basically everything there is to know about humans. And their bodily functions.
We’re surely in the way, doing exactly what I hate when tourists do it: inconveniencing others by stopping unnecessarily right in the middle of a thoroughfare. But today, I don’t care.
“Rival athletes to gym buddies to lovers. This story is heartwarming, sweet, and sure to make you crave a smoothie! This mlm romance explores themes of sexuality, masculinity, and mental health.”
Dancing brought back memories of the Yule Ball—mostly of tripping over his own feet. Those feet were now rooted in place in the hall entrance as Neville tried to coax him to come in.
Blaise and Neville were on the aptly named loveseat, and Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as Neville’s pinky gently stroked over the back of his boyfriend’s hand. Just as he had when he saw them together last, Harry felt a pang of longing. Harry wasn’t even sure if the sign of affection was intentional since Blaise was engrossed in a debate with Hermione, and Neville was drafting a list of plants he would need to grow to meet their potion needs.
Finally, he made it into the room. The museum had been closed for an hour, so it was his good luck that the guards appeared relaxed as they chatted. Draco felt a niggle of guilt as he realised they would likely be fired if he did his job well.
Draco wanted more than anything to make Harry feel the same urgency and desperation as he himself felt. He needed the reassurance that this was real and that Harry wanted
He bit his lip and licked his own fingers before tweaking and rolling his nipples. He exaggerated his moans; knowing Harry was watching as he pleasured himself was intensely arousing. He ran a hand slowly, steadily down his torso to his slick cock.
“This is a bar in a bookstore, so the drinking is covered. But who is to say the dancing and fucking are off the table?”
Both laughed, quietly at first and then uproariously, their whole bodies quaking. Harry even had to lift his specs off the bridge of his nose to wipe at his tears. With more courage and better communication, the entire situation would have been resolved much earlier.
“Thank you, Mrs Weasley, for your hospitality. I know our families haven’t had the most... amiable relationship, but I hope that will change,” Draco greeted smoothly as he held out the bottle of wine he had picked from the Manor’s cellar. He regretted the choice when he realised one bottle would not even provide a full glass to each of the children.
The bartender is attending to a couple, so I slip onto a seat at the far end of the bar — isolated enough from other patrons that I don’t invite conversation.
“You mean, he literally thought he was just doing you a favour?” Blaise howled as Draco threw the pillow that had been resting in his lap at his friend’s smug face.
I nod.  I’m suddenly aware of how I’m both thirsty and need to pee (because, of course, I do).  It takes some maneuvering to get out of bed and to the loo.
“Saviour to Quidditch Sensation: Britain wins 330 to 80.” The picture is cut off at the fold, but I can see that unmistakable black hair flowing in the breeze.
His world was reduced to Harry. Harry had always challenged his perspective, even now, apparently, with sex. How could Draco ever have thought the intimacy was in the penetration?
He thought through possible dates. One option was that nice bloke he met at the Muggle gay bar last week. Neville was too close a friend and, rumour had it, already in a relationship. Zabini? Harry had heard he was bisexual, but he couldn’t remember ever having had a conversation with the former Slytherin.
“Excuse us, Draco, Harry,” Hermione stated before pulling on her fiancé’s arm to lead him elsewhere. Draco looked in her general direction to acknowledge her words, but his gaze was drawn back to those emerald eyes.
I can’t bring myself to eat breakfast, my stomach churning as the blood pumps through my body, which is gearing up for the inevitable fight. We won’t come to literal blows, but my body is preparing all the same.
The street lamps flickered on, bathing the park in warm light as the sky darkened. He stopped, panting, and grabbed the metal railing to look over the calm water. He appreciated the flow of the Charles River. There was no end in sight in either direction and no hint of whether the river curved at some point unseen. That mystery of what lay just out of sight was the perfect, if sappy, metaphor for his life after the war. Gone was the predictability of duty.
Head Auror Robards had put him on the original case months ago when an artefact was stolen in London. The team had grown with time, but they were running out of leads to follow up on. Hope and motivation were waning. Their collective experience seemingly wasn’t enough.
They were all there for me post-war. They supported me through the difficult times, told me to stand my ground and remain proud when others would rather hex me than give me a chance. I wouldn’t be where I am today if not for them, and I won’t abandon them now in their time of need. I thought Harry, of all people, would understand that. I thought we’d built our relationship on more than just the physical. My mistake.
He grabs my left hand and kisses our wedding band.  He looks into my eyes and kisses the bonding marks as well, sending a tingle of magic up my arm and down my spine.
And there it is. I don’t usually smirk. It doesn’t suit my face the same way it does his, but I’m smirking now.
Harry had always considered Ron relatively sheltered with respect to the Muggle world, but this was a whole other level of ignorance. He was glad to see the genuine curiosity and excitement, a complete shift from the snobby boy he once knew.
“Can’t stop a bloke for trying,” Draco flirted back, unsure if it was too intense or childish to admit that he had picked the colour to match Harry’s eyes instead.
There are plants lining the windows, soaking up the little sunlight that isn’t blocked by buildings. Tourists are milling through the ground floor, some reading while leaning against a shelf and others just talking as they browse.
If he was going to be fighting an invisible enemy, at least he was doing it with Draco and with the support of their friends. If VILE could operate in the shadows, so could they.
It doesn’t matter that I’ve dated multiple men since then, I just can’t get over how Harry Potter was once just as infatuated with me as I’d been with him.
Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak and reached out to squeeze Draco’s arm. Draco wore the red coat and used a partial transfiguration charm on his face to hide his features. They had decided it would be too difficult for both of them to be invisible and move together for the first visit.
They both sat in companionable silence, listening to the crackling of the fire and sipping their tea.
like him, too. Their resemblance was difficult to ignore. He tried to think of a question that wouldn’t be too strange. “Where are you from, anyway?”
“Why’d you choose those colours? What do they represent?” he asked, wishing he could just take a peek inside his crush’s head.
Then he feels it: a slick tentacle wrapping gently around their waists, the tip tracing up the back of Harry’s leg. Then another.
Draco refused to try anything on, sure that if he did, he wouldn’t be able to hide his reaction to Harry in tight green swimwear. He had seen Harry’s chest before in all its muscled glory, but this was the closest he’d come to seeing the cock he had dreamed about.
He couldn’t be so daring as to outright wear red, and certainly not Gryffindor crimson, but he found a beautiful tawny port fabric for his robes and paired it with a black turtleneck and trousers. As his mother always says: “black is slimming” and “confidence makes the look.” So he armed himself with both.
“Ah... it’s actually a modification to extend the charm on your very own Headless Hat. It has a time limit though,” Blaise responded.
On their first day, Blaise suggested a walk in the historic city. As they walked, they heard tourists chattering with shopkeepers in broken Italian and smelled freshly brewed coffee. As they ambled along the Ponte Santa Trinita towards the famous Duomo, they stopped to admire the Arno while Blaise gave the river’s history of overflowing its banks and devastating the city. He pointed to the next bridge over, the Ponte Vecchio, famous for its gold shops.
“Harry,” Neville started, surprising Harry with his initiative, “given that Draco and Blaise haven’t been arrested yet, I’m assuming you’re thinking things over. Yeah?”
He was the coward. Again. In fight or flight, he always chose flight. The only exception was when it came to killing Dumbledore, where he chose the third option of freezing, and he eventually fled from that too.
What the bedroom sees is practically mundane — our two Masters also make ample use of the shower and bathtub.  They stay until they’re pruny, the water has long gone cold, and the only source of heat is their bodies. Sometimes they’re watching their reflections in the mirror over the sink as they move in tandem. They’re more creative than earlier occupants have been, starting off desperate and fast as though their emotions are jumping out of their skin and then ending slowly, languorously, just basking in being together.
Draco dropped the coin and pulled off his own shirt, folded it neatly, and then ran his hands down his own smooth chest. Having little hair himself, he wondered what it would be like to run his hands over Harry’s pecs.
“We’ll play Quidditch together,” he decided, and the witches exchanged a look that he couldn’t decipher.
My hands shake a little as I take it. I know I’ve worked hard to get where I am, but it still feels like the honor should have gone to someone else. Even though it weighs practically nothing, I can always feel the constriction of the band, and the pressure to bring out the best in myself and in my teammates.
Swallowing Draco’s groans, he’s never felt so out of control. Every nerve ending is hyperaware. Water laps rhythmically at his nipples. Draco’s cock twitches against his stomach. There’s the continuous prickle of suction as the Squid unrepentantly explores his legs and thighs, teasing.
He and Harry had formed a tentative friendship after that walk in Muggle London. He and Blaise had even been extended visiting privileges at the Black family home where Harry lived, and they often would all meet up in the evenings to research and eat takeaway. If Draco visited a bit more often than the others, he told himself it was because he had the most flexible hours since he didn’t have a traditional job.
the sex! How is it that we can’t even make time for our anniversary?” My words lose their heat as I say them because I never should have written those words on that post-it. I’m the one who put that scared and furious look in his eye and heaped on yet another stressor. “I just… need you too, Draco.”
Dad knows the way, and we end up in an office that isn’t Dad’s.  Dad argues with the man working there until the man places a chipped mug on the desk in between him and my dad.  Dad picks me up and uses the hand that still holds mine to touch it.
He hoped it would not look too suspicious to request a meeting later the same day at his London flat. He penned his response, choosing his words carefully before sealing it and attaching it to the owl on the ledge.
“It’s almost midnight, if you want to get out of here,” Draco offered, his voice low and his breath hot against Harry’s ear. Harry nodded dumbly, body thrumming at the recognition that he’d get all of Draco tonight. The entire night had felt like elaborate foreplay, a prolonged seduction of
His fingers tightened on the glass when the man shamelessly asked Harry if he wanted to dance with a wiggle of his hips as if Draco wasn’t sitting right there.
He wondered if he should reach out now that he was back home, to see if he’d been mistaken. For work, of course, and not only to see the pale face with stormy grey eyes.
Harry, meanwhile, reviewed a list of American and Spanish vocabulary that Hermione had sent him. Draco found it adorable when Harry sounded out each word and complained about American slang.
“I’ll go with you. Night, all!” Draco’s pride swelled as Harry also moved to leave, waving away the good-natured grumbling of those gathered.
“I guess it’s fine. Plus, you know how they say everything is bigger in America? That bed is gigantic.”
“Viktor’s cousin is getting married in Bulgaria in three weeks. The bride will wear a priceless heirloom, so Viktor asked if you could attend to provide security. If something were to happen and help your case…” Hermione always directly made her argument and knew exactly how to hook him. It was what made her such a successful solicitor in front of the Wizengamot.
And there, across the street, I see my family: Mother’s hair, still the brilliant blonde I’ve always remembered even if I doubt it’s natural anymore. She’s holding onto a small child with mousy brown hair, as she laughs at something her sister says.
“Hi Draco. We found more information in the Black personal library. The history and effects seem even more far-reaching than we had thought.”
They were disappointed that the conversation wasn’t particularly helpful. The trip was a dead end, and they had learned nothing that could possibly relate to VILE. They hadn’t made much progress in the weeks since the Order agreed to help.
Draco decided to take the initiative and ask Harry for a normal friendship outing — something that couldn’t be mistaken as a date. He and Blaise often watched films together, so the cinema would be a good starting point. Maybe he could include dinner? He had a place he needed to try for work.
Somehow in the past couple of months of working with Harry, he became accustomed to how his now-boyfriend would throw his things everywhere and then claim it made Draco’s orderly London flat look “lived in.”
“We’ll check out some of the places I think Draco would go,” I reply, brandishing the page covered in my scribbles and chicken scratch.
The fireplace turns green as the Floo is activated, and Hermione and Ron step out with Hugo and Rose.
My instinct is also telling me that it might just be the key to finding him.  It’ll be the first place we check in the morning after confirming where exactly they had visited with Narcissa.
“Little D, look at you go! Have to get through this first before your ‘little dragon’ can play though,” Blaise reminded him, bringing Draco back to reality.
“If we put our resources into studying the returned artefact, then we might miss an even bigger heist,” Moreau admitted.
“Just listen to him, Harry. You both have to come home soon and safe. It’s all over the news. Fortunately, all accounts suggest that the thieves got the diadem, and you left to follow their trail so we have some time,” Neville explained quickly.
“We should limit the first trip to 5 minutes to be safe. We can’t risk the hat losing its power. It’s really a shame that only one adult can fit under the cloak—we used to fit three back as first years,” Harry sighed and rubbed his hands over his face as he always did when stressed. Knowing that Draco had visited the city before brought Harry comfort, despite his misgivings.
He had initially chosen to be a Seeker because of his rivalry with Harry and the prestige that often came with the position. He soon found he loved the freedom of exploring the whole pitch, dodging obstacles, and just... flying. There was a singular aim; he didn’t have to worry about scoring as much as possible. The match could narrow to him, Harry, and the Snitch.
“I could get used to this,” Harry murmured, and Blaise shot him a warning look for not paying attention and interrupting. Draco squeezed his hand tightly.
He had thought nothing in the wedding could surpass the colourful venue and the beauty of the floral arrangements, but the headpiece did. The headpiece he was here to protect instead of fantasising in the audience like a horny teenager.
“You’ll look good in Slytherin colours,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear and watched his boyfriend shiver. He smirked then added, “If you’re cold, maybe you should put it on.”
He pretended not to hear his friend crying after him that it was just a joke. This holiday would be a fairy-tale trip, and if he acted fast, he could even have it coincide with Harry’s 26th birthday.
Harry’s eyebrows knit as he struggled to assimilate competing memories and fill in the gaps. He sank to his heels and ran his hands over his face and Draco’s knees bent as if to follow the gesture, but what if Harry felt uncomfortable with him now, after everything?
Blaise followed suit shortly after that, claiming that he needed to rest for an early morning in front of the Wizengamot. Harry didn’t seem to remember that Blaise had told them just last week that he was taking the day off to visit his boyfriend at Hogwarts.
Harry looked back up at Draco’s face, sighing and answering, “Look, I’ve liked you for a while, but I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. I didn’t want you to think that I just wanted to be with you because our friends are together. I was so hopeful every time you asked me to do things, but then you never said anything.”
“Blaise is amazing with warding because of his work as an architect. He studied in the Muggle world for a while and is really brilliant with security. Anyway, we were skeptical too until we saw that Asmo’s book had records of VILE’s recent activity. They were there in Bulgaria, and what if Draco hadn’t been?”
“Of course! And please call me Draco,” he replied. He glanced at Potter before reaching out to shake the Quidditch player’s outstretched hand.
When the pounding in my head worsens, and I’m out of tears, I notice Harry’s shoulder is wet and covered in streaks of bogies.
Draco let out another bark of laughter as he sat next to him, then took Harry’s face in his hands to press their lips together chastely.
In the morning, I love how he looks deliciously rumpled in his silk pajamas with his sleep mask pushed up onto his forehead mussing his platinum hair.
Harry hadn’t visited a Muggle church in years, and none had been so impressive. He wished he could appreciate the architecture and the paintings. Instead, he was looking for signs of an ambush.
Harry finally looked up, tears slipping from the corners of his eyes and making tracks down the slopes of his face. Before he knew his hand moved, Draco wiped them away.
Dressing myself with charms after finding my wand balancing on the lampshade of all places, I debate explicitly asking Draco to stay, but a part of me knows it’s useless. He’ll leave before I return.
“You said the two of you are going to go looking tomorrow?  I told Robards that you had a personal emergency and would take the rest of the week,” Ron says.
“Do you hate him?” Neville asked, confirming that he had thought nothing of Draco’s response. On the other hand, Blaise looked like the cat that ate the canary, and Draco
“I have some more research to do, but I’ll owl you to talk further. But… you and Blaise, huh?” he changed the subject.
staring at him from the checkout line. The librarian, who’d been trying to get his attention, finally snapped at him noisily. James blinked and turned back to her with a sheepish grin.
It’s everything Harry ever wanted, stuck between dizzying pleasures, and he wonders if the Squid has powers beyond what anyone knows as it slowly leaves him just as the intense need to feel his husband inside hits. He doesn’t want to come on anything other than Draco’s cock.
“Harry!  What happened?  Is it Draco? Is it the baby?” Narcissa is beside herself as she rushes into the room from the fireplace.  Lucius is quiet, but he’s as agitated as his wife.
Draco survived the evening at the Burrow. When Bill Weasley specifically approached Blaise to review how his breakdown of protection charms differed from curse breaking, the blond realised that he no longer noticed that the furniture was mismatched and worn. The house was far from perfect, but it told the story of the inhabitants.
I beat the chocolate, eggs, and butter like I always do. I used the rich Swiss milk chocolate he picked up last week in Zurich (the one I studiously avoid looking at the price tag of because even if we have vaults too full to use in our lifetimes, there really should be a limit to the cost of a consumable.) But it didn’t taste as good on my tongue because mousse is meant to be shared. And I was alone.
I hate how much my heart races at the thought that he’ll be here soon. I hate how my palms are sweaty and so is my back, even though it’s only sixteen degrees outside. I can’t even delude myself that there’s any other reason for it besides
“Alright, the lot of you. Enough fawning over our guest. They came here to play, so let’s play. You know your teams for today. Harry, you’ll be with me. Draco will be with Patel over there,” Marcus barked.
They reached Arpoador, the area between two of the city’s most famous beaches. It was already crowded, but they found a space to sit on the rocks with other couples. After all, Harry didn’t mind if they had to sit a little closer.
He was always proud of the second or third looks others inevitably gave him when he passed. Today, however, he worried it could jeopardise the mission since he had such a small window of time. He could not cock it up.
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled the heady mixture of grass, sweat, and woodsy soap. He’d never considered that he might have a sweat kink until that moment, as he noted his body’s reaction to the scent. He wanted more.
He didn’t particularly enjoy nightclubs or what passed for “dancing” at one. As a child, like most pureblood families, his parents had insisted on dancing lessons. He was skilled at waltzes and ballroom styles, which required elegance and grace — grinding on your partner in a sweaty room while music blared? Not his thing.
The papers remind me of how hard Harry works both at his job and to be a parent.  He’s the best father I could have chosen for my children, and I know they’ll grow up to be just as amazing as he is.  Probably better.  He does have some bloody frustrating habits, though, like when he squeezes from the middle of the tube of toothpaste.  I’ve already taught Reg
Reclining on the bed, Harry waves his hand at the window to allow the messenger to come in and drop off the morning paper. Which it does at my feet, along with a small package as it hoots in my face as if to complain before swooping out again.
Harry and Draco had come to the MMB to meet the head of the Muggle-born Assimilation Department. Brazil was one of the few countries with a department devoted to improving the Muggle-born experience. Given his fame within Britain, Harry had often been offered the chance to visit but had never had the time.
Suddenly, the bespoke suit made more sense. (Sue me, so I noticed the embroidered name of the atelier when I’d found it rumpled on the floor next to my trousers.) Harry had looked like he’d stepped from a press conference because he literally
When Hermione excused herself to go to the loo, he watched as Charlie's eyes followed her out. Draco was pretty sure Charlie focused on Hermione's arse in particular, but he personally didn't want to think about it too much.
“I don’t know… drinking, dancing, fucking. Take your pick. If you were Granger, I could see a party being a night in a bookstore, but you barely stepped foot in the Hogwarts Library unless she dragged you there.”
With those words, Draco spiralled into despair. All of his friends (except oblivious Harry) told him that he was over dramatic as he sat in his flat, curled up in blankets, eating chocolates, and proclaiming that he’d be single forever. He had spent years gathering up courage, then months of extensive planning, and literally tens of thousands of Galleons in his attempts to woo Harry.
Draco’s hand moves from Harry’s cock to the nape of his neck, bringing their lips together again as their hips rut against each other while they’re fucked. There’s a pulse to their movements with the Squid setting the tempo, each obscene splash, squelch, and moan occuring in tandem.
The questions swirled in his mind, and he didn’t notice that he’d stopped working and paint was dripping from his brush onto the floor.
Harry opened his eyes to the rest of the task force sitting in their usual seats around the conference table and sipping their morning coffees. It wasn’t the first morning they had found him drooling on the table.
“I trust you,” Harry stated as the blond looked into his eyes to confirm this is what he wanted. “Please.” To prove his point, he ran his fingers over his abdomen to cast the preparation charms, and he widened his legs as an invitation.
“Gross... Potter, can you not talk about Hermione when you...ahhh... fuck...” I moan as he moves down my body to lick at the head of my prick.
“Hey.” Flint stopped them as they approached the exit. He laid a hand on Harry’s bicep. “Harry, see you again soon. I’ll owl you.” As he spoke, his eyes shifted towards Draco’s face and he smirked.
“Hey Squid, we have a proposition for you,” Draco yells and there’s a ripple in response across the water. Harry’s eyes widen —
The blond’s hands smoothed over the knit fabric of the jumper in his lap, appreciating the luxurious softness. Harry pulled his on, confirming that the green of the jumper accentuated his eyes.
Draco’s eyes drifted shut, savouring the moment and mind floating halfway between sleep and contentment. They were quiet for a while, catching their breath.
Draco could see the slight tremor of Neville’s hands. Despite Neville’s mastery of his field and his famous acts of bravery, there was still a hint of the shy boy who had disrupted every Potions class with a mistake.
When the International Quidditch Organization announced that the World Cup was in Boston this year, Hermione had immediately Flooed me about her favorite places in the city. Unsurprisingly, her best memories from her holidays are of bookstores. At her Boston favorite: a hot chocolate and Avi’s
The entire Wizarding world knew Harry had lost his parents, but only close friends knew how horrifically the Dursleys had treated their nephew. Draco’s heart clenched at the wistful tone in Harry’s voice. Without thinking, he reached out to touch his shoulder soothingly.
I still see them at their worst. Sometimes it’s tears, like the heartbroken Master Malfoy of before, but usually it’s something more… dirty, and not in a fun way. To be perfectly honest, I’ve seen a lot of shit.
And since it’s already 11:30 PM on a Tuesday and Draco still hasn’t returned from the Manor, I’ll be heading to bed alone. Again.
“Excuse me, this isn’t what I ordered,” a middle-aged woman complains in a nasally tone as she shoves a half-empty glass at me. After years in the service industry, my fake smile is pasted on before I even think about it. Even as I grit my teeth behind it.
get an invitation to almost any exclusive event, even on short notice. The Malfoy name had lost its luster in the war, but money talks.
It isn’t that we haven’t discussed that someday we would need to be honest with our children.  We have.  I didn’t want to think about “someday”.  I had thought we’d have control of the narrative.
I pull the stack of letters out from the drawer of my bedside table, measuring the weight of the paper in my hands. His dogged pursuit, even if I’ve shied away, only offering scraps of responses along the way because I don’t know how to put words to the feelings I have.
He looked into Harry’s eyes, and Harry nodded, a mirror of their first interaction earlier that evening.
James was the one to deepen the kiss first, wrapping one arm around Draco to pull him closer and bringing his other hand up to bury into his hair. He tilted his head so that their mouths slanted together and Draco moaned, “Harry.”
He was too close — after all the anticipation and the fantasies, he’d be damned if he let their first night end with quick blow jobs. A part of Draco still worried that even though they had confessed their mutual feelings, this could be their last night together if it didn’t go perfectly.
“No! Bloody he—no. I’m still rich, but Blaise and I found rooms that had been unused for decades and found records from my great uncle. He was an inventor, more or less, and had been disowned for being a blood traitor. I never knew. My father and grandfather had told me there had only been one heir for generations…. Actually, can I grab some water?”
His eyes meet Draco’s blown pupils, and suddenly his sensations are tenfold. He’d suspected that each snap of Draco’s hips has been propelled by the thrust of a tentacle in Draco’s arse, but now he
my mistake. I’ve been making them all evening, all because of those piercing green eyes that are fixated on me, for reasons unknown.
Harry laughed against his stomach, “You’re all mine, you berk.” He punctuated each word with a light kiss. “May I?”
He had been in the magical world for so long; he had begun to believe that he was used to the surprises that new experiences brought. This, however, was torture. To him, apparition had always felt like going through a tube. Now, he felt like every atom in his body was being pulled and pulled. His head throbbed, and he wished for an end to the pain. Those Death Eater knockoffs had developed a horrifying new curse.
The maitre d’ showed them to their seats, tied the balloons together above them with a flourish, and then tapped the balloon Harry had chosen for Draco. A shower of green glitter floated through the air, disappearing just before it hit the table. The green balloon, on the other hand, contained reddish-purple glitter.
In Harry’s mind, it confirmed that the main thief was not connected with the other thieves. Despite what Lewis had said, he thought the loss of invisibility was a mistake and not a taunt. It didn’t explain the hat, but would explain why it only appeared at the one crime scene.
Eventually, Marcus admitted to intentionally making Draco jealous. The Chaser refused to apologise for “pushing him to do something about his embarrassingly obvious yearning.” When Draco saw him with Oliver, however, he knew that Marcus had once pined just as pathetically.
I’ve never seen him jump up so quickly, barely pulling his trousers on before he’s almost out of the room.
My lights flicker on and the door opens. I see the panicked look in Master Malfoy’s eyes as he races to the toilet, slamming the door shut behind him.
He opened it and was dumbfounded when he saw the stereotypical Weasley jumper. It was forest green with a grey outline of a dragon in the middle. He appreciated the implicit acceptance that the personalised jumper represented and stifled a laugh at the thought of how horrified his father would be if he ever saw it. He noticed Harry also fighting the urge to chuckle as he opened a matching jumper.
“Potter, call me Draco. You started at the wedding and then stopped, but you’ve been calling Blaise by his first name all day,” he continued, looking away from Harry at the trees and Muggle homes lining the street.
Capucine, meanwhile, was putting on music “to set the mood for channelling feelings.” It was a Muggle song that Draco didn’t know, but the bass was heavy, and the singer’s voice was raw and scratchy. If he wasn’t mistaken, this was a Muggle rock band — not a love ballad or even a string quartet.
He sat in his usual armchair in the library at Grimmauld Place with Hermione on the floor by his feet. Her hair was held up in an impromptu bun secured with a Muggle pen. She always used pens for their ease and efficiency when she had to take notes quickly. Blaise and Malfoy had never written with them before and would often absentmindedly reach out to try to dip the nib in an inkwell.
“Harry doesn’t hate you. He’s loyal to his job, but might help if he knew that you’re doing the right thing.”
He took refuge in the loo as he processed the misunderstanding of the evening. He had two options: admit he wanted it to be a date or try again. He attempted to muster the courage for the first option, but rejection on top of his humiliation? Not today.
Back to its original size, the unassuming package is heavy in my hands. Hefty. Swooping letters in thick, black Sharpie cover the brown paper. If I’d read it before, I would have recognized the perfect penmanship.
“He’s been trained in stealth by the best of the best. We only have a few tricks we learned from my great uncle’s stuff. I’m pretty sure. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s followed me and he’s even better now. He hates me.”
Draco dismantled the glowing charms as instructed by Blaise, while Harry tuned out the words to maintain his focus on their situation. He was glad he did when someone crossed the threshold as the last charms fell, and Draco used an Unlocking Charm to open the Muggle protective case.
One of my favorite parts of the day is “scaring away the monsters.”  Reg insists, and it gives me a chance to shoot a cleaning charm under his bed.  Afterwards, I get to release my frustration by screaming.  Reg joins me, and we always end up giggling.
My mind is blank. I’m not sure if I’ll ever process that statement. I run through those words, individually and in pairs. I know what they mean, but
The last three years have been amazing. We’re brilliant as Auror Partners, and at home there’s nothing I love more than sharing a meal (Harry’s an amazing cook) and then curling up by the fire together to catch up on reading. But lately there’s been less time for that.
A knock on the door, then, “Draco, is everything all right in there? Any side effects from the potion splatter on your skin? Again, really sorry about that. I already cleaned up the broken glass, paid the apothecary owner for damages, and I’ll give you massages for a month. Promise.”
Living in Boston, a city whose tourism industry mainly revolves around defeating the British back in the 1700s, it’s a question I’ve asked myself before. It’s not uncommon to walk around downtown, unintentionally along the Freedom Trail, and see historical re-enactors, coffee to-go cups in hand as they stroll around in red coats, prepared to surrender. There’s a whole museum literally devoted to dumping tea in the harbor. Which, honestly, is such a waste of perfectly good tea. Because tourists still actually do it, even though it’s littering and illegal.
If the painting represented his relationship with Harry, then the accident was the perfect last touch: another failed attempt at romance.
His back tenses. He’s steeling himself for his encounter with me, even as his eyes dart to the stairwell, as if contemplating fleeing the scene. Not that it matters. I’ve already seen him and know he works here.
“In sixth year, you found me crying next to the lake when I couldn’t find Trevor anymore. You told me that while no one could replace him, you would help me pick out an owl and offered ‘Rovert’ as a name.”
The team went to a nearby pub afterwards, and he learned just how much Quidditch players could drink. The first string Keeper winked and cheekily informed him it was only when someone else was paying.
That’s when he saw him: the familiar head of platinum blond hair, long and tied back in a silky ponytail. Their eyes met, and Harry sucked in a breath at the stormy grey eyes that stared back at him. He couldn’t look away. He nodded in acknowledgment and stood up.
“I love you, darling.  Forever and always, no matter what.  I love you,” I whisper and kiss his little forehead.
I can’t believe Harry convinced me to let our children use my last name.  He said that we should start a new chapter for the Malfoy lineage.  I felt honored at the time.  Now I know: the Malfoy name should have died with me.  Even having the Chosen One as their father can’t erase the contamination of my name, of my past... of
Blaise’s and Draco's jaws dropped at Neville’s take. He thought that bloody Harry Potter, the Chosen One, and the auror in charge of investigating them would… help? How? This was Draco’s problem with Gryffindors. The idea was reckless.
Light tears turn into loud sobs that wrack through my body.  I put my fist to my mouth so Reg can’t hear me.  I don’t want him to see me like this.  I can’t let him see me like this.
He had stayed as busy as possible in the meantime. He had reviewed Asmo’s journals himself, brewed potions for the orphanage he sponsored, and reviewed the ledgers for his investments.
They ate out often, both for Draco's work and for dates. Draco had always loved his job, but his meals definitely tasted better with good company. His editor even claimed that his reviews and critiques were less acerbic and biting than they had been.
He waved and smiled at how much and how little his friend had changed since they first met on the Hogwarts Express. Neville wore a tan coat with a patch over one of the side pockets, which bulged from his hands, and featured a grass stain on his right arm. He held himself with confidence, but his face betrayed his apprehension.
"I'm sorry I haven't been round as much as I should have been," he said, pretending that she was able to hear him, mostly for himself. He could hear the clock ticking on the wall, and the healers bustling up and down the hallway. His mother was probably in a deep, dreamless sleep, not to be troubled by either his apprehensions or excuses. Regardless of whether or not she could hear him, he began to talk to her as he always did when he visited. He told her about his day, about what the weather was like outside, about all the things he was sure she would have wanted to hear about his father. It was therapeutic in a way, to lie to her in a way that made his circumstances seem much better than they were. He knew it always made her happy to hear these things, and it brought him some kind of perverted, nearly delusional satisfaction to hear the words coming out of his own mouth.
It was a memory that Draco would not soon forget, however much had taken place since that year. It seemed like a different lifetime, before Voldemort had gained much of his power, before he was forcing Draco to torture prisoners in his own living room. It was before the war, before Draco had lost his parents, his home, and everything he had once loved.
“Sort of, I guess. I went there at the beginning of the summer,” Harry said. “After you had come by my place, when I was mostly just trying to figure out whether or not I fancied blokes. My godfather used to go there all the time, he had written some letters about it.”
“Yeah,” Harry whispered urgently, squeezing Draco’s hand. He brought his full lips back up to Draco’s as Draco pushed himself inside.
“Don’t be. It’s a good place to think, I come up here every so often when I’m needing some clarity.” He drank from the whiskey bottle again, passing it back to Draco. The two of them sat in silence for quite some time. The sun was sinking further down in the sky every couple of minutes, and lights from households were beginning to illuminate the city like fireflies as it fell further into darkness.
‘Anyways, he saw all of my work and he offered me a job, and a desk and access to his own library, which had five times the amount of medical textbooks that were on the shelves downstairs. I don’t know if you knew this, but the institute used to be the headquarters for the International Magical Medical Practice, which also doubled as the infirmary that’s now located at St. Mungo’s before the whole practice moved to America. His office used to be the Dean’s, so his entire personal collection stayed with the building.”
They laid there for a moment, breathing gently as the wind rippled through the trees. The chill air was forming goosebumps upon the exposed skin at Draco’s neck.
He had gone into Knockturn Alley to procure some dittany and heal his splinched shoulder. Just as he had anticipated, the shopkeeper had approached him once more to ask him if he would be interested in selling any Laethelixir, the bright blue liquid vial that he had been offered last time he was in the shop. Draco had refused, sure that he would be able to afford his expenses as soon as the ministry had sorted through all of his father's possessions in the manor, and added as much time on to his sentence as they saw fit. The weeks came and passed, however, and he was only sliding deeper into debt and growing more and more desperate. He visited his mother every day, still managing to put on a smile and tell her whatever lies he happened to come up with (Potter was working with his contacts at the ministry to get Lucius another hearing, Draco had reconnected with a lovely, pureblood witch who was going back for her last year of Hogwarts in the fall), and then he locked himself in his room in the Leaky Cauldron and tried to not think about the fact that his mother was going to die, and that he was going to follow her to the grave much sooner than expected if he couldn't turn this around somehow.
“You don’t fancy a drink somewhere, do you?” He asked. Draco looked a little disoriented, obviously surprised that Harry wasn’t leaning into his kiss like he clearly expected he would.
"Are you our new dad?" the girl asked, keeping the door open only far enough for Draco to see into the entryway. It was filled with scattered laundry and what looked like piles of trash stacked against the walls. The smell of the stale, unclean surroundings was spreading slowly into the hallway. Draco blinked, slightly taken aback. He wasn't good with children; he didn't know how to respond to a question like this.
“Are you s-sure?” Draco stuttered, remembering that Harry had told him he had never been with a man before. “You’re not too drunk?”
"Who are you?" The girl asked, holding onto the doorknob with both hands and swaying back and forth lazily in her faded purple nightgown. She had stringy, dark blonde hair and very large, brown eyes. Draco heard another child begin to start crying from within the apartment.
It was the most erotic thing Draco had ever witnessed in his life, Harry’s bare chest was flushed red, his body wet with rain and sweat, his stiffened cock slapping against his stomach with each bounce. He was moaning again, riding Draco faster than Draco had even been fucking him, making Draco squeeze his eyes shut with pleasure.
He sunk his body into Harry’s, interlacing both of their hands and bringing Harry’s above his head, taking in his delicious scent with each breath. It was as though he were taking a snapshot every single time he touched Harry’s body so he could remember what it would be like later, as though it was surely not something he would be lucky enough to revisit. He didn’t know why he felt this way, like every second they had together was a sacred memory, but figured it probably had something to do with the amount of time he had spent pining over Harry, and Draco being unable to believe that this was actually still happening to him. If he wasn’t careful, he might accidently let that slip out between the wet kisses he pressed into Harry’s lips.
“The place I have in mind is… Well it’s not really a spot that wizards normally hang around. But it’s brilliant.”
“When my father went to Azkaban, after our fifth year, after the Dark Lord gave me his… Task,” Draco started, knowing that they both understood what he was talking about, “My mother and I rented a flat above Diagon Alley for the summer, so I could learn everything I could about… how to do it.”
When they had finished their fifth round of drinks Harry reached out and kissed Draco, pulling Draco’s body into his own and smiling into his lips. Neither of them cared who was watching them. They were safe here, in their own, anonymous club, filled with people who were like them. They could forget for a minute about the war, about the dangerous predicament both of them were in. They were just two men who could very well have been muggles kissing in a bar. It was as simple as that. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this happy.
His heart was racing in his chest. The look of mild interest on Bennett’s face when he had seen them was still burned in the back of his mind. Had he been able to recognize them from so far away? Was he following them right now? Draco didn’t have time to stop and think about the possibility of them being pursued; he only wanted to get the hell out of here as soon as possible.
There was a new drawing that had been placed on her bedside table. He picked it up and smiled at the two figures interpreted on the parchment - one of them very tall with long, straight hair and a smile on her face, and the second a small boy with vivid, yellow colored hair who appeared to be holding hands with the woman. It was a sweet picture, like many of the ones the child had left in her room before. Draco had met him a couple times when the child was being shepherded by his father around the hospital wing. His mother had taken a particular liking to him, always asking engaging questions and usually having a couple spare pieces of chocolate to share with the boy. Draco couldn't help but think that part of the reason his mother took such measures to be kind to the boy was that he reminded her of her own son, who was spending less and less time in the ward these days.
“About a mile,” Harry said, pointing in the direction they would need to head. “Fuck you, London!” He shouted at the top of his lungs. Draco couldn’t help but laugh, Harry looked just like an adorable puppy with his sopping wet hair and his glasses which had been rendered utterly useless. He took them off and placed them in his jacket pocket.
Draco was sitting on the roof, wearing one of Harry’s old jumpers and drinking from one of the bottles of firewhiskey that he had retrieved from the kitchen. Harry walked over and sat beside him on the slanted roof, taking the bottle from his hands and taking a swig of the whiskey himself.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded. He was still feeling the heightened buzz from all the alcohol they had consumed at the bar. That and heartburn, that was. “Yeah, I’ll tell you.”
“I thought we were supposed to stay here,” Draco said, adjusting his jumper to bring the sleeves further down on his wrists. It was a little too short for his long, narrow arms, which Harry thought made it even more endearing on him.
“Don’t,” Draco said, lowering Harry’s outstretched wand. “It’s better like this.” He wanted to say it wouldn’t matter either way, because he planned on having their wet clothes in a pile in the corner as soon as possible, but figured he would just let that happen organically.
"I'm sorry to hear that," he said, avoiding eye contact. He fiddled with the zipper on his bag once more.
The rain had given them little warning, and soon began to fall with a startling velocity, as though it had been waiting for the perfect opportunity to soak them through to the bone. They scrambled back to their feet, Draco realizing as he stood up that he was still too drunk to apparate anywhere, and assuming the same must be true for Harry.
“He just introduced himself at the bar and bought me a drink,” Harry continued. “I didn’t think anything of it, except that maybe he was hitting on me, but now I’m not so sure.”
“God, you’re so tight,” he exclaimed, grasping Harry’s hand a bit harder so he could focus on not orgasming right away. He had never felt this close with anyone he had ever slept with before, and wanted it to last for as long as possible.
They were welcomed onto the lit-up floor by two shirtless muggles with body paint on their chests who looked to be around their own age. After exchanging incomprehensible pleasantries over the roar of the music, they slowly migrated into the flow of men who were dancing and grinding in the center of the room. There were hands and bodies and drinks everywhere, it felt like a bit of a chaotic fever dream the longer they stayed in the middle of the crowd. Harry was right about the dancing; nobody seemed to care about doing it properly. Everyone appeared to be intoxicated to an extent, and he was blending right into the throngs of people as he couldn’t remember doing since he was a young boy.
“It was never serious,” Draco said, his eyes gleaming as though remembering an old joke. “We mostly just experimented together, practiced getting each other off. He liked girls too, but I was always around, and we slept in the same dorm anyways, so we just helped each other out.”
The hospital was more crowded than usual as Draco checked in at the reception desk, walking down the familiar hallway to his mother's room at the end. He had decided to leave Hogsmeade after he had made his last delivery of the day. Rather than completing his circuit of regular customers as he was accustomed to on a Saturday evening, he went straight back to the Leaky Cauldron and took a long, hot shower, letting the steam from the water seep into his pores and wash off some of the guilt and revulsion from the day. He would like to have said it helped, but he could still feel the gravity of the situation he was in like an ever-present anchor tugging him slowly downwards, making him feel more desperate and trapped by the minute.
Draco nodded, keeping his book bag secured at his side. He was feeling more uncomfortable by the second.
“Who is he?” Harry asked, clearly referring to the man that they had both seen before Draco had asked that they leave. “Do we need to leave London?”
It was with great reluctance that he ended up in Mulpepper's Apothecary only a couple weeks after he had purchased the dittany, requesting to speak with the shopkeeper about the opportunities he had available for a "distributor". It was much easier of a process than Draco had anticipated; the job entailed visiting a list of clients that had already been compiled by several of the shop owners in Knockturn Alley, and taking whatever action necessary to avoid ministry workers and Aurors. Draco would have to be quick on his feet and adaptive to ever-changing circumstances, as the ministry was currently going to great measures to investigate and stop the spread of this potion in the wizarding community. They claimed that, due to the addictive nature of the elixir, lethal overdoses were known to occur when the potion was administered improperly. Mulpepper denied this rumor most adamantly, insisting that none of the client base he had built had ever reported any such instance; it served as a fear-mongering tactic more than anything. Nevertheless, Draco would need to build his client list under the guise of a deliveryman for the bookshop adjoining the apothecary. The books he exchanged had been hollowed out to include a couple of the vials inside the covers to circumvent Ministry suspicion.
“Fuck,” Harry exhaled, laughing and resting his hands over his head. “I haven’t ran that fast in months.”
“That was years ago, Potter. Give it a rest.” He took the bottle from Harry, grinning broadly now. Harry thought once more of leaning over to kiss his smiling, pink lips, hoping to catch him off guard as he did the first time he had kissed him in the kitchen, but he held himself back. He still wanted to know more about Draco’s life, while they were on the topic.
“Come here,” Draco muttered, pulling Harry’s mouth back against his. His heart was racing faster than it had been when they ran through the streets earlier. He traced the dark hair on Harry’s chest with his index finger, running his thumb across a pink, hardened nipple like he had so wanted to do back in June.
“I never asked you to.” Draco stated, his voice barely audible above the noise of the city from below.
The sounds they were making were positively out of this world. Draco’s balls were smacking against Harry with each thrust, Harry’s moans and whines rising with each increase of speed.  Draco was enamored by the way Harry looked, the way he felt around Draco’s cock; everything about him was astounding.
Draco started slow at first, just letting the sounds Harry made guide him to what he should be doing, pulling out and pushing back in and eliciting the most heavenly moans from Harry with each movement. After a few times he pushed himself almost fully into Harry and felt the other man’s body tense, then immediately withdrew, squeezing Harry’s hand.
He brought his tongue back down to Harry’s neck, revelling in the taste of his skin, and pausing to lap at the hollow of his collar bone.
His own shirt was off before he knew it, and this time Harry paid no attention to any of the marks on his chest or wrists. Harry was slipping out of his jeans and pushing Draco towards the study with each kiss, and Draco unfastened his own pants before Harry backed him into another wall.
“You found my spot,” he said, speaking to Draco as the other man stared straight ahead, watching the cars roll through the crowded London streets. He looked as though he might have been crying, although it was often hard to differentiate sadness from general weariness when it came to interpreting Malfoy’s emotions. “You scared the living hell out of me first, mind you.”
“Did your mother do anything about it?” Harry asked. He couldn’t picture Narcissa sitting idly by if she knew any of this was going on.
“Hey,” Harry said conversationally, bringing his hand to rest on Draco’s arm. “I understand the stakes. I knew what I did when I brought you here, I’m not under any kind of delusion that this isn’t dangerous.”
Harry glanced sideways at him again, trying to discern Draco’s mood. The tightened jaw, the uncharacteristically ruffled hair, the way his arms rested on his knees and the curve of his usually rigidly straight posture. He couldn’t help but think how attractive Draco looked in the woolen knit sweater he had borrowed, how the dark brown and red patterns were so much warmer than the colors he usually wore.
“God, you feel good,” Harry whispered, squeezing Draco’s hands and grinding his hips against Draco’s own. Draco hadn’t noticed he had a full-on erection until this moment; he had been too wrapped up in kissing Harry’s mouth for it to register. He barely stifled an involuntary groan at the feel of Harry’s own tight jeans against his.
“Well I splinched my shoulder almost clean off when I left your kitchen in June,” Malfoy replied. “I guess you could say the same for me.”
“You’re going to fucking kill me, Potter,” he whispered back, releasing Harry’s hands so that he could trail his own down Harry’s body, feeling every divet, every muscle on his chest. He kissed Harry’s open mouth again, but this time nearly jumped out of his skin as the two heard a loud, cracking noise overhead.
“She’s trapped in a room by herself. It’s the same thing.” Draco responded, still looking out over the city.
“Instead of working on the task like I should have been doing all summer, I was using the library at the Law Institute to study healing. I was there nearly every day with my books spread out all over the reference section, and one day he was there before I was, reading over all of my notes and looking through my journals. He’s a lawyer, but he’s a doctorate professor there too. He had a case he was working on that involved the invention of healing spells, which is something I’d been researching on my own nearly all summer.
“So you’ll do it?” Harry asked, intertwining his fingers with Draco’s once more. Draco couldn’t remember feeling this intimate with someone in recent history, their naked bodies casually pressed against each other on the sofa, Harry’s thumb rubbing circles against the outside of Draco’s hand.
"I really couldn't say, I don't know." He zipped his back shut once more, taking a step away from the woman. The child on her hip continued to sob, his cries growing louder and louder by the second.
“No, don’t stop -- That’s fucking incredible…” Harry pulled Draco by his arse back into him, this time letting Draco slide completely inside. Now, Draco was the one practically shouting.
It was the kind of bliss he had never known before. He had had good sex, sure, but this was close to a religious experience. Nothing he had ever done before had felt so right, so fantastically good. He let out a moan as Harry brought his mouth all the way up to Draco’s hilt, as though he had done this thousands of times before. He began to bob his head back and forth in earnest, making Draco wonder if he was going to cum right there on the spot.
“Well I think there’s only one way we can fix that,” Harry said, his fingers brushing against Draco’s on the ground beside him.
“I’ve been wanting this for years,” He said. The drops of rain were still caught in his eyelashes. Draco noticed that his tip was almost the same color as Harry’s beautiful, pink lips. “Course I’m sure.”
“Draco?” He bellowed, grabbing his wand from the side table and cramming his glasses on his face. He ran to the top of the staircase and yelled Draco’s name again, not hearing any response issuing from below. His heart rate steadily rising, he cast a “Homenum Revelio” charm to save himself some time. He wondered for a sickening moment if this spell worked on the dead, but quickly pushed the thought out of his mind when a small spark issued forth from the end of his wand. The light circled the landing between the bedrooms for a moment, then halted in mid-air at the window half-way up the stairwell leading to the roof. Harry let out a deep sigh of relief, knowing exactly where Draco had gone. He ended the spell, tucking his wand into his pocket and prying the window open.
“So are you going to tell me what the hell happened back there?” Harry asked pointedly, his breath already slowing back to its normal rhythm. His auror training had clearly prepared him for that unexpected bout of exercise.
“Fuck,” Harry exhaled, watching the whisp of vapor that formed from the warmth of his breath meeting the chilled air.
"I'm so sorry," she said, referring to the child who was continuing to sob on her shoulder. "It's been a little rough - my husband was killed in the battle in May."
Harry’s face was only inches away from Draco’s. He was still for a moment, and then Draco could see his eyes flick up to Draco’s own through the dim light of the distant lamps.
"I'm a friend of your mum's," Draco spoke, checking the note one more time. "Is she home by chance?"
The room was dark when Harry awoke, the glimmer of sunset barely visible through the crack in the velvet blinds draped across his window. For a moment it seemed as unremarkable as any other day, the sound of London traffic echoing below, the slight chill in the air that accompanied September evenings spreading goosebumps up and down Harry’s arms.
“His name is Mitchell Bennett,” Draco said, speaking slowly. “I was seeing him when that article came out this summer in Witch Weekly, and I was worried that.... He would be the first person Delev’s men will go after when they can’t find me.”
His fantasy was derailed only a moment after it had begun when a familiar, redheaded witch appeared around the corner of the aisle, holding a broom servicing kit and pointing out something to Harry on the box. He laughed, tossing his head back and placing the book in his hands back onto the shelf. She looked pleased with herself for eliciting such a reaction from him.
“I thought about you too,” Draco said, the corners of his lips turning upwards. “More often than you did, I guarantee it.”
“No,” Harry said, interrupting him. “It’s not, I just… had no idea.” He leaned back on the rooftop so that his elbows were supporting his weight.
“I am too, believe me,” Harry laughed, remembering his disastrous encounter with Pavarti Patil at the Yule Ball. “We’re both drunk, it doesn’t matter.” Harry fixed Draco with what he was sure was a devilish smile, hooking his fingers through Draco’s belt loops. “Let’s just let loose.”
It was the best he could remember feeling after sex. It was everything he had wanted, everything he had dreamed of for so long, and now it was Harry collapsing against his body, his messy hair nuzzling against Draco’s chest.
He was so, so happy. And so, goddamned tired. He didn’t care that they were covered in spunk and their wands were in the hallway with the rest of their clothes. He just wanted to hold Harry against his chest like that for the rest of his life, and maybe the next life as well.
The smirk on Draco’s face made him look like his old, teenage self. It was reassuring to see that he was slipping back into his old persona, that the events of the last 24 hours hadn’t completely wiped out all of his infuriating tendencies that were now as equally charming as they were irritating.
“I just…” Draco shut his eyes, lifting his head up to the sky. “I don’t want to abandon her. She’s not like father --  She never wanted the Dark Lord to win. She just wanted us to be together. She doesn’t deserve to die alone in a prison cell for that.”
“I’ll race you there,” Draco grinned, hoping for the best -- if they got there fast, they could pick up right where they had just left off.
He looked up at Harry’s flushed face, at the slightly nervous look of his upturned eyebrows, and could tell that Harry wasn’t far behind him. Draco wrapped one of his hands around Harry’s cock once more and began to jerk it towards him. Harry let out a string of swear words as he continued to ride Draco’s cock, moving faster and faster, matching the pace that Draco set stroking him.
“He was 26,” Draco said, his voice a little quieter than it had been before. He had borne some of the responsibility for their relationship when it had first started, but he had really only lied about his age so he could have a desk in the library to come to every day that was away from the prying eyes of his constantly fussing mother, who would barrate him with questions about his task every time he set foot through the door each evening. The institute had become his safe place during that summer, and he was willing to overlook the fact that he might have been taken advantage of because of all the good that came out of his learning experiences there. He thought he had loved Bennett at the time, which was the craziest part as he looked back on all of this. He was a 16-year-old child. He didn’t know the first thing about love, or about loss. He wouldn’t learn of those things until this year, when everything he had known had been taken from him and he could no longer be reminded of the time in his life that Bennett represented.
Harry didn’t ask questions when Draco grabbed his arm and led him towards the back of the club, bounding up the spiral staircase leading to the loft area two steps at a time. Draco was almost sure he had seen an emergency exit when they were here earlier.
He had forgotten that Malfoy had said his name. Evidently, Draco had too, as they both just stood there and looked at each other like the universe was slowly starting to make sense, all at once.
“No, she never found out. I got really good at healing charms, so I would fix whatever marks he left and just keep it a secret.”
Harry scanned the crowd around them, only to find that people were not, in fact, watching them, but were completely transfixed upon their own partners, dancing and enjoying themselves just as much as Draco and Harry were. Harry glanced towards the entryway, which was clearly visible from this part of the floor, and was shocked to see a familiar tall, sandy head of hair make his way towards the bar.
“I can’t, Potter. It’s hundreds of galleons a week just to keep her in the hospital. I can’t imagine how much it would cost to bring her here. I couldn’t ask you to do that.”
As soon as the fact that they were in a gay club had fully sunk in for Draco, he became about as enthusiastic as Harry had ever seen him. After their first round of drinks Draco had insisted they do shots, him and Harry laughing as they linked arms to swallow the contents of their glasses whole. They walked jauntily throughout the club, their hands linked together tightly as Harry gave Draco a “tour” of the place, as though he were an old patron of this building who knew all of its nooks and crannies intimately. They ascended a spiral staircase to the second floor, where there were several couples engaged in what looked to be a little more than snogging, and even scurried past a group of four that were overtaking the chaise lounges Harry had his eye on previously. They went back for two more rounds, their words beginning to slur as they clinked glasses again and again. Harry had never seen Draco this happy, this animatedly charming. All of the worries they had been discussing only a couple hours ago seemed millions of miles away.
Draco didn’t know how long they were like this -- his mind seemed to lose track of time entirely in between the kissing and the fucking -- but at some point Harry had wrapped his legs around Draco’s back and pulled himself up to ride on top.
“We won’t let her die alone. We can send her to live with your aunt, we can even bring her here. I’ll pay for the healers, I’m sure that given the circumstances we could bind them to confidentiality. Nobody would have to know.”
Draco didn’t speak, but the look in his eyes reminded Harry of his own reaction when Hagrid had brought him to Diagon Alley for the very first time, when he had learned that there was a whole community of people who were just like him, and he wasn’t as alone as he thought he had been. That had been one of the best days of his life.
Harry was starting to realize just how lonely of a life Draco had led. Each time he had encountered something that seemed impossibly difficult in his years at school, he at least had Ron and Hermione to talk to. He couldn’t imagine having to keep everything that happened to him a secret, not being able to confide in anyone around him. It was no wonder that Draco had felt like he was at the end of his rope the previous night.
“I think I always knew,” Draco said. “Well, I always knew I wasn’t interested in girls, at least.” He took a deep breath. “I tried to deny it for the longest time, but Blaise and I started messing around fourth year, and I think everything sort of clicked into place then.”
He remembered kissing Draco as he pulled him up the staircase, the feeling of Draco’s warm breath on his neck as his fingers interlocked with Harry’s, and then he remembered falling asleep listening to the gentle drum of water hitting the floor as Draco showered in the master bathroom. He had stirred for a brief moment when Draco climbed in bed next to him, and then had pulled the other man’s clean, sweet-smelling body into his own. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, his face buried in the platinum blonde hair that still smelled somehow of the cologne Harry had come to associate with him, and let an entirely new feeling of comfort wash over him as he fell back asleep. He didn’t have a single nightmare, and he couldn’t remember feeling more well-rested since before the war.
Harry looked up at him with his beautiful, green eyes, and pressed Draco’s cock against his lips as he responded.
He looked from her face to the crying child and back again, still visibly uncomfortable. What if his actions seriously injured one of the innocent and fatherless children in her home?
Harry thought again of that time after Quidditch practice, when he had unwittingly walked in on Draco and Blaise together. He thought about how many times this scene had run itself through his head afterwards. Even in the midst of everything going on that year, and despite his justified hatred of Draco, he had still managed to retain that memory and utilize it when he was alone in his four poster bed at school, desperate for the relief that it brought him to imagine himself in that scene. He had never been able to explain the thrill that accompanied this particular fantasy, and it was only now starting to make sense to him.
“Oh god, no,” Harry pleaded with the skies, but Draco had already felt the first raindrop land on the back of his neck.
“Did he… do that often?” Harry asked. “You don’t have to tell me, if you don’t want to,” he added quickly.
“Basically, yes. Blaise had a girlfriend 5th year, so he didn’t want anyone finding out. Besides,” he continued, taking another swig of the whiskey. “It’s really stigmatized, especially in pureblood families. My father found us over break that year and beat the living shit out of me.”
It was late afternoon, and the summer heat was finally lifting in Hogsmeade, the cool breeze filtering through the trees and whispering around the corners of the brick buildings. Draco headed south at the Hog's Head, approaching the largest apartment building in the village, which he had entered several times before to meet with a couple of the clients he had established in this small wizarding community. He walked through the heavy oak door on the side of the building, which led to the rickety, wooden staircase he followed up to the 6th floor.
Draco felt his eyes widen in surprise, and saw the observation of his reaction evident upon Harry’s face.
He stayed at the foot of the bed, his hand stroking hers gently for what felt like an hour, until a healer opened the door and mentioned that they would be wrapping up visiting hours shortly. He nodded in response, wiping another tear away from his cheek before wishing his mother goodbye, planting the usual kiss on her forehead as he left.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, his voice also low. “He seemed charismatic enough when I met him last time at the bar-- I had no idea.”
“You’re good at that, Potter,” he said, brushing some dust off his shoulders. He had changed into a more formal-looking black shirt and a pair of Harry’s dark wash jeans, which, despite him being a bit taller than Harry, had fit him quite nicely. Harry wore a dark T-shirt and a denim jacket which provided him with some protection against the brisk, autumn air.
“Bullshit, Potter, you just wanted to prove you kissed me!” Draco propped himself on his elbow so he could see Harry’s silhouette in the darkness. He could tell Harry was smiling even without seeing his face.
“It’s right up here,” Harry said, slipping his fingers inside of Draco’s again and stepping towards the entryway to the bar.
“I wasn’t trying to do it,” Draco said, as they began walking towards the bar. “I didn’t think it was going to mess me up like it did. Besides,” he added, with a smirk in Harry’s direction. “That’s what I have you for now. You know… The fussing over me constantly part. Not the limb blasting,” he said, as though this was an important clarification that needed to be made. “Where is it we’re going, anyways?”
Of course. He had forgotten about the Weasley girl. Of course Potter had gone back to her; their relationship had been all anyone seemed to talk about at the end of his 6th year when Draco had far bigger concerns on his mind. He watched them through the glass, the way they were smiling and teasing each other, her short, blue dress that was clearly carefully chosen to attract his attention...
He never imagined his life would end up like this. He was supposed to have gone to healing school, he wasn’t supposed to be gay, and he was supposed to have parents who were both supportive of him and alive to care about him. He had every opportunity provided to him to accomplish great things, it had all gone wrong. He needed to think of a way to fix this without having to peddle off the rest of the supply surrounding him, the books stacked up 12 high on the desk and overflowing from boxes strewn around the floor. He had to find a place to live, and he had to get himself out of this mess.
"If you don't," she continued, pulling her hair back away from the child's iron grip once more. "I'll just get it from someone else."
“Let’s go dance,” Draco said finally, smiling again and slipping his long, pale fingers into Harry’s hand so they could walk together over to the dance floor.
Draco rolled on top of Harry so that he was hovering over his body, his arms pinning Harry’s body to the ground on either side.
“If we go by your plan, if we do everything by the book and I give the ministry the names they want, I… I’ll never see my mother again. It would be too much of a risk; Everyone would know to look for me at St. Mungos.”
“Careful there, Potter,” He said, a smirk on his lips. Harry was now running his strong hands all the way down Draco’s body, his fingers sliding the pants down and slipping underneath them.
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Harry said finally, as Draco had known he would, “What happened? How did the two of you even meet?”
Harry took this opportunity to look at Draco, to really look at him and take everything in. The slight, jutting curve of his cheekbones, the sharp angle of his jaw, the tendons and veins in his neck and the protruding bulge of his adam's apple. Every inch of him was pale, white like bleached parchment and then contrasting in beautiful, astounding ways; the dark eyebrows, the pink stains on his face where the wind had brushed against it, the cool, grey eyes that were like shining, frozen pools of ice. Harry thought he could look at him all day. He couldn’t quite express how he felt about Draco being here with him; the feeling didn’t seem to have words with which it could be communicated. The closest thing Harry could think of was “happy”, but it wasn’t just that. It was overwhelming relief, that he had someone here who understood him, that he didn’t have to go through the next couple weeks of his life alone in this house. He wanted to reach out and touch Draco just to make sure he was real, that this was really happening to him right now.
“Fuck, that’s amazing,” Draco muttered, staring down at Harry’s beautiful, freckled face, which was nestled right up against the blonde curls at the base of his cock. Harry brought his watery eyes up to Draco’s. He was so good, so eager to please, and Draco pulled his head back, slipping himself out of Harry’s mouth.
This one is a rough one, guys. Major content warnings for graphic sexual content, lots of foul language, and a suicide attempt. I swear it gets much lighter after this chapter, but if any of the above items are not things you are wanting to have in your life, feel free to skip right over this chapter. No hard feelings, and the ones to follow will probably be more fun for you anyways! Thanks for reading, as always!
“Right,” Harry said, feeling the blush rising back into his cheeks. He wasn’t even going to pretend that he understood the inter-student relationships within the Slytherin dormitories, or that he had the faintest frame of reference of what “experimenting” would have looked like with his Gryffindor classmates. It was a completely separate world from his own. He wondered how much different his life might have been if he had been sorted into Slytherin as well, if he might have been the one that Malfoy experimented with instead of Zabini.
Draco didn’t know if he was more shocked to learn that Harry Potter was a bottom, or that he “practiced” getting off by fucking himself with a dildo. He was sure he could use that visual to wank to for years to come.
“Sorry,” Draco said. Clearly he had just blurted out something that had been on his mind. He took a deep breath. “It just hasn’t sunk in yet, that it’s not just me. That I wasn’t making it up in my head.”
Silence fell between them again. Harry was wracking his mind trying to think of the right thing to say, but for some reason nothing was entering his mind. He felt his own discomfort mounting in the spaces between each of their breaths, and eventually spoke just to break the silence.
"No, I’m not," he said, starting to wonder if this stop had been a bad idea. "Can you run along and get your mum for me?" The girl stopped swinging off of the door handle, and nodded quickly, shutting the door. Draco heard quick footsteps echoing down the hallway inside.
They stumbled back into the study, this time Draco pushing Harry backwards through their kiss, and toppled upon the chaise lounge that they had been kissing on only earlier that morning. The gas lamps in the room cast a warm glow around them, and Draco was getting goosebumps all up and down his arms from the anticipation of what would happen next.
"What now?" Harry barked, not even bothering to look up given his mood. There was a beat of silence before Harry jumped as he recognized the voice of his visitor and glanced up in surprise.
“That sounds lovely,” Harry whispered, his voice raspy. “I know the Weasleys are the family I never had and I love them. But it means there was a family I never had. No grandparents, aunts, great uncles or even godfathers to grow up knowing or learning from and listening to or getting things passed down onto - favorite things, stories, memories. I only got Sirius for a tiny moment… Most of the time it’s okay because I don’t know any other way to be. But sometimes… sometimes it’s lonely.”
son had a brilliant display of magical potential. Well done, James,” he exclaimed, walking forward and ruffling James’ hair and dislodging a cloud of powder. James beamed up at him, unrepentant and proud.
Malfoy surprised Harry by offering to pay. Harry gave a token protest before Malfoy raised a single eyebrow at him. Biting his lip, Harry blushed and struggled to hide his grin as Malfoy settled up.
Finally, without moving, Draco ask, “You’re attracted to me?” If Harry hadn’t been so desperately waiting for Draco to say something, he would have missed the tiny hint of disbelief and uncertainty in Draco’s voice.
“He’ll be alright. He got caught in the path of a ricocheting Flagrante curse. There were some physical injuries to his head and ribs, and some spell damage. But we’ve healed all we can and the rest will just take time. We’re going to observe him over night just in case.”
“Why those four creatures?” Harry asked curiously, nodding his head at the crystal figurines on the shelf.
Draco sat down on the side of the bed, facing Harry. He reached out to hold one of Harry’s hands before folding his body over Harry’s and gently resting his face next to Harry’s on the pillow.
“Mate,” Ron said sympathetically as he placed a pint by Harry’s elbow. They sat in companionable silence sipping their drinks. Harry’s mind kept whirling with his stop at Malfoy’s office earlier. Malfoy had smiled! And joked! And laughed! Not that Malfoy was usually cold or aloof, but he was reserved and polite. Harry liked to think that since they had first worked together on a case two years ago that Malfoy had warmed to him a bit. There’d be glimpses of a smile. And occasional banter when parts of Malfoy’s previous snarky self would reappear, but with a tempered and clever edge that Harry couldn’t help find charming as they'd volley back and forth. But Malfoy’s small laugh, even if the joke was at Harry’s expense, felt precious.
“You two were always so fixated on each other during school - it was like you orbited around the other. Of course, you were obsessed for other reasons, but you always had this… chemistry and part of that was the competitive thing, but the way you two always had to grab the other’s attention… well, it makes sense there was probably some sort of magnetic attraction, doesn’t it?” Hermione said matter-of-factly, as if she were analyzing another run-of-the-mill court case or legal precedent, rather than completely upending Harry’s whole life view.
Emboldened, Harry leaned forward and gently rested his hand on Malfoy’s forearm resting on the table. “Great.”
“I had no idea you saw me… like you described,” Draco interrupted, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “With who I am and what I’ve done, I never expected...” he trailed off, a touch of vulnerability creeping into his tone. “I think it’s best if I go for now. I- I just need some time to think.”
“You,” Malfoy said sharply, pointing a finger at Harry’s face. “That was under-handed and sneaky, Potter and…what now?”
“Don’t expect it to happen anytime soon,” Draco quipped back. His fingers played with Harry’s stretched collar and he avoided Harry’s gaze as he asked, “Spend the night?”
As Harry had rambled, Draco had slowly turned to look at him. His face reflected blank disbelief. When Harry finished, Draco blinked and then turned back away. He sighed heavily and closed his eyes.
“Yes, Potter?” came the familiar voice. Harry stepped into the small, but tidy office and stood carefully in the middle of the carpet. Clearing his throat, he raised his eyes to to man behind the desk. “Um, I wanted to check in on the Jerikson case and if there were any… um any developments?”
Draco harrumphed, but gently took Lily into his arms. He tapped her nose gently and said, “That’s why you’re my favorite. You’re too precious to ever cause any trouble, aren’t you?”
Harry and Malfoy were working late in one of the MLE conference rooms. Outer robes had long been discarded as frustrated hands ran through steadily unruly hair and yawns were hopelessly stifled.
be assisting. I’m sure Potter will since he’s godfather and a sacrificing prat like that, but you can be sure that I’ll be off with Granger having an actual intellectual conversation on the latest academic journals while enjoying a plate of biscuits and you will be sorry.”
Harry trembled, wondering if he had gone too far, had laid all his cards out bare only for them to be swept away by Draco’s next words. He couldn’t believe how this had all mucked out, that he hadn’t made it clear to Draco that this was a
“Just any pain or discomfort. If you’ll be spending the night, I need to confirm if you’re family?” the Healer asked politely, as if she didn’t know who they were.
Harry couldn't fully process. Again, he found himself stunned, but now trying to absorb Malfoy's words and understand what was happening. It was probably the most he’d ever heard Malfoy speak at once. If anything, it was the vulnerable look on Malfoy's face that he was only partially succeeding in masking that spurred Harry into action.
Harry didn’t recall ever mentioning to Draco that it was his favorite restaurant, but he knew that somehow Draco knew.
“What?” Harry shrugged innocently. “I’m happy is all. No work crises so far today and just had a nice lunch with you.”
“Yes, yes, see you then,” Draco replied distractedly as he picked up his coat and looked around to the door. He strode over briskly before pausing as he grabbed the handle. “Goodnight, Potter,” he said quietly, barely looking over his shoulder back at Harry. “Thank you for dinner.” And then he strode out, closing the door behind him. The sudden crack of him Disapparating hit the air like a whip and Harry jolted, rubbing his chest as if it would help ease the ache throbbing there.
They were meeting at the lifts. Harry had just arrived when he saw Draco approaching. Harry smiled at him.
“I know what’s got your face looking like that, but you’re too tactful to say. Which is saying something knowing how abysmal your social graces can be,” he began with a half-hearted smirk. “‘A Malfoy encouraging such Gryffindor traits? There must be a snake figure slithering around somewhere!’”
Malfoy blinked before revealing his signature, gentle smirk. "Eloquent. The late night must be getting to your head." Before Harry could protest, Malfoy continued, "It's certainly getting to mine. I think it's best that we sleep on everything and come back to it tomorrow."
“So when does Harry get to meet your parents as the ‘boyfriend’?” asked Ron smirking before he took a sip of his pint.
“Potter, you gave me the case files four hours ago. While your opinion of my intellectual prowess is flattering, the unfortunate reality is that the potions analysis can take days,” Draco Malfoy said quietly with a ghost of a smirk.
