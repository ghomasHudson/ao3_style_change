Harry’s breath catches and he makes a strangled sound as he sinks into the heat of Draco’s body. He pushes in and in until he’s fully enveloped, and then he pauses. Draco whines in his ear but Harry ignores it, staying still and just feeling for a moment.
“You’re a rotten liar, Draco Malfoy,” Astoria says as she walks closer. She rests a hand on his arm and squeezes gently, “Just owl him.”
But because of ten precious minutes he’s here, his fingers tracing patterns on the soft skin of Draco’s back.
Harry may not have ever done this before, but like with so many other things, he’s a fast learner. And what he lacks in experience he makes up for with eager enthusiasm, swallowing Draco down again and again.
“Harder,” Harry demands, doing his best to rock back against Draco with more force, “I’m not going to break.”
Harry’s other hand holds tight to Malfoy’s hip, pulling him back onto Harry’s cock with every thrust. He mouths at Malfoy’s shoulder, biting—marking him.
Draco groans as Harry bites down, hard, right in the divot of his collarbones, soothing it with a soft lick after, “Harry. I want—
Any number of things could account for why Potter has tracked him down tonight. But regardless of the reason, Draco knows by now that this won’t end in a wand fight.
Maybe Harry isn’t home. Maybe he doesn’t even live here anymore. Draco doesn’t want to examine why that thought makes his throat constrict painfully.
Hermione opens the door and enters the room. Once she sees him still in bed and obviously in pain, she crosses the room quickly, her face telling Harry a lecture is coming.
“Fine,” Draco says relenting, “If I could pick anyone I wanted, I would have gone to the Yule Ball with Krum,” Draco finally answers. He wants to say
Draco quickly does as he’s told, undoing his belt with shaking fingers, the buckle clacking loudly as it hits the floor. Harry pushes him back onto the bed as soon as he’s kicked away his trousers and pants. He licks and sucks his way down Draco’s chest, stopping to bite roughly at Draco’s nipples.
“I wish I had a camera,” Harry mumbles to himself with a laugh. He’s regretting leaving his Muggle cell phone at home, even if the camera on it isn’t the best.
Harry isn’t sure how exactly to voice his question. Being tactful is not a talent he possesses. Malfoy is staring at him, an amused expression on his face, clearly just waiting for Harry to stick his foot in his mouth.
Anger floods Draco’s body at that and he quickly surges forward, his teeth biting into Potter’s bottom lip hard.
Draco nods to show he’s listening and waits for Harry to continue, smiling softly at Harry’s jumbled words. His rambling is embarrassingly endearing to Draco and currently doing terrible things to his rapidly beating heart.
Honestly, Harry’s presence is overwhelming, his familiar magic buzzing against Draco’s skin. It’s amazing that nearly a decade after defeating Voldemort, Harry’s magic still seems to seep from his pores, leaving no doubt to anyone in close proximity that he’s one of the most powerful wizards of their time.
Draco steps back a little and wipes his sticky hand on his shirt, too dazed to even consider casting a cleaning charm.
And yeah, that hurts. Harry knew Draco wasn’t going to react well to him unexpectedly showing up but a small part of him had hoped that Draco would be pleased to see him. Over the last few days his brain has conjured up countless images of a happy reunion between them, Draco running into his arms and a whole mess of other clichéd nonsense.
They don’t make it past the living room, frantically shedding their clothes and falling to the sofa tangled around each other.
“Malfoy, stop. You don’t need to leave,” Potter says hurriedly, he takes a step closer and Draco feels a lump form in his throat, “You shouldn’t be alone right now.”
Harry closes he eyes and takes a shaky breath. “Okay,” he says opening his eyes, keeping them fixed on Draco, “We’ll need to deal with this. Now.”
“Draco,” Harry whispers, and he knows his voice is too warm, too full of emotion but he doesn’t care. Draco looks so beautiful, his cock flushed and dripping, eyes blown wide. “You’re amazing, so good for me.”
So the entirety of the Wizarding population thinks he’s an Imperiused idiot, it doesn’t matter. It’s just a small blip in the grand scheme of things. Harry’s in love, and he has the approval of his best friends. Things could be worse.
“I just couldn’t do it anymore, ‘Mione,” Harry says with a shrug, “I lost the only thing that really makes me happy and now—“ he breaks off and tries to breathe. He wonders how long it’ll be before talking about Draco stops hurting so bad.
Somehow, they make it to the bedroom. As soon as the door is shut behind them, Harry crowds Draco against it and slots their hips together. The hard line of Draco’s cock presses against his own, the friction making them both moan.
“Fine,” Draco rasps before clearing his throat, “That’s fine, I don’t mind. Where are we going anyways?”
God, it’s really ridiculous how the smallest smile or touch from Harry turns Draco into a sappy, love-sick moron these days. Draco used to despise people like this. Those people so obviously in love and yet still so oblivious to the fact that they were. He hated that he now fell into that category.
After another moment, Draco starts up a steady rhythm, one hand cupping Harry’s balls and rolling them between his long fingers. Pleasure shudders down Harry’s spine, his body going hot and tight. Every slide of Draco’s mouth feels amazing, and he’s so close already.
The rest of the night is lost in a haze of heated touches and sweet words murmured against warm skin. Draco is drunk off the feeling of being in love, pressing against Harry, demanding harder and closer and more.
They both move. Draco turns in his chair, starting to stand but before he can Harry walks around the table and falls to his knees. He buries his head in Draco’s lap and hugs him hard around the waist. A choked sound escapes his lips as Draco’s fingers go to his hair, his manicured nails scrapping lightly against the warm skin of Harry’s neck.
“Harry James Potter! I’ve been calling for an hour. You have three seconds before I open this door, so you better cover up anything you don’t want me to see,” she yells.
“Yes but if I remember correctly that was because my date had two left feet. Thank Salazar dancing wasn’t a requirement in defeating Voldemort,” Draco laughs, clearly his brain to mouth filter isn’t functioning properly. Damn Firewhisky.
Not gonna lie, I'm super nervous about bottom!harry. I agonized over having them switch, but ultimately decided to say fuck it and hope for the best.
“How exactly are we going to sled?” Potter asks looking around, his eyes squinted in confusion, “It’s all so flat.”
But all too soon their movements become restless, both wanting more than their very public location allows and Draco pulls back, hands gripping Harry’s hips to stop their movement, pushing him away a little.
Draco shifts uncomfortably, the denim of the jeans he borrowed from Harry - magically altered to fit his longer legs and thinner waist - were still taking some getting used to. Harry had told him to dress causally and when Draco showed up at Grimmuald Place in tailored trousers and a crisp, grey button down shirt, Harry had smiled fondly and told him to come borrow something to wear.
“Everything’s perfect,” Draco replies before he notices the two brooms Harry has propped against the table, indicating them with a jerk of his chin, “I know you didn’t get my mother on a broom. You’re not that good,” Draco teases.
It’s messy, uncoordinated. Any finesse they usually have is gone, lost to desire and need. Draco is kissing him with an honest urgency that Harry’s never felt before, love and devotion pouring out of him in waves that threaten to swallow Harry whole.
It takes Draco a moment to get his bearings once they land but when he does, he turns towards Kade with wide eyes.
Draco whoops loudly as he jumps up, quickly stomping through the snow to where Potter is still sitting on his sled, looking for all the world like someone has just kicked his puppy. Draco grabs his arm and hauls him to his feet, roughly yanking the red and gold scarf off Potter, before unwinding his own.
“Yes,” Draco hisses, “That stupid owl of yours ruined my dinner again! I had things to do tonight, Potter, and instead I had to come over here and return this—what even is this?”
After they clean up, they drift easily off to sleep, limbs tangled together as close as they can get, neither of them knowing the absolute shit show the morning will bring.
Harry sighs in relief and pulls Draco against him, “Happy Birthday, Draco,” Harry says before capturing those pink lips with his own.
Harry pushes himself up on shaky arms, stealing a few kisses before he moves away. Once they’ve cleaned up, Harry pops open the bottle of champagne, filling their glasses and clinking them together.
Draco moves slowly, swaying a bit as he moves to lean back against the pillows. He looks high, eyes glassy and unfocused. Harry waits until he’s settled comfortably, and then he straddles Draco’s chest, shuffling forward until he can tap at Draco’s bottom lip with the head of his cock.
He doesn’t take Draco’s cock back into his mouth, leaving it leaking against his stomach and instead sucks and bites at Draco’s inner thighs, his fingers starting up a relentless rock inside his body.
It feels like he’s utilizing every muscle in his body to keep himself balanced as he slowly sinks down another inch. His thighs shake with the effort, hands trembling where he has them pressed against Draco’s chest. He curls his fingers, his nails biting into skin and eliciting a whimper from Draco’s panting mouth.
“He did.” Harry’s eyes look haunted for just a moment before they clear. “I spent the summer after the war remodeling it, but once it was done I couldn’t—“ Harry cuts himself off with a sigh. “Anyways, I didn’t want to just sell it, so I offered it to Andromeda. There’s a lot of space for Teddy to run around and a nice garden.”
As Harry’s eyes adjust to the dark of his bedroom, he realizes that he’s hard and leaking, a wet patch forming on the front of his sleep pants. A light breeze would set him off right now, and he’s never been so happy to be alone in the house.
Harry nods, throat suddenly tight, and gently lowers his body back down. Draco mouths at his neck, his shoulders, everywhere he can reach. “I’m not going anywhere.”
“You like that, Malfoy?” Harry whispers roughly, squeezing his hand, not tight enough to cut off Malfoy’s air, but with enough pressure so that he feels it, enough to let him know who’s in charge here.
Draco doesn’t say anything, just watches, his eyes tracking every movement as Harry works himself open. He’s done this enough on his own to know what feels good, knows the right places to rub to send sparks up his spine, and it isn’t long before he’s rocking back onto three fingers, craving more.
The sun is starting to set, the sky a beautiful orange-pink, puffy white clouds hanging lazily in the distance. The city is sprawled below them, full of people, cars, and lights. But up here everything is quiet and calm.
Draco moans around Harry’s cock, and Harry can only thrust—in and in and in—coming hard down Draco’s throat.
“And?” Hermione asks, tapping her fingers on the table. Pointer, middle, ring, pinky. Something Draco knows means her patience is thinning.
Watching Draco receive howler after howler was still shocking. Then the shock turned to anger and now he’s boiling at full on rage.
Kade Parker, an up and coming magical photographer, had been at a charity event the magazine covered last year. He immediately caught Draco’s eye, his camera hanging from his neck and his warm smile lighting up his face. They instantly hit it off, falling quickly into a relationship. And while Kade’s promising career, as well as his own, draws a lot of public attention from the Wizarding community, Draco found that he doesn’t really mind it. It’s nothing like the attention his relationship with Harry received. The main difference being, that here in New York, Draco isn’t looked down on as Death Eater filth. His intentions towards Kade are never questioned. They can walk down the street together without being harassed and Kade never has to save or defend Draco.
Hermione’s already sitting at the table with a cup of tea, nibbling on a triangle of toast, when Harry walks downstairs a few minutes later.
“Er right. Sounds like a plan then,” Harry says before turning to Al and offering his hand, “Come on Albus, we need to get you to your classroom.”
Andromeda is quiet for a moment, her eyes unfocused as if seeing something far away. “You know, I was only nineteen when I married Ted. Same age as you are now.” Draco follows her gaze to the picture that sits on a small table in the corner. In it, Andromeda and her husband—the uncle Draco never met—are sitting on a picnic blanket, smiling at one another. They look happy.  “We were married for twenty-eight years, which probably seems very long to you, but to me, it seems like such a short time now,” she says with a sigh, finally looking back to Draco, “I thought we would have so many more years together—I wish we would have. I wish he and Dora were still here with me but. Life had other plans, I suppose.”
Draco looks up through his lashes, meeting Potter’s eyes boldly as he snaps the elastic band of Potter’s boxer briefs against his arse. The sound echoes around the room and is only drowned out by Potter’s moan as he unceremoniously shoves his prick down Draco’s throat.
Draco sighs happily and leans back in, needing Harry’s lips against his own more than he needs the air in his lungs.
Harry should have gotten up the first time his alarm buzzed and he really, really should have known better than to give the boys pancakes on a weekday.
Potter refuses to let Draco use magic to help with the snowman, and by the time they have it complete, Draco’s arms ache and his fingers are numb. But the boys are pleased, adding Potter’s discarded scarf and a carrot nose to their creation.
“Because I’ve moved on from the past. I’ve grown up, we both have. But mostly because our sons are friends, and I will always do right by my son,” Malfoy answers, and Harry can’t very well argue with that.
“Come on.” Draco clenches down, digs his heels into Harry’s back. “Fuck me like you mean it, Potter.”
Hermione told Harry that Draco’s Portkey was leaving tonight. Harry argued with himself all week, finally deciding that he can’t allow things between himself and Draco to stay this way. He has to make things right before Draco walks back out of his life.
He’s proven right a minute later when a soft knock and Hermione’s voice floats through the bedroom door.
Once he’s completely encased in Draco’s body, as deep as he can get, Harry stops, muffling a moan against the heated skin of Draco’s neck and darts his tongue out to taste the salty sweetness under his lips.
He almost thinks that Draco has fallen asleep when he suddenly speaks, breaking the content silence.
The kiss that follows is coppery and wet. A desperate thing that has the ability to make Draco feel as though he’s breaking into a million pieces.
Harry presses him down, pinning his wrists to the bed as he pounds into him as hard as he can. Draco matches his pace, rocking up to meet each deep thrust, shaking and gasping every time. Draco babbles, an endless litany of demands. He begs and pleads, and Harry gives into every request. Harry goes harder, faster, holds Draco tighter. Sweat is dripping down his face, burning his eyes, but he keeps them open, watching with reverence as Draco starts to come apart beneath him.
As soon as the words leave his mouth Harry wonders just where the fuck they came from. Of all the stupid things to say, that’s what his brain managed to come up with.
“We—uh. We got to know each other better in eighth year.” Draco could feel his face flushing. “We’ve been…friends ever since.”
“So I’m on suppressants as well as wolfsbane. I can’t infect anyone but the full moon still takes a toll on my body. I have some physiological side effects, my temper is worse than before,” Harry runs a hand over his mouth before laughing solemnly, “Hence why I reacted the way I did at the bonfire. I really am sorry about that Draco. You didn’t deserve to be treated that way.”
“Yes, well, I’ve been rather busy,” Draco replies as he sits back down, refusing to feel bad about the long time in between visits. His mother does this horrible routine once a month and Draco doesn’t think his father deserves anywhere close to that much.
Harry stops, his lips hovering over Draco’s, “I’m gonna kiss you now. If you don’t want me to, you better do something to stop me,” Harry whispers, and Draco’s eyes fly open, a thousand questions swimming in their depths.
Before Harry can formulate an answer, James appears in front of them bouncing on the balls of his feet.
Harry speeds up his strokes then, twisting at the top and reducing Draco to a shaking mess—whines and whimpers falling from his lips. Desire, possessiveness and need all curl together tightly in the pit of Draco’s stomach, Harry’s hand the only thing able to soothe the knot of tangled emotions.
“Alright. Fuck,” Harry groans, “You’re so fucking beautiful Draco. Spread out like this for me. Only for me.”
Al and Scorpius are handed off to the teacher without incident leaving Harry with no other choice but to walk alongside Malfoy back to the Floo.
“Unfortunately we really do have to go but if you’re good,” Draco raises an eyebrow at that, “I’ll let you undress me however you want later.”
Harry’s learning, little by little, what kind man Malfoy has grown into. What surprises him most, is that Draco Malfoy turned out to be a pretty great dad. He’s hands-on and attentive, and it’s clear that his son adores him.
“So, I see we’ve progressed to the awkward question portion of this outing. Is it my turn then?” Malfoy asks, his lips twitching at the corners.
“You okay?” Harry asks, tucking a strand of hair behind Draco’s ear. The undeniable look of love shining in Harry’s eyes makes Draco thankful he’s already laying down.
Lovely, he has apparently broken Hermione. Draco can’t recall a time, ever, when Hermione has been so shocked that she’s incapable of forming a coherent sentence.
And he does. Draco feels caught, stuck in a sticky web, his will to break free crumbling before his eyes.
“Well?” Draco asks. He’s tired of this little game he and Astoria have been playing for the last few weeks. She knows if she pushes, questions him gently, and then stays quiet, Draco will have the impulse to fill the silence. It’s her favorite method for getting information out of him. But he has resisted, refusing to discuss the mess of swirling thoughts that have cluttered his brain ever since he collided with Potter that day at the school.
A hand on his elbow snaps Draco out of his panic. Potter gently guides him past the Floo and out the doors. The hand remains while they walk and Draco doesn’t shake it off, the light touch sending tendrils of fire down his arm.
Harry feels overwhelmed with a possessive need, his lips and teeth taking on a mind of their own as they mark Draco over and over again.
“I don’t know that I’d say exciting,” Draco laughs softly, lifting his mug and blowing across the surface of his tea, “But things are good. The magazine has gained a lot of popularity in the last year or so.”
Draco sags forward, forcing Harry to take his weight as he struggles to catch his breath, sucking in air as thick as treacle.
“You know,” Draco’s lips are stained red from the strawberries and Harry can feel the beginnings of arousal starting to course through his veins again, “You really outdid yourself. How are you ever going to top it for my birthday next year?”
Draco’s hands drive him crazy. The scar on his right thumb, the calluses from gripping a broom, the elegant way those long fingers wield a wand. They’re perfect. And if those hands weren’t holding onto him right now, Harry’s certain he would tremble apart.
“If I get this is on one try—you have to suck my dick,” Harry whispers the words, his face burning bright red but he doesn’t look away, keeping his eyes locked on Draco’s.
Looking back, Draco tumbling out of that fireplace and into Harry could have been disastrous. It could have ended just as easily with hexes and curses flying. But instead he found a partner, a lover, a best friend.
He’s jolted from his thoughts when he feels the magic of the wards tingle against his skin. Harry panics for a moment, thinking Draco has come back but he quickly disregards that, knowing that it’s probably just Hermione coming over to check on him.
They kiss until the ride starts to move again and even then they don’t pull back. It’s only when the ride operator clears his throat that they actually break apart, both with apologetic smiles but unembarrassed to have been caught.
The hot shower is wonderful and by the time Harry’s clean and pulling a shirt over his head, he feels almost normal.
“Draco, sit. Drink your tea,” his aunt says, snapping him out of his thoughts, “I’m just going to put Teddy down for his nap.”
As for the loud Muggles, the bright flashing lights and the smell of deep-fried food; he wasn’t so sure.
“Yeah well,” Harry absently rubs a hand over the back of his neck, not meeting Draco’s eyes, “I’ve had a lot of spare time and galleons, so. Yeah, I remodeled some.”
“Just a bit creepy,” Draco finally says with a smirk, “I watched you too,” and that wasn’t supposed to sound as flirty as it does.
Harry can’t quite believe his friend is taking this so well. “And you don’t care? I mean, it’s Malfoy. I know how you feel about him.”
it fucking was.” Harry breathes the words against his ear, his eyes tracking the full body shudder they cause. “We’re leaving.
Thankfully, whatever Harry was about to say is interrupted when someone turns up the wireless, a Weird Sisters song spilling loudly from the speakers.
“We’re friends,” Draco repeats, his words coming out sharper as his hands clench into fists beneath the table, “I care about him, and I really don’t appreciate what you’re implying.”
They stand wrapped around each other in silence for a few moments, Kade’s hands rubbing soothing circles on Draco’s lower back, before he slowly pulls out of their embrace and meets Draco’s gaze.
Astoria just tuts at him and walks to his dresser, sorting through the expensive bottles of cologne before selecting one.
“Oi!” Harry laughs, “I’m trying to tell you I love you, you irritating git,” Harry says, shaking his head and squeezing Draco’s hand.
Harry snorts. “No, definitely not. I thought maybe you’d be up for a quick seekers game with me,” Harry says, his eyes mischievous.
Malfoy’s angry, and that makes Harry feel off balance all of a sudden, completely thrown by this reaction. The chocolates are from Malfoy’s favourite sweet shoppe in Diagon—not to mention insanely expensive. He thought Malfoy would be pleased, which was stupid of him really, because Malfoy never seems to be pleased by anything Harry does. Well, aside from when they go at each other like crups in heat.
Draco sits in a small Muggle café, nervously drumming his fingers against the table. He has no reason to be impatient, he’s early after all, but he can’t shake the anxious feeling that has settled in his body.
The fact that it’s his hand that makes Harry come, splash after splash of warmth coating his fingers, is unbelievable. Something Draco cannot even begin to comprehend.
It’s been a shit day. A shit week actually. It turns out, Auror training isn’t as fun or rewarding as Harry built it up to be in his head. Robards has been insufferable, and what’s worse, is that he partnered Harry with Zacharias Smith—who is somehow even more of a prick than he was in school.
Harry lifts his head, dislodging Draco’s fingers. He stands and Draco worries he’s said the wrong thing, that Harry doesn’t understand. But Harry just straddles his lap and cups Draco’s face in his calloused hands.
Harry doesn't wait for Draco to reply, instead he simply turns away from the door, leaving it wide open. It isn’t exactly an invitation but Draco’s already well past the point of concerning himself with proper etiquette, so he storms into the house after Harry.
Damn right they will, Draco thinks. But now he’s curious. Was that an offhand comment? Something to tease and antagonize Draco with? Or did Potter really tell Granger that he and Draco are friends now?
“Lies!” Potter says with a laugh, “How is this any worse than when you made me name a Hogwarts professor I’d have sex with?”
Harry chooses not to acknowledge the surge of jealously he feels at the thought. But he can’t ignore the image his traitor mind conjures up—him and Malfoy out on a date, walking hand in hand, Harry pressing his lips against Malfoy’s at the end of the night.
, but he hadn’t been able to focus. His thoughts had repeatedly drifted back to his dream and thoughts of home.
Potter rests his forehead on Draco’s heaving chest, pressing gentle kisses against his collar bone and whispering soft words that Draco’s hazy brain can’t comprehend.
Harry’s heart feels like it’s rising higher, getting stuck somewhere in his throat. “I want you to fuck me,” he says, stopping to add lube and another finger.
He teases for a few more minutes, Harry getting louder and louder. Finally though, he relents and takes the tip of Harry’s cock into his mouth, letting out a groan at the taste of
“Would you stop moving,” Draco says, his voice hoarse and low. He’s rolled away from Harry in his sleep, but one hand is stretched across the bed, resting on Harry’s stomach, “You’re stealing all the covers.”
Harry leans closer to the huge spruce tree that’s currently taking up an entire corner of his living room, the distinctive scent of pine filling his nose. Al laughs in delight and as soon as he’s close enough, he hangs the colorful Christmas bauble on an empty branch. James is climbing back onto the small step stool, hanging his own ornament on the other side of the tree. He’s only dropped this one twice, Harry notes with satisfaction.
“I’m sorry I left so abruptly the other day. I should have listened to your side of things,” Hermione says in a quiet voice after a few minutes.
Draco bristles at hearing this. He practically begged Harry to leave the force, quite a few times, during their relationship. It stings to find out that Harry just up and quit after Draco left. He wonders what Harry’s reason for quitting was and why it was more important to him than Draco had been. A number of different possibilities, each more ridiculous than the last, flit through Draco’s mind.
Harry wraps his arms tight around Draco’s waist, and then the alley is spinning away and they’re landing in his bedroom a second later. Draco finally turns to face him, and something in Harry’s chest squirms in delight when he sees the finger shaped marks on Draco’s throat. Harry brushes his knuckles against the abused skin before drawing Draco into a desperate kiss.
Draco didn’t mean to say all that, but he can’t take it back. He watches Potter scratch blunt fingernails across the scruff on his jaw. He looks like he’s dissecting Draco’s words, looking for another meaning.
“I think you should go. If you wanna talk about this fine, but not now. I’ll owl you after the weekend,” Harry says, his voice low and angry.
It’s starting to snow, light fluffy flakes falling from the cloudy sky, already beginning to cover the stoop where Malfoy and Scorpius stand, wrapped in heavy coats and scarves.
you. I see what you’re trying to do right now and I’m not gonna let you, Draco,” Potter steps forward again as Draco’s brain shorts out at the sound of his name leaving Potter’s lips.
Once Malfoy’s clothes are gone, Harry wiggles out of his own, tosses his glasses carelessly to the side, and then he pushes Malfoy backwards. The vision he makes, spread out on Harry’s bed, naked and panting and hard. It’s beautiful. Always so, so beautiful.
Malfoy smiles, his straight white teeth glowing brightly as he jumps down from the sofa, stumbling a little. He plops heavily back down onto the arm of Harry’s chair, throwing an arm around Harry’s shoulders and leaning in close, his blonde hair tickling Harry’s temple.
The moment hangs suspended outside of time, the two of them standing frozen just inches apart. All the sounds of the day—the boys laughing, the wind blowing through the trees—fade to background noise, and Draco worries that Potter will be able to hear his heart beating wildly, like a trapped animal rattling the bars of its cage, threatening to break free.
“So this is your weekend with the children then?” Malfoy asks, dragging Harry out of his thoughts and back to the present.
“I hated it,” he admits after a moment, “Being an Auror I mean. I was tired of fighting. I absolutely loathed all the paperwork and politics and other nonsense that came along with the job. Honestly, I kept on with it longer than I should have but that’s what people expected of me,” Harry finishes with a shrug.
smile. It’s like sunshine, brightening everything it touches and bringing all the colors in the world into sharp focus. And Harry is the one responsible, he’s the one who put it there. A strong surge of satisfaction washes over him at the thought.
“I’m aware,” Draco mutters. He’s keeping his distance, standing as far away from Harry as he can, “Was there a point to this or did you just call me over here to insult me?”
“And why not now? Merlin,” Draco says completely exasperated, “It’s just like you to have to have things done on your terms,” Draco curls his lip, his patience finally snapping, “I do have a life waiting for me back in New York you know, a boyfriend too. One who is quite eager for me to get home. So no, I do not have time for your games. Sign the fucking papers and -“
Harry shrugs, grabbing the tea towel from Draco’s hands to twist it in his own. “Because I like spending time with you.” Harry steps closer and presses a kiss to his forehead. “I know you miss your parents, but you still have family here, Draco. And I think they’d really like to meet you.”
Harry can hear the boys, already awake, the sound of chattering voices and cartoons reaching his ears as he descends the stairs. He pokes his head into the living room and sure enough, the three of them are sprawled on top of a mound of blankets, their eyes glued to the telly.
The Burrow is overpacked today, filled to the brim with the people Draco now thinks of as his own. All the Weasleys’ and Potters’, Andromeda and Teddy, even Astoria is there.
The start of the new year, the familiar feeling of a new beginning and everything it represents, is one of Draco’s favorite things.
“You have no idea how much I mean it. You’ve been taking up space in my head since the day you tumbled out of that fireplace and back into my life. Probably a lot longer than that if I’m being honest. What I’m trying to say is—I’m completely fucking mad about you, Draco. I understand if you don’t feel the same way, but I think you do.”
Draco once told Harry that he reminded him of trees; strong and resistant, never wavering under pressure. Deep-rooted. Tall, his long legs making him eye level with Draco. His tan skin rough with blemishes and scars. And those eyes. Merlin. They’re so green, like the color of the leaves in summer.
It’s when he’s about to leave, his hand turning the doorknob, that Potter breaks the silence and calls out.
“We were doing stealth exercises,” Ron nods and makes a go-on gesture, “He managed to trip over me while we were disillusioned and fire off a hex at the same time. Nearly singed my eyebrows off.”
Harry grabs Draco’s hands, threading their fingers together as he pins Draco’s wrists to the bed. “No matter what happens after this,
thoughts locked tightly in a box at the back of his mind. They’re always there but he rarely acknowledges them. It really isn’t his fault that he hadn’t had time for a sexuality crisis when he was younger. He’d been too busy trying not to be murdered and finding Horcrux’s and fighting a war he shouldn’t have been fighting. But he’s a twenty-eight year old father of two, now probably isn’t the time for one either.
Harry wraps the pink paper around his wrist, securing it snuggly, his fingers brushing the inside of Draco’s forearm. The gentle touch causes his pulse to quicken.
He’s standing by the unlit fireplace deep in discussion with Astoria, so Harry hangs back, walking over to the small table where Scorp is sitting surrounded by crayons.
Harry lets out a small huff of laughter, feeling relieved and terrified all at once. Draco is coming and everything will be fine.
of things that belong to him. Growing up he never had anything of his own, even his clothes were someone else’s. So as he got older, and started to accumulate things that were his and his alone, he guarded them carefully. Treasured them.
Harry turns and watches dumbstruck as Malfoy lifts a hand and pushes the hair back from his forehead, his cheeks going slightly pink as he straightens his clothes.
Harry likes his prickliness and his snarky mouth. He likes how Malfoy pulls his hair up on top of his head, and how a few stubborn pieces always escape the elastic band and fall softly around his face. He likes the way Malfoy’s eyes are a perfect mix of blue and grey, and how if you look closely enough, you can see the pigments of other colors surrounding his pupil. He likes the way Malfoy gets confused when faced with Muggle customs or pop culture references, and then pretends he doesn’t.
Harry sits beside him, resting a hand on his knee to stop its bouncing. Andromeda pours them all tea, already knowing how Harry takes his and adding sugar to Draco’s at his request. She’s being friendly enough, much warmer than Draco ever could have expected, but he doesn’t miss the way her eyes keep drifting back to him.
Maybe Harry should have been paying more attention. Maybe he should have showed some simple manners and stepped away from the fireplace after exiting. Maybe he should have just stayed in bed.
“Pull that disappearing act again and I’ll punch right in your pointy face,” Ron murmurs before finally releasing him.
The adrenaline that’s still pumping through Draco’s body is intoxicating and he can’t wait to get Harry home and on a flat surface. He’s very close to just jumping him where they sit.
“They should be here soon, Scorp,” Draco answers with a smile. He carefully places the picture inside the book that rests on his lap and stands, “Come on, we’ll go find a snack while we wait.”
As Draco squeezes his way through the throngs of people, Harry’s laughter reaches his ears. It’s like a ripple, radiating out, soft at first but then it becomes a great wave of sound. It’s the kind of laugh that makes you want to laugh as well. Nose scrunched, eyes crinkling type of laugh. It’s a sound Draco never grows tired of hearing.
Potter isn’t careful or gentle as he rubs at Draco’s entrance, two fingers pushing in roughly and crooking upwards to rub at his prostate. Draco fucks down with a groan, burying Potter’s fingers in deep.
“Blaise has been owling me since New Years, insisting I stop by,” Harry explains with a shrug and a smile.
By the time the movie ends, a smile seems to be permanently fixed on Malfoy’s face and the kids are piled together on the floor, half asleep.
But Draco already knows that he’s going to give in. If he’s learned anything over the last few months, it’s that he can’t say no to Harry.
“I didn’t quite catch that mumbles,” Remus says with a laugh, causing Harry to look up and return his smile, “One more time. You..?”
It could be done faster with magic but Harry doesn’t want to pass up the opportunity to get his hands all over Malfoy’s body. To let his fingers trail over the lean muscles and grab at the perfect curve of his arse. He wants to feel all of that pale, smooth skin and pinch at the hardened nubs of Malfoy’s nipples.
And that’s when Harry loses it, delighted laughter bursts out of his mouth, causing him to double over and clutch his side.
Draco gasps on a particularly hard thrust, his eyes rolling back and he wraps his legs around Harry’s waist tightly, pulling him down into a breathtaking kiss.
Of course Draco knows Potter used to watch him. The man practically stalked him for the entirety of sixth year. He just didn’t realize that Potter would remember these little meaningless things about him a decade later. Draco decides the fact that he remembers a lot of tiny details about Potter also, is entirely irrelevant.
How didn’t he know that his son was friends with Malfoy’s son? Hell, he hadn’t even known Malfoy had a son or that he apparently attended this school.
Draco’s eyes drift to the scars on Harry’s side. His fingers tighten on Harry’s hips as he places kiss after soft kiss against the marred skin. Harry stands still and lets Draco cover as much of the scars as he can reach before roughly pulling him to his feet and crashing their mouths together.
Draco doesn’t acknowledge that he’s heard Harry’s request, doesn’t stop, his movements not faltering at all. And then suddenly, a slick finger is sliding in alongside his tongue.
“Well, then you better snap your all powerful fingers and cast a cleaning charm,” Draco snarks back even as his hands start petting gently through Harry’s hair.
“What did you expect? This thing we have,” Draco says, motioning in between them before sighing heavily, “It was never meant to last.”
“You mean how she chose her own happiness over the bigoted beliefs of her family?” Draco said, cutting her off, “That’s bullshit. Did the war teach you nothing?”
“Because I bought the tickets that let us ride all the rides as many times as we want. You have to wear this wrist band,” Harry answers, excitement glowing in his green eyes.
“It’s Draco. He showed up at my door this afternoon,” Harry says in a rush, keeping his eyes fixed on a spot below the frame, “He wants me to sign the divorce papers.”
“My schedule doesn’t allow me to get him here for regular drop off time,” Malfoy continues when Harry doesn't respond. Malfoy shifts nervously and tugs the sleeves of his blue sweater down over his fingertips, “That’s probably why we haven’t run into each other before.”
Harry laughs, god Malfoy is adorable. Harry shakes the thought away, certain he shouldn’t be thinking such things and also sure Malfoy would hex him if Harry ever dared to describe him as adorable.
“Oh. Yeah I uh. Looks like we’ll all be eating leftovers for a month,” Harry replies with a nervous laugh.
He washes and rinses his hair, ignoring his cock, hanging half hard between his legs. But the more he resists, the stronger the need becomes. He only feels slightly guilty as he wraps a hand around himself and starts to stroke, images of tanned skin and green eyes filling his mind. It isn’t long before the fantasy comes to life around him.
“You too,” Draco says, letting Teddy down when he squirms, “Sorry I wasn’t able to stop by last week.”
When Draco comes, Harry’s entire body shudders at the feeling of Draco tightening around him, and he follows him over the edge, his orgasm crashing through him, almost violent in its intensity.
It’s not long before Draco feels his balls tighten, his orgasm building, sending tingles up his spine. His cock is leaking a steady stream between their stomachs and the little bit of friction he’s getting is slowly driving him insane.
He slicks his finger, hesitating only slightly before he rubs it against Draco’s tight entrance, feeling the muscle flutter beneath it. Slowly, he pushes inside, a devastated sound leaving his mouth when he feels how hot and velvet soft Draco is. It’s nothing like he’s ever experienced before, the feeling of Draco’s body gripping him so tightly leaving him lightheaded and dizzy with want.
He looks to be about sixteen and Harry supposes he’s probably doing his back to school shopping for Hogwarts. He doesn’t look the type to start trouble, but Harry’s hand goes to his wand anyway, out of habit.
“So, Harry tells me your going to be a curse breaker?” she asks after the silence starts to grow awkward.
"Thank you," Draco says. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees George dipping Harry low to the ground, both of them laughing unreservedly. As if feeling Draco’s eyes on him, Harry looks over and straightens up.
Also I went ahead and set the rating and tags for what I have written so far. Explicit content will start around chapter 6.
Outside the storm continues and the sound of rain hitting the windows finally lulls Draco back to sleep.
“I want a bath,” Draco answers, stretching and looking at Harry with a grin, “Not sure if I can stay vertical long enough for a shower.”
,” Harry says fiercely, his thumb caressing Draco’s cheekbone, catching the tears that have started to fall.
But Harry catches his wrists, pinning them against the bed, trapping him there. “It does matter,” he says, face serious. Then his mouth is on Draco’s, and everything else falls away until it’s just warm skin and desperate kisses.
When he sinks into the hot water, Harry lets out a content sigh. Draco climbs in, sitting in front of Harry and leaning back against his chest. Harry brings his arms up and wraps them around Draco, nuzzling his face into soft blonde hair.
Draco goes straight down to the kitchen, shooing Fipsy, their most devoted house elf, away and starts his and Scorpius’ breakfast. Draco isn’t the most experienced cook, but he can handle a simple breakfast of eggs and toast.
“Draco,” Harry says calmly, taking another cautious step closer. They’re only a few feet apart now. Close enough that Harry could reach out and touch, but he won’t. Not yet, “Just listen, please. I have to tell you something and I want to make sure you understand. And then I’ll leave, if that’s what you really want.”
Maybe it’s the alcohol. Maybe it’s being back here at the Burrow after so long. Or maybe it’s because Harry’s nervous energy has always been oddly endearing to him. Whatever the reason, Draco finds himself stepping closer to Harry and extending a hand.
This isn’t the common room late at night or a supply closet in-between classes. No one will catch them here. They’re in an unused part of the castle, the door locked. The implications of that; that Potter can torture him, for as long as he wants and with no mercy, makes Draco moan around his cock.
The Leaky Cauldron has changed a good bit over the last year. The once dark and gloomy pub has been completely transformed—and Harry has to admit that Hannah has done a good job with the place. It’s now brightly lit and welcoming, always filled with loud, happy voices, and the smell of delicious food cooking hangs pleasantly in the air.
A second later Draco steps out, dusting himself off as he glances around at the mess left behind from Harry’s outburst, but he doesn’t comment. “Well, what is it, Potter?”
“I didn’t mean it in a bad way,” Malfoy replies. Harry glances up at him then and raises an eyebrow, “Alright fine. Maybe I did. I apologize.”
They both moan at the feeling and Draco starts up a fast pace, bouncing in Potter’s lap. Potter leans forward, mouthing at his neck, sucking bruises there. He seems intent to mark Draco up tonight, more so than he usually is. Potter’s lips slide across his sweat-slick skin, teeth nipping harshly before his tongue darts out to soothe.
He’s so confident, looking absolutely invested in what he’s saying. His green eyes so earnest. And having all of Potter’s attention focused on him like that makes Draco feel lighter than he has in years. He soaks in the feeling, cherishes it, until he realizes Potter is waiting for an explanation. What’s there to say other than the truth?
Looking into Harry’s eyes, bottle-green and beautiful, a few tears clinging to his long, dark lashes, Draco knows he would stand between this man and the end of the world. And if that’s not love, Draco doesn’t know what is. He loves Harry with every fiber of his being, loves him so much that the words seem inadequate. But he says them anyway. He’ll keep saying them, everyday for the rest of his life if Harry allows it.
Harry just shakes his head and Ron seems to understand that the conversation is over for now. They both stand and head back inside soon after that. Ron pulls him into a crushing hug before letting Harry walk off back to the guest room.
Once they’re outside in the chilly night air, Harry’s head clears a little. He walks further down the shadowed side-alley, the click of Draco’s expensive shoes following a step behind.
He has no idea what to expect from Hermione. The reply to his owl had been short and to the point. Luckily, he doesn’t have to wait long to find out.
Harry sets the plates down so he has a hand free to run through his hair. “A couple days ago.” Draco raises an eyebrow. “I’ve maybe been sneaking into the Harpies stadium to fly and--”
“As much as I say otherwise, it’s not easy for me either,” Malfoy admits, a small smile tilting his lips, “The fact that I’m married to a woman is proof enough of that.”
“Shit,” Harry mumbles under his breath as he pulls Draco tighter against his chest and yanks the duvet up over them, “Come in Hermione, we’re as decent as we’re gonna be.”
“No. I don’t know,” Draco says, already knowing that it’s a lie. He does know and he is scared. He’s terrified, “Alright fine, yes I’m scared. He’s Harry Potter. He’s good and kind and so fucking earnest, and I’m just me. There’s no way he’d ever want me like that. And even if he did, I’d just fuck it up.”
Draco makes a strangled noise and comes, and Harry feels it, feels Draco’s cock pulse, feels the hot splash inside him. He tries to commit every single sensation to memory. The heat, the slickness, the punched out noises Draco makes and the perfect curve of his back as he arches up off the bed.
Draco’s not sure he deserves kindness of this level, feels like maybe he doesn’t really belong here. But then he looks up and catches sight of Blaise standing by the bar, and his nerves settle some. Astoria is around somewhere as well and Draco’s comforted by the fact that he has some of his own people here too, silently supporting him.
After Scorpius is fed, his hair brushed, and has been wrestled into his school uniform, they step into the Floo, closer to being on time than they usually are.
I wrote this chapter in fits and starts, and at times it had me seriously close to pulling my hair out. I really hope it came together okay and you guys like it! I'm going to try and post the final chapter later today <3
Draco’s eyes slam closed on a particularly hard thrust but he can hear Harry’s rough, gasping breaths and only has enough presence of mind left to demand
Then he can only whimper at the sharp, sweet burn as Potter pushes inside. It’s one fluid movement and it knocks the breath right from Draco’s lungs, leaving him gasping for air.
The conversation flows easily between Harry and Andromeda, and Draco is content to sit back and listen. But then Andromeda’s wand buzzes against the table and Harry stands before Draco can protest. “I’ll get him.” Harry grins and disappears up the stairs, leaving Draco alone with his Aunt.
Harry knows that Malfoy and Astoria’s marriage is by no means traditional, still he’s always a little caught off guard at the ease with which Malfoy talks about his wife seeing other men. Harry wonders what kind of arrangement they have.
“Do what? What are you talking about, Draco, what’s wrong?” Narcissa is standing now, the seating chart abandoned to the mess on the table.
They stay there, not moving for several minutes as they both slowly come back down. Their breathing slows, syncs up, and then Draco tips his head back, and their gazes lock. Harry watches, dread filling him, as the hazy fog clears quickly from Draco’s eyes.
Eventually they break apart. Harry rests his forehead against Draco’s as they sit quietly, sharing shuddering breaths. After a few moments, Harry places a soft kiss to Draco’s lips and climbs off his lap, immediately missing the smell of his skin. Harry would prefer to not move at all, to stay right there in Draco’s lap for the rest of his life, but he knows they need to talk before this goes any further.
An emotion Draco can’t quite put a name to starts to build in his chest. Harry hasn’t moved on. He hasn’t given up on Draco.
“Why would you marry someone you weren’t attracted to?” Harry snarks, because if he’s an idiot then so is Malfoy.
Draco waits, counting the seconds in his head. When he gets to 200 he stands and walks casually in the direction Harry went.
“Uh sorry, lost track of time,” Harry says, offering Malfoy the wine he has tucked in the crook of his elbow, “I brought you wine though.”
An hour later, Harry and Draco step out of the Floo and into the entrance hall of the Manor. Draco tenses beside him and the earlier good mood from their shared shower, seems to evaporate. Harry knows that Draco strongly dislikes being in this house. He’s seen first hand how Draco’s nightmares will return, how for days after a visit here he looks haunted and exhausted, a shell of the person he became after the war.
“Harry,” Draco replies softly, the name rolling off his tongue easily, and then he’s leaning forward and they’re kissing again.
Harry has only recently been put in charge of morning drop offs and play dates and all other child related activities. He’s still figuring out what works best for both him and the boys. And while he and Ginny are pretty firm on the whole co-parenting thing, she’s been traveling a lot for her new job with Quidditch Weekly, and more and more has been added to Harry’s list of responsibilities. Harry doesn’t mind though, being a full time dad is a vast improvement over sitting in the DMLE shuffling paperwork everyday.
“Christ, Draco,” Harry mumbles, pulling Draco to his feet, both of them stumbling before they manage to kick their pants away. They kiss then, soft and languid, tongues brushing lightly. Harry doesn’t know what he would have done if he’d lost this. “I don’t wanna stop kissing you.”
“It appears our sons get along well, which if you don’t mind me saying, is utterly amusing,” Malfoy’s lips twitch up at the corners as he speaks and finally break into a genuine smile.
“Yes, well. I’m sure things are much more exciting in New York,” Hermione says and then simply sips her tea, waiting for Draco to respond.
Everyone always goes on about Harry’s eyes. Yes, he has his mother’s eyes and yes, they are very green but Harry has never understood what’s so fascinating about them.
Trying to distract himself from the rush of emotion that Harry’s possessive behavior brought on, Draco looks once more around the remodeled kitchen. He really wants to snoop around the rest of the house and see what else has been changed in his absence. He wonders if Harry still has any pictures of them together, if he kept any of the things Draco left behind in his haste to leave, or if every reminder of their relationship is gone. He isn’t sure which would be worse.
It’s surreal. Harry has never seen this laid back version of Malfoy before and he has no idea how to feel about it.
Potter pockets his wand and presses against him harder. He grabs for Draco’s hands, pinning them above his head, the delicate bones of Draco’s wrists protesting against the vice-like grip.
“Excuse me, what?!” Draco breaths out with a laugh, completely baffled because he and Potter are absolutely not dating. Not even close.
“So…I’m an idiot and I’m sorry,” Draco finally says, the smile clear in his voice. He lifts Harry’s hand and presses a kiss to his palm, “Now you say, I know Malfoy. I forgive you.”
They’ve been taking things slowly though, enjoying intense make out sessions that more often than not end in frantic hand jobs, neither of them angling for more. Both satisfied with this level of physical closeness, and content in knowing they have all the time in the world to learn each other at their own pace.
“You can grab us seats and I’ll order,” Potter says, stepping up to take his place in the short line, “What do you want?”
Malfoy looks good tonight, Harry thinks, dressed in faded jeans and a blue jumper. Then again, Harry always thinks Malfoy looks good, whether he’s wearing Wizard robes or Muggle designer clothes or even that one time Harry showed up at the Manor earlier than usual and caught Malfoy still in his pajamas. But this is his favorite, when Malfoy looks casual, comfortable,
Narcissa is watching the scene unfold with narrowed eyes. She glances at Harry, giving him a small, sympathetic smile which he tries his best to return, before she focuses her attention back on her son.
“Well you can have them all. I’m going to go and start breakfast,” Harry replies, untangling himself from the fluffy duvet and tucking it securely around Draco’s half asleep form, “Any requests?”
“I’m trying,” Harry finally says, “I’m trying to live for myself, trying to not care what other people think but it’s never been easy for me. I don’t think it ever will be.”
Harry chases and catches and chases some more. Finally, embarrassingly out of breath, Harry waves James off telling him it’s time for a break, and makes his way back across the park towards Malfoy.
“What?” Draco chokes out. He will have to murder Potter if he speaks a word of any of this to anyone.
“Harry,” Hermione says with a disapproving frown, hooking her arm through his and slowing his stomping pace, “You know that getting upset like this is exactly what she wants, so just try to calm down. This will all blow over soon enough.”
Harry would have never imagined that he could have such a good time in the company of Slytherin’s but he is. He feels warm and comfortable, happy to sit back and watch the evening unfold.
“Hermione’s plotting something,” Harry whispers in his ear, startling him. Draco follows his gaze and sure enough, there’s Hermione and Astoria huddled together at the end of the table deep in discussion. They both keep cutting quick glances at Harry, and Draco worries—not for the first time tonight—that introducing them was a bad idea.
“Is everything alright?” Draco questions, concerned by the look of stress on Astoria’s usually carefree face.
Although, it wasn’t so much that Draco was oblivious to the fact that he was arse over tit for Harry Potter. No, he knew that on some level subconsciously for awhile now. Admitting it to himself, let alone Harry or anyone else, was what Draco struggled with. He was terrified to voice his emotions, still unconvinced that someone like Harry Potter could want him.
The next morning finds Draco sleep deprived and cranky. After returning to bed he slept fitfully, tossing and turning, his dreams featuring vivid green eyes and messy dark hair.
“What do you propose we do about it then?” Draco retorts, trying to seem unaffected and failing miserably.
Draco Malfoy has no business being in Harry Potter’s house, he has no right to take comfort from Potter. He doesn’t deserve it. People like him aren’t meant to feel this way. His father is right, Draco will never belong in Potter’s arms, and the realization has his muscles finally unlocking. Draco jerks back, words already tumbling out of his mouth.
“Nothing. I just—sometimes I wish I’d have figured it out sooner. All those years when I didn’t know what was missing, and it was you. How didn’t we see it?” Harry asks, looking into Draco’s eyes and finding his own feelings reflected back at him.
“Shh it’s okay,” Harry soothes. He doesn’t know what to say to make this easier for Draco and a part of himself, a part he hates, doesn’t want to make it any easier for him, “Everything’s gonna be alright, just breathe,” Draco takes in a gulp of air, his breath shuddering out against Harry’s neck, “And I promise to be on my best behavior. I won’t punch him in the face or anything. Swear,” Harry’s words have the intended effect, drawing a snort of laughter out of Draco.
He lets his eyes take in every line and dip of Draco’s body. The scars on his chest, the faded mark on his arm. It’s proof of their past, but more importantly, it’s proof of Draco’s resilience. He might be a little scarred, a little broken, but he’s here.
“A few months after you left,” Harry says quietly, grabbing Draco’s hand, rubbing a thumb over his knuckles, “C’mon.”
The Floo powder is gritty between his fingers, the feeling of it rubbing roughly against his skin grounds him to the moment.
“Good morning,” Draco manages to say before Harry is kissing him hard. Draco internally cringes thinking of how his mouth must taste but Harry doesn’t seem to mind. His tongue slides against Draco’s, licking hotly into his mouth over and over again.
“Yes, yes I know. But at least let me put my dick away before you start pointing out what an idiot I am,” Draco snarks making Harry laugh, and god has Draco missed hearing that sound. He really is an idiot.
Harry loves his boys more than anything. James with his mischievous grin and exuberant personality, making what Harry thinks is the perfect blend of his namesakes. Al with his chubby fingers and his love of books and the way he always seems to be missing a sock.
Harry runs a shaking hand through his hair, yanking a little when his fingers get caught on the tangles. He chances a glance up at Remus and finds his face is kind with compassion. He looks so much like he did when he was alive that it makes Harry’s chest ache. Sometimes Harry forgets that he’s talking to a portrait and not actually a real person.
The following evening, Draco Apparates to the end of the dirt lane that leads to the Burrow. His stomach is in knots but he arranges his face into a cool mask of indifference and starts to make his way towards the house.
Still, it feels extra important that Harry makes today special. He wants to drive all the worry and anxious thoughts out of Draco’s head.
“One of what people?” Harry asks with a sigh. He selects a pepper and begins to chop, sliding another towards Malfoy along with a knife, “There, give it a try.”
Potter doesn’t ask what’s wrong. He doesn’t tell Draco that everything will be okay, doesn’t bother with meaningless sentiments. He just hugs back tighter and whispers the same words over and over again.
“Lie back,” Potter instructs, and Draco notices the shiny substance that suddenly coats his fingers. Wandless lubrication spell. Draco hates how hot he finds that, “Now.”
Emotions run high on the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, which Draco expected, but they muddle through and finally talk about some of the things they’ve avoided for so long. It’s easier than Draco imagined and he thinks that’s because Harry has a way of making all the heavy things seem lighter.
too. I really, really want too, Draco. But you could, um. Keep pulling on my hair if you’d like,” he says with a grin before he busies his mouth again and slowly takes Draco apart.
His father isn’t that old, not by Wizarding standards anyway. But Draco can’t get over how much the time spent inside these walls has aged him. The strong, confident father of his early childhood nothing but a ghost of a memory now.
Draco cries out as Potter bobs back up, licking at the precome beaded at the tip, before swallowing him down again and again.
“It’s chocolate.” Harry draws the words out as if he’s explaining this to an incompetent three year old.
“Thanks,” Harry says with a grateful smile. It’s a running tradition that Hermione brings Harry chocolate frogs on Valentine’s Day. Harry probably should have expected it.
“No need to hold back. I want to hear you,” Draco says, his grin turning to a smirk when a loud moan escapes Harry’s open mouth, “There’s been permanent silencing charms on my bedroom since you started sleeping over.”
Draco shakes his head and against his better judgement scratches out an affirmative reply, smiling as he adds his own post script. He ties the note to Orions leg, stroking the birds head once more, before opening the window and watching the owl fly away.
Harry, there in the shower with him, standing flush against his back, and it’s his hand—bigger and rougher than Draco’s own—that’s pulls at his cock now. Harry’s mouth moves across the back of Draco’s neck, pressing soft kisses and gentle nips of teeth there, while his other hand drifts down to the cleft of Draco’s arse. His fingers rub teasingly, before two are shoved inside without warning. Draco whines quietly, the hand speeds up. Then he hears those words again, whispered in Harry’s hoarse voice--
“Kreacher,” Harry calls and the elderly elf pops into the room a moment later, his blue pillowcase hanging off one of his bony shoulders.
He doesn’t know that Potter sends a quiet plea out into the universe, offering to do whatever it takes, to make Draco his.
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t hex you, Malfoy,” Potter growls through gritted teeth. This could be about what Draco said in the Great Hall at dinner, or it could be the Trip Jinx he sent Potter’s way as they were leaving Charms earlier that afternoon.
Draco’s feet touch down on the uneven ground outside of Azkaban. The sea is raging around the small island, waves crashing against the rocks and spraying foul smelling water up around him.
Harry’s trusting him not to go too far, too fast. The clothes should probably stay, and Draco should probably slow down. He should stop grinding their hips together like this. Should stop licking into Harry’s mouth, should stop running his hands through Harry’s hair, stop tugging at it roughly.
Harry’s brain supplies because somehow that’s shocking. Harry expected Malfoy’s skin to be cold, matching the personality and demeanor he usually projects. But those long, elegant fingers are warm and Harry is hit with the sudden urge to lace their fingers together and hold on tight.
Harry turns over again, kicking the blanket off and getting to his feet. He pulls his jeans on, grabbing his jacket from the chair in the corner and slipping it on. Then he makes his way silently through the house and out the front door.
The older that Harry gets, the more he seems to enjoy working in the kitchen, experimenting with new dishes and adding his own twists to old favorites. Over the last few years, Harry’s done a lot of cooking. No longer having a house elf makes it a necessity, if he wants to eat something other than takeaway that is.
Harry’s pretty sure that he and Malfoy are friends now or at least on their way to it. For some reason, that thought causes something in his chest to squirm in delight.
“How in the fuck am I supposed to do that?” Harry squeaks out, his voice raising in pitch. This sounds like a sure fire-way to die of embarrassment, while simultaneously   being tossed out on his arse.
Harry’s eyes fill with tears once more and he squeezes them shut. “Yeah,” he says roughly, “He ended it, said he has a ‘responsibility’ or some bollocks. Said he doesn’t have a choice.”
The pleasure fades fast though, being replaced with a hollowness that scares him. He scrubs quickly, efficiently, and gets out of the shower. A shiver rolls down his spine as the cool air of the bathroom hits his wet skin.
Harry nods, “Yeah, me too,” he sips his frappuccino, savoring the sweet caramel taste, “So, any big plans tonight?”
He does pull back, the reason being more that he needs to drag some air into his lungs, and less that he has any intention of stopping or slowing down.
They continue like that, Potter feeding him small bites as he kneels on the floor. His knees are starting to protest when Potter finally lays the fork down. He scoots his chair back a bit and tells Draco to stand up.
As the clock on the wall loudly ticks the minutes away, Harry tries to settle his nerves. He’s half afraid he’s just going to word vomit all the feelings he’s been holding back right onto Draco as soon as he sees him.
Astoria thanks him and then disappears back out the door, the scent of her perfume lingering behind. Draco cleans up and then makes his way back inside, happy to find that it’s warmed up some.
Harry continues to smile, even as he watches Albus drag a finger through the extra syrup on his plate, lift it to his mouth and grin around the sugary sweetness. His smile vanishes a moment later though, when Al promptly shoves his slobbery finger into his left nostril.
Malfoy always looks so put together, his clothes crisp and wrinkle free. His hair, even when pulled up in a messy knot, still looks styled to perfection. His sharp jaw never has even the hint of stubble and his nails are manicured and clean.
Shopping for school uniforms with three bored boys is turning out to be more complicated that Harry ever could have imagined.
That answer is unexpected, and so is the sting of disappointment Draco feels in his chest. There’s a part of him, small though it may be, that likes Potter’s stupid little gestures. He pushes it away though, because this is good. It means this thing between them can continue and stay uncomplicated. But—
These days Draco just likes to watch people and make up little stories about them in his head. Giving each of them their own set of accomplishments and failures. It makes his own problems seem insignificant.
But interactions with Malfoy have always made him feel this way; jittery with adrenaline pumping through his veins. That’s just par for the course with them and has been, since they were eleven.
Orion hoots softly before flying over to the table and offering his leg. Harry unties the letter and opens it with shaking hands.
They stumble their way across the room, not able to keep their mouths or hands off one another. At some point, Draco rips Harry’s shirt off, throwing it over his shoulder not caring where it lands, just needing to feel Harry’s skin against his own. His glasses follow shortly after, tossed without care to the floor.
that wants to roll off his tongue. He drops any pretense of having a normal conversation with his father and just sits there silently instead.
Draco can admit that he wants Potter’s attention, he always has. But he knows this is a bad idea. Coffee with the Savior isn’t part of his routine and it’s ridiculous to encourage whatever this is between them. He’ll decline the invitation, that’s the right thing to do.
“So tell me what happened. Did the two of you talk about everything?” Remus asks, the soft timber of his voice soothing Harry’s nerves.
He quickly yanks Harry’s jeans and pants down, stopping to unlace his boots and effectively strip him from the waist down.
Harry just shrugs and lets the subject go. He adds the peppers—a sweet red and jalapeño—the garlic and a variety of spices to the pot giving it a thorough stir. The smells of the spicy mixture are already invading the kitchen, making Harry’s stomach rumble in anticipation.
“Get up on your knees. Hands against the wall,” Harry demands. A breath hisses out from between his teeth as he gets himself slick, and then he’s shuffling forward and lining up.
Harry vaguely registers the sound of plates being knocked to the floor, their forgotten dinner spilling and probably staining the carpet. But Harry can’t find it in himself to care much, with Draco hovering above him, trailing kisses down the side of his throat.
There’s been a lot of changes to the prison since the end of the war but it’s still an unpleasant place to visit. Draco wouldn’t be here at all if it wasn’t for his mother. She insists that he visit his father at least twice a year, using guilt to motivate Draco to follow through.
“It could though,” Harry says, with so much conviction, grabbing Draco’s hand and squeezing it hard, “I—fuck, Draco, you mean so fucking much to me. Just please. Don’t do this.”
Astoria reaches over and takes his hand, squeezing it hard, “You’re his chance at happiness Harry. And he deserves it, whether he thinks so or not.”
As three o’clock approaches, Draco’s nerves worsen. Ron and Hermione are both at work so Draco is left alone to worry in silence. He paces back and forth across the spare bedroom he’s been occupying, mumbling to himself as he tries to work out what he’ll say to Harry, while also mentally preparing himself for rejection.
Harry doesn’t remember walking into the living room or opening the floo connection, but suddenly he’s there, kneeling in front of the fireplace. “Malfoy!” he yells into the flames. He hears some shuffling from the other side and then Draco’s face pops into view.
“Let’s not chance finding out,” Harry says abruptly, and Draco raises an eyebrow at him in question. The mischief in Harry’s eyes means trouble, “We could sneak out of here. Go back home and get naked,” his tongue darts out to lick at his lip, just letting the suggestion hang between them, causing Draco’s mind to run wild with all sorts of inappropriate thoughts.
This had been his home for four years, his sanctuary after the war. After everything, it still feels more like home than the Manor ever did. Draco swallows around the lump of emotion that seems to be lodged in his throat and arranges his face into a blank expression. He raises an only slightly shaking hand and knocks loudly against the door.
His heart thumps wildly behind his ribs as he watches Kade walk away. The reality of everything that’s happened over the last week almost crushing him. His entire life has been turned upside down. But as Harry and his mother walk back into view on the garden path, Draco thinks that everything will be okay.
But Draco can’t think about that right now because his father is looking at him with disgust on his face, lips twisted and ears turning red.
you. But this pain is different from anything he’s ever experienced before. Heartache, he’s learning, is a one of a kind thing. And it’s something he knows he’ll never completely heal from.
The candles are casting flickering shadows across Draco’s face, lighting up his sharp features and making his blonde hair glow white. He looks angelic, like something not from this Earth.
Albus and Scorpius are playing on the see-saw that resembles a hippogriff, obviously tired of James endless game of tag, so Harry gives Malfoy an amused smile and takes off in pursuit of his son.
It was almost dark by the time he made it back to his flat, and he realised he hadn’t eaten all day. He searched the cupboards, firmly ignoring the mess from earlier and the cause of it. None of the food he had looked particularly appetizing, but he managed to choke down a sandwich and a glass of cold water.
“So, tell me how you’re really doing,” Andromeda asks, walking back into the kitchen. Draco admires the way she flicks her wand with easy precision, setting the dishes to wash in the sink.
“Please, please, fuck. Potter, please,” Draco starts to babble incoherently at some point and finally,
“It’s really beautiful Kade but surely we don’t have time for this,” Draco says as he starts to turn away from the mesmerizing view in front of him, “Aaron will be waiting and -“
“Kade, I think I need to go alone,” Kade starts to object but Draco puts a hand up to silence him, “Hear me out, please. You know this is complicated. My mother is complicated. I just don’t feel right showing up and springing this on her. It’s been a long time and I left a lot of things…unfinished. I think I need to go back by myself. Just give me a few days to go and talk to everyone, then you and I can make a trip back together. Alright?” Draco silently prays to whatever deity that might be listening for Kade to give in without too much of a fight.
“Honestly, not much after that. I just left him there,” Harry meets Remus’ eyes and decides he doesn’t care how desperate his next words sound, “What should I do? Please, just tell me what to do.”
Draco mutters to himself when there’s no answer. He came to yell at Potter and the insufferable git isn’t even here.
“Fine. Let’s get up and shower. But please Draco, only a few days. I want you back with me as soon as possible,” Kade pleads, gently running his fingertips over Draco’s cheekbone before placing a soft kiss on his lips.
for him. Most people probably assume he relies on his house elf for everything. But he and Astoria both agree that they want Scorpius to be raised and cared for by them. They share the parenting duties equally, working together as a team, and even though it’s not a marriage built on romantic love, Draco is still grateful to have a partner so well suited to him. He already has more than he deserves, there’s no reason to want for more.
Draco stands gloriously naked before him, his skin flushed, cock fully hard again. Then he drops to his knees and swallows Harry down in one swift move. “Fuck,” Harry gasps, “Ah, fuck Draco, yeah, that’s it.” Draco moans around his cock, making a hot wash of sensation sweep over him.
As unbelievable as it is though, he’s actually having a great time. He’s managed to avoid Harry all evening and he feels strangely content as he sits on the hard ground, enjoying the warmth of the fire and the chatter of voices around him.
Last night wasn’t a dream. Draco’s really here, curled around him, mumbling in his sleep. His lips are pulled into a pout and his hair is sticking up in every direction, and Harry doesn’t think he’s ever seen anything more beautiful.
“Get the fuck over here,” Harry growls, and he has to clench his hands into fists to stop himself from dragging Draco through.
If Malfoy’s warm body tucked close to his own is what Harry has to look forward to, he sure isn’t complaining.
Draco’s eyes fight to close at the feeling of Harry moving inside him but he forces them to stay open, not wanting to miss a single moment of this.
“So the flowers really have the same healing properties as Phoenix tears?” Hermione asks, and Harry tries to pay attention, he really does, but Herbology was never his strongest subject.
He doesn’t say anything right away, just sitting silently and offering a comforting presence at Harry’s side.
“Come here,” Harry says, voice scratchy as his fingers wrap around Draco’s hips and drag him forward.
And the worse part is, this isn’t just affecting him. Draco and Scorpius have become fixtures in his and the boys lives. If he has to look at Albus’ sad puppy dog face one more time as he asks why Scorpius can’t come over to play, Harry’s going to scream. And the thought that this is somehow his fault, that Harry’s responsible for messing this up—it’s too much.
“Of course it was real. Kade I…I never meant for you to find out like this, I was going to tell you everything the minute I got back to New York, I swear. But then…” Draco’s eyes sting but he doesn’t doubt his decision. He knows he belongs here.
“Do you want me stop?” Draco asks, barely pulling away. The warm air blowing across the spit-slick flesh makes Harry whimper and sends a flash of heat up his spine.
Harry sees fire flash in Draco’s eyes and then he’s pulling almost all the way out before thrusting back in hard. Harry grabs for any part of Draco he can reach and pulls him down into a messy kiss.
“No, I suppose not. Although I was hoping it went well. You two are long over due for a conversation,” Harry snorts and Hermione glares at him, “This mess needs sorted Harry and you know it.”
“Ready to go?” Kade asks, smirking at Draco’s obvious ogling. It doesn’t bother Draco in the slightest that he’s been caught admiring his boyfriend. He lets his eyes caress the long lines of Kade’s body, pulling his bottom lip into his mouth the way he knows drives Kade crazy.
After that, the weeks slip away almost without Draco noticing, too caught up in the newness of his relationship with Harry.
“Draco—wait,” Harry gasps out, and Draco stops immediately. Before he can ask, Harry continues, “I’m fine. I just want to see you.”
“Sweet Salazar. Astoria and I have never slept together, Potter, which is what I assume you’re asking. You do realize there are other means of conceiving a child, yes?”
Harry’s thick cock is already hard, wet at the tip, and a pretty dusky pink. Draco’s mouth waters just thinking about feeling the weight of it on his tongue.
When Lucius enters the room a few minutes later, the thought that he looks much the same as he did towards the end of the war hits Draco square in the chest. The stringy hair and hollow look in his eyes betrays his outward air of confidence. The dull brown prisoner robes don’t help.
When they walk up to the restaurant, their hands not clasped but teasingly brushing, pinkies catching, Draco feels a smile stretch across his face.
Draco curls his toes and rolls his hips up, thrusting his cock hard into Harry’s mouth, making him moan around Draco, the sound vibrating through Draco’s entire body.
It doesn’t mean anything, Draco tells himself firmly and is ready an hour later when Kade steps out of the Floo. He looks delectable in the perfectly tailored black trousers and dark green shirt.
But all thoughts of training and irritating co-workers fly right out the window when he sees the long, lean form of Draco Malfoy stepping out of the green flames. Malfoy looks perfectly put together in midnight blue robes, the colour eye-catching against his pale skin.
Any patience Draco might have had evaporates, and he throws the container of cake on the table with a satisfying clang.
“You moved rooms,” Draco says, his eyes drifting from Harry’s to take in the details of the bedroom.
Harry’s eyes meet stormy grey ones, the whisper of something dancing in their depths. Malfoy is like a puzzle Harry is itching to figure out.
“Morning Malfoy. Scorp,” Potter says, first smiling at Draco and then offering a fist bump to Scorpius, which is returned enthusiastically along with an excited ‘Good morning, Harry.’
Draco stops walking and pulls Harry against him, deepening the kiss and slipping his tongue easily into Harry’s warm mouth, giving exactly zero fucks about the show they’re putting on for anyone looking.
“Doing what?” Potter is still sitting there, looking completely unbothered by Draco showing up unannounced to shout at him. Why isn’t he getting mad? He’d usually have Draco pinned against the wall by this point.
“No,” Harry says again, his voice dangerously low this time, “I don’t gotta let you do anything. You’ll come when I say you can.”
The volume of voices in the room rises until it’s so overwhelming, that Draco fears his hearing will be permanently damaged.
Draco’s heart feels like it’s going to beat out of his chest. “I can’t—I don’t get to…” he stammers, his thought trailing off unfinished, but Andromeda hears it anyway.
If that first glass is ill-advised, the second and third are downright asinine. Draco’s pretty certain the glass currently in his hand is his fourth, but he’s too sloshed to know for sure. And he’s definitely far past the point of giving a fuck.
Harry doesn’t release his hold on Draco, instead bringing their arms back and whacking the ball, sending it through the spinning blades of the little windmill and right into the hole on the other side.
He gingerly sits up, his head protesting at the movement. His stomach flips again as he picks up the papers and realizes that they’re the divorce documents. And they’re signed.
Harry lets him down, and before he can say a word, Draco drops to his knees. He pulls roughly at Harry’s jeans, undoing them and shoving them down his legs. Harry can only breathe out a soft
The sight of Potter, standing at the stove, shirtless and wearing only pajama pants is a close second.
A heavy silence falls between them. Draco’s heartbeat is loud in his own ears and he thinks there’s no way that Harry can’t hear it too.
I just want to say that you guys are honestly amazing <3 All the kudos and comments on this story mean so much and have been such a big motivator for me to continue writing--so thank you!! The final chapter is here, full of smut and fluff, and the happy ending I promised. I really hope you enjoy!
There’s only Draco, and the way they move together. Draco thrusts forward into Harry’s hand, then back against his straining cock, where it’s still trapped in his jeans. It’s too much and not enough all at once.
Draco’s lost to the pleasure, tingles are starting to shoot up his spine and there’s no stopping it. All the breath is punched from his lungs, a wounded sound leaving him as his orgasm is roughly pulled from his body.
Draco’s not sure exactly how this thing between them progressed so quickly from a few shags in a broom closet to sleepovers and shared meals. It too closely resembles dating. And Draco is certainly not
Harry trudges down the stairs and into the kitchen. He taps his wand against the half full coffee pot, reheating it, and then fills his mug. He adds flavored creamer and a scoop of sugar, giving it a quick stir before he leans back against the counter. Steam wafts up from his cup, the smell of strong coffee and sweet vanilla causing a happy sigh to escape his lips.
Draco has never minded his situation. He goes out from time to time. Finds a fit bloke in a bar, maybe dances or has a quickie in the loo. It suits his needs. He’s never been interested in something serious.
,” Astoria states, confusing Harry further and apparently unaware of the affect her words are having on him. His heart feels like it might be in serious danger of giving out, “His father—well I’m not completely sure what he did. But Draco came home from visiting him and…” she shrugs, and Harry doesn’t miss the flash of anger in her eyes, “Draco isn’t the easiest person to talk to when he’s hurting. But I can’t just sit by and watch him spiral.”
“Yes. I loved it, if you must know,” Draco leans closer, resting his hand on Harry’s thigh and brushing his mouth against Harry’s ear, “Wait until we get back to yours. I’m gonna show you just how much I liked it.”
He hears the door creak open and he finally looks up, watching as Astoria winds her way around the plants, coming to a halt at his side.
Shaking his head he turns and starts up the stairs out of the kitchen and then out of the house, not looking back.
“Don’t, it’s fine,” Draco says in a surprisingly steady voice as he shakes off the hand on his shoulder, “I need a drink.”
The rate which Malfoy goes from spitting-mad to soft and pliant makes Harry’s head spin. Malfoy’s eyes are already glazed over and blown black, and it’s intoxicating, the way he gives up control. How easily he slides into submission. It never fails to calm the angry buzzing under Harry’s skin and quiet the noise in his head.
As he stares at the ceiling, his breathing still too quick, Harry realizes that of all the places Malfoy’s mouth had touched in his dream, their lips never met. Harry longs, even if it’s only an image his unconscious mind produces, to know what it’s like to kiss Malfoy. To have that mouth against his own. He thinks they would fit together perfectly, just as they do in so many other ways.
“Neville,” Harry answers with a shrug, “Honestly, I don’t know much about it but when I asked him for a plant you would appreciate, this is what he found. Do you like it?” Harry asks, nervously chewing his lip.
Draco rips the paper away, and inside he finds a clear container that holds a large piece of chocolate cake. He can sense Potter’s magic on it and knows that there are probably charms preserving the cake and all of its perfect, chocolate-ly goodness.
Eventually, Harry flops down on the bed and pulls a still pliant Draco into his arms. This is the only time Draco will allow it and Harry’s going to take advantage. He cuddles close, throwing a leg over one of Draco’s, and kisses him once more.
Anyways, that's it...at least for now. I do plan to continue this series at some point, so I hope everyone sticks around to see where this story goes next <3
Harry’s party is a much bigger affair than Draco’s own was—loud and rowdy and honestly a bit overwhelming. But Draco expected nothing less.
Harry does and Malfoy drags his jeans and boxers down slowly. The denim rubs against Harry’s thighs making his cock jerk, the wet tip bouncing against his stomach.
Draco walks through London, enjoying the cool evening air as he makes his way back to the hotel. He’s been out most of the day, first dropping by to see Neville and Hannah, then going to his Aunt Andy’s to visit with her and Teddy. He hadn’t meant to stay so long but Teddy’s excitement at seeing him was infectious. Draco had extracted a promise from Andromeda that she wouldn’t tell his mother he was back yet. He hopes for his sake she keeps her word.
“I mean, and let me be clear, I am pissed the fuck off. But you deserve to be happy,” Kade says with a strained smile. He stands from the table, smoothing down his red shirt. Draco stands too, “I should probably go. You’ll let me know when you’re back in New York? There’s some stuff I’ll need to get from your apartment.”
And Harry did say he would be in touch. It’s been four days, which is a perfectly acceptable amount of time to wait before owling your ex-nemesis to plan a play date for your children. Isn’t it?
“Spread your legs and bring your knees up some,” Draco rasps against his ear, and goose flesh breaks out all over Harry’s body.
Draco doesn’t seem to mind, letting Harry back him up against the wall, meeting Harry’s rough kiss with eager enthusiasm. His mouth is hot and slick and perfect, and Harry lets his hands roam, touching every inch of Draco he can reach.
“But we’ve never let a little rain stop us before,” Draco says cutting him off. They grin at each other and each grab a broom before striding off in the direction of the field behind the Manor, their steps light with contentment.
“Only you, Harry. It’s only ever been you,” Draco says breathlessly, turning his head to look over his shoulder and meet Harry’s heated gaze.
Harry’s leaning against the countertop, his knuckles nearly white from how tightly he’s gripping the edge.
Draco’s teeth dig into his lower lip, holding back a noise of his own. The sight of Harry on his knees—looking up at Draco through his lashes, his eyes dark and full of devotion—is absolutely devastating.
Harry’s teeth pull at Draco’s skin and Draco knows he’ll be covered in marks in the morning. The thought causes his heart to beat wildly in his chest and a moan escapes his throat. Draco rolls his hips against Harry’s, the friction setting his blood on fire. Harry kisses the trail of blond hair leading down from his belly button, stopping suddenly, his lips hovering just inches above Draco’s straining erection. Harry flicks his eyes up and the hungry, pleading look in them nearly makes Draco come untouched.
“Where’s my dad?” Scorpius asks, climbing up on a chair to get a better view of the countertop, “Can I have blueberries on mine?”
He leaves the hotel a few minutes later and walks quickly to the closest Apparation point. He focuses on Grimmuald Place and feels the familiar pull around his navel as he blinks out of existence.
Harry smiles, a snarky retort on the tip of his tongue, but then a melancholy feeling settles over him. Laying here, curled against Draco, he desperately wants all the time they’ve wasted back. Wants a time-turner so he can go and smack some sense into their younger selves. Because Harry knows that
Malfoy leans in at the noise, like he wants to hear it better, like he wants to keep all of Harry’s moans of pleasure for himself. Their gazes meet and god, Harry could drown in those stormy eyes. Malfoy looks like he wants to devour Harry, and he does just that, leaning even closer and attaching his mouth to Harry’s chest, sucking and kissing his skin until all Harry can register is the feeling of lips and teeth and tongue.
It’s not a feeling he’s familiar with. Harry has always faced things straight on, running in headfirst and figuring it out as he went. But he knows that won’t work this time, knows that it'll only push Draco further away.
“I don’t care!” Draco had yelled, immediately regretting it when his mother jumped. He continued, more quietly, “I am doing as you both asked, putting my own wants aside.” The words came out choked, broken. “She’s family. She’s coming to the wedding.”
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, running a hand through his hair and turning back to the stove, “Ron’s uh, well I think he was just surprised. I mean, he knows we’re friends but,” Harry tries to explain with a shrug.
He grabs his shampoo from the shelf, squirts some into his hands and starts to lather his hair. He tries to focus only on the task at hand, but his body has other ideas.
“That’s the important stuff. Everything else, it doesn’t matter,” Draco murmurs against his lips. His eyes are dark, his pupils dilated, black swallowing the grey.
His parents aren’t naive. They always knew that Draco wasn’t interested in women. It wasn’t discussed often but when he turned fifteen his father had sat him down and told him, plain and simple, that he would be expected to marry a nice pureblood witch and continue the Malfoy line. If he wanted to have dalliances on the side, fine, as long as he was discreet.
“Harry, just. Go on and say whatever it is before you pop a blood vessel in that thick head of yours,” Draco finally says, but there’s no bite to his words.
Hermione, of course, hounds him about seeing his mother and starts up a campaign to get him and Harry back on speaking terms. Draco ignores her efforts on both fronts.
But he wants more—needs it. The achy knot in his stomach is getting heavier and heavier, and Harry knows what will bring him relief.
“Kade Parker. It’s nice to meet you too,” Kade replies, his American accent only increasing his appeal, “Wait - Harry, as in Harry Potter?”
Draco sits on the sofa, knees drawn up to his chest as silent tears slide down his face. A bouquet of beautiful red roses sit on the coffee table next to some parchment and a quill.
Draco feels like he’s going to spontaneously combust if Harry doesn’t get on with it and fuck him already.
With his stomach full, the exhaustion finally hit him. Turning in early sounded like a good idea, but as soon as he stepped back into his bedroom and saw the bed still mussed from his and Draco’s earlier activities, he balked. He nearly ended up on the floor once more as he thought about how the sheets would still smell like them, but somehow he steadied himself long enough to floo over to Ron and Hermione’s.
“You’re welcome. Now I’m going down to put on the kettle and I’ll make some toast. You,” she looks at him pointedly, “go shower and get dressed.”
Draco has a bad feeling about what exactly Hermione needs to say to him that requires them speaking privately.
Harry pushes Draco backwards, making him fall to the bed with a grunt. Harry all but collapses on top of him, catching himself on his hands at the last second. He brings their mouths together again, moaning at the way their tongues slide together, at the little noises Draco is making in the back of his throat. Its soft at first, reaffirming something between them. But then Draco wraps his legs around Harry’s waist and his hips roll up to press against Harry, and it turns heated, very, very fast.
Harry stares at her with wide eyes, “Wait, what? But you said he wouldn’t listen,” somehow he manages to get the words out, which is impressive he thinks, considering his ears are filled with static and his tongue feels too big for his mouth.
“Yeah?” Harry picks at the label of his beer before taking a long swig, suddenly wishing he ordered something stronger.
Potter waits with a smug smile on his face as Draco’s body calms back down to a low simmering arousal.
Just then the patio doors open and Narcissa and Draco walk back outside, saving Harry from anymore awkward conversation.
Draco picks his knife back up and continues cutting the roots into half inch sections. By the time he has them cut and stored in a container for later use in his Blood Replenishing potions, Astoria still hasn’t said anything. Draco seals the container with an absentminded flick of his wand before he turns back to her.
Kade smiles sleepily and sits up slightly, using one elbow to prop himself up enough to reach Draco’s lips. He gives Draco a soft kiss before turning over and drifting easily back to sleep.
They’re both hard, already, and Draco marvels at how the smallest action can set them off, dragging them into a fog of lust and making the rest of the world fall away. Draco has never wanted someone like this before in his life, has never experienced desire like this, felt out of control and crazy with it the way he does when Harry touches him. It’s amazing and overwhelming and
Draco’s mouth slips off and he falls forward, his head resting against Harry’s thigh. He whimpers, the sound so full of desperation, that Harry’s hand tightens once more in his hair. Harry pulls roughly, lifting Draco’s head and watching as his face goes slack and come coats his fingers.
“Well, wow. That’s wonderful Hermione,” Draco’s a bit shocked at how much has changed. When Draco left, Hermione hadn’t even picked her specialty yet, Ron and George’s business was just starting to take off in the post war economy, and Rose, of course, wasn’t even thought of. Draco’s proud of his friends success but as happy as he is for them, he can’t help feeling left out. He’s missed so much.
Draco just stares at him for a moment before throwing his arms up in exasperation. He walks over to the rail of the observation deck and can’t deny that it’s a breathtaking view. The city is a twinkling sea of lights; colorful, vibrant, and honestly just astounding when you take a moment to appreciate it. The moon, almost full overhead, makes it even more beautiful. Still, Draco has no idea why they’re here. Then again, unplanned stops to admire something such as a sunset or freshly fallen snow on the trees, is not an uncommon occurrence when one is dating a photographer.
Instead, Draco says, “Scorpius has plenty of positive influences in his life already,” and he could stop there but something pushes him to antagonize his father, even though he knows the end result will be him storming home in a fit of rage, “He’s been spending a lot of time with the Potters’.”
“Does he know how you feel?” Ron asks seriously, and Harry scoffs. He might have never said the words so plainly but surely Draco knows.
Tears prickle in his eyes as he stares at Harry’s messy signature. All Draco has to do now is sign himself and then it’ll be done, their bond dissolved, making him free to marry Kade.
Harry calls for Hootie—the boys named him so Harry refuses to feel bad about the ridiculous name—tying the letter to his outstretched foot quickly, and then resumes his pacing.
One of Potter’s hands cups his hard cock, and the other tangles in his hair. Potter’s eyes are almost black, a blistering heat burning there as he stares at Draco, making him feel seen in a way no one else ever has.
“It’s the only room I haven’t changed,” Harry lets go of Draco’s hand and steps back so he can open the door, “Go ahead.”
Harry sits in the stifling quiet of the kitchen, pleading with the universe to allow him to get through the looming Weasley event without any Draco related catastrophes. Harry has a feeling Draco will be getting an invitation, whether from Ron and Hermione or Molly herself and it fills him with a sense of impending doom.
Draco absentmindedly rubs at his left forearm, a nervous habit he’s tried many times to break. Potter’s eyes flick down at the movement and understanding crosses his face. Draco isn’t sure how much Potter really sees, he’s working on assumptions here, since Draco still has yet to say anything. He should probably do that. Explain.
And George, the meddling git, immediately and loudly starts to complain about what an awful dancing partner Harry is, before insisting that Hermione switch with him. Hermione just shrugs and gives Draco an apologetic smile as she lets George pull her into a dance.
But Harry had hoped that people would keep their opinions quiet or at the very least be able to think for themselves instead of buying into the Prophet’s outrageous claims.
When he returns, Malfoy still hasn’t managed to dislodge much of the glitter and appears to have given up at this point. Harry slides his coffee and the cookie across the table with an amused smile.
He brings Draco back to the edge and leaves him there. Never giving him enough stimulation to actually tip him over. It’s torture and Draco feels like he’ll go mad from it.
He just wants to get this over with. He glances once more at his reflection, grateful it isn’t a magical mirror and therefore is quiet, before letting out a deep breath and squaring his shoulders.
“Honestly? I don’t want to help you at all. You were an insufferable, entitled bully when we were kids and I’ll never forget that,” she answers bluntly, “But you make Harry happy so I’m willing to give you a chance. And the thing is, if I do the story, you’ll both have explicit control of what gets published, people will be more inclined to believe it coming from me, and I’ll get one up on that bitch Skeeter,” she ticks off each point on her fingers, a smug smile on her face, “Plus other publications will be quick to pick up the story, I’ve no doubt.”
He has twenty minutes to get them out the door and at this rate they won’t be halfway done with their breakfast by then. And of course, there’s also the fact that it will probably take Harry nearly fifteen of those minutes to wrangle them back into the bathroom and get rid of all the stickiness. Harry doesn’t know why cleaning charms never seem to get rid of syrup but it’s an inconvenience to say the least.
But the new school term has started and Harry is otherwise occupied, so Draco has resolved himself to a day locked away in his potions lab. He usually wouldn’t be bothered by this, but as he looks down at the menacing list of potions that need brewed, he finds himself wishing he was anywhere else.
He reminds himself that he’s doing this to make his mother happy, squares his shoulders and slams down his mental walls, shielding his mind from any invasion. Even with the dementors gone, it’s still hard to hold his occlumency in place as the toxic magic practically buzzes in the air around him.
They spend the week catching up and enjoying each others company. Draco beats Ron at numerous games of Wizards Chess and he exhausts a lot of energy chasing Rose around. The latter making him think back to the times when he and Harry babysat Teddy at that age.
“What the fuck is this, Potter?” Malfoy demands, hands clenched into fists at his sides, his eyes wild and stormy.
“You can sign the divorce papers,” Draco says, pleased that his voice comes out even. He’ll never admit it but the thought of officially ending things, the finality of it, makes Draco feel like a heavy weight is pressing down on his chest, stealing his breath.
He has never seen so many Weasley’s in the same room. The sea of people crowded together in the Leaky Cauldron is ninety percent red hair and freckles. Draco does his best to hide how nervous it makes him as he walks back to the long table, his eyes catching on the single head of dark hair. Harry looks so happy, surrounded by his family and friends, smiling and laughing—he looks lit up from within.
“You brew potions all day, it’s literally the same thing,” Harry retorts, adding the onion and once again feeling thankful to Molly Weasley for teaching him the spell that keeps his eyes from burning.
Eventually he does, meeting Harry’s eyes for a brief second, before Draco leans in to whisper something in Nott’s ear, waiting for the other man to nod before he walks away towards the loo. Harry cuts Ron off mid-sentence, standing abruptly, his chair scraping loudly across the floor in his haste to follow.
. None of this is his fault though and I’m walking out there knowing I’m about to hurt him,” Draco swallows and looks away, “It’s going to hurt you too and I’ve hurt you enough already. I can’t..” Draco words choke off as he buries his face in Harry’s chest.
“I think I already am,” Harry says, the sound of his fingers moving in and out of Draco’s slick hole reverberates off the walls in the room, “I am fucking you, Draco. With my mouth. With my fingers. If you want something else, you’ll have to be more specific.”
“I didn’t. Why would you even think that?” Harry swallows and looks away, his eyes drifting back across the room, “Ginny’s the one who’s always bringing Slytherins along.”
Clothes start getting pulled off, buttons slipped through holes and zippers tugged down. Soon it’s just skin against skin, the feeling more intoxicating than all the firewhisky in the world.
Harry is at a loss for what to say. After the war people approached him constantly, thanking him and crying all over him, but it’s been a long time since that’s happened. He never felt comfortable with everyone’s gratitude towards him, but he could understand it. But this—Harry doesn’t have the faintest idea how a silly little article could mean so much to someone.
Draco flips their positions easily, laying on his back and spreading his legs in a way that makes Harry’s cock twitch. Draco is exposed, vulnerable, and completely on display. And it’s all for Harry.
Harry tugs Draco out into the hall and up a flight of stairs, coming to a stop in front of the door to the room they used to share.
“Brilliant,” Ron smiles and stands from the table, “I gotta get to the Burrow and pick up Rosie but I’ll see you tomorrow.”
There’s nothing he wants more than to be allowed to continue putting smiles like that on Draco’s face.
Draco wants Harry spread out beneath him. Wants those green eyes looking up at him. To feel those legs wrapped tightly around his waist.
Draco says his hello’s to a whole mess of Weasley’s and Gryffindor’s before making his way over to Molly, who is muttering under her breath, rearranging the table to make room for yet more food.
There are a lot of things they avoid talking about but sixth year is something that has weighed on Harry’s conscience. He never apologized and the one time he tried, Malfoy’s face had closed off before he told Harry to drop it.
Draco makes an indignant noise and pinches him. “Lies and slander,” Draco says, grinning up at Harry, “So, if more sleep isn’t an option, what do you want to do?”
“Has he been going here since the start of the term?” Harry asks, still reeling from the shock of this whole experience and positive that he would have noticed Malfoy at some point over the last two months.
“Oh, it’s fine,” his aunt says, waving off his apology, “I’m guessing you’ve been quite busy, with the wedding planning and all.”
Harry mouths at his neck, letting his teeth graze soft skin as his fingers quickly move to pull Draco’s cock free. He’s hard, heavy and hot in Harry’s hand, already slick with pre-come.
“Draco—I want. Can we—“ Harry stammers, unable to force the words out through the tightness of his throat.
Harry’s not sure how long they stay like that, just touching and kissing. Draco’s skin is warm, his lips smiling and eyes soft, and Harry thinks--
“I’m so sorry Draco,” Harry murmurs, his arms urging Draco closer. Instead, Draco takes a step back, watching the way Harry’s jaw clenches, “I didn’t know how to tell you. I mean you’re the one who left. You knew he was old and -“ Harry breaks off with a grunt as Draco shoves at his chest with both hands.
to let go of it, Draco. Tell him how you feel, just talk to him,” Astoria urges, and Draco is tempted to listen, “What’s the worse that can happen? Harry says he doesn’t feel the same way and you stay friends? But the best thing that could happen, think about that,” Astoria says, her voice soft.
at the morning edition of the Prophet. He almost feels like he’s watching from somewhere outside of his body as the paper bursts into flames, the engagement announcement disappearing until all that’s left is a pile of ash.
Draco hums and swallows, still suckling gently. Harry doesn’t move for a few minutes, staying right there, kneeling over Draco and running gentle fingers through his hair, down the side of his face and across his bruised throat.
Harry doesn't care much for Valentine’s Day. He thinks it’s ridiculous that people need a holiday specifically designed to remind them to tell the people they love,
After his mother and Harry are out of sight, Draco nervously takes a seat at the table, indicating with his hand that Kade should do the same.
Draco makes a sound like all the air has just been punched out of his lungs. “Oh fuck, oh fuck, fuck.” He’s still clawing desperately at the sheets, so Harry leans forward to grab his hands and tangle their fingers together.
He doesn’t fight it when Harry’s tongue slides between his lips. Doesn’t question what brought this on so suddenly. Only whines, when a hand roughly yanks at his hair, breaking the kiss and making his head hit the wall behind him with a thud.
As he approaches the entrance to the hotel he notices an owl perched on a bench next to the glass doors. A few passing Muggles are giving the bird strange looks, so he slides his wand discreetly out of the end of his sleeve and casts the charm Hermione used at the café.
“I apologize, Potter,” Draco says as he fidgets with the lid on his cup, “I just, got in my own head. I thought you possibly had a wildly unusual lapse in judgement and wouldn’t take too kindly to hearing from me again. We’ve never been friends before and I guess I don’t understand why you’d suddenly want to now.”
“I’m sure. I want this forever Draco, marry me,” Kade replies, cutting off Draco’s protests with a patient smile.
And now that he has the taste of Draco on his lips, he doesn’t think he’ll ever get rid of it. He’ll never be able to forget this feeling, his mind already storing it away for safe keeping. Harry savors it, enjoying all the sensations, cataloging every one.
When Draco goes inside he is immediately met by an Auror guard, and he wonders to himself why anyone in their right mind would want to work in a place like this. He gives his name and signs the visitors log. He’s forced to leave his wand in a lock box, along with all his other personal belongings.
He squeezes, watches Draco’s eyes flutter, hears his breath choke off—and that’s it. Harry comes, his cock pulsing and covering Draco’s stomach and chest in ropes of white. His hand shifts, sliding down and through the mess, smearing it into Draco’s skin, marking him.
“Of course I knew.” Ron laughs, clapping a hand to Harry’s shoulder. “I was waiting for you to tell me, mate.”
“If I win you have to wear my scarf for the rest of the day,” Draco states, waving the end of the scarf in Potter’s direction.
This time of year, Harry would normally be flavoring his coffee with something festive to the season. He’s a big fan of peppermint, but he’s been on a vanilla kick for weeks now. And no, it has absolutely nothing to do with Draco Malfoy.
Malfoy nods and focuses on paying attention to what’s unfolding on the telly. Harry ends up watching Malfoy’s reactions more so than the actual movie, fascinated by the matching looks of wonder on Malfoy’s and Scorp’s faces.
Draco sighs, “Yeah, I just—“ Draco stands and stretches, his muscles tight from sitting for so long in one position, “I was just thinking.”
Harry kisses his way across Draco’s chest, letting his tongue caress each scar. He sucks purple bruises into the pale skin; one at the base of Draco’s throat, one just below his right nipple, one over his rib cage.
“Fine, but I’m telling you, Harry has feelings for you,” she insists before turning away with a smirk and leaving Draco in silence once again.
And Harry didn’t think he could possibly love Draco anymore than he already did. But in that moment, his feelings expand into something even bigger, and Harry thinks that maybe loving Draco has no limits. That maybe he’ll never be able to measure it or contain it.
“I’m gonna spread you out and put my mouth on you while I open you up. I’ll take my time, make it last until you’re begging me to let you come. Then, I’m gonna fuck you so hard you forget everything except my name,” Potter rasps in reply, and Draco whimpers as his cock twitches and leaks in Potter’s hand.
“Maybe,” Draco steps back and starts walking again, pulling a dazed looking Harry along, “So, do you have anything else planned?”
Draco just laughs and accepts the plate that’s piled high with Molly’s delicious food. He’s just opening his mouth to speak when her eyes light up at something, or someone rather, behind him.
“Would everyone shut the hell up,” Ginny yells and it’s rather effective, the noise dying down a bit. Blaise slings an arm around her slender shoulders and grins.
Everyone welcomes Blaise easily, congratulating the new couple with hugs and back slaps. Draco is drawn into the excitement and never does get an explanation.
“I’m sorry,” she says, an apologetic smile on her face, “I don’t mean to make you uncomfortable, dear. It’s just that you look so much like your mother.”
Harry has every opportunity to stop him. He could grab Draco’s wrist, he could say no, but he doesn’t. If anything, the moan that Harry breathes out against Draco’s ear sounds like enthusiastic approval.
Harry is lonely and bored and maybe just a little bit drunk and that has to be why he can’t stop thinking about Malfoy.
“Why did you quit the Aurors? I’m assuming something drastic must of happened to change your mind,” Draco says, failing to keep the bitterness out of his voice.
“Is that a Phoenix Fire Tree?” he exclaims when he finds his voice again and Harry just nods, “Where in the hell did you get it?”
The sound of Malfoy shuffling around downstairs snaps Harry out of his thoughts before he can examine the feeling too closely.
When Draco stands slowly, his legs are like that of a newborn Thestral—soft and unsteady. He’s a mess, he knows, his chin wet with spit and come. Tears still cling to his eyelashes. His hair mussed from Potter’s hands, fair skin a blotchy red.
Draco is writhing against him now, his moans and whimpers getting louder. He tips his head back onto Harry’s shoulder, exposing the perfect line of his throat, and Harry presses open-mouthed kisses there, nipping at the skin behind his ear the way he knows Draco likes. The action draws a loud whine from Draco, and he tenses up against Harry, obviously worried someone will hear.
