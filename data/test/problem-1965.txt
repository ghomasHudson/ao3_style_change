They stared at him.
Malfoy stepped around him, walking to join Luna and the others.
“Ah, ah, ah,” Snape said. “Not quite yet, I think. This is part of the assignment. You will remain as you are for the entire hour, noting the differences in the body, and when you’ve transformed back, you will have Draco perform a gender transfiguration on you so that you may compare the effects. You knew this, Potter.”
In December, Hogwarts let out for holiday break. Harry was feeling back to normal now, but the prospect of an eight-minute Portkey was threatening to change that. If the Portkey trip didn’t, Draco’s ranting would. At least it wasn’t hurricane season.
something. It came to me, but it was really slow. And I couldn’t manage a
His son, who he was seeing less and less now that they he, Draco, and Astoria were all living in the castle. Scorpius had rarely seen his mother during their travels, and he was making up for it by staying with her every night, with no sign of returning to his room in Draco’s suite more than once every other night. Given how frustrated Draco’d been while creating his lesson plans, he supposed he couldn’t blame Scorpius.
Draco’s fingers slid from Harry’s. No one in the circle stepped back. Narcissa’s hands were shivering again.
Malfoy regarded him. “All right, fine. But not tonight. I’m going to Sluggy’s.”
He was reminded, once more, how his mother hadn’t been able to leave the Manor grounds for over a decade, that his father was still serving a community service sentence chosen specifically for how it would humiliate him, how Draco himself had been all but exiled from his own country after serving his own house-arrest sentence. Britain did not want the Malfoys to have a saving grace; if they got one, it would come from the gods themselves.
When she leaves again, Ron snickers. Harry sends him a dark look but it only makes Ron laugh harder. “See if I make
“Neither of those,” said Harry. “It’s making me miss the eight years I was single, miserable, and desperately lonely.”
“Yes...” she said slowly.
And so would Malfoy.
“I would be on my bed, and it would be warm, the light moving all around me. I’m rushed with anticipation. He says my name as he crawls onto the bed, hovers over me. My pulse speeds up, my chest begins to slowly heave. He’s finally there, and now I’m alight, but still somehow terrified.
Harry snapped to attention. He’d almost forgotten what that voice sounded like. “Professor Snape.”
“For my humiliation and misery?” he clarified.
“I didn’t know you had a school trip planned today, Harry,” she said. “Hi, Dudley. Anyone need a carry-out juice?”
Malfoy gave him a look too distracted to be annoyed, nodded his head. “Fine, grab on.”
“Can I be white and blonde?” Harry asked, hopefully. “With a nice figure and a pretty face, too. Basically, make me look like Hannah Abbott.”
Galene fussed, unable to approach, but horrified at the state of her mistress. The Council looked away, their eyes suspiciously wet. The Queen was dying, not at all peacefully.
Harry was not sure if he wanted to know what that meant, so he didn’t ask. Luna put an arm around his shoulder and led him into the waiting car. He slid inside and found himself face to face with three cameras and stage lightning. He blinked. Luna shoved in beside him, beaming.
“Hmm,” said Nott, as, apparently, all Slytherins did. But he did walk off and rejoin Padma, who was talking with Hermione about the wand-switching ceremony that would start the celebrations off that evening.
“I tripped over her in Knockturn when I was in Auror training. She was only a month old then and could stay visible long enough not to get stepped on.”
“Likewise,” Mr Weasley said, not missing a beat.
The expression on Hermione’s face remained pained. She said, carefully, “You are very…altered by your experiences with Voldemort. You were so young. And you didn’t have a lot of stimuli before Hogwarts.”
think that,” she says, her entire body stiff with the tension of
Draco’s arm tightened around his chest and Harry felt the hot pulse of his come shooting inside him. Harry gasped for breath, taking in lungful after lungful of salt water. He opened his eyes; his come was floating before him, slowly dispersing with the ebb and flow of the ocean. They were floating upwards.
“Harry, there you are,” said Luna, peering into the alcove they shared. “Hello, Hermione. Harry, I didn’t think I needed to remind you that you’re not allowed to have sex with any of the contenders before the end of the season. It gives an unfair advantage.”
Malfoy was hired at Hogwarts exactly three days after his five years of house arrest (and further seven years of—entirely self-imposed—exile) ended. Harry knew because he pitched a fantastic fit that morning in the Headmistress’s office.
Draco’s eyes immediately fell to the area in question. The moment lasted thirty years, in Harry’s estimation. He’d never had his cock out in front of anyone before, save for the Quidditch changing rooms, and he would’ve expected to feel horribly exposed and vulnerable with some fit bloke staring right at it.
of them. The newer ones were more likely to have the really nasty stuff in them, so that was where they would start – even though those were also the most likely to be noticed as missing.

Harry grinned at him. “Great, come on!”
Draco beamed at him. Their friends cheered. Through it all, Harry managed to make out Rosie’s, “You’ll let Mum and me coordinate it, right Uncle Harry?”
Ron shook his head. “‘Bout as well as you’d expect,” he said. “It was… amicable.”
“Do it, Scarhead,” Draco panted. His head was thrown back, his lip caught between his teeth. Harry could live off this view.
So did the pull at the centre of his eyebrows, a constant line of worry that you couldn’t really see until you got this close, sat right across from him at the staff table. Harry didn’t know where Malfoy’d fucked off to for the last seven years, but he did know he’d taken his and Astoria’s son with him for all it. She’d come to Hogwarts only months after their divorce, pregnant, while Malfoy was still globetrotting.
“The Weasleys, I imagine,” said Harry.
“If there’s magic in the landfills, then there’s magic left in
There was a knock on his open door and Hermione poked her head in. “Time for a cuppa?” she asked.
“She’s great, yeah.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione muttered. “Just you wait. Seven
Malfoy turns suddenly, noticing Harry’s now awake. His morning erection is still in evidence. The scowl on his face does nothing to ruin the effect. “Oh good, you’re awake. Lunch? I intend to catch the McQueen show this afternoon if you want to come with. I promised Pansy I’d report back on the wedding robes.”
“I fucking know they do, Potter. I just thought I was done chasing after them. All right, fine. Someone’s working inside. What are your instincts saying we should do?”
Harry toed Draco’s foot, and when he looked up, Harry grinned slyly. Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry didn’t miss the pleased smile on his face or the pink tinge to his cheeks.
Lucius frowned. “I realise you have little regard for my decision-making skills, and frankly, I can agree, to a point. But this was a risk I felt necessary to take.”
Harry beamed at him. Draco hid a smile behind his glass as he sipped on his mulled wine again. “I’ve never had this drink before,” he said. “Dad thought it was common.”
Next to Draco, Potter rubbed his face with both hands as if he could wipe off all his sensory organs and not have to live through this shitshow any longer if he did it hard enough.
Draco smirked. “We’re brilliant.”
Ron resumed his relaxed pose against the wall, his legs stretched out before him on the bed. “I was beginning to wonder if you’d changed your mind about preferring blokes…haven’t heard about anyone special, you know?”
Hermione frowned and brought the jar up to her eyes to look closer. “It’s beautiful,” she said, still frowning. “It’s just a caterpillar.”
Harry, suddenly, remembered the alien trying to cross its leg, blinking even though it didn’t need to. “She was saying we’re all the same, we’ve got the same purpose. But the aliens don’t. She was saying to stick with our own kind: Muggles and magicals together against the aliens. It’s vaguely racist—which is very much my Aunt Petunia—but I think I get what she means.”
Malfoy smirks. “Linen and tweed."
“What are you doing?”
Harry grabbed the girls directly after and dragged them outside to the shed, amid Mr Weasley’s muggle miscellanea. “What happened?”
“Thanks,” Draco says, and his voice sounds old, too, but beneath it all, Harry hears the man he married when he was twenty-two years old. He hears the man he fell in love with when he was nineteen. In the infinitesimal span of seconds that passes then, Harry’s life flashes before his eyes, but this time, he sees it as it would’ve been if they’d never separated. It would’ve been loud and hellish, angry and passionate, soft and funny. It would’ve been the best life in the world.
Draco followed him in, cool as ever, despite his less-than-coordinated steps. “Granger.”
It’s the last time Harry sees him before he loses him.
Draco exhaled heavily. Their bodies were too close together. He sipped his chocolate, not nearly as gracefully as he normally did. “This is completely fucked,” he whispered.
“Er—I’ll just…” and then Potter scrambled after Granger.
“Immortality,” Draco said. “And transformation of base metals into precious ones.” He chewed on his bottom lip with his erotically crooked canine teeth. “They’re such wildly different effects that I can’t think of
Harry straightened, his heart hammering. “You have magic again?”
Ron’s reply was immediate:
.” He glanced around the room, then casually flicked his wand, erecting a muffling charm. “That’s what we need for the next step.”
“I’d nearly forgotten! It was a letter!”
He doesn’t even have time to rethink the wording before Malfoy’s tensing up and whining low in his throat. The first burst of come lands on Harry’s cheek and he belatedly remembers to close his eyes. Malfoy’s gasping and covering Harry’s lips and chin with hot strings of come, and it is without doubt the hottest fucking thing he’s ever experienced in his entire life. He melts into it, feeling warm and aroused and like he needs to be fucked
She frowned, but nodded. “I have the tapestry I can work on, I suppose,” said Narcissa.
“Alright, ladies and gentleman,” said a black-haired man two down on Malfoy’s left. “For those of you new to our little league, we run an auction starter. One hundred galleons gets you in the league and a thousand points to bid with. We run a standard team, with three substitutes allowed. Three galleons for each additional player purchased from the pot. Trading may commence a week hence, once official rankings are up for the first round of games. Any questions?”
Harry sighed. “Fine.”
Draco turned from his contemplation of the street outside the window when Harry set his whiskey in front of him. “I asked for a pink umbrella charm and a swizzle wand, but Rosmerta said she’s out of poncey paraphernalia. Sorry.”
Harry nodded, but he was still thinking about how much he really didn’t want the magical world to die. He had a low-grade horror simmering right under his skin, and he felt like this was a dream, that it was even worse than Voldemort. And Ron didn’t have the energy to deal, and even Orkney seemed to think that if they acted like it wasn't a problem, then there wouldn't be a problem. Harry wished he could do the same. He couldn't.
“How about Ruby?” Hermione said, turning another page.
Dawlish’s eyes narrow. He looks at Harry for a long time, long enough that Harry starts to wonder if something’s wrong. Finally, he opens his mouth. “I’m benching you, Potter. You’re on leave until you get your head sorted.”
“Who the bloody hell is hungry at a time like this?” Draco snapped.
would have a bloody invisibility cloak,” Draco mumbled. Feeling his muscles start to relax, the panic subsiding in his stomach.
Still, he’d punch the idiot if he told anyone.
Eyes closing, Draco was ok.
Draco changed, careful to avoid anything touching his left forearm, which remained hot and painful and began climbing the stairs to the bathroom. A long, quiet bath was what Draco needed. He closed the door firmly behind him and rolled up his sleeve to inspect the mark, hissing in pain, eyes burning with tears of frustration.
Draco bowed his head, hoping he looked suitably guilty, as he bit down the inside of his cheek to stop the smile threatening his face.
There was an irony in that somewhere.
“Do you want me to go?” Harry asked quietly, eyeing him with curiosity.
Sadness, frustration, hopeful disbelief. “Do you really believe in all that?”
“I am happy.  Honestly.  I don’t need anyone to complete me.  I’m fully actualized, all on my own.”  Harry knew that he was oversimplifying things.  True, he didn’t
“That’s a good idea,” Hermione says.  “And we don’t have to do it all at once.”
The snake deigns to try the potion.  “How long must I stay here?”
Astoria laughed.  “Scorpius has been lying in wait since six o’clock this morning for her arrival.  When she arrived on Greg’s arm, he practically exploded with delight, and dragged them both to his room.”
“I don’t think that you should be alone right now.  I know the look on your face very well.  Will you go to your friend Granger?”
“And, you know, it’s the funniest thing,” Harry continued, in a voice that suggested it was anything but, “but I’d gotten used to things being uncertain, and fairly horrible, here in England, and when I moved to Canada, they got better.  A lot better.  And I got arrogant, or complacent or something.  And I sort of thought that I’d used up all my bad luck.”
Given the state of the heather near Glasgow – near to completely dead – it could be anything. All of magical Scotland could suddenly become visible, and they’d have to just let it happen. The last time they’d come this close to using all their Obliviations for the year was during the first war with Voldemort, and the UMN had granted the extension then.
He turned and glared at the camera, as if it were Miles’ fault he’d just admitted that. Miles rolled his eyes. The red light on the camera continued to blink.
Harry clenched his fists. He hated being mocked. “Thanks. It’s really better for fumes, I’ve found. Plus, the stable temperature provided by the windowless, draught-free dungeon climate is ideal for brewing sensitive potions.”
Dudley had exited his own bed and was sitting by Ms Williams’s, holding a low-voiced conversation with her as she took impossibly small bites of her chocolate bar. Ms Lovecraft, who was in Draco’s fifth-year Ancient Cultures and Casting class, and Potter were both out cold. Mr Lao was leaning over Potter, running a number of diagnostics with his wand. He frowned at the readings and retreated to the Matron’s office, presumably to pull Potter’s chart.
“There’s also the small matter of the spellcasters likely losing their magic,” Malfoy said quietly.
The sound alerted the rest of the household, and suddenly there were a dozen or more people crowding into the tiny room. Millicent and Hermione were first to arrive, and then Ron, and Lavender, Ginny and Luna, who called down the stairs that he was awake. Harry heard Mrs Weasley yelling something into the floo, and then McGonagall was rushing up the stairs, and Snape was back in his frame, and it was, in short, a clusterfuck of Weasleys et al.
They also covered the trial of the Obliviator, and the Ministry’s continued efforts to lock-in aid from the UMN, but they were now fighting over how to punish UK for breaking the Statute, potentially on an irreparable scale. Harry was deeply unimpressed with bureaucracy at this point in his life and did not expect to ever change his mind on that.
“And our daughter, Libertas,” said Kyle. “Libby, for short.”
Harry paused. He hadn’t stopped to think how the other re-sorted Hufflepuffs had got here. “How Hufflepuff, exactly?”
“I’m not reckless! That’s Harry!” Ron said.
Granger bit her lip, shook her head. “A willing volunteer.”
In the front, Dudley sat in the co-pilot’s seat, a thermos of tea in one hand, while he and his friend chatted over their electronic earmuffs to one another. Millicent was sat in the next seat back, with the alien next to her, listening in through her own earmuffs, but contributing nothing. She just stared out the window, frowning. Granger and Weasley sat behind them, hands clenched tightly together, while Granger read through the spells again and again, making notes in the margins with a lead pencil.
She narrowed her eyes, and Draco leaned back, arms crossed over his chest, smirking. His legs stretched out beneath the table and tangled with Harry’s.
This made Malfoy point his binoculars back to the Slytherin stands. He looked for a few seconds and then laughed. “Zabini, you sly Slytherin,” he said.
“Seriously, how did you not have nightmares all night? I don’t think I’d even be able to fall asleep with that git in the room.”
“What?” Harry heard himself saying, as if from far away.
, his mind told him. Candles in the window around his bed, Poppy’s voice speaking quietly at the other end of the ward.
“I mean it!” Draco says, face a blotchy red. It’s strangely endearing; reminds Harry of the flush he gets when he’s about to come, only this time he’s been crying. “Get out.”
“No!” Harry says. “Of course not!” But Draco doesn’t look any happier. Harry doesn’t
“Hello there, Malfoy. Awake, are you?”
“Yeah, and we hated each other for most of it,” Harry said.
Merlin, he was absolutely batty.
The Portkey activated, Harry yelped as he spun away. He could already tell this was going to be a bumpy trip, and he had at least eight minutes to go.
“Dinner’s almost ready,” Ron says.
“That great,” Harry said. Despite what Snape might’ve thought, Harry was not an idiot, and in fact maths came to him quite easily. When it was just the two of them, Hermione knew that she could give him the numbers, and they wouldn’t go entirely over his head. “So we’ll actually have more time to figure this out than we thought.”
“I think I called him Professor Horn sometimes,” Harry whispered to Draco. As soon as he did, he remembered: they weren’t friends anymore. They weren’t
Her remaining Cane Corso whined, and she murmured to it soothingly. It moved closer to her wicker chair, curled up again, head resting on her feet.
Draco only rolled his eyes.
Yaxley cackled.
“Cheers,” Harry echoed, and took a swig. It burned. It tasted like fiery cranberry. It was amazing. They settled into an easy camaraderie there in the corner, ragging on the other seventh and eighth years in attendance, and for a while, Harry liked it.
“I’m okay,” he said. And he was, mostly. He’d been okay for ten years. No matter what happened here, he’d be okay. He always was.
“My father wouldn’t have been,” Malfoy muttered.
Harry did laugh, ducking his head, to hide the extent of his fondness for McGonagall and her inability to be subtle, even when she was breaking the rules. There was no question about whether or not to trust her. Headmistress or not, they were of a kind, and Gryffindors were loyal to their own. “One might be a crow, Headmistress.”
“We have reconfigured the spell the Atlanteans originally used to hide their island from the aliens to hide the entire planet from the aliens. It will, in effect, take us out of this dimension’s time and space without stopping our own progression of time. Essentially, it moves us to a brand new, alien life-free parallel universe—for a time. Everything will look the same, only the alien culture won’t exist on the new plane. The magic will run out in a few hundred to a few thousand years, bringing us back to where we are now.”
“I need to ask Granny a question,” Teddy said quickly, and rushed after them.
Fields laughs. “See if you can make anything of this, Potter. Mitchell, give me the golems, I’m going to show him the spell underpinnings.”
The chicken entrails had been right, then. It was an auspicious day to start a new life.
“Anything at all? It’s blank?”
She had.
Professor Sprout had never looked so grim. She snapped stasis spells over every one of the samples, and said, “I don’t want anyone touching these again. If there’s something in the soil creating a conduit to magical cores, we don’t need to do any magic around it. This might be how it’s draining the magic from each of the regions. I’ll figure out what to do with these. For now, everyone go straight to the kitchens and get some hot chocolate to help regenerate any magic you may’ve lost from this experiment.”
, at all. Dudley?”
“Either because I specialise in water habitats,” Harry said, “Or they wanted me out of the country.”
go well. Am I clear?”
“Illegal breeding scheme,” Nott murmured. He raised an eyebrow at Malfoy. “You remember those from your youth, eh?”
“Ugh, can we not talk about that for just one bloody evening. It’s all I think about,” Ron said.
“About two hundred knots east of Cape May, New Jersey. The Chesapeake Merrows have claimed it.”
“All right, Harry. I’ll lay off for now. Let’s just get through NEWTs and then we’ll have all summer at Ron’s to decompress.”
Teddy and Rosie gave him disgusted looks. “Come on, Rosie,” Teddy said. “Let’s leave these two to their
“From where?”
“I feel it,” Neville said. His eyes spanned the table’s offerings, and he grimaced. “Can’t a man have a bloody sausage?”
Harry stilled. Were they really going to have this conversation? Was he really going to have to say that thing that was hovering between them, unspoken? “You were sleeping,” he said carefully.
Harry’s smile was sudden and rapturous. Malfoy had already turned away to tend to his beleaguered owl and didn’t see it. A challenge he could work with. And the prospect of learning how Malfoy had ended up in Hufflepuff seemed the best challenge of all. He set about unpacking his trunk with new gusto. It kept him from thinking about how far away from Ron and Hermione he was tonight.
There had been no ancient spell that could change the hearts and minds of people, but there had been many, many other strange and interesting ones. Spells that turned tigers into butter; and thirty-four different kinds of sexual lubrication spells from around the world; and Viking rituals to make their ships sail without wind or water.
Malfoy snorted. “Merlin, Potter, you’re as mad as a centaur. But it’ll at least be interesting watching you fail. You do that well enough. Try
Malfoy quirked a grin. He had a rather nice grin, actually. And his cheeks, when they were flushed from exertion, were quite nice, too. “I wish that I could brag about this, but I’d much rather have a shot at a second go, so I won’t.”
Dudley stared at his screen, then said, “Hey, everyone, you’ve probably noticed by now the fire and brimstone raining down from the skies. I hope you’re safe and your families are safe. If you pledged to help my cousin Harry perform a spell that would save the world, now’s the time. We’re doing it today.”
Harry scowled. Malfoy shrugged. “At least we guessed the correct construction of a double rainbow. It was stacked after all.”
“It’s a
going to get through this.
“They’ve got one on every corner,” he said, gesturing to the three-tailed Starbucks. “Which one are we supposed to turn at again?”
Anthony shrugged. “I like winter sports, and also being better at them than everyone else.”
Draco laughed breathily. “I’ve another thing I can do better than you now, too. Watch.” Harry scrambled off him, and he stood, flicked open his water bottle to pour some out into his hand. He closed his fist, then his eyes, concentrating. When he opened his hand again, the water was slick and viscous. “The examiners liked this one. Olive oil from water. Wandless.”
Malfoy smirked. “Heard about that, did you? Wasn’t even in the papers. You do keep up with me, don’t you?”
Harry scoffed, forced a smile. “As if.”
“Yeah,” Ron says.
He doesn’t enjoy it enough. Or rather, he enjoys it too much. Tomorrow, he’ll blame it on the harslevelu—a dry varietal from Hungary, Draco tells him over dinner—but the day after, he’ll know it’s a lie.
“What have you uncovered?” she asks, but with Ron in the room, she’s got her full
Draco followed. Whether Potter was leading him to hell or salvation, he didn’t know. But he was going anyway, and all he had to trust was this fresh, trembling realisation that Potter wanted to live, too. And when they got out of this shit, Draco was going to make damned sure Potter did that living with him.
He rushed to Albus’s room and snicked open the door as quietly as he could. Ms Danger was still invisible, still panting in his arms, but he only had eyes for the bed, and his only living son sleeping peacefully there.
“Painting,” Harry finally decides, sending Draco a confused look as though to say, ‘What is wrong with me, where do I get these ideas?’ “He’s helping me restore Grimmauld.”
But that was all whatever compared to what the day meant to Harry: Draco.
“I can keep secrets from you,” said Harry.
She demonstrated the wand movement and the chant to bring up the ward at that leypoint.
Harry stood, pushed his stool back. Leaning forward a bit, he smirked. “You do.”
magic. Not modern magic. The spell took our magic and gave it to all the Muggles in the web, and as a thanks for protecting it from the aliens, it gave us some of itself in return. Wild magic.”
Harry stared into the fire, thinking. Did he have that problem? There were times when he’d ignored Hermione’s good advice because he didn’t like it, and certainly a better man would’ve sucked it up with Snape’s Occlumency lessons. Maybe he did. But did he still?
“She was the firstborn of the family at the time, and stood to inherit the family grimoire and other things. Her younger brother didn’t care for that, so he brought charges against her, saying her midwifery and medicines were works of the devil. The family has yet to apologise for that, and so extending invitations to them for it is, as you can well guess, stomach-churning.”
Harry and Malfoy just stared at her.
Harry’s bravado starts to deflate. He opens his mouth but nothing of consequence wants to come out.
“It’s just thirty-six hours,” Harry said, tiredly. He was ready for about three cups of coffee himself. “And I slept off seven of them.”
“And what’s with
He really had no idea why Albus wouldn’t rather learn to fly with his mother, who was a retired star Chaser for the Harpies, Albus’s favourite team.
“Mother’s made the arrangements,” Draco continued, as if Harry hadn’t spoken. “Redfellow saves the day, apparently. You’re on a 3pm Portkey to London, where Weasley will arrest you at the Portkey Arrivals gate.”
“Nothing.”
“Draco,” Severus said. Draco looked up. “You need the Muggles. You can’t let them forget Atlantis.”
He caught sight of the microwave when he passed and grimaced. It was nearly midnight. Hermione was bound to be up at first light banging on the lid of his trunk to get him up and working. Ah, well. It was worth it. He turned the oven on and selected a couple of pies from the icebox. Then he grabbed the kettle and poured in some fresh water from his wand, rather than the over-chlorinated sludge that came from the tap. The oven chirped that it was ready. Harry slid in two pies and pulled down some cups from the cupboard.
She flopped down on his couch, leant her head back against the rest in a way she’d never do in front of anyone else. “I never thought teaching children how to paint and draw would take so much planning. Seven years doing it, and it’s still a pain in my pert arse.”
“You never said what you named the cat.”
Ron scowled at him, but it was hard to pass up beer and grilled cheese. And Rosie’s Hermione look, which was excessively intimidating.
“Ron…” Mr Weasley said, picking up on clues his son had not.
The first thing Draco noticed about Atlantis was it was a culture in love with dogs, which was certainly not something that Plato mentioned in his fanciful tales about the island. Neither had his mother mentioned it in the stories she told him, nor any of the endless books he read on Atlantis as a child. Not even the precious journal he’d paid 1,800 Galleons for during Christmas hols sixth year, just to give himself something nicer to focus on every now and then.
. The way his name felt in Harry’s mouth…He could get used to saying it, far too easily.
He clenched his fist around a morel, accidentally destroying it.
Harry snorted. “Those bastard Malfoys?” he repeated, grinning.
Malfoy waves his wand—even though Harry’s told him a million times not to wear it in his shows; he does anyway, usually on a strap on his arm that Harry begrudgingly spells to match—and cleans them both up. He tucks himself back in, zips and buttons up the trousers, and exhales.
Malfoy pulled himself up on one elbow to look down at Harry. His face was contorted with disbelief. “No one? Ever? You’re twenty-six years old.” Belatedly, they both remembered that silencing spells existed and Malfoy cast one. He said, “You’ve never come without something in your arse, and you’ve never come from someone else pleasuring you?”
Harry dropped his head, panting. His elbow began to tremble and he knew he had to roll away or else he’d collapse on top of Draco. He opened his eyes to look at him again, to have this one moment where they’d done this to each other, and their bodies were still tangled together as they ought to be, and was surprised to find Draco looking back at him.
He looked over her shoulder, stared in confusion. Hermione felt him stiffen, and pulled away to look, as if she would be able to see the same thing he was seeing. “Erm.”
“Yeah, I don’t see that happening in the near future,” Potter said wryly.
Harry was both annoyed by the sentiment and thoughtful of the questions. “Draco, really,” he said. “The economy would grow to support them. It might even lead to innovation.”
“The bond pulls emotion from—unnecessary sources.” He can’t help swallowing heavily around that last bit. It sticks in his throat, choking him. His brain, consistently unhelpful, flashes back to the last night he had with Draco, and how
They set off towards their classroom, Dudley carrying his satchel of notes and teaching props on one shoulder.
“She isn’t much for rhyming verse,” Malfoy added. “Or, really, good prose at all. I suppose you’ve read the
More vigorous nodding. Draco frowned at them for good measure, then, when he was satisfied they were absolutely taking this seriously, he spelled the instructions onto the board.
“She won’t,” Millicent said with certainty. “You know how she loves a good rebellion.”
Harry opened his mouth to answer—
Harry scowled. “I’m done with that. I want to do something unexpected.” It wasn’t until he said it that he realized how true it really was—and then, he paused, mouth parting slightly in understanding. That must be what his boggart meant; he was afraid of
Hermione was standing, leant over her seat-back and glaring at all of them. “We’ve tested this spell to the greatest extent possible, but in
And then: why would he
because all that confidence he’d gained with the Aurors would be shot to shit if he found out ‘best mate’ meant ‘Malfoy’ not ‘Ron’.
After a few minutes, Draco cleared his throat. “What’s your problem with the boggart in the wardrobe?” he asked.
“Yes,” said Draco, and neatly ignored the part where Hermione had been angling for him to tell her what it was without her having to ask. Harry hid a smirk behind his not-faux beer. He liked the way Draco’s eyes slid to the side a bit when he was especially pleased with something he’d done; he liked the way the grey of them reflected light from an angle. He liked pretty much everything.
Harry kept his back to Draco as he worked. “Yeah. Lots of practice these days.”
Draco smirked some more. “Why don’t you shut it for me?”
“Yes! And what’s more—wands create channels. Natural magic flows freely, like a cloud. But wands direct magic in a single direction—like mini-leylines. If we adapted this spell to wands, we could direct the magic to conduits that would amplify it
“Oh, god!” Harry said, leaning back. “It’s hideous.”
Hermione made that pained noise again. She jumped up. “I think I left my Arithmancy notes in the library.”
Dune gave him a ruddy-cheeked smile as he stalked over to collect his Snitch. Harry gave the next one to Hermione, and made sure to stare directly into the cameras as he did so, so that Ron would know that Harry knew exactly what he was doing. Then he gave one to Titus, because he was still a good-looking fuck, even if he did go a bit wild on the margaritas. The last two went to Socorro and Zeph, leaving just Ruby and Michael Corner without Snitches. Michael was a nice bloke, but Harry really didn’t get any fuck-me vibes from him, and Ruby was…Merlin, was Ruby gorgeous, but Harry could tell when someone wasn’t interested in him. Harry gave them an apologetic smile and they were good sports about it.
“Yes, well,” said Hermione. And because, like Harry, she’d learned to read Slytherins of late, she added, “It would have been more impressive if I could’ve managed to reverse it after the war, but I couldn’t. And they thought Harry and I were con artists trying to kill them for their life insurance policy.”
Malfoy takes the sunglasses off, to both Harry’s relief and distress, and gives him a pointed look. “What’s wrong?” he says again.
Susan elbows her partner in the ribs and then steps forward to hand Malfoy a card. He opens it, frowning at whatever’s written inside. “It’s the counter to the jinx Ron put on the basket,” she says. “It came from his brother’s shop.”
He pulled that paper out of the file and handed it to Hermione. Even as he did so, another name popped up on the YES list.
Draco waved him off, and the look on his face said that this was about to turn into the worst non-date ever. Harry leaned back, trying to put as much space between them as he could stomach. He was fairly certain that Draco was going to try to talk about
“Arsehole!” Lee yelled, swiping ineffectually at the remains of his latte on his jacket.
The wizard behind the Arrivals desk smirked and continued typing on his computer, pretending he wasn’t listening. A sign behind him had an enlarged photograph of a witch in thigh-length American flag robes, with a caption that read: Terminal M, Gate One-Seventh, Washington, DC International Airport.
—I’ll brief you all on the finer points.”
His fingers curl into Nigella’s fur as she takes a particularly laborious breath. She is giving her magic to make sure
He waits until she leaves and then points his wand into the desk drawer, shrinking the file. He slips it into his pocket and then slips out of the Embassy. He does go home, but only to get his invisibility cloak. He doesn’t care if Draco wants to see him. He’s
“Morning Hermione, morning Harry,” Lavender said, as she set a spoon to stir Mr Weasley’s tea. Fleur, sitting two seats down next to Bill, and Angelina next to George, both sent Hermione horrified looks, to which Hermione grimaced in response. Bonding over inadequacy, Harry could well understand. He set Snape’s portrait on the table and refused to meet George’s eyes afterwards.
Harry thought firmly.
There was a silence. Hannah was blinking very fast, apparently lost in thought. “Ooh,” she finally said. Neville grinned at her. Then, again, she said, “Ooh, I really like this. Harry! You’re magnificent!”
“Of course,” said Draco, scandalised. “Do you honestly think I’d risk Potter’s stupid arse when the Ministry is just looking for a reason to have done with Mum and me like they did Dad?”
“We’ll find out today,” Lee said. “Amazingly, I found actual, real information on the major Mer tribes of North America from the Google. I’ve got some ideas on what we might expect from them for demands, but I want all of us to read these culture briefs before we approach them.”
“Harry!” Draco yelled. Harry heard his chair scrape back, crash to the floor. There were footsteps and then he was flipped over, Draco was right there leaning over him, his eyes huge. “Harry, you sorry piece of shit, you better not let them take your magic!”
Draco swallowed heavily, shared a look with Potter who looked just as uncomfortable as he did. These beings—these aliens who were trying so hard to eradicate an entire branch of their human race—had once been at ease with the Queen and her family. They had once spoken to them regularly, taught them and trained them and guided them. They had once been the people showing the Atlanteans how to thrive and advance their civilisation.
Harry’s heart leapt. “I can do slow.”
Harry felt a flare of jealousy. So he
. It had a photo of a patch of brown and crumpled wild daffodils.
By the end of the night, even Harry had learned the lyrics, and he was tipsy enough to sing along:
There were seven operations in Alchemy, and they’d completed six of them.
“Mate, are you… are you okay?” Harry asked after a long, strange pause.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” asked Padma, eyebrow raised. “We have a business to run, Draco. We can’t just dally in the MUS forever trying to find some weird Slytherin balance.”
“Wicked!” said Teddy.
“You believed me,” Harry said.
, Harry amends. Druella reads the words and then stares at him some more.
Teddy jumped. Dawlish eyed him beadily for a moment and then returned his attention to Harry and Draco. “Every time I turn around it’s blasted Bring Your Kid to Work Day,” he muttered. Then, “Got an assignment for you two. Get to my office.”
“Sev, stop,” Malfoy said, bored.
easy to find.”
touch was doing that.
This stopped Draco right in his tracks. “What about Weasley?”
Have they wasted all these years? Harry honestly doesn’t know. He never has. Even when they were still young enough to fix things, he hadn’t known. He wonders if it’s really a waste if this was the only way he could’ve had his husband.
Then, to Draco’s great surprise and discomfort, the Queen spoke a few words in a strange language, a language unlike anything Draco had ever heard—a language the Translation Charm didn’t even bother to attempt translating—and reached out to take the alien’s hand. Sostrate closed her eyes.
“You are
“He has, love,” said Astoria. “We’re divorced.”
And he had to give a little speech first. To soften the blow. He imagined Ron sitting at home in front of the magicbox, wearing only his pants and Rosie’s spit up in his hair, Rosie passed out against his chest, a beer in his free hand. Fuck, Harry would love that. He’d love to have a family of his own.
Mrs Weasley’s voice came drifting out. “Is that Harry, Ron? Let the boy in! He needs to eat!”
“She’ll say yes,” said Anthony. He was reading a book on forgotten princesses of Sub Saharan Africa. His interests had, obviously, expanded beyond Eastern Europe.
This made Malfoy pause, and it was a moment before Harry realised what he’d said, and his face burned. Malfoy looked Harry up and down, like he was a racehorse he was considering purchasing. He smirked, and it wasn’t a nice, amused one like Hermione’s.
. You may not choose people or family.”
Harry grimaced. “They’ve probably put a moratorium charm on international Portkeys.” He remembered them from the six months of Auror training he’d sat through before realising he had no interest in being an Auror. “They’re all blocked.”
“Harry just give it to him. You
learn it,” Harry insisted. “You have to know how to do the math in order to use a calculator. It just helps you get the right number. Muggles use them for quick math, or when doing very large equations, where the potential for human error is high.”
“Already done,” said Harry. “Confirmed and in writing.”
Harry’s face went hot. He looked to Draco for help, but Draco only gave him an annoyed look. “...Yes.”
Now he’s got fuck-all. He can’t make
The door opened, startling them both. Scorpius and Albus trouped in, suspiciously covered in mud. Potter’s eyes were immediately narrowed.
“By all means,” Harry said.
“If I may,” said Narcissa, speaking up for the first time. “The American branch of our family works in politics. Draco, I really must insist that you reach out to your cousin Kyle.”
The Queen brought them into the same meeting room as before, only this time Draco’s heart had settled its beat enough for him to see it wasn’t just a meeting room. It was a war room. The walls beyond the room dividers were covered in maps of the ancient world—maps that were startlingly accurate, maps that showed the exact shoreline of Antarctica—
Hindsight being twenty-twenty, Harry knew now what he’d been scared of. Not of awkward questions from his godson, certainly. But from the possibility that Teddy walking in on them could ruin the fragile thing they might have just begun. He’d been desperate to keep Draco. And in doing so, he’d thrown him away.
The sound of running water came as they travelled deeper into the caves. It was a low whoosh by the time Galene brought them to the Queen.
“Of course it is,” Snape muttered.
Harry swallowed hard. “You would’ve?”
“You never said,” Draco murmured.
Despite not intending to remove any clothing or needing privacy, he was put into a dressing room with mirrors on all sides, a footstool to stand on, and hooks on the door. “I’ll take your cloak and hang it for you,” Coddler said. “Is there a style you like? Any particular enchantments you’re looking for?”
Harry bit his lip. “You’ve still got that gneiss stone you picked up when we went out to the forest?” he asked.
Harry finally nodded, “Yeah, sounds great.”
“That I need to take the antidote right now,” said Harry, already moving towards the door. He’d find Miguela, and she’d give him the antidote, and then he could have his bollocks back.
The first morning of NEWTs came, and Harry felt invincible for the twenty minutes it took for him to stumble out of bed and into a set of robes, then make it down the stairs for breakfast. Then he saw the examiners’ rigid faces at the head table, and felt disinclined to finish his breakfast.
Katie nodded, still staring at the dying field of clover just west of Dublin. “When I’m a seventh year, I hope I’m re-sorted into Gryffindor like you.”
“You are now, bucko,” said Harry, clapping him on the back with one hand while he toasted him with the beer in the other.
Men with well-developed

“Rosie’s plenty qualified to be a bloody

“I was thinking that maybe we should try this thing without the breaks in between the shagging. I thought you were thinking the same thing, but then you didn’t come home last night, and…Was I wrong?”
He’d died already, and it wasn’t so bad. Just boring. A lot like life would be if it never ended, he supposed. Same old train station, same old emptiness. He thought of the lost spirits in the woods that his crow-self watched, and hoped to Merlin that he was never like that, eternal and
Petunia pursed her lips. “Thank you. I keep telling my neighbours that it’s just dedication and good fertiliser. They don’t ever believe me, but it’s not like I...like I
Draco pushed himself up. “You’re joking.”
“That’s Chelsea for you,” Dudley groused, then nearly flew out of his seat when Man U made an attempt on goal and missed by a foot. Chelsea responded with some unsportsmanlike behaviour, no surprise.
“I suppose,” said Ron, thoughtfully. “But if they know about us, they’ll know we’re hiding. And they might start looking more closely when we make mistakes out in Muggle places.”
“These beers are shit, by the way,” Ron added. Rosie gave him a narrow-eyed look and he quickly amended, “Not great, I mean.”
He busies himself by working on the case, even though Draco says he’ll take care of it. He can’t stay still and fortunately, Ron and Hermione are usually willing to humour him.
and then our children die when they eat the fish.”
“Not gay,” Anthony said, returning to his book. “I just know how these things tend to go. Perhaps I’d be more interested if Hermione Granger had also been sorted Hufflepuff. Legs for miles on that one...”
“Not entirely,” Harry said. “I was going to tell her it’s ICW task force business.”
Draco cleared his throat. Harry turned to to find him holding out a pair of top quality glass goggles.
article on Draco. There’s a lot of quoting and commentary from Witches On the Street who have opinions on Draco leaving the country forever. Harry has some quotes and commentary for them, too, but he can’t speak right now. With any luck, they’ll get the potion combo right before he checks out tomorrow and he’ll be able to properly yell at all these people who never knew Draco like he does.
“Why Atlantis has reappeared after—what is the current year?” Queen Sostrate asked, directing her question at Potter. Of course.
“Apparently so,” Harry agreed.
in a fucking heart on her work notes.”
Hermione’s smile stays firm. “Yes, I thought perhaps devoted time with Ron could help to strengthen our bond while the distance from… Draco… would weaken that one.”
at the gambling he did.
Their dorm was otherwise empty, Neville and Anthony apparently having had places to be.
Harry thought as he pulled fresh clothes from his trunk.
“The Quidditch starts again next month.”
They took the lift up to Jones’ office and this time, she was waiting for them. Her assistant, Jackson, a very tan blonde in her late twenties who very much preferred the diminutive ‘Jackie,’ ushered them all in and conjured identical metal and navy cotton-upholstered chairs for them. She in turn conjured herself a navy and white striped chair with significantly more cushioning, pulled her laptop from what was apparently a bottomless blazer pocket, and sat ready to note-take.
Draco’s eyes widened but the Queen didn’t seem to know the word to be offended by it.
He scowls. “You’re not,” he tries to say, but it comes out too weak and breathy to be understood. He takes a deep breath and tries again, pushing as much air into each syllable as he can, stressing all the consonants he’s always been too lazy to bother with, in an effort to speak clearly. “You’re not a healing Auror,” he manages to get out, the words slow and flat.
must you always tell secrets?”
Harry blinked. What did that have to do with anything?
cock.”
“So as for the Snitches. The free Snitch went to Socorro because I really liked his sand sculpture. I’ve got three left.” He gave the next one to Malfoy because—well, Malfoy. Then the third one went to Hermione because—well, Hermione. His final choice came down to Zeph, Titus, and Dune. Zeph was right out since Harry was pretty sure he remembered him snogging another man at the parade. Titus or Dune? Harry liked them both, really. Dune had those lovely freckles and Titus loved London like Harry did. In the end, he gave the Snitch to Titus because Dune’s fairytale sandcastle made him uncomfortable. He didn’t want to be anyone’s hero anymore.
They were, by now, pretty excellent event planners if Harry did say so himself.
Harry contemplated this for only a moment before nodding. “Okay, champ. We’ll do it shortly.”
This was news to Harry. He swallowed. “I guess it’s a good thing Voldemort never saw your tapestry, huh? He probably would have figured you and your Mum out.”
“What? It’s a nice name. If I had a daughter, that’s what I’d name her. After my godfather.”
But would they? Would Queen Sostrate convince Muggle emissaries and heads of state to release that information, for the good of the public?
Ronnie tugs on her lead again, and they continue their walk. By the time they get home again, it’s well after two, and Harry’s got to be back in at seven. His show is tomorrow. It’s probably not the most practical time to court a Veela, but Harry’s never been one for doing what’s easy.
“Oh? You know where she works?” Harry asked, cackling.
“Limoncello Leviosa, Mr Potter?” she asked. “It’s my speciality.”
Although it would’ve been great if it had been.
“Nothing unusual?” Mitchell presses.
The camera people and reporters aimed their devices at the ritual grid, talking rapidly into their microphones as they narrated the scene.
Andromeda made them all wait before digging in so she could get out her (Muggle) digital camera and take a few lifestyle photos for tomorrow’s post. They smiled up at her, and were soon allowed to actually eat, with Andromeda snapping a few action shots of Teddy spooning casserole to his new dragon, and all of them laughing when Narcissa regaled them with tales of the Countess disciplining her heritage Aegean Abraxan with threats of volunteer work at a petting zoo.
Harry stripped down and tried the taps. Hot water shot out with even better water pressure than he’d had at home. Relieved, he stepped into the shower and just stood there, letting the heat of stolen water wash away the bay’s funkiness and Draco’s near-death.
“Anything for someone who can’t live without my friendship,” said Harry.
Hermione asked many and varied questions of their museum guide, and offered many strong opinions on the concept of hysteria. Harry rather thought that lately he had a case of hysteria himself, and suspected that a mind-blowing orgasm would indeed cure it. None of these piddly little vibrators would be enough for him, but in the Good Vibrations shop…well, Harry couldn’t wait to have a looksee in there.
There were press outside Petunia’s house in Solihull, but not as many as Harry would’ve expected. Once again in their Malfoy-provided Glamours, they cased the place posing as gawkers before retreating to a hidden alley. The alien was floating, Disillusioned and tethered, behind Millicent.
“Did they say anything at all about their experiences—?” Harry asked. “Any clues we could use?’
“I thought you were going to send me home,” she whispered, though they were both wearing magical microphones and couldn’t escape being recorded.
“How’d she take it?”
“She’s speaking to many people from many countries every day,” Severus said. “I believe she will be willing to overlook one representative’s outburst in favour of getting yours…and Potter’s support.”
“I want
“It’s a Muggle thing,” Malfoy surmised. “Something people who’ve lived with Muggles know about. It can’t be worse than our whole society burning at the stake.
Potter and Weasley both sat back down heavily.
“I shan’t!”
. A fucking
“Of Gryffindors,” Draco added under his breath. Harry scowled at him.
Harry nodded thoughtfully. “Mhm, but the monuments are nice. The pointy one, anyway. I guess I haven’t seen any of the others.”
the whole sodding world. The others filled in around the edges without any efforts at all toward strategy. Most of the British Ministry officials did make an effort to get seats near the Queen, but had not acted quickly enough to be successful, and were stuck standing midway down the table next to the German Mugwump’s executive assistant, the sole representative for the ICW itself.
“It may not just be pollution,” Harry said. “If their waters are hypoxic, then that’s going to be a lot harder to fix than just trawling the bay for floating rubbish.”
he wanted to scream.
“What signs?” Harry exploded. “
“What is it?”
“Definitely,” said Harry, who wished he hadn’t. “I came to find you about it, actually.”
“Then bring yours here. Put them together. Wouldn’t that just make it stronger?”
“It’s his grandmother who’s in Beirut,” Hermione says then. “His mother’s mum. Druella. She was a Rosier.”
“You’re looking refreshed.”
“You didn’t say you were a morning person,” Harry said.
Not hardly.
– maybe should be used in nutrient potions since it sounds like it tastes good at least?
“Do you like London much?” asked Finian. “I hardly go there.”
“Heat can remove inclusions,” Draco said. “If we heat it again, it might destroy the cloudy parts.
Very obviously dismissed, the delegation began to awkwardly stir. No one wanted to be the first to rise, nor the last. But the Queen had stood and removed to a corner to speak once more with her Council, and it was inadvisable to remain seated while a Queen stood. Draco stood, bowed to the Queen even though she wasn’t even bothering to look at them, and made for the door, his heart at the bottom of his stomach.
“My parents remember me, Mrs Weasley!” Hermione said, beaming, and not at all bothered by the chastisement. Mrs Weasley’s face crumpled, and she held out her arms for Hermione.
they were in a relationship at the time, and he had been away fighting the Muggles for twelve months, this caused a stir. There was a terrible row, and as Helga was under the effects of great hormonal changes and never one to suffer Gryffindor for too long anyway, she flung him from the den and cursed the entrance against anyone not sorted Hufflepuff.”

Theo repeated the words and the ceremony was complete. Goblins trailed into the conference room with silver platters of meaty hors d'oeuvres and goblin-made wine. These turned out to be extremely popular with the guests, especially Parvati’s twin sons, Kush and Kareem. She’d married a minor Kilgore who she’d met at a Divinations conference in Brussels, and according to Hermione, they were very happy and had even predicted the birth of their sons. Amazing.
A few days late, sorry!
“Potter,” Malfoy said one night. He was lying on Neville’s bed, hands braced behind his head as he stared up at the navy blue canopy.
Eventually, the whiz-bangs tapered off. The sky echoed with their absence. It seemed to Harry that the Hufflepuffs released a collective breath, as if they were trying to fill the void themselves.
“Probably not,” Dennis admitted. Then, “How do you feel about being down to just seven men and one woman vying for your heart, Harry? Do you feel as though your chances for love are dwindling with each elimination, or is it freeing to know that you’re that much closer to true and undying love?”
“But what was it?” he asked.
He felt her head shake against his chest. “No. No, that’s what’s so awful. I just saw myself as a Master Arithmancer with a book deal. And I had a, a
There was a chorus of yesses. Harry felt extremely discomfited. Malfoy caught his eye, smirking. He dropped his towel and Harry gaped. He was
and Snape was
Murdoch opened his mouth to reply, but a knock came on his door and his secretary stuck her head in. “I’m sorry Minister, but this just came in. I think you’ll want to see it right away.”
“I didn’t know until that day in the forest, but I can see them now, even when I’m human. They were all over the forest, and all over you. You had runespoors around your neck and dead thestrals nuzzling your hands. They were so attracted to you. And I know why now—because you balanced the magic. They were wholly dead, and you were wholly alive, and when they were near you, everything balanced. That beetle, it crawled over the gneiss, trying to get closer to you, and you noticed it as soon as it did. I thought at first that they were going to hurt you, and I didn’t want to scare you, so I got you away and didn’t say anything. But they weren’t going to hurt you. They helped, if anything. The beetle took everything deathly about you into itself so that you’d be better able to balance it, and it did the same to that gneiss. It was purified, and that’s why it was capable of being transformed into the Stone.”
“Pick her up some rhodiola from the chemist,” Harry suggested, thinking it was a very good idea for himself as well. “I know Muggles carry it.”
, and it’s about Harry doing something silly and not about one of them falling down a flight of stairs and breaking his neck.
“Smitticks,” Lee corrected gently.
Harry stared at him. “You’re giving Teddy all this?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Of course they don’t.” He tried to tug himself away again, but Draco held fast, and was nearly to the bottom of Harry’s shirt by now anyway. He waited, defeated, as Draco undid the last button, and stepped back to let the shirt fall away.
talk about last night. We will go back to how things were last week, when neither of us had taken leave of our senses.”
Hermione took a deep breath, and then her face broke out in a grin. “It worked! Millicent figured it out! They’re
to everyone. It means ‘Hello, Honoured Sir’. Well, I said,
Draco dumps another set of files on the table, including three black ones, the highest clearance level in the Ministry. Neither of them ever got it in London. Draco’s only been in Beirut for two-and-a-half months and he’s already got it. He sinks down onto the couch next to Harry and glares at the files, as if their mere existence is an affront.
. How did—
,” Fleur said.
A really ugly, extremely hairy, terrifying looking caterpillar that would probably give Harry nightmares like back in fifth year. It was, in fact, the same sort of caterpillar Hermione’d collected in her jar at the rock.
She sighed happily. “Imagine what a whole hour would be like.”
By evening, Neville was a nervous wreck and Harry was quiet, his thoughts turned back on the night of the autumn equinox, three months ago, when Eloise Midgen had believed in him enough to put him forward as an initiate for the Order of the Golden Cup. Tonight they would ask him if he wanted to become a full member. They still had two hours to wait, and their dorm room was heavy with anticipation.
“So pleased to be working with you, Harry!” Dennis said. “Luna’s a great producer. We’re going to have so much fun!”
, Harry thought fiercely, and both hoped and dreaded that Draco could read the words on his face.
The thing about Ron’s predictions, though, is that he’s got no idea he’s making them. He thinks it’s all a great laugh until three months later when it turns out you really were chased by a Grim in third year… or betrayed by your own friend, who happened to be him…or his wife gets bonded to someone he still—non-ironically—refers to as twatface.
“But we can’t just spend a month on research,” said Lee. He’d muted the telly, though Juve still played on the screen, stealing his and Blaise’s focus every few moments. “They’re dying down there. We need to get started on fixing it
Draco exhaled in a rush. When he looked at Harry, Harry could have sworn that there was something more in the intensity of his gaze. Something deep and meant only for him, but then he blinked and shook himself to dispel it. It was the same look Draco always gave him when they were alone, and it probably meant he was just being too sappy for Draco’s evil sensibilities.
They landed on another island, amid beautiful, broken ruins. Luna set about explaining the game to everyone, although Hermione seemed more interested in making sketchings of some old engravings on a nearby stone. Harry narrowed his eyes. She could at least make an
Draco glanced at Potter, shrugged. He had no idea.
“Is Malfoy down there? His cousin’s here! Man’s got a beard!”
“Stay with me tonight,” Harry blurted. Malfoy’s shocked silence elongated and Harry swallowed. “You’ll be nearer to Scorpius.”
Albus’s opinion of the situation immediately flipped, and not for the first time, Harry regretted his Muggle cousin moving into a magical community. Gin and Luna lived in Hogsmeade, too, but they certainly didn’t let Albus into Honeydukes as much as Dudley sneaked him treats from there.
your inspiration, actually?”
“I meant, I could help you with something, too.”
When the sun finally started setting, Harry knew the students would soon arrive. The train was set to the astronomical clock and always managed to get them to Hogsmeade Station at the stroke of nautical twilight.
Hermione was, of course, already waiting by the time Harry arrived at the Charms wing. Her hair fluttered behind her, almost like an afterthought, as she paced back and forth.
“The hell you are!” Weasley and her parents said at once.
Harry nodded. “So—boil and condense, again and again.”
“It was so loud!” Avani Prance said.
Draco’s breathing deepened, and it was another fifteen minutes before Harry realised he’d fallen asleep. In Harry’s bed. Somehow, Harry knew that was not something Malfoys did. He should wake him up, let him go back to his own room so they could pretend like it hadn’t happened. Like Draco would probably want.
The audience roars. It’s the loudest he’s ever heard them. For a moment, he’s confused. What the hell are they so excited about? But he loves this collection, too.
“No matter how hard it tries, it can’t be normal without that heir, because it’s unstable. And it just keeps getting worse. First, one of the other heirs hates the family, and decides, since the other heir left, it can, too. The family’s only got three heirs left, so one tries restabilising the family, and it marries into another good pureblood family, and for a little while, the family is sort of stable again, held together by the new family. But it can’t last, and then another one of the heirs gets addicted to dark magic, and goes mad. And then another one resents what’s happened to its family and does something crazy to fix it, but it ends up getting it killed. There’s nothing left but the heir who married out, but now the family is so unstable, that the last heir has to renounce it all together, and become only this new element it married into, or else it’ll go mad from the instability too.”
,” Draco interrupted, dragging the word out in the most uncharacteristically exaggerated display of being impressed Harry had ever seen from him (and he’d seen Draco interview a lot of annoying arseholes that he’d had to be nice to).
“We’d better, or I’ll be having nightmares about Merkids getting eaten alive for the rest of my life,” Malfoy muttered.
“Can me and Scorpius go down to the Quidditch pitch and watch the Hufflepuff practice? We’ll take Ms Danger.”
“Er,” said Potter, blinking. “I don’t—”
Were there more UFO sightings now than before? Had that sighting in London
Harry breathed a laugh, turned his head to face Draco. Their noses brushed, and the brief connection sent a rush of want right through Harry. He couldn’t help himself. He pushed himself up and swung a leg over Draco’s thighs to straddle him.
“Excuse me, Minister,” Harry said, “but what part is the serious part?”
It’s not the Aurors, but in the seven years since Harry has become an Unspeakable, after two years of training and initiation, he has become obsessed with his work. He’s thirty-three. This is his life now. The thought of ending it, even for Draco, makes his heart hurt.
“No, she was really into a conversation with Luna about tombstone rubbings and spirits being trapped in art.”
“Something I was forcefully reminded of last time I minded her. She and Albus ended up subscribing to a year of
“Harry Potter,” she says, more to Malfoy than to Harry. “In
She shrugged one shoulder, unrepentant, and they pressed their lips tightly together as they passed a glaring portrait of the Lady of the Lake. And then another, and by the time they’d cleared the gallery, he was pretty sure they were both back to wishing Ron was with them, even though they both knew he was better off with the Aurors.
“Have you told Rosie yet?”
Just then, Ms Williams came up and asked him if they’d have time to stop at Snog to get a frozen yoghurt before returning to school. As if this was a joy outing and not a valuable learning experience.
“Couldn’t stop thinking about you all fucking night,” Harry growled.
Harry tipped his head, directing Draco’s attention to where Professor Sprout was gently Ennervating Fayth Walliams. “Sprout found us,” he said. “We probably would’ve slept right through it if she hadn’t."
“Really?” said Harry. “You wanna switch? I like the cassava thing.”
“That’s true,” said Sally. “And the same with Muggles. They have other options, but getting those other options going is really expensive, and there’s a lot of money changing hands and backroom deals with the politicians and the businessmen who own the polluting machines whose sole purposes are to ensure the better options, the Lumos-alternatives, don’t happen.”
But… he would bet that other people in the school could, and that if he helped them even a little, they could figure this mess out. This wasn’t his battle to lead, but it was another war he intended to fight anyway.
“Right,” he said, nodding. “But how can I be both my own greatest fear and heart’s desire?”
“Christ,” Harry muttered, shaking his head. What Slytherin parenting.
The original Hufflepuffs got a bonfire going on these nights, and they would all sit around it, learning the history and lore of Hufflepuff house, drinking butterbeer, and roasting apples over the fire. Since the word about Herbology class got out, there was a marked dullness hanging over the school, but Hufflepuff was Harry’s refuge. When Hermione’s anxiety and Ron’s low-burning anger got to be too much for him, he could retreat to Hufflepuff and he’d find people who knew the risks and kept working, kept optimistic, anyway. That was why these Wednesday meetings were so valuable to him.
American, unfortunately.”
“What do you mean?” he asked.
“He’s serious,” said Malfoy, his voice strained. “There was…some kind of blood. The Demiguise mutt attacked it and scared it off. Potter was covered in this sour, stinking, black blood. Theo and Fleur Delacour-Weasley are testing it now.”
They had a place to start. Draco refused to think of how it would end with the loss of his own magic.
“We create our own reality,” Harry whispers back.
“Of course you do, Draco,” Snape snapped. “Of fucking course. How might I abandon the very interesting manuscript on Panacea I was reading to assist you?”
This, understandably, caused a stir amongst those assembled. Dudley smiled blandly, directing his gaze to no one in particular, and generally looked as if he could punch any one of them and knock them out cold without even standing from the table. The murmuring died down after an extended, wasted minute. Draco studied his nails.
Draco pulled himself up into a sitting position, belatedly realising he, too, had an erection. He flushed, pulled the sheets back over his lap, but Potter had already seen. He was smirking.
Miguela, cool and collected, thanked the staff for their welcomes, and offered nods to both him and Draco. Harry relaxed some. At least he wouldn’t be subjected to someone who hated him—Snape could handle that for everyone.
After an eternity, or at least if felt thus, the last fire died. Their spell trailed off, echoing over the vale. The Muggle sirens were louder now, nearly upon them. They didn’t need to approach to know their spell had worked. Even from this distance, they could see it: the mound of freshly turned dirt where once a mountain of hazardous waste had been. Harry dropped his ventilation mask and breathed in. The air was clean.
Potter took a step forward, his hand on her arm.
The fire flared and he asked the kitchen elves for a bit of whatever was leftover from the feast, then crossed to the old credenza that had been left in his rooms by the previous occupant, and fortuitously also left fully stocked with liquor.
Hermione teased him relentlessly when he rushed in late for meals, his hair still curling at the nape from brewing steam, his mouth unable to frown. He’d never realised what a high it was to create something, to feel magic seeping out of his skin and into something, to make something meaningful, even if it was just a mistake.
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Are you okay, Potter? You look battier than usual.”
Draco looked at him like he was mad. He probably was. “What beetle?”
need with it? I’ve got dozens of times that just sitting in Gringotts gathering dust.”
“Holy shit!” Kilgore yelled, and by then, the entire park was a screaming, running mess of Muggles.
A moment later, Snape appeared in the frame.
the type to be anxious.
“Fake news reporting is regarded as slightly more uncultured in the Muggle world than here. They aren’t keen to publish something that turns out to not be true and risk looking like the
Harry closed his eyes as he thought, trying to recall everything he’d ever read and absorbed about potions making. In his head images flew by; every reaction he’d ever read about or experienced with both distilled water and aqua fortis. Then he went through all the ingredients Snape listed, and tried to remember how they reacted with one another and the two bases.
Harry shrugs. “I have never expected
“When would you say is good timing for a continent to reappear, Mill?” Malfoy asked, with a minuscule degree of sincerity.
“Experts in Mind Magics didn’t think it was safe, but the ICW used it anyway.”
“Cornwall,” he said. “It’ll be a bit warmer here.”
“I don’t judge,” Luna said. She came around and handed Harry a travel brochure that said
“Just need something in my arse,” Harry said, gasping as Malfoy began to move. “I’ve never been fucked before.”
, which purified the water it sourced from local taps, watersheds, rivers, or whatever else was nearby.
Ron shrugged. They walked passed a haberdasher, and he said, “A knitting pattern?”
“Then we’ll fix these waters for you,” Harry said. “But you have to stop the attacks.”
The portrait creaked as it closed behind her. Then it was just the twelve of them, alone in the common room together, as if they’d never been in four different houses—or, in Harry and Malfoy’s case, never tried to both kill
He nodded, but he didn’t really understand the point of it. So they were in on an internet joke now. So what?
“We’d surely notice, right?” Harry’s voice came out an octave higher than normal. “Or Muggles would, anyway, since they apparently like them better.”
“Hey, Uncle D,” Albus chirped, sliding inside.
Malfoy’s eyes cut to him and then away again. Ginny was flying beautifully, her passes flawless and strong. She passed the Quaffle to Alick Macmillan and he scored. They high-fived, their cheers tinny and softened by distance. Down below, they could hear Ernie cheering for them. “Do you really think I’m honest with myself?”
“Yes.  I want to know.  If I’ve been lied to…I want to know.  I know you want to keep me safe, but telling the truth is more important.” Harry said firmly.  Draco looked at him doubtfully, but he insisted, “It
Some time later, quite some time, if his wrinkled fingertips were any indication, he looked up to see Harry standing quietly at the counter beside him.  He was very still, and was watching as Draco cleaned the cup, over and over.  Embarrassed by the audience to his ritual, Draco put the cup down.  “Sorry,” he said, “got a little carried away.”
As Draco walked to where his Mother sat, he heard his Father say, “You know, you have the look of a Black about you.”
“I don’t know,” Hermione says doubtfully.  “I can’t imagine how…” she breaks off and looks away, biting her lip, and again, I have no idea why this is so important to them both.
“I’d like to see Malcolm, please.”  It wasn’t a request.
“Yes, indeed.  My Apprentice Master in France, unfortunately, died suddenly, and Garrick was kind enough to allow me to complete my studies with him.  I worked here in the shop until he also passed on, and then I took it on.”
“Yes, fine, thanks Narcissa,” Harry said, working hard to muster a smile in return.
“What’s that demon creature saying?” Hermione asks with a half-hearted glare.
“Nymphadora’s child?”
“Really?”  He looks gobsmacked.
“Yeah, sure.  Oh, and I suppose it needs to be said, I’m sorry for trying to grass you up to the Dark Lord.”
Hermione comes through in eight minutes, not ten, and Rose is thrilled to be introduced to Violet.  The two of them scamper off, Kreacher slinking after them, secretly delighted, but acting as though he’s shouldering an enormous burden.
“Oh,” I say, feeling a bit awkward.  “Does Violet’s dad not help out?”
“Potter, you’re ruining my afterglow.”
“Um, well, there’s the whole memory loss thing,” I say, unsure where she’s going with this.
“Hi Scorp,” Harry said.  “You’re excited for Cass’ big day?”
He sighs.  “So I didn’t.  I was in a pretty bad place.  Most days, it was an accomplishment to just get out of bed.  Ron and Hermione did their best, but they have careers, and a relationship, and it’s selfish to expect them to put it on hold for me.  So I hid as much as I could, went through the motions.  Existed.
“I know that it’s terminal, that you’re managing her pain and comfort levels.  I know that it would be…imprudent...to hope for a cure.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it.  I bet you’re furious, right now,” Harry replies calmly, stepping inside the room.
“Honestly, mate, I can’t blame you for being afraid,” Ron said reasonably.  “It’s not as though you had an easy time at the last, there.  I feel terrible about not being as supportive as I could have been back then.  I always thought that I made you leave.”
“Did he yell at you?”
“Draco,” His wide blue eyes are guileless, fixated on Draco.  “How are you?”
“So you sent me an inexplicable postcard?” Draco asked.
“I’m sorry.” Harry said quietly.
Arthur’s eyes moisten slightly.  “You’re so good,” he says finally, his voice breaking on the last word.  Harry drops the carrier bag on the ground, and allows himself to be wrapped in a hug.  He feels the shaking of Mr. Weasley’s shoulders, and clings tightly.  After a moment, Arthur composes himself, and pulls away.  “Come through,” he says.  “Molly will be delighted to see you.”
“Maybe he was just a tiny kid.  He was really small when we were growing up, and he’s not giant as an adult.”
“I couldn’t imagine touching her, and if I hadn’t produced an heir, it would ruin Pansy’s life, ruin my family's reputation.”
“Okay.  Will it help if I administer the potion?”
“Of course.  Scorpius, three more bites before you leave the table.  Alright?”
“I did.  I’m having a lady and a little girl over for dinner, and I seem to have forgotten how to cook.”
“Certainly.  Do you want tea?”
“Yeah, but he didn’t even talk to me.  He doesn’t care about me at all.  He was way more interested in picking at you.”
I’m surprised to hear him speak so plainly, and I tell him so.  He laughs.  “Just because I love her, that doesn’t mean I don’t
“We have all sorts of Muggle cocktails at home.  Every Tuesday we have a Liquor Potluck.  Everyone brings a new sort of drink, and there’s only so much you can do with fire whiskey and butterbeer.  We had to branch out.”
Harry remained silent, lacking the vocabulary to communicate his preference, which, Draco suspected was, ‘don’t have the potion and be left alone’.  “How about in your room?” Hermione suggested.  Harry considered this, and nodded resignedly.  Draco trailed after Hermione and Harry.  He didn’t want to go with them at all, but Harry kept looking back at him, as if to reassure himself that Draco was coming.
“Well, it’s not very common for people to suddenly become babies.  We wanted to give you privacy.”
“I’m very sorry, Aunt, about everything that happened to your family during the War.  I’m sorry for my role in it.”
“Do you see yourself loving him?”
“Oh!” I say.  “Yes, I suppose you should come in.”  I step back, and she gives me a thoughtful look as she steps inside.  “How are you?  How did you get out?”
A week after Harry leaves, Draco is desultorily tidying his workbench and sees the amulet that he’d made for Teddy.  He looks down at it for a long time, and then he takes a deep breath, and apparates to the address that he’s known, but been terrified for ages to visit.
Harry leapt to his feet to do as Draco said, but stopped in the doorway.  “Draco?  Will your mum be there?”
Mill looks uncomfortable.  “You spoke at his trial.  Draco and his Mother both acted against the Dark Lord, and your testimony persuaded the Wizengamot to exonerate them.”
As you might know, I’ve sorted everything out with my Mother’s estate, and it seems like it’s time to go back to Toronto.  I won’t trouble you with any further apologies.  I hope you believe that I will regret what I’ve done until I take my last breath.  I’m glad to have come home though, to have seen you, to see that you have surrounded yourself with people who care about you.  Be well, Harry.  Find someone who sees in you what I do, make a life with them.  Grab your happiness and never look back.  I wish you the very best.  If ever you need anything, please let me know.
“You seem like you are feeling upset,” Draco said, unconsciously using a phrase that Lara used all the time, when the anxiety was too great for him to speak.
else who’s suitable.  I’m not being hyperbolic when I say that our society’s stability relies on this.”
“Ooo, can I come?”
Draco quickly made tea, and handed Harry a cup.  “Is there somewhere we can go where we won’t be interrupted?”
Cass gave her a narrow look, but Harry grinned, and grabbed his daughter’s hand.  His smile faded a little as he watched Draco, Astoria and Scorpius link hands and exit the room ahead of them.  He’d been surprised when Draco had told him that he planned to attend the press conference.  They’d seen one another at St. Mungo’s, when Cass was undergoing her screening tests.  Harry had been nervous, never a big fan of hospitals, and less so, when it was his daughter lying in a hospital robe, with several healers waving wands over her.  He’d watched the proceedings intently, his eyes never straying far from Cass’ pale face.  His distraction had been a minor blessing however, since his attention
Harry replied, “We have to hide all of our magical items, because Cass goes to a Muggle school.  He’d fortunately escaped back to Hogwarts the day before.  Actually,” he looked shy and a bit vulnerable, as he pulled a small packet from his satchel and handed it over.  “I have something for you.  I was going to give it to you later, but this is as good a time as any.  You just need to unshrink it.”
I give a little wave of my hands, as though to say, ‘well, there you have it’, and she huffs.  “Harry,” she says, “until things are fixed, I really think that you need to trust us.  We’re honestly just looking out for you.”
Not sure how I could have had a godfather as smoking hot as this and
“Yeah, I guess that’s okay.”  Cass’ voice was cool, but Harry knew that she was excited.  She just wanted to punish him a little for his earlier refusal to let her worry about him.
“I can’t be here while you do that.  I have to go.”
“That didn’t happen last time!” Hermione said defensively.
Cass came into the room a bit shyly, but said, “I like to be called Cass.  It’s nice to meet you.  Dad has told me a lot about you all.”
“Potter, I had no idea-” Draco starts.  Potter interrupts him.
“You’re mental.”
“Yeah, alright, I need to do up the intake papers for Violet, any road,” Harry said agreeably.  He gathered the parchments and apparated to the Ministry.  The DMAC office was near-deserted, but he could see a light in the office beside his.  As he dropped the reports off, and gathered an intake form and a quill, he popped into the lighted office.
What happened, was that Harry stopped wobbling, and instead let his natural athleticism take over.  He wasn’t fast, and he wasn’t even graceful, but he was skating, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.  He’d seen that particular look on Harry’s face countless times before, usually high above a Quidditch pitch as he bested Draco.  And it gave him such a stab of nostalgia for the past, that he didn’t notice that he'd stopped moving.  The fact that he hadn’t taught Harry how to stop occurred to him just as Harry barrelled into him at a decent clip.  Despite his attempts to catch hold of Harry, and keep himself upright, before he knew what was happening, he found himself laying on his back in the ice, with Harry laying on top of him.
“Merlin, you don’t even realize,” Draco had said, aghast.
“Yes,” Draco says, his wry smirk revealing nothing, unless you look closely.
“What would be a better outcome than this?” I ask, gesturing at the newspapers.
“Just the part about you using her as a stick…nice imagery, by the way, and the part about choosing between your temper tantrum and your daughter.  Every time I think that she can’t delight me any more, she gets cross with you again, and proves me wrong.”
“And then she said, since I wasn’t interested in doing things the easy way, we could do things the hard way.  She plugged my nose until I had to breathe through my mouth, and poured the potion down my throat.”
She sighs, and says, “It’s the Wizarding bank, Uncle Harry.  That’s where treasures are kept.”
He went outside, after the Healer left, and shot slapshots into an empty net until his shoulders ached and the tears on his face were unrecognizable from the sweat.
“I wasn’t sure if I should.  Minerva said you were happy where you were, and we considered leaving well enough alone, but it felt too big to make the decision for you.”
“Yes,” Harry said.
that he doesn’t know what the expression means, that he wants to know everything.  He wants to hear about everything that Harry has seen and learned, and he would have happily sold his soul for Harry to have shown up like this a day ago.  He wants Harry.  It’s as simple as that.
Draco laughs, and the moment passes.  They sit companionably for a while, neither speaking, and Draco tells him about how his mum used to come and prune the roses, while Draco kept her company.
“Of course!”
“Well, it’s just interesting that the conversation travelled from Harry’s lack of affectionate touches as a child, to that of your sexuality.”
Harry gave a longing look to the window, where a bright sunny day beckoned, but said, “Oh, I don’t mind.  I can help you with potions, if you like.”
“Oh?”  Hermione was used to this.  To any listener, it would appear that he was changing the subject, but Hermione had long been his sounding board, and he relied on her.  If he was careful, he could tell her things without
Luna is one of the few people whose owls are allowed past the wards.  The following morning at breakfast, as I’m unsuccessfully trying to deposit mashed bananas into Scorpius’ mouth (he seems to have a talent for pushing them all back out, and down his front), a large package arrives.  Inside, Draco and I find a number of issues of the Quibbler, as well as some of the Prophet.  As we work our way through them in chronological order, we learn that (fucking) Wendell has been sent to Azkaban for life, and Smith for twenty years.  There’s a list of other names, ones I don’t recognize, but they’ve all been punished harshly.  Draco professes to remember some of them from school, including one by the name of Thomas, who he tells me I shared a dorm with.
“Maybe I am.”  Draco’s voice was tight, and he felt anxiety creep up into his chest from where it normally lay coiling in his belly.
“But Draco…”
“She’s frightened,” he said, a bit defensively.
“Ready for what?” Draco asks dazedly, prompting Harry to kiss him again, before he pulls away and heads to the en suite.
“Oh, do you?”  She sat on the floor next to him, somehow managing to look graceful doing so.
Later that evening, Draco stood in Scorpius’ doorway, watching his son in slumber.  His tiny rosebud mouth was wide open, and he was snoring deeply.
“Probably not, no.”
“You aren’t back to work yet, Harry?”
“What?”
He looks up, and it’s obvious that he expects Draco to make fun of him, or to say something about Teddy’s Father.  Draco doesn’t have it in him to be
“Well, that’s different.  I’d love to see you play sometime.”  Draco coloured.  Harry wanted to see him again?
“I don’t understand.”
Gradually, people drifted off to bed, and Draco blinked in surprise to see that it was just him and Harry left in the kitchen.  “I should go,” he said
Scorpius shook his head.  “What is it?” Harry asked.  “You seem kind of scared.”  He was trying to control his reactions, but alarm bells were ringing in his head.  It was just that…Harry remembered crying in a principal’s office after suddenly finding himself on the school roof.  He remembered the gut-wrenching terror of what would face him when he got home.  He remembered the stifling, endless darkness of his cupboard after doing something freakish.
“Oh,” Draco thought about it for a moment, and then decided to risk it.  “I’d do anything for you as well.”
“Cheri, it has found you!  This is your wand!”
Harry grinned, but there wasn’t any of its usual warmth.  “So we saved each other.  Pansy was grieving her future, and so was I.  We sat around and felt sorry for ourselves, and then we somehow became a family.”
“Yes, of course.  All for Harry.  And more, I suppose, if you can manage to finish that much.”
Papa smiled.  “Yes, I have two jobs.  Three, if you count being a Father, I suppose.  I’m fortunate that I can do most of my work from my office here.  Primarily, I manage the Malfoy holdings, which are a bit complicated, and take up a lot of my attention.  I’m formally trained as a cursebreaker, and so from time to time, I take on projects, either from Gringotts, or from families who have cursed objects.”
Taking a quick look at his surroundings, Harry freed the huddled trio from the enchantment.  “Hello,” he said gently, as they regained awareness.  “My name is Harry.  I’ve been asked to come and sort out what happened.”
Hermione gapes at me for a moment, before saying, “Don’t you want to know what happened to you?”
“It’s…thank you.”
fucks off, and I smile at Draco, watching him and waiting for him to speak.  He doesn’t.  He instead regards me with such confusion that the smile eventually fades from my face.  “You’re looking at me strangely,” I finally say.
“So when are you going?”
“Yeah, whatever you like, Kreacher.  Thanks for keeping me company today,” I say, and he sends a triumphant look Hermione’s way before he disappears.
Harry nodded, and Astoria said, “Very well, you can apparate from here.”
“No, that’s true, we didn’t.  I just thought that we were happy together.  I was happy.”
“I’m sorry, Cass.  Come here.”  Harry pulled the covers back, and Cass climbed in next to him.  As a toddler, Cass had woken him like this every single morning, and memories of her bright eyes, and riot of curly hair made Harry’s heart clench.
They drank in silence for a while until Harry finally waved his cup at Draco.  “Good, this”, he muttered.
“I know that you’re busy, Hermione, and I won’t keep you long.  I was just hoping that I could draw your attention to Scorpius’ application to participate in a Muggle clinical trial.  His Healer tells us that all such things need to be approved by this Department.”  He passed a file folder across the desk, and Hermione flipped it open.  She scanned the contents quickly, and bit her lip as she read.
“Why would I be upset?”
“Pardon?”  Draco felt a sudden pang of anxiety ripple through his belly.
“Good to know.  I’m sorry I don’t remember you.  According to Ron and Hermione, I like you an awful lot.”
“I don’t know what that is,” the girl replied.
“But they come around?” Mr. Powers’ voice was hopeful, wary.  “They always come around?”
“Would I have?”  Harry wondered if that were true.  “Really, Draco, what did you do?  You ended a relationship that you didn’t want to be in.  You didn’t cheat on me, I’m pretty sure, and you’d never made me any promises about what we were.  It isn’t your fault that I…” Harry wasn’t sure how that sentence ended.  Except that he
“Will you watch him?  Tomorrow?  I…I have my appointment with Lara.”
Another knock sounded through the quarters, and Neville and Luna arrived.  They were thrilled to meet Cass, and delighted to see Harry again.  Soon though, Molly and Arthur made excuses, and left, and Luna and Neville departed as well, promising to see Harry and Cass later in the week.
.  I doubt my impressive
“Least I could do,” he muttered shyly, his blush turning the tips of his ears pink.
“I’m not upset, exactly,” I reply.  “I just feel…heavy.”
“Draco,” Scorpius said firmly.  “My Papa’s name is Draco.”
“It’s a coincidence.  Your sample size is too small to make that conclusion.”
“What if we don’t want Violet to have magic?”
“Listen, you git, Harry spoke up for you during your trials.  He kept your mum out of Azkaban, and he’s the one who insisted that you be taken on as potions consultant to the Aurors.  He never asked you for a single thing in return.  He saved your life, Malfoy, and this will wipe the Life-Debt clean.”
“Where’s Lily?  I’m sure Narcissa would like to welcome her to our home!”
Too late, Draco realizes that Dennis Creevey sits to his left.  He stifles a sigh, and says, “Hullo, Dennis.”
"A friend?"
Another interesting facet to this new Harry’s personality was the unmitigated curiosity about the world around him.  Harry wanted to know
“I warned him again, but he didn’t listen.  I don’t know what he did exactly, but somehow the Wizengamot intervened, and got that bitch freed.” He nods his head in Pansy’s direction.  “I couldn’t wait any more.  I breached his wards, and took his little
I’m nearly there, so close, and by the sounds of his breath, so is he.  His movements increase in speed, until, abruptly, the room is filled with a completely unexpected sound.  There’s a baby crying.  In this room.  We both still.  It’s dark, so I can’t see his face, but he doesn’t seem surprised to hear a surprise infant, but rather, suffused with awkwardness at its timing.  “Draco?”
The elder Fortesques are clearly concerned as they sit me down at the generous back table with a pot of tea.  “Is something wrong?”
Suddenly aware of a presence at his side, he looked down to see Cass, standing quietly.  “Hello, little duck,” he said.  “Do you need something?”
“I need you to fuck me, Harry,” Draco breathed, and Harry murmured appreciatively around his cock, and tried to flip Draco onto his stomach. “No,” Draco knew his voice sounded choked.  “I want to see you.”
“Can’t I just come to say hello?”  The look on his face suggests that, no, coming to say hello is unwelcome.  “Alright, fine, I’m here because I need your help with something.”
Safe…The word triggered a half memory, as though he was viewing it through mist.  “Where am I?”
Cass looked at Draco and he shrugged.  “Astoria and Scorpius are at the Menagerie.  They’ll be ages yet.  If you want to, it’s fine with me.”  Cass nodded eagerly.
"True," she said easily.  "But I don't think that Cass did anything wrong either."
“I had noticed,” Draco drawled.  “Fine, tell Granger.  I could use her help, to be honest.  Will you be telling…” for a moment, Draco struggled to remember the name of the female Weasley, but finally it reappeared, “Ginevra?”
Draco looks at him “You aren’t eating enough.”  Harry shrugs.  “Are you sleeping?”
“Then it wasn’t meant to be,” Draco said.
When they finally finished, and Harry was sitting, dumbly trying to understand all that he’d been told, Draco said, a little tentatively, “Harry?”
“In a sense.  The best treatment available is a bone marrow transplant, but finding a donor is quite difficult.  The odds are increased significantly when a sibling donor exists, but Scorpius is an only child, and we’re grappling with the ethics of having another child, since that wasn’t part of our plans before all of this.”
Harry staggers, and Hermione clutches his arm.  Her tiny arms grip his, hard enough to hurt.  The pinch of her strong fingers keep him grounded as he sucks in a harsh breath and listens to the roaring in his ears.  “H-how?” He asks weakly.
“I understand.”  Draco swallows, his face a study in grief.  “If he is dead, I would still wish to bring him to his ancestral home, to bury him with kin.”
“Very well,” Draco sighed, trying to keep the worry out of his voice.  “But you’ll have to eat a little more at lunchtime today.”  Scorpius eyed him with the face of a child who had no intention of eating more at lunchtime, but Draco didn’t have the ability to climb that particular mountain at present.
he’d been.  Harry knew that family was important to Draco, but there’d been a part of him that had hoped that Draco would try to see it from Harry’s perspective.  Moving to Canada had been the right thing for Harry and Cass.  Harry couldn’t imagine what her life would have been like, if she’d had to grow up with the scrutiny of being Harry Potter’s daughter.  It was so much better that she had gotten a normal, stable childhood.  Was Draco unable to see that?  It was deeply frustrating, and Harry vacillated wildly between being defensively angry that Draco was being so nearsighted and being horribly guilty at having robbed the two people he loved most of a relationship.
They finally managed to retrieve Scorpius, and headed towards the floo, Draco making sure that he had Harry’s arm.  He was ungainly at this stage of his pregnancy, and Draco admitted to being a little overprotective.  It was mad, really, to be having another baby at this age, with their kids both in Hogwarts.  But Draco couldn’t find it in him to feel any apprehension.  He was enjoying seeing Harry pregnant, and looking forward to getting to know the newest Potter-Malfoy from the moment he was born.
“Listen, don’t worry about me.  I’m glad that you’ve told me what you want.  I can’t necessarily stay here forever, I have a business and our house will need a little attention as well.  But we don’t always have to be in the same place.  You could stay longer, if you wanted.”  Harry was proud that his voice remained even while he said this.
“The timing isn’t great, but I figured you’d rather see, mate.”  He reaches into the pocket of his robes, and pulls out a shrunken newspaper, which he returns to normal size and passes to me.
"And I'm not like that anymore?" I ask curiously.  It's an interesting thought.
“Who do you think you are?”
creepy, Draco decided.
“She doesn’t have one.”  This prompted a few murmurs, and Harry steeled himself for what would happen next.
As the night progressed, more people arrived.  The group at the kitchen island finally figured out that the blender needed to be plugged in to work, but didn’t realize that the pitcher needed a lid.  The ensuing shower of sticky orange drink covered the kitchen and its occupants.  Everyone was in hysterics.  Pansy was draped around Seamus and Dean, tears rolling down her cheeks as Dean licked a stripe of orange from her forehead.  This unexpected group had an easy-going manner about them, reminding Draco of the after-game parties that had formed with his team.  He felt simultaneously excluded and homesick for the Wolves.  Although, in fairness, during the off-season, there weren’t many Wolves to find, as most of them had summer jobs that required their attention.  Minor hockey paid pitifully, and the landscaping and golf course jobs kept them afloat during the season.  Draco himself was a coach, coaxing tiny little helmet-clad toddlers to shakily make their way across the ice, and running drills with future minor leaguers who would someday take his place on his team.
Harry
“Hi Cass,” he answered.  In another life, they would be hugging, speaking a mile a minute to catch one another up on what had happened since the last time they spoke, but now they were polite.  Draco burned with shame.  He had caused this.  No, he amended.  He hadn’t caused this, but he’d blindly told himself that everything was fine, and Harry had been hurting all along.
“I can’t make this decision right now, Draco.  I need to think about it.”
“Harry, there's nothing to thank me for.  I should be thanking you, for saving my son's life.  It’s hard, when your child is in the hospital.  And it’s especially hard the first time your child is experiencing treatment.  You did fine.”
Hermione suddenly dropped her fork.  Her eyes grew wide for a split second, before she said, “Would you excuse me for a moment?”  She raced away from the table and Draco stared after her.  She was back within minutes, but her cheeks were pink with colour, and her forehead was wrinkled, as though she was thinking hard.
Much had changed since that day.  Draco had focused on taking care of Cass.  They flew a lot, and played chess, and the two of them had become a fixture within Diagon Alley, spending hours poring over books in Flourish and Blotts, and animatedly discussing Quidditch over ice cream at Fortesque’s.  If Draco hadn’t already been entranced by this child, the time spent together had finished the job.  She was so like Harry, loving wholeheartedly, and when her eyes lit up with passion over whatever subject had recently captured her interest, it was almost an embodiment of her Dad.  But, Draco saw many of his own traits in the little girl.  She had an innate ability to read a situation, and turn it to her advantage.  She was quick-witted, and her dry sense of humour delighted Draco.
“Gross.  You’re proving my point”
With the morning comes resignation, of a sort.  Draco grieves the end of his family’s bloodline with dignity (which really just means that he doesn't discuss it at all), and has turned his mind toward the practical.  “It’s not as though the Malfoy name is anything to be proud of anymore, and he could do a blood adoption if he really wanted to,” he reflects over his breakfast toast.  Scorpius seems unharmed, aside from the sterilization.  He sits opposite me at the table and seems delighted with the world, as a house elf feeds him disgusting-looking cereal and he grabs everything that comes into his reach.
“Alright then.  Was it only your staggering lack of filter at the dinner table that has you so upset?”
“Is that what that means?” Harry asked.
“You’re welcome, little witch,” he answered, patting her on the shoulder.  In the back yard, the Magical Reversal squad had reverted the lizard into a little girl, and the Obliviators were just sending the last family on their way.
“You had what amounts to an unmedicated major surgery?”  Draco put his head in his hands.  Harry must have been terrified, and he’d been all alone.  Looking back on it later, Draco thought that this was the moment when he let go of any lingering bitterness about Harry’s decisions.
“It wasn’t without its cost,” McGonagall remarks.
“Have you talked?”
“A curse, you say!  How interesting,” George prods, and his impish wink makes me decide to play along.
Minerva and Severus exchanged another one of those cryptic looks they were so good at.  Harry wanted no comments from either of them, so he continued, “And, most importantly of all, we need to be sensitive to the people who remained here after I left.  People who knew me, and were fond of me.  Ron and Hermione.  Neville.  Luna.  The Weasleys.”
Harry felt as though his eyes had been glued shut.  He struggled to open them, but was assailed by such brightness that he slammed them shut again.
Harry felt his stomach roil a little.  “You do?”
I’m suddenly exhausted, and so I forcibly pull him until he’s laying in the crook of my arm, his head on my chest.  I stroke his silky hair until I drift off to sleep.
“I understand.  Draco, you don’t need to say anything, I underst-”
The boy gasped.  “Yes!  How do you know me?  I know your name because I have a storybook about you.”
I realize that I’m gaping at him, with what is, undoubtedly, a vapid look on my face.  “It’s common?” I finally ask.  “To transact a marriage, and have a child who solely exist to further the family name?”
Even though he’s cold, he decides to sit for a minute longer, listening to the sounds of the night, and watching the stars twinkle.  His introspection is cut short when someone sits next to him.  It’s Draco.  “Well done,” he says, recasting the warming spell.  As a blanket of heat envelops Harry, he sighs.
, Granger.  There’s nothing I wouldn’t do.”
Draco looks at her.  “They knew that if certain people got wind that they were targeting people who had committed, at most, misdemeanour crimes, while underage, that the backlash would be enormous.  Do you really think that if you, or Harry, or any other Gryffindor had gotten wind of this, that you’d simply let it happen?”
Her smile grew more feline.  “Oh really?  What did you blame me for?”
“Oh, is that your girlfriend?”
It was only after the incident with the garden hose that Harry realized that he needed to set wards to keep Gimple within the boundaries of Number Twelve.   He considered the matter settled, and had been relieved that a spray of water had been the worst that had happened, since Kreacher would be inconsolable if something more serious happened to his friend.  He ought to have known, he realized, sitting down to eat his dinner.  Kreacher held a grudge like no other living being.
Minerva patted the seat next to her, but Harry shook his head a little.  He gathered his legs onto the armchair and wrapped his arms around them, resting his chin on his knee.
“If I’ve learned one thing from Harry, it’s that you can plan all you like, but things will probably go tits up and then you have to wing it.”
He looked into Harry’s eyes, and, although Harry's eyes communicated his disappointment, his voice was steady.  “Please, Draco, don’t try to let me down gently.  It’s fine.”
Scorpius’ name was called, and Scorpius dragged his Mother by the arm as he raced through the doorway.  “Dean,” he said delightedly, as the Mediwizard gave him a high five and gently placed him on the cot in an examining room.  “I brung you my dragon to see!”
panting after you, and you won’t give him the time of day.  And don’t tell me that you don’t find him attractive.  I’ve seen the way you look at him.  He’s probably the nicest bloke in London.  What’s wrong with you?”
“Okay,” Cass said sadly, giving Draco a ‘fix this now!’ look.  “Papa, will you give my love to everyone?”
Only it
Draco’s eyes had filled with tears.  “No, Harry.  No, no.  How could you think that?  It’s just that you know what people will say.  The press is going to start screaming that I have you under a mind-control curse.  It will be a re-hashing of everything wrong I’ve done in my life.”  In what was, in hindsight, a somewhat placatory gesture, Draco had invited Harry to have tea at his Mother’s each Saturday.  He’d introduced Harry as ‘his friend’, and, unlike when they were in private, had kept his hands firmly to himself, but Harry had, once he’d gotten over his discomfort around Narcissa, been thrilled by the invitation into Draco’s world.
“I know.”
The apology came more easily to Draco than he had expected.
“I think they’re all on at least their second duel,” she said.
"They asked if you'd come home, said you'd just disappeared last night. And of course, Hermione got really worried. She felt bad that we left you there."
Draco nodded.
Harry glanced at Malfoy but not a muscle moved on his face. Across from him, Neville had shrunk into his chair and was concentrating hard on picking the stuffing out of a hole in the upholstery. Ron was staring at Ginny and Pansy, Hermione looked like she wanted badly to be somewhere else and Luna like she already was.
"Alright, then."
They should have sped up past these cells, the ones where they all risked recognizing someone. They slowed instead and walked closer together. Draco kept his eyes on the floor, but Granger and Harry were looking now. Draco had tried hard to forget everything from his last visit, everything but the practical, necessary details relevant to their mission, but he hadn’t succeeded and now he found himself counting the cells to the one where his father was. He thought it might be empty. He didn’t know if they would be informed of it if he died, or if his mother would even pass it on if she found out.
Nobody said anything and in the silence, he watched the red-haired girl across from him. Lovegood was leaning against her and Ginny had put an arm around her and was running her fingers absentmindedly through her hair. She looked both fiery and serene and it was not the first time that Draco had to admit to himself that she was beautiful. The stab of jealousy he felt was familiar too. It was easy to understand why Harry had fallen in love with her. It was easy when looking at her, to see all the ways in which she would have been a better choice.
He was probably ruining his robes, actually, sitting like this on a filthy doorstep that had likely been soiled by countless unmentionable liquids over time.
“What’s so bad about that?”
"You're not?" he asked.
He tried very hard not to think too much about the dementors. It didn’t go very well.
Potter scoffed.
Draco reached for the door handle.
Draco leaned forward. He pressed his lips against Potter’s in a clumsy, drunken kiss. He had only a fraction of a second to register that it was
Harry nodded.
“I may have been slightly drunk. So, where are you living at the moment?”
“Why? You made it pretty fucking clear last night that you don’t want anything to do with me!”
Apart from the veiled figures the only other person in there was a crumpled, dust coloured man in the corner with at least ten greasy glasses in front of him.
Draco was not even halfway to the Slytherin dungeon when he realized how ridiculous it had been of him to leave so abruptly. He hadn’t even apologized properly for Pansy’s behaviour. There had been no reason to start defending her – he should have made it clear that he wanted to cooperate. It was stupid of him not to have asked Pansy to try to get along with the Gryffindors, but he had thought it would be obvious. Of course it wasn’t, since she didn’t know how important it was, because he hadn’t told her that either. It was his own fault, and still he couldn’t help being annoyed with her. She didn’t have to stand on her pride like that. It would make everything so much easier for her, and for him, if she didn’t.
Harry shrugged.
"Didn't say it was."
Blaise grinned at Draco, an excessively charming flash of white teeth.
Harry cut him off.
“Oh – no, it’s fine. It’s nothing.”
“Sure,” he said.
“Just stay away, it’s not that hard. Nobody wants you near him.”
He started, the snake patronus flickered out.
"It'll be fine, I guess. Mark saw us leave."
“I didn’t know Weasley was coming,” he said.
He turned his head very slowly to look at her. He opened his mouth, but didn’t say anything. Draco looked at his mother. Why had she wanted to do this?
“The teachers? How would they know?”
Ginny ignored Pansy’s remark.
“I can’t. I have work.”
“Do you want to go again or…?” he asked.
" she repeated scathingly. "Blaise's birthday, you scatter-brained arsehole!"
The stone Gargoyle stepped aside and he walked past it unto a spiral staircase that carried him to the door of the headmistress’ office. He knocked and it swung open.
“Well, I didn’t just throw curses at her, did I? I reminded her of what she did last year. I mean, after the Carrows none of us are entirely innocent. How many students actually refused to practice the dark magic they were teaching us? And everyone was telling on everyone, that was just how it was.”
"Right, because you're dramatic. I saw the way you and Potter glared at each other when we passed - do you really still have that grudge going?"
“Why is it dark down there?” he asked.
“Okay,” Harry said.
“How did you find it?”
He stood up and crossed over to the door. He had his hand on the handle when she spoke again:
“We will,” said Harry. “See you soon.”
Potter winces.
“What were you doing with Malfoy?” asked Hermione.
It was so light and thin, so smooth it felt watery in a way that reminded him of the invisibility cloak. It was hard for his eyes to focus. It took him a second to realize that Malfoy was looking weirdly at him. The apology was ready on his lips immediately:
“I’m not saying you shouldn’t tell them we’re
“That’s where the dementor pit is. We don’t have any prisoners lower than the fourth floor. You wouldn’t want to go down there, even with a powerful patronus., there are too many of them. I think that’s where the new ones come from.”
Potter nodded. He had his arms crossed and looked towards the window.
Lost in comfortable self-pity, Draco drifted down empty corridors and followed changing staircases randomly. The halls were empty and quiet this time of night, since only seventh year Slytherins had classes, and they were all away in the Astronomy tower with their star-charts and arithmancy books. He soon found himself in a part of the castle he didn’t know. It had grown dark outside and he saw his own passing reflection in the black glass of the windows. There was the soft glow of oil lamps in some corridors, and magical, sourceless light in others. Even when deserted, the halls of Hogwarts had an unpleasant, occupied quality, and he soon got the sense that someone was listening, following him, that they were breathing just quietly enough for him to be unable to trace the sound. Powerful magic could have that effect on you; he knew there were no real sounds in the corridor apart from his own footsteps and the low mutterings of people in paintings, but after a while he resigned and pulled out his wand, chiding himself for being paranoid and childish. He passed a portrait of a fat woman in an extravagant, pink dress. She was fast asleep, resting her head against the frame of the painting and snoring loudly. He thought perhaps he recognized her, but it might just be that she was some noble woman he had seen paintings of before.
“Of course. The Selwyns messed up, but I’m sure they’re thrilled that Matthew is in our year now. No family would want their heir to be the one who was left out when the rest of Britain’s wealthiest witches and wizards meet with their old friends from school. The Malfoy family used to be the most powerful of the pureblood houses, we practically ran Britain. So they all knew they couldn’t afford not to be friends with me.”
“Uh, last night.”
“McGonagall was looking right at me-“
“Nobody switches around between
“Of course you can.”
“Your patronus. Do you know why it looks like that?”
“It’s evil,” he said again, forcing himself to speak calmly. “It’s a piece of rot in the world. It affects people, it might be able to reach us all the way here, even if we think we can’t feel it – don’t look at me like that. I’m not mad. If you’d seen it, you would understand.”
“You did this on purpose?”
“What does she do to you?”
“We just aren’t,” he said.
“Right. We don’t know. So we’re not going to go back before we’ve looked.”
“We’ve been talking a bit this year.”
“I’m not!”
"Glad you made it!" Irie said. "I can't really get out right now, but I'll hug you later, alright?"
Ron went completely red – it was incredible how touchy he still was about that considering how long he and Hermione had been together by now.
“Yeah, so let’s get inside before they see us and hopefully they’ll sit with someone else.”
Draco reached for the door.
anyone…”
“Mr Weasley,” he said, voice held tight. “It’s Harry. What’s wrong?”
"I know. We checked so…" Ron shrugged. "Guess I'm just wondering why you didn't go with them."
“So is this something we should tell the others about?” he asked, probing the odd silence.
“Evelyn Selwyn.”
She nodded.
Harry followed Malfoy inside. They split up and went to sit down at their own house tables. Ron and Hermione had saved him a seat. He sat and loaded up his plate.
“Yeah,” he said. “That’s what I tell myself.”
"You've got snakes carved into your coffee table, Malfoy. I think you'll manage."
"How about you leave him alone?" Pansy cut him off. "Draco, why don't you go get us another round of drinks? It's your turn."
She shot him a look and he knew he had sounded too relieved.
"You fucking monster," she hissed.
“But they won’t attack,” said Draco.
Draco swallowed and glanced back into the cell.
“I don’t. And I’m not stalking you.”
"I mean he goes out for drinks with us, but I don't actually know him that well. Don't get me wrong, I like him. He's funny. He's just a little… odd, you know?"
“Of course it does!”
It’s not a fair response, even if it’s honest. He shouldn’t ask Potter to insist on forgiving him and it’s not like he actually wants him to take it back.
“Look,” he said. “The entire Weasley-clan has managed to arrive late. Most of them graduated years ago, why on earth did they bring the whole litter?”
“Yes, but remember how we thought maybe it was drawing from a much bigger area than what we normally assume – I drew it somewhere.”
“Not much. I’ve moved out of the Manor, got a flat in London, I think I mentioned that over the phone?”
He was standing too close. Draco would have stepped back if Potter hadn’t been holding on to his arm so tightly, actually pulling him towards him, as if he was afraid Draco would apparate away.
She turned away from him again as if the conversation was over. He didn’t leave. Pansy had never figured out how to stay quiet, especially when she was angry.
“Did he ask you to tell me that?” he asked.
“Right,” said Draco.
“No, class was moved to midnight, so we’ve just had a free period.”
“But it matters,” said Potter, and Draco could feel his eyes on him now. “It’s what makes all the difference.”
Draco sighed.
Harry watched him. He had his head tilted back, resting against the wall. His eyes were closed. His skin looked even whiter in the dark. Not sickly, the way it did sometimes at the beginning of the year. More like porcelain.
He rolled his eyes.
“We could ask the rest of our terrorist group to come too,” he said.
“This was not how I wanted to have this conversation… I would have planned it better. Sorry.”
“Take what back?” asked the girl.
“They decided to sit with Slytherin.”
Harry hesitated.
"Pretty surprised you've managed to convince anyone you're a muggle if you start going on about aurors after one beer."
He may have been feeling severely confounded right then, but he wasn't stupid enough to think this
“Oh, I am aware that Mr Malfoy has played a significant part as well,” said McGonagall with a knowing smile that reminded Harry so much of Dumbledore he had to wonder if it was something that was passed down from headmaster to headmaster along with the office, or if it was simply a requirement for getting the job in the first place.
“Fuck you.”
He was about to protest when he noticed Granger’s expression and knew he had overstepped a line. She obviously knew Lovegood was crazy, but he had not earned the privilege to express that sentiment.
“What is it?” Draco asked when he reached him, glancing back down towards the Great Hall.
She was looking pityingly at him, though she probably didn’t know it.
“Blaise, put your wand away and let’s
“I’m going to die.”
“Hm?”
“We are going to crush Slytherin this year,” he announced happily.
"Yes?" he said.
“You can bring all the help you want,” he said. “Call in your whole army if you think they’re willing to work with us, I don’t care how we do this. I’m asking you because you’re the expert, so if you think we need to invite half of Gryffindor House, then I won’t object.”
“I think there’s room for both of us on the sofa.”
the day after the news came out: half of the debate section dedicated to letters from witches and wizards from all over Britain lashing out at the Ministry, not for the lapse in security that had allowed the dementors to be destroyed, but for the fact that it had not happened
Draco turned around. Harry had jammed his hands into the pockets of his robes. There was a frantic look in his eyes, like he too was about to bolt out the door after Pansy, or as if he was hoping Draco would.
He flipped through the paper, though if there was anything about Azkaban in there, it would have been front page news. Apparently the Ministry was keeping the whole thing quiet for now.
“Yeah, maybe I’m not so happy right now.”
Draco winced.
“You’ll get caught.”
“How much further is it?” asked his mother.
She bent down and gave him a quick hug, and for a moment the scent of her hair enveloped him and suddenly he missed her terribly. He hugged her back, and for a second all he to do was hold on to her so she wouldn’t leave. Then she pulled away.
The corners of her mouth twitched.
“And you know, sometimes forgiveness isn’t good,” she said and the last bit of patience had left her voice. “I don’t think you’re stuck up or self-righteous, or whatever else people have said about you. A lot of the time your judgment is right and I know you’re a good person, but you have no
Malfoy's shoulders stayed tense, but his movements stilled.
Harry looked back over his shoulder – Ron and Hermione were standing a few feet away, looking curiously at him.
Draco’s skull felt like it might burst. He saw hundreds of memories of war and felt hundreds of people’s grief like beetles scurrying through his brain, a thousand tiny legs, he watched stone walls being erected around his limp body, he watched his own hand as he erected a building to hold the immortal wizard and the monsters he had spawned forever. A heaviness had settled in his chest, he was so afraid. He could feel razorblades pushing out behind his eyes and needles growing in his gums – and then the clammy touch of a mind burrowing into his, he remembered the wrists of Rabastan Lestrange and then the astronomy tower and Harry laughing and a sloppy kiss and-
Ron quickly sent a Patronus to his boss, and then they searched the house, but to no avail.  Harry and Ginny were both gone.  Ron apparated to Harry and Ginny’s flat, but returned with a shake of his head a few minutes later.  “No sign of them.”
“Okay,” Draco repeated.  “I’m not sure whether you’re ready to hear it yet, but I wanted to apologize for the way I acted the last time we saw each other.  I know that I lied to you, even if my intentions were good, and I know that lying is something that you simply can’t tolerate, even if…especially if, it’s being done to protect you.”
Luminous, heartbreaking green eyes met Draco’s alight with hope.  “Could I?”
With a sense of dread, Draco said, “I promise.”
Draco stepped through the door, and with a calculating gaze, took inventory.  Rose petals, lavender, Irish moss, feverfew.  And, a tiny vial of nearly-empty Ashwinder eggs.  He gave a short nod to Ron and Hermione, and Ron called out, “Hey George?”
“How many others are there?”
“If you were to go with me, you’d have to sit quietly for a long time.  It wouldn’t be very much fun at all.  And we’ll need to make sure that you don’t pick up any germs along the way, so lots of cleaning spells.”
“Obviously not, if they didn’t tell me that I had a friend who worked in a pub.”  I smile at her.
“Potter, you figured out how to find the Philosopher’s Stone when you were an ickle firstie.”  Pansy doesn’t seem to be giving up on this.
Luckily, he found that his best friends were in much improved humour, compared to his last visit.  He spent an entertaining hour with Rose, who was re-writing the story of Sleeping Beauty.  Apparently, the princess wasn’t ‘interesting enough’, and Rose fancied a story where the princess did her own saving.  Looking down at her earnest, beloved little face, Harry couldn’t dispel the ache in his chest.  He knew that he hadn’t really exorcised the ghosts of his past, that his work for DMAC was a transparent attempt to address the childhood that he hadn’t had.  He also knew that, if he ever listened to Hermione and went to see a Mind Healer, they’d have a field day picking through his unresolved issues.  Still, he couldn’t look at Rose, or Teddy, or Hugo without wondering how anyone could possibly look at the unbridled sweetness and
“Um, yeah, I think.  I mean, I have to go home for a bit, sort things out, but I thought I’d maybe…come back?  If you…”
“Slag.  Homewrecker.”
“Scorpius, you don’t have to apologize.  Every single witch and wizard does accidental magic.  You won’t be in trouble for it.  Magic is brilliant, but it’s hard to learn, and we don’t punish kids for the things they can’t control.”
“No, that’s not necessary.  I can sleep on the floor in Cass’ room or something.  I can’t take Astoria’s room.”
“I wouldn’t miss it, little duck.  Nothing would stop me.”
The first day Harry knew for certain that he was in love with Draco hadn’t started out well at all.  Harry had left his muddy trainers in Draco’s front hall, and Draco had responded predictably.  He’d called Harry a classless boor, had complained about the drying mud had flaked all over his tiles.  He’d ranted about how Harry had always been this way, thoughtlessly blundering through his life, with no concern about how his actions impacted other people.
“Who even
“Well, I don’t remember that, do I?  There’s something about him, though.  It’s like I can’t look away.”
“So, Scorpius’ Mum, is she wixen?”
“It was rather a surprise to meet her, though.”
“Oh Draco, he’s going to know the truth tomorrow.”
I say,  “It sounds like it’s basically anyone who was considered Dark, though, not just Voldemort followers.  Their names are mud, so they can’t find employment, then, when they’re desperate, and turn to misdemeanour to make ends meet, they get punished.  There’s one girl right now, and her solicitor can’t get into the country to help.  Based on what you told me about your advocacy work for Werewolves after the war, I thought you’d be interested in helping out.”
“Kreacher, I need you to help me care for Master Harry,” Draco said imperiously.
The remaining words blurred on the page as Harry’s vision swam.  Nausea rose in his belly as he sat, shocked, his entire body going cold.  It was happening again.  It had been a trick.  Draco didn’t want him.  He was taking Harry's daughter.  Everything he feared was coming true.  Harry felt the exact moment when a fissure formed in his consciousness.  He was splitting in two.  He was breaking apart.  He had to get somewhere safe.  He had to pull himself together enough so that he could get away.  He could shatter completely as soon as he knew that his daughter was safe, and happy, and he was far away from her.  His panic rose, and he knew that he had very little time to manage this situation, before the shock wore off and he was unable to function.
He spied Scorpius and Astoria making their way along the platform, which was becoming crowded with students and families.  Scorpius cried out in delight when he saw them, and raced amongst trunks and people and owl cages until he reached their side.  “Cass,” he called, excitement bubbling over.  “Do you see the Hogwarts Express?”
“I know you are.  Thank you for understanding.”
“If I thought it an odd coincidence that this happened at the same time that Harry Potter had suddenly disappeared without trace, I didn’t say.  And before I knew what was happening, Draco had me speaking to the Greengrasses, and he and Astoria were betrothed.  I have no idea what Lucius said to him that day, but the spark that had danced in his eyes was extinguished.”
“Yes.”
“So, Draco told me that I placed him in a terrible position when it comes to any public statements about Cass.  If he acknowledges her, the press will have a field day, and if he doesn’t, he is rejecting her.  He has a point.”
“Love you too, cheri,” he said quietly.  Her eyes sparkled a little before she kissed Astoria and Scorpius, and lugged her trunk onto the train.
“What,” I say, sinking back onto the couch, “the fuck?”
“Harry, Harry,” Draco says, as his thrusts grow harder, more erratic.  I cant my hips back to meet his, the only sounds are our breath and slapping skin. I’m seeing spots, and it’s so good, everything I dreamed.  “Draco,” I gasp.  “Gonna’ come.”
for once.  This thing with the Slytherins was from before, but it doesn’t sit right that some slimy little shit can threaten me in a fucking storage room.”  I stalk across the room and stare out the window, trying to get my emotions under control.  I’m so bloody sick of not knowing what’s going on, and doing the wrong thing all the time.
“Nah, not right now,” Ron said.  “I’ve got memories to show them.  We’ll need each of you to formally put something down before her trial, but I can come by later and arrange things.  I think it’s not a bad idea to get Harry away for a bit.  Maybe stay at Draco’s for a few days.”
Scorpius considered this, and whispered, “My throat is a bit sore.”
“My Dad’s not coming back.  Not right away.  Did you know?”  She didn’t know how else to start the conversation, so she just jumped in, like she would have done with her Dad.  She’d figure out how to talk to Papa later.
Hugs 'n kisses,
Harry regarded him for a moment, seeming to weigh up the look in Draco’s eyes.  Finally he sighed.  “My bedroom, I suppose.”  They tiptoed upstairs to a large room.  Posters of Muggle girls on motorbikes were plastered on the walls.  Draco raised an eyebrow.  “This was my godfather’s room.  I couldn’t stay in my room, after.  And then I couldn’t bear to take those down when I moved in here.”  For a moment, Harry’s eyes seemed to glisten with unshed tears before he blinked hard.  “Okay, Draco.  If you insist, you can tell me whatever you need to…but I can’t imagine that anything you say will make a difference.”
Ron is looking at her, horror contorting his features.  “‘Mione,” he finally gasps, and the single utterance of her name is more condemning than any vitriol I could spew.
“Anytime. I’m going to go in, I’ll see you later.”
“Not that you need it, but yes, I suppose.”
“Draco,” she replied, her tone a little chiding, but her smile remaining warm.  “I think we’re long past the ‘Malfoy and Granger’ phase, don’t you?”
“A Malfoy always looks well-groomed,” she replied primly, and Harry laughed.
“I like hugs,” Cass said, her shy little grin looking so much like a young Harry’s had, that Hermione nearly sobbed again as she held the little girl tightly.  As introductions were made, and hugs were given, Hermione watched Harry, looking between his daughter and his family as though all of his Christmases and birthdays had come at once.
“Maybe,” Cass admitted, tousling his artfully arranged hair.  He glared at her, but she ignored him and said, “Dad, Auntie Min stopped me before I caught the train.”
“Harry,” Hermione said gently, “our school years were a bit tough.  You had a hard time, and so did Draco, and it was hard for you to see eye to eye.  After we left Hogwarts, the two of you made your peace, but you didn’t see each other very much.  But you and Draco have been so close, all this time you’ve been here.  Just because you weren’t friends before, doesn’t mean you can’t be friends now.”
Draco jumps, knocks his vial of ink over, and curses as he waves his wand to spell it back into the bottle.  “Harry.”  His eyes are wide, and an open, childlike expression crosses his face.  “You came.”
I squeeze in a nap before Mill is set to arrive, and I’m just struggling back into my denims when I hear the floo.  Kreacher, who spent nearly an hour earlier trying to convince me to move back to ‘Master’s proper home’, greets her, and I hear a bright little voice demand, “Where is he?  I want to see the scar.”
“Oh,” Harry said, considering.  “I’m glad that I’ll remember everything, even the bad.”
“I know that you had the chance to be happy, and you decided that self-flagellation was more important than your future.”
“That child has an exceptionally chatty mouth.  Little gossip.”
The floo call to Ron and Hermione isn’t exactly promising.  Hermione flatly refuses to help Draco, and Ron says that he’ll only come if Hermione does.  I toss more floo powder into the flames and step through.  Hermione is wearing stretch pants and a battered jumper, and her hair is wrapped around a pencil that holds it out of her face. It’s clear that I’m interrupting some of her rare time off from work.  Her face is pinched, and I know that I’m relying heavily on the relationship that’s still a bit rocky.  “Hermione,” I say, grabbing her hands and squeezing them tight.  “He’s just a baby.  Even if you hate Draco, and I’m not saying you don’t have every right to however you feel, would you really feel okay with someone hurting a defenceless baby?”
“Anyways,” Auror Pritchard said, “I just wanted you to know.  Am I finished?”
Ensconced in the warmth of Ron and Hermione’s little cottage, their daughter Rosie toddling around him, Harry starts to emerge from the fog that’s surrounded him since Draco left him.  Harry practices telling himself:
“So why-”
“Listen, this is none of my business, and you’re welcome to tell me to stay out of it, but…I know that Louise wanted to go to University, but she’s needed here in the shop.  I’d like to change that.”
“And the twins are well?”
“I knew that our only hope for salvation was to rid our society of those who were Dark-aligned.  I knew that the Department of Mysteries had a solid research strategy.  I knew that those who were members of Slytherin House during the War, and those affiliated with them, were being addressed.”
Draco’s eyes flash. “Why do you keep comforting me?  How are you okay with this?”
“Yeah.  I tried the first time that Scorpius had to have a procedure to repair the damage from all of his nosebleeds.  The doors lit up and an alarm sounded, and four mediwitches came running and yelled at me.  Seems a bit over the top, considering, but I suppose they get their fair share of nervous parents.”
The house is quiet as Draco enters, and for a moment, Draco’s terrified that he’s too late.  There’s a muffled thud from upstairs though, followed by a muttered curse, and Draco pounds up the stairs.  One of the doors opens, and Harry stands there.  Despite the fact that Draco has barged into his house, unannounced, Harry doesn’t carry his wand, or even look surprised.  “Oh, it’s you,” he says dully.
“Potter,” he says, his eyes riveted on me.  I note that I’m Potter this time, not Harry.  I can’t imagine that’s a coincidence. There’s no hug this morning, either.
“Of course, Scorpius.  I’m here to help, remember?”
Steam rose as the Hogwarts Express pulled into the station.  Draco looked fondly on as Cass’ face lit up.  She clutched an owl cage in her hand tightly, and stood on the balls of her toes, rocking back and forth slightly.  Draco wondered if she was aware that she shared this habit with her Dad.   Her face tipped up to look at him.  “He’s coming, right?”
As he checked his watch, Harry allowed himself to hope that maybe he’d overestimated the interest that there would be in his return to England.    Perhaps nobody cared.  He prayed that nobody had shown up, and he could simply go back to living his life in obscurity.  His hopes were dashed, when Greg entered the room, and said, “It’s really filling up in there.”
“Dad, that’s insane.  You’re acting like someone will snatch me off the stage thingy.”
“Wonderful.  I’m really lucky, then, to have a good house elf.  Thanks.”  This prompts a somewhat suspicious look, but then, when he realizes I’m not taking the piss, he smiles again, and disappears from the room with a loud pop.  Honestly, I’m going to have words with Ron and Hermione about this.  They made sure to tell me about an owl I had in school that’s been dead for half a decade, but no mention of a currently living…person?  Animal?  Creature?  I suppose the name fits.
I make it until noon the next day before the walls start feeling like they’re closing in on me.  I’d already had a leisurely wank in the shower, during which I pictured Draco’s long slim fingers in place of my own.  I clean the flat, I practice magic from the first-year spell book that Hermione had provided, but there are a ton of spells that are, frankly, ridiculous.  Why would I want to turn a rat into a goblet?  It couldn’t possibly be sanitary to drink from.
"Just go!"
“I wasn’t the sort of person you could have liked.”
Ginny looked at him.
“Zabini already apologized.”
“He doesn’t hate you.”
He was careful not to let any of the panic register on his face.
“What?” he said, feeling a chill spreading through him, and suddenly there was a thousand miles between them.
“Hilarious."
Draco thought he should probably have gone home a while ago. He stood up. Potter looked up at him but didn't follow.
“Yeah, I hope it works out. After the war there’s been some unexpected complications.”
Harry hesitates on the landing where the hallway leads down to Ron’s room, but only for a moment. The last flight of stairs is narrow, they creak and groan loudly with every step. It’s late, but Malfoy is probably still awake. He doesn’t seem to sleep much. Harry isn’t sure why he goes up there. He thinks it might have something to do with Lupin drinking firewhisky alone after everyone has gone to bed. Or with the way Hermione sighed when she finished her book of fairytales and flipped back to the first page and started over. It has something to do with Mrs Weasley asking him to help out with chores or wedding preparations every time he tries to read the Prophet, and with the heavy weight of the locket against his chest when he moves. It has something to do with Ginny kissing him and the way it felt like they were saying goodbye.
“What’s he doing here?” she would ask, her voice hard as flint.
“I am. I really want to, I just can’t decide where to go. It’s a bit difficult, since I can’t really put down Hogwarts as previous education on my application, and I’ll have to translate the grades too. It’ll probably be hard to make it fit with further wizarding education as well.“
There was another gap of silence. They stood across from each other, the two of them alone in the Entrance Hall, the flapping sounds of bat wings above them, and Potter was looking at him. This long, uninhibited stare, as if he was trying to figure something out.
“So –see you later.”
“What are they doing here?” he asked, his voice high and piercing.
"Maybe they decided against it when they realized there wouldn't be room for half the heroic shit we've done. Most of these guys are at least four times our age, and they’ve got nothing on us. After this year, I think my real résumé is starting to look more impressive than Lockhart’s fake one."
“Are you…. You’re crying?”
“I don’t think Hermione and Ginny are coming back. We should probably call this a day, but we’ll have another meeting later. I’ll tell you when it is. Is that alright with everyone?”
“Did they get you?”
Potter looks away. Draco waits, but Potter doesn’t say anything. Draco hesitates, then turns away. His heart is still hammering. He can’t feel his knees. He takes another step up the stairs to return to his attic room. He has come to hate it these last few days, but suddenly he wants nothing more than to curl up in his squeaky bed and never talk to another person again.
“She’s pretty smart, Draco.”
“Yeah, alright,” he said. ”Thanks, Luna.”
He pushed off from the wall and took an uncertain step forward, losing his balance almost immediately. Draco surged forward and grabbed his arm, reacting on reflex rather than intent, and before he could extract himself from that blunder, Potter had grabbed onto him and was leaning heavily against him.
"I don't believe you."
“Nothing,” he said with a shrug.
“Pansy!” Draco called.
Malfoy glanced down.
The sky had grown darker. A cold gust of wind blew over the trees with a whisper.
“Well, shit,” said Ginny.
Malfoy opened his eyes and turned his head to look at him.
Harry looked away from him and avoiding Neville’s gaze too, as he was pretty sure he was looking at him just as reproachfully. It was strange that it felt like Malfoy was the only one in the room who wasn’t against him.
“Piss off,” she said.
Potter didn't move.
“Relax, Potter. We’re drunk, you were messing with my hair, I was just going along with it. It’s just for fun, I’ve been making out with Pansy at parties for years, it doesn’t mean shit.”
believe it? What do you think would happen if I went up to one of your Weasleys and told them how sorry I am? Do you honestly believe they would just forget about everything and tell me that it wasn’t my fault and at least I apologized and their brother probably doesn’t mind being dead anyway? Because I don’t see that happening, I really don’t. Apologizing for it won’t change
"Guess I'm walking you to the door, then."
“How are you?”
“What?”
Draco pulled his book towards him.
“He doesn’t want his friends to find out.”
“What page?” he asked.
He got a beer. It wasn't as bad as he'd feared. The hangover potion had done its work, and he'd at least gotten in a decent amount of sleep before he decided to put himself in a bar again.
"I didn't want to bother them," he muttered, since it seemed like Ron wanted some kind of answer, and that was as good as any.
"What?" Irie said looking at her with her eyebrows raised in what was, even to Harry, a very unconvincing mask of innocence.
"Right, you'll just hang around here until they show up and then politely explain the situation?” Malfoy said scathingly. “I'm sure that's exactly how you want to spend your afternoon."
Then he felt the pull like a hook behind his navel when Draco disapparated.
"Must be if you've managed it," Harry said.
He also doesn’t know what it means that he reaches for Draco then, or what it means when Draco leans in and kisses him, but it’s a different kiss this time. It’s soft, not the rushed, exhilarating kisses of the night before, of two weeks under the same roof with a quivering secret between them. Not the violent, desperate tilt of their fifth year headless, visceral escape from everything that was happening elsewhere in their lives. It’s soft. It’s Harry’s hand resting against Draco’s jaw, holding him in place but not pulling him closer. It’s Draco’s hands on Harry’s waist and his breath warm against his lips, the slow and careful kisses of people in lives where time isn’t running out. It’s a reminder of what their relationship isn’t, what this thing between them, whatever it is, has never been. It’s the thing Harry wants so badly and knows he can’t have.
“Probably good you’ve been taking muggle studies, then,” said Hermione.
“No,” she said. “It was war. We just did what we had to to survive, exactly like everyone else. That’s what you said, remember? We were just surviving. There’s nothing for us to be ashamed of.”
“I know you plan to go into politics once you leave Hogwarts,” she said. “I am sure that when you do, you will be able to change things.”
He stopped and turned around to look at Potter, who was still standing by the window, watching him.
He had entertained the thought that perhaps Potter was avoiding him – it wasn’t usually this difficult to get a hold of him unnoticed, so maybe Potter was actually trying to make sure that they were never alone. Maybe he regretted what had happened or maybe Draco had misunderstood the things he had said. They hadn’t really talked much, after all.
"Alright,” he said. “I mean, I don’t want to pry. I’m just trying to figure out why you look like you want to feed him to a blast ended screwt if all he did was be polite and apologize."
“I reckon we should just do it without the Slytherins. Seems the simplest solution, doesn’t it?” said Ron.
"Really?"
“Are you getting back together or something?”
Hermione sighed.
“Okay?”
. He was just about to pull his hand back when Malfoy moved.
Harry glared back at him and Ron's grin faltered.
"Well, that's your problem, not mine."
"Okay. So this weird thing happened at work a little while back. Draco was handing this girl her coffee and she starts screaming at him, right? Just completely out of nowhere. Calling him a murderer and all sorts of crazy shit. And, okay, this might sound a bit mad, but it seemed like it was because of his tattoo?"
They were halfway across the room when he saw them. He noticed Potter first - Draco had spent too many years seeking out his face in a crowd to miss it now - but then his eyes moved on to the fiery red hair of the next person in the booth, Weasley, who had his arm around Granger, and next to and across from them were Finnigan and Thomas, Lovegood, Longbottom, Patil (both of them), Boot and Bones. Draco stopped dead in his tracks. Pansy's hand tightened around his arm as she tried to keep steering him forwards.
“I know. She threatened to curse me if I didn’t stay away from you.”
"This way, then," Malfoy said sharply, and was suddenly striding away from Harry, the sharp clack of his shoes heading back the way they had come.
Potter hesitated.
about it, but honestly, Potter, I wish you would just leave it.”
“If you say so…” he said reluctantly.
“Manners, Potter. You are our saviour after all, you could at least try to act like you weren’t raised in a barn, so as not to embarrass the rest of us.”
“But we can’t kill people.”
He nodded.
She looked surprised.
He stood by the railing and was looking down to the floor below. Harry went over to look with him. He could see billowing fog and dementors down there and it took him a second to realize what Draco meant. There were still dementors down there, but now there were also spaces where they weren’t; holes in the mass of bodies. They hadn’t been there when they came down.
And like the rest of Harry’s summer, his birthday is a tricky balancing act between the warmth and normalcy of the Burrow, of life moving on, and then the war looming over all of them, breathing down their necks: There’s breakfast and presents, Fred and George grumbling when Mrs Weasley volunteers them to do the dishes afterwards, there’s a game of quidditch in the garden, and then lunch is interrupted by the arrival of the Minister for Magic.
Draco didn’t tell either of them about his father. He ought to have told Pansy, but he couldn’t stand the thought of that conversation. He didn’t want to tell anyone.
“Dad?” he said only just loud enough for Harry to hear him and his voice sent a chill down Harry’s spine.
"I'm not."
And then he plunged ahead into the bodies of the dementors, herding his patronus forward. Draco snatched up Granger’s wand and followed.
“What,
Lovegood traced a finger over the lines.
, he thought.
“What’s wrong?” she asked.
“Why did you do that?” he asked.
“Depends what you’re asking for. He’s halfblood, so I’ve heard he gets things for the muggleborn too and that’s supposed to take a while. But if you’re not asking for anything too obscure or too illegal, I think about a day or two. Oh, and he can get alcohol pretty much immediately. I’m not sure if he has a stash somewhere or a deal with the house elves, but that should be easy.”
Irie pulled a face.
It all seemed too elaborate to be a lie.
There were more potions, more spells, more sharply smelling ointments. Harry paced between the beds, cringing whenever another sob of pain escaped through Hermione’s gritted teeth. Ron stood like frozen next to the bed, his face pale and worried. He started when Madam Pomfrey suddenly stopped to look at him.
“I think she’s an excellent captain.”
Potter pointed to the sofa.
Malfoy was stubbing out his cigarette on the ledge outside, but Harry thought he saw a smirk on his face right before he turned away.
"Is what true?"
Ron and Hermione notice it too, Ron asking if something’s up with him and Malfoy, Hermione saying he should “just ignore him”, as if it were that easy.
“Anything interesting in there?” asked Granger, pointing to Draco’s newspaper.
Harry shrugged.
They sat in silence for a while. She read and he looked out the window. He usually cared quite a lot about her opinion, but for some reason her aversion to his alliance with Potter didn’t bother him. It had been his plan from the beginning to make friends with Potter only as a way of repairing his image, and that was still all there was to it. And even if it did feel a bit like a private redemption, that was just a convenient side effect. Pansy looked up again.
“I missed you,” Draco whispers and then wishes instantly that he had kept his mouth shut, because Harry suddenly goes rigid.
Harry, Draco and Hermione descended through the tower, moving much faster now they didn’t stop to draw runes. They rushed past the cells, down, down, down towards the darkness at the bottom. They didn’t speak. The only sound was of their footsteps and the occasional moans or cries from the cells. Draco heard a strangled noise from Granger behind him and thought she must have looked into a cell, but they didn’t stop.
It was still dark outside when Draco walked from the dungeon to the Entrance Hall. The cold early morning silence reminded him of the day they had come back from Azkaban, these hours when even the portraits were asleep and everything felt still and empty.
“That’s good,” said Harry.
“Not just on her.”
“We should have a hand signal for your mood swings,” she muttered. “Then you could just do that and I could keep at a safe distance until you become a normally functioning person again.”
“Coward.”
"Why would I do that?" Harry said, taking his plate and mug to the table.
"Because Harry Potter said so? Now you're just magically going to be ok?"
Draco started.
“I didn’t want to see you
“Thanks,” she said without looking at him.
He didn’t answer her.
“Good. Goodnight.”
“This part still seems so unnecessarily risky.”
“I went back to get my book and he came out of the classroom right when I got there and,” Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. Things got out of hand.”
It’s past midnight when Draco hears the knock on his door. The summer nights are still bright, but this late the last of the blue twilight is gone, the attic is dark and the light by his bed casts long shadows crawling over the floorboards at the feet of all the rubbish and leftover furniture that occupies the space Draco doesn’t.
he said, like Harry might have forgotten him.
“Lovely, you know how much I adore mystery. Will you at least tell me where we’re going?”
Potter grimaced.
He kept walking. He should figure out where the nearest apparition point was.
Malfoy grinned, and Harry noticed how strange the expression was on him when it wasn’t tinged with condescension or malice. Usually everything about Malfoy was sharp, tight and proper – his face was a controlled mask of calculated emotions, his robes looked like they had been spelled clean and creaseless, and there was never a single hair on his head that was out of place. That Malfoy was hardly even a person, but simply the spoiled and well-tended product of an overprivileged upbringing. But when they walked together up the stairs to the oak doors of the castle, his robes had been ruffled by the wind and his collar was unbuttoned, which was enough to make him look dishevelled. His hair was damp and windswept, his cheeks flushed from the cold air, and he seemed very real. He became approachable, became something you could touch without cutting yourself. And watching him made Harry feel unbalanced, like he was about to trip, and he wouldn’t be able to break the fall.
Draco crouched in front of the shrivelled man and pushed Harry from his mind. He could feel every hair on his arms standing up, his heart picking up speed at the proximity, as he kept half an eye on the spidery fingers, every second expecting them to jerk forwards and wrap themselves around his neck. He stared into the inky wells of the ancient wizard’s eyes and saw his own reflection mirrored in each of them. He levelled his wand at him.
“So what, when you’re attacked by dementors you can’t defend yourself until you’ve had time to forget the horrifying thing in front of you and really focus on thinking nice thoughts to yourself? That doesn’t seem very effective. And I don’t believe for a second that you had that much mental discipline at 13.”
“I’m sorry you had to.”
“What do you mean?” asked Granger.
He nodded again and she returned to her papers. He turned to leave and as he did, he had to fight back an overwhelming urge to scratch at the mark. When he reached the door, he briefly touched the edge of his sleeve before pushing down the handle and slipping out into the corridor. He wondered what his mother would do to him if-
He didn’t say anything. She wiped at the tears, not looking at him, her mouth stretched in an apologetic grin.
Harry scoffed.
it was right when it was happening, before the guilt kicked in, when it was just Malfoy’s hands on his hips and his neck and in his hair, the sound of his breath, the push of his tongue, the scrape of his teeth.
Harry shook his head.
“Are you serious?”
“Don’t,” he snapped.
“You’re not angry, are you?”
Several floors above the Slytherin dungeons in another part of the castle, Harry and Ron were walking together back up to the common room after practice. Harry was exhausted and quiet, but in a good way. He wouldn’t need to go flying over the forest that night, and he realized how long it had been since he last spent time with Ron without having to fight back annoyance and snappish reactions.
Draco laughs his hollow laugh again.
, it had just slipped his mind that it was
,” said Daphne softly.
McGonagall’s eyes settled on the little flock of seventh years and a sad smile came over her face.
But when they finally made their way onto the train, all of Pansy’s luggage included, it turned out that despite the number of people on the platform, the train was far from full. Even with the returning seventh years added to the pool of students, it didn’t make up for all the missing ones. Pansy told him they had reported it in the
He picked up his glass, drained the last of his beer and stood up before Harry could ask what that was supposed to mean.
“Probably a good idea. I wonder if it would make the
“I would be a bit more discreet with the bitterness.”
He knew they had only come the first time because Potter had asked them to, and he hadn’t even told them that Draco and Pansy would be there. He wasn’t sure why they had come back. Potter still looked tense, almost apologetic, so clearly he felt responsible for them being there, but they did not have the air of people who had been talked into something they didn’t want to do. Three of them had led an army, a freedom movement and a refugee camp within the school last year, which had not been easy. He knew that because he had been fighting them. They didn’t just do Potter’s bidding anymore, if they ever had, and if they were here it was of their own volition. So it was possible that the Gryffindor heroes had decided, that this was a worthy cause.
“Come on,” Harry said, nodding his head at the empty corridor.
“Oh, come on, Draco! Look, I’m not criticizing you, it was a very Slytherin thing to do, seeing what people need and using it to make them do what you want. You saw that Potter needed someone to tell him what to do so he could feel useful, and then you gave him a heroic quest to destroy the prison that just happens to be where your father is. I just think it’s silly that you won’t admit that’s what you’re doing.”
He headed over there and sat down across from her. She looked up.
“You’re good with memory charms,” he said.
“No, they broke up.”
“Okay,” he said. “So maybe calling this a D.A. meeting wasn’t exactly right. This is not about me teaching defence against the dark arts or anything-“
She had warm brown skin and a shrewd look in her eyes. Her long hair was gathered in twisty braids, that maybe weren't actually braids. They looked complicated.
After a while, Nate asked who was up for another round. Malfoy glanced at Harry and he shrugged.
He was looking over Harry’s shoulder towards the Slytherin tables.
“You asked me to meet you," he said. "Why? What’s with the small talk? I think we can safely assume neither of us is here for the pleasure of the company, so why don’t you drop the niceties and tell me what this is about?”
Hermione's Ministry issued barn owl was asleep in her cage by the window. Harry poked her gently through the bars. She opened her inky black eyes and blinked at him, looking a little peeved to be woken up.
"Yes, nice meeting you!" Maya said.
He knew as soon as he said it that is was true. He took a deep breath before he continued.
The corners of Potter's mouth twitched.
“See you later,” said Harry.
“Granger’s notes,” he said. “We decided to leave the books here so we’d both have access to all of them, but apparently she has also taken it upon herself to assign homework, or whatever this is. She’s very brief.”
“You heard me. Pretend you don’t know. Ignore it.”
Harry tried to calculate the odds of how likely he would be to get away with it if he just straight up apparated out of there.
She frowned at that, like that wasn’t the answer she wanted.
When they read the charges, they mentioned that Malfoy had been on the run for a few weeks after the battle of Hogwarts, and that he had been kept in custody under dementor guards for a week before his trial. Harry knew well how hard dementors could affect you, but he hadn’t thought it was possible to physically wither away so quickly. The Malfoy he was seeing now in the Great Hall was miles from that figure – perhaps still thinner than he used to be, but nothing you would notice if you weren’t looking for it.
Draco laughed.
She grimaced; a pained, exhausted expression.
“Why do you sound all grumpy about it? Is she messing with your advanced master plan?”
“Sure it isn’t. I know you, Draco, I can tell you’re still agonizing over last year, and apparently it isn’t enough for you to just lay low until it’s blown over. You think you need some sort of redemption and that being friends with Potter will make you feel better.”
“As if that matters,” he says, and Harry hates the bitter knowing in his voice, hates the resigned way he talks, like he has this all figured out while Harry’s head is screaming from trying to keep up.
Granger shrugged and the movement made her look brittle and small.
“I’m not tired,” said Luna.
Harry had never really been able to join in the excitement. For him, summer had always meant his forced return to the Dursleys, and replacing Hogwarts with Privet Drive hadn’t given him much to look forward to. This year, he would be going home with Ron to the Burrow, and so he revelled in the same yearning for freedom everyone else did. For the seventh years, though, the elation was tinged with some nostalgia. As much as Harry looked forward to spending the coming months with the Weasleys, he couldn’t help feeling sad to be leaving Hogwarts behind. Last year, when he had been on the run, he had still, in the back of his mind, been sure that he would eventually return to Hogwarts. And it wasn’t like this was goodbye forever, but when he did come back it would be as a guest, not as a student. It wouldn’t be his home anymore.
“He’s pretty slow at picking it up. Seems it’s taking him longer than it did Neville, considering it’s all private lessons from you.”
“Draco, can you do your spell again?” Harry asked with a questioning look at Hermione.
Hermione raised an eyebrow.
“I don’t think you can give us the credit for that,” he said.
He was still halfway blind from the light of the explosion, but in the faint glow of the stag patronus he could make out the shape of Harry staggering towards a dark shape on the floor.
and then kept everyone else at arm’s distance for the next seven years. Can you honestly say you would be able to properly trust someone you didn't even
“Really?”
"It's fine. I know you're angry. You've got every reason to be. Just don't take it out on me."
His eyes were puffed from sleep and his hair was an impossible mess. The rough upholstery had left a pattern on his cheek and even though the cheap T-shirt hadn’t creased like Draco’s shirt had, it had slid up pretty far to reveal the dark skin of Potter’s abdomen. On top of that, his socks didn’t match. Draco was pretty sure one of them had snitches on it. Potter looked in every way like someone who had been out of bed all night, slept on a couch somewhere he wasn’t supposed to
he was doing this.
He might as well push on now that he had opened this door. Granger looked away.
Jones shrugged.
"Should I go?" he asked.
Draco’s heart stutters. He can almost feel the blood draining from his face.
Draco nodded.
“Oh, Sybill Elphick!” she said.
Harry snorted. Malfoy's eyes snapped back to him and Harry quickly wiped the grin off his face - he hadn't meant to laugh, he just hadn’t expected Malfoy to actually say something honest in the middle of all his bullshit. Harry cleared his throat.
That summer, Draco takes the dark mark and is given the task of assassinating Dumbledore.
He rakes his fingers through his hair and grins up at the ceiling.
Ron groaned.
they called it.”
is a lie – they’ve never done this before. Harry drops his hand and takes a deep breath.
"No?" he said, as if that was obvious.
“You know what I’m talking about,” he said.
“Sure.”
She shrugged.
Malfoy kept talking, though. Asking if they could meet at eight. Harry said eight was fine. And Malfoy thanked him and hung up. Harry put the phone back. He leaned back in the sofa and stared ahead of him at the dark and empty living room of Grimmauld Place, where ancient wizards were asleep in their paintings, an empty owl-cage stood open by the window, a couple of Ron’s crates from the jokeshop hummed ominously in the corner and the carvings on the furniture blinked at Harry with curious, wooden eyes.
“That was probably his own decision, to show us all how adult and independent he is now. I heard he was pissed that we have to come back.”
Draco gave him a minute’s head start. He finished his coffee and tried to convince himself he didn’t feel watched when he got up from the table and followed.
And the worst part, the absolute worst of it, was that the whole thing was like some twisted take on fifteen-year-old Draco's fantasies. He was pretty sure he had dreamt up this exact scenario at one point or another - running into Potter at a pub, Potter realizing he wanted him, kissing him, taking him home. Et cetera. Which just made it all worse, made it so much more humiliating.
“Draco, it’s
Draco followed.
No one said anything. The boat reached the dry beach of the island and dragged itself up on the sand. The aurors jumped out and Draco and his mother followed. He looked back out to the steel grey sea. He wanted to run away. He did not want to go any closer. He did not want to know what was inside. Still, he felt his body moving towards the tower, put one foot in front of the other. The urge to flee was overwhelming. The fear felt primeval, as if the aversion to the horror ahead was suddenly the most deeply rooted instinct in his body. But he pushed the feeling back. He followed the others across the island, telling himself that he wasn’t really there. It wasn’t really happening.
I think fast.  “Perhaps I’ve decided that we should reconsider the terms.”
“Potter,” Snape says, his expression neutral.  “I thought that you should know that Narcissa Malfoy has died.”
“Cedric!” the group shouted, as one, raising their glasses in the air.
Just wanted to say thanks so much for reading this fic.  I feel so fond of this Draco, and it was just the tiniest bit of catharsis, having lost my mum last year.  I appreciate those who kudo'd and if you liked it at all, I sure would love a comment.
“You’re pathetic, Potter.  Hanging around here, panting after me like a lovestruck fool.  As if I’d
“I’m certain that I'm going to regret it,” Harry said ruefully, “but I can’t believe that we’re over a decade from the stupid war, and people are still going after Draco.  This place is so messed up.  They’re still casting me as a hero, because I blundered my way through staying alive when I was a kid, and they’re still casting him as a villain because of choices he was forced to make when he was one.  Both of us born into our roles, and because I was lucky enough to have been on the winning side, he’s vilified.”
“I…” Draco was appalled.  “I would never touch a child like that!”
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose, shrugging.  “Maybe?  He’s scared.  Abused children are often protective of their abusers, and he begged me not to take him away from Draco.”
“You really are that good.  I always thought it was an act, the way you couldn’t stand by if people were being treated unfairly.  You’re an insufferable Gryffindor, you know.”
“Harry Potter.  You are welcome at this school, day or night, for as long as I live.  Hogwarts is your home.  Now come and tell me what’s the matter.”
“I didn't expect you to come to my house.  I didn’t know it would be a problem.  I thought you liked children.  And I wasn’t…I didn’t intend for you to…I…I didn’t think that you would be around long enough to learn about him.  I don’t allow him into society.”
Eventually, our breathing returns to normal.  He’s looking at me, his brow wrinkled, as though he can’t figure me out.  Finally, he asks, “What was that?”
“I want to protect him.  I want to see him smile.”
Malfoy returned after a few minutes.  Harry was exceptionally proud of himself for not getting up and poking around his kitchen during his absence.  He’d wanted to, admittedly, but the embarrassment of being caught kept his rear firmly planted in the chair.
“I won’t survive it if I lose her.”
Harry touched her hand gently.  “No need to thank me.  I understand, Astoria, truly I do.  If you want to, thank Cass.  It’s been her decision, and she’s the one who will be going through the discomfort.”
Her smile was inordinately sad.  “I know you didn’t mean to hurt him, Draco.  It wasn’t your fault, what happened.”
“I think so,” she says.  “At some point.  Maybe not today.”
“But what about my Papa?”  Scorpius’ lower lip was wobbling.
“So you knew that this was a part of a wider conspiracy to eliminate those who are Dark-aligned?”
“Alright.  I’ll confirm soon, okay?  In the meantime, can I have a quick look at my desk?  I’d like to know more about the case I was working on, and who knows…maybe it will spark a memory of something.”
Ah, I realize.  This is about the article in the Prophet.  I nod, waiting for him to continue.
“Hi,” I say.  “You said you were a solicitor, yeah?”
Mrs. Powers made a strangled sound.  Harry sighed.  “I know it’s hard, and I know you’re frightened, but your choice is simple.  Not easy, but simple.  You can accept that Violet has a gift, and support her as she learns it, or you can try to suppress it, and risk losing her completely.  Violet wants her magic, and she’ll feel conflicted if she knows you don’t approve.”
The next day, Narcissa arrived to stay with Harry while Draco went to see Lara.  “Harry, do you remember my mum?”
“Oh,” Harry said, noticing Draco’s tears.  “Oh.  Oh, Draco, here.  You can have my dog.”  Draco laughed wetly, which prompted him to start crying in earnest.  Harry nudged Hank over towards Draco, and the dog leaned his length against Draco’s leg.
“That’s crazy!”
“And it’s genetic in nature?”
“I’ve been speaking with the Greengrass family,” his Mother said conversationally.
This would be painful, Draco knew.  Seeing Harry again, knowing that he would never be his, it unlocked a cavern of such endless grief that Draco knew it was changing him.  He’d been able to nobly walk away once.  Doing so a second time would likely ruin Draco completely, but being exposed to Harry’s pain, of the way that Draco had robbed Harry of agency in making a decision that impacted him…it was unforgivable.
Harry smiled thinly at Miriam.  “I’m ready to begin,” he said.
Draco still wasn’t sure if he was being chastised or thanked.  “Yes.  He’s a Labrador.  He’ll get big enough to protect you, but he’ll be friendly as well.  If…if you want him, that is.”
His team was thrilled to have him back, and before he knew it, the season had started again, and he was practicing five days a week.  He returned to the condo each night, exhausted, barely managing to eat something before collapsing into bed.
“I’d like you to consider that before we next meet, Draco.  It sounds as though you’re determined to follow this through, and so I won’t spend any more time trying to convince you not to, but I really want you to question your motives.  I want you to ask yourself what would happen if you reached the end of this endeavour and Harry Potter still deemed you unacceptable.  What would your next course of action be?”
Andromeda answered immediately.  “Draco, please come in.”
“What is it, little duck?”
“I’ll think about it.  Will you tell me the rest of the story?”
“You’re sure you can’t think of anything you want?” Draco whispered.
“So that means you’re actually about a nine,” she said shrewdly.
“Only forward,” Mrs. Powers repeated, but she squared her shoulders, and unfolded her legs and stood.  “Then, I suppose we’d better take another look at those pamphlets of yours, Mr. Potter.”
Hearing Lara say his thoughts out loud was a jarring experience.  It made them seem all at once ridiculous and also somehow more real.  “I never said I was attracted to Harry.”
“Alright,” I say, and then, he spins, and with a disgusting squeezing sensation, we’re hurtling through blackness, and landing with a stumble outside a tidy little cottage, complete with picket fence.  Ron touches the rosebushes that are climbing up the porch steps with a fond gesture that looks habitual.
“Sure.”
“Anything is possible, but I doubt that.  Draco Malfoy is many things, but he isn’t a fool.  And anyone who isn’t delighted to know you is obviously foolish.”
Harry’s eye caught the clock on the wall and groaned.  “Ugh, look at the time, I need to get going.”
“No,” he protested.  “I want this for her, I do.  She deserves to know them.  They deserve to know how amazing she is.”  He rubbed the back of his neck.  “I’m just being a bit childish.  Feel a little left out.  Never had to do this before, yeah?”
4 Weeks
Pulling Harry closer, Draco kissed the spot, just behind his ear that turned Harry into liquid treacle.  “I have a few ideas,” he whispered.
“And how could I persuade you?” Draco didn’t mean for the teasing question to come out sounding suggestive, but once it was out there, he felt bold for a moment, and didn’t retract it.
count the sixty seconds.  Do you think you could challenge yourself to simply wait for about as long as a minute or two
Harry sighed.  Kreacher had declared unofficial war on their neighbours in Number Ten, after Mrs. Number Ten had sprayed Kreacher’s cat with a hose.  Kreacher had been incoherent with rage, and it had taken Harry nearly an entire day to talk him out of his more murderous inclinations.
“It’s a long story.  What part do you want, the happy part or the sad part?”
“I find it interesting,” Cass said.  She picked up the length, one finger gently tracing its length.  Her forehead wrinkled, and she blinked suddenly.
“Didn’t you?”  Harry was pleased that he didn’t sound bitter as he asked this, but it was a bit galling that he instead sounded childlike.
