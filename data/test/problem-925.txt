When Draco spotted Harry returning, he frowned and stopped fondling his silver band. Harry was wearing jeans and T-shirt, but unlike Draco’s similar attire, they were old, ugly, and stained. Ginny had on a short dress of black velvet and would fit in perfectly at any muggle club.
Twenty minutes later, they landed in a dirty alley. Since it was still early in the evening, Draco started their dash at a pub. Harry wore a scowl as they walked into the dim establishment and selected a table. Draco easily ignored said scowl because Harry also wore fitted black jeans, an untucked green button-down with a neatly pressed collar, and lace-up leather boots. They ordered some cheesy bread for substance and started on shots instead of mixed drinks. Except for Harry, who nursed a pint of lager.
“We have,” Snape sighed, “you are not going to like it, but we fear it is the only way to accomplish your wishes.”
Even after Malfoy slid into the seat next to Pansy and poured himself a glass of water, the rest of the hall was completely silent and motionless. It wasn't until Snape groaned out loud did the entire hall blink as one unit and process what the fuck they just saw.
"You lost me at 'muggles,'" Ron pointed out. When Harry only sighed he forced himself to continue, "Harry . . . I might not be quick on the up-take, but trust me, I will figure out a way for you to get the git back if you are willing to work with me here."
“Alright,” she started, urging him to lie back. “You seem eligible for the reversal potion I have on reserve. There are just a few routine questions . . .”
With those thoughts, Harry growled, slipped the knickers down Malfoy’s legs, past the heels, and threw them across the room.
Both men simultaneously raised their eyebrows back at her. "Not Potter . . ." they muttered and were so distracted they didn't even get mad at each other for accidentally saying the same thing.
“Look,” Draco sighed. “I have no desire to pas de deux with you if that is what you are getting at.”
Draco failed to mention that this plan gained himself more spoils than anyone else - literally if the dragon might reward him for his genius.
Draco blinked. Rapidly. A few forks clattered against plates. One of them may have been Draco's own fork. Not Zabini's fork though, Draco took care to note. Blaise happily munched on his potatoes. Hmm, Draco was suspicious of the other snake’s intentions of course, but Blaise clearly knew something that Draco was ignorant to. Draco would be a fool not to heed the warning. Draco would not fuck up whatever it was Zabini thought Draco would. That, Draco was sure of.
One more bottle split between them and Draco and Ginny made it through another two clubs. Harry, on the other hand, refused to drink any of the potion and demanded they return home at a quarter past three in the morning.
Ginny and Draco were much too wired to think about bed. Back in the living room, sprawled across the couch with their legs entwined, Draco pulled out his last bottle. They shared it.
“Sorry,” Harry gasped. He was so close already, cock straining against his jeans trying to get closer to Malfoy’s skin.
Draco didn’t know what to say. “I also wouldn’t pick something that I, too, am failing at,” Draco further explained even though he didn’t have to.
“Oh, yes, Potter!” Malfoy shouted as climax overcame him. This time, Malfoy’s powerful come shot hit Harry in the face. Harry licked his bottom lip and the taste of Malfoy’s load, along with his clenching hole, triggered Harry’s orgasm.
“Well, good.” Malfoy turned up his cute, pointy nose. Malfoy then retired to the restroom and asked Harry to save his seat. Upon returning, Malfoy received his drink and decided to sip it slower this time, for which Harry was glad.
"I am going to miss knowing what you are truly thinking," his father commented, ice and milk for himself. Draco sneered slightly at the combination, as it was horrid. "You are not the easiest child to please, let alone understand, Draco. I had figured you'd grow up at some point though, and I suppose in a way you have."
Like a hawk, Malfoy’s eyes were back on Harry, but he obeyed. Harry watched eagerly as Malfoy bent both legs up and reached down with his free hand to tease between his cheeks. “The waters all gone,” Malfoy panted. “I’ll need something . . .”
“My . . .” Madam Pomfrey blinked, her astonishment caused her magic to slip and the chair she sat on nearly flickered out of existence for a second.
Draco liked venturing into muggle London, because he could enter elite, upper-class establishments without glares that told him to exit again. Money made Draco just as important in the muggle world as it used to in the Wizarding one. Although, soon, Draco thought, I’ll have my fangs in Harry and I’ll be back where I belong.
Wand nor hand held Draco down as Potter forcibly took Draco with his cock, yet he felt stupefied as it happened; Potter sliding into the clamping heat of Draco’s arse and showing the resistance of his muscles no mercy as he began to plunge out and back in again.
His father seemed genuinely curious, but Draco couldn’t process what that could mean beyond his crushing embarrassment and real panic. So, he snapped, a bit, “yes, and it is a wonder why I am unable to properly communicate with another human being.”
"A snake," Draco said, his mouth suddenly dry. He knew that snakes could be good signs sometimes; mostly when they were stretched across the edge of a cup though, circular in shape. This snake was coiled many times yet stretched across the center. Its head was at the very bottom of the cup, the largest chunk of mugwort, sticking up and basically hissing at him.
“You heard me,” Draco replied easily. “And it was only a warning to brace yourself, Granger. If I wanted to insult you I would ask how you managed to get all your hair in that bun.”
Hence, Draco sneaking away when Harry was deep in discussion with Ronald. Draco ended up on a stoop that led to a garden. Draco was impatiently keeping track of how long it took Potter to come find him. Sure, being with Harry Potter had a lot of benefits, but Draco wasn’t so desperate to exploit them that he’d let Potter treat him as anything less than a prince.
Draco thought of the mountain of clothes, the decanter of gin in his restroom, and the four empty martini glasses strewn about random places that he could not remember. “Move out of the way, Potter,” Draco replied.
When the potion had first exploded in his face, Draco had felt like strangling Longbottom for messing up his favorite robes. A few hours later, Draco had wanted to kiss Longbottom’s hopeless arse for solving one of his biggest problems with one quick fuck up in potions.
“Is that what you're trying to do now, Potter?” Draco said slyly. “Because you don't have to buy me drinks to get me into bed with you. I would go sober and live between your sheets if you would let me.”
“Hello, there,” Potter said. His smile was shy and Draco had a sudden, strange urge to purr like a cat.
Harry waved their mess away, and then Draco stumbled out of the tiny stall with a huge grin eating his face. Draco hopped up on the sink, world spinning as he came down from the sweet high Harry had induced.
“What?” Snape snapped as he looked back and forth between Draco’s parents with narrowed eyes. “We discussed why Percy and the twins were out, but I assumed from there you would have chosen the most obvious answer: Ron Weasley.”
This narrowed his choices down greatly and Draco decided maybe the name of the potion was a pun or something, but the closest he could come up with was "Nimble Sole" which required an ingredient named “essence of lead.” Draco then was scared to try any of the three replicas he’d brewed, because it was just like his godfather to make the box self-destructible upon one failure.
Sure, one could call Harry fat, but his skin was firm, and while most people his weight would have a bit of flab, Harry was simply made up of thick, wide planes of golden skin that hid solid muscle. In fact, it was almost ironic how knobby-kneed Harry Potter had grown up to look quite like the two minions Draco had used to bully Potter for over half their lives, and which Harry had despised them for it.
They found themselves in the dungeons because Malfoy claimed he wasn’t walking up a billion bloody steps in those heels just to be disappointed by Harry Potter. Though when Malfoy had said that, Harry noticed Malfoy hadn’t let go of Harry’s hand or slowed to sneer at him even. In a lesser than great moment, the statement had resulted in Harry pointing a quick swish and flick Malfoy’s way, swooping him up, and carrying him all the way to the Slytherin portrait hole kicking and screaming.
Granger surprised Draco by laughing. “Lotion,” she said, and Draco made a face. “Sorry. I’ve had problems with other dancers before,” she went on to share, and copied Draco as he added in a few pliés to their routine.
“No, he probably does,” Ginny shook her head. “It’s just . . . Harry thinks my family is perfect. He honestly doesn’t understand how they can seem to outsiders.”
“You're delusional,” Draco was suddenly angry. “You think I want what you have to offer me? You’re never here. You can’t give me an heir. All you’d ever do is leave if you were here.”
“Become a female?” Jamie smiled, assuring Draco that she was casual with the ordeal. “Yeah, that Patrick had you under lock and key, eh?”
Ron’s plan seemed more like an attempt to murder Malfoy, but Harry had no better ideas, and he planned to blame the whole ordeal on Ron if things went south. It was like seeing Malfoy nude had caused every ounce of courage to drain from Harry’s body. It seemed like war time all over again, and Harry wasn’t sure if he could win this time round.
“Dobby is not being scared, master Draco, sir. He is not," said Dobby, though he had begun to tremble again.
"Potter," Draco drawled without turning. He couldn't have been too sure what the scarhead actually wanted from him. Unlike most of the idiot Gryffindors, Potter was yet to comment on Draco's choice of wardrobe. It was a bit . . . completely frightening waiting for the other shoe to drop. "
In the summer following his first year at Hogwarts, Draco became more familiar with the woods behind his manor - meaning he was no longer afraid to look out the white gallery windows during the daytime. He also spent a lot of time studying, when he was not in the mood to practice Occlumency against his own parents or chat with one of Owen's many portraits. The rest of his time was spent in solitude, pursuing Snape’s poem, dancing, or chasing after puny birds on his broom. True to the vow he'd made at the leaving feast, Draco planned to do everything he could to make Harry Potter’s life a living hell which, of course, included keeping Potter alive and beating him at every quidditch match in the next six years.
with Malfoy. Draco wasn’t sure what had come over Potter either, but he found himself liking every second with this new side of the Golden Boy.
"I will kill her," announced Theo, still brushing himself off. "She believes I do not have the capacity, but I swear to Merlin I will gladly shoot some green lightening right between the bitch's beady little eyes."
Draco felt Potter messing with the little clasp on his skirt. Panting, Draco bit his own lip to keep from whining aloud as Potter unfastened it, slowly bent his legs up, and slid the material completely off him. Potter gasped at the sight of Draco's matching black knickers full of something the Golden Boy surely wasn’t used to seeing. With a shaking hard, Potter stroked at the line of Draco's bulging cock after a moment of hesitation. Draco watched Potter's face as Potter touched him. He felt Potter thumb at the wet spot covering his slit and saw Potter lick his own bottom lip while he did it, like Potter was seconds away from tasting him. Potter made to bend down and Draco had to shut his eyes, thinking he couldn't have handled the sight of it. However, Potter to a sudden detour; pulled one of Draco's socks down, threw Draco’s heel clad foot over his shoulder, and was sucking on Draco's calf.
“No,” Ginny sighed out sadly. “I’ll always believe that deep down Harry’s one of the best men the world has to offer, but he doesn’t show it these days.” She suddenly smirked. “Besides, I like Quidditch players. I think watching Harry play turned me on more than snogging him.”
"Potter!" Snape boomed, his tone utterly disgusted. "The potion is supposed to end up a deep midnight purple! Twenty points from Gryffindor for blatantly ignoring my every word!"
“Ahh, Potter!” The man was about to make Draco cum again. Draco hadn’t known what it would feel while being penetrated, but he was sure—
“I’m done,” Ginny croaked, shook, and then visibly hardened. “Out for the rest of the season. Everyone knows what that means.”
A few days had passed since the Coiled-Snake-Incident in the purple potions lab and Draco was grateful for the distraction of Jean arranging an extra lesson for him to attend. Although, when Jean had told him she was taking on another student, Draco had naturally assumed it would be some nameless French witch, like always.
Harry had a feeling Malfoy wasn’t talking about Harry anymore. So, he kept quiet and listened as Malfoy continued his ranting.
. She'd been meaning to ask the headmaster why they didn't study this sort of magical philosophy there at Hogwarts. It was quite interesting. Though, today, it looked like she would have other matters to deal with instead.
and the one who only days ago was on his knees, moaning from the sound of your commanding voice. I found myself compelled to write you, my dear antagonist, if only to sooth my own hot desires . . ."
It felt so odd for some reason, and Draco was soon distracted trying to remember the last time he'd hugged his father. He knew he had before yet couldn't remember the last time. Before he'd even noticed that time had passed his father had pulled away and studied Draco's face with serious eyes.
“Are you insane!?” Draco shrieked quietly. “And just what will you do after that, Dobby? You will have nowhere to go, I hope you realize . . .”
The men glared at her, both having had to obliviate several people for the sake of their forms, Draco knew, he'd read that in the journal they’d given him before first year.
"None of this makes sense!" claimed Ron, but he was ignored completely as Harry stood and made to cross the hall.
Ginny seemed in awe, but pleased. Harry, on the other hand, seemed as if he may be suffering from an aneurism.
His father gave a bitter laugh. "I realize I made a huge mistake, but do not go and get all high and mighty acting like you haven’t hidden just as many dark objects around this place."
Apparently, the boy had seemed to take an 'interest' in Draco at lunch, and then the two disappeared together. Snape had a feeling Potter was up to no good. It didn't seem like Harry Potter to take such a trick too far, Snape knew Potter would never go there, but Snape didn't doubt that he could still very well go far enough to hurt Draco, today of all days.
. He hates being called a freak, I know that. Just . . . look, let us worry about what you shouldn’t say, okay? That is most important.” It really wasn’t . . .
“I think I can deal with that,” Potter answered cryptically and went right back to attacking Draco’s neck, and Draco couldn’t find the will to push Potter’s wet lips away from his skin twice.
Draco broke off,  and failed to mention how recent the development was compared to his time dancing at this studio. He did not want to think about what Jean’s diminishing presence in her own lessons might mean. Or how this past school year she had seemed to age forty years in his absence. Or how he would have to leave her alone next school year as well.
“Mmm, Potter,” Malfoy wriggled, impatient, as he smacked Harry’s hand away from himself, placed said hand back on his own nipple, and then reached to run elegant fingers down the length of Harry’s straining hardness. Harry very nearly died for a moment but got the point.
Harry froze, but didn’t push Malfoy away. Surely Malfoy wouldn’t fuck Harry twice as some kind of joke? Once maybe . . . but twice?
"Shh," she chastised him with a serious expression of displeasure and disgust. "You will upset the nargles."
After another shot, and finishing the rest of his routine, Draco sauntered from the warm room with his blond hair pinned in a tasteful bun at the back of his head. He dressed in casual, but expensive muggle clothes, and packed his satchel for a day at his favorite café.
Harry only had so much willpower. Malfoy was everything Harry wanted in a sexual partner, and Malfoy claimed that Harry was everything he wanted -- well, minus the man tits. Harry would let him come over, and if Malfoy changed his mind, Harry could always sleep on the recliner and let Malfoy have his futon.
“No,” he laughed. “But the night has just begun. You looked to need a pick-me-up. Come on. We’re moving on after one last drink.”
“Do not even speak to me, you bloody filthy fucking bird!” his father hissed, and Draco’s eyes widened, having only heard his father use such language one other time. “This is all
“So, if we did fuck, you would get naked? And let me touch you wherever I wanted without asking for permission?”
"Merlin, Potter!" Malfoy snapped as he quickly righted himself and sat down with a straight back on the edge of the bed. "Couldn't even bother to take off my shoes," he sneered as he unlaced one and placed it gently on the floor. Though Harry noted that the other one was suspiciously absent already. Harry would find that other shoe if it was the last thing he did . . . in a few moments that was.
“Of course not,” Draco snorted out a laugh, perhaps a bit more drunk than he’d realized. “The one thing you should be prideful about you seem embarrassed about.”
Well, the entire hall may have sparked with chatter at that point, but Harry found himself stuck in the blinking stage of processing this new information. He felt as if everything he had ever learned was a lie. Harry felt manipulated, cheated, and wronged. Across from Harry, Ron grinned manically with a gleam of pure amusement in his eye. Harry could only blink back at his best mate.
“Alright, where to then, Malfoy?” Harry asked as he stopped them in front of his motorbike and began to strap his helmet on Malfoy’s head.
“Thank you,” Draco practically moaned as he took a large gulp. He usually drank dry, not dirty ones but at this point he would have settled for gin straight from the bottle. “I can see why you need alcohol around here. Your family is – is – is – “
“Look, I don’t exactly know what you want from me, but surely you’re not worried about Harry hurting Malfoy’s feelings, are you?” Hermione asked, worried about exactly the opposite.
“What? No!” protested Draco, and then realized that he’d wasted a perfectly good chance to do just that. “I am only curious, Granger,” he continued in a haughty manner. “I have heard muggles are quite violent, especially while drunk.
Draco saw Harry Potter approaching the Slytherin table from miles away, but Draco acted like he hadn't noticed the other until Potter had cleared his throat right behind him.
“Snuck out?” Draco laughed. “Right. I couldn’t have just walked from the room without anyone noticing. I was trying to be sneaky. Of course.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Also, I’m not plastered, Potter. I was plastered last night at the pub. Now I’m feeling considerably tipsy.”
This time it was Harry who barked out, “rules, Malfoy?” Harry paused to calm himself and used some of his radiating energy to conjure a chair which he pulled to the tub side and sat in, leaning over Malfoy as far as he could. “This isn’t about those things you like. I’m not touching you. I won’t. This is just about something you and I want. Something we both want to do. Now . . .” Harry flicked his wand and the water in Malfoy’s tub disappeared. “Do it.”
Hermione frowned and gestured to her homework. “Then what exactly can I help you with?” she asked, feeling extremely guilty.
Granger took a step back like the word had forced her to do it. A sign of a dark sale thought Draco, smugly. She swallowed before she spoke again.
"I am serious, Draco," Luna continued over him. "You sound like the odd school boy who always wins at marbles."
See, Potter, he’d never showed much inclination toward anyone, but especially not the same sex. Draco was ninety-four percent sure that the Golden Boy was as straight as they came. Draco was also sure that even if Potter was gay he would never go for an ex-Death Eater who had made his life hell for years.
Draco had finally had a breakthrough with the potion from Snape’s game the day prior - he’d narrowed the key down to three potions. They all glowed green before the last ingredient was added then turned blood red, and none of them had any kind of fish or insect ingredients, though all were made with many natural ingredients that would give the potion an earthy taste.
“Potter!” Malfoy startled him from his thoughts. “You absolute tosser! How dare you sneak up on me.”
as loud as he could but Theo continued over him-- "I may not know what exactly is going on, but I do know that if Potter's involved then you must be too."
Draco was more like his mother, in that his father had no problem taking risks. He even found the betting pools the house elves had going to be humorous, when Draco's mother swore they only encouraged stealing and therefore beating. His mother was always thinking before she acted and not saying much, which was why the scene before Draco baffled him to such a high extent.
Potter flailed awake and somehow managed to pull a wand out of Draco's arse along with his soft little, Potter cock. Pansy stopped herself from making a comment, even as he aimed the wand at her. Draco, it seemed, didn't wake up until he'd smacked the floor and that, Pansy had to comment on.
Draco found an empty, if slightly dirty table, and claimed it. He couldn’t see Harry, but Ginny’s red hair was easy to spot. Tapping his fingers to the beat, Draco waited patiently for his company to return. He was all smile, simply pleased to be back in one of his favorite places.
“Fuck, Potter,” Malfoy growled. “You weren’t exaggerating, were you? You’ve got rock hard abs under those rolls.”
“We need only look at the fault in Severus’ initial resolution to determine what we have to do,” his father explained, even though Draco had the feeling his mother was now ten steps ahead all on her own. “There is only one way to ensure the Gryffindors do not disregard it or do as he would have done and chucked it into the high sea - or,” here his father paused to chuckle, “Gods forbid, simply attempted to break its curse.”
“I do,” Draco lied to both Dobby and himself. “And your failure wouldn’t matter so much if we had more time. Look, we can be done for today, but you are going to help Linky and I with our search again tonight, okay, Dobby?”
Then his father was rounding the table, pulled his mother in for a huge kiss--it was the first time Draco had ever seen them kiss, he realized this in a state of strong disgust and fascination--and took both Snape and his mother by the hand and led them out of the room. His mother only smiled fondly. Apparently more than happy to let her husband handle her plan from there on out.
Draco strode purposely over and picked the cup up, but still did not see much. He turned it over in his hands, right then left, and gasped as he suddenly saw the only symbol there; belatedly he realized he'd dropped the cup entirely. Linky saved it from crashing to the floor and hovered it back to the table.
She conjured a chair and summoned her writing pad and quill. Draco watched as she jotted down a few things. She did not look up as she spoke.
The next club they stepped into was nothing like Lindy’s had been. The whole area—from the forty-foot ceiling to the dance floor to the bar that wrapped around three-fourths of the perimeter—was alit with a neon phosphorescent glow. Writhing bodies molded to the wobbly beat spun by a shirtless DJ who was raised up high so everyone could see him even through the mass of dancers.
Harry lived on the top floor, so they only had to walk down one flight of stairs and they were in Harry’s living area. Harry threw his jacket on the kitchen counter, walked over to the futon, and laid it down flat so it was wide enough to fit both of them. Harry sat down and tried not to let the rolls on his belly show now that he didn’t have a jacket to hide them.
“No,” Draco said firmly. “Not pathetic. I just always thought you were so confident, even after you’d gained the weight. You never let what people say bother you.”
“You’re truly bloody sick for this one, Malfoy!” Potter shouted as soon as the door had been warded.
Ron channeled his inner-Hermione and silently counted backward from ten. In that time, Harry opened his mouth, closed it and opened it again.
"You do realize," Theo drawled once the creature was out of sight, "that you have just written twelve inches and failed apologize one time."
“Mmmmalfoy!” groaned Potter as he jerked within Draco and came. Draco pressed back into Potter’s throbbing swell as his own body began to shake in orgasm. He whimpered around the intense pleasure Potter’s cock gave to him with every weakening thrust. Fuzzy warmth grew from within Draco and soaked the space between them as he milked Potter empty.
Although somewhat expected, no one could have predicted his weapon of choice, as Ronald Weasley had tried to run Draco through with a garden spade. Granger had spent every second since Draco’s advent suspiciously scrutinizing him. Arthur Weasley attempted to lure Draco into a dingy old shed for lock up. Ha! As if Draco could ever be tempted by something stupid and muggle. George Weasley had mocked Draco’s artful bun and in return received a nasty hex. Charlie Weasley tricked Draco into a false sense of security with his kind words, and then thumped Draco on the back so hard he nearly split in two. Bill Weasley ignored Draco completely, in favor of chasing around his ill-mannered child. Fleur Weasley turned up her nose as she daintily shook Draco’s hand. Clearly, the witch was jealous. Even with Veela allure on her side, Draco was much more attractive.
Even though he never finished, Draco had a potions lab in his flat and still practiced from time to time (mainly brewing Hangover Droughts). However, the potion he and Ginny were relying on for the dash was beyond Draco’s skill set. The creator was a mudblood who had somehow managed to magically enhance the effects of a muggle drug called MDMA.
“Oh my--fuck--Potter,” Draco breathed instead. In that moment, Draco couldn’t have said if he was completely relaxed and only being supported by Potter or if every muscle in his body was flexed tight. All Draco knew was Potter’s cock, his own arse hole, and the rush of prickly heat washing over his neck and back.
“Fuck,” Draco said. Draco really liked Harry, but Draco would not get himself into another relationship where he had to change to make his partner happy.
“What I believe Narcissa is trying to say, Severus, is that Ronald Weasley dorms with Harry Potter, does he not? That is one sure way to involve the Potter boy in this plan when we could easily avoid the unnecessary risk toward Draco altogether. For, if our assumptions are correct, this piece of Lord Voldemort would not know anything about Harry Potter. The threat should not directly harm Potter, and Dumbledore, if he has a shred of decency left, will be forced to play his hand without his wild card.”
“No,” Draco explained, then left Harry stewing as he read Luna’s message. Still need? It said, and Draco smirked. “It looks like one, though. Excuse me, I need to use the loo.”
Harry broke their glaring contest and looked at the ground. “I . . . was caught up trying to prove a point. I thought Draco finally started a conversation with someone.”
Yeah, wow, Harry couldn’t believe he’d just admitted that to Draco Malfoy of all people, but to Harry’s surprise Malfoy didn’t take the piss.
"I do not have time for your nonsense right now, Luna!" Draco pointed out and turned back toward Theo. "I will have to apologize a little."
“I meant she,” Draco emphasized. “Jamie’s transitioned. I met him up here before I dated Patrick. I knew Jamie when he was fully a guy still.”
“And,” Ginny cut in as Draco and Harry began to glare at one another. “You, Harry, didn’t notice! Hell, we finished off that whole bottle before you came looking.”
“Oh yes,” Draco assured. “I reconnected with an old friend named Jamie. He—she’s the one who scared Harry.”
She sighed. “Locks work perfectly fine for my family. We live in a good neighborhood, which helps, I suppose. We only had a break in once when I was very little, and nobody had been home. My father has been considering getting one of these recently developed ‘security systems’ that sense the doors and windows using a digital monitor.”
Ron took pity on his friend even though it was always funny to see Harry turn so pink. "You want to be spanked by Malfoy?"
Potter stared at him for a moment before he began to chuckle gleefully. “You’re alright, Malfoy,” he announced, then turned to Pomfrey. “Do you think we could do the test now and decide from there?”
"You did slice him up," Ron pointed out carefully, not sure where Harry was going with this sudden torture dilemma.
“We aren’t though, are we? Dumbledore knows just as much as we do, doesn’t he, Severus?” his mother asked coolly. “Anyone could know now. We cannot begin assuming such things like loyalty."
“Let’s do a shot,” Draco said as he picked up one of the small glasses. “Then I want to go investigate. Stay here with the table for a minute.”
His best mate only stared back at him, looking as haunted as one would expect of somebody who was just virtually sexually-harassed by Malfoy.
“Don't get your man tits in a twist, Potter. I'm nice these days,” Malfoy said, and nudged Harry with his bony shoulder.
Draco laughed aloud, wondering which of the flamboyant boys had managed to scare off the man who’d defeated the Dark Lord.
The admission excited Draco a little too much and he sank down too fast; the head of Potter’s cock popping inside him all at once and what felt like inches more. Though, most likely wasn't due to how small the movement had been. The feel of Harry stunned Draco at first and he tensed up, but it seemed Potter was coiled just as tight. Draco didn’t understand how it could have possibly burned that much after being so stretched by those wonderful Potter fingers. Plus, Draco wanted it so bad and he’d felt so ready and needy beforehand.
"I do not like girls,” Draco said, as he slouched further into his large leather chair. Draco didn't feel smart.
“Oh, fun!” Luna exclaimed. “I thought you just wanted to stop wallowing in self-pity over Patrick, but I see you’ve found another suitable distraction.”
His mother sounded exasperated, but completely serious. Draco gaped in her direction, and wondered if she’d gone crazy for saying such a thing in front of his father--
“Perfection!” Ginny laughed out the word with delight, and hopped up on the coffee table to twirl around.
Snape’s day went on much better after that and he returned to potions class highly disturbed, but slightly amused. Harry continued fucking his fingers in and out of Malfoy none the wiser, and Draco was really mortified that his Godfather the Death Eater had just seen him agreeing to bottom for Harry Potter, but the humility didn’t stop him from pushing himself back and riding Potter’s fingers, not even for a second.
“Sorry, Draco,” Jamie said. “I’ve got to deal with this. Don’t get lost again, okay? I’m off next weekend, come back.”
Malfoy, in the same arrogant way as always, glided toward the Slytherin table like not a thing possibly could have been amiss. His pointy nose was so turned up it was practically perpendicular to the ceiling and he still wore that snotty little sneer on his face.
It was easy for Draco to focus on the good parts of the full feeling in his arse with Harry's hand stroking his cock. Soon enough, the pain faded, and Draco found himself relaxing again. Instead of waiting for Potter to thrust into him, Draco slowly lowered himself a little bit at a time. It still hurt but Draco didn’t have time to be put off, because before he knew it he’d bottomed Harry Potter out, and his stretched-out rim rested against Potter’s wild, untrimmed pubes. God, Draco preened at the thought and had a fleeting urge to comment on what his father would have said about it.
“I don’t know,” Ginny cut in. “Harry can be pretty prideful when he’s drunk. Better hope no one picks a fight with him.”
Noticing that both their glasses were already empty, Ginevra summoned a shaker, the fifth of gin, vermouth, and olivebrine. She swiftly caught one item after the next, and then went about mixing a new batch. Draco was impressed with her hand-eye coordination and could easily see how she’d become such a successful athlete.
The movement had Draco’s vision flashing white, and he may have mewled a bit pathetically as Harry kept hitting that sweet spot inside of him. Draco gave in and just bounced then. As fast as he could have. The friction felt like it was starting a fire inside him and the flames were pooling low in his gut.
Draco prepared his mix and warmed the kettle over his cauldron fire. He invited Linky in when the water was nearly boiling, and she transfigured a table and chairs for herself, Draco, and Bear to sit around. Draco didn't even need to remind her for their customary cups and carefully divided the crushed leaves into each when they appeared on the table.
Draco apparated near the café, strolled in the front door, and ignored the queue as he sat as his usual table.
Theo's eyes narrowed further. "I wouldn't be so smug if I were you, Draco," he warned. "Pansy stole information on Potter--" here Draco startled to his feet with wide eyes and groaned
Draco would need to add the "Eye of Newt" then. He couldn't doubt it for a second, he was right. There was not one path of solid reasoning behind his choice, he just knew.
The clatter of wooden doors against a stone wall caused Harry to twitch and turn toward the entrance way. It was Draco Malfoy who strode into the Great Hall for breakfast, and Harry sat stunned as his eyes followed the lone figure. Though Harry was not alone in his stupefied state. It seemed the entire hall, students and professors alike, had taken a collective gasp and were terrified to let any air back out.
Free this time, Draco tried to find purchase on the surface beneath him as Potter slid his panties aside and used his swollen head to play with the juicy hole between Draco’s welcoming lips. Draco reveled in the roughness in which Potter was able to take him without preparation. Draco whined as Potter began to thrust urgently.
Theo stopped Draco only once, as he had learned how important Draco's creative process could be (to Draco at least); however he couldn't just let this last comment slide.
Harry took off down the street. Malfoy’s startled shout quickly turned into surprised laughter when the bike suddenly lurched off the ground and began to fly. They made it to Harry’s flat in no time and Harry landed the bike on the roof. Once Malfoy hopped off, Harry did the same and slowly pushed the bike into the small shed he’d built for it up there.
Potter looked up at him with lost eyes that Draco couldn’t decipher, but it seemed that Potter got the point as he gripped Draco’s hips, guided Draco up, and lined his cock with Draco’s hole. Potter paused to flick the tip against Draco’s stretched rim a few times before he gently pressed in.
Malfoy moved on to Harry’s jeans. Once those were off, Harry held his breath as Draco slowly brought the fabric of Harry’s pants over his aching cock. Harry didn’t realize he’d squeezed his eyes shut again until Draco spoke.
Four days later, when Draco was writing in the garden, his father approached but froze for a long moment and scrutinized the journal in Draco’s hands. The look on his father's face was more than enough to snap Draco out of whatever stupor he’d been in and alert him to the enormous size of his own cock up.
Besides, Draco had never denied that he could be a bit manipulative himself. Patrick, on the other hand, had claimed ignorance in constantly using words to mold Draco’s feelings toward him. Patrick didn’t attend Hogwarts, having moved from America in his late teens, but Draco would bet anything the Sorting Hat would label him Slytherin. Any time Draco would ask Patrick to remove his shirt, Patrick’s huffy mood and self-pitiful words would cause Draco to lose determination. Draco’s parents may have made a few mistakes, but one thing Draco was sure they did right was marrying each other. As his mother had told him when he first started dating Patrick: partnerships are not supposed to make you feel that way.
Jamie laughed, clearly remembering Harry. “Oh, that one was precious . . . and handsome,” Jamie smirked. “You always did have a type.”
Just when Draco had been sure it couldn’t get any worse, Molly Weasley walked in from the kitchen and saw Draco cowering like a hunted rabbit in the middle of her pack of savage weasels.
“Screw off, Potty,” Draco sneered when the bartender walked off to make his drink. “This is the shit I’m talking about. Just because I look like this doesn’t mean I need a man to run my fucking life. In case you haven’t noticed, I am a man, too!”
Potter retrieved a pan from the kitchen, hooked their arms together and sucked Draco along to the Weasleys.
“Don’t do that. I don’t want pity. I want to fucking party and forget I’ll be stuck in this house for the foreseeable future.”
The first thing Harry heard when he walked into the pub was Draco Malfoy’s obnoxious voice. The first thing Harry thought upon hearing said voice was that he should turn around and find another place to drink tonight. However, he paused his backward step when he realized Malfoy was quite sloshed and seemed to be talking to himself mostly. Even as the bartender pretended to listen for a moment, Malfoy kept chatting when the man had to walk away to take another order.
Narcissa’s eyes shot to Snape again and she said, "thank you for reminding me, Lucius. Sit, Severus, or I promise I will do you worse than I did my husband for that one."
Malfoy reached for the tap, and Harry snapped from his haze. “Don’t,” he said, already moving to hand Malfoy his towel. “Clean up with this and get dressed.”
"And you think Malfoy is your solution?" Ron was still flabbergasted but he wasn't about to try and change Harry's mind this late in the game. Slowly Harry shook his head. "Well, fine," Ron sighed and turned back toward pieces. "Here's Malfoy and here's you--" he paused to place a black queen and a white knight on opposite sides of the board "--first obstacle: responding to the letter." Ron added a few pieces between to represent each problem they may face, including a black knight for Pansy. "Now, here's what I think you should do . . ."
“Good.” Draco placed the jelly-legged elf on his bum. “Now, you may breathe, but if you get us caught in here, I swear to the Gods that not even my father will be able to save you. I will . . . will . . . stab you to death, Dobby!”
“That’s not . . .” Harry trailed off, realizing that Malfoy was probably right. Most of Harry’s previous partners had looked at his cock with disappointment but were squealing by the time Harry was done with them. “Shit. I’m sorry, Malfoy. I didn’t mean to push you so hard.”
“I love it!” Draco assured. “You’re beautiful! I just can’t believe I’ve been gone long enough for you to . . .” Draco trailed off and looked around, not sure if he should finish his sentence in case it was offensive.
"Our animagus forms for one, which we have somehow managed to keep a secret since we were at Hogwarts!" snapped Snape.
“Say,” Draco started. “What would you wear if you were going on a date with someone you wanted to impress, but the date was at a poor person’s house?”
Draco and Ginny cackled and gave a high five. Latching one hand to Harry’s limp leg and the other around Ginny’s arm, Draco sucked them all back to his place.
“It was lovely,” he’d replied with a soft smile in her direction, completely dishonest and hating it. “Delightful truly.”
“It’s so . . . pretty,” Harry mumbled. Malfoy, who hadn’t met Harry’s eye, suddenly looked straight at him, and Harry found the eager, almost innocent expression just as shocking as Malfoy’s cute little hole had been.
Malfoy lounged in the tub. He liked to fit in a midday soak to relieve tension, Harry had learned. Having already washed his hair that morning, Malfoy’s head hung off the rounded edge. Harry couldn’t see from his angle, but he imagined the softly hanging blond strands were the slightest bit sweaty.
Malfoy eagerly slipped his fingers inside, and Harry bit his lip as two long digits began to work open the tight muscles of Malfoy’s backside. As he began to stroke his swell once more, Malfoy grew more animate than Harry had ever seen him. Moans and curses fell from Malfoy’s red mouth, and his body quivered and misshaped in his urge to please himself.
There was a knock on the door and Draco froze in his useless pacing. The only person he was expecting a visit from was Pansy - and the bitch certainly wouldn't come knocking.
“Like you plan to let me go any time soon?” Draco said, half hopeful. Potter hadn’t let him go two days without a fuck since they’d started this ordeal.
Draco had only blinked. He had been unconscious for his birthday, he’d realized this on the train when Pansy asked him if he’d truly enjoyed her present.
Then Draco came harder than he ever had in his life. Harry instantly stilled and throbbed inside Draco, who, in his drunken state could have used a few more minutes to thoroughly sate him. Oh whatever, Draco thought, we will just have to work on Harry’s stamina.
Yes . . . Draco needed to figure out what was going on as soon as possible. When he was finally able to step into his room, Draco paced for a moment before steeling himself.
“You want to let the thing loose in Hogwarts,” his mother guessed before he could finish, and Draco’s father nodded once, curt as could be.
“Surely you know a spell?” Harry hadn’t, until he’d stood in Malfoy’s bedroom and watched him wank two days ago. He said nothing however, and pointed his wand toward the precious furl.
Draco shrugged and made grabby hands at his satchel that was slung across Harry’s chest. Harry didn’t seem to understand, and brought his whole self to slot between Draco’s parted legs.
“He’s changed so much,” Ginny muttered, looking after Harry as he leaned against the bar waiting for service. “Physically and mentally.”
“Well, not everything. Just the essentials. However, I forbid you to mention the Malfoys, any of us. I forbid you to mention the details of what the Horcrux will do or what it is if you are somehow still hiding that knowledge from me or we find out. Just say a bad, bad thing is coming for Hogwarts. I am sure Potter will be pleased with an extended vacation. He isn’t much for studying, I’ve noticed, more for space-staring.”
Draco had finally had enough. “Excuse me,” Draco said as he removed her from his person. “I am a perfect specimen of the human body, as you can clearly see. I can only assume you were being purposefully obtuse, to make your sons feel better about their lesser beauty.”
“Oh!” Ginny paused her dancing, catching on to the idea. “Yes! And then I wouldn’t have to stay at the burrow. It could be us together like this all the time.”
“Nothing—“ Draco started to say but was cut off by a hot pocket. “Oh, goody!” Draco squealed and pulled out his communication device.
Harry had been avoiding the fit blond tosser ever since he’d quit Auror training to become a woodworker. Now that Harry had gained so much weight, he practically ran from the vicinity any time he heard Malfoy’s voice. However, Harry couldn’t keep his interest of the other at bay, despite his own cowardly avoidance. Any time Draco was in the paper Harry read the articles. Harry had been surprised to find out that Malfoy was gay and open about it. The press had gotten many photos of him and his lover, who looked to be bigger than Harry, which was hard when Harry weighed 20 stone these days. Perhaps this knowledge was what allowed Harry to approach Malfoy tonight. Harry felt the need to know if Malfoy had somehow been taking the piss with his lover or if he truly liked the large man.
It was time to consult the leaves, Draco told himself again, and tried to ignore the pull in his gut when he thought of his mother. He grimaced but began to ready his mind, still absently wondering if his new skills in Occlumency would aid or hinder his Divination talent. Draco knew that he couldn't be thinking about failure though. He had to be positive that this cup of disgusting leaves was about to grant him the knowledge he needed. Draco could deem them revolting, but he couldn't opine them vacuous; that had been his mother's first ever Divination lesson.
Draco fought to make his mind as clear as possible for everything except blind panic as he had already met his father’s eyes long enough to be invaded.
“Sorry lads, no men allowed,” then she spotted Ginny behind their shoulders. “Cute redhead is more than welcomed though.”
Draco moaned Harry’s name over and over, unable to help himself, and not truly wanting to stop either. Harry’s movements grew bolder with every gasp of his name, and soon Draco found his face pressed against the cool metal of the stall with Harry a pressing and groping presence against his backside. Thick hands worked diligently, one grabbing Draco’s hair to bare his neck, the other slipping inside his trousers and parting his arse cheeks.
A sloppy pop and, “you sleep like the dead,” Malfoy said, and then startled Harry by crawling up his body until Malfoy’s arse rested against Harry’s cock.
“Nughh, Potter,” Malfoy hissed as Harry sucked on his neck and continued unbuttoning Malfoy’s white shirt, which was now wrinkled from being smashed between Harry’s body and what Harry hoped was Malfoy’s bed.
with your cousin. Who is three years older than you and should have known better." His father sighed. “You were always so smart and interested in learning new things, yet . . . the
“Well . . .” his mother made a get on with it gesture and raised her brows. “You told me you have finally decided on a course of action.”
“Let’s talk about yours,” she sneered back at him, suddenly falling into a position Draco had never heard of before -  held demi bras with her leg still out behind, bent to ninety degrees at the knee. “You aren’t a girl, Malfoy, and you are never going to be able to lift anyone with a figure like that. Why isn’t Ms. Jean on you about it?”
Draco frowned. Surely, they wouldn’t have fired one of the regular bartenders and hired a female. Perhaps they’d needed more bartenders and couldn’t find a hunky gay man and had to settle?
By the time they reached their next destination, the water bottles were empty. Harry and Gunny eyed the long queue skeptically, but Draco ignored it and cut to the front.
"My thoughts exactly . . . of course, this will call for utter bluntness as Potter has a bit of trouble understanding sometimes," Draco drawled and gestured around the room at large until he was pointing back at himself. "Lucky for Potter, he deals with a wizard who has never been on the best of terms with the Tact Fairy."
“Well, of course, I am an exception to most ideals as I easily exceed them. And I have a better leg line than you do, so . . .”
The first time Draco had lunch with his parents upon his return, his mother had paused him mid-bite by asking him how he’d liked his birthday presents.
"Dinner's in ten minutes and Theo said he'd really like to be able to change out of his robes without life scarring next time," Pansy relayed and then stepped out of the room. "Oh," she called then popped her head back in, "and Blaise said twenty points to Slytherin for not fucking it up, Draco."
Slowly, Draco lifted his legs over the bench, crossed them, and faced the Boy Who Lived. "Potter, that was the worst insult I've ever heard," said Draco, still sappy slow, as he placed his elbows behind him on the table and leaned back.
“Well, I say you’ve found yourself!” Malfoy smiled, then quickly frowned. “You know, my--well, now--ex-boyfriend, Patrick, had always been heavier. He had a hard time accepting my affection, and I tried so hard to put up with the constant reassurance, but it’s hard when he gets so angry at me for no reason. Are you like that, Potter?”
"No! Merlin, no, Ron." Harry had jumped up only to sink down to Ron's new level kneeling on the floor, hands grabbing at the sides of his own baggy jeans. "I couldn't explain why at the time, but I think this is it. Our sex--er, sorry--was not good. I mean, I've never really done it with anyone else but I'm pretty sure it was a disaster."
Then Potter moved and Draco couldn’t think at all. He slid down Draco’s body with the sort of grace he only had in the air, smeared his cum all between them before attaching his mouth right to Draco’s used pussy, and then began to use his tongue. Draco had no clue if Potter was good or not but they very idea had Draco twitching into Potter in minutes (well, after Draco had strategically grabbed on to Potter's wild tufts and set his own crazed pace using the whole lower half of Potter's stubble-lined face).
Draco had to break the kiss and roughly squeeze at the base of his own cock, because his plan was failing already. He couldn’t have helped it, because that was Potter’s cock he felt against his backside. Harry Potter’s perfect cock that was lubed up now, rubbing against his arse, and ever so slightly pushing against his rim. It was the cock that Draco was about to fuck, a cock that was going to be inside him any second. Draco whined without meaning to. He just couldn’t believe that Potter was actually going through with it. That Potter actually wanted to fuck him.
Draco was over the moon. He’d just stepped into his flat, having whooshed through Harry Potter’s floo. The smile fled Draco’s face as he registered the state of his living quarters and remembered the fight that had driven him to the pub last night.
"Okay," said Potter, before he suddenly leaned down into Draco's personal space. Draco smelled sweaty tang, broomsticks, and burnt wood all before Potter's mouth reached Draco's ear and he whispered, "have you got on knickers, Malfoy?" quietly enough that Draco was sure not even Pansy had heard what he'd said.
Draco stroked the shaft briefly before he took it in his mouth. Potter moaned as Draco swallowed the swell with practiced ease. Too soon Draco found himself yanked back to his feet.
Draco was huddled with Linky and Dobby under the invisibility cloak when a noise was heard. Two seconds later the frozen trio was revealed to the dark hallway and Draco saw his father standing with the cloak in his grasp, eyebrows raised.
Harry managed to bring an arm up and run his fingers through Malfoy’s mused hair as he watched Malfoy balancing over him with just the very tip of Harry’s dick inside of him. Even without his glasses, Harry realized that Malfoy's own dick had started to soften, and he forced himself to trail his hand down Malfoy’s body until he reached Malfoy’s cock. Harry wrapped it up and slowly started stroking with as much strength as he could have mustered with his trembling arm.
Draco's father suddenly started to laugh. Under the cloak, Draco was as startled as Snape seemed. "You were bluffing," his father said to his mother.
“More than,” Potter dove in and crashed lips against Draco’s own. The kiss was not their first, but it felt like it for how little of times they’d actually locked in such an embrace. Their tongues' slid hesitantly together, just breaching each other’s mouths enough to feel the smooth bite of teeth. The slack drained from Draco’s cock as he was once again buried under the heavy rutting of Potter’s persistent hardness.
A few days later Draco was coming from the cloud room when he noticed the sound of Snape’s robe as it was dramatically whipped around Snape’s angry form. It was a very distinct noise Draco would not soon forget. After retrieving his cloak and boots, Draco stepped around a few places his guardians usually took tea.
“I am so sorry,” Draco suddenly burst. “For hating you so much. I don’t know how I could ever do the things I did. I am so stupid.”
Draco hissed and had Linky burn the note to the land of the dead (he’d had his fill of forbidden books, thanks). Draco then placed the lockbox under his bed and the book in Linky's keeper, too angry that he'd wasted so much of his precious summertime slaving for a bloody book to even think about reading it. Instead he returned to his potions lab to check on the leaves, hoping there would be something interesting in Bear’s reading this time.
His father blinked, face returning to a calm mask, but his father was never too good at guarding his eyes . . . or so Draco’s mother had always said, and Draco was starting to understand what she meant. Snapping out his wand, Draco’s father banished the journal to somewhere else before taking a deep breath and pulling Draco into a tight hug. Draco was speechless and tense with confusion and didn't hug back, but his father didn't seem to care. When Draco finally worked out that he wasn't about to get his arse stung for the next three weeks straight, he weakly returned his father's embrace.
Malfoy paused, seemed to contemplate, then all at once began to move. Harry took in the compromising position with escalating shock. Feet tucked under his arse, Malfoy used one hand hold his cheeks apart and the other to lift his sack out of the way. Hairless and pinked, Harry couldn’t quite believe what he was staring at.
When the robe was finally removed, Potter manipulated them so Draco’s skirt exposed his pussy to the feel of Potter’s hard, rubbing cock. With a finger, Potter prodded around the thin cotton of Draco’s panties. Draco tensed as the rough print and nail made contact with his soaked skin. He tried to pull away and Potter had to use both hands to hold him against the desk again.
Harry heard a nasty snicker from behind and his eyes instantly flicked back to Malfoy's face . . . then Malfoy’s thighs. Snape was completely forgotten to Harry for the rest of the day.
Maybe too great of a time, after all the dash was not about forgetting your woes in a bed full of cock.
His father didn't answer. His mother banished the journal and cast a silencing charm on the room, but it didn't matter as Draco was already stood inside it when the magic passed the threshold.
“I wanted to.” Draco gave Potter a cautious smirk. “Why wouldn’t I wish to know . . . certain things . . . about you—“
Having never slept with a woman, Draco wasn’t too sure how they actually acted when the panties came off, but he assumed they laid back and took it, right? Because straight guys had to like them for a specific reason or else it wouldn’t matter, surely. So that’s what Draco had planned to do but the second he’d seen Potter’s thick member so ready and hard all for him, Draco had lost all pretense.
“Owen!” Draco shouted, and the man woke with a violent jerk that nearly pushed him into a neighboring frame. “How are you?” Draco asked, all innocence.
It was only lying there with Potter still slumped over him, panting and sweating, that Draco wondered how serious his condition might be. Draco could hurry and see Madam Pomfrey tonight, or he could let the potion run its course. At least for one more day. It might be worth the shame to stroll into the Great Hall for breakfast, sit in his normal seat, and watch Potter’s face as he realized his one-night stand had actually been Draco Malfoy.
Draco fell pliant between the metal door and Harry’s big body. Instantly, his pores began to fill with sweat again and he could feel his face blushing hot from arousal. The moment Harry touched him, Draco’s blood had began to fill his trapped cock. Now, as their hips banged together in a drunken dance, Draco felt like a steel bat ready to swing.
Draco smirked and began to read out loud as he wrote, "Dear Potter -- It is me, Draco Malfoy, your forever
“Wait, Potter,” Malfoy said, and Harry stilled, his mouth hovering right over Malfoy’s Adam’s apple as he felt long fingers grip his wrist. “Why are you really doing this?” he whispered, and Harry pulled back to look at him with a confused frown. “I’m not a girl, Potter, you know that right? I mean . . . call me a girl all you like, I’m just saying I dress and act however I feel like and that’s not going to change just because Harry Potter likes me in a skirt. Sometimes, I don't want to wear a skirt and well . . . even when I do I’m not a different person. Like at all.”
Linky and Dobby were both helping prepare the manor for Draco’s birthday party or he would have made one of them occupy him.
“Yes,” Ginny agreed while nodding her head frantically. At this point, she was more smile than face, not quite as tolerant as Draco was to the drug. “I love you both so much! Don’t ever change!”
“But . . . why?” Severus sneered. “Why even risk it? We know now that Potter destroyed a Horcrux-like person—or thing—without draining either of their powers.”
As he was drifting to sleep that night, a sleepy thought crossed through Draco’s mind. Maybe . . . Narcissus was trapped in . . . just like . . . Draco would ask Owen tomorrow . . . probably.
"Well, I was naked and there was a Harry Potter at the door," he paused, "and Blaise let him see too much."
With the potion spreading through his blood stream, Draco was revived from the deep and tiring fuck Harry had just laid upon him. Grinning like a cat with a belly full of cream, Draco danced his way through the crowd until he found Ginny in the middle of a group of grinding bisexuals. She looked to be having a great time.
Malfoy smirked at him as Harry paid Malfoy’s outrageous bar tab. Harry rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around Malfoy’s waist to guide him outside.
“Feel better?” Potter chuckled. Draco merely slapped at his own neck with his now freed hands until Potter released him completely.
There was a knife, triangular, right down the center and halfway up the side. Draco doubted that was meant for his potion and tried to ignore it. Then, clear as day among an assortment of little specks, was one clumpy Neptune.
"Are you insane?!" The scroll suddenly shot from his hand and landed in Harry's outstretched one. "I can't just let him know I'm squirming over here, Ron! Come on, I thought you would understand better than Hermione!"
Draco sighed, no other lie came to mind. “To . . . to do something about this,” Draco thought about his biggest problem. Bigger than Horcruxes, manic mothers, or horrible house elves. Next time he would make certain to layer his reasoning as much as possible before getting caught.
Draco watched, fascinated, as both his father's excitement and his godfather's horror grew steadily throughout her speech.
Potter hadn’t noticed him, but . . . Snape's eyes narrowed and quickly honed in on Draco's face. The foolish boy propped his head up with one arm, smirked widely, and merrily held Snape’s gaze. Snape glared at him like he was an idiot. Snape was about to turn when suddenly Potter had his wand out. What? Now the boy was going to hex Draco? Snape wondered. Then Potter cast
"What?" Ron questioned, his brows furrowed. "Course he's got legs, mate! You've seen him ride a broom."
“You would see Draco as a squib all because you couldn’t handle to make a logical decision over one your pitiful gut is aching about?” she finished.
Draco knew. He did know that silk, his sensitive nipples, and those Potter fingers were going to be a dastardly combination. Draco still hadn’t been prepared for the actual pleasure shooting through his every nerve. Draco became the animal, wildly bucking into Potter’s hard body, at the first tentative touch.
fault!” his father continued and tried to sit up but was forced back into place by Snape’s hands on his shoulders.
“Wait . . . wait, Potter!” Malfoy leapt on him before he could fully stand, and, surprised, Harry let himself be pushed back into the futon. “I’ve been with bigger men than you, remember? I know how it works.”
Harry whined as Malfoy’s tightness disappeared suddenly and left his fingers cold. Then Harry yelped as long, strong limbs maneuvered him flat on his back against the mattress. Malfoy loomed over him, one of those perfect fucking thighs closing in Harry’s hips on both sides, and he pinned Harry to the bed with a tight grip on his shoulders. Harry was literally incapable of thinking, moving, or doing anything besides kiss Malfoy back as the other fell on top of him, sloppily brought their mouths together, and slid his slippery arse all along Harry’s hardness.
Draco allowed himself to be kissed and manipulated into a more comfortable position. Potter once again thrusting their clothed hips together and for the first time Draco really truly missed his own manhood. Draco broke their kiss as he dropped to his knees, eager to expose Potter’s thickness now that he’d been shown the kind of attention he craved. If he simply wanted punishment, Draco had plenty of his father for that. No, Draco thought as he felt Potter’s weight in his palm, he wanted something else entirely out of this partnership.
Draco felt frozen in place while Harry quickly pulled back. Potter’s face flamed so hot it looked as though Draco might have hexed it that way. Potter took a step away, but in the end, didn't flee. Like he was too worried about knowing the answer.
His father had frowned at him for a bit too long, but replied, “You know I will make that happen, son.”
“Be my guest,” Luna said, and they all found a seat in the comfy, circular booth. “Have you gone over the rules yet, Draco?”
“Well, master Draco, sir, Dobby be wanting to help. Dobby is knowing bad, bad thing and be wanting to escape--”
“That’s where you’re wrong, Potter,” Malfoy drawled. “Who said I wanted you to loom over me like some crazed Hippogriff, watching as I toss off? Besides the fact that I haven’t ended things with Blaise what-so-ever, standing there like so you have literally nothing to offer me.”
“But of course,” his father replied, smug. “We have a sufficient reason to appeal to the lives of the Weasels now. People will suspect I knew what I was doing--that I deliberately went about a way to bring my master back--but I can at least have the security of playing dumb. Once I make a few more stops, that is. I need one more month for the act to be placed into motion, Narcissa, and some time for a few appearances in Knockturn Alley.”
A few days later Draco still felt perplexed by his unorthodox meeting with Granger, but he also felt a little better in general, thinking he and his father were going to get away once more with their lie. Of course, this was when everything went to dragon dung.
Draco returned them to his flat, and, as they stumbled into the recently cleaned place, Draco stopped Harry to plant a huge, smacking kiss on his lips.
"Draco, do you remember that time you knocked your two front teeth out and we had to . . . lie to your mother about what had happened?"
Jean eyed her speculatively for a long moment before speaking. “You will not cut your hair above your shoulders and you will manage a decent leg line within the next three months. These will be deciding factors in whether or not you can make it here, understand?”
Ron pulled out Harry's chess set from under the coffee table. He poured out some pieces to set up but paused with his hand raised as a thought popped in his head. "Ginny," Ron said slowly. "She's not . . ."
“You pig,” he spat, and Potter chuckled and vanished the ropes holding Draco in place at the wall. At once Draco pounced, trying and failing to injure the boy who lived. Potter manipulated Draco’s protesting body easily, and soon they were right where Potter wanted: pressed against a flat surface, naked, Draco on his back underneath Potter.
“Harry . . .” Draco said. “Do you want to go by your place and change? If not, I know some really good altering charms and you could borrow some of my clothes.”
, there was no other word for it. He hadn’t been this utterly incapable of anything since Harry Potter had . . . well, since he’d met bloody Potter.
“Coffee, black,” Draco announced as he pulled out his novel. The waitress that had barely made it to his table started to back away again. “Wait,” Draco said and she froze. “I want an Irish whiskey, too. The best you’ve got.”
“Linky sees that, sir,” she said, nodding as her huge eyes scrutinized the small space. Well, small compared to the manor, that was. Large in comparison to Potter’s dinky studio flat.
Draco was somehow surprised to see Luna outside his flat, even though yesterday that would have made perfect sense.
Draco had to think quickly. “Listen,” he said, the words coming to him as he thought of them. "I think I could make you a deal, Dobby, that will keep everyone safe. Including you. I just need some time to work it out."
One night his mother hadn't come for supper and his father had sent him to bed straight after finishing his own. Curious, Draco grabbed his invisibility cloak and went to spy on his parents. He found them in the black cabinets, his mother’s secret room. The wall passageway was locked, though he could still hear raised voices within. Draco bit his lip, looked to his own bare toes then quietly shuffled away and called Linky to bring him his boots. He stepped with them on and finally he was inside.
Draco found himself gaping once again. Had his parents known what was going on with Quirrell as well? He had figured Snape had his big nose in it somehow, but he’d never suspected his parents might know. He contemplated revealing himself and telling his guardians about Em and the staff, but quickly realized that would lead to questions he couldn’t answer, as it would break one of the rules he’d given himself to never speak of the dragon. He felt that rule was still important for some reason.
it, Lucius? What would have happened had you been foolish enough to let your own son keep this thing for any longer?"
“Merlin, you’re hopeless,” Ginny sighed. “Power, money, a decent face . . . yet a complete dimwit when it comes to romance.”
Malfoy had moved gracefully up and back down. In less than a second Harry’s prick was surround by the tight, hot grip of Malfoy’s slick passage. Harry mewled a horribly high-pitched sound and was quickly gasping for breath as Malfoy began to ride Harry in earnest. Malfoy guided Harry’s hands away from the crumpled sheets and placed them on narrow hips. Harry couldn’t help but squeeze as tight as he could, but luckily Malfoy seemed encouraged by Harry’s rough grip and started to bounce faster.
She strode away, and Draco was free. He turned to glare at Granger, only to find her still blinking at him, red as a tomato. She’d somehow managed to slick all her bushy hair into a smart looking bun. The sight was distracting.
“Hah,” Potter said, trying to control his breathing. “What have you been drinking? It tastes funny.”
"But how can be sure what Pansy said to Harry? How will you know what to write?" Luna questioned, brow furrowed in wonder.
Still, the boy-turned-girl waited another day and spent his next free period sucking Potter’s cock before he even contemplated his sad stroll toward the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey was concerned to see him as an unrecognizable student. By the time Draco had explained his side of the story she was exasperated and wasted no time ushering him to bed for a few quick spells.
“You heard me, Potty!” Malfoy said. “You handsome manly men, you think you can push me around. Well, I won’t have it!”
Never mind that they were supposed to Ministry regulated. What was Potter going to do, tattle on him?
It was only Wayne, his father’s favorite elf who was a complete prick. Draco rolled his eyes and contemplated tossing a pillow at the smug elf just for the fun of it.
“Right,” Malfoy said, and started to remove himself off Harry’s body. “Well, there’s seven days in a week, Potter--”
“Fuck,” Draco breathed, and Potter nodded jerkily, his glasses flopping off his face and falling to the bed. Potter made no move to right them.
Draco had been thinking about someone fucking him open for what seemed like ages. He knew beyond a doubt that he wanted it and that it would be fucking amazing. So Draco was surprised by the intensity of the ripping sting that came along with Potter’s cock, hard as a rock, inside him.
She was sitting in the library when suddenly a tall, dark Slytherin slid into the seat across from her. She looked up from her homework to find Blaise Zabini sitting there.
“Come on, Harry,” Draco purred, half pout, half lusty look eating at his features. “Ginny deserves to get hammered. I’ll admit, I cannot be trusted to be responsible. We’ll need you to keep us from doing something too stupid.”
Draco could only blink at her for a moment as he pondered her sudden lack of foresight. He opened his mouth, closed it, and finally spoke something that he totally hadn’t meant to say out loud, “how do you keep people out of your home?”
“Why should I?” Malfoy didn’t smile, but Harry could see the amusement dripping off of him like slime. Harry’s jaw clenched, his fist curling as he forgot about Malfoy’s face and eyed the flushed swell twitch, half-submerged and wrapped as it was in the light grip of Malfoy’s slender fingers.
Draco, sure he was doing it wrong, couldn’t really bring himself to care for once in his life. Potter’s cock rested inside Draco; the weight of his testicles were warm against Draco’s arse, his breath wet against Draco’s cheek, and Draco loved it.
Stay tuned for the next part in this series. "Be Ready for the Red-Headed Hussy." In which Luna and a few other friends will make an appearance.
“You yourself just said the spell binds magic, not heart, Narcissa,” Snape said, his tone rather patronizing.
“I was going to tell you,” Malfoy said. “But I thought you might stay more relaxed if you thought I was still drunk.”
“Jesus, Malfoy,” panted Harry, one of his hands reaching up, the tips of his fingers running along the black fabric right over the slight curve of Malfoy’s nipple.
"--knickers?" Harry finished, a hopeful sparkle in his green eyes as he looked away from Ron and focused on Malfoy again.
channels you could go through in which to get permission, I’m sure, but it would be easiest to do all your healing at the studio. Jean obviously has the proper wards up as I have never had trouble using magic here before.”
Potions was one giant disaster (as was Snape’s entire life, really, but that was not the point right now). Harry hadn't noticed, because he was too busy staring at Malfoy. In fact, Harry had been so busy staring at Malfoy that he'd completely skipped out on taunting Malfoy as the other had strode in. Instead of calling him something insulting like all the other Gryffindor boys had done, Harry had only drooled on the table a little bit. Snape had started off the lesson with five points from Gryffindor for Harry's drool, but fifty for the name calling.
"Potter saw my cock," Draco burst and fell back into his chair. "He--he made me moan in front of him, I suppose."
Nott grimaced but followed Draco into the kitchen nonetheless. He joined the table and soundlessly accepted a purple cup from the witch. "So," Draco drawled once he was comfy. "What has Pansy done this time?"
Potter finally gazed at Draco’s face. Green eyes shifted back and forth between Draco’s grey ones, before sliding down Draco’s pointed nose and landing on his dry lips.
Ron started toward the hearth, snatched the parchment off the floor and let it hang above the blazing fire. "This, Harry," he said calmly. "This is how you are going to respond."
Since Draco had yet to return to a man of leisure, he found himself extremely bored at this point in the summer, and the room seemed non-threatening so he spared some of his time to have a look inside. Draco didn’t understand why but the next day he went back, even knowing he risked his father’s wrath. The day after that, Draco was in the room tearing through drawers like a mad wizard and found an alluring journal . He decided to take it because he admired the vintage binding and had a random notion to start his own Hogwarts journal this year. Draco supposed maybe one day he could give it to his own child. Which was weird, considering he had never thought of having his own kids.
He’d spent the past three days tucked away in his potions lab - his “play” room had been easily cleaned out and converted. After he and Linky dumped all his old junk in one of the endless closets, that was. Besides Bear.
“I can’t believe you want something like this,” Draco admitted, his voice void of emotion. If Potter wanted to talk . . . well, Draco could
“Now I ask you gentlemen, why do it when we can have those less fortunate do it for us? And why, for that matter, should we trust just any poor sod with the task? When we have the perfect tool at our disposal . . . with only a minimal amount of manipulation, I promise, Severus. It will really be like taking candy from a baby.”
Granger suddenly cut him off with a giggle. “No, I’m sorry. It is just so jarring to think about things from a different perspective sometimes,” she claimed.
“Were you talking to Patrick, then?” Harry said, his voice was flat but Draco could see the anger in his green eyes.
A few hours later, Draco admitted the night to be mostly fruitless. However, they had found a new room, it had just been empty. Draco added it to his map and went back to bed.
“Madam Pomfrey has a potion that will turn me back . . .” Potter raised a brow. “She can give it to me now, but since there’s a chance I could be . . . well, you know. It’s then standard procedure for her to check, but . . . I thought you could help me decide what to do . . .”
Potter found Draco before Advanced Charms, and Draco was ashamed to feel his panties flood with heat at the feel of Potter manhandling him into a nearby classroom. Draco stumbled against the desk as Potter let him go.
Ginny must have noticed how Draco eyed the tray filled with an assortment of shot glasses, because she said, “he’s scared of the bartender. Didn’t want to make the trip twice.”
“And just how do you suggest we do that?” Snape asked, eyes wide. He had obviously recognized the object for what it was. Though Draco still wasn’t clear on that front. “We would risk bringing down the whole manor if we tried that here. I still cannot figure out how Potter managed it with Quirrell. Dumbledore has been spouting his usual love conquers all mess.”
These last thoughts sobered Draco’s giddy mood a bit, and when he stepped from the shower only a slip of a smirk graced his face. Draco dried off and poured himself a tumble of gin from a decanter that sat on his bathroom counter and refilled itself when necessary. Nothing better, Draco swore, than a shot straight from the steamy shower to catch a buzz.
The other didn’t seem to notice Harry for a moment, which gave him time to ponder his and Malfoy’s recent relationship. No, they didn’t hate each other anymore, but Harry was still wary of the wizard. Especially since Harry had turned into everything Malfoy liked to make fun at even more since they’d left school. Harry worked with his hands, slept on a futon in front of his TV, and ate greasy muggle food for enjoyment.
“Alright,” Harry sighed, waving the bartender over. “I think you’ve had enough. Time to get you home.”
They rode out the wave of pleasure for what seemed like hours. When Malfoy finally collapsed on Harry’s chest, Harry quickly wrapped the small waist up in his arms. Harry couldn’t bare to let Malfoy go now that Harry had had him.
"Why?" said Ron, completely toneless. He his body gave a violent twitch and the parchment finally fluttered from his fingertips and fell out of sight. "Why, Harry? Why? Oh, Merlin, my eyes! My brain!"
Potter swiftly took his place pressed up against Draco’s chest. His steady heartbeat made Draco seem like a frightened rabbit. One callused hand settled its way around Draco’s throat, blended together like warm putty, Draco’s long neck stretched out for Potter’s thick fingers to squeeze. Their cocks brushed, and Draco fought down a vivid mental image - the tawny colored flesh of Potter’s velvety cock sliding against his own.
“Maybe—maybe it was rape the first time, but this,” Potter gestured between them, “proves that it wasn’t. You want me, Draco Malfoy, you just won’t admit it.”
Yes, Draco thought, he should never try to comfort a human being, but his pitiful effort seemed to have some effect on Dobby the horrible house elf. “Master Draco really be thinking that?” he wanted to know.
Draco’s jaw dropped open in disbelief, but before he could protest a bell sounded and he was shuffled toward the kitchen by a hungry pack, leaving Draco with no chance of hopping to safety.
He added in the last ingredient, following the directions to let simmer until it changed from green to red.
“Sectemsempra!” his mother swiftly hissed out the curse, and Draco watched as his father fell, blood squirting from his chest. Draco stood, horrified, as his mother walked to the floo, called Snape and just . . . left the room. Draco couldn't move a muscle as the shape of the slashes flashed and flashed through his mind - a sideways
“I don’t know what I want, okay, Potter!” Draco hissed. “I want you now, yes, because how I’ve come to perceive you so far has been perfect, but how am I to know if tomorrow I’ll learn something horribly off-putting?”
"Can I go?" Snape asked, he’d seemingly just realized that he wasn't in trouble and stood to leave, looking like he'd suddenly be anywhere else.
Harry choked on his own spit and waved the bartender over. Harry ordered a beer. He’d wanted something a little stronger tonight, but had a feeling he was going to end up carrying Malfoy out of there.
Ron had to stand up at that revelation, he moved back toward the fire and began to pace; the idea of
"I . . . don't know what to say back," Harry murmured and Ron just stared at him, sure he had missed part of Harry's story which wasn't very unusual with his best mate's narration skills. "Y'know, to Malfoy. I haven't written back."
Draco closed his eyes as he felt hands tugging off his clothes. He gave weak protests, but was trying to convince himself this was what he’d wanted. Draco had thought he and Potter would talk more but honestly, that had been a high expectation. He wanted everything Potter had to offer. If this was all . . .
“Dobby,” he called and waited until the elf appeared with a nervous crack. “We have some more work to do.”
“At least you had a chance at something real,” Harry said. “Every person I take home acts crazy about me then squeezes their eyes shut as soon as I take off my shirt.”
His mother’s eyes widened, the words seeming to strike her bloodless on the spot. “Without me . . ?” she murmured softly and Draco’s father flinched.
Ron raised his eyebrows in question. Sometimes he really wondered why his friend had to be so cryptic, like he was a wannabe Slytherin or something.
His father fell still but glared all the harder. “This is all your fault. I’m going to end you if I have one mark, Severus.”
“You and Mr. Malfoy have engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse, Mr. Potter. Now there is a possibility Mr. Malfoy may be pregnant. If he takes the potion to change him back without knowing for sure, there could be undesirable consequences. Mr. Malfoy had the choice to simply take another potion, one that would safely end any pregnancy that may have started; therefore, leaving him free to change back anytime. Mr. Malfoy, however, has decided to ask your advice.”
The days began to pass in a blurry routine. Draco was constantly sore and tired. Sore from seemingly endless practice for his upcoming recital, and tired from staying up late into the night and searching for answers. Draco started sleeping in, which caused him to miss his usual morning reading time. Although he was forgoing Auror Pendragon’s adventures, Draco found having one of his own was just as stimulating. Even if his companions were house elves.
“Come on, Harry,” Draco said breathily. “You’re not one of those guys who can’t take no for answer, are you?”
The room was silent for a long time until Draco suddenly summoned parchment and quill. "If Pansy has gotten to Potter already there's no telling. I must sooth the prat with a strongly worded letter," Draco shared a look with Theo as he finished speaking.
“Freedom!” Draco quickly caught on to the idea. “I know what you mean! Do you know tonight was the first night I’ve gone clubbing in sixth months! And  I need clubbing! I’m not good at a lot, but I’m great at clubbing!”
Without his gender or evilness in the way, Draco had known there was no chance Potter would reject him. He could throw himself at the Boy Who Lived Twice as much as he pleased without getting himself hexed in the process.
His father frowned. Draco wanted to suck the words back inside himself and let the acid in his stomach melt them away.
“Hey, do not look at me like that! It is not my fault if the kid chooses to wear those stupid muggle clothes sometimes and then proceeds to have pants that won’t stay down and trousers that won’t stay up!”
Oh, apparently, Draco was a drunkard as well. As if anyone who had participated in the war didn’t have a few every now and again. Sorry Patrick, Draco’s brain supplied savagely, if you were hiding in the shadows while some of us suffered in the heat of battle. Besides, it’s not like Draco was constantly as smashed as he’d been last night. What he’d told Potter was true. Draco wasn’t usually drunk when he had sex with Patrick. Draco was tipsy perhaps, but it had nothing to do with Patrick’s weight, and everything to do with constantly running from scary memories.
“Most definitely.” Zabini nodded. “They seemed to have went there. Apparently, Draco didn’t have enough time to scare him off. So, now you can see what has me worried? After being rejected that many times, Draco would just about have a fit large enough to get him sent to St. Mungo’s if the Golden Boy hooked up with him, only to realize post-coitus that Draco is still the selfish, nasty prick that Potter’s always despised.”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled. God, what was wrong with him? He usually had no problem loving himself and not caring what anyone else thought. Why did he have to be so self-conscious around Malfoy of all people? So what if Malfoy was tiny, blond, and everything else Harry was attracted to? He was still a dick that Harry had no business caring about.
Harry let him take the clothing but quickly snatched up Malfoy instead and pulled him back on the bed. "Shut up," Harry grumbled as Malfoy wriggled around and huffed but just managed to get himself more tangled up with Harry's limbs. "I don't care about the heels, you stupid git," Harry sort of lied. "Just your skin," he continued, which was much truer somehow. "I liked seeing it."
Two hours later, Draco sat scowling at a plant. His glare was so toxic, the flowers were beginning to welt. Let’s just say, Draco’s appearance did not provoke the reactions one wishes for. The best greeting Draco received was from pole-up-the-arse Percy, and that spoke for itself really.
She did so, and it was beautiful. This did not change the fact that the line of her legs was still lacking.
Draco chuckled while Theo narrowed his eyes at them both. "How come I still cannot tell when you are attempting to be humorous and Draco can?" he asked her.
"Master Draco be thinking that he and Dobby can solve each other's problems," Draco coughed a bit, realizing himself. "If you run and warn the Weasleys, that could be being bad for father and you, Dobby. However, the Weasleys aren't really important in the grand scheme of things, are they? No. We be needing -- we need to focus on one wizard in particular if we hope to save anybody."
“Dunno. Haven’t been in a real relationship since Ginny and I spilt,” Harry said. “I don’t get possessive over one-night stands. Mostly they just go home with me because I’m famous, and I still have to get them pretty tipsy for even that much to happen. I don’t expect anything from them besides what they’re willing to give, which doesn’t go beyond a hole. Not going to lie and say some assurance and affection wouldn’t be nice sometimes though.”
The lithe body under him writhed as Malfoy’s untouched cock jumped and pearly liquid slicked the space between their bodies. Malfoy had a powerful come shot and Harry watched in awe as some of the white substance landed in Malfoy’s open mouth. Malfoy didn’t seem to notice; he was busy screaming as Harry rammed his own come as far as he could get it into Malfoy’s passage.
When Draco woke in the morning he was still a girl. He took a bit longer on his morning routine when he paused to apply makeup, therefore he strode into the Great Hall late. Pansy rolled her eyes at him. She had wanted Draco to go to Madam Pomfrey last night. Draco scowled at her, but made to join her side at the breakfast table. He had a plan for Potter, and he wouldn’t let Pansy’s attitude ruin it.
Jean stopped him with a wave of her wand, his feet suddenly stuck to the floor. “Talk it out, boy,” she instructed. “I do not like quitters.”
Draco looked away from her serious face and instantly thought of Harry’s heart-shaped one. He could not kill Harry’s baby. Harry’s baby could be Draco’s only chance to keep Harry around for longer. Maybe a baby would even keep Potter from joining the Auror department.
His father scowled at him and gestured at his slumping form. "Now, we will keep up propriety, Draco . . . and I hope you do not think this acceptance will keep you from your obligations to this family . . ."
Harry woke in the morning, a moan of pleasure escaping his throat even before he fully processed the sweet sensation of something wet and warm sliding along his cock.
“We could stay like this,” Draco commented after a moment. “You could stay with me and we could talk about boys and break-ups and bacon all day long.”
Draco, though not officially, was a potions master. He had had all the training, and was set to start his apprenticeship, when the one who taught Draco all he knew had died in the war.
“Okay, maybe,” Harry admitted sheepishly. “But not like you think . . . not about Voldemort and shit.”
much . . . Jean, the best private dance instructor the Wizarding World had ever seen, just wouldn’t have it. Quidditch required a lot of intensive muscle, you see, whereas ballet required a body full of limber ones. Trying to develop both at once was nearly impossible, and ballet was painful enough, thank you very much. Draco wasn’t about to harm his own body over  Harry bloody Potter. Neither had he even considered quitting ballet, not when he could finally wear his pointe slippers for twenty minutes of each lesson.
"Lucius, I swear on the great and noble name of Black," his mother started coolly, "if you do not tell me what this thing is in the next five seconds I will gut you or die in the process. Do not even try and lie to me. I have already used
It seemed Potter went for another and Draco fisted at the sheets, threw his head back, and groaned, "fuck, Potter!" before he regained some composure, lifted it his head, and threw Snape a hard glare. Though his eyes quickly snapped back to Potter as the other boy spoke.
“It’s not a story really . . .” Potter started, picking Draco up and carrying him to the bed. “I just . . . before Voldemort died I guess you could say I had a connection to him. I could never be too sure what were actually my own impulses and what were from some of the more horrible dreams I would have. I couldn’t stand to be like him, to act as he would. Now that he’s gone . . . well, it is much easier for me to accept the grey parts of life.”
Draco’s blood froze in his veins, but his father continued. “We do not know how, but what else could have completely obliterated the protection he had placed on him - specifically to ward him away and from the possession of any nearby pieces of the Dark Lord? The same ones I have placed on all of us, which still stand strong? I may be a lot of things, Narcissa, but what have you two always trusted me with?”
"Honestly, Ron," drawled Hermione from Ron's side. "If anything, this completely changes my perception of Malfoy. It certainly proves he's less of the little coward I've always thought him to be. He's got to have a back bone to brave those heels on this floor--Harry, honey, are you breathing?!"
“You wear pointe?” she eyed the slippers in Draco’s hand and he nodded. “I just got my first pair about a week ago. It is why I decided to look for a wizarding instructor. When I’d read that dancers can start en pointe as early as ten with the right healing spells,” she elaborated.
make a joke, Theodore," Draco drawled. "And, Luna, she has perfected the art of amusing while amused better than I have myself because she is willing to be more self-deprecating."
"Er . . ." said Harry as he blinked down at his blank notes. He looked back up to Snape and guessed. "Platinum . . ."
“You are certainly talented, my son. I wonder why it is you can exceed so greatly in some aspects of magic and not in others . . .”
“Patrick, that’s why!” Draco stood and started pacing as he pulled out his bun and ran his fingers through his hair. “He acted like my father, but worse because my father doesn’t care about anything anymore, especially me.”
“I know right,” she rolled her eyes. “Here I am, with a fascinating career, in the middle of an amazing season, and what are mum’s first words to me? No ‘how’s it been.’ Not even a ‘good to see you alive.’ Just ‘you’re late.’”
"Well . . ." Hermione sighed again. "Harry doesn't have much experience in having his own things. Not presents, clothing, or . . . friends, really. Certainly not lovers. He doesn't open up easily and once he does it can sometimes be a little . . . intense. I can only imagine how Harry would act toward his first . . . pretty much everything."
somehow managed to teach my heir bloody occlumency without my knowledge! Let alone my consent! It is only coincidence that Draco managed to find something of mine instead of yours and you know it! But I will give you what you want, Narcissa,” his father laughed darkly. “Reason to hate me: it is a horcrux.”
“Did he really though? Are we certain Dumbledore did not give Potter another tool that could aid in controlling soul magic?” Draco’s father smirked wider and wider as he spoke. “Can you not see, Severus? Truly beyond your love of all things redheaded, womanly and weak?” Snape began to growl, but his father continued over the offending noise. “I have put actual thought into this, you know. I did not spend the entirety of the past weeks lollygagging around like a drunken muggle. We have to watch our own backs now more than ever, and there is only one solution I could come up with that will keep the light side from considering this a direct attack on the Potter boy.”
Somehow, Draco knew that his own cock was still hard thanks to Potter stroking it, but Draco barely felt that because he was too busy feeling Potter inside him. It still burned, but it was never really the pain that had Draco wound tight and now Draco kind of liked the sting. The feeling of Potter inside him was still so foreign and strange, because Potter was harder than anything Draco had ever felt, and Draco swore that he could hear Potter’s heartbeat in his own arse. It was strange but good, very good, and all Draco could do for a moment was give Potter’s cock an exploratory squeeze.
Nothing too flashy, Draco was sure. Although, for Potter, he wanted to look his best. There lie Draco’s dilemma. In a blur of martinis, movement, and mirrors, Draco soon had a pile of rumpled clothes stacked to his hips and still hadn’t decided on an outfit. Quite tipsy by now, and running out of time, Draco huffed and donned a pair of acid washed jeans and plain cotton v-neck. If he was slumming with Weasleys, muggle attire was sure to be okay. Besides, the tight, stretchy jeans made his bum look great and the black color of the T-shirt made his pale skin stand out.
Already feeling the effects, Draco just smirked and pushed Harry back a few inches, so he could slide around the bigger man. “Where’s your sense of adventure, Harry Potter?” Draco drawled as he left the bathroom.
“I don't really. Just one time it would be nice to have someone want a repeat performance with me. It sucks knowing your partners find you so unattractive they have to be drunk to sleep with you, and, even then, only want a one off for five minutes of fame.”
“We have reason to believe,” his father quickly took over, “that Draco was somehow involved with the Potter-Destroying-the-Dark-Lord-Once-Again incident.”
"No, I didn't mean his clothes. I mean like . . . his y'know? His pants? Do you think he's got on--"
"I don't know, Harry," Hermione drawled slowly as she waited for Harry to look at her. When he did, she continued, "why don't you go over there and find out?"
“Mr. Malfoy . . . is there a chance you could be with child? How long have you been in this form exactly?”
Fucking Potter, Draco mentally despaired. His throat was suddenly wet, wet, wet and he fought to swallow. “Rape—“
“Dobby be spying, master Draco, sir,” Dobby stated so quietly that Draco could barely hear and went back to his steady breathing. Draco raised an eyebrow, perhaps there was another reason his mother liked this elf and loathed every other Malfoy one. Namely it was clear Dobby didn’t listen to a thing his father said.
Malfoy’s hands were everywhere, undoing Harry far quicker than the feel of Malfoy’s tight passage. First Malfoy stroked Harry’s shoulders and neck. Then Malfoy flicked Harry’s nipples before taking a hand full of each peck and squeezing. Last he seemed content to put Harry to death by massaging long fingers into the fat and muscle of Harry’s belly. Malfoy finally relented, and Harry found he could open his eyes again. Although the sight that greeted him was so erotic he had to bite his own tongue to avoid both screaming and orgasming.
Ten minutes later, Draco was in the green study. He didn’t bother with anything fancy this time, just gated in every one of his thoughts. His father thrust a glass of water into his hand and Draco took a sip. He couldn't speak first, he knew that would be silly, but he wanted to say he loved his father then. He couldn't say that though. His father would only think he was groveling or something. Draco would sound so idiotic. Plus, his father might figure out he’d sort of been lying.
“Oh, Luna’s friend!” She brightened visibly. “Of course, come in! Come in! She’s at her regular table.”
The second they stepped into the boy dormitories, Harry had been all over Draco – touching, kissing, and feeling everywhere. Harry wasn’t quite sure what had come over himself, but something about Malfoy made it so easy to just . . . want and take it. Ten minutes before, Harry had been worried about sating his curiosity. Five minutes after that, Harry had been worried about kissing Malfoy. In this moment, Harry found himself worried about doing
Then Draco pulled out his latest in the Auror Pendragon Series and began to read aloud. He didn't pause until he had drunk nearly all his own tea. He marked his page and thought once more of the potion and lockbox before he placed the saucer on top of his cup and spun it around four times. He let the mess settle and began to read again, starting on Bear's tea as he did so this time. He repeated the process for Bear's cup when he’d finished that one, and then pushed the book aside completely in favor of gazing in his original cup.
“Me,” he barked and strode toward the barre. She joined him shortly after, mimicking his motions in silence. Draco eyed her legs as they left the barre and worked through the positions. “Jean is not going to like your lack of holes,” he commented.
Draco couldn’t stop staring at Harry wearing Draco’s modified clothes. Harry was built much differently than Patrick, and the tight jeans and shirt highlighted those differences more than the baggy clothes Harry always wore.
Harry adjusted Draco’s legs so they were on his shoulders and lined himself up. He took a big breath before sliding balls deep in Draco’s wanton arse. Draco didn’t seem to be in pain, but he also didn’t seem capable of forming words. Harry just went for it like he normally did, and fucked Draco as hard and deep as he could. Draco’s moans steadily turned into screams, and when Harry grabbed onto his thin hips to keep him from sliding away, Draco’s climax startled Harry into his own.
Draco quickly used the last of his sense to undo his fly and push his trousers around his knees, baring himself to Harry’s probing fingers as much as he could. Hot breath and a wet mouth assaulted Draco’s neck, and Draco swore he felt the lavish touch of Harry’s tongue along every nerve in his body. Panting like a crup in heat, Draco had never felt more submissive as he did then, humping the dirty metal in front of him as he felt his insides magically slick with lube.
“Hah!” Draco spat water from his mouth. To think, Patrick had called Draco mentally unstable and abusive. No, Patrick was the one always holding Draco back with his constant jealousy and verbal abuse. Draco would prosper now, without those meaty fingers constantly wrapped around his wrist.
Potter was not happy to see Draco, but he was clearly reluctant to show any anger in front of Pomfrey. Instead he stared at Draco, waiting for Draco to explain himself.
After Draco lifted and sank back down, the smirk was lost, but Draco wasn't sure if Potter had ever seen it anyway. Draco couldn't have said his own name let alone remembered his plan to not let Potter beat him. Draco had no problem, however, saying Potter's name as he couldn't have stopped mumbling it, but this was mostly because Potter was a mess underneath him and it was quite the sight. Draco kept working himself up and down on Potter’s hardness almost absently. It felt so interesting, new, and good . . . and Draco had finally gotten what he wanted. Even as Potter’s hand left his cock to fist in the sheets instead, Draco barely noticed because he was finally learning what was so good about rock hard cocks and having them inside him. Every time Draco moved Potter scratched something inside of Draco that was so much better than an itch.
“Why were you?” Malfoy’s thoughtful, little frown was cute. “I haven't said a mean thing to you since the war, Potter.”
A handful of powder and Draco whooshed back into Potter’s flat. It seemed the same as when Draco departed this morning, only there was a delicious smell wafting in from the kitchenette.
That night Draco made sure to have Linky grab Bear from his lab and bring her to their room before the lumos went out.
His mother's cold voice announced her arrival. The flowers died as she approached them, but they always did that.
"Mr. Potter," drawled Snape, and Harry's eyes swiveled to the front where Snape stood sneering at him. "Would you please inform us as to what color this potion is supposed to be?"
Draco's mother seemed to sit up straighter, even as she had been perfectly straight before. “We have this thing destroyed as soon as we possibly can,” she said firmly. She waved her wand and the journal materialized before them. Another quick flick and the thing disappeared.
Then Potter moved. Just a small, tiny readjustment of his hips. He slid and pressed up into Draco at the same time that Draco sank downward.
'Don't fuck this up,' Blaise mouthed and went back to his lunch right as Potter cleared his throat again.
“What were you doing in here, Dobby?” he asked, slow and thoughtful as to slightly scare the creature.
They reached the end of the lesson and Jean still hadn’t returned, though Granger was breaking a sweat and looked satisfied. Draco normally wouldn’t disrupt Jean, but he wasn’t sure he could teach Granger the healing spells correctly. After all, she was Granger, and Draco wasn’t about to put himself in a position in which she could mock him - not after that penis comment especially.
The light was so glaringly bright it played tricks on his mind, and he burned his own flesh with heavy lidded eyes as they soaked up each exposed inch. From Draco’s angle, the sight of his own cock was offending; the pink swell could not have been fuller, stood out in contrast against his pale, lean body. Why did he have such a weakness attached to his wondrous frame? Draco pondered for the millionth time. See, Draco, he would have made a powerful girl. He could have easily lived life without a constant physical manifestation of his deepest desires. At least as a female these occurrences would have been much easier to conceal.
Potter gazed up at Draco and the boy gaped, then quickly shut his mouth. Luckily, he managed not to look toward Snape once even though Snape could tell that he’d really wanted to. Eventually, Draco made a sort of desperate noise, grabbed Potter up by the hair, and guided Potter's mouth toward his own cock. "Don't make me say it, Potter," Draco moaned, all the while glaring at Snape and throwing him a rude gesture with his free hand.
"Like . . . maybe you should just tell him what you think about his outfit? Then maybe he'll be more prone to ending your curiosity, yeah? If he knows you're not looking to tease him about it."
"Besides breathing?" Nott's eyebrows were nearly touching his forehead, then he sighed, defeated. "She imperiused me again."
Of course, a bouncer stopped them at the door. She was much bigger than Draco, and Draco had a feeling she could even give the boy who lived a run for his money.
Liking what he liked didn’t make him a bitch, Draco had already come to terms with this, no matter what his father thought about the situation. Draco had never held back before, and so he hadn’t held back this time; he’d guided Potter’s cock toward his own wet pussy and started fucking himself on it just as he would with any one up his arse.
“Seriously, Malfoy,” Harry huffed. “You’re on the rebound. It’s a bad idea, you’ll see that in the morning. I’m trying to do you a favor here. Just tell me your address.”
“How did I treat you badly, Draco?” Harry growled. “You’re the one who snuck out here and got completely plastered with Ginny!”
Ron actually found that kind of interesting. He never could picture Harry being so intimate with someone. Ron and Hermione had discussed the strangeness of the idea on multiple occasions since they'd found themselves intimate with each other.
The number of Seers documented in the Black family line is more than any other pureblood family in history. So when Draco grew frustrated with his spells and charm work, he could always calm himself by turning to a soothing leaf reading.
“Ah!” shouted Malfoy as Harry burst in the steamy room. “Potter!” Malfoy snapped, but quickly flowed out of his instinctive defense stance and began to tease his own hard cock again, drawling, “I mean,
Hermione reached across the table and smacked him hard. Harry not only blinked, but managed a strangled breath too. It was progress.
His father only sighed and guided Draco back on the bench. They sat in silence for a moment before his father broke it.
“Well, come on then,” Draco sighed falling to the floor to put his own slippers on. He explained some things as he laced them up. “I will show you the routine first. We’ll have you in your toe slippers after warmups, though I am still far from full time, so we will switch soon after that. Do not worry about long term damage. You are right in assuming that spells will sort you out. However, that is no reason to over exert yourself, Granger, like you are wont to do, I’m sure. Jean will not tolerate it though. You will be cut loose, understand?”
Pansy seemed to recover quickly and breathed out a laugh, whispering something in Malfoy's ear that Harry couldn't have heard. Malfoy and Pansy grinned evilly at each other and all Slytherin seemed to grin with them.
Draco only nodded. Madam Pomfrey sighed. “Here,” she said after a moment of tense silence; she sounded rather soft compared to her normal tone. “I’m going to lay out your options and we are going to sit here until you decide what you’re going to do.”
Without leaving a beat of silence for Draco to respond, Mrs. Wealsey said, “oh, Draco Malfoy dear! How lovely it is to see you, and to find out that our Harry here has himself such a handsome young lad to keep him company.” At that point, she paused only to overwhelm Draco with a powerful hug. “Oh, but look at you. You’re too skinny! All skin and bones—“
“I quite agree,” Jean said as she strolled in and proceeded to show Granger the spells. Once Granger’s feet were healed, Jean asked her to stand in front of the barre for inspection and Draco somehow felt nervous for Granger even though she was a mudblood and in cohorts with his
“There was an accident at practice. Broke my spine. They could heal me completely, but the breaking point will be vulnerable for quite a while. I’m not allowed on a broom for at least six months.”
“You sound--everything,” Harry gasped, as he stroked himself almost painfully. Harry was probably making a fool of himself but in that moment, he couldn’t have told up from down.
Wrapping around Malfoy’s every point and lying perfectly across his flat chest, the item was without a doubt made especially for him. Instead of halting Harry in his tracks, thoughts of Malfoy being a spoiled little brat about his knickers made Harry’s cock twitch inside his pants and he groaned aloud.
"I'm lying of course, Theo," Draco replied evenly. "Well, no, I'm not. I did find it a bit interesting until the first crucio but that was really a turn off, I'd learned. The bastard really hadn't been creative enough for me."
Those thoughts had Draco halting in his tracks. He saw his own legs bent and spread, Potter panting over his neglected sack, and decided in that moment he wasn’t going to cum before Harry Potter did.
“Could . . . could we just do it now?” Draco was already losing his nerve. He could take the two potions and try to forget his weakness had ever been tempted. Draco needed to tell Potter now with Pomfrey’s help or he would just end up coming back later with a changed mind. Draco knew himself well enough by now to know this.
Draco shouted at Linky to finish cleaning up and ran to dig through all his old notes boxed under his bed. He found what he was looking for nearly at the bottom. His original list of symbols. He hadn't needed to use it in what felt like years.
Potter’s mouth slipped off Draco’s cock with an obscene pop and he seemed content to just stare at Draco’s rim swallowing his fingers up. Draco was fine with this, really, as he’d been much too close to losing himself all down the Boy Who Lived’s throat.
“Yes, Harry!” Draco screamed, unable to care about their public location any longer. “Fuck me! Fuck me!”
“You heard her: she wants a party,” Draco smirked. “I’ve just decided I’m treating this lovely lady to an evening out. I have a special routine for occasions such as these. I call it Draco’s Dash to Disremember. So, I repeat, will you be joining us?”
“Yes,” his mother bit out her next words. “So, one of the other Death Eaters can summon it anytime they’d like.”
“Luna,” Draco smiled and kissed her hand. “You know Harry and Ginny,” Draco said as he gestured to them. “We are out on a Draco Dash tonight.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice Harry’s efforts and began to strip, making it into a show, and Harry couldn’t believe how lucky he was to be enjoying Malfoy’s body. The blond was all long, lanky limbs, and lean muscles. Malfoy’s belly was taut, his arse perfectly pert, and his cock thick and long. He was everything their society thought a man should look like to be attractive, and he was to Harry. He was fucking beautiful to Harry.
Draco had contemplated murdering him at least twice every day for the past two weeks. However, Dobby was more useful to him alive than dead at this point he figured, and the elf had managed to keep quiet about what they were up to. The house elf had fulfilled his part in Draco’s plan perfectly so far. Only, the past few nights, Draco had been trying to teach him the art of dramatics to no avail whatsoever.
Oh, and what sweet revenge it was, to have a night and morning stuffed full of Savior cock. Nothing like a swell and hard shag to make one forget all about their exes.
Theo blinked and gestured for him to continue; Draco kept writing until Luna had a satisfied smile and Theo was passed amused, then signed off.
When Malfoy started slapping at the mattress, Harry finally let his third finger slide in shortly a few times next to the other ones. Before Harry knew what had happened, Malfoy thrust himself last knuckle deep around all three fingers.
“Draco hasn’t actually ever gotten another boy in his bed,” Zabini elaborated. "Every time he manages to catch one they figure out that he’s still Draco Malfoy before things can get that far.”
Admittedly, dinner was delicious, and Draco was free from any thumping. However, as soon as everybody had their fill, the talking began again. Draco was insulted, laughed at, and asked invasive questions. Anytime Draco responded, Harry always looked at Draco as if he was sad, confused, or disappointed. At least Patrick had thought Draco’s cleverness was hilarious.
Draco buckled under the scrutiny and crashed his mouth against Potter’s parted one. Potter moaned and deepened it, their tongues meeting and dancing and going home with each other for a fuck. Potter’s hands were on Draco’s neck bringing them closer. Suddenly Potter yelped and broke away.
Below him, Potter seemed to have some issues breathing, but Draco didn’t actually hear him panting, because there was a loud buzz that started out softly in his ears, moved down his spine, and ended up strongly thrumming in his arse. It was very distracting.
“We aren’t best mates, but she likes me enough to get me a good deal,” Draco said as he slid past Harry and made to rejoin Ginny at their table.
“My leg line, Granger!” Draco spat and pulled her closer to the mirror, so he could point. “One gap has all but disappeared!”
Draco went back and found Granger to be unusually flustered. “Will I get in trouble?” she seemed to blurt out. “You know, for healing myself with magic?”
“Where is Draco?” Snape was asking while simultaneously casting a silencing charm. Draco quickly stepped all the way into the room despite the unwelcoming atmosphere.
A few days into his summer, Draco stumbled upon a room in his manor which he'd never seen before. Malfoy Manor was ginormous, and Draco had steadily accepted the fact that he may never really know everything about his own home, fluid as it was. If you asked Draco, it was still better than Hogwarts, and he also had a map of the manor which he added to every time something new popped up to remind of where not to lurk. Draco believed this particular room he found to be one of his ancestor’s secret chambers, thinking it looked a lot like one of his father’s but greyer. He also thought that he’d visited
“Drink?” Ginevra offered him a martini glass. “I always BYOB family gatherings. Harry managed to pause his rant for a second to point out that you like martinis too. With the way he gestured, I’m pretty sure he still thought you were standing next to him.”
Draco rushed to her like a starved man would to a bowl of mashed potatoes. Ginny held him and petted his tangled hair. Now, they were both smiling madly while tears rolled down their rosy cheeks.
It wasn’t a known fact or anything, but Draco Malfoy had been pondering the idea of falling into Harry Potter’s bed for a long time. The inappropriate thoughts had started somewhere between sixth year and the final battle. First when he’d been in the bath and realized he’d been wondering if Potter had followed him there. Quite a few times after the day Draco had found himself straddling Potter’s broom, hanging on for dear life, and having his nose tickled by the sweaty hairs on Potter’s neck all the while.
His father eyed him for a moment. "No, I suppose you would not," he said at last, and continued to stare strangely at Draco.
Potter murmured his agreement into Draco’s skin, and his hot breath on Draco’s neck somehow chilled the rest of Draco’s body into frozen compliance. Draco waited for the other shoe to drop, though Potter hadn’t stopped his movements. He was still messily making his way down Draco’s throat and chest, doing things beyond kissing that made Draco flushed red and left him writhing. Harry finally paused and sucked in a surprised breath as his lips met with something other than Malfoy’s soft skin. He pulled back, first seeing a blur of black and white and soon understanding it was a black silk bra. The material so thin, but so very dark against Malfoy’s so very pale skin.
“Of course,” his father had given him an odd look. “But did you really believe your mother would not send a little something for you?”
“Do you find him attractive?” Draco couldn’t tell if he was jealous or not. It was a very odd feeling.
Snape's eyes widened as he saw Draco’s father on the floor, but he wasted no time starting to heal him. Draco didn't reveal himself, not sure if he should. He might just get himself obliviated and this was something that he did not want to forget.
Draco hadn't thought Potter would have been interested in his legs since he never bothered to rid them of their hair. After all, Potter liked the more feminine side of Draco, that much was clear. Though, Potter wasn't wavered in the slightest, he made his way up Draco's leg, licking, biting, and sometimes taking the hairs between his teeth and tugging, until he'd reached the palest, smoothest, and highest point on Draco's thigh. Only then did Potter get back on track and mouth at Draco’s hardness through the silk until he was sopping wet with Potter’s spit.
"I think he might have . . . might have been warning me, too. If he was even serious about any of it, that is. Not that I would ever use an unforgivable on him or anything."
He’d been ‘stalking’ Malfoy for several days now. Ron had said that Malfoy was clearly into it, and Harry had never felt his cheeks grow as warm as then. Yet, there Harry was under his invisibility cloak, watching Malfoy bathe through the vain git’s open window (no matter if there were only supposed to be trees around to see, Malfoy clearly ate up even nature’s attention). Ron had told Harry to make his move days ago, but Harry felt he’d needed to gather more information. Today however, Ron was at Luna’s place next door, talking to Harry through an extendable ear 2.0; one of George’s new inventions based off muggle walkie-talkies.
Zabini eyed her for a long minute and then suddenly burst out laughing. "Oh . . . Granger," he said after a moment. "You said that like it was a bad thing."
"Nothing, dear." His father smiled, and Draco copied him. “If Draco wanted to talk to you about it, he would have.”
Her eyes blew wide, her arms clinched to her sides, and her face slowly broke out into a smile much too wide for her thin face.
“You mean, you know what they were talking about?” Draco questioned, finally grasping on to the importance of what Dobby was saying. "What that journal was?"
“I know,” Draco said, feeling the drug rush through his veins and strip away the last of his resistance. “I love everything about this moment. You, Harry, myself. Linky, for cleaning up all my martini glasses.”
He’d felt pain worse, Draco told himself, because the sensation really just . . . knocked his breath out of him in a totally absurd way. He felt so full. He was just so
“Screw off,” Harry said viciously, pushing Malfoy away. He didn’t mean to do it so hard, and cringed when he saw Malfoy’s back connect painfully with the coffee table behind him.
“Do not move, Lucius,” Snape snapped. “She hasn’t gone very deep it seems, but there still might be a chance of scarring if we do not do this correctly.”
“Fuck!” Draco shouted. Draco's knees were pressed to the bed on either side of his own shoulders; they were close enough for Draco’s trapped arms to find purchase on Potter’s hips. The boy had faint stretch marks in a few areas, Draco remembered, and was suddenly acutely aware of their silky existence under his gripping digits. Potter angled Draco’s arse further from the mattress and began to pound his prostate increasingly harder upon each new thrust. Draco clawed at Potter’s bony sides as his orgasm began to swarm through his gut. With tears finally escaping his closed eyes, Draco let out a great cry as he came. One, two, three times his body viciously pulsed around Potter’s rock hard cock.
"I think you have seriously underestimated the amount of attention Draco actually requires to survive," he drawled at last and though Harry couldn't have heard him, in that moment he was learning the truth behind Zabini's statement.
Draco nodded and sucked in a deep breath. He didn't much feel like crying another tear but the building pressure was undeniable.
His mother nodded sharply. “I can live with that. However, Severus will continue to house the thing. Do I make myself clear, Lucius? You will not be making friends with this part of the Dark Lord.”
Potter eyed Draco up and down. Harry took in coal-covered eyelids, long dark eyelashes, and brushed pinked cheekbones. He took in Malfoy's completely obscene version of the girls' Hogwarts uniform. The way the crisp white button down and grey sweater stretched tightly across Malfoy’s broad chest and pointy shoulders. Malfoy’s pleated skirt was all black and fit him perfectly. Though, Harry thought that Malfoy's skirt was shorter than most of the other girls’ plaid ones. Especially as he was sitting, and showed off about four inches of smooth pale skin dusted in cloud white hairs. The rest of his legs were lost to long black socks. Harry swallowed as he eyed the dark, velvety heels on Malfoy's feet. Instead of thin and strappy like the muggle high heels Harry had seen, these were clunky looking, laced up the front with a silk ribbon, and stopped right at Malfoy's ankle.
Draco vialed the potion and had Linky bring him the box. He poured the potion in the key hole and waited. Moments passed and then there was a silent puff of smoke and the box sprang open. Once the smoke cleared, Draco was disappointed to see that there was only a single book inside. It didn't even look too ancient or powerful, just plain, clean black leather bound. Draco read the note attached.
“You like your body? Oh, Gods, Granger.” Draco shook his head. “Nobody likes their body. That is your first problem.”
“You are talking about possibly bringing back a war, my love,” his father said, sounding rather faint yet his expression showed his intrigue. “Who could you trust with such a thing?”
"Not a chance in hell," Malfoy spat with even more venom. Harry sighed and listened as he began to shuffle about and rant. "You think I fancy walking around in those things after sleeping in them for hours?" he asked as he pulled up his sock and stomped over to the door. Then, "why? Because you want me to, Potter?" as he slammed the door shut. "Well, I refuse to suffer on your account," he added as came back over and ripped his skirt from Harry's grasp.
A few shots later, Ginny accepted a couple’s request to dance with them, and Draco, getting his hopes up, asked Harry if he would like to join them. Looking panicked, Harry declined with a shout to which Draco just stared back.
Still unsure, but captured by his lover and former lover’s wide, hopeful eyes, Harry returned in the house to give news of their departure. Draco already had his portkey ready. He had a portkey into his favorite London strip of bars, and one that would return him home. After accidently splinching his ear last year while trying to drunkenly apparate, Draco had taken a few days to learn how to make portkeys.
His mother loved the little guy. Probably because Dobby was easy prey though, not because she trusted him Draco was starting to realize.
The rest of the day went much more pleasantly. McGonagall was not subject to the same torture that Snape had been, as Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had both disappeared after lunch and missed her class entirely. For the time being, Hermione was able to focus better, and Ron was able to tell himself that Harry and Malfoy had possibly hexed themselves silly and ended up in the hospital wing. Though, he hadn’t bothered to check.
“Harry!” Draco had to shout to be heard. “You wait in line for drinks. I’ll find us a clean table. Ginny!” Draco averted his attention to the awed girl. “You stay in the middle and don’t lose either of us. When Harry has the drinks, lead him to our table!”
“Come on,” Potter tugged him up and along with a smirk. “I learned the hard way just how much you appreciate being put to sleep with 'arse juices' near your face.”
“I don't have boobs, Malfoy,” Harry said rather viciously. “In case you haven't noticed, I’m muscular under the fat. I'm lean in all the right places if you ask me.”
Dobby was quiet for a minute before he opened his mouth wide and let out a long spiel. “Dobby be thinking Harry Potter is wanting to escape his home. Harry Potter is being a very sad, sad boy, master Draco, sir. Dobby be seeing him the once when Dobby be letting a letter get too close. Harry Potter is a sad, sad little wizard, Dobby be seeing it!”
Luna caught them with practiced ease and Draco had already flicked his wand toward the kettle. He hadn't a clue how to work the "Stove-top Kenmore 500" yet. He still flew about two feet from the ground when it came to his muggle kitchen, and mastering the oven was his top priority. One day though, Draco was determined to draw back his curtains and let the muggles bask in all his glory.
“Ugh! This conversation is officially over!” he declared and pulled her away to work on body positions.
Although, to Draco’s knowledge, he had no new items. Em had probably stolen them, Draco had figured. Or ate all of it. The bastard was turning out like a younger version of Snape or something. Draco had not liked this revelation one bit.
. Before Snape could have arched a proper eyebrow, Potter had lubed fingers running along Draco's arse and Draco's eyes were wide as they shot back and forth between where Snape stood and where Potter's mouth was wrapping around his cock once more. Though Draco’s body still betrayed his excitement by writhing quite violently with what could have only been pleasure. Potter didn't seem to have any technique as he swallowed Draco down and slipped one finger inside, but for what it was worth, Snape could admit that Draco, at least, was quite taken with it.
“No!” Jamie said. “I’m a sissy, for sure! I can’t imagine losing my package. Though the small tits I’ve grown are quite nice, don’t you think?”
After a freak out of mass proportions, in which Dobby attempted to brain himself on the table, Draco finally managed to get the thing to shut its Gods-awfully loud trap.
Another week passed before something knocked Draco out of his routine. Unfortunately, it wasn't the answer he'd been searching for.
Draco had smiled, and suddenly missing his actual birthday hadn’t seemed so bad. He’d proceeded to smile as he’d finish his meal, and the attribute had stayed until he fell asleep much later.
“In other words, you’re worried I’ll find something I dislike about you once you finally let me know more than one thing about you.”
During the day when he wasn’t at Jean’s studio, Draco found time to draw, work on his casting, and practice divination. Ever since he used tea leaves to help him solve Snape’s riddle, Draco was reminded of his talent in the area. He might not be the best at hair charms, but his Black blood ensured he was excellent in all areas of divination.
As the man in question rose to fetch them another two shots, Draco found his gaze following Harry’s round arse wondering if he’d ever be inclined to top for Harry, or if Harry would ever want Draco to do that. Would Draco even care if he bottomed for Harry Potter the rest of his life? Probably not, Draco concluded, there was just something about bottoming—
Draco slithered his way next to her and pressed the bottle to her lips. “Drink,” he said, and she did. The effect was almost instantaneous and it made Draco remember his first time trying the potion.
His mother sighed, and, to Draco’s surprise, she looked grave at the prospect of what she said next. “You intend to give it to the little witch then,” she drawled. “Ginevra.”
“Once, and never will I again . . .” Draco settled in for what was sure to be a truly interesting story.
Malfoy’s head was thrown back. His long neck exposed. One hand travel up and down his own torso while the other pumped furiously at his own cock.
“Teasing you?” Malfoy laughed. “See, Potter, this is why relationships such as these are based off contracts and rules—“
Harry went straight to pinching the pebbles between his finger tips and Malfoy squeezed hard around Harry's cock every time he did it. Malfoy's head was soon thrown back and his lips bitten red. Harry found himself relenting. If only to rid Malfoy of his skirt.
“I’m sorry to pull you away from your other duties, but I’m sure Mistress Narcissa will understand. You are my house elf.”
Harry could only open and close his mouth like a fish while Malfoy glared up at him. Harry wanted to say something about how he didn’t go out looking to get laid tonight, and still had on the socks he’d worked all day in, but before he could manage to form a coherent sentence, Malfoy had summoned his wand and blasted Harry’s toes with a cleaning charm.
“Yes,” and, “don’t stop,” were all Harry could bring himself to utter, and Malfoy didn’t stop until he was frozen in orgasm. The sweaty tufts of his hair blew in the wind from outside as his body clenched around fingers and spurted pearly globs along his tense stomach. As Malfoy collapsed back into the tub, Harry watched the come gather in the crease across his bellybutton.
“What’s so funny?” Harry asked he set their drinks down and reclaimed his seat. Harry’s arm slid slyly along the back of Draco’s chair and Draco had to use the small amount of sober he had left to keep from purring at the handsome man.
“Fuck, Malfoy, you really love this, don’t you?” Potter was still sort of growling. “You’re so sopping wet. I bet if you had a cock it would be as hard as mine right now.”
managed to think of an insult I take it?" Draco asked, and kept any nerves he may have felt from tainting his voice.
“You may have a pregnancy test, and further decide how to proceed. You may contact the father and ask him for advice right now or after the test. Or, you may take one potion followed by another and never speak of this to anyone again.”
Dobby and Draco were well on their way to Azkaban, or where ever bad, bad elves were sent. Still in it for the prize, Draco was unfazed and, Dobby, well, the house elf was in it merely because he was a moronic Hufflepuff gone Gryffindor hybrid all wrapped up in a wrinkly little package.
With flourish, Malfoy tossed his head back and began to stroke. Harry didn’t know where to settle his eyes, not wanting to miss any part of Malfoy’s lean body as it began to writhe against the smooth porcelain. After he memorized every plane, Harry grew impatient to see more and said, “how you normally do it.”
“Master Malfoy wanted me to find you, young master Draco,” the elf announced. “Ms. Jean is again requesting the young master.”
Of course, there was girl-Weasley! How had Draco forgotten? She was hot-headed, and everyone in Slytherin had been wary of her quick casting and powerful hexes.
Lindy’s was only a short walk from the pub. Any time Luna was in muggle London, she would most-likely be caught at Lindy’s lesbian bar. Draco still wasn’t sure if Luna was actually homosexual or if she just liked the strange wallpaper the place had.
“No,” Malfoy sighed sadly. “He said he knew that I liked him, but he never really believed me. If he did, he would have trusted me more.”
Draco felt relieved. Between his own and Granger’s lessons, Draco had managed to thoroughly distract himself from the impending doom he knew lurked. Two hours and a floo trip later, Draco found himself speculatively eying Granger as he stalked a tight circle around her still form.
Bear, Draco’s darling, plush little bear, would always be welcomed. He could admit to needing the company, because Linky was terrible to have around while working on potions. Bear was very quiet and always still when Draco was working . . . and work did he. Draco slaved for hours at a time (sometimes). Many of those hours were spent reading. Draco felt as if he’d read so many different potion texts he would piss out ingredients. Still, he was
“We’re all stupid,” Ginny replied with an equally deranged smirk. “I love it. Life just happens, you know. Flows on. Wonderfully. Even the bad stuff.”
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hips before he could get too far and made him sit back down on Harry’s groin. “That was an invitation . . . if you’re serious about this whole thing, that is.”
“Yes, black,” Malfoy moaned, and thrust up into Harry’s face, which caused his tongue to flatten over the silk covering Malfoy’s tip, so he could feel every ridge. “The question is, Potter, do you want black . . . or white?” drawled Malfoy, as he slipped a thumb under the silk, shimmed his hips until the knickers slipped down past them, and his cock was freed to slap against his pale belly.
“But he does have a nice cock,” Draco supplied, and then scowled. “Not that that means I’ll let you treat me like shit, Potter.”
Malfoy stood, his arms akimbo. With the extra four or five inches, Malfoy was easily a full head taller than Harry was himself. Malfoy took a step closer to Harry, so that his sharp hip bones ghosted against Harry’s jumper. He looked down at Harry with one brow arched high. “Really, now, Potter?” he said, more than asked.
In the shower, Draco began to smirk to himself. The satisfaction ate away at his face until all he could do was release peels of cold laughter. Patrick’s stupid expression, Draco recalled as he wheezed in the steamy air. The pudgy pink horror as Draco’s 4,000 gallon china vase had broken across it.
Even after Malfoy slid into the seat next to Pansy and poured himself a glass of water, the hall was completely silent and motionless. It wasn't until Snape groaned out loud did the entire hall blink as one unit and process what the fuck they just witnessed.
"But first," his father began, and his mother gave a resigned sigh, "explain yourself, Severus," he demanded as he turned toward the wizard in question.
Harry could have only swallowed around the thick air, let Malfoy drag him from the Great Hall, and watched how that stupid little swagger Harry had always hated so much made Malfoy's backside sway in a truly unforgivable way.
“No,” Draco said slowly. It wouldn’t be good to crack a smile now and let Harry know how much his jealousy made Draco’s tummy flutter. Draco wouldn’t want Harry to discover too many of Draco’s kinks too fast. Vanilla guy like him might just run off. “It was Luna. I asked her earlier if she could get something for me and she just replied. I had to use my wand to reply back to her.”
"The point is, it was worth the risk," his father started. "You think that somehow bypassed my awareness, Severus? That we would be showing a little weakness?"
“Touchy. Woah. Okay,” Draco said and rolled his eyes. “Perhaps we should talk about your diet then.”
Ginny got up and began to dance even though there wasn’t music playing. Draco watched, enraptured by her weird movements.
Draco smiled back and went for his bag. Draco reached and his whole arm disappeared inside the small satchel. Draco pulled out three bottles of water and handed one each to Harry and Ginny.
"You dare to use that spell against me?" His father was suddenly shouting louder than Draco had ever heard. "You have some nerve, Narcissa, to imply that
“Bet if your cute, little pussy disappeared right now you’d beg me to bugger you in the arse.” Potter’s hands finally found Draco’s hips and he slammed into Draco with new strength. “Beg me to fuck you until I cum all inside your—“
Harry did his usual maneuver, dropped Malfoy’s legs, and quickly rolled them so Harry was on his back and Malfoy could collapse on Harry’s large chest if he wanted. Malfoy did, he bent his legs up and squeezed them tightly around Harry’s waist then promptly fell asleep. Harry let Malfoy drift into a proper slumber before he gently rearranged the small body against his side instead.
“Draco!” the dark-haired man shouted in shock, then quickly took Draco’s offered hand, and brought it to his lips for a short kiss. “It’s been ages. How are you?”
She said it with the most innocent wide eyes and adoring smile, too. The thing about Luna, she was akin to Severus Snape in back-handed compliments, and Draco admired her for it.
Draco poured another martini, but, at the last moment, forwent drinking it. The last thing he needed was to act a drunken fool in front of Ron Weasley. Draco bid Linky goodbye, and sent a handful of powder into his floo. Not two seconds later, Potter’s head flickered among green flames.
This seemed to make his mother pause, and Draco couldn’t help but notice how the crazy look in her eye grew cold and hard. “I know,” she said and raised her wand again.
He found the old witch lying on her chaise, eyes closed. “Jean?” he asked quietly, and she opened them. “Granger needs healing spells.”
For a moment, Hermione watched Malfoy pretending to miss Harry approach. Then she sighed and went back to her reading. She could admit to herself, it might not have made any sense. One wouldn’t have thought she’d fancy knowing anything about Malfoy’s knickers or what business Harry had with them. However, if there was one absurdity she found herself interested in, it was Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, and one pair of knickers.
“As you should be!” Malfoy spat. “Men like you are all dicks! Think you can walk all over guys like me!”
, but Draco hadn’t really given him much of a choice. Exposing Potter’s hardness as soon as he’d caught sight of it, Draco had been on his knees with Potter’s cock down his throat in seconds. Potter hadn’t so much as uttered a protest since then.
“I used a potion the first time and you didn’t even . . . well, yeah, I nicked it from Pansy. I was unprepared the second time.” Draco’s face was on fire as he admitted this.
“I want you,” Potter said, ignoring Draco’s comment. “Say I can have you and I’ll tell you whatever you want to know.”
Draco giggled, somehow that stupid statement had made perfect since to him. It was all in his chin, Draco liked to make it look pointy and tried to do so.
Footsteps had Draco perking. Expecting Harry, Draco was startled when thin, bare legs stopped next to him.
“I didn't have to be drunk to be with Patrick, you know. I was sober when I met him and most of the time we fucked. The only reason I enjoyed drunken sex with him is because he would let himself enjoy it more. Sometimes he'd even take off his shirt.”
“We are the only ones who know . . ?” Snape drawled. “It could easily disappear in a trench halfway across the world.”
Potter hissed, and effectively cut Draco off as he grabbed Draco by the hair and threw him to the desk. “Good, you won’t mind if I teach you some more then.”
Blaise seemed to find his own words amusing and Hermione found herself holding off a wry grin of her own. “Affection?” she repeated. “I’d say it’s more a bit of curiosity.”
Patrick had accused Draco of many indecencies during their time together, but last night Draco had finally had enough. Apparently, Draco was a cheater because he hadn’t fallen in love with Patrick yet. Draco was a freak because of the things that made him throbbing hard. Draco was a slut because he enjoyed the occasional trip into muggle London to lose himself in a mass of writhing homosexual bodies.
“That is potentially useful information, Dobby, be continuing up on that as we proceed,” Draco ordered, feeling suddenly, stupidly hopeful. “For now, it tells us all you need to do is play up the tormented and woebegone, brave little warrior routine to its fullest potential. Basically just, well . . . just be being yourself, Dobby. It is only Harry Potter whose underpants reach his belly button.”
“But . . . Malfoy,” she said and furrowed her brow. “You are a boy. I don’t think -- I mean, you can’t help having a penis.”
And that was when Harry realized this was all some big joke, and he’d foolishly let Malfoy have him on. After all, he’d seen Malfoy’s thick, seven maybe eight inch cock, and he’d seen his own. It was the skinniest, smallest thing on Harry’s whole body besides maybe his pinky finger.
Potter had these hands. They just gripped Draco and warmed him to the bone, and he found himself trying to resist melting in Potter’s arms. It was turning out to be quite the task. Potter had already stripped him of his jumper, pushed him flat back on the bed, and untucked his shirt. As Potter made to take the shirt off him, Draco forced himself into stopping Potter on the last button.
“Ohmymerlin,” she groaned as she fell into his waiting arms and pressed her face into his sweaty collar. “Did you just sex me via potion?”
Sighing, Draco rounded the corner and strolled into the expansive blue corridor. He hadn’t spoken to Owen since last Christmas when the man revealed that he had once been a Potter before marrying into the Malfoy family. Owen snored as Draco approached his portrait.
“She started it,” Ginny snapped. “And you have room to talk? This is your first date with Draco and you let the others walk all over him! And on that point, why would you bring him here in the first place? Don’t you like him? Sure, he might have a bit of an attitude but he’s the hottest thing you’ll ever have a chance to pull, you fat arse! You would think he deserved the best champagne and strawberries that money can buy, not being stuck in mum’s ruddy garden with me.”
. Draco couldn’t even breathe. He didn't know what to do. He had too much going through his mind, and then before he could move Snape was appearing with an angry crack.
Draco only had a second to realize he’d failed and came before Potter had, then Potter was crying out, leaving Draco’s used passage slick with his cum.
