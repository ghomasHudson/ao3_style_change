"I don't think he will like Adler very much." Severus drawled.
Harry opened his mouth to scream, wordless, mindless, desperate, horrified screams full of agony but nothing came out and suddenly the world tilted and Harry fell, barely catching himself on all fours, scraping his knees and the balls of his hands. Only then did the pain register, searing and blinding and bright and he looked down his chest and stomach, not surprised to see the gleaming tip of a dagger protruding from his lower abdomen, smeared and dropping with crimson.
"You must understand that those laws are very old and one always must interpret those things with the respective societal background. Most traditions and believes of pureblood families and the wizarding community in Britain evolved in a time when the ministry itself had little influence on the everyday life of wizards and it was preferred that the heads of families resolved most issues within the privacy of the family. The same was done with most institutions. We actually still see those dynamics in today's society," Mrs Palmer said before elaborating that Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry itself has been completely self-governed until Fudge's last year as a minister. "Even crimes happening there were handled by the school itself as long as they seemed competent enough to do so. Vykélari enjoy the same autonomy when dealing with matters of courtship, family law, marriage law and inheritance law as well as deliberate interferences of wizards therein. It is inherently nothing unusual."
“But I know I read about a Vykélari once that poisoned his enemies…” the young wizard insisted.
His voice, though, was still unmoved, still unstrained as he addressed Harry next. "Then imagine wind flowing over your wings … and leap!"
Suppressing a dry sob, Narcissa turned out of his grasp, stepping back from the table. “If instead in recompense for the life debt I demanded of Potter to witness for him?” She asked even though she must have known better.
"What was it you said to Harry? 'I think not'." And just like that, the tanned Italian followed the line of hair over the rippled, quivering muscles of Draco's abdomen, ever downwards to where his prize awaited him, nestled between blond locks.
"And which family would you rather be mated into? Malfoy? Zabini?"
To his surprise, Tore Battelli, the head of the family, had answered rather quickly, as if he had been awake at such an early hour, but he didn't dwell on it, instead focusing on drawing the information from the older wizard he so desperately needed. It took him quite a bit of convincing, sweet-talking, and reassuring but finally, finally Ettore had an eye-witness willing to testify under verita serum that Potter had been a willing guest at Lanai Manor. More importantly however: he had apparently allowed the two dominants to court him, which they had, with much effort and sensitivity.
But in any case, a defiant little voice in his mind piped up, they really had to stop manhandling him when he was fast asleep. That was just downright creepy.
"Show more respect to your elders, you…"
The pain and rage consumed him and he didn't even notice the dark presence at his side until strong, bony fingers grasped his chin in a vice-like grip, forcing him to tear his gaze away from the gruesome sight of his best friend's bloody form and towards the pale oval of Valerio's expressionless face. Ron's murderer.
As he stepped into the study, his mind was still in some kind of upheaval with different and violently conflicting thoughts and emotions twirling in a maelstrom of enormous proportions, gyrating towards a single realisation that he couldn't quite see and decipher yet.
everything else in the whole study. Now leave those bushes, Ives…"
But the Comissario only shook his head grimly, a broken movement with sharp edges.
them.
should
That would be a sight... Draco smirked to himself from where he, Pansy, Blaise, Ronja, Theo and Daphne were currently dining on the terrace of a newly opened restaurant in Diagon Allay, their newest.
It was the very reason why Draco had taken a liking to the eccentric artist in the first place, understanding that in their world of intrigues and façades one often wasn't given anything more substantial than this vital second to assess one's opponent and he had thought the photos to be perfect studies in what to look for. But his mother wouldn't accept anything in her home that was related to muggles in any way and his father disliked the obscene flaunting of emotions which he thought was something for the lower classes. Therefore Draco hadn't had the chance to see one of the rare pictures again after the one exhibition where he had first come upon them, hidden in a side room where they barely had the space and favourable light to unfurl their masterful effect.
Harry, who was now stepping past him, so close that Blaise saw his face, barely and much too blurred to make out any details, in the periphery of his field of vision, a pale oval in that see of darkness. There he paused, looking down at him but Blaise couldn't see his expression from this angle, unable to change his eyes' focus away from these damned stars consuming themselves in the endless distance.
Maybe not.
The awareness deepened then as Draco felt a torrent of magic flood his being and a sharp spike of panic rose within him as he fought the foreign feeling of being invaded so brutally. The air that he drew in a deep gasp felt cool in his lungs. Something was there immediately, soothing him with warmth, ponderousness, sluggishness; as if he was falling into a pool of a clear, viscous, gooey substance that clouded his mind, and cradled him in weightlessness. And Draco found he didn't care anymore: he existed purely of sensation.
This plan was entirely unacceptable. If this man had his way, Harry would have to give himself over and relinquish any last shreds of control he was currently possessing even before his friends were out of harm's way.
Instead he had silently enjoyed his friends sharing stories on the deceased they had invited to their table, small anecdotes, sarcastic remarks and Draco found himself listening with a smile as Pansy complained that his mother had been always so prim and proper, forbidding them this, that and the other and only causing them to play their games in secrecy and under much more dangerous conditions than it would have been necessary.
By now he certainly wouldn't be able to use the floo connection any longer and he couldn't even approach the wards without getting stunned and dragged right back.
It started with the dive and how Draco and Blaise had been taken on such activities with their already fledged relatives long before they had gotten their own wings and somehow evolved into Harry telling them some of the minor adventures he had experienced in his early years at Hogwarts, especially those that the Slytherins had played some role in. It soon became rather grotesque because their perceptions of certain events differed so much sometimes Harry had to wonder whether they had lived through different realities that had somehow been merged into one now.
Quickly his eyes darted to the closed door of his office. There was
And so, within the next hour, Blaise assembled all House Elves to instruct them not to let anyone enter the grounds of Lanai Manor, to protect Harry by all means necessary if someone or something should gain entrance and make sure the submissive would use the portkey to flee if such a situation should arrive; to which end he of course revoked Harry's ban to leave – it wouldn't do to trap Harry inside the house and its surrounding gardens without any chance of getting himself out of harm's way.
Now Zabini and Malfoy had to take him seriously, now they had to call their own behaviour into question and wonder if they would get away with the usual treatment of submissives.
, Harry should not have met other Vykélari until he was mated to the two dominants that had guided him through his transition or until he was at least secure in his newfound powers and knowledgeable enough to be able to protect himself. After Ives' interference it would come differently now: Adler's husband had made it so that he would become Harry's infallible friend and confidant while Blaise and he would never be able to reach that level of trustworthiness in the Gryffindor's eyes. Because they had not been the ones to give him back his treasured freedom. And as he was getting to know the more intricate patterns of the personality of the submissive who had once been his enemy, Draco was also starting to understand, that he could not possibly give him a more precious gift than the one Ives had given him.
Harry didn't quite know what he was supposed to think of this new development. He a politician? Merlin…
And by now Draco had learned that the only thing to be achieved by running was the turning of one's back to the danger. An unforgivable mistake with potentially fatal consequences.
Of course the last thing she or Lucius could need right now was to have their family name mentioned in association with the abuse of a submissive, especially if that submissive was the acclaimed Boy-Who-Lived-Half-A-Dozen-Times-More-Often-Than-He-Should-Have. Already the mood in the wizarding community was more volatile and far more difficult to handle than an Erumpent-horn. A mere push in the wrong direction and it would all explode into their faces.
With a sigh, the Italian raised one hand in a placating gesture, his eyes still dark and his lips bruised and damn it, it wasn't only Harry's magic, the guy really was gorgeous. "Listen Harry, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to..."
were the one to appeal to me for caution regarding him."
"Be careful to not transform too fast, Harry, or the growing wing bones might pierce the skin." Draco said softly, remembering the blood that had clung to those emerald wings in the hospital "Your magic will of course heal it immediately, but it smarts quite a bit. It often happens during the first transformation and whenever you are too distracted or impatient. But normally taking one or two seconds for the change will suffice to evade a rupture of the skin."
Finally Harry looked up, the redness draining from his cheeks. "What?" He whispered.
Thank you so much for the comments and kudos!
"You'd better believe it. Our parents already seem quite intent on making him a part of the family. Though I'm not sure if they realise that no one will ever manage to groom Potter into something even remotely socially acceptable." Draco said, his voice cold and hard in irritation.
"Forcing Potter will gain you nothing, at this point, Lucius!" Severus interrupted and Blaise felt Draco relax at his side a bit, and he himself felt overcome with a pathetic gratefulness for the cold, pragmatic voice of reason their former potions professor managed to retain under the worst of circumstances.
Immediately he wished he hadn't when he got face to wrist with a young brunette, a beringed wrist she had obviously raised just then to knock again and that he only barely evaded.
"Lie still!" Harry hissed half ordering, half begging, hoping for the older man to somehow forgive him his roughness and play along. He knew that it was all too likely that his one and only ally thought he would kill them all, what with the shattered remains of the garden surrounding them, Taide's family injured and scattered, especially his grandfather who might very well be dead; and if the older Vykélari decided to resist him…
Severus shook his head, cursing himself and his friend for not seeing that golden opportunity and ceasing it when they had had the chance. ”They’d have loved it, sucked it right up, but no…”
“Are they even safely in Italy or was that just a lie to get us to stay away?” She chuckled darkly, a harsh and cynical sound in the crisp silence. ”You certainly made sure to let us know we weren’t welcome.“
But he forced himself not to listen to the deadness in his nightingale's voice as he breathed a short "I will" in answer, focusing instead on the kidnapper himself, trying to find out where the man was, where Harry would be brought to.
Harry Potter was not a name that held much importance in Italy, a country where 'dark' was not necessarily 'evil'. A country where your bloodline was worth more than your money.
Then suddenly the dark skinned Italian jumped, propelled himself into the air and a mass of feathers erupted so quickly from his back that it was impossible to follow or understand the process that caused two gigantic wings to carry him upwards, not much, barely three metres at best. Harry gasped at the sight and took a step back, bumping against another muscled chest.
"For Harry it will." Adler answered, obviously unimpressed by his young descendant's mindset.
It had seemed to be a good idea at the time they had apparated, too.
"Oh Merlin, please, Draco! Stop apologizing! I don't want all our conversations to end in apologies…"
Harry swallowed past the dryness in his throat before banishing the disturbing thought from his mind with a determined shake of his head, stubbornly telling himself that it really didn't matter: if he couldn't get close to Ron and Hermione's kidnappers quickly enough to free his friends while avoiding a mating, he wouldn't allow his intended, whoever that turned out to be, to live long enough to abuse his magic.
Quite frankly, Blaise felt a bit vengeful after Lucius had hurt his Dragon, after Amalyne had held her derogatory speech about Harry.
It had also taken away his fear of dying. Had even made him desire the experience in some perverse, twisted sense of curiosity. What would it feel like, that shock of being fatally wounded? That never-ending instant of just knowing 'that's it'.
I-" He was quickly cut off as Draco forced two of his fingers into his mouth.
Harry felt he could of burst into flames with how hot his body felt. All these things Draco was saying to him made him feel so special, so safe, like he belonged. Like he belonged to
"Oh! yes, sorry, Caput Draconis." He managed to say after calming his thoughts down. The Fat Lady rolled her eyes, which Harry couldn't help but feel he deserved for ignoring her, and let him in.
“I’m not having any of that. I want to hear those pretty little noises, let me hear how fucking horny you are.”
Harry would of recognised that voice anywhere. That voice that he thought about constantly. That voice that he fantasised about saying unspeakable things to him, the wizard who that voice belonged to was standing right behind him, breathing down his neck,
During Harry's small panic, the Fat Lady had been asking him multiple times if he was actually planning on coming in, which he'd managed to block out somehow. He'd just been standing there staring at the floor like a first year who'd forgotten how to get in!
“Please daddy!” Harry burst out, “I want it!”
"Baby, I frankly do not give a fuck what people say. I don't care if they want you to be in control. You don't need to listen to them. It's okay to be vulnerable Harry, It's okay to just let yourself be taken care of for once."
Harry's patience was fleeting fast. "What are you talking about Mal-"
"But people say-"
“A-ah.. M-Malfoy-“
The dormitory he currently sat in was illuminated with the warm glow of the early hours of the afternoon through one of the windows. It had been left open near Harry, sending a breeze his way, but rather than chilling, it felt relaxing; soothing, almost, due to the subtlety of the wind's presence.
"I said
I cant do this for much longer, I need to- Ah! -feel you!”
"Sh, sh, I'm here Harry, It's okay."
manner, it made Harry fantasise about how Malfoy might handle his partners. A small flash of green shot through Harry's mind alongside that thought.
He mumbled under his breath.
“You.” Harry stared up at Draco, “Just want you,
“That’s my good little boy.”
Staring.
"I just keep thinking about how people have such high hopes for me, even now. My whole life I've been 'The boy who lived', always so calm and cool and in control, but I'm not. Not anymore," he swallowed harshly, "I don't want to be. I'm tired of being in control, Draco-" the tears he attempted to keep at bay began to stream down his face.
Malfoy brought his hand that wasn't on his partner's thigh to cup the other's face, in a smooth, caring motion. His actions were mirrored as Harry brought his own hand up to rest on top of the one on his cheek as tears pricked at his eyes - which his lover was quick to take notice of.
“Shhhh, I’ve got you baby,” Draco whispered as he stroked Harry’s curls, and without warning, pressed the head into Harry’s tight warmth. Harry whimpered at the sudden and unexpected feeling, but Malfoy was quick to run slow circles into his back again to calm him down once more.
And maybe people should keep their noses out of other's own damn preferences.
“Wrong again.”
“Fuck, you look so damn pretty like this, with my fingers down your throat. Bet you’d look even better with my cock in that pretty mouth, yeah? Would you want that, darling? Why don’t you tell me.” Draco took his dripping wet fingers out of Harry’s mouth and placed them under his chin, tilting his head up so his bewildered green eyes could meet Draco’s calm grey ones.
Harry thought.
“Fuck, but that’s embarrassing,” he managed to get out.
He knew Neville was acting different after it was gone, he wouldn't even look at Harry, which would make sense if Malfoy had threatened him.
alone.
Potter blinked away his tears, refusing to let them spill as he let out a shaky breath, then answering.
"Enjoying this, are you Potter? God, that's fucking cute. Getting horny just from sucking my fingers." Malfoy pushed his thigh in between Harry's legs, against his growing erection.
Draco pressed a kiss to the top of Harry's head, before adding another comment in attempt to lighten the mood, "Mainly because I know just how much you love to be ordered around in the bedroom-"
keep them both away.
When they'd managed to stop laughing, Draco placed two of his finger's under Harry's chin, tilting it up to make him look into his eyes.
That shouldn't of made him as angry as it did. Harry wasn't amazing at handling his emotions. He developed a habit to help him control them though; whenever he felt or thought something, he would scribble it down on a piece of paper. Potter kept a binder of all these bits of paper, and it worked well! It made his feelings easier for him to process. Well, it
Harry sat slouched on his bed, his hand lightly grasping a quill as he mindlessly tapped it on the open book in front of him, concentration apparent on his features. The brunette placed down the feathered pen, bringing both hands up to his glasses to move them onto his head so he could rub at his strained eyes. He'd been staring at text books for what felt like hours, studying for his upcoming exam in Charms. This year wasn't easy, so he was required to focus as much as he was able to.
Malfoys hands quickly swept down to remove the other’s trousers, tugging them down quickly along with his underwear, fully exposing him to the warm air of the common room. He took Harry’s ass into his hands and gripped firmly, before giving it a few hard smacks. Potter let out muffled moans at each of them, his hand covering his mouth, before Draco reached around to yank his hand away.
“Merlin, just think about how anyone could walk in right now, and see ‘Famous Potter’ bent over and absolutely fucking
Harry’s whole body heated up at that name. Draco really did know all his weak spots. He’d always dreamt about Malfoy calling him his good boy, but hearing him actually say it, in that sugary-sweet and raspy tone, Harry thought he might just become addicted to it.
“I’m going to need to hear you say it nice and clearly baby, or I might just leave you here.”
"Of course," Draco continued, "I only wanted to know if you had any embarassing habits i could of used against you, but when he let slip that  Potter had a
"Stop talking, darling, just breathe, come here," Draco pulled his boyfriend down into his arms, holding him, keeping him safe. Nothing could hurt either of them when they were like this. He began to run his long, pale fingers through the messy black curls that he loved so much. He listened to Harry's small sobs and attempts to breathe, waiting for them to fade into deep long breaths and occasional sobs before talking again.
He had definitely found Draco’s weakness.
Before Potter had even realised it, Draco had hooked his fingers under the knot in Harry’s tie, pulling him by it, eventually pushing him to bend over the arm of a nearby cushioned armchair. Harry had extended his arms to catch himself, his palms resting on the seat of the chair, his clothed ass exposed to Draco, his fully erect cock pressing against the chair’s arm. Draco walked up behind him placing his palm on Harry’s lower back, his own dick pressing against the other’s ass.
"Harry? Harry!"
"I'll ask you one more time, password?"
Harry shifted in his seat. "Yeah, yeah I'm fine."
Draco chuckled a bit, “You’re already bent over, legs spread for me, I think we’re past the point of embarrassment. Besides, I’d never make you uncomfortable.”
"The password isn't the only thing i got off of that pathetic Longbottom."
Harry began to shout, "Malfoy! What the fuck?" He brought his arms up to weakly attempt to push Draco off of him, which only ended with Draco easily pinning both of his arms above his head with one hand.
"It's true!"
Malfoy laughed a bit at the distance in his voice. "It doesn't sound like it." His overall attitude had changed since Harry had closed and opened his eyes. The Slytherin had changed from demanding and overbearing, to calm, and almost gentle. That was a word Harry never thought he'd use to describe Malfoy, but here he was. Using it for what felt like the 100th time.
"Draco!"
Draco calling his name brought him back to the present. He looked up into his eyes, the cool grey reflecting his own worries the were surely showing in his green ones. He had placed down his book, his hand now resting lovingly on Harry's thigh.
Draco let out a small chuckle before wandering over to the other. He stood dangerously close to Harry, who was able to feel his breath on his face again. " 'No playing around', hm, Potter? Does that only apply to me then?"
Harry hesitated for a split second, before quickly following the order. He wrapped his tongue around Malfoy's slim digits, sucking them into his warm mouth and coating them in his spit. A heated blush had spread across his tan skin, which Draco quickly took notice of.
Potter had fallen back into his thoughts again, something Draco had already had enough of, and decided he needed to find a way to snap him back into reality and keep him there. He began to smirk, as he swiftly shoved Harry into the wall beside the fire place, arms bent either side of his head. It definitely worked at bringing him back from his thoughts.
The Gryffindor had started to grind down on his thigh, unable to take the pressure of his now straining cock against the rough fabric of his jeans, prompting a small groan from Draco. In response, the taller one had shoved his fingers even further into Potter's mouth, making him gag around their length.
Harry gazed up into Draco’s eyes, as he was searching for the right name. He was taking his time when Malfoy’s thigh grinding up into him reminded him he was running out of it. Harry swallowed deeply, face flushing even more at the thought of what he was about to say, but he couldn’t risk Draco walking off, so he he bit back his worries and gave it a shot.
Draco stepped forward as Harry pulled his fingers out of himself, bringing his arm back onto the chair’s seat to steady himself. His wet digits would probably end up staining the couch...
“Ah! D-Daddy, please please
“I’m sorry daddy, please, i’m so sorry.” Harry felt tears start to well up in his eyes. His breathing had quickened. He just wanted to be good. He made him sad. He messed up. He-
He had only realised this a moment too late, however, as the footsteps were already approaching fast behind him. Before he could even turn around, he felt the presence of their breath on his ear, making him freeze. Not much later than he felt that, he heard the voice in his ear.
“I wish you could see yourself right now, darling. You look so fucking hot bent over like a good little boy,” Draco cooed to Harry. His hand that wasn’t on Harry’s back reached forward to tangle itself in his messy curls, tugging on them roughly, pulling his head back and earning a strained moan from the boy below him.
Draco began to pull out and push back inside of him, setting a fast pace right away. He had one hand on Harry’s waist, pulling him black to meet his thrusts and the other wrapped itself in Harry’s curls again. He just couldn’t get enough of how those soft locks twisted around his fingers.
of all things?"
Harry started to let out strings of choked moans, his eyes rolling into the back of his head. He knew Draco was talking to him, saying more dirty things but it all melted together into one big blur of blinding pleasure and need, his own words slurring together.
Harry listed off every Gryffindor he could think of.
He finally snapped out of his thoughts, standing up from the sofa and spinning round to see Malfoy leaning forward on both of his arms on the back of the piece of furniture. His platinum hair was swept out of his face to the sides, but a stray lock had fallen in front anyways, making his already beautiful grey eyes look just that much more appealing; enticing, even.
He gave one final slap, significantly harder than the rest, making Harry practically scream.
Harry let out a final loud moan before cumming all over himself and the chair. Draco could feel him tightening around his length, and gave a few more final thrusts and grunts before filling Harry with his own cum.
Harry mentally cursed himself for being so stupid. He'd left his wand in his room. Of course, Harry knew he could perform wandless magic, he had done so before, but never on purpose. What would he do if they planned to attack him? What if it was Voldemort? What if-
Draco started running his hand up and down Harry’s back in soft, slow strokes, a silent reminder that this was all just acting. That Draco wasn’t actually upset with him. That he could relax, he could let go around Draco, and he would be safe. He would be taken care of. God he already knew exactly what he needed. Harry focused on regulating his breathing as he heard Draco start to talk again, softer this time.
He gave up trying to decipher who it was after awhile.
“Here, give me your hand, baby.” Draco took Harry’s hand in his grip, twisting the boy’s arm around to rest his fingers at his own entrance. Malfoy took his wand out to cast a quick self-lubricating spell on him, before continuing Harry’s instructions, “Spread those legs, that’s it puppy, just like that, good boy. I want you to fuck yourself on your fingers for me. Let me watch you stretch yourself out for my dick.”
"Showing up alone? Bit daring, isn't it Potter?"
"Malfoy."
Harry didn’t understand how Malfoy could stay so dominant whilst saying such sweet things but he loved it. With Draco’s soft words of encouragement, he slipped his index finger in, letting out a breath that he didn’t even remember holding. He started to push it in and out of himself, spread out for Draco to see. He heard a zipper being pulled down behind him and the realisation that Malfoy was touching himself to Harry made him even more turned on, something he didn’t think was possible in that moment. It made him let out a moan slightly louder than he intended, but Draco’s groan behind him told him that he didn’t mind.
Hedwig had swooped over to Harry and perched on his now out-stretched arm, that he had held out the moment he noticed the bird.
Just then, a final thought cut through his mind, louder than the rest.
"Hey, hey! Calm down, love, deep breaths, what's wrong?" His question was to-the-point, but yet his face remained calm and patient - always so patient for Harry, never making him rush into sharing anything.
Potter had eventually reached the Fat Lady's painting. He stood infront of her, the idea of how batshit crazy he is for actually showing up.
" He whimpered through choked sobs.
Harry quickly became unsatisfied with just one finger, and jumped straight to three. The sight was obviously pleasing for Malfoy, as Harry heard him let out a guttural moan and some more words that made Harry desperate to keep going for him.
"Who would of guessed, that Harry 'The Boy Who Lived' Potter, still keeps a
Draco cut him off. “Uh-uh. Not my name baby. Try again.”
Harry wanted to disappear. He would crawl back on his hands and knees to the Dursleys of all people if it meant escaping this horrible moment in time. He shut his eyes tight, unable to bring himself to even look at Malfoy. His face had began to flush, he could tell. Draco's last words played in his mind on a loop.
He would just have to see for himself.
"Because i don't think you've been entirely honest, have you?"
He slowly inched in more and more, listening to Harry’s noises as he did so, before finally being fully inside him. The boy beneath him let out a load moan at the feeling of being so full. He didn’t know how bad he’d needed it until now, but fuck was he glad he had it in this moment.
“Ahn! Mmh! Daddy- Please! Fuck! Ahh- I’m gonna.. daddy please let me!”
“No! I promise I won’t! I’ll be good! So so good, I promise! Just please touch me!” His desperation had creeped back into his voice quickly, but Malfoy didn’t mind. It was something he could appreciate about Harry. How willing he was to come undone for him, and only him.
Not even two hours had passed. It was going to be a long afternoon.
“Daddy,
Malfoy leaned his body over Harry, bending down next to his ear to whisper, “Go on baby, you’ve been such an obedient little slut for daddy, and daddy thinks his baby deserves to feel good. Cum for me, cum for me like the good little boy you are!”
“Now baby, calmer this time please, what are you sorry for?”
“A-ah.. fucking hell baby. That’s it, fuck yourself for me, ahn, shit- such a good boy-“
"Now, how about I take you upstairs and show you just how good it can feel to not be in control?"
Draco moved his hand from tilting Harry’s chin, to gripping it harshly. “Want what, love?”
His honey-warm voice coated Harry’s mind. Draco was all he could process in this moment, and that’s exactly how Harry wanted it to be. Draco. Just Draco and no one else. Harry would never need any one else after this. And he was okay with that; more than okay, even. He shifted his focus back onto answering Draco’s question.
. They’d all know you were my little bitch.”
, he kept telling himself, almost as a mantra to remind him "Hey! You could die right now!". The thought wasn't comforting, but it was an important one. He glanced around the room, noticing that it didn't seem like the person who wrote him the note was even there yet. He let his shoulders drop, he didn't know when he'd even tensed them, but he felt more comfortable now. His legs lazily carried him to the sofa in front of the fire that had haphazardly been left on - or rather, it had been lit recently? The thought crept up on Harry's mind just as he realised: He was most definitely
They both stayed there for a little bit, appreciating the afterglows of their mind-blowing orgasms, before Draco finally pulled out and walked over to Harry, who had collapsed over the chair. He wrapped his arms under and around Harry, carrying him into his arms, a pressing a kiss to the scar on his head. Harry was half asleep, but was conscious enough to give a half-minded smile at the soft gesture.
Harry swallowed.
"Quiet, love, I wasn't finished talking earlier. You're a bit foolish to write such personal things on paper. Especially when the person you've decided to spill your feelings about could of - and has, mind you - easily gotten access to."
“I don’t remember telling you that you were allowed to try relieve yourself.”
Seconds turned into minutes turned into what felt like hours but it all felt like torture. He was still bent over, his arms aching from how they held him up. Draco was stood behind him still, his eyes, sharp as his clever tongue, staring into Harry from behind. He squirmed under the other’s gaze ever so slightly, making sure not to move too much. He didn’t want to go against what he was told to do; he was a good boy, after all. Finally, the silence was broken.
"I don't think that is of any importance right now." He said, the fingers of his right hand rubbing against another as if they missed the feeling of his hawthorn wand. "Ives should be mindful of what he says to whom. This is his family, also."
Draco cocked his eyebrows, grinding his jaw in a way that Blaise knew he hated when it was someone else doing it instead. "I'll go and see what Adler knows. Maybe we can figure out where they took him."
The rage over that burned white and hot within Draco. Those precious moments had been private! This had been their day: Harry's, Blaise's and his. Their first date, and maybe if fate continued to be cruel to them it would even be their last… no one had the right to sully the memory of this very day!
Draco chuckled lowly. "Ah yes, I know: pulling out his chair for him. Really Blaise?"
A truly dangerously thrilling experience. And intoxicating.
But more than this first number to activate the portkey would never disturb the nocturnal air. While it might be stupid and naïve Harry couldn't be anything but who he was: loyal and courageous to a fault, a good friend… he couldn't leave Hermione and Ron behind at the mercy of their tormentors, knowing that in a few hours' time they'd be dead. And who knew how long they'd be flying? How long it would take the plane to land so that they could be reached through apparition? Surely too long. Surely the time was chosen so that Harry would have no chance to save them before they'd be slaughtered.
"It's fine like this." Harry murmured, and it honestly didn't bother him at all that the deep blue shirt was a glaring splash of colour in the otherwise sober and unpretentious room. He had thought it too stark anyway; of course it was a study and shouldn't be distracting, but really, Harry was rather used to chaos, having lived in a boys dormitory for so long and having spent so much precious time at the Burrow in Ron's room or the twins'; and one couldn't really say that living as a fugitive had been in any way conductive in bringing him up to be more orderly. Harry just couldn't help himself, but somehow it always reminded him of the Dursleys when an apartment was too neat; after all wasn't it alright if one could see that there were real people living in it?
"Unfortunately I haven't had much time, lately. Surely even your painted self couldn't have ignored that there was a war? I lost count of the numbers of trials I had to attend as a witness during the past month!"
Severus snorted disgustedly. "I told you, he is more trouble than he is worth."
Quickly, Harry continued his rushed but thorough exploration, his gaze flickering to his right where a wide alcove was embedded into the wall. There stood a pair of elegant leather chairs facing the room, a small, oval, table between them, delicately lathed and ornamented with rich carvings.
But it was not terrifying like he thought it might turn out to be, it was exhilarating, liberating. It was defying gravity and physical laws and hardships, the most pure form of freedom and weightlessness that Harry had ever known. And he had flown in a car and ridden on brooms and thestrals and Hyppogryphs and even a dragon. This outshone anything and everything else.
Blaise laughed as he worked on bringing the chariot closer to the newly appeared ring again, the sound merry and proud and challenging. "That's my colibrí!"
Pansy had known it, and enjoyed the attention and Draco's gifts while she could. And his kisses. Which had been acceptable.
And his cold gaze turned away from Harry, sweeping over Hermione's and Ron's forms on the ground of the plane towards something hidden from the Gryffindor's view outside of the mirror's frame behind his friends.
But why then – if it felt so good, if it was what the two dominants wanted from him – why then had Draco broken away? Why was he so disconcerted now? And he was, the Gryffindor knew him well enough to know when something unsettled him. Their long history as bitter enemies had taught Harry much about the blond and even though he had changed somewhat, had undeniably grown and matured since those days, he was still Draco Malfoy and his eyes still narrowed and flashed when he was confronted with something that displeased him greatly.
"Sorry." Blaise sighed and reached out for the other teen's hands, only to have his arm viciously slapped away.
One corner of his mouth twitched and he glanced down to another painting that seemed to be empty, only showing a magnificent rose garden. Then, silently, as if only to himself, he murmured "Not all of them are eager to mate."
"Don't!" Severus spoke up. "Whatever you do, don't touch the Dursleys. Potter wouldn't want anything to happen to them. They were even specifically protected from the Dark Lord during the war. He would turn on you."
Ron's corpse fell to the ground, collapsing into a heap of long limps as his killer released him from his levitation spell, like a puppet that had its strings cut. Harry stared and stared helplessly, his vision swimming from the upwelling tears, and he couldn't breathe from the sudden feeling of emptiness within him, the smothering, crushing weight of grief and loss and anger. His chest was so tight, his ribcage and his lungs started to ache, the hurtful sensation mingling with the agony in his stomach and heart.
“How?” she ground out, “How do you know they are fine? How is it that you had all this information, conveniently before us?”
At least this didn't seem as bad as their brilliant scheme of breaking into Gringotts without any inkling as to how to get out again.
If it did, Blaise and Draco would have them charmed away by a specialist and the muggle wouldn't live much longer…
"Are you alright?" He asked hesitantly, wondering if the blond would mind the question – sometimes Slytherins seemed awfully intent on pretending they had no feelings at all aside from pride in themselves, their families and their way of life.
A low moan escaped his lips as he curled his hand around the stiffening length of his arousal.
, and fast! Before he did something really stupid.
Of course, their parents would be furious if they didn't claim the submissive for themselves and really, it somewhat went against everything a Slytherin believed in to let such a chance at power and influence go by. If they didn't claim Potter and the enhancement in prestige, influence and power that he would bring, someone else would. Another pureblood family that might even rise above the Malfoys and Zabinis in consequence.
"Not until you let me explain!" Blaise growled back. It hadn't been his fault; both Harry and he had reacted on instinct. Mordred, he himself was almost as ignorant as Harry was when it came to mating; it wasn't as if he had thought he or any other dominant Vykélari would ever need that knowledge again, after all. No, they were all stumbling through this whole mess like bumbling fools and they needed to be a little bit more accommodating towards each other if they wanted to survive the following weeks with their sanity intact. And he needed to make Harry understand. Now.
Finally, Adler spoke, his posture and expression unwavering. "You would really do it, wouldn't you."
Though evidently, Harry's discomfort didn't keep him from speaking out in the end, in a hesitant, awkward mumble.
And now one last word of caution: just because the characters in my story say certain things doesn't mean they really believe that or are not lying to themselves.
... and a bit vengeful, too.
Did the other not escape? Not survive? Was it Blaise (please, oh please let it be Blaise) they would find in the entrance room of Damask Tower?
Well, there was only one way to find out.
He was drawn from his thoughts however, as that insufferable Mediwizard licked over his lips nervously and all but breathed his name almost reverently “Mr Malfoy…”
Harry shook off that thought and ducked down to hide himself. It would not do to be seen in this study next to a fireplace that was obviously connected to Italy's floo network. That is, if he hadn't already been discovered. Perhaps slightly paranoid, the Gryffindor took the chance to reassure himself that his captors had not followed him. This was his one chance to flee, and he wouldn't let his escape be thwarted by his own rashness…
And yet, it wasn't the integrity of her safe house that Amalyne was concerned with. God no; she already knew someone was in there, because one of the portkeys of her son and future son-in-law had been activated. It was the question of who it was, and in what condition that tore through her mind like a whirlwind of razor blades; scarring fears that were bound to leave some form of neurosis like the mementos of a battle.
After Blaise and Draco had secured their wands in holsters at their forearms, the three of them made their way down the several terraces that formed the extensive gardens of Lanai Manor; past patios that snuggled into the earth and the plants as if they had always been there and grown with them, almost blending into the nature. Most often the seating arrangements were wrought of intertwined living plants or carefully hewn into larger boulders; white or fawn or light blue cushions seemed to invite the onlooker for a rest and the little rivulet of a stream danced along downwards next to them in a glittering, silver ribbon, splashing serenely and sometimes crossing their path, a quiet companion on their way to the beach.
Harry laid his head back against Blaise’s shoulder, nudging his neck in a silent thank you because he didn’t think words would make it past the grin literally splitting his face in two, didn’t think that he would ever be able to explain the tsunami of emotions surging within him, flooding him. This had been worth everything, maybe even becoming a bird.

Like the last time they had been in this long stretched galleria, the morning sun falling through the line of tall, wide windows swathed the room in a faintly white-golden, almost surreal glow and threw long shadows onto the pale walls, marbleized with tones of beige and sandstone. And over it all was, resplendent, the assembly of Roman gods, gazing down at them from their aloft position in the breathtaking fresco adorning the arched ceiling.
An involuntary snarl left Draco and his claws raked over the wood of the windowsill, leaving deep scrapes in the paint. Harry was half naked, wearing only light footwear and no shirt at all, the elegant markings swirling and streaming down the sides of his torso for everyone to see. Only the thin fabric of his pyjama bottoms clung to his legs, at least partly covering him. The idea of someone else – another Vykélari dominant for that matter – to see him like this was intolerable, a barbed arrow in his chest.
"Not like me." Blaise concluded the tirade, biting his lip. "I'm sorry, Draco. I wasn't there when you needed me, when I should have been. And I'm sorry."
Beyond the tight circle of this quartet of guards, the room emerged as a spacious hall with only a few pieces of dark, wooden furniture lining the rather ancient looking, pale grey stone walls: a lean side table stood centred at the wall behind him, right beneath a wide mirror. It was decorated with an artful floral arrangement of different grasses, small red and yellow flowers and a few, long and thin feathers. A gaunt, almost delicate man, bent with age, stood beside it and considered him thoughtfully, assessing him through still sharp eyes that seemed like small but shining, murky brown gems in between all those deep furrows and wrinkles, a face that seemed as ancient as the stones the man leaned against for support, burned and lined from decades over decades of a busy, eventful life.
Mordred was he glad that his crossed legs were hiding his growing erection. It wouldn't do to scare the skittish creature further. The beautiful thing, even though he was obviously scared, even though the ropes looked so
For a terrible moment that he would hate himself later for, Harry was enchanted by that possibility, but it was something that he had been yearning for so desperately for such a long time, who could anyone fault him for wanting it, whatever the cost: sweet and peaceful and everlasting safety?
"It amazes me that you still find things to brood over after such a day." Draco murmured quietly into his ear with a hint of laughter in his voice before breaking away completely again as if he couldn't bear to stay still.
"Because he died so early?" He answered only half-jestingly, tilting his head and watching with interest as one of Adler's hands closed tensely around the armrest, even though his voice was still quiet as he continued.
"And why would she tell them?" Harry sneered, because he felt so damn out of his element.
"In fact, sweet, it wasn't. Did it ever occur to you that maybe we did nothing but be the hosts to an honoured guest? Nothing we gave you was really that extraordinary."
A shudder, a tightening of muscles as if in agony, a low moan and Blaise came in Draco's hand, the pale fingers moving forward to catch the pearly liquid spurting out. His other arm wound around his lover's torso, pulling the dark, unresisting body against his chest to offer some support even if it might not be needed. But he relished in the heaving of Blaise's ribcage that he could feel so much better in this position and in the still frantic pounding of the heart that he had claimed, reflected in the rapid, rhythmic movement of the carotid that was beating there so close to Draco's own lips beneath a thin layer of sweat covered skin.
By Morgaine's perfidy! For a moment, Draco found himself speechless, something that he could honestly claim didn't happen very often. But he couldn't even decide whether his thoughts raced or were pushed into momentary rigidity; too busy trying to find his way through the too many too conflicting notions and thoughts fighting for dominance within the too cramped confines of his head: outrage, mortification,
Lucius might have enjoyed dominating someone, or using his instincts against him to subdue him, but Draco did not and neither did Blaise. At least not someone meant to be a spouse.
But Draco's own erection was almost painfully hard by now, straining against his lover's behind and weeping onto his lower back. And he hadn't more than a few moments of patience in him before he moved back a little bit, enough to coat his thrumming flesh with the sticky substance on his fingers.
"He was afraid." Draco said at last after some more moments of silence. "His first transformation must have been … traumatic at best. So, to alleviate his apprehensions, Blaise proposed to establish a temporary connection. Which I blame you for, by the way. You shouldn't have encouraged him so much this morning." He looked up in time to see Adler hide a smirk and glared at him sharply, but he wasn't really in the mood any more to play games.
He flushed, lowering his gaze only to feel his chin lifted by Zabini’s gentle, bronzed fingers. “Quite alright, Potter…”
"Your magic is still bleeding out." Draco grumbled above him, the anger in his voice and expression oddly contrasting with the gentleness of his fingers as they moved to cup Harry's painfully tense neck.
There really was no choice at all and so Blaise simply nodded as if there had never been a question whether or not Harry would be able to contact his friends. "Okay."
"Okay?" Harry repeated, more than a little bit surprised and wary at the easy victory. He really hadn't expected them to relent, not that fast, not without a fight.
“Relax!” Draco whispered against his skin, his breath tickling the skin on Harry’s throat, as his head was still lying on the blonde’s shoulder, and Draco’s voice sounded strangely deep and breathless, making Harry shiver.
Blaise silently smirked to himself as he remembered how Harry couldn't help staring at them and his thoughts inevitably returned to his and Draco's current conversation about having others watching them.
But still the hushed voices he heard appeared to be very much annoyed, even though he couldn't understand the words being said: they hissed and swelled and ebbed away again like the distant rumbling of a maelstrom, one Harry hoped wouldn't suck him in and crush and drown him. Because Harry could only think of one single reason why the two Slytherins might be mad at him, and that reason, while not truly scaring him, made him at least apprehensive of their reactions: they must have found out about that letter he had written to Hermione and Ron only the day before. Maybe the house elf he had asked for help had babbled his secret out to its master and now he would probably be put under constant supervision because of it. Maybe they would cancel the meeting with his friends now. Harry sighed while sitting up one again to confront the two Slytherins, only the thought of that made him miserable, he needed, really
He opened his arms, lifted his hands palms up in a gesture that might have been misunderstood as a surrender.
Quickly, Severus leaped up, furious anger written all over his face. "You want them to bond? Now I
Severus smirked quietly to himself.
And undeniably that fear was there, hanging over his head ominously like the Sword of Damocles. However confident he felt, however much he trusted in his and Blaise's abilities and refused to acknowledge the possibility of another failure, a tiny part of him could not ignore the fact that Harry might now never become theirs.
Draco narrowed his eyes, wondering why the healer was already trying to justify himself. But he found himself to be mostly surprised at the flaring anger in his chest, anger on Potter's behalf.
"If you need me to do something about the article… I could help, you know?"
It was undeniable that Harry had been in the literal centre of most events throughout the entire time of the war and even though it had been comparably short and though he was not really traumatized it certainly hadn't left him unaffected. His battle instincts and reflexes were well-marked nowadays and almost ever present when he was in the company of someone he didn't know very well or trust completely; and his prolonged existence as a fugitive had instilled in him a deep appreciation of the simpler luxuries that a regular daily routine could offer: he consciously enjoyed being able to sleep in on a soft mattress in a solid house more than he ever had, he appreciated a good, sometimes even a fancy meal whenever he wished it and which he didn't have to gulp down quickly and he loved taking long, hot baths or a relaxing shower instead of having to resort to cleaning charms.
If he hadn't been prepared for it to happen, Harry knew he would have cringed or frozen for a possibly fatal second when with a sudden flick of his wand, Valerio let the heavy, white curtain flutter to the ground, burying the old wizard's fallen body in a heap of cloth and folds and opening the plane's inner abdomen to the night, the place that had become his friends' torture chamber.
That aside … "So this is how a bond is like, then? We would be so closely connected that we'd share the same heartbeat and our emotions?"
A shadow fell down onto the grass next to his feet and a moment later, Draco stood at his side and gave him an oddly serene smile that had Harry raise one eyebrow in questioning. The only answer he got, though, was a widening of that odd smile, then the blond turned away from him without further ado and let his wand fall into the open palm of his slender hand with a graceful twirl - that Harry might have been envious of had he found pleasure in such pretentiousness - and his wand arm moved in a complicated pattern, fast and sure as if he had done that specific spell million times before, an unintelligible murmur falling from his lips. Once Draco's smooth voice lapsed into silence, a small mirror appeared in front of Harry, gleaming in the light of the sun that still stood low behind them.
“How?” Narcissa snarled demandingly, taking a step towards him.
"Where's the honour in that?"
No, it seemed that for the moment he need to play by the rules and bide his time.
"Yes, I know," Ives smiled a little bit sheepishly, pushing his long cascade of hair back over his shoulder. "You know one of my elder brother's descendants. His line never showed the active submissive traits though, and now the male line is extinct after Molly's brothers Gideon and Fabian died. I was very sorry to hear that."
"Hesperides' Nectar. It is made of a variety of apples that my father's family cultivates. A rather expensive treat since the trees themselves need magic to grow, which the farmers have to infuse them with - there are just so few places nowadays with natural magic and the ones that exist are protected and can't be used for farming." Zabini explained, watching Harry intently.
And, damn it, he had led his friends too often into danger. Hermione and Ron had a future with each other now to look forward to, they needed to live their own lives now that they had survived the war. It was not fair if he took that away from them again.
"Let go!" The brunet hissed, no hint of insecurity in his voice, no trace of turmoil that might lead Draco to doubt his sincerity. Harry had made a momentous decision and now his future, at least the immediate one, didn't include Blaise and him. Pushed aside for someone more important, discarded again and again and again by his former nemesis, his obsession – he
Taide could feel his heart stop, expecting,
Alarmed, Blaise eyed his future father-in-law warily, taking in the harsh lines of fury on his face, cracks and fissures in the once so solid wall of control the blonde usually cultivated, wondering when he had ever seen him lose his bearings before like this and coming up blank. He had not been there of course, to see how the Malfoy patriarch had held himself during the war, but the vision he presented now was so far from the sophisticated, superior aristocrat he knew, it made him step back involuntarily, as if loss of control was a disease he might contract.
And who, by Morgaine's wrath, had had the splendid idea of bringing in McGonagall? Or the Minister? After all it wasn't as if the two of them held dark families in high esteem, not to mention families that had been strongly linked to the dark lord, had belonged to his innermost circle.
And the world shifted, unsteady and volatile as his mind sought for a way to align it with his own recollection of the past day. Suddenly there were memories warring against one another in a violent battle, happenings that had taken place simultaneously but that his mind couldn't quite reduce to a common denominator. Before his inner eye fleeting sensations of a few hours ago uncoiled like fragile blossoms opening themselves to the feeble morning sun, hints of voices and sounds and smells and images:
"And afterwards I don't. Want. You. To punish. Yourself. Is that clear?"
Draco clicked with his tongue, eyes narrow as they fixed the small, dark figure in the painting with a burning glare. Yes, that he could very well imagine: Adler shouting at the Elf to go and the little servant leaving  immediately without waiting for further instructions. Being already displeased and nervous at having to spy on his master, but unable to disobey all the same because Blaise had made him vow his unquestioning obedience to the portrait, the Elf probably took the chance to avoid any further orders that he might have perceived as a betrayal to his master.
But at that crucial moment something had paralyzed his vocal cords, even though Taide had known that he was the only one who could still save them.
So instead she passively watched her friend hesitate and almost falter without uttering even one supportive word, and for a moment Narcissa imagined the silence freezing between them, layers of ice on a frozen lake, and Amalyne drowning in the dark depths beneath her. Drowning in silence. While she was freezing to death in it.
But nonetheless they didn't allow their conversation to become awkward, telling him about themselves instead when it became obvious that Harry was not feeling very talkative. It was no surprise for him that both boys had a major interest for politics, and neither that both of them did not intend to engage in them openly for at least some years. The Malfoy name was still linked to Voldemort and it would take time and effort until it commanded more than fear, until it was backed by more than wealth; and the Zabinis, while remaining neutral had now allied with the Malfoys through the engagement of both families' heirs.
But it would allow him to guide it during the transformation and should Potter ever mate – not that he would have a say in the matter anyway – his mates would have a much easier time trying to tame that power.
”Did you enjoy it?” She asked with a trembling voice, her thumb rubbing over the smooth surface of her wand. ”Playing our fears off against us?”
"Fuck you!" It was no more than a whisper.
But it wasn't the familiarity that stroke Draco, that sudden feeling of a Déjà Vu, no, it was the gaze of his mother and her pose; so painfully stiff and tense, as if someone had tried to cast a Body-Bind curse at her that had terribly gone wrong. It was the very same posture that she had almost permanently adapted during those nightmarish months when their home had hosted Death Eaters and the Dark Lord in person, the months when Draco and his parents had almost become prey in their own home, working animals that had served their time and were waiting for their master to make time and butcher them.
"I believe you!" Harry called out and strained against Taide's hold, unable to let this go on much further. Somehow he knew this would become epically bad. "I don't need a proof!"
"Some other time, Blaise." He said, his voice loud and clear. "You have to understand how frustrating it must be, not getting anyone to share something of importance with but a filthy mud-blood." Even despite the enraged outcry of the three Weasley men who seemed about ready to attack them and the shouts of Granger and Weaslette to let it be, Draco smirked complacently. It was just so amusing that this respective insult never failed from having the desired effect.
That had been the first ring Harry had caught that day and by far not the last. Blaise, Draco and Harry had, in fact, been leading when Piero managed to slow down their horse and their team scored the 80 points from arriving first at the goal, points that lead to their victory.
In front of him Draco sighed, a sound so tired and frustrated that it tore at Blaise like a squall and suddenly he was afraid of losing him – not to war and death this time but to a mistake that he hadn't acknowledged, hadn't rectified in time.
He didn't allow himself to ponder what might have happened if Draco hadn't looked up at that very moment or if Alfar hadn't been just in time. He didn't
Seconds passed like an eternity in hell and Severus clawed his fingers into the tub's rim until his knuckles were white, because the trembling was worse.
"He loves me, Draco." The man said in answer to Draco's exclamation, calmly as if he had stated an axiom, an unchallengeable, irrefutable point of reason stifling every possible refutation.
“Oh, come on, mate!” Ron spoke up, his patronizing voice and expression telling the dark haired wizard just how naïve he thought him to be.
Within a moment he had yanked the offending trousers down sufficiently, baring lean hips, strong thighs, twitching muscles and oh so wonderfully, luxuriously smooth skin that just begged him for a more thorough exploration; but as soon as his fingers glided over the side of Blaise's leg upwards, the Italian started to struggle against his hold and Draco had to press his whole body flush against his lover's to keep him in his grip.
"But that doesn't give you the right to treat me like you have." He said finally, calmer now but irritated and insistent nonetheless. "You could have simply explained; we are no longer 15, for God's sake! And I'm not sorry for writing the letter, though I regret if it'll put you or Draco in jeopardy."
"Now if you want, I will allow your magic into my body to observe my complete transformation." Draco offered, carefully watching the dumbfounded expression of a clearly out-of-his-depth Harry.. "But this time you will stay in contact with your magic and try to feel what it encounters."
Draco had returned to the conference room not much later and told his lover the essentials of his findings in hushed voices so that no other would know of the means they had used to come by that information (if anyone learned of the spying potion, questions were bound to arise, questions about where else it had been deployed and that might lead to a reconsideration of Narcissa's and even Draco's cases, not to mention the almost sure conviction of Lucius).
"Zabini, Malfoy." Ron nodded once, his jaw and voice tight but for now it should better be enough for those snakes if he conveyed his willingness to talk, they couldn't expect him to be polite.
, or the deal with Ives was off. He was not changing himself, not for just anyone and never if he didn't think it justified.
But the Gryffindor was having none of it, he just wanted to get a safe distance away from the mind control he had just experienced. And god, all that after he had honestly tried giving them a chance at Ives' request as best as he could; and now they threw his trust into the dirt and stomped right over it. He felt betrayed. God, but he should have known that something like this would happen. Conniving, lying, scheming Slytherin bastards.
"Besides," Blaise murmured reassuringly with a small smile, "both Draco and I will assist you in directing your magic."
It translated to nothing but the insignificance of being able to address your enemy, the meaningless ability to put a name to the face you never wanted to see again. In the end, Harry would still be required to leave Lanai Manor behind, to betray and leave Draco and Blaise and that thought burned so surprisingly hot and painful in his mind, that Harry let it go immediately.
alienate him.
Smiling a little bit hesitantly, Blaise swam towards the blond, still unsure of what was to come.
Of course he had known that they didn't have many allies, that it would be difficult to find someone willing and able to help them, but he hadn't quite expected this amount of opposition…
But then again, that might be even worse in the current situation. Some of them were Vykélari dominants themselves, or were in contact with others of their kind. The news of a submissive fledging at that very moment might be disastrous for his plans.
"What?" Harry demanded, his gaze wandering between the three other men. "Since when are
Harry transforms himself and Draco and Blaise teach him how to fly.
Then he stepped away and raised his wand to cut away those offending leather straps, his slender fingers gently pressing down on the limps he was freeing whenever Potter tried to move them, indicating him to stay silent, or else, of that he was sure, the beautiful idiot would manage to hurt himself further.
"Other dominants? I think Harry should be kept away from
He really should be going, Harry thought idly. He should go on with his plan and search the floo powder that must be somewhere close and flee. But he hesitated for a moment, curiosity getting the better of him - though curiosity about what, Harry really couldn't tell; maybe it was just some kind of sick fascination.
her collection (there was nothing better to efficiently get and spread certain information), bespoke of a certain sense of awareness for the situation: if Blaise and Draco thought that enabling Potter to speak with his friends was the logical thing to do, that it was crucial for a successful mating, and that it didn't betray emotions they shouldn't have towards the Boy Wonder, they would just have asked one of their parents to give up a mirror, Mrs Zabini was even currently living at Malfoy Manor and not even using her own mirrors...
Half overcome with sickening worry, half with the dizzying nearness of another dominant that had his stomach in knots, Harry searched an anchor in the sight of his friends, fervently reassuring himself that they were alive and had not been tormented further; but they wouldn't even face him and Harry could only hope that they wouldn't hate him for this, and that the pair of devils weren't discussing their demise right at this moment here in front of him. Or more elaborate methods of torture.
And with a last "Yes, young master!" the small elf was gone.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Blaise said, still smiling. "It's just…"
"Well, isn't that wonderful!" Parkinson quipped with a fake smile, sarcasm dripping from her lips like drool from Fang's mouth.
Draco and Blaise talk to their parents and Severus via a two-way-mirror connection, telling them of their decision to court Harry but also that they won't force him into it, to which Lucius, Amalyne and Narcissa agree. Severus tells the Malfoys and Zabinis of Harry's past with the Dursleys.
Surprised, Harry looked up. "You didn't want to be a Vykélari?"
Draco saw the birds draw together right in front of him, heard Blaise’s shout from behind and the sound curled around his chest and throat like a Devil’s Snare. Of course it wasn’t entirely unexpected that the birds launched an attack: they would have seen him coming long before they could have possibly sensed his magical aura and recognized him; Draco was still holding onto the feint hope that they would veer away as soon as they did, there was still time for them to do so… but the apparent aptness of the bird’s every movement made his skin crawl and he knew he had to be prepared to break through their barrier, not with brute force like a magical battering ram, but with the exact piercing power of a quarrel…
"And do you have any proof of that preposterous accusation?"
"The phenomenon was named after an English submissive, Ceadda. Historian's are unsure of the specifics, but in an attack of his home in the late 8th century by at least two mated pairs, Ceadda's own bond mate was killed and he himself mortally wounded. Desperate to defend his clan, he caused a magical explosion large enough to be seen for many miles. The land was burned and utterly destroyed, as were the attackers, but those that remained of Ceadda's clan at that point survived with no further injury. It is said though, that a darkness resided in them for a long time afterwards. It may have been weeks or even years, for all we know."
"Then you know why we came." Molly hissed, furious beyond reason that this woman could stand there so carefree and serene and admit so freely to having kidnapped their Harry, because really, why else would she expect them?
Blinking once, twice to recollect himself, Blaise focused on Harry's almost pleading expression again that told him - them - in no unclear terms that they would be wise to not ask for more, to not ask for the submissive's trust and unconditional cooperation while they hadn't yet proven themselves to him, because Harry couldn't give it.
!  And now he felt so shamefully uncomfortable in his too tight trousers, possibly harder than he had ever been before, and oh, please, don't let him see it… god, why the hell did Blaise have to kiss him? And after he knew that he could control Harry... he almost groaned as an idea struck him: what if that had been Blaise's magic urging him to act on his desire - if those were his feelings at all. The Italian was probably as helpless as he was.
The atmosphere in the Burrow had been tense during the last few days, with the memory of Harry's dramatic transformation as an ever-present shadow hanging oppressively over the dining table and the knowledge of where the young wizard was, with whom and for what reason weighting heavily on everyone's mind.
He might have reached for his wand to vanish them altogether, had Blaise not grabbed his collar and pulled him in for a harsh, forceful kiss, teeth clashing almost painfully against his as the Italian sought to take the control that up to this moment had almost solely lain in Draco's hands.
But their Gryffindor was still here where they could protect him and their enemy had transformed from a bodiless phantom of smoke and shadows into something real, had solidified into a being of flesh and blood that could be fought and could be defeated. Even better: it turned out to be an enemy they knew so that they could follow him if he retreated and take him down, could deduce where to find Harry's friends and save them – there was no doubt in his mind that they were the bargaining tool used against the submissive in this vile attempt at blackmail, not after Harry's reaction to Blaise's so innocently voiced proposal – and decide on the best suited strategy for all of these options based on the knowledge they held over their enemy.
"Promise me!" He urged and Harry startled a bit before he turned his gaze downwards again, letting his fingers wander over the smooth rings of the invisible chain hesitatingly, a shiver running down his spine. But this was Blaise's emergency portkey, what if something
"I already explained some of it during your transformation yesterday night."
Rage and hate flooded Harry, swamping his body, leaving enough room only for a single realisation, a single desire, a single vision.
"A kind offer, Ives, but you don't have to." Adler said, an unusual softness in his voice.
With her help the service of the Dracen Cynn soon included the substitution of the Wespenzauber with a harmless illusion and the supply of so-called weapons-grade wands that usually only Aurors and licensed private personal protectors were allowed to possess.
Now she only needed to come to that realisation as well.
"Actually," Draco said with a certain, grave quality to his voice, "we need to speak with the three of you."
"But we won't." Malfoy said insistently. "That should tell you something, Weasley. Instead, in answer to your promise, I in turn vow that I will not force Harry to mate. I can't promise to never go against his wishes or force him to do something he might not like, because sometimes certain situations might force our hands, especially with someone as eager to endanger himself as Harry is. But I promise to try and do right by him to the best of my ability."
Now it flared.
It reared its massive head, stretched it forward and roared at Draco in a voice so deep and all-pervasive that it vibrated through even the marrow of his bones. Draco froze, all too aware just how powerful this beast was. But he didn’t retreat, couldn’t have moved in this moment even if he wished it, and the shadow stag jumped forward in irritation, stamping its long legs threateningly. A shower of bluish sparks sprayed into the night where its hooves smashed onto the stones and magic danced around its legs like electric currents.
"Hold yourselves back!" He said. "We have no right to be here since the Auror department told us in no unclear terms to back off. And please, let me do the talking."
"Harry!" Draco yelled, his voice ringing out in the otherwise silent night, and again with even more desperation when he was ignored but with as little success. Harry was leaving the manor and it seemed as if there was nothing he could do about it.
How could an enemy have reached Harry here in Lanai Manor, the home of his deceased father and his own refuge? How? How could anyone find the unholy means to blackmail Harry Potter, the vanquisher of the Dark Lord, to anything he didn't want? It was surreal, a notion that fought with claws and teeth against being understood and ingrained into his thinking.
"And you don't?" Harry asked quietly, staring up at the Slytherin he had barely known before this whole mess had started.
Adler had smiled at him understandingly and said that this was somewhat of a foretaste of the establishing process of a mating bond that would allow them to permanently share their magic and, if they so wished, their thoughts and feelings. And he had also explained how to deliberately install a temporary bond like that while keeping control of one's magic.
In spite of what Blaise conceived as an undeniable truth, the blonde whirled around and Blaise almost drew back in surprise, rarely having seen his lover as angry as this. The silver eyes had darkened to a stormy grey and the lean pale fingers were bent to strike, nails growing into sharp claws. A crown of feathers rose from his platinum blonde hair, imposing and threatening in their show of dominance, gleaming in the pale light to show off his magical strength.
Harry tells his friends what happened so far and informs them of the letter. Hermione and Ron confirm that Harry basically has no rights concerning Vykélari courtship and mating. They read an article to him that was published that morning by Sonia Crane: through an interview with a Mediwizard it is described what happened in the hospital. A historian specializing on purebloods and Vykélari (Jennifer Palmer) describes what be happening to Harry now (forced to mate, share his magic, refer to his husbands in matters such as employment, in time birth a heir). The article criticizes the purebloods, the Malfoys (emphasizing their role in the war as Death Eaters) and social structures where there are ministry independent institutions mostly run by purebloods and demands that the ministry interferes.
The way the brunet took a deep breath told Lucius that this was going to be a long monologue full of evasions and unsatisfactory excuses. He almost sighed at the prospect.
Around her tall frame, Narcissa couldn't see very well, and nothing of importance, and it was maddening.
"We didn't harm you despite of having the chance multiple times now, and I owe you a life debt. Why would we harm you now?" Malfoy asked in turn, his head cocked to one side and his face blazing in a flash of sunlight that made his eyes pale so much that Harry thought he might have been looking at a demon who had no iris but only two contracted little points of deepest black that seemed to pierce him right through.
Growling Blaise whipped out his wand before Lucius could try to pressure Draco even further and snarled at him "We are not going to force Harry or allow you to come anywhere near him while he is still unmated!"
Blaise frowned, shifting his weight from one foot to the other with a hint of annoyance piercing his movements, making them harsh and abrupt. "The article was the usual Prophet nonsense, Daphne! We didn't mistreat him, we never attempted to force him to mate – Merlin, we didn't even intend to mate him in the first place when we brought him to Lanai Manor! Not really. All we did was bring him to my manor here in Italy and yes, we kept him from leaving, for Merlin's sake! But that was…"
"Don't!" Harry growled and now he did step back until his back was pressed tightly against the copper-coloured wings behind him and he glared at the Italian somewhat fiercely as if he could force him to let him go with his eyes alone.
"You, too?"
Draco stopped short. By Merlin, his magic! It was very much sentient… whether in its own right, or because it was a part of Harry’s subconscious, it didn’t matter… it was capable of feelings and logic, as primitive as it might be. Even with Harry out cold, his magic would still be capable of making decisions.
It was a grave mistake and Draco realised it as soon as he heard the aggressive snort to his right. He froze, seeing from the corner of his eye the steely gleam of the stag’s antlers, poised to spear him. A thousand half-formed thoughts rushed through his mind, vague images and notions and the one certain knowledge that he could neither outrun nor dodge the impersonation of Harry’s rage.
"For now, I don't think that it will be a problem." Draco said thoughtfully. "He seemed to be agreeable to stay at least until he has learned how to control his magic. For once his saviour complex works in our favour: he doesn't want to endanger anyone. Until he has learned how to harness it, he will stay, so we might have two or three weeks."
His Cynn. Draco always had to smirk inwardly at that word. Like the Wizengamot, it had germanic roots, in some way it was a kind of sarcastic wink to his adversaries of the ministry he guessed. But for Draco and the few Slytherin friends that had joined him in his venture, it was more than that. It was a homage to their traditions, to the past of the magical community in Britain itself and to the age-old values and rites that the Dark Lord should have honoured but hadn't.
of all people, if Draco assented that is. He would never risk losing Draco. The blonde was too precious to him.
And with that thought, Blaise finally tensed and with a last deep thrust he spilled himself into the tight channel of his lover.
They had no idea where exactly they were. Something had ended their journey prematurely, forcefully, leaving them stranded in some vinery, rows of the gnarled plants extending into the darkness beyond the circle of light that the House Elves had conjured. And there was only one possible conclusion: the Lanais had warded their country estate against House Elf apparition.
He still didn’t know how he felt about that.
"How did you react?" she asked, leaning forward. "You know that sometimes it is leniency that wins favour."
Hermione would never have thought that she'd ever have to return to the very place that she had been tortured in by Bellatrix Lestrange. Nevertheless, she now stood here in front of the dark building, willingly waiting for someone to come and allow them entrance. It would probably be a House Elf. But she couldn't bring herself to care right now.
It was a young female Elf, covered in the remains of a pale curtain with dark edging, her eyes rolling in the overly large sockets from left to right, from Blaise to Draco. Fidgety she seemed and anxious as she wrung her long-fingered hands, her drooping bat-like ears trembling.
Just then a dull thud had Blaise whip his head around before his uncle even had the chance to answer. His heart faltered at what he saw, making a distant part of his mind wonder how often Harry could do that to him before it would just give up beating altogether.
He rushed to his feet while next to him Draco stepped forward unconsciously. "Don't you dare!" he hissed, uncaring that the Gryffindor wouldn't be able to hear him. It was obvious what Potter was up to, the way he was searching the area around the chimney. The floo connected chimney.
The emotions Blaise had sensed during their connection had quietened Draco's concerns somewhat and even appeased him enough to not be overly angry at his fiancé for having lost his control so spectacularly with the younger submissive.
Fingers pressed against his throat then in retaliation, sharp, claw-like nails threatening the delicate skin; not enough to draw blood or to hamper his breathing, but enough to be felt a little bit more with every excited beat of his heart echoing through his carotid, every intake of breath. And this time there really was a snarl distorting Draco's lips. But Blaise didn't back away and didn't try to break the other dominant's hold on him, encountering the intense stare evenly, challengingly.
A glance to his side, though, sobered him up quickly. Draco's stony expression as he kept on staring at the article, had him reach out for his lover worriedly.
"Harry?" Blaise inquired again.
The first charm he had been able to contextualise had originated from Zabini's wand. It was nothing extraordinary, just a sticking charm that the young man had activated on the ground of a Pihassan chariot; but it indicated that they had either played pugna aerea or had used them as an exotic means of transportations. Either way, they had left the grounds of Lanai Manor and there had to be witnesses, because in certain circles it was a common knowledge that neither Zabini, nor the Lanais owned winged horses, preferring to rent the animals instead of investing the extensive time and care needed to create and cultivate the unique bond between beast and wizard. In fact the Battellis often used their most frequent clients, the illustrious Lanai family, to advertise their services. They must have brought a chariot to Zabini, who was a Lanai by association, and they had also fetched them later on, because the Britishers had only used the vehicles once. If Ettore was lucky, the Pihassan's owner had seen the young submissive, could maybe attest to his treatment…
I need you to touch me, please I can’t take it anymore!” Harry begged as much as he could with his neck stretched out. He let out occasional small gasps and whimpers since he’d started rocking against the chair, which Malfoy had quickly taken notice of. Draco released his grip on Harry’s hair and stepped away. He whined from the loss of touch, and started to move himself of the couch before Draco growled an obvious command at him: ‘Don’t move’.
“Draco-“
"-I just
"Amazing what you can do with a bag of owl treats." Draco had began to smirk, straightening himself up and tucking his hands into his trouser pockets, Harry's eyes following their movement.

not to run into Malfoy. That smug bastard would find a way to ruin his day somehow. Draco always found a way to get underneath his skin with his snark remarks that were practically dripping with cockiness. Merlin, how Harry wished he could just walk over to him when he said those things and shut him up. He wasn't sure how he'd shut him up, exactly, but he would find a way! Everyone has a weakness, even stuck-up blondes who are too big for their boots.
Harry had began to laugh, starting off a chain reaction in Draco as well. Damn his contagious laughter!
"Don't lie to me, you know you don't need to."
Fuck.
“Mhm, and you’re not going to do it again, are you, darling?”
"What do you want, Malfoy? How did you get Hedwig to send me that letter?" Harry asked.
Maybe losing control wasn't all that bad.
“Fuck, fine. I don’t know how much longer I’d last with you moaning like that anyways.”
"Why did you want me here, Malfoy? And no playing around, I mean it." Harry spat at Draco. His hands had began to clench at his sides. This is the last thing he needed. To be in a room. Alone. With
Harry considered just forgetting about it all, leaving to go and find Hermione and Ron and
“Daddy please- I’m so close to cumming already, I cant-“
That's where it had gone.
" Draco leaned in closer to his face. "Honestly, baby, how long did you think you could hide this little secret from me?" Harry whined around his fingers. "Fucking hell, Potter." Draco pushed his fingers down on Harry's tongue, making him close his eyes. "I'm sure that pretty little mouth can be used for something better than interrupting me. Suck."
