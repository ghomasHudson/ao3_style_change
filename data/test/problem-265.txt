Belle. A. Lestrange
It was later that same day after Charms that Potter caught him and gave him a rough jerk on the shoulder. Draco scowled down at him and adopted his haughtiest look, hoping to strike some fear into the brunette, however the only thing he saw in those green eyes was anger. Potter leaned closer and hissed close to Draco's ear, "I can make you scream louder than a mandrake."
Harry's lips quirked a little before he ran a hand through his damp hair, "Is it wrong for me to admit that I'm glad you have a different healer?" he asked, sounding half-ashamed at the admission.
Draco was not convinced but he tried not to show it as he turned the key in the ignition. He had been doing everything right. He'd gotten Harry to have more exercise, and some descent food along with his vile medication -and yet there was something that was a little off with his fianc√©. He just couldn't put his finger on it.
"Oh I already have a job like that," he replied flippantly.
Blaise huffed as he adjusted his bag on his shoulder as his class was dismissed from the potions classroom.
Wadding everything into a ball, he tossed it in the bin before snagging another load of tissue and heading back into the bedroom.
Pansy shook her head, "I watched them for two hours this afternoon, and short of sending each other gooey stares when they think the other isn't looking is about as soppy as it got!" She stabbed at her chicken so roughly that her goblet teetered on the table and a few of the first years scooted further away in their seats. She sighed and threw her fork down on the table, "Are you
He tried not to think about Harry too much. He couldn't control it, but he did try his best. He tried not to think about Harry when he was sleep in bed, or in the shower. He tried, dear Merlin knew he tried! It was too hard though; those bright green eyes would make his breath hitch whenever the raven-haired teen would look at him across the classroom or the Great Hall. His skin would break out into goosepimples or his stomach would flip. He hated to think what that might mean, but he decided it was because he was finally getting what he wanted; a friendship with Harry Potter.
"Oh really Potter?" Malfoy spat, his voice rough and hoarse, no doubt, from crying. "Then why are you here? Stalking me again?" At Harry's pursed lips, he sneered, "Yeah, you
"Never, baby," Draco breathed as he run his hands down Harry's body, ignoring how thin his once athletic lover had gotten. He quickly removed his hoodie and tugged Harry's shirt off tossing both off of the side of the bed and proceeded to smooth his warm hands down Harry's body. He nuzzled Harry's throat as he felt cool fingertips touching his own body, his muscles quivering at the tenderness of the touch. Harry's ragged breathing made Draco desperate to kiss every inch of exposed skin on Harry's body. "So soft," he breathed as he fingered the waistband of Harry's boxers, having kicked his jeans off at some point whilst Draco had been sleeping.
"Do whatever you want," he finally submitted unable to deny the obvious lust burning its way through his chest as he looked up into Draco's arousing smoky grey eyes. The taste of his mouth still hot and wet on Harry's lips as he licked them, "Do whatever you want to me, Draco Malfoy; just don't you dare make me regret a moment of it!"
Harry felt a heat creep up his neck and he felt his stomach knot in some dread. "Of course Professor," he managed to choke out before draining his flute in one gulp to regain a little bit of confidence. He was escorted across the room to where a group of tall older men were standing together in crisp black dress robes and talking over their flutes. One of them, no doubt Draco's father by the look of the white-blonde hair and pinched expression, grasped a cane in his left hand with a silvery snake wrapped around the head of the walking appliance. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that the cane was more for show than for actually aid the older man.
"My abysmal letters make you worked up enough to want to bottom with me?" Harry asked disbelievingly, his face set into a dead-pan expression.
"W-what are you doing?" he asked as he gazed down with wide eyes at Draco kneeling down on the hardwood floors, basking in the glow of the candlelight and resting there in all his naked glory that had matured over the last two decades. He was breath-taking, and it reminded Harry of the night that he had asked Draco a very important question.
He glanced at his watch and smiled slightly; it would be little under an hour before they reached Blackpool, and once they were checked into the hotel, they could take Seeker along for a walk on the beach and stop off to get some food. His own stomach grumbled happily at the thought of an impending meal.
The following morning before breakfast he found a neat little parcel wrapped and tucked under his pillow at some point during the night. It was soft and squished easily between his fingers. He gingerly opened the wrapping and he felt his stomach swirl with emotions. In his lap he was holding his shirt that had gotten damaged; it was soft and fresh, clean and hummed ever-so-softly of magic between his fingertips. Tucked into the breast pocket was a little note. He unfolded it and read the words scribbled onto it;
"Wet-wipes on the bedside table, for one. A towel to clean up with, so that next time you don't have to drag your sore little dick to the bathroom and -maybe something to give a little energy boost, if muggles even have that sort of thing."
Harry shook his head, "You need your rest. I only wanted to make sure you weren't suffering unduly."
"You can't possibly understand what it means to say that!" Harry hissed.
The stairs creaked underfoot as he mounted them one at a time, his body feeling heavier and heavier as he drew closer to the landing at the top outside their apartment door. He slid his key out of his waistcoat pocket and slipped it into the lock. The sound grated against his eardrums and he winced. Forcing his weight on the door he was admitted into the room and couldn't help but feel surprised at the sight that greeted him beyond the threshold. "What's all this?" he croaked tiredly as he dropped his briefcase down behind the front door, a few empty phials clinking together gently, before removing his travelling cloak and hanging it up on the carved oak coat-stand in the corner of the entrance.
Their dog trotted back over, his favourite book clamped between its teeth. He felt his lips tug into a semblance of a smile before removing the tattered book from the dog's mouth, ruffling it behind the ears as he did so. Its collar jingled at the action; the golden nametag flashed the named 'Seeker' into his eyes. He smiled. Everyone thought that Seeker was named due to his and Harry's love for Quidditch -that had in fact not been the case. They had indeed spent weeks trying to pick a name that didn't sound outrageous or horrible -or horribly outrageous. They had taken two weeks of calling the pup a variety of names, most of which it did not even answer to. The way they had gotten the name for their puppy was indeed a strange story, but not many people believed him when he insisted that was the true story behind the name. Many thought it was due to a sex-game or another ludicrous tale like that.
you brewed it properly, Blaise?" she sneered, cocking a dark eyebrow.
Draco watched from his armchair an hour later wrapped in a simple thin dressing down, a fresh nightshirt and a pair of slippers on his feet. He was eating a light dinner of fruit, dry seeded bread and cold cuts of meat and a bowl of soup. It wasn't a lot but he felt if he'd tried anything more he'd have been sick in the bathtub. Harry didn't mind the simple meal. It was good that he didn't because he had been scribbling in his journal for the past hour whilst explaining to Draco as simply as possible what he planned to achieve, and sometimes curing a fever may be the easiest way to go but it was also a good 'ice breaker' in some successful journals that he had read over the last few weeks. It was interesting and he had a good time watching how Harry's eyes sparkled.
Draco didn't seem too concerned as he leaned even more over the edge to grasp out at the willow branches, their slender vines of green leaves running through his fingers. Harry had held some hope that Draco would be paying attention to where they were drifting. When they eventually bumped into a large rock protruding through the water and the boat jostled heavily to one side, he whipped around to yell at Draco just in time to see his long legs disappearing over the edge and into the lake. Harry froze, his knuckles turning white as he grasped the oars. It couldn't be that deep surely? Draco could swim, couldn't he? How had those questions never come up before between them? No, he was positive that Draco could swim. This wasn't his first time at the Lake District after all. True to his memory, Draco's blonde head exploded from the frothing water at last, his mouth open in a silent scream for air, his arms flaring up over his head. Harry watched as still as a statue, his skin turning as cold as marble as he watched Draco struggling to keep his head above water, the thrashing in the water making the boat rock haphazardly and the water becoming more and more agitated as it sucked Draco back under, drowning out his choking screams for Harry to help him.
' chided the voice at the back of his head. He sneered at it to shut up but over-all he couldn't deny the jibe. He clenched his fingers into fists, ground his teeth together and then stood with a renewed resolve to head down to breakfast.
Draco smiled, leaning over to rest his head on the pillow beside Harry's shoulder. "Well we both needed a break -and you looked so happy chasing around after Seeker."
Pansy huffed but gathered the knife and chopping board and jar of peppermint leaves over onto another desk so as to start her tedious task. She tried not to let it bother her as she chopped the leaves into fine shavings and piled them on the other end of the chopping board. She didn't have any qualms about what they were doing. It was all in jest and they would only be brewing a mild one, regardless, so after Draco's initial embarrassment had simmered down and he'd confessed his 'undying love' for Potter, then perhaps the hostility between the houses would gradually dissipate.
"I want to help you get better," Harry stated simply at though it was the most obvious thing in the world. Draco frowned but managed to rip open his nightshirt and splay it on either side of his ribcage. He watched through hooded eyes as Harry cast the spells required and frowned at the darkened areas were the most pain was coming from. He dismissed the charm and then drew out his personal journal and noted it down. "For now, I want to try and get your fever down alright? Then I can start tackling whatever is wrong with your chest, how does that sound?"
"Of course I shall. Now go off and get as much work as you can do before tomorrow evening, alright?"
The hairs on his neck stood up.
Draco couldn't mask his surprise. Something they hadn't done before? That was a reasonably short list. Considering how Harry had never been with a guy before he'd gotten with Draco -once the initial soreness had passed -he'd turned into a starved dog, begging for his bone. "And what, pray tell, is that?" he purred, leaning down to brush his lips down Harry's neck.
He had managed the other small things on his own. The sandwiches had been easy and since it was for a descendant of 'the Noble house of Black', Kreacher had been more than happy to order the other house-elves around, not that they would have objected anyway. He was almost glad that Ron and Hermione had gone away that morning, so that they didn't see the stupid grin that spread over his face.
Harry hummed softly before responding, "It could very well help him if he was instructed on how the body has been designed to work and some possibilities of his condition as well as how the medicine would indeed cure him or at the very least aim to make his life more bearable."
"No, I'm serious," Draco reasoned, his calm expression unwavering, "At least it'd be a funny story to tell Teddy some day."
. Especially Ginny. She loved to rehash that saying almost every heated discussion they had with one another these days. He hated it when they said that. They would never know how he felt, what dying felt like, how he'd died long before those slit-red eyes had landed on him. But Draco hadn't said any of those things, he'd simply understood out of context what it had been like for him.
With a hesitant hand, Harry reached out for it. "Alright, I'll make sure he takes it." He slipped the phial into his pocket, a chill running down his spine that he reasoned was from the cold air outside the double doors.
gross, sloppy, messy sex?"
His friends tried to help him prep for the task but there was no real way of knowing what would happen in the large maze that was currently growing on the Quidditch Pitch.
During the next couple of months as Harry tried and failed to first discover how to deal with the egg and secondly how to solve the riddle the egg had sung to him in the prefects bath, his battle of cheesy chat-up lines with Malfoy had reached new levels.
As soon as they'd been allowed to go about their own way in the summer house, Harry had offered to take his trunk upstairs along with Draco's and instead of leaving after he'd finished, he pulled a chair out onto the small balcony that overlooked one shore of the lake and slumped down into it. The sun burned his eyes and his skin and the buzzing of the insects magnified in his ears and everything seemed to warp in his vision. He pressed the heels of his hands against his temples and squeezed his eyes shut tightly until all he could hear was the rush of his own blood.
Draco cleared his throat but made no move to sit down. The glares from the surrounding tables were burning a hole through the back of his skull, but he couldn't back down. Not now. They had a friendship -a very intense friendship -and he was allowed to talk to Harry whenever he damn well pleased. "I was wondering that, if you were finished, you might join me for a walk around the lake."
One Wish
"I'm not -gonna come -like
Harry didn't want to leave. He wanted to stay and be with the man he loved but he knew he couldn't. Draco would throw him out if he didn't leave, he could see it in his steely grey eyes. Feeling a weight pushing down in his chest, he reached over for the sealed envelope and pushed it down into his pocket before sparing one last longing look at the blonde man in the bed, before he brushed past the curtain and disappeared from the ward.
"He also helped spare our lives," Hermione snapped out, "That should count for something!" without another word she stood up from the table and threw her book into her bag before slinging it over her shoulder and storming past Ron, who was coming in late from his lesson, and out of the Great Hall. Harry ushered Ginny to sit back down as he clambered out of his own seat.
"Draco-o-o! Tell me!"
"I'm not going to do any of that if that's what you're after," the brunette growled darkly, a horrid shadow passing over his face.
Draco's eyes narrowed on him, his arms folded across his chest seemed to tighten a fraction. "You'd better have a damn sight more to say to me than 'hi', Potter," he sneered out weakly, the bags under his eyes darkening as he narrowed them even further.
Pansy frowned as she idly flickered through her textbook, turning the pages slowly so as to appear not too eager. She finally settled on the appropriate page and her eyebrows shot up before she gave a smirk over to Blaise. The name of the potion on that page was Amortentia otherwise known as 'The Love Potion'. She was mildly impressed as she skipped the introduction -no one ever read those anyway -and started looking through the basics of the potion. According to the text it would take at least three weeks for the potion to brew properly. It seemed quite extensive for such a simple potion but there was no denying that the Harry definitely had a crush on their blonde friend -as obvious as the four-eyed kid was -and there was no denying that at least SOME of those feelings were reciprocated.
With a small smirk on his lips, the greasy haired man stood up from his armchair and made towards the door of the drawing room. When he got to it, however, he turned back to fasten the young blonde with a fierce glare, "And Draco, when I said everything you haven't done, or felt, I do mean everything." At the blank expression on his face he hitched a dark eyebrow and said it a little more plainly, "I know."
"May I see them?" the brunette asked tentatively, not wanting to cross any lines with Draco and his possessions. He didn't want to upset him.
Harry stared after him wondering what sort of mess he'd gotten himself into. Literally.
As Draco busied himself filling both the water bottles with the scorching water, he coughed loudly to get Harry's attention, "Harry, come on, love it's time to wake up alright?" he called softly not wanting to aggravate his lover. In the mirror he watched Harry frown and roll onto his side with a small groan. Draco sighed as he fastened the cork into the second hot water bottle and brought them over to the bed. Being careful not to disturb Harry too much, he placed both bottles under the duvet cover at the bottom of the bed, so as to keep their feet warm. Harry was still sleeping stiffly on his side, so he removed the towel from the radiator where it had been warming whilst they were out and spread it out over his fianc√©s body.
Harry pouted, "True."
The room stank of sex and latex.
"So?" Harry asked, his voice a deep husky whisper. Draco fought the urge the shiver. He turned on his heel and cocked a sleek blonde eyebrow at his lover.
Perhaps he needed to do something about it.
He looked like a distressed child and Draco actually felt somewhat sorry for him once his humour had died down a little. He leaned over and touched a hand to his companions shoulder, "Come on then, let's just go out into the gardens. We can bring some of your journals as well and sit underneath one of the blossom trees by the pond."
The dot labelled 'DRACO MALFOY' had been pacing back and forth across the dorm for a while, as the other Slytherin's slept peacefully, it would seem, but Draco's dot had appeared rather restless that evening.
She'd struck a nerd. She knew she had in the way his high cheekbones flared a pink colour. His jaw tensed and he avoided his gaze, "N-No, I just want to know if that's a good idea or not. I want to spend more time with him, it just so happens that this weekend is also Valentines day. No big deal, really."
"There. This isn't charity, before you complain."
Suffice to say, since Ron was too busy scowling at Harry from down the other end of the table, it gave Hermione an open window to ask Harry what was actually going on. Harry had blinked innocently at the question but knew he couldn't feign ignorance. Most of the school were spreading the rumors so it was clear he'd have heard
Harry wasn't asleep but rather, he was reading by the light of an oil-lamp on the bedside table, his body propped up on a small mountain of pillows. When his door clicked open and Draco slipped in as quietly as possible, the younger man lazily drew his eyes away from his reading material to look up at his 'husband'. He frowned heavily, since it was rare that Draco would be the one to sneak out of his bedchamber to his. "Draco? What are you doing up so late? I thought you were already asleep."
Draco rolled his silver eyes before downing the tonic and shuddering, "Nasty stuff." He winced after a moment and then his eyes shone a little brighter as he reached for his own butterbeer, "So what else do we have planned for today?" he asked, cocking a blonde eyebrow. For the rest of the day he couldn't help but look at Draco in a slightly brighter light. The stirrings in his chest and stomach gave himself away. He knew his feelings were more than just friendly. He knew that and had done since just after the Christmas holidays but he hadn't wanted himself to believe it. He had never gotten those feeling before, not with Cho or with Ginny. With Cho he had always been scared that she'd cry all down his front or snap at him for no reason. With Ginny it had been different but still felt weird, like she was a sibling. It had felt different but not in a good way.
Draco smirked down at him, "We haven't done that in years, Harry. Do you suddenly feel the urge to rub up against me all night long?" he purred silkily as he leaned over Harry and pressed their mouths together. "I do love you, you know?" he murmured gently.
,' he frowned wondering what on earth that was supposed to mean when the words faded and he gave a rueful little smile as he watched new words reappear, '
He couldn't deny it was nice having some people watching out for him, now that he no longer sparked fear in his fellow pupils.
Harry peeked up at the blonde through his thick fringe that hadn't been styled that morning, the flush still tinting his cheeks, and let himself smile a little. "Alright then, get some comfortable shoes on and then we can go down to these blossoms of yours."
Harry blinked, startled. "You do?"
"I didn't mean to cause you and your family such unwarranted distress," Harry gushed, feeling a cold dread sink into his stomach like a heavy weight.
He still remembered when their business was first up and running and he manned the counter whilst Harry checked on brewing potions in the back room. That had been when Draco was learning how to run the shop on his own, for the most part, and learning about the 'tricks of the trade' as Harry had called it. He was glad that the brunette had talked him into starting a business. They'd had so much fun behind the counter as they'd boxed up small packages of pepper-up for a worrying mother to send to her son in boarding school, or explained to an elderly gentleman how to apply the salve that would ease up the rheumatism in his legs when it got wet. He had been so bored beforehand, always in the manor and shuffling from room to room as though he were a ghost already, instead of a living breathing being. Harry had changed his life quite literally for the better. It had been thrilling too, the minute risks they came to take in their day-to-day life; Draco would be behind the counter, describing a new scented powder that would clear up baby's rash ‚Äìsomething that had taken Harry months to perfect properly ‚Äìwhen Harry would come up behind him, an arm loaded with wares and his hand would graze against Draco's arse through his trousers, making the blonde gasp and force out a cough to cover the fact that he was blushing profusely. He had gotten his own petty revenge when Harry had asked him for some help unloading a stack of crates in his arms. As he had leaned over and snatched one of the crates, he leaned over as though murmuring in Harry's ear when really; he'd teased the brunette's earlobe with his teeth before pressing a chaste kiss to his cheeks. Harry had blushed unbearably and disappeared from the shop floor for half an hour. Thankfully no one caught onto it.
"Come here, you, you need your sleep," he stated as he wriggled down the mattress, embracing Harry against his chest as he whispered 'nox' to the light.
"Did you decide on what would become of the manor?" Harry asked as he hung his drenched cloak on the coat rack and cast a drying spell on it.
"Holy fuck!" he gasped out as he rolled over onto his front, coughing and choking as he tried to get up onto his knees, "You could have warned me!"
Harry nodded his head, "Yes sir, I think I would like that very much."
Harry smiled and pressed a kiss to Draco's forehead, "I've got nothing on you, Draco."
Draco smirked down at him and slowly kissed him, their tongues slipping together fiery and wet, sending pleasure running straight to Harry's cock as he thrust up. Leaning away, Draco pressed a kiss to the lightning bolt scar before leaning away and running his tongue down the muscled ridges and scars of Harry's torso before taking the thick cock in his mouth, right down to the hilt and making Harry jerk with a gasp. He sucked Harry down over and over again, breathing through his nose, before releasing him and sucking on his fingers. As he knelt down, almost out of sight, and ran his tongue over Harry's balls, he circled his finger around the tight puckered entrance of the brunette man.
Harry smirked and tugged the trousers down. Draco was longer than he was, but he wasn't as thick. Not that he minded as he ran his tongue over the twitching member. Draco shuddered and sucked in a breath through his teeth. He groaned as Harry lightly grazed his teeth along the length, before sucking energetically at the swollen head. He moaned around Draco's cock as he felt the pale fingers clutching tightly in his hair, urging him so take the cock deeper. He stroked Draco from his base before releasing him with a wet 'pop'.
He gave a stiff shrug. Hermione sighed irritably, debating on whether to return the following day or not. She was getting to her maximum tolerance level with Draco. She was about to step into the emerald flames when his hoarse whisper caught her attention, "Perhaps I'll write."
"I love you!"
. It should have been
"Now Harry," the younger man peeled his eyelids open and turned his head to the left to look at Severus full, "I have thought over everything that has happened and after much discussion between myself and Lucius and Narcissa, we have come to the agreement that it would be wise for you and Draco to not live with one another for a while." Harry blinked in surprised and then frowned weakly, not having the energy to argue but wishing that he did. "We have decided that for the next six months you are going to live here, with me."
The wheels creaked and the coach jerked and then pulled to a stop. Opening his eyes with a soft sigh, Draco struggled out of the coach, paid the driver and then turned his attention to the darkened windows of the apothecary and the apartment over the top. After everything, he simply couldn't let the place go; all the memories good and bad were locked up in there. Plus, he'd gotten used to working about in the shop. Slughorn hadn't minded moving out, he'd found a better place a little closer to the hospital with more room for all of his belongings that had been in storage until he moved.
He felt the wind explode in his lungs and saw stars swim about in his blurred vision as he tried to kick up away from the tangle of weeds without much success. Bubbles drifted from his nostrils and through a gap in his lips. He kicked his legs as much as he could but it was difficult seeing as Draco's dead weight in his arms was threatening to drag them back down to the murky grey depths and the tangle of black-green weeds tickling at their heels, as well as their soaked clothes clinging to them.
When he looked over at Harry he saw that the younger man and bowed his head and was blushing in embarrassment. "That honestly didn't cross my mind at all. Goodness, I feel such a fool!" he huffed and tossed his quill to the desk and slumped back.
"Harry love, are you hungry?"
Harry thought about it and hummed gently before smiling and taking a sip of his drink. "So we're friends now, are we?"
However, none of them discussed their nightly wanderings to the Weasley-girl. Her sheer distaste for anything Slytherin didn't help matters, but whenever she was near Harry she would try to draw him into a conversation that would ultimately revolve around her. It was frustrating for Draco to watch but he didn't comment on it, not outright anyway. He just didn't want to seem bitter towards Harry. He valued the budding friendship far too much to outright badmouth his existing friends, no matter how annoying they were.
's face in his hands and pressed their mouths together in a slow, burning kiss.
Harry gave a small nod, "yeah alright. I have a headache from Hermione's rant anyway."
"So you want to avoid it?"
"Do you accept this ring, Harry?" he breathed as he hugged the brunette man on top of him around the waist.
Peering up, Draco felt himself throb. Harry was flushed bright red, drenched in sweat and glowing. Rolling onto his back, a rush of cool air swept down Draco's damp body. He shivered and breathed in deeply.
Harry smiled, leaning into the touch, before tiptoeing up and stealing another chaste kiss, "Okay, I guess I can wait."
Harry groaned and shook his head back and forth. "No, there is no calming down!" he snapped. Even though he ached and burned with a fiery rage, he felt his body weaken at Draco's firm assuring touch. Draco was cool, calm and real. He grounded him and it felt refreshing to have something solid to focus on after the months of dark nights where he slept alone, the fear of never waking up rolling through his skull like thunderous clouds.
what it was like he'd simply
The letter had cut off there abruptly; a few ink splotches and clear smudged areas where tears had dripped into the writing made it difficult to discern if there had been another page or it Harry had merely shoved it in an envelope in his self-crazed stupor before letting the coachman post it for him. Up until that point that autumn, Draco had been refusing to reply to Harry, mostly because Severus had insisted that until Harry was better again he couldn't speak to Draco in any way. Although, Draco had wondered how Harry was supposed to recover with only one person to talk to on a daily basis. He had written to Severus and discussed things at great length with him the following week when the older man had come to visit, of course he didn't divulge that Harry had written to him, he had merely stated his curiosity and subtly brought up possibly starting a correspondence. Severus had insisted that he would consider it but since Christmas and the lonely affair it had been even with the Ministry function hosted by the Lake District at Severus' house, he insisted that Harry's mental breakthrough was a long way off yet and that any means of trying to talk to him would be futile.
The gold band that he'd given to his husband.
By the time he woke up the following morning he truly did feel rested for the first time in a very long time. Whatever Harry done had literally been nothing short of a miracle. His muscles still felt a little weak still but his belly had been filled and his mind had been put to rest for ten hours straight! He turned against the basic cotton linen ‚Äìreally, he hadn't know they'd owned anything less fine than satin ‚Äìand started slightly when he caught sight of Harry sitting in the armchair at the head of his bed with his journal in his lap and a quill poised in his hand. "How long have you been awake?" he rasped his voice still dusty from having not used it except to yell at the staff.
Draco and Pansy's head jerked up at his question. "Why would I do that?" he asked after a moment of silence, "He's sitting at the Gryffindor table."
Harry froze as he leaned over his lover, "Happy?" he repeated, as though not believing the emotion that had so eluded him for the majority of his life, "What do you mean happy?"
Seven days.
He listened with half an ear to whatever Pansy was currently bitching about, and whatever Blaise was sneering about concerning the Ravenclaws he'd had in his charms class that morning. He wasn't really paying too much attention, lost in his own thoughts about what could be done over the Valentines weekend in regards to distracting Harry from the love-lorn fans that would no doubt be following him around like starved puppies, and didn't noticed the knowing look Pansy shot Blaise across the table.
That night, despite not getting to ask answer any of the questions fired their way, Harry and Draco stumbled into the Room of Requirement, their hands hot and heavy as they groped one another and scrambling to pluck the others clothes off. They were locked at the mouth, their kisses bruising, hot and damp as they breathed each other in, nipping and biting at one another. Harry pressed Draco up against the wall and started sucking at his throat, the skin soft and smooth between his teeth as he rubbed the older man through his trousers. He was hard and throbbing in the brunette's palm as he rubbed him. "Say it again," Harry demanded in a low husky voice that made Draco moan and thrust up into his palm. Before dinner the blonde had tugged him aside and confessed his feelings and Harry was going crazy with those words running in his head. He felt like he was caught in a dream. It couldn't be true, but it was, and he was relishing in the moment!
And so that was how Harry found himself outside Malfoy Manor the following morning.
He had expressly told her that no one in the Malfoy bloodline had ever owned a pet other than an owl, or perhaps on a few occasions ‚Äìa snake. Hermione had scowled at him, telling him that Harry had had enough of snakes to last him more than three life-times if not more. However, at the mention of the past and, later Hogwarts, Hermione had recalled Harry's godfather Sirius Black whose animagus form was a dog. Hence, her exclamation that they should adopt a puppy.
Draco nodded his head, a little too eagerly. "I'll meet you there," he promised. There was a tense little moment, that ached inside both boys, that could have been easily broken with a gentle kiss. But with a curt nod from the blonde, the moment shattered around them, and they both resigned themselves to going back to their separate dorms.
Seven days they had been waiting for Draco to make an absolute fool of himself, and nothing had happened yet. By the third day even Blaise had to reach for his textbook and flip through the pages to the potion to make sure that he had in fact brewed it correctly. He read the instructions several times before frowning heavily, and reading through the footnotes and additional study sections just to see just what he could've possibly done wrong.
Harry nodded his head, inwardly glad that Draco didn't want to get rid of him just then. For the rest of the morning they talked about their families and friends, political standings and how they liked their universities where they had studied. Draco had stated that he was inclined to take over the family business from his father. He said he didn't mind it but sometimes he needed something to distract him and take his mind off of things. Harry had even spent a little bit of time telling Draco about the English countryside and the blonde man had said that he wished he could take some time to go and see it. Harry had wanted to comment that the blonde seemed to have nothing but time on his hands but decided to hold his tongue, not wanting to annoy the blonde any further. In the end he promised to simply meet the blonde later that evening at the function in the hotel.
"That is awfully gracious of you, Lord Malfoy. I just don't understand where this generosity is coming from. You're known to most of France as being somewhat of a ‚Ä¶ a ‚Ä¶" he trailed off not wanting to sound as though he were insulting the Lord.
He clenched his jaw tightly, his eyes burning around the edges as he raised a hand to caress the feather soft fur of their retriever. He could remember the day they had decided to get a dog ‚Äìor more precisely a puppy. It had been around the time when all of their friends were pairing off and started talking about families and growing-up and how adorable a baby would be. In his opinion, about one out of four of their friends babies were even remotely cute, despite the snot dribbling down from their flaring nostrils, their red cheeks as they screamed and wailed for attention, the horrible stench when they crapped their nappies.
He glanced at his watch. 9:02am. Harry had only been able to sleep another few fitful hours in a sickly sweat, whilst Draco had been able to do anything other than cradle his lover and croon softly to him. When Harry had awoken again, he found Draco perched upon the bed with a mug full of chicken noodle soup in his hands. It seemed to have worked and stayed down as Harry had no thrown it up at all. He had not even heaved.
He wanted his fingers to breach the surface.
Now that the radiator was free, he brought out a pair of winter pyjamas that he had brought with him in case of an emergency, and draped them over the device. As they were warming, he went back t put more water in the kettle for some hot chocolate. As the drinks boiled, Draco got himself changed into his own pair of warm pyjamas.
"Like?"
. So what if that makes a few things easier do a degree? Does that lessen the importance of it?"
He didn't even mind that he was paired with Potter for potions that morning. It had an odd sense of familiarity to it. He was grateful that Potter didn't try any small talk and didn't go out of his way to be sarcastic of snap whenever Potter did something wrong -which was only two times in the space of an hour. A new record, really. They still managed to tie with Granger and some seventh year named Buckley for the highest grade in the class. It should have made him happy, but the dementors that danced in the shadows sucked out the emotion before it could fully warm his heart. Instead, he nodded his head when Slughorn told them their grade, and was silently waiting for the bell to sound out for the end of the morning lessons.
Draco rubbed Potter's length, rubbing the sweet spot under his head and making him grunt and pant in the chair. He groaned as he felt himself harden a little as he nipped at Potter's ear, "Together we could really make the 'Shrieking Shack' worthy of its name."
Draco rolled his eyes before flipping the switch and continuing to dry his hair.
Blaise turned back around to his blonde friend, "Why don't you just go over there and talk to him?" he asked as though it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Harry was panting heavily, his mouth contorted into a half-grin as he wiped a hand across his sweaty forehead. He inhaled a few times through his nose, to calm his breathing. Draco shuffled over on the mattress and draped an arm over the top of Harry's chest, as far from the drying cum as possible, his neck buried into the sweaty, hot skin of his lover's neck. "Merlin, Harry you always take my breath away," he purred silkily and pressed his lips against Harry's pulse-point. He smirked as a shiver ran down the younger mans' body.
Harry cocked the skin where his eyebrow used to be, "this weekend? The one coming?"
"Ha-Ha-Ha-rry!" he moaned loudly, biting the edge of the mattress as their bodies rocked together.
Severus inclined his head, "I can only watch so many people suffer in silence before my conscience creeps back in, Draco. Besides, you and Harry are two of the closest things I've ever had to sons. I want you both to feel like, if something has happened, you can at least turn to me for advice. I've had forty-five years in training for it."
He really did have beautiful eyes, not that Harry was looking too much over at the blonde, trying to suppress his own embarrassed smile.
"Yes we can," Draco intoned in a gentle voice as he inclined his head and motioned for Harry to join him over to the fireplace where a bottle of butterbeer stood on the mantle. He took it down and with shaking hands, poured them each a goblet and handed one to Harry. "We can share the first Christmas of us being ... friends," he breathed gently, his eyes averting from Harry's.
He wanted to go and see his companion? Lover? Whatever he was, Draco wanted to see him and make sure he was alright. He huffed at the irony.
Draco shook his head, "You didn't," he murmured and winced as Harry shifted to try and move away. Draco reached out and snatched the brunette's man's wrist, drawing him lower down towards him, "You don't need to go anywhere. You can sit here if you want."
Draco frowned, "What port-key?"
The night before the trial the Great Hall was buzzing with excitement as everyone else dug into their meal. Potter wasn't eating and Draco had only managed to force down a couple of bites. Watching from his seat at the Slytherin table he watched Potter look up at him and jerk his head slightly in the direction of the doors. Draco have a stiff nod and watched as Potter stood up, made his excuses to his friends and ducked out of the hall.
Draco frowned, "what do you mean?"
"Unhhnnnngggg ..." was all Draco could manage.
What was happening?
"Yes love?"
Harry shook his head, "No, that wasn't the plan. Not really. The plan was ... I needed to die."
"It's a mild variation of a cleansing potions; it's going to cleanse out any bacteria you might have in your lungs. It takes about three hours to complete its cycle and once it's done I can determine if it is a virus that's affecting you or something worse."
Draco looked like he wanted to snap an answer, but whatever retort it was he swallowed it and delivered a much calmer response, "For now. Let's just see how things go and maybe, in a few months, we can try talking again."
"Nnnnnngggah Harry you dirty tease!"
Seeker was the happiest he had seen him in months as he nudged the door open with his foot and helped Harry hobble into the apartment, a weak, strained smile on his lips. The walk home had been pleasant, the smell of damp earth hung in the air but the usual chill after a storm had not been present. Harry bent slightly so as to stroke Seeker's ears whilst Draco turned and closed the door, sliding the bolt into place as he did so every night. He turned and smiled as Harry went to seat himself on the sofa, Seeker hopping up on the neighboring cushion to nuzzle his master's face and neck. He smiled as Harry ruffled the flanks of Seeker's sleek golden coat. He smiled. It had been a while since Seeker had jumped about so merrily.
He placed his paper crane on the small pine cabinet beside the bed before easing himself into a chair and taking one of Harry's cold, limp hands in his own. The next twenty-four hours were crucial, the nurse had told him. Sink or Swim. Live or Die. Harry or no Harry. It all seemed too much to understand. He clutched Harry's hand tighter, willing him to wake up even for a few moments. He needed to see the pair of shining green eyes -they would reassure him that Harry was still fighting for life -for him.
There it was again, that bitterness.
To that it had been awkward to begin with would be like telling someone that plants needed both sunlight and water to flourish. They had sat across from one another sharing small smiles and averting their eyes from one another. They were observing one another in each of those little glances, as though trying to assess how mentally stable the other person was before engaging them in conversation. It was almost as though they were perfect strangers to one another. Finally it was Harry who had decided to break the silence, "Would you like to accompany on a walk across Severus' gardens, Draco?" he asked rather formally, a wide smile still on his pink lips, "He's become quite the horticulturist since I was here last summer."
On one of Draco's braver nights he and Harry went walking along the streets of Paris, not bothering with travelling cloaks as the weather was rather balmy to say the least. They had walked along the Seine and then gotten some port at a high-end bar that Lucius often frequented with clients. They had drunk and talked and become a little careless as they wandered back through the darkening streets, almost leaning against one another out of comfort rather than the bubbles fizzing at the back of their throats. Harry had felt somewhat lightheaded and didn't really remember climbing up the marble staircase or even somehow being coherent enough to change out of his clothes and slip into one of Draco's nightshirts that had been too baggy on him but he didn't are because it had smelled wonderful. He did, however, remember waking up bleary-eyed with a pressure humming in his skull in a grand four-poster bed ‚Äìand he wasn't alone. He had wanted to yelp at Draco's arm so carelessly tossed over his naked waist, for the nightshirt had ridden up to his chest during his sleep, but somehow the sound had latched in his throat. He didn't leap out of bed and hurry to his own room. Instead he settled back down and watched Draco as the man slept peacefully beside him, unaware of the flush on Harry's cheeks or the loud hammering of the brunette man's heart against his ribs.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "I promised you could do anything you wanted to me."
Draco raised his hands to clutch tightly to Harry's, "I come whenever I can, you know I do."
Draco's shoulders slumped in a defeated manner, "I'm upset, naturally. He was my father after all and I loved him a great deal."
"What do you mean?" Draco asked as he cocked his head to the side.
They skipped dinner in favor of sitting on the balcony and watching the stars slowly appear in the darkening sky. Draco transfigured a blankets from one of the old textbooks in the astronomy cupboard and spread it out over both of their laps. They were both nestled into the narrow side of the balcony so that they were better able to see the stars and have an excuse to be closer to one another. Not that they really needed one. Harry was a little surprised that no one had come looking for them yet, as far as he knew, but he didn't care. Especially when Draco laced their fingers together between the folds of the blanket and nudged the other's foot gently.
Cass nodded his head as he accepted some money from the muggle, "sure thing, and no worries." As Draco was about to leave Cass caught him through the side-door of the bar that led to the staircase. In his hand he had two red rubbery things and a little blue plastic bag. "For you and Harry, tonight; a hot water bottles and some hot chocolate in a tin. It's meant to get chilly tonight, apparently."
Harry turned with an amused eyebrow raised up at the blonde and raised his flute to sip from it, "Are you telling me that you are not too high up in the eyes of society to look down on little people like me?"
"Anyway, I convinced them both to stay and destroy the other horcruxes. I went down to the forest on my own. Well, I wasn't really alone."
A small part of him had wanted to return to Hogwarts to see as to whether or not the death threats he had been receiving would follow him. He knew they would, but he hoped that the new wards at Hogwarts would prevent that humiliation. He didn't need the whole school hearing the foul language some of those witches and wizards spewed.
"I feel oddly touched," Harry admitted dryly, "That my death would have made you want to die. Almost like you'd want to join me."
"I SAID GET
A few of the letters followed the same pattern, responding to questions and replying with other small facts about how each day varied from the next and generally how Harry had been feeling recently, and the hopeful tone he seemed to adopt whenever he reminisced about the old memories they shared in his letters to Draco. He remembered that he hadn't been too ecstatic about responding right away. He'd wanted to be optimistic and hopeful and reply with the same painstaking enthusiasm as Harry wrote to him, but he couldn't force the merriment out of him. His mind was formed with the dark blue rippling of his mind about that day. He didn't want to think about that specific day but he couldn't help how he felt. There were some days where he did write back with a smile on his face, but as soon as he had sealed the envelope he'd felt his stomach drop into his shoes. He ran a hand down his face and slouched a little in his embroidered chair, something he'd managed to bring with him from the manor. It was his old favourite from his room and he loved to trace a finger over the patterns absent-mindedly. A lot of the letters followed the same pattern. There were a few erratic ones, where Harry had a bad day or got agitated by something that Draco had written to him. Some were simply too frustrated.
"Harry-" she tried in a reasoning tone but he was having none of it, as he fixed her with one of the darkest looks she had ever seen.
Draco chuckled, the vibrations running through Harry's body, making him feel pleasantly comfortable and almost like he was floating. He couldn't believe that despite everything that had happened in recent months, the blonde was being this open with him. Perhaps their late night anger-management sessions had helped a lot to bring them closer together. Perhaps not as close as Harry would have liked, but he couldn't deny that any progress was a good thing at this point. Especially considering where they had been this time last year. He shook his head, not wanting to remember the Battle. The nightmares were bad enough. Draco drew him back to the warmth of reality with another tender kiss on his brow and the weight of his head resting upon his own. "I don't mind, Harry. If you're tired then sleep. I won't stop you."
"Yes sweetheart?"
With a mischievous glint in his eye, Potter jerked Draco's hand away from his dick and sauntered back towards the Gryffindor Tower. It had been a long night.
Draco nodded with a small smile, "I was being incredibly stubborn at not wanting anything more than a basic correspondence, but that morning shifted everything into perspective for me."
Draco let out a deep groan as Harry swallowed him whole, the smooth wetness of his throat making Draco throb.
to get better, Draco. I was so afraid when I saw you on that pier that I ‚ÄìI wanted to be in your place. I wanted to be the one knocking at deaths door. At least then you'd have been able to move on and get a new life. I have nothing without you, Draco."
personally. Harry closed his eyes before turning his head back to the fading sunlight. "There's something that I haven't told anyone about what happened in the forest that night and to be perfectly honest, talking about it out loud means that it's not some sort of dream I had. It makes it all too real. I'm ... I'm not sure I'm ready for that."
He was simply left staring at the space where Harry had been standing. The problem with that was, he had actually seen what Harry meant when he said that he'd died. It was something he lost control over in such an emotional state. He was a skilled Occlumens -he'd had to be, staying in the same house as the Dark Lord -and he'd gotten a very brief flash of what Harry had witnessed upon 'dying'. It hadn't been an image per say, just a flash of whiteness and a platform, but the emptiness and loneliness he'd felt in waves was almost crippling. He'd then been completely overwhelmed with the turmoil he'd felt soaring out of Harry right before the connection between them had been broken.
Without anyone warning, Draco came hard and heavy. He shot his load all over Harry's hand, his stomach and chest, and even a little on the pillow under his head. Harry would have found it funny, if he wasn't too busy falling over the precipice himself; his mind was detached from his body as he spasmed uncontrollably, unloading all of his essence into his lover, his muscles rigid as pulse after pulse of his orgasm rocked through him.
Draco smiled softly as he massaged Harry's other foot. The kettle boiled. "Fancy some hot chocolate?"
However, it didn't take away from the fact that Potter was tense as fuck from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. They hadn't had a jerk-off session since, and Draco silently told himself that it had been spur of the moment and wouldn't happen again. So why did he feel disheartened by it? He had to shake his head at least three times a day to tell himself he didn't give a shit. He'd wear his 'POTTER STINKS' badge with pride until the tournament was over.
Just as she was loading her plate up with food, the doors to the Great Hall banged open. Heads craned over to see what the commotion was about from every table. Within moments the hall erupted with the sound of hushed voices whispering about the spectacle they were beholding. Blaise and most other Slytherin's either had sneers on their faces or their jaws were on the ground and refused to reconnect. Standing, framed in the doorway, stood Harry bloody Potter -bold as brass -with a self-confidence that he hadn't seemed to have in recent years, with a very smug blonde Slytherin standing beside him with a protective arm draped over his shoulders. On most people the pose would have looked clingy, but on those two it seemed to look dignified, proud and classic aristocrat. The protective arm was strong and firm and seemed to act like a shield, deflecting the disapproving looks being sent their way.
"You're too stubborn to ask for it!" Harry snapped back, "That's the whole point!"
Blinking through the blurriness of his own vision, Harry caught sight of Draco sitting by his knees with his hands in his lap and looking into the fire, the light catching in his washed out features and his cried-out eyes. They had both been through a war, two sides of the same coin, and in a way that made them closer than they could be with anyone else. There were things Draco could understand that no one, not even Ginny in her own acclaimed way, could understand. In a way that was a good thing; no one else needed to suffer in the same way they had done.
Later that evening just as everyone was milling into the Great Hall, Draco leaned close to Harry and pressed a hand into his palm as they went their separate ways on the other side of the door. He wanted to talk to him in the Room later on, and simply wanted to spend some time with him. Their evening meet-ups had been few and far between since the start of term had resumed, and he was anxious to spend some proper time with Harry.
It was during the day before Halloween evening when it happened again, only this time is was in Potions class with the Gryffindor's. Once upon a time the lesson would have been trivial to him but it was one of the few rare things he still enjoyed since the war. Unfortunately, most of the eighth year lessons were inter-mixed with the seventh years so that meant he had to spend the double lesson in the morning watching the Weaslette making gooey eyes at Potter. To his credit, he didn't pay any more attention to her than he did to Dean Thomas, so it wasn't too bad. The only thing that would have made it that much more sickening was if Potter was reciprocating said gooey eyes.
"Take me to bed, Draco," Harry growled lustfully. The blonde man didn't need telling twice as Harry was all but thrown onto his bed, the lean muscled blonde pressing down on him, the mattress groaning at their combined weight. Trousers and watch chains and shoes were tossed over onto the floor. As soon as Draco was completely naked he felt the fight ebb out of him as Harry sat before him and panting heavily. Both of their eyes wandered down one another's bodies and they both flushed bright red as they drank in how hard they both were.
When he was finally able to clear his vision he came to the conclusion that everything in the universe -including his feet -hated him. He had unwittingly guided himself to the Girls' bathroom. He crashed through the door and hurried over to the sink and raked his jumper and shirt off over his head before trying to rinse them out under the harsh spray of the cold tap. The tears were flowing freely now and it ate him up inside as his head burned and throbbed from the inside out. He sniffed loudly and gasped for air as he rang his shirt so hard it scrunched up into a tight little ball. He threw it at the sinks with all his force and staggered a little. He looked at the room, the memories, the ghost of his blood running down the drain and the anger swelled inside him.
There was a momentary frown on the blonde's face before he smiled and nodded his head, "Let's see if you can sleep without me, eh, Potter?" and with a cheeky wink, he turned and started on his way down the stairs again.
Pansy snorted, "Well it's not like there is anything that can be done about it, is there?"
Drawing in a deep breath, he poured the contents of the box out onto the empty desk and began sifting through them, organizing them by year, then month and at last official chronological dates. He was almost ashamed to admit that he'd forgotten he'd had the letters stashed away at the Manor. It had been such a long time ago it barely registered in his mind except for the dark days when he was forced to remain in bed with weak broth and hot tea with a cold flannel over his forehead and salve rubbed into his chest every hour. He loathed those days but Severus had taught him how to cope, even in the worst case scenarios. Once all the letters were organized into a neat pile, he cut off a length of twine, bound them together in small bundles and placed them neatly in his leather satchel before levitating yet another empty box into the fireplace. With a sigh he looked around his father's study, a knot forming in his chest and making him wheeze weakly into a handkerchief. He didn't want to leave it, not just yet. He forever counted his blessings that his father hadn't seen him as a waste of time like most other purebloods did to the '
They made raw passionate love for the remainder of that evening, their loud moans echoing out throughout Harry's garret. His legs were pressed up to his chest as Draco thrust into him and made him moan and scream Draco's name in a heavy voice he didn't know he could make. Harry was so sweaty and sore that by the end of it he doubt he would walk for the remainder of the weekend, a difficult feat in itself considering he needed to move his belongings into his larger room a couple of floors up. As soon as Draco had exhausted the both of them, he made short work of stripping the soiled sheets out from underneath Harry, and spreading a thick blanket underneath despite his weakening legs and Harry's obvious discomfort at being moved. Once the bed and been sorted, the blinds shut and a small array of stub candles were lit and dotted around on Harry's desk, windowsill and the bedside tables, Draco went back to lay himself down beside Harry, curling himself around the brunette's back and draping an arm over his waist.
They were the letters from Harry from all those years ago.
And then ... nothing. Frowning, he turned around, his back against the table he saw Harry perched in his chair slowly rubbing his cock that was still glistening with Draco's saliva. Biting his lip, Draco dragged the chair forward slightly, braced his arms back against the table before easing himself onto Harry's lap, his lover's hot throbbing member seeking entrance.
Harry shrugged awkwardly, "Well sure but now I know I'll miss out on something if I don't ... come out of it."
"Right," she nodded knowingly, before shrugging, "Well I suppose you could do. It's up to you to deal with the back-lash if there is any."
Smirking, Harry nipped his neck before moving his hand down to grab Draco's swollen member and start stroking him in time with his thrusts.
Looking back on it all now he should have realised that the young, clean-cut gentleman was in fact Harry. He really should have known what to expect, but even as he heard the deep-throated, beautiful laugh from his memories it had been too unfamiliar a sound for him to pinpoint it. When Severus had looked up and welcomed them from their nap, the young man had turned around in his seat. The way his face had split open into such a breath-taking smile still sent shivers running down through Draco's stomach. He felt as though the wind had been knocked out of him as he stared down at the brunette man with a new haircut, freshly shaven and smartly dressed in a crisp summer shirt and a delicately embroidered waistcoat.
Hermione narrowed her eyes even further, "no, he needs to be in the hands of a professional who know what they are dealing with!"
Harry looked down into Draco's warm grey eyes and for a while neither of them said anything, nor did Draco loosen his grip on Harry's wrist. It was only when the door was nudged open and a young maid teetered in did they break contact with one another.
Harry it down on his lip as he shifted himself between Draco's thighs and positioned his head against the blonde's stretched entrance, "Are you sure?" he asked one final time. As Draco's firm not, he slowly breached his lover's body, gasping as the ring of muscle tightened around him and waited for the blonde man to adjust. Soon Draco was shifting around him and thrusting ever so slightly, silently pleading for Harry to fill him up more and more until he could no longer stand it. Harry complied as slowly as he could without exploding inside his lover and before he knew it he was sheathed up to the hilt in Draco's delicious, sweating body.
? He drew in long shuddering breaths and tried to calm himself, despite the flushing of his body and the way his hands became clammy. He reached up and stroked his hand over Draco's own and inhaled the soft scent of the blonde man's skin. "I'm sorry about what was said in those letters. I know they were a long time ago and we were going the roughest patch known to all of wizarding kind, but ‚ÄìI still feel bad about how some of those things you said affected me."
Draco blinked through his staring state and righted himself in his chair, "Not at all. I actually found it quite interesting. You have a talent for speaking out, Mister Potter. But I do tire from listening to all this medical jargon. Would you like to discuss something else? I'd be most obliged if you do."
lying there lifeless. At least then he wouldn't have anyone mourning his body. Why did Draco have to die? Why did it have to be
With a roll of his eyes, Draco dropped his head back on the pillow, slowly spreading his legs to give Harry easier access. The first finger was a tight fit and made him flushed and uncomfortable. Although, Harry devouring his dick as he did so was more than distracting enough. Reaching out, Draco raised his hips and tangled his fingers in the soft black hair. He slid his knees up over Harry's shoulders to make everything easier.
He didn't know how long he was disorientated and bedridden but he remembered vague flashes of Severus diagnosing him as he drifted in and out of unconsciousness, and Narcissa murmuring beside him that she knew it wasn't his fault but they shouldn't have gone on the boat right with Draco's condition. They were both being stupid boys. By the time he finally revived enough to glance around his bedchamber and scrutinize the dark-haired man soaking a washcloth and laying it over his forehead, he felt weak and sweaty and his eyeballs hurt as they rotated in their sockets. His throat was parched when he tried to speak and wasn't too much better once Severus had given him some water. "How are you feeling?" Severus asked in his usual monotonous drawl. Harry forced his shoulders to shrug awkwardly against his ears, the muscles feeling heavy and weaker than he remember them. Out of the corner of his eye he watched Severus nod his head and then pull a book into his lap and began reading. Within the hour, Harry finally blinked up at the ceiling and felt that his head was substantially clear for the first time in what seemed like forever.
Draco curled his sweating fingers into fists and felt his legs jittering under his tense arms as he tried to find the words to thank his godfather for his intervention. He honestly had been feeling so lost recently that he was glad that he had someone to talk to, even if it was his godfather and he felt like a petulant child getting a telling off for something that wasn't his fault. But, he reasoned, he was a grown man and he would approach the issue as a grown man should. "Thank you Severus," he finally managed to get out in a stronger voice, much stronger than how he felt physically. "I've needed someone to talk and I think I can say without a shadow of a doubt, that you've come in at the perfect time."
Draco didn't know what to say, so he stayed quiet.
And that though frightened him almost more than the thought of losing Draco did.
Harry shrugged, "either -I think I'm too tired to pay attention at the moment anyway."
He just hoped that Harry wouldn't go on any of those stupid dates on Valentines Day. He was planning to ask the bespectacled boy later on that evening if he wanted to go to Hogsmeade for the Saturday afternoon. It would be over-run by couples, but Draco just hoped that that meant that hardly anyone would pay them a second glance. It wasn't a secret that they were friends, but people still held grudges.
It wasn't until a month later that Harry Potter had had just about enough of ignoring the niggling feeling at the back of his mind. He kept his eye on Draco Malfoy, a mild obsession Hermione had called it, and couldn't deny that something was going on. He couldn't deny that it would irrational of him to think that the pale blonde would be up to anything sinister, especially with how pathetically rough he'd been looking lately, but that didn't mean that nothing was going on. Admittedly, he had done pretty well; he hadn't been sneaking glances at the blonde too often, in class or in the corridors, and he hadn't been up during the night watching the marauders map to see if the Slytherin slunk off anywhere in the middle of the night. Especially as the few times he had done that, Draco literally didn't move from within the Slytherin boy dorms.
He dragged the blonde backwards into their bedroom and kicked the door shut behind them. Feeling a new rush of adrenaline surge through him, he forced the blonde man down onto the edge of the bed and straightened up between his long, lean legs. He kept his eyes locked on Draco's and started to work the buttons of his shirt open and let it slip down around his arms and fell to the floor. Draco watched hungry and swallowing thickly as he looked up at Harry's slightly more defined body. Exercise had been something to distract Harry from having nothing to do all day whilst he was at Severus' house. Ever since those six months had ended, he still kept up the routine, insisting that it kept his worries at ease and would let him think a little clearer. Draco didn't mind, it meant he had something firm to lean down on when he pounded into Harry's tight tanned body all night long. He had spent many a long night thrusting into Harry as he forced the younger man down over the length of their breakfast table, slipping in and out with his tight heat with ease. His cock twitched at the visage before him and he wanted to reach out and touch his lover. He looked so handsome ‚Äìalmost Adonis-like ‚Äìas he stood in the glow of the flickering candles. He watched as the dark, damp trousers were unfastened the pushed down to reveal caramel thighs and firm muscles that made Draco's stomach knot.
