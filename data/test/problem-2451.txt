He knew where Vince, Fred and Snape had died; the first two in front of him and the third was publicised enough afterwards to mark it as the death of a hero. That left the werewolf and his cousin. He just had to hope that none of them overlapped. So, straight into babysitting duty then make sure they were back in the room in time to almost bake to death, then face giant snake. He choked down his fear and nodded. Sounded like a fun day.
So, he escaped the quiet of the castle to hide in his ashy room, with thoughts of Ginny still spinning through his head and a letter from her crunched in his hand.
He let out a shaky breath, leaning back against the stone wall, letting the cold of it calm him. The first time they’d just lingered outside the Room of Lost things, waiting for Harry to come out and go back in. This time they had a job to do first and still had to make it back in time.
Even without the dreams, Malfoy’s was the face he saw whenever he closed his eyes. His silver eyes locked on Harry’s when the fire reached him. He just kept staring; Harry couldn’t read whatever had been emotion had been in them. How was he ever meant to forget that?
‘-Harry.’
‘Maybe it’s not the worst.’ He conceded.
‘No, I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.’
‘Huh?’ Harry looked around the room, as though it held the answers, Draco just sighed as though he was dealing with a child.
‘So, Harry, you sure you don’t want to come home with us for Christmas? Gin would love to have you there. Give you a good chance to
Potter smiled, not his amused grin, but a legitimate smile. Wasn’t that something. Draco’s lips twitched, like they wanted to respond alike. He wouldn’t. He didn’t. He almost did though and that was enough.
He heard the thump of something falling through the hole in the side of the building. It sounded suspiciously like a body but he couldn’t stomach that thought. Curses began flying over their heads and Draco ducked as he kept moving. He had to get out of here.
Her weak comforts or plans were cut off as a voice echoed through the hall. Draco tried to restrain a shiver, but he wasn’t sure he managed. That voice was one he’d hoped to never hear again in the real world, one he heard far too often in his nightmares. One he’d never be able to forget and with only a few simple words they managed to suck the warmth, the hope, the strength in the room as efficiently as a horde of dementors.
Hearing the word “friends” from them like that was … off-putting. But the grins on their faces did actually remind him a bit of his friends. They were remarkably Slytherin smirks for two die-hard Gryffindors. He might be able to make this work.
‘Wait, Potter, don’t leave. I can’t leave this room and I-’
Despite whatever Draco had said he still winced at the word. Harry knew that he would, he knew he shouldn’t say it, but he was still incapable of not rising to Draco’s taunts.
Not the home he had here to go back to, but back into his Harry’s arms. He’d be so excited. His hand traced gently over his stomach. There was nothing noticeable there yet, but he knew. Losing half his food each day was reminder enough.
His breath had steadied. His head felt clear – well mostly.
‘Look...at....me...’ he whispered.
Ron shrugged, letting the topic drop to switch to his current favourite one.
‘Moving on.’ He coughed through the words, straight from smoke and ash to dust, what a fun night his lungs were having.
He could fix it … he took a desperate step forward, elbowing through the crowd.
‘All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here,’ Voldemort’s voice was barely louder than a whisper, ‘wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner...and I think I have the answer.’
‘No, I’m done with this. But I’ll find him some
‘You practiced that.’ He concluded.
The commentary in his head had an annoyingly posh tone. After the war he’d started doing that for a few of the people he’d lost. It was comforting to think he was keeping their spirits alive, if only in his head. The people he knew well enough, the ones he’d loved.
The Gryffindor’s were scattered as the wall fell in on them. He could hear the lions scream, he felt a good chunk of the wall pound against his shoulder and by the grunt from the man in his arms, Fred knew where that chunk had almost landed. He tried to push himself up off him, shifting the rocks from his back. It took a few turns of his arms collapsing back under him before he managed it, looking around the wreckage through the dusty corridor to spot the others. The chilled night air cut through the pain, sweeping through the hallway to settle the dust. There was so much blood on Harry’s face, but he couldn’t comfort him. It wasn’t his place. Not yet at least. Hermione pulled herself to her feet next, beaten by the other two Weasley’s to reach Draco’s side.
‘You ass!’ He couldn’t help it, the words escaped him before he thought twice about it.
‘I know that you are preparing to fight.’
Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, ‘Avada Kedavra!’ again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. Left wandless in a fight against three stun happy Gryffindor’s and a curse happy mountain in a room that was about to burn wasn’t ideal. He crouched behind a three-legged wardrobe, steadying his breath as he waited for the next part of the scene.
‘I know.’
‘But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.’
‘Harry?’ mimicked Crabbe. ‘What's going on –’
Three weeks.
The only thing left for Hermione to nag him about was his bloody house. Less annoying than the others but still, just one more thing. He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Draco. He’d solved all his other problems, maybe he had an answer for this one too.
Draco’s grey eyes scanned over the other students. The first time he was as petrified as the rest of them, this time he was determined. He spotted Harry for the first time, skirting against the wall as he headed to the Gryffindor table. He didn’t look that different, not really, it hadn’t been that long ago that they’d both stood in these spots for real. But there was something about him that seemed so young.
He stood up straight, picking three squares in the cell that seemed spaced out about the right distance for comfortable long strides and began pacing. It was five steps, five second.
Maybe it was like Stockholm Syndrome. All he had was Potter, he was beginning to grow on him, like a fungus. A smothering, strangling, captivating type of fungus.
Potter hadn’t given him any other names of friends that he might be willing to invite over, and he was desperate enough to agree.
‘Merlin Potter, there’s a lot to unpack there. There are a bloody lot of things I’ve done that you have a right to demand an answer to … which bruise would you like to poke at now?’ Draco flashed him his crooked smile, trying to lighten the tone, even if it was an offer to answer whatever question was weighing on him.
‘Honey, I’m home.’ He called out, letting the door close behind him as he walked across to where Malfoy had settled for the day. He always seemed to choose the least ashy spot for them, Harry had learnt to trust that.
‘My Lord – let me go to the boy –’
‘Why would I stay Draco? I’m sorry, but from here there are two options for my future. Either no one believes what I’ve done, and I’ll be heading straight for Azkaban, or they do, and I’ll be hailed a hero that I very much am not. Neither particularly appeals to me and I’d say I’ve earnt choosing something for myself for once.’
Even with his steps his breathing wasn’t working right. How the fuck did he usually take five seconds with each breath in and out? He gasped it in in a second, desperate to fill his lungs. It left him with a wheeze, sucked from his body just as fast.
‘Does anyone present have anything to say on the defendant’s behalf?’
Draco’s throat closed, hand flinging to his mouth to try to smother a sob.
It wasn’t fair, he knew it wasn’t fair to throw this at Draco, but they both had enough of the same twisted humour that he thought Draco would get it. He emptied his bag onto the ground, all of the books for his final revision spilling out. Hermione seemed determined to make sure they all had a copy of every book in the library. The exams started tomorrow, and it was all too much. The exams, what came after, everything.
*Full line breaks mean changing from past/future to present/past (makes sense to me, yay time travel!)
‘’kay?! You think all of this-’ he gestured at the room – their room he guessed – their bed, the naked Potter relaxing in front of him. ‘-is covered with that?! You’ve got to be fucking kidding me?!’
He spun to keep pacing, tripping over the cloak as he stopped mid step, staring at a door.
But … if this was his future, if it actually meant he and Harry were married?!
‘Shut it, Potter.’ He growled, turning away.
His breathing began to steady by command. His eyes closed and he pressed his hand firmly against Potter’s chest. The tips of his fingers pressed against the collarbone on each exhale. The movement of the muscles beneath his touch claimed all his attention soon but he didn’t open his eyes.
He saw, out of the corner of his eyes, everyone in the vicinity had stopped to stare. They all grew worried at the look on is face. They knew that look. Someone big was going down.
“Well, what is your type then? If the whole tall, dark and handsome doesn’t fit the bill?”
He settled down to read.
Harry kissed him as he pressed in gently, stopping when just his head was in. Draco's face showed pain, but he soon relaxed when Harry pressed kisses across his face. They continued like this until, inch by inch, Harry was finally sheathed in the tight heat.
“We’ll figure that out in time. For now, just focus on being happy.”
“Well, I’m not sure there’s much I can do for you, Dragon.”
"Then apparate to this address and ask for me." Harry walked into the fire just as he finished saying his destination. As the last syllable left his lips he vanished in a flicker of flames. All in all, Harry had been aiming for a rather dramatic exit, which is exactly what he got.
"You ready?" Draco had to nod so he wouldn't seem inferior to the messy-haired male standing in front of him. He always wanted to prove himself to Harry, even when they were kids. There was just something about him that made him want to better himself, but that was a feeling better left ignored. He stood. "Where's the door?” Draco led the way to the back door.
“Well sure, in theory. It depends on the situation, I suppose. Sure, I could wait until I get my vain streak to calm down a bit but I would do a lot better if I had someone around me to remind me when it becomes a bit obsessive that it’s alright to let something like a single hair out of place go. But if it’s something like...like if my mum just got really sick and was dying. That’s about the worst time to start dating someone, because that will take all of my energy and effort to be there to support her.”
He passed out, the pain in his head too much to push away any longer. His last coherent thought was his hope that Harry got out alive.
“Use the loo and quickly. We’re leaving on holiday today and won’t be back until next month. You’re to stay in your room. Vernon will be putting automatic locks on all the doors so you can use the loo and won’t be able to contaminate the rest of the house with your...freakishness.” He didn’t say anything, just nodded and went to relieve himself before being rushed to the kitchen to start making omelettes. And even though he was stewing with the unfairness of it all, he still managed to not burn the eggs.
The package included a small loaf of freshly baked bread, a small jar of jam and a package of flavoured crackers. Draco usually sent more than this, but it was unlikely that he’d had anything else to send on such short notice. Harry always gave him a few days notice before he’d run out.
"Harry we've been through this before but if I must do this again, then it's worth it. What are you looking for in a person?"
"Enter." Harry swung the door open and walked in, clearly not caring if the blond followed or not. "It's time." Harry's eyes widened. Was Kingsley really giving him the mission he wanted? Wanted so much he had done extensive research outside of work and made an entire three folders of information just from what he got in two weeks.
Draco sighed and kissed him, properly this time. Too overtaken by emotions, they simply glided through dinner and then Harry had introduced Draco to the Weasley's and their little children.
Harry practically shrank back into himself. He’d said too much, but it was too late to take it back.
“Excuse me?”
Draco walked to the park, arm-in-arm with Harry. Most of the Wizarding World knew that Harry had decide to court someone, but no one knew who. As they walked in companionable silence, Draco reminisced on that day.
"So, why were you crying this morning?" He stiffened. "I mean, if you don't want me to be hurt in any way I assume that means emotionally and mentally too. And it hurts me to know I can't help unless you let me in. And it hurts me because then I have to think of ways to get you to open up."
"Good. I'm making coffee to go with it so just have a seat. It'll be done in a few minutes." Draco sat down, hardly able to wait for the delicious-smelling dish to be in front of him.
“Oh hush!” she interrupted him. “Don’t you dare. It’s Narcissa to you.”
"Uncle Sev said you had to sleep with someone." Harry nodded.
He regretted that within thirty seconds.
He kept his eyes closed and his breathing even as Draco gently untangled himself and quietly closed the bathroom door. He rolled over, disappointed that Draco had left but not completely crushed like he would have been had Draco decided to freak out. A part of him had expected that, prepared him for it even, but Draco was surprisingly calm about it.
“Well, you can do it so easily, it must be easy for you to teach it as well. Unless you just don’t have to try for anything in defence.”
“The rest of my appearance? What’s happened to the rest of me? I must look like a freak, I-” Draco cut him off by placing a finger on his lips.
Apparently his confusion showed.
“Oh come off it, of course they use more than just shampoo. Did you think all the different colours in the showers at Hogwarts were all the same thing?” Harry nodded and Draco stepped into the walk-in shower and pulled him with. “Look here, this one is shampoo. Obviously you wash your hair with it. Then there’s this one, just put a bit of this onto the loofa to suds it up to wash your body.”
"You are going to eat. I don't care if you don't tell me anything or everything or only bits and pieces of how you got to be like this," he indicated to Harry's ribs, which were painfully obvious at this point. "but I'm determined to help you get past it and healthy once more."
Soon, he was neigh on hysterics. He simply couldn't believe that he had kissed Draco. He hated feeling so helpless, so uncontrolling of how he felt.
“Come now Cissa, you’ve seen the two of them. You’ve seen how much happier Draco has become, how well he was handling the loneliness before we took Harry in. I think you should talk to him about it. The more informed he is, the more likely the two of them can heal faster. I do hate to see them in pain like that.” She nodded, more to herself than anything.
“Harry, do you think it’s alright if someone comes to study with us today? I had someone ask earlier if he could study with us.”
"Let's go for a stroll before going home. What do you say?"
“I’m going to have tea with Mother today to keep her company. Merlin knows, she’ll be dreadfully upset that she can’t take it in the garden, what with the weather and all.” Harry nodded and Draco left the comfort of the blankets to go find his mother.
And no wonder couples constantly spent time laying about in each other’s arms! Perhaps he enjoyed it so much because he was starved for someones-anyone’s-touch, but he didn’t ever want to move from his current position. That was, until Draco woke up.
“I understand. I don’t like it any more than you. Some inheritances, especially when there is no previous history of them in the family, can be extremely painful. Severus has already informed me that if we try to give him potions or ease his pain in any way, the chances of him dying go up exponentially. You have been so kind as to offer him a home here, despite what the male Malfoy’s have said. I only wish there was something we could do without risking his death.” He paused, looking sadly at the boy whom he had come to love. So much kindness, going through so much torture. It didn’t seem fair.
“I know that but it doesn’t make a thousand galleons any less shiny! Do you know what I could do with that amount of money? A lot, that’s how much!”
"So, have you thought about what you're going to do before it's too late to do anything?"
“Yeah, I trust him.” Even to himself, he sounded forlorn.
“Mum, I’m a teenager-of course I’ll be thinking about ripping clothes off!” She clicked her tongue.
"I can't eat first?" Harry laughed.
After all, Harry’s paddles and collars all labeled him quite perfectly as the slut he really was.
The submissive is the one to initiate the courting phase. The dominant must continue the teasing stage until the submissive verbally expresses their interest in continuing the relationship. Gift giving is crucial for this stage. It is the dominant’s responsibility to not only woo the submissive, but to shower them in gifts. Submissive instincts thrive on it, as it is a show of how much the dominant wants to protect them, to take care of them, and to show that they truly want the submissive for who they are. Meaningless gifts simply won’t do.
Harry walked down the aisle trying to get to his office, but kept getting stopped every time he made a three inch advance. It was like no one wanted him to get his paperwork done! Just like at school, no one ever wanted him to just get his homework done, they always had to give him something else to do. Like, say, defeat a certain dark wizard. It still baffled him that hundreds upon hundreds of grown witches and wizards made just a boy defeat the most powerful wizard their world had known-he had just been a kid for Merlin's sake!
"No. I want a guy like that in my life too. Sometimes I can't always hold others up, and I've found that most women are too helpless for my liking. They always need someone to lean on. Newsflash: I need someone to lean on too." Harry nodded.
“I tried going to him before. Apparently there’s too many ministry employees that would take advantage of getting magical custody over me.” Draco looked incredibly sad and Harry stood. “Let’s go to bed, I’d like to get some sleep before this brunch happens. What even is a brunch anyway?”
"They're designed to keep you alive. And it works."
It was building, the pain. But they managed to keep it at bay by burying themselves into their bond. When Harry finally fell asleep, he dreamt of Draco holding him.
Sure enough, Harry was shifting impatiently after a few minutes. Draco was leaned over the table, picking up random things to munch on as he listened to Blaise and Pansy gush about their summer. He straightened up, just enough to look at Harry and bit into the piece of fruit he had in his hand. When he saw Harry blush, he winked at him and politely dismissed himself from the Slytherins.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry motioned for him to continue. “Have you really never been interested in anyone?”
The two dressed in the pajamas the Room had given them, Draco’s set in a deep burgundy and Harry’s in a deep viridian green. Draco hadn’t even thought twice about the colours being in the wrong sizes, but Harry had noticed and then promptly stopped caring when he saw just how good Draco looked in burgundy.
“Wear it, Sir.” He cast his eyes down towards the floor, falling into his submissive roll quickly.
"Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy was attacked by several spells combined, correct?"
To times of torture and hate and madmen. To a time when Harry discovered he was supposed to die. But no-he wouldn't think of that. Not now, at work. Not while his ex-rival was sitting not three feet away listening to his every word, watching his every move. Not now, but later, when no one could watch him slowly fall apart, like what had happened every night since Harry discovered that he was the unintended Horcrux.
"I remember! Did Kingsley get my memories? Are they convicted to jail? For how long? Do you need me to fill out my statement? Have-" he stopped when Harry hung his head.
Soon enough, or not soon enough to the boys, their last class of the day was wrapping up and they were headed out the door and into the crowded corridor. They walked towards the Great Hall and the doors of the castle when Draco saw it. Harry was flinching whenever someone touched him or when someone's voice was particularly loud. He wrapped an arm around his waist protectively, to provide some form of comfort and security to the man next to him. The flinching didn't go away, but it did lessen a bit.
He should have known things could get worse. He hadn't thought about how busy his mind had been today and how that would affect his sleeping patterns, but he should have. He had never had this much to think about since he had to battle Voldemort and sure enough, he woke up to the sun, something he hadn't done since the War. And then he remembered he had to train Malfoy.
“Not to worry, but if you don’t start dumping more candy into this basket I’ll assume you’re done shopping.” Draco laughed and turned back to the sweets.
Harry proceeded to heat up leftover pizza and talked to Sirius for the rest of the evening. Then at around nine-thirty, Harry made the mistake of moving so the picture could see the clock.
The only thing he couldn’t figure out was why Draco hadn’t mentioned any of this while they had been at Hogwarts. Deciding to voice his question, Narcissa gave him a smile.
"Hm? Oh, nothing. Just thinking about your announcement to the press."
Draco felt well and truly cornered when her eyes narrowed in warning. Checking to make sure that Harry was actually asleep and not just dozing, he blurted, “Alright fine, I like him okay? What’s so bad about reading to him if he likes it?” And there was that stupid smirk again.
And it was with those thoughts that the raven haired teenager started walking down the corridors to the dungeons.
He just jogged like he would any other morning.
Draco saw his mother leave and knocked on the door. He entered when he didn’t hear an answer and sat down in the window seat. “So, I heard Bonnie is making an all out feast of everything she likes to cook best. You asked for it.”
This wasn't going to work if the dunderhead couldn’t even get out of bedl. So Harry pulled out his wand and poured ice cold water all over the blond, laughing when he saw the man jump. Clearly he was wide awake now.
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I have." Harry cocked his head to the side, clearly waiting for an explanation. "I believe that a friend of mine can help." He thought he saw a flicker of hurt in Harry's eyes and he made his choice. He just wasn't sure when he'd act on it.
Teasing:
He knew this was the part in the day where they would part ways for the evening, and he was reluctant to let it be so. He tried to convey that to Harry through the look he tossed over to him.
According to a reliable source, no one knows for sure what Harry Potter did during the summer, or the reasons behind the sudden change in his appearance. But, many people are speculating that the man actually wishes he were a woman! The reporter cannot verify this, but is determined to find out the truth to tell it to you-the faithful readers.
“You’re more than just a friend because somehow I’ve developed a bit of a crush on you.” Harry wasn’t sure what to think. The confession had sideswiped him and took him completely off guard. But the longer he looked at Draco, the more he started to wonder what it would be like to date him.
Vernon yanked him to his feet by his hair. He tried to hold in his cry, as that would only result in a worse beating. He felt himself being thrown like a rag doll, weak with starvation, onto his bed. Pulling himself into a tight little ball, he braced himself for the blow that didn’t come. Instead, he was yanked to his feet again, this time by his wrists. They were so small, Vernon had a free hand that was currently yanking his pants down.
"Sirius..." Harry's voice was soft, pleading. It was a tone Draco never thought he'd ever hear from him.
Or maybe it would be easier to just fall asleep and never wake up.
"It's me."
Again, the blond was astounded. That not only made sense, but appeased both men and his boss.
Harry picked up a pen and, upon not being able to find any spare parchment or paper, simply wrote his response on the back of Draco’s letter.
It was passionate at first, and slowed into something kinder-sweeter. Draco was holding Harry’s head to his, still holding him up in the air while Harry’s legs wrapped around his waist even tighter to prevent himself from falling.
"So...where do you want to go?"
"So...why are you telling me this?"
“I...guess it’s been awhile.” Admitting that out loud was one of the hardest things Harry had done to date. It was true, Ron hadn’t been a good friend for a long, long time. In fact, now that he thought a bit more on it, he hadn’t seen Ron do anything for him that wasn’t immediately followed by him complaining about one situation or another that Harry had come in to save him with. Realizing that hurt, and a part of him wanted to scream that he was having a rough go of it and that once his life evened out financially, presumably once he got a job out of school, that he’d go back to being the friend Harry had once seen in him.
“Oh is that how you get your hair to look so silky?” He blushed, not having intended to actually ask the question out loud. Draco just smiled.
“I’ve been good Professor,” he started. Sitting in one of the large chairs in front of his desk was easy now, knowing he wasn’t about to be pummeled with bad news. “I wonder, what could be so urgent as to pull me away from potions? Snape is fuming down there.”
It was Lucius that had rescued Harry, much to his surprise.
“How bloody dare you spend your time with him? What, am I not good enough for you anymore?” Harry’s heart sped up. He really hated fighting.
"It's not like he'll ever forgive me. And besides, he's my partner. I refuse to break rule number twelve."
“Of course you still look like you. At least to me you do. You’re just a little more...ethreal than you used to be. But it’s a good look.”
“Why’s it got a sheen to it?”
He landed on a bed and looked around, recognizing his garden around him, with the smell of fresh flowers and life around him. He looked at Harry, and smiled just before Harry kissed him.
The spell was performed quickly and when he noticed Harry's expression become strained he considered stopping. He kept going, however, when Harry's face relaxed into an emotionless expression.
This time Draco instigated the kiss, and Harry's heart soared. He was finally getting the chance he wanted and he wasn't about to botch it up. He returned the kiss eagerly and hovered over him so his weight was supported by his arms. Draco wormed his hands out of Harry's and wrapped around his waist, gently tugging, sending a silent plea for him to lay down on him.
They unboarded together and stayed to the shadows behind everyone else. Draco went in with the rest of the student body. Harry waited until the sorting was over to walk through the large double doors.
So far they had gotten eleven done-and they worked nine hours a day, sometimes more.
Draco watches as he broke down and opened his arms. Harry crawled to him gratefully, and buried his face in his neck and his hands clenched the front of his shirt. Draco swore over and over again that it wouldn't happen.
“A bit. But there are more important reasons why I don’t need the full two years.” He could hear Draco smirking, he just knew it.
“I know it hurts, believe me I know. Your mate is out there Harry.” He gently ran his fingers through the boy’s hair while he held Harry against his left side. “Either your mate hasn’t met you yet, haven’t turned sixteen, or they’re like us and going through these changes as well. I can help you through this as best as I can until then.” Harry sniffled and pressed closer into Draco’s chest, relishing in the closeness. It was easing the pain, although not by much.
The rest of that year went by relatively calmly, with Harry doing his absolute best to ensure that Ron had ample time with Lavender and minimal time with him. He missed his best friend, but he really didn’t want to slip up and mention something about studying with Hermione in the library again. Ron had made it very clear it wasn’t acceptable for him to be going to the library for anything other than resources to check out. And it worked well, Ron would spend the majority of his free time with Lavender and that allowed Harry to be able to go about his life relatively normally. That is, until he realized he was being followed by Colin.
He had to make a decision within seven days. Well, six in Draco's mind. A Malfoy is nothing if not punctual, and when it came to his child's life, early was on time. And the sooner the better. Now the only question left was: did he ask Harry or not?
In the next few hours, Draco cussed, yelled and screamed himself hoarse. It wasn't until the third hour in that Draco managed to break Harry's hand. He quickly took that one back and replaced it with the other hand while an assistant Healer sent a charm his way to fix it for him. He gave him a distracted nod and went back to listening to his husband.
Draco came and joined him after a while, sitting on the opposite side of the seat and burying himself in with Harry.
Traditionally everyone got one dance with each of them, but they were hardly traditional after having to go through months of overly-formal traditions. They just wanted to do what they wanted for once.
"They starved me. It wasn't just one meal a day it was one meal every few days. If stale bread and a piece of cheese count as a meal. They locked me in the storage room under the stairs until I was eleven. Then they moved me to a spare bedroom under the threat of Hagrid for a month. They then decided that under the kitchen sink would teach me a nice lesson. I've been stuck under the sink since I was twelve.
"Um...I resigned. And I turned in your maternity leave information." Draco watched him shrug and smirked.
They, at least, got to kiss each other whenever they wanted. Draco didn't have that choice. He didn't have the pleasure of waking up next to the one he cared about. He didn't have that-and yet they did.
Just as he was finishing with breakfast, Harry came walking out in a pair of dark purple skinny jeans, black converse shoes, a black fishnet shirt and belts galore. Gloves adorned his hands as the choker on his neck. Draco nearly drooled as he applied his eyeliner perfectly without needing a mirror. He saw the other boy take a deep breath after he was finished, and as he exhaled his entire body relaxed as though putting on his makeup helped relax him more than anyone could imagine. And it probably did.
“Draco, please. It’s a pleasure to know that you two are willing to forgive me of my past. I’ll see you both on the train to Hogwarts, most likely.” The trio said their farewells, and parted. Harry and Draco entered the Leaky Cauldron and flooed to the Malfoy Manor.
"Payback sucks doesn't it? Now get up, you lazy arse." Draco took the moment to drink some water.
“I-I can’t tell you, really, how this summer started. He told me he doesn’t want me to talk about it, so I won’t. But in the end, my father agreed to pick him up and bring him back to the manor for the rest of the summer. We’ve grown quite comfortable with each other.”
“Anything else I should be made aware of?” He sounded wary, like he wasn’t so sure he would like all these changes.
He saw the blush that crept forward and the shiver that ran down his spine. Harry glanced up towards Draco. Was that really why I woke up with sticky pants today? He folded the letter, tucked it away in his pocket and ate his lunch with excitement brewing in his stomach. If this is what Draco teasing him in public was like, he couldn’t wait to get back up to their rooms.
"Malfoy! Get up and into position." I blankly got into a push-up position and he held his hands by my elbows but directly below my shoulders. "Five more to my hands. Go." Draco was almost crying by the time he was done but his damn Slytherin stubbornness made him stand up and face his soreness and burning muscles. He cast a tempus charm and saw it was only six in the morning.
Of course, if anyone knew this, they'd go straight to the Prophet and divulge all of his secrets. And then his scary factor would go down the drain. Witches would swoon and wizards would try picking him up. No one would take him seriously, and then he'd be stuck with paperwork for the rest of his contract.
They were seated and Draco gently let his wings out.
"Malfoy!" Harry hadn't expected that he would be plowed over the one time he managed to stop his forward momentum. He just passed it off as the world being bent on him forever running into people, no matter who's fault it turned out to be.
He didn’t see Ron until he came to bed that night, but that didn’t bother him.
He removed the bottle from Harry’s delightful arse and opened it.
"Any clue about what? Seriously, this is what I know. I know you were a vicious child because you were scared and on your own. I also know that when you grew older you acted out of fear for your mother and friends. You did exactly what I would have done."
"I forgave you a long time ago for everything that you did. I had worried at the time that it wasn't the right choice to make, but now I can see that it was definitely the right choice. You're worth knowing, that's for sure. I'm not sure where I'd be right now if it weren't for you helping me through this. And I know that you don't really think that you're doing anything...but trust me. You are.
"I know. It's not your fault. I still love you." They remained like that for the next several minutes, just reveling in each other and knowing that Draco meant nothing harmful from his pain-induced screams. A Healer walked up with a white blanket.
He looked up to the second floor and didn’t see Harry but he felt the tug again.
Much to Harry’s surprise, and pleasure, Draco spent a great amount of time licking and prodding his arse until he wasn’t sure what his name even was. That was when Draco leaned over and kissed Harry breathless while inserting a finger.
“Ah, an interesting theory. You know,” he pulled out a rather thick book that looked ancient and plopped it down on his desk before flipping through it. “I haven’t had to look into such a thing but now that you ask, I think it’s high time I take a peek. Don’t you?” Twinkling blue eyes went back to the text, quickly scanning the pages.
Ron had ribbed him endlessly about it, making his heart twinge with guilt, but he stood his ground. He didn’t want to watch a bunch of idiots risk their lives for some money and a trophy.
They waved at him to get a move-on and he thought he heard Sirius mutter something along the lines of 'before my painting yellows.'
"Harry we're in the best salon and spa in the country. Now, I'm bound and determined to make sure that you're happy, and trust me. I know it sounds girlish and petty, but you'll feel absolutely amazing when we leave here." Harry allowed himself to be guided to a changing room and Draco told him what he needed to do. When he got a look of apprehension, he sighed and lifted his arms in exasperation.
"Hey. Feeling worse, I take it?" Draco felt himself nodding. "Here. Take this." The brunet placed a vial of red liquid. "It's a potion for motion sickness. I made it because I get floo-sick every now and again." Draco found himself nodding again and before he could protest, the red liquid was making its way down his throat.
In this case, it is recommended that physical contact length should be determined by the creature themselves. Only they are truly aware of how much pain they are in and if they can get through ten minutes or ten hours without the contact.
“Harry, you can’t help everyone. Sometimes, people are beyond our capabilities. And that’s okay. You might not have the skillset to help him; or he just doesn’t want to be helped by anyone. That’s not your fault. Just because you have to give up on someone, doesn’t make you a bad person. It simply means you’re acknowledging that they’re beyond your reach and it’s healthier for you to let them go.” Harry nodded and tried to ignore the way his heart squeezed.
“Try this. Close your eyes. Now, feel your wings?” He nodded. “Picture them folding neatly behind you. Good. Now imagine them merging with your spine, becoming part of your back.” The wings slowly disappeared and Draco smiled proudly. “Perfect!”
"So...Malfoy are you okay?" The other man's sudden concern threw up a few red flags for Draco. He wasn't sure what to think about the sudden concern, especially the enemy of his childhood.
“You move forward. You can keep presenting each other with revisements or you move forward with the courting once it’s been accepted. And typically the courting is either until a certain age or for a certain amount of time. Your father’s courting with me was a year and a half so we both had some months after reaching the age of majority to transition into adulthood without the marriage getting into the way.”
Never leave your wand.
‘Please let me know by return owl how you’re doing and if you require any supplies. I can only imagine how difficult it is to live without having access to things you may need.
When he woke up he was in warm arms and he snuggled closer to the warmth. It was about three in the morning, according to the clock on the wall, and he smiled. He liked Draco Malfoy and he didn't have a clue as to what to do.
"I let them use mine." Draco let his confused mind run its course before looking up.
“I know you’re concerned about Draco spilling his guts about your inheritance, but I assure you that he will not. Veela are unique for more ways than one. There are only a few reasons we can show our true forms to the people around us. Anger is one, but the other is trust. He trusts you with his secret and he wishes you to trust him with yours. He’s always been a little infatuated with you, you know.” She sipped her tea, knowing that questions were to follow.
"I haven't had the best summer ever. I just thought that maybe it wouldn't be so bad once I was here. I'm kind of disappointed in myself that I let myself think all of the pain would go away overnight."
Madam Malkin went to work taking note of every little detail. She even had Harry flap his wings in slow motion so she could fit him even for when he tried flying out. In the end, they left an hour and a half later, empty handed with the promise that the colors and designs Draco had discussed with her would be owled directly to Harry once they were completed. They paid and traveled down the shop fronts. They got their school books from Flourish and Blott’s, as well as a few others for Harry to enjoy on his time off, and stopped at Eeylops Owl Emporium for some food for Hedwig. She really enjoyed the last batch of food that was made for her, but she seemed to pick around the beetle eyes.
“I’m only here to tell you the facts, not to baby you along the way.”
Draco’s letter back was far faster than Harry thought possible.
He must have said that out loud, because then Draco was answering him.
"No problem. I found that since Snape doesn't breathe down my neck anymore, I'm actually pretty good at potions. You hungry?" Draco nodded and followed Harry down to the kitchen.
"Okay I'll tell you. But you first." Realizing it was the best offer he was going to get, he agreed.
“Shh. Relax. It’s nothing bad. As a matter of fact, even in these ratty old scraps you look rather dashing. Trust me.” Harry’s hands followed everything Draco was mentioning, so he hesitated in between to give him some time to adjust. “Your ears are a little more pointy at the top, your nose is straight now. None of that broken and healed a little off nonsense. Your skin is more fair now, and very soft looking without any blemishes or discoloration. Although you do still blush, it’s more subtle now. Your eyelashes are darker and fuller, your lips are fuller and a nicer shade of pink for your new skin tone. Your hair grew so now it hangs over your eyes a little and it’s got small streaks of color in it.”
To his surprise, he saw her handing a potion to someone with shocking blond hair-what would Draco need from Madame Pomfrey at this time?
“Oh that? It’s sort of slippery so it doesn’t make your skin itch and to be honest it helps a lot if you decide to wank.” Harry blushed at that, but Draco moved on. He was always a bit more open about those things than Harry was. It didn’t make him uncomfortable but Harry wasn’t sure about how to feel about any of those things. He’d only touched himself once and found that he was so scared someone in the dorm would hear he hadn’t done it since.
Harry, upon learning that he had owned several estates and manors of his own, had convinced Draco to move into one with him, and he had. All of his properties were in disrepair, but he planned on fixing that soon enough. It took the two almost five months to fix one estate up, let alone the countless others that they planned on tackling.
"And you felt the need to sit on an uncomfortable chair when you could have been at home? Or staying late at work?"
“Well, with all the fighting we did I managed to get a lot of looking in. Malfoy honor and all that. Gotta look your enemies in the eyes and all.” There was a heavy pause before he cleared his throat. “They look nicer now. They’re a little deeper green and have swirling ribbons of silver and gold in them. Actually swirling. It’s….I’ve never seen anything like it.”
"So Draco, what have you been doing lately? I've been up on a walk, obviously."
Everyone knew that even though Harry wasn't the Department Head, they didn't order him around. They didn't give him their work just because they didn't want to do it. They didn't order him around. They didn't tell him what to do. It just wasn't the way things worked, and with Harry's defeat of Voldemort no one ever questioned the fact that he was more like the head while not having to be the guy to deal with discipline and hirings. Everyone knew that, so when the newbie decided to go against the unspoken rules, the entire floor went deadly silent. It was the kind of silence that created its own noise.
“What’s in the box, love?” He tilted his head to the side upon seeing the contents. “Draco, I have a feeling you know what all this is but I haven’t a clue.” Smiling, Draco placed the box on the bedside table and wrapped his hands around Harry’s neck.
He sat down, unable to comprehend what he just learned.
“So I don’t have to go to the hospital wing. Ron doesn’t like it when I’m there. Says he doesn’t like being concerned for me.”
Later that night they sat down to a quiet dinner in their rooms and settled for an evening in the common room doing whatever each one wanted to do. Draco was writing a Transfiguration essay that wasn't due for another two weeks and Harry was reading over his list and thinking about it like he would have been if he had been anyone else.
“Well...being as I’m the dominant one in the relationship I’d have to be...well…” his cheeks flushed a bright pink. “You know...I’d have to be the one in you but with you needing to drink from me...I just want to make sure you’re comfortable and taken care of…”
The fact that he had everything he could ever want right there, his eyes started to tear up. Not crying was one of his strong suits and apparently once he started, he couldn't stop.
“What’s on your mind?”
Harry woke up and got out of bed. He couldn't sleep, yet again. He tried to sleep on his own, but even when he could sleep he'd have terrible nightmares. And he couldn't take anymore dreamless sleep potion because he'd risk an overdose and slip into a coma.
The two had decided to return to Draco’s home for the holiday season. Draco had spent the entire train ride carding his fingers through Harry’s hair while Harry slept. Turns out train rides put him to sleep.
“No, you got me drunk, remember?” At this, Harry closed his eyes and opened them again in one really long blink.
“Harry, completing the bond is crucial, you can’t drink from me until then.” Harry whimpered, but nodded against his shoulder.
A soft touch under his chin lifted his face a fraction before he flinched. The finger withdrew, regardless of how much Harry wanted it to stay when he realized the touch wasn’t meant to hurt him.
To say that Draco was shocked was an understatement. Who knew that Harry would have the guts to even consider telling others how to cheat the system for money. Hell, who knew he'd actually think about the best ways to cheat the government out of money.
“No, I was simply curious. Thank you Headmaster.” He left, wondering how he was possibly going to survive at the Dursley’s knowing that they didn’t treat him very well compared to people other than Dudley. Somehow, it was worse knowing that no one else he could think of was treated the way he was.
“Okay, here. Maybe easing you into this will help the shock settle a little slower.” He pressed Harry’s hand onto one of the wings that had appeared the day before. They were slightly spread out, outlining Harry’s body so they wouldn’t get too squished being under him.
Before he could stop it, their lips connected in an explosion of sensation and Harry practically melted into the arms holding him up. Gentle hands caressed his face as Draco’s tongue slid against his lips asking for entrance. He allowed it without a second thought and lost himself in a wave of sensation.
“Well, you know where to find me if your chess game ends early or something.” Harry nodded, swallowing past the lump that had formed in his throat.
So the least he could do was wait until he woke up. Instead of feeling sorry for the sleeping man, he thought about what he said before passing out. He had heard, with perfect clarity, that the lesson was learned. Good, so he was forgiven for poisoning his partner. That made him feel a little better about what he did, even with all of the shit he had been put through thanks to the Sleeping Beauty in front of him.
"Goodnight Mr. Malfoy." He then leaned down and place a gentle, chaste kiss to Draco's lips and proceeded to his room to let Draco wonder at what he had just done.
Draco woke up on time and looked around waiting for his trainer from hell and partner from his worst nightmares. When he didn't show up by six, Draco decided it was about time to start running. The last thing he needed was to take a day off. He knew that he'd hurt worse if he didn't keep up with Harry's mad training from the Devil's gym. That and he wanted to impress him when he showed up. He was tired of knowing that Harry, and most other people, thought of him as lazy just because he grew up a rich little boy. No one ever knew that he went out to the pitch late at night from second year on to practice for hours on end just to better himself. No one ever knew that he would go to bed early to study his head off so he could get better grades and do better. They just assumed it was from how he was raised and he was sick of having people see him like that. He was determined to impress Harry if it killed him.
The presents all turned out to be books for Draco and cloths for the baby. Harry smiled as the blond excitedly looked back at him with warmth in his eyes. As he opened the last one, a box with a few rattles in it, Harry got up and plucked a small box from the back of the tree.
“Alright Harry, calm down there. In time, I shall stake my permanent claim to you but until then, you must be patient. Isn’t that supposed to be a virtue of yours?”
"I need you to take up Mission X." He couldn't believe it. He got it! This was what he wanted so desperately he lost sleep over it. This was it.
“I’ve forgotten that my son doesn’t ever wait around when he wants something. Now, back to the estates…”
“Just don’t think too hard, you’ll hurt your head.” Harry clearly knew that he was joking if the smile was anything to go by. It was enough to take Draco’s breath away.
“What are you doing here?” They asked each other.
“Just curious on how long you were plotting my demise.” They laughed and Draco continued reading.
Harry pulled Draco into a tiny alcove in a deserted hallway.
"Okay. Well I can tell you what's going on with him now since I know what spells were combined based on previous tests.
“Mother, are you feeling alright?”
By the end of the week, Harry was restless. He wanted to get up, to do something. Draco suggested chess, reading in the garden, studying, even offered to square off in a match of Catch the Snitch but nothing sounded like enough.
Deciding to take the middle ground, he asked Draco a question in response.
"He's got the most gorgeous eyes ever. They're blue but more like a watery blue almost like they could pass as silver from far away. I can never get enough of that color. And they're outlined by all of those black eyelashes that curl up just slightly." Harry could feel a blush rise up to his cheeks but studiously ignored it in favor of talking about Draco.
"So, what's your real reason for coming over? I know you said you were lonely, but you didn't have to come to me."
“I’m pretty sure because I’m still at school there’s some sort of law preventing a mass amount of contract proposals to me. I’ll admit, I’m a bit afraid of the insanity that will ensue after we leave Hogwarts. I’m not blind, I’ve seen the articles on the how-tos for sending ‘Harry Potter, the Most Eligible Wizard Alive’ a contract. I’ll be honest, I’m dreading it and I don’t really want anyone else.”
He told his house elf to take the night off and proceeded to make dinner himself. Pizza sounded good, so he started mixing the dough. He had just tossed it up in the air for the fourth time when he heard the fireplace roar to life, signaling that someone was trying to fire-call. He answered it.
"Thanks Pansy." Draco cleared his throat before continuing. "That means a lot." She nodded in recognition to his admission and finished her meal just as Severus handed everyone their schedules.
Without a thought, they were left completely naked against each other. Draco gasped at the sudden change, and Harry almost came then and there when he realized their clothing was the only thing keeping their members from touching.
“Oh tosh, just because you had a bit of an accident-”
He slept like a rock for the first time, in a long time.
“Would you let me try to take care of you the way I never got to?” Harry nodded, this throat having closed up with emotion at the genuine sorrow Narcissa had showed about his mother’s passing. Her soft voice broke him from his reverie. “Would you let Draco try to make amends for his wrongdoings in the past?” Harry took a deep breath and nodded after a moment. It was the least he could do for the Slytherin to stay here and try to keep him from going mental with unanswered questions.
Before he knew it, Harry had packed their belongings up and he was putting his arm in the brunet's again, being led home by one of the most wonderfully funny men he had ever met.
“Happy Christmas,” he said.
"Um...Are you all right?" The voice that came from his throat was small and insecure, as if he expected to be hit for asking such a question. Or any question at all, for that matter.
“I’ll stay. Mother?” Narcissa whisked everyone out of the room and closed the door softly.
"Yeah, we do. So, I've put in some thought over the years, and I don't feel I belong in the House I was once in."
"What's on your mind?"
"Are they in jail?" Harry nodded and upon seeing this, Draco sighed with relief. Another question, one that was bothering him since he woke up, made its way out of his throat. "Why did you stay?" He couldn't fathom why someone who he used to hate and who only worked with him now would stay by his side for so long. It didn't make sense to him. Harry had no reason to stay for him, there was no need for him to be here. It wasn't like Harry was the only one that could save him. That's what the Healers were for.
Draco escorted Harry to Restaurant Le Meurice Alain Ducasse, an extraordinarily hard restaurant to get reservations for. The decor stunned Harry, the white walls and detailed gold and silver accents took his breath away. When Draco had given his name, the staff bowed and led them to a separate dining hall. This one was just as extravagant, but magically enlarged and warded for wizards only.
“If he agrees, would you be willing to teach him? Father wouldn’t have the patience to start over like that, he doesn’t know anything other than what he sees at Hogwarts.”
"I need them. If we can keep these two motherfuckers in prison, I need your memories." Harry just sat there, and finally nodded in defeat. He did make that obligation before becoming Draco's partner.
“Even if it’s Draco?” That gave Harry pause. He didn’t like that Ron went out of his way to bully the Slytherin, but the repercussions of not participating were bad. The one time he refused to take part in taunting the blond had resulted in Ron screaming at him and digging at his every insecurity before giving him the cold shoulder for over three weeks. He tried to keep everything as tame as possible after that, even going so far as to sneak peeks at the map Headmaster Dumbledore had given him with his father’s cloak to ensure they could avoid Draco Malfoy on the way to class.
"No problem."
All-in-all, Draco found it highly annoying.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter. I heard we gave everyone quite a scare with the inheritance hitting you so hard.” She started casting diagnosis spells and fished out several potions from a small bag. “Ahh, here we are. Well Mr. Potter, your throat has been ripped raw, which I expected with all your changes. It was bound to hurt, yeah?” He nodded. “Here, open up. It won’t taste good, but it’ll make your throat feel so much better.”
Elizabeth was sleeping soundly in her frame and Draco looked at all of the charms on his bracelet. The rose his mother had hand-gilded and painted was just as sad as ever. The petals were closed more than usual and the leaves were wilted. It meant that he was closed off to everyone around him and that he wasn't happy.
"I can't. The baby, remember?" He looked put-out but nodded anyway. Harry gently kissed his way down his neck, leaving little marks here and there. Draco pulled at Harry's clothes and they both chuckled when he pouted at the cloth for not coming off fast enough. Deciding to help everybody out, they undressed themselves down to their boxers and laid back down next to each other after walking inside to Draco's bed. Harry moved a strand of hair away from Draco's eyes.
"I have my ways. Now. BED!" Harry didn't need telling twice. He ran up the stairs, plopped into bed and promptly fell asleep.
“Ron that tournament has killed people before! No amount of money is worth your life.”
When he arrived at the door, with Draco at his heels to send off anyone that they had happened to meet along the way, Harry knocked on the door quietly. So quietly, in fact, that Harry was surprised that Severus heard it and answered it within a few moments. He pulled the cloak off only after he was inside, and immediately he was greeted by a warm embrace and an understanding heart.
"I'm not answering questions. I'm going to tell you why I've changed and what I feel is necessary for the public to know." He took a deep breath, and he noticed that Draco moved slightly closer, providing him with more comfort in knowing that he wasn't about to leave anytime soon.
The next few months were spent going to classes and the spa. It seemed that Harry really had enjoyed going and had taken it upon himself to wake Draco up extra early so they could go earlier and spend the rest of the day lounging around in their rooms or simply shopping before going in.
All noise was stopped as Snape stood to address the student body. The only noise was the loud banging of the double oak doors slamming on the walls behind them as Harry walked in. He stopped and made eye-contact with the one person who had kept in touch with him over the summer and helped him through his problems enough so he could pretend he was all right in front of others.
“Doesn’t that bother you? That it’s been so long you had to think about it?”
He was so confused; he was not used to being out of the loop with anything. Especially with how people feel and work. Harry was just different and he liked challenges. They interested him.
He stood and stretched his back. I managed thirty perfect push-ups and then my arms suddenly collapsed.
"Dearest Draco~
"Yes?"
“Not too easy either, Sir.” Harry chuckled nervously.
"I'm teasing Draco. So...you're willing to give it all up for a tiny ball of cells?"
About twenty minutes later, the blond stretched and made a slight noise contentment as his muscles stretched. His whole countenance relaxed and his head rested on the pillow, the rest of his body was wrapped up inside of his covers in a makeshift cocoon. He was warm for once when he woke up, despite the too-large bed he slept in.
Suddenly, Draco’s hands were busy trailing through Harry’s wings. His mind reeled with the overwhelming sensations, pleasure tearing through his body and threatening his sanity. Before long, Harry was begging Draco for more. He happily obliged, kissing Harry senseless. Their bodies rocked gently against one another until Harry noticed they both were wearing pants still.
The rest of the weekend went the same-highly uneventful as they both had finished their work fairly soon into the summer. But when Monday had come around, they were slightly afraid of facing the school.
"Harry, you're not weak. You're no longer carrying the weight of everyone else, I don't know why you still think that you are. I understand what you're going through but that does not confuse me any less. I had a fair amount of responsibility also, and my part is long gone. I no longer feel like you still are. It is not necessary anymore." Harry nodded.
"Good. But you skipped a part in your poking around. You have to ask in person." A feeling of dread raised itself to the surface. What if he was just planning on hurting him? But he put a quick stop to these thoughts. Draco had just spent a fair amount of time showing genuine emotions. He wasn't about to ruin that by letting his fears get the better of him.
Draco Malfoy was running on his own, down the same path they took on the very first day Harry started training him. He was astonished to see that his partner was almost halfway done with the three-mile path Harry had made, which had to mean he had started a while ago. He was amazed, no one had ever taken the initiative to start their training without him, and the fact that Draco Malfoy of all people did surprised him. He hadn't been surprised since he had seen all the students that took cover in the Room of Requirement when Snape had been Headmaster. It seemed that Draco was stirring a lot of emotions he hadn't thought he could feel in years.
“No, I can’t be. I’m just Harry.”
They danced and kissed and openly touched and flirted. They let love shine through their eyes, and as soon as the last dance ended, they were out the door faster than the words 'have fun' could have been uttered.
“No idea why it’s this big, but mum insisted.”
It just didn't make sense to Harry. Every time he seemed to be having a good day something always had to go wrong. Call it whatever you want, but Harry needed certain things to be run certain ways because of the war and nothing anyone did would change it. But it seemed that those ways can get in your way more often than not when the world decided to send people who didn't know what they were doing your way.
"I mean...With me? Are you happy with me?"
When Draco insistently ground against him, he added another finger and both men froze. Harry waited for Draco to sign that it was okay and when he hesitantly moved his hips, Harry's fingers finally found his prostate, making Draco scream in pleasure. Harry smiled and stretched him to add another finger and pretty soon Draco was fucking himself on Harry's hand. He pulled them out and turned the man over, wanting to see his face throughout the rest of what was to come. Draco's eyes were clouded with lust and his breaths was shallow.
“Mhm. You’re magic was so powerful your body had no other choice but to revert back to a magical creature that can hold that much magic without risking injury. Quite amazing, really. There’s only been a small handful of others who have received such a gift as the one you were presented with.” She packed her bag and made for the door. “I will be informing Mrs. Malfoy of the potions you need to take, and when Mr. Potter. I suggest calling on St. Mungo’s if you have any other ailments or concerns in a few days. Don’t overdo yourself Mr. Potter. I have heard plenty from Madame Pomfrey about you, and I would hate to see her worry over you more than she needs to.”
Harry shrugged. “I’m not sure why. My parents were killed by a madman, why would that make me special?” Professor McGonagall had given him a brief synopsis of Voldemort while they were shopping, but he wasn’t entirely sure why it made him so famous.
"Fuck rule number twelve. You need someone to make you happy and that's exactly what he does." That was the last of their conversation he heard. He wasn’t sure he would be okay knowing who they were talking about.
Ron made a face and scoffed a negative. Harry, on the other hand, politely told her that they hadn’t but they’d gladly keep a watch out for one. She turned to Harry and smiled, thanking him.
Please Draco, it isn’t fair that you’re away from me and I have to go without pleasure! The imagery stopped and the lust lessened.
Draco had gone to Harry in search of advice when he started receiving all the gifts and had gotten no answer other than a smile and the suggestion that he talk to Severus. That old man hadn't been much help either, other than the fact that he should trust this person wasn't a weird creep.
It was waiting for him on their bed when they got out of classes. Draco had sent him on to drop his stuff while he stayed behind to chat with the potions master. He gently opened it, revealing a box inside with Madam Malkin's logo on the top in white calligraphy. He quickly read the note that was on top of the silk packaging.
This time, he had told Hedwig he was going to let her stay at Hogwarts during the summer, to which she seemed quite sad about. He’d spent hours reassuring her that he wanted to take her with but that it wasn’t safe for her to go with him. He loved her too much to see her hurt when she could remain safe at the school owlery.
"The intense pain is caused from the fact that babies aren't naturally meant to be made like this. He will die, along with the baby, within the next week if someone else doesn't manage to...re-fertilize, if you will, the egg his body made.
"CLASS STARTS IN THIRTEEN MINUTES! LET'S GO!" That seemed to do the trick. He quickly jumped up and proceeded to throw clothing on at a mad pace. Eyeliner was applied magically, and food was grabbed as they ran out the door and down the corridors leading to the potions classroom. Severus might like the two of them, but that wouldn't mean that he wouldn't be mad if they showed up late to his class.
"Potter!" Ah, now this is why Draco was put into Slytherin all those years ago. Payback is a bitch. He drew out his wand and sprayed a gentle stream of ice cold water on the man.
Later that night, Harry and Draco focused on sending each other still pictures. They were hyper aware that most other bonds weren’t strong enough to do that, and they relished in the thought of seeing things the other one was. It reduced the amount of pain they were in considerably.
By the time the two were yawning, Draco had convinced Harry to stay in the Room with him to sleep for the night. Harry reluctantly agreed but somehow managed to stutter out a warning that he tends to have nightmares so he might want to stick to his own side of the bed to prevent himself from getting hurt.
"Draco, I have a proposition for you. Harry only feels comfortable sleeping with one person he trusts and it cannot be me any longer. I know you don't want to be with the others in your dorm, and so I'll let you two move into your private rooms if you'll agree to it." Harry closed his eyes, just wanting to feel the rumble of his slow voice and not wanting to see Draco's reaction.
“No time for dawdling. Now don’t let go of my hand and take a deep breath.” He did and was suddenly met with a wholly uncomfortable squeezing sensation and fought off the urge to be sick when it ended. “Rather unpleasant your first few times, but you’ll get used to it. Now come along, we haven’t got all day. We’ve a tight schedule Mr. Potter, the train leaves in only two hours!” He let himself be tugged and lead around a magical street with signs everywhere claiming the name to be Diagon Alley. Not having the faintest idea where they were in the country, he let himself gaze on all the magical things around him. Spells being cast without so much as a thought, items floating midair and changing colour to attract the attention of passerby, cauldrons stirring themselves with strange concoctions inside...he could hardly contain his excitement.
After that, he went back to his office. He managed to get ahead in all of his paperwork and sent it all to the appropriate people before it was time for him to leave, so he went to the head of the department.
Harry waved at him sadly, watching him step into their floo and disappear in a flash of green flames.
“Fine dear. A bit sad the rain has taken the patio for the day, but the flowers do need a drink. How are you and Harry?” Draco blinked, surprised that she had asked about Harry.
Harry let go of his inhibitions and just talked.
“Uh...not really. But there’s only one key to my vault at Gringotts and I don’t really spend that much.” If Draco hadn’t been brought up with impeccable manners, his jaw would have dropped.
He knocked on her office door and eyed his trainers while his teeth worried his bottom lip. Doubt filled him. Adults had never listened to him before, so why should they start now?
Crossing his legs, he managed to snap out of it to look at Malfoy. Now that he was up, he wanted answers.
“What, me? What gave you that idea?”
“I don’t often have much reason to laugh, if I’m going to be honest.”
"So Draco. Ready to throw away your figure and position in society for something so small you can't even see with a microscope yet?" Draco bristled.
The floor was covered in ivory carpet, matching the ivory walls. Behind the bed was an impressive set of french doors that led out to a balcony. The curtains were the same as what was on the bed. Harry had yet to close his mouth, he had never seen someone put so much thought into something for him.
"Mr. Malfoy was hit by a powerful Dark spell, that was never intended to be used in the first place. What it does is it makes a male produce woman's organs and one egg. Being that he also keeps his male organs, he basically fertilized his own baby inside of his body.
The last thing he wanted was to deal with that situation so he left it be and turned the shower off before grabbing the towel from the box.
When he thought he wouldn't be able to keep the food inside his stomach anymore, he heard a delighted cry from the Healer.
"Damn it Kingsley, what is it this time?" Harry's gut filled with dread. Not one fire-call from Kingsley ever ended well for the auror. It usually ended in a few nights of no sleep and lots of overtime.
“For the final time Father, negotiations are to bring two sides to a compromise of which both can live with. I have no problems negotiating. I’m much happier with the contract I agreed to than the one I sent this morning. Now if you don’t mind, I have some things to attend to. Goodnight.” Draco got up to leave and Harry was quick to follow suit. He hadn’t even left the dining room before Narcissa was lashing into Lucius about always needing to have more control than necessary.
“Listen, I wasn’t sure how they worked myself. I’d put off learning about them since I wanted to have fun at school; I didn’t want to tie myself down to anything too soon. I know myself, I would have tried to bring up contracts with everyone I liked and I didn’t want the other purebloods to think I was too indecisive for their offspring. By removing the temptation to court everyone I laid eyes on, I refused to learn about them.”
"Draco, I'm assuming you signed up for desk work, am I wrong?" He shook his head, wondering where this was going. "Sorry to have to inform you...I don't play well with others, as you probably noticed." He nodded. "So my boss wants me to go around catching all these people. I have some good contacts and I'm an excellent tracker. This is fine with me. However, the paperwork is overwhelming.
"And that's another thing! This feels right, being in your life and not punching you or ripping on your friends. It feels right to be around you and to run with you and having you make me memorize a bunch of spells that seem to have no purpose when I learn them. It feels right, all of this. And, of course,-"
“Somewhere between ancient runes and patrolling for troublemakers. Why?” Harry yawned and Draco had to look away, lest those emerald orbs manage to get him hard while Harry’s head was using his lap as a pillow.
"HARRY!" He jumped as the two portraits yelled his name simultaneously.
He noticed Hermione put a charm on their compartment door as she walked by, no doubt showing the younger years where to go. She returned after the train started moving and quietly stowed her things away. She didn’t say anything but pointedly looked at Harry and back at him with an eyebrow raised.
After each house was cleaned out and redecorated to Harry's liking, they then obtained two house-elves per house to keep it in good shape (one female one male, in the hopes that they'd reproduce).
"Harry, we did some extra research with better sources and equipment. All of it points in the same direction you were following. So file four is what we found, nothing too far off of what we already knew. Brief Malfoy today. You start tomorrow."
"I know, Sev. I'm sorry." Severus walked to him and put his hands on his shoulders gently.
“Do you really think so?”
He walked around opening doors and listening for any sign of movement. Coming upon the last door in the hallway, he listened at the door before hearing a slight shuffle of cloth. It sounded like silk but he couldn't be sure.
He had sponsored these gardens, and therefore he could have anything marked off-limits and could have the best florists and herbologists decorate any area any way he wanted.
Gulping, he focused all his energy on it. He needed to feel something from it, anything at all. Suddenly, he felt it. A comforting feeling tinged with loneliness. At the same time, his necklace glowed.
"The biggest mistake in my career. I was at a widow's house questioning her. She offered me a drink and poisoned it when I wasn't looking. Thanks to a friend, I carried around a box of bezoars with me. It took me a month to recover fully." Harry could see the concern on Draco's face and waved it away.
He walked into the tent half exhausted at three in the morning and saw Harry getting up.
“I bloody well know that! But you don’t understand, he’s always trying to be better than his brothers and his family doesn’t have enough money to go around and he’s just trying to make the best of a bad situation. It’s not his fault he doesn’t know how to handle it! His family puts a lot of pressure on him to be better.” Draco shook his head and focused on needing a sobriety potion. The Room, being the best thing ever at that moment, supplied two on the coffee table. He drank one and handed the other to Harry.
You mean the world to me, my angel.’
“Father had looked into it a little further for me. He said most dark angels have to spend up to two weeks apart. He did say that when a dark angel has a mate that is another creature then it depended on the creature they were mated to, if they were submissive or dominant and how much power they possess. With all the bits of information Father gathered, he thinks we’ll be on the shorter side, needing only a few days.”
“Welcome first years! And to our older students, welcome back!” Dumbledore’s voice rang out across the hall. Harry and Draco were in a room off to the side, presumably the professor’s lounge. They were nervous, their wings out and their ethereal beauty shining brightly. They were supposed to walk out on McGonagall’s cue. Dumbledore’s speech finally drifted off after he introduced McGonagall for the sorting.
Exhausted, he put his quill down. It had taken a few hours to finish the essay on horklump juice, he had always mixed up the properties it had with a horned slug.
From that day on, Harry did his absolute best to not let anyone see him studying with Hermione and Draco in the library. He’d wear his invisibility cloak and sneak into a seat at their table before Hermione would cast notice-me-not charms around their area and strong silencing charms so no one would hear Harry talking.
But if the situation were thrust upon him, there was no doubt in his mind that he would immediately try and find someone to stay with him and the baby. He would've done anything-even use his fame.
Harry woke up the next day feeling more refreshed than ever and carefully got out of bed without waking Draco. He dressed in clothes the room provided, used the loo and made his way down to breakfast.
"Draco?" Harry had finally calmed down enough to speak.
"Be nice Sirius."
“What’s this about?” Draco squirmed under the concerned gaze. “You can tell me anything, you know.”
“Really?” Harry took a bite of a crumpet before drinking the potions that were laid out so carefully for him. He continued to nibble and sip as Narcissa talked.
"Anyway, it's not natural. And until it IS natural, it will continue to basically suck the life out of you. You'll both perish." He saw the panicked look on Draco's face and hurried into his next point. "Draco, you need someone to...donate?...their DNA and to share this child with you. Like, within the next seven days. That's the only way you and this child are going to survive." Draco's face was blank.
Really not much had changed in his routine since coming back to school, other than the school part. He woke up at the same time every day, went to bed at the same time, ate at the same times...the only thing he wasn’t doing now that he was at the manor was sleeping with Draco next to him and listening to Draco read fiction novels. Now Draco was prone to reading textbooks to him, although he’d promised to switch back to the fiction novels during the weekends when their homework was done. Harry was still bitter about that decision, he wanted to know what happened to Scarlett already!
Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed the ice mice before they all fell from their teetering tower and Draco turned with fire in his eyes before realizing who had stolen his haul.
‘You’re not there …’ He added, he hadn’t meant to say that part out loud, but there it was. The real reason he couldn’t imagine living there. He wanted his future to have Draco in it.
‘Whatever, you’re dismissed, Potter.’
‘Congratulations for what exactly?’ He grumbled out at the same time Potter answered with a dopey grin and a blush-
The twins looked amused. Potter looked sheepish. He wasn’t going to like the answer.
The flames lit Draco’s face; it did look good. Most importantly though, he looked happy. Even if it was at Harry’s expense it was worth it. There wasn’t really any point defending himself here. The room was working against him.
I have no real clue on chapter lengths, but each should cover about a month. We’ll have part of future and past in each chapter, though at this point I think a lot more happens with Older Draco back in time than Younger Draco in the future. They both have their struggles though!
‘Fine, what would you do if you weren’t fucking dead.’
‘-he’s a duplicate. DupliDray?’ Twin 2.
The Minister gestured to the Auror’s at the side of the room and they moved towards him as one. They had to get him out of there before he caused more of a stir. It was quite a claim, a pregnant pureblood male would be rare enough to be protected. Or at the very least not killed.
‘Good girl!’ he roared to Ginny, his grey hair flying as he led a small group of students past. ‘They look like they might be breaching the north battlements, they've brought giants of their own.’
That explained the feelings he had, the weird moments. If Draco felt the same way … Merlin he’d been an idiot.
‘It’s Ginny.’ He managed to get out, throwing the letter out for Draco to read if he wanted.
He pretended the words were for him. Shoving himself off the wall as he broke into a staggered run down the hall. He stared at the ground in front of him and just focused on keeping moving. It didn’t matter if he ran into someone, he didn’t have a wand anyway, his only hope was that no one spotted him.
He’d grown up well.
‘So, what can we do for you, Baby Draco?’ One of them said with a grin.
Hell, if it hadn’t been a question of life and death, he wouldn’t have risked telling them at all.
‘Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!’
Then.
‘You fucking died for them Potter, it’s your turn to decide what you want to do.’
‘Sure,’ as amenable as ever, ‘Just the twins to start with?’
Mildly embarrassed and ashamed of the reaction, probably.
‘We came to get you, didn’t we? You did call for me after all.’ Answered Fred, the twin with both ears.
‘So, here we are.’ They finished perfectly in unison.
‘I don’t know if they could have been better people without me. Maybe they preferred things the way it was, they used me just as much as I used them, just in more basic ways where mine were more obvious orders. I like to think it worked for all of us though. Regardless, in that moment, they might have gone against my loyalty to follow someone stronger, but so had I. It’s what I taught them anyway so I couldn’t really fault them for that. I still owed him my protection. It’s all I could do. If I kept myself alive all the way through the war, betraying everyone else around me, then that’s fine. I have my own moral code to my family and to both of them.
‘What?’
. You date someone because you need them. Because every moment you spend with them is how you want to spend every spare moment of your life, and you last moment. The thought of kissing them keeps you awake at night and distracts you even when just staring at them across the room.’ Draco’s tone had turned wistful, the way his eyes glazed over, he wasn’t just describing what he thought, he was remembering a feeling … ‘The thought of holding them, being pressed against them makes your heart race … not just because you didn’t have a problem with them …’
Missing one, but he guessed they didn’t know about that one yet.
Draco stared at the larger boy, still relishing just hearing his voice again, and chuckled.
What? Why the fuck would I do your homework, Potter?’
‘Call Fred fucking Weasley!’ He screamed, the desperation breaking his words. ‘I saved him! He knows I saved him! That’s got to be worth something!’
Draco laughed, completely ignoring what Harry thought were reasonable concerns.
‘Give me Harry Potter, and they shall not be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded.
When they reached the main hall, his eyes scanned the room. There was no one running to greet him. He couldn’t spot the familiar figure he was looking for. Everyone was staring at him, the Ministry workers, the reporters who’d gotten wind of his release. Only two were walking towards him though, with uncomfortably familiar shocks of red hair.
Draco snorted, yeah, because that was what was really important. It was like when they read the safety videos on the plane (which he’d been painfully attentive to, terrified out of his mind while Harry laughed at him), you leave your shit and get the fuck out. Oh, and high heels off. He glanced at Pansy; she mustn’t have gotten that memo.
For once Malfoy was silent. That was even more disturbing than his constant prattle. He was waiting for Harry to fill in the blanks, to explain what the hell he was doing.
That was a mistake.
‘You have me.’ He murmured, not sure how that was really meant to comfort him, but it felt like the right thing to say, it made him smile at least. That infuriating, knowing smile that was all Draco.
‘Well … he was my friend.’ He started simply.
It was hours later, he had more than the required inches written, more potions knowledge about using pewter bloody cauldrons than he ever wanted to know. He didn’t want Malfoy to stop speaking though. The rhythmic cadence of his voice, the enthusiasm in his words. He’d never get sick of listening to it.
Potter sighed, hand tangling through his bird’s nest hair.
He left without another word.
‘No, Potter! Crucio!’ the curse missed, hitting the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.
‘Have you decided what you’re going to study yet? I know McGonagall said we could still swap until four weeks in given … everything … but really, imagine being four weeks behind on class! We really should make sure you’re positive about your subjects.’ Hermione was straight into study mode; it was nice there were at least some things that didn’t change.
He frowned. Sure, yes, he’d often thought that, but he’d never shared the thoughts. Maybe he did have to accept he’d shared something with the twins. That they might have some kind of spot in his future.
‘No fucking way …’ He was quiet but his voice filled the silence of the corridors.
Once they were closed in the room two pairs of brown eyes settled on him.
‘He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk.’ Replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws.
‘Blimey, d'you reckon it'll still work after that fire?’ asked Ron, he staggered to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and right. ‘Shall we split up and look –?’
‘What do you think you’re doing? Wand down idiot.’ He was counting on the shock of the order to work.
It was hard not to follow him.
‘No!’ he shouted, clutching at Vince’s arm so he couldn’t cast, the next line, he had an excuse here… ‘If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!’
At least some of us.
‘Fuck.’
Malfoy shifted with a hum of disapproval.
‘What the hell did you read that had them in it?’ Harry pressed.
‘Breath Draco. With me.’
‘I guess the room worked out what you required.’
Sure, he hadn’t actually left yet, Draco had no reason to think that might be what he was planning to do. Except that he’d lived through it. Through his funeral, through years of thinking his godfather had died hating his life, through night after night of Harry wallowing on the guilt for a man who was never given the recognition in life that he deserved. He knew that’s what the man before him had planned to do, even if he didn’t have the words to explain it. So, he stuck with the simplest words he had.
That would have been fun.
‘Mr Malfoy, please, restrain yourself. We’ve given our verdict.’
He couldn’t look back. Couldn’t lose the time. Couldn’t risk what he might do if he saw him again.
He locked eyes with him, letting the certainty, pain and knowledge that he had shine in them. Not actually allowing Legilimency, he wasn’t that desperate yet, but what was in his eyes seemed like enough.
‘Let's move, NOW!’
‘Because what you came from wasn’t exactly fantastic-’
Because the other option … why the fuck would he have told THEM?
This time, his heart still pounded, but the overwhelming fear was missing. It wasn’t a trial; it was a rerun. His eyes scanned the room, looking for the mess of black hair. It was missing, but it would be here soon, he didn’t remember if Harry had been there from the start last time, he just remembered him speaking up. They weren’t at that point yet, maybe he came in late?
The guards were reluctant to let him out and they didn’t do a thing to hide it.
The Fiendfyre leapt at his heels and he felt tears running down his cheeks as he gagged on the smoke and ash. The fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, before being consumed by the inferno.
Fred looped an arm around his shoulders, his hand barely resting against him. Delicate, so careful. He could see the tears in his eyes. He felt bad.
He needed to do better than this.
Severus sighed, a deep, bone-weary exhale.
‘Honesty, just admit it, you’re happy to see me really.’
Male pregnancies didn’t work the way normal ones did. The womb was magic. The second he was pregnant his organs began to shift. This was the first time he’d been sick which meant he’d probably gotten knocked up last night.
One hand twitched at his side wanting to reach for the wand that wasn’t there. The other fell flat against his stomach. His thin fingers wouldn’t be any real protection if they decided to attack, but that’s where it wanted to be.
your stupid Harry. I want to go home.’ If he was standing, he might have even stomped his foot, he sounded so sulky.
He gagged over the toilet bowl, coughing up bile from the bottom of his stomach. Whether that was the baby or just his horror at the situation was anyone’s guess.
‘I read?’ That sounded like far too much of a question for it to be the truth.
‘But-’
Tonks was already fleeing after Aberforth, going to die with her husband. Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione while Draco elbowed Blaise into action.
He stared at the solid form of Draco grinning at him.
But- He and Harry had bonded, the slightest bit, in that moment at the end of the war that had already been wrecked. He remembered Harry telling him that in that moment of relief at the war being over, seeing the same relief on Draco’s face had meant a lot to him, made it clear how he felt by the end at least. Some people weren’t dead. That was good.
He spun, staring straight at- thought- into? Draco bloody Malfoy.
‘CloneCo?’ They dropped on the couch, facing each other, he couldn’t see the missing ear and didn’t really care enough to work it out.
‘Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen.’
‘I didn’t mean it like that. I mean I don’t think you would anymore. If you had the option …’
Draco shifted closer to Greg, checking his vitals, steady, just unconscious from the spell. Not that either Gryffindor would be nice enough to wake him. Two wandless children, one unconscious, in the middle of a battle? Yeah, that sounded safe. Save them once then done.
Touch one wall, long breath in to the other. Then breathe out. Touch wall. Repeat. He’d learnt this at the start of last year.
He batted them away.
Green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair vanished, blank, empty, dead. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Severus moved no more.
‘Really?’ Both locked on him.
At least that was his best bet.
‘-so, of course we’ve given you our approval-’
Any others? Anyone else he might have known from anywhere? There were those girls in their year weren’t there? Lavender and Padma? No, Parvati and Padma, that was them. Please, in the name of all the Four Founding Fathers, say Parvati and Padma …
‘You mean, apart from to be alive?’ Draco quickly grinned, watching Harry squirm under his gaze before continuing, ‘I don’t know, a pogo stick might be fun … oh, wait … similar issue …’
Remember comments and kudos are love! I grin like a maniac when I get the notifications so if anything in the chapter made you smile then do the same for me! 😊
Malfoy doubled over, making fake retching sounds as Harry settled on the ground, grinning up at him.
He focused on what was meant to come next, anything to not think of Dolohov’s face again. He couldn’t look at Blaise but he knew that he was still at his side as they ran through the corridor’s, back to the Room of Requirement. He froze just around the corner, dragging Blaise behind a tapestry as he heard voices in the corridor, ducking out of the way just as Aberforth ran past them.
Where – in timeline A – he’d never belonged.
Harry didn’t get the chance to respond. Like a wave, the school’s hatred of Slytherin’s seemed to shake them out of their terrified stupor. The entire table of Gryffindor’s stood first, turning their glares to those in green. Following them were the Hufflepuffs, then the Ravenclaws. It was well timed, intimidating, and intense, as though they’d practiced this before. All those eyes set on Pansy he could see her trembling at his side as they began to raise their wands.
It wasn’t completely a lie though. The second his head hit the pillow he fell asleep. It had been so long since he’d had a proper night’s rest and, even though it was where the worst of the war had happened, it was still where he felt safest. He was hopeful of making it through the night without a dream.
‘Hold it, Potter.’ His voice came out more stable than he’d expected, thank Merlin for small mercies.
Like Draco’s torment was just here to entertain him. Merlin that pissed him off.
‘F-Fred…?’ Ron’s voice cracked as he stumbled over the name.
Harry wasn’t coming. All Draco had was the hope that even without his testimony they’d be kind. He was a child, he hadn’t killed directly, he had been threatened … it had to be enough.
He thought of him more than ever, it was just chalked up to daydreaming by his friends. He hadn’t told them.
He twisted his arm to look at it out of habit. He liked the tattoo that covered it, he remembered the week Luna had scribbled it over his skin fondly and knew that emotion was reflected on his face. He didn’t use the Malfoy mask nearly as often anymore.
Christmas Eve and the castle was silent.
Just a few of the people he knew would lose their lives today-
‘What would you do? If you could? I mean … if you had-’
He stopped and took another deep shaky breath. Yes, it would be okay, he could do this. He was about to face some of the worst times of his life, even after living with the noseless bastard, but for Harry he’d be willing to suffer through it twice. He could feel his cautious, wavering resolve begin to build in his stomach strengthening. There was something else he could feel there too, a nauseous twisting feeling that he’d chalked down to the terror at his situation in general but now he concentrated on it maybe that wasn’t all it was…
‘Draco…?’
‘Fine. YouTube. Anyway …’ Apparently from there answering the original question was now the lesser evil. ‘If you really want to get me something for Christmas, why don’t you think of a more interesting room for me?’
Of course, the battle didn’t start through the day. He had hours of walking through Hogwarts, pretending that everything was normal. He managed to get his hands on a pensieve and studied the memories of the day. The things he had to make sure played out the same in order to let Harry win the war. The things he knew about people’s deaths in order to try to stop them. He catalogued all he could, waiting for the battle to being and the end of this stalemate that no one else knew was coming. He was fidgeting and restless all day, ignoring the looks he got from his friends until they were all swept into the Great Hall. Ready for the Battle of Hogwarts to begin.
He managed to push himself off the other body. He didn’t want to leave Greg alone where he was, but he’d made it through okay last time which meant that was the safest place for him this time.
Draco waited a moment, the room was silent, the tunnel was silent. He waited as long as he could make himself until it seemed safe to move. Not that it mattered anyway, Harry had stayed until he was dead. There was nothing he could do for shim now. Maybe there was nothing that ever could have been done.
When they separated, Draco smirked.
"Nothing..." Harry gave him a pointed look. "Okay, I'm just...I'm nervous. I've never...Even though people say that I've...I'm not..."
Harry sat next to his blond partner and waited for him to wake up. He felt a little bad about having to poison his partner but it was a necessary lesson to learn. In his opinion, Malfoy had learned it better than Harry did.
“Whenever you’re ready, my angel.” They held each other, neither one of them wanting to let go. It would hurt them both for them to be apart, but Harry knew that they would push out the other side of it stronger than every.
He came to a little stronger the next time around. He had heard someone calling his name, repeatedly. Desperately? He heard it again, a little clearer now.
"Why you terrible person! I will not lose my shape and I refuse to answer the second as I'm already dirt to society. I'm slightly offended. No, actually I'm really offended."
“I see. I’m not enough entertainment for you?” Draco kept his voice low, even if there was a teasing quality to it. Harry appreciated the effort he went through to try to keep the atmosphere light without being boisterous. That wouldn’t have fit Harry’s mood at all.
Harry sighed, jotted down the address and sent the letter off before packing all of his things into his trunk. It took a bit longer than normal, since he had the urge to pack all of his belongings instead of just what he’d need for this year. He hoped he’d never have to be back, but he kept telling himself it was only because he didn’t know what the Dursley’s would do to his things while he was away.
Once she had thought they were in the clear, his back arched off the bed completely. Whimpers escaped his throat, and tears of pain flooded his face. She caressed his hand, it had seemed to help before, and watched him suffer. Draco put a hand on her shoulder, a gesture of comfort as her tears flowed over her cheeks. She just wished there was something she could do. She hadn’t ever felt this useless. Even with Draco’s transition, she was able to comfort him with her touch.
"So. Harry was telling the truth when he told me you insulted him for being an orphan."
He wasn't a hundred percent that anything would work out in his favor, but hey. He figured that Harry Potter didn't do anything halfway and he wasn't going to let a childhood feud get in his way of having a family. He might even grow to like the git more than he already did. They had trained together and had taken out two of the most dangerous people out there after Voldemort's death.
Whatever his uncle planned on doing, it wasn’t good.
“This is Headmaster Dumbledore’s office, Harry. If you ever want to ask something or if you ever feel like you can’t tell me anything I want you to know that his door is always open. Even more so than mine, since I have classes to teach during the day.” The door opened and out stepped the headmaster dressed head to toe in mistletoe green.
Instead he heard a timid voice ask if they may come in. He looked up through his fringe at the newcomer and was startled to find that it was Draco Malfoy. A very, very different Draco Malfoy.
The first day they didn’t leave the bed. They remained curled up, facing each other, just staring at the other one; memorizing each other. Eventually small endearments started whispering their way through their lips to each other. Soon after, their whispered endearments turned into whispers of what the other wanted for the future.
Draco dropped the letter in shock. Of course he knew what the implications were. He just couldn't believe it. Harry Potter, of all people, wanted to court him.
And that caused him to pay more attention than ever, if simply for curiosity's sake.
Harry’s eyes widened in shock at the feeling. More specifically, widened at being able to feel the feathers with his hand and also the shock of feeling he got from the feathers themselves. I have wings...I have wings and I can feel them...Just that amount of knowledge made him want to succumb to the darkness once more. Draco, upon seeing the panic, rushed to explain a little farther.
“You’re right, it doesn’t make sense. But then what happens?”
"Hello and welcome to-" she cut off as she looked up and saw Draco. "Well, Mr. Malfoy! Such a pleasure! Shauna, go get Damion." The brunette turned and started walking away but stopped when Draco leaned in to whisper to Mary. "Shauna, go get Damion and Shane please. Tell them it's urgent and I won't take no for an answer!" The brunette hurried off, presumably to find the two he had requested.
"What?" A dangerous growl left Harry's throat. "I. Don't. Take. Orders. And. I. Don't. Do. Other. People's. Jobs." Then the idiotic man had the nerve to defy him.
“I’m sorry. You don’t deserve to be treated that way, you know.”
“Yes Ron. You were just saying that you want to study with me more about defence. So what do you want to learn?”
"Yes sir, thank you." Harry covered his smile with a predatory smirk and swooped out of the room so fast he looked like a sexier, deadlier Snape. And he knew it.
They communicated like that until the sun was well over the horizon. Their feelings were getting stronger, despite the distance. That was a good sign, once they had noticed their emotions were suddenly flooded with hope. Maybe it wouldn’t be too terribly difficult after all.
“Why is that?”
“Harry likes the ones with a love story best.” She gave him a suspicious look, followed by a self-satisfied smirk.
Yours Forever,
"All right Mr. Malfoy, you're free to go. Come back in a month." He muttered something that Draco would have sworn was along the lines of 'if you make it that long..."
“Bonnie?” Harry saw a house elf appear at her side. “Would you be a dear and take this to the kitchen? Harry, this is Bonnie. You can call her anytime if you need anything. She particularly likes cooking, so if you think of anything you want just let her know. And Bonnie? This one needs extra care. He hasn’t been fed properly in a few months. I’m sure you can convince him to plump up a bit.” She smiled down at Bonnie, as the elf curtsied.
“I can’t just drop the class in the middle of the year Ron, you know McGonagall would kill me!” Ron’s eyes narrowed and Harry felt like shrinking in fear. Everything in his body was screaming at him to get away from Ron, but he couldn’t move. Rooted to the spot, he tried to talk his way out of it. “She’s so strict with her students, you know that! I’d be in detention for the rest of my life scrubbing cauldrons for Snape if I dropped ancient runes-”
He got up and went to bed without a word.
Harry watched her shoot out directions without really hearing her. He couldn't care less what they were doing, as long as it would fix Draco. After what seemed like forever, he felt his bottom hit a recliner.
"Mmm..." Draco knelt down and picked up a few rocks. He didn't know what he was doing, but he needed to keep his hands busy. And apparently picking up rocks was just the way to do that.
His weight was no longer being supported by his legs and he realized that Severus had put him in his lap as he used to do. His head lay on the man's chest, listening to the calming beat of his heart that many thought nonexistent. He felt like he was cared for, and he knew that he didn't have to hurry to compose himself. Severus learned quickly that he did much better when given time to let it all out at once than a little at a time. So that's what he did.
“Goodness, yes! Draco was incredibly active as a little boy and absolutely loved spending time with his father. I know he can seem cold at times, but he’s much more open at home with family and those that won’t judge him for showing emotions.” Harry could practically see it, Draco playing with his father in the study. The image brought a smile to his face.
“Alright look. I know I’ve been a right prick since you’ve known me. But I can assure you with every ounce of my being, that I have changed. My family has personally taken Harry in, and I’ve come to be able to call him my friend in the last month he’s been around. I’m sure Harry would love to tell you why my family was the way we were at school.” Harry nodded.
He dragged himself upstairs to his room and stripped to his boxers in a sleepy haze. He then promptly fell on top of his sheets and fell asleep.
A few minutes into the ride, Professor McGonagall let herself into their compartment.
His thoughts turned to his newest partner and wondered why Draco Malfoy had wanted to join the aurors. He assumed it was to redeem his name in the Wizarding World, but briefly considered the possibility that he just wanted to get out and do something to maintain his shape since he no longer flew competitively. And then he wondered if it was just to prove to Harry that he wasn't his father. That he was something more than the political backstabber everyone thought he would turn out to be.
When he got to their rooms, he practically ran into the bathroom they shared and collapsed onto the floor. His body was shaking from the force of his tears, and he had no idea how to deal with it. So he just sat there in a ball, curled in upon himself, waiting for it all to stop.
“Son, I wanted to ask you something.” Draco motioned for him to continue. “What do you see for your future?”
Their trip to Platform 9 ¾ was relatively uneventful. They walked to the end of the street and stepped into a fireplace before he was told to tuck his elbows and bend his knees slightly. He did so and after the world spun around insanely quickly with a flash of heat, he found himself looking at what had to be at least a hundred people mulling about around a crimson red steam engine.
“I just liked the bottle.” Indeed, it was a nice bottle. With a twisted neck and a sleek bottom made from a deep green glass it was quite pretty.
He put his head back on his fluffy pillow and drifted off into a doze. It wasn't often he treated himself like this, he always woke up early on so he could help his house elves do simple household chores. Currently he was cleaning out the entire West Wing, which had been neglected and closed off for the past two generations. Not even the elves were allowed to go in there and clean, so Draco had employed the help of the two elves he had kept, having donated the rest to less fortunate families, and was learning how to clean properly. The job was taking forever and he would wake up early in the morning and finish late at night every day. It irritated the elves that was for sure, but their orders were to help him clean at a human pace with minimal magic.
When Draco was sure he wasn’t going to come immediately he started to push all the way in. Harry was groaning his name, taking pleasure in the small twinges of discomfort. He never pulled out, he never stopped and he never changed his deliciously slow pace. Once he was in to the hilt, Harry circled his hips around.
"To make up for all of the horrible things I've said and done to you, I want to take you somewhere after classes today." The juice ended up sprayed all over Draco's pajamas.
They spent the rest of the night discussing when they thought they could move onto the next stage and practicing strengthening their bond over dinner. By the end of it, they both were watching each other with passion etched in their eyes and pheromones flying. It had been so strong that the couple sitting a few seats away from them were now sharing a heated kiss.
"Just put the pizza in the oven." After a few moments of silence, Draco's musings were interrupted.
“Well, that’s about it. From there most people confess their feelings at some point or ask the object of their affections out for a date. It depends on the situations, but that’s when most people decide to either stay out of the romantic territory or if they’re going to jump in and have some fun.”
It was hard to believe that it had been a week already. Harry had taken Narcissa’s advice and took all the potions she provided him with. Bonnie had outdone herself, night after night with feasts aplenty. Harry eventually had to ask her to tone down the extravagance of his meals. He wasn’t hard to please, and always felt guilty that she would pile mountains of food on his plates when he couldn’t stomach most of it.
“Because I’ve fallen in love with you and I didn’t need two bloody years to figure it out.” Draco, at a loss for words, simply kissed him.
It wasn’t until later that afternoon that the contracts had been brought up again.
He then went out to the kitchen to find his partner and was astonished to smell something in the oven. Not as surprisingly, it smelled delicious. His mouth watered.
"But surely you must have...to eat or shower..."
Draco was amazed to find out that Harry really did enjoy shopping. He knew that the other was self conscious, especially when he had to find the smallest size and it still didn't quite fit. He honestly felt bad for him, but as time went on and the boy gained more and more weight he was proud of him.
"Why is the Golden Hero telling me how to cheat the government out of money?"
“What happens if we don’t want to go the full amount of time allotted? I know ours said two years but what happens if we decide we don’t need the full two years?” Harry had to admit, he knew Draco was surprised by what he said, but the hand in his hair never faltered.
~Harry"
"How's training going for your newest partner? Haven't scared him off, have you?"
"Everything will be alright. I didn't mean to scare you like that." The admission confused Harry more than his internal battle he had with himself earlier did.
“Sir?”
“Firstly I just want to make it very clear that marriage contracts aren’t to be taken lightly.” Draco nodded, he knew this already. “And before you can begin courting someone with marriage in mind, you must consult a Seer. They will approve or disapprove of a match.”
The sight scared him so much that he started to cry. He couldn't handle being around someone like him because he knew that this fragile friendship could end up breaking his heart. At least with Severus he knew that the older man would never go out to find another to be with and would, therefore, never leave Harry. Draco, however, could leave him. Anytime he wanted, in fact. And that scared Harry more than he thought could ever happen.
"Harry?" He jumped and turned to look at him.
He worried mainly because he had noticed through their years at Hogwarts the guy had been progressively getting thinner and thinner. No one else had noticed, at least as far as he knew, but it was blatantly obvious to him. He started to notice in second year during their first match against one another. He had known he was thin, but he distinctly remembered him not being that thin in the robes shop before first year.
He needed to get a grip on himself. It didn't matter if Potter noticed he was embarrassed or not. Draco was sure that Harry would have been embarrassed if he was caught in the same situation.
"I...Well I...I just figured that maybe since you were having a baby you'd be upset. I mean, it's going to be hard for you to find a husband isn't it?" As Draco could tell he was extremely nervous, he took pity on him and interrupted his fast-approaching monologue.
Him! Draco Malfoy! The boy who never stood up for himself against his parents. The teenager who always sought the people who were most likely to break him. And a fair few pretty much had. The man who couldn't say no to his father when he was asked to join in on the group who answered to only one master. He was disgusted by himself, and yet Harry Potter, the exact opposite of Draco, wanted to court him.
“An early wedding gift. It’s been in the family for generations but I had it embedded with the strongest magic he could find. It will heat against your skin when people who mean you ill will are near and will cast some very impressive shields if someone sends a curse or jinx towards you. And while he thinks I’m unaware of this, Draco also had a master charmsmith add a crafty piece of magic to ensure that anyone trying to hit you will be thrown several feet from you. As long as you are wearing it, you will be safe.” He watched as Harry opened the gift with unsteady hands, although the shaking had reduced significantly.
He needed to learn not overreact as much.
Harry had loved it when he was finally large enough to fit into the shirt he had wanted so desperately without needing to tie it behind his back. He had run around their private rooms with a huge smile on his face as Draco laughed at his childish antics.
“Students of Hogwarts! It’s my pleasure to welcome you all back. Before we sort the first years into their houses, I would like to take a moment of your time.
"Had to, he was so out of shape."
Sometimes he swore he should just write a bloody book and start making money off of some of the things he’d made up. Believable, but still ridiculous.
"Ah, dropped the act, have we? All right, what say you to the House I recommended all those years ago?"
"That's great hun! When do you leave?"
"SIRIUS! I GOT MISSION X!" Harry ran to the library and grabbed the portrait off the wall.
“Only you can know for sure darling. But it’s worth paying attention to. Promise me you won’t use magic for a few days.” He promised and she left. Draco managed to lift Harry up so they could move to the bed. It was late, and they needed sleep.
He saw Harry looking around with even more confusion evident in his eyes. Draco almost growled-was the boy so deprived at his house during the summers that he really didn't recognize any of this stuff?
"Thirsty." Harry handed him a bottle of water and cracked it open with him watching and handed it over. Draco drank with hesitation at first and then more greedily when he realized that it wasn't tampered with. "Thanks."
“Oh don’t worry dear. This is all about children and how to treat them, which ones will be heir to which fortunes, how many and when. Since you don’t want to be controlled over that, I’m taking the liberty of crossing it all out.”
"Draco, if he'll agree. He seems to be the only person who isn’t enamored by my." Severus nodded and instructed him to make himself comfortable and not to leave the room as he swept out the door. He sat on the couch, right on the edge, but his shoulders weren't stiff either. They were hunched as Harry started reading the book on the coffee table.
"Their eyes might change color within their first year. Although, I don't think hers will change much, his definitely will." Harry nodded.
"The mark." Draco hesitated for only a second before rolling up his sleeve. He heard a sharp intake of breath.
His stomach didn’t so much as rumble anymore. Crawling under his bed to lift up the one floorboard that had some candy in it was the only food he was sure he would get in a single day. Already, he had rationed himself out a little bit, enough to get him to his birthday at least. He just hoped Dumbledore would follow through this time; he would likely starve if he didn’t.
Harry slowly let his wings out, still unsure of the reactions he’d get. Upon receiving not so much as a glance, he relaxed and smiled at Draco. When the waiter brought them their menus, Harry’s heart sank a little.
"You know my life in Little Whinging wasn't all that great right? Well...it was worse than the rumors.
Harry walked outside and motioned to Draco to come out with him. "You ready to run?"
“Well, what was the joke?” Draco made a face. “Oh come off it Dragon! Your father has had to do worse to me just so we could have you, I can handle a simple joke.” At this, Draco’s mouth fell open. She rolled her eyes and waited patiently for him to explain.
It was a picture of him, being held by his parents. His mother looked so kind, so gentle. And his dad looked nothing short of ecstatic to be kissing him on the head. Harry felt his eyes start to tingle and pushed back the tears.
Turns out, Draco wasn’t that bad to study with. Sure his tailored clothes made Harry feel a bit frumpy in comparison but it was nice to know that being put together on the outside didn’t mean you automatically think you know everything.
The next time he woke, Draco seemed fast asleep. He yawned and stretched before getting up without jostling the blond. He had no idea that Draco was watching him-more specifically, that Draco was practically drooling while watching Harry’s arse as he moved.
Narcissa stood and gathered up the remains of the tea and crumpets, please at how few were left.
Narcissa and Lucius had done everything possible to make sure Harry was comfortable. They had even moved Hedwig into his room with him. She seemed to adore the large perch they had placed by the desk and was especially fond of the window always being open and a small pile of treats for her to snack on throughout the day.
“That’s the logical way of thinking. But with purebloods, it’s a bit different. You have to go to a Seer to have the match approved first. Then you draw up a marriage contract, something to entice your desired partner to entertain the idea of you being together seriously. If they decline, then you either have to redraw another contract after a year or you can move on as well. They don’t have to decline, but they don’t have to accept either. Acceptance means you can move forward with the courting without any further hubbub. If they don’t do either, they will present you with a counter proposal. Within it they’ll include what they don’t like about the original contract or they’ll add clauses for the courting period. It doesn’t make much sense, but that’s the way it is.”
Trying was the keyword here, and a few seconds of looking around he saw what was making the portrait laugh. Harry had passed out cold.
He winked, and entered their rooms.
“Well, you tend to end up a bit obsessed for some time. You can yearn to be around someone and you’ll take any way necessary to get there. The whole boys pulling the hair of girls they like came about from that. They’re dealing with crushes and finding ways to be around the subject of their feelings-no matter what. So they use hair pulling as an excuse to be near the one they like. As you age, though, you’re typically less obsessed with how much time you spend together and more concerned with the quality of time you spend together. Petty arguments typically turn to deeper conversations. If you like their personality, then usually it’ll progress but if you don’t like them as a person most of the romantic feelings will fade.”
A moment later, he felt warm arms wrap around him, keeping him warm and holding him to a strong and toned chest. He sighed in contentment, and quickly drifted off into a nightmare-free slumber.
The counter top ran the length of the wall. It had two sinks, a bonus for brushing your teeth. There was even two doors that let to separate toilets in case they both had to go, or had multiple friends over. There was even a huge tub built into the floor just next to the shower.
“But isn’t it just that? A business deal?”
Halfway through their essays, Hermione got up to fetch a few different books and Harry looked at Draco.
A deep pain seared itself through Harry like a knife. It was unlike anything he had experienced before. It tore through his heart, blinding him. He cried out, curling up into himself on the grass with tears flooding his face. He never cried out, his voice was paralyzed with the pain and loneliness he felt.
"I've always wanted to wear the eyeliner and the black clothes. I always wanted to just sit back and do my work and let everyone else alone. Unfortunately with the stress of the entire world on my shoulders, even as a twelve year old boy, I couldn't even focus on class. I'm lucky I passed.
Draco shrugged and gave him an odd look. “It’s less the looks and more of the personality. Blaise is too aggressive when it comes to his opinions, he’s not very understanding if something doesn’t fit into what he thinks is right. He’s not disrespectful about it, but he doesn’t exactly listen to any counter points either. Someone willing to talk, to actually converse about things and someone who can...I dunno...tolerate my flaws without getting impatient. And to be honest, someone a bit shorter than me would be nice. Looking at Blaise is like looking at the top of the Eiffel tower from the base.” Harry burst into laughter, noting that Draco followed. The two helped themselves to the spiked eggnog as they talked about their ideal partners.
“That’s Ulysses. He’ll have a package from my parents, just you wait and see.”
Ron did most of the talking on the way to Hogwarts. He talked incessantly about his family and it seemed to Harry like he resented a lot of his older brothers for always being better than him at everything. Harry, quite annoyed now that the redhead was doing nothing but complaining about his family, was about ready to tell him to stuff it and that he shouldn’t take them all for granted when a bushy haired girl opened the compartment door.
"But anyway, I don't care. I gave up trying to please people. It just doesn't work. So I stopped caring about what was expected of me. Therefore, to me what feels right is what is going to be, if I have any say. And this feels right. Now stop crying, there's nothing to be upset about. You did what you had to do to survive and I forgive you."
“Truly? You want to give us a go at being a couple?”
A little while later, long enough for Harry to start dozing, Draco had started talking to him again. Father says that’s extremely rare that we would share a dream. But it’s a great sign. The message was followed with the image of Harry on the bed from their dream, crying out for Draco with need. It wasn’t long, but it was enough to make Harry squirm and clutch the sheets around him. Do you feel any pain still?
Tears of mirth were running down his face with earnest before he regained composure.
"Sorry. Bad dream." Draco watched as he got up to leave. "Don't worry, I'll be back after I take care of some paperwork at the Ministry. It'll only take me a few minutes. I'll bring breakfast back." He left, leaving Draco to wonder exactly what had just happened to make the other just up and leave after crying in his sleep.
Draco couldn't believe what he had just heard Harry say to him. Did that mean that he wanted a relationship? Or just friendship? Did he just want to be around him because having a baby felt right, or because being with him felt right?
And so they danced.
"Really? Because if you had any clue you wouldn't be saying that."
Instructions were once again given out, and Harry got his potion done in exactly the way Severus had shown him over the summer, which meant he was done about three times faster than the student around him, who were doing it by the book and not taking the shortcuts that were easy enough to figure out if you knew your ingredients.
They arrived at a large set of double doors with ornate designs on them. Draco pushed one open and the two walked into a huge living area complete with fireplace, couch, two armchairs and a large table that had a chess set on it. To the left was a small kitchenette that looked brand new if not totally unused and to the right was two doors. According to the blond one led to the bedroom and the other led to a loo for guests. The bedroom apparently had a different bathroom attached to it.
Neville had been hired to take care of the landscaping, and Harry had laughed for weeks after Narcissa had changed her mind about the flowers she wanted growing outside of the french doors that lead to the patio in the back for the third time in a week. Neville had been so frustrated with her, he started shouting at her to make up her bloody mind before telling him what she wanted because he wasn’t going to be uprooting a single plant after that day.
“So, do you want to talk about it or are you just going to change the subject again?” Harry sighed and resigned himself to the conversation since Draco simply wouldn’t drop it.
At this point, Harry realized his musings were headed down a dangerous path so he committed himself to reciting his life rules:
They were like that for what seemed like forever. It was Harry that drew back to look at Draco first. It was like he was swimming in his eyes, and he never wanted to stop. Suddenly, Draco broke his reverie.
And so Harry launched into his accomplishments and disappointments. He told him everything he could think of and just said what his mind was thinking without monitoring anything. In hindsight, he probably should have at least thought about what he was saying when describing things when he realized what he'd been saying.
She smiled up at her boy, so grown and caring now. She dragged the spare chair next to her, but he sat on the edge of the bed like he had been doing all day. The bed was comfier than the chair.
"It happened to me once." Harry hung his head in shame. He hated the fact that he had failed so spectacularly.
“I’m so relieved. I’m sure you’re full of questions Harry.” He nodded again, more accustomed to the throb the movement caused. She lowered her voice, concern practically dripping from it. “Can you use your voice?”
"What's Mission X?" It was then that Harry realized Malfoy needed a debriefing day. He was a little disappointed at that, but he would only need an hour or two. He knew that if he went out without proper protocol, he'd be sent back to desk work.
Narcissa looked up hopefully. His screams had quieted down to whimpers and faded out altogether. She was hopeful that after two days being unconscious, he was finally starting to wake up. At the beginning, they had summoned a Healer from St. Mungo’s to check Harry out and she had simply stated that he was still in his transitioning phase. She had two likelihoods of what he was becoming, and both of them caused intense fever and a prolonged transition. There was nothing to do but wait.
"All right. The only reason I know I'm gay is because after the last battle and everything, Severus literally tackled me in the hallway. As in, I hit the floor and he fell on top of me. He was so emotional that I saved his life and I was so excited he lived that we ended up kissing." Before Draco could say anything, Harry continued. "You're turn."
He must have spoken out loud, because Draco answered him.
Harry cursed, thankful for the silencing charms on his curtains. This was the third night in a row that he just couldn’t sleep. The first night back was easy; he was so exhausted emotionally from the mass of students demanding his attention and from catching up with friends that he barely hit the pillow before he was asleep. The second, third and now fourth night were absolute torture.
And dear Merlin, hot towels were the absolute best thing in the world after taking a shower. He’d have to remember to charm his towels at Hogwarts.
He sat up when the ringing in his ears went away, and jumped when there was a knock on the door.
“O-okay. In an hour? Do I need to do anything?” Draco smirked at him, but his eyes were soft.
“Well I’m sure my mum did once or twice when I was a baby, but not in my memory can I recall anyone ever wanting to.”
"Elizabeth? Do you wanna talk to Harry now?"
Harry found that he enjoyed Draco’s company for more than just studying. He was bright, always had an opinion on things, had a secret love for snow and genuinely cared about what Harry had to say. It was too bad the holiday was so short lived-he’d love to be able to spend more time around Draco and getting to know him better.
“Well, no one had ever survived the curse he used. Or just...they never survived him until you came along no matter how they died. If he wanted you dead, dead you would be. But you managed to survive. You’re a living oddity-no offence.”
“My, I haven’t seen you smile that way in years. I was beginning to think you didn’t know how to anymore.” Narcissa’s teasing gave him the courage to blurt out what had been on his mind the last few weeks.
"Of course. Where are we going?"
Broad shoulders? He was insane. The only thing that could make Draco Malfoy like another man was...well nothing. He refused to date girls because they didn't do anything for him and awkward situations like that were best avoided. But he would NEVER let himself feel that way towards another guy. No way in hell.
“That’s not entirely true, he just started wearing new robes on the weekends.” Harry looked out the window, preferring to see the sun setting over the Forbidden Forest than to look at Draco.
Taking the broken chandelier as his cue to go to sleep, he put the book on his nightstand and as soon as his head hit the pillow, he was immersed in a peaceful heavy sleep.
Draco, ever polite, said he’d owl Harry during the summer to which Harry vehemently insisted that he not do that. When prodded about it, Harry simply said his family didn’t like owls and wouldn’t appreciate it. To that, Draco asked if he could send an owl once a week in the super early hours of the morning to ensure Harry’s family didn’t know about it and Harry nodded. He could make that work, as long as they kept to their normal schedules.
“Oh good, I was beginning to think you’d stood me up. Grab a basket, will you? They were all gone when I came in.” Harry chuckled and asked the shopkeeper if she had a spare basket he could borrow. After she handed him one, he dumped the sweets in the basket just before another load of things were tossed in.
“Ever since then, Lucius became bitter. He started climbing ranks and doing whatever he could to get as close to Voldemort. His plan was to murder him when he was weak, until he realized what the diary was. He approached Severus about it, knowing how Severus cared for Lily. It was then that he defected and Severus told him everything there was to know. Lucius took house elves with him to destroy the horcruxes, and he managed to get most of them. Do you know what they all were, Harry?”
"Shh it's okay the Healers told me that you might not be able to think too hard about anything as it's likely to cause a headache. You're okay." During the moment of silence, Draco saw everything that had happened in his mind. He suddenly sat up.
It was an emerald green pendant, cut so precisely that you could almost see green tinted rainbows inside it. It was oval and the size of his thumbnail. Yellow gold filigree wrapped around the stone, making intricate little patterns that outlined it perfectly. It was attached to a yellow gold chain. Underneath the white silk wrappings was another note.
In his peripheral, he saw Harry practically melt into a puddle on the floor. They hadn’t put their wings away since arriving at Hogwarts, preferring to leave them out. It was more of a display for the other than for the other students or themselves.
A third finger followed, eliciting more moans and gasps from his angel. Both of their cocks were weeping with the lack of attention. Draco leaned forward and licked the tip of his mate’s dick, relishing in the taste and the beautiful sounds that crawled their way out of Harry’s throat. If Draco wasn’t mistaken, Harry had slipped into parseltongue completely.
"I'm here because I care about you. You're a person with feelings and I'm sorry I ever doubted that." He watched Draco relax slightly, and silently thanked Merlin that he hadn't botched his apology up.
"What made you think of it?"
"Yes." Taking part in the traditions of an ancient, almost forgotten, ritual, Harry kissed the knuckles on each hand and bade him a good night. He then walked into his room and relished in his gleeful thoughts until sleep finally found him.
"Go, I'll only be right here if you need me." He gave Draco a slight nudge, indicating that he should go sit with the Slytherins, and that he'd sit with the Ravenclaws. He was going to enjoy showing them up for once.
Or rather, he made his way down to lunch if the food selections were any indicator.
Draco’s owl came later than usual, not showing up until the moon was much higher in the sky than it normally would be. Harry smiled when it landed on his shoulder to nip affectionately at his hair. He pulled the letter from his leg and read about Draco’s latest argument with his mother over the care of jasmine plants.
Draco, without needing to be told, grabbed a plate and placed a portion on it before passing it to Harry with a slight blush on his cheeks. Realizing he had groaned in quite the obscene way at the flavour, he apologized and took another bite of his oatmeal.
And Harry liked Ron’s company when he was in a good mood. He’d even confessed that his situation with his aunt and uncle was abusive if he didn’t do exactly what they wanted when they wanted it. They’d had a long conversation that day about what is considered abuse and where the lines lay. Uncomfortable that Ron was firmly in the belief that emotional abuse didn’t really count, Harry neglected to tell him about the emotional and mental toll his family had put him through and instead downplayed the severity of their abuse since they didn’t hit him all that much. He learned early on how to please his family to avoid getting unnecessarily hurt.
“I don’t trust anyone now so what’s the difference?”
“Draco, I missed you so much. I can’t imagine ever being without you again. It doesn’t feel right to be without you. I-I love you.” His words were so quiet, even he had a hard time hearing himself. So it was a shock to him when Draco pulled away enough to look at him, happiness radiating from him before placing their lips together.
However, after several failed attempts, he decided to try just one hint. He scowled when it worked effortlessly.
And his pillow was rather nice too. It supported his head and arm in all the right places so he didn’t have any cricks or parts of himself that had gone numb in the night. When he realized it was moving and that the pillow was in fact Draco, Harry couldn’t be bothered to care.
"But-"
"Harry, you cannot simply sit there and not eat! I finally got you to eat a decent meal for a child of seven and you only ate a few bites tonight!"
"Get on the ground and start doing push ups." Harry watched the blond do two pathetic push ups before deciding to intervene. He got down to give Draco the guidelines just like he had the day before. "Fifty push ups. To my hands. Now." He could tell that Draco was about to protest. "NOW!" He felt a little guilty about having to yell, but hey, it got Draco to push himself.
Harry spent more time on the stool than anyone else. The oddly silent hall was eerie in how quiet everyone was, but that was all washed to the back of his mind when the Sorting Hat started talking to him about the pros and cons of Gryffindor versus Slytherin.
“How would you bloody well know if my eyes changed?”
He put the book down on the table and watched as Harry wrinkled his nose in thought.
Maybe he really was a freak.
"I thought you'd like breakfast first." The voice of his companion by the couch startled him out of his astonishment with the presents and he watched as Harry, shirtless Harry, stood up and directed him to the couch to eat. He ate everything that was put in front of him, much to the pleasure of the brunet next to him.
"Nothin' doin' now go get ready." Harry got his travel bag and changed into jeans and a flannel. "Don't forget me!"
“Oi, get off! You’re squishing me!” Draco complied and helped him off the ground before looking over him.
When they arrived at their destination-home-Harry led him in and put their things on the couch before turning to him. Looking into Harry's eyes, Draco saw determination, excitement, and a tiny bit of apprehension? Or maybe fear? Perhaps it was nervousness. He allowed himself only a moment to wonder before he was pulled from his thoughts all-together.
Sitting next to Harry, he joined the conversations around him. Sensing Harry’s annoyance at being left alone, Draco ruffled his feathers.
“Of course not!” With that, Draco leaned in and pressed his lips to Harry’s cheek in a chaste kiss. Harry had a feeling that he wouldn’t be able to wipe the stupid smile off his face for the rest of the day.
“Doesn’t seem like there’s much to squish if I’m being honest.” Mr. Malfoy had levitated the trunk to the foyer and left the two boys with a reminder that breakfast would not be served but they could request tea at any time prior to brunch.
‘Draco,
In the last two weeks, Harry had learned that the owl’s name was Sparticus and was a part of the breeding program that the Malfoy family funded. Draco had the idea a few years ago to breed miniature and pygmy owls when he realized that women enjoyed tiny animals so much more than their full sized counterparts. The idea had made them quite a bit of money, and his mother didn’t mind at all when he requested one.
A yellow canary landed on Draco's shoulder and took off again once it gave him a short little song.
“Oh but I insist you tell me. It must be bothering you something terrible for you to be grinding your teeth at the table.”
"On your back. Let's go!" Draco did it, not wanting to piss Harry off and have to run more. "Now sit up. Do it again." Five minutes later Draco was gasping for breath and couldn't sit up anymore. And besides that, he couldn't get enough air. "Deep breaths. Lay down and breathe for a minute. Okay let's do some more. I'll hold your feet, make it easier to focus your muscle usage. Come on." Apparently I protested without giving conscious consent. "I SAID UP!" I did it and he let my feet go. "Better. Now do as many push-ups as possible."
"You can have a normal life."
“When they start to gather the students to go to the common rooms, grab onto me. We’ll show them just how well we can fly.” Harry giggled and they stood up when Dumbledore dismissed the hall.
“I’m glad you see reason. Although, it will be interesting you walking around with your wings and all. Especially since you’ve learned they’re very sensitive when others touch them.” He leaned back, thinking about his options. “Alright, we’ll go to Diagon Alley if you can learn to retract your wings. The first month or so is supposed to be very difficult for you to master summoning them and putting them away, but once they’re where you want them they should stay put.”
“Cissa, what’s happened? Dumbledore has already admitted to knowing Harry was beaten in recent years, but why the sudden turn of emotion in your voice?” She looked at him, conveying to his mind just what she could smell on the boy. Proof that the uncle was truly a disgusting creature. Lucius’s mouth fell open, and he turned on Dumbledore.
After his long-winded monologue, Harry took a deep breath, noticing that he was slightly panting after his little tirade. He hadn't spoken so much at once in years, and he wasn't used to needing so much oxygen all at once.
Draco’
He found that this man had made him break a lot of personal rules lately.
“What’s the matter, angel?”
“What about them?” Harry’s head lay in Draco’s lap with Draco’s fingers carding through his hair.
Draco had peeled off his clothes slowly, trailing behind every piece with kisses and small nips here and there. He was learning Harry’s body like he was worshipping it-and that’s exactly how Harry felt. He felt worshipped, loved beyond words.
“I’ve brought snacks and tea! Now Harry, I insist you eat at least some of these. You’re a growing man and on top of that, you’ve had a lot happen to you this summer. And be sure you drink every single one of those potions-I’m not above forcing you to take them.” She sat down next to the bed and Draco politely excused himself.
He shuddered as he realized that Harry Potter was someone in great power at the Ministry of Magic.
"Sirius Black is your godfather?"
The homework assignment was given and the page for the practical work written on the board. Harry and Draco were over halfway done with the assignment by the time the class was dismissed.
Deciding against a toad was easy enough but he couldn’t seem to make up his mind between a cat or owl when a quiet hoot and a white feather floated down in front of his face. He looked up and caught sight of a beautiful snowy owl with intelligent eyes. The bird launched from its perch and landed on his shoulder, gently tugging on his hair affectionately.
It let his mind calm down and shut off his stream of conscious thought. He leaned back onto the carpet and closed his eyes so he could no longer see the ceiling. He just let himself be.
He got a cup of Brazilian coffee knowing that he needed something stronger than tea. He knew what his answer would be, and he wasn't sure it was the right decision, but he thought it was the better option.
“You always knew me best. Look,” he stood and transformed into his veela self, letting his wings stretch out beside him.
“When two males are involved in a situation like ours, one of us will be larger than the other. And since I’m taller and my wingspan is larger, I believe that would be me. Besides, you’ve given so much of yourself to others I want to be the one to shower you with gifts and trinkets. I want to take care of you, my angel.” Harry blushed at that admission. No one had ever cared for him before and he was excited to finally be able to let someone else worry about all that for once.
‘I know I don’t have to answer, Potter. But, well, you’re the only person I have to talk to. I may as well talk right?’ He took in a deep breath, it sounded hollow, but there was nothing to hold it in really, still, it seemed to give him strength to continue in Harry’s silence.
In this fucked-up nightmare.
He stumbled off his bed, his feet jarring against the stone floor. Shit. He was used to a bigger bed and the plush carpets that he’d demanded, and Harry had indulgently supplied. He looked around the room. It felt too real, it wasn’t a dream, couldn’t be a dream. Usually, the only real thing was his panic, but he could tell that the pain was there. The cold was there. He was here.
He reluctantly pulled his hand back, opening his eyes and stared into the amused, knowing, emerald eyes in front of him.
Harry stared at him, a grin slowly filling his face.
This wasn’t his life. It couldn’t be his life. He had to get back to what it actually was, which was going to be a hard task when Potter wouldn’t even let him out of the damn house.
Harry slammed the door behind him, leaning back against is as his chest heaved and breath refused to settle. Over the pounding of blood in his ears he heard the soft whimper of the end of that sentence from the other side of the door.
From the look in Draco’s eyes both knew anyway. There was no point in saying it.
He couldn’t actually say that could he?
Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.
Potter’s chest moved slowly, his eyes were steady and sure.
Three weeks left alone in the cell in the depths of the Ministry.
Severus’ additional information on using them was fairly succinct, simply: “Don’t”.
He dropped his arm straight away, letting the loose sleeve of the grey prisoner robe fall back over it. The court took a while to settle down again, but the Minister dragged it back under control, handing it back to the Head Warlock to ask the final question.
He couldn’t keep track of days here. It was a particular type of torture.
‘I mean … she is gorgeous.’ Harry looked to the letter as though that was where she stood in the room, considering what it was a life with her was offering.
Draco cut himself off, looking back down at Harry who was staring at him at this point, waiting for the next sentence. Draco shook his head.
‘I can’t think of anything else you’d be doing. You’re bored, aren’t you? I’m helping.’
Hermione stared around Ron, shovelling food into his mouth, trying to catch Harry’s eye.
His stomach twisted up in knots, but it almost felt exciting knowing he’d get to be a part of this battle on the right side this time.
with it, just not what I go for.’ Draco’s arms fell to his sides with a sigh, that was the first time he’d said that so plainly to anyone, of course it had to come out in a semi-fight.
‘Give you two some time alone too.’ Ron nudged him, nodding towards where Ginny was chatting with a friend, glancing shyly across at him. ‘Just to talk mind you.’
‘Thanks …’
‘It's somewhere here!’ Harry yelled, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. ‘Look for it while I go and help R – ‘
Once he was around the corner, he shrugged off the shoulder of his cloak, staring at the gash, blood trickling down his arm. Worth it for Fred’s life. But fuck that hurt. He couldn’t heal it. He didn’t have a wand, ointment, anything. He was as useless as a bloody muggle in the middle of a wizard war.
‘Yeah, I guess so.’ He smiled slightly to encourage her, but really, he didn’t have an answer.
Draco lunged forwards. He’d heard Percy talk about this moment enough times. Fred’s last words that haunted the whole Weasley family. His arms wrapped around Fred before anyone else had a chance to move, tackling him to the ground as the air exploded.
Eventually he stopped though, it was bound to happen.
He didn’t watch him when he turned away. He didn’t admire the long, strong planes of muscle on his back. He didn’t have the V lines of his hips memorised. He had never wondered how low his pants had to slip to see a tan line. And he certainly didn’t blush when Potter spotted him thinking nothing about all of the above!
‘Well, you do kind of marry into the family-’
‘I’d tell my Father he deserves to be in prison for dragging me into this shit. I’d come out to my family and wouldn’t give a shit if they disowned me for it.’ He was listing them off smoothly, the regrets he’d had from life, he sounded excited to say them out loud. ‘I’d break off my engagement, though it’s kind of a by-product of the above. I’d get my potions Mastery, specialising in healing potions to make up for the damage I’ve done. I’d date a boy. I’d confess-’
Then he was there. Harry Potter, looking much worse for wear and, Merlin, so much thinner, he’d forgotten how bad it had gotten by the end. Their eyes met and Harry offered him a small, uncertain smile of relief. Draco was stunned for a moment; he’d forgotten how his heart raced at that first smile. How much he-
George choked out a shocked laugh, Fred frowned through his amused, if confused, smirk.
Was that too much of a risk? Or did he need the extra help.
‘Take...it...Take...it...’
Harry fell beside him.
‘What?’ He leaned forward, clinging to every word in the conversation.
That was his prompt, he finally let himself scream. It cut through the destruction of the room, the agony in that one note reached them. He saw Harry turn his broom; a reluctant Ron close behind him. Greg was unconscious, clutched at his side as they balanced on the top of the fragile tower of charred desks.
‘So? I'm not killing him, am I?’ yelled Crabbe, throwing off Draco’s restraining arm. ‘But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what's the diff –?’
It opened into a giant, empty room. He couldn’t see to the end of it, but he recognised it. The Room of Lost Things, it was just … empty. He stepped inside, leaving the door open behind him, just in case.
‘Wait, they’ll split up once they get in there, let’s take them on one-by-one.’
‘In that moment you gave me that chance to hold to that code.’
‘You have until midnight.’
‘But he’s younger at a later point in time, so from a second timeline, right? That makes him the Second.’
‘Don't kill him! DON'T KILL HIM!’ Malfoy yelled at Vince and Greg, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second's hesitation was all Harry needed.
Harry hummed non-committedly, letting her home in on Ron for a bit until she got agreement from him and turned back on him.
Really? That’s all you want to share? Why not list all the Death Eaters attacking and outline the Dark Lord’s plan while we’re at it. Proper villain monologuing time. How had he let it go this way the first time?
He’d need to come up with answers. But they could wait. Right now, all he wanted was a hug. Sappy, he’d never admit to it out loud, but he was scared. He needed something familiar, something that was his, someone who cared.
Yeah, that seemed about right.
Magic was blocked there, drained from the skin bit by bit. The womb growing the baby was pure magic. He couldn’t. He just couldn’t. The Potter here might not care, but his Harry did, and the baby was them.
‘Don't listen to him,’ Ron offered.
He gasped in a breath. Lungs burning. It didn’t seem like enough.
Better they not know.
‘It has elf heads on the wall.’ Harry grumbled in complaint, that sounded like Draco wanted him to move there …
‘And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two-faced bastard!’ Ron yelled
Then he had a night in his bed. His plush mattress pressing the perfect amount under his weight. The luxurious brocaded quilt pressing reassuringly against him. The kind of perfect setup that reminded him of home. Reminded him of who he was. Then his actual brain took over thinking again.
Ahhh – that was the catch, wasn’t it?
Severus strode past where Harry was hiding, Voldemort stood up, the light glinting off his serpent-like face.
With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, broken trunks, old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, ‘Descendo!’
‘Sorry Draco, quick summary. The war is over, has been for years. Voldemort lost.’ He yawned through the salient plot points that had controlled Draco’s life. ‘We’re married. You’re just, kind of, visiting the future briefly. Sorry hun’, you’ll just have to cope for a while. ‘kay?’
