He mewls and wants to leave it at that, but he knows Potter will insist on words, so he forces out a “Yes, move.”
With unbearable effort, he pulls out and (biting down too-hard on his lip) manages to shove his throbbing prick back into his boxers and zip up. "Get your robes on," he says, "quickly."
Once the green flames simmer back to amber, Hermione sets Rose down on her play mat on the floor and turns to Ron. "Okay, number one; you're right. I shouldn't leave Rosie with someone who you don't completely trust, even if I do. It's not fair," she says.
Blinking first while he processes the question, he finally laughs through a grimace. “Erm — sure,” he shakes his head, “it was Ginny, obviously. It was just a few days after …” He gestures vaguely. “I was. Erm. Having a hard time, you know. So she was staying over with me most nights.” He feels his face redden and laughs. “She was trying to distract me. Turns out it worked pretty well.”
"Harry's weird like that though, isn't he? He's all sort of ambiguous about Malfoy ever since he almost killed him in sixth year."
“A veritable feast, Harry,” says Neville. Ron shakes his head, as if it will clear it, and shoves Hermione’s feet off his lap so he can inspect Neville’s wares.
Harry blinks. He’d been expecting to hear one of a few Slytherin names. “The fuck?” he says, suddenly morbidly curious. “Tell me.”
He stands and goes to him and puts his arms around Charlie, fingers pressed into his back, nose pressed to his shoulder. Quite a lot of tension leaves him.
Draco doesn’t believe it, but it makes his cock so hard he goes blind with it. “Me,” he demands. “Me first.”
Dominique tilts her pretty blonde head (Merlin, Pansy’s glaringly unsubtle.) “How’d you get stuck in a lift? Couldn’t you just use a spell to get out?”
Harry’s smile slides away and he pushes a hand through his hair. “Maybe I fancy you too, alright? A little bit. I dunno.” He exhales heavily, palms sweating. “I think you’re kind of an annoying brat but you’re also … like, smart. And funny. And I’m really attracted to you, so. I’ve decided I want to see if something could work. Between … you know. Us.”
Draco stops beside it, the dance floor stretched out before them and the L-shaped bar curved around beside. In the dusky, deserted corner, air smelling like night and summer blowing in through the arch, Harry feels a little less like he’s drowning in sound and smell and feel, and a little more like he could form a coherent sentence if he tried hard enough.
"Pretty good, actually," Harry says. "My ex wasn't—" he cuts off, remembering that this is Malfoy, and busies himself with adjusting Rose again to cover his misstep. "It was just Hermione and the Weasleys and my godson Teddy, so it was nice. Rose's first Christmas and all."
There’s something in the way Potter’s looking at him. Draco’ll be fucked before he makes that assumption, though. “I’m out,” he says.
Harry's a better kisser than he was at nineteen, which, yeah, you'd probably hope so, but he's a lot better. Spectacular, even. Familiar and different, and Charlie's hard because Harry's fist is bunched in his shirt, tugging him closer, but also because his mouth is yielding and his tongue soft when it licks into his.
Because he’s determined to make Potter yield, Draco says, “I doubt there’ll be much talking, but thanks.”
”See you,” Harry says when Malfoy gets up. He wishes he wouldn’t leave but doesn’t stop him when he does, because he’s not really sure what the point would be.
"That wasn't so hard," Harry says. He moves both hands in order to unzip Malfoy's flies and tug his trousers down his slim waist, just enough that both hip bones are blissfully exposed and he can see his erection through ... yeah, that's definitely silk. "God," Harry sighs, drifting his fingers along the shape of it, "you're such a fucking ponce. D'you go around hoping this'll happen or is it just silk for silk’s sake every day for you?"
“Generous of you. I only got five for doing that troll in.” Harry’s brain has changed course. Less tight-smooth-want and more lips-soft-smokey-please. Which is equally unhelpful.
Golden apples,” Draco babbles. Harry swipes a thumb over his slit, and Draco ruts desperately into his fist. “
“First of all, don’t get any closer than you just did to insinuating I took advantage of you,” Harry says sharply. “Because I did
Hermione's face softens. "I know. I know that, Harry. And I know how much you and Ron hate it when I talk about sexual health and all that, but you have to know that though it might not be a romantic relationship, it's still a relationship of sorts when it's with someone with yours and Draco's kind of history. You've got to recognise that." She sits down in the chair opposite Harry's. He's looking a bit sulkily into his lap, and she studies his face imploringly. "You know, it was really hard watching you go through all that stuff with Natalie. For a bit, it was just like after the war. It's awful, seeing you like that. But you've done so well to help yourself since then. I just care about you. So much. I don't want to see you do something that will jeopardise that."
“Yeah, you are,” says Harry cheekily, and slides two fingers inside. He’s slightly looser than he was before because he, Harry, had fucked him half an hour ago. And that’s kind of a mindfuck. “Wish I’d known how much this shuts you up, I’d’ve started doing it years ago.”
“Yes,” he says quietly. Not because he believes it, but because Hermione does, and he doesn’t feel like hearing about all the reasons why it’s okay for him to still, five years later, be working through all the leftover trauma. “I don’t hate him, Hermione.”
free to piss off? You're the one who insists on interrupting me anytime I find the tiniest sliver of solitude."
She softened after some coffee, thought, and told Draco what he wanted to hear: "Potter's an idiot, he's a dickhead, birds wouldn't nest in his ratty fucking hair."
Draco bangs a hand on Pansy's desk, which earns him a stern look. "My point exactly. Of course, Potter was far too concerned with being seen and losing some of that glorious moral superiority he so likes to lord over us all. Like he hasn't got his fucking dark sides. Which does remind me, Pansy dearest, of perhaps the most interesting thing I discovered during our little interlude."
Around them, the song has changed to a non-descript, thrumming loop of drums and synths, and the drips at Harry’s hairline tingle with the cool breeze from the arch.
Draco sniffs. "I've always been boring." It's not true, but Potter already knows that. "You've always been interested," he adds.
restaurant, really, Blaise?” Pansy says, frowning a bit as they reach the ground floor and the club’s blacklights turn the white leather of Pansy’s skirt into something blueish and glowing. “Well, I suppose they do have good sushi. By the way,” she says, taking a glowing drink in a skinny glass from a girl carrying a tray whose skin has been painted a shimmery blue that reacts to the blacklights, “how’s this new Roserum selling? Draco,” she hands him the drink, “you
“Of course she did,” says Blaise. “But I want the details from the Hippogriff’s mouth and I've waited long enough, frankly. Tell me, was he actually good at it?”
“It’s the Dioscuri. Sons of Zues. Castor and Polydeuces,” says Draco. “That’s my star sign, you know. And yours is there. Leo, just by Jupiter. The star Regulus is at the tip.”
"The child was quite the recalcitrant, and Potter was able to calm her for me. He asked me how my holidays were, it was magnificently awkward, and then he left," says Draco.
, but that's different. It's about getting off. Ever heard of hate sex? Potter could take out all that Gryffindorian moral outrage on you. In fact," she grins again, "I might be persuaded to pay you a healthy sum of gold to watch that memory a few times."
And Draco is still thinking about Potter when he says ‘no, nope’, as if it will help in any capacity, and jams his finger into the ‘doors, open’ button about fifteen times.
Deciding not to take the bait, Harry says, "Nope, perfect amount." It had been relatively short, actually, which
He doesn’t pull out straight away, instead falling forward onto Draco’s slick chest, listening to the sounds of him breathing and coming down beneath him, lazily mouthing at the salty-pale skin of his shoulder.
Entirely ignoring Justin and Lavender (although the Justin of it is kind of poetic), Harry says, more quietly, “Yeah,
"I should hope so," says Blaise. He walks in front of Pansy and Draco like he wishes he had a cape for them to hold, parting the crowds with little flicks of his wrist. "The fact that you're a stellar fuck and one of my nearest and dearest shan't help you in the slightest if you stock my bars with shitty spirits, my dear."
He finds his mother in the conservatory, with a pot of tea at her elbow. Unlike Father, she still has her wand, and she’s using it now to water a flowering patch of lillies of the valley.
Draco wonders how Harry can be so cavalier about that. The smell of smoke still makes him sick. Once you've had several dozen near death experiences, they probably don't affect you so much, he supposes.
“S’pose she figured I was working. It was nice of you,” he says, and clears his throat, “to come help out. Did she say when she’d be back?”
"Right." Harry pulls his arm back from Ron, more aggressively than he'd meant. And to Hermione: "Just try not to make it a habit."
As if it's news she's a pervert, like she hadn't been demanding thoroughly detailed accounts of his and Blaise's escapades with unabashed relish for
“Perfectly suited then,” says Draco. “You know, if you walked past this wall three times and thought about what you need most, it might give you a haircut that doesn’t make you look seven years old.”
“I read. You should try it,” Draco says. Then looks far too pleased with himself and adds, “once you learn how.”
Malfoy’s frown clears into a purposefully bored expression. He glances over Harry’s shoulder. “Book?”
. Not that it matters," he adds, glancing once at Malfoy's mouth (god, that's a bad idea) and then away, "because even if it
Ron's hair is still in tact when he goes back into the kitchen, Rose now happily suckling on the bottle Harry's holding for her. "How disastrous would it be, d'you think, if I fucked him again? Properly, though, like, just to get it out of my system, right?"
“Then I’m sure we’ll end up fighting again soon,” Harry says. It’s an annoying thing to say, but it’s very Draco. And right now, he’s stupidly endeared by anything that’s
. It’s just. Quite prominent. Not because of size, of course (Draco’s sure that’s all in the drape of Potter’s trousers), but utter temerity.
Draco bristles at that. Honing his Occlumency skills had by no means been an enjoyable experience — nothing with Aunt Bella ever was. It had been effective, though. Pure dread had motivated Draco to practice in his every spare moment. He doesn't like to think what Bellatrix would have done, had she seen the carefully suppressed wants that lived in the recesses of his consciousness. Dragged him before the Dark Lord, almost certainly.
It's a little after ten PM when he Apparates to St Mungo's. He knows Hermione's home and he's relatively sure Malfoy's working.
"Well it isn't easy to get Draco to beg," she says in a low, conspiratorial voice. Harry actually feels lightheaded suddenly. He can't look at Ron or Hermione. "Believe me, I've tried. You must be good. I'm quite good myself — it's an innate thing, don't you think? Either you can dom or you can't."
“I see,” Pansy teases. “So there was foreplay. And with no kissing? That’s interesting.” She leans back in her chair again, utterly fascinated. Clearly Potter had tapped into that part of Draco Pansy had only actually witnessed once (on a very memorable, very treasured occasion) and heard about in spades. Usually he’s not so defensive about it, but it is
Knowing it would be most politic to shift the discussion away from what happened at the end of that tournament, Draco says, “So your saviour complex came in handy for once? That must be very validating.”
Too gone to speak with Potter’s coarse grip on his cock, Draco responds by pressing his one free hand into Harry’s lower back.
he'd decided on him. Because he would do exactly this, act grossed out and make fun of it and remind Harry how stupid the whole thing is, and how much it doesn't matter. Still doesn't explain why it feels unresolved.
, but that actually makes it even more annoying. Bratty Malfoy kind of turns him on. In this context, at least. Shutting him up sounds twice as good, though, which is where Harry gets the idea to snake a hand up to his neck and curl his fingers around it gently. No pressure — just the potential for it. “You know,” Harry says, as if he’s presenting an idea, “if you couldn’t breathe, you also couldn’t talk. Which would be nice.”
It was a tad bourgeois (or at least, it would have been without his tapenade), but Draco still feels slightly defensive when Pansy crinkles her nose. How horrifying. Still, he hasn't the time to fret the possibility of becoming an ally to
"I know Hermione's put you up to this," Harry says bluntly. "She's so fucking freaked out about the whole thing, it's driving me nuts. I mean, look, I get that Natalie was a shit show and you two are eternally worried now, okay? And I get that I don't exactly have a nice past with Malfoy, that none of us do, but I need to figure this out, Ron." His cheeks are warm, his heart pumping a little faster. "Without Hermione taking notes every step of the way, if possible. I just ..." He lets out a deep sigh and presses his palms into his eyes until he sees popping lights. "I can't stop thinking about him."
“You're here at your leisure, gentleman of leisure,” Harry says. Malfoy’s drink is nice and bitter and lemoney and strong. “Speaking of, what the fuck
, but). “Just don’t tell me you fancy Justin Finch-Fletchley like half the school’s female population. For a Hufflepuff he’s a bit of a twit.” Yes, it’s been six years since duelling club with Snape and Lockhart but that doesn’t mean Harry can’t still be salty about the Parseltongue incident. Idiot.
Harry takes Draco’s cock in hand — a quick stroke, “come, pet,” and Draco makes a tragic little sound and releases over his stomach, and his ribs, and his very expensive rug. Which now smells like wine-and-sex too and Harry thinks it’s a definite improvement.
“I’ll raise you something better,” Draco says. Pansy may find the whole thing utterly hilarious by now (not that she ever
Draco smells too good. Too much man and sweat and expensive shampoo. And Harry can’t seem to force himself from the crook of Draco’s neck, laving at the skin below his ear and hearing taught exhales and soft whines in his own.
had chosen not to share with her ... it's insane. Completely fucking inappropriate. And he's got a terrible suspicion Malfoy did it just to be a shit head.

? Fucking ..." He huffs out a frustrated breath. Pushes a hand through his hair. "Look. I was gonna ... come see you. Or something. Now she's making this big fucking thing out of it."
, reminding him of everything he hates about dealing with his public image. Or maybe it's a combination of all that plus the fact that he keeps having to shift in his chair and subtly adjust his cock, which is slowly getting hard under his jeans.
Draco scoffs. His head lolls against the desk, legs bent at the knees, arms laying boneless at his sides. “You exaggerate.”
Malfoy stops rocking. He looks at Harry. His pupils are dilated. Silver thread stitched around black thickets. “Why?”
Malfoy nudges into the space beside Harry. Hm. He’s wearing a pair of grey woolen trousers (if they weren’t so loose, they could have been the ones from his Hogwarts uniform. As it is, Harry can see pointy hip bones and pale abdomen and a slink of golden hair. So.) and a cherry red t-shirt. Which has David Bowie on it. And is very tight. Harry thinks he should probably say something like; do you own any clothes that are actually your size? Ferret bastard? (For good measure.)
"You're a piece of fucking work, Malfoy," says Harry, trying for casual and falling short. He just sounds flustered and irritated and, frankly, obvious, only he hopes that's just to himself. He decides it's because he hasn't slept with anyone in three months and his brain is confusing his elevated emotions (anger, hatred, contempt, all sorts of negative ones) for arousal. An easy mistake. "Here's an idea: move your entitled little pureblood arse and pour it yourself."
But the blonde was already standing, heading towards the boy with the ball. Harry scrambled after him, nearly tripping over the bench he had been sitting on. He stumbled and ran to catch up with him as Draco approached the boy.
"Actually, Professor," Hermione interjected, "It was my idea to find the troll. I thought I could defeat it by myself. Ron and Harry came to my rescue."
No sooner than when Harry was about to intervene, Malfoy reached into the grass and exclaimed, "Look! It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him."
Neither reached out their hand, Hermione giving a curt nod before mumbling a greeting, and Draco returning only a slight smile before they both turned their attention back towards Harry.
Harry sighed hesitantly, and his eyes snagged on a small piece of parchment resting upon his sheets. Hedwig was sitting next to it, preening. He smiled when he saw that Azazel had made his way onto Draco’s bed, delivering his much larger stack of mail.
The Gryffindors were late. Harry stood stiffly next to Draco, unsure about their friendship status at the moment. His gaze slipped as a flash of red stood in contrast to the lush field.
"First in the ingredient stores, sir, but if it weren't there, I would look in the stomach of a goat, sir. Though I would hope that it would be in the ingredient stores, given as it cures most poisons, sir."
Harry looked up as Draco replied to the girl, "We were just going to go outside, Pansy. That's all."
Harry watched as Draco rushed out of the room. He looked around the guest bedroom, noticing how an inch of the carpet looked more expensive than the entire Dursley house. It was strange; Harry thought that Draco would be happier, considering how much money the boy had. He grew up with parents who loved him. He grew up practically using money as scrap paper. The more Harry thought of it, the more he noticed how differently Draco acted once they had left Hogwarts. It must be the magical aura, he decided. Hogwarts was such a magical place; it made everyone happier. A gentle knock pulled Harry from his thoughts, and he looked at the door to see Mrs. Malfoy.
He rolled his eyes, "He's definitely stronger than Dumbledore. He defeated You-Know-Who when he was one!" He huffed, continuing before Pansy could interject, "And sure, the old bloke was scared of Dumbledore, but if Dumbledore could defeat You-Know-Who he would! Therefore, he couldn't. And so!" He crossed his arms, smirking, "Harry James Potter is the most powerful wizard in the world."
Draco opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, a loud, nasally voice filled the room. "Welcome, students, to your first potions class. We will begin with attendance to ensure that every one of you is here, at least physically."
"I didn't say that he did, Harry! I'm just trying to say that something happened on the same day! And I said it was attempted robbery. On Vault 713."
Harry took it, wondering if cold hands ran in the Malfoy family. She quickly exited the room, and Draco immediately harped on Harry with questions.
When the professor began to dismiss the class, Harry jolted out of his seat along with many others, frowning at the sudden feeling of coolness on his right leg.
"You're Harry Potter." The girl squeaked. Of course, he didn't know when he'd ever get used to being unique.
When Harry woke, he found Draco’s bed empty. He sighed, slipping a sweater on as he rushed down the stairs to the common room in hopes of catching up to Draco. Harry caught a glimpse of the boy and called out, ultimately getting ignored as Draco rushed away again. His sudden cold demeanor reminded Harry of the cold weather, and he rushed back to his dorm to put more layers on. As Harry dressed, he heard murmurs of the first Quidditch match of the season, and his heart began to leap. He never really cared for sports, but magic sports? That was something he could get into. He turned to Draco’s bed, yearning to share his excitement with him, but his heart dropped as he stared at the empty bed beside him.
Harry’s jaw clenches and he fights the sense of humiliation with some small modicum of success, only because he
"No, it's pretty much shit," Harry says with half-arsed sarcasm. "But don't worry, there's zero chance of anything happening. He doesn't want anything to do with me."
"It won't last," says George. "You told me not to say anything to him or I would've already. I mean, I know Natalie was kind of a stone cold bitch but I will literally kill Harry if he makes me interact with that little ferret post-Hogwarts. I'm kinda hoping Charlie talked him out of it."
They're in a fucking lift, is the thing. At St Mungo's, where, yes, something's happened to stifle their magic, but it could be resolved at literally any moment and is this
Harry drags himself up, leaving Draco curled on his side on the rug, and goes to the kitchen to get a glass of cold water (no ice, just a Chilling Charm) and some of that French dark chocolate (two pieces per orgasm) Draco likes.
you,” Harry says defensively, stung at being called out. “I said I don’t wanna hurt you. I’m a bit confused at the moment.”
Klaus is currently making his rounds, moving from person to person for pettings and attention not unlike a dog, which Harry has always thought was very funny. He’s on Neville’s lap at the moment looking like a grey loaf of bread with his eyes squinted in pleasure as Neville scratches his neck.
Yesterday, Ron told Harry that he could guess what the secret was, and he’d tell him if he got it right. He also said he never would, and then laughed for about five minutes.
"Same as before," says Harry. He takes one last hit, tosses it in the air, and Vanishes it before it hits the ground. "I still like the Moonraker. Nothing's come out the last two years to rival it. For me, at least," he amends, taking the extra broom from Charlie. "The Harpies are using the new Stratus model, Ginny says she likes it. I've tried it — it's fast, but it's not dynamic enough, know what I mean? You can go as fast as you want, all you're gonna do is pelt yourself into the stands if you can't make a sharp turn at the last second."
Draco looks vaguely amused at Harry's pique, then pushes himself up from the ground. “Rather peckish” he says. And then, while turning for the door on shaky legs, “Do you have any digestives? Chocolate covered ones?”
“It’s freezing cold,” Pansy complains as they start walking, the building already in sight. “I can’t believe you’re making us walk when we could have Apparated directly outside Maison.”
Pansy can't help it — she rolls her eyes. Fuck, if Granger isn't stubborn. She's starting to see what her and Draco might have in common.
All Harry can really do for a few moments is blink. Then he feels blood rush to his face (which he would have hoped might take blood away from other parts of his body where it doesn’t belong at the moment, but of course he’s a highly fucked up individual so maybe it shouldn’t surprise him, really, that his cock is actually harder now that Malfoy’s called him out), and he decides that dying right at this exact moment would definitely be preferable to living.
“Why, thank you.” Draco had rather expected Potter to approach him. He’d been staring at the back of Draco’s head all lesson, which is unfortunate considering the state of his hair. He’d overslept, after yesterday.
She sits as well and refills her own cup. There is a part of her listening for Lucius, in case whatever happened between him and Draco causes him to come looking for a fight. The other part of her drinks in the sight of her son greedily.
“You’d be in a mood too if you were having a Malfoy crisis,” he says drily. “But I’m ... you know. Fine. Trying to make some decisions. Figure some things out.” He looks over at her, says, “I’ve earned a few mistakes, haven't I?”
If Potter keeps pulling on his piercing, Draco’s going to do something awfully embarrassing. Like whine. Or come in his trousers.
the problem, which is why, on Friday afternoon, after nearly a week of angry wanking and snapping at people and drowning in guilt (and, truthfully, just feeling sort of
“I’m sorry this happened to you,” Harry says in a low voice. “Dumbledore knew. He should’ve done something.”
"I called you an idiot. Halfwit. Imbecile." Draco bites into the flesh of his lip when Potter grips harder on his hip. "Do keep up."
It’s not been long since Harry last saw him. Blaise Zabini is the proprietor of one of the only bars on Diagon that isn’t a) stuffy as hell, b) outrageously overcrowded
It's a poor job, but fuck, it'll have to do. He climbs to his feet again and presses two fingers back inside, pleased with the lack of friction. It's saliva and it'll dry out fast, but he wasn't really planning on drawing this out anyway.
He still spent a lot of his time at home, tinkering around in the shed with Dad and holding George's hand where it stuck out from under his duvet for hours and hours on end. But his flat helped.
Dominique pokes her head into Pansy’s office, where she’s sitting with her ankles crossed atop the desk and a nail file in hand.
mind, awfully, not parading it about like a bloody trophy every time you get within five feet of me? You’re offending my virtue.”
Harry indulges him only slightly, teasing him with small, lingering pecks and a hand on Draco's cheek, never letting it develop further. He wants to hear Draco panting again.
Draco takes up his gin and tonic the minute it's set on the table and takes a long, pensive sip. He says, "Yes."
“Oh, right. I could … “ Harry hesitates, thinking through the repercussions of what he wants to offer. There are ... a lot. “I have the invisibility cloak. I could — erm — sneak you into my. Erm. Dorm?”
He doesn’t really believe Malfoy’s an idiot, so his conclusion is that he’s doing this just to be a prat.
of the fault probably lies with Draco. Five years on from Hogwarts they might be but she would have bet a large sum of Galleons that Draco fell seamlessly back into his old habits the moment they were in the same room.
Harry says, "Very funny," but he's grinning as he does. It slides only the tiniest bit when he continues, "Listen, I have news. About your wand."
Draco tilts his head into Pansy’s touch. “He said it wasn’t a hate fuck,” he says, wiggling a little under Blaise’s warm weight. “Why would he say that.”
He knows it’s not because of That, because That happened over the summer holidays (in the room next to Harry, with alarming frequency and volume), and Ron finally stopped smirking about it like a complete twerp months ago.
, like a pleb, instead of letting him go on through to Pansy’s office like the last one did when he brought her chocolate biscuits. He’s tried the same tactic on the new girl, but she doesn’t eat processed sugars. The bitch.
When the Dark Lord arrived, Draco didn't leave his rooms unless summoned. Sometimes Lucius was there too, but he would only look through Draco, never meeting his eye, and when he grabbed him by the shoulder to lead him from the room once they were dismissed his hand was bony and cold, and they wouldn't speak.
Harry sits down at the table, still holding Rose while she sucks her thumb next to his ear, and he watches Malfoy as he goes about making the tea. He'd expected to see him again at some point considering Hermione's his biggest fan now but not just the two of them, and certainly not under these circumstances. Harry wishes fervently he was less attractive.
. It's not as if you're baring your soul to him, darling, you're just having sex. As much as it pains to me believe Potter is ...
“I wouldn’t ask you to,” Harry says. Privately he’s dealing with Malfoy not even bothering to deny it, and the weird way that makes him feel. “All I do know is I like spending time with you. And I wouldn’t want that to stop.”
Malfoy narrows his smokey eyes in a way that says get-that-shit-eating-grin-off-your-face-right-this-minute-you-twerp. When it doesn’t work at all, he sighs, and says, “I shan’t ever live that down.”
Malfoy waves a hand. “I’m not utterly heartless, Potter. And you looked so lonely at the departure of wheels number one and two.”
Harry clenches his jaw again. Turns to the sink, where he starts washing dishes by hand. “Then I guess you’re not getting any wine, are you? Tragic.”
"You know, being up here, I miss taking Astronomy a bit," he says. The sky is cloudless tonight and choked with stars. "Wish I'd paid more attention. I couldn't name one constellation."
“Granger was rather desperate,” Draco says. “And I do so like having people indebted to me. Besides, I’ve no need to primp. I merely thought I might spare both of us the indignity of each other’s company. No mind, if you’re so desperate for me to stay.”
“Harry,” Draco moans when Harry begins to rock them together. Fabric and friction and hot against hot. “Harry.”
Draco, who hadn’t spared much thought to his post-Hogwarts accommodation (he’s no shortage of access to extra bedrooms — half his friends are scions to manors and castles across Europe), is temporarily dumb with disbelief.
"Slightly," Draco corrects. "Slightly above average. And yes, I would say so. He's one of your sort, Pans."
Draco sets his wineglass aside and drops his head onto Harry’s outstretched arm. “Muggles have no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to the stars. Not even Wizards do, really. Centaurs are the only beings that truly understand how to interpret them. Stars reflect the future, not the past or the present, you know?”
, and the Ministry's still the fucking same. "So they have your wand," he confirms in a low voice. "The Ministry."
Yeah, he could definitely get used to this. He likes this squirming, needy Malfoy so much he sinks his finger all the way in to the knuckle and leaves it there unmoving, just to see how close he can bring him to the edge. As an experiment.
“Potter!” she says enthusiastically. He doesn’t know how successful he is suppressing a frown. “Always hoped I’d run into you round here one day, everyone always says you’re here visiting Granger. Heard about that raid you did last week — nasty business, will he be prosecuted?”
"As for the size —" here he sniffs loftily "— I didn't see it, per se. More felt it. And before you ask,
When Harry releases his wrists, he trails a hand down across Draco’s cheek. Draco beckons it to his mouth with a tilt of his head and licks a stripe up the swell of Harry’s palm, letting two fingers between his lips to fuck lazily over his tongue. Slick and slurred around Potter’s fingers, he says, “Good."
It’s not easy for Harry, being physically affectionate, sometimes especially in a platonic sense. Charlie knows that — he also knows Harry
"You, however," says Harry, "don't seem to be doing quite as well. How many more names will you be calling me before you decide to ask for what you want?"
"No. No, I just don't think— it doesn't seem very, fuck no offence mate, but it doesn't seem likely, the way you're talking about him."
“Keep talking, Draco.” Harry kisses Draco’s temple gently. He likes the feeling of the softly buzzed hair on his lips. “I’m listening.”
. The lift with Malfoy had been so rushed and clumsy and he hadn't finished, notably, and Charlie has warm hands and feels familiar when Harry pulls him down on top of him.
a little hard to think without a steady flow of oxygen, but it’s a welcome inhibition. Draco wiggles under the firm grip and prevaricates with a soft grunt.
"Not funny," Draco murmurs, flicking at some lint on his sleeve (Blaise is always returning his things in the most appalling condition) as Granger bustles through the Floo. "Not funny, but sarcastic. Devastatingly witty."
Only Potter would have the duality to do something as evil as bringing Draco to this kind of brink and leaving him wanting, and then be a stupid,
“Yes,” says Draco, rather absently. There’s about fifty different ways he’s confused right now. “I suppose you would.”
Blaise waves his hand. “As long as we don’t go to Maison,” he says. “Their oysters are a fucking disgrace.”
“Sure, me either,” Harry says, rolling his eyes. He sits up a little on his elbow and looks down at Draco, bathed in shimmery, water-filtered moonlight. “Come on. You haven’t even talked to your friends about it, have you.”
"I'm afraid I'd accidentally kill you," says Harry. "We can put a pin in that one. So who was the bloke?"
Draco sips the Roserum, relishing in the wash of syrupy warmth and rose water, the sharp tang of liquor. "Splendid, Pans."
“Please, Pansy,” says Blaise. He clicks at a nearby waiter and waves his empty glass around. “Granger’s an obdurate fucking pain in the arse, do you really think she’ll listen to you?”
Harry looks up from his parchment, and says, “If you tell her, then you have to tell me. Unless it’s more gross sex stuff.”
chance I saw you sitting here. I like looking at it when I can't sleep." He points to the names at the top, Prongs specifically. "That was my dad."
“It’s rude,” Draco says, nipping Potter’s lip the way he’d liked so much last time, “to assume you’ll be doing the fucking.”
Malfoy, and it's not easy — but mostly he feels like an arsehole for acting like Malfoy's the only one with feelings when he knows perfectly well it's not the case. He definitely doesn't know what to
Draco frowns. Harry's leg is pushing between his, and he shifts to accommodate it. "Arrogant fuck," he says.
"What?" says Ron. He wishes he'd had the bollocks to have this conversation when he wasn't so fucking high. "You saw him again?"
Harry scoffs. He left his half finished pint back at the bench where Ron and Hermione abandoned him, so he’s got nothing to do with his hands. “Thanks for that image. Call a cab so I can go outside and jump in front of it, would you?”
“But ... he’s intolerable,” Harry protests, realising even as he does that he’s experiencing jealousy right now. Some completely surreal, completely irrational part of him feels slighted to find out he’s not the first Gryffindor who’s fucked Malfoy. “He filled in for Ron as my Keeper for a while sixth year. He’s the
Pansy looks up and catches his eye, and they share a silent moment of communication. She looks as confused as Blaise feels, and significantly more apprehensive.
, when he’d had a louche, languid wank in the shower on Saturday morning. He was, obviously, thinking about Potter when he decided that it must have been that atrociously mediocre Merlot that made him act like such a shocking flirt.
wasn’t lovely and soft and tender? I’m fairly certain they could’ve puzzled that one out for themselves, even the Weasel. No, for whatever reason, you can't seem to stay away, so you keep inventing these piss-weak causes to come and bother me.
Without his glasses Harry can't see Draco's face well enough to assess his expression, so he keeps his own neutral when he asks, "Do you think so?"
"I see," Charlie says. He's heard all manner of things about Draco Malfoy over the years. The kid sounds like a fucking twerp, and, of course, Charlie knows he was a Death Eater. He also knows he was sixteen when he became one, and he really does try to be understanding about these kinds of things. "Drunk, were you?"
“Dominique,” says Draco. “Sweetheart. I’ve just finished a twelve hour turn, during which I was stuck in a fucking lift for half a fucking hour with a fucking idiot who has a fucking
. He’d like to say turn them over and do it himself, but cry is probably a more accurate assessment. Or beg.
"Bloody bullshit, Harry," Ron scoffs, covering Rosie's pink little ears. "When have you ever been able to shag someone without it getting complicated? And don't say Charlie, because you know that's different. And did I not say no details? Now I'm not going to be able to look at the git without seeing you licking his fucking piercing, or something. Gross. Fucking gross."
— said it’s the first one they’ve ever had at St Mungo’s,” Granger says, in another gallant attempt to redirect the conversation into less slanderous territory.
"There," he says. "I've done it for you. Throw the tantrum next time, Draco, instead of dirtying your wand." He sips at his own. Crosses a leg over his knee. "You do take pleasure in your mother's suffering. You do, or you wouldn't have stayed away so long. I was never such an ungrateful son. I don't know where you get it."
She'd asked, concentrating very hard on not blushing, and as tactfully as she could, whether he'd arranged to see Harry again any time soon. Draco stood up, announced that no, he wouldn't, because he didn't feel that a rough and angry not-even-a-proper-fuck in a stalled lift, following which their only interaction had been a brief and very snippy conversation, constituted a proper courtship, nicked half the packet, and left. Sulking once more.
“Utter tosh,” Draco says, waving his hand and imagining Potter’s little you’re-evil-and-always-will-be comment being battered to pieces. “You pop a fucking stiffy whenever you
It’s just. Malfoy's always been pretty. In a vapid, haughty kind of way, which doesn’t sound like a particularly good thing, but (unfortunately) is. Harry thinks it’s the aura of disdain as much as it’s the full lips and the long eyelashes and the fine bones of his face. Malfoy exudes fuck-off-you-peasant energy that both intimidates and entices.
Ginny takes that as a compliment. “Good thing we broke up. Our offspring at Hogwarts would’ve been the death of McGonagall, I’m sure.”
Still setting his jumper straight, Harry lifts an eyebrow. His stomach suddenly feels weird again. With no anticipatory orgasm to focus on, his brain is free to think of things. Like how he’d told Malfoy he likes him, and they’d fucked, and now that has to be dealt with. “Hoops,” he echoes. “Right. Thought so. Care to expand?”
When the door closes behind him, Harry looks up at Hermione ambivalently from his chair, feeling a lot like he's fourteen and facing McGonagall.
Harry laughs, amused, horny, and rendered exhausted by Draco’s ever-shifting mood. “Yes,” he says. “Are you suggesting I punch you?”
“Fuck you,” Draco mutters, and sits back down in his chair. "We were in the lift together this morning, and it stopped working. Some fucking imbecile brought a Muggle mobile into the hospital under Concealment Charms and it Stifled everything from the third floor up."
Pansy stands with Granger, only to take a few paces and drop back into her desk chair. She Summons her cigarettes from the pocket of her coat across the room. "Floo powder gives me a headache," she says, lighting one and flicking a fluid wrist. "I haven't got one in here."
"I'm not exactly sure. It's just— you know what Harry can be like. He'll think it'll be his fault if he can't fix things between them. He'd see it as giving up, or something, to just end it."
just come to spy on you for Hermione," Harry says, hopping up onto the kitchen table while Ron goes about putting together a bottle for Rose. "I have to ... confess to something, I think."
Lucius watches Draco dip his wand into the whisky and feels an all-too-familiar rage. He know he's doing it on purpose, flaunting his magic, the adult version of sticking one's tongue out. Coupled with the use of his given name, it enrages him so thoroughly that he swipes the tumbler off the end table between them and doesn't flinch as it shatters on the Turkish rug.
Harry thinks it's entirely likely Lucius lost a bit of his sanity in Azkaban but doesn't say so. He just nods, then asks, "What about your mum?"
He takes his cock out finally and huffs out a breath when he gets a hand around it, again using his own spit to ease the slide. It feels completely surreal when he lines up with Malfoy's hole, prodding lightly with the head but not pushing in.
, I only promised to get you your wand back. Which I will still do.” Raising his eyebrows, he adds, “Anything else?”
With Harry rolling his skin between his teeth, Draco laughs in enlivened realisation. He says, "You're entirely transparent."
The thing is, as much as he wants to know, Harry’s rather afraid to ask, lest he be subjected to further detailed description of the sequel to his traumatic stay at the (extremely cramped, and he’s never noticed how thin the walls really are) Burrow.
After he gets the head past the initial muscle (groaning at the way Malfoy squeezes around him), he takes his time sinking the rest of the way inside, savouring every inch as he buries it in all that tight, wet heat. One hand on Malfoy's waist, the other flat across his navel where he can feel the ring digging into his palm, he forces the whole length of it inside before finally pausing to ask, in a much less authoritative voice, "You good?"
it but shit like that still gets to him considering it’s only been Ginny he’s ever done anything with and that relatively recently. All they’d done sixth year was snog.
Draco makes a soft sound (and it’s not a squeak) when Potter pushes a second finger past his rim. Fuck, it burns, and Potter’s fingers are bigger than his own, especially without lube.
Draco drops his voice into a crude imitation of Harry's accent. “I do think yuh fancy me. Idiot. Get your hand back on my cock.”
It's strange to know what Malfoy tastes like. What the skin of his hip, usually covered by clothing, feels like. It's not only Malfoy that's new, either: Harry's never so much as given more than a cursory thought to kissing a bloke, let alone
sorry you’re so bitter I didn’t finish fucking you, truly I am, but I can’t just fuck people on lifts for the whole world to see. I asked you when you were off. You’re so fucking entitled, everything has to be when you want it to be, doesn’t it?”
She almost hadn't gone. First reading the letter had left Hermione absolutely incandescent with indignation and anger, but then she'd remembered she was an adult with a husband and a child and a career and Pansy Parkinson deserved to have zero ability to affect her emotional state these days when she was as happy as she'd ever been and fiercely proud of her life.
Charlie briefly considers fighting him on that, but from what Ron and Ginny said, it’s quite accurate.
“Something’s wrong,” he says. He tries to cast a Patronus to send a message to Hermione and only manages a wisp of smoke. The sudden suppression of his magic — and being trapped with Malfoy in a six-by-six lift — makes him so tense and anxious he can feel sweat starting to bead on the back of his neck. He attempts a wandless Cooling Charm that doesn’t do much more than create a crackle of magic that dissipates quickly. Worrying. Extremely worrying.
“Indeed,” Harry agrees. He pushes some of Draco’s hair off his forehead. “Now unless you fancy sneaking out of here under that cloak while everyone’s awake, we really should go.”
. Potter's inside him and all over him, a hand on his cock and his wrist, mouth collapsed against Draco's own. "Fuck off," he pants, then, "Oh,
“Fuck you,” Draco spits. “Gods, fuck you, Potter. If I tell you to leave me alone will you finally listen?”
“Tell me something first,” Harry says, keeping his grip locked and stepping closer. “If it’s not because I didn’t let us finish then why are you so fucking mad at me?”
He twisted himself out of the grasp of the arms that held him there, his fist met metal, and Draco watched as a pair of round glasses clattered to the floor, shattering. His gaze met, and he stepped back, watching as Harry fell to the floor, grasping his jaw. Draco tripped backward, and then-
Harry was saved from having to come up with something to say as the professor- Professor McGonagall, returned, "Right. They're ready for you in the Great Hall now," She walked through the massive doors into the Great Hall.
Checking in to see if anybody still has interest in this series. Also- any ideas? I know I had a lot planned when I stopped but then I, well, stopped. Now I kinda forgot everything but I’m sure it’ll come back to me.
"Oh, come on, Potter. If that were true, can you imagine what kind of trouble the school would be in? He wouldn't actually let anyone die here." Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry seemed to like the Quidditch match that day, much to Draco's delight. He couldn't exactly remember what the score was and who won- he was too busy thinking.
He clambered towards a broom, settling himself in between Draco and Ron. The broom was worn, with twigs sticking out from strange angles. He grimaced, imagining what it might feel like flying on it.
Draco sighed, physically bothered. His hands were shaking, and Harry didn't think it was from the cold. The color returned to his face, "Do you... with...?"
Harry nodded, trying his best to keep his legs still as he slowly learned about vampires. Harry could swear that his brain was stuttering now.
He sat beside the blonde, smiling at his additional two friends, Pansy and Blaise. At least, he considered them to be friends. They didn't insult or glare at him, at least. He looked up as he heard the sound of flapping wings, eyes snagging on an owl he recognized as Azazel, Draco's owl. The owl dropped two letters, one in front of Draco, and one in front of Harry.
Whispers and murmurs bounced off the walls of the classroom, bringing more and more attention to Harry. He cast his gaze downwards, grabbing some parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink out of his bag. He would focus on his studies. He couldn't get in trouble if he wasn't doing anything. He didn't want to lose house points by existing, but the way things were going, that might happen.
“Hagrid didn’t do anything illegal! I was with him the whole time!” Harry was too angry to notice that Draco knew his birthday.
Once they had reached the fated corridor, they had slowed to a snail pace, their hands still clasped as they waited for their 'most horrible death' that had been promised to them. Nothing happened.
The previous Charms lessons had all lead up to this one, where they would actually be attempting the levitation charm. Harry struggled the first few times, much to his dismay, but he eventually got it. Ron struggled as well, but finally got help from Hermione, much to his dismay.
"What, exactly, were you thinking? An absolutely terrible idea to come up with. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter, I'm afraid-"
Harry beamed, remembering the information from the textbook that he had read the other night, and answered quickly, "A powerful sleeping potion, called, er... the Draught of Living Death, sir."
"I'm not sure what it was, it was just about the size of my hand, and it was the only thing in the vault," He paused, "A really big vault."
Harry could hardly believe what was happening. He went from an ordinary scrawny orphan kid to a famous magical skinny orphan kid overnight. And to think it all started from a letter. He had gotten used to kids avoiding him, wanting nothing to do with him, so when the ginger boy from the large family that had helped him sat in the same train carriage as him, he wasn't too sure what to do. He wasn't even sure what he did; all Harry knew was that he had a friend now: Ron Weasley.
"Oh, look! We're almost to King's Cross!" Draco gestured out the window towards a large group of wizard parents waiting on the platform.
"Hey, Harry-" Ron's loud voice snapped Harry out of his wondrous expedition into the history of Quidditch, "Hey, Hermione. Hey... Malfoy."
Harry's focus was seized away from the ground as Neville Longbottom abruptly spurted into the air like a soda charged with mentos. Gasps reverberated around him as the boy shifted from the broom and fell to the earth.
The air seemed bitterly crisp in the dungeon, despite the water of the lake keeping them humid. Draco sat next to Harry as they did their homework, but Draco found himself distracted for multiple reasons. The first was the fact that Harry's arm kept brushing up against his as he wrote. The second was that his friends-
Harry barely remembered lunch; he was too excited to learn to fly. He walked with Draco to the quidditch field, irritated that Draco decided to be slow now rather than the morning.
"Try being assertive. I think it can tell if you're not entirely sure," Harry suggested, breath hitching when Ron whirled to glare at him.
Draco stuttered for a moment as if he was debating whether or not he should say something before he responded with, "Of course I am. Now, enjoy the feast, Harry."
"Seriously? You're arguing because of your name. Do you realize how daft that is? Who cares what your last name is? Just shut up and get along."
"And you two," She gestured to Ron and Harry, "Despite your terrible idea, you managed to execute it without losing your lives. 5 points to Gryffindor and Slytherin."
And then his face began to hurt. It started at his cheeks, his near-constant grin using face muscles that he'd never used before. And then it flowed upwards, giving him a headache as he choked out laughter. The jokes had slowed by then, and Harry glanced around the hall. His eyes fell on Ron, smiling slightly as he saw the boy having fun. As he turned his gaze towards the front, a sharp, searing pain hit his forehead.
In a flash, potions flew by Harry's ink-splotched parchment filled with notes depicting potion class procedures and even a little eye he managed to draw with his quill. It was very messy, however, almost as if it was bleeding. As enjoyable as the class was, the cold stare drilling into the side of his head gnawed at his heart.
"Troll in the dungeons!" a voice boomed out, and Harry traced it back to an unconscious Professor Quirrell.
She giggled softly, "It's okay, Harry. I told you to make yourself at home; you don't have to be so polite."
"Where does it say that? My father is on the school board and as far as I know, that's never been a rule."
"Actually, we do, sir. Thank you for your time." Draco stood and pocketed a rock cake and rushed Harry out of the cabin.
Draco looked across the hall, a bit confused as it seemed the same as the rest of the hall. When he turned back, the tree suddenly had ornaments on it, and Hagrid was grinning awkwardly.
"Sorry! I've just never been excited about sports before." Harry glanced back at Draco, his emerald eyes full of wonder, causing Draco's lips to twitch into a smile.
“Uh,” Draco looked around, disappointed to find that he had already procrastinated as much as he could, “I could save it for later. Don’t want to be too greedy, yeah?”
Harry woke on Christmas morning with Draco dumping a few packages on him, “No idea how they knew you were here, but here’s your presents.”
Harry watched as the marble was tossed into the air, and everything seemed to go in slow motion. He raced backward, eyes staying focused on the ball as it glistened in the sunlight. He slid across the grass, the blades scratching against his leg. The marble landed in his right hand, much to his surprise. He was never much for sports, or at least he never had a chance to be.
He looked fearfully into his father’s gaze, knowing exactly what was coming. He knew exactly what was happening before it hit him. Before
The first years get their first flying lessons. Draco's acting cold, and when Harry takes a late-night walk he goes to comfort him, leading to a terrifying discovery!
Snape let out a sigh to calm himself down. "Excellent, Potter. Let's hope that everyone else wrote that down."
even as he presses up into it, rubbing his own erection against Charlie's leg. God, it's been forever.
, only Pansy very much enjoys it when she has the time. She sits down again and gestures for Draco to do the same. "I don't know what you mean,
He pushes the sleeves of his shirt up to his elbow and then hangs his head, eyes closed, trying not to pay attention to the sweat beading on his temples.
“A negligible amount,” Draco lies. His legs are tucked rather awkwardly under him, meaning his twitching cock finds a little friction against his thigh.
Pansy had told him. He’d have reamed into Draco about it if Pansy hadn’t made him swear on his cock he wouldn’t say anything.
Draco looks up from Rose, squalling in his arms, when he hears Potter’s voice. At first he thinks he’s hallucinating, that the crying that kicked in about half an hour after Granger left and hasn’t stopped since has actually driven him properly insane. But then Potter steps forward, and sparkling relief fills him, because even though it’s Potter (
while he’s studying at law school, just for fun — that he’s a fucking swot, basically (perhaps even more so than Hermione, though it would send both of them into a strop if he ever voiced this opinion aloud.)
A few of the books he took back with him still smell like salt and Pansy's clementine and grasse tuberrose perfume. Here, he likes to read them at the Black Lake's edge. There are trees that have sprung up since Dumbledore's burial, a copse of Elders that are always rustling gently, even when the air is still. Draco had begun his expedition onto the Lake's shore with caution, half convinced the trees would grow arms and try to drown him, or something, if he got too close. But they didn't, and now he can feel like he's improving his virtue, confronting his failings, while reading, which is far more interesting. Win-win.
Something more than sympathy makes Harry feel a little sick. He knows what it is, too, without even needing to analyse it. It's Narcissa's betrayal as a mother that sickens him.
“Well I’m glad you’re more comfortable now, Seamus,” Harry says, and takes the joint from Ron to his left. “Incidentally so am I. I appreciate you reminding me whenever you get the chance.”
Draco, who's been pulling his jumper over his head and struggling to find the hole, freezes with a mouthful of (very expensive, thanks) wool. "What?"
This is best: Hermione is usually less perceptive when she’s had a couple hits and seeing as he hasn’t told her (or Ron, or anyone) about what happened between himself and Malfoy the other night, that’s a blessing. Because he doesn’t feel like talking about it. Wallowing is much preferable currently.
The snap in her voice gets Draco (of course, she should have known) to snap his jaw shut. She can tell just by the sight of him that he's disheveled emotionally — add to that the fact that he looks physically out of sorts as well and Pansy's curiosity is sufficiently piqued. Enough even to calm her temper, which at this hour is easily stoked.
So it's quite the internal contradiction when he once more ventures out onto the Astronomy Tower. Having been back only two or three times since he first met Potter there, Draco rather misses the quiet, removed stillness that comes with being up a little higher. A sense of more complete alone-ness that feels safe rather than lonely. And, as much as he tells himself he's justified in thinking Potter won't be there, and he's glad for that fact, Draco can't help imaging Harry watching his footsteps mirrored in ink, tracing them with his finger.
“Yeah, s’pose not,” he agrees. “My life's become too easy lately, I thought I’d goad you into a fight or something.”
“Oh,” says Draco. “To be perfectly honest, I forgot you were there. Didn’t you finish last for that challenge?”
A small sigh of relief and she stands up, straightening her dress. “You will stay for Christmas lunch tomorrow, won’t you, Draco?” She hesitates, and then adds, “For me. It would mean so much.”
It's what he's needed, Harry realises suddenly. Something that doesn't take a lot of effort, and feels good but not scary, and intimate without pressure. He accepts the compliment (for that's what it's meant to be, although it's extremely hard for him to take it seriously, because he does not in any universe think of himself as
Harry frowns. He’s not entirely sure what he’d been expecting, but it’s not that. “Yeah,” he says slowly. “Thanks. I’ll keep that in mind.”
Except Draco loses his edge rather quickly, because his spell fizzles just as quickly as Potter's. And now that he thinks about it, and centres himself, he feels rather dim. Stifled. Like someone's holding a pillow down over his magical core.
"Good advice," Harry says flatly. He stands and crosses the corridor to touch the wall hiding the Room, instinct telling him he could walk past it a hundred times and he'd get nothing anymore. It makes him desperately sad. "You never answered my question. Did you try?"
Draco knows he's in for a treat when Lucius sweeps into the study, robes billowing behind him like he's still a man of consequence and renown, striding through the Ministry atrium on his way to bribe another public official, and not some decrepit old bastard magically shackled to his own house for next seventeen years.
"Draco, wouldn't it make more sense if I simply didn't grab my glasses by the glass part?" Harry mused, internally scolding himself for not having considered this before.
Harry turned to Draco, a smile on his face. He watched as Draco folded his letter and pocketed it before smiling back.
The next period was lunch, and Harry put aside the feeling of his gnawing heart and focused on his hunger instead. Sharing jokes and being with friends as they laughed at things besides himself. For once, he was the comedian, not the comedy. He grinned as he helped himself to about two portions of food rather than his usual half. His reference was drilled into his memory as he remembered as he used to stare at his cousin's heaping plate. Harry had dubbed Dudley's regular meal size as four portions, edging on 5.
Harry was a fast reader. He always had been, even when the subjects were dull and boring. He never had much else to do than read in his spare time, and he found the beatings worth it to bring home books from the school library. Dudley never read, so it wasn’t as if Harry could borrow from him. He was never very picky about what books he read. Whatever it was, it occupied his mind and provided some sort of escape from the Dursleys, at least temporarily. Now, the books that Draco was handing him? They were more than just an escape. They were a new world. Harry was actually interested in what the pages described. Draco had to keep reminding him that he wasn’t meant to actually be
What up it's ya boi. I've had no motivation for literally anything for a while. (Seriously, I stopped eating for a while because I just didn't feel like it)
"I was just wondering how you were adjusting? I heard you lived with muggles before you came to Hogwarts."
"I'm off ter the Great Hall," The half-giant cleared his throat, "Have ye seen the Christmas decorations yet?"
Harry blinked his eyes open, a dull throbbing pulsing through the right side of his jaw. All he could see was white, and he panicked. Was this heaven? Was Harry dead?! He blinked once more, little lines once invisible coming into focus. The hospital wing. He lifted his head, immediately dropping it back down onto the pillow. Why was he here? Did he slip in the dungeons again?
Harry sprinted away to tell Draco about the encounter, hoping that maybe his father could get his book back- and also that he knew what Snape was talking about with three heads.
Draco started to get up to continue his argument with the man, and Harry went to stop him before he stopped himself, "Did you see that?"
Draco glowed and waved at Harry as he ran towards the Slytherin table. Harry applauded, cheering for him, but his heart sunk. Ron would be in Gryffindor. He would have to pick.
"So, whatever it was, it was obviously valuable, right?" Draco sat on the edge of his bed, his legs shifting as he processed the news.
Harry's eyelashes fluttered excitedly as they entered the Great Hall. Draco looked around as well, but it seemed rather plain to him. It was brighter than he was used to, sure- and most definitely happier, but not as extravagant as the decor he had at home. If Harry was this excited about these decorations, Draco couldn't wait until Harry saw the ones at home- maybe they could decorate the tree together. He had never done that before- the tree was always expertly placed and decorated, having a sort of unnatural look to it. It looked amazing, of course, but not... homely.
Those words seemed to put all thoughts in Draco's head on hold, "That- I mean, why should I care if you get in trouble?"
Nicholas Flamel was a mysterious name that had slipped out of Hagrid's mouth when Harry and Draco questioned him. They had yet to find anything about the man in any of the books they had read- Harry had planned to look in the library over the break with Ron.
He pushed himself to his feet, the ball steady in his grasp. He walked back towards the group, side-eying Malfoy before going right up to Ron and presenting the ball to him.
"So, it's true then?" A voice snapped him from his thoughts, "Harry Potter is going to Hogwarts this year. It's you, then?"
As he walked down the green-lit hallway of the dungeons, he saw a flash of red. No- it was more than a second; it was a wave. A group of first-year Gryffindors walked towards the potions classroom, and Harry bit his lip nervously.
"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your brooms even, lift a few feet, and then come straight back down by tilting forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --"
"Oh, like I care about your little cat fight. Potter- what is that?" The greasy man reached his hand out for the book in Harry's lap.
“Honestly, Harry. Azazel’s smart enough to not drop it off at the table when I’m not there. Worst case scenario, I’ll get it a day late.”
Snape stiffened, "Yes, of course. Fifteen points to Slytherin for Draco pointing that out, and 10 points to Slytherin for Potter knowing simple trivia."
Harry grumbled as he emerged from the bathroom, turning to find Draco waiting for him outside the entrance. Draco looked up, and Harry smiled. Now his eyes were green, very like the lights of the dungeon they were in.
Draco and Harry's eyes met, wide as they both looked at the source of the sound. Mrs Norris. Harry groaned, this meant that Filch was nearby, and they had to go-- but Mrs Norris was in the way.
Their classes went by in a flash, most likely because they slept through them. Lunch was okay, at least Ron wasn't glaring at him anymore. Harry was excited for their afternoon and scarfed down his meal. Not that it helped- he would still have to wait four hours.
Blaise shook his head, letting out one final snort before explaining, "Honestly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were a faggot."
Draco's cheeks flushed red, the heat radiating slightly onto Harry's skin. A whisper crawled from his throat, "You are...?"
Draco stopped suddenly in front of the doors of the Great Hall, "Flying lessons, Potter. I have to impress."
His housemates didn't know what to do at first. Not one of them had gotten onto the Hogwarts Express, suspecting that the Chosen One would be living in the green-lit dungeon alongside them. However, they soon got used to the mass of untidy black hair and mostly ignored him unless his scar was showing. He looked just like everyone else, for the most part. He was, however, the only one with eyeglasses, which perplexed him quite a bit.
Blaise erupted in laughter, earning him a confused glare from Draco's golden eyes. Pansy smirked next to him.
They were blue at the moment, their color nearly as deep as the ocean under a sunny sky. They always seemed to be changing, though. While he had deep blue eyes now, they could be a brown color in only a couple hours from now. He imagined them to be, at default, this blue color. He had recently woken, and his eyes weren't exposed to any stimuli quite yet, so this had to be their real natural state, right?
A soft knock on the door interrupts him and both Harry and Ron goggle at it while Hermione glares at them.
Harry’s tongue finds his cheek, contemplating Draco and his annoying little pose. “Do you often use sex to distract people from getting to know you?” he asks lightly.
Harry looks at Charlie, hesitating. It feels weird to try and describe Malfoy to someone who's never met him. "Yeah," he says slowly. "But not— he's not
Harry raises his eyebrows. It’s about dead anyway, though, so he says “Sure” and tosses the roach on the ground, stepping on it to put it out.
Harry isn’t sure how he feels about this. Surely, if he really didn’t want to speak to Malfoy, he would’ve gapped the fuck out by now. He’s had ample time.
a few days after its release, of Potter and Weasley pissing on a copy, drunk outside a pub in London.
“I know,” says Draco. Above him, Harry’s hair is tousled beyond salvation, and the swell of new light through the tower windows turns his skin golden and the puckered tissue around his scar shiny-white.
He likes that Draco reads Muggle literature (he didn’t stop trying to pester Harry into reading The Picture of Dorian Gray for fucking
"So?" Harry prompts. A few of their straggling classmates have thrown them glances but he's not really bothered.
"I have plenty of leverage," Harry says darkly. "They know better than to start fighting me like the old Ministry did. That didn't work out well for them."
“You eat it with crostini,” Draco adds, because he knows it’ll make Potter and Weasley roll their eyes.
“One would think,” says Draco, “that someone who enjoys a bit of recreational choking wouldn’t get all flushed over what you’ve just told me.”
"Christmas is not a time to hole yourself away, Draco," Lucius says when he finally finds him in his study with a book. He keeps his best whiskey in here, and he knows Draco's been pilfering it since he showed up. But he'll address that later. For now he takes a seat in another armchair and fills two tumblers instead of one. "You've been back three months. We've hardly seen you."
“He’s perfectly fine.” Draco dips the spoon into his tea, and stirs until a little whirlpool forms. “Now, must we discuss Harry Potter all afternoon? Tell me about your flowers.”
Ron finally takes a pause at that and Harry’s relieved to see it. He can tell Hermione’s becoming genuinely upset and he really dislikes having to step in and talk Ron down.
“Good boy,” Harry says. He’s probably as pleased as Draco is, when he sinks his mouth onto his cock and pushes his finger back in till the knuckle. Well, perhaps not quite, judging by the way Draco cries desperately and squirms down onto his finger, but almost. He does love sucking Draco’s cock. Loves taking him apart and feeling the warm, wet heat of Draco’s arse around his fingers.
“Is that what you think?” he says finally. Lucius gets up from his seat and moves before Draco. He bends, hovering over him, and grabs his chin to force his attention. “My father did what was required of him and so have I.” He grips harder, shakes him slightly. “Your disrespect won’t be tolerated in this house, Draco. Even now. Is that understood?”
Draco keens, winds his arms blindly around Harry’s neck. It doesn’t escape Harry that this is where they started, almost exactly — Draco pressed flush and writhing, the blades of his angular shoulders jabbing at Harry’s chest with every deliberate grind of his hips.
“So am I, and yet I don’t look like I’m perpetually walking perpetually backwards through a perpetual
Fuck, he's an idiot. Twelve hours with blue bollocks and no sleep is clearly starting to take it's toll on him. "Stop
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Potter,” Draco says, and sucks in a mouthful of smoke, and flicks the empty paper end thing off the tower without looking down.
“Oh,” Harry says helplessly, eyes glazing over and head thumping with lust as Draco nips at the pad of his thumb, and then, lips cocked in a ruined smile, sucks a forefinger into the silky heat of his mouth.
.” Harry finds purchase on Draco’s hips, holding tight. Draco tips his head down, forehead sliding against Harry’s and groans. There’s a rustle of skin on fabric, and Draco is fumbling for Harry’s cock in the chink of purple light. He finds it, and strokes, and—
"Harry," Seamus says (Parvati says "Seamus!" but he shushes her), "how many warnings do you get before the Aurors take you away for good?"
Well, shit. Harry blinks at him, feeling that not much could have shocked him more than what Malfoy’s just said. His heart has gone all achey and he’s overcome suddenly with a desire to go over there and hug him because he looks cold and the Warming Charm is starting to fade. And, simultaneously, he feels scared. Nervous. For a lot of reasons, but mainly that he’s only ever been one person’s boyfriend before and he’d known that person well since he was eleven. Malfoy is utterly uncharted territory.
She looks up from the flowers she's watering and thinks, when she sees Draco, that at least she has him this year.
Harry sucks him back down with a chuckle, working another finger in beside the one already stroking at Draco’s prostate.
"Her bottles are all in the refrigerator," she tells Draco, opening it and showing him a top row filled with them. "All you have to do is warm it up. And please don't forget to test it on your wrist before you give it to her. You're
"Darling," she says with a smile. The water stops flowing from her wand and she gestures to the pot of tea on the table. It's then that she notices the red print on his lovely cheek and her stomach goes cold, but she says nothing about it. She'd hoped they might ... but it doesn't matter. "Join me?”
It's weird still, without Fred. It gets easier not to think about him all day and the pain has numbed out a bit, but it's always weird. And Christmas is the worst.
Harry says, “Silk,” into the plane between Draco’s neck and his ear, because that’s what he tastes — warm skin and the closely shorn hair of Draco’s nape.
“Nah,” he says. “Was shagging one of the other handlers for a bit, but nothing serious. You? Since her, I mean.”
“Don’t look,” Ron says quickly, but too late. Harry turns and looks and sees Pansy fucking Parkinson sauntering towards them like some kind of nightmare in back lipstick come to life.
“Fuck you,” Draco says. Then, “You can see the tail just there.” He points towards the serpentine curve up near Polaris. He’s become well-versed in constellations in the last few weeks, even the ones he wasn’t forced to learn as a child during Malfoy-Black family history lessons. They’re an excellent distraction — looking up is far easier than looking down.
Muscles relaxed and nerves still tingling, he shampoos. He soaps. He stands under the water until his skin starts pruning (and his anxieties are back) and then goes to the bedroom to find Klaus curled up contentedly on the bed waiting for him.
“Fascinating, isn’t it?” Pansy says, leaning into Blaise even as she continues grinning at Draco. “Go on, Draco, it’s been
Harry goes even redder and rolls his eyes. "I wouldn't call it recreational quite yet seeing as I've only done it once," he says sardonically. "And I'm not really used to ... I dunno, talking about it? I didn't really spend a lot of time thinking about sex the past few years. How old were you your first time?"
At Dumbledore’s mention, the bile rises in Draco’s throat. He coughs, then waves a dismissive hand. “Of course he was. Though I suppose people might say that about me, too.”
going to fuck Malfoy in this broken lift, but he absolutely wants to see how far Malfoy is willing to go with it.
“What was it you told me about the research grant?” she says. “They decided the concept had some merit, didn’t they?”
Harry’s face is blurry in the mildew-flecked mirror, a smudged thumbprint with glasses and dark hair. Draco turns to look at him. “No,” he says. “She’s in a rather magnificent strop.”
Draco squirms slightly. He really hasn’t taken a minute to ask himself what exactly he’s fucking doing until, hm, right now, which isn’t very Slytherin of him at all.
Draco’s weird. He’s always been weird, since they were kids. There aren’t many Slytherins who are easy to read, necessarily, but Draco’s enigmatic to the point of being an isolationist when he feels like it. Too many times Blaise and Pansy have spent weeks knowing only something is wrong with him, but not what. It was the worst at school, particularly as they got older and sweet old Lucius dug his nails deeper into Draco’s neck, but in Paris things had changed a little. Just a
"What do you mean 'for good'?" he says slowly. "And what do you mean 'warnings,' there are no warnings, Seamus. If the Aurors come, that's your warning."
The cloak is oddly heavy, and more slippery than Draco would have imagined. Almost like liquid metal, more than fabric. It's disorienting to not be able to see his feet, which makes him trip a little on his way through the portrait hole.
“Actually it’s Ron you’ll need to worry about,” Harry sighs. “But he won’t know anything’s going on until I tell him. And by the way,” he adds, “I spoke to Kingsley last week. He's been … it’ll take longer than I wanted it to. It’ll happen, though. I promise.”
Ron tips his head back over the edge of the couch and groans. "I dunno. Christ, I've talked about Malfoy more in the last couple of weeks than I can fucking stand. Can't do it anymore."
Watching carefully as Harry's smile falters, Draco says, without much humour, "Oh? Shall I get on my knees?"
"Don't," Hermione says sharply. "Don't imply I'm doing this as some kind of frivolous way to blow off steam. Excuse me if I think you've had enough of toxic relationships in your lifetime, Harry. Draco said you called him
“Do share,” says Draco. He takes a cigarette from his pocket and a crude little plastic lighter that Blaise bought him after his trial, just to be a cunt.
Draco almost pities Potter’s complete lack of self-awareness. He would, if he weren’t preoccupied with his very deliberate scornful ambivalence. “Please,” he says.
“Relax, Potter,” Malfoy drawls. Harry doesn’t like it when he drawls. Or really does. Either way, it makes his skin feel several measures too tight. “Your virtue is safe with me. We’re just dancing.”
“Just satisfied after a lovely night with my girlfriend. We’ve been expanding our horizons. You see, evidently the Muggles have this incredible thing they call
“Seriously, you’ve made your point,” says Harry. And when Ron gives him a murderous look, “She’s clearly fine, isn’t she? Malfoy’s had plenty of chances to be a prick since he’s been back and he hasn’t. Just leave it alone.”
Draco snorts. "You're completely right, Potter. Telling my closest friend, with whom I share everything — and I do mean everything — is indeed much the same as broadcasting our private affairs to the entire Wizarding public. Bravo, to your persuasive abilities, for you've convinced me of my wrongdoings, and I prostrate myself before you in apology. Twat. I'm going back inside."
"Thank you, dear." She levitates a cup in front of him and fills it with tea, then adds three lumps of sugar and a bit of milk. It's the way he's taken it since he was a child — always a sweet tooth, that one. She smiles fondly to herself as she stirs it and then slides it over to him. "I've taken to gardening as a hobby." She gestures around the conservatory, spacious and open with vines crawling in through artful gaps in the glass ceiling and bursts of colour from strategically-placed flower beds. Sometimes 'hobby' doesn't feel quite the right word.
. But it also wasn't the toxic shit show of an impression you gave Hermione. She thinks I'm—" He breaks off before he loses himself to a rant he doesn't want Malfoy to hear. "Don't fucking talk to her about me.
"I'm not denying anything. I'm saying it's pointless and there's nothing to do about it if he's not interested." He Summons his broom silently, half of him wanting to get the fuck out of here and away from this conversation that snowballed into something he hadn't meant for, the other half wishing they could could skip dinner and stop talking about Malfoy and snog for a while. "We should get back."
.” Draco’s got his stern voice on. Harry likes it, because he likes watching Draco’s cranky resolve slowly crumble under his touch.
Lucius. At all. He spent a lot of time wishing he was. But he's not." Harry shoves his hands in his pockets. "I told him I don't hate him and he said he doesn't know how to talk to me. I don't even know what the hell that means."
have left them all to suffer and die under the autocracy of a lunatic, and Malfoy probably would have been dead or worse by now if he'd taken that route. So yeah, fuck the
Blaise, who is holding up a sheer black shirt in one hand and a pinstriped suit jacket in the other (where the fuck he produced them from is anyone's guess), snorts. "Doing what? If you're not with us, you're working, and today was your day off." He sets down the shirt, and slips the jacket over his bare chest, and smirks. "Unless, did you find another fascinating tome of Revised Brewing Techniques that you just couldn't put down, like the other night?"
Harry groans. He rolls his cock — hard again now — into the soft swell of Draco’s scantily clad arse. “Home,” he breathes. “We’re going home. I’m taking you home.”
"Bit hedonistic, isn't that?" Harry says, grinning broadly now after watching Malfoy dump half the pot of sugar into his tea. "You could just pour the whole thing in, might be easier."
He and Malfoy are alone for approximately five seconds before the lift jolts violently and then stops.
It worked (sort of) until today, when Granger lured him in with Jaffa Cakes, and then asked him about Potter, as if they were fucking boyfriends, or something. He hadn't meant to snap at her like he had, but he supposes the whole thing still kind of rankles. The thought of Potter going around thinking Draco's all torn up over the abrupt way he'd halted proceedings makes him want to crawl out of his fucking skin.
“So what?” Harry fires back, but he’s losing steam. The thing is, he knows she’s got a point, even if he doesn’t like it. But there’s more to it, too. He just doesn’t know how to articulate it. “I’m not trying to have a relationship with him, Hermione. It’s sex. And, by the way, he called
"Sure." The plant nuzzling itself against Malfoy's cheek starts going for his ear again, so Harry reaches out and moves it himself. He just barely pulls his hand back before it starts twining itself around his fingers. "Do you have another lesson after this one?"
Harry tightens his grip on Malfoy’s waist when he bites his lip, and he swallows hard. “I s’pose I’m rude then,” he says. He kisses Malfoy’s jaw, just over his pulse, and then his shoulder. “Turn around.”
“Please! But it’s perfectly fine for you to force me into admitting things I’d never planned to confront, promise me you’ll fix all my problems, get a blowjob out of me and
It takes Harry a second to process and when he does he lifts his head and frowns down at Draco. “I’m
Narcissa sighs at the cold tone she’s met with. Draco had been capable of terrible brattiness when he was a child; he maintained icy silences for impressive spans of time, threw tantrums that made chandeliers fall from ceilings. But this is chillingly different. This is not a child’s tantrum but an adult’s resentment. After a moment, she stands and goes around the table, puts a gentle hand on Draco’s reddened cheek and pulls him against her breast. His hair is as soft as it was when he was a baby. The feel of it causes a tear to slip past her closed lids.
bad. Somehow the image of Charlie fucking Malfoy is significantly better, actually, which makes Harry think again about how fucking weird his life has remained even after dealing with the murderous psychopath. He turns round again and finds Hagrid's hut in the darkness, smoke curling up from the chimney. "It's Hagrid, isn't it," he says, looking at Malfoy. "You fancy Hagrid."
The air in the hall seemed to still as his words settled in. A few moments of silence passed before small chatter continued in the line of children. Neither Ron nor Draco said a word.
When the time had come, Harry was hurrying Draco as he watched him smearing hair gel in. Once he finally emerged from his nest of gel, Harry rushed him out of the dorms.
Harry frowned, going to give it to Draco, but he saw his name written in thin cursive letters on the front. He glanced at Draco, who signed in approval. So this was for him. He tried his best to open it without tearing the envelope it was in and managed to do well until the very last moment. Nevertheless, it was open, and Harry pulled the letter out.
The banquet that evening was colorful and splendid. Harry gorged himself on turkey and pumpkin pasties as the tension between Draco and Blaise tightened across the table. Draco and Harry hadn't spoken of the earlier events, both deeming it too awkward to approach. Questions sat on the tip of Harry's tongue, but he just swallowed them down in favor of ignorance.
The bushy haired girl shoved past them, tears evident on her face. Harry glared at Ron. He didn't see her for the rest of the day but heard whispers of her sobbing in the girls' restroom.
He barely managed to get there in time to watch Draco snatch it from Neville's hand. Harry stood behind him, confused. His eyes flickered to Ron, who looked to be ignoring him rather than glaring at him. He wasn't sure if this was an improvement or not.
Harry glanced at Ron, then trudged up the stairs as gasps scattered throughout the great hall. Professor McGonagall set the hat on his head.
"No reason. Follow me." Draco's hand stretched toward Harry's for a moment before quickly retracting.
"I've no idea why people think Slytherin is the bad house," She remarked, shocking the boy, "If anyone actually bothered to read, they would know that each house produces about the same amount of dark wizards, save Hufflepuff, but it's the fact that Slytherins are so ambitious that they are the most noticed. I hope the stigma ends soon now that you're in Slytherin," Harry tried to interject, but she kept going. "Yes, I know all about you, even though I'm a muggle-born," Harry didn't even know that- "You're in almost all of the history books, though still, nobody knows how exactly you survived Voldemort, I do have a theory about your scar! Would you like to hear it?"
The class flew by, the resulting potion being a lump of grey goo rather than the smooth silver liquid it was meant to be.
Harry picked up the piece of parchment delicately, savouring the rough feeling between his fingertips. He flipped it over, grinning when he saw Hagrid’s messy signature at the bottom of the note.
Draco snorted, "You know they won't do that. The Chosen One needs wizardly training; you aren't the Boy Who Lived with muggles for the rest of your life." He shifted in his seat, "Besides, if they did, I'll tell my father."
Appalled gasps and murmurs ran through the hall. No one had foreseen that The Boy Who Lived would be a Slytherin. Harry glanced at Ron as Professor McGonagall took the hat off of his head. Ron gaped at Harry with disbelief, then glared at him. Harry blundered down the stairs toward the Slytherin table, which was packed with confusion and feeble cheers. Draco waved him over and made room for him, his face full of delight.
Draco's cold fingers wrapped around Harry's wrist as he went to inspect his friend's forehead, "What's wrong, Harry?"
Harry frowned. Draco didn't usually refer to him as his last name unless he was angry. Could Draco be mad at him? Why would he be? Only this morning he had put Harry's glasses on for him.
The boys were on their best behaviour when they were out in public, but their dormmates knew that they were talking all night, earning them quite a few pillows to their heads. Once they had finally gone to sleep, it was time to wake up. Harry looked at Crabbe and Goyle as they got up and glared at him. Why him? Draco was talking just as much...
He looked back one last time, and he swore that he could see a look of concern on the ginger's face before it turned to a scowl. Could he still care?
If I haven't updated in like, a week, please scream at me because this is such a good prompt and I'm gonna be so mad at myself if I don't finish it.
Ron smothered a snicker, and Draco whirled to scowl at him, "Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair and hand-me-down robes, you must be a Weasley," He scoffed.
He moved to seize his glasses, grimacing when a pale hand beat him to it. He gazed at Draco, who smirked, “Every morning you grab them with your sweaty hands, smudge them up, and then spend at least 20 minutes trying to wash them without magic. Honestly, I’m tired of waiting.”
"You do realize that we have Defense Against the Dark Arts before, right? No point in eating so fast." Draco laughed.
Harry giggled before remembering what Ron had said a few days before, "Hey, about your father. Ron said he was a death eater. What does that mean, exactly?"
The next class had great promise, but Harry was disappointed. The teacher for the subject that he had anticipated so much was the same man who shivered when he had seen Harry before. Thankfully, he didn't share this class with the Gryffindors. Unluckily, Harry needed to see the board, so he was forced to wear his glasses. His fool-proof disguise was foiled. Nobody seemed to notice, though. In fact, Quirrell was nervous towards Harry before he had even put his glasses on. Maybe he's scared of black hair?
He hadn't even done anything, yet uncomfortable glances followed him everywhere he went. Whether it was because he was Slytherin, or that the Malfoy name had been tainted- no,
Harry grabbed Draco's hand as he turned to run away from where Filch was heading from. Harry jumped when Peeves, the troublemaking poltergeist, decided to scream to let Filch know where they were. Harry cursed under his breath, jiggling the doorknob of a door. They were stuck in a dead end.
Harry felt his excitement fumble a bit before it descended into the bottomless pit that was his stomach.
”What would a mudblood know about Quidditch?” He muttered, just loud enough for the one in question to hear.
could have better Christmas decorations than his family, right? After all, he was a pureblood family. He was better, right? Right? Though he refused to admit it, the school's feeling seemed more like home than it did at the manor.
"Seems my family approves of our relationship," Draco hesitated for a moment, "Friendship, of course."
He glanced at Draco, whose icy blue eyes glistened in the dim light of the dungeons as he looked at the professor. Draco was different. Draco didn't care about who he was, just about who he is. That was the difference.
Ron rolled his eyes, “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something. I’m with Harry-"
He watched Draco inspect the ball for a few moments before taking it out of Draco's grasp and handing it to Neville, "Malfoy, what are you doing?" He seethed.
Thank you all so much for the kind words and support! Without them I would've never had the motivation to pump out another chapter today
The hall erupted with worry as the professors sought to maintain peace. Dumbledore's voice soon boomed throughout the room, ordering the prefects to lead the students back to their dormitories. The Slytherins protested, as their dorms were in the dungeons where the troll was. Something calmed them down, but Harry didn't hear it. His mind was too busy racing. Hermione had no idea.
Harry frowned, subtly looking at his hands. He didn't believe his fingers to be big, but he had previously only had one pair of hands around his age to compare them to, and Dudley's hands had been an outlier in the data.
Harry couldn't find Draco in the Great Hall during breakfast, and he wondered if Draco hated him for something. He quickly brushed it off, finding that there was no foundation for this theory. Harry grabbed a slice of toast before hurrying out of the Hall, hoping to find Draco.
"Like you could understand, you're just a-" Draco glanced at Harry for a moment, "Erm, you're just a bookworm. To truly understand you need to play the game- not read about it."
Draco sighed, picking the rest of his stuff swiftly as he leads the black-haired boy outside of the classroom, "Do you want everyone to know?"
He felt a gaze linger on him for a moment- Professor Snape. He seemed confused, and as much as Draco didn't want to admit, he was too.
Hagrid frowned, glancing at his bare wrist, "Oh, look at the time! Ye should prolly go and do some 'omework or somethin'!"
"Yeah! See, if you based your knowledge solely on the writings about Quidditch, you'll be biased towards thinking that the chaser is the best position, when really it's the-"
"Shut it, Potter." Draco hissed as the greasy caretaker rounded the corner with a crooked grin plastered across his face.
Mrs. Malfoy stopped in a few times, offering the boys hot chocolate. Harry had refused at first. He was clumsy and near books; He didn’t want to ruin them. Mrs. Malfoy gently reminded him that even if it were possible to damage the books (which were enchanted), a simple spell would fix them up right away. Harry eventually gave in to the kind gesture, and marveled at the fact that the cocoa was burning hot but not damaging his mouth. He then reminded himself that: duh,
