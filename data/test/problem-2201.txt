“You can stay with us tonight,” he says to Teddy. “It’ll be ok; the storm will pass,” he says to the boy who learned to wake whenever there were loud noises outside his cupboard and can only go back to sleep when his bed is full.
out of his voice.
Something about that finally makes the reality of the conversation click into place. He abruptly sits up, a homemade red blanket falling off of him.
It’s familiar. He dreams of this small brown room; its brick walls, curved stone door and faint dripping sound. A dust-covered prelude to ripping, burning skin. His last stay here — three years ago? Four? — had started in the dungeons and ended with Narcissa branding him with the dark mark.
Draco squares his shoulders, thinks about the way Charlie and Bill’s faces looked when they lost and casts.
Fuck.
Something c-c-cold and a-awful.”
. Now, it’s specific; he knows the victims’ coffee orders, and he’s too foggy to even really conceptualize his grief, let alone form an opinion on it. He just feels listless. And guilty, and bitter, and sad. Potter cracked the wall protecting him from his despair and now its slipped out and dissolved into his skin, a coating of emotional sludge making his body heavy.
Harry doesn’t want to think about Draco kissing other boys. Not when he has yet to kiss him.
“It’s 6 a.m. Get a watch. I woke up this morning thinking about how when my father turned 22 he had a wife and a baby and a manor. He had his — and my — entire life planned out, and its all gone the way he’s wanted, more or less. Then I went to the bathroom and washed my hands and looked in the mirror and he was staring right back at me. Do you know how much he’s going to hate it if I cut my hair? If my gay lover cuts my hair?”
“What information do you have that Bellatrix hasn’t tortured out of you already?”
“None,” Luna coos.
“I took care of Teddy for a month while I was staying with Andromeda.”
“This isn’t any of your business!” He says and exits into the living room, the porch, the garden. A path to the barn he’s walked a million times before. Better to think about the Ford’s engine trouble than Pan, or the war, or anything at all.
“I certainly want to know more about this. It’s the first I’m hearing on such matters,” Lupin says. He leans on one hand and drums an anxious pattern on the table with the other.
Potter’s so open and honest, so genuine in his curiosity. Draco considers ten different sarcastic comebacks, but … maybe he should have this conversation. Make an honest effort.
They look just as shell-shocked as Draco feels.
“Yeah, Rowena, Helga, and the new one’s Godric.”
“You shouldn’t have asked him about it. They’re not relevant to anything at all, ever.”
“Thanks.”
There are two possibilities: Pan lied to him and actually cast some sort of tracking charm or curse on him instead of keying him into the wards, and they’re fucked, or the Manor’s in lockdown mode and the wards won’t let anyone in or out, and they’re fucked.
Pan smiles. “When were you born? And where? The astro-orb can show the way the sky looked at the exact time of your birth. I could read it for you.”
He tries again. “The Burrow!” The charmed fire remains indifferent. “Shell Cottage! Hogwarts!” Still nothing.
“I want to kiss you,” Draco says.
Abstractly, it fascinates him. The train has several charms woven into its engine; it’s the prototype for most of Arthur’s inventions, and, by extension, most of Draco’s. Plus, everyone uses it — minus Ron and Potter that one time. It’s concrete proof that, under the right circumstances, wizarding society is willing to embrace magic-mechanical hybrids.
It takes a bit of wriggling — Dean watches with barely concealed amusement — but Draco manages to get his shoe off with only one hand. He kicks the metal tool across the floor to Ollivander. It makes a slight
for it.
, Harry might’ve messed the entire thing up by being so bad at cats.
Draco stabs his roast chicken with a fork. “He never calls on me in class. He won’t look at me. He never comments on my potions. He hates me. It’s fine. I hate him too.”
Draco, after, their bodies two overlapping parenthesis: … ?
He really should redecorate. Especially since, now that his apartment burned down, this room is the only place he has.
“Werewolves gain the ability to transmit the disease at age three, even though they won’t transform until they’re in their teens. That’s
“This isn’t a surprise party,” Percy says.
“Next matter!” Moody bangs his fist on the table once Lupin finishes speaking. The room is silent. One of the duck paintings squawks. “Fine. The Child can speak now.”
Turn the crankshaft; Attach a socket to a long-handled breaker bar; rotate clockwise —
Draco groans.
Ollivander scowls. “No. It’s not about the act itself. It’s about
“Dark.
“My mother is planning a coup,” Draco says.
“I didn’t, until we started camping. Then I needed something to do so I didn’t go crazy with boredom and there aren’t a lot of options since we move around so much.”
Fuck it all. He sucks all the courage he possibly can out of Potter’s skin and drops to his knees in front of the other boy.
“You know, since they’re a spy,” Ginny adds, looking straight at Draco.
“Errrrrr—” Draco’s briefly worried Ron’s going to ask why he and Harry are both … rumpled. “Either of you seen Hermione?”
“If it could wait then I wouldn’t be trying to wade into your pissy group meeting,” Ginny says. Her hand is still clamped around Pan’s wrist.
“Oh my god, how are you guys? Are you alright? Wait, two minutes, ok, what’s the emergency? What do I need to know?”
The very small, shrinking distance between them.
George insisted a second set of eyes authenticate Draco’s trick.
She studies him for a second, two, three.
It’s not what he wants to say. It’s not large enough. But Draco’s eyes soften, and he pulls Harry close. They craft the meaning together: a kiss; a homecoming; a love letter to their past endurance and all the future versions of themselves that are happy and away from here.
Ginny whoops. The group lurches forward across the manor grounds; eight rockets flying through a reverse meteor shower of golds; oranges; greens, meant to kill them. But they’re
“If the temperatures even slightly wrong, a potion won’t brew,” Ginny says. “Also if you add the right ingredient at the wrong time, you’ll brew something dangerous and explosive. I hate potions.”
Granger closes her eyes, breaths in sharply, and continues. “Draco. You seemed to have figured out the Fiendfyre problem.”
“whyD YOU LET HIM DO THAT TO YOU?” Harry bellows over sweaty bodies. Draco’s dancing with Pansy, who is grinding against Luna, who is sandwiched between Susan Bones and Ginny. Inter-house unity, at its finest. McGonagall would be proud the eighth years are getting along. “MALFOY. MALFOY. WHY’D YOU LET HIM DO THAT TO YOU?”
I just want to get the fuck out of here so I can find Fred and George and
“Your existence is the worst thing that has ever happened to me, truly. Just give me yours.”
Wait. Why is he on the couch?
He musters up all the drama and bite he can and leaves the room.
“I can. You can’t; you do it all wrong. When you apologize you make me feel as though
There’s that tender look again, this time crossed with determination. “I suppose I can extend my house call. I work the night shift. As long as you’re home in time for me to catch a few hours of sleep before I have to go back, I’ll look after this little beast for you while you’re gone.”
“But that means they’ll have sex in my bed!”
“I live in a lonely understanding, too,” Harry says.
By the time they actually get there, Harry regrets telling Draco he didn’t realize IKEA was a magical corporation original started by Salazar Slytherin a million times over.
“You’re defecting,” Lucius says. His fury falls away as he steps into the heart of Snape’s secret. “You’re going to betray him.”
“Ah—” Harry starts. “Ahhhhh—”
“I mean — This.” He gestures to the crumbling walls; the smoke, still billowing; the war, in general. “It was all for you. The whole time, I was doing it so I could get back to you.”
“Sounds like you lost him.”
“Of course not,” Lucius says. He spares a glance back at Snape and hoists Draco into his arms. “There’s no need to be. I’m here. I’m always going to be here.”
“I don’t want to give it time.” Ron swallows and sighs wistfully. “I miss her.”
Draco’s ass as he walks away from Harry’s fumbled proposition: .
Seven days later — the day before Christmas Eve; two weeks before Draco has to go back to Hogwarts — Arthur reinforces a piece of cardboard with a protego and places it between them and their experiment. It’s the only safety measure Arthur claims they need.
“This could be a trap to get more information out of us!” Dean sputters.
“You’ll do no such thing.”
“Don’t let me stop you,” they say. “I don’t think theres a single Hogwarts professor who would forgive me if I interrupted the two of you
“Passport, please,” the stewardess says when Draco gets to the front of the departure line.
“I, ah, think it’s in everyone’s best interest if we figure out how to coexist without punching each other.”
Harry puts one foot on the attic floor. “Is this ok? I need to know if it’s ok, or If I should leave you alone.”
“It’s a sad day for Slytherin when
resolving your sexual tension.”
Draco turns around. George grins and mouths
For Draco, no. But for Molly, and Arthur, and the rest? Yes. He can’t face Molly knowing he left three people behind, even if it means he saves the twins. (
Molly hums approvingly. “What you need to do is learn how to make something you love to eat. Spend some time learning how to be with yourself, how to listen to yourself, how to feed yourself, and by the end, you’ll have learned how to love yourself too.”
tw: ruminative thoughts, v mild self harm (same as ch. 6), egregious misuse of coping mechanisms
Harry nods. Disappointed, but not too much. They both want this, which makes it as good as inevitable. One of the things he loves most about Draco is that he does things on his own schedule. Harry never has to worry about pressuring him into something.
And waits and waits and waits. Finally, a hoarse: “I couldn’t fix this if I wanted to.”
“You promised to be respectful!”
Draco laughs, because that’s what Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes is for anyways, and kicks the robotic bird that flies around the shop and yells discount codes at customers. Its wing wiggles around a few meters away from its body.

“Sorry, I know you asked me to warn you, but I’m drunk, and it’s my mother’s funeral. I’m allowed to forget things.” Draco sighs. “I like that you come back. That we come back. Because if you can come back, then that means that she can come back, wherever she is. It means the matter preserves itself. It means —”
The third night, RoHeGo learns how to hold herself upright. His heart whoops and also cries. He leaves to tell Draco.
“Seems we need to renew the registration on the Ford,” Arthur reads off a yellow sheet of paper. “I’ll clear my schedule and go tomorrow afternoon.”
Draco recoils. “He didn’t die for
Right now he just wants to stew in bed.
I make lists in my head before I go to sleep of everything I did that day that could’ve possibly hurt someone. I lose sleep over it. It doesn’t make sense. The whole time, I’m thinking also about how I’m only worried about other people because I just don’t want them to hate me and so really I’m doing it for me and not them which misses the entire point. I’m so selfish and what if people figure it out and it makes them hate me and — ”
“No,” Snape says. “He was killed.” He turns on his heels and walks back into his classroom. “Consider your detention served. Get out of my sight.”
. “What’s one thing you want to do to me?”
, and now Potter is here, dripping rainwater all over the paperwork Draco just finished organizing.
“I do love you!”
“Snape hates me,” Draco says.
Luna sits up and smiles. “Dean. Do you want to help me free us?”
“I, ah, don’t think I’m likely to get another moment alone with you. And … we should talk.”
After Ginny, Katie, Anthony, Susan, Mandy, Hannah, Padma, Marcus, Ginny again, and Anthony again, Harry decides to learn how to make an apple pie.

, open and relaxed in a way he so rarely is. Harry hopes the boat crashes.
Messy black hair, lightning bolt scar, and then the rest of Harry, standing like a confused lighthouse in the middle of Draco’s room.
“Why did you come?” Draco spits at the reception to his ex-lover’s funeral.
Late in the evening, George punctuates his sentence by spilling butterbeer all over Draco, and Draco breaks eye contact with Harry to tune back into the conversation happening next to him.
“It’s a hard spell. It requires a good deal of focus.”
“They’re not here! We need to go!” He grabs the laptop on the desk and shoves it into the coin person with his Swiss Army Wand, latches onto the closest person to him.

It feels like Potter rubs an ice cube over the area. The skin stitches itself back together.
Snape looks him in the eye, “20 points from Slytherin.”
Snape’s hand wraps around Lucius’s wrist. “Narcissa doesn’t like when you sooth him. Stay.”
His question gives Draco enough time to slam the door, hopefully sending a clear message to the crowd inside:
Pan grabs Draco by his tie and pulls him so that their faces are inches from each other. “I am so sick of you. I am so sick of how you stop listening to me whenever I bring up my family. You want to pretend you have no idea what I’m talking about, but your mother is way more volatile than my father is.”
Luna opens one eye as Dean pleads with the wand-maker, closes it as soon as Dean turns back to her.
“You’re not patient enough for potions,” Draco says.
with no possibility of Draco moving out of Harry’s apartment at the end of the month.
“Did you hear the part where I saw Draco cry? Have you seen Draco cry?”
Later, he’d learn Pan hadn’t been trying to get
“Hi Gin,” Potter says from behind Draco. He didn’t even realize Potter was awake.
“Well, would you look at that,” Arthur says. “Would you look at that. Cause for celebration indeed.”
“I brought all the Stupefy Bombs I could find! I think that gives me the right to ask you how you grew up beside a literal fucking quidditch pitch and never used it. I hope you’re ashamed. I’m ashamed for past me that didn’t realize that you —”
“I think they think the twins are making bombs for the Order.”
That doesn’t matter too much right now. He’s filled with joy. Happier than he’s been in a while. Happy enough maybe to …
“Don’t worry. I charmed it so it would only go off if I didn’t tell you I loved you. It’s very advanced level magic. I’m very impressive. You don’t need to worry.” Besides, Harry’s the one in Salem with his N.E.W.T. Defensive Against the Dark Arts class. Draco’s been worried sick even though “all the leftover dark magic was cleared out ages ago,” and, “you have a muggle cell phone, Draco, you know muggles aren’t evil.” Worried. Sick.
“More or less,” Draco says. He almost points out that he burned the Manor down with a fire whip spell, not Fiendfyre. But it seems overly pedantic; he
He trails off, but it doesn’t matter. Draco understands.
“Hello Dragon.” Lucius leans down in front of the small blonde child. “What are you doing here?”
He splits the deck and offers half to Harry, who tentatively places his Ace of Spades on top.
His gut reaction lizard-brain first thought is that the fire is a joke. A Fred-and-George production, even though the heat clogs his throat, melts his skin, scrambles his brain. It feels real. Then, the giggling: childish giggling, apocalyptic giggling, giggling he knows. Draco puts the pieces together and bolts toward Fred’s room.

ghosts. Your house is haunted, right Draco? Lots of people must be buried here."
“Nobody’s going to fall for that,” Draco says. George winks and moves on.
“I’ve been talking to Dumbledore,” Snape breaks in. “About other options. I want you to come with me. I—” Snape averts his eyes and stares at the corner of the wall. “Feel strongly for you.”
“You really don’t beat around the bush. Since you started off with the big guns, I will too. I saved your life.”
"Yes, I can hear them now. Lots of
“I’m a Leo,” Ginny says.
He bolts after her.
“You refuse to acknowledge where you came from. I find that personally offensive as the man who loved the man who died for you.”
“Malfoy Stop!” Potter yells, a ridiculous command when finally Draco is getting to do what he’s wanted to do for years, reach out and hit and touch, and Potter’s skin feels so good against Draco’s fist, and if they stop then Draco will be standing in the ruins of a place he loves. He punches Potter in the stomach.
Harry flicks him off and moves the next day. Draco follows, asks questions about where he’s going and how he can help pitch the tent and no questions that seem remotely like journalism.
Of fucking course the anxiety returns.
“What?”
Ollivander leans forward. “

Then, Potter’s mouth is around him, swallowing the rest of his complaints whole. Draco must have hooked himself into the car’s magic when he was fixing the engine, because he is

There’s another long pause. “I can get you into the Manor. It won’t be through Crabbe, but I can get you into the Manor and that’s all the information I can give you and you’re going to have to be fine with that. Tonight? How’s tonight? Wait, no, not tonight. Let me think. Monday morning at dawn. I’ll make Monday morning at dawn work.”
“That’s our answer. That’s how we jumpstart magic. Kite. Key.” He mimics an explosion with one hand. “

“Wow,” Ron says. “Really?”
“Lily Potter is in trouble,” Snape says into the comforter, barely audible over the rain.
“Ah—” Harry starts. The rest of his sentence seems to be the deep shade of red his ears turn.
“Really?”
Draco pulls Harry into him, kisses him deeply. Thank god for the straightforward language of touch, for meaning unsullied by thought.
Something like that could make Snape cry. He really wants to make Snape cry.

been ransacked or not. There’s lots of takeout boxes, brightly colored wrappers and parts of old projects spread all over the floor. The twins’ combined workspace — two desks with a table setup between them — is covered in odd objects labeled with pink sticky notes. “Not for butts!!!” reads one on an electronic octopus. A sparkly black vile has “Can’t see the fucking lights,” and “Not Bulbadox juice, Draco” and “For butts” all posted on it.
“No. Flowers are for the alcohol cravings. Stars are for —” Harry lets out a deep breath. “Bloody bond is impossible. Stars are for whenever I felt the tug toward you.”
“So does mine,” Pan says. “Moving on. Down here’s the big name stars. Gemini — that’s you again, Draco. Cancer. Leo.”
Potter says to the snake. The secret chamber inside Draco swings open.
“Yes we will. Yes we definitely will. I
“I’ve thought I was gonna die loads of times, and I’ve never kissed anyone over it.”
“Don’t say that,” Draco says. “Don’t say that. She’s not gone. She’s just … somewhere else.”
Words Draco felt but couldn’t say. Words he buried deep inside himself. Third from the bottom; it’s been almost a year, and still, he knows exactly where they are. He feels them, almost thinks them, straightens the deck. He can’t ask Harry to maybe possibly lie to his boss. He’ll figure something else out; he always does.
“CONFRIGO!”
“Bullet for your thoughts?” Harry asks Ron, who immediately stops
Sometime around their 15th anniversary, Harry starts to become obsessed with the back of Draco’s neck. The tiny freckles, pale blonde hairs he can feel but not see, the taste. His favorite thing is to press the pads of his fingers to the plush skin and stroke all the way down the bumps of Draco’s spine, pausing only to savor the hitch in his lover’s breathing when he grazes his ring finger over the dip in Draco’s lower back.

Harry turns the unfamiliar object over. “Where did you get this?”
But when Draco boards the train on the first day of his third year, all he can think about is how much he hates the stained maroon seats, the lackluster metal finishings, the small compartments that don’t lock. The train is crawling with their classmates, none of whom Draco wants to talk to until he absolutely must. How is he supposed to avoid their questioning glances and questioning questions if he can’t prevent them from barging into his compartment?

If it had just been Crabbe, it wouldn’t have been worth it, and it wasn’t just Crabbe, it was a war. You can’t make meaning out of war. The worst thing in their lives will always be bigger than the best thing in their lives, and neither of them wants to think about that. Easier, just, to lie together.
“Ok,” Draco says evenly. He should get an award for keeping all trace of
“PROTEGO,” Potter screams, and Draco is knocked into a shelf full of Whiz-bangs. Sizzle-Boom-Pop. He focuses on the sound of the fireworks, takes deep, deep breaths. His hand is bleeding. His nose hurts. His ear still hurts, too, come to think of it.
“If you would just stop and think for a moment, you would realize that Pan has more than made up for what they did to you. They saved your life, and the twins, and sixth year was a long fucking time ago.” Ginny says. She punctuates each word of

“Do you think Pan lied to us?” Luna asks.
Draco shrugs. “Hermione thought if anyone was going to convince you to come back, it’d be me.”
Draco doesn’t like to think about that connection, usually. It has the unfortunate side effect of making him understand Potter. But right now, all he wants is for Potter to look at him with Green-eyed intensity, and Potter keeps shutting down his normal means of achieving that.

“I should’ve figured it out ages ago. It was literally on the cover of that physics textbook you gave me. I couldn’t sleep, so I was reading it again, and when I finished, I still couldn’t sleep, so I was going to read it again again, but I didn’t have to because it was right there on the cover. You’ve seen it. The bald guy with the beard flying a kite with a key on it. You’ve seen it.”
Draco stares blankly at Potter.
Draco didn’t know Potter was friendly with any muggle children, but also it doesn’t matter. “It doesn’t matter. If you’re married, you can do whatever you want. If you’re not, you can’t. It’s a ridiculous antiquated law that reduces complicated affairs to a fucking yes or no question.”
In the center, an old wooden table Draco has eaten many, many breakfasts at currently inhabited by Ron, crying into a ham sandwich.

“Potter. Please. It’s glowing and golden. It’s the literal stereotype of valuable.”
“I didn’t know you dance.”
Draco’s exhausted, so he sleeps. He wakes up in Potter’s room, on Potter’s bed, wearing one of Potter’s shirts. It had been his only option; his black button-up has Potter’s blood on it now, and oh right, the rest of Draco’s clothing burned up.
The scene plays in his head. A different Draco Malfoy spends sixth year fixing the vanishing cabinet. A desperate Draco Malfoy lets Death Eaters into Hogwarts. A dedicated Draco Malfoy pushes Dumbledore off the Astronomy tower and revels in the completion of Voldemort’s plan.
The wild card here, the actual wild card that isn’t the Joker padding the deck, is that Harry is, indirectly, the reason Draco knows anything about close-up magic. Blaise had stumbled through the floo one night recounting a story Harry had told at Ginny’s birthday party about a street magician in Venice.

Draco stares at Harry, almost tender. “Maybe I could drive you to my place then? I passed my test yesterday.”

“SHUT UP.”
He forces a smile and busies himself folding the red blanket that fell on the floor.

“Well. If Potter really wanted me to stay, he could’ve come here himself.”

His thought process moves laterally from there, settling finally on a horrible, awful, sacrosanct idea. A horrible, awful, sacrosanct idea that — if he can generate enough power — will probably work.
“You’re supposed to be on my side,” Draco says. “Did you forget they’re the reason Bill has scars on his face?”
“Everyone’s fine. Not 100% fine, but alive fine. Ollivander has some serious curse damage, and Luna and Dean are exceedingly underfed, but everyone’s gonna make it through. Of course, we’re all gonna have to hear bad ear puns for the rest of our lives.” She breaks into a wide grin. “I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve been as happy as when the twins got home, and one of them was right before that, when Ron did.”

“Really, the fact that we’re dating should be all the proof you need that they’re worthy of your forgiveness,” Ginny says.

Ron gives a skeptical puff of air and drums his fingers against the table. “Mate, if you know where he is —“
“It’s a long line with a handle.”
As soon as Draco’s within reach, Harry grabs for him, pulling his body close and angling his face toward those pink lips. Draco pulls away. “Not yet. There's something you need to know. This lipstick is laced with polyjuice.”
Ping! He twists around in surprise. A person on a Nimbus 1700 rains lots of small devices Draco recognizes — Draco made — on the Death Eaters.
“I ate the Hufflepuffs,” Luna says, and this time Pansy actually does smile.
Draco writes something down in a small leather book. “I’ve been looking for you for ages. I was hoping I could interview you.”
Then, nothing. Then, Draco, looking almost sheepish.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Lupin says. He offers Draco an unwrapped chocolate bar. Draco’s sitting in a comfy red chair Lupin emptied of books when Draco first got to his office. Lupin’s leaning against his desk, one khaki leg crossed over the other. Draco’s starting to suspect the DADA teacher is incapable of standing up straight.

You know I’ll figure it out; we’ve done this dance before. How about we skip to the part where you tell me what’s wrong so we can both move on with our day?”
“How is it that only your family knows this? Everyone —”
Harry doesn’t think in words the way Draco does. He thinks in symbols and feelings, images and flashes of insight too large for language. More punctuation than vocabulary.
“You’re having a gay wedding,” Draco hisses back.
“I decided to give them to you! It’s my fault!”
Draco crosses to the other side of the room and says to the wall, “Go check the shop. I’ll be up in a moment. I need to … write a letter to Molly and Arthur.”
“I didn’t say I was good at hippogriffs —”

a Leo,” Pan says. “No wonder we’ve been butting heads. I tend to like other Leos, once the power clash stops. We understand each other. We’re upfront about things, no bullshit beating around the bush like Geminis. No offense, Draco.”
“See this?” Draco grabs a pair of tweezers and picks a glowing stringy object off of his desk. “This is a dragon heartstring. It’s worth almost as much as this building. If Death Eaters had come through, they wouldn’t have left it.”
Don’t tell anyone, but it’s the please that does it.
Disaster’s good for tying people together, and Harry desperately wants to be tied to this nervy bastard in a blue speedo. His mind fantasizes: the two of them stuck on a deserted island, stuck on a boat with a tiger, stuck on a small raft with only one paddle. Stuck
And they take to the sky.
It’s all of Draco’s insecurities permanently etched into his skin. Of course it’s private. He’s overcome with … something strong about Potter correctly assessing that and making the conscious decision to look away.
He sighs with his whole body, his head landing in Harry’s lap. “I think I’d like it if you stroked my hair.”
“Hmmmmm,” Luna hums into his palm. Dean smiles timidly, his eyes large and focused only on her. Draco’s irrationally angry that something so nauseatingly sweet is probably going to save them.
It’s a good thing they’re in the middle of a field because he’s yelling. He’s really, truly full-lungs yelling.
“In my defense, I already had the dynamite and you left me alone for two weeks.”
Draco looks into kind green eyes, thinks about how Potter keeps surprising him. It’s like he’s doing a puzzle without a key; he keeps finding pieces that tell him the picture is larger than he thinks it is. He wants to say as much, but there’s something else he has to say first, something painful and jarring that will replace the lovely blush on Potter’s face with anxiety.
“Or he’d trade Fred and George for them.”

“Yeah, well, nobody’d see you and think spy, so maybe we shouldn’t put much stock in first impressions.”
“That's no way to talk to your favorite Cool Uncle.”
“They used the horcruxes as a bargaining chip to get the twins back,” Ron says. He looks at Draco. “Yeah?”
Pan straightens their spine, crosses their arms. “You have the same tattoo I do, so I’d be careful about making things so black and white.”
He slams the hood of the Ford and walks around to the drivers side. Opens the car door and sits on the beige seat, his hand pressed against his face. “Ohhh fuck.”
is what Draco leads them toward, the dip in the Malfoy property line where the wards abruptly end three acres short. (Draco’s Great Uncle Brutus had cheated on his wife with an American mermaid and bargained away half the forest to keep the affair quiet.) The knotty oak with golden leaves; Draco’s favorite climbing tree — that’s where they’re going.
“Didn’t you have something you wanted to show me, Pan?” Draco finally manages to ask. Distraction seems like his best option.
“I don’t care what you do.”
The door swings open, revealing Draco in a purple bathrobe and black pajama bottoms.
“You’re the reason they took the twins. You’re the reason they trashed the shop. If you hadn’t been so fucking careless, if you hadn’t ever come into their lives, if Molly hadn’t taken you in, they would be ok right now.”

They had gone to bed together, woken up together, come one after the other and then gone back to sleep.
“Draco,” Molly says. “Either that blanket did something to offend you or you’ve got something on your mind.”
that’s all his owl had said.
“All Hail Chivalrous Silver!” George raises both hands.
“Would you like me to read to you until the storm passes?”
“That’s not anything concrete,” Granger says.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco says. “I’ll tell you when I figure it out.”
“Oh, honestly,” Draco says, annoyed even though Potter literally just finished healing him. He yanks his arm away and rolls the sleeve back down.

“Me and Dean can power the spell,” Luna says.
“Hold on one minute.” Draco chucks a metal cup at the flap separating Ron and Granger’s room from the rest of the tent.
“Errrrr …”
“I will do unspeakable things to you if you do something like this again.” Draco says. Harry’s wearing green glasses, a green hat and the green robes Luna made him buy so they could dress up as The Forbidden Forest for Halloween.
“We need to talk next steps,” Granger says.

“So? At least then we can go after him directly instead of this going-after-him-without-going-after-him bullshit you’ve been doing. We can kill him, and it’ll be much easier to get rid of the Death Eaters and deconstruct his influence so that when he respawns or reappears or whatever he’ll be less powerful. He was less powerful this time; he’ll be less powerful next time.”
And Potter’s lagging behind the group because most of the Death Eaters are targeting him —
Draco scoffs. “I’m fine, Potter.”

“Malfoy?”
“If you’re going to be petty, I’m going to tell everyone I saw you and Potter kissing,” Pan says. “Oops, I guess I did.”
“I don’t want to get anywhere.”
“Because— Because— you’re being a dick, and you’re being unfair, and I care about justice, and I care about you, and them, and you miss them. I know you do!”
“Granger, he didn’t know.” Draco says. “Ron almost had an aneurism when I asked him to help me because it meant he would have to go behind your back. Did you get that? He didn’t jump at the opportunity to help rescue his brothers because he
“Are you, err, asking me on a date?”
“You’re lying.”
“I’ll keep that in mind next time I want to rough up Potter’s face.”
“Ginny!!!”
Lucius turns around, wild with anger. Draco’s never seen his rage. The moment is charged with Lucius’s fury and actual lightning, but the only emotion that reaches through time to Draco is sadness. There are aspects of his father lost to him forever, shades of his emotional palette Draco will never get to experience in person. It’s not fair.
Mad-Eye Moody — the real Mad-Eye Moody, not the fake one responsible for the ferret-themed Christmas gifts Draco gets each year — hates people under the age of 30 in general and all of the young people fighting on his side specifically. Potter’s right; Mad-Eye will look at the entire situation analytically and determine that rescuing two 20-somethings whose main contribution to the war effort is providing a workspace for Draco to make bombs isn’t worth it.
There’s another crack of thunder. Lucius abruptly stands up. “I need to go to my son.”
“Right,” Lupin says. “I heard about that.”
“Yes, really! And you can’t take that portkey because— because— it’ll wreck him. You're his whole world.”
“I know we’re not friends, but I did save your life that one time, and it’s only an interview. Look. I want to be a journalist, but no respectable outlet will give me the time of day because … I’m sure you can guess why. My career’s on the line here, and really my whole life, because writings the only skill I have. Stop with the silent treatment Potter, it makes you seem holy in a weird way. Did you know there are cults that follow you now? The war made people lose their shit. Would you join a cult? I always thought I wouldn’t, but then I kind of did, so now I spend my nights lying awake thinking about what other cults I might join since I joined that one. I can’t say there’s zero possibility I wouldn’t join a cult that used you as a figurehead.”
“Don’t say it aloud.”
Nothing.
“HE’S COMING,” Fred says. “EVERYONE HIDE.”
“Not as far as I’m aware, no. The war came, and he couldn’t run away from his family anymore. He had to make choices. He had to decide who he wanted to be. He chose wrong.” Lupin pulls the chain out of his collar. There’s a black dog tag on the end inset with several diamonds in the shape of a constellation Draco doesn’t recognize. “The past is never as far away as we want it to be. You think it’s locked in a prison cell, and then it escapes and follows you to your new job.”
“Goodie for you, Potter.” The blonde rolls his eyes, but there’s a smile strung through his sentence. Cushioning his hard consonants, lifting up on Harry’s name. Harry understands what a balloon feels like, suddenly: filled with nothing, yet drifting higher still.
“Yes?”
There’s a large burnt spot where lightning met Earth. Draco’s on one side of it, the charred kite bobbing up and down on his chest.

Harry opens his mouth — to say what, he’s honestly not sure — but Draco cuts him off, suddenly close enough that he doesn’t need to yell. “Of course it’s not.” He presses them shoulder to shoulder, the length of his arm against Harry’s thigh. “I don’t think you actually care,” Draco whispers and licks his earlobe. Harry swears he can feel the snake on Draco’s arm move, though actually it might just be his body’s reaction to the hand stroking his leg. Oh god.

Draco’s sitting beside one in the living room, drinking a glass of wine. He’s given Doll Harry a glass of wine too, because of course he has.
Draco’s angsty teen rebel phase starts in earnest when he turns 22.
“Oh,” Potter takes a tentative step closer. “Well, I liked it. I’d like to do it again.”
“Oh my god, Draco, be reasonable,” Ginny says. She tries to block his path out of the kitchen, but he pushes past her.
“I don’t know. It’s not as though I want to be someone specific. I didn’t even really know I wanted to be someone else until right now, when you were

“Finish that sentence,” Snape drawls, “And I will take 1000 points and give you detention every day for the rest of the school year. I will tell Dumbledore that you stole valuable potions ingredients from me and have you expelled.”
“Suppose that’s it for talking about next moves then,” Draco says. He tries to think about Ron and Granger’s next train wreck of a conversation instead of how he’s alone with Harry and that
“Ohhhh much better, thank you for asking.” She grabs his hands and holds one against her cheek. “I’ve always thought you had such beautiful hands.”
Over the fading sounds of spellfire, Draco hears, “I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU NEVER PLAYED QUIDDITCH BEFORE YOU MOVED IN WITH US.”
A silver fox jumps from the end of his wand.

It’s probably Arthur, come to bring him whatever’s left of Moody after Molly finished with him. The fact someone cares enough to very likely oust the leader of a secret society from his position of power makes Draco feel better. It does. Or at least it will, when he’s ready to feel better.

“Dobby is dead. The Manor is secure again. They’re not gonna pack up and move when they have a huge house done up with all sorts of errr evil spells. Draco, are you sure that we can’t break into the manor? We did before.”
“When’s the next Order meeting?” Draco asks. “I have news.”
“Be quiet,” Draco says.
“You don’t have to be alone, you know. I’m not saying we have to do anything, but you don’t have to be alone.”
“You know you look the same as you did 3 years ago too!” Harry calls after Draco as he walks away.
And sweat, and pounding hearts, and fumbling for clothes. Harry grins large and silly and tries to make out with Draco against the side of the barn even though
“I just don’t want to have to kill anybody.” Harry says. “It’s so final. I’m not trying to change your mind. I just want to explain. I got excited when Pan said Narcissa might do it instead of me. It seemed like a way out and … I really want a way out.”

“So I’m supposed to just walk around hissing?” Draco’s eyes steel the way they do when he realizes he’s wrong but has decided to continue on with his plan as though he’s not.
, though?”
“You know, I was unhappy right after I married Arthur. For no real reason. It bothered me for months; I couldn’t figure out why I felt so unsatisfied. Then, one day, me and Arthur are talking about starting a family and I say, 'I don’t deserve to be a mother since I was such a bad daughter.' There it was. I blamed myself for my father’s addiction, and I hadn’t even realized until I was reaching for something I knew I wanted and trying to figure out why exactly there was a counterweight. Desire’s like that. It’s a path straight to the center of ourselves, in many ways the purest form of who we are. Things long buried get uncovered when traveling its road. That’s all that’s happened: you’ve found a roadblock. No need to worry. Keep following the path, keep wanting. Make an honest effort, and you’ll find a way through.”
“Oh that? It’s the horcruxes, want to see?” Potter throws the bag at Draco, who snags it out of the air. Usually dread is Draco’s chaser for desire, but this time it’s the other way around. He feels suddenly depressed and sluggish, then the overpowering need to open the pouch. It’s the only way to get rid of his melancholy mood, some part of him knows. So he does, and his head is filled with screaming.
“Potter. I did a lot of very complicated mental calculations and I think you’re the saddest person who survived the war.”
“And … I wanted to warn you about him. He has the ability to infect you. Just so you know.”
“Excellent idea. Let’s just give up our only advantage,” Granger says.
“It makes more sense to take him out
“France,” Draco tells the portkey officer when they ask for his destination. “Paris, to be precise. I’m moving in with my boyfriend.”
Pansy smiles again, wider, wilier. “I only said 10 because I didn’t want you to think I was being cocky. I can do it in 3.” They down the rest of Ron’s firewhiskey (“Hey!”) and turn to Harry.
“Mhmmm.” Draco brushes the hair out of Harry’s face. Harry grabs his wrist and places it between them. Pushes up his sleeve and traces the snake and skull printed on his arm.
“Oooo-kayyyy, but—”
“Severus …” Lucius starts. Snape pulls the comforter tighter against him. “If you insist on being dramatic, I won’t stop you. Storms are excellent for drama. The exact right mood to have a fight. I think I still have some of King Lear memorized.” Lucius walks to the wardrobe and pulls out a silk bathrobe he ties over his pajamas. “‘

“You’re being an ass, Dean,” Luna says.
The beginnings of a plan squirms in Draco’s brain. He pulls at it until he can see the outcome —
Third year is already the worst and they’re only barely through the Welcome Feast.
“It won’t matter if I kill him if we don’t destroy the horcruxes.”
Crabbe clutches his wand to his chest. “D-Don’t make me leave. Please.
“It’s not a game,” Pansy whispers to Draco, their lacy white biker glove knotting into the knee of his suit pants under the table. “But you had better do better than this. Potter’s speech is so gay.”
Hermione has never regretted teaching Draco to pick locks more than when he switches the lights on in her bedroom at 3 a.m. on the only day-off she’s had in months.
The ache expands, somehow, finds new crevices of Draco to occupy. He didn’t know
“Happy to see you,” he settles on. “How are you?”
“As though Narcissa would trust someone enough to use them as a spy,” Pan says.
“It makes a certain amount of sense,” Granger says.
They’re unintentionally mirroring one other, each rubbing the back of their respective heads. Draco, because he hit it on the car when Potter surprised him. Potter, because … from the way Potter's eyes seem focused on the floor, Draco would guess Potter’s neck massage has something to do with nerves.
He needs to get Ginny alone and ask her why she’s suddenly rekindled her relationship with a traitor … and also tell her he lost his virginity to Harry Fucking Potter.

They find the answer in the backroom of Borgin and Burkes, under lock and key and caution tape, in the section you have to ask about because its contents are too dangerous to be sold openly.
“AVADA KEDAVRA!” Ginny yells at Narcissa, who flicks her wrist and sends the curse flying off into the distance.
Draco remembers.
Snape’s beside him in the potions closet. “You will witness this.” He flicks his wand, and Draco’s head is pushed back into the pensieve and held there.
He lunges at her again, the same question still on his tongue, but she flicks her wand and is gone before he reaches her. He claws at the bed, manages to pull himself up and lurches toward the living room with ample support from the wall.
Red-Magenta-Red-Yellow-Blue.
“Mate, I want them back too, but it we give him the horcruxes then he’ll be immortal.”
Potter slams his hand down against the trunk of the car, head thrown back, final
She twists her wand deeper into his side, leans in and licks his ear. “I’d kill you,” she whispers, her tongue tracing his cartilage. “But I wouldn’t want to take that honor away from Cissy.” She bites down, twists. Something rips.
“You got home last, and we’ve got a full house right now. Ollivander’s in your room. It’s only temporary; Poppy’s planning on moving him to Grimmauld Place soon. It’s easier for her to work on him there; less people. You’ll have your bed back then. I’ve been using your room to store Arthur’s electric clock collection though; don’t be offended.”
“A little to the left,” Hermione says. “No, the other left. You’re a quidditch player. Shouldn’t you know which way left is?”
Harry slides his fingers across Draco’s wrist and plucks a card from the deck in his outstretched hand. Third from the bottom, the Ace of Spades. Draco has this particular configuration of cards memorized.
“Yes, Potter! Because we’re adults. Because despite the fact that I look 19, I’m actually 25 and thus will drink as much wine as I want whether on a date or not!”
“So you’re wishing for another large battle then. Maybe this time the Death Eaters can take the entire Burrow hostage, not just Fred and George. That’d probably result in the levels of adrenaline needed to get things going.”
He pulls Potter’s forearm onto the empty seat between them. Presses his palm firmly against the top of the other boy’s hand and feels each knuckle loosen in response.
“Mr. Potter,” Snape starts again. “I’m going to explain to you the nature of the curse you’ve been hit with
“I don’t lose things,” Draco snaps. “He’s somewhere on the manor ground. We have wards; I know when anything living leaves. I just don’t know his exact location.”

Plus, it’s at least ten degrees below room temperature. The Blacks are known for keeping a cold house, in every possible way that can be true. Draco sees the other Order members shiver and tries to pretend the chill bothers him.
“Ah, sorry, I didn’t mean to sneak up on you,” Potter says. He’s standing at the entrance of the barn sporting a case of bedhead that looks more unruly than his usual bedhead. He’s slept recently; that’s good. “Molly sent me to get a screwdriver. She, ah, didn’t say you’d be out here.”
“Open up, Malfoy! I know you’re there.” Are they on good enough terms for him to add, “You have to be there; you’re on house arrest”? They’ve only been talking since March, when Narcissa owled him from her deathbed:

“HaveAGoodTime, Bye!” He yells and pulls his head out of the fireplace. Resumes crying in the bathroom, now with the added quandary: Do I tell my ex-lover he’s babysitting a lethal baby if it means I’ll have to talk to him for the first time since I broke things off to focus on betraying him (and saving my mother’s life) in sixth year? He tries to convince himself he doesn’t care what happens to Harry and, when that doesn’t work, he tries to remember what hating Harry felt like. He ends up knocking on Grimmauld Place the day before the full moon.
Pan snorts. “Really? Just the two of you. I was under the impression you had a million brothers.”
“I … … … defected.” Crabbe’s eyebrows furrow. “I had time to think when I was
A purple curse hits Ollivander. He falls; Draco dives, and only very barely catches him.

“I don’t trust the Order. I trust Ginny. I trust Draco. The rest of you are in by proxy. Congratulations.” Pan makes an exaggerated figure eight motion with their head. “Besides, I think the Order would want to stop her coup, and I don’t exactly think that’s the best decision.”
“You’re better at them than I am at bleeding out.”
The Ace of Spades sits fifth from the top right now. He pulls the card beneath it. The King of Hearts. Harry looks at him for a second too long — not even a second, really; a millisecond; a micro-millisecond, but Draco knows Harry’s rhythms well enough to know when he’s staring.

On Thursday, Luna and Pansy show up at Harry’s house wearing one suit between the two of them, and then he’s standing in the corner of their favorite club wearing a baseball cap — Hermione’s proposed camouflage — ridiculous and miserable. He’s also pretty sure he told them he didn’t want to go out this week.
The air shimmers silver.
Draco grimaces. He does not want to think about that, or what Ginny is going through in a Death Eater-run Hogwarts.
A few nights after Draco's epiphany, Hermione wakes to thunder. A storm that jostles their house and sends her alarm clock tumbling to the floor, green digits stuck flashing 11:11 over and over again.
“Your wife is the dark lord’s right hand. If we lose, there’s going to be a target on your family’s back. You underestimate Narcissa if you don’t think she’s going to try to pin it all on you.”
Then, spring. Harry gets sick. Draco takes care of him. Heavy rain. A tree crushes part of the tent, fucks up the extension charm and forces them closer together. Summer: humidity, sweat, and —

You’ve probably tried to cast an Unforgiveable and it hasn’t worked because you weren’t angry enough. And love magic too, that’s an entire category of spells. So it stands to reason that other strong emotions can generate other types of magic.” Ollivander stops to inspect the blanket again. “You’d think this would get easier after telling it a few times. But this isn’t any less awkward than when I had to have this talk with my son or my grandson.”

is scrawled in messy letters beside it. The twins are lactose intolerant.
Draco has an entire speech prepared about childhood friendship and mutual queerness mistaken for young love that’s startling similar to what Potter is saying about Ginny, if considerably less sentimental. The only reason Draco’s toast is emotional at all is because emotion makes Pansy mad and anger has always been their stand-in for affection. But he has a better idea now, a way to simultaneously antagonize Pansy and one-up the other best man.
Is anything as disheartening as learning your
“I expected as much. Obviously, die isn’t the right word. Metamorphosis, that’s the word I’ve decided fits best. Because obviously, he’s here still.” Draco indicates the flaming baby bird sitting in a ring of ash on the corner of the armchair. “But his memories were erased, and that’s a kind of death. Kelvin was old for a phoenix — I think he was holding out for me, and he finally realized that I had no intention of going. But it was his time. I watched, out of respect. It was … beautiful. He looked so relieved. As though, finally, he could rest.”
and Harry had had a threesome with the two Beaters.
No. Obviously not. Draco has magic. Draco knows your card.
Draco shucks his pants off and lies down in the front seat of the Ford. His hand works up and down his own cock. He thinks about the look on Potter’s face as he snapped over the edge, about messy black hair and eyes rolled back.
If anyone thinks it’s suspicious that they come from the same direction — that both of them have been missing for the afternoon — that Harry has a hickey poking out of his collar Draco can’t bring himself to magic away — nobody says anything. Party preparation is in full swing by the time they get back to The Burrow; it doesn’t seem as though anyone’s really had time to clock their absence.
“But they’re not,” Ron says.
Ron sniffles. “She won’t talk to me. Said errrr said errr said she wanted space so she could think about, you know, errr errrr errrrrrrrrrrrr—”
to have an opinion about your boyfriend, but I have to because you’re all Harry talks about.
“You blew my mind,” Potter says maybe a minute later. He pulls Draco forward so that his feet rest against the barn floor: half-in, half-out of the car.
“It’s the night sky from Crema. Look, there’s Hercules, Lyra.” Each constellation glows a little brighter when Pan says its name. “Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. In the middle, that’s the Draco constellation.”
for me and then Potter blew him in the bathroom. Don’t tell anyone, but Draco wanks to that memory almost daily.
“Except we don’t know that the twins are being held at Malfoy Manor,” Granger chimes in. “We need to consider all the options before embarking on some sort of suicide mission.”
“So she’ll be able to make the Death Eaters run more efficiently and with greater precision and cruelty than Voldemort ever could. So she planned at least half of the deadliest raids during the first war, and nobody even suspected she was a Death Eater for years. So she killed almost a dozen people while we were on the run, and

“Oh my god move on,” Ginny says.
Draco leans down and kisses his hand. Harry feels the burn pass from Draco to him, feels the fire inside him dim. He gets older by two year, three.
Do you know how long it took us to domesticate wolves? Harry doesn’t, but within a month of him and Draco moving into Grimmauld Place, they get a dog.
“Generational Wealth,” Draco says. “I think I know a way out.”
“You’re spying for her!”
“Finally,” Ginny says. She sits down and leans against the window. “I love trains. I don’t understand why you spend so much time messing around cars when trains are the superior form of transportation.”
Draco registers the Death Eater ambush in flashes, vivid images that make the middle moments of quick motion and chaos disappear.
“Fuck,” Ron says. Pansy leans in. “Yes, that is the general idea. Come on, chop chop. Off to my place we go. Unless The Bookworm wants to watch. In that case — yours?”
Harry’s heard what it means several times before. Draco’s fond of this particular speech — it staves off Draco's fear of death, Harry suspects. Harry doesn’t understand most of the points Draco makes, but he listens anyways. Draco’s mind moves faster than his does — than anyone’s does, probably. He’s the one that figured out the Fiendfyre hadn’t died as much as it had escaped. It burns still, inside the two people who spent the longest time zig-zagging through its flames. It preserves the two of them. Prevents them from dying.

“Mr. Malfoy,” Snape says again. He should be crying. Why isn’t he crying? The left side of his mouth twitches downward a little. Or maybe Draco just blinks. “You may clean the potions closet for your detention, and you may do so quietly. I will take 10 points for any noise that disturbs my work. 20 points if I hear your voice.”
“You’ve assembled a real Noah’s Ark for us today, Potter,” Pansy says as they slot themselves into their normal seat beside Luna. Luna kisses their cheek, and Pansy doesn’t smile, exactly, just looks gloomy in a slightly higher key.
Draco laughs. “
“Yes,” he says and walks into the garden. Harry follows behind him like a dog. He’s not even sure he can speak parseltongue unless he’s actively looking at a snake, but he really doesn’t know how to turn Draco down when he has that intense look in his eye.
Lillies. Roses. Daffodils.
“I thought you didn’t want to be alone with me.”
Draco falls, fast and certain, called home by flames. He thinks nothing; feels only adrenaline, heat, smoke and then, from nowhere, or maybe billowing up from the land he destroyed, the upsetting realization that he’s going to die where he was born. His escape had been a delusion. He’s always been falling toward his burning home; his entire life is just a point that starts and ends here, one moment flickering, flashing, falling —
The phrase comes out jumbled and wet, more tears than words. Draco doubts Molly hears them. She’s crying too. They’re wrapped up in each other and what they built together, this large and eclectic group of people that somehow weathered the storm intact.
“Your …” He pointedly looks down and then back up into Potter’s eyes. Potter swallows and continues on with the game.
noise when it hits the wall directly to the man’s left.
“Lets just give them to Voldemort then, and let him deal with it,” Draco says and suddenly finds himself the center of the golden trio’s attention.
Everyone feels this way, right? As though there’s some part of themselves hidden from their own view? He asks his friends at Hogwarts.
Draco tries to suggest with his posture.
Draco doesn’t write any of it down. He takes Harry’s hand and presses cool metal into it. A key. “You have a home, you know. If you want it, there’s a place that’s permanent and yours.”
Ron squints at Harry. “You’re in a good mood.”
“Draco! Oh my god Draco,” Ginny’s voice says from his laptop.

Teddy’s hair settles pale green, the color of their comforter.
“What are you making?”

“The legislation is uncharacteristically clear.
Ron downs half the bottle’s contents, swallows. “Right. I’m here to tell you not to take that portkey. Dominic’s not a good bloke, doesn’t appreciate you at all.”
Pan continues looking at their nail beds. Their demeanor shifts from disinterested to disinterested with a side of worry.
The lights at Hogwarts would never come back on. Magic, though they hadn’t realized it at the time, had run out.
The sadness of that runs through Draco like a live wire. He can’t breathe in the workshop anymore, can’t be alone in a place he associates so strongly with the twins. He exits into the storefront.
“I know you can,” Ollivander grumbles. “I’ve been here the whole time.” He slides his eyes over to Draco. “Don’t watch. I still don’t trust you. I don’t want you knowing the exact incantation.”
“We don’t have time for the two of you to argue,” Granger says. “We’re in a war. Plans must be made, and this isn’t relevant—”
Time restarts. When Harry pulls back, Draco’s 29. As old as he’s supposed to be.
Maybe Draco doesn’t have to say anything at all.
“I don’t want to talk about work.“ So much of Draco’s life is determined by work. It gets to dictate when he sees Harry, he’s not going to let it dictate their conversations too.
“That can wait,” Granger says. She’s … surprisingly peppy, given their last conversation. Ron’s smiling big and sloppy. Draco would bet the fortune he no longer has that they fucked sometime in the past half hour. “We have to strategize, even though I’m extremely cross with both you and Harry. Ron is too.”
“Draco!"
Potter looks at him funny. “To set up the tent.”
But he feels it more when Draco walks away.

“Oh!” Arthur says. He takes stock of the faces there. “
Potter drops to his knees in front of Draco, gingerly reaches for his hand. Draco closes his eyes and tries to focus on breathing. He feels Potter’s sticky, tomato juice-covered fingers grasp the underside of his arm and hold it firm, the wound pointed skyward.
at Granger, whose eyes go wide. She disappears back into her room, and Draco turns his attention back to the virtual conversation.
“My entire relationship with Dumbledore was based around the idea that I was going to die.” Harry slams his fist on the table. “I died. Ha! Now
Pan Parkinson stands in the middle of the dungeon and smiles. How dare they be happy.
“We need to get out of here!” Draco yells.
“Use your imagination.”
“So you’re going to transform into a werewolf on Friday. Would you like company? I’m assuming you’re on wolfsbane, and I’m an animagus, remember.”
“Don’t be so —“ Draco doesn’t exactly know what he’s trying to say so he just gestures generally to the other man. “It’s just a segue so I can tell you that you can’t do anything in this department if you’re not married.
“I think we should plan to destroy the horcruxes as soon as possible then,” Hermione says. Draco nods. If he can somehow combine magical lust power — god, he hates thinking those words in that order — with electrical power, he should be able to generate enough power to cast Fiendfyre. He could probably create a feedback loop …
“Say what you mean, Severus. I don’t have time for your vagueries. My son needs me.”
“Don’t pity me. Lily made choices, and now she has to live with them,” Snape pushes Lucius’s hand away and leans against the headboard. “It made me think concretely about the end of the war. What that would mean for you.”
“Did everyone make it? Fred and George? Potter? Ron, Ginny, Granger, Ollivander, Luna, Dean?” He runs through the events of the manor mission, searching for people he might have forgotten. “Pan?”
“We’re having a lesbian wedding, and one of the best men won’t stop talking about how hot the bride’s ex-boyfriend is.” Potter makes Pansy’s point by detailing exactly how swooshy he thought Draco’s hair was at the Yule Ball.
“Narcissa will be here more, or maybe not. I won’t be forced to participate in the occasional raid or two. I’ll have an easier time finding a babysitter if we want to get away for a few days. Generally inconsequential things.”
Harry’s scowl deepens. “My life's not all fun and games, you know. I can’t go out in public without anyone trying to take my picture.”
Harry speaks full sentences again, then paragraphs, then suddenly he’s telling Draco about the war, starting with, “I really fucking hate Voldemort,” and ending with, “I think I miss my friends.”
“What does that mean?” Draco says, even though he knows.
“I think you’re grieving. It’s not as though your mom will know you left.”
George grins. “Suppose I’m a one-ear pony.”
He goes for the throat. “No one wants your apologies, Potter. We’d rather you get your shit together and stop this fucking war.”
Draco says.
Yes. He really does need to do that; it’s not an excuse. He scrounges around in the top drawer of Fred’s desk for a piece of paper, ignores Potter’s confused, “Alright” and the door to the workshop opening and closing.
He looks around at his team, a combination of regular members and new faces. There’s Luna and Pansy, of course, and Ron, who is currently consorting with the enemy — towering over Fred and George’s table in the corner, gesticulating widely about quidditch, one hand clamped around an empty bottle. Hermione and Anthony Goldstein are deep in conversation on the other side of Luna. Anthony’s eyes keep sliding over to Harry, and Harry’s trying to pretend he doesn’t notice. Inviting Anthony was Hermione’s idea, a way to smooth things over between them after their breakup. So far, nothing is smooth, and everything is very, very awkward. Two Gryffindors. Two Ravenclaws.
