It has been a while since he had been here, a little bit less than 5 months but still so much had changed. Not that he was complaining, but if before he couldn't picture himself entering the manor without getting strong nausea, now it was unbearable but it was something he was decided to do. Each step he took onto the entrance felt heavy and he could feel the anxiety rising to dangerous levels, but then he remembered his mom and how sad she was when he left and if he could manage to have just a small piece of her courage he would be just fine.
"Well, then you can leave guys, I have things to do, letters to write and meetings to attend, take a candy while you see yourself out," and so they ended up outside of the headmistress with candy in hand and a smile on their faces.
“Yeah, I mean, it’s gonna be awkward and all, but I believe this year should be a fresh start for everyone, including you Malfoy, you called me mudblood, I broke your nose, and so on so… it might be nice to have someone to study with for once,” said Hermione offering him a small smile
“Oh really? And should I sit in case the answer kills me?” Harry joked and Draco smiled taking a sip from his beverage.
"I still can't believe you didn't pack yesterday," said Ron while watching Harry suffering to fit all of his clothes in a bag. "And I still can't believe you haven't asked Hermione to make an extension charm to your things, I swear its life-changing"
"I love it, but it's hard to eat food when all I want to eat is you," he teased and the blond's face got so red that he resembled a tomato.
"I'm sorry, I fucked up again, I'm so sorry," Draco began to cry and Harry looked at him with soft eyes and sat in the bed so he could hug him.
"Who knew Zabini knew how to fight? Since you always seem so calm and chill," Theo said while spitting blood on the floor. "Oh, and you got the chose one to join the fun, how lovely"
“I thought you were over stalking me” answered Malfoy without removing his eyes from the ground, he was shaking and considering the light sweater he was wearing Harry wasn’t surprised.
"I'm not 5 years old, you know?" spoke Draco for the first time since Harry arrived and the girl sighed, "I'll write, I promise, and if I get bored I'll just go home or with you, deal?" and that answer convinces the girl enough to finally say her goodbyes and leave the two boys alone
“Oh Merlin, this is awesome! Hannah owes me 10 galleons now!” was the first thing Ginny said before falling at a laughing spree. “Sorry, it’s just, there have been so many bets around you two since forever but they got even better when you started to be good friends.”
After that incident, Draco quickly learned to not make big messes, because it was improper, and if he was stupid enough to make one he always made sure to solve it himself as quickly as possible fearing the consequences. But it wasn't until he was 8 years old that he felt truly terrified of his father.
"It's time for you to sleep, tomorrow it's a big day and I don't want you to be tired honey," Harry said and kissed her forehead as Draco tucked her in, again.
"Sorry, but I bought the ice cream that you wanted and it was melting, also, did you know the Davies' got a dog? It's so big, it scared the shit out of me," Harry explained to his boyfriend while taking his coat off, and giving Draco a kiss of the cheek.
“Couldn’t sleep?” Harry asked once Draco was sitting beside him, the boy shook his head and that’s when he noticed how bad he was trembling, his eyes we slightly unfocused and he seemed to flinch at every noise that was heard. “Are you okay?” The green-eyed boy saw Malfoy tense at the question and gave him time not pressing him for an answer, which the boy thanked, so when a pale hand reached his tanned one he understood that it was not a good time for having a conversation, but that company was appreciated.
“Want one? There’s plenty, although you should hurry if you like something in special before Ron’s hands get to it” he said laughing and Malfoy looked at him with curious eyes and nodded.
Putting the thought away he went to his dorm and grabbed the marauders map “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good” he said pointing his wand to the map and as soon as the names started to appear he began looking for Malfoy’s name. When he found him at the Astronomy tower he felt like vomiting, memories of that day began to invade his mind and he felt an anxiety attack on its way. So he began to control his breathing as his mind healer taught him and when he was calm enough he began his way to the blonde’s location.
“Who would’ve thought that Harry Potter was better at potions than the mud-blood,” said Pansy once they were out of the classroom, “if I remember correctly he used to be absolutely rubbish at potions,”
“If you add a little bit more of Moondew and stir twice clockwise you might still be able to save it,” said Draco, who has been watching Harry's horrible potion skills for some time now, so Harry took his help as a way of saying "I don't want to end up in the hospital wing again due to a catastrophic potion". So Harry did what told and to his surprise, his potion ended up being okay, not perfect, but okay and that was enough for him.
"That was amazing, so you're telling me they do that and get it ree-corded and I can watch it as many times as I want to?" Harry nodded and Draco smiled, "that's amazing, can we watch more at home?"
"Oh, you're so thoughtful Draco, I'm sure my boy here is a lucky man to have your hand," Theo's father said with a genuine smile and Draco almost felt bad for him, scratch that, he felt to bad for him and how he was just a piece on the chess game his father had in mind.
“She’s right, you know? You have changed as well Draco, you’ve grown so much and I’m so proud of you but I can’t do this for you, this time you’re on your own but please just remember that we will be here no matter what decision you take,” said Blaise ad he hugged him, “you should eat more, I swear every time I hug you, you feel more boney”
Draco finished reading the letter and sighed deeply while throwing it to the flames and ran upstairs, most likely to their room, Harry tried to ignore it knowing that if he went after him right now the blond would most likely kill him. After all he has learned how to read Draco's moods and reactions, and this time it was a clear 'I want to be alone, but if you want to come up later with something sweet I'll love you forever', and so he respected his wishes and continue talking with Hermione about her new discovery.
"Oh believe me Potter, if I wanted him dead he would already be dead," said Blaise kicking Theo in the stomach again while the other boy laughed
“Three times, I saved your life three times” the grey-eyed boy interrupted him and connected his eyes with his “not that we’re counting but yeah…”
"I had you, and Pansy, and Blaise and Hermione and you and Ron and you," Draco is crying now, he does that a lot lately, and as much as it hurts Harry to see him cry he prefers it over other things.
"I never ask questions not because I don't want to know the answers but because I don't know if you're ready to give them. I sure as hell am not ready to tell you a lot of things, and that's okay, because I know you won't push so I don't really understand why it's okay to push
When Draco was little this kind of show was unacceptable, mother would never allow him to be up after his bedtime and the only bedtime stories allowed were written by wizards, so he still found it odd when Lily said she wanted to be like Anna from Frozen o Wonder Woman.
"Dear Lord, leave the boy alone, you both are in real trouble but that can wait, Ms. Parkinson, help me take the boy back to the infirmary," said Madame Pomfrey with an alarmed voice
But he also hated how much he missed it, how many good memories he had there when he was little and he coudln't help but wonder how different things would be if I he wasn't such a git when little, how war could've ended earlier if his family didn't participated on it and how less messed up he could've been.
In the end, it looked something like: Draco needs to ride a car, a motorcycle, take the subway to somewhere, watch a movie on a movie theatre, watch a season of British Bake Off, go to a museum and do something totally crazy. And Harry needed to change his wardrobe (because Draco said he dressed worse than Filtch), get presents for Neville, Pansy, Blaise and Andromeda (the fact that he already had one for Draco remained unmentioned), teach Draco how to cook something cool and do something he had wanted for a while.
"Stop it, you're gonna get in trouble, or worse, in Azkaban because it looks like you're trying to kill him"
“I mean what I said, don’t think too much about it, the brain has a wonderful capacity of making a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t do something, it gets ridiculous at some point but we don’t really see it,” Ginny sat beside him on the cold stairs, “think about it like a boggart, you are terrified of it and you’ll continue to be terrified of it unless you do something, so you cast a spell and suddenly it doesn’t seem as bad as before”
“Easy there, I know how you feel,” she offered him her hand and he took it unsure about where this was going, “after everything that happened with Tom’s diary I was alone, so alone, no one really asked me about what happened because everyone was too worried about Harry. And don’t get me wrong, that kind fought a fucking basilisk and destroyed a horrocrux when he was 12 and survived to tell it, but I was 11 and I was controlled by Voldemort so I expected some comfort which never came”
“Just fuck off already, we’ve been dying to see the day you fix your stupid crooked nose, and yet, here we are,” and with that, he took his stuff and left the common room.
"Your family is really weird," said Draco while trying to eat the pizza without making a mess. It took a second for Harry to understand that Draco meant the Weasley's and his heart fluttered at it, because yes, they were his family.
"I am okay, just a bit tired, Lily had a lot of energy today and I haven't been sleeping that well since we are waiting for the big news," the blond answered and let himself be pulled into a hug.
"Did you know that I used to wonder what it was like to be you? Spoiled and loved by your parents? I was jealous our whole first year, seeing how your mother always sent you sweets and letters, and how you seemed to have a happy childhood and all that, but then I met the Weasley's as a family and I realized that you couldn't be more happy than me, because even when you had all that you still felt alone, right?"
"Fine, if the git can manage it then so can I, you and I have a date this weekend," Ron said with confidence and Ginny said she wanted one as well.
“About that… there’s something I need to tell you,” he paused as he felt Draco’s body tense, “remember that night when you asked me what was like to fell in love with someone? At first, I was going to say yes, and my answer still stands but for different reasons. I once thought I love Cho but then I realized it was a crush that ended in the worst teenage drama ever,” he laughed and Draco relaxed a little still unsure on where was this going. “Then I thought I loved Ginny, and I do, but not in the way I once thought I did. And that’s okay because I realized that the only person I’ve ever felt something so powerful for… is you, and it doesn’t matter if that feeling was once hatred because right now I’m utterly and deeply in love with you and it’s totally fine if you don’t feel the same way but I can’t stand another day without-“
“9 am, it’s still pretty early, go back to sleep and I’ll make breakfast,” when no one answered Harry smiled because the other boy was fast asleep again, he decided that maybe he could stay just for a bit longer, after all, it was still early.
His heart? What was that? He wasn’t raised to follow his heart, following your heart lead to being heartbroken and sadness. But then again, Draco was already sad so a little bit more of sadness wouldn’t hurt him, right? But that was a lie because Harry was anything but sadness to him, whenever he was with him he felt like everything would be alright.
When they arrived again to Andromenda's home, Harry left Draco for a second to go and put the child to sleep, and when he came back he saw the two family members hugging, and crying while doing so. What he would give for a photo of this moment, they said their goodbyes and flooded back to Hogsmeade, where they enjoyed a butterbeer.
"Shouldn't you be asleep?" Harry asked their daughter while he gave her the glass of water and Lily just giggled.
"Don't worry, I'm sure Molly is going to be very busy asking Percy about all the wedding details, and I mean, why shouldn't she? He has the worst taste ever and her fiancé too."
He could feel the hate, but it felt different, as it felt when his father first exited Azkaban. His magic was unstable and that was something to worry about, the last time it was like this the hexes left severe damage and he didn't want to imagine the damages of any unforgivable. This lasted only for a few minutes, but they were enough for Draco to wish he didn't come in the first place, he had already sent a letter to his mother and he should have been more certain his father was back where he belong.
"Oh yeah, that reminds me," said the blond when they were close to Hogwarts, "my aunt gave me this, she said that my mom used to enjoy taking pictures back in school" and with that, he took out a camera from his pocket, it was old but still usable so Harry took it and smiled.
"Yeah, I'll give muggles that, they sure know how to make comfy clothes that manage to make my arse look amazing," the blond said as he checked himself out on the mirror.
“Did you ever wondered why I tried everything I could to be back at Hogwarts every year? No matter how many times I was almost murdered?”
"We're fine, your mother is okay and the others were just burned slightly, it seems like you set fire to the manor as a self-defense mechanism; the Aurors want to ask some questions but they can wait if you're not feeling well yet."
"So, today we need to go shopping because Christmas Eve is tomorrow and we have nothing but toast and leftover pizza on the fridge," said Harry as he takes a sip of his coffee.
He needed to practice his flying, it's been months since he has been on a broom and he wasn't going to let those Gryffindors win, he was still a Slytherin and cunning as hell. But maybe he needed to eat something first, either the dizziness was due to the lack of sleep or the lack of food, you make the choice. He should talk to someone about what was on his mind, someone who wouldn't judge him nor tell him what to do, just someone.
“So, I have to do an essay about eye-pots? Yeah, I think that was it, but I don’t get how they manage to reproduce music, or how it works because they use something called ‘elec-tree-city’ and I’m so confused” said Draco with a pout showing Hermione what he had written so far.
"Well, I tried cooking meringues with Harry during the holidays but it ended up being a mess, they tasted good but looked awful," smiled Draco at the memory
"You must know you're so hard to buy something," began saying Draco while handing him a box "but I really hope you like it, if not you can return it"
"Well, I gotta go, love, I promised Pansy I was going to help her choose an anniversary gift for Blaise, can you believe it? They actually lasted more than a week," his boyfriend said and Harry kissed him slowly on the lips. "If you keep doing that I won't want to go"
“May I?” He asked once beside him and Draco just shrugged, so Harry took the invitation, “aren’t you cold?”
"I know it's going to be alright, but I can't help to feel anxious," Harry laughed lightly and kissed Draco's forehead.
year? You followed him on the map all the time! I was starting to get worried about him getting murdered by you- Yeah well, that was just a bad analogy, sorry” she smiled apologetically and Harry sighed, she was right, after all, she always was.
And if Draco didn't understood why the twins were threten, the next day was proof enough for him to know that owning a pranking store does things to you. God knows they still cringe everytime they talk about that time Fred and George made a rum who made the drinker say their darker secret, Harry definitely didn't need to know that Ron had called Hermione 'mommy' once during sex.
"Close your eyes and hand me your hands," and so Harry did, a minute after he felt something small and cold in his hands, it felt too small for a snitch but too big for an earring. "You can open them now," the nervousness was clear as da in the blond's voice, so Harry opened his eyes calmly and looked at his hands.
Many people, and by people he meant The prophet, said a lot of things about his relationship with the younger Weasley, from ‘young love never works’ to ‘the ginger girl left the chosen one after deciding he wasn’t so special anymore’. In the end, they broke up because it felt too weird, before the war they realized so and that’s when Ginny and Luna started to kick off, so when he returned they both were relieved when they agreed that their relationship was more on the brother-sister side than in the ‘let’s get married and have kids’.
"One question, I think I'm ready for one question," Harry holds his breath because there were a lot of questions he wanted to ask, but it also felt wrong to ask something without giving Draco the same opportunity.
"I believe not Professor," answered Harry on behalf of him, because honestly Draco was just too shocked because people tend not to believe him, not that he hadn't given people reasons to not believe him, but still this feeling was so foreign yet so amazing.
They continue to eat, but Harry could feel that Draco wanted to say something else but was having a hard time figuring out how to say it. So he took the grey-eyed boy hand and give it a soft squeeze while asking what was wrong.
"Yeah, I'm just worried about an Ancient Runes homework, I've been trying to figure out something and didn't sleep well" dismissed Draco and Blaise nodded not really believing Draco until Hermione talked
"Quite a scare you gave us Mr. Malfoy, the good news is that it was nothing too bad so I can fix it, at least what hurts in your body, the mind is out of my league," she handed him 3 potions, which he took while Hermione said goodbye and left the infirmary as well. "I'll leave you two alone for a couple of minutes, but after that, I want you gone as well Mr. Potter, your boyfriend needs to rest."
They stayed silent for a few minutes, Draco was trying to get a grip of his thoughts and Harry was just giving him time, so when Harry felt the other boy throw himself into his arms he was sure as hell surprised.
"I hate to wrap things, I hate it so much," complained Harry as he wrapped Neville's gift and Draco just laughed at his misery, it was almost midnight and they were in the kitchen drinking tea with soft music playing on the background, it felt stupidly domestic. "I'm done!" he screamed and Draco got scared because of it so it was Harry's turn to laugh.
Maybe that was just a side plan Harry had to not mess up the surprise he had for tomorrow, and later Draco would actually know that it was indeed a distraction, but for now Harry had won their battle of expressing how much they loved each other.
He hated this house, he hated the memories he had craved on his brain and how all the light was gone. How this living room was once full of blood and how he could hear the screams of pain and horror from his room, how much he wanted to die each night he couldn't help anyone. Draco knew that if he inherited the manor he would burn it down to the ground in hope it would take all the darkness away.
But yet again, life reminded Draco that he wasn’t worthy of what he wanted, that he must be the carrier of all the karma his family (and himself) have had to come all these years. He stopped being so loud unless important people were watching, like Umbridge in his fifth year. He started to be a hell lot more cautious about his actions, about his words, about his appearance, about his smiles, about his tears, so when his father was thrown to Azkaban he finally felt as if he could breathe, and he loathed himself for it because Lucius was his father and all he ever did was to make him a better person… right? Right?!?
"I'll leave you two alone, see you tomorrow Draco, I'll let Pansy know you're okay," Blaise half-smiled and left the infirmary.
All the hose elves were eager to help Harry out, and when they refused to let him the help he just sat there eating a sandwich someone made him. After he was finished, he took the chocolate parfaits and left a couple of galleons for the elves and left before they could throw a fit about it and how it was not necessary. The way to the tower felt quicker than usual, he was so nervous about the whole thing, he could scream to relieve his stress but when he saw Draco sitting on the cold floor his red nose and dry tears on his cheeks he couldn’t help but smile.
They talked about random things while eating and Harry loved how free Draco seemed when he was away from the wizarding world, he resembled of a child eager to eat the world, Harry wished he could make Draco feel this way for the rest of their lives, but he knew if he tried so it was going to be difficult as heck, but deep down he knew he was going to try it as hard as he could.
“Draco Malfoy bald? Now that’s something I want to see,” he heard Blaise laugh, which definitely didn’t help his, already, sour mood.
The third time Harry realized that maybe he wasn’t like the others was when he magically rode a fucking broom, later he learned that it wasn’t his first time and that Sirius actually bought him a toy broom when he was one, so Hermione wasn’t lying about talent being practically on his blood. And then, a year later he was reminded, again, that he was different because apparently he can
“And you? What do you deserve Draco?” Harry interrupted the boy’s rant feeling slightly mad at the fact that he could relate to the other boy so much, and it hurt him deeply because it all made sense now. The reason behind he didn’t heal his wounds, or why he was always flinching at sudden contact or the panic attacks, everything made sense.
"You can't feel guilty for it, you must remember it was a war and that nothing it's fair, that you had no control whatsoever and that it was my decision so I'm the only one to blame." Harry knew he wasn't going to like the answer but he swore it anyways, "When you were gone my aunt was so angry, she was so mad about the fact that a hose elf almost killed her and my mother tried to calm her down but it was not helpful. Then the Dark Lord arrived and called me a traitor, he had so much hate inside him that his cruciatus curse felt like being burned alive with fire and ice at the same time, he kept laughing and saying that I could choose my mother to take my place, but I couldn't do that to her, I just couldn't Harry." Draco took a big breath trying to calm himself while Harry tried to not throw up. "But I'm okay now, Hermione had helped me a lot with the tremors my muscles have, and I don't feel pain anymore which is good."
“Well, I’m going to go to the quidditch pitch, I’m going to try out for chaser this year, you coming?” asked Blaise, the incident of that morning long forgotten, but Draco shook his head.
Draco expressed his concern about visiting his aunt the day before, saying that maybe she wasn’t going to be really pleased when he saw him due to the relationship with his family, but Harry assured him that it would be alright, he really wanted Draco to meet Teddy, after all, he was his uncle. So Draco insisted to bring a present, for Andromeda he bought a box of fancy chocolates and for Teddy they needed to go to a muggle store, taking advantage of said trip Harry was going to buy the costumes for he and Draco.
"Are you okay, love? You look a little bit pale," asked Harry when he noticed Draco's pace had slowed down.
"Well, you won't be able to forget after today cause you're going down Malfoy," said Ron and so the fame was on.
“And anyway, it’s not like Draco would say no to you,” said Luna who has stayed quiet until that moment, and Harry nodded not really listening to her. “He always talks about you, you know? About a week ago he came panicking saying how he almost confessed his feelings to you, but that he was sure you didn’t hear him or decided to ignore them to save him a great disappointment” she continued and that was when something made click for Harry
Harry loved to remember, some of his memories haunted him in all the bad ways but others bring smiles and happy tears to his eyes. One of his favourite moments was his first Quidditch game, or when he saw Ron and Hermione sitting at the Gryffindor table waiting for him on the last day of his first year. He also loved remembering his first Christmas with the Weasleys and how warm and full of love he felt around them, he even liked the brother-like arguments he had with Ron or the twins and he found it hilarious that everyone was terrified of Ginny for all the right reasons. He loved his friends and all the cool little adventures they had, and now one of his favourite memories was seeing Draco in the morning with his messy hair and puffy eyes, or how he only showed his true smile around people he trusted.
"Sounds too complicated, I don't know how muggles manage to find such amazing stuff without magic," replied Draco while taking his toiletries, "sometimes I wonder what else I missed out because of my beliefs" he finished and headed to the bathroom where he took a quick shower, trying to ignore the dark mark.
"You're such a disgrace, I'm sure Molly would be disappointed knowing that you rather break the ministry rules than fold your clothes like a normal person," said Harry in a jokingly way while finally managing to fit everything.
“Why don’t you come to sit with us?” He asked, not really wanting to look at Hermione’s nor Ron’s faces “the wagon is big enough and it would be a waste if only us 3 use it”
Harry saw how Draco blushed but try to hide it behind his Slytherin scarf, mumbling a quiet ‘thank you’. They stayed like that for a while before any of them talked again, Harry loved how natural this silences felt, there was no need for filling them.
"yeah, just the ones in your arm but I feel like there's more and I'm pretty scared to ask about them, because I feel some of them has been caused by me and I need to know but not yet, is that okay?"
"Oh c'mon, you're good but we never managed to beat Gryffindor when Harry played," said Blaise and Draco gasped
“Sorry, but you once told me that I could kiss you whenever you said something stupid, and that sounded pretty stupid for me,” the raven-haired boy laughed lightly, but Draco just stared at his boyfriend, his normally pale grey eyes were now darker and filled with lust, and he just closed the space between them again only this time kissing him harder and with a lot of neediness.
“Sorry, go back to sleep if you want,” Harry answered knowing that yesterday had been an eventful day.
“Sorry” he heard him say and all he could do was nod, but then he actually saw at Malfoy and something inside him felt tight and uneasy, he looked even worse than on his trial, and Harry honestly wondered how hadn’t he fall when they collide. Not expecting an answer the blonde started to walk again, he looked so lost, it kind of reminded him of his first year not knowing what to do, if it wasn’t because of Ms Weasley maybe he wouldn’t have made it to Hogwarts, so with that memory on his mind he reached for Malfoy’s wrist startling the boy.
"All the little children dress like that all the time, Harry?" Draco asked once they were sitting waiting for their order.
“Do you ever get scared of your own thoughts?” was the first thing Draco said when he felt Harry come up the stairs.
"I'm not going nowhere near that machine, why would the muggles want hot toast to jump right to your face?" Harry just laughed and continued to cook.
A couple of weeks later he learned that Elizabeth (that was her name) always felt alone and that being dead didn’t make a difference in her life, she always felt alone and people were mean to her, just like now. Maybe Draco never learned how to make friends, but it was never too late to learn, after all, if he messed up he could just stop going to that bathroom.
"Did you get in a lot of trouble?" Asked Harry and immediately apologized "sorry, I didn't mean to ask another question, please just forget about it I-"
"Draco, do you care about mine?" the blond shaked his head, "then why would I care about yours? I know they make you feel insecure but I love you as a whole and you know it, you're beautiful with or without them, I promise"
"Why would you be alone?" a soft voice mumbled and Harry tried to see where it was from through his teary eyes, "why are you crying, did someone died?" How could he forget that voice, that beautiful voice that used to annoy him and now never fail to make him smile.
It’s still quite early, but maybe Malfoy had a long routine or something, so he approached the bed quietly, and when he parted the curtains slightly he noticed how peaceful the blond looks asleep, the bruise is now looking green-ish in some parts meaning it was healing. Harry caught himself smiling a little and decided to wake up the boy before going to meet with his friends.
“I mean, I don’t necessarily think he’s faking it but what if he regrets it? I know there’s a lot of bets going on about us, and that’s okay because at least I know that there are people who have move on but there are even more people that haven’t. And you know I can deal with all the hate and hexes, but I remember when Harry was dealing with the hate on his 5
Harry opened Draco's thighs with his hands while casting a wandless spell to lube Draco's entrance, he started to massage it slowly loving how the blond squirmed and moaned asking for more, then he slowly introduced one finger exploring his way in until that didn't felt enough and decided to add another one, he loved the way Draco looked spread out like that, with a thin layer of sweat covering his pale skin and with all the love marks coming to life with every second it passed. The thought of being inside was becoming too much just when found Draco's prostate, and that loud scream was enough for Harry to pull put his fingers and replace them with his own hard dick.
“Harry won’t care about that Draco, he has scars too, we all have,” said Luna with her calm voice Draco loved so much, whenever he felt anxious back in the manor he would go and talk to her until he fell asleep, that ended in painful punishments but it was so worth it. “And he has a lot of scars, I’ve seen them and I’m sure you don’t care about that, right?”
"I wanted to apologize, I didn't know what that spell did and yet I used it on you, it's one of the few things I regret in life, and I'm not saying this because we're together now, I wanted to apologize since day one, but I never knew how," Harry paused, "I figured that 'sorry I almost killed you' sounded too bad and then a lot of shit happened so yeah.."
“Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions. A menace, actually so. I'm probably just gonna-“ but Harry quickly took the hem of his robe to prevent the boy to run away and leave him alone at the same time that the professor spoke again.
And well, this place has changed a lot since he first visited, he had finally got rid of the awful portrait of Walburga Black, and had redecorated a lot, including putting electricity so the muggle artefacts he bought could work. Harry knew it was far from perfect, and nowhere close to the luxury stuff Draco was probably used to but when he saw the sparkling eyes of the said boy his stomach did a flip.
"I want to get a tattoo, I've been thinking a lot and I hate this mark, its worse than any scar I have and I want to cover it with something
"I heard your voice and I wanted to see you daddy, also, you promised that you were going to read me a story and I had to settle for the horrible acting dad does when he switches characters," she pouted and Draco just pretended to be offended, "I know he tries his best, but you are funnier daddy," she then tried to make the situation better, but the damage was done so the only solution was to tickle her, and that's exactly what Draco did.
"Honestly? I don't know, I mean, I could lie and tell you that the only reason why I did it was that I thought you were too much of a coward to be a death eater, or that you were just a kid like me who was used as a pawn in a stupid war, but in the end, I don't know. I asked a lot of people to give me a reason to do it because I just wanted to do it but I felt like people would ask why and I couldn't find an answer. And that's when I learned that I only got to see the part of you that
Harry smashed his lips against the blonds’ ones, it was kind of messy but felt perfect anyways, they both got so into it that for a minute breathing was unimportant, until it was and they had to break it off.
"I just can't believe her, she's always like that! And I know it, okay? But she promised that she was going to come for our last day, she was here! She fucking lives here now! And she decided to choose father over me again and-" Harry observes Draco while he complaints, he had noticed that when the blond got mad and tried to talk about it he uses a lot of hands movements, it was a little bit funny but Harry would never admit that in front of his boyfriend. "And I get it, you know? I would choose him over me, hell I don't even know why you choose me at all when I'm just-" he kisses Draco in order to cut his rant, and for a second the blond doesn't react, but when he does, they keep kissing until they need to break it off in order to breathe.
But sometimes being different wasn’t so bad, because thanks to it he had a lot of friends in this new world that liked him for who he was, and even if he had fans and anti-fans, it was kind of fun to be a celebrity. And being different also provided him his worst nightmare, that even though now he swore he hated Draco Malfoy he sometimes fantasizes about telling his children about his archenemy and laugh about it.
Maybe Harry Potter should have realized that he was different he was when he didn’t have a room for himself as his cousin did, or the way his parent's death was a topic that had to be avoided at all costs, or how his other classmates had loving families and favorite foods and he didn’t, or the way his hair grew from night to morning no matter what his aunt did to it.
“I mean, there’s nothing a good wanker can’t fix love” and so they continued to talk in the most normal way, Draco blushing every time even harder than before. But of course, the chill atmosphere had to be ruined by Theodore Nott.
"I took a lot of stupid decisions as well, I mean, you already know about that. But I would do it all over again if my end game was you"
"I hate you both, I expected this kind of betrayal from my sister, but my best friend?!" Ron pouted and Ginny said something like 'he's already family Ronald' between laughs.
"Well, mister independent, are you ready?" Draco nodded as he took Harry's hand, who apparated them on Grimmauld place. "And I present you the number 12 in Grimmauld place." Said Harry with a bow and the other boy just raised his eyebrow.
Harry did have plans, he was going to visit his parents’ grave in the morning and then he promised Teddy he was going to take him Trick-or-Treating to muggle London, so he still needed to figure out his costume, Teddy was currently obsessed with Pokemon and he wanted to be Meowth so Harry agreed to be James from Team Rocket.
“But it is true, I lost my ‘oh so-called virginity’ when I was 14, a Durmstrang friend, and then I was with him and another boy, then I was with a Ravenclaw boy and it was amazing, I loved feeling that way, I know none of them cared about me in a loving way but they were nice enough to at least pretend. And then everything went to shit with the war, things happened that gave me a bad reputation among ‘my people’ and I have to make things right no matter the price I pay, it’s how it works” Draco was calm enough now, he was basically cuddling Harry by now and he was okay with it.
“I… I’m sorry for being horrible to you all these years, I don’t know why you’re being kind to me but if this is a joke I would rather to just be hexed already” His voice trembled too much and it was painfully soft to believe this was Malfoy speaking.
“We thought you stood us up, then Blaise reminded me how long Draco takes to get ready and decided to wait for you guys for a bit more,” half-joked Pansy taking a sip from her glass of wine and Draco just rolled his eyes.
“I do, and it’s okay if you don’t love me yet, I’ll wait for you forever if you asked me to because you’re everything I ever dreamed of and if you give me the opportunity I’ll try my best to be that for you”
"You don't have to apologize, I know you're trying Draco and no recovery is lineal, I know you're gonna fuck up as much as I'm gonna do it, just please don't shut me down."
"We can stop, you know? Just because you said you wanted to doesn't mean that we have to go all the way through it," Harry assured and Draco nodded slowly
“Why do you do it?” was the first thing Harry asked when he saw Draco enter the room, it was past midnight and his other roommates were asleep. The only light was the one coming from the window, the same one Harry was facing, “you do know there’s more than following your parent's expectations, right? That you can be free if you really wanted to.”
"Harry! We should have left some of that treacle pudding, Ginny gave me some ideas that included one of us eating it out from some interesting places," and when Harry stopped shocked at Dracos words and blushing even harder than he did earlier that day, the blond went fro the snitch catching it and finishing the game.
But it wasn’t until Dudley’s birthday when he actually realized that maybe, he was different in a completely different way. Claiming that he could speak to snakes and make glass disappear could put you in a mental hospital so fast, so maybe that’s why Harry didn’t say a word about it. Then the letters arrived and the strange mood around the house made him think that it could be related to it, why would anyone send letters to him? He was an orphan who was lucky enough to have a place to live, and more importantly, why now? What was so special about him this year that made his uncle’s house nearly overflow with letters? And yeah well, being a wizard wasn’t the answer he was looking for, but learning about the truth of his parent's death helped him explain the dreams he had about a green flash of light and a high, cold, laugh. It never made sense for his parents to be laughing like that in case that memory was from the car crash, but now it all makes sense, and it all tied up to his scar.
"I love you too, I love you so much that I think you'll like a surprise I have for you," and with that said a Patronus appeared in the room.
Between messy kisses and soft moans they mapped each other's torsos, Harry learned how loud Draco was whenever he brushed his nipples and proceeded to bite them lightly while Draco gripped Harry's hair harder. Suddenly that didn't felt enough and Harry's hands found their way to Draco's pants and started to undo the belt and buttons, once he managed to do so, he grabbed Draco's hips lifting them up until there was enough space to pull them down, leaving only a tight pair of boxers which were even tighter around Draco's erection.
"Well yeah, but you don't have to get an 'it's not a phase mom' kind of style dude, just leave it longer or style it differently"
His mother just stared at him, something was so wrong with he and it was driving him mad that he couldn't pin point what it was. I wasn't too difficult to figure out who the guests would be, and he was sure that if he left now he would just make things worse for him and therefore for Harry. So, a smooth diner and he was out.
“Well, you know what they say, once you meet your true love you start to see how others feel” and with that, they start kissing, so Harry has to clear his voice to catch the attention of the couple
"I never had something like that, the closest thing I had was those chocolates that my mother used to send me, but then with the war that stopped and so my good memories around my house"
“I don’t know, lately I’ve been having trouble with it, maybe I’ll shave it off,” he answered instead, why couldn’t they leave him alone? It was just hair.
"Are you okay?" was the first thing he asked when he realized there was no real danger around them, and Draco nodded slowly as they both tried to even their breath.
"Dad, stop, I can't breathe," Lily begged between laughs and gasps for air, so Draco stopped and hugged her.
"Are you ready?" Harry asked once they were ready to go out to the world, he could see the anxiety in Draco's eyes, but also the excitement which only meant he wanted to do this but he was scared, and Harry knew how to deal with that kind of fear. So he took Draco's hand and smiled warmly.
"I don't know how muggles can do that all the time, how does it work without magic?" Draco asked while they walked inside the mall, and before Harry could answer the blond boy got distracted by everything, wanting to learn more about anything he could put his hands onto, when they finally reached the cinema Harry bought the tickets and they entered the room. Draco was so excited, practically bouncing to their seats, Harry had to give him the bucket of popcorn so the other boy stops fidgeting so much. Once the movie started the grey-eyed boy gasped loudly.
After that they got into their costumes and went Trick-or-treating for a couple of hours, the toddler was too tired by the time he arrived home, he has shown both boys his new ability, he could change the form of his nose now. Then he proceeded to change his hair colour the same hue as Draco's, and Harry had to explain to him that he only did so with people he felt comfortable with.
In the end, Draco knew what he had to do, deep down he always knew but was too scared to admit it was the best thing for the both of them, for him and most importantly for Harry. He had put a lot of thought into this, even before Harry confessed, but the green-eyed boy caught him unprepared so he had to take more time, and that sucked because the least Draco had was time to lose.
In the end, it was Potter who won the stupid dare with his perfect calming draught, and maybe he took a small vial of that without anyone noticing it, just maybe. But you couldn’t blame the boy, his own potion was okay at best and if Slughorn swore one drop would kill them all then it meant that it was good, right? And it’s not like Malfoy planned to kill someone with it, he just wanted to have it in case he needs it.
The first thing Draco did when he opened his eyes was to look at his right where Harry’s bed was, the black-haired boy was still sleeping so he admired how different his face looked without glasses. He had been watching Harry since day one, and Draco was glad the bag under the boy’s eyes disappeared after their first month in Hogwarts.
"You sure think a lot, I wonder about what if you never seem to do homework," tease the blond and Harry laughed.
But not everything was that bad, he was really enjoying his time here, so was Ron who was really excited to tell his mom about everything he saw and decided to bring her a lot of souvenirs that he and Hermione bought. And talking about her, she changed a lot her way of dressing, you could tell that she wasn't the teen who fought a war in jeans and a sweatshirt, rather she looked so classy and what Pansy called 'preppy style', whatever that was, it really suited her. Harry was glad his friends had a good time with Draco's, because he was going to marry that boy and he didn't want anyone to feel uncomfortable around each other.
“For being the chosen one you’re actually really oblivious, I wonder how you didn’t die at your first year at Hogwarts,” and when Harry answerer ‘Hermione’ the blond laughed. “Of course it was her, she’s amazing… but you’re even more amazing and I would be a fool to not take this chance to feel love… but I’m scared Harry, so fucking scared,” and with that he started to cry hiding his face in Harry’s chest
"It's okay, that was a mistake, we're together now, I need you to go and look for Hermione please," Harry begged and once she doubled check this information with the pale boy and he nodded she exited the bathroom.
In the end, they decided to forget about those sad stories and began to heal from them again, Harry wanted to take Draco to the London Eye, and so they took the subway there. Draco was so confused by how it all worked and got visibly uncomfortable when people kept bumping onto them or standing a little bit too close at the wagon. But the experience was so worth it when they got to see the whole city from the compartment.
"Are you sure you want to go?" Draco could see the concern in Harry's eyes, but he tried to ignore it for his own good.
There had been a lot of doubts along the way, but in the end, they make it work, it's no secret that very few people had hope that their relationship was going to last but either they love proving people wrong or they were really meant to be with each other. Draco likes to think it's the latest because at least that way he could feel like all his regrets ended up being part of something bigger than what he was able to understand at 16 years old.
"You suck as well Potter, I'm trusting you my best friend and be sure I'll kill you if something happens to him"
“But I’m your dork” and they kiss again because maybe the tips of their fingers are blue from the cold, but their lips are red and warm from all the love they feel in that moment.
The first thing Harry noticed when he woke up is how pretty the room looked with the daylight entering from the window, he also noticed that Neville was gone and the Hufflepuff guy was still sleeping. Rubbing his eyes he cast a tempus noticing it was early, breakfast was just starting and he wondered why Hermione hasn’t come to wake Ron and him up yet, but when he noticed Ron’s bed was open he figured the couple wanted to have some time alone. Sighing he begins to change to his robes and that’s when he realized Draco must still be asleep.
"I didn't think this would get wrong, it was a safe choice," Draco began to explain and Harry hugged him tighter.
"I just feel like I'm the fucked up in this relationship and I'm afraid I'm pulling you down with me," explained Draco against Harry's chest and he felt the other boy sigh and pulled away a little, Harry laid down properly beside him and hugged him again.
“Are you sure you want me here?” Draco asked as he played with his hands not looking at Harry’s eyes.
“Well, it’s a place where people live, you know? Like Hogsmeade” joked Harry and Draco punch him lightly in the arm and Harry laughed loudly, “well, to be honest, if I explain it to you it’s going to sound really weird so why don’t you come with me?”
“He wanted to have sex,” he started, his voice low and raspy from all the crying, his forehead leaned it Harry’s shoulder. “And I was okay with it, I mean, sex is great, you know? But after a few minutes of what he called foreplay, I was not getting the reaction that he expected and he got mad, maybe I’m too broken to feel like that anymore, you know? But he didn’t care, I mean, it’s a miracle my mother managed to make this deal when it’s well known among the followers of the dark lord that all I ever did right was suck dick” he said as he laughed drily.
"I mean, it's not that I want to go, but I feel like I need to, you know? I mean, I just want to know where I'm standing and what am I supposed to do after I find out" Draco finished to button his shirt and grabbed his coat, "I just need to know Harry, please don't be mad"
The first time Draco Malfoy was scared of his father he was 5 years old and broke a glass at dinner, back then he didn't understand the feeling he felt, but now he can't remember a lot of his childhood without feeling nauseous. Mother tried to reassure him, telling him it was okay, that it was an accident. On the other hand, father just looked at him with disappointment and made him clean the mess he made, he still has small scars on his hands to remind him of that day.
“Thank you, Harry,” said Draco hugging him quickly and entering the common room quickly, when Harry entered he was long gone but the missing robe of his was enough for him to agree that that just happened and that maybe he had wanted to hug the boy back.
"Why didn't you tell them it was me? That night at the manor, I know you knew it was me but I just don't understand"
"Can we watch a movie?" The way Draco asked reminded him of Teddy when he asked to extend his bedtime, so Harry couldn't help but smile sweetly.
"You dork," giggled the blond and grabbed Harry's cheek with his left hand, "I love you too, I love you more than you'll ever know, I never imagined this was what the future held for me, my whole life had been planned even before I was born and suddenly I got to make all these choices and all of them always led me back to you, so it's hard to regret my past when I'm not sure if you and I would've ever existed without it," Harry just stared at Draco, not knowing what to say but relating so much with the words.
"It's annoying, I'm capable enough to survive by myself, thank you very much," pouted the grey-eyed boy and Harry laughed earning a soft punch on his shoulder.
to portrait, and I was as big of a git as you were, so," Harry paused but continued to pet Draco's hair, "I guess I did it because I wanted the opportunity to ask you all of the questions that remained unanswered since day one, and I wouldn't have that opportunity if you ended up in Azkaban, where you didn't belong no matter how low of yourself you think."
The blond didn't lose time as he managed to pull down Harry's pants along with his underwear, all their insecurities were left behind and all that was left was pure lust. Harry stopped abusing Draco's nipples and made his way down until he met the blond's underwear, which he quickly removed freeing Draco's hard cock. He kissed it lightly and Draco couldn't help but threw his head back, and his back arched as his hips thrust against Harry's mouth, which he took as an opportunity to take Draco's dick in his mouth sucking it slowly, it wasn't big enough for Harry to choke on it but he could feel it in the back of his throat, he felt his boyfriend squirm under him so he grabbed him by the hips holding him in place while he continued to suck.
"A picture would last longer, you know?" Harry's voice interrupted Draco's thoughts, making him blush slightly
In the end, Narcissa got house arrest for 2 years, Lucius was sentenced to Azkaban for 4 years and Draco was on probation, thanks to McGonagall he got the chance to go back to finish his studies, the fact that one mistake was enough to put him on Azkaban was not said but definitely implied. So when the 31st of August came the feeling that maybe this year was going to be a good one was slightly disturbed by the fact that Draco was going to be there, and the mark of his forearm was a constant reminder of the hell everyone has been through.
"I wonder the same thing, but I'm too scared to tell you about my feelings," answers Draco and falls asleep immediately, the only thing in his mind is how different Harry's hands feel from Theo's, so loving yet kind of rough. Like he could rip his heart out but treasure it forever protecting it from any harm.
“I won’t lie and say I didn’t enjoy the attention from time to time, but most Hogwarts became my home from the moment I put a step on it, it is still my home, to be honest, I dreaded coming back with my muggle relatives so much that at some point I remember thinking that maybe getting killed wasn’t such a bad idea anymore” Harry’s voice was shaky and he knew he was on the verge of crying, but it felt so good to tell this to someone other than his therapist that he didn’t care about the consequences of it. “I mean, now that everything is over I don’t think like that anymore, I have bad days where everything gets too much or I have nightmares about things ending up different, but I think I’m getting better so I don’t think I ever wanted to die but rather I just wanted a break of existing, you know?”
"Can we have pizza? I've been craving it since the couple at the moo-vie ate some," the blond pleaded and Harry laughed nodding.
Before they decided to adopt her, Draco was scared, because lets be honest, either of them grew up in suitable households. Draco grew up being spoiled to death and Harry was neglected as hell, and even when one could think that finding a middle point between those situations Draco found it really hard because he wanted their kids to have everything their little hearts desired but he also wanted them to be humble and to earn their things instead of growing up demanding them.
Even though the dark mark was almost faded, it was still there, haunting him 24/7. Reminding him of what he did, everything that happened, the suffering of everyone that was caused by the side he and his parents were part of. Draco tried to remove it countless times, from cutting to burning, and for a while, it felt so good, Draco couldn't care less about the scars that were left behind and even if he could remove with magic, he didn't. He enjoyed the reminder of being in pain, it was a comfort thing. Theo noticed the scars and made fun of him, but in his words 'he was already too scarred by the war' so he should be grateful that someone still wanted him, even if it was just a physical thing.
“Potter,” said Pansy, looking at him with a look full of suspicion and all Harry could do was wave at her with an awkward smile at what she rolled her eyes and took Malfoy walking about dragging the boy with her.
"Yes it is, but first I need your emotional support, I think I'm ready to talk about what happened with Theo," Draco said with all the confidence he managed and Harry tried to cover his surprise with a smile and offered him his hand, which Draco gladly took.
"Oh, do you want to talk about it?" Harry pushed a little bit more, if he was lucky Draco would actually talk about what was bothering him instead of eating his feelings away like he had been doing lately.
The train ride was quicker than expected, and after promising Molly he would be there for Boxing day he started to look for Draco, who was in a corner talking with Pansy.
"Oh, so I'm back to being Potter then, Malfoy?" Harry joked to calm Draco down, and it kind of work as the boy smiled lightly, but the nervousness was still present in the blond's face. "Do you trust me?"
year came by Draco felt so lost and when he looked for comfort in Theo he was just left hanging” Pansy said sadly “I’m just letting you know this because I don’t know what your intentions are, you don’t seem like a bad person and I know we owe you our lives and all that jazz, but I swear I would kill you if you hurt him, I don’t care if I end up in Azkaban for the rest of my life, if there’s someone among us who deserves happiness is that stupid boy and if he finds it with the golden trio then let it be it” she sighed and offered him a last smile before leaving the common room.
The next morning Harry woke up to a high pitch scream and got off bed so quickly he almost fell, taking his wand from under his pillow and running to where the noise came from.
"Dear good, I almost passed out when I saw that damn dragon, I thought you were hurt," was the first thing Harry said when he saw Draco standing outside the office
A couple of minutes later, Pansy left as well claiming that she and Daphne had important business to attend to, and Draco was alone, again. He wondered if Moaning Myrtle ever felt alone, if she ever missed being alive or if she had anyone to talk to.
"Well, you're a lot more useful than Ron who keeps eating the ingredients and than Hermione who gets crazy over the fact that cooking is more about feeling than measuring things," Ginny said while they sat at the kitchen table, he took his first bite and moan at how good it was.
"You used to be better at casting glamour spells, you know?" said Pansy when they arrived to the classroom. "And I don't really know why you bother putting them on, when you know damn well it doesn't work when people are truly watching you, and if you think that just because we avoid talking about certain things means that we don't care then you don't know us at all Draco, so cut the bullshit and tell what's going on"
"Just because someone had your back in the process doesn't mean we did it for you, love, don't put yourself down, you don't deserve it"
The talk kept going smoothly, even Neville and Seamus joined after a while, it really was the perfect day until someone entered the common room yelling Harry's name. In less than a second, he was in front of Pansy who looked white as a ghost and had trouble breathing.
Without thinking much Harry took Malfoy’s hands into his own and started to open them carefully, not wanting to freak out more the boy but stopping him from hurting himself further than he had already done. “Hey Draco, can you please look at me? Just for a moment please” he asked once he had secured both of his hands and his green eyes met the grey ones, they were full of fear, confusion and exhaustion but at least he had managed to make eye contact “Thank you, you’re doing so well, now, can you try and copy my breathing Draco? I need you to try it, we don’t want you passing out, do we?” he said softly and Draco shake his head trying to do as told.
Draco knew this was a stupid idea, don't get him wrong, he was totally capable of seeing how this could fail badly and exposed once again how little he cared about himself. Then again Draco was never known for making good decisions, let's remember how he took the dark mark and how he used to bully every single kid that crossed his way. But he also knew that he was tired of being a nuisance for everyone and that he needed to be careful with how much magic he was using to cover up his feeling and appearance overall because at the moment any side effects appeared, Hermione or Blaise would notice the stupid things that he did and Draco wasn’t in the mood for being scolded so he needed a plan for everyone to be distracted.
"I don't think I'm going to last longer Harry," moaned Draco and Harry took it as a sign to fast his pace fucking his boyfriend harder and deeper, which only caused for Draco to scratch Harry's back as he came hard, Harry following him seconds after. And for the first time in a while Draco felt so full and happy, he wanted to feel like this forever.
The spent a little bit more time in the tower until it was close to curfew, so they started to be on their way back to the common room, halfway the road Draco paused and stared at Harry. “You called me Draco”.
"A big day? Since when going to The Burrow is a big day? We've been doing it since we were 18 Potter," Draco complained, it wasn't a big deal.
Did Harry want to know? Was he ready for another piece in this puzzle? Remembering the screams and the tears and the fear in Draco’s eyes was enough for Harry to nod at Luna who started to put flowers in her hair.
"It was Sirius' motorbike, and I guess it's safe, I mean, if Hagrid could ride it when I was a baby so can we," he reassured the boy and offered him a hand, "Do you trust me?"
Because Quidditch has been a constant in Draco’s life since he can remember, and he was good at it, only Potter managing to beat him, which was a constant reason of punishments from his father the prior years. But it wasn’t his fault, he really tried to beat him, he even stopped eating so many sweets in hope that if he lost weight he would be faster, but that only ended in hospital visits due to faint spells, not that he ever told anyone about what he was doing.
“Oh yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen is a curious little potion, known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly known referred to as-”
After 10 minutes of reassurance and several failed attempts he finally managed to calm the boy, his shaking was no longer from the attack but from the cold, so after asking him is he was feeling better he took his robe off, putting it around the smaller boy, smiling at the sight of it basically swallowing the blonde.
"Make love to me?" Draco asked in a small voice and all Harry could do was smile and kiss him softly on the nose. "Please,"
"You also learn that when you live in a house full of death-eaters," muttered Draco and regretted doing it, anytime he talked about that time of his life people either told him he deserved bein scared of it because he chose that path or they gave him a glance full of pitty and changed topics.
"Thank you for inviting me tonight," said Draco as they walked back to Hogwarts, "I had a lot of fun, and it was nice to know a part of my family who wasn't involved in the dark side"
"Okay," and they kissed again, "so just you know, my amortentia smelled like mint and apples, I never knew why until I smelled you in the mornings"
His thoughts were interrupted, once again, when he started to feel a pair of wandering hands on him, he started to feel lightheaded but he couldn't pass out now, not with him here. But then nausea became too much and Draco started to struggle against the strong grip, he didn't realize he's shouting until he feels Theo release the grip and passes out.
Harry just laughed, Draco loved Harry's laugh, it was so carefree and not so loud, it was perfect. He has seen Harry's personality evolve through the years and one thing that never changes it's his laugh.
“It’s okay, it doesn’t hurt and it’s almost healed anyway, but thank you Luna,” said the boy offering her a small smile and continued to stare at the plate in front of him.
Until then he enjoyed the story of Draco’s best Christmas while both sitting on the floor, Draco between Harry extended legs and unexperienced fingers braiding platinum hair.
They ate while chatting about the movie, and how they hated the ending. It was already dark outside when they left the building so Harry decided to apparate them instead of taking another cab back home. They both sat on the couch and started the first episode of British Bake Off, Draco was mesmerized by all the pretty desserts and Harry was just hungry, so he got up to make something easy for diner.
Con – He forced Harry to study and sadly he could be very persuasive, more than Hermione who was just scary to say no to.
And so both of the boys shared a simple breakfast while making a list of all the thing Draco needed to experience on his stay, and all of the presents Harry had to yet buy because he was a procrastinator by excellence.
the older he got the less physical contact his mother provided because it was improper for a pureblood to be hugging his mother at the age of 10, only weak boys did so and no Malfoy would be cataloged as a  “weak”.
He dragged his feet across the room, deciding that a quick shower could solve his problems, deep down he knew this wasn't true but there was no harm in lying to himself. What he didn't expect was to see the perfect face of Harry, his green eyes filled with sleepiness still, and his pants hanging dangerously low from his hips, Draco still couldn't figure out how Harry went from a scrawny kid to this Adonis. How he managed to get so tall was a mystery, and how his back became so wide and his skin tanned nicely during the summer, his strong hands and his beautiful abs and-.
"Mo-vie, it's like a theatre play but you can watch it again and again, at any time you want from the comfort of your home.
"You know, I tend to do a lot of stupid stuff but this time I have no idea what you are talking about," half-laughs the blond and another voice chimes in.
Then why was he summoned here? Why did all the weight of his family suddenly settle on his shoulders? Why must he do this for a master he never intended to serve? Why if he hadn’t touched the Dark Lord it suddenly became his? He didn’t want this, please someone make it stop… but of course no one did, no one dared to say anything about his marred forearm, not even his mother. He quickly learned that his father wasn’t the scariest thing in the world like he had thought all this time, no, that place was quickly replaced by his aunt and the Dark Lord, and all the others, but worst of all, by his mother. Because it scared him to death how the only person he ever loved and loved him back, turned their back at him while he begged not to be chosen for this.
“I- I would love that, Harry” he answered after a few seconds and then turned his attention back to Hermione who was already telling him his mistakes.
"You pure-bloods sure like to set fire to things," It was Ron, who may have already get used to the whole situation but never wasted an opportunity to make a sassy remark.
“You deserve better than you give yourself credit, but I know you won’t believe me no matter how many times I tell you,” Harry said as he stood up from the cold floor offering a hand to Draco to do the same. It took all self-control Harry had to not make a scene when he noticed a recent bruise in the form of a hand around the boy’s wrist, and after a deep breath he let himself say “you know you can talk to me, right?”
Soon his thoughts were interrupted by steps, if the room wasn’t so quiet he wouldn’t have heard them, but he did so he turn his head to see who was it. When he recognized the frail figure of his roommate he said a quiet ‘hi’, the blond barely acknowledges it but begin to come close to Harry anyways.
"When you looked over your shoulder, for a minute, I forget that I'm older I wanna dance with you right now," Harry sang softly in Draco's ear and the blond tried to fight the tears, it was their song, but instead of crying he just rests his head on Harry's chest and continued to dance in small steps. "Just say you won't let go,"
"So do I, so do I," mumbled Draco against Harry's lips and they began to kiss again, and if it wasn't because one of the Ravenclaw girls threw a book to them yelling for them to get a room, Draco was pretty sure Harry's lips wasn't going to be the only thing he would be tasting that night.
“I don’t know! But it all feels a little bit odd, with his father in Azkaban and his crazy family on the run I wouldn’t be surprised if he was as crazy as his aunt,” Harry sighed, yeah okay, maybe it was a long shot but his gut tended to be right most of the time in stuff like this.
Harry felt uneasy when he saw Draco sitting on the sill of a window in the tower, his feet hanging to the abysm where their old headmaster had fallen, his back was facing him and Harry loved the way Draco’s hair was longer now and slightly wavy, unlike his father’s straight one.
"That's so fun! It's way more interesting than a feast" Draco said laughing and started to eat his sandwich.
Harry nodded and Draco lifted his shirt, there was a big scar across his chest, near his heart. It was full of hatred and misunderstandings. Harry's trembling hands traced the scar and a couple of tears hit his bare chest.
“It was when I was at the manor, I was not scared, in the end, I knew that we were at war and that could happen. They fed us whenever they remembered and sometimes it got cold, but Draco always tried to sneak more food and some blankets, he got in trouble for that so many times, I still remember his screams and that makes me sad. But he always tried to smile to me, and chat with me sometimes, most of the time they forgot he existed, he always told us he was sorry for everything, and his eyes were so sad.”
“So don’t go, come with me, we don’t have to go to the Borrow if you don’t want to, we can just stay at Grimmauld’s and spend Christmas together”
Draco learned that cooking was a lot more alike to potions than he realized, and he loved learning from Ginny, she was so funny and loved to joke around, it reminded him of the twins which always made him laugh with all the pranks they pulled, but he was too proud to admit it back then, what a shame if only he could do things differently.
"Well, people change Draco, and that's okay. What it's on us is if whether we want to do good or bad changes, and so far it feels like you're stuck being what people expect you to be rather than what you are, I can't keep going pretending that you're fine, because that's not what a true friend is, so if I were you I would get my shit together before other got theirs and leave you behind," said that black-haired girl and left the classroom, her firm steps resonated in the empty room just like her words did on his empty soul.
“Maybe Granger did the whole thing and he just took credit,” suggested Crabbe but Pansy shook his head
"May I be retired?" The grey-eyed boy and his mother shoot him a look full of fear. "It's getting late and I'm sure our guests are tired as well"
"And that's why I love being with you, because I've always just wanted to be me, not the chosen one or the golden boy, and when I'm with you Draco, I'm just me, because you see me as who I am and not as who I am supposed to be, so please don't try to be what you think I want, because if I get to be me then you should get to be just you as well."
“So you mean it? This is not a joke, right? This is actually happening and you actually love me,” said the blond more to himself than to Harry. “Oh Merlin, you
"Well, either you start talking or I don't know what I'm going to do because Nott's father is not going to be happy once he finds out his son was beaten half to death by you and Mr. Zabini"
"Clouds? That's a soft name for a dragon, I love it," the boy with glasses teased the other one and the blond laughed. "Yeah, it was him, he sent a message in a fireball and I knew something was wrong before the message was cool enough to read it. You cast Fiendfyre, the aurors arrived minutes later after I did and your mother had already cast the counterspell. Theo and his dad were nowhere to be seen and your father was too shocked that I was crying over your still body. You burned to arm, Molly helped Hermione fix it, so it shouldn't scar... not that you could really notice a scar in your arm"
Sadly their holidays came to an end tomorrow, and o-fucking-course something had to ruin them for he and Draco, because when they returned to the house (more like mansion, but accordingly to Blaise this place was too small for being call that), there was an owl with a letter waiting for the blond.
“Hey,” he said softly “is already morning, and breakfast already started if you wanted to come down with me to the great hall” the boy wakes up and the fear of his eyes pained Harry, it took a couple of seconds for Draco to realize where he was and when he locked his grey eyes with Harry green ones he visibly relaxed and nodded.
Harry started to laugh and begin serving milk in a glass and deciding whether he fancied something salty or sweet for breakfast.
Where we learn about the bruises in Malfoy's face and Pansy decides that maybe having the golden trio around is not as bad as it sounds.
Noticing that he no longer had anything to do in the library, he decided to go back to the 8th year common room.  Once he arrived he saw Ginny chatting with Ron, so he decided to join.
“Well, if I get killed because of this stupid mission I promise to come back as a ghost so you don’t have to be lonely.” Because Draco never learned how to make friends, but he knew what it felt to be alone and no one deserved that, not even ghosts.
but he likes to believe that his birthday should last a week so he has small celebrations all the week, so even though this year his birthday lands on Saturday we start celebrating since Monday,” Harry answers and proceeds to tell the name of the reservation, once inside the restaurant he placed Pansy and Blaise, and now he understood what Draco meant by ‘you should use some of that money you have to learn and dress nicer'.
"Well, considering how much Lily screams I think we can handle a bit of noise," joked Harry and Draco smiled, their daughter did scream a lot, she says that it makes her feel free and more heard, and as long as it's not hurting or annoying anyone other than Draco, they don't really see a problem.
Draco wished it was as simple as that, because now that he was sitting of the big table he felt as if nothing had changed. The food was flavourless and each sip of water felt heavy on his stomach. He hate the look of lust Theo had, and how he smirked knowing that Draco couldn't do anything about it without facing the consequences of it. And that there was no one to help him, Draco was alone, more alone than never before.
“It amazes me how you noticed me doing that when you were always snogging with Dean,” he said and she blushed but then proceeded to kiss Luna on her cheek as in saying ‘well at least I got my mind together’, and again she was right.
About an hour later Harry decided that he had given his boyfriend enough time to calm down, so he smiled to Hermione and before heading to his room he went to the kitchen to fetch some macarons that Pansy bought. Once outside the door he knocked, it's not like Draco would lock him out of his room but at times like this it felt better to ask rather than suffer the consequences.
"Well, I don't know a lot of things either, but if you want we can learn together," the green-eyed boy smiles and Draco looks at him with wondering eyes
"No, I can promise to not pity you, but feeling guilty is my right and never for a second think that you deserved it because no one deserves that Draco, not even the vilest person in this world."
Draco woke up in the infirmary, where once this strong euphoria was nothing, he felt numb. He was scared of opening his eyes because he could feel Harry's scent next to him, and he was too scared of confrontation.
"I'm sorry to hear that father, I had already accepted someone else's proposal and it would've been rude to cancel at last minute"
"I have a present, I was too scared to give it to you but then I remembered that moo-vie we watched, Tangled? And Rapunzel would not be proud of me if I hold back just because I'm afraid," Draco said in a quiet voice catching Harry's attention, they had been finishing their potions essay for the last hour and now the common room was empty aside from a couple of Ravenclaws.
"Harry James Potter, just because magic exists doesn't mean you get to make a mess every single time you come back home from work!" Draco reprimanded Harry, he could be such a child sometimes, and that was saying a lot considering they had a toddler who likes making a lot of messes.
"I know babe, I know," and they hugged again, that was until someone screamed that they wanted a glass of water.
"What's going on?" Draco finally asked and he immediately had his boyfriend on his side taking his hand.
He began to wonder in the corridors and ended up in the owlery, it had been a while since he came here, since Hedwig died he didn’t want to do anything with owls. He always kept some treats with him for the owls that brought him his mail and stuff, but he still needed for that wound to heal completely.
There were a lot of issues with Draco, more than everyone knew. He had been trying to avoid the talk about his issues with food, he had realized that eating diner beside Ron worked so well because of fucking course his stupidly small portions would look normal in comparison with his, the downside of it is that Hermione was really observant and Draco was scared of the moment she will confront him just like she did with his shaking hands.
and yes, they were only boys, they both had to do what they needed to survive but after he saw Draco at his trial he wondered if he was trying to survive at all. His once perfect silver hair was unattended, his grey eyes were too dark and his skin looked sickly pale. He remembers him just nodding and waiting for it to end, not a single drop of hope in his face, not even when Harry started to tell the ministry that Draco has saved his life two times.
Draco saw fire and felt heat before passing out when the whole scenario began to change from the Manor to another one.
"Honestly? I didn't think about it, it didn't felt different from other times, well, it did but not in a new way. I honestly feel like this was the last push my mom needed for my mom to go crazy, I should go and talk to her, she shouldn't be alone, I feel like being so strong always really tired her out and now it's my turn to be strong," he paused for a second while taking a seat beside Harry "but I don't know how to be strong Harry, I'm not you nor her, or Ginny or my aunt, I'm more like my dad, a coward and I-"
"Gins? What's that? Some kind of charms that I don't know of?" he asked with his head tilted to the side and Harry smiled
"Smooth Potter, but if you don't mind I would love to leave out your sex life from my memories," said Pansy half-disgusted and half-amused.
“Because sometimes I feel like the war is not over like I’m never gonna escape the nightmare,” he sighed, “I tried to continue my life you know? I tried to accept the fact that me a Theo was going to get married but it hurt so much, so much” the boy started to cry, retracting his legs and hugging them in an attempt to comfort himself.
And maybe Harry could hold onto that image for a little bit longer, what he didn’t know was if he was doing it to make the other boy happy or because it felt better than not understanding, but when he woke by awful screams a couple of hours later he realized that holding on an idea was a stupid thing to do and that he needs to get close to the boy before everything else became too much for the both of them.
"It's not about who had it worse darling, is about how we cope with it, there were many times where I didn't know what to do, or who I was. I had nightmares almost every night and I felt so anxious all the time," he started to tell as Draco started to play with his fingers, "but it got better, it was really hard and I wanted to give up many times, but I didn't because I wasn't alone. And you aren't either Draco, you're not alone," Harry mumbled against the blond's temple before placing a soft kiss.
“A word, please?” he asked Draco and after a quick exchange of looks with Pansy, he grabs the boys arm, not wanting to let him go. But, when Malfoy nodded to Nott and offered half a smile to his friends before he left Harry, they both understood that there was nothing he could do to make the other boy understand that he already made the mistake of living to someone else’s expectations once. And honestly, Harry didn’t understand his need of doing it again, but then again, there was a lot he didn’t understand about Draco Malfoy.
"I do, but I think I'm falling for someone, and it's scary but also exciting," Harry pauses and takes the blond's right cheek in his hand, "and I can't help to wonder what would happen if I pursue what my heart wants and tell this person about my feelings"
Draco felt blue, he always felt blue and sometimes grey, just when he was with Harry he felt yellow and red. But he was angry, he hated that not even potions could make him feel happy, did he did it wrong? Maybe he added too much peppermint in his try to counter the side effects, he learned this from Snape but lately, his mind has been drowsy and nothing really makes sense. What could go wrong if he took a second those? There hasn't been a case of overdosing by this elixir, what's a little bit more happiness when you have none left?
They finally arrive at the new potions classroom, Slughorn refused to be at the dungeons like Snape, if it wasn’t because of Dumbledore’s mission he would’ve never taken this stupid class, hell he didn’t even buy the book because he was sure Snape wasn’t going to allow him to take the class due his ‘Exceed Expectations’ at his OWL’s. Yet here he was, at this stupid class, with no book and not the slightest idea of what he was supposed to be doing.
In other times, Draco would be offended by the comment and would try to fix up his appearance as quickly as possible while making a rude remark about her looks as well, but honestly, Draco was too tired of appearances and couldn’t care less about his hair, he was busier trying to find a way to fix the stupid cabinet, he had been trying for 2 weeks already and he was nowhere near to fixing it, Borgin’s instructions only helped so much. And let’s not forget that if he wanted to keep the level of excellence at school (the kind that gives you Outstanding and Exceeds expectations level in your O.W.L’s) he needed to study harder than before.
“I think Harry can give us more to avoid our blackmail” answered Seamus not noticing Harry was already awake.
He had managed to adjust a pair of jeans for Draco to use, otherwise they were going to draw a lot of attention with all the fancy clothing. The fact that Draco scolded Harry for not owning any good clothes was better left unsaid, he didn't want to ruin the mood by saying that the Dursley's didn't believe in buying 'nice clothes' to Harry when he could just use the old ones from Dudley. He waited for him and Draco's nausea to go away and begin to walk to the main street. And the face the blond made was the best thing he has ever seen, he looked like a little child in a candy store. His grey eyes were so bright and even if he was a little intimidated by the unknown he was eager to learn.
They had been married for 5 months when a raid had gone wrong and a family of wizards died leaving behind a little baby girl, normally the Ministry would take care of that but, as Harry liked to tell the story, '
“Three? I only remember that day at the manor and when you threw you wand to me on the final battle.”
“It’s okay to be scared, I am as well, I’m terrified of you finding out that being with me is not worth the gossip and the constant hate remarks from the Prophet and others, I’m scared you’ll find me stupid or not handsome enough but for you Draco I would do the impossible”
And at this point, Draco Malfoy feared life way more than he feared death, if it wasn’t because of the stupid love he felt for his mother he would throw himself out of the window the second he was left alone, and that was almost never. Between Oclumensy lessons with Bellatrix, long study hours about curses and poisons with his mother, and what Greyback liked to call “stress relief sessions” that left him bloodied and dirty.
“Yeah, I know… but maybe I like the idea you have of me in your mind, and I want you to hold onto that for a little longer” the grey-eyed boy answered realizing Harry’s hand and offering him a small smile before grabbing his pyjamas and heading to the bathroom to change.
Draco stopped walking and tilted his head to the side, confusion evident in his face. Even though they had been friends for almost two months the blond still felt weird to be asked out together, sometimes he still thought it was like in the old times and he once told Harry he was still waiting for all this to be a joke. But at that moment Harry could see that Draco wanted to say ‘yes’ but didn’t know how so he offered an inviting smile to him and with that the other boy nodded.
“Yeah, c’mon, the more the merrier,” said Ron with a small smile and Draco nodded slowly not really knowing what was going on but letting Harry guide him inside.
The sorting took longer than the trio expected considering that no more 4 months ago there was a war, but Harry was happy to see that Hogwarts was still a home for a lot of people, the feast was full of chatter in all the tables, cutlery noises and a couple of scares from the first year’s due headless Nick appearances through the table.
“Really? Harper is going to be over the moon with this, that kid had been trying to take your spot since forever,” Blaise said before leaving, and it was true, maybe in another life Draco would never let this happen, but lately flying only made him feel sick and nauseous, and besides he had more important things to do.
So far no one had noticed anything, then again once you start to do alright people start to notice fewer things about you. Like how these past two weeks he had been using glamour to cover up how badly he had been sleeping, or how he only ate at breakfast and dinner, and never too much, just enough. Because that was Draco's current goal, he wanted to be just enough for people to stay, just enough for Harry to keep loving him and just enough so he could graduate.
And just like that Draco Malfoy kissed him, he tasted like chocolate and strawberries, his lips so soft and unsure. Harry tried to deepen the kiss but he felt the other boy pull away.
"How could you love me when I'm so broken?" The grey eyes started to fill up with tears again as he asked it.
“Oh no, they’re to repel the Gulping Plimpy’s, such cute creatures but they like to nibble on your feet if you want to swim” she answered with a smile and then turn her look to the boy sitting next to Harry “oh Draco, where did you get that bruise from? Seems a pretty nasty one, do you want me to heal it? I once healed Harry’s nose and it turned out just fine”
"First of all, I don't put up with you, I do all of this because I care and because I love you, and second of all, I do it because you're worthy Draco, even if you don't believe it now one day you'll see how much you're worth it." Harry teared up and Draco dried the tears with his thumb, caressing the green-eyed boy's cheek.
It has been 2 weeks since them and Halloween was a couple of days away, Pansy and Hermione grew to be best friends and there have been slight changes in the later girl, and Ron loved it. He’s always telling about how he loves Hermione having more confidence in herself, and how pretty her hair looked since she changed her hairstyle, and how he loved her long nails, and how different she looked with her more fitted uniform.
“Liquid luck,” Hermione interrupted, oh he sure didn’t miss how she loved to interrupt everyone in order to prove she was smart, and quite a bad habit she had there.
“It’s not about what I deserve Harry, just what it is and this is happening whether I like it or not so the least I can do is to not make it difficult, no one likes a difficult person to deal with.”
“Well, it’s a good thing I brought this today,” Harry said with a soft voice trying to not startle the boy who looked lost in thought, but failing miserably as the boy jumped in his sit due the disruption.
“Because I deserve it,” he answered without thinking and when he realized what he had just said he covered his mouth with his hands and started to panic.
"You could get that tattoo, I still think a pygmy puff would look so good on you," said Ginny with a serious face and seconds later Harry started to laugh again and Ginny joined.
The incident, as he decided to call it, with Malfoy remained unmentioned and other than a few exchange of meaningless words he hadn’t really see him that much, not even in their dorm. For the first time he felt at peace and like a normal teenager, and it felt good but he also missed the adrenaline of being needed for something. So when Sunday night came and Pansy appeared crying her eyes out he did what he knew best, offer his help.
"I hope you don't plan on murdering me," was the first thing Draco said once he met Harry at the front of the house
year and he was a mess and I’ve seen him grown so much these last months that I don’t want to be the reason why he gets back to his old self-“
Harry still wasn't over the fact that Draco was his boyfriend, if someone had told him that this was going to happen he would've laughed so hard and maybe sent them to St. Mungos in case they had a tumour on their brains… wait, do wizards even know what a tumour is? Not really the point, but yeah, Harry couldn't help but fell in love a little bit more with the boy each day that passed.
Harry was about to talk when the trolley lady came to offer sweets, at which Ron smiled begging Harry to do the same thing he did in the first year, so a couple of minutes later their wagon was filled with all kinds of sweets. Hermione began scolding Ron for eating so fast and so many sweets, saying that he was going to get cavities, Harry saw a small smile in Malfoy’s face and that made him smile as well.
“Didn’t know you smoked” was the first thing he said when he saw the boy sitting on the ground with half-a-cigarette between his fingers
"Do you know how to cook? I've been craving my mom's Treacle pudding and even if the house-elves one is pretty good nothing like doing it with the secret recipe," she said once they arrived at the kitchen.
"I only have one scar left, the other ones disappeared with potions and lotions, do you want to see it?"
“Not to worry, get what you want from the cupboard. Now as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be?,” he continued as the two friends entered the classroom, there were only two books left and of course, Ron ended up with the most decent one.
"Hey, are you okay? You've been really quiet since I arrived, I'm really sorry about the mess, I know how much you hate when-" Draco kisses Harry in order to shut him up. "Well, I won't complain about your shushing methods, but my question still stands," the black-haired boy smiles while caressing Draco's cheek.
“You are a horrible person Draco Malfoy, how dare you?” a voice shouted and you could hear it come closer each word “how dare you to leave me alone with Blaise being quiet most of the time because he was reading his stupid book and Theo being an asshole as he always is! If it wasn’t for Daphne I would be death from boredom” Pansy hit Malfoy’s shoulder as she finished, Harry saw a girl grabbing Parkinson and telling her about not hurting the boy.
The blond sighed, there was a lot of things he needs to do, he had managed to steal a bit of Polyjuice potion a week ago, as he needed Crabbe and Goyle to stay outside the Room of Requirement for him to be able to get out safely, but it was quickly running out and if he started to borrow too much then Slughorn would definitely notice. He needed to brew some, and sadly the best place to do so was in the second-floor girl’s bathroom, no one liked that place because of Moaning Myrtle, and don’t get Draco wrong, he didn’t want to be there more than necessary but in order for her to not rat him out he needed to be polite, which bring us back to the beginning, Draco Malfoy never learned how to make friends.
"I think I'll take to the Aurors now, the sooner I do the quicker we get rid of them," and with that Harry was alone again.
So he laughed lightly when he felt a small hand on his shoulder, Harry puts his own hand over Draco's and squeezed it lightly. He felt Draco sit beside him and he just let himself go and hug the smaller boy, he doesn't know why he was being so emotional, but the fact that he could feel Draco's spine and ribs under three layers of clothes made him cry harder. They stayed like this for a little bit, it felt like hours but it couldn't have been more than 10 minutes, the street was empty but he honestly couldn’t care less about someone finding them out like this. At that moment Draco felt like home and the thought of it scared Harry but instead of running away like he would’ve done some years before he just embraces that feeling and accepts the fact that maybe he was falling in love with the git.
"We're not going to put our kids through hell, right?" asked Draco trying to joke, but the pain behind that question was evident.
“I do, but I like to cast a patronus and talk to it when I’m having trouble with my thoughts” Harry answered leaning on the wall while putting his elbows at the sill Draco was sitting, “why?”
"Oh my dear, I've missed you so much," was the first thing Narcissa said as Draco entered the dining room, it was still full of bad memories, no matter how many times it had been cleaned the smell of blood reminded him of those dreadful days and nights full of screaming and begging.
"Cold," the pale boy stuttered and Harry took off his sweater and wrapped Draco in it, trying to not touch Draco's cuts that, even if they weren't bleeding anymore, would sting if he did so.
The 1rst of September came faster than he wished, lately, his sleeping schedule had been worse than usual, barely sleeping more than 2 or 3 hours per night, and even then, his appetite was barely there, and the constant reminder of his inevitable failure creeping in the back of his mind. He really wasn’t joking when he told Pansy that if he had to pass another year in this hell he would throw himself out of the Astronomy Tower. But of course, nothing ever happens the way he plans it, because once again, Harry fucking Potter was a step behind him, so close to catching him yet not managing it, oh how much Draco wished for him to be caught, maybe death in the hands of the savior or his order would be more merciful than life in the hands of his family and their master. But in the end, villains always had the worst end possible and the quicker Draco gets that in his head, the better.
“I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt Draco, but I never thought I would live to see you in this state,” Pansy tried to joke, but the concern was evident in her voice, “like, seriously, when was the last time you brushed your hair?”
"Are you going to finish the job?" the blond asked once Harry was next to him. "I need you to finish the job Harry, please do it," he was hysterical, his hands were trembling so much as he grabbed Harry's sweater
And of course, he would be miserable, things would get awkward between them and the perfect relationship both of them had created will be gone, his safe space would disappear because he wouldn’t be able to go to the Astronomy Tower as often as he did now, being in the same dorm would be an agony because Harry never closed his curtains and whenever Draco couldn’t sleep he just had to glance at the sleeping boy beside him to calm down.
“Look, things change, and it’s on us to make a change. I won’t let you do this to yourself because you don’t deserve it, and even if you think you do I won’t let you because I care about you and I’m going to care for you the way others didn’t” Harry said quietly and Draco starts to sob again, not frantically for loud enough for Harry to hear.
It was late already, the game lasted a bit more than anticipated and while they were heading back to the castle Draco felt his heartbeat too fast again, and his vision blur as well, he knew this was wrong but today had been so good and he didn't want to ruined it.
Gladly, Draco Malfoy was smart, so smart and good at reading situations, years of surviving out of instinct had thought him that there was always another way to make things work, maybe not the way he wanted it but also to avoid the worst-case scenario. So he decided to appeal his case and asked for a task for him to feel “worthy enough” of such privilege as taking the mark meant. Luckily, the Dark Lord accepted, surprised by this new-found loyalty in the youngest Malfoy, but of course, good things don’t happen to him, because fixing a cabinet was an easy thing, killing the headmaster (one of the most powerful wizards in the whole world and history) that even his oh-so-called-master feared, well, that was a death wish.
“So you found out about Harry’s feeling in what? A month? And it took you YEARS to figure out I liked you? You’re bloody impressive Ronald” She laughed and he punched her lightly on the arm
"And then what? You get the money, that you don't need and a status that you also don't need, instead you're left with a person who despises you and ties you in a marriage neither of us really wants."
Watching her helping Draco made him understand that maybe he wasn’t a bad student but rather she just sucked at explaining things, Harry couldn’t figure out how Draco was getting all the things she was saying but he and Ron could never keep up with her and her brain.
Harry tried really hard not to feel out of place while they were strolling down Paris streets, but it was hard not to when his boyfriend kept speaking in a foreign language and asking for his opinion about clothes that, before their relationship, he would never see or wear. Of course it had its perks, because seeing Draco so free in the outside wizarding world was a sight he would pay to see forever, and the way he roll his r's did something to Harry that required thinking of Filch using a thong to calm his thoughts down.
' and that was enough for them to fight for her. It was hard to say no to the oh so great saviour of the wizarding world, so once it was official there was no family member who wanted her they adopt her, now 2 years late, she has such a big personality and Draco just wanted to hug her and protect her from everyone and everything.
They both knew it wouldn't be too long until the word spread around everywhere, The Daily Prophet wasn't as bad as they expected it but some on the comments still hurt. Harry was still scared about what could happen to Draco if everything became too much, no matter how many times the other boy reassures him that his scars were old and that whenever he thought of relapsing or if everything felt like too much again he would tell him so, and he also was a little bit calmer now that he was certain Clouds was there for his boyfriend.
"It really does, am I right? When I feel homesick I come down here to do it, I started doing it because it was one of Harry's favourites but then Harry became part of my family so I just did it to feel closer to home"
"I know love, I know," he answered and rubbed their noses together, "I love you Draco Malfoy, I really do"
And so Draco decided that everything he touched must be his, or else it would hurt him. Maybe that’s why he never touched his father because he wasn’t his and it hurt, but later he also learned that his father didn’t need to touch him for it to hurt, sometimes he still longs for the physical pain. He also learned that his mother, even though it was
And so they began their journey, Draco felt weird being alone with her, but he also felt so at ease, it was like it was them against the world, everyone was looking at them but not because she was with an ex-death eater, but because
“Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love. That would be impossible, but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession. And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room,” explained the old man, this was going to be a long-ass class.
He was so in love with the green-eyed boy it hurt, he had no need to fake his smiles around him like he was thought to, he could speak freely about whatever came to his mind without fearing for his damn life, he loved how he felt safe around him and how natural their intertwined hands felt. But he also was scared, what if Harry wanted to have sex with him right away? Draco would say yes either way because that’s what you do for people you love, right? Will Harry care about his scars? He had so many, even if some weren’t so noticeable Draco knew they were there, and then there was his arm, the skin looked so scarred it disgusts him.
“Oh, I already knew, I mean, the fact that I found you two sleeping together in your bed was enough for me to confirm there was something going on,” Ron said and Hermione raised her eyebrow
"Thank you," Draco answered after a while, he had cried at some point but now they were just in comfortable silence. "Your turn"
"No, I'm not okay but I will be, we both will be," he answered truthfully and kissed Draco's temple.
“What hurt, Draco?” and even if Harry had some ideas of what could’ve happened he had learnt to not assume things when he could just ask, but Draco just started to shake his head, the signs of a panic attack where clear so Harry just did whatever came to his mind first, and he cast a patronus lighting up the room. He saw the wide eyes of the blond as he tried to reach it but not really managing to, then he looked at Harry and smiled lightly, he was shaking so much that Harry was scared he was gonna fall, so he reached to Malfoy and when he checked it was okay to touch him he took his hand pulling him slightly so that he was now facing him instead of the abysm. Draco let go his legs and lets them hang from the sill, leaving just enough room for Harry to be between them while he hugged the heck out of the blond.
Draco never learned how to make friends, well not properly; he was an only child (maybe if he had a sibling a lot of things would’ve been different) and never learned how to share or how to
"Okay," the silver-eyed boy stuttered and took a deep breath before nodding and taking the hem of Harry's shirt, "but you first" and with that Harry's shirt was gone, and soon after that Draco's one was too.
“Then you’ll have 30 seconds to explain to me why before I decide whether to punch you or him,” they both smile and stand up from the stairs, “good luck, bring back a little bit of douche confidence, being so anxious doesn’t suit you, leave that to Neville.”
The next days were pretty much the same, it wasn't until Friday's night where something happened. It was past midnight when Harry heard a knock on his bedroom door, putting on his glasses and securing his wand on his hand he asked who was it, the door opened slightly where Draco's face appeared.
Sadly the shower didn't take Draco's problems away, and his headache evolved to nausea and feeling quite weak, not that he was the strongest person in the world, but now it was just pathetic how weak he felt. Thankfully he just had 3 classes today and none of them required a lot of movement, he just needed to make it to the Great Hall and eat something so he doesn't pass out in the middle of a lesson or something.
Stupid kid, he was stealing his boyfriend with cute words, not that he was wrong, but still. Ever since Draco entered Harry's life a lot of things seemed to change for the better, first one was that for the first time in his life he learned how magic money and Gringotts worked; he also learned that the Prophet might be a stupid-ass newspaper full of lies, but when needed it could be very useful (like when he needed people to understand that he wasn't under a love potion or being blackmailed by Draco). And finally he began to understand that nothing was black or white, rather grey, even when he didn't agree with a lot of pureblood traditions Harry now understands the reasons behind them, and well, sometimes it makes sense.
They had two weeks off due to Easter and they had a lot of plans, which included: Teddy's birthday party, a weekend at the Burrow and a week off at Paris, apparently, the Malfoy's had a villa there and Pansy really wanted to go shopping with Hermione, saying that she should start dressing as the beautiful and empowered woman she was. Harry just wanted to be away from everything and a change of air sounded good.
