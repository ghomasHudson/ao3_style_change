Several hours later, Harry and Draco made their way, giggling and leaning on each other, up to Gryffindor Tower. The Fat Lady clicked her tongue at them when they gave her the password, but she swung forward to let them enter.
“Protecting him.”
“It’s true.” She walked back over to him, then raised onto her tiptoes to kiss him gently on the mouth. “I wanted you to keep me company like this.”
“Ron’s not wrong,” Draco said, which caused Ron to look up in surprise. “We are rather brilliant.” He lifted the corner of his mouth in a satisfied smirk.
“Of course,” Pansy blusters. “I’ll let you take lead on that for now. In the meantime, I’m going to start putting together an evidence board.”
knows,” Harry said. Seamus threw up his hands in defeat.
“Draco,” Narcissa said slowly.
“Slightly less upset that he knows about us?” Harry hazarded. Draco’s mouth twisted to the side while he considered this.
“You’re the one who after sixteen and a half years of being a good, obedient son, has turned him into a rebel.”
“Why the fuck did McLaggen tell me he arrested you last night?” Pansy hisses in Draco’s ear the next following day at work.
This is a dance they have done before. Harry arrives at Flourish and Blotts before the end of Draco’s shift and Draco tries to stock shelves while Harry tries to distract him in various ways since they are in public. And when they are in public, Harry seemingly can’t keep his hands off of Draco. Occasionally, Witch Weekly, or some other such magazine, manages to get a picture of them through the store windows. Joe and Luca get excited when this happens and then spend the next few days tailing Draco around the store, hoping to make it into a picture themselves.
“My pajamas are there,” he said. Ron scowled at him for a moment before turning back to Hermione.
“I'm sorry,” the brunet said. “I overreacted.”
Apologies for the delay in this chapter - the holidays were busier than expected, however I should be back to my normal schedule now.
“Right, yes, of course,” Harry says. He drops Malfoy’s hand, walks over to the sofa and sits down. Malfoy watches him for a moment before sitting down next to him. None of them say anything for a long moment. Eventually, Greg gestures at the two of them.
“You changed,” he said. The brunet was now in a grey suit, his hair neatly parted (a first for Potter) and was wearing an eye patch. “Are you,” he started to ask before realizing he could not remember the character’s name. “That guy? You know, my underling?” he finished, gesturing wildly with his hands.
“But you’d better behave.”
“You were invited to that?”
“Good,” she says. “Are
“We are going to briefly question you under veritaserum,” McLaggen says to Draco once they are safely ensconced in the Ministry.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I prepared for him to be the Master of Death, which would allow him to live again.”
“-Hit wizard? Yes, he figured it out.”
“I think Hermione might be on to something.”
“Ugh,” Draco said. “So much
“We think someone has turned your mother’s diadem into a horcrux,” Hermione said.
Between the pasta course and the main, Harry decides to broach the subject of the Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes crackers. Draco looks concerned but Lucius and Narcissa appear delighted. Which means either that they
“Knut for your thoughts,” Neville said, sitting down next to him. Seamus blinked and brought himself back from his memories.
“I mean, you could just leave,” Blaise said.
“Forcing your child out of the closet before he’s ready is mean, even if you’re doing it with love and support.”
“Today we will be training with veritaserum,” Hermione says, watching Draco carefully for a reaction. But he remains professional, his face neutral. It seems that it is only Harry who is nervous about this. He is, of course, worried that someone will ask about their relationship. He knows that it is possible to resist veritaserum - that is the whole point of the training - but if anyone asks about them before any training has happened... Well, it doesn’t bear thinking about.
“Definitely naughty.”
“Are you sure it’s a good idea to show the Slytherins the Chamber of Secrets?” Hermione asked Harry on Thursday morning as they were walking down to breakfast.
“Please, call me Blaise.” Terry narrowed his eyes but nodded slowly.
“Oh, yeah, he is. Refused all of my advances.”
“I think Snape is my new hero,” Seamus said. Ron made a disgusted face. “Do you not feel better, Ron?”
“Polyjuice is harder to detect,” Pansy allows. “But it’s December 17
. “Tea, please,” she says. “For four.”
“We will?” he squeaked. He wriggled out of her arms and looked up at her with wide eyes.
“No rush.” He grins at her. His whole body is suffused with the warmth of the holiday and he feels utterly Hufflepuff-ish as he gazes fondly at Hannah. But that’s not really a bad thing. The Draco from school might have thought that it was, but this Draco knows better. She plonks three glasses on the bar in front of him before hurrying away again with the promise of seeing him later.
“We’ll figure it out,” she said.
“Manners, Potter,” Snape said. Harry looked back down at his lap again. “I plan to ask Mr. Malfoy to join us as he too is quite a skilled Occlumens, and he may be able to explain things to you in a way that I cannot.”
ask.”
Draco waits until he hears Greg walk down the third flight of stairs to the ground floor before he walks back over to the book. Pulling it back out of the box, he feels the thrill in the pit of his stomach that comes from knowing he is doing something he shouldn’t be doing. The book thrums in his hands. He starts to open it and then stops himself.
“Is this alright?” Harry asked as he managed to undo the top button of Draco’s trousers.
The house is quiet when they arrive. Greg is either asleep or out, and Draco can’t tell which. It feels decidedly odd arriving on the landing with Potter. He had done it so many times with Oliver, that for half a second, his body expected to see his sandy blond hair when Draco turned his head towards the person beside him.
“Perhaps she doesn’t want to put me in danger?” Draco suggests.
to believe it.” Weasley winks at Harry in a way that is meant to seem casual but Draco can tell that he is still unnerved by their relationship.
Draco awoke to a bright light. Or at least he thought he awoke. He wasn’t sure he existed. But he was thinking, and wasn’t that the saying? I think, therefore I am? So he must be
“Happy Christmas,” he cries and Greg turns on the Christmas carols.
A ripple went through the students, and Harry looked around to see what had caused it. He saw that Dumbledore was now standing at his seat at the teacher’s table. The Great Hall quieted as if the headmaster had cast a silencing spell.
“What’s funny?” Hannah asks.
“I think I am all pokered out,” Hermione said, pushing away her hand.
“December twenty second,” Draco says and Hermione gasps and sags in his arms. A sob escapes her lips.
“Yes, General, I went in wands blazing. I imagine I will hear the Muggle sirens at any minute now.” She pauses again and strains her ears. Sure enough, she can hear a wail starting to pick up in the distance. “But I secured the asset.”
“Get out of my mind, McLaggen,” Pansy hisses. She grits her teeth and slams down the hardest defenses she can. McLaggen physically flinches as she forces him out of her mind.
Pansy is now shaking slightly with suppressed laughter and Draco knows that it is because she thinks she orchestrated this turn of events. In a way, she did. Potter chews his lip for a moment.
“Kreacher,” Dumbledore said. “Do you still have the other locket?” At this, tears welled in Kreacher’s eyes again.
“Good, I brought sandwiches. I thought we could take a stroll down Diagon Alley.” This sound like a bit of an odd idea, so Draco immediately thinks there must be something else behind it.
“Right,” Greg says, nodding. “When you brought him home to meet them after your first date. Blimey that was fast.”
“Clearly,” Blaise agreed. “And now you’ve made us your accomplices.”
“I don’t work Mondays,” Draco says. Pansy practically cackles with glee.
“Now, you I can understand inviting,” McLaggen continued, as though Harry had not said anything. “But Weasley? What did he do to deserve an invitation?”
“Is there any chance of more doughnuts?” Neville hazarded. Dobby snapped his fingers again and five more doughnuts added themselves to the tray.
“Well, perhaps just as friends. But go on.”
“Dancing,” Seamus said firmly. After all, Justin was still around somewhere. “At least for now.” A wicked smile crossed Cormac’s face as he followed Seamus to the dance floor. It was a smile that both excited and scared Seamus. It always had.
“No,” Harry says. His tone is exasperated. “You two are impossible. Professor Quirrell tried to kill my by throwing me off of my broom.”
“One would think that,” Terry said. “But she’s not. She won’t even help with homework. Not that I would need help.”
“Alright,” Massi says. “But no one fucks me, ok?”
“You’re not going soft, Harry. Just because you like someone,” Ron said gently. He laid a hand on Harry’s arm and gave it a small squeeze.
“And,” Draco said softly. “It means we can use the broken pieces as a template. Of
“But not
And so Seamus had asked the room for some dark corners, for doing dark deeds. The room had complied, even adding curtains to obscure the corners further. Thus, when his dancing with Justin began to edge towards the more risqué, he took the other man by the hand and led him over to the corner where they were now making out.
“Well,” Harry said. “I suppose you could talk to Justin about it. He knows.”
“Go on, Major,” she says once she is seated next to the fire.
“It’s fine. I get it. My family is the same way. I mean, have you heard of the Malfoys before?” It is perhaps stretching the truth, but Draco runs with it.
“Sorry,” he says. He turns to walk out of the VIP area. “I’ll let you know if I hear any more about those murders. Or houses, or whatever.” He sounds so defeated, Pansy almost caves.
“Darling, it’s fine,” Pansy says, brushing it off. “I outrank you both.”
Back then, Potter had looked tired, like he hadn’t been sleeping well. He looks better now. His skin is golden and his green eyes are bright behind his glasses. Draco’s not sure what he’s been doing with his time, but he’s clearly been active — it shows in the cut of his shoulders and the fit of his trousers. Draco finds himself staring and so he stops, turning instead to look out over the city as well.
“Hello,” Draco says once his mouth is no longer otherwise occupied.
“Shoo,” he yells at it, waving his hand in the direction he wants it to go, but it clearly can’t hear him over the noise it’s making. It advances further, coming within inches of his toes. Draco jumps to the side and the creature moves past him.
Harry groaned. He didn’t want to work with Draco right now. He knew Draco couldn’t have had anything to do with the attack, but he figured it was more than likely that his family had been. He felt sick. In the last two or so weeks of their dating, Harry had pushed aside all thoughts of the senior Malfoys and their psycho boss. But no good thing could last forever. Reality always seeped back in. He and Draco were going to have to have those difficult conversations that they had been skirting.
“What’s he done now?” Harry asked.
?” Pansy shrugged.
“I mean, like what are we allowed to do? To convince people that it’s real? Can I kiss you? How handsy are you? If we’re in the same room, in a casual situation, where do we sit in relation to each other?”
“Fuck.”
“So, the night after my father was sent to Azkaban,
“Oh no,” Blaise said. “This isn’t going to end well.” But both Pansy and Ron were nodding enthusiastically.
“How did you go to the wrong house? You’re a wizard for fuck’s sake.”
He takes a deep breath and tamps down the fear. He has a plan. He’s pretty sure it’s a good plan.
“Well, Ron and I have Quidditch practice tomorrow night,” Harry said. Pansy rolled her eyes, but Draco nudged her.
He knows that he is going in the right direction as the surveillance spells start to appear more frequently. Most of them are just camera spells, so he walks past them, safe under the invisibility cloak. However as he reaches the door he wants, he slows as there are tangles of spells guarding it.
“So what you’re saying is that you’ll teach us all Occlumency then?” Harry asked after a long moment. Snape sighed.
“No,” Harry says. “I’ll do it now.” He lets go of Draco and waves his wand. An entire bloody stag bursts forth and Draco is now sure he has never seen this before. Surely that hadn’t been Harry’s patronus when he was thirteen? Surely Harry hadn’t been able to produce a full patronus when he was thirteen? Though, with everything Draco knows about Harry, it probably had been.
“I’m sorry,” Harry gasped in between bouts of laughter. “Diagrams.”
“Draco sacrificed himself for me,” Harry said.
Harry leans in and kisses him softly. His mouth lingers on Draco’s for a long moment before he pulls back again.
been on a date when she’d found them. Fuck, if anything bad came from this, it would be her fault.
“Yes, Longbottom,” Snape said. “Even
and Potter’s a pretty great catch.” Malfoy turns his head and frowns at her.
“If that’s fine with you,” he said. His palms were sweating now, and he surreptitiously wiped them on his trousers. He had no idea where this nervousness had come from. He had never felt anything like this before. ‘But this matters,’ he told himself. ‘For what is probably the first time.’
“Yes, if everything goes to plan, I will move in in about a month.” When Draco doesn’t say anything, Harry continues. “Did you want to come and see it?”
“So he can confirm their authenticity?”
Draco picked up the Cup from where it sat on Dumbledore’s desk and set it on the floor. Then he walked back and took the proffered sword. It was heavier than he would have anticipated. The ruby in the hilt must have been real, he mused.
“What do you know about the Reliquary?” Draco keeps his face impassive but his heart rate picks up. Why the hell is McLaggen asking about the Reliquary?
“OK,” he says. “It’s just a theory right now.” Pansy narrows her eyes. “But it’s based on an overheard conversation.
“Dad,” he says. “You next.”
“General,” she says, inclining her head.
“What is it?” Harry asked.
They made the front page of the Prophet the following morning.
“His wife died two months ago, also apparently from natural causes.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“That’s ok,” Draco said quickly. “I do. Or, kind of. I, well, I got a book out of the library.”
“Sorry, Nigel,” she says. “I’m stealing the whisky.” Nigel puts on an exaggeratedly sullen look but hands over the bottle. Pansy takes it and makes her way back to her seat. Nigel chooses a different present from under the tree to replace his stolen gift, but Pansy pays him no mind.
“What?” Neville cried.
but the betrayal still stung.
There are days when Pansy wishes they had stayed friends, but then she remembers how withdrawn and miserable he was in their sixth year
“Exactly.”
Outside it was much the same. People had either left the party, or coupled up. But it appeared that Draco had other ideas in mind, as he bypassed the seating area and went straight to the door that Harry had accidentally conjured up earlier. He pushed it open and stepped inside. Harry looked around furtively and then followed him.
“But we have reconciled our differences,” Potter said.
It had seemed more urgent as of April, when the news came that there had been a mass breakout at Azkaban. The dementors, it seemed, had abandoned their posts and joined Voldemort’s side. As the months progressed, the news in the papers had become more and more grim. There were disappearances and deaths reported almost daily. More than once, Harry’s lessons had been interrupted by a somber Professor McGonagall, who had come to inform one student or other that a family member had either vanished or perished. It had been a bleak couple of months, and with every passing day, Harry became more and more impatient to
“Does this mean that you died too?”
rules.”
At that point, he was saved from further conversation with Neville by Harry sitting heavily down next to him. Seamus glanced sideways at him as the black haired man started spooning various things onto his plate. He banged each spoonful down with more force than was necessary and there was the crease of a frown between his eyebrows.
“If you want.” Harry looks suddenly shy. “I mean, I don’t want to pressure you into anything you don’t want to do.”
“I don’t know,” he admits. He frowns and takes a large sip of his whiskey soda water. They lapse back into a silence that’s broken only by the tinny sounds of Christmas music that is being piped throughout the pub.
letters. Herbert Pike, Harry Potter: HP.
“That was very foolish,” Snape said, surprising no one.
“So it seems like we’re going to need a Hand of Glory of our own then, if we’re going to get out of this unscathed.” Draco nods. “I don’t suppose you still have yours?”
“What do you think?”
He cursed everything from friction to hormones to Malfoy’s bloody perfect arse as he gently eased his trousers down around his thighs and then breathed a sigh of relief as he began to slather the lotion on. The pain immediately melted away, and not for the first time Harry was glad that he was a wizard and that magic existed.
“Really?” McLaggen asks.
“Aren’t you?” His shoulders drooped.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not for Muggle bugs,” Harry says, pulling a handful out of his pocket. He also pulls out his wand and uses it to spell the bugs onto unseen places on all of Hermione’s clothing that he can see.
“Oh yes,” Pansy says sarcastically. “Let’s just send the Reliquary into the heart of the secret society.”
“His cover is that he’s dating me, Parkinson,” Harry says. “Not that we’re a threesome.” Pansy shoots him a withering glare but joins them at the table. They sit and Harry taps his wand on a small box in the middle of the table. The box glows and then projects an image onto the blank wall in front of them. It is of an office. After a moment, Granger comes into view as she kneels down next to what is presumably the fireplace.
“Yes, you do,” Harry says. Draco‘s heart stutters.
“That explains basically nothing,” said Ron.
She would have been amazing with all that information. That is to say, she would have been even more amazing than she already is.
“Seriously?”
“Yes, Harry?”
But for some reason, the idea of pretending to be spies stuck and they spent the next few hours keeping up the charade. It made it feel less like work and more like a game, though, they both agreed that it was a very serious game. They were serious spies and this was a serious potion, so they had to get it perfect. Somewhere along the way they gave each other code names, and then began giving codenames to their friends, even though they weren’t in the room.
“Sure,” Draco said, a smirk playing around his mouth. “Sure that’s the reason why.” But he obliged, waving his wand at his head until the bald illusion melted away. Harry immediately brought his hands up to run them through the silky locks.
“Professor Dumbledore was widely known as one of the greatest wizards of our time, but I knew him best as my friend.” McGonagall paused here and she brought her hand up and held her closed fist over her mouth as she fought to compose herself. “There will be time to mourn him — and mourn him we will — but we don’t have that luxury right now. Instead, we must prepare for the coming fight. When you spoke to your head of house this week about your allegiance in the war against Voldemort, they will have given you instructions on what to do should there be an attack at the school.” She looked around at the students, her eyes sad. “Regretfully I just inform you, that with Dumbledore gone, an attack is coming.” Whispers broke out across the hall. “I know that you have observed the various, ah, improvements we have made to the castle throughout the week,” McGonagall continued.
Neither Potter nor Pansy answer him. They are still staring at each other. Potter slowly brings his hand back to his side.
“Yes, you do,” Pansy says. She reaches a hand out and picks up the telephone receiver. She punches in 62442 and waits until the floor beneath them begins to move before replacing the phone in its cradle. She turns to face Draco, freeing up a small amount of space between them. She pokes him in the rib.
“You two are behind,” Severus said to Potter and Malfoy. He had gone to their pod after visiting Zabini and Granger, who, like Parkinson and Weasley, seemed far too chummy. But really, Severus supposed, any inter-house relationships should be cherished. Or so Dumbledore kept saying.
“There’s nothing to interrupt,” Draco said quickly.
“The most interesting part about that, Horace, is that they were nemeses at the beginning of the semester,” Snape said.
“That’s alright,” Susan says. She walks forward and perches on the sofa on Hermione’s other side. She takes the stethoscope from around her neck and uses it to listen to Hermione’s chest. Then she gets out her wand and waves it over Hermione, muttering under her breath all the while. Then she pulls some parchment out of her pocket and points her wand at it. The parchment fills with words and Susan scrunches up her forehead as she reads it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Though they ought to have expected it, it was still a surprise when Narcissa showed up to the Slytherin common room bright and early the next morning. It was made even more awkward by the fact that Draco wasn’t there when she arrived.
have been a legitimate ask,” he says finally.
“What is?”
“They won’t approve of me?”
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco said. He slammed his hands down angrily on the table. “What the fuck did you expect? You know who my family are.”
“We can always buy more if we need it,” Harry says with a shrug. “Plus, Draco, may I remind you that you’re a wizard. You can bring as much as you want with an undetectable extension charm.”
“What, so like the Room of Requirement itself?” Ron asked, remembering their conversation about the room from the other day.
“Come on,” she said, taking him by the hand. “Let’s add the next ingredients and then spend the rest of the day cheering each other up.” Ron nodded. He liked that idea. He liked that idea
“But,” Draco protested only there was nothing more to protest. Blaise was right. He just didn’t
Oh, Pansy.
“That is good,” he says. “That is not a no.” He smiles and reaches a hand out to cup Draco’s face. Draco tilts his head to rest it in Massi’s palm. “It means I will get to see more you you.” He shuffles closer to Draco on the bed and then leans in and kisses him quickly on the lips before pulling away shyly.
“But then shouldn’t she be at the Ministry?” Susan asks. Harry shakes his head.
,” Draco said pointedly. “What could the other items be?” Hermione pulled her copy of
Hermione and Blaise were on the fourth floor, running helter skelter with four Death Eaters on their tails. Hermione’s plan was to run to the corridor that contained the swamp, and then dash to the side in the hopes that the Death Eaters would run right into it, not knowing it was there. But they still had a couple of corridors to go before that point.
“Colloquius. Can you hear me? I can hear you.”
“Fucking McLaggen,” Neville said, angrily dropping into the seat next to Harry. He glared through the window into the main party space.
“No,” McLaggen says quickly. But he still won’t meet Harry’s eye.
“We were all like that, Draco,” Parkinson snaps back. “You were often the worst.”
“Yeah, we made out in the tunnel on the way back.”
“What is it?” Harry asks. “What’s wrong with her?”
“Right. I’ll be back.” He left and Harry settled himself at one of the tables against the wall. It didn’t take Draco long. By Harry’s estimate he was only gone fifteen minutes and in that time the old man at the bar finished one Firewhisky and ordered another.
haven’t been subjected to my great aunt’s questions about your love life.”
“I do too, but I don’t let him
and you said yes. I would say that constitutes as dating.”
“What are you wearing?” Harry asks.
“She mentioned something about taking the opportunity to have a nice long bath,” Draco said. The three Gryffindors gaped at him. “What? Weren’t any of you paying attention when she left?” Draco shook his head at them. “And you call yourselves her friends.”
“I’ll do my best.” Draco frowns but nods. Then he snuggles down in the bed next to Harry and they talk tactics until they both fall asleep.
“Brokeback Mountain.” Harry grins.
gave a small nod and they each threw back their shots. As they did, the common room filled with cheers. Harry wondered if it had been a test. Knowing the Slytherins, it probably had been. But seemingly they had passed because music filled the room and all of the upper years went back to whatever it was they had been doing before the Gryffindors had arrived. Welcome to the weekend indeed.
“You were?”
“He asked me what I knew about the Reliquary. Of course, I’d had your training the other day, so I told him I knew nothing about it, but it was unnerving to say the least.” Hermione nods. She is frowning again. “Then he asked me why I was spending so much time with Parkinson.” Hermione nods again, but doesn’t say anything. She appears lost in thought. She brings a hand up to her mouth and absentmindedly chews on a hangnail.
“Yes, I thought it would be too, but your aunt had other plans.” A flash of irritation crossed Narcissa’s face, which Harry found interesting. He had somewhat thought that Draco’s mum wouldn’t have minded having her sister’s friends over. But then he started to think about who those friends might be and he nearly stopped walking out of alarm. He reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand and Draco held it for a brief moment before letting go. It was clear that he was unwilling to show any overt signs of affection in front of his mother.
“What can I say? I like sex.” Massi reaches out and places a hand on Draco’s hip. Draco shakes his head.
“Interesting,” was all she said. He opened his mouth to protest and then shut it again. There was no point.
There came a knock on the door and Pansy spun around in irritation.
“If I may interrupt,” Snape said, interrupting. They turned to him. “Why don’t you concentrate on what a, how did you put it? Giant arsehole he is? Sure, it might make him angry, but if it’s something you believe to the core of your being, there are no holes to pick in that.”
“You know, I feel like I could say the same thing about you.”
“The one and same.”
“I’m not really sure what comes next,” he said, in what he thought must be the seven most unsexy words in the English language.
“I thought you had abandoned me,” he said. He did not add ‘like always’.
“Do you think Mother would allow me to go elsewhere for Christmas lunch?” Draco asks. In truth, he is a little concerned about Christmas lunch with his parents, but if their tea turned gin afternoon was anything to go off of, it should be civil at the very least.
“What about your gloves?” Draco reached into his pockets and pulled out the offending garments.
“Nothing?” she asks. He shakes his head. “Well, let’s report to Granger then.” She turns her eyes skyward for a moment and then walks to the door.
“That’s where you were, wasn’t it?”
“Don’t play dumb with us, Malfoy,” Luca hisses, trying to look threatening, but instead he merely looks short sighted.
“I don’t know.”
“Don’t be. It’s fine.” Draco turned to look at the bookcase and Harry turned his attention to it as well. Sure enough, Hufflepuff’s Cup was sitting on the shelf, behind the metal grille. Draco pulled out his wand and waved it in front of the grille. It opened out slowly. Harry held his breath. Draco reached out and picked up the Cup. Harry took an involuntary step backwards, convinced an alarm would go off, or the Cup would explode or some such thing. But nothing untoward happened.
“Don’t you also own the old Black house?” Draco asks as they make their way over to what is presumably some sort of sitting room - probably because the room is devoid of furniture, save for some built in bookshelves surrounding a fireplace. There is a large bay window looking out onto the street, and a connecting door to what might be a dining room on the opposite wall.
“-No, Potter, I don’t,” Pansy say, cutting him off. “Because we weren’t friends then.”
“Hi,” Harry said. His arms were full of books and parchment and his ink pot was perched precariously on the top of the pile. Draco pushed past him to get to the door first and Harry went sprawling down the corridor, books, papers, and ink flying everywhere. Daphne Greengrass shrieked as a glob of ink hit her square on the face, turning her cheek blue.
“I don’t actually want to know, Granger. It was rhetorical.”
“Yes, it does,” Blaise said. “In fact, the other day, they walked in on Pansy and-” And then Blaise stopped talking. Hermione looked up at him, wondering why he had fallen silent.
“What reason do we have to doubt Potter?” General Dempsey considers this.
“Harsh.”
“You know us — always up for some mischief.” As he said this, Fred winked.
“It’s protocol for ex-Death Eaters,” he says quietly. Harry feels a flash of anger go through him. McLaggen is not his favorite person at the best of times and he seems to be enjoying lording his power over Harry. Harry is itching to pull out his Unspeakable badge, but there is no point in blowing his cover over something that appears to be a common murder. He blows a hard breath out through his nose and nods.
“Come sit down, son,” he says. “You know how your mother is.” Draco looks helplessly over at Harry, but the other man is already making his away over to the sofa. Draco sighs, beaten, and sits down next to Potter. There is a an uncomfortable silence as they all stare at each other, and then Narcissa asks again,
“-Most of?” Snape asked sharply. Hermione clapped a hand to her forehead.
“Uh, I normally sleep in my underwear. I don’t actually
He supposes he could try summoning them, but in his state, he’s just as likely to get them halfway up the stairs before his magic just gives up. He lets out a small sob. Mother is going to kill him if he’s late.
“Yeah, weren’t you?” Justin shook his head. “Oh. Well, what do you say? Be my date?” Seamus felt like he was copping out by asking Justing out to only one date as opposed to full on asking him out, but Justin seemed pleased enough. He readily agreed, and then they stood there, Seamus awkward with his hands in his pockets and Justin shifting his weight from foot to foot. Which was precisely why Seamus had preferred their random drunken hookups. Far less awkward.
“Yes,” Draco said. “And?”
Once the door is shut, Draco goes back to panicking about packing. He rushes up the stairs and Harry tell that he is rummaging through the closet by the clattering of hangers that he hears. He sighs and shakes his head before following the blond upstairs.
“And you said
And speaking of Harry, he found the brunet standing in the antechamber to Dumbledore’s office, along with Ron and Hermione. Draco frowned as they came into view. He was now even more convinced that they were being called here because of their ill advised trip into the Chamber of Secrets. He should never have let Potter acquiesce to his demands to take them there.
It took the better part of the day, but Dumbledore and Snape brought the six of them up to speed on all that they knew. Harry felt like Dumbledore was still holding something back, but he couldn’t be sure. At any rate, Harry thought he knew all that he needed to about horcruxes to be getting on with.
“I just thought - the banter - that it was flirting.”
“Oh,” Pansy says, chopsticks paused halfway to her plate. “I hadn’t thought. What do you reckon, Potter?” Potter shrugs. His mouth is full.
He put a hand up to his head and tried to flatten his hair down, to no avail. Then he took his glasses off and put them on his bedside table. He squinted at the mirror, everything much fuzzier than it had been a few seconds ago. On second thoughts, while he thought he looked better, he wasn’t sure he could stand not being able to see distance all night, so he put the glasses back on. Shrugging at his reflection, he left the room and walked back down to join the others.
“I still can’t believe you talked to a snake while you looked like me,” Pansy grumbled. “What if she tries to talk to me again?” Harry had not thought about this. It hadn’t been high on his list of worries at the time.
“Yes, OK. What did you think I was going to say?” Harry asks, a smile playing across his lips.
“Well, he clearly didn’t say no for long.”
“Uh, would you,” he started. But then he stopped.
“Why are we leaving?” Draco asked.
, Blaise, in case you had forgotten.” Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared at his house-mate. Hermione frowned at the three of them. She was clearly running through spells in her mind. Harry could tell by the way she was staring somewhat at the middle distance to the floor and her eyes were flicking back and forth, as if reading some invisible book.
“Mm,” Draco says. “Were you jealous?” He turns until he is facing Harry. Harry keeps his arm wrapped around him.
“It still felt wrong. I don’t care about Pansy. I mean, I do but not in that way.”
“I can’t speak for your father, but I certainly don’t. Not after this summer. Not after what he’s done to our family. He’s corrupted my sister, threatened my son—”
“What?” Massi cries. Draco feels the imperius lift and he’s not sure if it’s because he’s fought it off or because Massi has lifted it out of shock. Draco sits up straight in his chair, furious. He doesn’t want to make a scene, but he sure as hell wants to put Massi in his place.
“I beg your pardon. I most
“I won’t.” Pansy almost salutes, but she senses that the meeting is not over yet.
“Master Draco,” it squeaks. “What a pleasant surprise.”
“Thank you, Harry,” he says.
“I ascertained that from the shit ton of blood comment,” Pansy says. She looks down at Draco’s display and straightens a book pile. “Did you stop to think that perhaps you shouldn’t run into a house with screaming people in it?”
“Oh, yes,” he says. “That. Some diplomat was poisoned, but he’s fine now. I didn’t want to bring it up last night because I didn't want to worry you.”
“Eh,” Pansy said. “To acquaintances that might become friends if you all don’t irritate me too much.”
Draco is nervous as they cross the threshold, and he reaches out and brushes his hand against Harry’s. The contact puts him more at ease. He is with Harry. Harry won’t let anything bad happen to him.
. Draco clapped a hand to his mouth.
“How d’you feel about spag bol?” Potter asks, thankfully changing the subject.
“I worked bloody hard for it,” she snaps. It is clear she has been asked this question more times than she would have liked.
“I’ve always found it strange,” Hermione said after a minute of searching her mind for a place where they could go, and coming up blank. “That all of the common rooms have such different doors.” Blaise cocked his head to the side and looked at her with interest.
“Mr. Malfoy.”
“Because you and I…” he trailed off.
“And she didn’t say where she’d been?”
“What are you trying to say?”Draco asks.
“I’m impressed,” Harry says.
“Merlin, that’s rough,” Seamus said. “Are you going to be alright? Or is the savior of the wizarding world a eunuch now?”
“Thank you,” he says. He glances to the chair next to him where Harry is sitting and sees that Harry is beaming.
“I can’t believe it,” he whispers, picking up a scroll of parchment that had been lying there. “I can’t fucking believe it.”
car. It’s a beautiful, sleek Bentley sports car with a cream colored leather interior, replete with stained walnut trim, and Draco adores it. His mother calls it impractical, but she would rather Floo everywhere anyway. She doesn’t understand the calm that Draco finds in speeding down empty country roads, hugging the curves in the road and watching the fields flash past his window.
“I owe Seamus a beer because he dared me to ask you out in the first place, which led to me being terrified to lose you too.” He pressed his knee into Draco’s leg, trying to convey how much the other man meant to him without telegraphing their feelings to the rest of the world.
“Is there any reason we don’t just go to places with these backgrounds?” Draco asks. They are wizards after all, and could apparate anywhere they wanted to.
“He won’t.”
“Circe, you’re insane.”
“What is going on?” Draco asks as they run down the corridor that goes past the kitchen. There are screams and crashes coming from the restaurant behind them.
“Right,” she said. “I don’t suppose there’s a place where the three of us could have a private breakfast, is there? Normally, I would suggest Hogsmeade, but after your little newspaper stunt, it would be best if we were out of the public eye.” Draco looked at Harry, a frown on his face.
Harry finds him in the master bedroom up the stairs. He is sitting, perched on the side of the bed. He looks up when Harry enters the room and Harry can see that tears are threatening to spill from his eyes.
“Please don’t tell anyone,” Draco said quietly. “My father-”
“Then you should wear it,” Draco protested, trying to push it back towards Harry.
“It’ll be fine,” he said and she nodded.
“Harry,” Hermione says once he has left. “What the fuck is Cormac McLaggen doing here?” Beside her, Ron snorts in amusement.
When he reached the common room he saw that Harry had taken off his invisibility cloak. When he saw Draco, he made to put it back on again, but Draco shook his head.
an Unforgivable, and I just— I don’t know if I can do that.”
“Come with me.”
“I take it you killed Nagini?”
“Do I want to know?” Harry asked, narrowing his eyes.
Indeed, when Draco enters, Hannah immediately points to the backroom. Draco rolls his eyes but smiles at her. He spots the gaggle of press at a table near the VIP door and pointedly ignores them as he walks by. He wonders if Harry has seen them and if he will therefore insist that they go get drinks at the bar “like regular people” so that they can be seen with Harry’s hand in the back pocket of Draco’s trousers or some such thing. It’s not that Draco minds these extracurricular activities per say, but sometimes he wonders if Harry is trying too hard. Or if Harry is looking for any excuse for intimacy.
“Professor Snape is in the Common Room. He wants to see us.”
“So you and Dad have had a bet that I would go out with Harry Potter since I was eleven?” Narcissa gives him an embarrassed smile.
“She’s my girlfriend,” Blaise said.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand and nodded once at him. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see the others exchanging glances. Now the real planning could begin.
“What’s that?” Burlington asks at a normal volume.
“Oh,” Hermione says. “Draco sparked on something.” Draco had let Harry sleep in this morning, so Harry had not been there for the morning’s newspaper reading. Hermione sighs. “Well, I suppose this meeting can go on without me.” She pulls out her wand and sends several messages in quick succession, one to Pansy telling her to meet them at the Cooler, one to McLaggen letting him know to expect them and one to the organizer of her meeting, informing them that she could no longer attend.
“And I thought you Slytherins were supposed to be cunning. This seems far too out in the open for you.” Draco arched an eyebrow at him. Then he took the cloak out of Harry’s hands and, looking around to make sure everyone’s attention was elsewhere, threw it over them.
“Or outright daring them,” Ron added.
“We came here because I couldn’t stop thinking about you,” Draco says. He takes a step towards Massi.
.” At this, Potter’s eyes flick away from his again and a flush creeps into his cheeks.
“I need to change. This is not clubbing attire.” He gestures down at his sweater and grey trousers. Harry smiles.
But Pansy is not deterred. She has been taking copious notes all day and she spreads them all out on the table once they get back to the Cooler. McLaggen is still with her and when she tries to tell him to go home, he shakes his head.
“You know there’s a reason we do it by hand,” Draco admonishes. The reason being that some of the books react poorly to magic. Poorly being the polite way of saying that some of the books explode, fly away, change colors, catch fire, turn into animals, vanish, etc when exposed to magic.
“Harry!” the tall muscular man cries. “Long time no see. Where’ve you been?”
“Planning next year’s halloween costumes,” Blaise said quickly. This was the agreed upon lie they had come up with, but now that he said it, he was worried it sounded stupid. Terry clearly didn’t though as he was nodding thoughtfully.
“If we could get the students to a safe place,” Harry said, trying to steer the conversation back to the plan to get rid of Voldemort. “I think we could successfully lure Voldemort-” everyone flinched “-here and defeat him.” Snape looked as though he was about to say something, so Harry ploughed on. “Think about it. It’s an isolated location, where we know the terrain and the layout. We have the advantage.”
“Fetch my wand and some veritaserum,” Massi tells the elf, who nods and disapparates with a loud crack.
Pansy’s eyes widen in shock. Her first impulse is to slap him again. Her second impulse is to tear all his clothes off and have him bend her over the table. Her third impulse is to slap herself.
“Perhaps,” he relents. “But I’d prefer you not do it again.”
“He could always wear flats,” Pansy said quietly.
“So I take it the Simurgh Society is
“Yeah,” Harry says with a shrug.
“Harry, hi,” she says. “What can I help you with?”
“Be either very early or very late to this party?” Ron hazarded. It seemed like a safe answer. It covered most possibilities.
“Because it’s
He touched a hand to his lips as he made his way up to the Gryffindor tower. Part of him couldn’t believe what had just happened. That he, Ron Weasley, had just been kissing Pansy Parkinson. Pansy Parkinson who wouldn’t even have given him the time of day a few weeks ago (or, rather, would have, but it would have been in the form of an insult). Pansy Parkinson, who a few weeks ago wouldn’t have even crossed his mind if someone had asked him who he would go out with if given the chance. But here he was. Smitten. With Pansy Parkinson.
“Should you apologize?” Seamus asked.
As Hermione continues to talk, Draco’s mind wanders. He is beginning to think that perhaps this whole Reliquary accident could be his chance to atone for his actions during the war. If he can help the Ministry catch new dark wizards and foil other dastardly plots, perhaps he will start to feel less guilty - both about the war and about reading that damn book. He wonders if that is why Oliver sent it to him. That seems unlikely, but, he realizes with a pang of sadness, they will never know why Oliver sent Draco the book.
“Sorry sir. We’re just getting around to adding our ingredients now,” Malfoy said.
“No,” Draco says. “You should sleep.” Harry nods and then makes his way back to his side of the bed. Draco turns on his bedside light and props up his pillows before leaning back on them. The book gives a little shiver of anticipation in his hands. He sighs and Harry snuggles up next to him, draping an arm over Draco’s lap. Draco looks down at him and smiles. Then he opens up the Reliquary and is lost to its words for the rest of the night.
“Because Draco Malfoy is a damn good bartender,” Dean said. Harry smiled briefly in pride, momentarily distracted from both his hangover and his tiredness. But then his head throbbed and he groaned and flopped back onto his pillows again.
Harry scrawled.
“I don’t think that’s the best basis for a relationship.”
“It’s easier without Professor Snape breathing down my neck,” he says.
“Still wouldn’t want to dance though.” Harry cocked his head to the side and stared at Draco, hoping his eyes were asking enough of a question. “Well, the only person I would want to dance with is out here feeling sorry for himself.”
“Yes,” Harry said. “I’m here.” Draco slammed his lips into Harry’s with more desperation than Harry thought he had ever felt from him. Harry was glad that Snape had left as Draco pushed him against the back of the couch and straddled him, somehow still keeping his lips on Harry’s. Harry clutched Draco close, his arms wrapped around the blond’s waist.
“Still a sacrificial lamb,” Draco said. He took a step towards Dumbledore, his free fist coming up of its own accord. “And we bloody
“What do you want to drink?” Harry leans in and yells in his ear.
“I could show you,” she said. “Of course, then I would have to swear you to secrecy.”
“Well, you
“But I had just found out the man who had killed my parents, and who was - is - trying to kill me, had been a Slytherin, so I asked the hat to put me somewhere else.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Snape hissed. “You’ll do no such thing. I’ll do it.”
“Fine,” she says. “We’ll ask her.” She pulls out her wand and jabs at her watch.
“For now,” Potter says. “I’m fixing it up to sell it.”
For a moment, Harry expects to feel the almost paralyzing stab of longing in his gut when he thinks about Oliver, but it doesn’t come. It aches, that’s for sure, but the pain is starting to dull now. Just like all the times before. Because if there is one thing that Harry knows, it’s that time heals.
Not that Hermione was prone to objectifying anyone, but damn Blaise looked good. She was pretty sure he knew it too. He had a reputation for being vain, but so far this evening, he had seemed to pay attention to only her.
“So it’s been a year and a
“I don’t have any others,” Harry said.
“Uh,” Draco says again. “It was given to me.” He figures that is as close to the truth as he can be without telling the whole saga. He’s not sure how much Banks knows about The Reliquary. Banks frowns at the readout for another few seconds, then shrugs and prods the watch again.
“I’m a ghost.”
“Ah,” Dumbledore said. They stared at him expectantly. “Yes. I had suspected as much.” He sat back in his chair and stroked his beard idly with his healthy hand. “That presents a problem.”
“You know,” she says. “You’re quite efficient when you’re not busy trying to get into my pants.” McLaggen gives her a humorless smile.
Harry ended up doing most of the talking while Draco frowned at the floor. He recounted the Christmas presents and stealing the horcrux, followed by the amazing lunch. Draco did seem to perk up somewhat while he talked about the food, but then sulked down into the cushions when Harry started to talk about his conversation with Nagini.
“That’s alright, Dobby,” Draco said. He walked across the room, sighed and then fell onto one of the sofas and slung one leg over the arm of it. He looked far more elegant than he had any right to, or so Harry thought. “We ought to have treated you better.” He put a hand up to his forehead and closed his eyes. Harry walked over to him and sat down beside him.
He wishes he had something more comfortable to change into, but Potter hasn’t stopped by yet with his promise of casual clothes, so he’s stuck in his suit. At least he knows he looks good.
“Is that all I am to you?”
“You want to do it, Draco?” Snape asked. Draco trained his scowl on the black haired professor, his arms still crossed in front of him.
, August 31
“You taught me,” he says. “Since you used to conjure them all the time during First Year?”
“How did you do that?” Hermione asks, walking over to him. Harry frowns at her.
“You think he’s going to appreciate you sucking me off?” Massi asks. Draco shrugs.
“Harry.” This was Dean. Harry turned around horrified. He had forgotten that Dean was in the room. “Why
Potter and Malfoy nodded in unison. Severus gave them a curt nod and then swept out of the room, making sure that his cloak fanned out behind him as he did. (He had to keep up the aesthetic, you know?)
“For a bit,” she said.
“I tried talking to the Baron,” Blaise said, ignoring her question.
“I think so?” Ron stares at Harry impassively and takes a sip of his tea before he speaks again.
“Come on, Parkinson, you know-“
“Alright,” Harry said. “When is it?”
“Perhaps. But let’s not rule out other teams.”
“But,” Harry started to splutter. He wanted to protest and say that they had not been trying to use lesson time in such a way, but in a way, they had.
“But it’s just a children’s tale,” Draco protested.
“What do you reckon?” he asks.
“I guarantee you, Ron is not going to come in here,” he says. “He
“Oh right,” Pansy says. “That was the match against Slytherin.” She turns her attention to Draco. “Remember Draco, we spent most of the match laughing about how Harry couldn’t ride his broom?”
“How should we destroy them, Professor?” Hermione asked.
“Erm, could you, perhaps, I don’t know, stand in the corner or something? So that you can’t see?”
“Yeah,” Ron says, opening the door. “Well, I don’t overly want to have dinner with the Ferret.” But there’s a goodnatured grin on his face. “Come on in.”
“Or a few,” Seamus interjected. “All the groups.” He took over orchestrating where everyone should stand, and who should be photographed with who.
Draco was waiting for him as he turned the corner to the correct hallway. The blond smirked as he walked closer.
“You are also suspected in a string of home break-ins,” Pansy continues, unperturbed. “I think if we test your magical signature, we will find that it matches one that was recorded at 403 Hahn Street on the fourth of November last year, and then again at a break-in at 83 Richter Street on the fourteenth of January.” She continues to list Wise’s suspected targets and watches as he grows more fidgety.
embarrassing things. Like that time that Justin Finch Fletchley and I were caught snogging in a broom closet.” Harry, as usual, flinched at the word snogging.
Harry feels both relieved and a little deflated as they are leaving. Relieved, of course, that Draco was skilled enough under veritaserum to lie about the full nature of their relationship, deflated that Hermione’d had the gall to ask about it. He knows it’s her job and that she just wants to keep them safe, but Harry is still upset that she doesn’t trust him.
“We went to Hogsmeade.”
“But you know where it is?” Dumbledore’s tone was urgent. Kreacher nodded. “Could you get it for us?”
“Well it’s fucked everything up.” The first figure rounds on the second. “Now the Ministry’s investigating.”
“Harry’s got a point,” Draco said. “There’s no reason to wait until the morning. In some places, it’s actually tradition to have presents the night before.”
“Yes.”
“If mum lets you in the house,” Ron said darkly.
Harry and Blaise seemed to have the exact same idea as to what the other one would want and had gotten each other equally nice bottles of whisky, though from different distilleries. Fred and George had sent Harry a large box of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with a card saying “Merry Christmas to our favourite investor.”
“Parkinson,” he says again. He lays his hands flat on the table. “I know about the Ministry hideout under Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor.” Pansy can’t help it. Her mouth drops open.
“No, I’m very impatient.”
“I disagree,” Harry said. “I think it would be fun to have some photos of us all having a good time. Plus, Ron and I changed costumes and I wanted to get new pictures taken of all of us together. But don’t worry. Everything will go through me. No one will see any pictures until I have approved them. I have veto power.” Draco narrowed his eyes and looked at Colin. The younger man was now looking up at the shelves of liquor with wide eyes.
“The Ogden’s has been stolen twice,” Rosemary Parkinson says. “It stays with Mr. McLaggen.”
“I know I should think that’s a bad thing,” Draco says. “But honestly I’m thrilled.”
“Don’t,” Harry says. “Not yet. Maybe if we’re still together in a year.”
“Good,” Draco said. “Then we can just sit on the bed, or stand here, or whatever, until you are comfortable.” Harry nodded and allowed himself to be lead over to the bed. When Draco sat, Harry sat. He told himself he was being silly. After all, he
“I think I have something that will help,” he blurted out before he could think better of the idea. Everyone turned to look at him. “I have a map of Hogwarts.”
“Mmm srrreee,” he mumbled, his mouth still somewhat full. Her mouth twisted in amusement. It was so far removed from the perfection he tried to exude most of the time that she found it oddly hilarious. She said nothing while he finished his mouthful. “I'm sorry,” he clarified once he was done.
Granger asks him a few more basic questions before nodding, clearly satisfied that the potion is working.
“Things,” Harry said. “That sounds descriptive.”
“Though, really, Harry, if anyone else finds out about us...”
“But you always try to set me up with Greg’s sister!” Draco protests. At this, Narcissa laughs.
“What’s that for?” Draco asks.
“You can do it, Draco,” Harry said. He caught Draco’s eye and gave him an encouraging smile. Draco returned it and then squared his shoulders, turning to the shirt again.
coworker was going to Hannah’s party and had followed her. They had assured her that they had been invited, but she is not sure, and that’s another reason for her nerves.
“Hi Ernie,” Harry said.
“I’m working on it,” Draco said. “I won’t say any more than that so you have some plausible deniability.” Narcissa’s eyebrows knit together for a moment before her features smoothed out again.
“I wish we could do this normally,” Harry said as they started up the marble staircase.
“No fucking way. How do you know that?”
“Not now, Massi, there are toast crumbs everywhere.”
Draco had been unprepared for how much Harry’s saying he would rather be out on a real date would hurt. He wonders who he would rather be out with for a moment before he realizes that train of thought is too painful. He had been so sure that Harry liked him. Their kisses had seemed so real.
“I’m sorry,” he says. “I should have told you. I should have found a way to bring it up.” He takes another deep breath. “And I should have done it before we took our clothes off.”
“Yeah.”
“And you must be Mr. Malfoy.” He nods, unsure of what to say. “My name is Gillian.” She pronounces it with a hard G.
“Another round?” he asked, looking around at their now mostly empty glasses. Hermione looked at her watch.
“I’m not really sure there will be cover dates,” Pansy says at the same time as Potter says,
Professor Babbling began to lecture and Severus began to pace the room, watching to ensure that the students were taking the proper notes. Unsurprisingly Granger was scribbling down everything Beth was saying, even though Beth had confided in Snape that she was one of the top Runes students. Because of course she was. Weasley had a look of mild terror on his face as Beth recounted one of the many ways that adding a Rune to a potion could go wrong. Longbottom chewed his lip nervously as Beth moved onto some of the more insidious ways that a Rune could affect a potion. Even Malfoy, who had napped through Beth’s first lecture, looked concerned. This was good. They were all just the right amount of concerned that they would be cautious with their Runes, but not so scared that they would do nothing.
“So I’m a guinea pig?” Harry asked.
“You said to do what felt natural,” Malfoy all but purrs into his ear.
“Right.” They hurried over to the fireplace. Harry took some of the bags while Draco grabbed a handful of Floo powder. Then with a firm,
made it sound like he thought it was, indeed, great.
have to be the one to bring him down,” Dumbledore said. He reached out a hand and placed it on Harry’s shoulder. Draco resisted the urge to practice his punch on Dumbledore.
“No,” Harry said quickly. “Dumbledore wouldn’t care about that.”
“Well, at least you didn’t royally fuck up like I did,” Pansy muttered. “What scarf was she talking about?” She looked at Ron and Hermione who both shrugged.
“So, like a video?” Draco asks.
“No,” he retorts, leaning in to sneer at her. “You just think you’re god’s gift to all humanity.”
“Hi,” he whispered, pressing a quick kiss on Harry’s cheek. He heard a dull slapping noise and looked around to see Blaise clapping a hand to his forehead.
“Ah, yes.” Dempsey refers to her notes again. She must sense Pansy’s unease, that or she notices the fact that Pansy is no longer looking her straight in the eye, but rather looking ever so slightly to the left of her gaze, because she adds, “Some of our best hit wizards have come from Slytherin. Ambition isn’t always a negative trait, Parkinson.”
“May I ask why?”
But Harry had not considered Draco’s prodigious lying abilities.
“I set you up.”
“Holy shit, Potter,” he breathes. Harry glances upward for a moment and Draco thinks he can see triumph in his eyes.
“Parkinson refused to have him at Flourish and Blott’s.” Harry lets out a bark of laughter.
,” Daisy says. She picks up her wine glass, pinky extended, and takes a long sip. “It’s just,” she pauses and puts down the glass. She brings a finger up to her lip and pretends to look thoughtful. “He’s just so, oh, what’s the word?”
“Forget I said anything.”
“I tripped,” he said. Snape said nothing for a moment, only stared at Harry down his long, hooked nose. Then he pulled out his wand and gathered up the papers with a swish and a muttered incantation. Harry picked himself up off of the floor and gratefully took his things back from Snape. With another wave of his wand, the spilled ink returned itself to the ink pot and Snape placed it back on top of the pile.
“How are you not more worried?” Draco asks as Harry enters the bedroom. There is a pile of clothes on the bed that is almost as tall as Kreacher.
“I’ll have to teach you Exploding Gobstones Snap on my own then.” He takes her by the arm and they make their way out of the room. Draco keeps his eyes on Greg the entire time but Greg does not look up. (But then, why would he?)
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hope you weren’t too snarky. He was questioning you about a murder.”
“That’s why I think now is the perfect time,” Pansy had argued. “I’ll have time to bring him up to speed before Potter and Malfoy return.”
“Take it,” he had said. “And promise me that you will use it in the final battle against Voldemort.”
“Holy shit,” he said as he stared up at the canopy over his bed.
“Certainly Master Harry,” he says. “Should I start with Master Draco’s things?”
It’s small. It’s so small, he almost doesn’t find it again as his eyes sweep the area he had been looking at. But he does. He is so thrilled with himself that he almost cheers aloud. He’s proved himself on a mission that Granger clearly didn’t think he was needed on. And fuck if that doesn’t feel sweet.
“Potter, I own a
“What is it?” he asks.
“I just need to know, is there anything that might compromise your ability to work.”
“Nothing actually happened,” he says.
“Oh, you just want to throw another party,” Hermione snapped.
“Your move,” Hermione said. Blaise turned his attention back to the game. He took in the pieces and sighed as he noticed that Hermione had put her bishop in a place where she could either take his king, or his knight. He moved the king and winced as she delightedly took his knight. The little man limped off the board, leading his horse dejectedly by the nose.
“Definitely,” Ron said.
“Here to socialize with you?” Draco asks. “Yes, I am. While our significant others talk about important things without us.” Draco had not been not thrilled when Harry had told him he wouldn’t be joining them to discuss whether or not his boyfriend would be going under cover, but no amount of pouting had changed Harry’s stance on this. They had to maintain Draco’s cover, after all. Even, it seemed, with the Granger-Weasleys.
“Like Occlumency,” Draco said. Harry nodded.
“Ron,” Pansy said with a sigh. “You sell yourself short.”
“Let me guess,” Draco said. “You were planning on him being in possession of the three Hallow things, weren’t you?”
“What?”
Pansy shifts uneasily from foot to foot. She knows she shouldn’t be nervous. This, after all the things she’s done in her career, is nothing. And yet…
“Just helping out, sir,” Harry says and then attempts to melt away into the scrum of people, but fails because Big Dick grabs his hand and shakes it heartily.
“Will Master Draco be needing things from his other house?” the elf asks.
“What?”
“Would I what?” She asked gently. She was not going to assume anything that he might be about to say. She wanted him to outright say it.
“Yeah,” Pansy said. “You have your own private potions room you can use.”
“Yes.” Potter frowns. “Can’t you?” Draco doesn’t say anything, just examines his nails in a disinterested fashion, even as his mouth presses into a thin line. Potter snorts in amusement. “Spoiled rich kid.” Draco bristles but lets the insult slide. “I suppose it’s for the best that you’re staying here then.”
“Busy with work,” Harry says. “Can we go in?”
“Our security is very tight,” Pansy says. “It has to be. This is where the Reliquary trains.”
“But you have your own money.”
“Oh my
and I could go back to my normal life.”
“Better him than me,” Pansy said. Draco glared at her, but she ignored him, walking away now that they were in the Entrance Hall. “See you at lunch.”
“You’re grasping at straws, Potter,” he said.
And on top of that, he’d been an insensitive jerk when he had blindsided Malfoy with the information that Parkinson was there when Oliver had died. He had been so wrapped up in his own emotions, he hadn't noticed how upset the other man was until he’d set a fucking napkin aflame.
“It’s not what it looks like,” Harry spluttered before Snape could say anything. He grabbed one of the cushions off of the sofa and held it over his lap, careful not to touch anything with it.
Pansy, Greg and Draco meet up with Harry and — gag — Cormac at the Leaky Cauldron. Greg is very confused by Cormac’s inclusion to their group. He’s said as much to Draco all day when Draco had mentioned they would be meeting up with them later. Draco can hardly blame Greg. After all,
“We don’t think she’s there. They should work most anywhere else.”
“But I shouldn’t be taking this out on you.”
“Because she forgot about some blue fire?” Draco asks. Harry sighs and downs the rest of his beer. He pushes back from the table and stands up.
“They’re dating,” Greg says. “So I pointed out they should be on first name terms.”
“I’ll wait for you,” Draco muttered. “Go.” Harry squared his shoulders and then walked down the corridor and into Snape’s room. As soon as he crossed the threshold, Snape shut the door.
“But I don’t think she will,” Draco says. “I know you think Slytherins all stab other people in the back, but we’re loyal to our friends.”
“I think I’ve figured it out,” Greg says.
“Good job, Draco,” she says.
“How unprofessional of you to even ask. I am not enjoying this in the slightest.” But the grin on Harry’s face betrays that he is kidding. Or at least that he is good enough at pretending to date someone that he can joke about whether or not he is or is not enjoying himself. Draco isn’t sure how good Harry’s poker face is. He wonders if he should challenge him to an actual game of poker in order to find out. Draco’s own poker face is out of practice, but he knows that with time, it will come right back to him. A benefit of growing up with the threat of Voldemort around the house.
“I don’t know if I ever thanked you,” Draco says quietly. He looks down at his shoes. He can still remember how it felt, behind Potter on that broomstick, clutching him so hard Draco had thought he’d never be able to let go.
“Professor Slughorn will be taking over as potions master,” Dumbledore said. “However as your project ends on Wednesday, Professor Snape will continue to monitor your potions until then.”
but Harry just lifts one shoulder slightly in a shrug.
“Great,” Harry said. “How do we find the others?” He was sitting on the edge of his seat, excitement thrumming through him for the first time that day. Dumbledore chuckled sadly.
. He picks up a book and finds its place on the shelf, then moves the cart on.
“Oh,” Hermione said. “We were somewhat hoping to go alone.” She looked at Blaise and smiled shyly. Blaise pulled her close to him and kissed the top of her head.
“Well, as you know, there was a lot of rolling around on the floor.”
“Ok, Draco,” Hermione says. “We are going to start out the training with some baseline questions, and then we will move on to concealing the truth, even when under the influence of veritaserum. How does that sound?”
Harry orders from a bartender who also seems to know him on sight and Draco starts to wonder how often Harry has been here. Harry hands him his drink and Draco takes it appreciatively. He takes a large gulp and watches as Harry’s eyes sweep the dance floor. Draco takes another sip and then makes his way out into the crowd, holding his glass above his head so as not to have it jostled. He doesn’t look to see if Harry is following him. He just wants to dance.
“Voldemort came to lunch.” Hermione gasped. Pansy raised her eyebrows so high they entirely disappeared into her fringe.
“I’m so sorry for everything,” Draco whispers. Without thinking, he kisses the top of Harry’s head. But Harry doesn’t seem to notice.
And it’s happening so fast that Draco doesn’t have the time to think about anything that’s going on. All he does is react. He ducks under the table and crawls towards where Harry was sitting. A moment later he feels Harry, or at least he who presumes is Harry - he can’t see after all, crawl up next to him and throw a cloth over him.
“My godfather,” is all that Potter says. Draco lets the subject drop. He’d read somewhere that Potter had lost his godfather at some point during either school or the war. Like so many people had lost someone. Like Pansy and her father, or Draco and Vince.
“Wicked.” Ron ran out of the Great Hall, presumably in the direction of the nearest bathroom. Harry rolled his eyes and started to follow, only to stop in his tracks when he spotted Colin and his camera. With new costumes, they would need new pictures. He made a decision that he hoped he would not later regret.
“Oi, what about me?” Blaise asked.
“Because your lot just
“You think I’m going to use it?”
“Who’s asking?” Susan shoots back.
They were a type dark magic, where one split one’s soul so that they would become immortal. And Voldemort had decided to make seven of them because he was an egotistical maniac. And also
“I don’t think it’s nothing,” Harry said. He nudged Draco with his knee again. Draco pursed his lips.
“Are you displeased with your drink?”
Somehow he doubts any of his schoolmates have children yet. Or at least, he doubts that there are any Hogwarts aged children. The first few post war years had been a hectic, messy time for the wizarding community. A flurry of marriages, sure, but not many children.
At this moment, the painting opens again and Susan Bones steps into the corridor.
“Sure it wasn't,” Blaise said, scooping up his wins. “Maybe another time. I, personally, am going to quit while I am still behind, though not as behind as I was a few minutes ago.”
“On what pretext?” Draco asks. McLaggen opens his mouth, pauses, and then closes it again, his shoulders slumping.
“Hello,” Draco replies. They stand there for a moment, neither of them saying anything.
“You two have ridiculous nicknames for each other?” he asked.
“Sorry,” Harry said.
“But there is,” he says quietly. Draco straightens up and grasps Massi’s chin in one hand, forcing his head up.
Eye on Malfoy, Harry watches him sit for a moment, right before before he seemingly catches himself and begins to eat again. The pork almost tastes like cardboard in Harry’s mouth now. The fact that The Reliquary is gone and the potential implications of that are swimming around his head. What will happen to Malfoy? Is it possible to get the information out of the blond’s head? And more importantly, is it possible to do that while keeping him alive. Because he sure as hell does not want to explain to Narcissa that her son is dead. He knows first-hand how much she cares for him. It’s the reason Harry is still alive.
After what felt like an hour, but in reality was about three minutes, they were spat out into a cavernous room, tiled in marble. Draco caught Harry before he could fall over, for which Harry was grateful, particularly when he looked around and saw that Narcissa had been awaiting their arrival.
“Whatever you say,” she says after a long minute, breaking the stare. Draco’s heart is hammering in his chest but he keeps his face impassive. On the one hand he wants to break down and confess to her that yes, he is in love with Harry, but on the other he knows that will result in Harry not being allowed to work with him and he doesn’t think he could stand that.
“Oh my god, McLaggen,” Pansy says, leaning back again. “Did you bring me here to talk about some fucking conspiracy theory?”
“And we figured it was best to come and tell you in person,” Draco says. “Before, you know, it was in the Prophet or something.”
“Of course,” Pansy says. She puts a hand up to her forehead. “Fuck me. There’s a lot going on. Swinn. Granger. The bloody Simurgh Society.” She pauses, then repeats “Simurgh Society,” and makes a face.
you sending away your most valuable asset?”
“Well, I’m not,” Harry said. “Hermione did all the work in second year. Ron and I just watched.”
“You really ought to rest,” Susan says. “I don’t know how long you’ve been unconscious for.” In his arms, Harry feels Hermione sigh.
“-Sandwiches?” Dempsey allows a small smirk to cross her face and Croaker gives her a grateful smile. He checks his watch.
“Ew, really?”
“The what?”
“I’ll go reapply the wards.” McLaggen nods and starts to leave. “I’m going to lock her in.”
“But Draco found something.”

Dean and Seamus leave to go get drinks and Hermione sidles up to Harry.
“What project?” asked Ron.
“You’re much easier to deal with when you’re not talking.”
“What are
“You have a car?” Potter looks momentarily blindsided.
“But you’re actually dating.”
Apologies for the delay on my other story - The Wizarding World is Not Enough - my beta has been really busy but he says he can hopefully get to it this week.
And drink they do. They drink until Draco doesn’t really care that Massi is an arsehole, because really, he’s kind of pretty. All wavy brown hair and dark eyes. And he’s tall. Taller than both Draco and Harry. And if Draco pretends that Massi is an object, the way Massi had seen him, he can just observe him as a pretty object. And really, he’s kind of funny. He’s a funny object. Which doesn’t excuse his actions in the slightest, but it makes being around him slightly more bearable. Draco still hates him, obviously, but as long as he keeps his hands to himself, Draco can tolerate him. At least until they arrest him and all of his family.
“Oh, just the odd lingering glance here or there,” she said. “It could be nothing. At first I thought he was just staring at Potter in irritation, but the venom just wasn’t there.” She glanced back at them again and then turned her attention to the bar, running her hand over the bottles in front of her. She stopped at a bottle of Maker’s Mark. She picked it up and held it out to Blaise.
“You could, but I’m not sharing the blanket in return,” she says. She unfolds the blanket and places it over her legs. She pointedly does not let any of it cover Cormac. He pouts at her and she rolls her eyes. “No,” she reiterates.
“Exactly that,” he says.
It’s been perhaps five years since Draco’s seen Potter in person. The last time had been at the conclusion to the Malfoy family hearings, when Draco had been acquitted for the reluctant part that he’d played in the war.
“So you found friendship through the power of potions? How wonderful!” Slughorn clapped his hands together in delight.
“Yes,” came Pansy’s response. “There’s just a giant sodding stuffed troll over here. It scared me.”
Lucius regards his presents for a moment before selecting a small, oddly shaped parcel. Harry thinks this must be from Narcissa as he does not recognize the wrapping paper. He holds it up to his ear and shakes it, the same way that his wife had.
“Maybe,” Harry said. “But how do I know that you’re not using me in some way? I mean, fuck, Draco, Death Eater training?” Unbidden, the image of the Dark Mark hanging sickly and green over the Quidditch World Cup sprang into Harry’s mind. He shuddered.
we’re not friends. I get it.” Justin tried to throw his hands up in front of himself, but found there was no room and so settled on a shoulder shimmy of sorts.
Next, they are ushered into the wardrobe room, where a fabulously dressed, bland faced wizard named Evander has them change into so many outfits, that Draco begins to lose count. Once dressed to his satisfaction - Draco in a grey silk shirt and Harry in a forest green turtleneck, both paired with black trousers - Evander sends them out to Gillian.
“What?” This was Tonks. “Er, sorry. I meant to say, uh, sorry?”
“Darling?”
“You only just met them,” Draco protests.
“You don’t look like master.”
“Intercepted an international jewel heist?” Draco suggests. He has no idea what Potter was trying to get at.
“How do you live with this?” he asked, dropping his hand after a moment. Harry shrugged.
And so Pansy is dressed as a cat, standing on Hannah Abbott’s doorstep. Behind her stand Joe and Luca, who had seized upon the fact that
“It’s a plan.”
“Thank you for joining us,” Pansy says.
“Let’s go back to my room first,” he said. “This room unnerves me.” Harry stuck the Cup in Pansy’s handbag and they left the room.
While it is not as busy at August 1
“-Yes, yes, your father would disown you.” Pansy waved Draco’s comment away. “Your secret is safe with me. But you need to get your shit together. No staring at each other across the Great Hall, you muppets.”
“What now?” Draco says.
“You’re kidding,” she whispered.
“I can help. With some of the talking.”
“Where?” he asked, leaning forward to stare at Ron with excited eyes.
“It could be a murder suicide?” Pansy suggests.
“That’s very kind of him,” Harry says. “But we couldn’t.”
“Because he’s going to ask you to dress up as Dr. Evil and be bald.”
“Uh, I'm Boy-Who-Fucking-Lived,” Harry says, pointing to himself. “Loads of people have fallen on their knees in front of me.” Draco feels a stab of jealousy go through him, though jealousy of what, he isn't quite sure.
“This is a lovely house,” Potter says. He turns and hands Draco the bottle of wine. “Now, I’m not sure if we want to open just yet that as our dinner reservations are at eight, and I’m not sure if you want an entire bottle of wine before dinner? It might be a bit much, but then there are about two hours, so perhaps it would be perfectly fine and of course there are two of us.” Draco thinks Potter is babbling, which he takes as a good sign. It means Potter is as nervous as he is. “And, then obviously, it also depends on how we want to get to dinner. Any ideas?” Potter runs a hand through his hair and smiles sheepishly at Draco.
“Of course,” McLaggen says. “Are you going to check out the ones we already have?”
“And you’re sure it was broken from the inside?”
Pansy and Greg avoid each other as much as they can, which Draco hates but can’t do anything about. He wishes that if they were going to break up, they would just get on with it. But he can understand wanting to wait until after the holidays. He knows Pansy has to go to her family’s Christmas dinner and face questions from her mother and aunts about her love life and that it’s probably easier to say that she’s with someone, even if their relationship is on the outs.
This room is wreathed in fog and fake ghouls float around at head height, occasionally bumping into the walls and each other. Pansy and Greg weave their way through the ghouls to an empty corner and then, once they are sure they haven’t been followed, they burst into laughter. The fog dampens the noise.
“Do you mean do we ever steal any of it?”
“You’re one to talk.”
“No need to be such a dick about it,” McLaggen snaps. There’s a flush creeping up his face from underneath his scarf.
“There are things called owls, you know. You could have sent one.”
something he should tell Hermione about. It would be better than it getting back to her second hand, which it will.
At the same time, though, she knew she was being unreasonable. Ron could kiss whoever he wanted to, even if she was a Slytherin.
“But you can only wear it when no one else is around,” Hermione said. “It somewhat defeats the purpose.”
“Scurvy cur,” Draco said and Sir Cadogen’s portrait swung open. Harry followed Draco into their pod, for what might be the last time. He placed his bag next to the empty table and proceeded to take out his potion’s book and some parchment. He didn’t hear Draco walk up behind him and he jumped in surprise when Draco’s arms circled his waist.
“Doesn’t it feel different to you?” Draco asks. Harry shrugs.
Draco can tell that Big Dick is excited. His ruddy face is shining with a thin sheen of sweat, not usually seen this early in the day. His excitement has sparked an interest within the team. Jamie actually looks up. He is still wearing a bored expression, but for Jamie, that’s rapt attention. Even Joe and Luca stop talking and look over at Big Dick.
“I don’t think so,” Draco says.
“I know.”
He reaches up and pulls Harry’s face to his. He kisses him softly and slowly. There’s none of the rush from Halloween night. They are on holiday and have all the time they could want. And Draco wants to make Harry feel like he’s the only person in the world. Because right now, in Draco’s world, he is. It’s just them, and this compartment, and all night
“Thanks, ‘Mione,” Harry said. She pulled him into a quick hug and then it was time to leave. “Off to the Hog’s Head.” He started towards the door but pulled up short when he heard the popping noise that the Room usually made when it was providing something. He looked around, trying to figure out what was different and saw a portrait of a young woman hanging on the back wall. Frowning, he walked over to it.
“Professor?” Snape asked but Dumbledore ignored him.
“But I also think this might be the alcohol talking,” Draco said, screwing up his face. “Either way, it’s not a decision we should make tipsy.” Harry groaned.
“We have an hour,” he said.
“Nevertheless,” Blaise said. “You’re amazing.” He squeezed her close again and she smiled.
“The skeleton is still there?” Dumbledore asked.
“I need McLaggen on the Reliquary team,” she had said once Dempsey had ushered her in.
“I don’t know. You and Harry and both Gryffindors. You explain to me how you two think.” Draco’s patience is all but gone now. McLaggen narrows his eyes at Draco.
“But he
It is different than it was with Oliver. Sure, he and Oliver had been good together. They had cared for each other. But there hadn’t been the same kind of depth of feeling that Harry is developing for Draco.
“What makes you say that?”
“Can you come with me?”
“Is this,” Ron started to ask, breaking off from kissing Pansy for a second. “Is this going to make Potions awkward?”
“Who kissed you?” Seamus hazarded. Neville looked up and caught his eye, his face now a deep crimson. He muttered something into his pumpkin juice. “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Who?”
“I will,” he says.
“Yes, because we’d stopped Voldemort from getting the Philosopher’s Stone,” Harry said. They had all stopped walking now and were just standing in a circle in the middle of the dungeon corridor. Pansy was twisting the sleeve of her jumper in her hands.
“Do I want you to do naughty, naughty things to me in bed?” Harry asks, his face the mask of innocence. “Maybe.” He grins and runs up the rest of the stairs. Draco follows, smirking.
“I don’t know. Not you.”
“Do you want to?” Harry gestures with his hands to indicate that they should switch positions.
“Yeah, but he was a dick about it,” Seamus said. Harry shrugged as Seamus emerged from the bathroom. Harry was surprised to see that he was carrying a tray of shot glasses.
“No, it wasn’t.”
“So send the students home,” Harry said. “Or hide them in Hogsmeade.”
“A body was found in a house a few streets over from Potter’s house,” he says. “Apparent suicide.”
“Draco,” he says. “I hate to do this to you on your weekend, but I need to you to come in tomorrow.” Draco’s heart sinks, but he keeps his face impassive.
“Plus we were idiot kids,” Pansy points out. “You must forgive us that.”
have Quidditch practice on Wednesday night,” he said.
“Congratulations,” Pansy says to Draco.
“What does he have to do with anything.”
“For her safety.”
“Yeah, but my birthday’s at the beginning. I’m almost two whole months older than you.”
“You think my parents are fun?”
have it in their head. Then you wouldn’t need
“Well, yes.”
“Silence,” Snape hissed. “Enough talking. Get your trousers back on and get to work. You’ve wasted enough time as is.” He swept out of the room and Harry wondered if he ever just walked out of rooms or if his robes always had to do that swishy thing.
“What’s wrong with a party?” Blaise asked. He had made his way around the table until he was standing next to Hermione and now he swung his arm over her shoulder. “I think it’s healthy for us to forget about our worries for a couple of hours every week.”
“No!”
As they made their way into the fold, Harry couldn’t help but look around at the assembled group. He spotted Kingsley Shacklebolt at the back, standing a head taller than Tonks who was in front of him. Next to him were Remus Lupin and a witch that Harry didn’t know with brown hair pulled up into a severe bun. There was a flurry of movement to the side and Harry turned his head to see Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Mrs. Weasley seemed desperate to get Ron’s attention and Ron was pointedly ignoring her. The other Weasley boys were also there, along with Fleur, who had a hand possessively placed on Bill’s arm.
“I figured we would, yeah.”
“Yes.”
“Is this a dream?” McLaggen asks, looking around the simulacrum of Kings Cross.
“Fine, fine,” Aberforth said. He waved two of them towards the Floo powder and the rest of them to a table in the back of the pub.
Big Dick pulls Draco to the side as he is leaving Flourish and Blotts on August thirtieth.
“Shall we?” Draco asked, indicating the door that lead to muggle London.
“That is a relief,” Pansy said. “I was starting to worry.” She took a bite of roast beef and then washed it down with some butterbeer.
“Uh, Potter, that’s not going to happen.” Draco thought he could hear the slap of skin on skin, which meant that Harry had picked up the tempo on himself. So he did as well.
“Which brings us to: I will be monitoring the Sim Soc watch until at least after the holidays, after which, we will reevaluate the danger of the situation.” Harry looks as though he wants to argue, but Hermione is looking sternly at him so he doesn’t say anything.
The man is an unnamed suspected rare book thief, which explains why he has come in to Flourish and Blotts. (Not that criminals don’t buy books, just that no one else has wandered into Flourish and Blotts and sparked the Reliquary before.)
“So the Simurgh Society-“
“Fine,” he says.
Draco watches as Big Dick scurries off to his office. Draco is fond of the man, particularly as he had been one of the first people in the wizarding world to actually consider him for a job, despite his past. It is a past that he has worked hard to distance himself from over the last ten years and Big Dick’s acceptance of him has done wonders for his feelings of self worth after so much rejection.
So really, Draco thinks he cannot complain. Or, well, he could complain, but it would seem ungrateful. Could things be better? Sure. Would it be better if he had a boyfriend? Probably. Does Hannah often nag him about getting a better job or a promotion or a boyfriend? Definitely. But for the most part Draco is content.
“Ah,” Draco said, looking the redhead up and down. “So you’re saying he didn’t want to be the short, fat, goat guy?”
“It's not. And I think Potter’s the kind of person who would really respect such commitment to costume.”
“Ah, fuck. Where’s my wand?” Draco felt around in the pile of clothes until he found a wand.
You died?” Draco asks.
“And we’re sure whoever is in that room won’t get out?” Draco asks.
“What?” Draco put down his knife again and stared at Harry, his mouth agape.
“The first step,” Pansy says. “Is to change the name of our group.” Granger frowns at her. “Tell her, McLaggen.” She nudges him with her elbow and watches as his face turns scarlet.
“Did we want to move her to the Cooler?”
“By the government.”
“Good morning, class,” Severus Snape said, sweeping into the classroom. All conversations ceased immediately. Severus smiled to himself. He always felt important when that happened. “Today you will be adding your first rune to your potions.” He looked around at the assembled students. They stared back at him in rapt attention. “Therefore, Professor Babbling has returned to walk us through the correct method of inscribing the first Rune and the best way to then incorporate the rune into your potions.” He stepped aside as Bethsheda Babbling made her way to the front of the classroom.
“Can you tell where it came from?” Draco asks but Greg shakes his head.
Draco gently extends his wand out from under his sleeve and taps the watch, following Harry’s instructions. Small words scroll around the watch face.
“I’m sorry what?”
“Yes,” she says. “We were both in Slytherin together.” She regrets her words instantly. She has spent the last ten years trying to distance herself from her house, at least in terms of her professional life. She is still so ashamed that the entire house had been sent away during the Battle of Hogwarts and is even more so since it had been because of her words. She has worked so hard to prove to everyone that she is better than that now.
“What?”
“There’s nothing to do,” she whined. “Draco’s gone off with Potter, and I’m stuck with just you for company.”
“But how?”
“Yes?”
“Agreed,” said Ron.
“Harry, I do not need those kinds of details,” Ron said, holding a hand up.
“Ah, I see,” Seamus said. There was a glint of amusement in the Irishman’s eyes.
“Yes, but he’s a bit nervous of Muggle London.”
“Fulham Broadway.”
“That seems rather mean,” Draco says, walking up to Harry who is doubled over laughing. “Irrational fears are nothing to scoff at, even if they are of spiders.”
now.” Pansy is surprised at the venom in McLaggen’s tone when he says Harry’s name.
“False alarm,” he says. He taps his temple again with his wand and the recording spell ends. Draco waves his wand twice and then points it at the ceiling. From there, he knows, that the recording will go to the Cooler, where it will be stored in a Ministry penseive until someone cares to look at it. It feels like a waste, but it is protocol to send it either way.
“When did you get here?” he asks. Ernie shrugs.
As Draco watches, Luca nudges Joe and quite obviously mouths ‘gossip witches’ at him. They bounce excitedly on the balls of their feet. He fights the urge to roll his eyes again. But then, Draco figures, if Joe and Luca are distracting said gossip witches, perhaps Draco himself can just get on with his job.
“Draco, don’t listen to it,” Harry said. “We will. Remember my Ehwaz vision? We got married and Merlin, we were so happy. Remember? What I told you? You get a Weasley jumper and everything.” Draco’s gaze shifted to Harry again and Harry tried to convey all of his feelings with his face - a skill which he admittedly did not have. “Just destroy it.” Behind him, Riddle-Harry and his unknown companion’s lips met.
“What? No. It’s nothing.” Pansy is saved further conversation by the beginning of the game. Her mother waves her wand and scraps of parchment bearing numbers appear in every guest’s hand. Pansy looks down at hers. It reads twenty-seven. She frowns at it. It’s going to take forever to get through that many people.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shuffled closer to Draco in order to make the space they took up as small as possible, rubbing up against him in the process. But he was too worried about being caught to fully appreciate how nice that felt.
“But you would say that even if it did.” She sighs.
approve of bringing Death Eaters
“He can get your bags from the hotel, right Harry?” It is a very obvious ploy to keep them apart, and to make sure they don’t leave. But they are playing along because that is the only way they’re going to be able to recover the stolen object and/or bring the Battaglia family in to the Polizia Magica.
“Dobby will help find it.”
“Harry,” Dumbledore said. “I can’t in good faith agree to inviting Voldemort and his ilk to Hogwarts. I have the safety of the students to think about.”
“There you are,” Ron said. “You’re a threat! That’s exciting.” He sounded overly cheerful, the way that Ron always did when he was trying too hard to lighten the mood.
Ron and Hermione’s house looks like Christmas threw up on it and thus looks entirely different from when Harry and Draco visited it just a few days ago. Harry assumes it is Hermione’s doing. Draco assumes that it is Ron’s.
So now all he wants to do is drink until he no longer feels the ache in his chest and dance until his feet hurt instead of his heart.
“We need you to take this,” Harry said, holding out the Cup. “To the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts.”
“Thank you, darling,” he says. He looks over at Narcissa. “Of course, you know I shall never remember what it is I’ve forgotten.” Narcissa lifts one shoulder in a shrug.
“Of course, Ron,” he said. Then he remembered some of Ron’s previous Halloween costumes (the year he dressed up as a muggle postman stuck out in particular) and he added. “Within reason.”
“See you around,” Greg calls after them as they set off across the store.
Quite frankly, it was problematic how good he looked in his costume. His bare arms were muscular and the dim light reflected off of them in a very pleasing way. On top of that, his shirt left little to the imagination as to what was underneath it.
“Again,” Snape said.
“Last call for alcohol,” the barman calls. Pansy looks over at him in surprise.
“It wasn’t terrible,” Massi says. He puts his palms flat on top of the display case and pushes himself upright. “In fact, it was pretty good.”
“Easy as pie,” he said, standing back from the cauldron.
“Well, it sounds like that’s something you should figure out. So it’s probably a good thing you haven’t asked him out properly.” Neville took a long drought of his pumpkin juice. “But, from where I’m sitting, you seem to like him a lot.” Seamus frowned and Neville shrugged at him. “That’s just my two knuts.” Seamus nodded slowly and then shoved more pie into his mouth.
“Don’t forget Hermione and Pansy,” Ron said, unhelpfully. Harry wasn’t sure if Ron was secretly on Seamus’s side. “And Zabini,” Ron added as an afterthought. Harry tried to show Ron his displeasure through a glare, but Ron was studying his nails.
“Wicked. Guess I know where I’m sleeping then.” Ron winked at Pansy who rolled her eyes at him.
“You asked me out, and I said yes. I think that constitutes as dating.” A feeling of warmth blossomed in Harry’s chest. He smiled at Draco, suddenly shy.
“No?”
busy? But clearly he had been. Perhaps once this Potter project is done, he can go on holiday.
Severus always enjoyed this part of teaching the sixth years, the weeks long brewing periods where he could be a bit more hands off with the students. It had the dual effect of giving him more free time and giving the students a taste of independence, which he found often improved their overall potions skills.
“What?”
“Complicated, fiddly magic is not one of my strong suits.”
Draco knows he himself would be unlikely to hire most of the rest of the staff for any other job, but somehow their collective weirdness does not take away from the Flourish and Blotts buying experience, and if anything, it adds to the charm. Or at least, that is what Draco tells himself when he turns a blind eye to some of the shenanigans that go on. And if they aren’t the most efficient team? Well, how often do people come into a bookstore with a specific book in mind? In his experience, most people prefer to peruse anyway, so if they can’t find someone to help them, they are generally content.
“Get off,” he says. “My bowtie is fine.” They cross the street and walk towards the main entrance to the hotel.
“So, Winola Swinn,” Draco says. “What are we going to do about her?”
“But I’m your idiot,” Harry whispered, nuzzling Draco’s neck. He trailed a line of kisses back up to Draco’s face and then pressed their lips together.
“I love how you’re talking so casually about my death,” Harry says, smirking as Draco looks horrified.
“And yet, I still know that they’re awful.” Draco sighs and crosses his arms in front of his chest.
It’s strange, sleeping in a new bed. The pillows aren’t quite right and Draco can’t decide if the duvet is too heavy or not heavy enough. Either way, it feels foreign on top of him. It takes him a good twenty minutes to get comfortable enough to fall asleep. And even then, he stares at the canopy of the four poster for a long while, taking in the intricate embroidery there, before his eyes finally drift shut.
She walks as fast as she can down Diagon Alley without turning heads and then walks straight back into Big Dick’s office once she reaches Flourish and Blotts. He is partway through eating a ploughman’s lunch and she walks in just as he is lifting a piece of cheese to his mouth. He puts it down sadly.
“Heya George,” Harry says as he walks into Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. “Ron here?”
, and we’re all right here,” Pansy said. She pulled out her wand and turned to where Blaise was sitting. “Up you get.”
“Yes, you idiot.”
“The Sylvia Swinn who’s on the Wizengamot?”
. Merlin, it’s two days ’til Christmas Eve. Be normal. Celebrate with your families. Take the next few days off.”
“Yes, yes,” Harry said. “Our relationship’s a secret. I
“But we’re going to have to go
,” Draco snapped. “I’ll have you know that we-” And then he stopped himself.
, and leaned over and kissed Draco hard on the mouth.
“You’re right,” she said. “I’m not fine. I feel a miserable combination of sad and powerless.”
“No one else is curious?” Draco asked. The rest of them shook their heads. “Fine. We’ll just let it sit there until Christmas Day then.” He flounced down onto one of the chairs around the table and crossed his arms.
“I do,” she says. She blows out a breath, still looking a bit put out. Draco scoots over in the booth until he is right next to her.
“How is Ron?” Hermione asks once her sobs have subsided somewhat. She looks at Harry, her face streaked with tears.
And then it was like time itself had slowed down. There was green light coming towards him but there was nothing he could but watch it as it reached him. This was it. This was the end. He had failed.
“We’ll be back on Saturday,” Harry says. “In the evening.”
“Sure.”
Draco picked up the parcel that Harry was pointing to and held it up to his ear. He shook it gently and looked pensive.
“No. Why the fuck would I kill them? I don’t even know who they were.”
“He deserved all the snark that he got,” Draco says. He leans back in the couch cushions, happy to be home. He stretches his arms above his head and yawns. Harry takes this as a sign that they should go to sleep, and for the second time that night, apparates them straight to the bedroom. This time, however, when Draco falls into the sheets, he falls asleep almost instantly.
“Hufflepuff’s Cup,” Pansy said, leaning over the book and reading off the caption on the picture.
“Does she not want the ice cream?” he asks.
Greg is so excited about the prank that he wakes up early and cooks them a full English breakfast - for “stamina”. Draco is distracted as he flips through The Prophet, but does notice one article about one Timothy Backstrom, who the Reliquary informs him is an illegal salamander smuggler. When Harry joins them in the kitchen for a quick mug of coffee before work, Draco tells him about Backstrom in an undertone while Greg washes the dishes.
“Exploding gobstones snap!” Greg yells, perhaps louder than he meant to.
“If you think that bridge is nice, just wait until you see the next one.”
“What form does your boggart take and how do you typically deal with it?” Pansy asks, cutting off whatever Granger was about to say.
Justin was sitting dejectedly outside in front of one of the fire pits. He was alone. He was supposed to be with Seamus, but Seamus was inside dancing with Cormac Fucking McLaggen. During what was supposed to be
,” Draco said, smirking.
“I mean, I could have done it again,” she had said. “But it is supposed to take a month, and we only have twenty five days.”
“Why don’t you ask him about it?” Pansy suggests.
“Oh. That’s a good point.”
“Because you’re much more attractive than I am.”
“Um, sorry about that,” Draco says. “I didn’t know what I was reading.”
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Draco says, swearing in spite of the rules.
“Moving in?” comes Potter’s voice from the door. Draco freezes in the middle of putting a shirt on a hanger. Thankfully, the closet had been full of them, so he hadn’t had to ask for any.
“Why do I feel like today is going to entail me being forced to try on lots of different outfits?”
“Stop being dense,” she said.

“Mr. Potter,” a tall witch with flaming orange hair greets Harry warmly, sweeping him into an embrace as soon as they enter the Witch Weekly offices. She lets go of his shoulders and turns to Draco.
“Severus,” Dumbledore said. “We must confer.”
“Whatever he’s having.” If Draco found this exchange odd, he didn’t show it. Harry chewed awkwardly on a hangnail as Seamus and Cormac continued to flirt beside him, and he was quite relieved when Draco finally handed over Cormac’s Manhattan and the older boy left.
“The whole school already knows about us,” Draco pointed out. “And, er, I’m not quite sure how else to explain how we both died but then didn’t.”
“We have located The Reliquary.” As usual, Dempsey gets straight to the point. Pansy sits up straighter in her chair, not that she had been slouching. “It has fallen into the possession of a,” she pauses to look down her nose at the papers on her desk. “Of a Draco Malfoy.” A shock of recognition goes through Pansy. She hasn’t thought about Draco in years. They had begun drifting apart in Sixth Year, when it had turned out Draco was busy carrying out a plan to kill Dumbledore, and then he had not come back to school the following year. And while the Parkinsons had perhaps been acquainted with the wrong people and dabbled in the more grey arts, the Malfoys had thrown their lot in with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. And so somehow she had not found the time to see Draco after the war, a predicament she sometimes regrets. But really, she barely has any free time as it is and what little she does, she mostly spends with Millie, Daphne and Izzy.
“You’re not coming in with me?” Draco shook his head.
“Now, Potter, I must tell you. I don't fuck on the first date. So don't get your hopes up.”
“Colin?” Draco asked. He looked behind the two of them and spotted the offending Colin. The fifth year boy looked nervous. He was fiddling with his camera straps.
“Asked the room to add another couple of rooms. One kind of sitting room through there, hopefully, which connects back to the hallway and a separate bedroom off of it. So that no one can just walk in on us like you did.”
“First off,” Hermione says once the five of them have gathered in the Cooler during Draco and Pansy’s lunch break. “I would like to congratulate Harry and Draco on their magnificent job in bringing in almost the entirety of both the Battaglia and Luczkowski criminal families.” Draco sits up a bit straighter and smiles smugly at the group. When he catches Harry’s eye, he drops the smile.
“Really?”
“Shame,” Blaise said. “I was looking forward to Draco having to wear his glasses in public. He looks like a right nerd in them.”
“At least Patterson’s not bad,” Blaise said.
“What he said.”
“What do you need?” Kreacher asked.
I apologize if my Italian is incorrect - I found these phrases on the internet. Please feel free to comment with any corrections.
“So you were with Dumbledore,” Seamus prompted. They nodded. “Eh, you’re probably fine then. I mean, he’s Dumbledore.”
“I didn’t say we were bad.”
Harry’s best friend after all — but it’s better to realize it later rather than never.
“I am
“Not officially.” Blaise jutted his chin out. “But it’s the holidays.”
“I don’t like keeping secrets from people. I absolutely hate it. Sixth year was the

“Just rattled.” Draco sighed and threw his head back against the back of the sofa. “It’s a good thing that trying to fix that bloody cabinet

“But surely it would be easier to extend this interior than to build a permanent elevator into the Chamber.”
“Since Professor Snape created them, I suppose,” Neville said. Ron frowned and held the bottle at arm’s length.
“We need you,” Harry whispers in his ear. To the other two he says, “I’m going to have to steal Draco away, I’m afraid.”
“McLaggen told me about your interview.”
“Well,” she said, clearly flustered. “They’re the best pranksters since James Potter, Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. They know the castle better than anyone. I thought I might enlist them to, ah, booby trap the castle so to speak.”
when his father was free again. If, he supposed. If his father was ever free again.
“Draco,” Pansy said gently. “You got out books about careers last year too.” Harry snickered. Draco kicked him. Harry scowled. Draco smirked. Harry elbowed him. Draco-
“I, uh, don’t know what you’re,” Malfoy starts to say. Parkinson rolls her eyes at him.

The morning of the funeral, however, the mood in the Great Hall had been subdued. They had gathered by the side of the lake and everyone had paid their respects to Dumbledore before McGonagall had transformed the altar at the front of the ceremony into a large, marble tomb.
“My theory is that someone killed the victims, heard Potter and Malfoy coming, broke the window, jumped out and apparated mid-jump.”
“We all are,” Pansy says from across the room. Harry looks over and smiles at her before going back to staring at the laptop.
“Okay,
But then, the nature of Harry’s position is different to those of a normal Unspeakable. His cover involves hiding in plain sight, being the Boy-Who-Lived, celebrity eternal. He is invited to any event that he wants to go to, and no one expects him to do anything untoward, so he is never suspected.
“That, and You-Know-Who is back,” Ron said. This was clearly not the right thing to say, because Draco grew very fidgety and Pansy and Blaise looked nervously at each other.
“Right,” he said, starting to turn away. “I’ll stop bothering you.”
“Does she often use the word lover?” Draco asks, unable to keep an amused smile from crossing his face.
“I did,” Draco says flatly. He leans across the table and points towards his initials that are prominent on the bottom of one of his letters. “See. DM of Briarthorne Interiors.”
“They were trying to keep the relationship a secret,” Ron added. Pansy snorted in amusement.
helped me buy these?”
“Of course,” Harry agrees. “Flat on my back is my most powerful position too.”
“Why what?”
“It was a surprise seeing you on the cover of Witch Weekly, of course,” she says once she has a gin and tonic in her hand. “But you looked so happy that I couldn’t help but be pleased for you.” She puts a hand briefly on his arm and smiles at him. Across the circle of people, he sees Draco stiffen. He jerks his head, indicating that Draco should join them, and the blond does.
“You can’t.”
“But if we think Hermione has been compromised, should we share the earring with her?” Harry asks, bringing the conversation back to the more serious things at hand. Pansy sighs.
“Were you?”
He had spent the rest of the summer hiding from Death Eaters, hiding from the Dark Lord, trying to avoid being told to do anything. It hadn’t worked. They had found him, even though he had hidden himself in the back of the deepest wardrobe in the farthest guest room they had. Of course they had. The Dark Lord hadn’t been done with him after his snake tattoo, after conscripting him into the Death Eater’s ranks. That hadn’t been the point of him joining up. The point had been to get him to do things.
“Don’t be daft. I’m not even legal yet.”
“All the time,” Draco says, pretending like it doesn’t kill him to admit this. He takes a sip of his coffee to hide the irritated twist to his mouth.
