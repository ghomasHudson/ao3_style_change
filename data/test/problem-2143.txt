“I will remind you of no such thing. You want to make a wand, right?”
Potter sighs impatiently. “I don’t care if you’re nervous, you’re not being kidnapped, and it’ll take about an hour with the roads this bad. Anything else you’re dying to ask?”
Despite the bitter cold outside, Draco starts sweating shortly after following Harry into his workshop later that morning. A hearth crackles in the corner in addition to an empty cauldron that hovers over a low, smouldering flame. Wand materials from Harry’s cabin overflow into the tiny space, which is filled to the brim with fragments of wood, haphazard stacks of books, and myriad glass bottles filled with braided hairs from any and every magical creature suited for cores.
He glances questioningly at Harry, who slouches over the table in his thin vest. Draco forgets what he was going to say as his eyes crawl over the golden skin of Harry’s exposed arms, the sheen of sweat that coats his bare collarbones. It doesn’t much matter what Draco was going to say, as his mouth is too dry anyway.
Draco bites his chapped lip, gnawing at the peeling layer of skin with his teeth as he considers the pattern. “It’s healthy… with a stable magical core. It looks like its energy was depleted substantially, but that was ages ago. I don’t see anything wrong with it.”
“Don’t lose your lunch. We’re almost there,” the raspy, tobacco-tortured voice crackles through the contraption over Draco’s ears. He nods, eyes still sealed shut, and ignores the sound of an exasperated sigh.
“I’ve got an idea.”
“Pretty awesome, isn’t it?” Potter asks as he crouches down to look a wolf in the face. He reaches out to touch, but his hand passes straight through the animal’s skull.
“To study Healing and wandmaking, do you not know—”
“How did you end up out here with him anyway?”
“So’s Quidditch. Now, are you hungry or not?” Potter calls over his shoulder as he walks back into the kitchen. Draco peels his eyes from the screen to follow him and takes a tentative seat at the table.
“You know what this is?” she asks, gesturing towards her wand with a curt nod.
Draco feels his confidence build and grins. “Yes. A pack. A herd. A murder is probably the more accurate term. A murder of peacocks roamed the grounds of my ancestral home, preying on arrogant little boys, and I was no exception. Monstrous creatures, every one of them.” Draco smiles and watches as Fee folds over in laughter, a few tears escaping down her cheeks.
Draco shrugs. “Old habits and such.”
“Good to know,” Draco murmurs to himself as he turns to stare out the window in disbelief. His reflection stares back at him: dull, grey eyes, underlined by splotchy, purple half-moons. His harsh angles have softened a bit over the years, but the Malfoy bone structure will never fade completely. Neither will, it seems, his white-blond hair, which sticks out every which way from under his hat.
“Sounds beautiful,” Draco says, slowing his pace.
“Just don’t. You know what I mean.”
“Of course I know what that is. I’ve had one since I was a child. Now, will you kindly put it away?” Draco asks in disbelief.
“Sometimes it’s better not to think so much,” Harry says, nudging a patch of snow with his boot. “Not everything is that complicated.”
It’s late evening by the time Draco slouches against the wall by the fire, but a glance out the window makes him do a double take. It’s as though overnight, the sun decided to take a more leisurely path in the sky. A smattering of pale purple and peachy pink clouds hovers low in the sky, highlighted by the setting sun.
Potter repeats the same charms with identical results, filling Draco with a rush of pride.
This chapter contains some minor, but somewhat detailed, descriptions of human injury and the healing of that injury.
“No,” he answers too quickly.
The absolutely gorgeous art in this chapter is thanks to the lovely,
Draco sighs, and bites his tongue. “Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
“Not even for—"
The refrain of howling fades to a single wolf. The hair prickles on the back of Draco’s neck as he tries to appeal to the
“No, that’s not what I—You’re an arse.”
Draco wants to touch it, wants to feel the static of Harry’s magic prickle at his fingertips.
May leeches a droplet of blood from the wolf’s wounds with her wand and points a finger at an amber bottle on the top shelf. “Get me the
The icy mist of May’s magic fades as she drops her wand at her side, relinquishing her control of the swirling diagnostics hovering over the wolf.
The complex charms flow easily from the tip of Draco’s wand, resulting in a convoluted, violent crimson pattern that swirls about the base of the tree. Draco wrinkles his brow in concern, although he hasn’t a clue what it means.
“I’m beginning to understand why you never come back home,” Draco whispers, still working to slow his breaths.
Draco can’t help but shake his head at the irony in escaping halfway across the world to have the personification of his ugly history standing in front of him, letting him into his car, showing him the guest bed in his home. After arriving at his cabin, Potter had mumbled, “There’s food in the fridge,” before practically running away, as though he couldn’t stomach the sight of Draco standing in his living room. Draco had crossed his arms over his chest and watched him leave, unsure of what to do and puzzled about the
It’s not as though Draco cares what the general public thinks of him. He knows the depth of their loathing. But the thought of languishing about while his greatest accomplishment remained sneaking Death Eaters onto the grounds of a school made him itch to prove them wrong. And all the while, Draco could see Father’s cold and haughty sneer, an ever-looming presence even as he wastes away behind the walls of Azkaban.
If Draco had waited a moment longer, he needn’t have asked that question. As he approaches the corner near the back door, Draco finds May casting a series of diagnostic and sedative charms over a whimpering and bleeding wolf. Its black fur is matted with blood; the coppery smell is strong enough to permeate the thick medicinal perfume of the clinic. While Draco knows nothing about caring for animals, he’s certain the rise and fall of the creature’s chest is far too rapid to be encouraging.
Draco reaches for a small, stripped tree branch and fiddles with the splintered ends. “Do you avoid my questions on purpose, now? I know you do, don’t look so innocent. I repeat: why are we working at five in the morning?”
anything, or do anything other than what was expected. Everyone wanted The Boy Who Lived,” he spits the words, as though they leave a bad taste in his mouth. “No one wanted The Man Who Survived.”
“Breakfast. Have you ever had biscuits and gravy?”
“Are you having a stroke? Do I need to get you to May’s?”
“You could die,” Pansy had noted a few weeks ago, speaking to her own reflection as she applied a crisp winged eyeliner. “No one would know. No international Floo connection, no owls. What are you going to do? Get a Muggle phone?”
They both watch as the sparrow vanishes in a plume of feathers, evaporating against the backdrop of the darkening forest.
“Yes, yes,” Draco tuts. “Calm down. I had a very detailed discussion with Meg when I bought the box yesterday. But desperate times and all that…” He waves the spatula to emphasize his point.
“Yeah, I didn’t think so. So excuse me for not throwing a welcome mat at your feet. Or don’t. I don’t really fucking care.”
“Look, I was just teasing—”
“I’d be a shitty teacher if I didn’t. It’s usually more subtle than this, that gut feeling, but now you may be able to recognize it next time. Let’s go; I’m starving.”
“Can I add spices?”
“Don’t be an arse. I don’t want to hear whatever horrible things you have to say about me, or school, or Rory, or this town. If I want your opinion, I’ll ask for it. And right now, I’m not interested. So, just don’t.”
Well this was quite a journey. I so hope you enjoyed your trip to Volchii as much as Draco did. This story was such a joy to write. It's brought me to tears on many occasions, and I've become quite attached to these characters, both our canon favorites, as well as my small addition of original characters. I'm thrilled you made it all this way and sincerely hope you enjoyed it. Thanks so much for sticking with me til the end.
Potter turns around and crosses his arms over his chest. He grimaces before he answers, “Well, you were good in school. At Hogwarts, I mean. Best marks in the class behind Hermione. I’m not worried about whether you can do this.”
Bereft of tasks, May shuffles towards them, her robes trailing behind her across the bloodstained floorboards. Even though they’re both sitting on the floor, May still hardly stands above Harry and Draco’s heads. She wets her thumb with her tongue and swipes it over Draco’s cheek, the remnants of the wolf’s blood staining her fingerprint when she pulls away.
“Yes!” Harry says, eyes bright. “But the timing is important, and is different depending on your materials. Unicorn hairs are picky bastards, and if they’re heated too hot or too long, they’ll just disintegrate. But thunderbird feathers”—he glances towards the golden feather that hovers over the dry heat of the cauldron—“they’re sturdy. Hard to mess those up. But they also need a little extra encouragement to fuse with the wood’s magic. So, it takes a lot longer.”
“For fuck’s sake, Draco, it’s a hypothetical question,” Harry laughs. “I’m not actually going to force you to eat this one food for the rest of your stay.”
“This one’s not from the lower forty-eight! He from your neck of the woods?” Rory asks with an excited lilt to their voice. Potter nods, and Rory turns to Draco. “The pleasure is all mine, Draco. You’ve got a good teacher here. Our Harry’s a special one.” They throw a proud grin in Potter’s direction who visibly cringes under the attention.
“I wasn’t supposed to arrive until nearly five p.m.”
“Yeah. I am.” Harry grins proudly. “Gin comes by every now and then, but I miss my family. All the time. But I wouldn’t trade this for anything.”
Potter just hums in acknowledgement, already shutting down. Draco acts on instinct, wheeling in front of Potter to stand in his path. Staring into the face of his former nemesis, he realizes his meticulously planned future rests in Potter’s hands. Ruining this is more than just failing a class; it’s his carefully crafted plans disintegrating like stones into sand.
Draco tilts his head back further to locate the source of the sound behind him. He watches from upside down as Harry hums out of tune and pads across the kitchen floor, barefoot and hair sopping wet. His shirt is precariously unbuttoned, hanging loosely at his sides. Draco’s eyes linger on the exposed golden skin of his stomach, but Draco is quick to direct his gaze to Harry’s hands as he wipes the fog from his glasses on his shirt sleeve.
“All right, now that’s settled. Let’s start here.” Potter pats the frosted bark of a pine tree that reaches tall towards the clear, watercolor sky. He removes his wand and nods at Draco to do the same. Draco hesitates before digging it from his pocket, temporarily distracted by the unfamiliar wand in Potter’s grip.
Draco places a gloved index finger over his mouth, feigning deep contemplation. “Yes, what are the chains for?”
“Oh, they’re hungry, for sure. But they’re not like werewolves, losing all sense of self and control. It’s more like… the only time they can actually be themselves. They won’t hurt you if they know you.”
Harry smiles and scratches at his arm again, drawing Draco’s eye. A long gash oozes across his forearm, bisecting a prominent vein before trailing off towards his wrist.
“It’s a television, Malfoy.”
“Are you hungry?”
“Of course I have.”
“Excuse me,” he says to the woman behind the counter. She glances up from her magazine, but doesn’t acknowledge him further. “Do you have the time? Your clock appears to be slow.”
“Sorry, I’m not used to you answering my questions without a ridiculous amount of prodding.”
About six months in, he’d Flooed Pansy, overwhelmed after the evaporation of the delusion he’d bought into. He had missed class for a couple of weeks before Pansy had pushed him back through the hearth with a newfound sense of determination. It took some time for Draco’s skin to thicken into a protective shell, but eventually, Draco didn’t have to return to his dormitory to sit under the hot spray of the shower for hours or glance over his shoulder every time footsteps echoed behind him. He can’t even remember the last time he Flooed Pansy in a drunken state of panic.
Draco casts a glance out the window at the heavy snow that’s fallen steadily since early morning. “Bit cold, hm?”
Harry leans back over Draco’s shoulder and laughs. “Plus, if you’re the one that’s going to test it, we know it will suit you,” he says simply.
Later, Potter narrows his eyes as Draco demonstrates the diagnostic charms on a small patch of spruce trees. He listens as Draco interprets their meaning and corrects Draco gently, without arrogance or malice. With each recitation and spell that is cast, Draco feels his muscles tighten with tension in anticipation of a fight that never comes.
“That looks nothing like Quidditch,” Draco argues.
A beautiful, rosy flush migrates up Harry’s neck and cheeks as he strides towards the coffee pot. Draco hides his grin against his shoulder.
A day left alone is a day unhaunted, as it seems.
“What if we can figure out a way to shorten the process?” Draco proposes, mind racing through possibilities. “Raise the heat or strengthen the
“Oh, it’s a fridge. Like a refrigerator?” Potter clarifies fruitlessly as Draco stares in silent confusion. “It’s a Muggle invention for storing food. It stays cold, and the food keeps longer. Like a Stasis Charm. And, I don’t know how to answer this question without sounding like an arsehole, but… the drawer has a light… so you can see.”
More likely, it’s because the scheming glint in her eye and the lilt of her voice remind him of Pansy.
Draco met his mentor, Healer Nordell, in his third year of school. She introduced him to the new and blossoming world of wizarding medical theory: research-based practice, minimal patient interaction, and endless mysteries to solve. He was hooked.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco clears his throat and answers, “Gaps in the packing will leave unhealed pockets where the infection can fester.”
“All right,” Harry acquiesces. There’s a mischievous tilt to his grin. “We’ll try. But riddle me this, Draco: how are you going to get the hair from a pack of ghost wolves?”
“I’m not an idiot, Harry. I watch you make it every morning… It’s not exactly treating digitalis intoxication with a Blood-Cleansing Charm.”
“You did this?”
A sudden flick of the wolf’s tail captures Draco’s attention. His mind floods with images of braided Thestral hairs in glass bottles, feathers floating over open flame, and a spectral wolf pack racing in the moonlight.
“I figured, since you had boots,” Potter says around a bite of carrot.
“Yeah,” Harry sighs. “So, it took a while to figure this out. And I’m still not good at following the book. Sometimes that works out, and sometimes it means I’m starting over the next morning, or tossing a wand with a lot of potential in the bin.” He shrugs, pushing off the workbench. “It evens out. Anyway, starting this early means I have time to mess up without losing the whole day. But you’re good at this stuff; maybe it’ll go faster once you get the hang of it.”
“What?” Harry asks.
just Fee,
“I—I’m sorry. That they treated you like that… I know what it’s like to disappoint.”
“Not enough time.” Harry shifts to lean on the armrest and look at Draco. “If we’d thought about it the first day you got here, we still wouldn’t have enough time. Now, it’s March, and we give up minutes of darkness every day. We can’t get it done before the sun comes up and the wolves lose their form.”
Draco sees himself smirk in the reflection of Potter’s glasses before the light shatters above them, cloaking the kitchen in glass shards and the darkness of an Alaskan winter.
Potter grimaces, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “You’ll get used to the time difference pretty quick.”
strong enough to remove the rust-colored splotches, let alone the smell.
Draco wanders into a shop with a nondescript
“How did she know we were together?” Draco asks, his breath a cloud in front of him.
“As if that really matters—" Potter dismisses him with a wave of his hand.
They wait and eat in uncomfortable silence, interrupted only by the clink of silverware on ceramic and the tick of the clock above the sink. Draco keeps his eyes on his plate and fights the harrowed feeling in his muscles. Without the distraction of trees and charms and tasks, he’s left bouncing his knee and searching for anything to fill the silence.
“Wanted more of a challenge. The Shield Charms were too easy,” Potter flaunts, but his crooked smile tames the arrogance. “But, really. I’ve got a network of Heating Charms on the drive by the house, the pavement, the roof. They keep it manageable. That way, the rest of the yard can fill up, and I don’t have to worry whether the Jeep can get out of the driveway.”
“Hawthorn takes too long for the fusion.”
“Willing to bet your thesis on my
“How is she?” Harry asks as he releases the embrace and plops on the floor next to Draco.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry replies. A series of loud, syncopated crackles echoes off the buildings at the other end of the street, and the sky pulses with a glow of green and purple. “Looks like they didn’t want to wait for us.”
Draco’s journey began an uncertain number of hours prior, in Heathrow’s International Portkey Office. Before leaving, he was confident the transatlantic travel would be the worst part of his journey, requiring two long-distance Portkeys to get to Juneau. However, the resulting nausea and painful distortion were no competition for his first experience on a Muggle plane.
“Because you said you would take on a young, brilliant fifth-year Healer who is the future of the experimental medicine field. You said you would assist him in his research. You’ve made a commitment; you can’t back out. It would be dishonorable, untrustworthy.” Draco takes a breath, aware of his desperate rambling. “You’ll let me in that car, Potter, because you said you would.”
Draco?” Harry laments through a cackle.
Draco rolls his eyes and waits, his gaze shifting frantically as he tries to keep up with the hockey players on the screen. It doesn’t take long before the sound of too many footsteps draws his attention away from the game.
“Why am I not surprised?”
“Oh yeah, Malfoy? Why the hell won’t I?
“I thought we established that’s why I’m here?”
Through the trees, an ethereal sparrow flits between the branches and settles in front of Harry. The little bird preens its feathers for a moment before chirping in a voice that Draco recognizes immediately as Meg’s, with Fee’s signature laugh echoing in the background.
“How’d you get Weasley’s products all the way over here? Did you have to go through customs?” Draco asks, unsure if he just wants to irritate Potter or if he wants to know the answer.
“Sorry,” Draco coughs. “Thinking about the timing. For the wand. Between heating the hair and the fusion with the wood, it’s going to be extremely tight. Do you happen to have a Time-Turner lying about?”
at the bundles. They burst in showers of sparkling flame, waterfalls of shimmers, and blooms of glittering color. From the rolling waves of sparks, stampedes of horses, and lions, and wolves emerge to gallop across the surface of the icy waves beneath them. After circling the bay, they evaporate in an iridescent mist of golds and pinks.
A sliver of sun peeks from over the icy gulf as they make their slow trek back down to Potter’s cabin. They trudge through the snow with arms outstretched and the glow of a
“For a pure-blood it might be,” Harry chuckles, pouring coffee into his usual Chudley Cannons mug. “And what’s for breakfast, if not diabetes-inducing cereal?” he asks, standing behind Draco to peer over his shoulder.
“Harry! Over here!” Meg calls from her spot on a crumbling log. She pats the empty space next to her and Fee before chirping, “We saved you seats! And hot chocolate!”
“Don’t,” Potter murmurs, folding his arms over his chest.
Draco nods, but remains silent.
“Welcome to America.” Potter grimaces before ambling towards the back of the house. “Wizards can still get heart disease?”
“Well, don’t let me delay your precise process, Potter. Although I have a hard time believing you’re capable of anything involving precision.”
They trek from tree to tree, each one having a myriad of magical abilities and properties. Potter demonstrates a lengthy series of charms and proceeds to explain the varying patterns in their resulting displays.
Though the fireworks really do make the Weasley twins’ experiments look like child’s play, Draco claps mindlessly at each one, his attention diverted to the heat of Harry’s thigh against his own. He hardly hears Rory yell, “Harry, this one’s for you, honey!” before a golden lion elegantly rises from crimson and gold crashing waves. The lion releases a powerful roar, rattling Draco’s chest, before it shatters into a million golden sparks, raining into the dark waters below.
A knowing smirk replaces her blank expression before she replies in a jarring accent, “The clock is right on time, honey.”
I see you’re still the same Gryffindor heathen with zero regard for limits or rules… You can’t win if you’re breaking your own rule! I won’t allow it.”
“Nothing… I’ve done absolutely nothing. Nothing devious. Nothing exciting. Nothing remotely interesting,” Draco says as realization settles over him. “I think I’m the most boring person I know.”
He can’t.
Draco thinks he may be projecting, but subscribes to the impression, nonetheless.
“I said,
Draco settles into a tattered armchair in the front window and watches the snow as he contemplates the utter insanity of his situation. Up until now, he’d been fairly successful at maintaining some semblance of calm, but in the lonely quiet of the early morning, that false confidence begins to shatter like the glass orb of a captured prophecy crashing to the floor.
“Er… I’m not really sure,” Harry mutters, scratching at his head while he watches Draco examine his wound. “Adrenaline, you know? It’s always weird to get hurt in another body. Like… I have to play a game of figuring out where it ends up later.”
A gust of cold air sweeps through the door and, as though summoned by Draco’s thoughts, Harry enters the clinic, stomping the snow from his boots. He glances at Draco and May through his damp fringe and tosses them a pleasant smile. It doesn’t last. He catches sight of the slumbering wolf in the back and grimaces as he levitates cups of hot chocolate into Draco and May’s open hands.
For instance, I know you’d eat your weight in treacle tart every day if it were possible—"
The man stands and brushes his gloves on his thighs before answering, “Sorry to disappoint. I trained under an American, Sam Volkov, but he passed about six months ago. Just me now. Name’s Ha—”
come to clinic, now. Wear old clothing; it will get messy.” After the concise instructions, the eagle dissolves, emitting a crisp and cool tingle of magic in the small space.
Draco stops abruptly, stunned by the unexpected confidence from Potter. “Why?”
Draco clenches his hands into fists. “Because that stupid plane was supposed to drop me in the middle of nowhere. Somewhere I could be confident no one knew my goddamn name or would ask to see the Mark on my arm,” Draco snaps, but quickly feels the wash of shame from his emotional reaction. “Well, the universe certainly shit on that plan, anyway. Are you happy? Does that answer satisfy you?”
potion”—he gestures towards the bottle of green liquid—“helps it absorb the magic from the wand core during the fusion. It almost makes it more… porous?”
might mean. His face contorts further as he realizes he will have to ride in that car. In fact, Draco’s almost too distracted by the impending doom that he nearly overlooks the fact that the man’s accent is distinctly unlike that of the woman’s inside. Oddly, it’s much more reminiscent of his own.
“It’s violent,” Draco says as a player gets pushed into the wall.

Most days, he aches with the effort of
“And what’s got you so convinced that I’ve changed, hm? How’ve I changed?” Potter advances on Draco, a smoldering fury lingering in his eyes like a wolf lying in wait. “Better yet, how’ve you changed, Malfoy? Finished your community service and think all is forgiven? The Malfoy name restored to its former glory?”
“Good morning. You’re out early,” Draco observes, projecting a cool indifference.
The entire town is quaint, and picturesque, and beautiful. It makes Draco long for the soot-filled air and crowded streets of London.
“Honey, you’re in Alaska. In January. Sun sets about four o’ clock this time of year.” She’s smiling, but there’s an unsettling quality in the way it doesn’t reach her eyes.
“It’ll be here when you get back. I’ll set the feather to rotate, and the ash wands need to steep at least twelve hours. It’ll be fine.” Harry waves Draco’s concern off in a gesture of dismissal.
“Don’t some foods make you absorb vitamins better?” Harry asks as he levitates a slender piece of cherry wood and submerges it in a bottle of emerald green liquid.
“I didn’t want to give myself time to change my mind,” Harry says. “Or for someone else to try.”
of donating a piece of itself for magical purposes and
“Yes.” Her eyes narrow in challenge, and suddenly, Draco’s back in his first year of training.
His tone invokes a feeling of necessity, of tolerance for a situation he’d really rather not be in. However much this rankles Draco, he never discovered the
“Harry, if this is some kind of joke—” Draco cuts himself short when a muscled and elegant wolf emerges from the hall, its nails tapping the wooden surface with each languorous step. Draco’s first instinct is to pull out his wand, but striking green eyes pin him on the spot.
Fee juts out her lower lip to blow a stray curl from her face. “Indeed they are.” Her smile is disconcertingly kind. At one of his lower points last year, Draco had spent hours curled on Pansy’s couch watching Muggle cartoons on her telly, one of which featured a quite violent cat in pursuit of a mouse. Draco sympathizes with the mouse as he shifts uncomfortably under Fee’s feline-like gaze.
Draco picks up Harry’s wand, rolling it between his fingers and tracing the grooves with his fingernail.
“Oh, good morning,” a witch says from behind the counter. She flicks a Disillusionment Charm over the back wall of wizarding merchandise and jabs her wand in Draco’s direction. “Can I help you?”
Malfoy into your home for a couple of months. I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to hear that your head’s shoved too far up your arse to see past some ridiculous childhood rivalry.”
Draco wonders what a Jeep is and hears himself say, “I’m surprised that you don’t just shovel it like some unfortunate Muggle.” Potter grimaces. “Fuck, Potter, I didn’t mean anything… The magic is impressive.”
“Hm, okay then,” Harry says as he settles into his chair. “Coffee’s good.”
“Herman said he caught a nice tailwind on the flight west. Gets you here quicker,” she says around a piece of chewing gum.
Without another word, Potter yanks open the car door and climbs back inside. It isn’t until the vehicle lurches backward that Draco realizes he may be left at the airport to freeze to death. Survival instincts take over, moving his feet and slamming his hands against the car window.
This chapter has some brief, but detailed, descriptions of an injury to an animal. There is no foul play, bad intentions, or poor outcomes, but it does include some details involving blood and injury.
nonsense. Your perception is severely warped. When was the last time you went somewhere that’s
“Why not? You said you can pet them on the full moon,” Draco argues, gesturing vaguely out the window.
“Merlin’s tits… What the fuck is going on here, Potter?” A wolf brushes past Draco’s leg, its tail feeling like a cool breeze as it grazes the sinewy flesh of Draco’s thigh.
A crease emerges between Potter’s brows as he leans on the doorframe. “But why here? Of all the apprenticeships and thesis projects or whatever else that you could take on, why did you come here?”
Draco chews his lip and hums, allotting the serious thought that a serious question such as the one he’s been asked warrants. “How do you define food? As in, a cooked meal? Or a single ingredient?”
Draco mimics Harry’s scoff. “Wait a goddamn minute. You said
Or so Meg tells me, anyway. So, Draco Malfoy, what secrets do you suddenly feel the need to spill?”
“When are we not, these days? It’s too late for you to be at the clinic.”
“The charms are a bit complicated, but if you’re used to your medical diagnostics, you should be able to pick them up pretty easily.” He casts Draco the slightest of grins before moving on.
“So, you met Fee?”
“Thanks,” Draco mutters dumbly before donning the shirt over his own.
“I’m calling bullshit on that,” Harry says, waving his hand in dismissal. “But anyway, I may have taken
“Not as good as mine, though,” Harry sings. He’s quick to duck as Draco hurls an oven mitt in his direction.
“Smooth,” Draco drawls.
So, why
“We haven’t reviewed this pattern.”
He feels the sting of unwelcome tears prick at his eyes as he storms out of the bar and into the cold.
This captures Rory’s attention, who eyes Potter before sliding into the booth next to Draco, sitting so close that Draco can count the age spots speckling their olive skin. They lean an elbow on the table, ignoring Potter’s look of exasperation, and pin Draco with a look of intense curiosity. “Is that so?” they sing, casting a brief, mischievous look at Potter. “Draco, honey, we will need to be fast friends. Harry, here”—they nod in Harry’s direction—“is pretty tight-lipped about himself most days.”
“Er—worst thing I’ve done since school, you asked?”
A silver-haired, whimsical woman waves a wand at her storefront, highlighting an
It was the vanishing cabinets all over again. Minus the serpentine megalomaniac, of course.
He no longer feels the need to question the lack of a Portkey office.
Draco finds it a bit silly that a world-renowned wandmaker would choose to drive a Muggle car but keeps his opinion to himself. The driver of the boxy vehicle climbs out, bending down at one of the back wheels. He’s bundled head-to-toe in boots, a scarf, a hat, and a thick, crimson checkered coat. Draco waits patiently behind him, not wanting to disturb whatever it is he’s doing.
“Are you trying to get us killed?” Draco snaps, raising his wand defensively. His lungs draw in rapid, icy breaths, and his ears thrum with the pounding rhythm of his heart.
Bathed in the glow of Rory’s fireworks and hot from the press of Harry at his side, Draco fights to keep his expression neutral. He frantically tries to pinpoint when his entire concept of Harry became so muddled, so complicated. Bewildered, Draco thinks it had to have started the day he arrived to find Harry driving a Muggle car and hiding from the world in the veil of his own breath and a horrendous plaid coat. Though, Draco realizes, it doesn’t really matter, at the end of all things, when or why or how Harry shed his role of school-age nemesis like an old layer of skin. Just that he did. And Draco finds himself holding his breath, wondering what Harry really means to him and worrying about whether Harry wonders about him, too.
“Does someone like to play with Veritaserum?”
“Color me shocked.”
Draco’s breath fogs the glass. A wolf howls in the void. A chorus of haunting cries follows.
“Potter’s fine.”
helps with the wind!” he calls over his shoulder as he trudges ahead, leaving Draco behind him in the drive.
Another spark of confidence ignites in Draco’s belly as he recalls his disastrous encounter with the seatbelt on the plane earlier that afternoon. Now more prepared, he successfully buckles the belt, finding comfort in the satisfying
Unfortunately, Draco could not drive, nor could he Apparate to a location he’d never been without risking the loss of life or limb. So, he was left to allow a “pilot” to fly him to Seldovia in what has come to be one of the worst experiences of his life.
Draco puts his hands on his hips and huffs in frustration. “What’s the point in running the diagnostics if you’re going to ignore the results?”
Harry looks at Draco with a cheeky grin, and Draco nearly slides off his stool when Harry sticks his tongue out in jest.
ensured we were all well-informed on that, thank you.”
“Are you happy?” Draco slides his elbows further onto the table, feeling a bit like a sinking ship succumbing to the briny depths of the sea.
“You sound ridiculous.”
“You’ll catch your death like that.”
“And it works?”
With feet firmly on the ground, Draco runs a futile hand through his mussed hair. In lieu of the talking earmuffs required on the plane, he places his knit hat low to shield his ears from the chill. It turns out, the Seldovia Airport is not much of an airport at all, at least compared to the only other airport Draco has seen. In all reality, it is a wide gravel path, shadowed by towering pines and a small stream of water from the gulf.
“Sunset to sunrise, we have just under twelve hours… minus time to obtain the hair.”
“Should I be scared? Am I being kidnapped?” In an effort to calm his nerves, Draco settles into an old habit of prodding at Potter.
Under the unrelenting judgment of harsh green eyes, Draco thinks perhaps Potter hasn’t really changed either. At least not in the ways that matter.
“It feels wrong. Injured, almost.”
“So, why are
“You don’t need my opinion anymore. Go with your gut.”
“Never mind, forget it,” Potter says, a betraying flush creeping up his neck.
“You’ve gotten soft, Potter,” Draco deflects.
It was just a dream.
“What about the Weasel? Granger?” Draco asks, eager to move the focus back to Harry.
“No. I’m not doing this.”
“Do you think the hawthorn will play nicely with the wolf hair?” Draco mirrors Harry’s expression.
“You are an evil, evil woman,” Draco teases, taking a seat next to Meg. Harry plops next to him as Meg levitates steaming cups of hot chocolate, preserved under Stasis Charms, into their open hands.
Draco hesitates, pausing to lean against a bare tree and watch the chunks of ice jostle in the waves in the bay. Scraps of his youth bloom in his mind’s eye, images of a haughty and sorely misinformed child. By the time he’d contemplated the idea that he may be on the wrong side of the War, his ribs were prominent beneath his skin, his hair was falling out in patches, and the purple smears under his eye were dark with worry and sleepless nights. During probation, he was exhausted and nervous and hesitant and confused. He didn’t have the energy nor ability to do anything but mope around Pansy’s flat. And then he started Healer training…
The pattern is consistent; the color is clear.”
Yet, there are pieces of an unknown version of Potter as well. Bits of wood and half-finished wands fill every empty surface, and a record player sits atop a stack of books on wand theory. The records are strewn about the floor, like presents around a tree. A calendar, still turned to last June, hangs from a nail featuring bulky men in ice skates carrying long sticks.
“But what about
Draco takes a quick glance at Potter and shoves his hands in his pockets, discomfited with the line of conversation. The corners of Potter’s lips hang heavy, and a sadness colors his usually bright eyes. It’s not a look that Draco has ever seen on the Boy Who Lived, and he’s not sure he wants to see it again.
cloaking his face in a mixture of golden light and long, dark shadow.
“I’ve been told. Coming from you, I’ll take it as a compliment.”
Draco is suddenly struck by the lack of daylight. Someone—the wandmaker, he supposes—was supposed to meet him at the airport just after his plane arrived. He catches sight of a clock hanging behind the desk, but stares at the time in disbelief.
Draco leans back in his chair, raising a challenging eyebrow and loosely crossing his arms. He tenses in irritation at the thought that Potter clearly held his tongue during their work in the forest that afternoon. That all Potter will see the entire time that Draco is here is a self-important prick with an ugly mark on his arm. “Why would children’s candies and pranks bother me, Potter? Unless you’ve hidden something in my bed?”
“That takes a bit longer. The eternal state of daylight in the summer is actually harder to get used to, believe it or not.” He frowns. “I was going to get some breakfast, and then I guess I can show you a few things. Are you hungry?”
“Today’s a warm day,” Harry finally calls over his shoulder.
“I’m not ignoring it. You need both. Data and instinct,” Potter explains as he leans against a tree and crosses his arms. “Have you ever had a patient that seems fine on paper but looks like shit when you lay eyes on them?”
Draco narrows his gaze, tapping impatient fingers against his kneecap. “What do you know that I don’t, Potter?”
Draco’s shoulders tense at the question.
“Nope. Rules are rules, and it doesn’t count. What about you?”
“Makes sense,” Draco says. And then, before he can swallow the words, “You’re not a miserable teacher.” He feels his neck flush under Harry’s careful gaze and backtracks. “If you tell anyone I’ve said that, I’ll deny it ‘til the very end.”
It seems like an immense task, to stay and study with Potter for so long. Even beyond that, to somehow work when he is literally branded for his misdeeds seems near-impossible. Years of torment and effort, yet here he stands, ready to collapse in front of Harry Potter’s house and let this unfamiliar, icy soil claim him. It would certainly be easier.
Draco’s next move was uncharacteristically reckless, uncomfortably unresearched. He wasn’t convinced he’d be permitted within a hundred meters of a hospital, as Healer or patient. Regardless, he’d applied for school the next day.
Harry shrugs and sets the thunderbird feather to rotate with a flick of his wrist, like a hog on a spit. “This isn’t boring—the
Potter continues on in silence, delving further into the woods. Draco plods behind him, the feeling of insecurity building in his gut. Just because he doesn’t know anything practical doesn’t mean he can’t learn. Perhaps he could have been better prepared. There are surely hundreds of books on the subject, but he’s only read a handful, too focused on the clinical work to do much more. As the silence stretches onward, he feels the need to justify himself.
Harry scoffs incredulously. “Of course it is! You can’t beat treacle tart.”
“How long to get into Seldovia?”
Always the voice of reason, Ginny had given Draco a sympathetic pat on the shoulder while scowling at her girlfriend’s negativity. “You won’t die,” she’d said. “Probably.”
“And that’s what you choose to waste your question on?” Draco shakes his head, following slowly behind.
“I’m sure there is. We set the fireworks off over the gulf, too, just to be safe. In case you were worried. Which I know you were,” Harry quips. “Here, we’ll be late if we walk.” Harry nods his chin towards his outstretched arm.
“Sensitive subject already?”
“Sam was a pretty cool guy.”
Harry pauses a moment before surrendering with an unimpressed shrug. “Peaches. Okay.”
so he assumes it’s his ride. He takes a deep breath and wills his heart to steady. Unsatisfied but unwilling to keep the wandmaker waiting, Draco fidgets with his scarf, casts a wandless Heating Charm, and heads back out into the frigid cold.
“What’s your point, Malfoy?”
“Diabetes-inducing pancakes, apparently,” Draco answers, his pride fading a little as he lifts another underdone pancake. “And eggs,” he adds, nodding towards a plate of scrambled eggs under a Stasis Charm. “How you get enough protein is a mystery that will never be solved.”
“Not convinced, but I’ll let it slide,” Harry says. Draco’s jaw slackens slightly when Harry winks,
“Just Draco?” Fee asks with a raised eyebrow, not releasing his hand.
“You read the articles they wrote about us?” Harry asks with a surprised look.
explain the fact that it’s pitch-black outside.”
“Just checking the chains. It’ll only be a minute,” the man says. The heat of his breath billows into the air like smoke.
“No worries. I didn’t expect to get it back.” He smiles at Draco, and it’s earnest. There’s a hint of something Draco doesn’t recognize in the turn of Harry’s lip, the crease of his brow. Insecure, Draco directs his attention to the caked blood under his own fingernails.
Draco pushes Harry away in mock irritation, but can’t smother the upward curve of his lips.
It’s not long before Harry wanders into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. A pair of black joggers sits low on his hips, and there’s a smudge on his glasses. Draco wordlessly motions for Harry to lean forward and plucks the frames from his face, skimming the bridge of Harry’s nose with his thumb. He’s careful as he uses his shirt to clean the lenses and holds them up to the light to assess his work. With a satisfied nod and slight smile, Draco hands over the frames. Harry returns the smile ten-fold, and Draco rolls his eyes, turning back to the hob to avoid Harry’s stare.
It isn’t as though Potter doesn’t have good reason to hate him, but whenever Draco had imagined a reunion with the Boy Who Lived, it was always more of a reserved discussion, an uncomfortable rehashing of the past culminating in an amicable shaking of hands. He’d never anticipated the anger that still rolled off Potter in waves after so many years.
“Sorry… And no. I’ll let you know if it ever happens, though.”
Draco’s Heating Charm vanishes along with his focus. The bitter cold seeps between his carefully selected layers of wool and cotton, settling into Draco’s core. He’s willing to consider Potter’s suggestion of hallucinations. Or perhaps his plane crashed over the water. His body is but an icy corpse, and this is the beginning of his eternal punishment.
Draco’s eyes grow wide as the door to the bar snicks shut behind him. A tinkling bell echoes through the small, dimly lit room to announce his arrival, and dozens of eyes immediately pinpoint the outsider in their midst. Draco squirms under their stares and looks for Potter.
“By the book, yes…” Harry scratches at his damp hair and grimaces, a bit sheepish. “But sometimes it doesn’t take so long. It’s a weird fucking tree… Much like its wand holders.”
“Remember Fred and George’s fireworks, fifth year?” Harry asks. He leans close, his breath ghosting over the exposed skin of Draco’s ear.
And sure, Draco will be the first to admit that he’s still unbearable some days. But most days, he’s
A harsh chill fills the room and rips Draco from unconsciousness. Goosebumps emerge across his sweat-covered skin, a disorienting contrast to the flames of his nightmare. His lungs heave to keep up with his heart’s demand for oxygen as Draco attempts to anchor his brain to reality. He’s in a bed, covered in
“Hm,” Draco hums and sags in his seat. Letting a fully grown wolf stay in the clinic any longer than strictly necessary was out of the question, of course. Her wounds healed, and the infection cleared. But she was still weak when May released her just outside of town less than two days after her injury. Harry followed her into the woods to make sure she took off in the right direction but hasn’t seen her since.
“So are those Weasley products,” he says, avoiding the unasked question.
“What are they?”
“If I have to eat another bowl of diabetes-inducing cereal, I’m going to snap,” Draco says, lifting the edge of a pancake with the tip of the spatula and shaking his head at the underdone batter. He stifles a yawn with the back of his hand. “And any breakfast other than diabetes-inducing cereal takes time. I’m sure you can fill in the rest.”
“What sick fuck decided to put gravy on a biscuit?” Draco asks, eyes wide in disbelief.
at him. “Well, blended cores were kind of Sam’s thing,” Harry continues as Draco regains his composure. “Two cores fused into one wand; the process is a nightmare. Most wandmakers sneer at the thought, but Sam didn’t really care what other people thought.”
Potter shrugs. “Dunno. Their form waxes and wanes with the phases of the moon. On a full moon, you can actually pet them, but on the new moon, you can’t see them at all.”
Draco scoffs impatiently before arguing, “You used to be the victim of that sentiment. Not to mention your compulsion for righting wrongs and correcting injustices. Odd to hear those words come from you.”
In the surreal morning twilight, it’s easy to take in just how deep they are into the wild. Potter’s cabin is cocooned by towering trees and brush, like he carved out a little bit of wilderness and dropped it in. The cabin is small, with a workshop tucked to the back of the yard. It’s beautiful, of course, but the unnatural quiet of the winter woods makes Draco uneasy, as though he’s waiting for a shrill scream to interrupt the silence.
he prods, but his lips only quiver from the cold.
“What?” Potter clips when he opens the door.
at the tips of their wands. Draco reflects methodically on the day, repeating the charms and possible results in his head, occasionally visualizing the resulting patterns of light. More often than he’d like, his thoughts return to Potter’s tale about his first wand and the downturn of his eyes when he spoke of the sacrifice it took to make it.
“Hey!”
A chorus of howls echoes in the near-distance, reverberating off the trees until it’s difficult to distinguish its origin. The hair prickles at the back of Draco’s neck as he looks at Potter.
“That wasn’t so hard, was it now? I shall return the gift of honesty, Draco Malfoy. This is my shop, along with my girlfriend, Meg. It used to be her grandfather’s shop until it wasn’t. We moved here from California a few years ago. It was atrocious until it wasn’t.”
“What more is there to do? We’ve calculated and recalculated and planned and replanned. At this point, we’ve just got to go with it.”
“Harry.”
Draco doesn’t think he’s ever talked to anyone about why he’s done the absurd things he’s done over the last few years. Overthinking these decisions often leads to indecision on his part. In this particular situation, he found it much simpler to act. But, muffled by the sounds of late-night Parisian traffic and Pansy’s failing aircon, his thoughts ran unleashed. Whether he wants to admit it or not, Draco knows why he went to medical school. He knows why he’s here, and it’s more embarrassing than not knowing at all.
“That wasn’t funny the first time, and it isn’t funny now. What on earth is that ridiculous cabinet, and why does the drawer glow?” Draco snaps and gestures at the white box.
last evening and, as a result, hasn’t yet eaten on this continent. Instead of confessing so, however, he shrugs and says, “I could eat, I suppose.”
Draco reminds himself, but immediately regrets it when his mind supplies him with an onslaught of unwelcome memories. He shakes his head to rid his mind of the violent images and turns away to start back down the gravel path, away from the house. It only takes a few steps before he stops again, humiliated that something this trivial would make him feel so lost. He sags further under the weight on his shoulders.
“What is this?” Draco asks, relieved to change the topic of conversation.
As he coaxes stray tufts of hair back into place, Draco seriously considers the state of his sanity, as well as the likelihood of getting a flight, and then another set of Portkeys, back home. He quickly dismisses the thought, if only because Pansy would never let him hear the end of it.
If anyone had told Draco that his culminating experience as a Junior Healer would be this, he would have scoffed, surely, if not cackled uncontrollably. Yet here he is, gilded in the golden light of the setting sun, staring out at a world that unfolds under his feet, and standing next to Harry Potter in the middle of the wilderness. Draco smiles at the view and ignores the aching tug in his chest.
“No.” Draco shakes his head and straightens in his chair. “Put it on the stack.”
A group of children clumsily build a snowman down the way, tumbling about in the street. Their young and underdeveloped magic isn’t quite enough to convince the snow to hold. They laugh anyway.
“Fuck, Harry, stop scratching. What did you do?” Draco reaches for his wrist instinctively, feeling Harry’s steady pulse under his fingertips as Draco twists his arm towards the light.
“We’re eating breakfast at a bar?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Potter answers stiffly, frowning.
Draco has not worked this hard to be stopped short because of some stubborn Gryffindor that can’t let go of the past. It’s certainly a setback, needing to rely on Potter to finish his schooling, but it’s not unmanageable. And, regardless of how unfortunate these circumstances are, they cannot be changed. Whoever was waiting for him on the other side of the globe was out of his control.
wood?”
“Sure.”
“That’s none of your goddamn business, Malfoy.” The agitated current of Potter’s magic kisses Draco’s skin like a static shock. Draco leans in, nearly nose to nose, and feels the prickly heat roll off of Potter in waves.
Draco stiffens his spine before he answers. “You said you had some things to show me. I’m the student; you’re the teacher, remember?”
“Come on, Malfoy, that’s no excuse. What do you think it means? How does it
“Uh, Draco?” Harry nudges Draco’s shoulder with a heavy hand. “You okay in there?”
“Well, if you’d showed up a few years ago, you would’ve been right. I was fucking awful at it for a long time,” Harry admits, but his eyes remain bright and his smile, undeterred. “Nearly drove Sam crazy, sometimes.”
The out-of-this world artwork in this chapter is thanks to the wonderful and talented
Draco fidgets with the frayed edges of a quilt before answering, “No, I don’t think I would call it sleeping.”
“And here you are,” Draco says with a dramatic flourish, earning a smile from Harry.
“I don’t know… You seem to like the technical stuff,” Harry answers. An anticipatory pause hangs between them as Harry tugs his lower lip between his teeth. Apparently deciding against restraint, he says, “You’re good at it.” He picks a quill out of a plastic cup and peels at the fine feathers, but Draco’s eyes linger over the rosy pink that tints Harry’s cheeks.
“Chicken shit. Do you see a Veterinary Healer anywhere? Pass one on your way here, by chance?” May nearly growls herself.
On the screen, Draco recognizes the same men from Potter’s calendar, chasing each other around an ice rink with sticks and slamming each other into the barriers. He’s not sure how long he stands entranced by the television before Potter comes back in from the kitchen.
Potter holds out his wand and balances it in the palm of his gloved hand. “The first wand I ever made. I was unpracticed, impulsive, so angry at everything. When you remove a piece of wood, you’re taking more than the physical tree itself. You’re taking part of its core, what makes it magical. I overdid it, went too far. I didn’t have much control then. The wand works brilliantly, but the tree will probably never recover.” He sighs and pockets his wand. “Do you get it, though?”
Malfoy. You’re so full of shit,” Potter spits before backing away. “Don’t pretend like you know anything about me.” It’s this idea that, for some reason, bristles Draco’s already-sensitive nerves, rubbing them raw and painful. Rather than take the time to examine the feeling, he pushes it aside and unleashes his tongue instead.
Draco pauses, and he realizes what Harry’s said is true. “Fair,” he admits. And then, with a smile, says, “You’ve gotten soft,
and Sticking Charm as he treks in the direction of Potter’s cabin, buzzing with the intoxicating influence of sugar and Fee’s easy laughter. The thought of interacting with Potter dampens Draco’s mood, but his boot-clad feet carry him up the hill regardless.
“We’re well acquainted, I’d say.” As though confirming his answer, the last remaining wolf turns a steady gaze on Potter before fading off into the woods.
“What about me?” Draco asks.
“Oh.”
“You’re quite bizarre. I hope you know that.”
“All right, so think of this step like that. Soaking the wand in the
He’s not so comfortable as to tell her anything substantial, but Draco supposes he can spare one secret, for the sake of first impressions, of course. Truth be told, Draco’s hardly talked to anyone in days, and it’s a bit freeing to have control over his own narrative for once. A mixed rush of excitement and anxiety flutters in his chest as he considers the importance of what he says next.
May, with her unfathomable energy, still watches over the wolf from her stool. Despite the harrowing experience, she wears a satisfied grin as she casts a
“Of all people,” Potter growls, turning wild eyes on Draco. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
It doesn’t take long for May to rise and scuttle about the clinic. She emanates a restless energy as she fiddles with her plants and rearranges the misplaced bottles of herbs,
Draco’s hand stiffens with a cramp as he scratches out the last line on the final page of his notebook. The pages have filled rapidly over the last several days with calculations and notes. Some lines are crossed out and corrected, while others are crossed out, only to be rewritten later, word-for-word in the spare margins. Though it was painstaking, eventually, Draco had managed a recipe for a more concentrated—but stable
“And heating the core material does the same for the core?”
“Didn’t take you very long to come up with that question,” Harry notes.
Potter smirks. “Don’t really care. But…” He chews on his lip, breath seeping through the gap between his lips like cigarette smoke. “Who am I to judge if you wanted to disappear?”
“Thank you, Draco. My bones are not as green as they once were.”
“Pleased to meet you, Rory.” Draco extends a hand and a pleasant smile in Rory’s direction, which they accept graciously. There’s a kindness in their eyes. It’s a sort of unconditional warmth that makes them seem trustworthy; like Draco could show up to this bar crying, and they would feed him and rub soothing circles into his back while he sobbed.
“Actually, Potter and I know each other from school. I am already intimately familiar with how
“Why bother with two cores?”
“And yet I get no answers,” Draco retorts, sinking back into his seat and covering a fake yawn with the back of his hand.
“Potter, I am half the world away from anything and anyone I have ever known! You can’t—
“Come on, Draco, you know the solution to that one… Think about it.” Harry taps his finger against his head and grins, the last sliver of golden sun reflecting in his eyes.
and liquor.
Draco huffs in frustration and circles the trunk, reaching out to lay his hand across the rugged bark. A hollow and aching feeling emanates from within—he senses it in the patterns, the colors, the life of the tree. It’s a slow and sludgy sensation, like the irregular and defeated beat of a diseased heart.
Draco fumbles with the shirt and holds it in his hands; the thick wool fabric is rough under his fingertips and still warm from Harry’s body heat. It smells faintly of pine and sweat and fresh air. A small flicker of horror flashes in Draco’s gut when he realizes it smells like
“Good as new.” Draco releases Harry’s wrist like a hot iron, but a phantom burn still sears his palm.
“No, not at all,” Harry chuckles and proceeds up the trail. “About eight months ago.”
Draco stretches his tired legs and knocks his head against the brick hearth behind him. He watches the even and comfortable breaths of the sedated wolf, noting an occasional twitch in her foot or shift of her ear as though she’s running in her dreams.
“Only restaurant in town,” Potter mutters in response.
“You’re always full of questions. It’s my turn,” Harry calls over his shoulder, inciting a few early birds to flee from the trees ahead. His pace slows to a meandering crawl as the trail steepens.
Potter lets his hair down and runs a hand through the damp waves, and Draco stares awkwardly as Potter uses his shirt to wipe the fog from his glasses. Clear vision restored, Potter’s eyes focus on Draco, curled in the armchair and probably looking a mess from sleep. Self-conscious, Draco runs a hand through his own hair and straightens his shirt. He wrinkles his nose in irritation that, years later, Potter still irrationally rattles his nerves.
An ear-piercing caw interrupts Draco’s thought. The screech is followed immediately by a spectral harpy eagle that glides through the window and perches on the table in front of Draco. It’s May’s gravelly voice that rattles from its beak.
“Had to take advantage of wolf-Harry, didn’t I?” he asks with a crooked grin.
When Draco decided to become a Healer, he’d done so without much thought. It was his first summer off of probation, and he’d spent weeks lounging in Pansy’s Parisian flat, sweaty, aimless, and miserable. Truly, he adored Pansy and her inclination for a life of leisure, and even to this day Draco considers Pansy his closest friend. But the lack of direction made Draco anxious with unspent energy. All it took was a single
Harry laughs. “Ah, I forgot about that! You were such an arse back then.”
This chapter contains a very brief, but somewhat detailed, description of the healing of a minor human injury.
biscuits. They’re covered in butter. Just eat it,” Harry sighs, shaking his head.
Harry considers for a moment, pulling his lower lip between his teeth and gnawing at a chapped bit of skin. A bright spot of blood blossoms under his bite, and he sucks his lip between his teeth.
“Oh.”
Draco’s pride swells at the compliment, but he doesn’t linger on it too long as Harry dives into an explanation of the schools of thought around the manipulation of wand cores. Harry gestures generously as he explains the initial preparatory steps for the wand and core materials.
There has to be a give and take.”
“Of course you did. Get to the good part, human-Harry; I’m getting bored.”
with her back to Draco. She waves sharply over her shoulder to invite him to the back of the cramped and humid clinic.
Harry grimaces.
The witch simply smiles, closed-lipped and distrusting as she lowers her wand. “We don’t get strangers around here often, and, when we do, they tend to be drunk No-Majes who wander past the repellant charms.” She pockets her wand and extends a manicured hand. “Name’s Fee. Well, Ophelia, but everyone calls me Fee. Who are you?”
The snow crunches under Draco’s shoes as he rounds the front of the vehicle, and he slips when he climbs into the car. He can feel the embarrassed heat on his neck and thanks Salazar for the thick scarf that shields it. It was definitely not a given that Potter would care that someone in the Ministry may (or may not) have gotten Draco here. A bit curious but satisfied he’s made it this far, he hugs his shoulder bag to his chest and stares straight ahead.
Potter is apparently not the only wizard who likes to drive, for whatever irrational reason, as a few Muggle cars are parked along the street. The bits of snow that make it through the bubble melt on impact with the windshields. It seems some of the same Heating Charms that Potter laced into his pavement are woven into the vehicles.
Leave it to Potter to have the means to escape and never look back, without worry for his reputation or ability to survive. Leave it to Potter to fuck off to the middle of nowhere with no consequence or criticism.
“Yes,” Draco confirms, watching carefully as the wood fizzles on impact with the liquid. “And some make absorption poorer; it just depends on the food and vitamin in question.”
Smile fading, Harry casts a distrusting look at Draco. It sends an unwelcome pang of hurt to his chest. Draco is no monster, and it bothers him that Potter would doubt his capability of interacting politely. In fact, of all things Potter could worry about, Draco’s ability to project a mindless modicum of respect should be last on the list. Years of pure-blood charity dinners, holiday balls, and stiff meals as the Dark Lord presided over the dinner table have prepared him for any and all situations that demand manners.
Harry watches from his spot at the table with a curious glint in his eye. He blinks several times before rushing Draco towards the door. “Don’t mention it. You should probably go before she sends another Patronus. Those bloody eagles are nasty, even if they can’t actually bite.”
knew and loved?”
Harry stumbles back down the trail, knocking a rock loose with a clumsy step. He stops next to Draco, but directs his gaze outward, towards the gulf. “Hey.” He nudges Draco with his elbow. “Look.”
“What?”
“What’s it hurt to try? Come on, Harry. Where’s that reckless Gryffindor we all knew and loved?”
An oppressive silence fills the space between their seats as the car is swallowed further by the tunnel of trees.
“May, I’m not a Veterinary Healer. I’ve had no training,” Draco argues, stepping away from the wolf as a half-hearted growl escapes her lips.
Draco sneers at a group of children that stare through the spokes on a porch railing before following Potter across the street.
“All right, fine,” Draco says in exasperation. “But that does
“I can hardly stand the wait.”
“But—”
Draco grimaces at the unease in his gut and, rather than unraveling that mess, chooses to look at the bag he’s just been handed. He scrunches his nose at the oily slick on the paper, opens it, and is greeted by a heavenly smell of grease and butter.
“A lot of wood. But I didn’t damage any of the trees! I swear!” Harry laughs, and Draco wonders when he became addicted to hearing that sound. “But I believe the park rangers would have frowned upon the taking of the wood to begin with.”
“Are you kidding? Of course not.” Draco reaches for the hovering paper cup and relishes in the warmth that seeps through the fabric of his gloves. The prickle of a Heating Charm materializes over their seats, releasing a sudden plume of steam into the air. Draco glances at Harry with eyes narrowed, but Harry takes a conspicuously timed sip of hot chocolate, only raising his eyebrows in answer to the unasked question.
Harry clears another portion of the path and stops. His expression is unreadable as he turns, and Draco squirms in discomfort of the ambiguity. “Do you ever stop complaining?”
Fee grins wickedly and leans forward to whisper, “People like to tell me their secrets.”
Draco wipes the sweat from his brow and coaxes a crack from his spine before turning back to the wolf’s wounds. Wide and irregular gashes ooze a mixture of blood and pus where the trap’s teeth burrowed deep into her thigh. Draco hopes the bleeding has slowed enough for him to pack the wound for the final time that afternoon.
So here Draco is, in the middle of nowhere, spending his last semester as a Junior Healer studying alongside an experimental American wandmaker. Just the thought of the possibilities and their implications makes Draco stand a little straighter as he looks out the frosted window to watch the little plane take off into the dark, indigo sky.
“I am unable to resist the influence of your
Draco follows Harry’s direction, and the view borrows the breath from his lungs. A hazy mist hangs over the gulf, pierced by the lights of ships and the setting sun in the distance. The evening paints the sky in blood oranges and muted blues that reflect off of the icy chunks floating on the waves. Below, the streetlights and windows of Volchii emit an incandescent glow, veiling the surrounding forest and mountains in a rusty amber light.
“No,” Draco says. “Not really.”
“Shut it… I went on a road trip up the West Coast a couple years back. There’s a highway in Northern California that cuts through the redwood forests. They call it the Avenue of the Giants.”
An eye roll precedes Potter’s answer. “They give the tires better traction in the snow, so we don’t slide down a mountain and die.”
“What’s the verdict?” Potter asks.
It’s messy and cluttered and falls perfectly in line with his memory of Harry Potter, despite the unfamiliarity.
Draco stumbles sleepily into the kitchen far too early in the morning on the first day of March. With a yawn, he casts a Heating Charm and sparks a flame in the hearth to combat the bitter cold that seeps through Harry’s leaky kitchen window. The coffee maker bubbles and hisses as Draco hovers over a frying pan at the hob, spatula in one hand and the other hand planted firmly on his hip.
Draco thinks as he shrugs a small bit of weight from his shoulders.
“I’m not in a bad mood. It’s five in the morning.”
“No, I don’t.” Draco frowns. “Where’ve you been so early?”
“Oh.” Draco’s stomach growls in retribution for the unnecessary hours of hunger the night before.
With a satisfied smirk, Fee drops his hand and whispers a
is that you? Come quickly.” May huddles over a mound in the corner of
Harry wrinkles his brow as he peers at Draco’s messy notes and absently picks at a scrape on his forearm. “No such luck. What if we use hawthorn for the wand?”
Unsure if Potter is joking or not, Draco ignores the grim answer to ask a final nagging question, “Why are we driving?”
“Just back then?”
May sets the hot chocolate on a shelf and holds her arms wide open, inviting Harry in for a hug. She makes no move from her stool, however, so Harry stoops down to wrap his arms around her tiny and frail shoulders. He pulls back to allow May to place her hands on either side of his face and tenderly pat his cheeks.
Every lesson was a puzzle, and every answer led to another question. How does a patient’s magical core impact the efficacy of a Blood-Replenishing Potion? Does deep magical damage heal over time, or will it forever impact a patient’s magical energy and affect future treatment? How might different properties of a wand affect the complex Healing spells he used every day as a Junior Healer?
Potter stops to turn towards Draco, an arrogant grin on his face. “Well, you’re not going to get very far without wood.”
that you lot haven’t come up with yet?”
“Peaches,” Draco echoes. “I could eat them plain or cooked, with a little bit of honey or cinnamon. I could grill peaches, sauté peaches. I could freeze them and eat them like a popsicle. Make a smoothie. They’re extremely versatile. And delicious.”
“You have got to be kidding me,” Draco drawls, allowing his muscles to relax. “How have I not noticed this? More importantly, how have you managed to keep it a secret for so long?”
“The biggest privilege of making the rules is getting to break them,” Harry explains.
Potter quirks an eyebrow as he places the tin in the oven. “You don’t know what roast beef is?”
here, Potter?” Draco drawls smoothly, leaning forward to tent his hands on the table.
or something—I don’t know.” He laughs but halts quickly. “That reason was as good as any, though. I left the next day.”
“Not biscuits, like
“Anything besides rote memorization?”
“All right, last one, and we’ll call it a day,” Potter says as he approaches a towering and sturdy pine. Its branches are full and healthy, easily withstanding the harsh conditions of an Alaskan winter, and it stands several feet taller than the trees around it.
“Yes. She was lovely and… slightly intimidating.”
“There isn’t a class on wandmaking or how it relates to healing. It’s a rather new field, to begin with, quite experimental.” Not entirely satisfied with his own explanation, Draco adds, “You’re the professor here, so teach.”
Towards the docks, most of the town’s occupants are scattered in a wide half-circle, with Rory taking center stage. Some people stand, huddled together for warmth, while others sit on folding chairs or fallen logs. Puffs of steam curl from the Heating Charms that encase each little group. A handful of children chase each other with sparklers, laughing and screaming as glittering animals burst forth from the tips of the glowing sticks. The glimmer of a massive Shield Charm catches the light of the nearly full moon over the gulf.
“It is. It’s amazing; even smells amazing—”
Potter simply shrugs. “You read the charms right, don’t worry. But something feels off. I don’t really know how to describe it… you just feel it. You’ll feel it too, eventually.”
“Of course I did,” Draco lies.
Draco does not subscribe to the idea of a deity, but he imagines if there is one, they would be laughing at him about now. He’s certain Pansy would be, which is probably worse.
“I think so. Don’t ask me why, though.”
“But the core—”
“That’s kind of genius.”
“Life’s not fair,” Potter grumbles and stands to take his plate to the sink.
“Liar,” she chuckles, crossing her legs and bouncing her foot.
“What the fuck are you doing, Potter? Have you gone mad?” Draco hisses, his heart threatening to leap from his chest. His mind supplies him with images of Fenrir Greyback skulking through the Manor, of his rotting, overly friendly smile whenever Draco entered the room, of the anguished cries that rang from the cellar on a full moon.
“I’m sure she’ll turn up. Probably just resting… laying low while she gets her strength back,” Harry says.
It bothers him more that it bothers him at all what Potter thinks.
Draco turns back towards his notes on the table as Harry moves to stand over his shoulder. The bright and musky scent of the woods clings to Harry’s skin, mixing with the palpable crackle of his magic. After spending time running with the wolves, quite literally, it rolls off of him in waves.
Draco thinks—“so can you imagine that, just maybe, you aren’t the only one who’s changed?”
“And to be honest,” Potter continues, “I don’t really feel like arguing about it right now, either.”
“Some habits are too hard to break. Like irritating the shit out of blond gits.” Harry grins. “What’ve you got here?”
Draco casts the diagnostic charms at the tree, nearly second-nature by now. He leans into his hip and watches the colorful patterns swirl about the trunk and lower branches. The intricate linework is a vibrant green and pulses with a liveliness that makes Draco take a step back.
“Peaches?”
“No point, just an observation.” Draco takes his own plate over to the sink, leaning against the counter next to Potter. The corner gnaws at Draco’s pointy hipbone, but he doesn’t dare flinch. Drawn by the thrill of kindling Potter’s fiery temper, Draco stares intensely and watches Potter set the washing charms. “I’m impressed, is all,” he professes. “To grow out of stubborn, ingrained naivety is quite an accomplishment, Potter.”
just leave me here.”
“Where did you get stuff for pancakes?” Harry asks, still peering over Draco’s shoulder. “You know these are… different… from back home?”
“And they know you?” Draco asks, raising a skeptical eyebrow.
The children scream and squeal every time a new spark of light bursts across the star-covered sky, joined by the cheers and applause of the older onlookers. Harry whistles through his fingers and claps, nudging Draco’s shoulder when Draco plays along. Another firework explodes over the gulf, but Draco can’t keep his gaze from migrating back to Harry’s smile.
Draco keeps his eyes on the ground as they hike through the forest behind Harry’s cabin, in search of the perfect tree. Earlier that week, Harry had shuffled through his piles of wood, cursing and groaning as he tossed each and every one to the side, unsatisfied. He’d planted his hands on his hips in the middle of the workshop, eyes frustrated and hair crazed from irritated fidgeting. “We’ll just have to get a new one,” he’d declared before extinguishing the fire and stomping towards the cabin in search of lunch.
“I…” Draco pauses. “That was fast.”
“Sure does.”
“They wanted what’s best for me, but I don’t think they really knew what that was. They tried. But they had each other, and I, well… didn’t. Ginny’s been the best about this, even though it didn’t—er, work out. ” Harry flushes and looks sheepishly at the quill in his hands. His lips morph into a subtle grimace. Every thought plays out in the twitch of Harry’s lip or squint of his eyes until he settles on words to speak aloud. “It was actually Luna who told me about Sam. How she knew about a wandmaker on the other side of the world, I haven’t got a clue.” Harry raises his eyebrows. Apparently, Draco isn’t the only one mystified by the very existence of Luna Lovegood. “Anyway, Luna said Sam was looking for an apprentice. She said the fresh air would help
“Well, if it was a choice between chronic overcomplication or being an arrogant git, I’m glad you went with overcomplication,” Harry says, grinning. “I mean that in the nicest way possible, of course.” There’s a softness to Harry’s gaze, and Draco tries to remember if anyone ever looked at him like that.
“Should we be worried?” Draco asks as another howl sounds, growing louder.
They give Draco a friendly nudge with their elbow and stand from the booth. “Well, I’ll give you time to look over the menu then, darlin’. Lord knows Harry doesn’t need it. He’s in here so much, I think he’d starve without me.” They pat Potter on the head before checking on another table.
“Willow has excellent healing properties.” Draco pulls his shoulders back and glares at Potter as he strides across the grass, soggy from the melted snow.
he thinks as he dismounts on shaky legs from the horrid machine.
“Are they dangerous?” Slowly, the rest of the pack starts to trail off behind the leader. A faint glow lights their path until they disappear into the dense underbrush. Potter recasts his
The wolf slinks across the yard, its careful steps muted by the thick bed of snow. Its ears, coated in a dark chocolate fur, twitch at sounds inaudible to Draco’s mere human senses. As though pulled by a string, Draco leans forward, and the windowsill creaks beneath his weight. The animal immediately turns at the sound and fixes Draco with a cold, intelligent gaze. Draco can only stare back until the wolf grows bored and takes off.
“Look,” Draco says, voice a tad frantic. He takes a deep breath before continuing. “It’s been, what… almost ten years? You are clearly a dramatically different person from who you were”
Draco nudges a bit of snow with his foot, uncovering the gravel and dirt underneath. “No, probably not.”
Though he wouldn’t dare speak it out loud, Draco recognizes the gentle but firm grip of fear in his chest. He picks at his cuticles and considers the idea that all of this work may be for naught, after all. But another hand digs its nails into Draco’s ribs, demanding attention. A small, but white-hot flame of anger kindles in the marrow of his bones, igniting the damaged patchwork of nerves across his chest.

“Don’t what?” Draco asks, an innocent grin on his face. His smile falters when he opens the menu to find twenty variations of eggs and cheese.
Draco rises, collecting his coat and scarf before responding, “You know, Potter, I could stand here and argue with you. I could get on my knees and apologize for what I’ve done, or what I think, or how I feel about you, and this town, and this fucked up situation we’ve found ourselves in. Is that what you want?” He gasps for air. “It wouldn’t matter. You wouldn’t listen anyway.”
Potter sighs and smooths a gloved hand over his face, smudging his glasses. “Fuck me.”
Draco’s brow creases, not having a clue what
From then on, every rock that was thrown at him, he used as a stepping stone. Succeeding was a necessity. He could ignore the rest.
“You’re impossible.” Draco shakes his head, lost for words to combat the nonsensical reasoning. “Fine. It’s my turn. What’s the most deviant thing you’ve ever done and gotten away with?”
Harry ignores Draco’s comment as he plods ahead, wearing a light jacket and faded blue jeans. He clears patches of snow with a careless wave of his hand, exposing the rotting leaves and spindly roots underneath.
As he nears Potter’s cabin, Draco’s steps slow until he stands still at the top of the gravel drive, eyes fixed on the lit window in the workshop. In this moment, he feels a bit like the trees, buried beneath an insurmountable weight, longing for a breeze to ease the pressure from his shoulders.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Draco sighs. “Merlin knows I wouldn’t get an answer, anyway.”
“Anything else?” Potter glances over his shoulder.
to call me that, and you’ve been here for a few weeks!” Harry says, wide-eyed and open-mouthed. “Ridiculous… Well, when May says go, you don’t wait. Or you’ll learn some terms that aren’t so nice.”
“What’ll we do if we don’t argue?” Draco asks before he can bite his tongue.
“You wanted to ask the questions; this is what you get. Don’t give me that look like you’re surprised. You should know better by now.” Draco plods ahead of Harry, clearing the snow with his wand. “Peaches.”
Draco glances down at Harry’s bloodstained and wrinkled shirt. He’s fairly sure he can’t cast a

causes a nauseating pit to form in his stomach.
Potter sags before trudging through the snow to stand at Draco’s side. “It’s my fault.”
The room is coated in a dusky, purple light when a cold gust of wind pulls Draco from his accidental slumber. He looks up to find Potter dusting snow from his boots at the front door. Draco wipes the sleep from his eyes and watches Potter remove his coat, hat, and scarf. Tiny snowflakes stand out against his dark, damp hair that’s tied in a messy knot at the base of his neck. Potter is no longer the scrawny, underfed boy Draco met at Madam Malkin’s all those years ago, but he’s not exactly muscled either. Glasses still sit on the skinny bridge of his nose, although the frames are thinner, more sophisticated than the thick, black frames of yore. With the exception of his winter clothes, he could have been plucked straight from Draco’s nightmare.
“What, scared of a few wolves, Malfoy?” Potter asks mischievously. He turns to stand in front of Draco, an arrogant grin on his face, and howls, long and sweet. The moonlight shines on the long column of his throat as he throws his head back, tossing his voice into the darkened sky. When he runs out of air, he faces Draco and laughs, his eyes wild behind the visible veil of his heaving breaths.
