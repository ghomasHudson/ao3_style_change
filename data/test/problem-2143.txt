“Good. I’m only sorry that someone found you before the Hogwarts Express made it back to King’s Cross.”
“Mr. Potter,” she persisted, her voice still stronger than the other journalists who were vying for his attention, “do you feel that everyone you’ve rescued in the line of duty owes you a life debt?”
“Or even a partnership,” Harry agreed. “Not yet. But we could still marry unofficially, in front of the people who matter to us.”
Harry thought it would be a good thing if Draco did lose his touch. To lock away so many of his memories like that—so much of himself—couldn’t be healthy. But he knew in his gut that Draco hadn’t lost his touch at all.
“I have faith in you. And I won’t block any memories that concern Dobby. I retain the right to block anything else, however.”
Potter seemed to bite back the first response that occurred to him in favour of another deep breath. But those green eyes of his flickered with determination.
Ron knew exactly how to translate that. Mum hadn’t wanted anything to do with Draco, but Dad had insisted on at least talking with him. “And then what? Will he be welcome to come to dinner on Sundays with Harry?”
“Don’t worry, my lord and master.” His Malfoy sneer was back as he stood up too. Back and in full force. “I’ll give you plenty of hints.”
"It's your birthday, Ferret?" Ron shook his head at Harry, as if reprimanding him for being a terrible boyfriend, and then turned back to Draco. "When?"
“No, it didn’t. You lied to me, Draco. You told me that your father cut a deal with the Wizengamot—not that you cut a deal with Robards on your own to keep the man out of prison.”
Malfoy finally coughed out a response. Not that Harry could understand him; his face was wedged into the crook of Harry’s shoulder.
Draco leaned toward him and kissed him again. Potter didn't object, so he moved closer. Suddenly both of them were pressing against each other and fumbling and tumbling back down onto the mattress.
“No.” He rolled his eyes, but then reconsidered. “Actually, that might be interesting sometime. Hermione will think so, anyway. But for now—are you devout, Draco? Are you even religious?”
“Good, good. I look forward to hearing about your experiences there on the way to Heathrow. You learned something of muggle life in the States, I believe?”
"None." Draco winked at him and made a satisfied chirrupping sound that was impressively close to the way he could dook as a ferret.
But he needn’t have bothered. A house-elf stood trembling next to his bed, and it did not seem to have any nefarious designs on him. Everything was blurry without his glasses, but Harry was fairly certain he hadn’t seen this one before.
“Right. Well, those memories also let me see the truth: that Dumbledore suspected I was the final horcrux all along. Or for a long while, anyway. He knew I would have to die. He knew that . . . that my lifespan was measured by the remaining horcruxes. That with each one I destroyed, I was shortening my own life.”
He didn’t hold anything back; the name Malfoy didn’t mean as much to her as it did to Britain’s magical community, so she was less inclined to judge their relationship. And she didn’t bat an eyelash at the fact that Harry was involved with another man. Instead, she agreed that the diplomatic meetings could wait—as long as Harry was willing to reschedule them.
"After what, Potter?" Draco couldn't keep a sudden smile off his face. "Did you ransack Robards office or something?"
How did that beetle’s voice carry over the rest of the throng? And how did she manage to push herself up front like that? Ron almost snarled at her perfectly coiffed hair, her gleaming gold teeth and that damned quill of hers, which looked ready to scribble away.
Was he being unfair? Harry honestly didn’t know. So he tried for a compromise. “You can speak your mind about him here, but for the sake of our relationship I don’t think we should let him come up too often.”
“Sure about that? I don’t think I could have accessed that memory if you hadn’t, on some level, wanted me to.”
“A position would need to open,” Malfoy said at last. “And Robards would have to agree to hire me. And then Harry would have to give his permission.”
“That you were, yourself, a horcrux was always a possibility,” he said at last. “It was the only answer that adequately explained that strange connection between you and Voldemort. We all discounted it, in my family at least, because—well, to destroy said horcrux, you would have had to have died, just as Nagini had to die.”
“Only that—well, you know she was a wizarding supremacist. She despised muggles. Not the way Voldemort did, if only because she didn’t think about them as often. And she thought they were good for certain things. Manicures, for example. She and my mother both believed that muggle salons were superior—”
Ron opened his lips to speak, but Malfoy beat him to it. Good thing, because Ron had no idea what would have come out of his mouth.
Bill felt his eyebrows shoot up as he met Ron’s eyes. They both knew exactly what the other was thinking: neither of them had seen George laugh like this since Fred was killed.
Draco looked over his handiwork and then nodded with satisfaction. “Come on, Potter. Let’s find the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio.”
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, the life debt is permanent. But we do have the power to change the terms on which you pay it off. We already have done; that's why I can forbid the marriage, remember?"
“All right, all right.” Weasley stared up at the ceiling again. “Merlin, Draco. Nothing’s ever easy with you, is it?”
“Robards has made some more arrests,” Ron added at length. “That’s mostly thanks to you. So well done and all that.”
“No. I’ve seen some of what you guys do. We can catch you up. And you wouldn’t have to give up your, uh, special skills. Even some of the Baumgartens work regular jobs and just do that stuff on the side.”
The ferret scrambled onto Harry, dove under the covers, and ended up in between Harry's chest and tee-shirt, sticking his small head out from under the collar. Harry laughed and decided that sharing the shirt with cute-furball-Draco wasn't all that terrible.
He was testing the waters here. Hermione had never said what she thought of the ruthless way their old headmaster had used school children. And not just Harry.
He kept scrabbling and twisting, but suddenly stilled as he saw the look Potter was giving him. Well, not saw, exactly. He couldn't grasp human expressions as well in this form. But a hundred little things told him that Potter had just reached a decision . . . and that it had nothing to do with that love bite.
"What?" Draco lowered his voice, even though the room had largely emptied out. "That I was an idiotic prick to look down my nose at muggles all those years?"
Suddenly flashes of Manhattan filled Harry’s head. For a few seconds he was standing on a pier opposite this city, looking up at the Twin Towers instead of out from them. He was squashed between Shira and Jamie, shaking his head in disbelief and going on and on about how ugly the towers were, objectively speaking. How shoddy the architecture was—just two long, narrow boxes.
A few minutes later, the laptop was safely stowed away again. Draco shut his mouth as he and Harry climbed the first flight of the elaborate and rather gruesome staircase. And he kept it shut as they entered the sitting room.
Ron didn’t push him. He walked them over to a bench instead, pulling Malfoy down next to him and finally releasing his arm again. It was safe enough here. Plenty of cover—fuck, when had he become as paranoid as old Moody? Since he became an auror, apparently.
George, who had recovered somewhat, grinned up at them. “Stop. I refuse to let this conversation digress into interior decorating tips.”
Shit. That was Potter's voice. It sounded tired and a little hoarse, but also tinged with amusement. Draco turned in time to see him lean against the frame of the now-open office door.
“I’m not—Draco, please.” Harry sounded annoyed now. “I’m not looking to hold the past against you, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
"I didn't say it was." Harry put his hand on Draco's back again, urging him forward as the queue kept moving. "But I don't need your money. And, come on, think how much I'd offend Kreacher if he thought I was stealing from the handsome, perfect Malfoy heir. I have to live with him, remember."
“And there’s another place he don’t belong.” Hagrid folded his arms across his chest. “After what he let in there, after what he did to Dumbledore—”
She had never taken part in a debate on religion before; the subject almost never came up in wizarding Britain. Nor, to be fair, had it come up much in her parents' muggle home, which was quite secular—except when her disapproving grandmother was present.
It was an owl, obviously. A great-horned owl—and what the hell was that thing doing outside the Americas? Not that it mattered. Those miserable creatures were happy to hunt ferrets when they had the chance.
“All right.” Draco selected a chair—one that was near Bill but not too near—and, after lifting the legs of his trousers, sat down stiffly. “Where do you want me to start?”
“No, I’m not.” There was a rueful tone in Harry’s voice. “But I understand the value of occlumency now, trust me.”
"They had already abandoned ship by then," Draco explained. "Bound me up with some impressive charms I'd love to reproduce, and rigged the house with a muggle bomb and some petrol accelerant that would destroy me, all evidence and any auror stupid enough to come after me."
That wasn’t enough, though. “I’m not sensing anything about you sitting in a corner with those dirty books, Malfoy.”
That wasn’t because Potter had beaten the Dark Lord. No, his father had been terrified of Voldemort by the end and certain that he would never regain that monster’s favour. He probably secretly wished, and maybe even prayed, for his defeat.
Weasley was different now; he wouldn’t be as vulnerable to Draco’s lines of attack. And, in fairness, Draco wouldn’t bother attacking. Neither of them were fifteen anymore.
Harry was staring at him, he realised. There was a puzzled expression on his face, as if he were trying to work out what Draco was thinking. Fortunately, he didn't ask. He just interlaced their fingers as they vacated the cinema.
Draco scrambled off Harry, transforming back to his human self along the way. It wouldn’t dare attack a human wizard.
"What?" Ron turned a little red. "I don't care whether your family keeps the place or not, Malfoy, but I'm curious."
Potter really was doing his utmost to get himself sacked. He and Robards had been at it for more than half an hour now. Draco had only witnessed the first ten minutes of their shouting match, but he needed no great skill in divination to see just where it was headed.
But, despite Harry's thoughts on the matter, Hermione didn't believe that Draco had ever secretly admired Ron. His contempt for him had always been obvious. So this new-found respect for her husband was all the sweeter.
Draco didn't mind that scent. In fact, he nuzzled into Potter's neck to get more of it. Why not? It would annoy Potter and make himself look like an innocuous pet at the same time.
"That's true." Draco sighed. "What happens the first time Skeeter refers to you as a member of the Malfoy clan?"
Harry kissed his neck and then took his hand and led him back into the bedroom, releasing him only long enough to let him change back into those silk pajamas of his. A moment later he was spooning Draco and kissing his hair. He wanted to tell the git that he loved him, that it wasn’t too early to know that, but he resisted.
George and Bill exchanged glances at that; Harry caught them out of the corner of his eye. Neither saw fit to comment, though.
Was he out to his parents? Harry couldn’t ask right now, so he tried to say something diplomatic instead.
“Master has brought Mr. Draco Malfoy home!” The house elf’s voice was tinged with awe. “The handsome pure-blood great-nephew of my late mistress.”
When Harry finally spoke up, his voice was warm enough, if a little flat. “Hagrid,” he said, “You don’t have to like him. But Draco is, um, important to me, you know? I won’t bring him round your home again. Not unless you say it’s all right. But you’ll see us together a lot and, well, please be civil to him.”
Draco snorted. “You're definitely not the messiah or second coming or anything, Potter. You haven't brought about world peace or justice for all or ushered us all into some perfected world to come. Not last time I checked."
“You’ve never been on a plane before, have you?” Draco’s voice was flat; he was clearly not happy to let Harry go.
Draco snorted. “Well, if you want to champion the cause of prison reform, you’d do well to become auror-in-chief.”
That startled a laugh from Harry. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and grinned down at him. “Right.”
“But that's where it's complicated, isn't it? I know you were acting under duress. And you weren't even of age at the time.”
. But he doesn’t. Instead, Draco lowers him down onto the pillow. Shit, but it really scratches at an itch Draco wishes he didn’t have. Fucking Potter while he’s soft, that is. It makes him feel protective, possessive. Completely undone.
Harry pulls out a chair and lowers himself into it with a grunt. “Shouldn’t I be looking after you? You were half dead less than an hour ago.”
Sometimes it frightens Draco how well he knows Potter. If someone ever knew Draco that well, he thinks he’d explode with humiliation. But then, Draco isn’t a good person. If someone knew him like that, they’d be disgusted by what they found. But Merlin, if Potter ever finds out he’s in love with him he might actually die on the spot.
Harry relaxes. Usually, he’s not one for following rules, but right now the idea is comforting. If Draco tells him what to do, he can do it. He wants to be good for him.
“So you don’t trust me not to dose Potter with potions, but you do trust me not to poison you. Again.” Draco sucks on his bleeding lip, before releasing it. “Sorry about that, by the way.”
“Boy,” said Aunt Petunia. “This is Mr Filch, headmaster of Saint Brutus’ Institute for Orphan Boys. Say good-day to him.”
In the midst of his panic, there are three clear raps on the door. Harry collects himself with a deep breath. Is he a Gryffindor or not? Blind faith and emotional repression are what they do. He opens the door to Draco, who stands a little way back, looking up at the building with curiosity. In his hand is a leather holdall, likely containing the instruments needs to study the wards properly.
“Honestly? I’m just glad someone’s looking out for Potter.” He shoots Weasley a sarcastic smile, painfully stretching his split lip. “Not that you’ve done a stellar job of it, considering how that shit stain of a boyfriend treated him. Did you punch him, too? Or am I just special?”
Draco shrugs. “I say what I see.” He drains his mug and stands up. “I’m going to go get started. We can work on the Patronus after, if that’s all right with you?”
Well, he did ask him to talk. “Please Draco, I need you. I need you inside me.” He sees Draco’s eyes flash, and lets all his dirtiest thoughts spill from his mouth without filter. “I need it again. I felt so full, so good.”
He doesn’t want to think. He also doesn’t want to get pissed and end up plastered over the front page of the
“Did you see that?” crows Draco, turning to Harry with eyes ablaze. “I'm not sure exactly, but it's either an egret, a heron, or a crane."
Harry keeps going, building momentum. “You’re forgetting how this started. What if my head goes again, and I can’t talk, and I can’t use my safeword? A week ago I couldn’t even handle vanilla sex with my boyfriend!”
Granny opens her mouth to question him, but at the same time the shop door bursts open, once again clanging into the fallen bell.
Ron clears his throat. “I know we’re talking about Malfoy’s… feelings, or whatever, but I think we skipped over something pretty bloody massive.”
Harry swallows, mouth dry, and pulls his top over his head. He holds it for a moment, not sure whether to throw it aside or fold it neatly, not sure what Draco would prefer. Eventually he decides to just let it fall- he’s too eager to continue. Draco’s watching him from across the room, saying nothing, his face unreadable. Unsteady hands move over his flies, fumbling with the button, but he manages to get them down. He slips off his socks, feeling Draco’s gaze burning his neck. His stomach squirms. No one’s asked him to strip for them before, and he knows he’s not being particularly sexy about it. Shimmying out of his underwear, he stands naked in the middle of the room. Harry’s about to beg him to say something, anything, when he finally relents.
“It’s really not a big deal- it’s not like I’m physically hurt. I usually snap out of it after a while, anyway.”
He knows he blushes, as Draco affectionately ribs him about it all the time, but knowing and seeing are two very different things. And Harry is seeing it now. The dusky pink isn’t satisfied with his cheeks. No, it sprawls out across his collarbones and down his chest as well. He’s painfully embarrassed. His body is always going to look a little skinny, a little scrawny, no matter how much he exercises; there’s only so much you can do to counteract childhood malnutrition. His hair is always going to be a bird’s nest, but at least he’s made his peace with that. However, staring down your own erect cock is never going to feel comfortable.
Harry rushes to comply, holding tightly to his own wrists. He can’t believe he’s managed to do something wrong already.
Harry’s not really sure what he’s on about, but he’s happy enough to let it go. He’s about to smile politely and resume his quest when the man squeezes his arm in a friendly, familiar sort of way.
“Tell me how it feels when I praise you.” He runs the hand that isn’t on his knee through Harry’s hair. “How does it feel when I tell you how good you are, how beautiful.”
,” his voice soft but clear, movement comes from inside the cloud. A hint of wings, soaring motion, before the spell falters. Draco grins. “It’s some sort of bird.”
Malfoy just hums noncommittally, and looks around the room. Rectangles of sunshine slice through the attic, creating stripes of gloom and light. Boxes and old furniture are crammed onto every available surface, except for the path Harry has cleared to walk through. Malfoy picks up something that looks like it used to be a potted plant, before it died and fossilised up there, and tilts his head. Harry watches him. He’s dressed similarly to last night; no formal robes, but still over-dressed for the grime and clutter surrounding him. He puts the pot back down, and moves into a shaft of light.
“He writes very nice letters you know, excellent penmanship. You could learn a thing or two from him, Ginerva; your handwriting looks like a spider fell in an inkwell and ran across the parchment.”
Harry stops, and thinks. What Draco’s saying makes a surprising amount of sense. It’s obviously not the whole story, but it looks like it might be the missing piece of the puzzle. Yes, when he puts it all together, he thinks he can finally understand it. He understands
Short and sweet chapter just to tide you over a bit. Sorry for the long breaks but I've been pretty seriously ill in the middle of my uni deadlines, so needs must.
Potter takes off his shirt, and Terran divests him of the rest of his clothes, and Draco can’t help but be distracted a little. Merlin, but he’s beautiful. Draco wants to bite those thighs. The boyfriend starts to suck Potter off again, and then something weird happens. The memory becomes blurry, distorted, and Draco has to squint to make anything out. He can just about see Potter lying on his bed, staring at the ceiling, completely unmoving. Shit. It’s happened, hasn’t it?
Potter, saint that he is, obliges. Grinding himself against Draco’s thigh like a teenager, his breath hot and damp. Draco kisses his neck, letting him feel the sharpness of his teeth before he sucks a rose-shaped bruise into the skin. Potter guides his chin up, and kisses him forcefully, shamelessly. It’s only when he feels the wet spot through the fabric that he realises that Potter’s finished just like that, making his trousers filthy.
Neither of them had a chance at a normal childhood. Both were groomed for a role they never wanted. When had they ever just let go? When had Harry ever done something crazy for the fun of it, and not to save the world?
Harry tries not to think about what Draco’s witnessing. The memory he gave him started with Terran asking him to bed and ends with him leaving. It probably didn’t need to be that long, but without the context Draco might get the wrong idea. He needs to see that it was Harry’s fault, that he wasn’t attacked or assaulted.
“You did so well, so well.” He squeezes Harry’s arse before dipping two fingers back inside to feel his own come.
“Muggles don’t normally act like that with me,” says Harry. “Just wizards who want me ‘cause I’m Harry Potter.”
He lands on a bedroom floor, the same bedroom he was just in, though of course it doesn’t hurt. He’s not really here.
“Don’t worry about it,” says Harry. “And yeah I wish you’d told me, but only because you’re my friends, and I want to know what’s happening in your lives.”
“Whatever happened to Gryffindors barrelling headfirst into everything? I’m beginning to miss it.” He sighs. “It’s hardly a rush, Potter; you’re twenty-six.”
“I always said Millicent should be in Ravenclaw.” Draco rolls his eyes in fond remembrance. “But then she’d do something suitably evil to me to prove otherwise. It would be good to see her again.”
It would feel quite different, converting on his own and finding some London synagogue to join. The Baumgartens came with everything required, so to speak: built in places for Seders, Shabbat dinners, and the like. He and Shira would just subject themselves to the normal arguments: would Shabbat be a thing in their house? Should they send the kids to Hebrew school? And how much of Christmas should they celebrate with Draco’s parents?
Her office, it turned out, was not Dumbledore’s old one. Presumably she used that for her personal quarters but she did not wish to be so remote during the day. One had only to step inside from the courtyard to reach her.
“What about you? Are you every kind of racist?” Maybe the question was unfair, but Ron continued anyway. “I know you were friends with Blaise, but still.”
But Draco took the words as an order. "Yes. Kreacher and Toffee are preparing a Mediterranean feast tonight; I know that much. I'll take a peek in the kitchen."
Draco grinned. “When you supposedly had extra classes with him because you were doing so poorly in Potions?”
Harry collapsed on his bed with what was probably a stupid grin on his face. Draco collapsed right next to him, smiling just as broadly, so at least he had no right to judge.
He shrugged. “I’m a bit surprised Dumbledore met you at King’s Cross. It should have been your parents. Or your godfather. If they could appear to you as you walked into the forest, why couldn't they explain it all? Why the man who brought you up as a sacrificial lamb?”
Draco was underneath Potter now. They were still clothed, but he knew each could feel how hard the other was as they kissed and rubbed and frotted.
Weasley’s face would be comical, under different circumstances. Eyes bulging, mouth opening and closing wordlessly, he looks like Longbottom’s pet toad. Trevor, he thinks his name was.
Harry’s expression is indecipherable. He’s probably getting ready to make a hasty exit, but now that Draco’s broken the dam, he can’t seem to stop it all rushing out.
She beats her wings, clipping his head as she takes off, and launches into the sky. That night he writes a note, and attaches it to her foot:
Harry splutters into his drink. “That sounds like something Ron would say, though he’d probably mispronounce ‘euphemism’.”
Harry sits up, and swings his leg over Draco’s hips to straddle him. “What did you imagine, then? What did you picture doing to me?”
He can feel Malfoy’s teeth as he grins against his skin. “I need to know you’re with me or I won’t do it.”
“But you must stay and eat Draco. How would that look, if everyone arrived and we were turning you out on your ear, no meat on your bones, pale as you are. They’d think we were monsters. They’d think you weren’t welcome, and we can’t have that, because you know you are welcome, don’t you Draco?”
Weasley takes a small vial out of his pocket. It’s perfectly clear, and looks innocent as water. “Three drops should do it, they said.”
He nodded as he stepped inside. “Sorry to intrude. Breakfast is ready—Kreacher and Toffee want me to collect our guests on time."
“No, I’m the one who should be apologising.” Ron’s father stood up. “I didn’t mean to speculate on your, er, relationship with Harry.”
But ‘Master Draco’ chose that moment to stroll into the bedroom. “Oh good,” he said. “You’re finally up. Are you planning to shower or just scourgify yourself—“
It was Ron’s turn to sigh. “The three of us—me, Hermione and Harry, I mean—know Draco pretty well. He’s still a prick sometimes, believe me. But I don’t think he has any ulterior motives.”
Draco turned back to him with an odd expression and then burst out laughing. “No, Harry. They were adult books with plenty of sex. Quite explicit, some of them.”
She placed a hand on his arm to stop him. She wasn’t ready for that conversation. “What will you two tell the press? About your relationship, I mean.”
He pulled the blankets up over both of them. Draco peeked out of Harry’s shirt, breathing in the scent of him, enjoying the weight of the covers and the slow, soothing feel of each breath Harry took.
"Pretty far." Draco passed the laptop to Granger. "You ought to make a copy of all this. It's not just that we can track these wanna-be Death Eaters. I think this information tells us exactly what they plan to do."
“No!” He still wasn't looking at her, and his face was bright red now. “Sweet Salazar, I’ve wanted him for years.”
Draco noticed his prolonged silence. "As I expected," he drawled. "You will never think of yourself as a Malfoy. Nor would you consider me a true Potter."
Ron huffed out a laugh. “Yeah. I’m going to bring him to the shop when they’ll both be there. But I, um, haven’t spoken with Ginny yet. Or Charlie.”
“Draco, you don’t have to live your life to please your parents!” Harry gave him a look that was half exasperated and half affectionate. “I’m sorry if they’re stupid enough to reject their own grandchildren, but . . . you’re supposed to be serving a life debt to me, yeah? And I only care how you would feel about children by adoption or surrogacy.”
"Harry." He paused to elbow him. "Again, except when we're in public, in which case 'Master' will do."
Draco rolled his eyes. “Well, you're the closest thing I've got to one, so go ahead and be suspicious. That's your job, I reckon.”
“Let’s finish going through Harry’s clothes and do something with that wardrobe—are you particularly attached to it?” He walked up the gruesome staircase and toward the spare first-floor bedroom as he spoke, which is where they had stashed said wardrobe.
Ron—it must be all right to think of him as Ron now—leaned back into the corner of the chesterfield. Draco made a concerted effort to climb into his shirt.
George reached out and scratched Draco's head. Draco, after a glance at Bill—apparently to assure himself that the wolfish Weasley was keeping his distance—sniffed at George's hand and then rather elegantly butted his head into it.
Fuck, that went straight to Harry’s dick, so he elbowed Draco as punishment. “Get your head out of the gutter!”
“Yes, Mother. Shira already invited me.” He nodded at Harry. “The Baumgartens are an old American wizarding family.”
“Oh, she falls under that category too. We can’t leave her at the manor—my parents have no patience for her. She’s rather high maintenance, you see.”
That didn’t seem to make him feel better. He was still acting calm and indifferent, but he didn’t shake Ron’s hand off his arm and he even walked a little closer to him.
In that case, Draco would retain some dignity by excusing himself from the wretched hovel. He would find out if McGonagall was willing to see him; he wanted to speak with another animagus. Failing that, well, he owed Myrtle a visit.
“Yeah.” Harry grimaced as he stood up, wondering if he could get to the owl before Draco even noticed it—but no such luck. Draco was already walking to his side, eyeing the owl with a combination of dislike and fear.
Malfoy shot him a venomous glance. "I don't care whether he wants it, Weasel. I care that he doesn't demand more than a life interest in it."
Draco turned toward Harry and propped himself up. "You could be generous and share the comfy bed, you know."
Harry stared at him for a moment. A long moment. Then he used his hand to bat Draco’s finger away before placing it back on his shoulder, pinning him again. “Wait. You get to say it, but I don’t?”
“Right.” Ron rolled his eyes. “Look, Dad, Draco is Harry’s servant. That was his own choice. And sometimes he chooses to listen to me too, that’s all.”
Hagrid was speechless. Harry could understand why—Shira had a certain, well, presence to her. And it wasn’t her Victorian Goth look; as they had already determined, that didn’t warrant a second glance in the magical parts of the UK. No, it was more the fact that she had such a direct, frank way of looking at one. Hagrid was probably used to people trying to hide the fact that they were staring at him. Shira didn’t bother.
"I thought Draco, Hermione and I could use it to pick up Shira and Jamie at Heathrow. Apparation points are tricky there, especially with a squib in tow. And, anyway, if they have a lot of luggage—I mean, Draco says they have really elaborate Goth gowns."
“Stay at mine.” Harry ignored the fact that Draco’s fingers were now digging into his arms. “A week will give us enough time to make the upstairs suitable; you can have your own suite of rooms.”
Harry and Draco landed smoothly in Hogsmeade, in a narrow alley just behind the Three Broomsticks. Draco, however, looked disoriented—only for a second or two, but long enough for Harry to notice and bite his lip in concern.
“Oh, well, yeah,” Ron said. “Shira and Jamie will be here too. But, you know, the more the merrier and all that.” Damn it. Why did this conversation seem so stiff and so awkward? Ron had always been able to just talk with his father.
He hadn't even seen Draco since his trial, three years back. Until earlier today, he had stupidly believed that he was avoiding London and the British wizarding community. That he was traveling to places like Paris. And New York. And Buenos Aires.
Lucius snorted. “You’re pleased to have your childhood enemy under your thumb, Harry. Don’t pretend otherwise.”
Draco watched as Harry landed softly, on his feet, in the sanctuary of the suburban and rather plain shul to which the Baumgartens belonged. He gave the man a moment to orient himself before tossing a yarmulke and hair clip at him.
Kreacher was waiting for Harry when he finally arrived home, but Harry merely nodded at him before taking the stairs two at a time to reach the master bedroom.
Harry grinned at the way his customary drawl had almost disappeared in the midst of his enthusiasm. Draco was bright red now. He was obviously embarrassed, but obviously sincere as well.
"Well, put it back on track, because I do have an idea concerning Arthur and Molly Weasley and how to, er, convince them to tolerate me."
They were in the sitting room at Grimmauld Place. Harry was seated on the small, two-person couch. Draco was lying on it with his head on Harry's lap, his knees up over the arm, and an I-told-you-so smirk on his face.
Draco froze. Hell, everyone in the room seemed to. At length, however, he found enough courage to turn and face Bill. But he was trembling. George had to put a steadying hand on his arm.
“Our ferret?” Hermione let the light die out as she snuggled into Ron’s arms. “He’s not a pet, Ronald—”
“I want more than just your service and your company!” Harry tried to bite back his frustration. “We’re more than that, Draco.”
Hell, in another era, Lucius Malfoy probably would have pulled some strings to help determine the next auror chief.
"No." Harry pushed himself up a little, his anger getting the best of him. "Look, Robards deserves to be exposed. He had no right to leave you to die like that!"
But she had gone to the Burrow to see her in-laws about something or other. Hopefully that had nothing to do with him. It shouldn’t have anything to do with him, but Draco couldn't quite shake the feeling that both Weasley and Granger were worried about how the rest of their clan would react to the former Death Eater who was now both Harry's servant and boyfriend.
“Dunno. I suppose I’m not immune to it.” His voice sounded judicious. And surprisingly honest. “But I never hated Harry for his Anglo-Indian grandparent, if that’s what you’re asking. Or Granger for whatever amount of African heritage she has.”
Harry squinted his eyes, tried (unsuccessfully) to bite back a yawn, and spoke with a casual sympathy. “Um, okay. Any particular reason?”
“Come here,” Bill said at last. “I'm not angry with you. As far as I'm concerned you made up for your time as a Death Eater by serving the aurors afterward.” He paused again. “But I do have a few questions.”
“Yeah.” Draco shrugged. “That’s one of the reasons I came so frequently; I had to get to know the rabbi and all. If Shira and I had agreed to marry, my plan was to move here after her brother’s bar mitzvah and start formal study for conversion.”
Draco hadn’t been jealous. Well, all right. He’d been a little jealous. He had hated the way Harry managed to charm all their teachers. Well, excepting Snape, of course. And even he’d cared for Harry in his own way.
Draco huffed. "Yeah, well, that's not the worst of it. I didn't lift a finger when my aunt . . . . when Granger was—"
“Yes, yes. I suppose that means you don’t care about it? Good. I think it’s salvageable, though. I’d as soon paint it if you don’t think that’s a crime . . . .”
But Hermione, who was laughing almost as much as Ron now, put her hand over his mouth. “Don’t say something you’ll regret.”
How was he supposed to answer that? It wasn't that Harry thought Draco was a coward, exactly. Not anymore. But he still wasn't the sort who would willingly hurl himself into danger. Especially without minions to protect him.
“Yes, the ever-magnanimous saviour.” Lucius shook his head. “Thanks to Potter, Draco might just find the courage to defy us and form a—a domestic partnership or whatever muggle term covers two men who wish to mimic a marriage.”
"Sorry," he said, finally breathing again as both Hermione and Draco demanded an explanation. "It's just that I never thought I'd see Draco Malfoy with bed-head."
Fuck. Sleeping was not an option when dealing with concussions. Harry knew that. He also knew that they should both be at St. Mungo’s. Why had he apparated them here? It was instinctive, he supposed. Grimmauld Place had started to feel safe again, especially after all the work he'd done on the wardings.
Draco bit his lip. He had known from the start that he would have to give Weasley something. Besides, it might be prudent to judge his reaction, as Harry’s would likely be similar.
Harry raised his eyebrows. "This isn't the sort of thing I'd give you a time out in your ferret cage for, Draco."
He wasn't lying, Harry decided. Which made sense: Draco wasn't inherently a violent person. Well, he had relished breaking Harry's nose that one time, but apart from that.
Draco paused briefly at the threshold of the sanctuary and put his hand on some sort of decorative thing on the doorpost, as if he were in the habit of doing so and wasn’t really thinking about it. Then he put his hand to his mouth. Harry wasn’t sure if he should follow suit, so he just passed through.
“But he must always have felt that connection.” Harry was quick to follow Hermione's lead. “You don't choose your animagus form, remember. It's always just been a part of you, don’t you think?”
Better yet, Harry was curled up in his arms, tired out by all the ‘practise’ Draco had put him through. Well, Harry had no one to blame but himself; he was the one who had wanted to give perfect head.
He gave Harry a look. "I've been waiting a long time to put you in proper clothes. There, you do look good in that colour. Brings out your eyes and all. I suppose nothing can be done about your hair?"
Shit. Harry really should wake him. And this whole situation—if it wasn't awkward yet, it would be once they were both thinking clearly.
“Look, I’m not making excuses for him,” Ron said, “but he didn’t have much choice. Voldemort was threatening him and his parents—”
Shira made a face, but she obligingly turned the subject. “All right, all right! How did you two end up together? Draco never said there was any contact between you. Not after his trial, anyway.”
“Kreacher and I packed a perfectly adequate suitcase for you with no charms—have you hung up your suits yet?”
Potter's scent was overwhelming just now. Sweat, blood, petrol, and a lingering whiff of sandalwood that was probably aftershave. And, underneath all that, a deeper, distinctive scent that was just, well, Potter.
Draco stirred just then and moved so that he could nuzzle against Harry's neck. Harry even felt a little ferret tongue lick his skin.
Ron hesitated. “The thing is, Dad, Harry’s not going to go where Draco isn’t welcome. Even if that’s the Burrow.”
"Or should be salvaged." Draco arched his eyebrows at Harry. "Not everything the Blacks owned should be fixed."
“Dunno about that. I certainly lack the reckless courage of you Gryffindors.” He paused to narrow his eyes again. “But I’ll be brave enough to ask this: why have you kept this secret? To protect Dumbledore’s reputation?”
“Granger—” Draco broke off as he shook his head in frustration. Then he finally looked her in the eye. “If Potter ever becomes a proper tyrant, he knows he'll have you to answer to.”
Harry stretched out on his bed, satiated and almost giddily happy. Draco was next to him—curled up, relaxed, and calm—with that white-blond hair of his messier than Harry had ever seen it. That was possibly because Harry had grabbed hold of it, tight, while Draco was blowing him.
And of course Hagrid would see no daylight between Draco exaggerating an injury that almost caused a hippogriff to be put down and Draco trying to force himself to use the killing curse on Dumbledore. Harry knew that Hagrid valued the lives of magical animals almost as much as human lives.
Harry’s brain struggled to take that in. Not because he didn’t see the logic in it; he did. But the mental effort involved in curating one’s thoughts like that must be overwhelming.
“It’s fine; no magic required. We’ll just clean the wounds properly. Then I expect you back in ferret-form; you need your nails trimmed.”
“No. I’m over that, at least.” He paused to shake his head. “But that burned at the time. Not as much as the fact that you were friends with Harry, though—I was most jealous of that.”
Draco straightened up in his chair until his posture was once again properly rigid. “Sorry, Father. I would have explained earlier, but you felt it best to wait before I made my announcement.”
Hermione stared at him, and then, despite her mouth contorting as she tried to keep that disapproving look on her face, broke into a laugh. “I suppose that shut him up.”
“No!” Shit. Harry could feel his face heating up. Why was he making such a mess of this? “No. I mean it will be . . . I mean, it’s just not enough. I know I fucked up, Draco. If you want your bit of revenge, there has to be more to it than make-up sex.”
There was no explosion, as Harry had half feared there would be. In fact, Hagrid didn't even look angry. He just seemed baffled.
“I’m so sorry.” The words were tumbling out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop them. “I know you don’t want to hear it, but please believe that I’m sorry for the loss of your brother Fred. And sorry for the . . . for what happened to your brother Bill. Sorry for my part in it. Sorry that you were almost poisoned because of my stupidity.”
“I’ve loved you for years, Potter. I’ve wanted you for years.” Draco was still using that drawling, bored tone, as if all this should be obvious. “You’ve wanted me for what? Two days?”
Harry felt himself blush. After all their history, it seemed astonishing that Draco saw him that way. And almost equally amazing that he didn't see his father in that light. He had always worshipped the man.
So he was sanguine enough as he and the Golden Trio signed their names at the gate of Hogwarts. He even managed to make small talk with Weasley as they walked across the rolling lawns, past the quidditch pitch, toward the small, cramped hut.
It's, um, been a very long time! *Wears the face of shame.* My apologies to everyone who has been kind enough to follow this story. I don't intend to let so much time pass again!
Harry tiptoed past Walburga’s portrait and paused at the entrance to the massive dining room. Draco was standing at the table, with some sort of floor plans spread out before him. He was flanked by Kreacher and Toffee, who each stood on a chair so that they, too, could peer down at the plans.
"Yeah, but he'll do it all wrong with my dad. If he plays up being a good, obedient servant—which, I admit, works brilliantly on you and me—my dad will think he's got, er, what does Hermione call it?"
Draco blinked. “You think—you think what? That my wand and I will be in harmony again, since we both serve the same master?”
He snorted. “And you're still a sap.” He made to get up. “Come on, Potter. Let's get cleaned up and scourgify the linens.”
“It won’t—not until I convince Ron and Granger to take me as their third.” There was a savage satisfaction in his tone as Draco presumably imagined Arthur's reaction to such a, er, unlikely relationship.
“Right.” Harry closed his eyes for a moment, as if reaching for those memories. When he opened them again, he gave Draco a pointed look. “They were very loud and fierce well-reasoned arguments, then.”
"No." Draco's voice was sharp. In fact, he looked a little abashed because of it. "You're right about me, Potter. I've always lived under someone's thumb—I'm used to it."
“So sorry, Master.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Who am I that I should criticise the man I tried to assassinate? Were he alive, I would clearly not be fit to lick his boots.”
There were no students about, so perhaps they’d managed to come between classes. Harry knocked smartly on the door, and Draco could hear enthusiastic barking in response. A moment later Hagrid answered, his enormous frame taking up most of the doorway as his dog tried helplessly to nudge his way around him.
Draco rolled his eyes, but allowed himself to be tugged. If the idiot scarhead wanted clammy skin against his own, so be it.
Hermione bit her lip, trying to squash a feeling of gratification. A great deal had changed over the past week. Draco clearly respected her husband now and had proven, in small ways, that he was willing to accept Ron's authority while Harry was away.
Harry shrugged. “You know how to fix that. You tell Shira and your parents—” He broke off. “Your parents. They notified the Prophet, didn't they?”
“Ah.” Draco looked as though it had suddenly all become clear. “Yes, of course. You told me your plan to swoop in and save the day for me and my mother. Playing the hero has always been a turn on for you, hasn’t it?”
They were only half teasing, a fact that left Harry relieved and Hermione predictably offended on Draco’s behalf. She folded her arms across her chest, looking as though she’d have quite a bit to say to her husband on the subject later.
Draco, she rather thought, had himself fed the Prophet some nasty stories about Potter. The boys really had hated one another during their years at Hogwarts.
“Came straight from the pitch,” says Terran, stealing another quick kiss. “It’s been days since we’ve seen each other for more than five minutes.”
He rolls his eyes. “There’s no house elves anymore, and I live on my own. How did you think I fed myself?”
He comes back. Malfoy is crouched in front of him, nostrils flared and palms cupping Harry’s face. He blinks, looking around him.
He starts pouring the drink. Samuel hasn’t moved, so now that Harry’s facing the other way, Samuel is right behind him. There really isn’t much room in this little kitchen. It’s more of a kitchenette, now that he thinks about it.
- I panicked.” She looks up at Draco again. “I truly am sorry. Granny’s told me about you, about how you’ve changed.”
A week later, a visitor arrived at Privet House. He watched the carriage roll across the gravel from his window in the attic nursery, directly above Dudley’s more luxurious chambers. It was a smart and understated vehicle, built for practicality over extravagance. Harry optimistically thought that this visitor might be more tolerable than the stuffy men who always visited his uncle, or the prim and fussy women who came for tea with his aunt. It was unlikely he would get to judge this for himself, however, as Harry was never summoned before company. Which is why when Mrs Figg came bustling in ten minutes later, he was surprised to hear that he was wanted.
Harry sighs, and watches as the Healer disapparates with her patient. The trainee offers her arm to Granny, and they side-along together. Draco and Harry are alone. After all the mess that’s happened afterwards, that misjudged kiss seems like weeks ago, but it all comes rushing back to him now.
After years of pining for him it seems impossible that his love has any more room to grow, and yet it stubbornly insists on doing so anyway. Harry is a little dandelion in his heart, taking root and spreading and filling him with a thousand yellow suns. Every time he looks there’s another flower growing inside his chest. He could keep it hidden before, back when they were manageable. Now it feels like there are petals filling his mouth, and he can’t breathe until he spits them out, until he speaks.
Skeeter didn’t press for more. In fact, all the journalists and photographers seemed to grasp that Harry was not going to offer another word.
Then he remembered the intense instruction on how to become an animagus, courtesy of Shira's aunt. Because it wasn't enough to follow the ritual, which took nearly nine months in his case. (He'd had to wait for the proper weather.) There was a certain amount of wandless magic involved too, assuming one was being forced to go undercover and needed to be as inconspicuous in animal form as possible.
Harry pushed himself up and stared. Draco was standing over him, gloating. But he was also holding out his hand. Harry took it and allowed his nemesis-turned-boyfriend to pull him to his feet.
But that didn’t mean he was happy about it. “Fuck. Voldemort saw this memory? That’s how he found your first password?”
Draco frowned at him, as if deciding how much he should reveal.  “I spent a lot of time here as a child.”
“Hardly.” Draco’s tone made it plain that he had no intention of breaking things off. Ever. “I’ve known about your penchant for hurling yourself into danger and rescuing people since first year.”
“She is, but she goes out of her way to eat traif—er, non-kosher food.” He paused, looking both thoughtful and spiteful. “That’s an added benefit to kashering the kitchen actually: it will annoy Shira to no end. Jamie likes all the traditions, though, so she keeps vaguely kosher.”
Draco bit back a sigh of frustration. “I'm not a submissive. Serving a life debt is a completely different—”
“Great idea!” Harry beamed at both of them, making it near impossible for Hagrid to refuse now. “Hagrid, we’ll talk soon. And Shira, I’ll see you back at mine.”
He pulled off his tee-shirt. “There’s no changing Mum’s mind—not right now. She won’t have Malfoy at the Burrow. Dad has her back, of course. And Percy’s making everything worse.”
"No. There's no lump. No one in the bathroom either—where'd he get off to? I told him to go upstairs."
“Yes, until you find the right witch or wizard.” Draco shook his head. “I’m not going to change, Harry, don’t you realise that? I’ll always be hurting other people when I don’t get my way.”
Granger stayed up a bit later with Shira and Jamie, who were introducing her to the music of Emelie Autumn. Familiar strains of violins and a harpsichord wafted upstairs, sounding eerily appropriate in Grimmauld Place.
“It isn't, Potter?” Malfoy stirred enough to grin up at him. “Were you just toying with me last night?”
Millicent looks as if she’s plotting deadly revenge, and if he didn’t know how much genuine comradery and affection there was between them, he’d be concerned for Blaise’s welfare.
“You know how I used to see into Voldemort’s head sometimes, or even Nagini’s? Well, that was something I saw,” he admits.
Harry’s shaking with emotion, eyes filling with tears of frustration. Terran shakes his head, jaw set, and starts walking towards Harry again.
“About that,” says Harry, looking into to the last dregs of his whisky to avoid Malfoy’s eyes. “Which, um. Which way do you want to- you know?”
The fight is practically over before it starts. Jones takes a moment to splutter in surprise before he’s throwing himself at Draco, tackling him to the floor. Draco kicks a knee up between his legs, not afraid to fight dirty. It’s as Jones is howling in pain, reaching for his crotch, that a powerful gust of air blasts them apart. Harry stands over them, brandishing his wand, fury colouring his face.
Harry takes Teddy to avoid looking at his former rival. “I brought something that might help with his bath time, I know you said he hates it.”
Harry holds out his hand. “I’m going to stop you there. You have no right to bother me in private like this. Especially when I’m with my godson. I know the law, and you can’t publish any pictures of a child without their guardian’s consent, so don’t even think about putting Teddy in the Prophet.”
Harry swallows, his thoughts going in an indecent direction. Draco’s voice is teasing, and his mouth slips into a sly little smirk that makes Harry glad he’s already sat down. “Whatever you want.”
“When’d you do that?” asks Granger, her normally clipped voice blurring at the edges a little. “It wasn’t on Sunday.”
He smiles against the rim of his glass. “That’s just the truth, Potter. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to finish the job your genetics started and render you completely senseless.”
He strokes Harry’s cheek with his knuckles, but doesn’t look at him. “Oh, he’s being a very good boy, so patient for me.”
Thursday night is date night. They’re both working adults with busy schedules, so they have a night at least once a week where they focus on each other. That’s how adult relationships and communication works, apparently. Harry doesn’t have much practice with those, but Terran does, so he’ll take his word for it. Tonight’s date is a simple home-cooked dinner at Grimmauld Place, to try and take some of the pressure off what’s coming later. Harry breathes a tight sigh, and licks some basil and tomato sauce off the back of his wooden spoon. He reaches for the garlic, then reconsiders. Maybe not tonight. Adding some more oregano to compensate, he gives the pot a last stir and sets the hob to simmer on low.
Draco smiles, and presses a kiss to the fabric under his lips. The memory of his stag patronus cantering around his old bedroom in that poky flat drifts to the forefront of his mind. Suddenly, it feels a little less like a death sentence. A little more like hope.
“You know, you don’t have to call me Potter,” he says, the strength returning to his voice. “Obviously you can if you want, but- you can call me Harry. I think we’re probably on a first name basis, at this point.”
They pick their way through the detritus, careful not to touch anything questionable. As Harry touches the glass handle, the door melts away, and the opening widens. Big enough for two men to squeeze through, if not walk comfortably. Circling his wand, Harry extends the
“Don’t be too harsh on old Sybil, she has her area. She had her big grand prophecy, but the subtler arts are beyond her. I work on a smaller scale,” she explained. “We all have our talents.”
Potter’s chest is heaving, breathless. “Is sex always this good? Or do you get used to it, after a while.”
“I should have known you’d have a praise kink,” he declares, laying his head back on the pillow. “You’ve gotten so used to everyone fawning over you, no wonder you can’t come without it.”
He prods a little deeper, keeping his movements tentative. Potter’s hole twitches, trying to close around his finger. Muffling a grunt into the pillow, Potter jerks his hips. Draco places a firm hand on the small of his back to keep him still.
Harry’s replying quietly, almost a whisper, things he wants to hear so badly he almost convinces himself he’s hallucinating. Things like
“Does it?” he asks lightly, reaching down to stoke Harry’s cock. “It doesn’t feel like it. Besides, you call me Malfoy.”
“Shut up,” he snaps. He’s unwilling to explain that he just doesn’t want to be a burden; no doubt Malfoy would find a way to ridicule that too.
Meanwhile, Draco places the offending cup on the coffee table, dries his trousers, and removes the stain. “That’s alright Mrs Weasley, I’m a dab hand at them myself. I was always spilling things when I was a child, always flinging my hands about at the dinner table, so it’s one of the first spells my mother taught me.”
Draco raises his eyes to the ceiling in exasperation. “I told you, it’s the house wards. I’ve been fixing them.”
Is it possible that Harry actually wants him there? Maybe he’s still drunk. However pathologically incapable of denying Harry that he is, he’d rather poke himself in the eye with a cheese fork than be
He shrugs a little, nearly shaking Harry’s head off its perch. “Fine by me. Are you sure I can’t get you a new boiler while I’m at it? It could be an early birthday present.”
“Do you want to feed the ducks, Teddy?” he asks the baby, looking down into the buggy he’s rolling along the path. Teddy makes a babbling sound, his hair flashing yellow for a moment. He understands a lot of what is being said to him, and Harry guesses he’ll be saying his first words in no time.
“She should; I used to come in here often as a child. I’m an only child, so I’d pretend she was my sister. I gave her a name, I even read to her from my books.”
She began to slurp the tea, and motioned for Harry to do the same. Bitter leaves flooded his mouth and he froze, unsure whether he should swallow them or spit them out.
“I’m sorry, darling,” she whispers, shaking her head. She pinches her brow in concentration, and this time when she tries to moves Draco’s hair away from his brimming eyes, it moves with her. “You need to be with the living, or you’ll start to wish you were dead.”
That does sound more appealing. He forces himself to sit up, and immediately feels an unfamiliar ache. “God, I’m sore.”
“I’m not planning to make it my career, it’s just something to do for a bit. Besides, she needs the help.”
At quarter past nine on Saturday night, Harry has a minor breakdown. He’d gotten out of the shower, opened his wardrobe, and realised that every item of clothing he owned was terrible and if he wore any of them to Simi’s party then Draco would be embarrassed to be seen with him. Even now, as he holds two different t-shirts in his hands, one blue and one red, he knows he’s making a mountain out of a molehill. Draco’s never cared what he wears before, but then he always gets him naked pretty quickly.
“How is it you could eat a full English every day and still turn up at Hogwarts so skinny each year?”
Harry shivers. A delayed reaction from being outside, most likely. “Are you sure you’re not a regular? I can see you in a tweed coat.”
Weeks later, weeks of late-night conversations and tea in the kitchen, of slowly-returning smiles and soft touches, Harry was in love. And he wanted to tell him everything.
Malfoy looks at him in surprise, and Harry realises it’s the first time he’s spoken again. “No, but it happened to Simi. They’re the one who let me sleep on their sofa. We became friends, and when I said I wanted to try some things for myself, they told me about it. They taught me how important aftercare is; you have to come down slowly, look after each other, and remember it can happen to either one of you.”
Draco nods, acquiescing. “Still, I’m not sure that’s enough business to keep things going. And I’m going to  need a steady income after most of our family’s assets were seized by the ministry.”
“As a matter of fact, I am. Not all of us spend our days bent over steaming cauldrons and reading books in our armchairs like a twenty-seven-year-old pensioner.”
He prepares the tea according to her simple but thorough instructions, and places them on the table next to a book titled ‘
Draco looks down and twirls his wand between his fingers. “When I was very small, and my mother would sing me to sleep.”
Draco’s fingers tighten in Harry’s hair, sending sparks across his skin. Harry has to bite his lip to hold back a moan.
“I wanted a drink after, so I went to a bar. I ended up talking to someone, he could tell I was upset, and I sort of told him everything. He had some… ideas, about what the problem might be, so he offered to help. Anyway, it worked. We had sex.” Harry looks down into his mug, not wanting to meet their eyes. “A few times.”
She nods. “So why did you want to know? Is this girl you want to kiss-“ Ginny’s eyes widen. “Wait. It’s a boy, isn’t it?”
Even from here he can see the way Draco’s drop pearl earrings catch the light, picking up the iridescent pink-grey weave of his suit. There are still hours to go before the party- they decided to have the opening in the evening so they had the whole day to prepare- but Draco insists on rushing as if guests will be arriving any minute. Arthur’s not quite as bad, but even he looks frazzled. His greying hair seems to be flying in all different directions, reminding Harry of himself as a small child.
She boils the kettle in the muggle way, and refuses all offers of help, fetching the mugs and tea bags from cupboards built lower for her to reach. Meanwhile, Harry continues his study of the room. On the table in front of him is a deck of what he recognises from third-year Divination as Tarot cards. Three are spread out in a small arc facing away from him: The Fool, Seven of Cups, and Death.
is not the man sitting across from him and making dirty jokes. Maybe it’s time to grow up, he thinks. Hermione would be proud.
Ron grunts. “So, he’s still a dick to you then. You think he’d be grateful. I mean- you save his life, keep him out of Azkaban, and now you’re fixing his house.”
Harry coughs, an embarrassing flush rising on his cheeks. The words were innocent, but the way Draco said them seemed so suggestive.
She stands. “Believe it or not Mr Potter, I am not overcome with lust for you. I’ll leave that to your Witch Weekly Fanclub.”
Until his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter had never seen an owl. He’d seen illustrations of them; there was a book in Privet House’s library, untouched as most of the books were until Harry first cracked their spines, named Bewick’s
They make their way through damp corridors filled with upturned chairs and ripped portraits. It looks like Grimmauld place after Snape had ransacked it. Malfoy looks straight ahead, only breaking his focused stride to avoid the random detritus in his path. He’s still thin, made up of edges, but significantly taller than when Harry saw him last.
“Well,” he says, clearing his throat. “I’d have just said something very clever and highly insulting. You’d attack me, and we’d tussle. I’d be winning of course,”
“It’s elusive, you don’t know for certain where it’s going to be. Sometimes it’s luck, sometimes it’s instinct. It’s always worth it though.”
Draco looks down at the memory spooling at the tip of his wand with something like reverence. He clambers off of the bed and pulls on some pants, before striding over to the pensieve. The memory drops into the bowl. Looking back at Harry just once, before turning away, he lowers his head into the swirling liquid.
“No chance for sun bathing, I’m afraid. I’ll be in the observatory the whole time with my face shoved in a telescope.”
This time, Draco wakes first. They get ready for the day in easy silence, broken over by mutterings over toast, and tea, and toothbrushes. They don’t ask each other about yesterday’s events- they know they’re not the ones with the answers.
“Really?” says Harry, incredulous. “But it’s so much work. You could do this as a career, if you wanted.”
“It should do,” says Draco. “But I’m not really sure. It definitely used to. Since she died, it makes me feel sad too.”
“He’s invited me to the funeral. I think I want to go, and I’m sorry if this is too much to ask, but I hoped you’d come with me. I don’t think I could face it alone.”
Then Malfoy’s hands are back at his hips, spinning him around to face the table, before a hot palm presses down on the middle of his back. The surface of the table is like ice against his overheated skin as he lets his forehead fall onto the wood. Out of the corner of his eye he can see a whisky glass, still half full.
After collecting their orders and convincing Draco to stay and save his seat, Harry heads to the kitchen. It’s crowded, people just milling around, and Harry has to weave his way over to the drinks table. First, he grabs a beer for Angus. He thinks about taking another one for himself, but the image of Draco winking at his ex keeps flashing behind his eyes, and he decides he needs something stronger. He mixes himself a rum and coke, heavy on the rum. Draco asked for vodka and cranberry, but when he looks distractedly around the table, he can’t see the juice anywhere.
“I panic. It’s too much pressure, and I panic. People expect all these things from me and I don’t how to live up to this image of me in their heads. I don’t know if I’m doing it right, I don’t know what they want me to do to them- and I don’t know what they’re going to do.”
“You did so perfectly, you deserve a reward. You can move now, darling. You can move, and you don’t have to be quiet.”
Malfoy swallows. “What I’m getting from this, is that you need someone you trust not to hurt you when you’re vulnerable, but not someone you’re worried about impressing.”
“It- it was something that happened. Before. You didn’t do anything wrong,” he assures him. No, Draco’s been surprisingly wonderful. About everything.
Isla shakes her head. “Thank you, but I’d rather stay here for now. At least until the wards are fixed- I want to keep an eye on progress.
Millicent leans further forward. “You didn’t have to obliviate someone every five minutes, then? No offence, Draco, but you’re terrible at blending in.”
’.  Harry had lain with his cheek on the page, staring at one passage for what felt like hours,  trying to force himself to study. Now he’s thankful, as he tries to remember the exact words. ‘
The man goes very pale. “Of course not, sir, I wouldn’t dream of it, sir. Have a good day now, sir. Goodbye.” He tips his hat and disapparates, leaving them alone again.
Potter hums in agreement, and this time Draco coats two of his fingers with salve. When he slips them in, Potter gasps. Pushing the salve in deeper, it displaces some of the come that his perfunctory charms didn’t clean away. Merlin, Draco came less than twenty minutes ago and he’s already itching to slide right back in. It would be so easy. He imagines this is what a well-fucked pussy would feel like. So wet and ready for him, still leaking his come. He crooks his fingers, just glancing over the prostrate.
Draco keeps stroking his rumpled hair until he falls asleep. He must be exhausted. Potter’s sleeping on top of him, and he uses that as an excuse to stay. If he moved, he’d wake him, and he clearly needs the rest.
“Yes, well, my father put me up to it.” Malfoy sighs. “I should apologise to Hagrid I suppose. At this rate I’ll never finish saying sorry to everyone I should.”
Potter lowers his shoulders, his relief written all over him. Good grief, but he’s an open book. If he wants to keep this a secret he needs to acquire some acting skills.
“I gave this to my brother on his seventeenth birthday,” she says. “There was nothing he loved more than having his cat on his lap, purring away. She’d died a few weeks before, and he said he could never replace her, so I asked a friend of mine to enchant the watch to purr like she did. I gave her a memory of the cat sitting on his lap, rumbling away, so it would sound exactly the same.” She handed it to him, so he could get a closer look. “He never took it off; he was wearing it when he died. I would have buried him in it, but it was the only piece of him I had left.”
Harry shook his head solemnly. “I’m sorry Mr Owl, but I don’t my aunt and uncle would like a bird in the house. Aunt Petunia likes things tidy, and you might get your feathers everywhere and leave droppings.”
So much of this sounded familiar to Harry, his heart was in his throat a little. It’s not exactly the same, but it’s enough. For now, he feels a little less like a freak.
“Yes,” says Draco, ducking his head to try and hide his smile. “I’m not telling you what it is though.”
“I like the sound of that,” says Draco thoughtfully. “It would be fascinating work. But it still doesn’t mean anyone will hire a Death Eater.”
Harry nods, and threads his fingers into Draco’s hair, using the leverage to pull their mouths back together. They move together, Harry pressing up as Draco grinds down. He can feel Draco hard against his leg. He moves his hand to the buttons of Draco’s shirt. “Can I?”
The first people to arrive are a couple in their thirties called Jake and Tabby. Jake looks mild, average, and when Harry tried to make small talk with him, he learns he’s an accounts manager. Tabby has a shaved head covered in floral tattoos and wears a long yellow dress. She works as an art therapist and is currently writing and illustrating a children’s book. Privately, Harry marvels at their being together.
Draco still seems caught in the afterglow. He’s turned from an unstoppable force to an affectionate housecat, nuzzling into the space between Harry’s chin and shoulder. He starts pressing chaste kisses down Harry’s biceps, before leaning over to kiss across his chest. Moving half on top of him, he scrapes his teeth along Harry’s collarbone, causing Harry to splutter and blindly place his glass on the bedside table.
This time it’s Harry who can’t help kissing him, and his eyes are closed when he feels the usual two spells, followed by the new one. He gasps. It’s strange and shocking. He’s suddenly wet and open, his inner muscles twitching and clenching reflexively.
Harry’s chest aches. Not out of jealousy, or love for Ginny, but happiness. Two more of his favourite people are happy, and in love, and that was what is was really about. That was what he fought for. So people could live their lives in peace.
He runs the tip of his sharp nose down the length of Harry’s cock, and then licks back up. Harry cradles the back of his head with both hands, massaging into his scalp. Capturing the head in a dirty kiss, using his tongue like he would on Harry’s mouth, he holds Harry’s gaze.
Straining his ears, Harry can still only just hear him muttering to himself. “I’m going to kill him.”
They turn around, and realise that while a good number have dispersed, some have started to press their noses against the glass. Their eyes dart between Harry and Draco, and a with a dawning sense of dread, he realises that this will be in the
Draco starts to count, and he can feel the expanding and contracting of his chest against Harry’s back. He’s counting so slowly it feels like a minute passes between each number, though it must only be a second. Harry tries to follow, the air ripping out of him like paper. Draco strokes up and down his back, slowly, in time with the counting. After about ten repetitions, his breathing evens out.
The queue for the bar is crowded, the pub is getting noisier and he’s pressed in by bodies. Draco gets the drinks, and the night continues in much the same way. A rotating cast of classmates and drinks, Potter a regular presence by his side. Once he overhears a drunken Weasley loudly questioning his presence, but Granger hushes him quickly. Longbottom is definitely avoiding him, but he can’t blame him for that, he truly was horrible to him at school. Still, no one hexes him or even glares at him, so he counts that as a win. Time truly is a marvellous thing, when it comes to old wounds.
having taken the job more to keep George company than need for work, but it suited him. He might spend the day testing toys and selling exploding wands to children, but there’s a gravity about him. There’s no denying he’s more serious now; eyes still full of humour, but tinged with concern.
The next time he enters Granny Lynn’s shop, there is a customer. He can hear a woman sobbing in the back room, and Granny’s soothing tones trying to calm her. Earl runs out of the room to greet him, his whole body wiggling as he wags his tail. Harry bends down to rub his ears,  and spends some time looking at the items on the shelves while he waits. In pride of place, in the centre of the wall, is a golden pocket watch. While there’s no physical barrier, protective magic surrounds it. The watch seems to be vibrating, making a quiet purring noise. On the otherwise plain front, words circle the edge: ‘
What had Harry fought for? Mostly, he just wanted it to be over. People call him a hero, they think he sacrificed himself, but there was a part of him that wanted to get on that train in Kings Cross Station and find whoever was waiting at the end of the tracks. The sacrifice wasn’t dying, it was coming back.
“Once he drew a picture of me being hit by lightning and gave it to me during class,” Harry smirks at how outraged his teenage self had been at the time. “The drawing was quite good, though. It definitely looked like me.”
“Don’t worry about it?” hisses Malfoy, eyes narrowed in contempt. “Life debts are serious business, Potter.”
“I don’t think that’s how it works,” he muses. “There’s no limit to pain. You can always feel more.”
After a walk made tiring not by physical exertion, but by the relentless questions of the curious public, Harry returns to the shop. It had been shorter than usual, as he was in a hurry to escape the throng. Low voices still carry from the other room, but the noise of his admirers drowns out the bell. He means to announce himself, but a low murmur cuts him short.
Fuck, fuck, fuck. He had hardly known Dobby when his family still owned him, but of course he knew all about his fatal wound at Malfoy Manor. And Dobby was featured in all the histories of the war: a free elf, Harry’s loyal friend, and so on. One more person—being?—who had made all the right choices whilst Draco had made all the wrong ones.
He was just drifting off, dooking softly, when a rap at Harry’s window woke the both of them. A persistent, scratchy sort of rapping.
“During the trials?” Draco raised his eyebrows. “You found me attractive—when? I was a wreck back then.”
Draco seemed to understand the warning—and even to heed it. "Certain pure-blood families are good at compartmentalising, Weasley," he said, more-or-less diplomatically. "They can despise muggles and still recognise the value of using their currency."
Hermione and Harry exchanged glances. She knew he was wondering how much to reveal, but she had no answer for him.
Potter turned an even brighter red, but his voice was frighteningly calm. “As I said, he’s better off under my authority than yours. I won't teach Draco to despise muggles and muggle-borns or anyone else you and your friends deem inferior. I won't indoctrinate him or force him to join a murdering gang of wizard supremacists.”
“Huh. Well, maybe Snape didn’t agree? Or maybe he thought—I dunno what he thought.” Harry paused to fold his arms over his chest. “But he really did hate me sometimes. He kept looking at me and seeing my father. And he really, really hated my father.”
“Shhhh.” Harry shifted and wrapped his arms around him. “I didn't mean to dredge up the past. Just meant you're good at that sort of thing.”
"I changed at our bank for a hundred quid. We've got more than enough for the cinema and dinner after."
His boyfriend rolled his eyes with a pained, disbelieving look. "When you arrive, Potter. Which airport when you arrive?"
“So, um—” Ron felt his face heat up. “Your father wouldn’t have cared that his grandchildren would be Jewish?”
Harry’s face was still hot. He knew he was close to fuming, but he did as Draco said anyway. He closed his eyes and slowed his breaths. His brain wouldn’t quite relax, but he felt it quiet a little.
He still hadn't moved any closer. Bill was starting to wonder what it would take to convince the boy—and he seemed very much like a mere boy at the moment—to sit down with him.
“Well,” Shira said, “It would make my mother happy. She only has two daughters, and the other one married a no-maj. Muggle, I mean. Not that she doesn’t love Benjamin; she adores him. But she’s determined to see me marry a wizard. But she knows said wizard has to accept Jamie and not be jealous. And my mother doesn’t care about bloodlines, but my father does. So it’s better if said wizard is a pure-blood. Jewish too, of course.”
Hermione stared back and then found herself smiling again—something she seemed to be doing more and more often in Draco’s presence. But she had an excuse this time: she could remember him shamming and exaggerating various injuries at Hogwarts.
"Yeah, I did." Harry paused. "Look, if you don't really want to be under my thumb, it's fine. We can forget about this life debt. I'll still help you and your family."
But that was a tricky subject, because you had to be flexible with legilimency. As Snape had explained long ago, reading a mind wasn’t like reading a book. When you were invading someone’s head, it was all about interpretation.
“I know that. Now. Maybe I knew it then, I dunno. But it doesn’t matter. I . . . I needed those three years, Harry.”
“Yeah.” He paused to shake his head. “Most bullies sensibly go after people they perceive as weaker. People who are isolated. But I went after you.”
"Bloody-virtuous-Potter." Draco sighed again, but he couldn't stop himself from giving Harry a look of pure affection. "You're going to be the death of me."
They were both shouting now, and both seemed to realise it at the same time. Harry looked around. Fortunately, no one else was in the alley, and they probably couldn’t be heard inside the pub.
“No. I think she's trying to find the correct balance. Umbridge was one extreme, but Dumbledore was, er, perhaps too hands off.”
Draco took a deep breath. It sounded deep enough to fill both his lungs and then some. “Just that this is how I am. If you’re expecting me to change into some saint—”
Draco had only just made it to the bedroom door when Harry caught up with him. Harry grabbed hold of the prick’s shoulders and forced him to turn so that they were face to face.
Draco grinned. "Small wonder. It's not as though any Weasley has ever had a servant before. The novelty of it must be intoxicating."
The house elf bowed and then disapparated. Harry opened the envelope as Draco looked on over his shoulder.
Whatever. Malfoy took the chair without complaint, pulling the legs of his trousers up a bit as he sat down. Because of course he was sitting properly, even if he was still grimey from the explosion.
“Noa is a feminine name in Hebrew,” Bill explained. “Noach”—he pronounced it with a harsh sound at the end—“is masculine.”
Harry collapsed back down, attempting to deepen his breaths and relax for real. "It wasn't disastrous. You're better than me and Hermione never has time to study the game, so she won’t play. Ron was thrilled."
But it didn’t matter; apart from genuinely wanting Weasley’s advice—Circe help him—Draco wanted to remain on his good side. He was Harry’s best friend, he was married to Harry’s other best friend, and he presumably controlled access to the rest of the Weasley clan, which was the closest thing Harry had to a family. If Draco wanted his relationship with Harry to last, it was imperative that the Weasleys . . . well, if not accept him, at least not make Harry’s life miserable because of him.
Lucius scoffed. “Wrong, Harry. If this infatuation between you two stands the test of time, it’s all to our family’s advantage. But we’d as soon not have a torrid affair and subsequent break-up splashed on the front page of the Prophet.”
“So you were just waiting until you could get the most from me in the bargain? Protect your parents, protect Malfoy Manor?”
Yes. He was protected. Ron had promised he would see to that. Draco was probably standing in some silent corner, and Ron or another auror was probably nearby.
"Well, yes. I'm not saying there aren't obstacles. But that’s beside the point. They don’t compare to you, although if you get yourself killed in some auror raid—”
“I know. And Ron will probably tell him that too.” He pushed himself up to his feet and started to pace the room. “Unless Ron refuses to make a judgement without knowing the whole story. In which case Draco might . . . he might actually confide in Ron.”
It was a long and surprisingly chaste kiss, at first. But soon they were opening their mouths to each other and exploring each other. It seemed neither of them cared that they had morning breath or that Draco's parents were somewhere nearby or that this was probably a disastrous idea.
Since the comment somehow did not sound condescending, Draco kept dooking in response. At the same time, he squirmed again in order to change positions; he wanted to nuzzle into Weasley’s neck to better capture his scent.
“Oh, we parroted what you told us: that this is an agreement between two consenting adults. That there’s nothing legally or magically binding about it.” She paused. “We said it was all very friendly and respectful, on both your parts.”
A moment later Shira was in view, visible from her corset-cinched waist up to the tip of her elaborately coiffed hair. Draco had the pleasure of watching Harry’s mouth drop open as he took in a Victorian Goth in all her splendor. Shira might be too skinny by half and even paler than Draco, but she did have style.
To Harry’s surprise, he did. But only for a moment. Then he reached out, placed a hand on Harry’s arm, and gave him a look of sheer gratitude. “But it still helped. Knowing that it wasn’t just talk. That you really could defeat him.”
Draco’s voice seemed carefully neutral as he responded. “Yes. They don’t think it was as recent as three years ago, when we were all awaiting trial. So more likely back when—well, you remember.”
“Harry!” Hagrid’s face lit up. “Ah, you brought Ron and Hermione—don’t just stand there, come inside!”
It was hard to say what made this so heavenly—except that, for the first time since sixth year, Draco wasn't living with a relentless fear coiled in his gut. Thanks to Harry, he was okay, his parents were okay, and even Malfoy Manor was okay. And now Draco had the rest of his life to show his gratitude.
"All right." Draco looked him up and down. "First off, this debt is just between you and me—and just for our lifetimes."
“No, he despises it.” Harry sat down on the couch and placed Draco on his lap, but held onto his scruff. “He wants to be the one to redecorate, though.”
Draco and Kreacher both saw the trio to the door. Granger surprised Draco with a tentative half-hug on her way out. But he was so shocked that he made an awkward job of returning it, causing Weasley to snigger. Draco ignored that and turned to Harry, who gave him a proper kiss.
“Ah.” Draco nodded. “Yes, our master thinks Granger’ll make a fuss over more slave labour here. But she’ll find out about Toffee sooner or later.”
“What’s that lot need protection for?” Hagrid reached for three fragile-looking porcelain cups. “They came through the war just fine. Far better than they deserved.”
"That's not the point, Ron!" She was on her feet now too—they were all standing in the centre of the room—looking as if she wanted to assign detention to the lot of them.
Hermione was predictably fascinated. She asked Harry to tell her, over and over, how Draco was actually able to curate his memories and protect them with a password.
Moaning Myrtle was screaming about murder in the bathroom. And there was pain. A knife-like, cutting pain, though somehow Harry knew he wasn’t feeling the full force of it, that it was muted in the memory. And there was blood in the water as his body—no, Draco’s body, not now but in the past—shook uncontrollably.
Draco scowled. “Because I wasn’t raised as an ill-bred muggle, taught to use fists instead of a wand.”
Harry seemed to consider that. Then he put his hands on the table and leaned forward. “If you’re serious, why not give me a go right now?”
“Fine,” Draco said, breaking into Harry’s thoughts. “Apart from the make-up sex, I demand that you confess everything to Granger. I want it on record, so to speak, that you overstepped your boundaries tonight, even if you are my master.”
“I promise.” He pushed himself up to a standing position. “Are you finally ready to see those memories of Dobby?”
Harry couldn’t help but grin. These were obviously muggle business people, but their genial mix of chaos and productivity reminded him oddly of the aurors.
Harry was about to grumble something more—until Draco's words suddenly and startlingly sunk in. He bolted up and practically leapt out of bed.
Ron regretted his tone as soon as the words were out of his mouth. He hadn’t meant that to sound so much like a command. For all his new-found subservience, Draco still had some of his Malfoy pride and sense of superiority left.
Although their dresses were shorter and rather less modest, Hermione thought, than an actual Victorian woman’s would have been. That wasn’t a bad thing, of course. Hermione admired their ensembles, though she couldn’t imagine flying across the Atlantic in them.
“I’m sorry.” He finally did sit down then, but he didn’t stop about the Prophet. However he was speaking, now, not shouting. His rage had softened into something tired and despairing.
Draco had been leaning sidelong against one of the pews, but he straightened up now and moved to join Harry on the step of the bimah.
How had Harry forgotten that? He and Hermione had talked about not knowing of any Death Eater who could cast a patronus, forgetting all about Snape. Probably because they simply didn't think of him as a Death Eater—not after learning the whole truth.
“That’s because you, Potter, have no proper pure-blood feelings.” There was no malice in Draco’s words; they sounded almost fond. “Or even proper half-blood feelings.”
“I’ll just have to keep checking in, then.” Malfoy drinks deeply, then sighs in satisfaction. “What if it does happen again? What should I do?”
Now he’s a grown man, and all his fantasies are coming to life, only better. Draco takes a deep, steadying breath, and reminds himself that this isn’t a fantasy. He’s not alone with his thoughts; he has someone else to think about.
It’s hard not to think of him as Harry, when he’s squinting up at Draco without his glasses, eyes puffy with sleep. But he set his own rules, years ago, to cope with loving Harry Potter. Avoiding his first name was high on the list; it denotes an intimacy Draco doesn’t deserve.
Draco’s hurt Potter so many times it’s probably hypocritical of him to be so incensed, but he can’t help it.
Draco sucks harder, his nails digging into the crease between Harry’s arse and thighs. Harry closes his eyes, tips his head back, and lets the water run over his face.
She gestures to the room, candlelight glinting off a crystal ball in the corner. Harry understands. Granny might match Trelawney in their taste for chintzy furniture, but it seems in all other areas they are leagues apart.
Finally, Draco and Simi exit the bathroom. There were already two people waiting outside, one jogging from foot to foot, who dashes straight in after them. Draco looks serious, with creases between his brows, but Simi just looks speculative. A bit like Hermione when she has a theory.
“Still with me?” he asks, posh voice turning rough. Harry nods vigorously, and Malfoy pushes his jeans partway down, before kneeling. “You’re still wearing your fucking shoes.”
They just look at each other for a long stretch of time, Harry trying to tell him everything he feels with his eyes. Hoping he can read what Draco’s saying with his. He can’t be sure Draco can hear what he’s trying to say, and he needs to hear it, because the longer Harry goes without saying it the more it feels like a secret.
Two mugs float over to the table, and Harry takes one, the ceramic warm in his hands. He takes a long sip, the tea still too hot, burning his tongue. “What are you up to today?”
He sucks in another sharp breath, and closes his eyes. It doesn’t stop him from seeing it, replaying over and over, like a wizarding photograph. The same movement repeated over and over in a loop.
“Fuck.” He licks over his teeth to check none have been knocked out, tasting blood. Just a split lip it seems. “Fucking hell.”
Samuel interjects, reminding Harry of his presence once again. “Why would he be embarrassed about that? Any man in his right mind would want to fuck you.”
This chapter is a lullaby a wrote when I was imagining what Narcissa might sing to Draco. If you guys are interested I might make a recording and link to it here.
When Harry was eighteen, Ginny told him she wanted to be friends. If anything, Harry was relieved. He was still waking up screaming most nights, Ginny still flinched at sudden movements, and neither of them were in the right place to be what the other one needed. He didn’t even consider romance again for months. He threw himself into rebuilding Hogwarts, and when term started, everyone seemed so happily paired off. Ron and Hermione were wrapped up in each other, Dean and Seamus had made their relationship public, and Neville and Hannah were making moon eyes at each other across the common room. The students who had returned to complete their education, the eighth years, had their own quarters. This meant he couldn’t spend his evenings with Ginny, either.
Draco just holds him tighter, letting his lips brush over his scar. Despite claiming he wasn’t tired, Harry falls asleep pretty quickly after that. Draco stays awake long into the night, trying not to raise his hopes too high, and failing miserably. He stares into the dark for hours, breaking his own heart.
He alights the final step in time to see Draco looking poleaxed. “You’ve made me feel very welcome Molly, I’m very grateful.”
The water warms up, and Harry shivers. He turns around to look at Draco properly; this is the first time he’s seen him fully nude. His limbs are long, not overly muscled, but he’s felt the strength behind them. There’s more hair than Harry expected, given how fair he is, and slightly darker than the hair on his head. Draco’s eyes flicker to his left arm, before meeting Harry’s defiantly. Of course, he’d known he has the mark. It’s grey and twisted now, like a tattoo where the skin has stretched and the ink has faded. Surprisingly, it doesn’t bother him. He knows who Draco Malfoy is.  He doesn’t let himself stare at it, and instead looks up to his chest- his chest-
It almost sounds like Malfoy actually cares if he’s there or not. “Well, I just stop responding. I don’t move, or speak, or kiss back.”
The words look forced out of him. He’s gripping his refilled cup of tea so tightly the handle might snap off into his refined hand. Harry knows this is his idea of a nightmare, and he can commiserate. It’s a nightmare for him too. He hasn’t even told Ron and Hermione, and what if they can tell? What if they can just sense it, somehow?
Potter drops in beside him before he has a much of a chance to ‘shove up’, shoulders pressing together and their calves bumping under the table. Draco holds his glass out to clink against Potter’s and takes a slow sip. It’s sweet and smoky on his tongue, and he hums in approval.
Draco never said anything about that. He takes a deep breath, then an even deeper drink. He knows Draco isn’t a monk, quite obviously not, so why is he going mental over meeting someone he used to date?
Instinctively, his hand goes to his wand, but he stops himself from drawing it. “How dare you?” he says, standing up from the bench. “Get out from that bush right now.”
Harry closes his eyes, basking in the praise. It’s somehow even more powerful knowing that someone else can hear it.
He supposes he would look pale, after that. “I’ll be eating a roast dinner soon, Molly, I’ll be fine.”
Fuck. What was that? That was not normal. What would be normal is if Draco let him fall, then made fun of him for it. What would normal is if Draco turned his nose up at anything and everything Weasley. What would be normal is Harry not having had life-altering sex with Draco Malfoy just yesterday. And yet, here they are. He needs to get a grip. New plan: act normal. If Draco could do it (and he could, damn him) then so can he.
He nods, running his hands up and down Draco’s lapels. “Yeah, we can’t disappoint the room. It hasn’t seen any action in ages, it was probably really sad when we left last time.”
Luna looks at him appraisingly, moving a little closer on the bench seat. “You and Harry seem friendly.”
he vaguely hears himself chanting between kisses. Potter is reaching inside him and moving everything around, rearranging the furniture of his soul. He’s constructing Draco a new reality. One where Potter could love him back.
“Excellent. And how long might I expect the pleasure of your company? I’m always looking for someone to state the bloody obvious.”
“I heard that story so many times growing up,” breathes Aisling. “Grandpa would describe the watch to me, tell me how it was a family heirloom stolen by a graverobber, and that one day I would find it.”
Thank fuck for that. He knew Luna and Harry would have his back, and Granger and the Weasleys weren’t likely to hex him, but he really wasn’t sure of his reception otherwise. Then again, seeing Luna’s obvious approval and Potter’s lack of antagonism must go a long way.
He makes a small, desperate noise, and Draco grips his hair harder in reply. He’s spent years of his life imagining the texture of Potter’s hair under his hands, but he never thought he’d get to have it. Now he has that and so much more. It’s still not enough.
He rocks back on his heels, pausing, before stepping confidently forwards and into the shower. “Yes, you gave me these scars. No, you don’t need to fall over yourself apologising; I’m not interested in a masochistic tit for tat of who hurt the other worse. May we move on?”
Judging from the numbers, he’s not the last one to arrive, but he’s not far from it. He can already spot the bright red of Weasley and Ginerva’s hair, Goldstein between them and engaging them in an impassioned debate about Quidditch from the looks of things. Granger has her head bent close to Millicent’s, and Blaise and Longbottom seem equally engrossed. Bones and Patil are at the bar, and Potter looks bored when Draco spots him, sitting opposite Luna as he endures the rambling attentions of Finch-Fletchley. Luna isn’t paying attention either, she seems to be smiling absently as she scans over her classmates. Likely assessing their auras or some such thing.
Harry wants to whine at being denied, being teased, but he knows he’s supposed to be quiet. He wants to be good. He can be good.
‘A genuine interest’ might be more accurate than she realises. Not that he’d ever tell her, or god forbid Draco, that. Still, he’d spent a lot of time talking with Draco last night, and he’d learnt a lot of things he still felt privileged to know. The image of Draco’s original happy memory, his mother singing to him, crystallises in his mind.
A small piece of the jigsaw that makes Draco Malfoy slots into place. He had the corners, and now he has the edges that make up his life. The pressure to be the best, to be perfect, resulting in him putting other children down. As if by making others feel lesser, that would make him feel better about himself. Parroting his father’s rhetoric, the words of a man he trusted, trying to be a perfect copy. Not that it worked, in the end.
Malfoy hums, watching him carefully, and Harry’s muscles clench even tighter than they were before. What was he doing talking to Malfoy, of all people? He hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione and here he was spilling his guts to a man who was more likely to step in them than to help put him back together.
Harry leads him to the Kitchen. “You can’t start without a cup of tea.” He puts the kettle on, turning his back to Draco while he composes himself. “Granny says that there’s nothing worth doing that doesn’t start with a cup of tea.”
Harry’s stomach churns with protective rage. “Why not? How many people can do what you do? It’s nothing I’d even heard of before.”
Harry hitches a leg up to wrap around him, bringing their hips more firmly together. It gives Draco a truly genius idea. Grasping Harry’s other leg and holding him tightly, he lifts him up off the ground. Hooking his ankles together at the small of Draco’s back, Harry tips his head back against the doorjamb, breathing heavily. Draco licks up his neck, tasting salt. He wants him so much it feels like a compulsion, like dark fucking magic. He grinds their bodies together, and in the back of his mind he thinks that this can’t be comfortable for Harry, the doorjamb must be digging into his spine.
They just kiss for a long time, sinking into the feeling of skin on skin, the dragging of lips and tongues. Harry still hasn’t put his glasses back on, so everything further away than Draco’s face is a little blurry. He’s the only thing in focus. It’s the most innocent they’ve ever been, reminiscent of when he and Ginny first got together, both eager and bashful. Though, they’d been wearing a lot more clothes than he and Draco are now. Draco finally pulls away, but he doesn’t get far. He seems distracted by the curve of Harry’s neck, and starts sucking bruising kisses in the places where the muscles jump and stretch. His nose brushes a spot under his jaw that tickles, and he jerks his body, laughing, causing their erections to rub together.
Harry put the wand down, rubbed his eyes, and glanced at the other side of the bed. Empty. Apparently ‘Master Draco’ was already up and about, so he turned back to the elf. “Uh, have we met?”
Hermione found herself grinning as well. “We know what a BLT is. Ron, to kasher a house is to make it kosher.” She glanced down at Draco. “That’s right, isn’t it?”
Harry wanted to argue. He also wanted to chide Draco for the 'ginger paupers’ bit, but he'd save that battle for later.
Potter snorted. “It won’t, because they’re won’t be one. And why should it even be necessary? I know you want grandchildren, but there’s lots of ways for gay couples to—”
"Thanks for that." Draco's eyes softened. "But ferrets are also hunters—you know, ratters and such. And we can break bones with our bites."
Harry considered that. “It might answer.” He paused as a thought struck him. “Toffee, would you start breakfast please? I’m not sure what Kreacher was planning to serve, but—”
"This is about the Fiendfyre." Ron was speaking soft and low now. "Hermione and I—we wouldn't have gone back for you and Goyle. We . . . we would have left you to die, honestly."
“Oh.” Harry blinked and forced himself to sit up. “Sorry. Feels earlier. Must still be jet lagging.”
Draco stared. This was a part of the war that had never been satisfactorily dealt with in the histories published thus far: the exact nature of the connection between the Dark Lord and Harry.
She stifled a yawn—she’d probably been up late dealing with SPEW issues. “Perhaps Harry can invite your parents to dinner at Grimmauld Place next week, when Draco’s friends are there? Your mum always keeps her temper in front of strangers.”
Harry carded his fingers through Draco's hair. "Is there any possibility of you wiping that smirk off your face?"
Yet he hesitated. There was something about this door in particular. Something in Harry's gut told him to stop here, that whatever memory was hidden inside was especially important.
Fuck. Harry felt himself trip out of the memory. He was back in the centre of the floor, in the midst of all the desks and office commotion. And Draco was still leaning against a desk opposite him, his arms folded across his chest.
Draco ignored that question and continued with his own line of thought. “But then you spoke up for me and my mother at the trials. And then—Circe, Harry, I still don’t even know how you found out I was Robards’ agent. Or how you knew I was in danger. But you saved my life again, risking your own again. Not to mention your career.”
The war was over. Voldemort was gone, permanently. Draco was safe in Grimmauld Place, in Harry's bed. And Harry himself was snoring softly at his side. Or had been, a moment ago. Now he was yawning and stretching his arms out toward Draco, looking to tug him closer.
“Oh, Crabbe, Goyle and I might have inconvenienced some first years. And possibly Longbottom. But, believe me, you were my main target. Followed by the rest of the Golden Trio, of course.”
"Look, I'm not trying to." He paused, feeling the slightest tendril of fear curl in his stomach. He would never make the mistake of underestimating Potter’s temper; he’d been on the wrong side of it too many times. "You're not going to start another muggle brawl with me, are you? Because I've no desire to try and punch above my weight—"
He blushed. “Ah, no. Not really. Most of my experience came through my, er, connection with Voldemort.”
Her husband snorted. “He might well mean an end to the Malfoy line. You realise that, don’t you? He could not have found a more complete way to avenge himself on us.”
But his parents weren’t there to guard him in Hoboken or Manhattan. So Draco, Shira and sometimes Jamie would rattle their way through the tubes under the Hudson River, ending up somewhere beneath the twin towers. Then they’d exit into an underground concourse, occasionally stopping at one of the little food places before heading up and out so that they could walk the rest of the way.
Ron swallowed. He could just nod in agreement, and let it go at that. But Hermione would hear the whole story sooner or later, either from Harry or Malfoy. And she’d be furious that Ron didn’t confide in her.
"Yeah.” Ron nodded. “Now, er, take Toffee and see to breakfast for everyone, yeah? We’ve a bit of time before you have to leave.”
So he knew how this would play out: there would be a brief, poignant romance that would mellow into a sort of bemused affection on Harry's part. With luck, Harry would want Draco to stay in his life, but he would only be too happy to bless Draco's arranged marriage.
“No, you really can't.” Draco was chuckling now as he walked back to the bed, leaned down and kissed the top of Harry’s head. “Go back to sleep. Love you.”
“You deserved all that for eavesdropping.” He didn’t look in the least repentant. “And I managed to break your nose, didn’t I?”
The silence was unnerving; there wasn’t even a breeze blowing to rustle the grass. Ron finally opened his mouth. It couldn’t hurt to try for a conversation. “You handled that well. That whole—that situation with Hagrid, I mean.”
And Draco seemed to enjoy the whole thing anyway. Not in a kinky way, though. Well, maybe in a kinky way too. It wasn’t as if Ron knew what Harry and Draco got up to in bed.
Ron nodded. "I'd hand him over but he's his human self. Too tired to transform—he just collapsed into bed."
He hadn't, not really. He should have guessed it, though. Especially considering some recent conversations. But there was still a great deal Harry had to learn about Draco.
“It's serviceable.” He shrugged. “It's from the ministry, courtesy of  Robards. Olivander won't sell a wand to any Malfoy now. Why?”
But Bill shouldn't think of it—of him—as an animal. This was obviously Draco Malfoy, ferret animagus and, according to Ron, not only Harry's servant, but his boyfriend too.
“Yes.” Harry tore his eyes away from the window and looked back at him. “But we can’t spend our lives talking around it.”
“He, uh, didn’t say anything about you when I first knew him. Not that I remember. But then I had him tail you in sixth year.”
Harry was dying to make some comeback about Draco thinking he could do better—but he realised how stupid that would be and stopped himself. When it came to fashion, Draco clearly could do better.
"Sorry." Draco knew his face was probably turning red, so he stood up and collected his jacket. "Bad place for two blokes to do that?"
Draco, meanwhile, was making chittering and chuffing noises that perfectly conveyed his pride in those badges.
Robards had wanted privacy for most of the argument, so he consigned Draco to the small waiting room outside his office. (Yes, the bastard was important enough to warrant a waiting room, as if his office were a surgery. But at least it was shielded, somewhat, from the chaotic cubicles of lower ranking aurors.)
“Dunno.” He was still blushing, but there was an eagerness in his voice as he began to explain. “They’re all about the bond market, and I’m not sure that’s what I’d actually enjoy. And you want to stay here, don’t you? They have very few employees in the UK. And I don’t—Harry, I don’t even know all my options. But I’d like to see if it’s possible for me to study at a muggle university. It would mean faking credentials, and I don’t know how to go about getting permission for that, or what rules the Ministry has about it, but—”
Benjamin slouched right next to him and lowered his voice. “Look, I get this much: you fucked up. And you feel like an outcast in your world—”
“So you were never in New York, Malfoy?” Granger asked, dispensing with any niceties or any comment on his appearance. “Or Paris or Buenos Aires?”
“Yes.” The sneer was gone from Draco’s face now. Mostly. “He was important to you. To me he was . . . well, a great man—yes, it pains me to say so, but it is true. But he was far too ruthless to have been placed in charge of a school.”
Granger, Draco noticed, did not harp on slave labour or freeing house elves in front of Kreacher; she thanked him politely instead. Just as well. The idea of freeing house elves was ludicrous enough without forcing it on a traditionalist like Kreacher.
But if Harry had been acting under orders, the rescue wouldn’t have created a life debt. Or maybe it would have done, in some technical sense. But no auror would recognise a debt under those circumstances. And it wasn’t the same thing as Harry going off on his own initiative, risking not only his life for Malfoy but his career.
