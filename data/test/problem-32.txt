The elf guiltily took a bound stack of letters from his pillowcase-tunic. “Mr Potter mustn’t be angry with Dobby – Dobby hoped if Mr Potter had thought his friends had forgotten him, Mr Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.”
Blaise looked at her, for once allowing his scorn to coat his features. “Granger, no offence, but Dumbledore didn’t stop the Dark Lord last time. Baby Potter over there did. There are a lot of people who believe Dumbledore is – shall we say, past his prime.”
“Harry Potter?” she asked, although she knew very well that no other boy in the world had that particularly distinctive scar.
“Ginny Weasley,” McGonagall replied, and dismissed the gathered staff with a solemn wave of her hand.
Daphne exchanged a glance with Blaise. “I suppose Draco was your knight in shining armour then, right Harry?”
Harry looked up, triumph flowing hot in his veins, but the sight of Draco’s face froze it cold. Draco was shocked – or, it seemed, scared. A quick glance at the silent crowd and stone-faced Snape told Harry his friend’s response was not an unusual one.
“We have chess tournaments every time Mother throws one of her parties,” Draco explained half an hour later as they exited the room. Harry couldn’t quite clear his mind’s eye of the image of the black side, left decimated behind them. “It’s led to quite the skill, don’t you think?”
Draco glared at her viciously. “You don’t know anything about my parents,” he growled, before promptly storming out of the library without another word.
Draco nodded, pureblood mask firmly in place, though he seemed grateful to accept the tight hug and kiss on the forehead from his mother nonetheless.
Harry finally felt himself relax. As much as he liked his new friends, he had spent the vast majority of his life being generally ignored by everyone around him. But now he was
Harry shrugged. “I’ve been worse. Where are Draco and Blaise, by the way? And Neville and Theodore?” He peered through his circle of friends, but couldn’t find the four.
“But he doesn’t understand,” Quirrell was continuing. “I’m never alone. Never.” He seemed to shake himself off then, focussing on the Mirror and not whatever debate was happening in his mind. “Now… What does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?”
Dumbledore settled into the visiting chair Ginny had vacated earlier, the charmed mobile toads on his characteristically garish orange robes leaping grumpily around his knees. “Your adventure in the Chamber was but a week ago.”
“So who do you think is going to win, Harry? I’d put my money on both losing, if it were an option. Puffs vs Gryffindorks? It’s the start of a bad joke,” he snorted, before quickly glancing at Neville. “Ahem, no offence of course Longbottom.”
“Well,” Hermione huffed. “There’s one easy way to find out. Hold the book open, Harry.” She pulled out her wand, and tapped the open diary three times. “
Pansy was throwing small pebbles at a sullen looking Lockhart, wand lazily aimed at his chest, when the rest of the group reached the bottom.
“Draco,” Harry tried to meet his eyes, but he had them clenched shut. “Draco, you need to calm down.”
So young Harry rarely cried, though perhaps he should have. On his twelfth birthday, however, Harry thought he might have been excused for wanting to cry, because of all the lonely birthdays he had ever had, this one was by far the loneliest.
“My parents are dentists, they would cry if they saw me making a cake!” Hermione explained with a huff.
“I heard about Hermione – how’s she doing?” Hagrid asked them, pulling a box of rock cakes off a shelf twice Harry’s height.
was strange, and odd, and Harry knew better than perhaps anyone just how much the Dursleys hated anything that was
Harry shrugged, and waited for Draco to go grab the dog. As soon as he returned, he linked their fingers again. He couldn’t quite explain why, but the feeling was – nice. Safe.
Harry didn’t bother pointing out that Draco had admonished him for having that attitude last night. He didn’t need Draco mad at him in the middle of their investigation. He did, however, share a
Or perhaps… Harry let his gaze move to the diary and remembered what Tom had said. Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed Tom. But the twins had already tried countless spells against it, what was left that could damage it?
,” Harry growled. He felt as though the whole room were shaking, he was so furious. “I’m not here to be told what to do – by
Hermione was running towards them, Neville only a step behind while Hagrid and Fang approached more slowly.
was sorted into Slytherin after very little time beneath the Sorting Hat. The tiny girl seemed even tinier walking the length of the Great Hall to the Slytherin table, and even Harry felt a little reassured once Astoria was safely at her sister’s side. Daphne herself calmed immediately.
Harry made a beeline for his target. The key was slower, given one of its wings was twisted and broken, but other keys zipped in front of his vision every second, distractions and obstacles in one. Harry took a breath, flipped his broom upside down and snatched at the damaged key. That seemed to be the signal for the rest, as the moment his fingers touched the metal the rest of the keys turned to attack.
“Shut up, Daphne,” said Draco with a haughty sniff. “Now: Hagrid. That’s a load of nonsense, isn’t it?”
Hadrian James Potter did not often cry – at least, not anymore. Crying was weakness, he had learned, through cruel mockery and frequent beatings. This was a truth. Crying was pointless, and pathetic, and got you nothing but more pain.
“Um, you two do remember that this is the same man you saw kept an Acromantula fifty years ago?” Pansy raised a brow.
Tom didn’t blur at all when he moved, now. Harry chanced a look at Ginny. Her skin was corpse-white, as white as Hermione’s and Theo’s had been. The memory of his friends waiting, petrified above, rekindled a slow burning anger in Harry’s gut. He turned back to Tom and pushed his fear down.
book that described the thickness of a troll’s skin that made it impervious to minor spells, he had no clue what to do and Hermione was screaming again and-
“’Oh’, indeed,” Professor McGonagall answered with perhaps the barest hint of a smile. “May I come in?”
“Heart of a lion, this one,” Ron rolled his eyes. The comment startled a laugh out of Harry – which seemed to shock Ron even more than it did himself.
“He didn’t say anything about this. He mustn’t have even told mother, she would have told me, she would have said something- I didn’t know he was going to take Dumbledore away, Harry, you must believe me-”
Harry wanted to tell her to shut up, but he simply closed his eyes for a moment and shoved his bad memories away. When he opened them again, Blaise was watching him.
Gloomily, Harry thought back to the crushing events after the trial the day before. Dumbledore had apparated them to Little Whinging, upsetting Harry’s stomach even more after the emotional shock.
It did not take him very long to make the connection, and once Harry had run inside and back out again with his letter clutched between his fingers, he was fairly certain of what he needed to do. Thus, he was very pleased with himself when a tawny brown owl snatched the letter from his fingers and flew off in as purposeful a manner as an owl could manage. Harry watched it fly away with a beam on his face, and then went happily back inside.
“Your life is worth more than some information, Harry,” Blaise said, finally. “Draco knows that. I know that. All of us know that. Draco’s upset, Harry, because
“Having friends,” Harry said, closing his eyes and remembering the warmth of Gemma’s hug, of Blaise’s fond annoyance and Hermione’s anxious parting look. He thought of Pansy and Daphne’s dramatics, and the pressure of Draco’s hand in his. “I haven’t really had friends before.”
Harry didn’t answer, because the door was suddenly opening to reveal the pinched, wide-eyed face of Petunia Dursley.
,” Hermione Granger was saying to the highly uninterested and slightly sick looking girl on her left.
“I- thank you,” Longbottom replied eventually, clearing his throat several times in a row. “And- and you can call me Neville – if you want.”
“So we’re all friends again, then?” Daphne asked, raising one eyebrow once the group was settled into the library.
Harry’s eyes prickled, and for once he didn’t want to hold the tears back. He felt young, and scared, and safe with his friends.
“How did you get into Slytherin?” Draco asked, incredulously, when Harry was finished catching his friends up on the events inside the book at breakfast the next morning, at an emergency meeting at the library.
“Purebloods are the most powerful witches and wizards because there are no Muggles tainting their line,” Daphne said, flicking her hair. “Everyone knows that. That’s why it matters.”
“A stranger, down the pub,” the groundskeeper said casually. “Seemed glad t’ be rid o’ ‘im, if I’m honest.”
I'm back! We should be coming back into regular update time now (that's three to five days) because all my exams are done, and I'm on holiday! Thank you all for your kind wishes and comments :) Please enjoy!
Harry felt quite overwhelmed. Now that he was fully awake, the bone-deep ache permeating his entire body was moving to the forefront of his mind, and he found himself entirely unwilling to confront the idea of his already frustrating stardom at Hogwarts getting even more profound.
“Theo and I have searched everywhere,” Tracey explained as she, Harry, and Hermione left the library after a quiet study session. “But none of your lineage seems to point back to Slytherin. The closest we found was in
Harry shook it silently, and gave a small smile. After all, Malfoy, Draco Malfoy didn’t seem very nice, but Harry didn’t want to make enemies on his first day.
“Please, call me Narcissa.” She waved one, perfectly-manicured hand to call over a staff member. “Shall we sit down somewhere more private?”
Beyond the door was another long pathway, but this was clearly an entrance room. The ceilings opened up high above their heads, miles of polished emerald stone reaching into the castle above. Titan snakes made from the same stone reared on either side of the pathway, jaws open, perpetually ready to strike. The whole area felt damp and confining and cold. The trio passed the last of the snakes lining their way into the hall, revealing the massive likeness of Salazar Slytherin himself far ahead, rising from a lake, and on the water’s edge-
Feeling Draco’s warmth against him, the knowledge of forgiveness and friendship secure in his chest, Harry closed his eyes, and breathed.
been a dream. All the rest of his school supplies had been stuffed into Harry’s old cupboard and locked away.
Fang whined at their feet. Draco’s grip on Harry’s hand tightened – but under the shadows of the trees, Harry couldn’t bring himself to mind.
Harry kept his eyes fixed firmly on the table, on the lines and scratches on the dark wood from many years of use.
“Why don’t you introduce him to the other firsties, Malfoy?” Gemma was saying. “I’m sure you’ve been introduced to a fair few of them. See you around, Potter.”
He didn’t have enough time to panic at the small area and the feeling of rising movement beneath his feet before the gargoyle spread its wings once again, revealing a large, circular room.
“Hello, Mr Hagrid,” Harry replied, hiding his intimidation behind a polite tone and a confident smile. “This is Hermione Granger and Neville Longbottom. Have we met?”
The zoo in Little Whinging was everything Harry had hoped it would be. There were tigers, and zebras, and other creatures Harry had only seen in the few books he had found and read around the Dursleys’ house. The last place they visited was the reptile area, because Piers had been bragging about having seen a snake once and Dudley had whined that he wanted to see one, too.
“Guys! Play nice,” Tracey glared at them both, before turning a gentle smile on Harry. “How’re you doing, Hadrian? Draco and Blaise told us what happened.”
Draco nodded shortly. “Oh. Well, good. And if you break them, you know Blaise will help me hide your body. He wanted to make a written contract, you know, you’re lucky I’m settling for verbal agreement.” He eyed Harry suspiciously. “For now.”
“No,” Harry said. “But I’m certain it has something to do with whatever Fluffy – er, the Cerberus – is guarding.”
Harry drifted into consciousness slowly. The more sleep slipped from his mind, the more apparent it became that Harry’s bed was oddly uncomfortable. And he was cold – the Manor was never cold.
like Fiendfyre in his veins. The beast released him with a meaty thud, leaving Harry’s arm to drop back to his side, useless and shaking with pain, one fang left imbedded into the bone.
Now we're getting somewhere! Sorry for these sporadic updates, by the way - school is exhausting and life is messy, but I have not lost my passion for this story! I plan to keep updating whenever I can :)
Snape cocked his head like a snake ready to strike. “Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?”
“A fairytale,” Harry said quickly. “We found a fairytale about a Cerberus in the library the other day. Honestly, they seem like fascinating creatures.” He smiled, innocent as could be.
“I live with my uncle and cousin,” Harry said. "They aren't kind people." His voice sounded foreign to his own ears, strange and unfamiliar. He didn’t say anything else. He didn’t need to.
He hadn’t spoken the Snake-Tongue since the zoo incident with Dudley and the python, but the words sprung forth from his lips without hesitation.
“Heya, Hadrian!” the Weasley twins had called in unison as they passed the alley. “That Lockhart’s a bit of an ass, yeah?”
, however, he was hit with two identical jets of light, red and shining and accompanied by twin voices shouting:
“Well,” Daphne flicked her hair over her shoulder and tugged the still silent Astoria a little closer to her side. “Come on, then.”
“Who cares,” Draco huffed irritably. “Let’s just get back to the Common Room. I refuse to go to lunch in tattered robes.”
Thankfully, Madam Pomfrey, no doubt alerted by a charm that Harry had awoken from his slumber (or maybe the word was ‘coma’ – who knew how long he’d been out) bustled into the room as a convenient distraction.
“Oh be quiet, both of you,” Tracey rolled her eyes. “Honestly. Weren’t we talking about what Hadrian should do?”
think of a small, dark cupboard under a staircase. Neither did he think of heavy fists on that thin door, or cruel insults cutting at his self-esteem.
Harry had already intended to, but the words made him blush even harder. Compliments were uncommon for him, after all, and though he didn’t want to, Harry cared a lot about attaining his friends’ approval.
“What a creepy thing to say,” Millicent said bluntly when Harry recounted his visit to Dumbledore’s office to his friends that night in a back corner of the library.
Harry gasped. Unmistakeably, Dumbledore’s eyes trailed the wall of Hagrid’s cottage, stopping only when they fixed with his own.
Aunt Petunia, as Harry had predicted, was frying eggs when Harry found her. She startled at the sight of him, like he was an apparition rather than her nephew, and her lips screwed up in that way they did when she saw something distasteful.
“What the Hell are you doing?” the Slytherin hissed angrily, storming towards where Draco Malfoy was standing away from the hut awkwardly.
Harry swallowed. Pulling the ‘I’m on good terms with the Minister of Magic’ card – Harry could already tell this wasn’t going to any well.
The parcel turned out to be three letters and a miniature trunk. The trunk Harry recognised as his own, much to his relief – a brand new model, recently gifted by Narcissa for his 13
There was a pause, and then a shining bright light burst through the vines, pushing the Devil’s Snare back and back and back until the four dropped through, landing on hard ground below with a
“Who is Tom Riddle?” He asked the girls, but it appeared they weren’t listening – they had stopped in the corridor, unknowingly mirroring each other’s pose (hands on hips), still arguing.
Hagrid gave him a dirty look that made Harry narrow his eyes. “Fine,” he said. “But just so ye know – ‘e’s a bloody coward.”
“We did, sort of,” Harry glanced at Draco. “Hagrid definitely didn’t open the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago, so Fudge has arrested the wrong man. And it’s not an Acromantula committing these attacks, now or back then – it’s something the Acromantulas are scared of.”
Harry smiled his own gratitude, and even Blaise gave a nod of acknowledgement, but Draco simply turned his head away.
“We could go see Lockhart?” suggested Pansy. “Get him to come with us. He’s a teacher, but he’s also stupid enough to come. McGonagall said he knows where it is and he’s going down there anyway, right?”
“He was bothering Harry, Granger,” Draco sneered. “After today, some little creep isn’t what Harry needs.”
This paid off, as towards the back of the row of enclosures he found what he had not known he was looking for. The information panel read
Harry was dimly aware of a hand on his side pulling him backwards, of a voice in his ear begging him to move, to
“Hagrid’s invited me to his house after dinner tonight,” Harry told his friends with a frown that lunchtime, peering at the note in his hand. The handwriting was nearly incomprehensible, but Harry’s wasn’t exactly a breeze to read either, so he didn’t think he could judge. “Neville and Hermione, too.”
Gemma didn’t look pleased at being interrupted, but seemed to take being absolved of rule-breaking as the more important action. She nodded again.
Harry felt it. As soon as he had entered Room 21b and locked the door securely behind him, he collapsed onto the bed, and went straight to sleep.
Vernon scoffed. “And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? Absolutely not.”
“Professor Kettleburn? He teaches Care of Magical Creatures, and a Cerberus is definitely a magical creature. Maybe he’s taking care of it,” Draco suggested.
“I am in charge of Slytherin students, Poppy,” Snape glared at her. “I will choose how to discipline them.”
“The Dark Lord survived a rebounded Killing Curse, you really think being crumbled to ash is what killed him for good?” Daphne Greengrass, perfect pureblood heiress, twitched her fingers as she spoke, looking to protect a sister who was already safe and sound in her bed.
The shame was in Harry’s chest, now, rising to tighten around his throat and press heatedly behind his eyes. They prickled wetly, and Harry bowed his head more.
The twins made no reply – something Harry would have found odd, if he had not remembered with a sudden return to urgency that it was their sister currently stuck in the Chamber. He thought, briefly, of Daphne, likely curled up in the Slytherin Common Room with Astoria tucked tight into her side, and wondered at how it must be to have a family.
The first spell knocked the box onto its side, and Hagrid cried out in anguish as a tangle of pitch-black legs and glistening pincers scuttled out at high speed. Tom tracked the creature with his wand but before he could cast a final curse Hagrid had catapulted into him headfirst and the world was spinning and Harry was falling, falling, he was-
Lockhart stepped up to the edge of the pit apprehensively, prodded forward by the twins’ wands, and peered down into the dark. “Err…”
“He always seems so nice, though,” Abbot protested weakly. “And, after all, he is the one who made You-Know-Who disappear.”
Harry gasped in choked breaths and grabbed his wand with his other hand as the basilisk prepared to give the killing bite.
, and so with this logic Harry had learned to equate normal days with good days, and good days in turn were equated with minimal pain for Harry.
“Caught in the act,” Filch hissed as he shuffled towards Justin and the ghost. “I’ll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words…”
Dobby nodded enthusiastically. “Of course, Mr Potter! Oh, Dobby is so pleased Mr Potter listened to Dobby, sir. Mr Potter will be safe, now!”
Aside from the letter from Draco, the other two were penned with a different hand. Even without deductive reasoning, the style of lettering was too stunningly perfect to be by anyone other than Narcissa Malfoy. One was addressed to him, and the other, to Harry’s utter shock, bore the name Petunia Dursley. Harry couldn’t imagine what Narcissa would care to say to Petunia, given the plain disdain he knew she held for his aunt. Likewise, he couldn’t imagine what would possess Aunt Petunia to read such a letter – although on second thoughts, Narcissa
“Honestly, what is wrong with you?” Draco whispered angrily from behind him. “Oh, Blaise, not you too? If someone says a room is dangerous, you avoid that room! How did you two even
“So?” Draco scowled. “He deserves to be fired, if he’s going to be sending us, defenceless, into a dangerous area. Come
“Of course.” Gemma dropped her hand from Harry’s shoulder but gave him a small smile. “Stay safe, kid.”
The Great Hall of Hogwarts was an intimidating area, not least because of the four tables filled with older students staring at them - not to mention the professors. Harry was rather distracted, however, so focussed was he on studying the charmed ceiling he had read so much about in-
“He’s in trouble,” Harry explained, trying to calm his racing heartbeat. “Up at school, there have been attacks. They think Hagrid has opened the Chamber of Secrets, like last time.”
Harry didn’t think you could be best friends with someone you’d only really known for a day, but he didn’t say anything. He was good at that, anyway – silence. His tactic of letting Draco do all the talking didn’t satisfy the other students for long, however.
“Just give us a place to meet and I’ll bring them. Ten minutes,” he looked at Harry, a tentative truce forming in a single quiet look. “Okay?”
idiots.” He gestured at Vince and Greg, who were napping in their chairs, mouths open and leaking drool.
They turned in unison, making their way to their respective positions. Harry flexed his fingers around his wand, tense with excitement. He had witnessed first-hand Draco’s spell casting prowess in Charms and Defence, not to mention his speed on the Quidditch pitch – but Harry wasn’t bad in those categories himself. He got the feeling it would be a close match.
“I warned you,” Vernon Dursley growled, glowering at Harry and struggling with Dudley’s bowtie. “If you can’t control that bloody bird, it’ll have to go.”
“Oh – I didn’t really want to go home to my relatives,” Harry told him, rather awkwardly. “I thought I should experience Christmas at Hogwarts, is all.”
“What do you think, Hadrian?” a sweet voice said, cutting into Harry’s train of thought. Daphne met his eyes and gave a honeyed smile. “You are the local celebrity, after all.”
“So,” Harry said, jumping lightly off his broom and pushing his glasses further up his nose. “What’s next?”
Harry wondered, and decided, with the simplistic determination of a ten-year-old, that he would find out.
– the girl who had been trailing after the twins in Diagon Alley – was very decisively placed in Gryffindor. Fred and George seemed to have used some sort of charm on their voices, as when they cheered for her, it was so loud that even the Slytherins on the other end of the Hall winced and covered their ears. The twins gave Harry a wink when he caught their eye, and pointed towards Lockhart. The new Defence teacher’s face had gone an alarming shade of purple – their shrieking had affected him especially. Harry grinned at the sight. He got the feeling it was going to be a very good year.
“No idea,” said Myrtle, sighing despondently and floating back towards them. “I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes, right over there.” She pointed towards the great structure of sinks in the centre of the room.
“Which should be any moment,” Vernon reminded them all. “Now, let’s run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be-”
Hermione wasn’t paying attention. “What’s that about?” She asked curiously, watching Draco talking animatedly with Flint.
“I’ll have to talk to Mother,” he said, sounding, suddenly, very young. “But that could do it – if Father was found to have deliberately given Weasley a dark artefact. With Father’s lawyers he wouldn’t be gone long – but it might be enough to have him in- in Azkaban, for a few years. And Mother would be on her side, he doesn’t- they don’t- they’re not close, anymore.”
“What the Hell are you doing here?” hissed Pansy, as soon as the hall was clear of teachers and the Slytherins could sneak across to where Ron Weasley appeared close to passing out.
“Harry,” someone that sounded funnily like Draco said, but that couldn’t be right, because Draco was stuck back at the entrance to the Chamber.
Once Harry was certain that his knees would not buckle, he stood, and took up the letter addressed to Aunt Petunia. He was almost unbearably curious to read it. It was warded, probably, with similar privacy charms to the ones Narcissa said she had placed on the other letters. But the temptation to check…
Harry glanced in the direction of the flippant hand wave to see two large, gormless looking boys staring out the window into the Black Lake – though as far as Harry could tell, there was currently nothing to see.
The Sorting Hat caught his attention again, and Harry stepped over to it as quietly as he could, silently cursing the fact that he had left the enchanted boots Blaise had got him for Christmas a year earlier in his dormitory that day. Glancing around to check he was still alone, Harry lifted the Hat, and placed it upon his head.
“Might come in handy, anyway,” said Millicent, before things could get too awkward. “Having the Weasley twins on your side, that is. Didn’t you hear what they said about Lockhart? They’re going to kick his ass this year, because he was a creep to you.”
Harry pieced together what he had learned so far as they walked. Tom Riddle was showing him a memory from his past, from the last time the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, and in that time, someone had died. A student, probably, though a teacher was possible. That was awful, of course, and a terrifying wake-up call for the danger of Harry’s own situation (as so far, students were being Petrified, not killed) but information wise, it didn’t help him. He still didn’t know who had opened the Chamber of Secrets, or what exactly the ‘monster’ within the Chamber was, or
Harry reminded himself with an internal groan. From the Potions lesson, he could guess at how his detention would go, and he could already feel his already present exhaustion intensifying.
There was the sound of something knocking over as his elbow hit it, following by the splat of liquid. Harry cursed, scrambling to put his glasses back on, but he already knew what had happened. The ink spilled out of its pot slowly after the first cascade, the diary’s crisp pages now black.
Harry woke with a gasp. The world was black. He struggled to get up, but the silence and the dark was pushing him down, choking his throat and suffocating him. Why couldn’t he see anything? Was he standing? Where was he? His hand touched something cold and wet and he snatched it back with a yelp. There was a loud curse from somewhere in the house, and then heavy footsteps on the landing.
“Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort was destroyed?”
Draco grimaced, but it was Daphne Greengrass who responded, with a flip of her hair and a condescending tone.
Draco sneered at him in response. “Malfoy; Draco Malfoy. I don’t even need to ask for your surname. Red hair, and a hand-me-down robe? You must be a
“Ugh, gross!” Draco yelped and tripped over a mossy root on the forest floor, hands coming up frantically to wipe at his face. “Oh, that is disgusting!”
Dumbledore stood. “If that is all, my boy, I will retrieve your friends for you. No doubt they will wish to hear the whole story from you, and I daresay you will come to quite despise telling it in the coming days.”
Blaise ran a hand over his shaved hair. “We protect him, when we can. And we teach him to protect himself.”
Honestly, Harry couldn’t blame her. The Mandrake looked like some sort of monstrous, shrieking baby, deformed and covered in mud. They weren’t graced with the sight of it for long, though, because as soon as Sprout had heaved it free from one pot she dumped it in another, and covered it in dirt.
“We are?” echoed the Slytherins – Draco and Blaise in disbelief, and Pansy sounding, frighteningly enough, eager.
Gemma led Harry and the Malfoys a small way away from the courtroom, down one of the narrower hallways on the tenth floor.
And was promptly interrupted by a banging knock on the door. The rock cake he was holding dropped to the floor, but Draco was already tugging Harry into a corner and throwing the cloak back over them. Hagrid checked they were completely covered before picking up his crossbow with a swallow and aiming it at the door.
“That’s a door,” finished George. He pointed at a thin line marking a circle around eight heavily detailed snakes.
Harry nodded, and coughed slightly. “Cool. Truce.” He reached out to grasp Ron’s hand, realising too late that the hand he needed to shake Ron’s was currently being held by Draco, so he and Ron ended up just lamely tapping their right hands together.
made quite the impression upon their meeting the year before. Even without the deep respect Harry held for the Lady Malfoy, he had no intention of ever crossing her and considered anyone who dared do so to be incredibly stupid. Petunia, if she had any sense at all (which Harry thought she must, given her and Uncle Vernon’s change in attitude since Narcissa’s visit) would have realised that.
Oh, and I have no idea in what year 'alohomora' is taught at Hogwarts. Stuff like that is made up as I go along.
The young Malfoy heir took a steadying breath and peered at his reflection once more. The mirror, enchanted and twice the size at least of the fateful Mirror of Erised from Harry’s first year, helpfully told Draco that the dark green of his formal robes was deeply flattering. Draco gave no reaction. Harry, not for the first time in his weeks at Draco’s ancestral home, wondered if the mirror had a ‘mute’ function.
Draco continued talking for most of the train ride, with the exception of a few questions that Harry had the time to answer and an interruption by a girl with bushy brown hair and buck teeth asking about a toad. Harry found that Draco wasn’t all that bad, when he wasn’t being so stuck-up, and had the sudden realisation that he had just found his first friend.
But his vision was already darkening, and the last thing Harry saw was Draco’s pale, worried face before the whole world went black.
“Too right you will,” Vernon glared at him. “With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career.”
The barkeep raised an eyebrow sceptically. “You’re telling me you have money? No offence, shortie, but you look like a runaway to me.”
Harry was listening to Draco talk rather animatedly about all he had heard about the Sorting Ceremony when they were interrupted by a boy who looked rather like the twins Harry had met earlier. He soon found out why.
Their detention wasn’t that bad – but it wasn’t a walk in the park, either. Rather, a walk in the forest. The Forbidden, Dark Forest. Within which, Draco informed Harry in a terrified whisper, lay all sorts of creatures – werewolves, vampires, ghouls, and the like.
Draco’s face softened. “I loved it, Harry.” His hand reached up almost subconsciously to touch Harry’s gift: a silver pendant charmed to grow warm when the wearer was in danger. On it was engraved the word,
The girl looked between them, before leaning towards Harry. “I heard you were raised by non-magical people- er, Muggles. Is that true?”
The world snapped back to awareness at the sound of his name. Harry blinked, and found Blaise Zabini looking at him with something he didn’t recognise.
Myrtle rolled over in the window sill, smiling down at him. Her large round glasses defied gravity as easily as she did. “Okay! Come back soon, will you? You’re awfully nice, you know.”
Harry waited for his parents and friends to appear, but instead- his Mirror-self gave a slow, deliberate smile, and reached carefully into his pocket. When he removed it – without Harry’s real self moving in any way – within the Mirror-self’s palm lay a small, blood-red stone. The Mirror-self winked, and carefully place the Philosopher’s Stone back into his pocket.
Unfortunately, the reprieve was a brief one. By the time Harry and the other students of Slytherin House had been led down into the dungeons, introduced to the lavishly decorated Slytherin Common Room, and given a speech on Slytherin House rules by a fierce sixth year prefect named Gemma Farley (keep all squabbles inside the dungeons; don’t take the blame for anything; and don’t ever,
Theodore Nott was a boy of few words, for many reasons. One of these reasons was that he could infuse so much meaning into one arched eyebrow that he needed no supplementary speech. The slight twitch of one brow in Blaise’s direction asked the question for him.
Harry wondered at the implications behind that farewell. He was sure Blaise was hiding another meaning beneath his words, but he couldn’t quite decode the message.
Though little could be said for the taste of Pepper-Up potion, Harry could write a thousand essays praising its effectiveness. He arrived at breakfast later that morning feeling worlds better, though the tenseness in his chest anticipating his detention – and the double Potions period he had before it – with Professor Snape had not dissipated. Thinking of the detention reminded Harry, irritatingly, of the plans he would have to cancel.
That was Daphne, and suddenly she was in front of him, her green eyes close and her tone firm. “You did nothing wrong. Now breathe, and let us help you.”
Harry swallowed. It still felt odd to hear such a thing, though the warmth that blossomed in his chest every time was growing more familiar. “But nothing happened – I’m fine.”
It wasn’t until that night that Harry managed to corner the Malfoy heir in their shared dormitory, giving a glare to Vince and Greg, lurking on Vince’s bed with a new collection of sweets, to make them leave. Harry flicked his wand at the door, locking it behind the two boys with an advanced charm Hermione had taught him.
” Hermione asked. She appeared to be getting a little fed up with not knowing what Tracey was talking about. Harry didn’t blame her – he didn’t like not knowing things either.
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings,” Professor Sprout continued, “Their cries won’t kill you yet. However, they
Tom pushed the door lightly with the tip of his wand, and it swung wide. A large man – no, a boy – knelt within in front of a curious box. The boy looked up at the sound. Harry wanted to be sick.
century. Quite aside from the fact that the list itself represented intense bigotry (as Hermione had passionately explained to Neville, who had appeared slightly scared but supportive), it was refuted by many scholars for the apparent lack of reasoning behind which twenty eight families were chosen. The Ollivanders, Harry recalled, were included despite having a muggleborn in their line, while the Potters, who were by all counts ‘pure’ (though pro-muggleborn rights) were not.
was Sirius Black? And why was it always him evil wizards were after? First Voldemort, now an escaped convict – Blaise was going to be
“You took your time, Cissa,” Adrienna Zabini greeted. Her Italian accent lay thick over her words, and her teeth glinted white behind dark lips drawn into a smile.
Obviously, part of Draco's speech and the Hat's came directly from the film. Please don't sue me. I have no money.
“I think it’s a plant. Um, one of you will need to come down with your wand out though. I’m, uh, sitting on mine. But with light I’ll know what it is!”
Harry stared at his cousin in shock, but had little time to process before the snake was slinking out of the enclosure and bowing its head in Harry’s direction.
“Silence, Mr Malfoy, or you will be joining Mr Potter in detention,” Snape looked to Harry. There was something like triumph and loathing mixed together in his beady black eyes. “Anything to say, Mr Potter?”
Anyway, thank you for sticking with me and I hope you like the chapter. Next one will be less emotional. I think.
The next few weeks seemed to speed by in front of Harry’s eyes. In fact, time passed so quickly with classes, keeping a year or two ahead of the designated Potions work and having to split his attention equally between his Slytherin friends and Hermione that Harry never even found the time to continue his investigation. So, the Cerberus on Hogwarts’ third floor remained undisturbed, and Rubeus Hagrid blissfully unaware of the curiosity of a group of eleven year olds, for just a few weeks longer.
“Very well.” Narcissa stood, smoothing down the skirt of her elegant dress robe. She did not spare Petunia another glance. “Let’s go back to Draco, shall we?”
“You’re killing her,” Harry breathed. The twins were looking murderous, but Tom only had eyes for Harry.
“You scared the pants off everyone in the Common Room, Potter,” Gemma told him seriously, before smiling. “It was actually pretty funny.”
Harry looked up at her, startled, before he realised she wanted him to decide. He barely hesitated, before simply saying, “I trust Gemma.”
“Now,” she said. Her voice was cold. “You will take me to where Harry’s school supplies are. You will show me his living conditions, and explain to me exactly what you thought you were doing keeping a child the way you have. He will not be returning here. If Dumbledore asks where he is, tell him Harry is simply out, or say he is visiting my son again. And if you disobey any of these instructions, I will come back here and deal with you personally. Am I understood?”
“I’ll see you soon, Harry dear,” was all she said, but it comforted Harry more than words could say. Gently, Narcissa petted his cheek, and then stood.
“It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and the squib’s cat – and that unfortunate pureblood, of course. Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.”
Harry supposed he must have some survival instincts, no matter what the other Slytherins said, because he could very clearly hear them shouting at him to not go anywhere near that huge, dangerous paw.
Harry wasn’t very keen on listening to Myrtle moan about her life – as insensitive as that may be – and splashed towards the window. Lying in the water was the projectile that had hit Myrtle: a small, black book that looked remarkably familiar.
“Well, it’s Christmas holidays soon. It’s not like we can do much investigating while you guys are away.” He tried not to sound bitter, but judging from Hermione’s vaguely pitying look, he guessed he failed.
Harry jogged back to the library, flashing Madam Pince a sheepish grin when she scolded him for being out so late. He stopped in his tracks, however, when his bag came into sight.
into Slytherin. Then it was his turn, and he climbed the steps to take a seat and have the rather old-looking Hat placed on his head while the Hall erupted into murmurs around him.
“I knew Basilisks were big, but this thing must be twenty feet long at least,” said Pansy. She looked caught between intrigue and disgust.
Harry ignored them, as he always did. They couldn’t employ their usual pastime of Harry Hunting while they were out at the zoo, and were therefore not worth his time. Harry thought very little of Dudley and his friends, particularly of their intelligence, and was most likely correct in his judgements. Besides, he was excited, and he wouldn’t let their dumb bullying dampen that.
He wasn’t used to people caring about him. Draco pushed him into believing it frequently with his outward displays of affection, and the memory of waking up in the hospital wing at the end of his first year of Hogwarts, surrounded by his friends still conjured soft warmth in his chest. Despite this, however, people caring for him just didn’t feel
Harry resisted the urge to cringe and wipe his hand on his trousers when he pulled away. Why were Longbottom’s hands so sweaty? It was gross.
“I… I remember having a disagreement with Draco and the others,” Harry said, working through his memory. “I wasn’t very pleased. And then…” he scowled in annoyance. “Nothing.”
“Not controlling – you’ll find that I can be very persuasive, Harry. She had no idea what she was doing, of course; she was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Yet the power of the diary began to scare her, and she tried to dispose of it in the girls’ bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you, Hadrian Potter. The very person I was most anxious to meet.”
Dumbledore took pity. “Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes become fire when it is time for them to die, and then-”
“Yes, Professor,” Tom was saying. “I suppose I- I just had to see for myself if… if the rumours were true.” He glanced back down the hall, but the stretcher had moved on.
Theo looked at him. His eyes gave away nothing, but he nodded, and that combined with Hermione’s new (if probably temporary) carefree attitude was enough for Harry. He nodded back, and returned to his lunch.
This time, Harry could feel the tingling from earlier, and with a sudden rush in his chest akin to the feeling of exhaling a large amount of air all at once, there was an unlit candle lying in front of him.
Harry went to apologise on Daphne’s behalf, but Blaise, Draco, and Theo were already picking their way across the ruined classroom towards them.
“Well, what’s so interesting about it then?” Pansy frowned. “Someone pranked Moaning Myrtle, so what?”
Halfway back to the Slytherin Common Room he heard voices from a nearby classroom. He would have passed right by, had he not heard his name.
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was not, Harry discovered, a view that diminished with time. A year later and the formidable sight still took his breath away – the castle rising from the mist of the Black Lake; the Astronomy Tower standing guard, tall and imposing; even the greenhouses, which usually seemed so benevolent, appeared menacing as they materialised out of the dark.
Harry blinked away his discomfort at the clear display of emotion, and put on his sweetest smile. “We were wondering if we could just have a chat, if that’s alright Mr Hagrid. Since you knew my parents, and Neville’s.”
Harry was stuck on the news that the Weasley twins had been secretly pranking Lockhart all year – sure, they’d said they would, but what reason would they have to follow through, unless the blond git had bothered them in some way – but his mind abruptly switched gears at Blaise’s announcement.
Harry didn’t say anything. Despite Narcissa’s kind words he could not dislodge the heavy weight at the base of his throat, or the voice in the back of his head that called him
“She’s all over the rumour mill, everyone knows about her. Though perhaps,” she paused, her sharp green eyes turning to ice and the corners of her lips upturning, “I should meet her myself. Come on, Pansy, I want to know everything about her by morning.”
Harry felt as though he couldn’t breathe as he read the letter once, twice, thrice, and many more times over, trying in vain to comprehend the words addressed to him.
He told only Draco, Blaise, Neville, and Hermione about the Mirror of Erised – and he didn’t tell them what he saw within it. It felt private, somehow. It was the first time he’d seen his parents since their deaths when he was one, and Harry thought this was something far too special to even say out loud. He
Harry relaxed into bed not long after, drawing the surrounding curtains with his spare hand. He heard Draco settling in the bed beside him, followed by soft breathing and then:
Flitwick stopped the two students outside the Hospital Wing, sighing once again. “I must warn you boys… this may be a shock.”
“Hadrian Potter,” the Dark Lord hissed, stretching out from Quirrell’s skull. Harry tried not to retch. “We meet again.”
“Thank you, sir,” Daphne interrupted with a sickly sweet smile, and before Harry knew it, all of his Slytherin friends – even Theo – were standing between him and Lockhart with various smug looks. “But we can take it from here.”
Lockhart paused, a glint coming into his eye. “Yes, as a matter of fact, now that you mention it.” His smile was sickeningly smug and dripping with false charm. “I’m rather gifted with memory charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing and I’d never have sold another book – quite the same idea as you’ve had, Miss Parkinson. So I’m afraid, I’ll have to do the same to you four, lest you think it smart to follow through with your threats…”
Harry thought of Hermione’s love of explaining and teaching, regardless of the student, and nearly smiled. “I have someone in mind. She’ll come to you. Now, do we have a deal?”
The final chapter of Alternate Beginnings! I'll be starting the Chamber of Secrets rewrite soon, so stay tuned. Thank you all for sticking with me!
marks of a Dark Wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent wizard who could talk to snakes? You know they called Slytherin himself Serpent-Tongue. And remember what was written on the wall:
Harry didn’t want to promise him anything before knowing what it was, but Hagrid was already continuing.
Narcissa and Draco were waiting a few steps away, pureblood masks firmly in place, and Harry made sure to fix his own in place before he joined them. Around them, wizards and witches were staring openly – there was no keeping the trial of such a public figure as Lucius Malfoy out of the papers. Everyone knew, and everyone was watching. The two Malfoys did not react, nor did they grace any of their spectators with a glance. Harry walked alongside them, an unbreakable line of pride and sophistication, into the elevators and to Level Ten – the Courtrooms.
“Well, the first Potter we could find was Linfred of Stinchcombe – his nickname was ‘the Potterer’, that’s where your surname comes from – and it seems that his son married a Peverell.”
It was Astoria who pulled him out of his daze. Her tiny fingers brushed his wrist as she passed him to reach Hermione’s hand on her bed where it was clenched tight into a fist. Astoria moved her fingers to touch her skin gently, and turned Hermione's wrist with a curious tilt to her head.
Tracey shushed the two and wished the boys goodnight before accompanying them, Millicent following suit with Sabre hissing at thin air in her arms.
Harry blinked once, then twice. Then he began to grin, and before he knew it he had to hide his face in his thin pillow so his laughter would not wake the house.
“I’m not- well, I’m not quite sure how predictable it all is, really,” said Neville Longbottom, frightened and brave in equal measure. “I- I mean, just because, Harry really, really, doesn’t seem to like Professor Dumbledore, and my grandmother says that Dumbledore will be the one leading – you know, the er, Light.”
Harry was the last one in the Common Room that night. He should have been in bed hours ago (if Hermione knew he was still awake she’d give him the lecture of a lifetime) but for some reason he just couldn’t shake the feeling that the Tom Riddle’s diary was important. He turned the pages one by one. No matter how much he stared at them, however, they remained blank.
Harry inhaled. He exhaled, and the fog cleared, just a little. With every slow breath the world got a little sharper, until he could see again past the litany of insults in his head.
No one was smiling by the time they reached the second floor corridor. The four peered around the corner as Professor McGonagall stood before a wall dripping red, addressing the congregated staff.
Hermione began packing up her remaining books with a huff. “I hardly think hair and robes are the biggest problems right now.”
, what have you done to my sister?” He jammed the end of his wand into Tom’s chest – or tried to, because the wood moved right through, Tom’s being dissipating like mist.
Harry had started wincing about halfway through and found himself positively cowering by the end. “Draco, I’m sorry-”
Harry might have laughed as he extended a hand to help Draco up from the ground, cobwebs strewn throughout his perfect hair and sticking to the angles of his face, if he hadn’t seen what Draco had fallen into. A clearing had been revealed behind the broken spider webs, and within that, just barely visible when Harry squinted-
“Haven’t you checked the notice board?” Draco was still pulling at him excitedly. “Quidditch try-outs have been announced for this Friday!”
Ron was closest, so he moved to kneel at Lockhart’s side. Lockhart’s eyes snapped open in a flash, and in the general confusion of the fainted man abruptly sitting up, the professor managed to snatch Ron’s wand from him and aim it directly between the young Weasley’s eyes.
Neville gave a small smile, despite his anxiety at talking directly to any of the Slytherins that weren’t Harry. “The Bat-Bogey Hex.”
“Come on, you lo’,” Hagrid interrupted.                His eyes were suspiciously red. “Best get in t’ the Forest.”
“Sorry about that,” Gemma smiled at him, jumping off of her table. “I love our House, we’re the best of the school, no doubt – but some of us just don’t know when to back off.”
“Maybe he just got in the way. Or maybe you just got him for fun. I wouldn’t be surprised, it’s not like Slytherins would know anything about loyalty-”
Aragog shifted again with an angry hiss. “We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.”
Hermione was positively scandalised that they’d snuck out to fly around, but Harry eventually managed to steer her around to the important stuff.
“Deep breaths, Harry,” Draco said. He stepped close, and in the space where the fabric of their robes concealed their hands from view Harry felt Draco’s cold fingers brush his own.
Harry winced at the stutter in her voice, and pulled away from Draco to see her, but Gemma wasn’t having any of it.

Another short chapter, unfortunately, but I wanted to fit a lot into the next one, so. Hopefully you still enjoy this filler!
his ‘monster’ is a giant snake. And only you can hear it speak, Harry, because you’re the only Parseltongue.”
“Still – he might know something. Come on, guys,” she glanced between them, uncharacteristically serious. “Harry’s right. We need to do something,
” whispered Draco next to him, voice and body shaking, and suddenly Harry could see where his confusion had come from in his near-death daze.
Lucius’ trial would be held in Courtroom One, ostensibly for timetabling reasons, but in practicality because it was the largest of the Ministry’s courtrooms. The trial was to have quite the audience.
“He wouldn’t have to,” Pansy said. “The choice has been made for us. For all of us, save Longbottom and Granger, since before we were born. There’s no way out of where we’re going.”
Lying rigid and pale on the floor by the window was a familiar, frozen face. Justin Finch-Fletchley’s eyes were wide and unblinking, his mouth stuck open in awful surprise. Beyond him, hidden just around the corner, the Gryffindor house ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, spun slowly in the air. His eyes were closed, and his translucent chest was filled with thick, black smoke.
Harry was still numb when they settled in his dorm room, even the girls. Pansy holding his shoulder, uncharacteristically gently, was what finally broke into the fog in his head – the fog infecting his every thought with words he knew far too well, words like
Harry wasn’t really paying attention, watching Hermione carefully as he was, so he caught the exact moment when she couldn’t take it anymore. She released a quiet, choked sound, and promptly ran away.
Draco stiffened on Harry’s left, and moved just a little closer until their shoulders pressed together.
“Oh, Hadrian I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to open the Chamber, it’s just Tom – I mean, Riddle – was so kind- I don’t mean to say He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is kind, it’s just, he was very good at pretending, you see. Which isn’t an excuse, of course, and I feel so
At least he would have the memories of his time at the Manor to hold with him. Memories of Narcissa’s tender hugs, and Draco, sleepy and softer than Harry had ever seen him at Hogwarts, greeting him in the mornings.
Then the twins’ words caught up to him, and he did a (very tender) double take. “Wait a second, ‘Snake Slayer’?”
“Hagrid was a Light supporter, wasn’t he?” Hermione said suddenly. “In the last war. Whereas your parents…”
“AND you’d better give me all the details when you get back,” Pansy added, though even she sounded more nervous than excited as her worry caught up with Blaise and Draco’s.
A shadow on the unicorn’s side moved, revealing itself as a monstrous wraith dripping silver from its deformed mouth;
“Second one killed this term!” he said, in a poor explanation. “Reckon it’s either foxes or a Blood-Sucking Bugbear. Need Dumbledore’s permission to put a charm around the hen-coop. Now, you sure you’re alright, Harry? You don’t look too well.”
Harry blushed uncomfortably, but soon fought the flush away. It would do no good to be seen as weak on his first day. Besides, Professor McGonagall had already briefed him on his status in the wizarding world. Harry would just have to get used to it.
Harry turned to her, noticing with a frown the rather disgusted look Draco was shooting Hermione Granger, and filing it away for later.
Daphne nodded, though her eyes were closed. “We are meant to be successful. It is not our way to be loving. Or, it’s not meant to be.”
Maybe everything would be alright. Maybe Narcissa would take him there, the Dursleys would stay out of the way, and they could grab his things and then leave.
Harry was fully intending on ignoring the clear summons and rushing out of the store as fast as he could, but of course that would have been too good to be true. A reporter with a shiny
“A Muggleborn – a witch or wizard who’s born to Muggles,” Tracey told him. She looked uncomfortable with the topic. “Those born to one magical person and one muggle are half-bloods, and those with two magical parents are-”
Harry wanted to reply – at least to get that look out of Draco’s eyes, or to clear the heat from his own cheeks that must have been the result of the room getting too warm with so many inhabitants - but Daphne was already demanding the full story, so it would have to wait.
So Hermione and Harry’s study group spread to Hermione and Harry and Tracey (much to Daphne’s thinly veiled disgust), and sometimes even Neville Longbottom, when his Potions tutoring with Hermione aligned with the study group’s meetings. The added exposure to Longbottom wasn’t really increasing Harry’s opinion of him, but it wasn’t decreasing it either. The Gryffindor still came across as irritatingly weak and cowardly, but he wasn’t as incompetent as Harry had initially thought. On the occasions when the group was studying Herbology, for example, Longbottom seemed to suddenly come alive. He would chatter excitedly about different plants and their uses until somebody took it upon themselves to stop him, and then he would blush and look down and not say anything for the next hour. Harry didn’t really understand how Longbottom could be so good at Herbology and so terrible at Potions, but at least he was putting his attention to something useful. Herbology was an important subject, after all – just not as important as, say, Defence against the Dark Arts (at least in Harry’s eyes). Still, as Hermione frequently reminded him, not everyone had his memory, and Harry would just have to live with that. It’s not like he minded being at the top of his classes anyway (though he shared the spot with Hermione in most subjects, and Tracey was only a few steps behind them).
Harry looked up from his ice cream. Theodore was watching him with careful eyes; Narcissa was smiling softly at her son; and Draco was chatting enthusiastically about the new Quidditch broom. This was his life now. No more Dursleys, no more hatred. Just this.
“I don’t know – I didn’t see them,” Myrtle said. She floated up to the oversized circular window sitting high in the wall of the room. “I was just sitting here, thinking about death, and it fell through the top of my head.” She sniffed again, seemingly on the verge of going back to her wailing.
“Absolutely! You’re a natural, kid – a little more practise, you could be one of the best damn seekers in the game!”
Neville sat up straight, excited. “Because no one has made direct eye contact! The hallway was flooded when Mrs Norris was Petrified, she saw it in the reflection; Colin Creevey was looking through his camera; Justin Finch-Fletchley through Nearly Headless Nick – remember, Harry, you saw Nearly Headless Nick when you found Finch-Fletchley Petrified? And Hermione and Nott – Madam Pomfrey showed us, it was the mirror! Hermione’s smart, she must have been using the mirror to check around corners so that she and Nott wouldn’t be killed if they saw it! She’s a genius!” Neville gasped for air, and as soon as he saw everyone’s eyes on him, promptly went bright red and sunk deep in his chair. “Or, I don’t know, for some other reason,” he backtracked.
Harry thought, and had to bite his cheek, hard, to stop from bursting into some form of hysterics. Whether the flood he held back was tears or laughter, he couldn’t say – maybe both.
Relaxing into bed was still a relief, however. Harry was on the verge of falling asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, but couldn’t quite reach it. He turned onto his back and stared at the roof of his bed’s canopy.
“It belongs to Tom Riddle,” Harry told them, before they could start squabbling. “Only, I don’t know anyone by that name who goes here.”
Harry entered the Potions classroom already on edge. He sat at a table with Blaise, behind Pansy and Draco on the left side of the room. The other first year Slytherins followed suit, and the Gryffindors filed into the right. Ron Weasley gave Harry a scowl as he passed. Draco scowled right back, but Harry ignored it. He had bigger problems – namely, Professor Severus Snape.
Pansy glanced at him with an expression of mock-surprise. “Weasley, that might just be the only smart thing to ever have come out of your mouth.”
So distracted was he by mulling over the mirror and what Dumbledore had said, that it wasn’t until he was lying in bed that night that he thought to wonder how, exactly, the Headmaster knew what he saw in the mirror, when Harry had sworn to never tell.
Harry opened the gift cautiously to reveal a large, soft cloak. It seemed to be fairly standard, until he put it on.
“I followed you because you don’t think!” Draco yelled. “You get yourself into trouble constantly, first with the Cerberus, then with the Mirror, now with an illegal
“I didn’t think,” Harry took a step forward. “I never do, really. I don’t care about me getting hurt, not if it can help us in the long run, but you do. I didn’t think about what it might have done to you if something had happened in the diary, and I’m sorry.”
Harry swung the lantern in as wide an arc as he dared. The spiders retreated from the light before scuttling back in.
Harry thought hazily through the Mandrake’s scream piercing through his earmuffs. The sound was familiar – it seemed the twins had managed to replicate the creature's screech for the Opening Feast prank, if with less dangerous consequences.
Harry dodged out of the way as the basilisk struck. Its mighty fangs dug into the stone where Harry had stood half a second earlier, but it barely paused before striking again. His wand was still clutched like a lifeline in his hand, but basilisk scales were used to make armour for a reason – they were spell retardant, just like…
“You heard Pansy, Professor,” said Blaise, expressionless as ever – though Harry thought he could see a pleased glint in his eye. “Off you go.”
Draco came back into the room, then, three cups of tea balanced carefully in his hands, and Harry put back on a smile.
Millicent cackled, gaining a hiss from Madam Pince – that she ignored, of course. “Nice one, mini Weasley!”
Draco looked just as pissed off, but was suddenly distracted by a clear silver ball lying on the ground by Longbottom’s abandoned broom.
Blaise Zabini was everywhere, after that. He sat next to Harry in the Common Room, in the Great Hall, in the majority of his classes – most notably Potions. Draco was obviously displeased, but tolerated it by constantly sitting to Harry’s left, when Blaise would sit to his right. This in turn threw out the whole first year Slytherin hierarchy – Vince and Greg now had to sit in front of Draco rather than on either side, because Pansy refused to abandon her spot next to Draco and Daphne didn’t want to give up her spot next to Pansy. They adapted, however, and though no one mentioned the obvious change, it was silently accepted, and the Slytherins moved on.
“That’s very good advice, Professor,” said Harry. He couldn’t quite bring himself to say ‘thank you’.
“Oh no, oh no, oh no.” Neville Longbottom was shaking as badly as Harry was where his wand was keeping the club aloft.
“That being said, there are some messages that you must still hear – some of you, not for the first time.” He glared at a lanky third year boy, who wisely kept his gaze firmly on the floor. “You have been chosen to join the House of cunning and ambition. This is an honour. However, many of the people – students and teachers alike – outside of this room do not think so. Therefore, you will all of you remember Slytherin House’s third key trait: fraternity. I do not care if you like your Housemates. I do not care if you hate each other with the passion of a foolhardy Gryffindor, so long as the very second you step out of that door you present a united front. The rest of the school will not help you. Slytherin students must appear as one. United you stand, divided you fall, and there are those in this school who want nothing more than to see every last one of you fall.” Snape’s beady eyes fixed with Harry’s out of nowhere, the ferocity in them almost frightening. “Therefore,” he continued, keeping his black gaze on Harry, “If I see or hear of any stupid, rash,
“Treat him well,” McGonagall said sternly, fixing both boys with a stare one at a time. “I’ll be seeing you at Hogwarts, Mr. Potter.”
Harry jolted, spinning around. Professor McGonagall took in the scene, her stern face carefully neutral.
“Maybe,” Harry said, and focussed on the barely visible trail of tiny spiders leading them further into the trees. Although – had the spiders gotten bigger?
Harry blinked his eyes rapidly to re-adjust them to long-distance focus as they walked out into the corridor, nudging his glasses further up his nose. They were taped together rather badly, as Dudley had snapped them when Harry was eight and the Dursleys had declined to buy him a new pair.
“So was I! It’s fascinating switching worlds, isn’t it? I’m Hermione Granger, by the way.” Hermione stuck her hand out, and Harry was rather amused to note that it was in a very similar fashion to how Draco had offered friendship on the train.
“I see you’re already building your fan club,” Lockhart laughed. Harry watched himself enact the hex in his mind. “Nowhere near as big as mine of course, but not to worry, little protégé – you’ll learn.”
Harry turned his gaze from the Headmaster and scanned the stands for other familiar faces. Huddled into one corner of the witness stand were the heads of the Weasley family, with Ginny, tiny and scared, between them. Her mother was whispering something into her ear, and her father had an arm tightly around the young girl’s shoulders.
came quickly – though not as quickly as Harry wanted it to. One moment he was in the strange man Ollivander’s wand shop with a familiar tingling warmth rushing through his bones and the next, he was standing next to Professor McGonagall on platform 9 and ¾, staring at a bright red train that took his breath away.
Hermione reached forward to give Harry a sweet smile and a squeeze on the arm. “We’re here for you, Harry. Whatever you need.”
The prefects hurried to obey, though Harry heard Gemma Farley grumbling under her breath. He could relate – what the Hell was Dumbledore thinking?
When he finally pulled back, his eyes were suspiciously wet. “Hagrid was right, wasn’t he? And Mother said it too - Dumbledore was the only one working to stop this. He’s a madman but – everyone’s scared of him, aren’t they?”
By the time Harry was climbing into the car next to Piers, he had settled on a sort of wary excitement, which couldn’t even be dampened by the other boys’ comments.
birthday. It was magically bigger on the inside, and charmed to shrink and enlarge at the tap of his wand and a password. At Narcissa’s suggestion, Harry had set his password in parseltongue, though the word itself wasn’t particularly inventive. (‘Fraternity’, and Lord help him if Millicent, Blaise, or Pansy ever found out – they’d never let him live it down.)
Harry couldn’t quite resist raising one eyebrow. Seeing his ex-prefect bow in his general direction was a surreal experience, and not one he could say he enjoyed. He was distracted from the strange feeling, however, by the gentle rush of a spell being cast over his person – a privacy charm, if he wasn’t mistaken. His gaze on Gemma sharpened. Harry hadn’t even seen her wand move, but he didn’t doubt it was her. What could she need to discuss with them that was so important as to require a privacy charm?
“And you think they should have?” Neville asked. He jutted out his chin in a challenge that likely would have seemed more impressive had his hands not been shaking – but he challenged nonetheless.
“I agree,” Hermione said, watching Harry and Draco cautiously, as though waiting for another argument to break out. Harry gave her a reassuring smile.
Harry took a deep breath. “I can’t promise I’ll care about what happens to me enough to not do stupid, reckless things, but… I don’t want to hurt you, Draco. I’ll be more careful. I promise.”
Already in the stands, easily identifiable from his garish blue robes enchanted with flying broomsticks zooming over the fabric, was Albus Dumbledore. The Headmaster was chatting amiably with the witches and wizards around him, seemingly unaware of the trio who had just entered the courtroom. Harry wasn’t convinced – Dumbledore may have appeared a friendly old man, but he was a powerful wizard. Narcissa had discussed the range of Dumbledore’s influence with Harry and Draco over the first half of the break. Harry wasn’t about to forget it anytime soon.
,” Harry said. The snake lifted itself from its coiled position and cocked its head to one side, as if curious. “
Snape picked on the Gryffindors relentlessly, taking points for the smallest of errors and giving the Slytherins points at every opportunity. He never took points from Harry – because of his House, no doubt – but constantly berated him like he was dressed in red and gold rather than green and silver.
Hermione’s bloodcurdling scream turned his head and Harry’s heart stopped when he saw the troll slam its weapon into the sinks, a bare inch from her leg.
“Why are we going to a Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match again?” Daphne complained. “There aren’t even any cute boys in Hufflepuff.”
He resisted looking at the stands. Hermione and Neville were there, he knew, and Harry’s Slytherin friends – even, to his surprise, Daphne and Pansy. Daphne, of course, would be inspecting her nails and pretending not to be interested in the older boys trying out, while Pansy would be waiting eagerly for a particularly nasty injury.
He spared half a desperate prayer that the beast wouldn’t kill the twins on its way to him, before focussing wholly on not slipping on the damp stones beneath his racing feet.
Harry laughed at her version of congratulations, and turned back to where Pansy and Millicent were in yet another argument about nicknames. Around the table, Daphne was explaining witches’ fashion to an amused Blaise; Tracey and Theodore were exchanging lists of books for the other to read; Vince and Greg were attempting to shovel as much food into their mouths as possible before they had to leave for the train; and Draco was-
Harry gave her a wave as they turned in their separate directions, and began to make his way further into the dungeons.
“Ah, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Weasley,” Professor McGonagall called, drawing the attention of two identical red-headed boys.
Longbottom nodded enthusiastically, eyes still stretched open in surprise at the whole ordeal, and shook Harry’s offered hand with his good one.
It took Harry a moment to notice him, but soon enough the shadows behind McGonagall moved, revealing a lurking Filch.
There was light shining from behind Hagrid’s nauseatingly pink curtains when they finally arrived at  the groundskeeper’s small home, so Harry didn’t feel too bad about knocking on the door – but they was greeted with quite the sight.
“Wait, Draco,” Harry put a hand on his arm. He sent a placating look at his friends, and turned to the youngest male Weasley. “Look, I don’t really care if you think I’m the Heir of Slytherin or not. I don’t even care about how evil you think Slytherins are. All I know is that you have a choice to make, because I’m not going to sit here and let an innocent girl get killed. You can hate us, or you can come with us, because we’re going after Ginny. We’re going into the Chamber.”
“Like what?” Blaise stared him down, calm as ever. “Pansy’s right, Harry. There’s not a lot we can do. Or should do, even.”
The tall, dark-skinned boy settled himself on a rickety desk between Harry and the door, and proceeded to stare Harry down with a calculated gaze.
Harry looked up into the stands and squinted. Sure enough, sitting next to Snape were the pristine forms of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Narcissa may have smiled down at them, but at that distance Harry couldn’t really tell. He would bet his brand new broom that Lucius was glaring at him, though.
Harry was in and out of the Hospital Wing in a matter of minutes thanks to Madam Pomfrey’s medical prowess, his arm healed and barely aching. Waiting for him and his friends outside, unfortunately, was a familiar first year.
Blaise shook his head. “And what if he doesn’t listen? We’re just a bunch of kids, remember. Besides, the Stone can’t
There was someone tugging on his sleeve. Harry turned to look, and met the anxious brown eyes of Neville Longbottom.
“She was upset, so she went to the bathroom. The bathroom in the dungeons! What if she’s in trouble? We have to help her! We can’t just leave her to-”
This is a bit of a filler to be honest, sorry! I know it's been a while. But less than a year which - hey, isn't bad for me. See the end notes for some rambling background info that has no relevance to the story, but which I think about a weird amount.
Harry had to put genuine effort into stopping himself from jumping with glee. Instead, he very slowly brought one finger up to mark the name, careful not to move his eyes away instinctively. Once he had placed it directly above his nail, he traced the connective lines from Black’s name to Narcissa’s. Cousins – that wasn’t too bad. Harry didn’t know what Narcissa had been so worried about; it’s not like Harry had any place to talk when it came to extended relatives.
Dumbledore nodded his head, oddly sombre. “Quite a violent death for so ancient a creature, don’t you think, Harry?”
“No, Harry. But I must ask you… is there anything you’d like to tell me?” Dumbledore peered at him over his half-moon glasses with a careful eye. “Anything at all?”
Harry didn’t really hear him. That was another reason he hated crowds – he didn’t like being touched, not by adults and especially not by strangers. Gilderoy Lockhart’s hand was warm where it clutched at his shoulder and his robes smelled like too much expensive cologne and he
“Mr Potter,” he sneered. “Our new celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
Blaise lay awake. He listened carefully for Harry’s breathing to even out, waiting. When he was sure it was safe, he waited ten minutes more. Finally, he pushed back the thick emerald drapes around his bed and crept on silent feet to Draco’s own closed curtains.
His eyes widened all of a sudden as he remembered something. “Are my friends okay? Draco and Blaise and Neville and Hermione?”
“And you don’t think that would look a bit strange? Going down there for a visit and then refusing to visit him again?”
“Did you hear that?” Harry barely noticed Blaise and Draco steadying him, so focused was he on the need to find whatever was whispering that was tightening his chest.
Privately, Minerva thought Harry was handling this remarkably well for a child raised in a Muggle household, but Harry had had a lot of practice in not showing emotion (his cousin Dudley had taught him when he was quite young that crying got you nothing but more pain, and had since learned to keep his thoughts off his face. He did not tell the Professor this, but perhaps he didn’t have to – perhaps tattered clothes and nervous looks were enough. He was unaware that yes; they were).
Harry heard Tom curse, and spells being thrown as the teenage Lord Voldemort faced off against the Weasley twins, but the basilisk was already moving again and so was he.
“So there’s a Cerberus in the school,” Blaise whispered. “I think we should analyse this back in the dungeons.”
Harry gave her a small smile in return. She was very pretty, with dark skin and a smattering of lighter freckles across her nose, and she stood at only a few inches taller than Draco. Despite her unthreatening appearance, however, there was a glint in her dark eyes that told Harry to do everything he could to stay on her good side.
“But if you didn’t kill the girl fifty years ago, what did?” Harry demanded, looking up at the creature.
The dog began to growl, and it was then that Harry looked up and saw what must have been the most beautiful thing in the world.
“’Our’,” echoed Draco, alarmed eyes flicking around the shadows of the clearing, but Harry wasn’t listening.
She was cut off by the sound of someone clearing their throat, loudly. The group jumped, before turning around to see a stern, wrinkled face staring down at them.
“What I think doesn’t matter,” Daphne evaded delicately. “What matters is that if war breaks out - and there already rumours, don’t look at me like that Blaise, you know your mother has heard them too – there are rumours that the Dark Lord is going to return. If that happens, and he wants Harry dead, there’s nothing at all that can stop him.”
The other boy gave an incredulous laugh. “You don’t even know what you’re apologising for, you dolt.”
“Give me the remembrall, Malfoy,” Weasley said, lip curled in a poor attempt at being threatening. “Or I’ll take it back.”
Draco stomped his foot. “For Merlin’s sake, Harry, I am not going to let you get yourself killed like a bloody Gryffindor!” He exhaled, all at once, and then said, “You’re my best friend.”
Just as with the entrance to the Chamber, the castle itself seemed to respond to his voice. The metal snakes shifted, an awful grinding of old metal on old metal making Harry wince as each embellishment recoiled into themselves. A massive click echoed through the passageway, and the door swung free with a drawn out
“Tha’ is wha’ we’re here for,” Hagrid replied, kneeling down next to the liquid. He scooped his fingers through it and held his hand up for them to see. “Tha’s unicorn blood, tha’ is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one’s been injured bad by somethin’. It’s our job to find the poor beast. So, Neville, ‘ermione, you’ll come with me.”
Harry turned to face Theodore Nott, rather thankful for the distraction as he was getting quite annoyed. Hogwarts was meant to be his escape from being ordered about. He would not tolerate being mothered by Draco, friends or not.
“Hey, watch it!” Millicent tugged Pansy out of the way as Ginny Weasley scurried past them at high speed, wild red hair covering her face.
The boy wasn’t wrong, but Harry appreciated Gemma’s defence. Theo didn’t have that many friends outside of the second year group in Slytherin, quiet as he was, but even if he wasn’t Harry’s friend he was still a snake. He was one of theirs, and they should respect what had happened to him.
Blaise put one hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Just talk to Draco, alright? Sit down, and just… talk.” He shook his head. “It’s way overdue, anyway.”
Harry fought to catch his breath, before reaching over and grabbing Draco’s hand tightly in his own with a burst of confidence. Draco managed a shaky smile in response, but Harry didn’t really feel okay until Draco had squeezed tightly at his hand.
Let me know what you think of the Slytherins? I'm slightly nervous about them, as I know every author has different takes on them all, but I think I'm happy with the end result. Still, let me know your thoughts.
“The old block as much as us,” finished Fred. He gestured to the bed across from Harry’s, where Ginny’s bed was behind her own set of closed curtains. “Ginny will learn it someday.”
Of all the seniors Harry was expecting to see waiting with Ron Weasley at the first floor girl’s bathroom as the Slytherins approached, Lockhart in tow, the infamous Weasley twins really should have been at the top of his list – and yet, he remained surprised.
Draco grimaced. “He’s not a professor, and my father says he’s a total oaf. Plus, have you seen the size of him? He looks to be half-giant.”
Harry exchanged a glance with the other members of his group, focussing on Neville as the twins’ Housemate.
Millicent, as it turned out, wasn’t really correct about Gilderoy Lockhart. He wasn’t as bad as she’d said – he was
He watched with mounting horror as his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, Cousin Dudley, and the visiting Masons all stared in shock at the snowy white owl carrying a mountain of letters and flying – in plain daylight – into the distance.
“You were brilliant today, Harry!” Colin Creevey beamed at him, his words punctuated by the blinding flash of his camera.
Tracey shook her head. “You’d be surprised. A ghost like Myrtle? She won’t be letting that go anytime soon.”
He voiced the question aloud on accident, the mess in his head dissolving the control he once had on his mouth. The sludgy shame in his gut thickened.
A silent moment, and then: “And you definitely think Potter’s the Heir of Slytherin?” Abbot sounded uncertain.
“Do you mean Lockhart or Weasley?” Pansy joked. She was tugging them away before the Gryffindor could react, leading them quickly towards Lockhart’s office.
“Merlin, Harry,” Millicent exclaimed with exhilaration – the most excited Harry had ever seen her, as if she had been flying herself. “Draco wasn’t kidding, you fly like a professional!”
Lockhart snapped his gaze up to look at them, sending his usually perfect golden curls flying over his eyes. “What are you doing here?”
Harry gave her one last gentle pet before turning to the parcel on his bed. He couldn’t fight the swell of happiness in his chest at sight of his name printed in Draco’s characteristically perfect cursive on the top letter. Even here, in the cold dread of Privet Drive, his best friend made him feel warm. The grin on his face was goofy and certainly embarrassing, he knew, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to care.
“I did not,” Harry told her. “You and Neville did, but I didn’t. Besides, owning a dragon is illegal in Britain, remember? Maybe,” he looked at the twins cautiously, “Fred and George can help us.”
“Relax, relax!” the man chuckled. “You can have a room, kid, it’s okay. And tomorrow we’ll see about calling in some help for you, alright?”
“Hermione!” Longbottom rushed towards her, stopping just short of squeezing her into a hug. “I’m so sorry.”
Therefore, it was with a small smile and relaxed shoulders that Harry settled himself into the nearest empty table, pulled out his Potions text, and began to read.
on the table to clean it, before folding her hands delicately between them and staring directly into his eyes.
That Sunday afternoon, Harry found himself cornered in an abandoned potions classroom somewhere in the vast labyrinth of the dungeons by one Blaise Zabini.
Longbottom’s eyes widened rather comically as Harry approached his bedside. It appeared he hadn’t been expecting anyone – true to Harry’s observations – let alone the Boy Who Lived.
“You opened a random book left in a bathroom without checking it for curses?” Blaise raised an eyebrow.
"No, thanks," Harry chuckled through a tight grin, hoping it came across as a good-natured joke instead of unfiltered snark. He stepped away from the desk and over to her in three long strides, extending his hand with an easy smile like a well-trained celebrity. "Forgive me if we've already met. You do look familiar, but I can't quite place a name."
tell your friends you're gay — then you can have cake," he rationalized with himself, surprisingly finding the promise soothing. Even if things went pear-shaped (
There was no question as to why Graham was struck silent. Draco and Deacon hadn't told any of the victims' parents of the other murders. It was hard enough to accept that their child had been murdered. It would be even harder to grasp that their child had only been one in a sick pool. Being ignorant of this, Harry had just walked this man into the middle of that pool, in high danger of drowning in it.
Before they'd even made it to the door, a man was out on the porch, shouting at them. They could just barely see his torso above the tall grass, but there was no mistaking the anger in his features. Harry looked around the neighborhood cautiously, thankful he was still armed with his wand. The fact that not a single person out in their own lawn was looking their way spoke to how often this man must yell at strangers.
"I'm sure you'll find at least one girl at this thing who can look past your personality for the night." He almost physically sighed in renewed disappointment.
It really was like some sort of surreal dream. Possibly a nightmare. Yet to be determined. Everything around Harry was honestly too much to be true. The air around this house was too clean, flush with all the best of the vegetation enclosing them. It was practically overflowing with life everywhere he looked – even within the confines of the grounds, gardens flourished and birds fluttered – but the ghost of some darkness akin to death hung heavy in every particle he breathed and every sight he took in. And the house? Malfoy was right in referring to it as a manor. It was large and likely lonely, cut off out here from anyone and anything else. It was something out of a Victorian romance novel about high class, white privilege.
His answer wasn't quite a "yes", but it definitely wasn't a "no", either. It was somewhere in between, toeing the line of maybes and somedays. It wasn't a promise, nor was it a denial.
This all felt too real. Surreal. It felt like a bad memory brought back to life. The pressure and fear of failure from his teenage years suddenly felt
." Draco was standing in the doorway to the house, his fingers deathly tight on the handle. "I think it's time we go."
By the time Deacon rolled in, around an hour later, they already had a full-formed plan for their day. A set of interviews lined up and scheduled out. And if they went the way Harry was hoping they would, he had a solid plan ready for the next day as well. A plan to tear into the Misuse of Magic office and demand to know who was misusing
Swearing inward, Draco vowed to police his emotions a little better. There was no way enough time had passed for them to openly discuss how dark he was feeling. More importantly, they weren't in the right place for the reason behind it. He hung his head, allowing it to fall heavily into his free hand. He felt sick. He felt…over it. All of it.
Harry stopped in front of the bonfire, far enough away from his friends to keep their conversation between them for a moment longer. "Nothing wrong with delicate or feminine for anyone. Nothing at all." As if to prove a point, he reached up to gently trace the jut of Draco's cheek. His features had filled out as an adult, guided by more consistent eating habits and general contentment, and he suddenly felt self-conscious. He tilted his head away and wondered inwardly just how inebriated Harry might be himself.
"Well, come on down," Harry chided the cat, a mangy Maine coon rightfully dubbed 'The King' (never just King, as he had rightfully earned his title as the one and only). "You'll just have to deal with the mess a bit longer. I have no motivation to clean it up. Not just yet."
His words felt like prickly, volatile vomit. He was greeting Shea's kindness with venom and before the words had even left his mouth, he knew that. But it was too easy to revert into himself when he was upset. It was too easy to put on that mask he'd worn for so. Many. Years.
the judgement in her gaze. He didn't have to look at her to know that the sigh she leaked through her nose meant she was disappointed.
At first, Hermione's life plans didn't include a boyfriend. Or a husband. No romantic attachments of any kind. She had actually written it out in bubble letters across a dream board in year seven. And…then she grew up and the hormones kicked in. Even so, only with Harry did she ever allow herself to be anything akin to 'boy crazy'. Especially after he came out and most especially after their first screening of
They had stayed at St. Mungo's with the boy for as long as they could that night. The rock had pierced more than just skin. Everyone kept reminding them that he was lucky to be alive. Just a few more minutes could have meant the end of it. If he had passed out in that field, there never would have been a chance. They never would have known that he needed help.
It didn't matter how adamantly Harry had fought to clear the Malfoy name after the war. It didn't matter that he was there to testify before the entire Wizengamot. (It didn't matter that doing so had given him nightmares about dementors for months.) The Malfoy family was still found guilty of their war crimes. It was still on their record even if none of them had been sent to Azkaban. They were
It was on that mix of too much beer and an indulgent amount of fried wontons that Harry found himself sated and relaxed. Under this pliancy, his tongue felt loose and carefree — finally making him brave enough to voice some of the concerns roosted in his worrisome mind. "So," he began on a slur, "since I'm, like,
Once Harry hit their department, the chatter only worsened. Everyone around him somehow thought that since he was working for their boss, they were somehow working together. One guy even went so far as to congratulate them – both of them – on the amazing work they were doing. Even though he most likely had no idea what it was Harry was working on in the first place.
"But then suddenly we were in an actual, physical war and all of that seemed petty. All that seemed to matter were the small moments adding up to good or bad. And in the end…I guess you came out heavier on the good side…."
surname?) wasn't until the next afternoon. Harry knew if he sat at home, he would go mad. Also he might actually have to tell Hermione of his latest bout of idiocy. And, besides, it really was high time he visited his parents again.
The woman, who Draco had been warmly instructed to call Cheryl during their first session only a month previous, wrinkled her brow in genuine worry. She gestured for him to continue his path to the familiar, jarring red couch and relaxed back into her chair across from it. Draco followed the suggestion, the weariness settling into his bones as he felt the comfort of the cushions beneath him.
"I'm thinking…." Harry released the building lump in his throat on a heavy sigh. "I'm thinking about how much I want you to complete me — every single part of me." He huffed a laugh, fully aware of how cheesy that sounded.
Across the table, Draco made a soft noise which sounded somewhere between a gasp and a lament. Though he nearly lost his resolve altogether, Harry took a deep breath and soldiered through — Draco deserved this explanation more than possibly anyone else. "We were having a fight. I can't even remember what it was about, honestly. It was one of those things where…all the little things build up into one big explosion. And, er, the explosion was a little more literal than I had intended." Harry's face grew hot as embarrassment wholly consumed him. "He's quick on his feet, Neville, so there didn't end up being any damage to the structure of the greenhouse. But he did lose most of the plant life which the investigative team deemed 'Excessive Property Damage'."
Shaky and unsure, Harry shook his head back and forth and finally looked back up at Draco. "No…no, what?"
"Yeah?" Harry asked as he stabilized himself upon the counter behind him. It was haunting, really, to witness the way Draco could force himself to disappear like that.
Likely attempting to diffuse the tension, Narcissa laughed. Or…cackled, might have been more apt. "You have quite the mouth, don't you?"
"Not all parents know their son is going to grow up to be a villain. They can't all be named Scorpius Malfoy."
"And stuff," Draco scoffed, but overall kept a more relaxed demeanour. Harry had the creeping feeling of being surveyed, picked apart inch by inch. Like Draco might not believe him. Like Harry might have a reason to lie about something so difficult for him to even say.
So it had been a few years, especially after voluntarily assigning himself to desk duty, since he had seen a cold, dead body. Seeing one now, so small and still, had his stomach turning. A thousand thoughts raced through his head, but the most prominent was regretting such a rich breakfast. Feeling light-headed, he apologized and stepped back from the medical examiner. If he stared much longer at Martina's body on that table, he was likely to puke.
Harry could read a myriad of emotions in the way Malfoy frowned. And, weirdly enough, he found he could identify with all of them. "No one's is…."
Without a lick of remorse or urgency, Draco righted the newspaper and scanned the headline. His eyes flicked up to meet Astoria's for just a moment before returning to the article with a furrowed brow. "Astoria…. I'm so sorry."
By the point, Harry was about a hundred shades past pink. He was full on lobster red and grinning even despite his humiliation. "There is nothing to tell! Honestly!" he insisted when she made to protest. "Nothing happened, despite what either of you two tarts want to imagine. Draco and I are
"Uncomfortable?" Harry lifted a brow, barely holding back a smile. The word seemed to have shaken him from his daze. He made to step away, and Draco was sure he was going to leave him there, hyperventilating and heartbroken at the edge of the Forbidden Fucking Forest.
Blinking himself out of his fretful daze, Harry looked up at Hermione and plastered on an expected grin. "Of course," he laughed, even while feeling the guilt of not yet having earned his prize. If he was going to do this — really do it — he didn't have much time left. "Wait," he countered, wincing despite the conviction in his voice. "Before we do dessert…." He stalled, pushing around the remnants of stew at the bottom of his bowl. Even just the idea of suggesting he had something to confess had him shaking.
With a frown, Draco licked his spoon clean before setting it on the counter. He leaned forward, hands braced against the laminate and regarded the uncomfortable way Teddy shrunk into himself. "Doing what again?"
"Honestly, you're just lucky our contract didn't have dangerous repercussions. Most of them do, you see. Most of them are drafted with a death and dismemberment clause. I asked that to be left out of your contract. You see, I thought I wouldn't need it. I thought you might actually live up to your name."
Harry wasn't certain if she meant "sharp" as in quick-witted or like a thorn. Either way, it sounded almost like a compliment and he was filled with smug pride at having ruffled her feathers. He grinned, subconsciously loosening their fingers in order to squeeze Malfoy's knee. It took him a second to realise how strange and tender this action was, reconciling that knowledge with the way Malfoy had startled. He pulled back almost immediately, deciding to finally occupy himself with eating. It seemed a much safer task than either spouting off further or accidentally losing himself in the fantasy they were crafting.
His hopes were ill-placed and far too optimistic. He knew Draco too well to think he might freely give up without at least a small power struggle. At least both their tongues were too relaxed to throw curses this time.
Unfazed, Astoria took his place in front of the full-length mirror mounted to his wardrobe. "He's very sweet, Draco," she reassured while swiping a mascara fleck from her cheek. "Even if he was absent the day they taught you gays about fashion…."
With a snort, Draco moved his left arm under the table. His faded Dark Mark was covered – as it often was – but that didn't mean they both didn't know it was very much still there. Only a ghost of what it once was, but still a daily reminder of his past sins. "I can assure you, I don't."
story. He placed the darkest one in front of James, squeezing his dad's shoulder on his way past with the other two. "You can't afford to lose the house."
It was instantly easy to tell that Harry was guilty. Against his own will, his head bowed and his cheeks flushed a deep red. He couldn't deny it even if he tried. His body had already given him away. "I haven't quite decided yet if it's stupid. But I'm sure you'll determine it is."
It didn't take long for James to come running. That's what the bell was for, after all. His hair, graying at the sides, was in predictable disarray. His eyes were bugged and full of fleeting fear. Every bit of him looked wild and caught off guard. But Harry only had but a second to take this all in before he was being enveloped in a bone-crushing hug. "Harry," his father sighed in relief.
Disturbingly, he didn't say anything for the rest of the night. Not even when Harry attempted to bribe him with an extra helping of dessert. Not even when Ron tried to cheer him up by charming the dishes to dance to the sink – something he was usually rather fond of. He only gave a hollow smile before going back to staring at his knotted hands in his lap.
Draco swallowed back the ill feeling this thought gave him and took just a single step forward. "St. Mungo's," he snapped. "
Something was keeping him from leaving. That something was likely the cold bed waiting for him at home. He couldn't go back there. Not right now. Not before just a taste of human contact.
And, boy, did he pick the most direct place to start them off. Harry paused, leaning on his arms over the back of a metal folding chair, focusing first on breathing before he could even think about responding. He'd worked himself up so much that his heart felt entirely too fast and it was almost like he couldn't breathe around it.
"You really should be nicer to them, Potter. Wouldn't want your pristine reputation sullied in the papers…."
"Draco used to drink a lot. When he drank, sometimes things would get violent. Scorpius was born premature and he... Well, he almost didn't make it. That was Draco's turning point and I do honestly believe rehab helped him manage his emotions better. I don't know if he drinks anymore-" Harry tried his best to keep stone-faced, not wanting to betray Draco by giving him away while Astoria surveyed him. She shook her head, waving the thought away. "If he does, then I do hope he's never showed you that side of him.
"I brought coffee." Harry set two cups down on the desk. He knew before it was even said where they were from. The tempting scent of the perfect brew and fresh-baked pastries filled Draco with instant, irreplaceable comfort. "It's from that Muggle place Greengrass works at. Shea suggested it. He was…very helpful this morning. Call me crazy, but I don't think he's all that mad at you, anymore. How about Deacon? Did he say anything to you yet?"
"Calm down. They're just using it to track your vitals," Draco cautioned to Harry's right. His hand was placed just-so on the thin mattress, like perhaps just a moment previous it had just been holding Harry's own.
And here it is! The final chapter. Maybe. I think. There might be one in the future, I don't know yet. But for now I'm considering this story wrapped, even if it is a bit of a shattered ending. Thanks so much for reading and please leave a comment with your thoughts!
Filch chuckled cruelly when he heard them. “There’s worse than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that.”
“It’s ridiculous,” she told him on one of their evenings spent skipping dinner in the library. “What’s the point in doing something that has such a high risk of getting you hurt, or killed? Although the charm on the brooms
“Well, could an Acromantula do this?” Neville asked, fidgeting with the sleeves of his robes. “Petrify people, I mean.”
“Haven’t I told you? Killing mudbloods doesn’t matter to me anymore. For many months now my new target has been you. Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you – afraid you’d learn how to work the diary, I’m sure, afraid you’d learn her dirty little secret.”
“Hello there, Firenze,” Hagrid said finally, nodding his head at the centaur. “I see you’ve met our young Mr Potter. You alright there, ‘arry?”
Fang was on them as soon as they passed the threshold, slobber and wagging tail. Harry had to hold back snickering as Draco pushed the drooling dog away with disgust and began inspecting his robes.
Harry considered him carefully, but eventually let it go. If he kept a closer eye on Neville than on any of his other friends that period, well – that was just a precaution.
It was an immensely unsatisfying answer, but Harry sensed that was the best he was going to get. He nodded slowly. “Thank you, sir.”
Professor Quirinus Quirrell raised an eyebrow, far calmer than Harry had ever seen him. “That’s all you can say? The great Boy-Who-Lived? ‘Oh’?”
I'm sorry this chapter isn't up when promised! I fell asleep last night while writing it - hopefully it's not too obvious... But if it makes you feel any better, we're only a couple chapters from the end of the Philosopher's Stone! Hype! Who else is excited for Harry v. Lockhart next year, hm?
“It- It’s also known as Mandragora. And if-,” he took a deep breath to steady himself. “If you hear it scream, it can cause- can cause death.”
“But what?” Millicent interrupted from where she sat on the floor, playing with her cat, Sabre. “From how much Blaise and Draco talk about it, you’re certainly good enough.”
“That’s impressive,” Harry said, because it was what Draco wanted to hear. “But I really don’t know about joining the team. I mean, I like flying, but…”
“Wands at the ready!” Lockhart called. “When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent –
Narcissa kissed his forehead as she had Draco’s, and stood. Her robes, through magic or her own inherent elegance, remained smooth and free of any wrinkling.
“It’s happening tonight,” Hermione said breathlessly. “Professor McGonagall didn’t believe me, I did try but-”
Dumbledore’s office was filled with an impressive amount of magical paraphernalia – a series of strange, silver instruments whirred in unison on a table; bits and bobs and knick knacks sat on every available surface, all foreign to Harry; the Sorting Hat rested, silent, on a high up shelf; and, perhaps most oddly, portraits covered the walls. Within each sat a sleeping witch or wizard, save for one. The exception was an elderly wizard with very small glasses, not unlike Headmaster Dumbledore’s, who was reading a book entitled in a language Harry could not read. The label on his gilded frame read
Draco folded his arms over his chest, refusing to meet Harry’s eyes. “What, are you just going to keep me in here? You know you can’t do that. And I don’t even want to talk to you, you know. This is entirely unfair. I mean, what’s to stop me from just barricading myself in the bathroom if I need to? I bet you didn’t think about that. Although apparently you don’t think about anything these days-”
“How’d you know we were here?” he heard Hermione ask from behind him. Her voice was shaky and small.
“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.” Dumbledore set a disapproving gaze on the Minister. Fudge began to wilt under the stare, but managed to draw himself up to his full – if unimpressive – height.
Harry, Blaise, Draco, Hermione, and Neville were huddled together in a back corner of the library the morning after the Mrs Norris incident. Dumbledore had announced at breakfast that the cat had simply been petrified (to the sound of Filch’s very loud sobs), and that if anyone knew anything about the event, or the message left on the wall, they should speak to a teacher immediately.
“Parseltongue?” suggested Ron. “It’s all snake-stuff, and if Salazar Slytherin never wanted anyone but him and his kids to be able to open it…”
“And why can you not come in one or two at a time?” she asked, hair frazzled and hands on her hips. “I have patients to care for, and I can assure you, Miss Granger and Mr Nott are not going anywhere in a hurry.”
For one, terrifying moment, Harry thought Narcissa would agree. The idea made him want to scream, want to cry and yell until someone understood that he couldn’t go back to the Dursleys’. He
As it turned out, Harry did not need to work out the ‘owl’ business at all. This was because the next morning, after Harry had woken (earlier than the Dursleys so he could make their breakfast, as per usual), he discovered a large number of owls surrounding Number 4, Privet Drive. Harry was quite understandably shocked by this, but nonetheless went outside to investigate.
“Ah, Harry, Harry, Harry,” Lockhart smiled at him, signing his name onto a glossy photo of himself with a flourish. “Can you possibly imagine a better way to spend your night than by helping me answer my fanmail?”
The minor interaction with the groundskeeper had, despite Harry’s irritation at the interruption of his vaguely murderous thoughts, lifted Harry’s mood a little. He walked slower, no longer aiming for the dungeons but directionless.
Harry felt the urge to giggle at the display, and that seemed to be the boys’ intention, as once they saw him relax they each grabbed him by an elbow and began dragging him to the train.
Harry knelt next to Justin, shock turning his limbs to lead, numbing his brain. Justin’s hand was ice cold. Tiny spiders scuttled past, moving as one up the wall and out through a crack in the stone.
The only irritants in the holidays were the glares from Ronald Weasley (which Harry found easier to ignore by the day), and the constant pranks by the Weasley twins and Peeves the poltergeist (which were actually incredibly funny – when Harry wasn’t affected by them). Harry’s personal favourite was when the twins charmed snowballs to follow Professor Quirrell around and hit him on the back of the turban. Maybe that would make it stop smelling so strongly of garlic, Harry mused.
“I’m sure, I’m sure,” Dumbledore nodded. “But I’m afraid I’ll have to take young Harry off your hands.”
“No, it’s. It’s okay.” Draco looked less shaky than before at least, and gave a small smile before squaring his shoulders and glancing towards the spiders. “Should we get the others?”
Also present were some of his other friends parents, though not all of them were such a welcome sight – Magnus Bulstrode, Millicent’s broad-faced father, eyed the people around him with disdainful eyes; Felix Greengrass, Daphne and Astoria’s father, was talking quietly with a sneering Nathaniel and Priya Nott, Theo’s parents; Nora Parkinson, Pansy’s mother and another of Narcissa’s more genuine friends, smiled shrewdly at the Malfoys as they made their way to Lady Zabini’s side. A notepad and quill hovered next to Lady Parkinson’s head – Pansy’s mother was Chief Editor for
“Alrigh’,” Hagrid said eventually, wiping the back of his hand across his eyes. “Alrigh’. Sorry abou’ tha’. Ahem. So. You lo’ will be helpin’ me in the Forest, today. Just some trackin’, nothin’ too hard. See, here.”
“Fawkes,” Harry tried to say, only it seemed the venom that was so strangely cooled had dried every last drop of water from his mouth. What came out was a strange “hhhhcckk” sound. He frowned. That wasn’t what he had wanted to say at all.
After a minute or three of thinking, Harry had decided what it was he would do, and that night he executed the first stage of his plan. With the noiselessness of a child who spoke little and had learned to be silent under threat of pain, Harry snuck out of his cupboard that night and selected Aunt Petunia’s favourite pen from her stationary drawer, along with some crisp white paper. It took him some time once he was back in the relative safety of under the stairs, but eventually he composed what he thought was a rather good sounding letter:
There were howls of barely stifled laughter coming from behind the curtains on Harry’s left. Harry ignored them.
Harry desperately wanted to tell him to bugger off and let in his friends, but he did have two questions – and like hell was he going to go see the Headmaster voluntarily later to ask.
he cried, and as soon as the stone slab was in the air he wrenched it back towards the basilisk as hard as he could. The rock hit the creature’s skull with a sickening
“Yes, yes!” Hagrid replied, a touch too quickly, fidgeting with his oven gloves. “Now, listen. I wanted to show ye something, alrigh’?”
Blaise stared at him for a long time. His normally inexpressive face seemed very open, there in the quiet corridor. His black eyes looked… sad. Harry felt a flash of anger towards whoever would cause that in his best friend, and then a sickness as he realised the culprit was him.
The medi-witch hummed to herself, waving her wand in the air above Harry’s head. Harry fought to stay still beneath the stranger’s movements, but he couldn’t stand to be helpless under someone else’s wand. No one had ever called him a
“Perhaps,” Snape drawled, “It would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.”
“Don’t worry,” Draco told her, slinging his bag over one shoulder with a glare back in Harry’s direction. “I was just leaving.”
This ended up becoming the pattern of Harry’s days over Christmas break. He would wake, join the rest of the school for breakfast (all at one table, the teachers and stragglers of the four Houses in one), and then read in the Common Room until Adrian came to get him for a game. Gemma would accompany them more often than not, though she always claimed it was merely out of boredom. In the evenings, Gemma began to teach him Wizard’s Chess with the soundtrack of Adrian’s snarky comments. Harry found their interactions rather hilarious, and quite enjoyed sitting back and watching the two of them battle each other (though sometimes it was so fast-paced that he wouldn’t know who was winning until the loser was cursing under their breath).
The Lady of the Manor awaited them next to the magnificent fireplaces reserved for the Floo Network. Narcissa Malfoy looked stunningly beautiful, as always, standing elegantly in flowing dress robes of Acromantula silk. Had Harry not known any better, he would have thought she were going to some royal event, not the criminal trial of her own husband. But that was the Malfoy matriarch all over – powerful and lovely, in the face of anything. She and Draco were quite alike in that way, Harry thought.
Hermione straightened her back. “Of course I am. I have to make sure you don’t get yourself into any more trouble.”
“I’m going to have to turn you in, Hagrid,” Riddle was saying when Harry returned his stunned eyes to the scene playing out before him. “I don’t think you meant to kill anyone-”
Harry repeated the mantra in his head several times, until Blaise nudged him lightly to get his attention. Harry tensed, but forced himself to relax a split-second later and turned to look at Blaise.
Harry hit the grass with a thud and clutched at his injured arm. It felt more shattered than just broken, but that wasn’t even the biggest problem, because the Bludger was still coming for him. Harry rolled over as the Bludger hit the ground like a sledge hammer behind him, getting ready to dodge again before a voice called out:
“You should really be more careful, Hadrian,” was Tracey’s response, though she too gave him a brief hug.
Harry nearly snapped at him, but the large man’s appearance gave him pause. He was covered in snow from the outdoors, and carrying the limp corpse of a rooster.
Harry met up with Hermione, Draco, and Blaise later that evening. It had taken a lot of convincing to get Draco to even
Draco hesitated, locking eyes with Blaise. Their wordless conversation passed too quickly for Harry to read, the language of people who have been friends since birth, and Harry found himself distracted, for just a moment, with a burst of jealousy.
“He’s an Alumnus,” said Theo, not bothering to look up from his book. “Attended Hogwarts fifty years ago.”
“Hagrid, the dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.”
The sight kicked Harry’s brain back into gear. “Drop it, Longbottom!” he yelled, and the Gryffindor locked panicked eyes with Harry’s own.
“What have I told you about how I feel about that stuff, Pansy?” Harry sighed. “Blood might matter to you guys, but it doesn’t matter to me.”
“Your grandmother says a lot of things, Longbottom,” Blaise replied. “I don’t suggest you listen to all of them.”
By the time the Chamber finally came to a standstill many minutes later, Harry could hear choked coughs from all around as the small group recuperated, all of them inhaling dust and thick, muck-filled air. Oxygen felt uncomfortably warm and humid on its path to Harry’s lungs but he drew in breaths anyway. The collapse felt as if it had taken all the energy from his body, and his bones still felt like they were shaking with the shocks.
He took a deep breath and focussed on the snakes, the tiny etched markings, the jewelled eyes, and said:
“Perhaps,” the snake said eventually, and probably would have said something else had Dudley not chosen that precise moment to shove Harry to the ground and begin shouting at the top of his lungs for Piers to come and see.
Millicent looked at her like she’d just said she wanted to go swimming with the Giant Squid. “Because of the Nimbus 2001, of course!”
Gilderoy Lockhart’s office was messier than Harry remembered. Aside from what appeared to be every item the professor owned being scattered across the floor, there were, most alarmingly, long, streaking scorch marks on every wall. A few portraits (of Lockhart himself, of course) hung in tatters, the occupants either fled or sulking in the least damaged areas of the paintings. Harry found an explanation for the at least the mess soon enough, as moving further into the room revealed Lockhart himself, sweeping a hurricane through papers and hurling clothes, odd objects, and trophies into two open trunks resting hazardously on the corners of his desk. He didn’t even notice the four of them standing in the doorway until Pansy spoke.
,” she hissed in disgust. “Harry will not be returning here. Not these holidays and not ever again. I will make sure of it. Do not doubt that if that means I must destroy your entire family, I will do so. Hurting a
Harry glanced down at her announcement, and realised with a rush of nausea that she was right. Those weren’t pebbles Pansy was throwing at Lockhart, and that wasn’t the crush of gravel under their feet. Rather, it was the crunch of the skeletons of thousands of small animals, rats and mice and even what looked like possum skulls, layered over the stone ground and covered in slimy muck.
“Why would you follow me, Draco?” Harry asked, infuriated. “I come back and I tell you everything anyway, you’re being ridiculous!”
“It seems you knocked yourself out from magical exhaustion,” Madam Pomfrey told him. “Hardly surprising, considering Miss Farley’s telling of the events. You’ll be fine after some Pepper-Up potion. Your Head of House is delivering that now. Though honestly, fourth day of the year and already I’ve had two patients. Children!” she snorted.
A quick scan of his surroundings answered that question, for Harry had not moved far – just outside of Number 4, Privet Drive, in fact, and so when he glanced up he could very clearly see the iron bars on his own window. Except now, the bars didn’t look so solid. They were twisted and warped, bulging outwards as though some great force had slammed into them from within.
, Hermione had recalled with tears in her voice rather than her eyes – and Harry was quite ready to tell him that right to his damned face before Blaise calmed him down. Blaise, of course, didn’t actually care for what had happened, but he
The physicality of it was nothing, however, compared to the feeling he got when he lifted his head and realised, with sinking stomach, that the pile of rocks had landed squarely, wall to wall, between him and the way out of the Chamber. He was trapped.
but none of us are qualified to take down any monster, let alone one that once belonged to Salazar Slytherin himself.”
(Minerva McGonagall noticed this, and said nothing, though the feeling of suspicion that had settled in her chest since receiving Harry Potter’s letter tightened, just a little.)
So. Mental health hit in a bad way. I needed to give myself time to recover and I realise it's been a while, so. Sorry.
He said the name like it was the worst insult one could receive, and Ron scowled at him in response.
Draco nodded, though it was slightly shaky. “You’re right, of course. Everything will be fine.” He smiled, the tiny tender thing that had grown more familiar to Harry the longer the spectre of Lucius Malfoy was gone from the Manor. “I’m glad you’re here, Harry.”
Neville shuffled forward. “We’ll get Dumbledore,” he promised. “We’ll make them listen. They’ll come help, you’ll see.”
The group stood in silence for a moment, listening, before Lockhart’s voice echoed up from the bottom of the pipe:
The Headmaster hadn’t seemed to notice Harry’s mood. He chattered non-stop as they wandered down Privet Drive, the broomsticks on his robes whizzing about merrily. If he noticed the nosy, disapproving faces peering through the windows at them as they passed, he hadn’t mentioned it.
Harry raced forward, ignoring the whoosh of air as the Bludger just barely missed his broom yet again. Teakel spun after him, but her Cleansweep was no match for his Nimbus 2001. She stayed on his tail however, as Harry chased after the Snitch, leaning down close to his broom to increase his speed.
Harry pushed the Chasers from his mind, focusing instead on the other Seeker. Terence Higgs had played as Seeker last year, and so normally would have maintained the position by default until Flint graduated and Adrian took over as Captain, but Higgs’ Potions scores had been so awful he’d been replaced mid-year, by order of Professor Snape. The replacement Seeker had been a seventh year, and so now the position was up for grabs once again.
Harry knew for a fact that they hadn’t met. The only haziness in his memory came from the night he had passed out in the Slytherin Common Room, after all, and since he doubted he had met Hagrid then-
That, of course, left room for the shame to flood in. It rushed into his stomach, a tidal wave of humiliation forcing him to keel forward until his nose touched his knees. He thought he might be sick. Twice this year he had embarrassed himself in front of the only friends he had ever had. Why were they still putting up with him?
“Come on,” Harry said, smile wide and thoughts of Salazar Slytherin’s monster for once quieted in his mind. “Let’s go to bed.”
Daphne sighed. “Oh for Merlin’s sake.” She turned to a startled Hermione with a determined look. “I’m sorry, Granger. There. Are you happy now, Hadrian?”
Harry shook his head. “I’ll explain tomorrow, if you’re alright with meeting on a Saturday. At ten?”
“You really need to work on this hero complex, Potter,” he said finally, and plucked the small vial from Hermione’s hand to place in Harry’s. “Don’t get yourself killed.”
Having his friends back at Hogwarts with him was a great source of relief for Harry. Gemma and Adrian were great, of course, but they were much older than him (and Harry still felt rather awkward around Gemma after the incident with the Mirror of Erised). He hadn’t ever really known proper loneliness when he was with the Dursleys (after all, loneliness was missing friends and family, and Harry had never had any friends and family to miss), but he felt it keenly over the holidays. He spoke excitedly with all of his friends about their separate holidays when they returned, and didn’t stop smiling from the moment he spotted them to the moment he went to sleep.
The next few weeks saw Harry practising with his ability every chance he got. He found that there was very little he couldn’t do if he really concentrated, and he greatly enjoyed sitting in his cupboard and making things fly, or change colour, or even appear out of nothing such as he had done with the candle (which he found he could light with naught but a thought). He even made himself hover several inches above the ground, once, but had passed out soon afterwards from a sudden rush of exhaustion. Still, this was perhaps the first thing in Harry’s short life that made him feel truly happy, and he relished in it.
“Alrighty then,” said Probably-George, clapping his hands together. “Guess it’s just us here on out.”
Another reason – the most important, according to Hermione and Tracey – was that the teachers seemed to have all realised at once just how close they were to Christmas break. Therefore, every teacher in the school started piling on ridiculous amounts of homework all at the same time. Harry, Millicent, and Pansy took to sitting together in the Common Room so they could moan about the workload to each other while Blaise watched them amusedly and Tracey told them to shut it so she could work.
“Hello, Lady Malfoy,” Harry bowed his head politely, trying to hide his nervousness. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
Unfortunately, the silence didn’t last very long, because only a few minutes later a familiar boy with platinum blond hair and pointy features opened the door to Harry’s compartment.
Blaise bared his teeth in a smile. “Harry has the charisma – evidenced enough by the fact that we’re all here - we just need to bring the introductions.”
“No, not you- uh, sir,” Harry looked around them in confusion. He was sure he’d heard a voice. “Didn’t you hear that?”
Harry pushed himself shakily to his feet, Draco supporting him on one side. “What do you mean? What was that
“I know who you are,” Justin chuckled. “We all do. Even us Muggleborns.” He turned back to the stage, and Harry saw a fellow Hufflepuff tug him away from the Slytherins with narrowed eyes.
,” Piers sneered, just quiet enough to be out of Petunia and Vernon’s range of hearing (though Harry very much doubted that should they have heard, they would have cared a single fig). “Finally allowed out of the house, are you? Bet you’ll cry when you see the animals, you little
The group reconvened in the library first thing the next morning, though this time with the addition of Blaise.
“You know perfectly well what I mean,” Snape growled. “We’ll have another chat soon. When you’ve had time to decide where your loyalties lie.”
“Oh I think not, Professor,” said Pansy, a rather cruel smirk forming on her face. “You’ll be going first – you know, as the
And then Harry was spat out onto the black tile floors of the Ministry of Magic’s Atrium, and the world span back into normal view. Harry stumbled, but maintained his footing. He took a moment in his head to thank every deity and great historical wizard he could name.
Retrieving some money wasn’t a pleasant experience – as respectful as he tried to be, Harry got the feeling the goblins didn’t like him – but he at least felt a bit better with galleons in his pocket. He returned to the Leaky Cauldron, intent on paying John the barkeep for his room as soon as he saw him, and instead met a very anxious Draco Malfoy.
Harry shook his head. He couldn’t speak. Neville was crying, somewhere, behind him, at the foot of Hermione’s bed. At the feet of her corpse-
Whether Dudley had also got the memo remained to be seen – Harry’s cousin hadn’t been home when he arrived, likely out with his gang of bullies, and Harry had stayed in his room ever since. Small victories; the welcome he had received upon his return to Number 4 was quite awkward enough. Petunia had pursed her already pinched lips at him and then pointedly ignored him in favour of her magazine, and Vernon hadn’t seemed able to decide between being smug at Harry’s misfortune or furious that they hadn’t gotten rid of him for good. Ultimately though, they both let him be, and Harry was grateful. He felt stronger in the face of his aunt and uncle than he ever had before, thanks to his time at Hogwarts and the support of his friends and Narcissa, but he had no intention of testing that resolve against Vernon’s anger anytime soon. Even if the Dursleys didn’t know it, Harry’s wand was useless in the Muggle world until he came of age at 17, which made him defenceless. The thought made his skin crawl.
“A student has been Petrified,” Dumbledore announced sadly to the school at breakfast. “Colin Creevey is in the Hospital Wing, and will be cured as soon as Professor Sprout’s mandrakes have matured. Thank you.”
“Well,” Narcissa said when he was done. “It appears we have a trip to make. If I may know your relatives’ address I can apparate us there, and-”
“Then I think it’s time for bed,” said Tracey, standing up and resting her hands on her hips. “It’s been an awful day, I’d say. We could all use an early night.”
Luna rose from her chair, coming around behind Harry to wrap her arms securely around his neck. He sat there stiffly, trying not to shirk away from her crushing hold or the sloppy kiss she pressed into his cheek. "I don't know that any of us realized how deep your feelings ran, Harry, that's all. So, we'll work on it some more. We'll make it more you. By the time we're all finished, we'll have Draco bawling in your lap over Christmas pudding. Okay?"
To keep that mask in place, Harry sat in Deacon's office with his arms crossed and his expression unmoving. Every bit that perfect picture. Draco was at his side, also wearing a convincing façade. They had both decided that it would be best to present a united front. An unrepentant united front.
to love this insufferable arse? But, unfortunately, he had indeed signed a binding contract. If he didn't follow through, then he'd have to find a way to return the advance. A way that didn't involve taking money out of his parents' hands. "I can play stupid for you if that's what you what. I can play 'peasant' while you play 'pauper'. But you know you can't treat people like that in normal life, right?" Harry stepped closer into the kitchen, feeling weirdly awkward and unconfident in his stockinged feet. "Even if you are paying them…."
Everything worth something to Scorpius was 'The Best'. Among the things that made the list were strawberry ice cream, bumblebees, crunchy leaves, and the silly way his shoes squeaked on the linoleum floor.
"Well, what is it that I can help with, then? And what does that have to do with the famous Harry Potter?"
Harry nodded slowly and found where his luggage had been placed in a corner of the bedroom. He was nearly ashamed of the relief which lightened his footsteps. "Can I at least know what I've done wrong?"
. He was being played like a well-tuned violin. (Or, perhaps, something less graceful like a tuba?) And it was just so easy to let it happen…. Especially when those lips tasted so decadently of icing sugar and the ghostly tang of raw ginger.
But the ache in his head was too insistent and the taste of bile on his tongue too obvious to ignore reality. Harry opened his eyes and took in the mildly-familiar flat. He'd only been here a handful of times, the ease of his own, empty house too perfect to pass up when they'd craved intimacy.
"You broke your contract," Draco managed in the small window that they broke for breath. His hands were heavy and searching, yanking Harry's shirt from his trousers. "Deacon knows by now. You're going to be off the case."
"I know I've said this before," Cheryl prefaced, and Draco had to bite his tongue to keep from rolling his eyes because he could quote word-for-word what she was about to say, "but I think that blurred line is feeding off your magic. It feels very much like the type of accidental magic often triggered in untrained young witches and wizards by strong emotions. So…subconsciously, you may be focusing and focusing and focusing on whatever it is you aren't getting in your day-to-day life from these dreams, right? And then you go to sleep at night and want them to be real…so they seem that way to you as if to appease you, perhaps?"
As much as it obviously pained Malfoy to see it, Harry had a point. Knowing he'd won even before he'd been told as much, Harry grinned and put a much more comfortable amount of space between them. "I'm not going anywhere, Draco," he stated just loud enough for any Peeping Toms to hear clearly. "So, you may as well sit down and start explaining what it is I'm even being accused of!"
In a severe lapse of common sense, he had forgotten to draw closed the curtains before falling into bed the night before. As it does every morning, the sun rose and did its thing — bright and intrusive through his east-facing window. Except, this morning, its harsh yellow was tempered by an unexpected, colourful barrier.
But Harry knew days like today helped. Every second Draco spent with that boy on his lap babbling to him about trains healed Draco in ways Harry never could. He could never be naïve enough to refuse to accept that.
Miraculously, it didn't take much convincing to get Deacon on board. Sure, he was a bit peeved that he hadn't been the one to see it, but he didn't try to convince them to change tactics. Within just a few minutes, Harry and Draco were rushing out of the office with a validated sense of purpose.
"Don't they wear robes at MACUSA?" Harry whispered, trying to lighten his own mood. He felt drastically overdressed near the man.
Pretending he hadn't heard Harry, Draco pushed up from his chair. He began gathering his things into his briefcase, making a quiet comment about the end of the day. About trying again in the morning. "We shouldn't tell Deacon until we're for certain," he hastened to add, his voice sounding panicked. The tremor of fear Harry was sure he saw in his slate eyes manifesting in the shake of his words.
The man was on his feet in two-seconds flat. He wasn't even bothering to hide his curiosity in Harry's presence anymore. "The Sentinel did say you've been wandering around MACUSA lately…. Any truth to the nasty, little rumors?"
The words echoed in Harry's mind. He frowned, closing his eyes to the pin-pricks of darkness clouding his vision.
Draco was wearing a tie, Harry had just noticed. A very silly tie. It was an iridescent gold color which suited his complexion miraculously. It made the silver of his eyes pop. But the silliness of the print – the playful little cats covering most of the fabric – almost wiped that fact away completely. The Draco he knew would never wear something so strange. But he was and he paired it with a perfectly tailored suit that just…completed him. Tiny cats and all.
The last thing Harry wanted was to come right out and say the thing he had been worrying himself sick over. If he invited that word into this conversation, it wouldn't leave, and he didn't want that on his hands. So, he thought back to the rest of what Draco had confessed to his "sleeping" form that night, drawing on the barest hint of his panic. "Do you really think I'm sickeningly naïve?"
This wasn't just a "thing" he had for Harry Potter (of all people, seriously). Back when they were teenagers, when he'd wake in the morning aching beneath the sheets with
He closed his eyes, breaths coming shaky and shallow from both the tears welling behind his lids and the memory now ingrained in his mind. Potter left him empty, lying beside him but still entangled by breath and limb. He caressed Draco wherever he could, almost to the point of overstimulation, but Draco wasn't about to complain. He wasn't about to give up even a second of being so close.
Ernie Macmillan could have been the one for Harry Potter. Potter said so himself to any interviewer who dared ask him in the first couple of months after their break-up. Ernie had been a vocal supporter of Potter since they were sixteen. He bravely fought at the Battle of Hogwarts (on the correct side, of course). He was a Hufflepuff
"You've had so many. It's perfectly understandable if you would forget one of their names now and then."
He wasn't exactly sure when it had happened, but somewhere along the way he started to need a map to life. Unfortunately he realized this much too late to have tried to find one. It felt like he was behind. Especially with Hermione being so ahead of things all the damn time.
"I hope you know you're lucky to have had such an experience." Malfoy looked down at his hands, picking at invisible dirt under his perfectly manicured fingernails. "I was not afforded such a luxury. As vulgar as it sounds, I was born for the singular purpose of breeding an heir, just like my father and my grandfather and those who came before them. I exist to continue a legacy."
It wasn't exactly a history. It wasn't like Teddy had done this time and time again. Three incidents didn't constitute a problem. Did it? Harry breathed heavily and long through his nose, a stream of smoke slipping into Charlie's sitting room. "You should have told me about these things. I have a right to know, even if you don't think it's important. He goes off to school soon and the
"You don't belong here," Abraxas rasped, delicately maneuvering his wheelchair across the room with just the tilt of a finger. Even in his fragile state, he was menacing. "How much money will it take to make you leave and never come back?"
"I feel like you're looking for an excuse to leave me…and I don't want to give you one. I don't want to be the one to make up your mind…."
Malfoy did not take the spot indicated for him until he had replaced every bit of clothing shed the evening before. He looked ridiculous drowning in the shirt which had fit him so perfectly the night before. As he pulled himself back up onto the high bed, his trousers slipped down his hips, teasing a peek at the body which had been so adamantly denied to Harry. Malfoy compensated by tugging his too-long shirt down more and wrapping his stolen blanket around his shoulders. "Well, then?" he snapped. He was grumpy and it was downright adorable.
Mostly in spite of Hermione, Harry did exactly the opposite of what he should have. He went home, as he said he would. But once he was there, the words wouldn't come. He took one look at Draco curled up in a chair in the library, soft and delicate, and pushed all of his worries to the side again. Not permanently...just for that moment. He needed to be able to see Draco in the light for just a bit longer...
Draco nodded; he already knew how Shea felt. The man just kept repeating it over and over again like he couldn't believe this was happening. His reason for disbelief was far saner than Draco's was. "Teddy needs more stability than that. And since I am the one to have brought them to this situation, it really is only fair to offer a solution." He had said this what seemed like a thousand different ways in the span of only a few hours.
"I took him there. To our place. To our little forest. I don't know why. He was freaking out over our case and…I didn't know what else to do. I didn't know where else to go. I needed him to calm down and I couldn't think of any place more peaceful. And I…." Draco sighed. "I fucked up. Once he was there…he tainted it. He tainted that place."
Neither man spoke for a good minute. They sipped at their glasses of more-than-expensive scotch, eyes narrowed but otherwise outwardly silent about the seemingly shocking occurrence of their prized heir holding hands with another man. Ignorance truly did seem to be bliss.
, he thought, but shook that notion away on a shiver. He had no doubt, having met that ice-cold woman, that if she'd truly had her way there would have been no 'nearly'.
Harry chuckled softly, stepping back and putting head-clearing distance between them once more. His cheeks were tinged with a soft shade of pink as he reached up to muss his hair. "S-sure," he stuttered and Draco would swear he'd managed to make the man flustered, just for a second, as a moment later he morphed back into his confident self, wearing a cheeky grin. "But only if you promise not to do that weird flailing thing you attempted earlier. I can't be seen with you like that. I do have an image to uphold, you know."
"Can you just get to the point, Deacon?" Draco eventually snapped, just before Harry was ready to do the same. "Are you kicking Potter off the case or not?"
"You know, Harry," Ron approached, his tone cautious, "that bloke a couple doors down from me asked about you again…."
Hermione's brow furrowed. "But nothing. Are you expecting me to tell you I believe Malfoy would do something like that?"
He hadn't slept since. How could he when he knew sleep brought the dreams? And how could he even compare those dreams to the actual reality he'd experienced? When he'd had the real thing, how could the dreams ever again be enough?
There was a life on the line outside of their intimate space. A life both men severely cared about. But if they acknowledged that in very real standards – by breaking whatever this moment was – that only made it all the more real. Teddy could be dying. Or already dead. Whatever the outcome, he would be irreparably scarred in uncountable ways.
The dial tone still ringing in his ear, Harry cradled the phone and set it back on his nightstand. In its stead, he grabbed the framed picture of his parents that could easily be regarded as his most prized possession. Moving to London meant missing them more than anything. He visited still; at least they were only a few hours away. But train fare was hard to afford without an income. And he supposed he could call them more…. But talking to them over the phone only made his heart ache worse.
The strange strangulation that had only just subsided filled the air in a heated instant. Harry found himself unable to hold eye contact with either of his friends, their gazes each carrying an uncomfortable weight. More than likely, what was about to be shared had something to do with the fight he had walked into.
Despite the situation, Harry found a smile tugging at his lips so wide it almost hurt. “Yeah. Yeah, I will. See you soon.”
Harry examined him with a cautious eye. He had a lot of questions – what Theo had said to get Hermione looking relaxed after her tearfulness earlier, how Theo had known what to say, why he had even cared – but none of that, if Harry was honest, was really his business.
Blaise had gone still. He and Draco were staring at each other across the table, identical looks of realisation on their faces.
They made their way down a narrow, darkened corridor to the boys’ dorms. As they were only a small year, all the first year boys would be in the same dorm, and the first year girls were the same. Since Harry and Draco were the first up to the dorm, they were able to have first pick of the beds. Draco immediately claimed the bed at the end of the room, farthest from the door, and Harry picked the one beside it. There was a small porthole-like window above his dresser, looking out into the darkness of the Lake. Harry touched a hand to the cool glass, and smiled slightly to himself.
Number 4, Privet Drive did not look like the Hell Harry remembered it as. There were no bars on the window; no signs of unhappiness save for the slight drooping of the tulips in Petunia’s garden. Harry had always been the one to take care of them – he felt just a little better, seeing them beginning to wither. It was a sign that Harry had been there. That he had been of use – of value.
Gemma found their plight particularly hilarious, and would often lean over the shoulders of the first years to remind them that they hadn’t seen anything yet – just wait until O.W.L.’s, not to mention N.E.W.T.’s. This had the desired effect: hyperventilation for Tracey and wide, terrified eyes for everyone else.
“As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realised – a student has been taken by the monster, into the Chamber itself.” McGonagall dipped her head as the staff murmured in distress. “I’m afraid we shall have to send the students home. I’m afraid… this is the end of Hogwarts.”
“Shut up!” Blaise ordered, before turning to look Harry directly in the eye. “Remember to breathe, Harry.”
Harry thought, and held back a laugh as the majority of the first year Gryffindors took steps back, leaving Weasley with only three people as backup. Harry recognised them from the Sorting as Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, and Hope Fawcett. He couldn’t quite hold back a smirk as Fawcett suddenly realised where she was with a startled look, and took a small step back.
thing was a letter, which would not usually be out of place amongst the Dursleys’ mail except for the fact that to Harry’s shock, it was addressed to
Harry turned his attention back to the Slytherin Quidditch Captain. Marcus Flint was stalking down the line, inspecting the prospective players and taking down positions. One Chaser, Seeker, and two Beaters were needed to complete the line-up, and Flint appeared to be very serious about finding his perfect team. Flint wasn’t exactly known for his intelligence – there was even a rumour that he was part troll, which would certainly explain his massive, hulking stature. Harry thought he looked more like a Beater than a Chaser, but he had seen Flint play. He was deceptively fast in the air, and what he lacked in academic intelligence he made up with Quidditch strategy. He had also reached Harry in the line, and sneered down at him.
Draco leaned closer against, brow furrowed as he ran a hand along Harry’s back in comfort. “Well – we could go see the groundskeeper.”
“W-what do you want?” Longbottom stammered. Harry wondered if he was even capable of speaking clearly.
“Oh, Harry,” Neville interrupted quietly before Harry could ask his friend what was wrong. “Um, I thought you might want to know – Fred and George and Ginny are on your side.”
Harry watched her for only a moment before going back to his own text. Perhaps Hermione would turn out to be rather
Harry was only half paying attention to Daphne’s show. He couldn’t help but need to remind himself, over and over as he looked at Hermione and Theo, that they weren’t actually dead. They just looked so still and pale, and their skin was so cold…
The dazzling scarlet light of the disarming charm exploded from Snape’s wand, crashing into Lockhart and blasting him off his feet and into the far wall.
“Of course I’m alive, honestly, I should be saying that to you!” She pulled back from him again, and her eyes were wet. “Going into the Chamber, I mean how foolish! I thought Slytherins were supposed to have self-preservation.”
Little Harry got no sleep that night, so focussed was he on practising with his new ability. He did not think up a name for this ability, but he very carefully avoided the word ‘
Blaise jumped off of his desk gracefully and moved towards the door. “I’m not sure yet,” he said. “But I get the feeling you need it.”
