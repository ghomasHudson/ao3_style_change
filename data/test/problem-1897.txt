"It'll be okay. I'm going to take care of it."
"I... really good. I slept really good," he said. His hand had moved towards Harry's face on it's own accord, though he stopped it midair. "Can I..." he trailed off.
"And when he does, I hope we are prepared for it."
Harry seemed to fall asleep quickly, but Draco had stopped paying attention to the time. Eventually, he started to think about what Harry would think in the morning. This was a ridiculous situation, and surely Harry would hate him for it in the morning. But Draco couldn't bring himself to let him go yet.
"You did well. I am glad I entrusted my task to you." Voldemort's voice hissed around him. Disgust ate at Harry. He was the reason McGonagall had died, and now Snape was the headmaster. He mourned her death, but he would take it over Draco's.
The pain stopped, leaving Harry shaking and sobbing on the ground, arms and legs still twitching from the effects. He distantly heard shrill laughing coming from all around him.
"I'm Malfoy. Draco, Malfoy." The boy said. He held his hand out across the stool.
Harry's glare soon withered. Something compelled him to drop his gaze, before he angrily put his chin back up and walked further into the room. He paid no attention to a confused Draco, trailing behind him as he silently berated himself for acting like he did when he had been this small. He was not an intimidated, meek child.
One argument broke out in the corner, concerning how many bat eyes needed to be added after a certain amount of rotations, and about how that particular Gryffindor was a 'moronic sack of shit who would never amount to anything if they couldn't even read a textbook'. The professor hurried over and sent the boys out, and returned a moment later murmuring about how 'this house unity project was doomed into the dirt from the start'.
"You've done well, Lucius. You two may leave, I will summon you later," Voldemort dismissed Lucius and Draco. Lucius stood quickly, and began to walk out. Draco hesitated a moment, confused as to why Harry was being left with the most terrifying man Draco had ever met. He quickly followed his father, who was looking at him harshly for slowing down.
A white light shimmered at the tip of his wand, before it sputtered and died. Lupin stepped in front of him, turning the boggart into some sort of orb. Harry wobbled on his feet, his eyes prickling.
Harry gave a choked scream as they closed down around his arm, dripping poison.
Huffing, Harry pushed his glasses up his nose for what seemed to be the umpteenth time since they began their walk through the twisting stone hallways. That was something Professor Slughorn had forgotten to shrink, unfortunately. Harry considered taking them off, but considering how poorly he was adjusting to walking with tiny legs, he didn't want to make his probability of staying upright even lower. He just wished he didn't have to push them up every few seconds.
"Clumsy." Harry refused to look at her. Instead, he stared resolutely at a crack on the spotless white tile floor.
"How'd he get here?"
He exploded.
She nodded at him, her eyes softening a little. "Merlin knows what's happening to him right now. I gave him a potion, it should keep him asleep. A little extra sleep never hurt anyone," Madam Pomfrey sighed heavily giving Draco the feeling she was more worried about Potter than she let on.
"What house do you think you'll get?" The boy prompted, seeming a little impatient already. Harry narrowed his eyes a little, unsure if he should keep talking to him.
Harry sat on the Hogwarts Express, alone. The station was nearly abandoned. He was two hours early, after all. Vernon couldn't have been more excited to get him away. Now, it was just him and his newly named owl, Hedwig.
Draco paused. Harry hadn't even set his fork down from dinner. It was the first time either of them had spoken in at least twenty minutes.
Harry stumbled out of the room and to the dungeons. As he was passing the Great Hall, he ran into Draco, who ran after him, grabbing his arm.
"It is when someone splits their soul into pieces, and puts that piece into something else. I made some of these horcruxes so that I would live forever. Do you see yet, Harry?" Voldemort sounded angry now, but Harry was more confused than he had been before.
"You can't tell me anything?"
People screamed as the chain holding the Hungarian Horntail broke. Cedric Diggory, the Hogwarts champion, leaped towards a rock to cover, not knowing that the dragon had been angered by a powerful curse that had been cast into its backside and not Diggory's transfigured dog.
blinked up at him. Harry pulled away from him, ears turning red. Part of Draco wanted to pull him closer and make sure he was safe, but that was inappropriate and they would both regret that once this whole business was through.
Sirius jumped on him and licked his cheek. Hermione did her custom cleaning and trimming charms and gave him the leftovers of their meal at the Three Broomsticks. Sirius, happy, put his paws on Harry's shoulders and licked his face. Harry had started crying and hadn't realized.
Harry blinked at him for a minute. "It's a... school... for magic," Harry said slowly, nodding along with his words. Draco's worry subsided somewhat, but the bruise staring him in the face wouldn't let him relax completely.
Draco held it in his hand for a moment. This might have fixed Harry completely before everything had happened. It might be completely useless now.
"Look, this isn't how I want this to go. I don't want someone that hates me sleeping next to me. So we can sort this out now, or you can sleep with your eyes open the rest of the year," Harry threatened him. Malfoy glared at him.
Draco leaped for the entrance, barely containing a shriek as he slid on the rough, dirty slope. A large tree branch missed his face by centimeters.
"Thank you, Headmaster."
Everything was going to be fine, because Harry was okay. Harry was
"Well... the Sorting Hat tried to make me a Slytherin, but I didn't want to," Harry said slowly, "but I convinced it to put me somewhere else. I didn't think I'd be very good in Slytherin, so it ended up putting me in Gryffindor," Harry finished, nodding. He gave Draco a small smile.
you? Why do you know me? Why do you care?" Harry turned around to look at him, accidentally making his broom swerve to the left. Harry quickly straightened himself before someone ahead thought to check on him.
"Lay him down, Mr. Malfoy," Madam Pomfrey said, already casting diagnostic charms before Draco had laid him down. He hovered close by, wanting to reach out, hold him and make sure he was okay, but Pomfrey's work was more important.
"BELLA!" The person next to her shouted. Harry assumed it was one of the other Lestranges, he didn't care to keep track of them, but by the time they had whirled around to curse him Harry already had a
"The troll..." Harry sighed.
Harry's eyes widened, his wand jumping into his hand even as Voldemort raised his own wand. "Avada Kedavra."
"It's like that. Like I'm about to faint constantly. I hear these... they sound like screams, when I'm near them." Harry let himself lean on Hermione's shoulder, who wrapped her arm around him. Harry took comfort in it. He hardly had affection, this felt nice. Even Snuffles seemed to be trying to comfort him.
And yet, when the black dog trotted up to him with a smile Harry didn't know what to say.
Harry was back to normal. And snuggling him.
Harry nodded, watching him closely. Draco touched his face as softly as he could, feeling like if he pressed too hard Harry would vanish. But he was solid, and
And then suddenly, the hall was quieter than Harry had ever heard it. He had expected a reaction, but nothing like this. He walked confidently up to the stool, able to hear his footsteps over the faint murmurs of the students. Hagrid gave him a wide smile as he walked up, which Harry returned.
Harry climbed atop the broom and zoomed throughout the chamber. Eventually, he located a key that seemed to move slower than the others. It was larger, and looked older. Harry shot after it, though the key seemed to know it had been spotted.
"Alright Potter, no need to get your knickers in a twist," Draco murmured, rolling his eyes. He came to the bottom of the staircase, leaning against the railing. "Look, Professor Dumbledore sent me a letter. He wants us to... talk, I guess. See if there's anything big that you don't remember, I guess."
"What is?"
everything would be under control if things got out of hand.
"What food did you get for him?"
"Why, Hadrian, is that you? What happened to you, boy?" Sir Mercy leaned forward, concerned.
as Draco's arms wrapped around him.
His wand trembled in his hand, spinning several times before settling. He followed it until it was pointing directly at the base of a tree. Draco put it away, crouching and squinting. In the growing light, he could see it. A hole, mostly obscured by swaying branches and leaves, a small overhead cover made by its twisting roots.
Professor Slughorn chuckled a little sheepishly. “I may have forgot to mention that injuries sustained at that particular time do return. As this potion does not simply change your features, it changes your entire body chemistry from a year's time. This includes maturity through puberty, hair, height, scars, and so on.” Slughorn smiled bashfully, as if forgetting that he didn’t tell the class that an assignment had been pushed back. “Now that we have that out of the way...would anyone else like to volunteer?”
Professor Snape paused. "The potion was made in a similar fashion to
Harry sat on the couch in front of the sandwiches, taking another as tea appeared next to the plate. "Do we 'ave to?" He asked, mouth full of sandwich.
Draco called out into the empty room. "Madam Pomfrey?"
A moment later, Harry now had clothes that at least stayed up on him. Draco thought the mini-Hogwarts uniform was a bit daft, but what could Draco do? He could laugh at the fool, just as he was.
"See if it fits," Harry urged. Draco slipped the silver band around his right ring finger, fitting it snugly. The single silver gem shone in the moonlight, twinkling blue in some facets.
Draco stared at Harry for a long time, though he never looked up from his plate. Draco realized Harry knew about the teeth, knew that they were wrong. Really, how
"How do you feel?"
and it didn't mean that Harry was being
Draco set the alarms again, quietly walking into his room. His arithmancy essay was left abandoned, his quill on the floor and his textbook was half off his desk. He straightened his things, setting his essay to the side and pulling out a piece of paper. It was rather late now, about the time Draco would usually headed to bed.
"Up the staircase, on th- on the left." Draco watched her walk up, Harry floating precariously behind her. Draco flinched the smallest bit when it seemed like Harry would hit his head on the railing or wall, but he made it up unscathed.
"Would you like a dreamless sleep potion, Mr. Malfoy?" Madam Pomfrey asked.
But that was Harry with the mind of a child. That wasn't the Harry that was almost an adult, that had hated him for years. Draco didn't think one person could change him so much, but Draco wanted to be better for Harry. Wanted Harry to accept him and be as close as his Gryffindor friends.
Draco waited, but as Harry remained unconscious and no shimmer covered him, Draco found his heart leaping into his throat, choking him. "Dinky!" He called, standing with Harry tight in his arms. The little elf popped up with a smile. "Hospital Wing!" He barked. Dinky jumped, taking his hand.
"You can go back to flying when you're done," Draco told him, worried Harry thought he was taking the broom away permanently. Harry gave him a bright smile, and bounded out of his seat once he had finished eating.
"It was just... on his face this morning. I couldn't think of anything that could have caused it, I was with him the whole night, but Professor Slughorn mention that -"
Was the thing that did that
"They don't get to talk much, so they like to have a conversation once in awhile. They appreciate it a lot," Harry said, picking at the skin around his fingernails. "Just... it's nice to be nice. Not that you'd really care about that, Malfoy."
"I don't want to be enemies. Can we respect each other enough to work together?" Harry held out his hand. Malfoy stared at it for a second, unsure. Eventually he shook it, slowly.
Madam Pomfrey made a
Harry let him crouch in front of him, Draco was glad to notice. He held out the potion. "It's just to help you get some of the nourishment that you need. Then you can eat. Madam Pomfrey just said to take it before breakfast. It's okay." Draco felt awkward and clunky crouching like this, having no idea of what to do. But Harry had stopped trembling and had taken the potion from his hand, so he thought he was doing alright.
"Yes, I suppose. I did want to check out a book on magical aquatic creatures. A new girl in my dorm, Luna, said something about the giant squid last night and I haven't been able to get it off my mind," Hermione quickly gathered her things, glancing up at Harry as she did so.
Harry laughed into his chest, leaning into the hand Draco had curled into his hair. "Ron and Hermione are going to go off their rockers."
Harry loved Hogsmead. They had already visited a Quidditch shop, and Harry had almost bought the new Firebolt on a whim, but he didn't have nearly enough money. Not on him, at least. Harry had discovered how much he had loved flying this past summer, though he wasn't going to tell Hermione exactly why.
Well, he didn't need both of them. But he had to admit, he was curious. "Both." It was probably some silly nickname, like how his own parents called him 'Dragon' in private. If nothing else, it might be decent blackmail for later, if it was embarrassing enough.
He worked diligently, Hermione sitting next to him working on the same essay. She wouldn't be assigned it until tomorrow, when her Ravenclaw/Gryffindor class would first have Snape's class. But that never stopped Hermione from wanting to get a jump on the homework. Harry sometimes wished his work ethic was like Hermione's, but maybe one day he'd get there.
Either way, he trusted Dumbledore to keep them safe. At the very least, he would do anything to keep
Draco made sure Harry was out of sight before he turned back to Severus, eyebrows raised. Severus' face was grim and a hand rubbed his chin in thought. "It's worse than I expected," was all he said. Draco needed more than that.
Madam Pomfrey held up a hand, silencing him and his whirling thoughts. "Please drink this first," she held out a bottle to him. He sat up a little to take it, grimacing.
He lifted the covers gently, slipping underneath them. He was close enough to count Draco's eyelashes, but he hung off the edge of the bed, afraid to touch him.
They walked back into the house, dirty, muddy, and sweaty, declaring they would both be trying out for the Quidditch team next year.
"Leave us." He commanded the Death Eaters who had been silent. They left quickly and just as quietly. Harry wanted to look back to catch Draco's eye, but he didn't dare. "I think you have proved yourself, Harry. Taking initiative the way you have. I think it is time I trusted you more."
was heard.
Harry frowned a bit. "Will you get my clothes? I don't want to go..."
"You will fly, tonight, to Azkaban. You will attack it's walls, and free my followers. Pettigrew, you'll have the extra brooms hanging from your own, do not lose them," Voldemort spoke softly, a snake winding around his arm. It hadn't been there when Harry began his second year, but the few times he'd seen it over the summer it refused to talk to him. He seemed more attached to it than seemed normal, but... was anything ever normal?
clothes. But they were soft and comfy, and he liked them. Now he just had to wait for all the people to show up. He wondered if he'd manage to get a cart by himself. He wasn't sure, but he didn't know how many kids went to Hogwarts, so maybe there was a chance. Though, judging by how big the cart was, he didn't think it would happen.
"I'm fine, sir. May I go to the hospital wing?" Harry asked, already inching towards the door.
Draco looked at him sideways. Harry wiped the corner of his mouth with a napkin and sat back. "No one trusts Dumbledore right now. Everyone is scared. If it could go that bad during a task that was supposed to be super careful, couldn't things go wrong in classes? Does that mean that the school is badly protected and some of the escaped Death Eaters could come attacking at any moment?"
"Dinky, if you would please take these young men to their rooms," Dumbledore said with a smile. He adjusted Harry in his arms, freeing the hand that was holding the bag of potions.
Draco's mind was going a little haywire. He would've been dorm-mates with Potter this whole time, if he hadn't convinced the hat otherwise. Bloody hell, he convinced the blasted Sorting Hat to put him somewhere else! That was one of the most Slytherin-things he had ever heard. This was... this was interesting.
Dinky popped back into the room, once again startling Harry. Draco didn't notice how quiet he had been until he realized he only moved when he had been startled. He was...oddly still and quiet for a young child. Bloody hell, he was too quiet for any one. Draco kept forgetting he was even there. That might've been due to the anger, though.
"Harry?" As the man spoke, he crawled forward to the edge of his cell, one hand on the broken brick.
Harry nodded slowly, not letting go.
"How do you feel? Any pain? Discomfort?" Professor Slughorn rocked back and forth, running his eyes over Harry to check for any immediate signs of fatal danger.
Draco bumped into a wall as he turned the corner. He didn't care. His mind was on a loop of Harry. How long had he been passed out? How long had they had Harry? What were they doing to him?
"Draco Malfoy. I don't recognize you, what's your surname?"
Harry glared at his eggs. "A really mean teacher," he grumbled. Draco dropped his fork, making Harry look up and lose his glare. "Draco?"
"Bombarda! Depulso! Confringo! Diffindo! Flipendo! Bombarda! Depulso!"
Dudley ran at him, and Harry wound up his fist. He swung, and put as much force behind it as he could. As he collided with Dudley's nose, he felt something...
Draco lowered Harry's shirt and stroked his hair. Closing his eyes and breathing heavily through his nose, Draco tried to control his rage so he didn't lash out against Harry. He focused on the rhythm of Harry's breathing, a steady rise and fall that had him calm in minutes. Harry shifted a little closer to him, somehow, making Draco smile just a little.
"Your father, Sirius, and Pettigrew were all Animagi. Your father could turn into a stag, Peter a rat, and Sirius a grim."
Harry winced. Draco stilled, and lifted his hand. Wondering if he had hurt him, Draco slowly lifted the back of Harry's shirt to look where his hand had been.
"How did he get the bruise?"
He found Harry stumbling towards the bathroom, tears and blood running down his face. Draco's heart leaped into his chest, but Harry had run into him and wrapped his tiny arms around his waist before he could get a proper look.
"Would you like to explain why it is my fault instead of trying to kill me out of the corner of your eye?" Harry murmured, a sigh heavy on his lips and eyebrow quirked in question.
"Hey, you can talk to me Harry," Draco whispered, wincing again when Harry stiffened at his name.
"Dumbledore, the
"The basilisk is created through a chicken egg that was hatched beneath a toad, and though by no means does this make them extinct, the last recorded basilisk was a baby owned by known parselmouth, Salazar Slytherin, co-founder of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry," Hermione finished.
Draco frowned again, now holding a child's pepper-up potion. "What happened? Did you do something?"
"GRYFFINDOR!"
, but it needed to be soon.
"You can use my first name Harry. It's Sirius. Or Snuffles, if you're more comfortable with that."
Harry went to his four-poster bed, seeing his trunk at the bottom of it. He noticed a moment later, that his bed was next to Draco Malfoy's, unfortunately. On Harry's other side was Theodore Nott, and the other three beds were occupied by Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe.
They had both gotten firebolts, though Harry had no idea whose his was from. They flew in the Malfoy's backyard, as they had as vigorously as the summer. Though this time they raced for fun, not out of fear of being punished.
Harry eventually decided to lay down, pondering at when Madam Pomfrey would be back. He fell asleep soon after.
The little elf popped up merrily. "What can I be doing for Master Malfoy sirs!"
complain about Voldemort not being around often. Then he wouldn't be forced to kneel as often.
He had to write Snape first, but he was looking forward to his shower.
"Thank you," Draco said, "thank you for everything." He kissed Harry's nose. "Thank you," his cheek, "thank you," his forehead, "thank you," his lips. Harry grabbed his face, holding him away.
"'Mione, do you know any cleaning spells that are good for dogs? Seems like he could use a bath and maybe a brush, don't you think?" Harry watched the mutt eat with a smile on his face. The dog's ears perked up in interest a bit, but he seemed too interested in the meat.
"Thank you, Mr. Potter. If you do not mind, I would like to speak to Mr. Malfoy alone for a minute?" Harry was gone before Professor Snape had finished speaking. He didn't scare Harry like Uncle Vernon did, but he never did like being around adults.
They stopped at a closed door at the end of the hallway. It opened with a horrible creaking, though Harry could see no one in the doorway. Once in the room, Harry was dropped on the rough floor. Crying out, Harry backed himself into a corner, wincing at the splinters that had hurt his hand.
After a moment, Harry nodded. "I'm ready."
"Potter, Malfoy, stay." Professor Moody grunted. Sharing a glance, they walked to his desk with their supplies. Moody waited until all other students had left before casting what Harry recognized as privacy charms on the doors. Harry squeezed Draco's arm behind their bags, where Moody couldn't see.
Harry snorted. "You think those things are going to stop a dog? They don't even speak. They're here to make sure some stupid Death Eaters don't try and commit suicide by attacking Hogwarts," Harry said, grabbing his broom.
"Perhaps you'll remember to count them yourself next time, as is recommended when working with another person," Harry quipped. Draco began to seethe as he realized Potter was hardly giving this any attention! As if this was some first year project and not a potion that would certainly end up as part of their exam! Potter didn't even have the decency to act like he cared! The insolent prick!
He shined the light to the vines around him, and they shrunk away. He made a path out for himself, looking down the dark hallway ahead of him. He turned back to the Devil's Snare, seeing a vine moving towards his ankle.
A tall, black building rose in the distance. Harry hoped that was what they were looking for, after so many miles of ocean. He hated what they were about to do. Harry had thought of sabotaging the mission, using the numerous offensive spells he had learned, but it would be too suspicious. Voldemort would hardly trust him if only he, Draco, and a few others returned.
Harry turned, seeing Hermione looking at a shaggy old dog that stood on the other side of the wide path, almost hidden in the shade of a tree. Harry thought it was staring at him.
He cast a
Of course Harry would be fine. He was
"Yes Sirs!"
Draco laughed a bit, surprising himself and Harry. He shook his head, pouring himself another cuppa. "I might come to like Hagrid a bit."
Draco had barged in the door before he finished speaking, hands red and raw from the wood of the door. Dumbledore raised a hand, but Draco was already in front of him and speaking in a panic.
Draco rushed out of his room, grabbing the package hastily on his way out. Harry was in the kitchen, holding a bowl so tightly his knuckles were white and looking fearfully at Draco.
that he noticed.
There weren't any spells that did what Harry needed them to do. He was more disappointed than he thought he'd be. His heart wasn't made of stone, after all. When Hermione finally gave up, it was lunch time, and Harry had a lesson with Professor Lupin afterwards.
"No he wasn't." Harry knew that. Lucius had ranted for a whole day about the Daily Prophet. They had released a list of known Death Eaters that had escaped Azkaban, Sirius Black being on that list. Even Narcissa had flinched at some of the words he had used to describe the
"The potion changes the takers body chemistry to the time off... so whatever injuries he's sustained will continue to appear as his body changes as the potion says." Severus cut him off. Draco felt a little slighted, but that was likely do to his anxiety.
An uncomfortable cough came from Professor Slughorn. "Ah...Mr. Potter?" Harry looked up at the man, who thought that with eyes such as those, well, one could get anything they desired. "Are you quite alright? Can you speak?"
Fleur was crying. Her sister's charm had apparently failed, and she had drowned without the professors noticing until Fleur had surfaced with her body, and she hadn't woken up.
"Wait, you nee-" Harry dropped the fork and leaped away from the table and was at the doorway before the fork finished clattering. Draco, frozen, watched as Harry trembled. He stood from his seat and grabbed the green potion. "You just... need to take this first, is all. Madam Pomfrey's orders." Draco said slowly. When Harry didn't move, he approached carefully, making sure that Harry could see his hands.
"Where is the
Draco stood still as a statue even as Dinky popped away. "Mr. Malfoy, why don't you put Mr. Potter in bed and take your potions? I won't take long."
"I have found some traces of my own magical signature and darker ones. It came back with a more specific area than I thought it would. They have not moved him far. Currently he is near Hogsmeade and the forest that runs along its edge, around a kilometer in each direction."
"What...what do you want from me?"
knows what they really are." Draco watched Harry, a smug smirk on his face. Harry nodded slowly, then stood up.
Harry changed into his robes. They felt weird, nothing like...
Every few days Draco tried to get Harry to do magic, though it was still completely unsuccessful. Harry always felt horrible after, thinking he had disappointed Draco, but he bounced back to his happy self quicker each time.
"M'sorry, I messed it all up," he mumbled.
Harry wanted more info about the man. He needed more than what he knew from that short ride with the man.  Sirius had said that he didn't deserve to go to Azkaban, that it wasn't his fault. He had rambled for five minutes, about dementors and something called a secret keeper, about the name Pettigrew and thirteen people. Harry hadn't understood most of it, but he was a little nervous to question a man who was behind him on a broom two hundred feet in the air.
It was just Krum left. The projection returned on the cup. The crowd was almost silent until movement could be seen in a corner. In a moment, people were on their feet, crying out and shouting as Krum raced towards the cup, a large spider in his tracks. Draco grabbed Harry's hand tightly. Harry held his breath as Krums fingers just barely grazed the handle.
Once everyone had gathered and was sitting in conjured chairs -Draco in the middle, slumping and looking down to avoid looks from his professors- Dumbledore began to explain. He was far too calm, far too put together.
"Would anyone else like to volunteer before I hand pick?" Less hands were raised this time. "Hmmm...Ms. Greengrass, why don't you come up?"
"You couldn't possibly expect to know the surname of every wizard in Britain," Hermione scoffed, laughing a little. Draco raised an eyebrow, a sneer coming to his face.
Draco almost cried.
"Okay...okay, yeah," he took the potion, holding it delicately. "Why didn't you have a house-elf bring it this time?"
He laughed almost hysterically as he free fell, before he easily regained control, diving to the ground. It came closer and closer, until he was forced to pull up at the very last moment. His foot skidded across the ground as he flew level. He did two laps around the pitch, letting him momentum carry him as he leisurely flew. Harry eventually slowed, and came to an easy stop.
Hermione furrowed her brow and skimmed the rest of the page. "It doesn't say. There's probably a book on it somewhere though," she snapped the book shut, eyes roaming the shelves. "But, we have to tell the professors. Now that we know what it is, they can do something about it, can't they?"
"Hermione Granger?"
"What's your name?" The boy called out as Harry stepped off the stool.
The dog -
Hermione shrugged, still smiling. "Maybe we could call him Hagrid! Or Fang, after his dog?"
"While the lethal qualities of this creature and it's inability to be domesticated by anyone who does not have the ability to speak parseltongue has given it a Dangerous Creature Rating of XXXXX, it's gaze is not always deadly. By indirect eyesight (ex. locking eyes through a mirror) will cause petrification, or freezing of the victim's body.
Madam Pomfrey softened her stare, but only slightly. "Mr. Potter, you realize this is a safe area. You will not be harmed here," she said quietly. Harry refused to look at her.
When he woke up, it was to quiet voices. He sat up, rubbing his eyes and looking at the fuzzy figures. He reached around for his glasses, before they were gently put in his hand. He gave a small smile as suddenly Madam Pomfrey and Professor Dumbledore came into a...somewhat focus.
"Let's go see."
Draco looked at him like he was a madman. "What's going on?" He demanded. Harry took a deep breath and felt...excited, for the first time in years.
"Umbridge needs to go."
"Oh, you know we probably won't see him again, Harry," Hermione said sadly, rubbing the dog behind his ears.
Umbridge didn't last another week. Food poisoning turned sour, she had left for st. Mungo's and wasn't expected to return the rest of the year. An Auror took her place. It was basically the same, minus the detentions. But Harry didn't care about that. She was gone, and Draco was suspicious but happy, and that was the important part.
, Draco thought. Harry had finished his cup-licking it clean- and snuggled into Draco's side, one arm clutching his torso and the other holding Snuffles.
Harry glared at him. "Yes, I know where the shower is, thanks," he snapped. He stormed out of the room and into the hallway, leaving Draco sitting on the bed.
"I know all the important ones. You're probably a Mudblood, then." Draco turned his head away from her, making a display of wiping the hand he had shook.
"Yes sirs!" She said, next to Draco in a moment and holding out her little hand. Draco almost grabbed it, but an uneasy feeling settled in his stomach. He paused, feeling nauseous. Madam Pomfrey must have seen something in his demeanor change.
"Longbottom, Neville!"
He looked back down at Harry, realizing he had stopped stroking his hair. Resuming, Draco sighed. This wouldn't last much longer, he knew. Snape would have the potion ready before he realized it, and Harry would be back to normal, and then... he would be gone. This whole... this whole part of his life would be over.
"Mr. Malfoy, he's been put under some mild sleeping charms, I'm going to leave them for now so he doesn't wake up and panic. We'll discuss the rest of his condition once Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor Snape arrive. I'm going to go contact them, stay here with him."
Dumbledore nodded thoughtfully. He didn't comment on the dragons further. "Harry, tell me, what are the types balls used in Quiddich and what do they do?" He asked instead. Harry thought that was a weird question. Or at least, he did, until he began having difficulty answering.
Harry coughed. "I can speak," His voice was quiet, high pitched and slightly shrill.
"No."
"Us."
"Professor, that's really not necessar-"
"You're okay."
"Professor, are we going to have our lesson today?"
Severus stood after a few moments of silence, approaching the floor. "I will start the antidote today, but there is no guarantee it will work, Draco."
Her assistant almost fainted as he walked out of the store.
"He's angry." Draco said suddenly from his bed. Harry poked his head around his post to look at him.
"Now that the vermin is gone... what were you doing with her, Potter? We're better than that." Draco brushed off his robes where Hermione had pushed him, and took the seat she had occupied, while Blaise continued to lean against the wall.
They walked in, absorbing the cozy room. It seemed to be a common room of sorts, with a large fireplace, chairs couches and tables in hues of browns and whites. Draco heard the portrait close behind him, walking further in. Harry went down a small hallway, which opened into a humble kitchen with simple necessities. A door in the hallway lead to a bathroom, Draco found.
"I'm not leaving him," he said. "I'll have a house-elf bring my school work and anything else I need, but I don't want to leave. Please."
Harry received a punch in the arm, but it was worth it.
The horns were far too merry for the situation, in Harry's opinion.
Harry slept for most of the day, only waking up for dinner and falling asleep again not long after. Draco took his dreamless sleep potion, holding Harry close. Harry held his stuffed dog. The time passed easily, though they hardly spent any of it in the sitting room. It was an unspoken agreement that they moved their lounging time to Harry's room, though Harry still used the entire space when he flew on his broom.
He went downstairs, noticing a nice breakfast with toast and bacon already set up for them. A small tray with a few potions and containers sat on the edge of the corner. Finding a note, Draco found himself worrying even more.
The troll wobbled, and fell over. Harry darted pasted and closed the door behind him, realizing how nice the clean air was now that he had it. He took a moment to gather himself once he realized there was no immediate danger.
Madam Pomfrey came down a moment later, giving him a stern look. "I want him resting for the night. If anything happens to him, I want to know immediately. I suggest you put some alarm spells on him in case something happens while you're asleep," she narrowed her eyes at him a small bit as she grabbed Dinky's hand, "you do know such spells, don't you?"
The next few minutes were spent in silence. Harry never realized how far the hospital wing was from the potions classroom. Maybe it just felt farther, since he thought he was taking two and a half steps for every one of his normal ones. God, he hated this age.
Harry made a humming noise. The boy almost sounded like a family Hagrid had mentioned, one of the dark ones.
It took awhile, but eventually he found a book titled
"You can't do anything to m-"
. Eventually Madam Pomfrey was satisfied. "I would say you owe a very nice thank you card to Professor Snape, Mr. Potter," she said with a nod. "Do try and rest. Today is a Thursday, you aren't expected to start making up for your classes until Monday. I would visit the Headmaster soon." With that, she left behind the curtain and flicked it closed.
Dumbledore had lost his position as Chief Warlock and Headmaster of Hogwarts. He had vanished and hadn't been seen since he had made his ominous statement of "you are endangering them more than I ever could, Minister. And I will be doing more for this war than you ever will."
"I have no idea what you mean," Draco said, sniffing delicately.
Harry lifted the trap door. "Lumos." Devil's Snare, just as he had been told. He didn't know how Voldemort had known these things, but he hadn't been wrong yet. Harry, holding his breath, jumped down into the pit. The landing was soft, the vines creeping around him quicker than he had expected. "Lumos!"
Daphne screamed and fell to her knees. Professor Slughorn rushed to put a spell on her arm to keep it from moving, and gave her a small potion that seemed to be for numbing. He called over her desk partner quickly, and Parvati assisted her out of the room and into the hospital wing.
"He seems healthy. I... believe they may have hurt him in some way or another, but there were no physical wounds except the puncture marks from where the snake bit him. He's under mild sleeping charms, but I can't tell what mental damage may have occurred, but I did give him a calming and soothing drought. I expect he wasn't asleep the entire time, and I'm a little worried about possible trauma, especially at his mental age."
"I think so. Let's clean the poor thing before he starts moving, yeah?"
Smiling -he had been doing that so much lately- Draco shook his head. "It doesn't go any faste-"
"He threatened you, didn't he?"
, Snape." He exclaimed, breathing a bit heavier than he would like. He hadn't told anyone else about that, not even Draco. It was embarrassing, in a way, to know she had gotten the jump on him and he had to do something underhanded to get back at her.
"You... it's finished?"
Draco held out a hand for Dinky to take. She did so excitedly, almost vibrating with joy when Headmaster Dumbledore grabbed her other hand with a smile.
Sirius turned his head into the forest, and slinked into the darkness. He came out a moment later, now a tall, thin man. His hair was trimmed, his teeth cleaned, his skin a bit less dirty and himself a little less emancipated than when Harry had last seen him. As a human, that was.
Harry jerked as Draco grabbed him. "What?" He snapped, shaking his arm to get Draco off. Draco glared at him and held tighter.
Draco had been in the midst of arithmancy when Professor Vector's lecture had been cut off by the door opening.
Fawks nipped at Harry, who continued to pet the large bird, wondering what was wrong with him.
"Why don't we relax first? Professor Snape said it would make you sleepy, so it'll be better for you if we're already laying down."
Slughorn's words and Daphne's broken arm came back to him. Would Harry get....
Harry shook his head in astonishment and confusion.
Draco had to trust his own magic. Even if he couldn't. He didn't have another choice right now. Harry was waiting for him, depending on him. Draco knew it in his bones.
Snuffles
"The gem works a little like a call button. If you press on it twice in a row, it will alert me to where you are, kind of like a Point-Me spell. So I'll be able to find you if you need help."
Draco sniffed, refusing to look at Dumbledore. He didn't want to cry in front of him. "He might already be dead."
Harry cried out a little bit, hands moving to his nose. Draco felt awful, but realized his nose did look a little straighter now. Not knowing any cleaning spells that weren't for clothes, Draco got a towel wet and started cleaning the blood and tears from Harry's face.
Harry snorted a bit. "What kind of name is Snuffles?"
Harry
"Well...I did at first, but Uncle Vernon wouldn't let me have it. And then eventually the entire house was full of them. They flew through the windows and the chimney and the pipes. Uncle Vernon took us to stay at a hotel that night, so that we couldn't any mail from there, but it still came. And then we went to this deserted house in the ocean, and right as it turned midnight on my eleventh birthday, Hagrid burst in," Harry took a moment to laugh, "scared the wits out of my family. Turned my cousin into a pig and everything! It was... the best day of my life." Harry said, stopping abruptly. "Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble. What's the next question?"
The sun was bright in his eyes as he left Hogwarts grounds. Only as he stepped onto the dewy grass did he realize McGonagall might still be out here, checking the wards.
Draco was tempted to mock the snake in his mind, but decided against it. He needed to get to Hogwarts first.
"First year at Hogwarts too?" The boy asked. Harry turned to look at him again. He was very... pristine. There didn't seem to be a hair out of place. Harry felt shabby next to him, but that wasn't a new feeling.
"Give it too him before he goes to bed. It will likely make him tired. Be careful, Draco." With a nod, Snape left, leaving Draco feeling lost and worried.
"That's alright. Professor Snape?" Dumbledore said, moving to look at the potions master.
There weren't any obvious displays of accidental magic, Draco hoped that meant this nightmare wasn't so bad. He sat on the edge of his bed, realizing Harry was whimpering and crying again. Draco felt utterly hopeless as he watched him. Draco crawled under the covers, pulling Harry close against his body.
No one had been injured, and the professors had taken care of the troll without any troubles. The only thing that had happened was that the troll busted up a bathroom. Hermione couldn't stop talking about it for weeks, she had tried to go back to the library that night to research, but it had been curfew.
The Hospital Wing was cold. Harry shivered slightly. He thought about casting a warming charm on himself, but wasn't sure how well he'd be able to do magic right now, so decided against it. Wondering why the Hospital Wing was so unreasonably cold, he kicked his dangling feet back and forth. Harry thought it might've been to discourage students.
Harry sat on a bench underneath a snow-covered tree, looking at the whomping willow ahead of him. Hermione was coming back with butterbear and a steak for Snuffles, who laid at Harry's feet with a warming charm on him. "Sirius," Harry spoke quietly, mindful of Hermione's impending return. Sirius perked his head up immediately. "I'm scared. And I'm angry. Lucius sent a letter to me and Draco a few days ago. He knows what the first task of the tournament is, and he expects us and some other Death Eaters to tamper with it. A lot of students could get hurt." Harry paused, taking a breath to steady his wavering voice.
"Your fellow students, who were affected by this creature are being administered a cure as we speak, and will be joining you tomorrow. In celebration, classes will be canceled tomorrow. Take the day to enjoy time with your classmates, your friends. Enjoy it as much as you can before finals come in just a few short weeks. Now, eat!"
"My dear students," Dumbledore spoke, his voice booming from the high table, "thanks to our amazing board of Professors, the creature that has been terrorizing our school these past months has been neutralized!" Thunderous applause met his declaration, the student body cheered and whistled and howled. Dumbledore's smile was wide as he motioned for them to calm down several beats later.
"Is it going to taste bad?"
If only Draco could find him like Harry had always been able to. Like he had a -
"You didn't think I'd let you one-up me, did you?" Draco asked him smugly. But like had happened in June, Draco had snuck into Harry's room to give him his birthday gift.
Harry had barely any time to work on his studies. Exams were two weeks away and Hermione was not proud of his productivity. But she was always willing to study and practice spells with him, which had been useful.
Harry stepped into the shower to warm himself. He'd been hearing that voice too often in his dreams. He was beginning to have worryingly dark circles. Hermione was starting to bug him about asking the school nurse for a sleeping drought. Neville said her name was Madam Pomfrey and she was nice, if a bit stern.
Professor Quirrell turned around, slowly unwrapping his turban. For a second, Harry wondered how stupid Quirrell thought he was. He wasn't going to get scared by the back of someones hea-
Draco watched as Dumbledore cast his phoenix patronus, speaking calmly into it. When his message, simply "come to my office" was complete, he split it into four duplicates and sent them through the door. They were left in silence. Draco didn't move.
Pettigrew squeaked, and Harry laughed.
Draco decided,
Lupin gave him a proud smile. "Studying for your exams, I imagine?"
"He's really smart, isn't he?" Hermione scratched the side of his face, smiling.
Harry looked back at Hagrid, who gave him another smile, though it wasn't nearly as cheerful as it had been. That hurt Harry, more than he wanted it to. He decided he wasn't going to let others feelings affect him so much. They never had, in the past. But then again, he never had anyone that cared about him.
The cyclone started again only this time it whirled fast enough to make Draco's hair flutter, and he stopped that immediately. Instead, he tried what his mom would always do to calm him down when he was worked up. He moved his index finger to circle the ring of Harry's ear. He kept up for a little while, and the swirl of pillows and stuffed animals started to slow.
And if Draco ignored the voice in his head that told him he wasn't only doing this for Harry, well that was fine. The voice couldn't tell anymore else.
you when he was a child."
"I didn't eat much as a kid."
Harry moved back under his arm, eyes falling close. "I'm-I'm sleepy," he mumbled, before going limp.
Harry shook his head.
"My hand was raised way before hers!"
Draco didn't calm down until Harry's breathing became steady enough to relax him. Draco thought now was the appropriate time to leave. He stood, his heart twinging just enough for him to roughly scold himself, he removed Harry's arms, which were wrapped around his neck.
"I am hoping that an antidote to the regular
"Though petrification was thought to be incurable, it was discovered in 994 A.D. that the juice of an adult mandrake can cure petrification if administered within enough time."
"Would tears from Fawkes be any help?" Dumbledore asked Snape, who paused for a moment then nodded.
"Nonsense, nonsense! I will not hear it! Mr. Malfoy, take Mr. Potter to the hospital wing or I will be forced to take away house points. I will not allow a student to walk to the hospital wing by themselves, and as partners you are responsible for each other. Now grab Mr. Potters things and off you go!" He huffed, watching with a raised eyebrow as Draco collected Harry's bag and cloak and walked stiffly out the door. He made a small shooing motion at Harry then, who sighed slightly before walking out behind Draco.
After they left, Dumbledore moved to his balcony and pointed his wand to the sky. Lips moving rapidly, he spoke complex Latin that Draco couldn't make out, and didn't quite care too at the moment. He hadn't moved from his slumped position other than to lean his head back to watch the Headmaster.
Harry smiled wide.
His eyes darted around. He was good at looking for escapes, he had done it a lot. He could, now that they weren't holding him. There was a window on the other side of the room, but he wouldn't be able to reach it unless he climbed on the table. He wasn't fast enough. The door they had come through was blocked by the woman and one of the other two.
whined. Harry looked at him, somewhere between a glare and defeated.
"Why? There hasn't even been anything in the news talking about Death Eater activity." Harry sipped his glass, burning his tongue. Professor Lupin cast a cooling charm on it.
"There is a Quidditch tournament soon. Malfoy, you'll take the boys. Crouch will go with you in disguise. Afterwards, burn it to the ground. I don't care how, and don't incriminate yourselves. Light your own sleeping quarters if you must. Crouch, the mark. Don't be caught, I don't care who you have to kill."
"Are you going with Granger to Hogsmead again?" Draco asked nonchalantly from the other side of the chess board. His eyes were mostly on his pieces, but they flicked up to Harry ever so often. The common room fireplace roared loudly next to them.
"It's alright. It's just a silly scar, after all."
"Wicked," she whispered, before she started to look a little panicked, "oh that must've been incredibly rude, I'm sorry if it was," she apologized. Harry felt a little better now, and smiled back.
He stroked her gently, listening to her coo in response. He would've preferred a cat, but she was a gift from Hagrid and there wasn't a chance he was going to refuse her.
"Who the fuck are you?"
Draco decided after a moment. He laid sideways on the bed so he could watch, feeling a bit creepy as he did so. He didn't care. There was no one to see him. No one to judge him. No one to know that he wanted Harry in his arms, even if he wasn't small anymore.
Harry gasped, hands grabbing his head as he doubled over and choked on a scream.
"Incendio." Harry pointed his wand into the middle of the pit, watching the vines shrink and scream. Quirrell had taught him that one.
Harry nodded slowly. So many memories buzzed in his head, all seeming so
she whispered, and with a snapping sound the sellotape unwound. She handed them back to him, a proud smile on her face. Harry was stunned. They were perfect! He'd been able to alter the lenses enough that he could see with the right prescription, but oddly enough he'd never been able to use magic to fix the frames. He gave Hermione a wide smile as he put them on.
He woke up on the floor with a gasp. The room was empty, save for Nagini. Harry looked at her, rage filling him. She hissed at him. "
"There we go, m'boy! Go ahead, down it goes," Professor Slughorn said happily, encouraging Harry with a large smile. Harry didn't think it was very encouraging.
He barked at them, jumped around them in a circle, and cuddled up to Hermione, and then Harry. The happy dog had them laughing loudly for several minutes. "Oh, I wish Hogwarts allowed dogs, he's just the sweetest thing!" Hermione cooed at the dog, who nipped at her.
Draco paused for a moment. That's hadn't been the embarrassing name he had expected. Draco considered what kind of family did that, thinking about how Harry had been acting. He... he had changed a bit, hadn't he? Harry didn't walk with the confidence he usually had, or talk like he used to. Though, he was still snarky around Draco, but hadn't he seen him flinch at his voice earlier? He noticed how stiff Harry sat. How Harry looked like he was ready to bolt from his chair.
Draco stepped in slowly, first noticing how much taller Professor Dumbledore seemed behind his desk, and then the two empty chairs in front of him.
. Sitting for so long made him realize it was likely very early in the morning, and he was utterly drained.
"Done eating?" Draco asked him. Harry nodded slowly. "Good. Madam Pomfrey also left a healing balm, I was thinking we should put it on your chin so that nasty bruise will go away," he talked as he walked past Harry -who had lightly touched his face at the mention of the bruise- into the kitchenette.
Harry cried out. Draco settled into the couch and drank his a little slower, forgetting he was drinking it half the time and just watching Harry enjoy himself.
Hermione giggled a bit. "Of course - say, you never gave me your name."
"What had happened?"
"You will fly immediately back. I expect you before sunrise. Leave." Voldemort waved a dismissive hand, and Harry and Draco ran to get their brooms.
Draco gave her a strained smile, looking towards Dumbledore. "Headmaster... are-are our rooms safe?"
"See, but mine if better, watch," Draco said, grabbing Harry's hand and pointing to the gem. "Yours is well, cute, but mine is truly useful," he flounced the hand that wasn't holding Harry's around dramatically. "If you press on this
"I need to do something."
Apparition had been the subject Harry was to study religiously this summer. And Apparition he had mastered.
Dumbledore remained quiet. Draco was ready to start tugging on his hair again. "Please, Headmaster. I couldn't do anything, I don't know what to do. He's g-gone. Harry's gone," Draco said quietly, staring at his hands.
Great.
Harry and Draco sat in the library, working on their transfigurations essay. The new teacher was fine, but didn't hold a candle to Mcgonagall, in Harry's opinion. Draco stopped writing, and it look Harry a while to notice. When he did, Draco was looking hard at his hand.
Would Harry even give him a chance? Did Draco deserve a chance? Perhaps not. He had been a complete git until now. Draco had never regretted his actions as much as he did now. Draco thought he would be crushed if Harry woke up cursing him, whether or not he remembered.
The skin was smooth and creamy. Draco frowned, thinking Harry must have been having a nightmare, but as he watched a misshapen dot appeared on Harry's back. It bloomed rapidly across Harry's back, a light purple bruise that was around the size of Draco's own palm.
"Are you okay, Harry?" Hermione asked gently. They sat on a bench that overlooked the shrieking shack. Harry suspected Sirius would be showing up soon; he hadn't seen him in awhile, and he was missing him.
The noise that came out of Harry's mouth was not natural, yet he understood it perfectly.
Professor Slughorn was nearing their table, and Draco was panicking. The potion had become a woodsy dark green color that was absolutely unacceptable. It was supposed to be a soft turquoise, and just shy of being chunky. At the very least, the texture seemed...tolerable.
He went to his room to grab the letter he had started last night, returning to the living room with more paper and a self-inking quill. Tossing the old note away, he started anew.
For a moment he wondered what the second chair was for, until a high squawking sound drew his attention to a very large bird in the corner, who was nuzzling against a giggling Mini-Potter.
Professor Snape nodded slightly. Harry gave a minuscule smile in response, but it dropped and his eyes darted away. "Who is Petunia Dursley?"
"I...don't know. What does the rest of it say?"
Harry shrieked. He writhed on the ground, screaming, crying, kicking, anything. Dirt flew into his mouth and eyes, splinters dug themselves deeper and deeper into his skin, but it was nothing compared to the agony. This was worse than when Uncle Vernon burned his hand on the stove-top, and Dudley pushed him into the rosebush and-
"My Aunt Petunia," Harry answered quickly. "I live with her, Uncle Vernon, and my cousin Dudley."
"Draco, I am constantly with Blaise and Theo and especially you. Is it wrong that I'd like some alone time and friendship outside of my own house that isn't bogged down by the
"He said that Pettigrew was, uhm. I forget what he said, something about a keeper of something. And that he was a Death Eater. Had the Dark Mark and everything."
Draco opened his mouth to argue when a beam of light flew into the room. It hovered as a sphere between them, and the argument was forgotten. Draco couldn't decipher the glowing lines and runes, but Dumbledore could from his intent staring.
"Now, before we continue, who remembers the name and the properties of this particular potion?" Professor Slughorn squinted throughout the classroom, where several hands had been raised. "Yes, Ms. Dunbar?"
"Finnigan, Seamus!"
He had her there. "What if he wanders off? He'll be invisible!"
He cast a
Draco yelled, grabbing Harry and holding him to his chest. "Harry! Harry!" Draco shouted. Harry didn't budge. Draco waited for long moments, waiting for the shimmer, a shake, a change in breath, anything. It was similar to how Harry had reacted last time, but it sounded like Harry had been in pain and it scared him.
"RAVENCLAW!"
"She must, she's a Herbology expert. Do you think they'll be ready in time?" Hermione bit her lip as she asked the question, looking at the two of them worriedly.
"Why're you here?" Harry asked, voice choked with tears. Draco swallowed heavily, not sure how he was supposed to explain himself in this situation which...wasn't really appropriate.
He sat at the table for a while longer, head in his hands. He felt calmer than he would have without Pomfrey's potions, he was sure. But he still felt like something was...
"Excuse me, Professor, but I do have classes I need to attend." Draco was getting a little irritated now, being ignored continuously. He had more important things to do than to contemplate the meaning of names!
Harry's world went green.
"Well, we'll start simple, I guess," Draco said, looking about as awkward as Harry felt. "Tell me your full name."
"Sit down on the couch so I can put this on it, okay?" Draco gestured from the table, but Harry hadn't moved at all. Draco crouched next to him so they were eye-level. "Does it hurt?"
"Did you know that we're supposed to give any sort of detention we can? For any reason at all? And they all have to be with her?"
He started to run, before his feet stuttered. He pressed on his ring three times, and felt a sickening sensation as he was whirled through the air. He landed on top of Draco, who had been in his bed, with an
"What happened when he took the potion?"
"How did you get this?" Draco's voice was low. Harry smiled.
Draco leaned on his elbow and rested his hand in front of his mouth to hide his smile as Harry dragged his feet up to the teachers desk. He thought Harry may have been attempting to hide in his shirt. Draco made an attempt to stifle his laughter.
He waited.
"She's using a blood quill on students and is an annoying, incompetent teacher. Do you need more?"
"A week, maybe," Draco stood from his seat quickly.
, Draco thought to himself.
Harry locked the door magically behind him. "Silencio," Harry whispered. A bright red coursed from his wand, enveloping Pettigrew's form for a moment. Harry smiled just a bit, casting spells to keep Pettigrew in his animagus form, and then bound him in quick succession. Harry held a wriggling rat in moments.
"Who is Professor Snape?"
"You seem perfectly fine," Madam Pomfrey declared. Harry looked up from his lap. "Even your teeth fixed themselves. I thought I might have to shrink them like I did Mrs. Granger years ago."
"What hou-wait, what? You didn't get it by owl?" Draco asked, stopping his motion of pouring himself some tea.
A tape measure flew around him quick enough to make him dizzy. The boy next to him laughed a bit, and Harry shot him a small glare. The boy didn't seem bothered by that.
Draco nodded, eyes downcast. It confirmed his own suspicions, but it was still uncomfortable to know. Draco certainly hadn't made Harry's life better. And neither had Severus, come to think of it. His godfather had always been nasty to Potter in potions.
Harry sat in the shade of a large tree on the edge of the Black Lake and the Forbidden Forest. The castle was mostly obstructed by the trees. He had sat here for around an hour, waiting. He had told Hermione he needed some alone time. He had told Draco the same thing, but the bugger never listen, so it became more of a
it to catch fire.
snake with a plume on the top of it's head, tongue flicking into the air lazily. Vibrant green scales reflected off the moonlight, illuminating the room slightly.
The creature's voice faded. It had moved too far for Harry to hear it anymore. Harry went back to bed, but it was long hours before he fell asleep.
Draco realized he had no way to send the letter; his and Potter's pets were in the owlery and Draco wasn't comfortable with leaving Harry; them going together wasn't an option, if there was a chance a student would see them.
"I-I'm sorry, it's nothing. You can go back to bed, Harry." Draco said softly. Harry nodded, laying back down next to Draco. "Sleep well," he whispered, running a hand through Harry's hair. He was asleep in moments.
"Sirius... Sirius was a Death Eater. I didn't kno-"
The line passed further into the house. Draco's heart stopped. That was Voldemort's snake, wasn't it? Draco was almost sure of it. And if Nagini was there...other Death Eaters probably were too. Maybe even Voldemort...
"I am well aware, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore chuckled a small bit. Draco felt his face burn slightly.
"Hi." He was frozen, unable to look away from Harry's face. It was so different, having him like this. Harry flushed from his gaze, which Draco liked quite a bit but didn't dare say.
Dumbledore nodded solemnly. "Mr. Malfoy, please remember to alert myself or at least another professor before you go running off. Otherwise, I wonder if Harry has been influencing you more than you have been influencing him. This is very out of character, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore watched him carefully. Draco couldn't do anything but shrug helplessly.
Harry screamed as his entire world lit up green and the man holding him jerked him around. They were in a dark room, but Harry couldn't see anything else past his tears. He sobbed, struggling to breathe from the force of it and how tightly the man was holding him. He punched weekly at the arm, legs flailing.
isn't here right now," Harry looked at him briefly, watching Draco huff again.
Harry went with Draco and Lucius when they arrived at the platform. He didn't know what enchantments were on his house or his family that meant his absence didn't raise questions. All he knew was that Voldemort wanted him close by.
Harry snorted. "You've been working with me on this for months. I think the only that's progressed are my cavities."
Hermione hummed a little, her brow furrowing. "I believe so, Flitwick taught us some household spells last year that included charms for pets. If he holds still, I think I can make his fur clean."
"Are you okay, Harry? You've been so drained lately. I've been meaning to ask, but we never seem to be alone anymore. You're always with Malfoy." Hermione laid a gloved hand on his arm. Harry gave her a thankful smile, sighing.
Draco's shoulders slumped. He leaned his forehead against the cool tile of his shower. This was useless. Draco pulled himself together and made himself comfortable in his room, settling down with his arithmancy essay
Harry stopped breathing. He couldn't tell where it was coming from. It sounded like it came from... everywhere. He covered his ears, trying to block it out, to muffle the voice. It eventually went away, and Harry gave a sigh of relief.
"I'll go get him some food, cast a warming charm on him," Harry told her. She nodded, and Harry set off. It didn't take long to get back. He had gotten more food this time, not liking how skinny Snuffles was. Snuffles took the food from Harry's hand carefully, not even a tooth touching his skin.
Harry snorted. That concept no longer existed.
We have to find him!" Draco shouted. Dumbledore gave him a single look, and Draco felt shame filling in as the rage drained. He sat back in his chair, limp. He couldn't bring himself to apologize. Dumbledore didn't seem to expect him to.
Harry nodded. "Just a few weeks away! Have a good evening, Professor Lupin!"
"Whenever you're ready, Ms. Granger."
get better.
Draco had been more help than Harry had expected. He was happy to play chess with Harry any time he liked, and gave him lots of tips. Draco also knew lots of defensive and offensive spells, and didn't mind teaching Harry when he had the time.
Malfoy eventually came out, robes clean and nose straight. Harry stood up, taking satisfaction in the way Malfoy flinched.
"Mr. Potter, can you tell me who Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are?"
because I have to see that rat bastards ugly face everyday during the summer.
Lucius decided not to tell them that the Dark Lord would most likely demand all their time in the next few years. The Dark Lord was gone, now off on the hunt for something Lucius wasn't allowed to know about. Several Death Eaters were still in his home, but they had all been given rooms far away, and had agreed to stay away from the boys this Christmas break.
Draco wasn't sure how long he stayed like that until a throat cleared. Harry jumped, started, though Draco just glared at his godfather, who looked like he wanted to laugh at him.
Harry swallowed, and hoped Voldemort didn't hear it. He'd probably mistake it for fear, rather than the disgust it was. "I would be honored, My Lord. What is my task?"
A moment later, he was warming himself in the soft glow of the firelight, smiling as the chill left his bones.
"No fair! I didn't get a new broom!" Draco called out, eyes alight with jealousy.
" His wand lit up normally. "
Ignored again. "Harry, what kind of dragon was it that you fought just a few years ago? Mighty beast, wouldn't you say?"
charms throughout almost the entire path. He wouldn't be able to hear the snake unless it hissed.
He could feel Draco smile against his hair. "Of course, Scar-Head."
"I am." Harry whispered. Draco stopped in his tracks.
." Harry's voice broke. He wasn't sure if it was from rage or fear. Sirius whimpered at his feet.
Draco smiled softly, stroking Harry's face again. "You are wonderful."
, he told himself, shaking his head angrily. Harry didn't deserve to stay like this just because Draco wanted him too.
Draco nodded stiffly. He started to stand, but Dumbledore held out a hand. "You must be exhausted. Dinky," Dumbledore called. The excited house-elf popped in immediately. "Take Mr. Malfoy to his rooms, please."
Draco walked quickly, not wanting to leave Harry alone for long for some silly reason. He changed his own clothes and grabbed a different set of pajamas for Harry. He'd almost walked out before he stopped himself. Grabbing one more thing, he darted back. He put the stuffed animal -Harry had named it Snuffles and wouldn't explain why- on the table in front of the couch.
Harry wracked his brain. Was that a spell? An artifact? Something he had learned about, something a Death Eater had mentioned that he should know? Slowly, Harry shook his head.
Harry smiled at the concern. "Little accident in potions, is all. I'll be okay."
Luckily, his trek was short, down a flight of stairs and a hallway, and soon he was face to face with the large gargoyle that protected the Headmasters Office.
Harry's head snapped up so quickly Draco thought he may have given himself whiplash. His eyes were full of dread as he realized he would be drinking his own botched potion. He stared at the professor for a moment, his eyes similar to that of a deer in headlights. He looked over at Draco, panic quite clear. Harry wasn't sure why he looked at Draco. He certainly wasn't going to be getting help from the wanker who was filling another small potion bottle. And...were the corner of his lips...twitching?
"Holy. Merlins. Balls."
"You're wrong. I stay with Draco Malfoy over the holidays. His father used to know a lot of Death Eaters, and he got really mad when the Daily Prophet called him a Death Eater. And then he talked about knowing Pettigrew, and how, uhm..." Harry paused, trying to remember the words. Lupin seemed glued to his seat, eyes as round as saucers.
Both boys seemed deep in concentration. Draco was bent over a cutting board, measuring the distance between his slices of newt, while Harry poured over a textbook, making suggestions and comments which were only greeted with disdainful remarks and a sneer.
"You can't stop Him, Harry."
But Draco knew he didn't really want that. He didn't want Harry to start hating him again. Part of him was relieved, though he felt guilty over it. "Dray?"
"No! Not at all, not even a little bit. What else do you know about Professor Snape?"
"Already?" Hermione looked up, muggle pen dangling out of her mouth. Harry had decided to bring them this year, since quills took too long for him. Hermione had scolded him at first, but not even she could deny the practicality of pens. He had given her one of the packs he brought.
"Did you kill others? I don't know. Did you betray my parents because you were the secret keeper? I don't know. If Peter was the secret keeper, I can imagine him giving them out, because he's a
(See the end of the chapter for
Dinky looked back at Harry, a wide, watery smile on her face. "Yes Sir Potter! You are very kind, you do not need to thank Dinky!"
This time, he was going to buy a pair of trainers that actually fit.
"Headmaster Dumbledore?"
Harry's raised an eyebrow in question. His silent inquiry was not answered. "As it is, you will have accommodated sleeping conditions, meal times and classes until other arrangements are made, as I've been informed." Madam Pomfrey said.
Draco was a little hurt Harry didn't say anything, but he realized that it was completely like Harry to do so. Harry kept things from people all the time, even his closest friends. He had heard multiple arguments about Harry not telling them things because of some stupid Gryffindor reason.
"Really, Mr. Potter, now is not the time to nurse your pride," Madam Pomfrey muttered as she discarded the empty potion bottles. "If you do spontaneously remember something to do with Muggles and bruises, please enlighten me and I will take care of it, I assure you." She glared at him until he nodded. Satisfied, she looked to Professor Dumbledore who had been standing behind her quietly.
With a grunt, he pushed himself up. Voldemort hadn't said anything about a mirror...
Draco picked at his own food, not feeling well enough though he was very glad Harry was. He didn't seem to notice the changes to his own body, and Draco wasn't sure if he should point them out. Harry never looked in the mirror, so he didn't think he'd realize it on his own. He probably wouldn't notice the scales if he kept wearing long sleeves and pants, since there were none on his hands. The only thing that had surprised him was that Harry didn't say anything about his teeth, which must have felt different in his mouth.
"Don't be an ass, Harry. You look like you're a breath away from collapse." Draco shook him, leading him away from the Great Hall and towards the common room. Harry allowed it because it was near Snape's office and he wasn't actually sure if he could fight Draco off right now. He didn't think he wanted to.
Harry had
"Bludgers...they chase people around. And kaffels-Quaffles score points." Harry nodded, satisfied with himself. Dumbledore smiled down at him kindly.
Red sparks shot up from the far end of the maze, away from where Harry and Draco sat. The fog cleared, and Aurors rushed in. The projection changed to follow the wizards. Cedric lay incapacitated, a skrewt not far away. One Auror took it out, the others lifted Cedric into the air and guided him out. Harry thought he looked dead.
"Thank you, Madam Pomfrey. I think it would be fine to wake Harry up now, if you would." He inclined his head towards the nurse, who nodded and spoke a quiet charm. Draco watched Harry closely, waiting for some sign of pain or anything else that would be out of the ordinary.
Soon, Harry breathed evenly again, and Draco let himself relax. He could only imagine Harry was talking about The Dark Lord killing his mother, from what he knew, but... Harry was so young. He wondered if that had been what the last nightmare was, or maybe it had been something else.
Harry hesitantly approached the House-Elf. He held out his hand for a shake. "Hello." Dinky started to tear up, and Harry began to worry he did something wrong.
"And she won't," Harry countered. "I only need a few potions."
will suffice, but it is hard to say."
"Mr. P-P-P-Potter, stay back please," Professor Quirrell called out. Harry sighed, and gathered his things. The class was dismissed, but instead of going to lunch Harry walked up to Professor Quirrell's desk.
Harry explored Diagonally, watching Hagrid closely. They had just come out of Gringotts with a paper-wrapped package Hagrid couldn't tell Harry about. That was strange, but Harry didn't want to push his luck if he could avoid it. Hagrid guided him to a store called Madam Malkin's, leaving him with instructions to 'talk to the nice lady about yer robes.' Harry thought it a little odd to drop off a kid you weren't in charge of, but he was very used to independence. Harry walked into the store, quickly being ushered onto a stool next to a blond boy.
"Healing and nutrient potions," she said curtly. Harry stared at her, realizing what exactly that meant.
"Fawks is at his best right now, and he certainly enjoys attention," Dumbledore spoke from behind his desk. Harry looked over, and saw the empty chairs facing the desk. He moved to sit, but Dumbledore held up his hand. "We'll be here for a moment, please continue. Would you like a Lemon Drop?" He offered, motioning towards a bowl.
"Penelope is
Draco almost stabbed his eyeball with a quill when several of his alarms started to go off. He launched out of his chair, dismissing the alarms as he rushed into the room.
"I think we need to head back now, 'Mione."
noise, and put her wand away. "There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with him. We all know Mr. Potter had a.. special relationship to You-Know-Who, perhaps the scar is more related to it than we think. I'll speak to Dumbledore about it. Where is Mr. Potter's room?" Madam Pomfrey took her wand out once more, levitating Harry.
"How do I use it?"
Madam Pomfrey poked her head out behind a closed curtain. "Oh my," she murmured, upon seeing mini-Potter. She quickly turned back to the student she had been treating, cast a spell or two, made a quick order to 'be gentle with it less is break again before this blasted potion goes away'.
Draco nodded, a bit hurt that Harry didn't remember. He suppose that wasn't odd, though. That could've been something he forgot naturally. It wasn't that significant, anyways.
"Fest-uhm, Festina te-"
"I'm okay. it's kinda disorienting, my limbs aren't the size they're supposed to be. And I think my glasses are the wrong prescription, things are still blurry." Madam Pomfrey tapped his glasses quickly, and suddenly Harry could see better than he ever had! He blinked rapidly to adjust to the change, giving Madam Pomfrey a grateful smile.
There was a hallway to Draco's right, and a rickety staircase on his right. He didn't have time to go the wrong way. His hand started sweating.
"Please, Mr. Malfoy, take a seat. You as well, Harry." Professor Dumbledore held out a bowl. "Lemon drop?" Draco hesitated a moment then took one. Damned sweet tooth. Harry took one also, face scrunching up at the sour taste. Draco laughed a little, before it quickly dropped after realizing that Harry was looking at him.
without being able to attend the lessons. He and Blaise shared most of their classes, and the ones he didn't he was able to get copies of notes from Theo or Pansy. Even with their notes and the lesson copy he received from teachers, it wasn't the same as being there.
Harry glared at her, which wasn't nearly as intimidating as it would have been just a few minutes ago. Draco distractedly compared the look to a grumpy kneazle.
"Yes," he answered quickly. Harry knew the boy expected him to say more, but... what was he supposed to say? He knew next to nothing about the wizarding world.
"Alright, now for the big question, who is He-Who," he stopped. Potter always said his name, didn't he? Straining, Draco asked, "who is Voldemort?"
Once dismissed, Draco went to his last class of the day, arithmancy with Professor Vector. Draco was in a good mood as he walked into her class. He hadn't needed to worry about Potter at all, and was assured this matter would take care of itself without his needing to be involved or concerned, and a day where he did not need to deal with Potter was indeed a good day.
I hope you guys enjoy! Please tell me what you think!
"Mr. Potter, good to see you like yourself," a voice spoke above him.
"Draco, I need you to teach me the best offensive spell you know." Harry stared at the boy, whispering to him, not knowing if he wanted Blaise or Theo to hear. Draco raised an eyebrow, leaning in as well.
A map! Harry had a map! Draco stumbled out of the bed, falling to his knees in front of the trunk that lay at the foot. He tossed the lid open, finding piles of wrinkled clothes and parchment. He threw it assigned, looking for - there!
Draco wasn't sure if he'd include that in his report to Dumbledore. It seemed pointless, along with telling him what his relatives called him. Well, unless it meant Harry wouldn't live with his Muggle family anymore. And that would be good, wouldn't it? Draco would have to think about it.
"Her name is Hedwig. You can pet her, if you want. Just be gentle, she's really nice," Harry told her. She smiled brightly and gently stuck her finger in through the bars. Hedwig hooted and scooted closer to her. Hermione giggled.
They arrived in the middle of the room. Madam Pomfrey bustled over from behind her desk upon seeing them. "Lay him on that bed there, Mr. Malfoy," she instructed, pointing to a bed next to him. Draco lay him gently, feeling like he was letting go of something precious when he stepped away.
"Harry!" Hermione cried out. Her high pitched voice rang throughout the classroom. Professor Slughorn stood on the side worriedly. Like the students, he didn't do much besides stand on the side and watch Harry tremble, though he did prepare another numbing potion along with some other potions his panicked mind thought might be needed.
"Chin up."
"This is a very serious situation, and I need both of you to help me. Mr. Potter is vulnerable right now because of his lack of magical ability, I think it best to keep him separated from the rest of the schools population. I'm sure you boys both understand what could happen if this news spread to unfriendly ears." Dumbledore looked down at them over his glasses, waiting for a nod.
Harry gave him a thumbs up before the hat covered his eyes, seeing how nervous the boy was. Neville fidgeted where he sat, his knuckles almost white from gripping the stool.
Harry nodded, hoping off the chair and walking calmly to his room. Draco felt like he was going to vomit. Harry would wake up normal tomorrow, probably hating Draco. They would go their separate ways, and it would be awkward, and Draco would be harboring affection for Harry that wasn't shared.
Draco woke up on the floor, an ache in his muscles. Groaning, he reached for the table to pull himself up, confused when he couldn't find it. Opening blurry eyes, he realized it was knocked over, one mug and spoon staining the carpet, the other smashed near the fireplace.
His vision started to dim. He heard the man say something, and saw a bright green light come towards him, before it reared above his head and he saw a flash of a pink tongue and sharp fangs.
Draco dragged his feet. Harry had already changed into his pajamas and was under the blanket, holding the stuffed dog. Draco pulled the potion out of his robe so he wouldn't crush it, climbing in next to Harry. Draco smiled as Harry tucked himself into his side like he always did. Draco would miss this more than anything, he thought. It would be weird sleeping on his own.
Draco pulled out his schoolwork to hopefully make some progress while Harry slept.
Harry looked down at the mutt in his lap, and a small smile came to his face. "Snuffles."
"I haven't been told anything, but it seems she does. If I had to guess, based on the facts and what I have witnessed in my own experience," he started, Draco thought Severus looked ashamed, "it would not be surprising if he was abused at home."
is angry, and if we blunder his plans for the final tasks He-He might k-kill-" Draco stopped himself, hugging his torso. His eyes were red and puffy.
Minister Crouch... a death eater?
"I..." Harry, hesitated, looking at the two of them to see if he'd be interrupted. Draco thought that was rather strange. He couldn't remember a time Potter didn't blunder through a sentence thoughtlessly. "I understand, sir, but what about my classes Professor?"
Draco nodded, eyes flickering to her and back to Harry. "Mr. Malfoy, there is nothing you can do. You've done everything you can. You should be taking care of yourself, now." She placed a hand on his shoulder. Draco felt his lip quiver, but he clenched his jaw. He thought he would cry if he looked at her.
"Harry, you didn't do anything wrong. I just need you to take this potion, and then you can eat whatever you want. Will you sit down?"
Hermione picked at her nails a little bit, once again giving Harry the idea that she was much more nervous that she was acting. "I learned this once that fixes things. I could try and fix your glasses, if you'd like. I don't think the sellotape will last for much longer." She gave a nervous laugh, like she wasn't sure whether or not she was joking, and relaxed when Harry laughed with her.
"No, Harry, you don't need to do any cleaning. Just eat, relax, and enjoy yourself, it's okay." This time he waited for Harry to nod before he left, feeling lighter and heavier at the same time.
"I-I don't want to go back... it's scary..."
"Still. She's awful to be around, without the blood quills." Harry gently moved his hand to cover Draco's, who finally looked at him.
Heart leaping into his chest, Draco cast cushioning charm after protection charm after lightweight charm and anything else he could think of.
"Maybe I just don't know why you continue to prefer the Mudbloods company over ours. Are we not good enough for you, Harry?" Draco sneered. Harry reeled back in his seat. Draco hadn't used that word in private since second year, and he hadn't been this aggressive towards Harry since their first day at Hogwarts.
Harry smiled. "When are my ideas ever good?"
"Here we go," Draco said, handing Harry his mug. He'd put a cooling charm on it so Harry wouldn't burn his hands or his tongue. Draco had never seen his eyes be so wide.
Harry cursed internally. The mission had been bestowed upon Lestrange, Lucius, and Dolohov. Free more followers in Azkaban. This was the last thing Harry wanted, more support for Voldemort.
"Who is he going to kill, Draco?" Harry asked quietly. The sense of dread in his stomach told Harry he knew the answer already, but hearing Draco say it was still like a punch in the gut that filled him with anger.
Hermione looked where he was looking, sighing sadly. "Such a shame our trips are so much shorter than they're supposed to be. You don't think one of those criminals are really going to try and attack Hogsmead, do you?" Hermione looked at him, still petting Snuffles softly.
"I'm Hermione. You are?" She held out her hand. Draco hesitated a moment, but then shook it firmly.
"Ah, yes! Of course! Mr. Malfoy, escort Mr. Potter to the hospital wing now. Grab his things, won't you?" Professor Slughorn said, as though it had been his idea the whole time. He smiled happily, patting his rotund belly.
"Kneel."
Indeed, many people thought it was a silly idea, but Professor Dumbledore had been adamant about making sure the teachers understood the new rules. Now, whenever a group project was introduced, teachers would arrange students from different houses to work alongside each other. Which,  two weeks into the new policy, had already erupted into several arguments.
He stopped himself. He didn't trust Sirius yet. He had no reason too.
"Uhm...thanks for the glasses, then," Harry said, more confused than showing gratitude. Harry looked down at his feet, pulling at his sleeve and therefore did not see the glare Draco shot him from over his shoulder.
Harry strode out of the room, seeing Voldemort at the not far from him. Only Voldemort's surprise at seeing Harry alive gave him enough time to shout, "AVADA KEDAVRA!"
Harry looked up. "Hm?"
The Whomping Willow was easily visible from where it rested at the top of a hill. Draco dropped to his knees at the base of it, out of the range of its branches, twitching in the breeze.
Harry eased himself off his bed, testing his legs and balance. He walked slowly to Draco's bed. He wanted... he wanted to be held. He wanted to lay by Draco and be in his arms.
." She licked her lips and snarled at Harry, revealing blackened teeth. "And you should be happy for this, after he
Draco used his other hand to run gently across Harry's back. How different would this feel if Harry was back to normal? How heavy would he be? What length had his hair been? Draco knew he was taller than Harry, but he strangely couldn't recall much else. He knew he was thin, but he always wore baggy clothes so how thin was anyone's guess.
Harry stood next to his bed, which was a four-poster like Draco's, but lower to the ground. There were a few stuffed animals on the bed, and Harry held one of a black dog.
"He's a useless teacher, Hermione, you know that. McGonagall is a better choice," Harry said, "you two go and tell her, I'm going to stay here and see if I can figure out what a Parsel-thing is."
Snape sighed, rubbing his temples. "What exactly did she do to deserve your vengeance? You haven't been particularly violent before."
"Mr. Potter."
"To the point, Mr. Malfoy."
"Dinky!"
"Nicely done. In fact, this particular batch that I've had you make is supposed to turn someone's age back a year, for about a half hour or so. Some of you will be testing out your potions today. Would anyone like to volunteer for extra cred- ah! Ms. Granger, why don't you come up?"
Harry looked at him with distrust. That was how he looked at him a lot of the time. "I promise, really." Draco nodded for emphasis. Harry nodded back, but Draco wasn't really convinced. When Harry didn't say anything, just sat on the counter playing with his thumbs and kicking his feat, Draco went back to petting his hair.
Harry tilted his head, brow furrowed. "What's that?"
The bleeding stopped after a minute, and Draco was able to clean up the blood that had dried on Harry's face. Draco was suddenly reminded of an accident he'd had when he was about eight. He had taken a tumble off his broom and had hurt his head.
Harry started sobbing again, closing his eyes. He couldn't do anything. He couldn't escape. He couldn't even wriggle around.
Harry sat in the library, writing his potions essay. Trust that to be Snape's first assignment of the year.
"Little tired, Harry. The prisoners being freed has had me more on edge lately than I like to admit." Professor Lupin leaned back in his chair, holding his tea in both of his hands.
Draco continued as the items eventually fell around them, no magic left to keep them afloat. He turned back to Harry, who had started to open his eyes.
"Mr. Potter, do you know who I am?" Dumbledore asked, crouching down a little to meet Harry's eye. Harry bit his lip and shook his head. Draco could tell he felt guilty for not knowing, so he rubbed his back to calm him down. Harry gave him a shy smile.
Harry drifted to sleep quicker than he had any other night, and Draco followed a long, softly petting his hair, a smile on his face.
Draco was holding Harry's wrist next to him. Harry's stomach churned with disgust. He dreaded who would be next.
Severus disappeared. Draco sat for a few more minutes thinking their conversation. It hadn't been as promising as he'd hoped it would be. Realizing he hadn't heard anything from Harry since he'd walked out of the room, Draco went into Harry's room. He found him sleeping, cuddling the large black dog stuffed animal.
He didn't move, didn't breath. He waited, and waited, and
Draco scooted across the living room to look at the gift in his hands, right when Lucius scolded him for his language.
"Hi Madam Pomfrey." He said quietly, giving a crooked smile in an attempt to placate her. Her eyebrow did not lower. Harry looked at Draco for help, who was pointedly looking at the clock on the wall. Draco would be late for class soon.
chambers. He had to tell Dumbledore, he had to
Loud barking caught up to his ears, Harry hardly had time to get off his broom and turn around before he was being tackled by a large, black dog. Harry laughed and wrestled with the animal. "See that, Snuffles? How cool was that? Huh? Huh good boy?" Harry was giving him a belly rub when Hermione finally got to them.
Harry realized, a happy smile on his face as he looked up.
Harry nodded, pulling the cloak out of a bottomless pocket in his robes. He cast a tracking spell on Snuffles, connecting a blue light between him and the dog that only Harry could see. "When did you learn that spell? It was never taught to us."
After a moment, when his body had stopped trembling, Draco wiped his eyes and sat up straight. Dumbledore looked at him, rubbing his beard and looking far too calm for Draco.
"Thank you, Dinky. If you'll show the boys to the room and how to open the door, after that you may return to the kitchens. Mr. Malfoy, you may return to your lunch and your classes, and spend the rest of the time as you may wish until curfew." He nodded to the three of them.
"Filthy," the third one muttered. They reached the second floor, which was as decrepit as the rest. Harry curled in on himself as much as he could, looking at the rusty nails and mold covering the walls.
"Of course Sir!" Dinky croaked happily, before popping away again. Harry stared at where the house elf had been, still seeming scared and shocked.
That spell worked fine too, along with a
Bellatrix cackled next to Voldemort, clapping delightedly. Her brother and husband, they must be. Lucius had mentioned them to him before, since they were loosely related to the Malfoy name.
"Why'd you have to lie? Why'd you have to make me think you were actually just an animal who liked my company? I fed you, I cleaned you, I sneaked you into the kitchens and you didn't have the decency to tell me? I had to figure it out from
Harry had no idea where he went, now, but he'd once heard Nagini whisper about an old shack in the woods with bodies in it, something about it being gaunt. All that mattered was this was still where Pettigrew spent his free time.
