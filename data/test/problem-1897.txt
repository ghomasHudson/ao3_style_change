“I can’t believe you’ve been living like this,” he says, shaking his head, “This poor house. You’ve been torturing it.”
“The lad lived with you-know-who for a year when he was sixteen,” Ron says, “He can take one month in Azkaban.”
“I like what you’ve done with the place,” Draco says, still moving his hips up and down, creating a friction that makes Harry harden in his pants. He’s still wearing jeans and a t-shirt.
He promises Malfoy he will come again soon and asks him please not to die before that. Then he lets Robards take him away.
Harry laughs and tells Malfoy he can pause what he’s watching, and Malfoy’s eyes widen and he rushes to the bathroom as soon as the image on the TV freezes.
Harry feels the impulse to sit on the piano bench next to him and interrogate Malfoy about his time as a Death Eater. He knows it’s probably painful for Malfoy to remember, too, so he doesn’t, but he wants to know, with every fibre of his body, how bad it was for Malfoy back then. He shakes his head. He can’t do that to Malfoy now.
Harry adjusts to sharing a house with Malfoy while also adjusting to dreaming about him every night.
Malfoy doesn’t answer. Instead he looks around the entrance hall with disgust, inspecting the walls where the wallpaper is coming down and looking appalled at the state of the house.
“Yeah,fair, but I never--” he points at his forearm and makes a weird sign with hand trying to mimic a snake.
“He keeps talking to the house, whispering little compliments and apologies, getting rooms to open up and fixing all the stupid wallpaper--”
“He was terrified, mate. His life was literally a living hell. They treated him like scum. Forced him to hurt us, then they’d hurt him for being bad at it. It was awful.”
“I mean, kinda, yeah. He spends all day reading and playing piano, I’m bored just thinking about it.”
Harry doesn’t mean for his visits to Malfoy to become a thing, but they do. It’s just--Harry doesn’t feel ready to start auror training so shortly after the war and he’s certain he doesn’t want to go back to Hogwarts either, so he’s mostly stuck at Grimmauld Place, which is an awful place to be at to begin with. He somehow ends up showing up to visit Malfoy again a few days later.
“Malfoy,” Harry starts, and doesn't miss the immediate reaction, as minimal as it is--he’s got years of watching him minutely, “Draco.”
He stays outside after everyone’s gone, going through the book and trying to name each cluster of stars before him. It shouldn’t really come as a surprise that his favorite constellation is Draco.
He meets Ron that evening, who doesn’t ask why Harry opts for a firewhiskey straight away, instead following his lead and ordering the same for himself. They drink and drink and don’t bother talking as neither of them is in the mood, and when it’s time to go home Ron walks back with him and passes out in the guest room.
“Someone attacked him in his cell,” Harry says, fuming, as soon as Kingsley lets him into his office, “I understand Azkaban isn’t a luxury hotel but I’m pretty sure prisoners are not supposed to be fearing for their life while they’re there.”
“I’m afraid there isn’t much I can do to help--I had my fair share of Malfoy dreams back in the day. It was confusing as hell.”
A bone deep chill sets in as soon as he steps onto the island, no matter how many warming charms he casts on himself, and he has to fight the sense of dread that threatens to fill him with every step he takes closer towards the prison.
Harry buys a TV for Malfoy and resolutely does not think about why he's bending over backwards for Malfoy to be happy.
“Only as a baby, but I have seen the pictures. And read all about the Great House of Black as a kid. This place was a big deal, you know.”
“I only have ten minutes, they don’t allow visitors to stay much. So I need you to cooperate and promise me that you’re going to eat and not let this bollocks prison consume you.”
That night when he goes to the kitchen for dinner he finds Draco sitting down in the dining room, having dinner in very fancy robes.
“We have to stop meeting this way, Potter,” Draco says, dragging his hips up so that he rubs against Harry’s crotch. It makes Harry dizzy with pleasure.
He floos Arthur Weasley that morning and asks him how to charm a TV to work in a magic household. Then he proceeds to owl Hermione and ask her to take him to the shops for a tv.
It’s technically not true. Back when Sirius was alive the house was angry and vicious but still liveable. Since Harry moved in it has only gotten darker and inhospitable.
“Look, I… I need to try. I have a better chance getting through to him without you here,” he looks at Robards pleadingly, “If I don’t do anything he might starve himself before his trial. Look at him.”
Harry ignores him and heads to his room, where he proceeds not to think about Draco’s lean hands all over the piano keys.
They get drunk and lose at trivia, then right before they leave Dean grabs him by the wrist and kisses him.
“I asked the house for somewhere not awful to sit. Also got the library to open up. Can’t believe you’ve been living in this state, to be quite honest.”
Kreacher rambles on. Mentions of muggleborns, of mixed blood reunions and  lack of parties. Harry listens to him go on and on about what a terrible owner Harry is, how he doesn’t respect the house or it’s heritage, how he pulled down all the portraits and insulted the spirit of the house repeatedly since he moved in.
“If you expect me to be objective about Draco then you won’t like my testimony,” Harry says at last.
Harry wonders if he’s ever been inside Malfoy’s room, wonders if he would have recognized it, if he would have known that Malfoy had spent his childhood nights in there.
It’s late when he makes it back to Grimmauld place. Malfoy is sat at the piano, playing with his eyes closed, when Harry walks in.
The next time he goes to see Malfoy, two days later, he finds him almost unconscious and bleeding on the floor of his cell.
Harry leaves him to it and goes to the kitchen to get something to eat, then heads out to meet Dean at the pub. It’s gay trivia night and Dean has been trying to get him to go for a while, so Harry figured he would go today and let Malfoy have some alone time to familiarize himself with the TV.
He walks around the entrance hall and Harry watches in awe as the wallpaper fixes itself and regains colour, how the burnt spots on the rug disappear and it looks luscious and expensive again, instead of the entrance to a rotting house.
He breathes out of his nose and keeps his eyes on the cement floor, tries not to wonder too much what the dark stains on the grey might be, and he expected it to be quiet, remembered it quiet, buw there’s banging from behind the doors as they walk down the hallway.
"No!" Harry cried, shaking him. "No, you're not dead, Malfoy — Draco, come back! Draco." Harry let himself fall over the limp, bloody body, sobbing into his own arms.
The implication was clear. Draco let the words reverberate, allowing the meaning to sink into his whirling mind.
"Are you alright?" Harry would have almost laughed at the look of genuine concern on Malfoy's face if he wasn't on the verge of tears.
Harry walked over to the pot and removed the lid, which Draco must have put back on over the pasta, causing it to boil over. When the water calmed down, Draco looked at Harry with wide, curious and slightly shaken eyes. "What--what did I do?"
Harry entered the room, eyes widening when he saw Draco. “Merlin,” he said breathily. “No matter how many times I see you as Tarasque, I don’t know if I’ll get over how incredibly sexy you look.”
Draco clutched the bathroom sink, resenting the sight of his tears dropping onto the porcelain. He scowled when they didn't erode the porcelain, that they weren't acidic after burning in his eyes. How unfair that only he should be the only one to feel this pain.
To Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, I leave 12 Grimmauld Place. Yes, this is for the both of you; to share, even if you're both too shy to admit you're in love with each other. Maybe this will help you both get your heads out of your arses.
As he walked, he saw a neon sign out of the corner of his eye. "Deliquesce" shone in bright letters like a beacon in the darkening alleyway, beckoning Draco inside.
There was peace in that; in his insignificance, in the fact that his young life would end among these magical objects left behind to the slow death of neglect. He'd not have the dignity of decay, but at least his body would be spared the same punishment as his soul.
"Oh, not now!" He grumbled as an unfamiliar owl stared at him questioningly from outside his window. He hurried over to let the owl inside, giving it a treat and shooing it away. He'd read the message now and respond later. It was probably the American Ministry sending over preliminary instructions.
He hadn't meant to run into Potter. He was taking his nightly stroll around the Hogwarts grounds, brooding, as one does when one's entire worldview was shattered whilst barely avoiding Azkaban due to the mercy of one's former enemy.
Malfoy nodded. "I understand, Potter. It does that to me, too. C'mon," he grabbed Harry by the arm and started to pull him out of the room, Harry's legs willingly following.
The healer pressed her lips together. "I'll leave you to gather yourself for a few minutes, but I'll be back soon to ask you more about that potion, and next steps from there, alright?"
Harry raced back to his ship. As he turned the keys and felt the engine growl back to life, a surge of adrenaline coursed through his body. He firmly steered the ship into the air and broke through Kuragin's atmosphere with a pop, racing through the sky.
Draco gave him a pleased smile that made Harry's insides flip. "Alright then, Harry, I'll see you tomorrow."
Harry thought of his motel room. He thought of his car and his duffel bag with the calendar and the journal and the pen.
As they ate dinner, looking out over the city, Harry gave him a cheeky grin. "So, tell me, how'd I do?"
Draco moved their hips to the slow beat, walking around the stage and trying to gracefully pick up the tips being thrown onto the stage, much more practiced in these cherry red stilettos than they'd been at the beginning of their career performing as Tarasque.
"C'mon! It's coming!" Harry called behind him as he ran up the steps of the Ministry building. The crowd was screaming in terror as it swarmed in its escape out of the building, but he pushed through the mob to make his way up to the top.
Draco scoffed. "You don't know that, You kept me out of Azkaban, but even you can't save me if I get into trouble again."
Still, locals say Draco Malfoy's ghost still wanders up and down the beach, leaving a trail in the sand. Some people claim to hear him calling his lover's name, his shouts whispered in the wind.
Finally, to Draco Malfoy, I leave your wand (thanks for that by the way), and this snitch. It's not too late.
When guilt and depression and sadness had Draco in their clutches, Harry’s arms were an anchor to reality, the whispers in Draco’s ear were a soothing balm to his scarred and wounded mind, the optimism a relief to his tender heart.
Malfoy nodded before turning away, stopping when Harry, acting on impulse, reached out and grabbed his arm.
Harry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "I'm not nearly patient or knowledgable to explain the concept of chemistry to you, Draco, that's like asking what magic is."
“Don’t care. Get in here, he’s on my couch.” She turned and walked away purposefully, and Harry trailed behind her.
Potter sighed. “Fine, but someone cast a sobering spell on you first. I’m not letting you get near me with anything sharp while you’re tipsy.”
60 days, they'd been on the road: him, Harry and Teddy. If you'd told him a year ago that this was how he'd be spending the first 60 days after Voldemort's victory in the war, he'd have called you loonier than Trewlany.
Harry took a deep breath and pulled the box out of his pocket, watching as Draco's eyes widened, his lips parting slightly in shock.
Steeling himself, he approached it and opened it slowly, filled with relief at the sight of his mother through the cracks.
You watch his hands from across the room, see him grip his pint with the fingers and hands that have been on you, in you. You see him tilt his head back and laugh, elongating the neck you've traced with your tongue, careful not to leave marks that would last until the morning.
Sighing with relief at his solitude, he approached the railing and leaned against it, looking out over the city. It was busy tonight, the classical music from inside the ballroom contrasting with the symphony of traffic below. He resisted the urge to cast a
Draco narrowed his eyes. "I'm sorry, have we met?" He held out a hand. "Hi, I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, and I've never cooked a day in my life."
10. This list—everything I know about him—is useless. I have all of this love and nowhere to put it, because he doesn’t want it anymore.
He needed some air. He turned to Astoria to let her know of his whereabouts, only to find her a few feet away and mingling with her coworkers in the Department of Mysteries. He took the moment to slip into the crowd, confident that he was unseen as he made his way onto the hopefully empty balcony.
Draco bit his lip, twirling his fork into his pasta. "Will you tell me more about Muggle chemistry?"
Draco smiled. Lyssa and Geoffrey had been two of the early supporters of his hunger program at WDKMUS, a business partnership that had grown into friendship over the last few years. “No, I’m afraid not. My...dinner companion made the reservation, but I’d love to  sit at my usual table, if possible.”
Draco refused to hear it, suffer through it anymore. This moment would scar more deeply and painfully than the ones Potter'd left across his chest. His skin wasn't enough; no, Potter had to slash through Draco's heart, as well.
She was a girl with the intelligence of a Ravenclaw and the emotional capacity of a Hufflepuff. A truly dangerous combination.
Harry's chest constricted. He pulled Draco close to himself and stroked his hair, letting the other man cry his fears into his shirt.
My fingers tangle themselves in his hair, bringing his lips to mine. The wall is solid and cool on my back. Harry presses me up against it, trapping me there like he’s afraid that I want to leave—as if I wouldn’t stretch this moment into eternity if I could.
Draco sputtered, searching his pockets until he found his identification card and handed it to the man for his scrutiny. The man pursed his lips as he looked over the card and then handed it to Draco with a grunt and a nod. Draco took that as permission and walked the rest of the way in.
Voldemort smirked. “Only trying to give you the childhood memories you never had, Potter. It’s the least I can do, really.”
Draco exhaled, shaking his hands at his sides to release some of the nervous energy coursing through his body, his blood. Harry took his hands in his own, squeezing them gently.
He checked his watch and resisted the urge to tap his foot against the leg of the stool upon which he was perched. He'd been sitting in front of the cell for seven minutes, and neither of them had said a word. And while Draco loved a silent game of chicken as much as the next proud Slytherin, he also had no desire to spend his free time staring at the man he would've been if it wasn't for Harry.
And you won't miss me. Oh, you might think you do. You'll miss the dutiful, terrified, and loving son. You'll miss the boy who made you his hero. You'll miss the person I was when you liked me, the person who earned your smiles.
Draco sighed. He took a moment to sip his tea, and then he looked at Harry. "I'll tell you what. If we fight, and I don't return, send an owl, Floo or contact you in some way within six hours, you can send out a bloody search party."
Suddenly, the door was opened and then promptly slammed shut. “Honestly, the nerve of these people. If he needs bed rest, then where is better than his own bed? Is my Healer degree rendered meaningless the moment I’m off the clock?” Draco muttered, running a hand through his hair as he paced the room angrily.
This is how I like you best, asleep on the couch. You told me to be quiet, or there'd be consequences. You told me not to leave my room; to make my footsteps into the weightless movement of a ghost. But this is how I want to remember you: gentle and warm and unguarded.
Potter shook his head. "Why would I love you? You've been a bully for six years, Malfoy. I hate you."
It could also be the fact that "Potter" had become "Harry" in just a few short weeks after the war, not to mention Draco's lack of discretion when he left the Manor late at night to meet Harry, whisked away on the back of the other man's motorcycle.
shame, the evidence of which you will carry for the rest of your life, and I will atone for it for just as long.
He landed with a thud on a balcony. After a crack, Harry appeared next to him, gasping to catch his breath for a moment.
away. She and Harry looked at one another for a moment, and she allowed hurt-filled green eyes to assess her.
He closed his eyes, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his skin. He’d have to get the notes he missed from Pansy, who undoubtedly had questions about his brusque dismissal after class. But he’d had to get away from her. She’d become far too nosy, far too comfortable minding Draco’s business.
“O-of course only if you’re comfortable. I trust you and I love you and I get it if it’s too much and—”
This is the only place, the only way, I can think of you. When I'm out there, outside this door, I'm constantly fighting mental images of you. And when it becomes too much to bear, I remember our fights, the ones where I saw genuine sadness flash in your eyes instead of just irritation. It's painful to remember, every time, but if the Dark Lord decides to look into my mind at any given moment, I need him to see your hurt instead of my regret. Because if he knew the way I think about you, he'd make sure I never think again.
Draco's heart skipped a beat. He nodded and scooted forward, wrapping his arms around Potter's midsection, feeling toned muscles and warm skin under his thin t-shirt.
Draco had to admit, the redesign was an improvement. The jade green of the S inlay stood out against the silver doors of the locket.
“Hello, sir, may I help you?” Draco turned his head at the interjection to see Lyssa looking at Potter expectantly.
Father snarls. “Don’t lie to me, boy! I knew you were acting strange. I assumed it was nerves before the wedding. Turns out you’ve had a secret little coping mechanism in your bed!”
Over an hour. Over an hour he'd been waiting for Harry to return home. He was beginning to get hot in his tailored suit, despite the cooling charms.
Starting at this age, you're going to learn to trust your inner voices rather than the one that sounds distinctly like Father. You'll listen to that voice when it tells you to lower your wand in the Astronomy Tower. You'll listen to it when it tells you not to give Potter up at the Manor. You'll listen when it tells you to apologize, to keep your head down, to go back to Hogwarts—to unlearn the lessons of the old voice.
The other person, who had short blonde hair and blue eyes smiled at him. "Good to meet you, I'm Claire."
Since then, they’d created something truly tasteful and modern out of the old, stuffy rubbish. Silver, Cori, and Claire had been instrumental in helping Draco and Harry find comfortable and beautiful furniture, while still paying some homage to the original design. They left the same dining room table since both Harry and Draco had to admit it was quite regal. They also kept the Black family tapestry, moving it to a room at the back of the house they used to store things they didn’t care to look at every day but couldn’t bear to throw or give away. Finally, the appliances were old but usable after some restoring spells, and now they were shiny and working perfectly.
Draco needn’t look further than the man next to him, tangible and real, for what he used to seek beyond the clouds.
“That’s not true.” My voice is low and miraculously steady, belying my nerves. “We love each other, Father, and just because you and Mother chose to spend your lives in a sham of a marriage doesn’t mean I have to.” The words spill from my lips like a secret I’d kept from myself, but the truth tastes sweet and satisfying on my tongue.
Now, he navigates the teeming crowd, his mind hazy with memories. Beyond the fog, a star speeds across the sky.
I’ll know where you are. If you take this cloak off or cancel the spell, I’ll know. You have two days. In forty-eight hours and one second, you’re done.”
He had discovered some very important information, too. He knew how Potter’s cheeks flushed a bit when he laughed. He knew how Potter grinned and stood a little straighter after he mastered a spell in Defense. He knew how to tell if Potter was anxious by how much he ran his fingers through his truly disastrous hair. He’d all but memorized how much brighter Potter’s green eyes were when he was confident—and even more so when he was angry. Sometimes, Draco liked teasing Potter just so he could see those glinting eyes trained on him; so that he could have an excuse to look at them, to sink into them.
“Lovegood?” Lucius Malfoy tightened his dressing gown around his waist with one hand, using his other to point his feeble, Ministry-granted wand in the other.
Harry Potter wasn’t standing near the fountain in Washington Square Park, looking around like a confused puppy.
Draco was still shocked, and Harry felt irrational, intense fear well up inside him before Draco's face broke out into a teary smile.
But now, I spend my days in my Junior Auror office, which is blessedly empty since no one wanted to work with the former Death Eater. Solitude suits me just fine, a sentiment which, I would wager, you share. Funny, how we are connected by a tolerance, or even enjoyment, of isolation.
Pansy calls late at night. I hold back my wince at the sight of her red-rimmed eyes and puffy cheeks. She makes up a story of some man who'd run from her bed, but I know she sheds tears over the nightmares that won't leave it.
Harry felt tears prick at the back of his eyes. "No one's ever...no one's done anything like this for me before," he said quietly.
“You don’t think the Ministry is aware? We’re going all we can to track down the wanted Death Eaters.”
Draco strode outside, walking briskly past students milling about in the courtyard now that classes were finished for the day. He kept moving until the others were out of sight, stopping when he finally reached the Black Lake.
Luna frowned. “I am sorry, it wasn’t my intention.” She bent to kiss him lightly on the cheek and walked to the kitchen, putting down the groceries she’d brought to cook for the night.
Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, it was. Now, unless there was a reason you called me over here, I was just heading to my flat, and—”
Draco turned onto his side and looked past his curtains out at the window near his bed. He wondered if he would ever be able to choose for himself, or if his life was just one more thing he inherited. The stars winked at him in the night sky, iridescent and golden.
“I said no! You had your chance to ask for forgiveness, for redemption, for protection. Gods, I should’ve known you’d never keep your word. Once a wolf, always a wolf, right?
It wasn’t like a flower sprouting through the earth, or the sun peering through the clouds; it couldn’t be compared to a bullet piercing the air and rupturing its target, or jumping from a waterfall into a crystal blue lake.
You look so peaceful like this. The harsh lines of your thinning face are relaxed, your piercing stare is shaded by your eyelids, your unclenched fists are guns with empty chambers.
As he reached for the vial that afternoon, it was to remind himself of the priceless love he sold for the price of his heart.
The pieces landed in the water, floating away as useless kindling. He looked at Draco's proud smile.
Stolen glances from across the common room, brushing hands as they pass in the hallway, inside jokes snuck into mundane group conversations with oblivious outsiders.
Tonight was about Draco taking and Harry giving what they both wanted. Tonight was about sweet surrender, about conquer and being conquered willingly and wholly.
He fumbled with the room key, cursing under his breath when it slipped from his nervous fingers. It finally opened and he stumbled in, almost falling on the rug.
Draco closed his eyes, blindly reaching for Harry's hand. One more day of feeling displaced, being lost in a new country. One more day until they were at their new home, with their new family, starting their new life.
Draco closed his eyes to stop the room from spinning. "My head is killing me and I'm dizzy, but I'm okay. What happened?"
It made Harry want to laugh; he wasn't sure if he should dismiss the theory that Draco had some clone of himself made for the sole purpose of attending these events and putting on a show of blissful, perfect domesticity while his real self scowled and sniped at Harry.
Draco jumped, turning to see a half-naked man in his bed. Said man was sleeping on his stomach, but Draco only needed to see the messy black hair, tanned skin and the curve of his spine to know who it was.
1. He loves treacle tart, to the point that he will forego dinner when it is offered alongside legitimate food for his meal. He will eat his dessert last like a dignified human in any other circumstances but show him treacle tart and he can’t help but dig right in.
Harry woke to the sound of muffled voices shouting at each other and the constant beep of a monitor.
Harry woke with a gasp, sweat beading on his forehead. A hand scrubbed over his face as he wiped the sleep from his eyes and felt his four-poster ground him to reality.
Ginny nodded, nudging Pansy with her arm until Pansy grunted her assent, glaring half-heartedly at Ginny, who smiled and pecked her on the cheek. Pansy blushed.
Harry watched with a small smile as Malfoy and his mother sat together, their cool masks wavering with emotion for just a second before shifting back into place.
Harry grabbed him by his sopping shirt and pulled him in for a kiss that warmed them both to their cores.
Harry watched as Malfoy froze, his hands gripping the wood; the other boy let out a low, deep chuckle as he drew his wand and turned around to face Harry.
Harry bit his lip. "Astoria found you unconscious on your couch. She brought you here and then she, well...She called me."
"I love you," Draco said panting. "I can't get married to someone if I don't love them, I refuse. I refuse to make my parents' mistakes. And as I sat there in the Manor, talking quietly with Astoria about the plans for tomorrow, I just realized that if I went through with it I'd be doing this for the rest of my life.
"You don't think I understand that? Of course I do! I can't fault you for being a loyal partner, Harry, but running into a hostage situation without calling for backup is the absolute dumbest thing you could've done! You nearly died!"
Draco cringed as memories from the previous night came in flashes. Being stood up by his blind date and going to the Leaky to drink his sorrows away. Running into Potter, who'd met his half-hearted insults with mirthful, bright green eyes and easy grins. Being persuaded into joining Potter at his table in the corner. Talking the evening away, trading light banter and stolen glances and tentative, friendly touches. Having too many shots of firewhiskey and Potter offering to see him home safely.
I watch my father lose his mind in Azkaban, eventually being carted off to the Janus Thickey Ward. I watch my mother's hands grip her suitcase tightly, her knuckles white on the handle as she kisses my cheek. She tells me to "be good" and to visit her in the south of France. I watch the portkey take her.
He reached into his frayed pocket, retrieving his wand. He smiled when the magic still responded to his lifeless form, the force just as supple and bright as the day he tasted power for the first time.
Draco pressed his lips together and gave a resigned sigh. “I assume you already have a name picked out?”
They called her Loony. They called her a nutter. They called her batty and quirky and strange. She didn’t mind it, really, or take it too personally. But while she could understand not seeing the Blibbering Humdingers or the Umgubular Slashkilters or the Dabberblimps, how could they talk of reform and the future when it was clear to see that the world hadn’t changed?
Draco shook his head and smirked. "No, Harry," he raised the glass of wine to his lips. "I'd never do that."
But I promise to give you the avocado from my sandwich. I promise to try to remember the spells you taught me, and to use my manipulative powers for good and not evil. I promise I'll use better judgment in the field. And I promise I'll try to be on time.
In school, he'd been a "speccy git," a "stupid tosser," a "half-blood prat," and an "idiot Gryffindor."
Voldemort glared—or he would’ve if his eyes weren’t already snake-like slits. “And see, here I thought you might want to spend your final moments playing a little game.”
She frowned at him in slight disapproval. “I can’t manipulate another journalist, Harry; besides, that would be unethical for them to reveal an anonymous source. And anyway, I don’t know any of them, so I’m afraid I’m not of much help to you.”
And this was one of his favorite parts of the night: getting into drag. He had a little extra time tonight, having decided to get ready at his and Harry’s house rather than at the club.
I remember glancing at you, once I decided to hang it up anyway, to see if you'd noticed. You had, of course; you're observant that way. You raised an eyebrow, but you didn't say anything. I knew you were filing it away, keeping it as ammunition for our next fight. Why is it that we were always preparing for war during times of peace?
Where are you? Are you in the sky? Beyond the veil? With my parents and Remus? On my shoulder? Or are you here, alive and sitting in the living room, and I simply forgot?
Okay, so! I never planned on adding to this series, but my friend submitted the @drarrymicrofic prompt "discord," and her support for this series is so sweet and wonderful that when I thought of this idea, I knew I had to write it.
Harry knelt down to see where Draco'd indicated and nearly fell back with a gasp. 'James & Lily 4ever' was carved into the trunk of the tree surrounded by a heart.
“Can I help you?” Malfoy drawled, “Or do you mind taking your boisterous conversation elsewhere? I was here first.”
Malfoy pursed his lips. "I think a couple of dates in Hogsmeade, sitting with each other's friends at meals, and some hand-holding should be plenty. No need to snog or anything--such a stark difference in our interactions will do the trick. Then we just gradually spend less time together and they'll assume we're broken up and by then they'll be used to not harrassing us."
Malfoy let out a laugh. "I don't think anyone would question that. Most people claim you're either dead or you've fucked off to the Muggle world—which is true enough, I suppose, they just think you're still on the continent."
Finally, after yet another night of hearing about how 'clearly besotted he is with you Harry, you're so lucky,' he'd had enough.
"I see love. I see kindness, and strength. I see humor and bravery. Yes, I see your adorably messy hair and gorgeous eyes. But when you wake up and it's static-y and sticking up everywhere, that's yours. The fire in your eyes when you duel, or the twinkle in them when you're laughing, or the way they light up when you're excited. That's yours, Harry. That's what I and everyone else who loves you sees. And that's all that matters."
Pain, blinding and sharp and burning raced through his body, his bones, his nerves. He started a new letter in his head, wishing beyond all rationality that Potter could read it.
I feel you constantly, your eyes on me. I yearn to touch you, to let myself fall into you, easily and with abandon. Every step I take away from you sends me further into withdrawal, an emotional purge from a Harry Potter addiction.
Blonde hair fell fanned out against the blanket and glittering gray eyes looked up at Harry. "Minerva let me into the wards just for the night."
Draco blushed. “Oh, er, it’s a word I picked up from a friend of mine. It means, basically, a long or difficult journey somewhere. For example, we’d schlep up the stairs to the Astronomy Tower.”
He didn't need to hear the cackle to confirm where the rope had come from, but it certainly squashed any doubt he might've had.
Harry smirked. A flick of his hand unlocked the bathroom with a click, followed by the soft crack of Apparition, unheard by the oblivious Muggles over the thumping music.
Tarasque stepped down from the stage and toward Harry, smirking when the man's eyes widened slightly.
“No you won’t,” Harry’s smirk widened as he crossed his arms in challenge. “Admit: you think it’s romantic.”
Voldemort’s mouth twisted into what was probably supposed to be a grin. “Truth or dare. I think you might be familiar with it?”
"Love, breathe, " Harry's voice was steady, patient. "Come home, alright? I have spaghetti carbonara nearly finished for you. Let's talk about it in person so I can hold you, okay?"
But then Harry was at his side, rubbing comforting circles into Draco’s back and pulling him into strong, firm arms.
He hoisted the body up and dropped it unceremoniously into the empty grave. It lay there, limp and frozen.
But now, everyone was moving on, seemingly waiting around for change to come, for prejudice to dissolve into the air like the sparks from Harry’s
Draco folded the parchment and left it in the middle of his desk. He got up from his desk chair and climbed into bed, the unhealed paper cuts on his hands forgotten.
Now, they smiled at Harry, who grinned and raised his beer in a silent toast. Normally, Harry might be chatting with Draco's friends, but he had his own table, sitting across from an empty chair, waiting patiently for Draco to be done.
Draco rolled his eyes and walked toward Harry. "You don't need me to remind you of how handsome you are, do you? Trust me, I wouldn't date someone ugly."
She nodded. “I’m training to be a professional stylist, after all, and if I can tame your hair, I can tackle anything. Besides, I’m good. Really good.”
"I was trying to be brave!" Draco's lower lip wobbled. "I was trying to act on my feelings, follow my heart and all that Gryffindor crap!"
Harry throws his arm over his eyes, his head throbbing. He rubs a hand over his face, the stubble feeling foreign on his cheeks. But Draco isn't there to tell him to shave, or to pick up after himself, or to dry water when it spills on wooden floors.
While I wait, I like to watch the tables and chairs be filled and emptied, changing like the tide. The diligent waitstaff cleans each surface in between seatings; the crumbs are swept up and tabletops are covered with starch-white cloths. My own table is littered with shards of glass and stained with tears and alfredo sauce and the traces of passing time.
Harry's jaw tightened, the hand holding his outstretched wand trembling slightly. "You don't have to do this."
Draco passed through the streets of DUMBO, only superficially familiar with his surroundings after having walked by the charming shops and attractions. It was for tourists, and for families of old American money who lived in nearby Brooklyn Heights and secretly wanted to reside in a mansion in some sleepy Northeastern town but their pride kept them on the island.
Draco breathed deeply, relishing the air and the rise and fall of his chest. He gazed up at the sky, the vast firmament above him; fear unclenched its freezing fingers from around his heart.
Harry had a million questions. Why was Draco here? Was he alright? Why didn't he use an umbrella charm? What happened with Astoria? Was he drunk?
Malfoy chuckled. "Well spotted Pott—" his words were cut off with a gasp when Harry squeezed his arse through the leather trousers. Harry felt a jolt run through his blood when his hand felt no layer of fabric between tight leather and hot skin.
"Don't be nervous, kid, you'll be fine. We're a family," they gestured to the other people in the room.
He let his eyes wander over to the Gryffindor table, eyebrows raising when he saw Potter’s forced smile as he politely engaged with interrupting fans. Granger and Weasley were regarding him sympathetically, as Potter shrugged at his friends in silent apology.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “I wouldn’t have offered if I couldn’t handle it, Potter. I’m not a weakling.”
He checks his forearm once more to make sure the glamour is still holding and, seeing Potter standing alone, adjusts the silver Colombina mask on his face and approaches him.
Malfoy licked and suckled his cock with abandon, and Harry opened his eyes when he felt Malfoy's hand move Harry's from his shoulder to place it in his soft, silky hair. Harry moaned and took the hint, gripping his hair and thrusting into his mouth, making Malfoy swallow him almost to the hilt.
Malfoy closed his eyes. Finally, his chest rose in a deep breath. He exhaled, his lips forming the word "Hi," just before his body stilled.
Of course, I don't know how you feel with regards to me, other than the confession of some romantic emotions when we first accidentally used this linked journal. But this is me trying to learn from you how to be more gracious, bolder. One step at a time, right?
“No, Draco, we’ve got to go home,” Harry walked up to the couch. His breath caught when gray eyes blinked wide and pleadingly up at him.
Draco couldn't cry, so he let the sky do it for him. He shivered, soaking it up like the grass crushed under the shirt clinging to him like a second skin. He closed his eyes, imagining that the drops sliding down his face were the tears he couldn't muster, the catharsis he hadn't earned.
Nor are you all that good at picking up on social cues—that is, of course, assuming you're not blatantly ignoring them in favor of stalking me.
A hand clasped his wrist and spun him around. Luckily, Draco was able to keep his features impassive against Potter’s wild, desperate expression. Draco stood there, letting Potter hold his wrist and hold his gaze with beseeching green eyes.
But right now, watching Potter be with someone—conspicuous and unashamed—Draco could only feel the icy grip of regret around his heart.
It was full of teeth and adorably crooked, the easy grin Harry gave him over his shoulder as they continued their journey into the night.
Malfoy stuck out his hand automatically and then immediately seemed to regret it, his eyes widening. Still, he kept his hand out, committing to the gesture.
wants to print, it wasn’t some dramatic falling out. We just realized we liked being friends more than we liked being a couple. We love each other, but not like a married couple is supposed to.”
He hadn’t appreciated Hogwarts’s rolling hills and cool breezes until eighth year, when he and Harry reclined on the ground and counted the stars until they reached infinity. He’d marveled at the expanse of twinkling lights above them when Harry’d gasped.
Harry burst out laughing, and Draco frowned. “As if that’s anything new! Draco, I want us to fight, I want us to make up, I want us to have good days and shitty days and days in between. Besides, there isn’t much either of us can do in a fight that we haven’t already done, is there?”
The stars at Hogwarts had been breathtaking, too. Harry would never forget the nights he had dragged Draco outside to talk and watch the sky without the constant hum of other students chattering in the Great Hall or even their respective friends’ interruptions and knowing looks.
He moved to get up, but Malfoy's hand gently covered the back of Harry's hand, nimble fingers touching the words carved into his skin. "Promise me, Harry," he whispered so softly Harry could hardly hear him.
It seemed enough for Potter, who smiled and turned back around on Taygete's back, allowing Draco to reassume his position behind him.
Before, he would seek refuge in his own insignificance by gazing at the sparkling night sky; but now, the peace he needs is obscured by smog and steel.
Draco bit his lip. "We were in an accident. You were driving us--we're using a Mug--a car because the suspect is--"
Here, in my corner, I wait for you, unable to do anything else. I wonder if you have red-haired children to make angels in the snow and if your wife plucks budding flowers from the ground. I wonder if you make lemonade for the hot sun and watch the first casualty of autumn drift from its delicate branch.
I don't want to argue, I don't want to confront you. I don't want to list all the ways you failed as a father and a husband and a human being.
Harry stepped off the ship and relished the way his boot left a footprint. He smirked as he surveyed the area: empty and ripe with potential. To the untrained eye, the planet would look like a wasteland. But the greatest kingdoms could be built from nothing but rubble. The Minister would be pleased; with some charmwork, this would make for a great expansion site.
Harry shrugged. "Yeah, I mean we work well together when they pair Aurors with Unspeakables, and I--I like you."
But then one test turned into two. Before he knew it, Draco spent the better part of his days coming in and out of deep periods of sleep, reaching for the vial every time his eyes opened to the sight of his empty flat, his engagement band on the coffee table next to him.
Harry stepped out onto the Quidditch field, broom in hand and face set in determination. At the blow of the whistle, he kicked off, already searching for the tiny, fluttering Snitch.
Draco's expression was comically strange; he stared at Harry for a full twenty seconds before he let out a short, sharp laugh. "You are joking, right?"
Some days, Narcissa glanced longingly at the fireplace, replaying in her mind the sight of Draco, with tear-streaked cheeks and shaking hands laced with hers.
harry stands, his own cock straining in his jeans. He unzips harry's fly and takes him out of his pants, jerking him off quickly, mechanically.
"It's the Floo address of a Mind Healer. They'll be able to help you find...well, some other way to help your mental health."
They began with primer, smoothing their face and making it ready for the foundation, which came next to even their skin tone. They used the brush to blend the makeup, down their neck and chest and up to their temples.
Harry looked up to see Ron looking grimly at him and holding out the Prophet. Harry shivered; if that old rag actually had a trustworthy story, there was little doubt as to its subject.
4. He’s so much more creative than he lets on. He loves making little doodles of imaginary characters in his notebooks. I asked him about it once when we were sitting under the tree by the water, and he said it was just something he’d pictured in his mind, an image he had to get on parchment.
The light swelled inside of the ghost, which groaned and sputtered. Suddenly, the ghost burst, staining everything with green slime.
Voldemort had spent years whispering in Harry's ear, telling him lies, showing him visions of disturbing torture and murder to the point that whispering made Harry frantic, defensive.
"Watch where you're going, Scarhead." Malfoy sneered at Harry, bumping their shoulders together as they passed by.
It was, of course, at the great expense of my parents, but it was the least they could do, considering it was their choice to put me in harm's way.
Potter frowns, almost pouting. "You have free will, don't you? You could be inside at the party, watching her show off the ring and talking about venues. But instead, here you are,” he says. “With me."
For the second time that night, Draco could only gape at Potter, who apparently took that as an opportunity to speak again.
The only warning Draco had was the split second when He reached up and flicked open the locket doors to reveal a living eye with a green pupil, a ring of silver wrapped around it.
Draco hesitated at first, but he nodded. And if Harry let his hand linger lightly on Draco’s back when they headed toward the Floo, they could both chalk it up to a safety measure.
Draco watched as Potter turned away, and he really ought to give his hand a stern talking to for reaching out to grab Potter’s arm. “Wait.”
The earth was dry beneath his dirt-caked fingertips as he clawed his way through the soil, pulling himself up and out of the grave he'd known for longer than he could remember.
Before, the idea of facing Voldemort head-on, once and for all, seemed like something abstract, yet inevitable. He'd known on some level since fourth year that it would come to this, but with all the sleepless nights and odd meetings with Dumbledore and finding out about the prophecy last year, it was becoming increasingly clear that only he or Voldemort would come out of the war alive. Before, the idea of taking a life, of killing someone, was so abhorrent and unthinkable that Harry had never let himself come to terms with the possibility.
Then I saw a man with long, bright blonde hair standing in the middle of a nearly empty field in Romania.
Harry, I love you; I've been in love with you since the day we met, but I think I realized it around fourth year.
He was exhausted from crying. That's all he seemed to be able to do, these past few days. He was lucky to have some time off from work, summer hols at Hogwarts and all that, because having the Defense professor greet his class with red-rimmed eyes and smelling like firewhiskey wouldn't be a very good example to set for the next generation of wizards.
But Potter shook his head. "We're fine, I promise Taygete won't let us fall. Why are you crying? If you're scared I can bring you back, I—"
Father taught him that no one achieves great power without selfishness; he’d learned that the only way to reach new heights was to put one’s interests first and foremost, and that success was found only by those who were willing to let others fear them.
His hair black as the night, his eyes twinkling emerald stars, his smile a beaming moon, his heart a soaring reminder of hope, of possibility.
"Her name's Taygete," Potter had explained when Draco had stood there, gaping. "Don't, er, tell anyone about this. Hagrid lets me take her for a ride when I...need a break..." Potter's voice softens and trails off.
Harry grinned, shaking his head fondly. “Hm, maybe I’ll ask Luna, see if she has any reporter friends at the
Later, they would clean up the glitter, the scattered bottles, melted candle wax, and discarded polaroids. Together.
Other than the standard wand and lasso, Draco Malfoy's Explorer uniform was unlike Harry's own. While Hogwarts required its Explorers to wear black steel-toed boots, trousers, a button-down shirt, and a badge, it seemed that Explorers from Truiepets dressed in a uniform reminiscent of old English military garb. While it lacked all the same accouterments and the iconic red color, the striking midnight blue military-style waistcoat, black trousers, and high boots gave the rival Explorers a much more posh, distinguished look than Harry's own country demanded.
He rolled his eyes at the inner Draco in his mind and practically dove toward his suitcase. He ripped open the main zipper searching every crevice, every pocket he could see.
Suddenly, the door burst open from its hinges. From the smoke and debris, a dragon hide boot stepped through the threshold.
But now, I need to discover who and what I am in this world after having lost almost everything I've ever known. I need to separate myself from my Father, and my goals from my obligations; I cannot do that around the one person whose very presence makes me forget how to breathe, how to think of anything else but him.
Because I'm not there, am I? I'm tucked away in the shadows, right? I should be ineffectual, emasculated, soul sucked from my body by Dementors that ravage me.
To Molly and Arthur Weasley, I leave all of the contents of the Potter vaults. Thank you for accepting me into your family and being the guardians I never had.
"Yes. I asked you not to do anything stupid. I asked you not to impulsively put yourself in harm's way."
A new fear suddenly clenched in his chest. He was such an idiot. The moment Taygete touched the ground again, the Aurors would swarm and arrest him, because surely he was violating the terms of his parole. And Potter would merely be seen as the victim of Draco's attempted kidnapping, or nefarious manipulation.
Lyssa smiled. “Ah, you’re joining Mr. Malfoy. If you gentlemen would please follow me. Draco, we have your usual table ready for you.”
Draco let out a shaky sigh, looking at Harry with hopeful eyes as he nodded. “Okay, you’re right. I’m worried for nothing.”
Malfoy turned, and Harry acted on impulse and reached and gently grasped his wrist. Malfoy looked at him in surprise.
“I am sorry, ma’am, but we’ve not received any new bodies in the last few days.” The owner had wrung his hands during his anxious apology. “Perhaps you might check the potter’s field? I’m very sorry for your loss.”
Tomorrow, I'll wake up wrapped in Harry's arms, warm in his bed. I'll make tea and he'll turn on the wireless.
Potter lifted his head, stirring from his sleep and blinking blearily. Draco braced himself for the impending wide eyes and scream of shock and disgust, but it never came.
Draco huffed. "Well, I was just saying that there's an incredible potions apprenticeship at this brewery in Diagon, and--"
8. He’s the biggest dork I know. He’s constantly making strange jokes and puns, and he always has some odd new activity he wants to try. He roped me into making a hybrid of a cake and a tart and I’d never admit it but I’ve kept the recipe all these years.
“Can I help you?” Draco drawled, “Or do you mind taking your boisterous conversation elsewhere? I was here first.”
Ron knit his eyebrows. “But she’s still a wanted criminal! What about the trial for the crimes she did commit?”
Footsteps approached and he felt a presence come up next to him. He resolutely did not look, keeping his eyes fixed on the view from the balcony.
Harry looked out the window at the night sky and wondered if happiness would be a constant thrum under his skin, or if it could be found in stolen moments tucked into his heart. The stars glittered in silent answer, shining with anticipation.
I glance and see the piece of paper with Potter's Floo address written in his scrawl. That one hastily torn scrap gives me more joy, more excitement than one word I've painstakingly written here.
Lucius's voice was rough from lack of use. "Boyfriend?" He spat, his tone impressively derisive for a man with no reason for pride. "No son of mine is bent."
“Draco Malfoy, you are hereby sentenced to three months house arrest, followed by one year of probation,” Minister Shacklebolt banged the gavel, the sound reverberating in the large room before chatter rose from the avid audience.
He took a step forward, trying to get a closer look and wishing the blonde man would turn his head even slightly from where he was dancing with a tall, fit, brunette bloke.
Malfoy shrugged elegantly. “If I say it out loud, maybe my mind will stop feeling like a fork in a Muggle garbage disposal.”
"Potter? You alright there? You've been staring blankly into space for a bit now, which I thought was merely your brain recovering from being used for the first time in a few years, but now I'm concerned."
Lying in bed that evening, Draco realized that he’d always bought into the legend of Harry Potter. He’d seen exactly what the world did: a boy hero who vanquished evil and lived to tell the tale, over and over again. As jealous as he’d been of Potter, and as much as he’d wanted to push Potter off his pedestal, it never occurred to him that Potter hadn’t put himself there.
The other boy hesitated for a moment. His face shifted to one of determination as he stepped toward Harry and clasped their hands together, their arms now connected to form a single line between them.
"Just a moment, dear!" A stout woman with a kind face grinned at him before returning to her customer, a blonde boy, who Harry glanced at briefly before perusing the shop.
He wasn’t sure when it started. Maybe it began when Harry extended his hand in friendship at the opening banquet in Eighth Year. Or perhaps it was when they were in potions and Harry asked him to pass the moondew and their fingers brushed. It could have been when Harry’s approached him at a Muggle bar with a determined gleam in his eye and a quiet, “
I do things now, like talk to Granger and spend late nights hunched over my isolated desk and get excited about Muggle scientific theory because I refuse to believe that your case is cold--not when the warmth of your magic clings to a bench in Diagon.
The questions continued, and there were a few revelations. Millicent had read Muggle books behind her parents’ backs. Finnegan did a handstand, which was impressive given his intoxicated state. Granger and Weasley divulged that they had—
And with the way Granger was currently penetrating his very soul with just a look, he felt compelled to acquiesce.
Potter sat up a little higher, his eyes flashing with excitement at the promise of a challenge. “Dare,” he said, without missing a beat.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed. “Really, you don’t have anyone who you could talk to, get them to give us a name?”
Draco sighed. “Alright, Potter. Meet me outside your hotel at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Get some rest––tomorrow will be a long day.”
Harry, who was waiting for him at home. Harry, who loved hearing Draco's stories of petty revenge against Lucius; delighted in them, in fact.
By now, walking from the subway exit to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade was hardly strenuous. And as Draco approached the railing, looking out over the black iron fence at the river and the lights of the financial district, a sense of wistfulness washed over him.
Every time he turned the key to a new motel room, with every acquaintance he loved for a night, he remembered that none of it belonged to him; none of it was his responsibility. He had no home to clean, no job to slave over, and no friends or partner to demand accountability or companionship.
Harry groaned, rubbing their clothed cocks together and baring the side of his neck to Draco. "Draco, just do it."
Smoke pricked at his eyes, so he closed them, attempting to belie the suffocating heat with images of cool darkness. Perhaps he could pretend he was sleeping before he was denied eternal rest.
I really can't quite express how much this song means to me. Part of me wishes I'd heard it a few years ago, when I needed to hear this message more than ever. But it was at that time that I turned to Drarry for an escape. So it feels fitting, now, to get to try to do it justice.
But right now, watching Potter be with someone—conspicuous and unashamed—Draco could only feel the icy grip of regret around his heart.
Draco's head pounded in protest as he forced his eyes open against the streaming sunlight. He raised a feeble arm to defend against it, squinting and using the other hand to rub the sleep from his face.
Suddenly tired of the company of his peers, Draco mumbled a quick “See you later, Pans,” before pushing his way out of the classroom ahead of the other students. Pansy might have called after him, but he wasn’t sure, and either way, he didn't bother to check.
He snarls and tosses the parchment to the floor. I bend and pick it up, and my heart drops at the familiar handwriting.
Draco kissed him on the cheek, smirking at the red lipstick stain on his cheek before hopping off of his lap. Draco continued collecting tips from the audience as they made their way back up to the stage.
His ears were ringing too loudly, his eyes pressed too hard into his palms to notice footsteps entering the bathroom. He wasn't aware of another person's presence in the room until he was jerking away from a gentle touch to his shoulder.
I hate that I can only see you at night when your name is written in the sky. I like to think that you watch over me like you said you would. Do you remember that? When you said we'd be a "proper family" together?
Did you tell them how I died? Did you tell them about the pools of water mixing with my blood at your feet? Did you tell them about how you watched the remains of my tarnished soul leave my body with my last feeble breath?
Lying in bed that evening, Harry remembered the image of Malfoy at the Black Lake with his head tipped back in the sunlight. He thought of the rare smile Malfoy'd had when he held his wand for the first time after his trial, and the feeling that had bubbled up in his own chest at the sight.
I've no plans to leave, Draco, but I'm here for however long this lasts. For as long as you'll have me.
The door to Draco's room swung open. He jumped from his position at his desk, his heart dropping to his stomach when he saw Bellatrix's looming figure, her face twisted in her signature cross between a devilish grin and a sneer. He cast a quick Vanishing spell and his letter, his salvation, his one chance, disappeared into thin air.
He ended the levitation charm on his trunk and then shrunk it to fit into his pocket. He then walked along the cobblestone street and entered the bar.
All four of them switched on their proton streams. Ginny merged hers with Harry's first, followed by Pansy, and then finally Draco until they had made one bright stream of protons. Harry grunted as he aimed the stream toward the ghost, catching it in its path.
Draco hoped the flames would be kind enough to swallow him quickly, but with the way that the lifeless furniture and dusty baubles around him seemed to cry out in pain, he felt his skin prickle in anticipation.
A prompt I submitted for Drarry microfics! Dust and Ashes, from Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Then I'm to assume this is your doing?" he ran a finger over the collar at the cat's neck. Harry blushed.
But no matter what happens to me, I know you'll carry on. As long as you're alive, I think, there's some hope.
Draco clutched the bathroom sink, resenting the sight of his tears dropping onto the porcelain. He scowled when they didn't erode the porcelain, that they weren't acidic after burning in his eyes. How unfair that only he should be the only one to feel this pain.
"Here you are!" The woman handed the bundle into arms that Draco hadn't realized he'd offered. He took the baby carefully, grinning at Harry briefly before looking down at the new owner of his heart.
"Yeah. Told me I'd do well. But you'd been such an arse to Ron that I begged it to sort me anywhere else."
Harry's eyes fluttered shut, focused on the wet heat of the mouth around him. Malfoy explored his cock eagerly, running his tongue over the shaft and nearly up to the base before coming back down to tease the slit, coaxing out more precome and lapping it up.
Draco tried not to grimace as he climbed into a pathetic excuse for a bed. The comforter was more of a sheet than anything else, and the linens were like sandpaper against his delicate skin. He lay his head against the scratchy pillow and stared at a blank, foreign ceiling for the 60th night.
Potter blushed a little, ducking his head. "I'm alright. Just a little cut on my side, but I healed it."
When the two of them attended posh social events--Harry being dragged there either by Draco or his official obligations--and were temporarily separated, guests would
Just then, the woman came back into the office holding a bundle wrapped in a blue blanket, Draco knew his heart would never be his own again.
"Every time I tell people the foods I don't like, they get all indignant and huffy," Harry waved a hand. "It's so weird. Like I've offended them by disliking meringue."
Potter had left his flat early in the morning with an emergency work call. "Shit, I've got to go. I'll Owl you!" was all he said before he left in a hurry, just barely getting both his shoes on his feet.
Harry'd begun frequenting Draco's regular bar just a couple months after they'd started performing. Draco had been so shocked and frightened to see Potter that they nearly fell off the stage during their lip-sync.
Draco's breath caught as he stared at Potter, who held out his hand invitingly. It was everything Draco'd wanted since he was 11—the chance to take Potter's willingly offered hand in friendship, or more if he were ever so lucky.
Irritation rose in his chest at the memory of Malfoy insulting his new friend, Ron. Harry'd decided then that anyone who could look at Ron and decide to be so rude to him must be someone to avoid. He knew a bully when he saw one, and bullies, in his experience, didn't change.
Draco snorted. “We’re going in completely opposite directions, Potter. You really don’t know your way around here, do you?”
From across the club, Harry hadn't taken the time to admire Malfoy's outfit before storming toward him, but from up close, he was able to run his hands across the front of Malfoy's chest, surprised to note that the sheer button-down was undone all the way down near his navel. Malfoy bent over on the beat of the song and pressed up closer against him, giving Harry easy access to that firm, leather-clad arse. Harry’s eyes trailed down to admire Malfoy’s lean, long legs, accentuated by dragonhide boots. As Malfoy continued to grind his arse against Harry, he felt his cock stir in his trousers, starting to press against the zipper.
He shook himself. There was no need for sentimentality. He wasn’t a Hufflepuff—the Sorting ceremony had confirmed that just hours ago.
That's not true, yes I do. Of course, I do. I was there, near the middle of it all; not the epicenter, not the periphery, but somewhere within the nebulous part in-between. I was close enough to be scathed, to be one of the supporting characters—though I'm fairly certain my support was the problem—but I was neither protagonist nor antagonist.
The pounding at Harry’s door was incessant to the point that he knew he could no longer ignore it. With a sigh, he threw the covers off his body, resenting the chill that hit his legs and vowing to return to his cocoon as soon as the interloper had fled his wrath.
"Did you really expect me to go with you? To leave my mother by herself after my father was carted off to Azkaban for the rest of his life? Leave the job I'd had to work my arse off to get? Leave what few friends I had and made after the war?"
"You see, Potter, when your little toy ship landed here, it set off the wards on my planet to alert us that we had an intruder."
Harry shook himself and glared half-heartedly. He finished the rest of his drink and turned to Malfoy. "When's your Portkey?"
His stomach twisted when he thought of Harry's friends; they'd gone missing days before they had, not leaving a note or a trace of any kind. It was safer, that way, for Granger especially. But that didn't keep the tears from rising in Harry's eyes when he thought of his friends--which was anytime they weren't worried about the infant in their care.
"Hello to you, too, Orion. And you, Diana. Any idea where Harry is? No? I'm talking to two dogs who can't respond to me? And I've lost the plot? Okay, good, good," he said with a wry grin as he gave loving scratches and pets to the greedy dogs.
Being bitten was unlike any pleasure Harry'd ever known; teetering on the knife's edge of life and death and knowing he was safe in Draco's arms, under his teeth, no matter which side he ended up on, whether his heart was still beating afterward.
That moment of blind rage in the bathroom haunted Harry enough during the day that he wasn't surprised that it would make its way into his dreams--but his chest hurt with the knowledge that perhaps it might've gone differently. Might've ended in whispered apologies, explanations, and soft, exploring kisses.
“Yes, I saw it shortly after I first moved to the city. I have to say, I’m surprised Ginvera picked it.”
Someone stood over him, muttering something that sounded like his name. but his brain was slow to process the image and accompanying sound of the person's voice.
Potter, who’d saved Draco’s life more times than he merited, more times than was necessary. Draco rose on shaking legs and willed himself to walk over to Potter, weaving through the crowd to approach him. Potter regarded him with a tight-lipped smile.
He looked over to see Draco sprawled across the couch, an empty glass in one hand and the other nearly touching the floor, his leather-clad legs spread wide.
I missed you. I missed your passion, how you bring out the fire in me like no one else can. Astoria, lovely and sensible though she is, could never do that for me.
It didn’t matter, because if this was the result of firewhiskey and Harry Potter, then maybe Draco didn’t mind party games after all.
Harry smiled fondly. Taking Draco's hand, he led them toward the Burrow, its warm light a welcome destination in the icy weather.
Because it's 6 in the afternoon on a Tuesday. And if Harry could be arsed to do the math, it would make it about 65 hours since Draco had whispered, "I've got to go," and left Harry with nothing to kiss his lips but the rim of a firewhiskey bottle, nothing to caress him but the sheets of his bed, and nothing to fill his heart except the pain of loneliness.
Harry gulped the last of his firewhiskey, letting the burn run down his throat and trying to elongate the length of his neck as he swallowed. He nearly smirked at the feel of gray eyes following the movement, but he knew outward cockiness wasn't what he needed--what they both needed--tonight.
Draco wiped the tears that spilled down his cheeks, his suitcase levitating behind him. The angry snarls from his father still rang in his ears, cruel and sharp.
The grass itched his skin, he swatted at the bugs, his arm was already losing blood flow, his cheek was dirty, and his neck was sore.
His friends grew more and more concerned, Hermione's face becoming increasingly pinched with worry. Harry knew that thread would snap eventually, but he'd just flash her a smile to show her all was well.
He finally reached the bar and caught the bartender's attention long enough to order a shot of whiskey. While he waited, he turned to survey the crowd.
Harry's eyebrows furrowed as he took in the sight of the moonlight glittering on the Black Lake. The air was quiet and damp, likely from recent rain; a cool wind cut through humid air for a moment of relief.
