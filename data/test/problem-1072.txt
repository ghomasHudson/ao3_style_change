“Because it's rude to out someone as a werewolf,” Harvey answered. “If you still meet him after circumstances change – because I
A man with shockingly blond hair, which did indeed resemble Malfoy's, was sitting at the table, nursing a cup of tea. He smiled when they entered.
Harry's thoughts on house elves hadn't quite settled. He'd just been given a lot of information at once. But Harvey had also mentioned... “My godfather?”
"I might just stick the other parchments within the pages and stab them all through with basilisk venom at once," Harvey mused.
Harry cautiously served himself a piece of chicken, and a bit of bread. Harvey glanced briefly at Harry's plate, but glanced away again without expressing judgment, and Harry more confidently served himself some potatoes, and then carrots when they came around. It was ridiculous, honestly, expecting Harvey... expecting
When Harry was finally stirring some fresh berries into his own porridge, Harvey leaned forward and met his eyes from across the table. "Remember when I first brought you to Grimmauld, and I said giving you a better childhood than my own was
“But didn't Dum- didn't that same headmaster allow Moony to attend as a student? And you just explained that werewolves are just people, and responsible ones can lock themselves up to avoid causing harm!” Harry protested.
Harvey's voice had increased in volume until he was practically shouting, and Snape's eyebrows had practically disappeared into his hair at the rant.
“Yes. I ask that you keep an open mind.” his... himself... Old Harry answered. “I know Vernon wasn't exactly accepting of anyone different than himself, but we know better than to trust his opinion.”
“We're in London,” Peverell answered. “Welcome to Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Let's go inside so we can speak freely.” He led the way to a door and unlocked it.
“You were fine,” Harvey assured Harry, who had been second-guessing his interactions with the younger Draco all day, even after they parted ways. “You only told him to stop attacking your friend, and he
“One of these days, I hope he will trust me enough to accept clothing,” Harvey muttered, almost under his breath.
Harry had been disappointed at the mention of homework, but he lit up at the thought of his friends. “Can I have them over
He was also eager to see Voldemort destroyed – so eager that he felt guilty for looking forward to someone's death... But that someone
After an exciting – in all the wrong ways – shopping trip with the Weasleys, Harry was relieved to take Harvey's arm and return home to 12 Grimmauld Place.
Peverell closed the door behind them, and locked it with an absent wave of his hand as Harry took in the space.
They collected André on the way to the ritual room, where everyone knew not to touch the stack of parchments.
"Five including the one you brought, yes," Harvey confirmed. "We've got a house elf watching the last one. He's going to bring it here if it's ever left unattended and unwarded – with a convincing double in its place, of course. This elf is good at mimicking human magical signatures, and Voldemort was only human. If its current guardian is too cautious, we have reliable intelligence that he's going to try to slip it into an upcoming first year's belongings to sow chaos at Hogwarts, at which point it will certainly be unwarded, and unnoticed if not unattended, so the elf can collect it then."
"Thanks," Harry said drily. They were time travelers – why couldn't they have done all this before Voldemort even came to Hogwarts last year? Maybe his childhood wouldn't have had to include Voldemort at all...
,” Harvey agreed. “There's a loophole in the curse that only a very desperate elf might discover. I'll introduce you to the elf who discovered it later. He's busy right now with a task he is very enthusiastic about.”
to treat himself like the Dursleys had, but some instincts were hard to erase. It was one thing at Hogwarts, to serve himself food when no adults were at the table to scold him for taking 'more than his share'. It was another thing entirely to take food under the watchful eye of his guardian.
A strange mix of emotions that Ron couldn't read flashed across the Slytherin's face as he fidgeted with the lid on a jar of Armadillo Bile, his lips twitching, eyes flickering as if he were wrestling with the words he needed to say next. He settled for, "Shove off, Weasley! It's none of your bloody business anyway, is it?"
Hermione sighed heavily and gave Harry a meaningful glance, shuffling closer to her friend's side. "Harry," she whispered urgently, "you need to tell him. And soon."
"We're stopped?" He grunted, his back aching as he forced himself to sit upon the leather-bound seat. "Why're we stopped?"
Slowly, Draco breathed in the cold, frigid air and began to walk up the cramped stairway, Harry following closely behind him, still firmly clasping his hand in his. This was it.
"Do it!" Harry laughed. "Please, you need to eat anyway. Madame Pomfrey would be very "displeased.'" He said pointedly, quoting Draco's words in his note that morning.
Ron tore his eyes away from Harry and stared intently into the crystal ball perched on top of their table, furrowing his eyebrows in concentration. "Hm. Well, it sounds to me like you're obsessed with him."
"We very well can, and we will. That boy will marry Miss Trix as intended, or the heirdom will be stripped from him. I will not let our fortune to pass on to some filthy man-slut!" Lucius turned to face his wife, fuming. "He might be our son, but he has disgraced us! No one can know about this, or we will be ruined."
"'Mione," Ron swallowed hard and began to clutch at his throat as he sank back into his cushion, his body rigid with shock. "I can't fucking believe it."
"Draco?" he whispered, trembling. "C'mon, Draco. Wake up!" He shook him violently. His frail body was limp like a rag doll.
Ron watched him silently from the bed beside his, a sad and solemn look on his face as he watched his friend suffer helplessly. There wasn't much he could do. He couldn't change whatever it was that Harry saw in the ball, and he certainly couldn't change the future. If it hurt Harry this much, it had to be something awful, and Ron would give anything to make his best mate smile again, even if only for a moment.
The gargoyle statue stared down at Draco, talons raised, ready to pounce, and the Slytherin shrank back in fear.
Harry chuckled softly and shrugged his shoulders beneath his robes. "Honestly, I have no idea," his cheeks reddened visibly. "You've been distracting me."
His mercury gray eyes darted up and down the passageway, searching the mob anxiously to quiet the apprehensive voices in his head. And then, he saw him . . . .
Hermione ignored him, staring at Draco, looking suddenly confused. "Wait, did Harry sneak you in here? What're you two up to?"
He froze solid, every muscle in his body seizing, but he stiffly forced himself to face him nonetheless. He eyed up the ginger with his most pretentious smile.
"Wait, where d'you think your going, young man?" Madame Pomphrey demanded, grabbing Draco's arm, "You have to rest!"
Knowing Harry the way he did, he knew that the boy wouldn't laugh or scorn him. It would shock him undoubtedly, maybe it would anger him for some unknown reason, and he'd even be the slightest bit disgusted - but he would never laugh. Never. Harry wasn't a filthy git like he was.
Several frustrated groans and muttered complaints broke Harry out of his trance and drew his attention to the familiar, crystal orb perched in the center of his table. He sighed as he dismally watched the colors shift and swirl beneath the smooth, glass-like surface, first changing from a hazy pink to a cloudy blue.
Something clattered behind him, but he ignored it. He was choking, after all. It was probably just Peeves come to see what all of the rackets were. Draco felt a presence of
What if the three muggle-loving blood-traitors were able to disclose his identity? He could only imagine the great Chosen One's response when he ascertained the absurdity of the situation.
Draco felt anger like a burning hot coal in the pit of his stomach, and his face twitched with rage. He wanted to scream out, "I don't need your pity," but he held his tongue. He could hear the sound of their footsteps - three pairs of feet. Harry must have been dawdling behind them a little, presumably lost in thought, and Draco divided the curtain to catch a fleeting glimpse of him in the restricted passageway.
Ronald Weasley with his headful of brilliantly red hair, shouldered his way over, his skin sheen with sweat. He gave Draco a strange but curious look, and Harry's smile broadened.
He wasn't sure how he felt about his new clothes. He was positive that red was not his color, and he positively
"It is. It really is." Draco agreed, beaming, his mercury blue eyes twinkling in the sunlight. "Harry?"
Harry nodded and reached up to rub his eyes before he dragged himself up and clumsily got dressed. He fidgeted with the button of his jeans and then staggered behind Ron to the Great Hall.
"Is that why you hated me?" Harry asked, resting his arms on Malfoy's broadening shoulders and staring breathlessly into the Slytherin's stunning grey eyes.
Despite himself,  he wondered what the Slytherin boy was doing.  He wished that he knew. Harry mentally slapped himself. Was he really thinking along those lines?  Was he really feeling what he thought he was feeling?  He couldn't. . .
"Typical Potter sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. That's all." Malfoy replied, sneering to the best of his ability. "Stupid scarhead." his heart clenched, and he winced slightly.
Trying not to overthink it, he sat down his quill before he could change it and began to fold the paper. He clumsily folded it into a unicorn shape and then pointed his wand at it again.
"You look so much better today, Draco," Pansy Parkinson piped up amidst the room full of babbling students, interrupting Draco's scattered and confusing train of thoughts. Her big round eyes were studying him strangely. "Did Madame Pomphrey give you some new treatment or something?"
it was that his son fancied, he doubted that he would be considered a Malfoy much longer. The name would be stripped from him, and he'd be left to find his own means elsewhere, living beneath London in the subways and begging for spare coins in the square. He wouldn't last long out in the muggle world. He knew it. He was only 15, and all he'd ever known was wealth, fame, and prosperity.
"I'm. . . worried, I guess." He stammered, scrunching up his face in frustration. "I can't really explain it. It's just, I've never seen you like this before. No one has. And that day, when I saw you on the train . . ."
"Sure, sure, just . . . I'll be right there." Draco stammered, squeezing his eyes shut and shaking his head, trying to clear his anxious thoughts.
"I have got to give it to her," Pansy shrugged as she slung her bag over her shoulder and straightened her mused robes. "that old witch knows her magic."
Harry glanced over his shoulder for the millionth time at the Slytherin table.  Draco had his head down on the table,  and Harry felt a wave of compassion. Even if Malfoy was a slimy git like Ron seemed to think he was, Harry couldn't turn his back on him.  He would continue searching for answers,  but this time he wouldn't turn his back on his friends.  He could divide his attention,  couldn't he?
"I'm fine, Potter," Draco instinctively jerked his arm out of Harry's grasp, leaving his flesh tingling where the boy's hand had rested. "Leave me be!"
"Don't worry," Ron chuckled, brushing his long red hair from his eyes. "I didn't say anything to him. Besides, you're a weird bloke. I didn't know
The moment those defiant words fell from Draco's lips, a deathly silence filled the room. Lucius glared at his son with a mix of both horror and indignation. He was momentarily stunned, speechless. Harry ventured a glimpse at Dumbledore, and he swore he saw the hint of a triumphant grin beneath his long, white beard, the older man's eyes twinkling in the darkened room.
Harry couldn't help but smile back, his heart skipping. "The Hippogriff," he chuckled, and then he raised his voice shrilly in a mocking tone, "'
The pecan pudding pie melted in Harry's mouth as he slowly ate, his thoughts trailing off into space as he stared with furrowed brows over the crowded Gryffindor table. He kept thinking about Ron's vision in the crystal ball,  Draco's apparent fear of Professor Snape,  and of course,  as per usual,  Draco himself.
Dumbledore studied the couple perceptively through his half-moon spectacles, and he smiled beneath his beard. "Together at last?"
Finally, he stopped, his eyes stinging with tears, his face red from the exertion. "Fuck," he breathed, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. He stared into the bowl, and he regretted doing so. "What the fuck . . ." he whispered.
Draco stared wide-eyed at his plate before glancing as casually as he could over his shoulder only to greet the cold stone-wall. He heard scuffling foot-steps, and when he looked down, he swore he caught a glimpse of the shiny toe of Hermione's boot, but he shook it off.
"Ron! " Harry breathlessly called after him, "Ron!  C'mon!  Don't be such a girl's blouse about it! We need to talk. . ."
Draco grimaced slightly and felt the need to lie, but he went against his instinct. He didn't need to lie anymore.
"Yes, Master, Mistress Narcy wants you downstairs," Wilky told him shakily, his tiny legs vibrating underneath his miniature frame.
Harry swallowed hard and tried to quell his fear. He couldn't quite shake the feeling that perhaps losing half of your soul was worse than losing all of it. "Professor . . . Will he wake up?"
"Don't be daft," Harry persisted, "you said you wanted me back,  Ron.  You said I was your best mate.  You wanna play Quidditch again?  Let's do it. Let's wipe the slate clean and start over.  Please?  I won't let you down again.  I promise. "
"No, not the slightest." Draco giggled like a girl and instantly turned as red as a tomato. He cleared his throat deeply. "No, not at all."
"Yeah, one second," Harry was practically glowing, and Draco took another moment to appreciate the Gryffindor's toothy smile. "Ron!" Harry shouted, staring across the room. He waved his hand in the air excitedly, causing several curious heads to turn.
Dobby met them at the door, dressed in bright, clashing colors, and looking very pleased with himself.
,” André echoed. “And I intend to give him a talking-to, so hopefully he'll come around sooner than he might otherwise.”
“I still say we should let the fraud destroy himself,” André said, with a very Draco-like sneer. Harry had almost forgotten this was supposedly Draco Malfoy. He faded into the background so easily, while Harry's Draco always fought to be the center of attention.
He sat and watched – silently, because he knew if he made a sound, they would insist he leave – as the three men stepped into place around the circle. Harvey levitated a necklace of some sort into one circle, and a labeled parchment into the other middle-ish circle of runes. The ritual involved chanting that didn't sound familiar from Harry's own ritual, but he still didn't understand the words. It drew a smoky, ghostly
They walked together to the ritual room, a sparse room in the basement with stone walls and a matching stone floor, behind a heavy oak door.
." Harvey answered plainly. "His soul is already so unstable, it split once without his knowledge. Admittedly, I suspect he was planning to make a horcrux from Harry's death, and had prepared accordingly, and it might not have come loose under other circumstances, but if we remove some of the pieces from the land of the living, it will destabilize further, and I'm not taking the chance of him making more accidental horcruces that we can't even guess at and hunt down because Voldemort doesn't even know about them himself!"
Harry jumped to his feet and whirled around, nervously pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. Ron was standing at the door, looking at his friend with a confused expression.
Harry smiled instantly, a warm blush stealing onto his cheeks as the corners of his eyes crinkled. "Good. Neither do I," he muttered back.
The boys quickly broke apart, and Draco wiped the moisture from his lips and instead held onto the back of Harry's jacket.
Weeks later, Ronald Weasley was still just as bewildered about Harry's latest romantic endeavors as he had been before. He couldn't shake the feeling of amazement every time he saw the two boys together. They walked hand in hand to every class and held each other in the Common Room as if there was no one around, no one giving them nasty glances and strange looks.
Draco didn't lose a single moment. He needed to be on the Hogwarts Express and securely hidden away in his own compartment. He didn't want to risk Harry Potter seeing him like this, if at all.
Draco started walking, following in Harry's footsteps. Crabbe and Goyle rose to follow him, but he shook his head, and they happily sat back down to help themselves to more pudding.
Harry heard snickering, and he turned to see Fred and George Weasley grinning broadly at him. He felt a sudden wave of dread.
Discomfitted,  Harry pushed his plate away and left the Great Hall searching for his friends,  leaving Draco in shattered confusion.
His lips recoiled, but he bit into the bread. It was dry and coarse, like sand-paper on his tongue, and he gagged, instinctively reaching for his glass of pumpkin juice. Salazar! Even that didn't taste very good! A bitter, coppery tang lingered in his mouth, and Draco's shoulders sagged as he stared dismally down at his unfinished toast.
A sudden gust of chilly October air made Draco shiver, and he hugged himself tightly, rubbing his arms for warmth. He glanced up at the sky, feeling deeply unsettled by the dark, overcast sky. He felt a coldness creeping up his spine and through his bones, and he fought the urge to panic, distant but vivid memories of dark-robed creatures clouding his mind.
Draco smiled triumphantly and then looked down at his plate, which had filled itself. "Oh, Salazar. . . What in the bloody hell is that?" he asked, gesturing towards an odd, wet, brownish lump in the center of his plate. "That is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in my life."
Harry nodded eagerly. He hadn't been looking forward to a summer away from the freedom of Hogwarts and the presence of his friends, but apparently both of those were things he wouldn't have to miss after all.
out of the locket, which snarled threats at them, before the ritual forced the specter into the parchment instead.
Harry was surprised too. It was more emotion than Harvey had ever shown around him. Usually he kept it locked tight behind his Occlumency shields and promised that Harry would someday be equally able to control his emotions rather than them controlling him.
“I did say that,” Harvey agreed, “But I suspect that with a curse on the Defense position, the headmaster
Harvey sighed. "It's rude to just ignore Kreacher right away, even if you have interesting and important questions for me," he scolded gently. Somehow, the quiet rebuke made Harry feel worse than any of Vernon's shouting. Harvey turned back to the elf. “That will be all, Kreacher. If you like, you may go back to what you were doing, or you may stay for this conversation.”
When the story was over, with James dead, Sirius in prison, and Peter free but presumed dead, Harry's head was spinning even worse. “How do you know this?” he demanded. “Why hasn't anyone done anything?”
. I've already talked to him about not taking out a decade-old grudge on a preteen who hasn't done anything, and he's here to help us with the
or wanting yourself to be whole and untouched, or something to that effect. It isn't strictly necessary for you to do so; about the only thing that might mess up the ritual is if you were focused on keeping Voldemort's soul as a part of you, but I'm sure you don't want that, right?"
"Shall we see if Kreacher has made anything for dinner?" Harvey asked, when Harry had run out of questions about Parseltongue.
actually do your summer homework. Since you won't have to sneak around to do it, I recommend you work during the day, starting this week, and then have the last few weeks of summer free to do whatever else you like. I'm sure your friends will want to visit or invite you over at some point.”
find its way into the hands of an innocent Hogwarts student. When he's home, he has a whole outfit that he wears proudly. I'll introduce you properly later, like I promised.”
being a prat. Draco is perfectly capable of growing out of his bullying and posturing,” he grinned at André, “but he's twelve, so he hasn't yet.”
Harvey nodded, locking all his emotions away again - so thoroughly that if Harry had entered the room right now, he might not realize anything was wrong. "Thank you."
“That's it,” Harvey said. “His soul was in too many pieces for him to have a chance at becoming a ghost, so the pieces had no choice but to move on.”
“In my third year,” Harvey answered cautiously, “a notorious criminal broke out of Azkaban. The news speculated, and the general public believed, that he was after the Hogwarts-aged son of the friend he had betrayed, in order to 'finish the job' after the child had defeated his leader. But the headmaster of Hogwarts remembered the criminal as a student, and remembered who he was friends with. He hired the only other living – to his knowledge – person who had been his close friend to be the Defense teacher, because he was the person best suited to anticipating and defending against his once-friend's actions. That year, the risk he could mitigate against a determined invader, was a benefit that outweighed the risk of hiring a werewolf to teach at a boarding school in the first place.”
"It's okay," Harry answered, trying to decide if there was a polite way to say 'I'm relieved to know you have emotions after all.'
Harvey smiled reassuringly. "You just need to follow us to the ritual room and lay down where we tell you to. Then during the ritual, focus on wanting the soul piece
“If we can't make anything work before the first, you and I can still meet with your parents,” Harvey said. “But it'd be nice if Draco and Harry could re-meet each other, without that initial misunderstanding.”
with. He had friends, like Ron and Hermione, and he had enemies, like Snape and Voldemort. The quidditch teams were often described as inter-house rivalries, but he didn't know any of the other seekers well enough to really pay attention to them.
"Harry's just here to watch," Harvey assured him. "He's had a soul piece removed from him already; he knows what's going on."
"You didn't forget; we didn't tell you," Harvey answered. "I'll explain over breakfast. Come down when you're ready."
Draco felt his face crumple as the tears now flowed freely. "N-no, sir, I d-do not take you for a f-fool. "
"He's brave, " he began softly, his face burning with shame through his hot tears. "He's the opposite of me.  I'm a coward." He laughed softly to himself. "
Draco's body grew limp, and Harry tremblingly smoothed the boy's hair from his face, looking fearfully into his empty eyes. Draco stared listlessly up at the sky, his pale lips parted, his expression emotionless.
For a moment, the pain was so intense that Draco thought he might cry out for help. . . But then, his eyes closed, and he felt his legs buckle beneath him. His head smashed into something hard, and then everything went black. The darkness swallowed him whole.
"Okay," Harry sighed, grinning broadly as he collapsed onto his four-poster bed. "C'mon, get over here, Malfoy."
George hesitated. "Never mind. Nothing." He stood and threw his wrinkled leather book-bag over his shoulder before turning to leave the room. "See ya later, lover-boy."
Harry stirred in his lap slightly and buried his face in Draco's stomach. Ron gave him a severe look.
"Are you . . . are you, uh, and Malfoy . . ?" Ron cut himself off mid-sentence, clearly struggling to work things over in his head.
McGonagall looked down at them, her watery green eyes looking unnaturally large through her gold-rimmed spectacles. She looked at Draco with a dark, troubled expression, and then down at the two boys ' now openly conjoined hands. "He knows. He's here to see Dumbledore. He wants Draco expelled. Quickly, follow him." She motioned for Hermione to enter the classroom. "Come, leave them be. This is between them and Draco's father."
He heard Draco suck in a breath and felt him tighten his grip on his robes as if he were clinging to him for dear life. "I. . . I-I. . . " Draco stammered, "I love you, too, Potter,"
Harry suddenly felt a wave of guilt. It was true. Not only had he been neglecting his schoolwork, but he'd also been neglecting his friends.  His best friends.
Draco's eyes momentarily strayed to Hermione, who was standing motionless by Ron's side, her hand resting reassuringly on his shoulder. She looked kinder than Draco remembered.
However, one particular afternoon in Potions, Ron wondered differently. Maybe he wasn't proud. Maybe, the feeling he really felt was shame.
The entrance to the office seemed overly large and imposing now. It wasn't very comforting. The thought of seeing his father, knowing that the man knew his most consequential secret was daunting, and he had hoped that this moment would never come.
The boy's health was quickly diminishing.  He was thinner now - dangerously so,  and his expression never varied from that sickly, empty look. He was a seemingly blank canvas with sunken eyes rimmed in red. Harry was finding himself more and more preoccupied with thoughts of Draco and his growing illness rather than his schooling. As a result,  his grades were rapidly falling. Hermione was mortified,  but there wasn't much she could do to help him at this point. He was obsessed with Draco it was driving him mad,  and only Ron and Hermione could see it.  Harry remained oblivious to the obvious.
"It was dark, okay? It was cold, and it was loud, and . . ." Draco's voice had become anxious, his face pinched at the memory. "The sky it. . . it was so dark." He gave Harry a helpless look that broke his heart. "I don't know what happened, okay? I just bloody snapped. My mind was all fuzzy, and I couldn't think. I just felt like I needed to run and hide, and I kept thinking about them and what happened, and I don't want it to happen again. If it does, I'll die, and I'm scared of dying, Potter. I don't want to die. I just want everything to be over. I just want to have a normal fucking life!"
That little twinkle that Harry adored so much only proved to him that he had loved Draco for much longer than he had previously thought. Every time the prat smirked, Harry felt as though his heart were swelling twice the size in his chest. It was a feeling he didn't quite grasp or fully understand, and sometimes it terrified him, but all it took was a glance or a word, and he forgot that he was afraid.
It was Saturday morning. He had the weekend to catch up on his sleep and his homework. He needed to study. He had fallen so far behind in the past few months that Hermione had nearly given up on assisting him. Thankfully, she was devoted to her friends and would never allow Harry to fall behind if she could lend a hand.
"You sound like a bunch of girls," Ron grumbled moodily, rolling his eyes slightly. He flung his bag roughly over his shoulder and jogged ahead of the snickering trio, weaving his way through the tightly packed body of young scholars.
"Oh my god," Hermione stammered out breathlessly, "Oh my god, okay, I'm going to get Dumbledore. You two stay here. Whatever you do, don't leave his side and try to get him warm."
"Malfoy, can you hear me?" he shook the boy's arm madly, but he didn't respond. He lay there motionless, his head resting in a mud puddle, his white-blonde hair matted to his feverish forehead. "He's out cold," He told Hermione as she knelt beside him.
Harry ran up the steps through the rain, elbowing his way through the gaping throng with a rather panicked look on his face.
"As usual, Snape almost put me to sleep with his lecture." Harry joked, grinning adorably up at Malfoy. He stood up and tucked his book securely under his shoulder. "Today, I have no recollection of what the bloody hell it was about. Have you?"
At long last, they rolled through the gates up the sweeping drive, the carriage swaying a little in the wind. He could see Hogwarts looming nearer and nearer; it's many bright windows glowing through the mist. The carriage came to a halt at the bottom of the stone steps leading up to the front doors. People in the other carriages were already walking up the steps and filing through the doors. Draco eagerly pulled himself to his feet and carefully climbed out of the carriage, his knees almost buckling underneath him. He could feel the weasel appraising him, and his cheeks burned in the cold.
"Didn't your mother teach you not to stare, or do the Weasleys pay no heed to manners?" Draco yelled at him over a peal of thunder.
Draco looked up from the wrinkled parchment, his blood suddenly running cold as he gazed blankly at Blaise's dark hair-line. His heart was beginning to pound inside of his chest, and he could feel his hands begin to shake.
Harry's smile vanished, and he looked at Draco concernedly. "Here, um, have my toast. You have to eat something. C'mon."
Only it really wasn't. Earlier, Ron had explained Harry's breakdown and what had caused it, and Draco had decided to peek into the future for himself. Maybe Harry was wrong. They would have a future together, right? A quaint little house not too far from the Ministry, maybe adopt a stray cat or a dog. Draco had always wanted one. His father had never allowed it. They were too untidy for his taste.
"Leave me the fuck alone, Ron," Harry snapped, glaring back at his friend. "I followed him here because whatever it was he got in the mail really piqued my interest. He was as white as a ghost when he read it. . ."
As Hermione tried defining compassion to Ron in persuasive tones, Harry found himself glancing over his shoulder. Students scurried around them through the doors, trying to get out of the rain and into the castle. Harry ignored them, standing there blankly staring down the steps at the hooded figure bent over the railing below.
Halfway through Potions class, and halfway through brewing one of the most putrid smelling potions Harry had ever concocted, Draco Malfoy finally staggered into the dark dungeon classroom. His hair was madly disheveled. One side was pressed flat against his head, while the other side was standing up completely on end. Harry looked down into his steaming cauldron, smirking to himself as he stirred the lumpy green liquid. For the first time, Draco didn't look like a sneering snob or a prig. He looked like a first-year who had gotten lost in the corridors and walked into the wrong classroom.
There was a stupefied silence until Draco turned to face Harry, who was staring at the twins with a flushed and bewildered expression.
"True that," Draco shrugged his shoulders, smiling as he began to twirl a lock of Harry's hair around his finger. "I could have been hexing him in my head."
Sorry, this is a rather long chapter, but I felt that it was needed to show how far Draco's relationship with Ron has come. You might call them friends.
Draco looked embarrassed. "You ever have. . . nightmares? Or like, flashbacks or something of the sort?" he asked shyly.
Classes finished early that day in preparation for the long-awaited Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin, and dinner was scheduled to take place directly before the game. Harry ate hungrily, taking long gulps of his pumpkin juice between bites as he scraped the leftovers off of his plate.
He ran through the double doors, past Ron, who stared at him with a confounded expression when he saw the familiar Slytherin lying unconscious in his friend's arms.
Ripples of laughter filled the classroom, but Ron didn't seem to notice. He was too focused. Suddenly, he drew in a sharp intake of breath.
Draco felt his breath catch in his throat, and he coughed abruptly. Did Harry just wink at him? What in the bloody hell was that supposed to mean? He couldn't decide whether Harry was joking about poisoning him or slipping him some other bizarre tonic. Blushing furiously, Draco buried his face in his book and ignored Pansy's concerned questions. Still, he smiled. Were they actually officially on speaking terms? Were they friends now? He couldn't say. He could only silently hope. Being friends and loving him was better than being enemies and loving him, though it would make other things harder. Draco glanced up to see Professor Snape glancing shiftily between him and Potter, and he blushed all the more, quickly bowing his head and pretending to read.
Lucius pointed a long, accusatory finger at his only son. "You will regret those words, boy," he spat angrily.
This time, Draco didn't say anything. He just nodded silently, confused as the bird settled nervously on the table in front of him, ruffling its feathers proudly. Ryu looked pleased with herself as she stuck out her silvery beak, her breath wheezing as Draco reached out to take the tiny fold of paper from her mouth.
He heard the bathroom door opening again, and hurried footsteps echoed off of the stone floor behind him.
"C'mon!" Harry huffed. "Look, I don't know why, but I really feel like something's up, and I really want to find out what it is. I can't stop thinking about it."
First, he studied their faces, and then he noticed their hands, tightly clasped together, and his expression darkened.
"Professor, what's going on?" Harry asked abruptly, following the older woman's gaze anxiously. "What's Malfoy doing here?"
Harry shot Malfoy one last meaningful glance before turning tail and heading out of the classroom and into the dark corridor. Strangely enough, he couldn't shake Draco's fearful expression when he saw Snape. Draco had always been the Professor's little pet, so why would he ever be afraid of him? What in the bloody hell was going on?
"Bloody hell!" Draco held his bleeding finger and glared icy daggers at his owl, "I hate you with a passion. You know that, right?"
Draco's sneer did not falter, and neither did his resolve. Harry felt a keen sense of pride and awe. He had seen the Slytherin bitterly angry to the point of violence, but he had never once seen Draco this fierce or this brave. He wasn't just betraying his father; he was crossing the Dark Lord, and that was not a coward's game.
Dumbledore turned to Harry, his long white beard practically glowing in the window. "Harry, we believe Draco was subjected to a Dementor's kiss."
was in the room. It wasn't Peeves. That troublesome ghost was nowhere to be seen. Draco collapsed onto the damp floor and pressed his head against the wall, his eyes wide with alarm as he looked frantically around the room.
"So tell me exactly how long this has been going on between you and Mr. Potter, and how this. . . thing. . . began. "
Draco couldn't withstand the urge. He peered through the curtain again, his dilated eyes fixed longingly on Harry's back as he hurried to catch up with his friends, his unkempt hair bouncing with each step. And then, like magic, he was gone, and like magic, Draco's broken heart began to ache again.
Ron narrowed his eyes at him,  his white lashes catching in the torchlight. Looking suspicious,  he slowly asked, "Do you mean it? "
"Alright," Ron glanced sheepishly at Malfoy's wounded arm again before backing out of the doorway and disappearing, his retreating footsteps tapping noisily against the winding stone staircase.
Draco shook his head and rushed from the door, stumbling a little over his own feet. His vision was fuzzy, and it swayed from side to side as if he were standing on a yacht. He felt sick. He couldn't believe that the year had already gone so horribly wrong! How had things gone from bad to worse within a matter of hours? Salazar, his father, had to have jinxed him! There was no other explanation for his poor luck. Draco ran out of breath, ungracefully losing speed as he came to a halt in the castle's long stone corridor. He leaned forward, supporting his arms on his knees, gasping for air as he stared wide-eyed at the floor. How in the hell had this happened? Indebted to Harry Potter, who had allegedly saved his life. Why. . . why had he done it? With all of the hatred and contempt that the Chosen One harbored for the Slytherin, why would he bother saving his life?
"Mmhm." Ron hummed sarcastically. He narrowed his eyes and stared even more intently into the foggy crystal glass. "Oh, Professor, I think I see something!"
Ron was on him in seconds, grabbing Malfoy by the back of his robes, Hermione struggling to hold the angry ginger back as he rammed a large, meaty first into Draco's pointed face. Draco felt his lip bust and his nose crack sickeningly as Weasley's knuckles collided with his skin, blood pooling.
Hermione to hurry. He didn't know what to do. He felt tears burning in his eyes, and he tried to wipe them away, but he couldn't. Tonight was supposed to be happy.
"I'm still a little weak. Have a bit of trouble getting up, y'know? Sometimes, my head gets a bit fuzzy, but it's nothing too serious. Other times . . . I get all cold inside, and I feel sick, but it passes after a while. And, as for my arm. . ."
Harry beamed at the sound of Draco's voice. He slid closer to Neville Longbottom and patted the empty space between himself and one of the Weasley twins. Draco hesitated for a moment, glancing at Ron sheepishly before squeezing himself onto the bench. His green dress robes stood out like a sore thumb.
Narcissa imagined the scandal, the falsifications, and the misconceptions that would fill the head-titles and the articles on the front page of every Daily Prophet. She imagined Draco cowering from the cameras, wincing with every blinding flash, and she quickly turned and rushed from the room to find a parchment, a quill, and her owl.
Draco looked down to see Pansy's hand on his, and he immediately pulled back, revolted by her touch. "Oh, I'm fine. Sorry, " he muttered weakly, barely glancing at her. He slowly rose from the table and almost lost his balance; his legs were shaking furiously.
The pale morning light shone through the window, softly illuminating the shadowy interior of the stuffy little room he shared with the Weasleys. He slowly raised his hands and forced himself upright, rubbing his eyes before glancing around the room.
Draco's eyes fell, "S-sir, " he said slowly before gulping in air. "Harry. . . Harry isn't to blame. It's. . . it's just me." He wrapped his arms around himself for comfort. "He doesn't love me. "
Harry smirked. Now was his opportunity. "By the way," he said nonchalantly, "You wouldn't by any chance happen to have my robes with you, would you?"
She followed his wandering gaze to Malfoy, who seemed to be struggling for breath as students walked heedlessly past him.
"Yeah," Draco groaned, slowly standing as he massaged the back of his neck, his face twisted into a grimace. "I shouldn't have said that."
"No, no, no," He threw back the crisp, white sheets hastily, hot tea sloshing onto his sweater as he clumsily clambered out of bed. His head was spinning, but he ignored it as his stockinged feet touched the cold, stone floor.
Draco reasoned. He ignored himself, his eyes closing, the voices in his head going quiet. . . He just needed some rest. It didn't matter where.
Harry watched Ron uncomfortably. Something was different now. Something seemed off. He saw himself? And someone else?
Draco hurried away as fast as he could, the ground making watery sloshing sounds with each step, his shoes sinking into the mud as the rain came pouring down even harder. Thunder split the sky with a loud
After taking a moment to collect his thoughts, he stood and straightened his shoulders, forcing a look of haughty indifference before grabbing his book-bag and walking gracefully out of the room.
They reached the top of the stairs, and the mismatched triad began to follow the assemblage down a narrow, twisting corridor. As Harry and Hermione continued their intense debate, Draco felt his stomach drop sickeningly. Something wasn't right.
Draco groaned at the high-pitched, whining drawl of Pansy's voice, a voice that so easily compared to the sound of talons running feverishly down a chalkboard. "I'm not hungry," he said savagely.
“Hm. We did promise Narcissa, didn't we,” Harvey mused. “Why don't you arrange two occasions: the former with just yourself, and the latter with us in attendance. Draco insulted the Weasleys today for being poor. Bad form, that.”
Harvey grinned. “She takes studying to an extreme, I'll admit, but knowledge is power. It's useful to everyone, but especially to those who aren't born into other forms of power. I eventually regretted not taking school seriously, especially when I had to learn things again later because I discovered they were actually useful to my life, not just in theory. I hope you can learn from my mistakes. By the way, I know you can achieve EEs on everything if you try, and I expect to see your grades reflect that. Even History,” he insisted, before Harry could protest.
“But also, myself and my husband were not yet friends at your age,” Oldarry continued. ...Larry. Larry sounded better than Olarry. Larry said this more forcefully than seemed necessary. “We were much closer to rivals, in fact,” he admitted.
." He waited for Harry to nod his understanding before continuing. "But André says your Occlumency is good enough that we can mention it to you – Voldemort stored shards of his own soul in objects outside his body, which is why enough of him survived to come back years later." Harvey shuddered. "Splitting your soul is a horrible, horrible thing to do. But Voldemort was reckless and split his soul, not once, which would be enough for protection from death, but several times, and it left his soul unstable. With all the chaos of the night he tried to kill you, and his other spell backfiring, a bit of his soul split off and attached itself to
Harry debated going back to sleep and claiming he wasn't ready - Harvey hadn't given him a time that he must be ready by - but he was awake enough, and curious, so he dragged himself out of bed and got dressed in one of his new casual robes. After a quick trip to the bathroom - his hair was untameable as ever - he made his way downstairs to the dining room.
“Good idea,” André agreed. He pulled out a planner and started taking notes, even as they were still walking.
“Excellent,” Harvey decided. “Now, Harry, before you pick a bedroom and put your things away, there's one more introduction to make. Kreacher?”
"Don't worry," Harvey said quickly, not quite before his previous sentence had sunk in enough for Harry to panic about it. "We know a ritual that can remove it from you with minimal harm."
Harry eagerly agreed to the change of subject, and left the room as quickly as he could without feeling like he was running away.
“You're still a Parselmouth, then,” Harvey concluded, and proceeded to explain the ability, and the stigma, to Harry, who hadn't even realized they'd been speaking another language.
André and Harvey were both already there, though they weren't talking. André had his nose buried in a book that didn't appear to have a title, and Harvey was stirring his porridge more than eating it.
Harry swallowed his nerves – he would never let Draco Malfoy see him being scared of him – and followed Larry into the large house, past a staircase, and into a comfortable dining room with a large table, which looked old but freshly polished, down the middle of the room.
“It's horrifying, I know,” Harvey agreed. “House elves see their options as slavery or death, so even though people frequently treat them worse than the Dursleys ever treated you,” – Harry ignored André's surprised glance at Harvey for the comparison – “most house elves will be insulted if you ever offer them clothes, and they may even plead against it. Technically, Kreacher is bound to obey any command I give him, so I try to suggest actions, rather than requiring them. I ask that you try to do the same.” He fixed Harry with a serious look until Harry nodded his understanding.
“Even the ghosts don't know,” Harvey answered, turning away from the ink-stained table. “They've never been that far.”
“Your husband?” Harry asked, surprised, the first time his older self paused for breath. He hadn't even thought about girls in that way... yet. But he certainly hadn't considered liking boys either.
A small knobbly being with large flappy ears and slightly bulging gray eyes appeared with a pop. “Master Harvey be calling?” he croaked, in a manner that could be called pleasant. He appeared to be wearing a dark blue pillowcase. Admittedly, it was a clean and neatly pressed pillowcase.
“So,” André broke the silence as they made their way up the stairs to the more inhabited parts of the house. “I say we give Father a week to recover from the diary's influence, and then we set up a meeting. How does lunch sound?”
“Unfortunately,” Harvey answered. “You learned more from Quirrell than this idiot will teach you all year. Be prepared to self-study, and not with the assigned textbooks.”
Harry sighed. More reading to do. “I'm still not convinced you aren't trying to turn me into Hermione,” he complained.
Harvey turned back to Harry. “House elves are magical beings that humans cursed and tricked long ago,” he explained, quiet and serious. “They're largely forced into slavery, and humans treat them as lesser. They are denied the dignity of clothing unless they are freed, but for many, freedom is a slow and painful death sentence because it cuts them off from their own magic.”
. It was hard to think around the pain, but Harry tried to focus on Harvey's advice. He focused on wanting Voldemort out of him and away from him.
“And I do,” Harvey agreed, with a fond smile. “Every night.” He shook his head, and turned back to Harry. “Did you have any other questions?”
“I thought you might've,” Harvey said warmly. “Great job. Remind me later, and we'll discuss the time off you deserve but didn't take, and what your next task can be.” He turned to Harry. “Would you like to see the final destruction of Voldemort with your own eyes?”
Harry and Harvey sat in silence for another moment before Harvey turned to Harry. "Sorry about that. I let my emotions get the better of me."
, I will explain to you after you're an adult, if you're still good at occlumency by then. I assure you, I have good reason to be so certain.”
Harvey pulled out a gleaming dagger. “This is goblin-forged steel,” he told them. “I'm leasing it from Gringotts for a week. The blade is infused with basilisk venom, which makes it perfectly destructive against these soul pieces, but otherwise safe to handle.”
?” he asked. He would have never dreamed of having even Hermione over to visit at the Dursleys, but with an understanding, magical guardian...
"I'll go first!" Harry decided. Knowing that he had a bit of Voldemort inside of him - literally - was more terrifying than the thought of sitting through a mildly harmful ritual. He wanted Voldemort
Harry woke to a polite knock on his door. He groaned and rubbed his eyes before reaching for his glasses. The clock said it was just after 7 am. "Come in," he called half-heartedly.
A peal of thunder shook the stadium, and Draco wrapped his arms around his body, cringing fearfully at the sound, the smell of sulfur filling his nostrils. He walked as quickly as he could, but his legs felt stiff as if his joints were freezing with fear. It was an all too familiar feeling, and his stomach lurched sickeningly.
"Ah, right! Brilliant!" Harry thrust his hand into his pocket and rummaged for a second before pulling out a very crumpled piece of paper. His hands shaking with excitement, he smoothed out the small piece of parchment and practically forced it into Hermione's hands. "There! Read it for yourself!"
Draco blushed harder. It felt as if Harry had finally noticed him. The barrier between them had finally fallen, and Draco felt happier and freer than he had in a long time.
Ron followed Harry's gaze, and his shoulders slumped. "Oh, not again," he groaned. "Is she serious? How much are we really gonna learn from these bloody things?"
Harry was late for divination. Again. He could feel every eye in the room training on him, but he ignored it and resumed his usual seat beside Ron by the window. He closed his eyes and sighed softly, enjoying the sultry breeze just barely filtering in through the open window.
"There you are," Madame Pomphrey's ragged breathing interrupted Draco's train of thought, and she slid her hands reassuringly across his shoulders, "C'mon, let's get back to bed now. There there, easy does it."
Harry, still clasping Draco's hand tightly, followed Hermione down the corridor to Professor McGonagall. Her aged face was lined with worry as she watched Lucius Malfoy stride quickly around the bend, maddened determination marking his steps.
Harry glared after her. "Y'know what,  Ron?  She's driving me insane.  I don't know if I can handle her anymore. "
"He's not brave.  He's an arrogant child who thinks himself better than his elders." Snape said stiffly.  "But do go on.   This might be entertaining."
This baffled Ron. Obviously, Malfoy needed help, but the Slytherin was determined to keep his troubling affliction to himself. The Pureblood was just as pompous and proud as he had always been.
Slowly, he reached out and laid his hand on Harry's back, giving him a pat or two. He shifted uncomfortably, unaccustomed to providing comfort like this. What did he do when Hermione was like this? He tried to think. Oh, who was he kidding? She was never like this.
"Shut it,  Ron.  Anyway,  Harry,  if you don't get this done, you'll have the lowest grade in the class.  If you don't pass this year,  you'll be held back. "
Harry had lost track of how much time had passed since the Quidditch match, and he had no idea how long Malfoy had been in the infirmary. All he knew was that he was tired. He was tired of worrying, tired of fretting endlessly over his crush, wondering whether he would ever get better. Just when he had begun to think that Draco had finally managed to get back on his feet, his condition had only seemed to get worse.
It was. He had puked up clumps of wet, soggy dirt and grass. Some of it was tinged red with blood. He felt sick again.
"Can we just go in already?" Ron interrupted Hermione pleadingly, "It's really bloody cold out here."
Solidified. Frozen solid. Unmoving. Only Draco's eyes moved, slowly shifting to the boy who had just spoken as he emerged from the massive swarm of students accumulating around them between compartments. Emerald green collided with silver, and Draco felt his soul crumble at the sight of him, the pain making his heart snap in two like a twig underfoot.
Harry felt a calm settle over him as he quietly stroked the back of Malfoy's hair, feeling the Slytherin's chest rise and fall against his.
Harry laughed joyously, "Yes, yes, it's me. I'm here." He squeezed Draco's hand tightly and kissed it, his tears still falling. "I'm here, Draco."
They walked a short way until the halls had cleared up, and then Dumbledore stopped walking and turned to gaze out one of the windows towards the Black Lake, the surface of it sparkling blindingly in the afternoon sunlight. Harry stood still and waited for him to speak with bated breath.
He didn't want his confession to be fresh on Harry's mind once they were around each other again for fear that the dark-haired boy would catch on. That was the last thing he wanted. He would crumble if Harry knew.
Finally, he stepped into the dining room, and their laughter died behind him as he made his way to the seat opposite of the fireplace - the middle of the long, narrow table. His father sat silently at one end, and his mother at the other. The Malfoys' dining room was even gloomier than Draco's cold, empty bedroom, despite the fire that roared in the massive stone fireplace. It was longer than it was wide, with a wooden table that spanned most of the room's length. The candles that flickered over their heads gave the room a sort of sinister, ghostly atmosphere.
"There's nothing," Hermione's chestnut-colored eyes glinted reassuringly in the warm, golden light from the castle. "He told you to leave him be, and knowing Malfoy, it would be pointless to test his temper."
Ron stared blankly at the back of the Slytherin's head, his mouth half-open. There had to be something they could do. He couldn't imagine what it felt like to be in Malfoy's shoes. It can't have been pleasant.
When Draco finally broke the kiss, Harry took a moment to open his eyes and catch his breath, still pressed against the wall with Malfoy's body flush against his. Happiness swirled in the pit of his stomach like a stirring cauldron.
She nodded reassuringly, "It's alright. It'll come to you eventually." She reached beside the bed and picked up a steaming cup of tea, "Here you are. I promise this will make you feel better, sweetheart."
The overhanging lights glinted off of the metal frames of Harry's glasses and caught in his emerald eyes, while his lips curled up into a repugnant sneer that any Malfoy would have been proud of. Draco could feel himself vibrating, his breath catching in his lungs, his expressions now quite out of his control, now fraught with emotion.
"You don't, " Snape answered softly,  staring at the wall with hazy eyes as if he were lost in a distant memory.
Harry folded it into the shape of a miffler this time and watched it skitter across the dungeon floor. Draco held back a smile as he slowly scooped it up off of his leg and unfolded it beneath the table. Harry watched the Slytherin's mercury eyes crinkle as he read. He glanced briefly at Professor Snape, and he froze when he realized that the man was looking directly at Draco with a blank expression, though he obviously knew what was going on. Harry felt something fall into his lap again, and he gulped slightly. Snape's coal-like eyes fell on him, but he did nothing. Instead, much to Harry's surprise, he simply turned back to the scroll he was reading.
Hermione looked baffled by Harry's apology.  She simply shared a glance with Ron and then took a reluctant sip of her pumpkin juice. Harry sighed and looked back down at his plate,  prodding his sliver of pie with his utensils.
A murmur of sudden excitement rippled through the classroom, and Harry slowly perked up, his curiosity getting the better of him like it usually did.
Harry had something to say that he would have liked to say out loud, but he held his tongue instead, blushing down into his lap.
Harry met his friend's questioning gaze and shrugged feebly,  suddenly feeling nervous. "I don't know," he said, baffling even himself. "I don't know whether it's because I want to find out what he's up to or if it's because I'm genuinely concerned for him. I'll be damned if it's the last one.  I never dreamed I'd ever give Malfoy a second thought,  but here I am. "
Draco heard Ron and Hermione breathing hard behind him. He shook his head and gagged again as he struggled to speak.
Draco sucked in a breath and wiped his nose on his sleeve.  "He hates me, " he sniffed. "He's hated me from the moment we met,  but. . . but I didn't.  At first,  I don't know...  I guess I was just infatuated with him.  I didn't even realize it,  and I was in denial.  When I finally understood what I was feeling, the feelings had already grown, and I didn't have time to deal with it.  I didn't know what to do!  I can't help myself! You have to understand,  Professor! There really is nothing I can do. How do you stop loving someone? "
So. . . this was going to be how Draco Malfoy died. How splendid! Capital headline it would make for the Daily Prophet. Rita Skeeter would be thrilled! What a tragic story. The wizarding world was very fond of those after all. . .
Draco shook his head a little. "No, I can't say it enough. I was so callous to the three of you. I had no right to say or do any of the things I did, and  . . . I'm embarrassed. So, I'm sorry."
Ron was drooling on his pillow, Neville was snoring, and Seamus was sound asleep. Harry let out a sigh of relief and then smiled broadly, turning back to the expectant owl and pulling a rolled-up piece of paper out of its short beak. He replaced it with his own, watched as the owl flapped out the window, and then he eagerly unfolded his note.
Harry looked up from his plate to glare at her. She talked to him like he was a little child, and it was beginning to wear him thin.
Ron hesitantly stood and approached his friend, sitting down on the bed beside him. He drew his legs up off of the floor and folded them underneath him as he watched his friend come undone, covering his face with his hands and beginning to sob.
"Fucking scar-head," he choked, struggling to maintain his dignity as his heart pounded in his chest and his eyes burned.
It was silent. Draco sat there uncomfortably, staring tearfully into the empty space in front of him. The bathroom was completely empty, or so it seemed. He was alone. He'd only been imagining things. Relieved and grateful to be alive, Draco sank against the wall, his body going limp, his eye-lids sagging. He wanted to sleep.
Students stopped cheering him on, and Ron quickly coiled back from Draco with a suddenly panicked expression. Draco looked back at him, his eyes half-open as he waited for the next punch. But it didn't come. His grip loosened on Draco's robes. . .
Ron never mentioned what he had seen that one morning in Gryffindor tower, but he hadn't forgotten. From time to time, Draco's hands would clench into fists, his knuckles white as he gritted his teeth in pain. It would happen at night, in the Common Room, it would happen while he slept (At least, that's what Fred and George had told him), and it would happen in the middle of class, Draco grinding his teeth together and pretending to be perfectly fine while Harry sat smiling beside him.
"I apologize, Lucius, but I believe you have overstayed your welcome," Dumbledore said calmly, gesturing gracefully towards the door.
Looking down at Draco, he felt his stomach tie itself into knots, and he swallowed hard, his heart aching. Draco's skin had faded to a colorless gray. His face was bony and gaunt, and the circles around his eyes had darkened until now they were almost black. His hair looked more white than blonde as if all the life and color had left his body with his soul.
Draco was oblivious. He took another aggressive drink from Harry's glass, Ron taking note of this silently, his face contorted in disgust. The Slytherin grumbled to himself under his breath.
"Is it just me, or does the atmosphere feel a little tense?" Luna Lovegood asked softly from beside Hermione, looking innocently from face to face. "It must be the nargles."
Hermione gently laid a hand on Harry's arm,  anticipating what he was going to say,  and Ron simply stared at Harry with wide,  narrowed eyes.
Harry watched Ron's head of bright red hair bob up and down as he walked, the boy's long,  lanky legs taking unusually long,  fast-paced strides. Harry groaned as he struggled to quicken his pace to match,  but his shorter legs refused to cooperate.
Draco looked up at the Death Eater silently and then stared down at his folded hands, watching his fingers as they trembled.
Angrily, Lucius shoved the wrinkled parchment into Draco's hand and shouldered him against the wall before turning promptly to Harry, scorn written clearly on his face.
Harry squeezed Draco's hand comfortingly beneath his robe. "It's fine, Draco," he chirped, the sunlight glinting off the wireframes of his glasses. "You'll be up and on your broom again before long, and we'll face off against each other again next season."
Draco couldn't breathe. He could feel the blood rushing to his face, and his tongue was swelling in his mouth. He was suffocating. Fantastic!
Draco's eyes glistened, and Harry's chest ached unbearably at the sight. He pulled Draco back into his arms and held him again, tightly, not in the least bit willing to let him go.
Draco paused, looking up at Harry suspiciously beneath his long blonde lashes. "You're. . . checking up on me?" He narrowed his eyes a little. "Why?"
He shyly met Draco's penetrating gaze, and for a moment, they studied each other in silence, and Harry noted the sling supporting the Slytherin's left arm.
He agonized over the situation, wondering whether he had missed something, some little sign indicating that Draco had been silently suffering alone.  He couldn't think of anything. The Slytherin's thin, pallid cheeks had a touch of color in them now, and the dark, purple circles beneath his eyes had vanished,  and now, the shimmering silvery depths of them shone with life and new-found joy, a little mischievous twinkle catching in the light now and again.
The soft, pale skin was spotless and unblemished, except for the large, unsightly black mark branded on his inner forearm—the telling sign of a Death Eater. The knot in his stomach tightened sickeningly, and he grimaced, watching as the mark twisted and slithered. . . burning. Draco's face twisted with pain.
The sick boy lying in this bed looked nothing like the boy Harry thought he knew. He was helpless and frail and weak, stripped of his malice and pompous airs. His face was expressionless, lacking the famous sneer that Harry had secretly loved so much. It lacked life. . .
Draco shifted uncomfortably in his sleep, and Harry jumped a little. He let out a sigh of relief before hesitantly tucking his robes more securely around Draco's motionless body.
With that,  Harry watched Ron leave the table and follow Hermione out of the Great Hall.  His shoulders sank, and he suddenly felt miserable. They were right.  What had he been doing? Malfoy didn't deserve his attention. . .  but he couldn't help myself.,  could he?
Draco grabbed Harry's empty glass, and it filled itself as he raised it to his lips. "In Slytherin, there's a fewer selection of decent blokes to chose from," he took a drink and licked his lips slightly. "They're all complete idiots as far as I'm concerned. You're lucky you're in Gryffindor."
Ron squinted, his nose crinkling. "Well, erm, I see. . . a face? But, I can't make out who it is yet."
But despite that, he felt that all-too-familiar knot of dread in the pit of his stomach, and he sucked in a breath, his insides lurching violently.
Draco swallowed hard, but when he did, he choked. He coughed so hard he felt his lungs might explode. Harry rubbed his back soothingly.
Draco swore loudly, stood up from the table, and stormed out of the hall, leaving Harry completely and utterly mortified as he realized that he had just come out to everyone in the nearby vicinity. Horrified, he buried his face in his arms on the table, his face burning with embarrassment. What had just happened?
"I don't know!" Harry blurted, panicking as he watched Draco's eyes roll into the back of his head. "He said something about dementors and then ran from me."
Ron had no idea when Harry had become so openly vulnerable, and he definitely had no idea when Harry had begun to care for that dodgy, oily-headed Slytherin. Still, it didn't matter in the end, did it? Ron had spent a lot of time in the past few weeks contemplating the two boy's strange yet compelling relationship, and he had begun to realize that it didn't matter who or what the boy had done before all of this. It had all been a mask, a shield to protect himself from harm, and Ron couldn't say he blamed him, because honestly, he didn't. He would likely have done the same in Malfoy's position, if not worse. Being a part of such a well-known family, having a father like Lucius Malfoy, and being forced to become a Death-Eater? Draco hadn't had many options until now. He had been stuck between a rock and a hard place. He had tormented the three of them so heatedly all of these years out of fear, not out of malice. It had all been a mask to conceal the things he really felt.
The castle loomed overhead, so close and yet so far. Rain clouded Draco's vision, running down his face and soaking through his clothes to his clammy skin.
Draco searched the rafters for his old owl, and his face lit up a little. "Oh, Bubo!" he called cheerfully.
Crabbe and Goyle paused fighting over each other's breakfast sausages and looked up expectantly at the enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall. Owls were swooping down from the great blue dome, the sunlight streaming through their outstretched feathers.
Draco groaned out loud and collapsed back onto his bed, burying his face in his hands and then running his fingers tiredly through his hair.
But then again,  he was sure.  Harry's head was starting to throb.  This was all too much.  He just wanted it to stop.  He'd rather duel Voldemort right here and now rather than admit out loud what he was thinking.  He was determined not to admit it.
Harry saw Draco's sad eyes, and as they parted, the Slytherin could see the worry immediately cloud the shorter boy's youthful face.
"Been given a clean bill of health now, have we. . ." Ron mumbled, following Hermione's gaze with a wary eye.
His voice seemed to bounce off of the walls, mocking him. He closed his eyes and focused on his breathing. Just one breath at a time, right? So simple.
Harry swallowed hard and raked his fingers through his disheveled raven black hair. "Yes, Malfoy and I are. . ," he stammered, struggling to find the right words. "A thing? Dating? Uh, I don't quite know. I'm not sure."
looked at him. He could still feel himself trembling. He could still see Harry's emerald eyes locked on his from across the room, remembering how his heart had begun beating wildly in his chest. Enemies and friends never looked at each other like that. Never.
A large, fierce-looking owl suddenly appeared from around the tower and flew clumsily in through the window, landing roughly on Harry's knee, talons digging into his skin through his pajama bottoms.
"Loads," Draco gasped, running a hand through his somewhat disheveled mop of hair. "Thank you for staying with me, Potter."
"My dear children," she began, her eyes looking ever so large behind her thick, black glasses. "Today, you will be looking into the future! But, this time, we are looking far, far ahead. We will be looking far beyond your years here and into the decades ahead."
"Alright, but only because you have regained the ability to walk." Pansy quipped with a smirk as she turned to follow the rest of the class out into the crowded hall.
Hermione looked hesitant, but she walked inside, chancing one last anxious glance back at Harry. "Be careful." She warned him.
Feeling violently ill, Harry shoved the ball away with a forceful push, making it roll off of the table and shatter into pieces on the floor with a loud
Ron put his hands in his pockets and waited for Harry to catch up before starting to walk back to the Gryffindor common room,  an awkward silence filling the 12-inch gap between them. Nonetheless,  the silence was better than nothing. Harry was grateful for his forgiveness.  He knew he had been neglecting him and Hermione for the past several weeks,  but he hadn't realized just how much. He'd been so absorbed in Draco's-
Harry rolled his eyes and folded his arms around his knees, only just then realizing he had forgotten to get his robes from Malfoy. Oh well. He'd have to ask at dinner. He would have remembered if it wasn't for Snape. . .
Draco grimaced as he wrested open his tall, heavy window and helped the old bird up onto the grimy ledge. The sticky early September air suddenly filled the room as he watched his bird fly into the stormy, leaden sky, wings silhouetted against the looming clouds.
Harry felt his eyes burn as tears filled them. He felt again for a pulse, but it was hopeless. There was nothing. Harry threw himself on top of the body, pressing his head against the Slytherin's shallow chest. Still, he heard nothing, not even so much as the faintest of heartbeats. The room was silent, and all he could hear was the sound of the air rushing through his ears and the sound of his own panicked breathing and his heart hammering against his rib-cage.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco quickly cut him off, reaching out to shove the boy up against the opposite compartment. He could feel Harry's hurried breath hot on his face. Draco saw directly into the boy's wide, bewitching eyes. It drove him mad. He couldn't have him. He could never have him. Why was he so gorgeous, damn it!?
Sure enough, blood was pooling from Draco's ears and his nostrils, and a little even dribbled at the corners of his pale mouth. Although Harry hated the petty Slytherin with enthusiasm, he couldn't help but feel concerned at the sight of the frail, weak boy as he lay there bleeding in the dirt, his pearlescent skin glistening in the rain. This time, it wasn't play. There was no hippogriff loitering about the Hogwarts grounds.
Madame Pomfrey's face darkened, and she looked up at Harry with sad eyes. "He's gone, Harry. . . He's gone."
Harry turned to the large, stone statue and said the words, "Sherbet lemon," and the gargoyle jumped aside, revealing a slowly ascending circular staircase. Upraised voices could instantly be heard, and Draco felt his insides contract. He felt like he might vomit.
"Oh, god," she whispered, reaching out to touch an odd lump in the Slytherin's left wrist. "That's definitely shattered. Harry, you need to take him to the hospital wing right now. Merlin's pants! He's bleeding! Harry, quick!"
The Headmaster took a step closer to the bed and looked down into the boy's sunken face. "When Narcissa and Lucius arrive, I will be here. We must keep Draco safe. Now, if you'll excuse me. . ." Dumbledore turned, his long, garish gown swishing behind him as he walked out of the infirmary leaving Madame Pomfrey looking completely baffled.
Draco begins feeling violently ill, and he injures himself very badly. Harry heroically swoops into the rescue.
Draco nodded again and gazed up at Harry with glistening eyes. He swallowed hard, the lump in his throat painful and unmoving. "I'm scared, Potter," he whispered.
With that, Draco watched as The Chosen One turned sharply on his heel and walked calmly up the stone steps. Ron and Hermione quickly joined their friend at his side, asking him what the hell was wrong with him and why he was so worried about Draco Malfoy of all people. The Slytherin could hear their patronizing voices, and he snarled in disgust and anger. He hated them. He hated them with everything he had.
Harry finally tore his eyes away from the ball and set it down on the rickety wooden table beside his bed, twisting his head to look at Ron with his eyes still swimming.
Panting, he grabbed the slender boy and hoisted him into his arms. Surprisingly, he wasn't much heavier than Hedwig, and that was what alarmed Harry the most. No 15-year-old boy should be as light as feathers.
Dumbledore hummed in acknowledgment and then looked up at Madame Pomfrey hopefully. "Has Harry stopped by at all recently?"
Harry stood to catch one before sinking back into his cushion on the floor and gazing at it in silent wonderment. He rolled the smooth crystal between his fingers, watching the colors fade and swirl. It almost looked as if it had a pulse, a tiny little heartbeat. It fit perfectly in his palm. It was nearly the same size as a baseball.
"Look, mate," he began in a quiet, raspy voice. "I get it. Yes, you were a complete git, but you had your reasons. I mean, I would have acted the same if I had been in your situation. I know I would have. I thought about it a lot, and this thing between you and Harry will always be a bit  . . . weird for me, but, honestly, I'm glad for it." He hugged his knees to his chest and rested his head against the wall as he stared out the window into the starry night sky. He laughed. "I never took Harry for a fairy, although I will admit, I wondered about you a few times. Caught you starin' once or twice, and had a right laugh about it, so thanks for that. 'Mione thought I was mental. She still owes me an apology."
"I suppose I have," Lucius replied bitterly, glaring at the Headmaster with an expression very similar to Draco's. "But I will say one more thing," he approached his son slowly, the floor creaking noisily beneath his feet.
Ron bobbed suddenly into view on his rickety old broom, his pale, freckled cheeks a cherry-apple red. Hermione was sitting behind him, clinging onto him for dear life. She looked terrified.
He wasn't fine.  He was panicking.  In the Main Hall, when he was looking at Draco,  he had felt something,  and it was a feeling he knew well.  He'd previously acquainted it with Cho Chang,  but that little spark of interest had long since died, along with his interest in girls and dating. He remembered it all too well, though...
Professor Snape looked down at Draco with a shocked expression,  as if he'd been struck.  For a moment, the man didn't speak.  He simply watched Draco as he cried, shoulders heaving.  It almost reminded Snape of himself. . .
Malfoy's eyes widened, and a look of sudden excitement spread across his face as he opened his robe and pulled out a folded piece of paper. "I-I forgot! I don't know how," he sniffed and handed it to Harry. "It's from Dumbledore. He's transferring me from Slytherin."
Professor Trelawney, a beaming smile plastered on her face, flicked her wand, and more than a dozen glittering stones flew from her desk and began to fly wildly around the room.
Draco nodded slightly. "Yes," he twirled a lock of Harry's jet-black hair between his fingers. "That, and because I had to." A sudden sadness filled his eyes, his lips tightening with unspoken regret. "I'm sorry," he whispered.
"Damn Divination to hell," Draco groaned, as he continued to stroke the back of Harry's head comfortingly. "We should toss all those ridiculous things off a cliff."
"Thanks, you old fart," Draco stroked the bird's feathers lightly, gazing miserably into it's dilated orange orbs. "Go sleep! You're probably tired. Okay?"
There was no way... “Oh. Good one,” he chuckled as he recovered. Malfoy seemed closer to an enemy than a rival, albeit less deadly than Voldemort.
Harry nodded absently. He didn't really care about classes right now, but knowing the chalk markings had specific meanings and purpose made him wary of smudging them. "Where do I need to go?" he asked.
Snape's eyes suddenly narrowed, studying Harvey's face, then darted briefly to Harry's own, and back again. "Very well," he said. I defer to your expertise..." he paused an extra, skeptical moment before addressing Harvey by name, "Malfoy."
"Malfoy," Snape greeted Harvey, with a polite nod. He hesitated, then nodded stiffly at Harry. "Potter. I did not realize you were to be part of the proceedings." A familiar judgmental tone came back into his voice, but it didn't seem to be directed at Harry for once.
André shook his head no, and Harry didn't work up the courage in time to volunteer, so Harvey turned back to the book and, without ceremony, stabbed all the way through it, into the table below. It spurted ink like heart's blood, but otherwise didn't seem to react
Draco stood tiredly on the platform, awash in the throng of excited Hogwarts students; his head bowed as he strived to avoid eye-contact with anyone he knew. That wasn't easy, but he didn't mind keeping up the effort. He didn't much feel like a friendly conversation today, and he particularly lacked the wits he required for a chat with Potter.
Harry smiled broadly. Again checking to make sure no one was watching, He flicked the paper and then watched as the unicorn leaped off of the table and galloped silently across the room towards Draco. Feeling a bit nervous, he returned to his book, now staring at where the page had been. . . He chanced a peek and felt a smile tug at his lips again. Draco met his gaze and tentatively smiled back at him over the paper, his cheeks tinged a rose pink.
No sooner had the words slipped out of Draco's mouth then he suddenly flew across the room and smacked into the wall with a loud
Draco opened his own book and was about to start reading when his own eyes skittishly wandered. Harry quickly looked away, feeling embarrassed. He hated this feeling. He hated that he knew what it was. His mouth felt dry, and he felt his stomach tying itself into knots, but he looked back up again, only to briefly meet the Slytherin's cool gaze. The two boys' eyes widened almost at once, and they both turned back to their books. The words all seemed cluttered together. Suddenly, a thought hit him. . . He felt a smile tugging at his lips, and he checked to make sure Hermione or Ron wasn't watching before he pinched a page between his fingers and slowly began to pull. He soundlessly tore it out. He drew his wand out of his sleeve and discreetly pointed it at the paper.
The paper was cool and crisp, and Draco's meticulous script appeared boldly in ink across the exterior of the carefully folded parchment. The paper's edges were somewhat yellow from decay, but the smell of fresh ink strongly lingered upon the mysterious envelope.
roughly dragging the sleeve of his romper across his mouth. "Well, now you have." He pushed back his plate. "I need all the energy I can get."
was one thing, but seeing them apart was another entirely. Harry was happy as could be, but deep down, something was troubling him, and he was determined not to talk about it. Draco, on the other hand, whenever he thought no one could see him, he would dissolve into tears of pain and anguish.
"Piss off!" He yelled, making Snape glare narrowly at him from across the classroom. "Sorry, Professor." Finally, unable to lift his eyes to meet Ron's confused gaze, he began to speak in soft, muted tones, his voice conflicted. "Look, there's nothing you can do about it, okay? Once it's there, you can't get rid of it. I just have to deal with it. And yes, it hurts!" a vulnerable look washed over Malfoy's twisted features, catching Ron off-guard. "It feels like it's roasting, but all I can do is try to ignore it. You should, too."
Ron met his gaze, and the Slytherin tried to look away from him, but he was determined. Pushing back his chair, Ron made his way to the cupboards in the back of the classroom and began rifling through the ingredients, signaling for Malfoy to join him.
He watched as his older self lifted his head, his hair wildly disheveled, his eyes red and swollen. He grabbed something lying on the sofa beside him and clutched it to his chest, his body shaking violently with silent grief.
Draco nodded breathlessly, his body doubled over, his arms resting on his knees as he gulped in air, the letter he had written just a few weeks prior crumpled up in his fist.
The old bird swooped down, wings flapping violently as it clumsily perched itself on the edge of the table carrying The Daily Prophet in its tired beak.
"I don't see how it could get any worse, Professor." Madame Pomfrey whispered, lowering her tone. "He hasn't woken up in a month."
Beneath the table, Harry felt Draco brush his hand and gingerly weave their fingers together. He smiled softly and glanced sideways at the Slytherin. He was sneering down at his plate.
The lamplight was dim, but it was enough for Draco to make out the peaceful look on Harry's face as he slept, and the Slytherin felt his heart swell inside his chest. He was sitting on the floor by the window, letting his fingers swim soothingly through the smaller boy's thick mess of tangled black hair. He admired the way the moonlight shone on Harry's face, and he quietly cursed himself for having fallen so hard for The Boy Who Shouldn't Have Lived.
Harry nodded and listened to the sound of her retreating footsteps before immediately kneeling beside the cot. He retook Draco's cold hand and pressed it to his lips.
It was quiet on this side of the castle, as silent as the grave. Not even the mice seemed to stir as they slept quietly in their nests. Just the sound of Draco's labored breathing seemed to fill the lavatory and echo off of the walls and corridors of Hogwarts. He gagged, his stomach clenching, and he gripped the dripping sides of the porcelain sink for support, trembling weakly. He wasn't sure how much more of this he could take! His body was falling apart, and he didn't know what to do. Madame Pomphrey had given him express orders to stay as calm and relaxed as he possibly could over the course of the coming school year. She said it was critical to his health and warned him specifically to get extra rest and nutrition. Draco scoffed. As if his kind of life would permit him anything of the sort!
