He then had the sudden urge to look over at Potter. He did, and saw the Golden Boy, Saint Potter, looking at the 3rd year in front of Draco with pure, unadulterated loathing. He was very confused. But he had to deal with one problem at a time.
They then had a discussion about the wings, and why he had them. No Veela had ever had wings before. Granted, he was the only male Veela ever created, so maybe he had some quirks. Yeah, that was it! He had always been a little quirky, maybe that had projected into his DNA and then this change.
He could not lead his eyes away from Malfoy the whole way to the Gryffindor House table, nor when they sat down. And continued to stare at the back of the other boys head.
"I forgot how loudly Blaise snored after being away from him for so long." She said. I agreed, and smiled at her still being wrapped up like a burrito on the ground.
6 Days Later
"Mom! It's not funny!" He whined, which only made her laugh harder. He strained again and lifted them off of his mother's body, releasing her.... But he could not control them past that. They bent and fluttered, until he willed them to close... And they did, snapping inwards, throwing him several feet forward.
Harry stands still and quiet for a long time before exploding and saying; "Draco! That's amazing!!! I'm so happy for you!!!"
"What are you doing in here?" I asked.  She groaned as she stretched.
I was so preoccupied give this kid a nice new cavity in the side of his face, I nearly didn't catch Malfoy's glance over to me before he answered. "I'm sorry, but I can't accept your invitation." And gave the sweetest smile I had ever seen on Malfoy's face.
"My Grandmother of 7 generations before me was a Veela, and so I became what I am now." He explains to Harry.
At this point, Harry is blushing too and thinking about how cute Draco looks. He wants to share his thoughts, but of course he couldn't, he still remembers the prickly personality of the other boy, though he has changed.
When she moved out of the way of the showers, I strolled over, undressed and jumped inside the steaming glass case.
I pondered my situation. 'Girls stare at me in awe. No good, I'm gay. Okay, I heal almost instantly. That's cool I guess. And I can regrow my fingernails. ....Yay ....I am so screwed.'
Then a small boy, a third year it seemed, stood from the Ravenclaw table and hurried over to Malfoy ignoring his glare and shrieking; "WILL YOU PLEASE GO OUT WITH ME!?" I hated this kid. Absolutely LOATHED him. I glared at him, hoping it would burn a hole in his head. But alas, it didn't.
I finally arrived to the cabin that Pansy, Blaise and I always shared, every year without fail. I opened the door to find an extra guest sitting next to Blaise. It was.... Weasley.
Draco's POV
"Ummm.... Since halfway through last year." Says Weasl- Ron. I throw up n my mouth a little. "I'm gonna have to start calling him by his first name, aren't I?" I ask Blaise. "Yep." He responds.

"And," Remus said, grinning ear to ear. "I am assigning partners!!!"
Thank you for reading! Another chapter will be out soon, along with other stories, so if you like what I write be sure to follow me!!!
I have always fancied Potter. Always wondered if he thought of me. Always wished he did. And so I've made my decision.
"Hey Draco. Potter is staring at you." Said Blaise. He looked around to the Gryffindor House table, and saw many people, including Potter, watching him.
He flew and flew, until dark. Told his parents about the feeling of the air around his wings, blowing into his face, and the wind whistling in his ears. And when it was time for sleep, he went to bed felt truly free.
This time, only groans are heard.
Ans as he stared and stuttered, Draco slouched down where he was standing, rubbing his arm, and blushing in embarrassment
7:30 a.m
He got nearly a fourth of the way to the large double doors of the Great Hall, before the people started swarming him, asking him out. He just continued forward, ignoring them all. Once he was out, he proceeded to the Astrology Tower. He stopped there to take a breather before classes started.
And with one thought, and a flash of golden light, Draco stood there, wings spread wide. With one Harry Potter standing across from him, staring in amazement, mouth agape and eyes wide.
"Okay." I say, letting it show on my face that I do not believe her one bit. She continues to read her spellbook, but her red color does not fade the entire ride to Hogwarts. Once we get there we are greeted by the thestrals pulling the carriage. We can see them because my goldfish died while Pansy and Blaise were over at my house. We pet the one pulling our carriage of choice and then climb inside.
He spent the following night reading, lost in a personal journal of one of the masters. The scholar who left the book behind read two paragraphs out of the whole thing and cursed the author all day as he attempted to duplicate the results; a soul summoning spell the master recorded having cast to talk to an old friend.
“Then I will leave you alone, but,” and Narcissa hesitated here, “I don’t really think you want to be alone with your thoughts just now, do you?”
“Yes, thank you,” Draco added.
When his anger was spent, he collapsed into the embrace and cried for the loss of his mum and dad, for the long nights he’d spent unloved, hungry, hurting, for the life he should have had. He mourned the death of his godfather and the second chance they’d lost. He thought of the destruction of innocence, of his horrible childhood, and as his sobs gave way to exhaustion and spent emotions, he registered the warmth of the embrace, of the scent of jasmine, of the strength of the woman who held him in sharp contrast to the softness of her voice telling him that it was alright, whatever he was feeling, it was allowed and he was going to be alright. The last thing to register was that it was the quietly dignified Narcissa Malfoy who was sitting on the floor holding him as though it was the most normal thing in the world for her to do. He took her offered handkerchief and worked on his face as his breathing slowly returned to something close to normal.
Harry took a moment to turn, face Neville and look him right in the eye. "See you on the other side." Then he moved, striding purposefully across the deck to take his place near the bow.
Almost.
He had seen the light leave his greatest enemy's eyes.
Harry’s brows rose as that concept sunk in. “He did?”
Harry’s breaths came in short hiccups and he slowly unfurled his fists and wrapped his arms around his own body in a stance reminiscent of the many times in his life that he’d had only himself to find comfort in. He was tired, tired of being angry, tired of fighting, tired of crying, just so fucking tired. His eyes squeezed tight as he fought the sobs that threatened to break through.
"He's ruining everything!" the dark lord raged.
They both knew how true that was. Only a lunatic would ram one wooden ship into another at high speed in the middle of the ocean. The one thing no one accused Sirius of being, since his time in Azkaban, was sane.
So what did belong to him?
Harry turned back and opened the small door.  Inside he found a folded bit of parchment and a small box.  Unfolding the note, he read the elegant script:
Or maybe it was because he did not feel this was the end.
“Wow,” Draco said when he finally landed and looked around. “This is amazing. I never expected anything like this. Did you do the spellwork?”
Draco gasped at the sudden plunge into near darkness, but soon the sky was filled with twinkling stars. “Merlin, this is gorgeous,” he said quietly and they lay there in silence for several long moments, just enjoying the beauty of the night sky.
"No, you just keep yelling 'Get closer! Get closer!'"
"Does he know how to
Those loyal to the dark lord retained their lands but often found themselves battling pirates to make the journey to the capital. It became more common to pick a place and stay, rather than take the risk to travel back and forth.
“I’d like to talk to you all about the house.”
“We normally take breakfast at nine, dinner at half one and tea at six with tea being our lighter meal as I rest better that way. Would that be acceptable for you?”
“Why? Not that I’m complaining, mind,” Draco added quickly.
Scorpius nodded vigorously and reached for his daddy. He settled into Harry’s arms and looked over at his papa. They moved together to the bed and Harry leaned over so Scorpius could give his papa a kiss and then showed him the girls.
“Are they- can I?” Draco couldn’t even finish the sentence, it appeared his emotions were getting the best of him.
Searching tirelessly, he would find the clone in the lab. Harry Potter would take his hand or hold his shoulders as they looked into each other's eyes.  No one else ever looked the clone in the eye.  Potter would know what he was, but would not care. He would treat him like a person, offer him autonomy and a chance to fight at his side.
"Alohomora!"
“You’re welcome, Harry.  Happy day one.”
Sorry this is a couple days late.  It's been a week.  I don't understand why I need to deal with people in order to work for a living.  That shouldn't be a thing.
I hope you don't mind me calling you Draco - the Potter/Malfoy thing reminds me too much of my teenage years and wasn't that just a picnic. Anyway, I’m writing because every attempt to actually talk to you since the start of the school year has been sidelined by someone or something. The sheer volume of work involved is beyond anything I imagined. Being the Defense teacher is, surprisingly, very different from my time running the DA. I dunno about you but my students seem to love getting detention, the grading and lesson planning is driving me spare and, Merlin, the staff meetings. I thought Binns was bad as a teacher. I know you agree with me on that, we had matching eye rolls yesterday.
“Mmhmm,” Harry mumbled, tearing the greens into the large salad bowl. Making the salad by hand was helping Harry expel some of the tension that had been building all day. He was grateful he’d had the time to walk it off, to absorb the news before he got to share it with Draco. He heard Draco take in a sudden breath and turned to look at him.
Harry nodded. “You're right. Best to be sure everything is as fine as it appears to be.”
The ensuing silence felt heavy but not as uncomfortable as before, not after Harry’s confession. Draco wasn’t sure exactly what he thought about tonight’s revelations but there was no denying that things between them were shifting and if he were honest with himself, which he tried to be most of the time, he hoped it would lead them forward at least as friends. Merlin knew Draco could use a good friend.
"I saw Draco over there right before he left," the scholar burning his chest said with a distracted air.
Draco chuckled, nuzzling Harry’s cheek before pulling back to look into his eyes. “Our last birthdays as single Wizards. Are you excited?”
“You are going to be the best big brother ever and take good care of your little brother or sister.”
“Yes, I’ve disillusioned the space just above the rooftops here. We can race back and forth, just don’t land anywhere, but here and don’t fly too high. The spell only covers about twenty feet.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, taking his seat and rubbing his eyes under his glasses.
They'd lost their forward momentum but it didn't seem to phase Sirius at all. The small man visible on the high deck bounced on his toes in excitement. His booming cry was as though he spoke with the voice of the ship herself. "Open the gun ports!" he bellowed. A moment later came the directive, "Fire!"
Draco couldn’t quite imagine how this worked but he was very curious and nodded in response, not trusting his voice much at the moment. The friendliness between them was still new and strange.
“I will be doing so, Mr Potter,” she said before turning her attention back to her cleaning.
"See you on the other side!" Sirius called to Harry with a wave and whoop of excitement. For having such a dominant personality, Sirius was a small man. He stood on his tiptoes, hat held high, straight black hair in a wild explosion around his head, to be sure his adopted nephew saw him. Harry waved back, a fond grin at his uncle's antics.
“Hmm, well, I’ll have to think. In the meantime, tell me what happened at Mungo's. Did they give you something for the nausea?”
It had been controversial, to allow someone to give a blow-by-blow on the battle. Harry had been nervous but allowed himself to be talked into giving it a try.
Did the clone possess a soul? If so, he hoped he did not share his with Draco Malfoy. They were way too alike for his comfort, but he did not want to think of himself as nothing more than a second Draco.
*2 months later*
After a very thorough examination and a number of questions, the doctor sat on his stool and looked at them both. “Well, I know why things are so different and so much tougher than last time. Want to see?”
Both Lucius and Draco shifted stiffly, but neither looked directly at Harry. In fact, Draco hadn’t looked at him once since they arrived which he found a little strange. He looked at the boy who had been the centre of so much of his attention in school and saw none of the proud, haughty child he’d been. It was disconcerting. Harry turned his attention back to Narcissa and nodded. “I agree,” he said quietly. Slapping his hands lightly on his denim covered knees, he licked his lips and began. “Right, so. I don’t like a lot of rules, but I do think a few will make this all go better. First, you are free to use any rooms in the house except for the left side of the second floor. That’s my bedroom and study and is strictly off limits. I will consider your bedrooms off limits to me as well. Everyone needs a private space. I’ll show you around the house tomorrow.”
He didn't count.
“Easy, love.”
The air turned cold and crisp, threatening the first snowfall of the season and the morning sun did little to heat the room as it streamed in through the large windows.  Harry stirred, smelling breakfast, but not yet ready to get out of bed. He reached for his wand, then remembered the no magic rule, called for Darby and soon had a blazing fire. He sank back into the luxuriously soft sheets and many pillows, blinking to full wakefulness as a mug of coffee was placed on his bedside table next to his glasses and his journal.  He stretched lazily, grateful he could tell his strength was returning slowly, day by day.
“Let’s go into the sitting room,” Harry directed and he called for Winky while Ron led the group in.
"It!" Draco corrected harshly.
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, the surprise clear on his face.
His body certainly wasn't his. Anyone Voldemort allowed in the lab could do with the clone's body as they wished. There were rules, of course, like they were not to leave permanent marks, but the clone had no say in those either.
so I appreciate you responding to this request.  I think Minerva was surprised how pissed I was but then, she didn’t know the extent of the controlling arseholes in my life until I explained - there are some things you just don’t share with the world, you know?
“Is that…” Draco’s voice trailed off as he watched in fascination while the image turned slowly in front of them.
Harry felt a growing respect for the Malfoy matriarch, her gaze direct and her words quiet and polite. After thinking for a moment, he responded by calling for Winky and then turning back to her. “What times do you normally take your meals?”
“Scared, Draco?”
And they did. Starting with the unconscious, one by one, Harry’s men were lifted on shoulders, and passed up into the safety of the sunlight. One by one, the pirates holding the line against those trying to kill them grew smaller until all that was left were Harry and Cedric.
Draco answered, never taking his eyes from the bassinet. “I’m tired, sore and groggy. I don’t remember that from last time.”
The hodge-podge of the ship seemed to fit the personality of the Weasley clan perfectly. As soon as someone explained to Harry how the leaky bucket stayed afloat he would worry about the even more unbelievable feat of ‘The Burrow’ keeping up. Not even magic could explain that.
The clone never bothered to learn any of the names of the other occupants in the lab. That seemed fair to him, as they hadn't cared enough to give him one.
Harry,
The battle has begun but not everything goes to plan...
With Cedric gone, Harry would have no one to hold the pressing enemy at bay.  Drained as Harry was, there were no options that gave him a chance at escape. Harry did not have the energy to meet his friends eyes. “Your turn, Diggory. That’s an order.”
Arthur & Molly
Ron, Hermione, Molly, Arthur, Narcissa and Lucius all looked at each other, eyes wide.
Harry relaxed a touch. He hadn’t missed that Draco actually looked at him and he counted it as a win.
On an entirely different note, I know there is so much about you I still don’t know. These letters have helped me to get to know the real you, not just the Harry I always pictured in my head, complete with bias and blind assumptions. The Harry in my head was either completely frustratingly perfect or the devil incarnate. I like the real one better. He’s sweet, he’s funny, he’s playful, he’s thoughtful and pensive, he’s considerate, he’s cocky sometimes, but also he’s impatient, rash, occasionally thick, and insecure as well. I want to know everything. I want to know all about your past, all the pain, the laughter, the firsts, the embarrassing moments. I want to know all your weird quirks and idiosyncrasies. Here’s one of mine for free. I hate mushrooms. Don’t tell me you know a way to cook them that’s really good and you’re sure I’ll like. I’ve heard it all before. I’ve tried them sauteed, in duxelles, fresh in salads, baked into quiches, stuffed with cheese, you name it. I don’t like mushrooms. And don’t try to sneak them into things thinking I won’t notice so that then you can say, “That had mushrooms in it by the way! Wasn’t it still good?” I WILL KNOW. Every other person that has tried it has gotten a tight polite smile, but given our history and the warning I am issuing you now, if you try it, I will hex you. If the ministry chucks me in Azkaban for hurting the great Harry Potter, I will accept the kiss with a smile. They are a fungus. They taste like rubbery dirt. See, are we having fun yet? If you choose to continue this half-witted scheme of yours and insist on continuing in my company you can look forward to more of those fun little revelations.
“I would likes that. I’ll be the bestest big brudder in da whole world,” Scorpius exclaimed as he held his arms out wide to show just how much he liked the idea.
Where to begin? Let’s start with dinner, that shepherd's pie was incredible. When you told me you made it and not the elves I nearly fell out of my chair. I didn’t even know they had professor’s quarters with kitchens. Did you add it yourself, or request it, or what? That didn’t even occur to me till I got back to my rooms. Also, where did you learn to cook like that? I meant to ask but it was so incredible I just forgot, and then well... you know. I suppose I got a bit distracted...
“Harry!”  A welcome voice called out from the doors leading up to safety.
Scorpius’ response was to pout and put his face in Harry’s neck.
“You’re welcome...Harry.”
“And I’ll tell you all the gory details, I promise. First though, would you help me get dinner on the table?”
“I’m going to be a father.”
I’m such a coward.
“If you were a witch, I’d swear you were trying to tell me you’re pregnant, but you’re not a witch so…”
Harry
"No!" Draco snapped. A long pale finger shoved into the clone's face. "You do not speak unless spoken too. Do you understand?"
I don’t really want to talk about those days, and those Hogsmeade trips though. I prefer my most recent one.
“I’m ok but you’re right, it is lasting longer and so is everything else. I guess every pregnancy is different,” Draco mused. “I’m just-, Merlin, I'm tired and I swear I grow a size every day.”
“It was Robert Michaels, he was assistant to the lead Auror assigned to the case which gave him access to a lot of information. He faked authorisations to get the rest. It was an act of revenge.”
“I promise,” Harry said, nodding his head in Scorpius’ hands and kissing the end of his nose before handing him to Molly. “Be good for Nana and Poppy, and we’ll see you tomorrow. Love you, champ.”
It was to that empty spot in his life that Harry addressed his final thought.  “I wish I could have met you,” he whispered to the formless void.  “I wish I had been given a chance to know your name.”
“You don’t suppose…” Molly’s voice faded over the unfinished thought.
“Send a couple of your people into the cabins. Those will be tight quarters and fighting won’t be as intense. Just make sure they are checking for traps as they go. The rest of us will investigate the hold.”
He noted everyone else in the lab cowering in fear, the proper response. One advantage to being considered less than human; the clone was ignored at such times, rather than being forced to pantomime a fear he no longer felt. His feelings of detachment grew, being a step apart from everything happening around him.
Heading straight for their target, they would pull up next to them, bow to stern. To prepare, Harry strode to the back of 'The Phoenix' with his men plus Pettigrew.
Harry looked over to his second daughter and stroked her tiny hand. The yellow name bracelet was still blank. "Hello, Narcissa Rose,” he whispered.
His lieutenant understood instantly. “Got it!” Cedric dropped his shielding spell and put both hands on his axe.  His whole body went into the throw. The large two handed axe hurtled end over end across the endless space.  It hit with a sound that shook the ship, cleaving the large wooden beam in two. The halves slipped from their metal holds and fell to the ground.
“He’s not ours.” The pain in that statement was thick in Harry’s voice.  “His choice.”
The pair made their way to the rooftop garden and Draco looked at Harry, who hadn’t yet dismounted.
“It’s how you were raised,” Harry said kindly. “I get that.” As Harry was reaching for the handle, a pop sounded loud enough to make Draco jump, and Winky appeared.
It was mid morning two weeks later when the wards alerted Harry that someone was coming through the kitchen Floo.
He hated the gag.
Harry's pirates were unhinged and Fred and George led the charge in that race. The twins catapulted themselves off the ship together before Ron got to them. Behind them, others, many with the trademark Weasley red hair and patched clothing, were also taking off on their brooms.
Harry glanced to starboard. A galleon, 'The Marauder', with its characteristic low narrow hull, sailed in the Phoenix's wake. Built like a tank, ‘The Marauder’ was nowhere near as fast as the clipper. It was the powerhouse of the trio of ships, designed to haul cannon and to take massive amounts of damage.
"You better not be ordering me to use our lady here like a battering ram." Neville said. His long finger pointed at Harry in accusation.
That was a promise they had not been able to keep. His acquisition of knowledge was a secret the clone guarded carefully.
While the Malfoys retired to their rooms to freshen up, Harry decided now was as good a time as any to make sure the pantry was well stocked. He was just going through Narcissa Malfoy's list when he heard the kitchen door open.
Harry had momentarily lost Draco to Arthur and their shared fascination of all things Muggle as Draco explained the machine that made the candy floss, but Harry didn’t mind. He was happy to share him on occasion. Just then, strong arms wrapped around his knees, and Harry looked down into his godson’s happy face and ruffled his now black hair. “Hey, my Ted, how are you?”
When the pair reached the gates, they turned and looked back at the house. The grim grey stones had been resurfaced in warm tan stone, and the new windows shone in the sunlight. The pointed turret tops had been replaced with a flat roof and family garden. It made Harry smile, knowing it was modeled after his own little oasis that the Malfoys had fallen in love with, and meant that a small part of himself was part of this regal, ancestral home.
“Yes, please, if you are OK with that.”
The clone wiggled with joy when she spoke about freedom. "I hear that when Harry finally finishes off Voldemort, they will come here and emancipate us. They have hidden islands in the archipelago where they take people and other magical creatures they have rescued. There everyone is free. That's what they are fighting for: Independence for all."
It was a foolish notion.  He stared into the faces of certain death, at the men looking back, waiting to kill him, and intellectually knew his life was over.  But he could not help how he felt, that somehow there would be something beyond this moment.
"Not sure why you need me," Neville grumbled. The Phoenix's navigator was a tall man with a high forehead and boyish haircut. This gave him the appearance of someone always waiting for the school yard bullies to show up.
After his friends left, with a promise to be there when the Malfoy’s arrived, Harry scrubbed his face one last time and then made his way to the Floo, his first call to Minerva McGonagall.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up. “That’s an interesting idea. Narcissa was a Black, this house was in her family.” His lips pursed as his mind raced through the option of saying no and what that might mean for the Malfoys and for the Death Eaters that might escape without Lucius’ testimony and information. He closed his eyes, and a whispered “fuck” escaped as he understood clearly what his answer would be.
“They’re fine,” Hermione said as she reached over and touched Harry’s hand. Her fingers brushed lightly over the words scarred there.
Harry scooped his little boy into his arms. “I know, darling, but Papa isn’t feeling well and we need to let him rest, ok?”
Hermione came to stand beside Harry, bussing his cheek with a kiss as she took over the tea making. “Go on,” she said softly, “finish your breakfast.”
“Hey mate,” Ron said cheerfully as he took a seat at the table and grabbed a chocolate biscuit.
If the head of the magical government possessed a body, he would have been pacing. Instead, he darted back and forth over tables and through stands of equipment, in restless agitation. Parchment swept along in his passing, scattering across the cold, sterile floor.
“Let’s,” Draco replied, stealing a quick snog before he turned around and waved his hand to open the gates.
“It’s not, not really,” Draco said, “thankfully. Every trace of him is gone as well as who we were before. It reflects all the changes this family has been through and I, for one, am glad of it.”
“To be honest, I would prefer to leave. We’ve done what we came to do,” Harry mused, looking around. “But I’m not leaving a man behind.  We might as well check for the Horcrux while we’re here”
“I’m sorry, love,” Harry said as he stood and lifted Draco’s head enough to slide onto the sofa, then lowered it into his lap. He touched Draco’s forehead and noted the perspiration there. He took in the paler than usual skin tone, and the way Draco’s arms were around his midsection. “Have you eaten anything today?”
looking for a new challenge, so yes, a date.  It’ll be fun and has the added bonus of really
“Kill them all.” Voldemorts voice was a hiss, somehow louder than the sound of the battle.
Harry felt a warm breath on his cheek and looked over to find Draco looking at him rather than the stars. Up close, Harry could see the flecks of silver and pale blue in his grey eyes and he nearly forgot to breathe. “Yeah, it is,” he whispered as he lifted his free hand and ran the backs of his fingers over the soft skin of Draco’s cheek.
Tears ran freely down Luna’s face.
"Does he know he needs some other weapon besides his wand?" Neville asked.
Harry nodded the tiniest bit, afraid to retrigger his upset tummy, though, he smiled at Draco’s concern. He never got tired of the loving way Draco took care of him.
“I think that’s the first time I’ve laughed since we got here,” Draco said through the last of his giggles.
“Molly’s. She popped over with bread and preserves and offered to take him for the night. She could tell that I was just not doing well. She said Ron and Hermione were over with the kids, so Scorpius would have someone to play with. I asked her to tell them that we won't be there for our playdate tomorrow.”
"Here we go again, mom." He could feel the spirit of his parents on either side of him but it was the ocean he addressed. His mother sea rocked lovingly beneath him and the breeze tossed at his curls. He took a deep breath and began. "Beat hands to quarters!" The tone of Harry's voice dropped into a much lower register as he bellowed the opening command.
In the quiet of the night the lab emptied, leaving the clone blissfully alone. He spent his time wandering the series of rooms that made up his whole world. A journal, left out and open, written by one of the old masters, contained magical theory for the dark spells a scholar used in an experiment.
The dark lord swept bottles off the shelves lining the walls as he passed. All containers in the lab had long since been reinforced to not shatter on impact with the hard floor. They rolled about on top of the papers. A couple lost their lids and honest dismay flashed in the eyes of the lab workers as they watched the contents empty across the notes.
Your Pans
Harry Potter.
“Now what?” Harry mused, looking down at the stack. “I don’t want them. Do you think your mum might?”
“But how? Are you telling me that she doesn’t actually know?”
He heard the low buzz of conversation before he turned the corner into the kitchen, his brows rising when it stopped at his appearance. “Don’t let me interrupt,” he said as he took a seat at the table and accepted the cup of tea that Hermione slid in front of him. Just then Winky appeared next to him, bowing low.
"There must be a spy feeding him information! Find out who, immediately!"
“Yes, please,” Harry said, taking a deep breath and feeling thankful that he had managed to avoid that particular bit of trouble.
Perhaps both ...hard to tell.
The ‘Phoenix of the Sea’, ‘The Marauder’ and ‘The Burrow’, each so unique, made up the small but deadly force that led the fight against Voldemort.
“No, of course not,” he agreed. “I’ve been thinking about that. I think that it’s finally time to let someone else head up the Aurors. I know you worry and, well, frankly, I’m really going to be needed at home.”
Fun in a purely self-indulgent way, he liked listening to people unseen. It was different from being ignored in a way he would never be able to verbalize. It was thrilling to overhear all sorts of random, useless, wonderful details that people told each other in confidence.
“Mrs Malfoy, I truly am sorry,” Harry said, still angry but not at her.
“Well, that’s all quite mysterious but I’ll indulge you for tonight, as you’re obviously feeling better. However,” Draco said as he crossed the room and dropped his chin on Harry’s shoulder, his hands laying loosely against Harry’s hip bones, “I do want to know what happened at Mungo's. I got your message that you were fine, which I appreciated, but I’d like to know what you learned.”
Cedric put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and stood there.  His figures dug deep as he held on to the man who had led them to victory against the worst monster the magical world had ever known. “See you on the other side, Harry,” he whispered in his ear. The old saying, a wish of luck and safety between warriors going into battle, sounded like a bitter lie on his tongue. He was leaving Harry to his death and they both knew it.
“We can’t open the door!” came an alarmed voice from behind Harry. “It’s iron all the way through!”
Harry relaxed just a touch and nodded. “It does,” he agreed. “I’ll try, with Cissy, though it might take me some time to get used to. I wasn’t taught a lot of manners, but respect for elders was, well, rather heavily enforced.”
Get out an extra plate, I’ll be there in 10 minutes. I’d be there sooner but this bloody castle is huge and our stupid colleagues in their infinite wisdom decided to house us on opposite ends of the cursed thing Heading over now.
“Good,” Harry said quietly, then ploughed forward. “Any idea who the leak is?”
Draco took it and read the title, Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads. He stared at Harry and his mouth opened and closed as he looked from the book back to Harry.
No matter where he was or what he was doing, that voice, that attitude always went straight to his groin. The sheer sexiness of this man was intoxicating. Still smiling, Harry placed the roaster on top of the stove and turned, crossing the floor in a few strides to press himself close, offering a chaste but promising kiss on his lover’s lips.
He ran his palm up the side and then around to the front edge. A well-defined gap stared back at him from between the outside of this shelving unit and the one next to it, no thicker than parchment. The next two units did not have such an established separation, the space there partially covered with paint, dirt, and lint.
Dr Smithers gave some final instructions, then he and the nurse left the room.
Later that day, Harry heard the whoosh of the Floo as he was bending over to pull the roasted vegetables from the oven and smiled as he pictured Draco seeing the dining room on his way down the hall.
Harry got up from the chair and let Draco help him into his coat. The gesture melted his heart, like all the kind things Draco did for him. As he turned and adjusted the coat on his shoulders, he was caught in one of those moments where you are just so in love you can barely contain it.
I don’t know where to start. Or even why I’m still bloody writing you when you are literally sitting in the next room. Maybe I just still like the ability to format my thoughts without tripping over myself and saying things wrong. Maybe it’s just easier to write because it seems like every time we have a moment alone together, the second I open my mouth you put your tongue in it. Merlin, you’d think we were sixteen. You realize this is just ridiculously out of control don’t you, Potter? I’m glad we’ve implemented this separate rooms for grading policy or we’d never get anything done. I’m also glad I’m finished before you, or I wouldn’t be able to to write this, thank heavens for my mental superiority. (It’s either mental superiority, or the fact that I’ve stopped assigning essays as punishment and temporarily decreased the amount of school work I assign so I can get back to you as quickly as possible. Not sure which.) Honestly, if it continues like this my students are never going to pass their O.W.L.’s and N.E.W.T.’s.
“Draco, I had Winky make you some ginger tea,” Hermione said, handing him a steaming mug. “It should help your stomach.”
“Are we going to last long enough?” Cedric wasn’t in any better shape than Harry.
“You’re welcome, Harry.  Breakfast?”
“Yeah,” Harry said as he sat the head in the corner. “I’ll be very glad to have these down. Thank you, Draco.”
‘The Marauder’ had not turned one degree to the left or to the right, barreling forward with all the speed the lumbering giant could manage. "The thing about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch," Harry said to no one in particular. Uncle Sirius never understood the concept of flinching.
Harry smiled at Scorpius as he settled himself in the swing with Scorpius on his lap. “He loves it when you make him laugh, just like he loves you right now, even when he’s not well. What if I read you a story?”
“Remind me to thank Molly for the homemade bread,” Draco said as he sipped the tea Harry had made and placed under a warming charm. “It upsets my stomach less than store-bought.”
Not physically.  His cold and naked body remained.  His mind went to a place, a special space that was his and his alone.
“Isn’t that what got us into this mess in the first place?” was the drole reply but the offered hand was taken.
“I’m afraid the most I know how to do is call for a house-elf,” Draco admitted. “Merlin, that sounds shallow.”
“Me too, love,” Draco said with a smile, “me too.”
My father, he told me that I was better than everyone else and that I should be like him, that there were some families that were better than others and it depended on their blood.
That ended the conversation. It was of no value to anyone else, and no one cared if it was valuable to him. The clone stood quiet and still, tears streaming down his face.
Harry’s personal favorite was a bo staff. Spelled to expand out from a small one-foot long handle, the smooth six-foot weapon in Harry’s hands became an extension of his arm. The length allowed him to knock attackers unconscious who were well out of normal reach.
“It’s gorgeous,” Draco said, turning all the way around to take it all in. There was a strange thing that he didn’t recognise next to a small table and chair set. “What’s that?” he asked, pointing.
doing whatever I wanted or thought I should.  I guess I just never spared my professors any thought other than to try and avoid them or stay awake
They kicked off and raced the length of the Grimmauld Place rooftops for several hours and when they finally landed and made their way back downstairs, Lucius was back, and the trials were over.
Draco took in a shuddering breath and then another. Finally, he rasped, “Harry, that’s...that’s not possible.”
Just after lunchtime, Harry and Draco sat in the waiting room at St. Mungo's, Draco’s head resting on Harry’s shoulder.
“Go ahead, open door one.”
“What about Pettigrew?” Cedric asked, taking up his spot next to Harry again.
Having tasted nothing in his life but simple fare, geared towards health, he relished the feast of colours and flavours.
ship miserable.
Harry sighed. “Because I didn't want to upset you. I hoped you'd just go and wouldn't have to know I'd overheard anything. I knew you'd overreact.”
The Malfoy-Potters and their family were all in the back garden on this beautiful summer day in August, watching the children enjoy the rather expansive play area that had been constructed to celebrate the twins' third birthday. The adults lounged nearby, exhausted from the party that had officially ended.
“How are you feeling, Draco?” Dr Smithers asked.
I know I can be oblivious sometimes but after weeks of trying to talk to you with no luck, even I’m not that thick. So, after watching closely, I convinced Minerva a meeting was needed for something or other and that led to quite an interesting conversation and that prompted me to try writing.
“He insisted,” Harry said quietly as he leaned over to kiss his husband’s forehead, “but I’ll make you whatever you think you can eat.”
“Don’t I?” he said quietly. “She saved my life in that forest; it’s literally the only reason I survived to take out Voldemort. That doesn’t even touch the fact that Draco didn’t turn us over at the Manor.” Harry paused, licking his lips. “I never told you but I saw some of what happened when Riddle got to the Manor and found us gone. He...,” Harry’s voice broke, “he tortured him, tortured them.” His eyes squeezed shut as if to try and block out the memory.
“Wait,” Harry couldn't believe it, “there’s two of them?”
I’m sorry. I think I made it all the way back to my rooms before I even realised I’d just left you there, arse on the floor, cheeks flushed, lips swollen and eyes searching and confused.
“Of course,” Harry said, standing when she did. Lucius moved to Narcissa’s side, his hand in the small of her back. Draco stood as well, still never looking at Harry. “Mal...Draco. You’re welcome to join us if you like.” Harry may not like him over much but they were in this situation and he would do his best.
“You’ll still be parentless, yes, I know,” Narcissa said quietly. “I can’t express to you how sorry I am, Harry, that you have lost so much. I’m sorry about Sirius too. He’s another regret I have. I’m glad that you got to know him, however short the time.”
“My babies…” Draco said frantically.
The last of the techs turned out the lights and left him alone. He went looking for the book, eager and excited to return to his reading.
“It’s breathtaking,” Draco said
The stories of Potter were about a man unique from anyone else the clone had ever known; strong and brave, willing to take on the world to protect those who could not protect themselves.
“You’re welcome. Feel free to start whenever you like. Let me know if you need anything.”
His clothes went next: first the shirt, then the trousers. Each taken when a test demanded he stand naked under the tortuous attention of the lab techs. Draco didn't bother hiding the fact he stole them, he simply picked them up and walked out.
He overindulged.
The pirate would not stand in a room and ignore someone because they were different. He believed in the legend of Harry Potter, the fearless man they claimed him to be.
“I’m sorry that happened,” Harry said. “He was a good elf.”
“I have faith in you, Harry,” Hermione said with a smile.
“Rinse and spit,” he said quietly and Draco did, his hand still trembling. Taking the empty glass, Harry set it aside and rinsed the flannel before returning to sit on the floor. He handed the flannel to Draco and leaned against the door, waiting. “You want to talk about it?” Harry asked.
“Why not announce yourself then,” Draco asked, his chin tipped up defiantly.
“Well, there you go. Positive proof you are ill if you do not intend to argue.”
“Humor me,” Harry said as they approached the front desk and checked in.
“Whatever the theme, this dinner is amazing, as always,” Draco declared as he happily munched.
The jets of lights from the attacking spells were heating the wood beneath their feet and fires were beginning to spring up from the intensity. There seemed to be more marines appearing all the time. Were there fifty? ... one hundred? ... two? The blinding light from the spells streaming at them made it impossible to tell. The amount of power Harry was forcing into his shielding spell had the air around them vibrating in protest. His wand began to glow with heat.
He did not feel alone and even more strange, he felt no fear.  A deep peace filled him as he faced his final moments.  Harry had seen enough death to know this was odd.  More than one man had died in Harry’s arms, eyes wide with fear of the unknown.
Draco nodded and moved forward to unlock the bracelet and place it on Harry’s left wrist.  Harry nearly jumped at the strange buzz he felt as Draco’s fingers slid across his skin. Once the bracelet was locked, he lay his hand lightly over Draco’s and gave a slight squeeze.  “It’s beautiful. Thank you!” There was a long silence as if neither wanted to break the moment, then Draco cleared his throat and pulled his hand away slowly.
Regardless, we need to be more careful or people will find out and it’ll be pandemonium. I don’t want to upset what we have.
This was his now in the way only information could be. His mind was his own. No one could take that away from him. The clone cradled this new piece like a great treasure, then retreated.
The leader himself should also be celebrating… and he would.  It was a great victory and he had every intention of enjoying it to the fullest.  But for this moment, he remained alone.  He had been there when Harry Potter had taken his last breath.
“Thrilled,” Lucius said with a scowl.
“She’s a gem, that one,” Harry agreed and laughed when Scorpius began to chant “gem” repeatedly. It was his newest game, to latch onto one word and use it like a battle anthem.
Harry,
Breakfast was an uneventful but awkward affair. After some unsuccessful attempts at polite conversation, Harry was glad when it was over and they could all leave the table.
“There are my two favourite guys in the world,” Draco said fondly as he came into the kitchen.
“What? No, but we’re not…”
Sincerely, Draco Malfoy
“You can kiss my arse, you posh git,” Harry said with a slight grin as he rolled his face into Draco’s neck and inhaled deeply. He loved Draco’s scent.
Draco nodded, looking over the heads thoughtfully. He pulled his wand and tried several spells that Harry didn’t recognise. Finally, he put his wand away and Harry waited, trying to be patient.
“Yes, you are, Scorpius, and you know what?”
Draco Malfoy, however, was a regular visitor.
Harry, but for once we have found common ground. I can’t abide people interfering in my life. I’ve had enough of that for a lifetime. I’m sorry they’ve tried to keep us apart.
“Muggles,” Draco ventured with a hopeful grin as he poured them both juice.
After a subdued dinner, the group retired to the sitting room and moments later, Winky brought tea and biscuits. The Malfoys were all seated together on the large sofa facing the fire, and Harry, Ron and Hermione were scattered about in armchairs with Harry seated the closest. They sat sipping tea for several long minutes before Hermione cleared her throat and looked pointedly at Harry.
He did have one regret, one real wish that he would not live to see fulfilled.  His mind turned to those closest to him:  Ron and Hermione;  Sirius and Remus;  Fred and George;  All were two halves of a whole.
“More than I can say, more than I ever thought I would be,” Harry admitted, his smile content as he looked out over his family and friends.
“Daddy, why can’t I come with you to get my sissers from the hospital?” Scorpius was tired and fussy as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck.
“Hey,” Harry said, his fingers brushing down Draco’s cheek. “You ok?”
Their opponents were about to have a brand-new problem and Harry was content to wait.
As Harry’s voice broke, Draco slipped from his chair and dropped to his knees. He laid his head in Harry’s lap and pressed his face to Harry's belly.
The clone never saw Narcissa Malfoy again.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, reaching for another biscuit. “The real test is after we’ve been in the same house for a while. I’ve no idea how the hell I’m going to manage to survive this, really.”
“Maybe not a size,” Harry chuckled. “But it's true that you look more like you're six months into the pregnancy, not four, and I know you aren’t eating that much. Do you want to go see the doctor? I can take Scorpius over to Molly’s or Narcissa’s for the day. We can get an expert opinion and let you get some rest.”
“But,” Ron repeated, “Kingsley decided he needed a safe house that he was certain would be unbreachable and heavily protected by someone he could trust completely.”
And there it was. The name.
The magical artefact had been stolen from its creator a long time ago and no one could work out how to make another one. It contained three extremely toxic minerals: jade, cinnabar and haematite with a bit of moonstone added in for reasons that went unexplained. All three ingredients were fatal if ingested but combined with Alchemy and magic, they produced an effect that healed and maintained life like nothing else ever discovered.
The pair fell quiet then, working in tandem until all twelve heads were down and in a pile in the corner.
Draco nodded. “I would like that. Mum said the other day she wanted Scorpius to come and spend some time with her. She promised him that he could help her plant the annuals. She also informed me that Darcy had a new cookie recipe that she was saving for Scorpius' next visit. I’ll firecall her in a bit.”
the boarding party," Harry said. His shoulders came up and his head dropped awkwardly. When Pettigrew jumped in, Harry appreciated the distraction.
“Like us?” Scorpius’ face held a questioning look.
“That is very kind of you, Mr Potter. I will have a list for you tomorrow,” Narcissa said quietly. “Mr Potter,” Narcissa began again, her hands clasping and unclasping as she spoke, “Will mealtimes be on a specific schedule? It is what we are used to and I admit to a fondness for a certain order in the household.”
He climbed up on Harry’s shoulders and was pulled to safety.
To be honest, the clone found young Malfoy's open hostility a refreshing change from the clinical interest or complete disregard he received from everyone else. Disliking the man he'd been created from proved another way to engage in life, though not as enjoyable as hearing about his hero.
When you put one hand on my arse wrapped the other around my neck, I didn’t know what to do. I just froze… I… nobody’s ever tried to devour me like that. I felt you against my hip and I was so… surprised. I didn’t think… I…
"I should get your mother home." The senior Malfoy put an arm around his wife and steered her away. "Do not stay too long."
“Are they alright? Anyone hurt?” Harry kept his voice calm, but he hadn’t worked hard to help them bargain the exchange of information for their lives to see it go to shit now, and if he spared a tiny thought for the Malfoy he’d been equal parts exasperated with and fascinated with, well, it was no one’s business but his own.
"He's insane enough for it you mean."
“Harry!” Ron’s panicked voice called down to him. The corner of his mouth twitched up. Maybe he wasn’t alone after all, with his best friend nearby.
(For those who struggle with graphics or listen to stories using audio assisting devices, here’s what’s in the graphic.)
I can’t deny that Binns is just as intolerable now as he was when we were children. I secretly suspect he elongates staff meetings with his droning to see if we can actually die of boredom, thus becoming the start of his very own ghost teaching army to join him in his misery.
He had one more thing that he wanted a space of his own for; The Sorcerer's Stone. His life was linked to that stone; he could not last more than a week without it. Without a daily dose, he quickly lost control over his body and would die.
She turned to leave but Harry spoke up. “Mrs Malfoy?”
“C’mon, Papa, let’s go upstairs.”
“That’s part 2 of today’s gift.  I made it,” he said, his voice taking on an almost shy quality, “for you.”
The clone did not worry someone would see his expression and wonder. Being treated as invisible had its uses, though he did worry about how easily he disconnected from the world around him. Most of the time he felt like an observer, numb to the cares and interests that filled the idle chatter of his world. When not numb, the pain inflicted on him by the living came so intensely he fought to disengage.
“Aright, Daddy. I’ll helps you. I’m a big boy.”
"I know, I know ..." Neville called back. "Close as I can."
“Me too, but you’ll let me know if you need help with anything, yeah mate?” Ron said with a grin.
“We know that when my mum sacrificed herself for me, it gave me protection. Hermione thinks maybe it gave me more than that, that perhaps she gave me her actual magic. She was standing right in front of me and the curse passed through her to me. If her magic left her and latched onto me, it would make sense, explain the crazy things I’ve been able to do. Remus was surprised how quickly I summoned a fully corporeal Patronus and then I survived not only being an actual Horcrux but the killing curse a second time.”
“Feels good,” Harry admitted. “M’sorry I was such a miserable bugger at first.”
“That’s fine, Winky, thank you.” With another bow, she set about her tasks.
A treasure all its own lay behind; a passageway, dusty with disuse. Nothing seemed more beautiful. It was a way out, some place new to explore. His world got much bigger. Dust meant neglect. Did anyone but Voldemort know about these passages?
She paused, her hand on the doorframe.
Draco stood stiffly for a long moment, returning Harry’s direct look before he visibly crumpled and nodded. Harry led him to the sofa and poured them both tea. They chatted about various things, the book Draco was reading, the progress on the house, but eventually Draco’s tension resurfaced, and Harry decided he needed a distraction.
There were no celebrations.  It felt like there would never be a reason to celebrate again.
“The roof garden is really lovely, though perhaps some tweaking to the weather charms would not go amiss,” Draco offered helpfully.
Harry smiled and told Scorpius: “The babies and your papa need quiet. Can you use your quiet voice? If so, I'll take you to see them.”
“It felt right.” Harry paused for a moment, then continued. “This is my quiet place, a place to reset and try to heal. Ron and Hermione are wonderful, but they are moving on, starting their post war lives, Hermione in school, and Ron helping George at the shop and, well, in dealing with their losses as a family. I don’t want to hold them back, you know? Because if they knew how much I’ve struggled, if I shared it with them, they’d figure out I’m more of a mess than I’ve let on, and they’d put things on hold to try to help me and they need the chance to live their own lives. I’ve been, well, stuck. Held back by my own struggles and by a public that won’t let me just live. They all want something from me and it’s just too much.”
“Of course,” Harry agreed and watched Draco move up the stairs. “Draco?”
One more chapter - the morning after!
“So, Scorpius,” Draco began, his arm around his son’s shoulders, “tonight will be a different kind of story, okay?”
And Draco.
Draco made a small sound and Harry squeezed Draco's hand once more.
“Yes, breakfast.”
Hours later, still trying to steady his breathing from the torture of the day, he looked back.  The last tech to leave turned off the lights. With a wave of his hand, they all flared back to life.
The clone was provided a simple white cotton shift and loose fitting trousers, as well as a small journal and quill to record his thoughts. The book had never been private, with techs and scholars often picking it up and leafing through it. The clone never did find out what they searched for.
Fucking Finally!!
A special thanks from Erin to Tami for helping tweak the graphic here.  If you use an audio reader, there is a description of the graphic at the end.
With a passion that scared him, he wanted to get to know his hero. It was so hard to wait when he needed so badly for Potter to save him.
The clone slipped back into the lab just as the main door swung open. The first tech entered, distracted by a conversation with the person behind her, which gave the clone time to get the door closed.
“But,” Harry prompted.
Cedric took a deep breath and tried to return the expression. "Sure, captain. No problem."
“You were wise to wait,” Draco said quietly. “There’s a version of the Expulso curse on them that would have caused a nasty explosion if you’d tried to remove them by force.” He looked from one end of the line of heads to the other. “I can remove it. Each head is protected so this might take a while.”
“Hmmm, well, let’s take a look then and see what’s happening.”
“Mate, that was just weird,” Ron said, taking another bite of his chocolate biscuit.
“Thank you for explaining. I will... I will give that some thought.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, really. I still have some of mine. When we get out of this mess, I’ll show you.”
As he approached the door, Draco turned back and looked at Harry intently. “Potter, thank you.”
“No,” Harry said, the disbelief growing in his gut. “No! I did my part. I defeated Voldemort. I died, for fuck’s sake! I’ve done enough.”
“Well, I inherited it from Sirius but the thing is, I don’t know much about owning a house and I don’t know anything about magical houses. I was thinking, hoping that maybe since we’re stuck here, you all might be willing to help me with it. It’s gloomy and well, not very homey and I’d really like to change that.”
After a long pause, Draco nodded. “I am, though I’m exhausted just thinking about it.”
The next night was Transfiguration.
Draco gave him a tiny half smile and a brief nod, and Harry felt encouraged enough to try chatting while they worked.
Another round of spells drove the Marines back behind crates.  Harry and Cedric took advantage, pushing forward quickly until they were standing beneath the opening.
The Minister shook Harry’s hand and clamped his large hand on Harry’s shoulder before moving toward the Floo. “Alright, I need to get back, the Ministry doesn’t run itself. Harry, let me know if you need anything.”
The clone finds a secret...
"Dobby. He actually died saving me..." Harry’s voice trailed off and a lump formed in his throat.
The Weasley island had been abandoned since the early days of Voldemort's reign, as well as several of the others.
“They’re tiny, Papa,” Scorpius whispered, his eyes wide with wonder. “They’re really gonna need a big brudder cause they’re so little.”
we spent in school and I’ve wondered if we could be friends without the evil shite going on every day.
As to your students proclivities for landing themselves into trouble, I’m not sure what you expected. Children are monsters. Did you forget everything about our years at school? The threat of detention never kept us in line either. Although, I can’t imagine why you have difficulty maintaining order. Perhaps Arithmancy isn’t as fascinating a subject as Defence. I suspect it inspires much less “enthusiasm”. How could it not when taught by the great Professor Potter?
"It took them a while but I think they finally got the balance figured out between people assigned to tame the winds and those attacking. I guess we'll see soon enough." The bright smile growing on Harry's face betrayed his excitement.
Draco’s eyes looked up, his brow furrowed. “For an upset stomach? I think not. I’ll be fine with just some rest.”
"Ah, probably picked it up as a prank."
Harry sat at the kitchen table, his heart pounding and his mind whirling. He revisited what he’d heard in the pantry and what Narcissa Malfoy had confided in their conversation and found a new perspective and a jolt of sympathy for his former nemesis. He was ashamed that he’d never even considered that there might be an alternative truth, reasons for Draco’s behaviour that would explain, if not excuse, his decisions. Harry exhaled heavily as he contemplated himself in Draco’s place. What would he have done to save his mother? He knew, with a wry smile, that he’d have done anything to save her, to still have her with him, even sacrificing his own future. It was a strange feeling, realising that he and Draco had that in common. His thoughts turned to his own life, to his best friends, his found family and how lucky he was to have so many people in his life and the freedom to do whatever he wanted, be whatever he wanted to be.
'That was mine'. He mouthed the words but no one looked at him.
“I know,” Harry chuckled. “You can have some after dinner.”
“However it happened, we’re going to have babies. Two babies that are all us. I’m just…”
I can’t believe we’ve done two rounds together looking for errant students and patrolling the halls and I have yet to respond to your letter. You said you’d be patient, but I don’t know what to do or say around you anymore. Especially not when I secretly wish you’d snog me in a deserted corridor. So thank you.
The clone visualized several responses to the impassioned request to join the pirates. In one, he played coy. "Oh please sir, I couldn't possibly." The details of how he allowed Potter to woo him into changing his mind never failed to lift his spirits.
Well, it was worth a try. The simple incantation opened the lab safe, a level of stupidity that the clone struggled to believe. Did an opening even exist here? Voldemort liked using doors.
As Harry nursed weak tea and toast, Draco had his breakfast and discussed their day.
All the while, Voldemort’s voice was calling for their blood.
“Hermione does have a guess how it might have happened, mostly because it’s me.”
She inclined her head slightly and made her way upstairs.
Ron nodded and then turned to look his best friend right in the face. "You know this is a trap though, right?"
"He and his friends took on a troll and won!" She prattled to her working companion of the day.
“I missed you too,” Harry murmured into Draco’s neck. “Dance with me?”
“You may not believe me and I wouldn’t blame you,” Narcissa continued, “but that night, in the forest, I wasn’t just trying to save my son, I was trying to save Lily’s son too. We weren’t friends but I knew her and James well enough to know they’d have done the same for my son, for any child.” As she spoke, she walked slowly toward where Harry stood sobbing, approaching as though he were a skittish animal. “I’m so so sorry you lost them, darling, so very sorry.” When she reached him, she stood close but not touching, her own tears falling unchecked. “I know your Molly has stepped in as a substitute mother admirably but, Harry, I’m the one who’s here, now, and I’m also a mother. I can’t change the past but I can try and be a better mother to Draco and well, I’d like to help you too if you’ll let me.” Narcissa opened her arms and waited.
What was the source of this unexpected calm?
Turning to look in amazement at his friend, Harry felt a swell of affection for this man he was getting to know.  “I, I’m,” he let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “It’s truly beautiful. Thank you.”
"The last of the Horcruxes," Ron breathed.
“I’ll help you up a bit,” Harry said quietly, speaking the incantation and waving his wand to slowly lift the head of the bed.
"Maybe we shouldn't be doing this for the first time in such an important battle," Pettigrew said.  He looked up at Harry from underneath his greasy blond hair.
Jordan, with his ability to see and communicate problems quickly, was shouting to get them help. More spells were cast and the speed eased. One more complete turn, and they bumped into the command ship, bow to bow and stern to stern.
“I’m so sorry, sweetheart,” Narcissa said quietly. “So very sorry.” The emotion in her voice was palpable.
Everything is going so well right now. I mean can you imagine the howlers? I don’t particularly fancy going back to being spit on in the street. (I mean I would, for you I would, but it’s a lot to ask of you, so I understand) I don’t want to jeopardise this if public attention is too much. I can keep a secret. I’m very, very good at that. Nobody needs to know about me.
——————-
Harry took in a quiet, shuddering breath and swallowed hard before responding. “Yes, Mrs Malfoy?”
"Are your brother's keeping up?"
Robards sighed. “Michaels was raised by his aunt when his parents were killed. His aunt,” Robards hesitated and every eye in the room was on Robards when he continued, “his aunt was Charity Burbage.”
One day he would belong.
“I can see why,” Draco said. “We have stars like this at home but, well, it’s been a while since there’s been enough peace to enjoy it.” He sighed, caught up in the melancholy of all that he’d lost. “Sorry, I guess I just miss home, my home from before, my life from before.”
Please note this chapter talks about past child abuse in some detail though not in an overly graphic way, in case that is triggering for you.
"Longbottom! Swing us around to their command ship at the back." Voldemort always led from the back. "And..."
So anyway, I was thinking this over. I mean, this deserves retribution, right? Something fun, something devious, some way to thumb our noses at the collective. I was thinking about the options and thought that perhaps you might have some ideas as well. I’d love it to be bold, creative and high profile. My first thought was to go to the Welcome Back Ball together, like as in a date. Think about it: coordinated outfits, public displays of affection, dancing. What do you think? I’m open to other ideas. I can’t imagine a better co-conspirator than you and look forward to your response.
Draco was holding Harry's coat out to him. “Come on. I said I'd drop you off at St Mungo's.”
Halfway back, he realized that leaving any evidence of his indulgence behind would cause suspicion if Voldemort or anyone else actively used the secret passages. He flipped back around, struggling to breathe as he raced back.
“Draco?”
Harry was listening, but never took his eyes off Draco. He felt the trembling increase, saw the colour drain from the pale face and knew the minute Draco was in trouble. He jumped up, pulling Draco to his feet and down the hall into the loo just in time for Draco to throw up. Closing the door behind them, Harry grabbed a wet flannel and a glass of water, then knelt by his friend, his hand spread across the middle of his back. When Draco finally stopped heaving, Harry flushed and used the flannel to gently wash Draco’s face, then handed him the glass of water.
“Yes, Mr Potter, sir. Winky will be starting that tomorrow morning.”
"Fire as your guns bear! An extra portion of the spoils to every gun crew that lands a hit!" Then came the echoing command of "Fire! Fire! Fire!" as one cannon after another got a clear shot at the approaching enemy.
“Yes, they did. It might come back now and then, but it’ll pass in time.”
...earlier
When the clone closed his eyes, he could see it. The great Harry Potter in his dashing pirate clothes, riding into the city in triumphant splendour.
Yes, I’ve met you and
Harry melted into the embrace, dropping his glasses onto the table and eyes filling with unshed tears. “I just...I just wanted to be left alone, to try and deal with all this shit. Why does my life hate me so much? Dammit!”
Another voice floated to him from a great distance.  “Harry.”  It was a woman’s voice, familiar even though he knew he had never heard it before.  “So brave, Harry.” The voice was warm with approval.
Cedric nodded. The two magical powerhouses linked arms with each other and then with the others. Brother in arms, men and women, all of them stood side by side. They moved forward one step at a time, pushing back the shield glowing with heat, still fighting to catch the spells that got through.
"Yup. He's given up trying to talk him out of it. He and Remus are heading back to their own ship."
“Next time, then.”
Technically captained by Percy Weasley, ‘The Burrow’ was the craziest ship to ever float. It appeared to have started out life as a massive carrack, an old style vessel with a distinct, highbrow profile which had been originally designed with more regard to cargo space than maneuverability.
Harry took another deep, shaky breath and nodded. “Tell Kingsley I’ll do it, but I expect him to bring them here personally. I want him to look me in the face. And,” he said as he looked at both of them, “make sure they all understand that this is on my terms, my rules. Otherwise, they can bugger right off.”
“Overreact???” Draco huffed.
“Like us,” Scorpius offered helpfully.
“He’s so excited that he just couldn't keep his voice down,” Molly said as Harry reached them.
Harry smiled at Hermione as she handed him a steaming mug of milky Earl Grey.
“How, Harry?? How?? Wizards can’t have babies without a lot of effort and help and that’s really only in theory. We asked about it, remember?”
They were met with resistance the moment their feet hit wood. Spells flew past in streaks of color and heat. No need to call for shields up. Anyone who didn’t know to have shields at the ready when they boarded would not last long.
“The Aurors are very good at their job, and your father’s testimony is critical to their cases. They take protecting you very seriously.” Harry stepped in front of him and held him loosely by his biceps, looking directly into his stormy grey eyes. “Please, come over here and have tea with me?”
Harry, I wonder every day what it would it would be like to taste your mouth, what it would be like to be yours, for you to be mine.
"It, mother. It's not a he. It's an it." Draco insisted.
It was Luna who spotted it. She pointed up and Harry’s gaze immediately went to the ceiling. “Cedric! The Hatch! Going up to the upper deck!”
“Haha,” Harry said as they made their way to the stairs. “I did mean to sleep but hey, if you're offering...”
Hello friends! Quick note. This chapter contains a brief trigger warning for past suicidal ideation. But it is all ok in the end ;)
Harry sighed inwardly, but he pasted on a smile and gave Narcissa a nod. “The second floor hasn’t really been touched at all, and the third floor is where I had Kreacher put all of the odd things that I moved from the two bottom floors. I thought perhaps that you and your husband could go through that area both for any dark objects that need to be removed and also anything you might want. I know this house was in your family for generations. You may have any heirlooms that you want from here.”
“I’ve no doubt you have regrets,” Harry said, his anger almost a living thing, “given that you all abandoned him, let him go to prison unfairly and then he was killed by your batshit crazy sister. He was your family, for fucks sake,” his voice rose with each word until he spat out the last bit loudly as he stood and looked her in the face. “Draco was trying to save you, his mother. I get that, I can forgive that,” he said, his voice full of emotion. “What’s your excuse, Lucius’ excuse? You are adults. All of you, adults waging a war on the backs of children, and for what? Fucking prejudices? Superiority, blood purity, like you’re better? Well, we might have been children and we might be what you all considered lesser, but you’d be wrong. We defeated pure evil while your lot followed it, believed in it. How dare you? How dare any of you declare that you have an ounce of superiority over anyone?” Harry’s fists were clenched at his sides and his entire body trembled. Tears spilled from his eyes unchecked as though his heart couldn’t hold any more.
“Here’s to nappy changing,” Draco said seriously as he lifted his teacup and clinked it with Harry’s before collapsing into giggles. Their laughter rang throughout the house.
“Nope,” Harry said grinning. “You didn’t forget anything, though this is a special meal for a special day. You just need to enjoy it and guess the theme of the meal.”
Over his shoulder, Narcissa Malfoy turned back and gave him one last look. Then the door closed between them.
Sailing home, Voldemort’s ghost stood looking out into the darkness.  Harry’s body was safely stored in the hold he had fought so hard to escape.  Voldemort had felt the deep pain in his soul at the destruction of the Horcrux.  Despite this loss, it was a victory for Voldemort and his forces and his men were celebrating.  Letters had already been dispatched by the fastest owls to all corners of the Wizarding World.
You, Harry Potter, are a blight to the British Magical Education System.
“Come on, this is the best seat.” Harry made his way to a lounger in the centre of the garden and turned, clearly waiting for Draco. His mouth curved into a soft smile, and Draco’s heart pounded just a bit harder. Giving himself a mental shake, Draco made his way over and following Harry’s lead, laid down. The lounger wasn’t exactly built for two grown men, and Draco could feel the warmth of Harry’s arm next to his own, close enough to almost touch, and he could smell the lemons from his shampoo as they shared the small space. Feeling Harry’s gaze on him, Draco turned his head and looked into those intense green eyes. Time seemed to stand still, his heart beating frantically, captured in that gaze.
“I’ll be in soon, Darby and thanks for the coffee,” Harry replied, sitting up and reaching for the energy-giving drink.
Harry was up in a flash, kneeling by Draco, his hand on a stiff shoulder. “Draco? Are you alright?” Horror-filled eyes looked at Harry and quickly looked away as Narcissa’s arm went around her son’s shoulders. Harry looked at her, his confusion obviously clear on his face.
“Of course, Mr Harry Potter, sir,” and she was gone.
“Happy birthday, Harry,” Andi said with a smile and a kiss on the cheek when Harry was back on his feet.
“Trust me. Follow me.”
“It’s certainly not common,” Dr. Smithers responded. “In fact, it’s never happened this easily for any of my patients before, but it’s certainly happening now. Congratulations gentlemen.”
Of course, I liked dressing you up. Who wouldn’t? It’s like you don’t know you’re bloody gorgeous and fit as hell!  I’ve always been good at fashion and clothing. Father taught me that the clothes make the wizard. I don’t think he expected me to put my skills to use as often as I do. I’m certain he didn’t think I’d be helping Harry Potter find suitable trousers. Or that I’d make him change trousers multiple times so that I could stare at his plush arse and blame it on a fitting.
Shaking his head, Harry responded: “There’s no need. I’ll gladly take the help getting there but I can sit in the room and wait just fine and if I need help after, I’ll ask Hermione. I’ll be alright. I know the funding deadlines are coming up fast and these meetings are important.”
For long moments, he just sat there, silent tears tracking down his cheeks, his hands holding tight to Hermione’s arms. Finally, he took in a big, shuddering breath and eased away from her. A warm, wet flannel appeared in front of his face and he gave Ron a watery, appreciative half smile and washed his face as they took their seats again.
“Harry,” Hermione said quietly, her hand gently resting against his cheek and turning his face to look into her kind, brown eyes. “Of course you’ve done enough. Kingsley knows that. This isn’t about him. It’s...well, it’s Narcissa Malfoy. She’s...,” sighing, she continued, “she’s calling in a life debt for this. She’s scared, Harry, they all are. You can say no, you don’t have to agree just because she’s calling it in.”
“Yeah, and George is struggling with the shop, even with the hired help,” Ron said with a sigh. “I think having me there to work and share the flat is a comfort thing that, to be honest, we both need.”
“I know. I’m concerned, too, but let’s not jump to conclusions.” Harry squeezed Draco's hand in reassurance.
“We’re going up on the roof?” Draco asked. “It won’t help, Harry. It’s too quiet.”
Harry stood alone.  The light from the bright spring day spilled down over his head and shoulders.  He stood still and calm, glowing in the dark hold, facing a legion of Marines, a traitor and an enemy that had killed his parents, enslaved his world and now called for his blood.
Harry looked up at Dr. Smithers. “When can we go home?”
Draco rolled up his shirt sleeves and pointed his wand at the first head and made a complicated wand movement. There was a soft pop, and a puff of smoke, and Draco redid the diagnostics. Seemingly confident now, he moved forward and removed the first head, handing it to Harry.
Draco Malfoy was the first to refer to him as an 'it' rather than a person. The first time the clone blinked open his eyes, he saw Draco's face. At the time, the clone hadn't realized the pale pointy visage perfectly reflected his own. His first memory was staring at the original of his features screwed up in a look of disgust.
Harry watched as Draco conjured the dishes expertly into the kitchen sink and cast some cleaning spells, putting everything to right before they would leave their cottage for the day. Their cottage… he loved this peaceful cottage, the homey touches that came from friends and family. He loved the sound and smell of the ocean pouring in through the open windows. Sometimes Harry still had difficulty believing that this was his life now, Draco running their foundation and him a writer of all things. Harry was so proud of Draco, how he’d faced down those who would judge him and worked hard to prove them all wrong. He was well respected and it was Draco who’d convinced Harry that if the idiot press was determined to have his life story published, it might as well be accurate. That book had been a best seller and now he was a celebrated author. The surrealness of his life never failed to surprise him.
The day after, there was not a book in the lab more tempting than the mystery of the shelves. The trick turned out to be a combination of standing on a specific section of the floor and tapping a pattern on the back of the case, something he'd read about weeks ago. Trying it on a whim, he fell backwards in surprise when the wood swung open on silent hinges.
Well, this is it the end - and the beginning, at least for Harry and Draco.  Thanks for reading along with our little story.
“No,” Ron whispered.
that’s why you have such difficulty maintaining order in your classroom.
His eyes scanned the room, then closed as he apparently went through the evening in his mind.
“That’s an interesting idea and I admit,” Draco said, nodding, “it would explain a lot about you.”
“What’s not possible?” Harry asked, his face as straight as he could manage.
It took a while for the lab to return to normal operations. The technicians cleaned and straightened the room. Conversations were hushed and everyone moved as though expecting their leader to explode back in and tear into them all. The clone stood still, keeping out of the way and staring at the place where Voldemort disappeared with a contemplative expression.
Draco nodded, but started slightly when the door opened and closed.
Well son, you certainly made a splash today. The story is mostly rubbish as expected, but the photos show you looking happier than I've ever seen you, so if young Malfoy is the reason for that, then we'll make the effort to see him apart from his father. If you love him, then he's worth the effort. You know we consider you one of our sons and we love you. Be happy, Harry. You deserve it.
I was stunned when I heard you were coaching the Ravenclaws; impressed though.  I’ve no doubt you’re great at it - you were a challenging opponent
Draco shook his head. “Much as I love you, I need a shower and sleep. It’s been a tough day.”
“That’s a muggle barbecue,” Harry said, walking over and lifting the lid. Draco followed and looked at the strange contraption over Harry’s shoulder. “You light a fire in it and cook food. I’ll make you something soon, if you like.”
That had not been the first time the ghost made the odd choice to fly into that wall. It was not along the outside where the sun streamed in nor by the door. The door always stayed locked and only opened either from inside or out with a key.
A sharp look from Narcissa, and his mouth closed without another word. Turning back to Harry, Narcissa walked up to him and gave him a slight incline of her head. “Mr Potter, my family and I are grateful that you agreed to take us in. I know this is quite the imposition.”
“Well,” Harry said with a shrug. “It seems I can and it’s no theory; it’s a wonderful reality, despite Hermione’s inability to explain it. I saw the sonogram.”
Draco smiled back and Harry kissed him tenderly. “C’mon, Papa. Let’s go home and tell our son just what’s coming.”
"He looks just like you," she said, staring at the clone in that wonderful way.
anything other than his wand?"
“Cookies and Unca Georges?” Scorpius’ voice was timid but interested, and when Molly held out her hands, Scorpius turned and put his hands on Harry’s cheeks. “You promise I can see Papa t’morrow?”
The Narrows were a broad strip of water bracketed on each side by islands, sand bars and rocky shores. The tide, the rhythm of a seamen's life, was a malicious minx. It concealed these dangers with an innocence that dropped to a bloody grin when it was too late to do anything but drown.
"I am ready!" Pettigrew protested and then withered under Harry's hard stare. "Almost ready. I'll just go..." he trailed off as he scurried away.
"On the contrary," Harry corrected. "This is exactly when we should be trying it."
Harry sighed, his head resting on the cool porcelain of the bowl, too tired to even get up. The smell in the bathroom threatened to turn his stomach again and he struggled with the nasty taste in his mouth. A gentle hand touched his shoulder, lifted his head and placed a cup to his lips.
“No,” Kingsley replied, his characteristically booming voice quiet, “but we will find them. In the meantime, don’t let anyone but us in and question us to be sure it’s not polyjuice.”
“Happy?”
It was a nasty combo and one that always left Harry’s combat spell count well above anyone else, each downed sailor counting as one.  It would be interesting to know whether or not the head start the twins had would be enough to keep up with the sheer number of spells Harry was capable of casting during the fight.
"His choice."
The hatch was locked tight. A thick wooden beam had been wedged into the metal loops on each of the two doors, bolting them together.
“No, you aren’t,” Harry said bitterly. “My mother and father died at the hands of the maniac who you two supported, and there’s no bringing them back. I’m glad you all survived, and I appreciate Lucius testifying to put the Death Eaters away, but when this is over, you all will go home together as a family and I’ll…” Harry’s voice broke and he clamped his lips together, determined not to break down in front of the Malfoy matriarch.
“She doesn’t. She said there’s a story in one of her medical books about it supposedly happening in the late 1600s, but no one is positive if it did or not.”
“Next time,” Draco grinned and bit into a tea cake.
Harry stayed where he was, watching his friends and family, gathered to celebrate his 23rd birthday and he smiled. His mind drifted back over his life, the pain of his childhood, the war, the first steps of healing, found family and passionate love. Along the way, he discovered some truths about life. Life wasn’t something you knew how to do, ever. It was, well, it was a bit like a dance – weaving in and out of people and events and movements. Sometimes you led, sometimes you followed, sometimes you stumbled over your own feet, but you kept moving. You kept pace with the others, and with enough practice, you got it mostly right. The hardest thing about dancing was the most critical: you had to get on the floor and start. You could dance on your own, though it was often much less aesthetically pleasing. If you were lucky and found a good partner, it was far easier.
Cedric nodded. The handsome man, tall and well-built, was the only pirate on the regular boarding team without scars decorating his skin. Even Harry had collected more scars than the iconic lightning bolt. But Cedric, despite years of fighting at Harry's side, had the smooth skin of someone who led a much easier life.
“Are both fine,” he reassured him, “and beautiful. Oh love, they are truly beautiful.”
When they were finally told to proceed to the examination room and wait for their doctor, Harry helped Draco lie down on the examination table.
Only one person pierced that fog and now he had a name.
Draco flew in an elegant swoop up to the roof and was startled by the well appointed roof garden that suddenly came into view. An abundance of plants and ornamental trees created a beautiful green oasis in the middle of London. Strings of fairy lights lined the edges of the space and sparkled in the trees. A small shed and a dining set completed the cosy retreat.
“Are you alright?” she asked quietly.
Narcissa returned the smile and squeezed his hand. “You’re welcome, Harry. Anytime, truly.”
"It's missing." The blurry form of the tech appeared to be looking around.
“Yes, they are, like their papa.” Harry brushed his lips across Draco’s forehead and ran his fingers through the silky blond hair.
“Buns,” he whispered, “as in more than one?”
“So, does all this mean that you aren’t in danger any longer?” Harry asked the Malfoys.
You kissed me.
A short while later, they were back in their quiet kitchen, nursing tea.
“Yes?” he said, pausing on the steps.
“Why? I mean, why me?” Harry asked. “Was it just the whole ‘I’m a hero even though I’ve no clue why or any memory of it’?”
The kitchen became a regular stop with the large meals tapering off to quick snacks in passing as another discovery overshadowed the food. He found the library. The first time he walked in and saw the floor to ceiling bookshelves going on row after row, it was almost too much to be believed. The next day when he made his way back and all the knowledge was still there, moisture gathered in the clone's eyes.
“I think I owe your mum my thanks,” Harry said. “She is pretty amazing. I honestly didn’t even realise just how messed up I was until she helped me open up. I– I was so stunned when she came and started to talk to me but I’m really grateful.” Harry's voice broke a little and as he took a shuddering breath, Draco slipped his hand into Harry's and held it tight, resolutely looking at the stars. After a brief moment, Harry continued as if nothing had happened. “It’s, it’s been hard growing up without parents. Before, I was so busy just surviving to think too much about it but when things got quiet, well…” He fell silent.
One servant talked about Potter constantly. Lucretia Prewett Black, a cousin of some sort to the Weasley's, openly supported Harry Potter. She was also related through marriage to Sirius Black, Potter's Godfather ... or uncle ... or whatever.
The broom brigade appeared unexpectedly in the air around them.
When his parents stood to go, Draco stayed seated and shook his head when his mother asked him if he wanted to go upstairs and rest. Harry stood and put some biscuits on a small plate and took a seat beside Draco on the couch before offering him one. Draco looked surprised but took a biscuit and gave Harry a weak smile. The four teenagers settled into relaxed conversation.
“Not so much hungry as cold,” Harry explained. “We were just going to have some hot chocolate.”
Fuck, Draco, I was drinking tea when I read about Binn’s army and nearly choked.  That’s hilarious and I wouldn’t be surprised if he did have some kind of agenda. It’s not like the meetings aren’t already tough to sit through as it is - not to mention how much important stuff we could be doing with that time.  Things like
The cloning project was something else altogether. The destruction of the Horcruxes was almost as big of a problem for the ghost as his disembodied state. In theory, if Voldemort created versions of himself, those clones would be best equipped to defend the pieces of his soul they carried.
I’m not at all surprised that you maintain order in your classes
“I, I didn’t know,” Draco said as he took down head number two and handed it to Harry. “I only knew that you freed him from my father’s service, and that he helped you escape, of course. I’m truly sorry that he died. I quite liked him. He helped raise me.”
“Give me a minute,” Harry said and lifted up just a few feet, then waved his wand in a complex pattern to his right and then his left. Touching back down, he sleeved his wand and smiled. “You up for a race?”
"... with no body, he dies."
The clone stood in a quiet corner of the lab, another naked and forgotten body part, discarded when not actively under observation.
“I can’t imagine growing up without my mum,” Draco admitted, his heart breaking a little for the man who’d never known his own mother at all. “I’m really sorry, Harry. That bastard took so much from us all. I know I’m luckier than most.”
They moved upstairs and a quick wand motion had a roaring fire going. They sat side by side on the comfortable overstuffed sofa, and Draco sighed contentedly as the warmth spread over him. Moments later, Winky delivered lovely mugs of hot chocolate with marshmallows and left a tray with biscuits and small tea cakes for them to share.
A raised eyebrow was Dr. Smithers only response.
Hermione sat her teacup down and opened her arms, and Harry stood and melted into the embrace. He buried his face in her strawberry scented curls and fought the desire to just break down. He managed, just, then Ron was there, his strong arms giving Harry a different kind of anchor borne of long years and numerous challenges.
The fight dissolved into a clash of weapons as well as wands almost immediately.  That was where Harry’s team excelled. All of the regular boarding party were not only accomplished magical duelists, they each could hold their own with muggle weapons as well. This was a gift his mother had given the, insisting on dual competency back when the resistance was a single ship under his fathers command.
“Actually, there’s some sparkling grape juice in the fridge. That’s what I’d like. You can have whatever you like.”
Harry pulled his arm bracers out, strapping them on as he joined the others. While magical shields stopped most spells, iron would stop anything, even the famous Killing Curse, the Avada Kedavra.
“No, but you’ve certainly dodged that question expertly all night. Now, seriously, what is going on?”
“A race?” Draco asked incredulously. “Here?”
All of the wind went out of Harry in one big swoosh, and his face paled, and his body visibly deflated as he understood the depth of her request. In light of her heroics in the forest, to say no would be an insult to her and a disgrace to himself. His eyes shuttered as a groan escaped his pursed lips.
Hermione stood quickly and draped herself around Harry from the back, whispering softly in his ear. “It’ll be OK Harry. Whatever you decide, we’ll help you all we can.”
Draco,
It was the skull and crossbones, a pirates flag, and this the most famous of them all. A tricorn captain hat sat at a rakish angle on the skull and behind, a lightning bolt, cutting the black in bold jagged lines. This was the mark of the great Phoenix of the Sea, captained by the unstoppable Harry Potter.
The advisors, scholars and wizards privileged enough to be allowed into this secret lab were used to the ghost's tantrums. How could they not be? They were a routine part of life. The dreaded 'He' who remained nameless until that moment, was a regular disruptor.
"Stupid way to sort the loot," the small man muttered. "...should be based on rank or seniority like a proper military."
After dinner, Harry bathed Scorpius while Draco rested, then the pajama-clad toddler snuggled between his papa and his daddy for their story. Harry looked over Scorpius' head and locked eyes with his husband and nodded.
PS: I'm really interested in learning the rainbow farts trick. Payback is fun.
“Rinse and spit,” the calm voice directed and Harry did, never opening his eyes. Then a cool cloth began to move over his flushed face. “Easy there, love,” Draco’s soft voice murmured as he dropped to his knees next to Harry. Harry allowed himself to be pulled back into the strong chest and gave into the comfort of cool flannel and kind hands. His head flopped back onto Draco’s shoulder and he gave a shuddering sigh as the last of the nausea passed for the moment.
A final look at the puzzle waiting to be solved, a deep breath to prepare and then the clone allowed himself to be drawn off.
When the rest of dinner had been artfully arranged on the table, Harry sat down, watching as Draco took in the dining-room, turning more than once to look at Harry as he did. “Balloons? Muggle candy… Sour Patch Kids?? I love Sour Patch Kids.”
Finally, Harry blinked and cleared his throat, breaking the moment. He turned his face back toward the sky and pointed while Draco watched him a moment longer as Harry waved his hand and all of the lanterns went out.
It’s Harry and Draco’s kitchen table the next morning.
“Now that’s a sight to come home to,” the wicked voice said from the doorway, “delicious smells and that fabulous arse in tight trousers on display for me. I know what’s for dessert, what’s for dinner?”
“Promise you’ll call if you need me.” Draco said.
Harry studied her for a moment, taking in the dark circles under her eyes and the tense purse of her mouth and saw past the elegance and breeding to the pure fear underneath. She was a wife and mother and terrified; Harry understood terrified. He took a deep breath and gave her a tiny half-smile. “I am honoring my life debt to you. My home is your home for as long as it's needed. Let me show you to your rooms and then we’ll have dinner and discuss the household rules.” Before leaving, Harry turned to the others. “Kingsley, if you’ll wait, I’d like to speak with you before you go.”
Harry turned to Draco who nodded once and made his way upstairs.
He heard Draco sigh. “I'm sorry, mother. It's alright. I still have my family intact and that's worth everything else.”
“I know it wouldn’t ever replace your mum or even Mrs Weasley, but my mum seems to have grown quite fond of you,” Draco said, turning to look at Harry. “I’m pretty sure she’d be happy to be there for you, should you want that.”
“Are you being hungry?” she asked.
After a thorough examination and the typical battery of testing were complete, they waited nervously for the results. A short time later, the door to the exam room opened and their Obstetrician Dr. Smithers entered.
“Draco,” Harry said in that tone; the one that meant he was serious, “will you walk or shall I carry you?”
“Are you sure we can’t leave him?” Cedric asked. Harry’s glare was answer enough. “Fine. Do you want the hold or the officers quarters?”
Ron nods. “Someone tried to kill them last night. Kingsley figures that the only way anyone got to them was through someone with access and information so he’s a bit lost in who to trust.”
“I’m glad,” Draco said quietly, his gaze still fixed on the night sky. He licked his lips, his heart pounding as he continued. “I think I always just wanted your attention if I’m honest.”
“Of course,” Harry said with a nod.
“My home is wherever you are,” Harry said, turning to face him. He was about to say something else, but laughed instead when he heard a distinct series of pops behind them. “Sounds like more of the family’s arriving. Let’s greet them, shall we?”
Harry had no idea what had happened to cause Draco to have such a reaction, but it tore at his heart and without stopping to really think about it, he sat down on the floor in front of Draco and wrapped his larger hands around Draco’s slender, trembling ones. His thumbs brushed gently over Draco’s knuckles. He noticed Ron's eyes widening at that, and Hermione tilted her head in a question, but he looked them both in the eyes and gave a little nod to let them know that he knew what he was doing. Ron nodded back and Hermione smiled.  “Please continue, Head Auror.” As he spoke, he felt Draco’s fingers tighten around his.
“Yes, it is, and of course you can call us anytime. I’m sorry we can’t stay here with you, Harry, but I have two weeks to prepare before I report for orientation,” Hermione said.
The battle to retrieve Harry’s body lasted until sunset.  The pirates fled the area with great reluctance, driven off by the marines and the one ship they could not manage to sink.  Fred and George had indeed broken Harry’s combat spell record, having battled all day to retrieve the remains of the man they had all followed.  No one mentioned it.  It felt wrong, just one more way they had lost him.
Blaise adjusted the satchel’s strap over his shoulder. “Let’s get this over with.”
“Just read the Daily Prophet like your mother, in that case, why don’t you?” Harry snapped them out of their conversation. “That’ll tell you all you need to know.”
"Good boy. Keep it that way."
His pulse soared, and as their eyes lingered, uncertainty began to creep up on him. What if it was about to attack again? The wound it had given him last time was deep, but Madame Pomfrey was able to heal it with some Dittany before it could mark him forever. They didn’t seem to have any in this house, and if not quick enough, another wound would definitely scar. If his mother saw a scar on his skin…
Harry laid back down, settling again with his arms crossed underneath his head, “Haven’t quite thought that far yet, but I’ll think of something.”
Draco swallowed heavily. "I know."
." He articulated. Draco set his hand back down his lap disbelievingly but gestured for the boy to go on.
"Lay off him, Pans. He won't say anything." Blaise said, talking across him to Pansy as if he weren't there.
"It won't." Was the only thing he could say, shutting his eyes tightly. "I have you, and Ron, and now Draco too."
"It bloody sounds like it to me. Admit it, Draco. You did this to be his
His face stung as the wind collided with the tears rolling down his face, and he opened his blurry eyes to the leaves above swaying gently. He wondered why he knew what this feeling was, even though he'd never felt it before until he remembered that night of the Yule Ball, when he'd stood next to Harry and felt the first bit of peace inside his aching chest in forever.
"It shows that Dumbledore does have some sort of clearance level for what information goes to whom." Remus said thoughtfully.
"Not me?" Harry said with a wry smile.
Draco looked over at Harry and the smile that had been on his face faded. The boy was looking at him quizzically, and Draco was starting to feel self-conscious. In the background, he could hear Ronald whining pathetically to Granger about something.
"Oh for fuck's-" Draco set down his teacup hard on the table. "No, Ginevra. There is no House Elf blood in our line.
"So I stopped watching Malfoy, and I started watching you, Harry." Hermione said, "Of course, you had the Tournament so I couldn't fault you for being a little distracted and…odd at times, but something about you and Malfoy seemed off even back when you told us about the Ball. I could tell then that you weren't saying something, but I decided to let it go thinking it didn't matter since it was...well, Malfoy."
“Just — just toast, thanks,”
Ron reached out and Harry met him half way, clutching onto his friends sleeves frantically, “My scar, Ron. She touched me and it began to hurt-”
“Just get on with it.” Draco snapped, his impatience wearing thinner and thinner as his alarm increased.
you go against the Dark Lord? Against the very being of your existence?"
Draco wondered if Harry had dreams about that night like he himself often had. They didn't happen much, and for once Draco was glad for the rigorous activity he did during the day that made him too tired to even dream at night.
"How long?" Draco asked inquisitively.
Draco felt himself flush and heard some murmurings from behind him in the hall. Just then, he felt a hand on his arm - Pansy's - leading him out the door, Blaise flanking them. Nodding casually to Potter as the boy nodded back, the three walked out the Hall straight to the outside where they settled under a tree in the Courtyard, away from anyone else there.
"You don't know what it's been like, Blaise. Thing are happening back at the Manor. With my father. I could feel it since last summer, like something's about to happen."
“And these lower levels, what on earth is the difference?”
"Merlin." Draco muttered. "Should have asked if you wanted any tea with your sugar instead."
"Draco." A hand placed itself on his shoulders, and he stiffened at the touch. He couldn't bring himself to move away even if he wanted to.
"Enough!" Moody barked. "Mad, am I? We'll see! We'll see who's mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, with me at his side! He is back, Harry Potter, you did not conquer him — and now — I conquer you!"
At a rumble from his stomach, Blaise laughed and called out to Draco as he left for the hall while Draco went to wash up, "Be down soon. Pansy wants to talk!"
"Good for you lot."
"Maybe they don't want anyone knowing what Draco knows." Harry said quietly.
Draco looked at Potter weirdly for a moment, "That was oddly…eloquent. What's wrong with you? Where is Harry Potter and what have you done with him."
He was now seriously considering it.
"I don't touch that rag unless it's to wipe my arse, Pansy."
"Oh." Draco said eloquently, realisation dawning on him with horror.
"Oh." Harry looked down at their hands as if noticing them for the first time, which he'd probably had. "Why are you holding my hand?"
“You think it’s something for Voldemort?” Harry asked him. “Those files, I mean. What’s in them”
"Nice one, Harry." Seamus said with a grin, "Makes you look scary."
"So he has to work with Percy, then?"
Unfortunately, Blaise was getting on behind him and he couldn't turn back to look. He grit his teeth, walking further in to the hall of the train. He spotted one of the windows that would allow him to see outside, but it was obstructed by a haggle of First-Years.
"Oh!" Hermione gasped, startling the two boys. "What was this about a court hearing I heard about from Molly?"
Dumbledore, for one of the first times Draco had ever seen, looked at a loss at how to phrase his words.  “I fear that Mr Potter may be… susceptible to more than we currently know because of what happened that night.”
" A blue shield erupted around him, and the stunning spell bounced off harmlessly. His eyes were still trained on his father's torso, and as soon as his Protego was released he saw another spell coming his way.
"So why do you think I would?" Harry asked, confused because he couldn't figure out how Ron was okay with him and Draco even though he couldn't relate to their friendship.
"I see." Draco said, twisting the cup around in it's place with one hand. "Is it about…"
Draco nodded grimly, "It's a magically binding contract, and if either one breaks it, will result in their death. So, unless I'm stupid enough to kill myself with the slip of a tongue, I'll never be able to say anything without a consequence. The weight of that alone will help me not give in to the temptation of telling anyone. It's the best we can do to keep each other safe. I will vow my loyalty to you, and any betrayal will kill me. Will that work for you?"
Draco sighed as his mother hurriedly ordered the elves to carry his things outside, and he momentarily remembered Granger's weird club. What was it again? Spit? Spew?
A chorus of exasperated groans sounded from the Gryffindor side of the room. Harry flushed, irritation spiking in his gut and begging him to snap back at Snape. Looking at Ron's absolutely crestfallen face, however, Harry reluctantly suppressed the urge. He made his way back to the table after picking up whatever ingredients he had seen Hermione pick up, casting a glance at Malfoy as he passed. The boy was already involved in his potion, stooped over the cauldron and mixing the mercurial contents inside. He caught Harry's eye, and the git bloody
"Yeah." Draco grumbled, eyeing the man suspiciously. There was just something about their Headmaster that Draco found creepy.
, you tosser-"
Harry nodded and Draco continued, "I don't know about Granger and Weasley. When you decide if you want to tell them, let me know. Merlin knows how they'll react, though..." Harry nodded again, feeling useless in the logistics of the whole situation.
"I'm-" Harry started, then his face shifted slightly, changing back within a second. "I'm just fine, if you're so
“I’ll carry it in the second half,” Draco whispered back, coming up to the elevator doors and pressing the button.
Draco had never had much patience for children. They were much too incompetent for anything he found useful in life and there was no telling what they’re young, unpredictable minds could do…
"So what does this mean, Draco?" Blaise said, considerably perked up from before.
Draco was hiding.
Ron stared for a moment, before turning to lay on his back and look up at the ceiling.
"Shut it, wanker. You created a monster that has their wand this time around." Draco said warningly, but Potter just snorted infuriatingly.
Malfoy huffed in amusement, "Hear, hear, Potter."
Not questioning anything in favour of focusing on not fainting, Harry clumsily grabbed his bookbag and ran out the room. He found himself in that dreaded bathroom once again, hyperventilating. He collapsed into a corner and huddled into himself to calm himself down. The pain had mercifully decreased, but his eyes were still watering from the pressure and the phantom throbbing still hadn’t left.
"How long are you here for?" She asked, glancing at the bag behind him.
After freshening himself up in a terrifying bathroom and changing his clothes in to something more warm (It seemed like it was impossible to get rid of the cold in Grimmauld place, similar to the Manor), he made his way quietly downstairs to the kitchen.
Ron tutted, waving a hand away, "Bugger that. You're our trouble." And Hermione smiled slightly, still looking out at one of the windows of the room. Harry smiled, looking down at his hands.
Harry just scowled, knocking Draco’s shoulder with his. “Just show me the letter,” he grumbled.
Harry felt startled by the amount of information Malfoy was just giving him, which proved how invested the boy was in their…partnership.
But Harry wasn't listening. He felt a small uncomfortable niggle of shame in the pit of his stomach.
"You're a Death Eater."
"Yep." Harry said. "Sprain."
He checked his watch, seeing it was only fifteen minutes past five, which meant he still had time. The halls were cold and quiet as he walked through them, many of the students still down at dinner, which he had chosen to forgo in lieu of finishing off some of his work (and look how well that turned out).
"Uh, yeah, actually."
George shushed him. "Don't tell mum." He said a whisper.
Revulsion coiled in Draco's stomach. "Yes, father."
Harry wanted to ask, but Draco just shook his head, as if replying,
Ron smiled, thankfully unbothered by Harry’s forceful cheer. In fact, Ron almost looked as tired as he felt, but he looked content, which made Harry feel so, too.
Harry frowned, “How do you know she’s not one of
thank you thank you all sooo much for staying with me, regardless of when you started this fic. writing this made me fall in love with writing again, which sounds so super corny but i don't know how else to describe it. this must seem so dramatic for a fucking drarry fic but idk man i'm just glad whatever possessed me to write fanfiction a year ago did. it's been a steady constant in my life and helped me develop my writing style and abilities so much more. i just love writing. I've never admitted it before, but here I am. i love it so so much I could do it the rest of my life.
"Do you know?" He asked out of no where. He had no idea why he did, but suddenly felt the need to know.
"He left in a hurry from our meeting - erm, his tardiness may also be my fault, by the way." Draco said apologetically.
"Right. Er. Well, why did you come and tell me all this?"
"You're here. You came back." He whispered roughly.
"I told you." Draco smiled. "Told you. Told you. Told you."
"Alright, Potter. Give me my wand. Fuck this truce." He said, attempting to scoot over to Harry and grab his wand. Harry reflexively grabbed them and moved away, laughing carelessly. He couldn't believe how at ease he felt, especially considering who he was with. They both settled down again, Harry still holding both their wands in one hand.
The volume in the room had decreased as everyone focused on their potions respectively. Harry added some of the remaining ingredients, hoping they didn't blow up the whole Potion.
“Not lie low
“Harry, you were meant to lay
"But…he was in Azkaban for twelve years! That's horrible!" He looked at Harry suspiciously, "You aren't taking the piss, are you?"
"I don't! But I can't let him have the satisfaction of knowing I was too scared to take him at all!"
He clambered through the stand, gaining lots of dirty looks and utters of annoyance that he ignored. He made his way down, not knowing what he was doing or what he was thinking.
of common sense." And with that Blaise stomped out the dormitory, brushing past Nott whom flinched slightly as their shoulders brushed. His eyes followed Blaise out the room then finally found Draco, who was leaning on one elbow and lounging laboriously as he regarded him with a '
Harry scoffed, going to sit next to where Draco was settled. He noticed that the ground had been cleared of all the fallen leaves from the thick Willow tree above them and when he put a hand to the surface, realised there was a small, epidermal barrier that prevented them from actually making contact with the dirt. It was so fractional that it felt as if he were sitting on the ground anyway. Harry said nothing about it, knowing Draco would be too smug about it, clever as he was.
Once inside, he made sure to slam the door loudly behind him again, then begun ripping off his nightgown. He threw on a pair of jeans and jumper before noticing a tapping sound on his window. He turned quickly and pointed his wand at the sound before seeing it was an owl. In it's talons was a rolled letter with a familiar red seal.
"Why not."
Draco turned to Fred. "I have never met a more annoying woman in my life."
"Of all the things, Malfoy?" Hermione exclaimed. "Of all the bloody things?"
"And here I thought you were here for my thrilling conversation." Draco said with a wry smile, eyes scanning his parchment.
"Well you saw it, didn't you? He was decent enough. I do think I'm missing some toes, though."
"Mhm?" The boy said, not quite present and transfixed on the sunrise.
"That's good." Hermione said. She squeezed them together again, arm digging in to Harry's neck far longer than necessary. He looked up at her to the side, and saw her looking back with a strange look in her eyes. "We'll be together in no time." She said lightly, but the look in her eyes had more weight in contrast, her arm crushing him as if he might disappear.
"It's okay. He never really hit me anyway."
"You twirl like a girl, Malfoy." Harry answered.
"You'll see." He said vaguely, and Draco narrowed his eyes.
The spell bounced, and he waited with his wand raised for the next attack, but it never came. He looked quickly to his father's face, whom was staring at him with a cold gaze and his wand still poised to strike. They stared at each other in silence, Draco's heart hammering in anticipation of his father's next move.
"Ha ha." Harry said humourlessly, "But I already knew that."
"What type of punishment do you have in mind, exactly, Malfoy?" Ginevra said cheekily, the attempt to tease him not getting lost on him.
. Hogwarts was the closest thing to a home he had…Surely they wouldn't let him off for underage magic a second time? Wouldn't they also snap his wand? He looked down at it, still in his hand for some reason. He didn't care if the muggles on this street saw. That would be his aunt and Uncle's problem-
Draco whipped his head up. “What?”
. No news. No letters. Not even my friends could tell me a damn thing!"
Malfoy cocked his head to the side at Harry, a bit of heat in his gaze, "How would you know?" He asked accusingly.
"I don't like it either, Ron" Harry said, trying to quell the boy's anger, but it seemed to only make him angrier.
Inexplicably, Draco and Potter had sat next to each other for a good while under the moon that night. Neither of them spoke, but it was a nice sort of silence, punctuated by the small lapping sounds of the Lake. Draco wasn't sure how long they sat there, but soon enough Potter got up, dusting himself off, and walked back to the castle with a muttered "Goodnight, Malfoy." He didn't give Draco any time to respond, instead disappearing in to the darkness.
Then Dumbledore gave his speech, and Harry wanted nothing more than to be anywhere else.
"Like…about himself. He wasn't being someone he wasn't."
"Exactly." Draco said. "So if you tell me what you want, I'm pretty sure I can make them give it to you."
But the man only left the entrance of the maze with a deep swig of his flask.
"Anywhere but here!" Harry said back just as loudly. He managed to half turn around before Uncle Vernon grabbed him by the shoulder.
"So what does this have to do with Dumbledore himself?" Draco asked, face serious and expressing complete attention to the matter at hand.
"Great job, mate!" Harry exclaimed again, staring daggers at Hermione through a smile and gesturing his head violently at Ron. "Three of my friends are prefects! What are the odds!"
“Y - Yeah,” he said sheepishly, facing tinting red just like the day before.
"You can…enlist Dementors?" Harry asked.
Harry just laughed at the blatant lie, but didn't say anything more about the subject. He knew Malfoy liked the spot as much as he did. He wouldn't have been out there studying if he didn't.
With an utter of disgust, Malfoy grabbed Harry by the nape of his neck and shoved him so he was leaning over the bush.
"Are you sure?" She asked after a moment, and Draco threw his hands in to the air with a disgruntled noise. Everyone around the table snickered, and he let his head fall on to his arms, crossed over the table. Hermione looked slightly disapproving at the topic, but said nothing.
"Interesting." His father mumbled, looking at him. He let go of Draco's arm and went back to the window pensively.
, if you will!" Snape barked from the front of the class, spurring Harry in to half-running to his desk. He heard Draco snigger behind him and Harry glared at him as he walked back to his table. As he passed between Snape's line of sight, Draco winked and sauntered out the class so quickly Harry questioned he even saw it happen.
“Why not Granger, then? She’s with him all the time.”
Fred grinned, to which is brother mirrored almost simultaneously.
"One."
“...Dumbledore said....really should get checked….aunt had a breakdown once, too….”
"In second year, your father gave Ginny Weasley a diary with a bit of Voldemort's soul in it." Harry said as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Malfoy flinched when Harry said Voldemort's name, and stared disbelievingly at Harry. Harry would have thought it was funny without context to what they were talking about.
“Yes, ma’am.” Draco said dutifully, smirking slightly just for show and scooting through the row of students into the aisle. He forced himself not to look at Harry or his friends directly, but managed to give a small sneer and muttered, “Hurry up, Potty.”
." Draco said a little too quickly. "Other than that. He just rubs me the wrong way. Ever since that thing with Crouch-" He cut himself off quickly, eyes widening but not looking at Blaise.
"Don't worry about me." Harry reassured, although he did feel a small simmering of dejection inside of him. "Everyone thinks I'm mad. It wouldn't have worked out."
"Uh, like a grey? I think it's supposed to be silver, though."
His father's eyebrows raised, "Do you think so?" And Draco cursed himself. He probably thought Draco thought the Final was the part he didn’t like. His father must have seen the Tournament as a good thing, right?
a-" Draco lowered his voice, "
The dance ended with a swift flurry of notes and a calm segue. Bowing with a hand on his chest, Harry could feel his heart hammering under his palm. He stared at the ground, his chest heaving from the dance and his mind completely blank. Not knowing what to do with his hands when he rose back up, he quickly nodded at Malfoy and turned around as the other boy returned the gesture and did the same. He hesitated for a moment, wondering where he was, then finally spotted Ron and Hermione stood at the side of the floor. In fact, all the other couples were stood off the floor - him and Malfoy were the only ones still there. He swallowed nervously, his mouth suddenly extremely dry.
a letter in front of the entire Great Hall in his life.
Harry glanced up with raised eyebrows from where he was buttering his toast. After a moment of silence, Hermione cleared her throat awkwardly and looked back at Ron.
“Now, once you’ve got it where it needs to be, then you must be completely sure of where it’s been put!” Lancaster explained excitedly.
All at once, came in the entire Weasley clan, and Harry. Sirius and Remus even made an appearance behind them.
“But those are could-ifs and what-ifs,” Hermione argued. “We need him to focus on what’s actually happening-”
"I need tea." He said dully, turning away from the other boy. "
"I know. Can I have it back?" He panted. He didn't even know why he was asking, it was his own wand anyway. It was just something about the look on Potter's face that made him hesitate. Potter fished through his pockets and brought out two wands, giving Draco his one and pocketing the other.
“Then you do it.” Draco snapped irritably. “It makes more sense anyway. If she really asks, then say it was accidental magic from when you threw a tantrum earlier-”
-o-o-
"I know." Draco said just before disappearing around the curtain. "I believe you. I'll be here when you wake up."
Harry sat back, stunned. "Malfoy, I…"
"You're taller than me now." Harry remarked.
"Have they been bothering you all summer?"
Just then his eyes caught Draco, stooped over his cauldron and stirring but looking at Harry questioningly. Harry shrugged slightly, flicking his eyes to Snape quickly then making a show of rolling them. The corners of Draco's mouth twitched but he just nodded and continued with his potion.
“We deserve an explanation, don’t we?” Seamus countered heatedly.
"I hate this Tournament." He said with a wry smile, ignoring that he hiccupped between words slightly. "I didn't want this."
"Well you do." Malfoy said, taking on his usual know-it-all tone that Harry was more familiar with. "It's terribly annoying to look at you because of it, sometimes."
"O.W.L.S are definitely a priority!" Hermione said, putting her hands on her hips. "And if this woman messes them up, I'll just…teach everything myself!"
Harry, with all those thoughts in mind, forced a smile at Umbridge. A wide, bright-eyed one that left no room for even a hint of insecurity. It was easy enough, with all those thoughts in mind, because she was just a normal, fearing woman just like everyone else. Fearing of Voldemort, a man he’d seen more than a few times in his life already.
Draco didn't saw anything for a moment, then patted Harry's knee in a familiar gesture. "It's alright. You're doing the best you can for the moment, and that's good."
"Oh! Right." He'd completely forgotten about the Quidditch pitch being turned in to a maze of grass hedges. He told Draco about it quickly, and the boy listened with a sharp focus Harry still found extremely unsettling.
"Let's stop talking about you dying, then, alright?" Draco yelled. "Let's change the subject. You're insufferable."
His wand had just twitched, he was sure of it. His eyes widened, but he otherwise didn't move. There was no way…
“Dean. Dean Thomas.”
"What did I say about derogatory phrases against women, Blaise." Pansy said warningly.
"At your muggle's house?" Draco gasped.
. You can't seriously tell me you believe in that blood purity bullshit. It's all just shit recycled from your father."
“FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE!” screamed Mrs. Weasley.
"I…Long story." He said, watching as Granger and Mrs. Weasley took turns hugging and talking to Harry in soft murmurs Draco didn't bother to listen in on.
Draco looked down at the letter, reading for a few moments before looking up again. “I’m not sure who it could be from.” he said, “From the way it sounds, though, it’s someone from the Ministry.”
"Right." Blaise said slowly, clearly unconvinced, "Well it can only really be good ole' Barty." He shrugged.
“Twenty more points from Gryffindor.” She said triumphantly, voice almost as quiet as a whisper. “And
They all continued with their respective tasks in silence, until he heard Ron ask Draco, "When do you leave again?"
“Really?” Harry finally looked at him.
Before she could finish, Sirius and Tonks managed to force the curtains closed, and along with them the old woman's screeches died and an echoing silence fell.
Harry kept his head down throughout majority of the meal, eating in short bursts under the watchful eye of Hermione next to him as his friends filled in the silence he was in with their usual banter. He didn't look up at Draco once, despite the habitual urge to.
He saw Draco’s jaw clench as if he were gritting his teeth together. “I said
“Muggleborn?” Blaise’s eyes narrowed, looking around the room searchingly. “When’s the last time we had one of those?”
“I asked Harry to help me with Quidditch last night.” Ron blurted. Harry’s head whipped to look at him quickly. “Just a few pointers after his detention, but I ended up scraping him up a bit.”
"Yes!" Both Harry and Draco yelled. "Just do it." Draco spat.
“The night Voldemort returned,” Dumbledore said, the usual jovial tune in his voice gone in lieu of something gruff and profound. “Harry’s blood was used…” He paused, seeming to think deeply for a moment before asking Draco out of the blue, “Mr Malfoy, what we discuss, may I request stay between us?”
for once."
Harry gaped at himself in the mirror. He never cut his hair like that! The sides were shorter than the top of his head, where his unruly black hair was shorter than before but still messy and unkempt. It didn't look necessarily bad, but he wasn't going to tell Malfoy that.
"Regardless of anything I conclude over the night, Potter, how you steer a broom with two left feet is beyond me." He finally settled on, although the words didn't seem to have their usual heat.
"He almost killed you with the Dementors." She reminded.
-o-o-
Dean was sitting on the arm of Seamus's chair and Harry decided to spectate Seamus's failure since he missed it the last few times. He got up and sidled on to the arm next to Ron, whom barely acknowledged him as he ordered a castle across the board and smashed a bishop in to small ceramic pieces that almost went flying into Harry's eyes. He was instantly thrown back to First Year, but put away the thought immediately.
." Sirius interjected, glancing nervously between the two. "Are we doing this or-"
"Well, it's so good that you're friends with Harry, Ron and Hermione now. I always did think those three were a little unbalanced. You even out the three." She said, causing a horrified look on both Draco and Weasley's faces.
For some reason, the wounds seemed to close up slower than usual, but Harry could barely feel them. Maybe he was getting used to it, or maybe he was still riding on the high from his anger.
"Ow!" Draco hissed, kicking him back before he unfortunately dodged Draco's leg and caused the table to wobble. Harry laughed at him, and Draco shot him a glare that would have made any lesser being cower.
"Cedric Diggory and Harry Potter, because you both tied for first place in points thus far, you have been granted a timed head start!"
It had been easy enough. All he had to do was request a permission of absence from his mother for a school project interview at the Ministry. He took the permission, told Snape he was off to visit his mum for the day, then that string was tied.
The group was all silent for a moment before the woman gasped, "Oh, you! Aren't you a sweet thing! And risking your life for our dear Harry here!" She pulled Draco in to another suffocating hug. "It's quite alright now, dear. I know Ronald's talked about you in the past, but he obviously over reached on your character."
to figuring it out. Merlin knows he probably wasn't. Draco sighed and plopped down between Pansy and Blaise, whom had been arguing about something inconsequential to him as he mulled over Potter and the Task.
“Have a biscuit, you two.”
"I know. Do go on."
After sitting in silence for a while and succumbing to the feeling of just existing, reality caught up with Harry and his eyes flew open.
"Oh, Harry." He said.
"What is it?" He asked, feeling uncomfortable as he looked down at Remus.
He closed his eyes.
“Right,” Draco said pensively. “Can I ask you something bluntly then, Professor?”
"Me?" Draco put a hand to his chest dramatically, "Why, of course. What makes you think otherwise?" He smiled unconvincingly and Harry narrowed his eyes.
"Like
He watched his father get in to the stance as well, then moved his eyes to the same spot on the other man's robes. In the corner of his vision, he saw quick, sharp arc of his father casting a spell, and immediately braced himself.
It's silent in the room except for his heavy breathing. He can't see where his father is, only able to stare at the elaborately painted ceiling of the ballroom where they were now using for Draco's 'lessons'.
Draco stared at her a moment, ignoring the Harry comment and wondering why he was bluffing about apologising when he so desperately wanted to get it off his chest for a while. He blew out a sigh, his shoulder sagging and moved back a bit to sit on the edge of the desk he'd had his bag on.
"Still a prat." He muttered under his breath with amusement.
long time ! I can confidently assure you that i have not and will not be abandoning this fic as I'm under orders to finish it. i can't say the same about late chapters, though. that's part one done too, so naturally fifth year is next up.
