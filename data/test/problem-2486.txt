it could make sense.
They stared at each other darkly, chests heaving.
Harry had no idea how long they stayed there, just kissing and touching each other’s skin and faces and murmuring softly, but after a little while Luna and Ginny appeared.

Harry said "Yeah, sounds good."
... I didn’t mean—"
On the whole, Draco felt the search of the cellar had been worth doing, if only to eliminate it as a possible hiding place for their lost possessions. However, the fact that he'd not been down there for a good four years had bitten him in the arse, rather badly, and he berated himself for forgetting that damn Claustrus enchantment. He really should have remembered. The cottage had previously belonged to his first cousin twice removed, Lucretia Black, who he'd met only the once, and rumour had it she'd been quite the sadistic battleaxe; locking poor uncle Regulus in the attic of Grimmauld and subjecting him to this very curse. The poor bugger hadn't stopped shaking for days after his discovery.
Draco almost leapt a foot in the air, and his trowel left his hand in an arc and landed amongst a thicket of weeds. He hadn’t expected Potter to be home from work so early. Still, Draco wasn’t going to let that stop him. “What does it look like I’m doing? I’m fixing your complete pigsty of a garden, seeing as you refuse to do it yourself.”
And then? Well. Then Draco takes a step towards Harry, and Harry takes a step towards Draco. And Draco’s fingers flutter at Harry’s elbow. And Harry reaches a hand out to push a lock of hair behind Draco’s ear. And then they kiss.
And suddenly, like a lightning bolt, his focus was stolen... by a bloke with neon green hair glowing like a halo around him in the blacklight. He was moving rhythmically in the middle of the crowd,
"Bitter, too, by the sounds of it," Draco quipped.
A Patronus, perhaps. He could ask someone to send a Patronus. He was loathe to go back into the class and admit to them he couldn’t do a full one properly. But what choice did he have? He wavered for a few seconds and then decided to give his Patronus another try. For Harry.
They hadn't gone to St Mungo's the following day, despite there having been no improvement. They'd had to call back to the Nevi-Wesh coven to speak with Magister Raymond Placid, the leader of the group, and follow up on a few small inconsistencies. Despite them having hard evidence implicating Goodsister Joanna, they'd yet to establish a motive. Accounts from various members of the coven varied wildly as to the possible reasons for the killing. Magister Placid was very cooperative, but by the end of the day, they were still none the wiser on what chain of events could have led to Goodsister Joanna brutally murdering her roommate.
Madam Kite dropped Harry's hand and it flopped lifelessly onto the stiff bedsheet. "A neighbour found Mr Potter out cold in his back garden; she'd heard a shout. The Devil’s Snare was wrapped around his legs, and it delivered quite the nasty little poison. It likely pulled him off his feet, and that’s how he banged his head. He’s lucky the tendrils hadn’t wound around his belly, they’d have squeezed so tight that the baby…” She spotted Draco’s expression and trailed off.
People glowed, and everything was dark and at the same time
Harry huffed a laugh. Just what was with every single person being able to read him like an open book? Hermione's words floated through his head—
"Oh, for fuck's sake," Harry spat. He wrenched the lid off the kettle and began filling it wandlessly with an Aguamenti.
"One thing's for certain, I'm one hundred percent not discussing sexual matters with
“It is nice," Draco agreed, and then he shivered and laughed. "
Salazar, Potter was right. Draco didn’t know why he felt incapable of being pleasant. He really should try for the sake of the baby. He took a calming breath.
—a faraway thought. But every inch of him is reeling and undulating, and when lucidity returns, Potter's fucking into him with long, steady strokes that push his face into the mattress, and Draco’s so fucking full, and it's all-consuming and perfect.
He checks the address written in kohl on the back of the blue Rizla packet and announces it clearly as he tosses the powder into the fire.
. “I forgive you. I- Well, you helped me. You…” He shook his head. “I absolutely am
Harry's breathing gradually evened out under Draco's firm instruction and even firmer hand. As his eyes slowly cleared, the room began to brighten. The cellar suddenly seemed a lot less cramped, the dark shadows having been shooed away, and the piles of furniture and boxes were now sitting innocuously and were no longer the forbidding and confusing labyrinth they had seemed moments ago.
could I forget?" Draco rolled his eyes and took a swig from his beer bottle.
"As the much better half, Potter, I can say it" she warned him, "but nevertheless, you are right."
Say what you like about the reliability and veracity of the rest of the magazine's articles, but a review by
Draco knows it won't bring Vinny back, but the Fyre still blazes beneath his skin. There, the embers will never die. There, no one dies.
Pansy’s smile dropped off of her face so quickly that Draco was left wondering whether it was ever there. The guilty expression that took its place made it clear Draco would not like what she had to say.
with his soft sugar-and-mint lips.
Draco inhales from the vial again, another wave of almost painfully intense euphoria flooding his body and brain.
“I don’t follow.”
Granger stopped short as the matron stepped in front of her. "I’m sorry. Visiting hours are between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m." Draco turned his head to hide his amusement.
"Don't worry. Harry told us he's started seeing you." Draco breathed out in relief. Granger picked at the sheet on the bed, then smoothed it out. "I have to confess I was rather… concerned about it. Well, I thought he could do a lot better than the person who'd tormented him for seven straight years."
Draco smiles and reads over the spell details once more.
“Hi granny and granda in the ground,” said Lily, waving her hand at the grave. “I love you, and I love Daddy and Papa, and I love Ted and Jamie and the baby in papa’s tummy, and I love Bob.” The boys laughed. Bob was her bendy plastic Bowtruckle.
when Potter slips his hand under the table at their Monday morning team meeting, slides it across Draco's upper thigh and grips his hand tightly, Draco's not shocked in the least. Well, that's not strictly true; a zap of electricity bites into his palm, causing him to jerk in his seat, which earns him a filthy glare from Robards.
Luckily, after the break there was no hideous role play or other exercise where they needed to pair up, so Draco was free to concentrate on the blessedly
Well, what in the name of Merlin's marvellous—?
it's been that long?" He whistled. "And before that you had a dry spell for a good eight months. That Benoît chap, wasn't it, with the little moustache?"
Potter looked devastated. Understandably so. Draco knew how horrific it was to see someone you loved struck down—he thought back to the vengeance the remaining Death Eaters had exacted on his mother; she was never the same after the repeated Cruciatus curses. And he knew damn well that Potter had seen his share of pain and loss too. Draco walked closer and took his wand out.
Thankfully Hermione came through for Harry, quite clearly still at the top of her researching game, arriving at Grimmauld with a stack of travel brochures and a complex chart she'd drawn up comparing destinations, hotels, proximity to the beach, travel expenses and even WokeWix ratings (a godawful social media platform for 'digitised post-war wixes'). Harry enjoyed looking at the pictures of sandy beaches and palm trees, but he switched off when Hermione tried to explain her six sigma Pareto diagram.
“You are everything your father isn’t, Draco. Caring, patient… most of the time. Ow! I’ve just had an injury, you git. You can’t pinch a convalescing patient. As I was saying, you’re patient, and smart, and have a cracking sense of humour. And you’re very fucking fit.”
Draco Malfoy made his escape from the crotchety desk clerk as soon as he practicably could. As annoyed with Potter as he was, Draco was in no mood to join in with the woman on a tirade about a man who was
Potter was a pleasant enough neighbour all in all and a lot more attractive than he had been at school, which of course caught Draco’s eye straight away. He'd been scrawny and rangy as a teenager, but was sporting Auror-hewn bulk now, and Draco had to admit he was not cross about that in the least. They got on surprisingly well together, despite the odd barb or jab, and often stopped for a chat when they walked outside at the same time. Potter was, for want of a better word, quite charming, and the big genuine smiles he gave Draco upon seeing him did funny things to Draco’s insides. Not to mention his bawdy humour that at times had Draco wondering if Potter was flirting with him.
, at any rate. He's made that abundantly clear.
Draco was twirling a Zippo in his fingers the first time we kissed.
They fell into each other on the sofa, laughing, after a few cleaning charms had been cast; still a bit sweaty, a bit flushed, but giddy with the sheer amazement of it. The relief of finally connecting on that weird and thrilling ‘we just made each other come’ level, a breathless freedom, cumbersome and clumsy as it was. But just what they both needed.
And—if you asked him—Harry would have told you that he finally felt he belonged. Here, in this cottage, with cheeky kettles and teasing teapots and a mouthy Malfoy. And that he wouldn't have traded it. Not for all the tea in China.
A luminous figure obscures his view. A ghost?
rather disappointed that you two didn't seem to, ah, warm to each other. Things had gotten so strained, so it's marvellous news to hear you've decided to turn over a new leaf."
Malfoy beamed at him, and Harry’s heart throbbed.
Draco was at a loss to respond to that unexpected compliment. He was wondering if perhaps Potter wasn’t quite as obnoxious as he remembered.
that fucking massage…" Potter closed his eyes for a second, and Draco watched him, scarcely able to believe the things he was hearing. "...someone who I reflexively assumed would aggravate the fuck out of me, but who has surprised me beyond measure over the course of a couple of hours, not to mention made me laugh stupidly, then I dunno, I feel like I can't afford not to take a chance to spend more time with him." Potter looked down at their hands and back up, and he frowned. "Of course, that man might not want to. And that's totally fine, too. Understandable, even. I'm a bit of a bloody mess to be honest, so I don't even—"
“Would you like to try again?” asked Fordus, but Draco shook his head, not meeting the man’s eyes.
Posted: 14 April 2021
"Would it—" Harry said, and then faltered.
“Clearly!” Draco replied, curling a protective arm around his stomach. “But I thought we were trying to be
. I'm so sorry, Malfoy. What do I owe you?" He pulled his wallet out of the the pocket of his white shorts—fuck they made his legs look good—and began riffling through its contents.
It was all that sodding snooty kettle's fault.
. You'd think they would be pleased."
Draco pointed to Mr Gnome’s neck and then to his own. “He’s got a little tear. His stuffing is coming out.”
“Yes.”
Harry braced in anticipation, waiting for a blow from some madman called 'Father', clearly the head of this creepy Dark clan. Moments passed like eternities. Desperate, he tried a wandless
Granger smiled, then nodded. Trusting.
Draco blushed, and he shuffled nearer to Potter on the sofa, and they sat facing each other, legs in the lotus position, and kissed. Draco kissed Potter on the lips, and along the his line of his jaw, and Potter kissed the apple of Draco’s cheek, and the corner of his eye, and the lobe of his ear, and they both had fingertips on each other’s necks and in each other's hair, until finally Draco pulled back and just asked, though he felt shy about it, "What are we now?"
—he truly believed Malfoy would be the answer to Puddlemere's success.
in the mood for a shag, if that was all the same to Draco. Draco had spluttered with momentary indignation which quickly changed to mortified and hasty reassurances, and thankfully Harry had agreed with him that a lie down was probably the next best thing to a cup of tea for calming his frayed nerves. Though it hadn't stopped him lamenting the lack of a decent cuppa for a good minute or two. And then that led on to a mournful elegy to his lost teapot.
"Malfoy, then. Any idea? Any. Bloody. Clue?"
Draco nods.
When Teddy started living with them—officially
"Both of you!" Kreacher cried, attempting to pour cold water on the argument that was beginning to flare up. "Pipe down! We is needing to fix this shame you is bringing upon your noble households; else-wise they is in danger of being ripped asunder by your foolishness."
Draco heard Potter walk away and wondered if Potter might let him carry on, when suddenly the cuttings and potted flowers he’d bought at Longbottom’s nursery began levitating towards the wheelie bins at the side of the house.
are you making tea in a saucepan?"
Malfoy. He smirked and continued dancing, moving towards Harry. Harry was vaguely aware that he should be panicking. Draco Malfoy was
“Really? Are you sure?”
Next up was Potter, and Draco didn’t even need to watch. Of bloody course he’d do it perfectly. After the display Potter definitely seemed much more open-minded and a lot less sneery, and actually clapped the efforts of both Jericho and Sam.
Placid's laugh is mirthless and cruel. "Now, why would I do that?"
If Harry was honest, It wasn't his finest breakfast. The eggs were cooked more firm, and the bacon and tomatoes a little more crispy than he'd intended; and most disappointingly, it was without a pot of tea.
any of the food before collapsing. Maybe then he could get out of this with his reputation intact. Oh, who was he kidding, this was going to be the ruin of him.
"Don't say anything," Potter huffs, shuffling around a bit on the mattress and then stilling again.
"Will it make me lie?" Harry held Draco’s gaze.
Draco's breath hitched. "I- It feels very arousing for me too." He looked away from Harry, before going on. "Physically though, you see, it's difficult enough getting erect on
!” he called out firmly, doing the requisite circular motion with his wand. The tip glowed a pale blue and hissed a little, but as he feared, nothing issued forth from it.
"Oh, 'bloody hell' yourself, Potter," Draco retorted. "And how should I know where she's gone? She's your teapot!"
Potter sat. He didn’t say anything for a few moments, but when he did he looked right into Draco’s eyes, and it looked like he’d just had an epiphany. "It's bonkers levels of
Luna plonked herself down in between Harry and Draco on the wooden bench, a jinglejangle of necklaces and bangles as she threw an arm around both of them.
Draco was amused and satisfied by Potter's reaction: he drew a short gasp and his eyes grew wide with surprise. Then he nodded and hurriedly flagged the waiter over, ordering them another round.
"I don't know for certain, but I do know sentient household objects are capable of much more than we realise...” Draco paused, and then conceded, “especially in times of great need."
a perfectly executed Patronus. He handed the wand back to Draco and their fingers brushed. Potter let the touch linger for a moment and then pulled his hand back and looked at it.
“Potter, you're not listening. I’m not getting back with Gabriel. Seriously.” They rounded a corner to a field where a group of teenagers were running and tossing a rugby ball to each other. One of them shouted ‘Knock on!’ and they all grumbled and stopped running.
"You too, Auror Malfoy," Robards sighs.
But if you were to ask Harry when he thinks Draco looks the most beautiful, he would say it's when Draco is sitting in their kitchen in his baby blue pyjama bottoms, sun streaming in the window, a suggestion of morning stubble on his scrubbed-clean face, his long hair tied back with that bright yellow banana clip he bought for 50p on Petticoat Lane market. Smiling at Harry and teasing him about the jam on his cheek.
in all its colour-coded, daily-sectioned and time-stamped glory.
"No, just- I, uh, don't think that's a good idea." Harry pressed his face further into the towel in embarrassment and gripped the sides of the mattress, willing his erection to subside. He frantically tried to recite a section of the Auror Code of Conduct in his head as a distraction technique. '
And that was all it took for Harry to decide he'd had enough and storm out, tea undrunk, like the brute he was.
“Just so you know," Potter added, "I still think it’s stupid going through all this trouble for a basket of meat, but I can tell this means a lot to you." Potter met Draco's eyes for the first time, and blinked, and Draco was surprised to feel ever so fond. "And I'm sort of surprised and mildly irritated at myself but, seeing how happy it's made you now… has made it feel really worthwhile." He smiled sheepishly, and it made Draco's heart do cartwheels.
"Draco, shut up." Potter's hand tightens on Draco’s head, so Draco shuts up. “I like our life too. And I like that it’s with you. So much. And, well... I’m a little bit in love too.” He clears his throat and a tiny smile appears on his face, and Draco wonders if in fact he’s still asleep, and this is a fantastic dream. Because it can’t be that Potter, with his intensely green eyes and his curls pulled messily into a bun—Merlin, he’s beautiful—is moving his fingers slowly, achingly slowly, down Draco’s cheek, tracing the scar from Potter’s own curse, and finally resting the pads of them on his lips… and… and saying that he loves Draco too. It can’t be.
"Speaking of..." Potter scrubbed a hand through his hair. "What are you doing all the way out here? It's been years. Why Bali? Why massages? I'm confused, the last time I—"
Draco huffs and rolls his eyes, then throws his hands in the air in exasperation. He knows he's being dramatic but Potter is being impossibly
“Where are your friends?" Malfoy asked, and when Harry shrugged, smiling, Draco asked, "Are you… Is it your first time... on

weren't playing fair.
"I think you know," Draco snapped, nodding to where Potter had just begun scratching his neck.
The villagers took pride in their neighbourhoods being neat and pretty and orderly—whether they contained large Tudor-style houses or quaint thatched cottages or rows of red-brick terraced houses—and none more so than local resident and renowned Prophet columnist Draco Malfoy.
"Merlin, no way. On my birthday. That's such a coincidence!"
Could they be
"I'll get these," Harry said. "You grab a seat somewhere. Tea or coffee?"
He rolls around in the sheets and ends up even more hot and itchy, not to mention tangled up. He throws off the sheet after a brief twist and tussle. Sitting up, he strips off his shirt, needing to cool his torso.
Potter stopped a step later, and turned to him. “What?” he said, flatly.
He's distracted with his thoughts when Potter clears his throat and looks needily at him. He holds out his hand, steels himself for the zap, and when Potter grasps it, gasping "Thanks," an apology in his eyes, Draco feels the electric sizzle and his magic responds eagerly. Or maybe it's his cock.
, Seamus had said, and he'd been right—and now he always made sure to catch their TV shows whenever they were on. Draco had been tired from marking end of term assignments so stumbled off to bed early, but Harry had been still buzzing from the conclusion of a sting operation—a rather successful one too, he might add.
And a ring that could conduct magic could be extremely useful as a conduit to channel magical energy, or more specifically, to divert the wild bursts that erupted when Harry was emotional, explosions that that shattered mirrors and picture frames and knocked cups of tea to the floor, that turned plants from green to purple, and sent Diesel (the kneazle) yowling from the room in distress. It would be like having a wand on him at all times, directing his magic according to his wishes, rather than the whim of his emotions.
he wants. And it would be so easy to slide his own erection against Potter's. Just for a few seconds. Fuck, he wants to so much. He clenches his buttocks to stop himself from thrusting, but the motion drives his hips forward infinitesimally, nudging into Potter, and a very pleasurable electric shock zips through his cock, causing it to harden further. Potter grunts softly and Draco freezes. Their cocks are pressed right against each other now.
Yes. The ring fit in perfectly with Draco’s plans.
lemon sponge.
His heart beat even faster when an oscillating synth intro kicked in; he'd heard this one before—at Nev's house—and hated it at the time, but here, now, he was helpless to stop his hips and arms from moving, moving, moving; it was exhilarating. The music built and built to a crescendo—
Malfoy studied him with big eyes, pupils as wide and black as the bottom of a cauldron. Then he leaned in close so Harry could hear and said, all in a rush, "I saw you dancing. And I’ve been wanting for ages to say sorry for being so awful to you, you know,”—he whirled his finger in the air—“all the time. You’re the reason I’m still alive. You’re... Well, you know what you are. Obviously.” Harry didn’t. He
Draco's cheeks warmed. “Obviously I won't be completely permissive. Any child of mine should be mannerly and respectful. What about you?”
Harry laughed, good-naturedly, "Oh yeah?"
He realised then that Harry had stopped talking mid-monologue and was instead snoring softly, glasses askew and all signs of worry absent from his face. The steady rise and fall of Harry's chest was soothing and relaxing, and just as Draco was wondering whether he too ought to clamber in next to his boyfriend and have forty winks himself, an abominable racket arose from outside.

And even though Potter
Laughing, they made their way to the kitchen, and while Harry made cheese on toast for them both, with a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and an extra handful of grated Cornish cheddar for Draco—seeing as he was eating for four, and was also a little bit addicted to cheese—Draco thought about how lucky he was to have bumped into Harry after all these years and found a warm, caring friend in him, and someone to share this new chapter of his life with, and actually he was a little bit addicted to that too.

A short burst of steam issued from Mrs Potts' spout. "Sorry;
They all turn to Jeffrey who looks as surprised as they do, including Potter who's just stood up and is rubbing his hip and wincing. The Magister takes a step towards Jeffrey, purple-faced with rage, gritting out "What is the meaning of—" but then he falls heavily to the ground, Potter having given him a taste of his own hex.
"I'm going to give you your wand," Draco says, firm and calm. "You will end this curse. Then I will take the wand from you again. Understood?" Draco returns his own wand to the side of the Magister's neck.
Oh bugger it, Harry thought, giving up. It wasn't working.
Funnily enough, it was one of their snarky little rows that precipitated them moving in together. Draco had tripped on

Remembering the whole thing now—with the benefit of distance in both time and geography (though it’s only been a week, and he’s only living on the other side of the Thames)—Harry finds that he’s a little nervous. And suspicious, too, of the raw depth of their conversations that night. Though suspicious is perhaps not the right word. Sceptical, certainly.

Potter looked at him as if he’d sprouted two heads. “What the fuck are you on about now, Malfoy?”
"You didn't mean that you're in love with me?"
Well, Potter's got him there. But Draco says, "There are possibly elements of the spell that need tweaking—honestly, a bit overzealous some of it, in my view—but I- well, I have become extremely, ugh,
Chef Marco had the whole team on high alert. At the slightest sign or hint of Epicure they were to let him know so that he could give Epicure the best dining experience of their life.
Potter closed the guidebook, and his shoulders slumped. "Yeah okay, it's annoying as fuck."

"What are you looking for exactly?" Magister Placid asks.
It's quiet by the lake this early. Too quiet. The pallid sun slips into view, casting a desolate light, throwing everything into sharp contrast.
Potter burst out laughing, and Draco wasn’t quite quick enough to hold in the wince. He felt sick. Stupid and gullible and sick.
She really needn't remind me, but I know it's a comfort to her.
Harry watches as Draco's Adam's apple bobs. "Alright. This is nothing to do with work. Pure theory… yes?" Draco winks, and Harry catches on, nodding.
“Er, Malfoy, if you weren’t already going with someone, and if you’d like to of course,
Everyone was smiling.
Mrs Potts sulked behind the plant, nursing her lid despite Harry's assurances that the chip was barely noticeable, but she wouldn't be convinced. Harry grumbled to himself as he plated their breakfast, and Hestia rattled smugly on the hob, her spout held high and copper gleaming.
Potter’s look of confusion was answer enough. “Tidy Streets contest? Nope. No one’s mentioned it.”
Granger laughed through a sniffle. "He sends his love, and a very large eye-roll."
The sun is rising. The bodies have all been removed, and the dawn creeps across the now barren landscape, its cool hues turning warmer and banishing the murk.
Or at least Draco
Draco stopped laughing, quite suddenly in fact, and Harry almost regretted his question. He seemed to ponder something seriously for a few moments. Harry's nerves gathered in the pit of his stomach until a smile began to quirk at the edges of Draco's lips.
"Tea would be great. Milk and two sugars, please."
“Oh, Harry,” Draco said, moving aside a lock of hair to kiss the scar on his brow.

“Alright, so that would make you a FILF. That is
it a mistake? How will Harry feel if he never gets to kiss Malfoy again? (Harry can still taste the pineapple if he thinks about it hard enough.)  He felt so close to Draco that night. He felt like it meant something. Was it all just the potion? Thoughts pull at him, and he feels nauseous from it.
When they got to Godric’s Hollow, the air was crisp and fresh, and the small lawn at the front of the ruined house was littered with red and orange leaves from the big overhanging rowan tree. The kids pushed past the gate without even noticing the graffiti’d sign and ran straight into the garden.
"Actually. They do a very delicious cocktail called a 'Pink Peach Pucker'."

better,” Potter laughed, “Sounds like a Londoner saying ‘filth’. Though
“Very odd,” Potter said, finally, and Draco felt stung. He’d known it would be a bad idea to open up like this, to Potter of all people. Potter coughed. “Jesus, Malfoy. You know, you’ve changed a lot.”
He got up and walked to the window. Maybe he'd see Malfoy on the beach from here, he mused, and then he swore under his breath. Fucking Malfoy. He couldn't even enjoy the sight of the palm trees and frangipani that surrounded the villa's pool—one of those swanky infinity ones that seem to drop off onto the horizon—because all he could bloody well think about now was Malfoy. What was he doing here, Harry asked himself again, looking all bronzed and speaking the lingo and giving back rubs to people on the beach? And why the hell did it have to be the very same beach that Harry decided to go on holiday to? If Harry didn't know better he'd think Hermione had engineered the whole thing! Only that was impossible. And ridiculous. Organising for him to travel seven thousand miles just to get a massage from Malfoy would be a ludicrous plan, even for her.
, then. Yes, I’ll be your date.”
He pushed past yet another crate draped in a white sheet, wondering when it had gotten so bloody cramped in this cellar, and really, why in Merlin's name Draco needed all this junk. He forged on ahead, shimmying past an old oak armoire. Something on the floor unsettled his footing, and he fell heavily against the wood, attempting to steady himself by grabbing the armoire's handles.
than the last one."
“Ah, I feel a little woozy now.”
Draco doesn't crumble easily, but he falls apart safely with Blaise. It's a ritual, a sick nostalgia, how Blaise removes Draco's clothes one by one and turns him onto his stomach. He doesn’t feel the sting of defeat as Blaise roughly angles Draco's hips and licks him open, doesn’t feel the helplessness of finality as the pillow fills his mouth to muffle his crying.
And hang on, he thought belatedly, Harry Potter... pregnant?!
"Aren't you going to make a pot?" Harry asked.

And yes, he was cold, and yes, he was pale as a spectre, and yes, he was a selfish bloody brat with a dirty mouth, but by fuck he gave Harry what he needed most.

The manor’s darkness is pregnant, foreboding.  The elves are silent, watching them.  But the evening won’t be quiet for long and it’s only a house, in the end, even on All Hallows' Eve.  Harry’s fingers are tingling.
Albus sneers as though he’s still working through the loss.  “The weather was bad,” he excuses himself, his red hair a mop – and at least he’s not lashing out, Harry thinks.
There’s a child in Harry’s head who wants to run, or maybe shout.  The rest of him can only stare.

Astoria still owns half.  Draco’s parents wouldn’t let him use family money to buy her out, so for now he pays her rent.  Albus has stayed here a couple of times, but Harry would have thought that he’d never been here before if Draco hadn’t brought it up in December.
On Halloween afternoon, Harry emerges from the floo in the kitchen of the third-floor flat in number 12, Grimmauld Place.  The bedroom is a sage colour now, but they’ve redone the walls in the living room stone-snow white.  Last weekend Harry painted the ceiling a soft, near-beige peach-yellow-orange, to play off the blue of the sofa and the brown of the antiquarian maps, framed and stuck on the walls – the colours of his painting over the sofa and the creamy tones of Draco’s ash furniture, the southern light which floods through the windows on sunny days.  He’s terribly fond of the effect.
It’s impossible, Harry thinks, giving in entirely.  He nudges up his head, and Draco turns to look, his body humming, or maybe that’s Harry’s.  After a moment of staring into the pits of Draco’s eyes, Harry’s kissing him, hesitating for a moment before the gap’s closed and they’re shuffling onto their sides, all hips and elbows, tongues in the end, too much feeling like a chasm they’re rolling into.  Harry ends up between Draco the door, which is always the way that they sleep.
“It’s not precisely a secret,” Draco demurs, though he fully intends to tell no one.  “The veil is my responsibility, as are apparition incidents and – ghosts, as far as they need to be registered.”
“He had long hair and used to play Black Sabbath in the common room,” Sirius goes on, needling, and he makes Harry want to sit down and talk to him, somewhere in the depths of a cavernous house.  “D’you remember?  Alice Cooper,” he says, as though this memory is particularly fond.
“Splendid work, Pineneedle!" Adrenaline shot through Draco, energising him. This was it, the restaurant’s time to shine. "Go back out there and make sure he gets the best service he’s ever had. Schmooze him like your life depends on it, then come back and tell me
"Let's go and show your grandma and grandad what amazing grandchildren they have," Harry said, giving Draco's shoulder a squeeze.
Smith was an arrogant knob who thought himself better than everyone else. Draco had thoroughly enjoyed seeing his disgruntled ruddy face when Foxglove Close had won the last three years. But now Draco’s face went paler than the Wensleydale he was holding because he realised that his street losing meant Smith would be the probable winner. Hyacinth Avenue almost always came second; they’d be sure to swoop in and claim that meat hamper as their own.
, tucked away in his bedroom that he seems to think is soundproof.
it work?"
“Brilliant!”
There came, as if carried on the afternoon breeze, a bizarre whistling noise and the chime of a bell and then a haughty voice, "Masters Draco and Harry! Masters Draco and Harry!"
Together, they haul the Magister to his feet and prepare to take him and Jeffrey to the Ministry for processing.
“I can't imagine what you mean. If you’d rather not wear the dragon cufflinks, just say! Though the emeralds in them would really accent your eyes gorgeously, and did I say they were self-affixing, so no fiddly-ness required?”
He tried another memory—whizzing through the air, his Quidditch robes snapping against his thighs and finally, finally closing his hand around the fluttering Snitch to beat Gryffindor—but that failed too.
Young Master Malfoy simply refused to leave his Mother's side no matter what and trailed around after her everywhere she went, even when she sat in the drawing room to do dressmaking or garment-adjusting charms and, rather than having him be noisy and troublesome, Mother had ended up just putting the blasted needle and thread and a battered old practice wand into his chubby hands with a muttered remark about it being good and practical for men to learn a few sewing and repairing charms—as if a future Lord of the Manor would ever need to know something like that.
——— [o] ———
Draco shook his head. Potter was unbelievable.
“May I see that?” he asked the seller, approaching the stall.
“Not in the slightest. You’re not responsible for them. Just as you’re not responsible for saving the world. At least not anymore.”
"Yes!" Harry said and opened his arms, not understanding why he would ever say no to that.
“Hmm, alright then.” And Draco let him curl his fingers around his hand, and said nothing when the side of Potter’s bump pressed into his back. Draco caught the smell of neroli and vetiver, and he smiled—Potter was wearing a scent Draco had created,
A short moment passed before the reply came. "Yes, you'd like a massage, or yes, you work—"

The merging of households was supposed to be a beautiful thing, so how had it gone so wrong? If Molly Weasley had taught her anything it was that kind words, baked treats and a good cup of tea were three of the most important components of a harmonious home. Hadn't she tried to make it work? To come to an understanding with Hestia and Draco—only to see Harry scalded and herself mercilessly insulted?
Draco unfolded the parchment and smoothed it out on the table.
“I'm serious, Draco. Potter’s wearing an earring.”
If Harry knew one thing about himself it was that there was no way he would be able to ignore the whole thing and pretend it never happened, much as he might want to. He had to find out what Malfoy was doing here.
“You may have. It was only me who wore the disguise. He's a Muggle, so unable to cast a glamour, obviously. Also…" Draco paused, embarrassed, "...he said it didn’t give off the right look for him to be seen out with a Malfoy. He's read up on his wizarding culture and history, you see. Wanted to be successful in both the Muggle and wizarding fashion worlds. And to be fair, people were
Draco turned around as quickly as he could to shush the man, or at least scowl at him for taking the piss, but as quickly as he could was not terribly quick, and he ended up sitting sideways on the chair, needing to take it in stages, and before he knew it the man was saying “Jesus!” again in a much more surprised tone, and then, “Draco sodding Malfoy, never in a million years…” and by then Draco had turned fully around and found himself looking straight into the bewildered face of Harry Potter.
Later, after a practical demonstration of how to feed your baby and a discussion about what potions were suitable for reflux, Fordus advised them that he had a bit of homework for them. The topic was Patronuses.
This past week Harry’s been happier than he’s ever been, easier to get along with (according to Wilf, his buddy on the Auror training program, and according to Ron too, who is the authority on Harry's moods), and really at peace with himself. He’s made a concerted effort to be the

, dipped his quill and started again. Two more erasing spells later, his fourth iteration was just going to have to do.
They sit there frozen for a moment longer, unmoving, staring into each other, breaths shallow.
And then, when their mugs were empty, Draco suggested something else.
"Alright, well actually I do need to get away. Meeting Millie at the Crumpled Horn in ten.” She gathered her things. “Think about what I said, darling, I can get Theo to cater, he does the most gorgeous mini Victoria sponges dusted with blue or pink icing sugar, and get this, these little cauldron cakes that he pipes into a meringue ‘nappy’ to look just like—”
But Potter is straight in with, "We will of course turn them over to you if they are not required for our investigation. And if they are, we can provide you with copies." Trust him to remember their first year training when it really counts.
Harry laughed when he saw Teddy, "You look amazing, Teds. What's this for?"
Harry opened the door a crack and peered around its edge. Kirana had a look of great concern plastered on her face, and she was shifting nervously from foot to foot. Harry looked behind her, expecting to see Jamie, the friendly but burly concierge. He did
Before they knew it, though, the big lights started coming on, room by room, and a small sadness crept into Harry’s mind as he realised the night was winding down and people were leaving.
so hard as Dorothy did to get home. Thankfully things were very different now. Draco had enjoyed the film a lot; though Harry had enjoyed Draco's mild indignation at the Muggles' depiction of magic much, much more.
Draco smiled, relief coursing through his body.
"Sounds like I should have been the one wearing the fairy wings, then," Harry grinned.
At Hogwarts, Draco kept a mokeskin pouch under his robes that he told no one about. There were just the basics inside; a couple of pins and needles, a few tiny spools of thread in varying colours, his favourite silver thimble and about half a dozen different buttons.
, oh Merlin, oh
"Harry, she's a 'she' not an 'it', and there's no need—" Draco was cut short when Harry yelped. Hestia had surreptitiously squirted a jet of water at him. Draco stifled a laugh.
"C'mon, dad," Al sniggered. "You're forgetting about Dolores."
Harry gulped and said "That means what I think it means, yeah?" right as the singer purred

," so appallingly reverently that Draco's insides liquify.
Harry placed his hand on Draco's shoulder and gave it a squeeze. "You're sort of hot when you're being all ‘fatherly'." Draco quirked a surprised eyebrow at him and Harry grinned back.
“Tomorrow is fine. I have a thing at lunchtime, but I could meet you in the afternoon. Do you want to come over to mine? Say three o’clock?”
Later, he spotted Allison talking to Potter in the corridor, who was scowling a little but nodding at whatever it was she was saying. Then Potter shrugged at something and rolled his eyes, causing Allison to laugh loudly, and Draco dared to hope.
) drifting off on the breeze.
thought Harry, as he heard footsteps carrying the pair of them away from his door and the unmistakeable voice of Kirana, high-pitched but decreasing in volume as they retreated, "Unbelievable! Wasting everyone's time! All this money some people have, and yet manners cost nothing. You'd think…"
It was all the bloody teapot's fault, that was the thing, Draco thought as he drank his tea. He really didn't want to cast aspersions against a gift from Molly Weasley, who Harry called 'mum' and who treated Draco to suffocating hugs and roast dinners every other Sunday when they visited. He really hadn't wanted to call it an ugly patterned monstrosity with an attitude problem, because he knew Harry loved the damn thing, but, well... if the chipped lid fit...
Potter must have seen the shock on his face, because he put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “When Cho fainted I completely panicked. I couldn’t think what I was supposed to do. I realise now I probably could have just sent a Patronus… to someone, to Ginny, to ask what to do. I just froze, and all I could think was to run to you. I knew you’d help.”
“Cutting it fine, there, Draco,” said Allison, smiling.
Because he couldn't.
And Merlin, the git looked good. And had felt good too, under Draco's hands. Though Draco hadn't missed the excessive rattiness of his hair, and the dark circles and lines around Potter's eyes… right before his gaze was diverted south (and

to talk to them about work stuff; the confidentiality charms are such a bugger.
Potter looked enquiringly at Draco, who shook his head. "Nope," said Potter. "Just the drinks, please."
Potter takes one big step and the next thing his hands are either side of Draco's head, fingers in his hair as he pulls their mouths together. It's a quick, hot kiss, just lips and a little flick of tongue, but it still draws a desperate noise from Draco: half-whine, half-moan.
"POTTER! MALFOY!" Robards roars at them in the corridor outside Interrogation Room B. Potter almost jumps out of his skin and springs away from Draco like he's been burned. "You mean to tell me you haven't figured out this blasted curse yet?! Your report says you apprehended the perpetrator four days ago, and yet here you are, faces buried in each other's necks like the curse has gotten worse not better! What is the meaning of this blatant duplicity?!"
"So, you’ll know the rules well by now. You can return this afternoon."

It all started when they were sent to investigate a crime at the Nevi-Wesh coven in the New Forest. One of its members had been murdered, a young witch by the name of Trista, and they suspected the perpetrator was one of their own.

“Nah, it’s fine.” Harry curled his arm around Draco’s waist, slipping his fingers into his belt loop. “This is enough.”
“Put your feet up, mister.”
Ms Kite raised an eyebrow. “Hermione Granger is here with Draco Malfoy. I find that hard to believe.”
, she says with a grimace, but doesn't elaborate.
Of course, it was when Pansy was visiting that the owl came. He hadn’t even had a chance to get around to the subject of birth partnering. She was in the middle of pestering Draco for the umpteenth time about having a baby shower—which he vehemently did not want—when the bird swooped through the balcony's sliding doors and dropped the envelope onto his kitchen table.
Potter frowns. "Then how...?"

a partner, so it’s probably nigh on impossible when you’re single.”
Draco’s eyes travelled down to the swollen stomach stretching a bright orange Chudley Cannons hoodie to its limits. Not just Harry Potter, a heavily pregnant Harry Potter. And well, Draco lost the function of speech for a few seconds.
“Malfoy, if you don’t stop what you’re doing right now, I’ll trim that sodding buxus hedge into the shape of a giant cock and balls, and there’ll be absolutely nothing you or any of the weirdos on this street will be able to do about it. Now go home, no contest is worth this,” Potter said, sounding tired.
Granger snorted. “Merlin, you’ve got the same black humour as he does anyway. I… I think I understand why he’s with you. And I can’t argue that you don’t care about him.”
Merlin bless him, Harry had been so awfully smitten with this Malfoy lad. How anxious he'd been telling his friends about his secret infatuation, long before he'd ever plucked up the courage to ask Malfoy out. She remembered the way he would pace in front of the large stone kitchen hearth for a good twenty minutes before many of their dates, fussing with his hair and fretting over his robes, and all but willing the Floo to roar into life. And the way he tumbled back through the same hearth some hours later with Malfoy in tow, both smelling of firewhiskey and frivolity, giggling and grunting as they discarded clothes and shoes on their way upstairs.

There's a large black and white clock on the wall with all the Auror names on various hands. His and Potter's are hovering in between 'Ministry' and 'In Trouble'.
“Well then, I want to say that I don't despise you at all and that you and I… should, er…” Harry faltered, and Draco dropped his eyes. “We should wipe the slate clean and, y’know, just be us, as we are now. What happened in the past happened. We’re Harry and Draco. Not Potter and Malfoy.”
Draco slowed and stopped at a place called The Hook—a tiny café, a bit shed-like, with condensation all up the front window. A sign over the door proclaimed 'All's Well That Enswell'.
Draco stopped as several loud bangs and a chorus of cheers resounded from downstairs. The smile fell from his face. He rested his head on Harry's shoulder and an exasperated sigh escaped his mouth. "It really,

and ran with it...
Like Draco said to Potter, it all sounded wonderful. There was just one small problem. Draco had never managed to cast a Patronus. Not even the tiniest wisp of one.
He considered not taking the potion, obviously, but his curiosity and his desire to just not feel
You were a shit. The things you did to me?
Draco finally snapped out of it and followed Potter out to the restaurant. He flinched when he saw Chang lying on the floor, unresponsive. The other diners were staring and muttering anxiously, and some had abandoned their tables and were crouching around her. The coward in Draco desperately wanted to Apparate out of there and hide under his duvet and cry over how horrible this night was turning out to be, but one look at Potter changed his mind.
"Merlin, no," Draco assures, desire thrilling through him at Potter's words. "Never."
In the two years since their first kiss, at Pansy and Longbottom's engagement party of all places—and Draco, for all his gifts, hadn't seen
So despite detesting that big gaudy teapot, with her simpering and smirking, even Hestia Seraphina Black wasn't too proud to admit that she'd become a little burnt out when it came to certain things. That perhaps she'd lost sight of the overarching objective of domestic appliances: to assist and facilitate household harmony.
"Well, our kids have certainly been Confunded by his bloody Shotgun song. Like... like toddler-rats bewitched by a throaty-voiced pied piper! They play it over and over again, until you want to scrub your ears out with a strong Scourgify and drown yourself in firewhisky."
." He shook his head, feeling the familiar wave of paranoia start to take hold. "And now I'm starting to regret it."
And that's enough of a confession for Potter. He raises his wand, ready to cast his usual Disarming and Restraining spells, but the Magister is too quick, managing to fire off a hex at Potter's legs. Potter buckles at the knees and hits the stone floor hard.
Robards was only too happy to sign off on the annual leave request, and Harry began to wonder if the man wasn't also a bit relieved to have Harry gone for a while.
the exception to that. If there was a rule to be broken or a trend to be bucked, Potter would be the one to do it.
He had to think like an Auror. He'd got himself out of trickier situations than this in the past. He had skills he could bring to bear here.
They agreed to meet in Weaver’s Fields by the sculpture. Draco got there first, and shifted from one foot to the other until he saw Potter coming through the Kelsey Street entrance, not easy to miss in that oversized yellow jumper. Thinking it would be weird to just stare at Potter approaching, Draco looked down and studiously read the plaque of the sculpture until Potter was close enough for Draco to turn and nervously say, "Hi."
“Intriguing,” Harry smirked, sipping his tea.
Potter then proceeded to intimate everything that led to his trip, detailing his workaholic lifestyle, and confessing that this was the first proper holiday he'd ever actually been on. A chill swept up Draco's spine at Potter's casual mention that 'hiding out in the Forest of Dean with a horcrux' didn't really count, and he was surprised that he actually felt sorry for the man when he recounted the ill-fated camping trip with the Weaslette.
Potter walked away before Draco could so much as argue, and Draco was left to stare at his retreating form, mouth opening and closing like a beached Grindylow. Draco clenched his fists and stalked back to his house, past his own perfect privet hedge and blooming begonias. Potter would not get the last word on this, not if he could help it.
So actually, Harry'd thought as he levitated his trunk over the threshold of Draco's terraced cottage, there was nothing to be nervous about. Nothing could possibly come between them that they couldn't laugh off, or settle decisively with a tumble in Draco's—
"Salazar, no. I just hadn't intended to offload all of this onto anyone." Draco paused. "Least of all
"Fuck, this is really good, and not as sickly sweet as I imagined."
"Harry, babe," she said, close to his ear. "You need to let loose. I love you, you know that, and I worry about you. Come and dance. Come on."
different, though his heart seemed to beat faster.
Draco pulled Potter's wand out of his shoulder bag, thrusting it toward him. "Here, take it, and just forget about the massage. I didn't finish the service, and clearly you don't want to see me; I can only assume that's why it took you two days to finally front up and seek me out. You probably tried your level best to summon the bloody thing back from your villa, especially after slamming the door in my face and—"
you don’t want a relationship with them. But what if your child does one day?”
you bother to attend." In truth, Draco was glad for any excuse not to share. Potter didn't need to hear about how his sex life consisted of solitary masturbatory efforts, or about how much planning and positioning was required to be able to reach for long enough to get the deed done, as it were. And how in the last month, he'd had to give up entirely, and was just in a constant low-level state of near arousal—something to do with the increased blood flow to that area, and Merlin, the sheer number of blokes in jogging bottoms and yoga pants these days did not help one bit—with little hope of release. He loved being heavy with child, but it did have its downsides.
Track after track played, melodic pulsating trance filled with soaring build ups and euphoric drops, and Harry felt incredible, he was weightless and full of energy. He wanted to tell Malfoy but realised he was struggling to speak. He could hardly move his jaw. He turned in Malfoy’s arms, facing him. “Malf— I…”
By the time the car dropped him off at the villa complex, he'd lost count of the number of hours he'd been travelling—or even what day it was—and was ready for a proper rest. Only the villa Hermione had organised wasn't ready yet. He checked his baggage with the concierge (first retrieving a pair of cheerful speedos and picking up a complimentary beach towel in a delightful shade of sunshine yellow) and followed their directions to a nearby popular tourist establishment to get a post-flight pick-me-up (cocktail) and a bite to eat (the fruit in the aforementioned cocktail). It would be a few hours before he could check in officially, but they'd have his things taken to his villa as soon as it was ready.
"Alright," Harry said, "though I can't understand how Mrs Potts would end up there. Or why. Can teapots even Apparate?" He cast a drying spell on the cups and levitated them to the cupboard—all wandlessly of course, the show-off. "But yeah, I suppose we should explore all possibilities."
.  Harry hated it on sight.  He tried hard not to look –
“This is my house,” Harry insists, meeting Teddy’s amber eyes.  Teddy fits in perfectly here, where the walls are colourful like magic.  “You live here in my totalitarian state,” he says nonetheless, for the joke.
They were kissing then, Draco the child deviant and the boy from the cupboard.  Draco had his hands in the boy’s hair, and it felt right that their bodies were tangled between them.  The mouth against his own tasted of dinner and wine and something familiar, bitter and saline.
Now, some would say that Harry lets himself be led.  Maybe this is what happens, when he agrees to go on holiday with Draco despite every warning in his gut.
before he can think –
’s front page in the Slytherin common room.
It’s her patronus, Draco realises, a tiny quail no larger than a cooking apple, though it’s effortlessly graceful on wing.  Another turn, and then it escapes into sunlight.  He remembers its vivid white form like a star in winter darkness, a model that he needed to follow and a pick-me-up for their spirits.
by acting like he cared about you?”
“I’ve been busy,” Harry excuses himself.  He thought that he’d been doing all right.  He looks down at his hands on his knees, his bitten nails – the injunction not to tell lies.  “We don’t see each other much – he’s busy too.”
“I imagined that he had,” agrees Harry’s dad breezily, as though they’re having lunch.  He sighs.  “I’ve told him; it’s terribly unhealthy, working at the weekend – but what can be done?  Will you be going to see Teddy?” he asks Harry.
Merlin knows what Snape said to Dumbledore about Harry’s role in that.
Doing what Luna can’t, Harry tucks his mouth to Draco’s ear.  “Your old bedroom,” he suggests in a whisper.  “Where you used to dream of me.”  He’s squeezing his hand as a hint.  “We’ve got ages…”
The top of Harry’s right leg from his hip to his knee is a mess, without feeling in the hard skin.  Draco’s palming it from knee to hip once the bottoms are gone, and Harry feels the pressure in his muscle, which bucks.  The lack of feeling is uncanny, otherwise – disturbing, Harry tells himself.  Draco pushes harder into the obscene white ridges and marks, spreading his hand down at the knee and keeping Harry pinned, his other hand holding Harry’s softer leg to the mattress.  He’s looking at him as tears swell in Harry’s eyes.
He’s internalised that love is conditional, which is why he tries to make people proud.  He doesn’t say
Harry knocks back the end of this next glass of wine and reaches for the bottle.  His feelings about other women’s bodies is why he’s sure that he’ll never understand Ginny’s thing with Neville.  But the thing is, he’s not guiltless, and this is what he’s been putting off explaining.
“Hello Prongs.”  There’s half a grin on Lupin’s face, all teeth, unintended.  His eyes are warm, and it’s the autumn leaves missing from Potter’s squall of joy.  “You’re looking well.”
By the new year, Harry’s feeling deflated and confused.  Then Kreacher informs him that a presumptuous elf – “Very young, Master Harry; inexperienced; not knowing the etiquettes, not like Kreacher; disgraceful,” – has requested that he stop sending letters because her master is away and Master Harry’s owl has taken to nipping.
“Master Draco,” Kreacher said as they rose to their feet.  There were tears in the old elf’s eyes as Draco took his hands.  He only wanted to be acknowledged, Kreacher, that was the thing.  To be called by his name.
“Don’t look at me,” his dad tells him on the beach, his eyes wide and guileless.  “I do the grunt work.”
It was a surprise when Potter kissed him, an arm hooked over his shoulder that didn’t stay there.  It was a surprise for a number of reasons, and an important one was that they were both reasonably sober.
Rolling his eyes, Sirius didn’t reply.  He moved on quickly.  “I’m not sitting through a single meal more where we do nothing but smile at each other and request the decanter.”  He seemed to think that he was clearing the air.  “If you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine.  There’s no need to freeze us out.”  And then he came out with something from nowhere.  “Did you really accuse Remus once upon a time of trying to
“Both hawthorn and common
Sirius made a face, his dark grey eyes alight as he grinned around his eyeteeth.  “Hark at you,” he said, sounding exactly like Harry’s mother.  “In my day it was cool to drink stuff like this.”  He was taking up his cappuccino by this point.  “Mm,” he said appreciatively, his nostrils flared as he breathed in the smell of the froth.
“What was that with the flashing?” Harry asks as the leopard vanishes, not thinking about who it could be.
He turns back to Lily, telling her wearily, “He’s leading the charge in someone else’s battle.”
“Draco’s missed you for years,” Harry tells her, not meaning to sound so accusing.  But she is being ridiculous.
” the voice then says more harshly – and it’s all defensiveness, Harry thinks.  Self-protection.  He sees that now.  “
“What’s the point?  There’s no fucking –“
In an instant, Harry is afire with adrenaline.  His fingers are tingling, exactly like it was back in school.
One night in early 2005, Draco was emphatically inebriated.  He hadn’t come out with any intentions: Granger frequently invited him to the pub, and often enough he and Potter found themselves in each other’s company at the end of the night – but they just as often did not.
“It’s all right, Lily love,” Black finally intervenes, squeezing her elbow and throwing James Potter an anxious look.  His eyebrows are knit in calculation, and he seems to decide several things very quickly.  “He’s only doing what he always does.”
“All right,” Lupin agrees, blinking as the ash falls.
Blinking the tears from his vision, Professor Harry Potter sets off into the dawn down the old, cobbled driveway which thestrals take, drawing carriages towards the castle.  Hagrid’s in the distance, off to pursue some task in the forest.  His arm rises like a flag as Harry waves good morning, greeting him in the east, like the sun.
In a single prowling movement, Draco climbs out of bed, rounds the long end of it and catches up Harry by the back of the head for what must be a goodbye or good-luck snog.  It’s like many they’ve shared before, and surely like many they’ll come to share again.
“Yes,” Draco agrees, because this is factually accurate.
“See, you’ve mischaracterised me in that scenario.”  Harry finds it almost funny, looking at Sirius here on the edge of the forest.
“She didn’t mean to,” Harry carries on shortly, with another swallow of wine.  “She got carried away.  But it opened a door in her head she couldn’t shut.”
, but
Harry fidgets with the hem of his t-shirt, not sure what his intestines are telling him, not trusting them.  “I went to see her,” he repeats, looking down at the vial.  “She had a really weird look on her face,” he admits (“Harry, please believe that I thought it was best.”).
“Not then,” Draco tells Harry shortly, because he isn’t talking about it now.  “You told me…”  He’s so tired, and Harry’s standing so far away.  “You had it in the forest, at the close.”  Ten years ago, it must be, nearly.  “You were, for one phenomenally stupid moment of your phenomenally stupid life, the very real Master of Death.”  With the help of one blatant act of thievery, he doesn’t add.  But he includes the part which Harry’s never told him.  “You used the resurrection stone.  On your father, I presume.”
There between them on the beach, the ink crawls to fill the parchment with detail.  The runes at the edges of the island disappear.
The air inside the BMW is prickling with uncertainty, and Harry feels terrified, for a moment, that it’s going to be like this all week, and that’ll be that, because of him.  Three months instead of a week.  It won’t be a surprise.
The evening fizzled out from this moment on.  Granger was still huffing when she and her boyfriend left to disapparate, and he was scowling too.  Draco didn’t know what to say to Harry, even as they left the pub together, stopping off by the loos so that Harry could take a piss.
and one of the healers makes a face, as though surprised when the wand in her hand responds to her voice.
Again, then, eventually, his stomach turns and he sits down on the blue sofa no one ever uses and shakes, his lungs heaving with it, and he’s not sure he knows how to stop.
he adds.
“Is this what you’re wearing?” Draco comments on the outfit, quick.  “Everyone’s coming to lunch.”
“James, you need to start making sense now,” Lily eventually says, a warning.  She clutches her dressing gown closed at her neck.
There’s a knock on the wall, then, inside the doorframe, and it’s James.  Apparently he can move silently, and it’s annoying, because that’s something Harry knows how to do.
It sounded grim, if Draco was being honest.  He’d bought Granger a watch as a birthday present this year, which was a little forward, even if it had been partly a joke about her research specialism.  She’d never been given one at seventeen, and he’d found out a few months before.  Hearing all this, he was rather glad that he’d bothered.
It’s terrible, Harry knows, to make up lies about his children to protect himself.  But then, Harry realises even as he says this, Lily’s held the opinion since age ten that her mum’s best friend Luna (her own middle namesake) must be the most fabulous, most funniest, most beautiful person in the world – much more beautiful than Victoire, Teddy, obviously…
“Fuck off,” he barks, his voice brighter, rounder and deeper than that which Draco continues to expect from his mouth.  The swearing’s not right either.  Easy money, easy life, even if it was all cut short.  Private tutors before school; penmanship and elocution.  That’s what James Potter sounds like: Draco’s childhood.  “We’re busy.  Can’t you –”
“Are you going to stand up and explain yourself?” Harry’s dad commands, his voice building, powerful, his hands in fists.  “And
“Morning, Rosmerta.”
he sounds, but he can’t control it.  He can’t remember, on all of Kreacher’s wine, exactly how it is that he’s supposed to speak.  Harry doesn’t look like he hates him, not here, and Draco –  “You were a child when your godfather was alive.  You think that the man can’t tell that you find him deficient?  Imagine if Teddy said that you had to make him feel like Ron.”
“Aren’t you all?” Draco asks, prodding.
These stupid names; all this nonsense –
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry dismissed, swallowing and looking away, at the threads of the rug.  “What’re you getting all smart for?” he came up with, grinning, which was easy.  “Are you coming with me to Teddy’s?” he asked, because it was Saturday.  “Sirius is coming.  Auntie Dromeda told me that if he came back…  Moony’s dithering.”  Harry wasn’t impressed by this, but he didn’t plan on saying anything – it wasn’t as though he could tell Lupin how to father his own son.  “I imagine that we’ll be on the Xbox.”
“They do this,” Draco’s saying seriously, never saying who.  His expression is telling Harry that he isn’t joking at all.
“Is that the case?”  Potter, unamused.  “How peculiar, because I feel very much alive.”
Lupin, in so many terms, to cut himself off, but –
”  Harry’s glaring at the man, who hasn’t moved.  “
Slipping from his arms, Draco’s slouchy and petulant and Harry wants him spreadeagling into the sheets, self-indulgent.  For now, he’s pulling himself out of his shorts.  “It is a measure of our desire,” he suggests loftily, on his back and nearly over the edge of the mattress.
”  This version of him sounds pathetic.  “
He has to unwrap the broom.  He realises this, the moment that he recognises the emotion in his chest.  Fear is the one thing that he knows he can’t run from.  It only ever comes with.
Did you like it, Harry?  Did you want to fuck her, the way that you fuck me?
Potter, Draco thought, not quite able to speak.
“Oh, Malfoy, I didn’t…”  Harry’s pleading with him, but it’s not clear what for.  “I’m pretty sure that cursing you cured me of that feeling, yeah?” he suggests.  “At least the hateful parts of it,” he fails to explain.  “Let’s leave it in the past,” he concludes.
“I never really met either of them,” Ron says with a shrug.  Draco recalls Harry’s complaints about Ron making time for James Potter’s chitchat.  The pair do seem to be on friendly terms.
He’s on his second glass of the sweet fizzy stuff.  He and McGonagall haven’t yet made it to the food.  He’s grateful, Harry supposes, that she’s sticking to his side instead of leaving him for whatever it is that smells nice, but he suspects that she’s here to protect everyone else, rather than Harry himself.
“I doubt it’s changed,” Lupin is saying, entirely reasonable as he takes hold of James Potter’s attention.  “Not between before and now.”
“I,” Lily Potter interrupts, holding up a hand and looking around the room, “will be back in five –”  She tuts.  “Oh Harryowl…” she interrupts herself, softening as she looks at her son.
This leaves Draco and Harry on the sofa, with James Potter on the matching armchair, the back of which faces the bay window and the doorway into the hall.  Draco doesn’t like sitting down and his muscles itch with it, even as he finds himself slumping low and letting his head loll back.
A little startled by this, as his heart rate settles down, it strikes Harry that Malfoy’s not aflutter.  He comes to these matches on his own, and he sits with no one to talk to.  They’ve shared nods.  He’s not one of the popular Slytherin dads, which Harry found surprising the first time he grit his teeth and went to the pub with them.  Instead, Malfoy’s tolerated, because he has a Slytherin child and that’s the requirement – it’s the same with the other dads and Harry.  The old guard dislike Malfoy for selling them out after the war, though none of them say that it’s that.  The new guard dislike him for all the torturing he did.
“I’m aware,” Draco answers, eyes blue, as though he finds the fact amusing.
Swallowing, Harry doesn’t need to listen as Dumbledore explains everything that happened to his parents, to Sirius and Wormtail.  It seems to take forever, and Harry wants to correct the mistakes.
“The boot was disintegrated,” Draco admits, conceding the mistake that he should have realised at the time.  He glances at Granger, who’s frowning, and he supposes that she would have caught it.  “Cocked up the disapparition.”
“Let me get changed,” Hermione allows, her mouth twitching even as she’s rolling her eyes.
“It was after the Yule Ball,” answered Pansy archly, unashamed, baby-free until midnight, when she was due home.  She addressed the group too.  “In case anyone has failed to realise, my date was very, very gay.  For
“Yes, I suppose it did,” their victim agreed.
“When are you telling the other three?” is what Teddy asks, as though Harry’s being ridiculous and needs to be brought down from the clouds.  “Albus?”
“Cheers,” Harry says, not clinking their glasses.  He sips.
And Luna’s had three wands in her life, Harry knows.  Her first wand, of ebony, was taken from her and snapped.  Her second, Ollivander made with the best wood he could find near Shell Cottage, which ended up coming from one of Fleur’s rose trees.  The core came from one of the Prewett twins’ wands, which Bill had used at Hogwarts.
“Yes you are,” Draco tells him, contrary, his fingers sending shivers down Harry’s spine.  “Shush.”
“Ready to go?” Harry asks.
Mrs Figg has her head ducked, as though she wishes that she’d taken this call in the kitchen.
Harry interrupts him.  “Albus Severus, be quiet,” he says, hearing violence in his voice.  It’s all he’s ever managed, this audible violence, but his son goes bright red and shuts up.
” Teddy pleads, running late like Harry always does.
“I told you that I don’t want Harry knowing,” he says, and he did, when he made their appointment.
“But I hate her and I hate Moony for shacking up with her and would it have been so hard for him to sleep with nothing but my
“I understood that the third brother had a family –”
“Scorpius has been talking to Albus,” Harry carries on, refusing to let himself be distracted, “and now Albus is being off with me.”
Now, Harry’s not certain what this means, but he thinks the idea is that Voldemort didn’t want his people killing each other, nor their children in the castle.  If any of them were to be punished with the Killing Curse, he did it himself, as a power move.
Harry’s had quite a lot of wine by this point, and two of Kreacher’s drinks that he knew when he picked them were alcopops.  “Couldn’t you just…”  He screws up his nose, making a vague wanking gesture in the air.
“That’ll do, Mopsy,” Draco lets her off the hook, his nod sharp.
Quickly, Harry climbs to his feet and he turns, dashing up and out of sight, socks on the stair runner.
There’s a bathroom and a bedroom off this living space.  The bathroom is heavy pipes and a claw-foot enamel bath, which Harry’s set up to stream bubbles that smell like seaweed and sunshine.  The bedroom houses a bed which is much like the one he spent six of seven years in, maroon with four posts and curtains, just as Godric would have wanted.
Potter’s tea is still resting on the table, and he’s a bastard as he looks at Ron.  “I would have thought it an auror’s duty to take full account of the evidence, at least before reaching such a demonstrably flawed conclusion…”  He’s cocky as fuck, and he’s still stolen Harry’s best grin.
Chiding himself, he looks down at his empty pint on the table, the prompt for him checking the time.  Malfoy’s glass is empty to its last swallow too, its streaks of foam looking sad.  The last two other dads have just left.
, Harry; you can express your sexuality, whatever it is.”  She nodded at him, frowning and kind.  “You should feel comfortable with it; we’re us.”
He’s not sure where these thoughts have come from.  They would have disgusted him ten years ago.
that to me,” snaps James Fucking Potter, or whatever the F stands for.  He strides forward and slams a hand on the tableclothed table, making Hermione jump, no matter that she’s just done the same.  Harry’s heart skips, but he doesn’t react.  “For fuck’s sake –” James begins, but he doesn’t seem to know how to finish.  He sounds oddly hopeless.  He sounds – different.
Teddy’s hair is honey blond for the moment, as though he’s trying something new.  His amber eyes are sarcastic as ever.  “You’re stepping out together on the broadwalk, Daddy-o,” he mocks, hustling his shoulders, his smirk brightening under his cowlick.
“We left school five years before you four,” Gary reflects before correcting for Wormtail.  “You three.”  Harry’s dad waves him off.  “It feels like we left to a different world.”
Harry Potter himself said nothing, now, for a little while.  He fidgeted, and the heat of him was closer.  Draco couldn’t bear to look at him.
“Oh.  Er.  No,” Harry manages, tipping back his glass and pretending that he cares about every last sugary drop.  A tray hovers to his side, right on cue, and he swaps this second empty glass for one full.
And Harry does miss Malfoy.  He always misses Malfoy, and they’ve just spent the week in each other’s pockets (“We can stay another night if you like, but you realise that you’ll have to get off me, so that I can use the Fone?”).  “I think he’s up to something,” Harry says, for the joke, ignoring the fact that Ron never used to call it pining.
“It sounds like he was much less of a cad,” James agrees.
Luna nodded, her eyes a bright blue.  “The truth will set you free,” she said, her fingers soft.  “I’m so, so sorry,” she added, as if she’d really fucked up.
Right now, Harry thinks that his eldest child might well be snogging his girlfriend in the sunny garden, because it’s gone quiet.  He’s tightening lids on jars and can hear the dull squeak of the glass.  Petra will be staying overnight, because she and Teddy are both twenty-three, not seventeen, and Harry was married by the age of twenty-three.  It’s an arbitrary rule.
“First period’s in five,” her brother says, still an authority, four years older than her.  “You need your books.”
The kids don’t come home for Christmas.
It’s not clear to Harry that the logic of this follows, but he lets it stand anyway.
“Astoria’s not dead,” Malfoy goes on, looking back.  “That is simply what’s said in certain circles when an English pureblood witch runs off with a foreign lothario.”  He’s joking, oddly private about it.  “Leo’s Austrian or German – Swiss, I forget.”  This is Harry’s son’s best friend’s dad; they’re talking about his stepdad and mum.  “They have a villa in Spain.  Scorpius visits in the summer.”
Draco glances at Lupin, who’s looking back seriously, his jaw tense.  Wonderful.
“Stop fussing, Draco Malfoy.”  Harry said it as if none of this meant anything.  He smacked a fraternal kiss to his cheek.  “You look shattered; we’ll talk in the morning.  Nighty night now,” he added, waving his holly wand up to the ceiling to pitch them both into darkness, pulling his glasses from his ears by the feel of it and throwing them somewhere with his stick.  “Mm,” he finished, burrowing down.
It’s – somewhat easier to watch them through a window.
“And he’s single,” Harry agrees.  “Bit of luck, innit?”  He grins.
This had all led to another drink and a conversation about hats, which made a change from people
It was the first time that Harry’d ever considered Draco Malfoy’s innocence, that day.  It was the middle of July, not long after Harry had held him while he’d not cried for his parents, still a couple of weeks before he’d hold him while he did.
It makes no sense; it’s all nonsense.  What is this world in which James Potter and Harry’s mum talk to the press and are friends with Lee Jordan and answer letters from all the weird fans and do interviews for
She wasn’t impressed.  Apparently she didn’t like this vision of herself as an escape hatch.  “Won-Won once went out with Lavender Brown,” Granger told Draco, cruelly but hilariously.  “He tries to pretend that it was an attempt to suppress his feelings for me.
“He’s not moved in,” Harry says, meeting his daughter’s mocking eyes in the mirror.  There’s nothing else he can say that’s not damning.
“He thinks that he should hide and you think that you should help him,” Black maintains, glancing at James Potter as though to check that they’re still in agreement.  Of course they are.  “But at some point we all have to move on from our
“I have to go –”  Harry’s not sure what else to say.  He feels jittery, the more he takes in all the stuff on the bed, on the floor.  It’s pathetic, piles and piles of nonsense.
“It cannot be more than a single short chapter,” Draco clarifies, though he can feel the tingle of something in his chest.  “The first premise is controversial.”
Now Harry groans, because it’s like he’s being kneaded with pleasure and with heat, transformed into bread from nothing but dust, and he’s never been someone who’s had flesh to knead.  The middle of him is on fire, it’s on fire, and he’s not sure –
Draco snorts, kissing him to distraction, and Harry’s crunching robes across Draco’s back.  Smelling like sweet booze and heady cologne, always too aware of what he’s doing, Draco reaches between them and makes Harry jump – claws the thigh which has feeling and finds ways with his fingers, here in the light.  “I can sleep in your bed,” he says, low, his other arm crowding Harry’s head on the wall.
.  But he has to keep active; it maintains the magic in his leg.
James Potter is asleep, or at least performing a decent approximation of the state, straight-backed like a corpse.
“So?” Harry asks.
It was a pointless command and an unfriendly question, but it was all kindly meant.  The problem was, how could there ever be an answer?  There was something curdling in Draco’s chest, warm desire rising beneath it, and all his feelings together were nothing more than a mess.
Neville started, his eyes drawn from Ginny, and he shrank into himself.
Harry hasn’t been back here in eleven years.  He’s not surprised that everything looks exactly the same.  It feels odd to be standing here with Draco, almost as if he’s in another pensieve and all of this is a memory.  He doesn’t let go of his hand, because that’s a better feeling than it could be.  He has a desperate urge to hide him: if any of the curtain-twitchers see him with Harry, there’s no way that they won’t know.
The gesture makes Harry grin, because it’s a gesture of affection.  “I think that we should have a party,” he explains, frowning seriously to make clear that this is a most considered plan.  “I’ve been slacking on this thing where I’m Hermione’s first mate.  You did the ring; it’s about time that I did my bit.”
is a word that was made to describe Sirius Black.
“What?” Sirius himself demanded, still holding a spoon.
Draco hasn’t thought about it, in all the years that he’s been familiar with number 12, Grimmauld Place.  There was never any reason to expand rooms or land at the Manor.  “It would be nice to have space somewhere for a proper match.”  He and Harry have spoken a couple of times about getting the snitch out, but the garden of number 12, Grimmauld Place is too small for that to be any fun.
” she squeals at Potter and Black nonsensically, maintaining an astonishing level of dignity as she whips her hands to shoo them out –
He and Black both take a moment to breathe when it’s clear that the eyelets are gone, before Draco tells Black redundantly that he’s going to the Nowhere Room.
She comes out while Harry is finishing directing the two blokes from room service where to put all the cake and sandwiches and scones.  There was a long spiel about the different sandwiches, which Harry has promptly forgotten.  They said something about rosewater and lychees for one of the cakes and all sorts of things about the tea.  It’s led Harry to the conclusion, as usual, that being posh is confusing, but he’s split the delivery between the coffee table and the dining table in the corner, because he can’t imagine that they’ll all sit down together, and it’s the sort of thing that Kreacher would do.
Lupin has turned from the window to face her, his grin not meeting his eyes.
It makes his dad grin, a quick sound of laughter down his nose before he ducks his head.
Harry bites down on his teeth, before finishing his sandwich.  It’s true that Ginny’s become Ginny Núñez, but Puds U have kept her as Weasley on all the new season’s material.
“He did use to tell her that,” says Harry, even-handed and suburban, looking at him through the top edge of his lenses.
They share a smile and then Pansy shakes her head to turn back to Harry.  There’s some sort of maths game being suggested as distraction.
“It’s
Draco knew this was coming, so Harry focuses on that, because it’s
The man’s eyes burn as he steps forward.  “Dumbledore –” he begins.
“She says that you’re working on
Ron was frowning now.  “He doesn’t need another drink,” he said clearly, plucking Harry’s glass out of his wet hand.  “He needs a big glass of water.”
Since the age of seven, if not younger, James has been reporting on Lily’s emotions as a way to talk about his own.  They used to think that he’d grow out of it.  “There’s always rumours,” is what Harry says, sitting on the bed in Ron and Hermione’s spare room.  It’s time that he went home to number 12, he tells himself, before that rumour starts spreading too.  “What have I told you?”
Something lurches in Harry’s chest, too desperate, just as Mrs Figg’s expression softens, relenting.
“What’s that in there?” Harry asks James, shaking himself, holding his own vial of white smoke.
Harry breathes, but all he breathes is this smell, and he feels hot and sick.
And there’s a chance, Harry’s sure of it, that even in their own world Snape could have made a difference in the light instead of in the darkness.
“I’ve had enough of this stupid fucking day and now
By Monday, the next morning, Harry’s forgotten about his transfigured button – but then he wakes to the sound of his dad clattering up and down stairs.  He’ll be in from a run, Harry imagines, and he’ll be about to discover Harry’s beetle in the shower.
“Why doesn’t it make sense?” someone asks.
Harry still believes in the DMLE, just about.  He’s not sure if there’s an alternative.
Harry doesn’t comment on this.  “So we’re not dating, then,” is what he says, sounding bitter.  “Because I’m fine with that,” he insists, entirely passive aggressive.
It’s still raining.  But here they are, Draco thinks, blinking in the rain, him looking at Harry, the both of them muddied and surrounded by bluebells.  Relieved, for now.  Calm.  In love.  Damp.  OK.  Warm, because their hearts are racing.
.  Maybe this is surprising; maybe it’s reassuring.  Harry bets that the lessons were good.
In the end, Harry doesn’t give Draco a choice, turning over and knocking his knee into another.  A cool shin.  A bony foot.  Draco doesn’t resist: he pulls Harry’s glasses off his face – his wand from his hand, which Harry didn’t realise was still there – setting them aside on the nightstand with what sounds like a tut.
It’s true.  The brooms that Ginny has given Harry and Ron over the years are in much better shape, no matter that they’ve been put through the paces of professional use.  As a model, the original Firebolt is no longer held in high regard: the acceleration charms were too heavily applied and Harry thought that the handle was ash at the time, but really it’s ebony, and that’s much too dense to mature with heavy charms.  It’s a beautiful broom to look at, still, but Harry doesn’t know anyone who wasn’t having problems with theirs by around 2003.
,” Black tells him, forcing hair out of his eyes.  “Hermione just said it – Malfoy fixed us for you, so the least you can do is –”
On the periphery of Harry’s vision, Mrs Figg flinches, but she doesn’t interrupt.
Teddy winces.  “Maybe just be single for a bit,” he advises, unhelpfully.  He’s eyeing Harry’s crumby plate.  “Are there any other sandwiches going?” he asks innocently, as though they fall out of the sky.
The nicest bloke in the world, Neville made this ridiculous statement a joke.  “It’s funny, in’t it?” he said.  “We all know that it was Harry’s dad.”).
stop trying to analyse my relationship with Harry?”  As the words escape him Draco knows that they think that they’ve won.  Also, the name comes out much too close to Herry.
Locking eyes with him, across the room, Harry tries to sound sincere.  His heart pulls at his throat.  “There’s nothing; just stuff.”
This earns him a smirk, as well as a look up and down, as though to check he’s still got all ten fingers and toes.  “Five inferi and a poltergeist?”
“I thought that the party could be at your house…” Harry goes on.
“She’s got the notebook out,” is how he phrases it.  “Can’t decide on her favourite
The mess of the paper becomes smaller and smaller as she works it, entirely unbothered by the beans getting over her hands.  She hisses some sort of shrinking spell, but Harry has a feeling that it’s something more vicious than that, entirely unnecessary, and he’s vindicated when Hermione ends up holding a ball of what looks like wood pulp, yellow and fibrous and wet in her hands.
, Harry realises, almost
“Harry,” Sara greeted him, with a warm smile.  She didn’t stand up.  Her coat reached her ankles, and her hair was long too.  “Who’s your friend?”
“I’d have told you beforehand if I’d known that you’d be here,” Harry says, thinking back again to his speech.  “I know that you didn’t like Snape by the end –“
“Moony’s good at keeping secrets,” Harry’s dad points out.  He’s the only one without proper sunglasses; he’s tinted his normal glasses an uninteresting shade of grey-brown.  “Padfoot less so,” he apologises.
“What does he do?” Ron demands, bemused.
“Well, er…”  He didn’t lie.  Arthur looked like he wanted to laugh.  “It’s fine, yeah.”).
“It’s all right,” she promises, reaching up to hold him by the shoulders.  “Your dad’s stubborn,” she promises, her eyes green.
At this point, Harry looked at Ron, because he wanted to laugh.
“I’m not scared of you telling him anything,” says Lupin, cold, and it makes no sense, because Lupin was the one who gave out chocolate.  “There is very little that you know.”
The address was in London, but Draco didn’t know it.  There was no mention of the fellatio, but that was to be expected.  Draco rather thought that he might have dreamt it, anyway.
that they were still in contact,” Sirius defends himself, distracted.  “Not until your dad said that you’d found a letter.”  A month or less, then, Harry concludes.  “He didn’t say that you’d found a bloody trove of them,” he adds, and Harry’s not in the right frame of mind to find it funny.  He must have heard this from Ron.  “Those blank ones are not for other people’s eyes,” he says without shame, and Harry
it,” he promises.
“Really, Malfoy?”  Harry spoke first, raising his eyebrows at Draco’s state of undress.  He was loud, undoubtedly a little drunk himself.  It was always the way.  “It’s only four o’clock.”
The match is just about to start.  Scorpius flies up and shoves Albus on the shoulder, distracting him, leading him back to the cluster of Slytherin brooms.  They share a joke, private and introverted – like Harry when he’s being true to himself.
loins, James Potter, had only a minor part to play in it.”
Remus concludes, terrible to look at.
“Ah, Draco,” the man says, looking up.
“Yeah, all right,” Harry agrees, and they grin at each other.
I should’ve known that there was a secret alcove in the wall behind Sirius’s old bed,” he complains, and it’s on complete faith that Draco doesn’t take this as a non-sequitur.  “
“Well – all right.”
Black’s tone is equally callous, but there’s something else in it too – speculation.  He’s not paying mind to Lupin’s tone, at least not for now.
Draco isn’t sure where he is, what year it is, or why he can hear Harry Potter.  He’s kneeling on grass, over a set of casting stones.  His hawthorn wand is in his hand, tingling as though it’s reading something.  There are screams in his ears – muggle screams, he’s sure.  But he isn’t sixteen; he’s in his twenties.  He’s twenty-four.  It’s 2004, and the Dark Mark lurks in shadows on his arm.
“Hmpf,” James doesn’t laugh, though he sounds more amused than not.  “Yes, I can imagine it perfectly.”
says McGonagall, and Harry’s heart is beating fast.  This wasn’t…
He offers the last to his son like resentment, turning to retrieve his teacup from the mantelpiece.  He swallows what seems to be around half a measure of tea, presumably cold.
Granger apparently doesn’t know the sort of thing that Lupin and Black got up to together.  Draco isn’t about to enlighten her.  It feels good to know something she doesn’t, whenever he can, always has, because he’s –
This makes Harry snort, because wizards took up that technology fifteen years ago.  Ron’s the only one who jokes about it, after what happened.  Harry casts a few spells and finds a note, no threat of curse-magic explosives.
“He’ll have been gutted,” said Sara, with certainty.  “The last thing he needs is me or you two dragging things up for him.”  She laughed, lightly.  “He won’t even be able to see us, will he?”
In the end, for the sake of them all, Draco took an aimless stab at it.  “You think that Ron’s next mad plan is going to be to move out.”
,” Black snaps at him more harshly.  He clenches his jaw.  “This isn’t about…” Black begins, distracted, and Draco wonders whether maybe he
There’s an owl from Ginny, right at the end of the month.  It makes Harry startle, but he supposes that they should get used to communicating.  They’ll be doing it for the rest of their lives; they likely should have sussed it before.
It’s NEWT-level Charms, adding smells, so there, it’s for grown-ups.
There’s not much that Harry thinks he could pass on as advice to his young teenage self.  There’s not much that he could tell himself to do differently, in good conscience, in the end.  Mostly it’s advice about snogging Malfoy, and Harry wasn’t ready to snog anyone before the age of seventeen, maybe not even then.
“Fifteen
“I said fuck
“That’s not
Harry looks at her, and she meets his gaze with a smirk that’s only visible in her eyes, which are shadowed dark and gleaming with kohl.  Her nose is turned up like a pug’s.
“Call me Malfoy.”  There’s the tone; an arm around Harry’s waist to keep him prone, to yank him in, his other hand squeezing Harry’s feeling thigh.  “
In Harry’s head, the lighting was soft and there were sheets.  “You’ve seen – ?”  The sheets draw away and between them there’s –
Rolling his eyes, Ron nods towards upstairs.  “Hermione’s looking at weddings on the Turnynet,” he explains, and he’s brilliant, Ron, because he doesn’t mention Lupin or Sirius or Harry kicking off at all.  His question follows naturally: “Pub?”
into the veil between life and death, angling it between seven circular mirrors, to help loosen the veil’s sharp edge.  One day, the veil whispers to him with voices much louder than usual, but he doesn’t hear them clearly, because he isn’t listening.  One day, at that very moment, a man stumbles from the veil’s far side, wand aloft and power surging around him, the last echo of his own call,
for twenty years?”
“Malfoy could never’ve done what Snape did,” he says sharply to his father.  “It would’ve killed him, playing spy.”
“Yeah?” Ron replied, coming over and sounding suspicious.
, sly and proud.  “Yes, yes, that’s you, Draco Malfoy.  Mm.”
“Don’t,” Draco warns, looking away to start pulling off his outer robe, to work on the inner one’s fastenings.  “I’m not telling you anything.”  He didn’t imagine that there would be a route back this way, and it could still go horribly wrong.  “I’m conducting research; that’s all.”
Draco gives him a look when he glances up.  They both remember how Harry’s quidditch career ended, but Harry’s guilt is unnecessary.  Draco’s never cared about the few faint scars on his chest.  There’s mercy in a quick, sharp cut that the Cruciatus doesn’t know, and Harry’s always been merciful.
“Fine,” agrees Draco, because he supposes that he’ll have to.
“You should ask him,” Malfoy suggests, almost exactly Harry’s age with his hair going thin at the crown.  His widow’s peak is sharp and angular, but it suits him somehow; he looks good.  He looks comfortable in his sharp face, the high collar of his brown jumper, expensive and soft rather than stiff.  “Ask why he hates our world so much.  It’s always personal, the political.”  He says this as though it’s a joke which Harry should get.
“He’s as cute and as volatile as ever,” says Harry, proudly, always fucking fidgeting.  “George calls him a lesson in built-in obsolescence, but he’s only joking; he’s dead proud.  Always asks for updates.”
“And this is my mum and
, Harry tells himself.
Raising his hand, Harry forces his fingers to be gentle, finding the near-translucent blond stubble coming in around Draco’s jaw.  He doesn’t shave every day, because often he’s not in the mood, and his beard hair comes in slowly.  He’s been clean-shaven all of this week.
The restoration would be successful this time, at long last, but on this day in June no one knew so for certain.
“He’s saved my life twice, thrice, a dozen times,” Draco succinctly replied, narrowing his eyes and looking Dudley up and down.  “It’s not a competition,” he added as though he meant the opposite.
“You’ll have to forgive my accent,” Draco watches her say.  “But you see this symbol, with the little tail?  Well…”
Draco falls against him, and his voice is mostly a groan.  “You’re filthy,” he complains, pressing into Harry’s cheek, which is going rough with stubble.  It’s wet with the rain, still rattling down.  He forces a thigh between Harry’s legs.  “Perverted.  We’re in public, Potter.”
How had Draco forgotten?
“It has to be
“Practical,” the man says next, as number 2.  This seems more self-evident as a parameter, given that this ring is for Granger, though Draco thinks that it’s somewhat counter-intuitive as the description of an engagement ring.  “Not goblin-made.”  This is number 3.
“You were right,” Teddy says, an Essex boy again, looking over his shoulder to Draco with Harry’s best shit-eating grin.  “That was fun.”  He turns back to his father, shaking his hair to its usual curls just as Draco dispels the transfiguration on his clothes.  He’s a suburban little boy of nearly ten, in trainers, jeans, t-shirt and a hoody, with a crooked nose and a sarcastic tongue.  “Dad, your
“I didn’t think about it when I saved him,” Harry says, looking up at the ceiling, swallowing and dropping his chin.  “But that was stupid,” he says, and he knows it.  “Trelawney made a prophecy, so I knew it was important, and everything that happened afterwards…”
He’s looking into a mirror, Harry thinks, and he isn’t invisible.  He’s looking into a mirror, and everyone can see him, exactly as he is.  They can see what he’s seeing too, and most likely they can see that it’s his deepest desire.  He’s young, he’s full of innocence, and he’s surrounded by family.
“It’s difficult sometimes, to feel proud of the Office,” Harry tells Malfoy.  The Ministry group keeps getting delayed with the action plan.  The findings of the inquiry weren’t pretty; Kingsley’s called the whole thing a farce, retired these days, though Harry asks him a lot for advice – he’s been divorced since Harry was fifteen because he chose Harry and the war.  “But if we don’t believe in what we’re doing, then what are we?  We’re nothing but trained thugs.”
these things.  And Draco could – he could, that was the thing.  Harry had given him every weapon in the world to cut him to the core.  It would be
He sits down.
Mrs Figg is insisting, stepping backwards and looking out into the hallway.  Her back is straight, and Harry thinks that she might have been sorted into Gryffindor, once upon a time, if she’d been given the chance to be sorted.  She’ll be thinking clearly in this moment, and she’ll be thinking that she hasn’t asked Lupin a security question.
He’s sure that Draco can tell how much effort he’s putting in.
It was a nightmare that woke Draco from sleep.  This wasn’t a strange thing, even now, ten years after he’d joined the Dark Lord in earnest in 1996, with this the 2000s with the end of the year the same digit.  The images behind his eyelids were generic, typically – screaming and bloodshed that he couldn’t pin to a single memory.  Sometimes he heard his Aunt Bella screaming the Cruciatus, the Killing; other times it was the Dark Lord, or his father, or him.
Draco wasn’t listening.  Not really.  He was lying in bed, the mattress pressing high on his back while he stared up at the ceiling, just like any other Tuesday.  Harry had his knees wedged to box him in, holding Draco’s foot to his jaw while the fingers of his other hand worked into places that Draco didn’t like to think about.  The smooth, stroking, pushing violent touch of them was good; made his heart flutter; made his hips jump; made him writhe and kick because
The myth of Veyra is one that Draco already knows, but it’s soothing to hear it told in Harry’s voice.
“They were dark times,” Lily says, with another wry grin.  “School was dark too, looking back.  I’m not sure us girls…  You needed your mates.”  She rallies, looking at him.  “Don’t know what it was like for you four, but in our day none of the teachers were interested.  Dumblydore was always on the continent or down at the Ministry.  Slughorn, head of the snakes,” she adds unnecessarily, “he was useless.  Never punished anyone, no matter how evil…”  She tuts, shaking her head.  “Sorry, love, I know that it’s your house.”
It’s the night before Harry goes back to Hogwarts, the thirty-first of August, a Sunday.  He’s just been to see Mrs Figg, and he thinks that he’s in a good place, for term to start again (“How you’ve grown!”).
Besides, he’s spent all week not letting himself have pudding, because it makes him think of Puff, which makes him think of Draco.  Harry’s been trying to convince himself that there’s no difference between living with an insomniac occlumens and living with a temperamental, pompom-breathing soft toy, but it’s not been going well.
The sound of this voice makes Harry’s insides shrivel tight.  He glances at James, who is looking at the handset, surprised, and Harry thinks that he recognises the voice as well as Harry does.
Draco snickers wickedly on Harry’s left, which makes Hermione sit up even straighter and scoff, throwing him a challenging glance before she leans into Ron and murmurs something in his ear, her hand on his leg, and –
It doesn’t even matter, Harry thinks.  Lupin’s not their teacher anymore, and they’re none of them thirteen.
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry tells him, waiting for the elf’s nod before he draws his head back into the office.  “Thanks for nothing,” he mutters when he’s alone, because it’s a burn in his chest, his own lack of trust.
Being called a baby owl in fact makes Harry laugh, his eyes bright, innocent, his whole self off-kilter from the version Draco knows.  “What?” he manages, perplexed, southern.
“And Hermione doesn’t
“And now… He’s not coming back, is he?” Lupin says finally, staring at Draco with his mouth flat.  “When he escaped…  I had to be there at Hogwarts, if only to witness it.”  He says it so lightly, like a summer breeze.  “Then he fell, and we all said that it was an accident.”  The man taps his fingers to Draco’s thesis again.  “But there are no accidents, you’re saying.  Death makes them a choice that one was going to make all along.”
“Sod it,” Harry says, putting the full of his arm around Draco’s shoulders, strong and warm, pulling him close as he cradles the back of Draco’s head.  “There’s no point talking to you when you’re like this.  Don’t tell Hermione, all right?”
“Everything changes,” Harry dismisses.
“Oh yes,” Draco says, a twitch of his fingers on the map in Harry’s peripheral vision.  “Turn left.”
“Likewise,” Harry agrees, shaking his hand.  He doesn’t bother to offer his own name, because everyone’s just said it and to repeat it would sound egotistical.  “Congratulations on the league,” he adds, sounding awkward and British.  The Falmouth Falcons won this year, he’s heard somewhere, and Ginny’s fiancé plays for the team.
As he twitches in the light, Harry sees that it’s his right leg that’s scarred, so Draco’s left hand is holding it down – his fingers firm and knuckled, thin muscles taut through his wrist to his elbow to his shoulder.  Harry’s leg is strong, and Harry sees a glimpse of an old tattoo on the soft insides of Draco’s arm.  He finds his tears coming sharper, to see that beautiful limb ruined too.
Pansy’s curvy figure isn’t Harry’s type, if it could be said that he has one, but she’s frowning down lovingly at a baby – whose hair is black, to make it worse – when not five minutes ago she was being scathing and rude.  It’s the contradiction, he thinks, that he finds himself flustered by.
“They’re all fuckers,” Harry finds himself snapping as they stride towards the floos, shoes on marble, lights above them, much of the echoing crowd drifting in a similar direction now it’s late.  “You wait till I’m Head Auror.”
,” Granger tries to intercede from Ron’s side, presumably for the use of
He means the divorce, Harry assumes, but in any case – and not for the first time – Harry wonders whether Hogwarts employs a counsellor these day or if he hasn’t vastly underestimated James.
“I know,” replies Harry.  He’s not sure how to explain.  It felt straightforward in the moment to save Malfoy and Goyle and get the diadem anyway, but he wonders, sometimes, what he’d have done if there’d been a starker choice.  He imagines Malfoy and Goyle on a pile of broken furniture, the diadem glinting on another far away, Ron and Hermione not there and the fire bearing down.  He’s certain that he knows what he’d do, at seventeen.  He’s a seeker, and in his mind’s eye he can see the diadem glint.
The countryside is lovely, Harry thinks, even if it’s mostly mud, for January, and the sky is grey.  They’re under overhanging trees now, all branches.  Last week, when they were out in the morning, the ground glittered with frost and the sun shined white-gold through the mist.  “I’m doing what I’ve always wanted to do!” he protests, though he has no plans to get a motorbike.  That was Sirius’s thing.  “The time is now.  Maybe I’ll run a delivery service.”  For his jam, he means.  And for his beer.
Harry’s not sure if this is better.  “It’s important!” he complains, trying to get them back on track, trying not to say it so loudly that Rose and Hugo overhear.  “A gay man fancied me.”
“Well,” Draco began, because that was always a question too.
Draco’s suspicious, but he asks the question anyway.  “Who?”
“The point is –”
,” Harry insists, contradicting himself, put off by Draco’s chic muggle clothing, his short-sleeved shirt not even black, but forest green.  He’s been smelling like sun cream all week, because there’s no ointment against UV, only the muggle stuff, conjured, copied from the bottle.  Harry came up with a way to get it slathered on neatly and never mark any clothes.  It’s been giving Draco a cockstand every morning (“I’m not going to
want.”
"Stop that!" he said, slamming the kettle down on the stove.
“That feels amazing,” Draco sighed. “Every pregnant person should have a Potter to massage their achey feet. It should be law.”
—that was the prerogative of the pregnant—but really, he loved it. He loved it so much. This thing growing inside him. This tiny witch or wizard that he would love and protect for its entire life. And more than anything, this feeling, this knowledge that he wouldn’t ever be alone.
“Nevermind. It was— No, It’s prying.”
He couldn't quite believe what had transpired. He'd been minding his own bloody business, giving a perfectly routine massage—granted the customer had a very fit body, but that wasn't completely out of the ordinary—and then not only was the man gorgeous, he was arrestingly adorable when he had to admit his
why Potter was not prioritising mowing his lawn and making his garden look more presentable. All Draco needed to do was explain more about the contest. Potter would understand and get to work prettying up his garden.
“Maybe if I hold the wand
“Who’s this chap, then?” Draco asked the three-year-old.
"OK. Er, Harry, just... it's the
Draco had been allowing others to go before him, ostensibly being magnanimous, though in actuality just stalling for time. Just before it came to his turn, he excused himself to use the loo.
"Alright then, Scarhead, but don't say I didn't warn you."
Granger buzzed through, but before the matron had time to get there, Harry's eyes were fluttering open. They both squeezed his hands on either side.
When baby James was just five months old, Draco made James a Winnie the Pooh costume because Teddy wanted to be Tigger. They were utterly adorable. And how Christopher Robin (Draco) and Tigger would have loved Harry to join in too, but Harry left the house at 11 am as always, and Draco was left to explain (again) to a six-year-old Teddy why Daddy had to go. And then Draco had to go into another room and close his eyes tight for a bit when Teddy said Harry would have been perfect as Eeyore with his sad face.
And he
Draco picked up his wand and flicked it towards a small stereo on the chest of drawers by his bed. Music started up instantly, a female vocal, '
“And forgive me," Granger went on, "but I’ve completely glossed over the fact that you are having a child of your own very soon. Congratulations, Malfoy... Draco. I really am so pleased for you both.”
as if he was happy to see him so that Draco would feel safe and unintentionally slip up. Then he would have a genuine reason for writing a bad review and ruining Draco’s career.
be trusted with reviewing food, considering I think Chinese takeaway is the highest form of culinary excellence.”
She had come to that realisation all by herself, of course. And it had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the teapot in question reappearing in her kitchen later that same day with a wizened old house-elf in tow. A wizened old

"A situation." The tinny strains of '
“S'okay.”
"My wand?! How did you know about… Did you find it?"
Blaise doesn't even seem surprised when Draco approaches him after that crippling defeat. But Draco can't possibly face Potter after letting him down so badly. It's been a wild year, one of mixed feelings; hope, pain, and what he'd thought might be love.
"Yes,
And that's when Harry and Draco retreated to the living room and let their prized sentient objects cool down, the idea of a cup of tea all but forgotten.
Draco hummed. "I'll admit I'm a little curious too. About what brings you here all alone. Though I'm not rude enough to bluntly ask, unlike someone I could mention."
Of course, things got worse before they got better for Draco. The trials took it out of him, having to revisit every bad choice he'd made and shitty thing he'd done, knowing he could never make it up to everyone he'd hurt, even if he had ten lifetimes in which to do it. And though he knew it was
And sure enough, the mist surrounding Harry’s bump had turned a calm blue-green and was barely moving any more.
If looks could kill, Potter would be long dead from the glare Draco was directing at him. “It’s a Tidy
If you hadn’t kept on, and kept on... Strict. Severe. Unmoved by entreaty. But so patient.
Draco sighed. “I know why you’re telling me this.”
Draco panicked. He shouldn't have asked, he thought, it was too intrusive, and Potter was clearly trying to keep things hush hush.
"What? I was just kidding. Can’t you take a joke?"
“That’s Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy,” said Sam. “Of course they’ve met before. They were in school together, always fighting about something.”
"Trista was a filthy monster!" the Magister shoots back, red-faced. "She infected Goodsister Joanna's mind. Before Joanna, she'd influenced poor Goodsister Hazel, who decided to abandon her vows and leave the coven. We lost her, and it was all Trista's fault. I decided to forgive her, but within a year she was making eyes at Joanna. And Joanna has a weak mind at the best of times. They both deserve everything they got."
“Or times of great distress at having been cruelly insulted,” Harry chided.
It was several moments before Potter calmed himself down enough to talk, but he was still grinning from ear to ear. “So,
Merlin, this was bizarre.

"Very well then," he said.
Potter steps forward, his wand trained on Placid. "Nothing funny now, Placid," he says with a hint of a smile, though the underlying meaning is abundantly clear.
Potter rolled his eyes, not seeming to care that he was crushing Draco’s dream of a winning streak. “I don’t eat meat, so they can keep the hamper,” he said. “And I’m far too busy with work to be landscaping my 'frontage'." He elbowed Draco in the ribcage. "Look on the bright side. This way you’ll give the other streets a chance to win.”
. That had certainly been missing the last few days.
So, at class on Friday, Draco made sure to sit as far away as possible from Potter. And, at the break, he bolted to the hospital cafeteria and made do with their selection of snacks and beverages which, actually, were preferable to Fordus’s idea of refreshments—Draco quite enjoyed his Galaxy bar and can of 7UP, though it made the baby wriggle about inside him rather a lot.
Draco awoke to the sound of rattling and hissing.
“Yeah, sorry,” Potter grimaced. “I’m just surprised. You, up the duff, it just seems…”
Potter had frowned then, dropped Draco's arm gently and taken a big slurp of his orange juice. Draco stared at him expecting him to say something, but Potter seemed wholly unbothered.

Mrs Potts sat quietly on the counter-top nearby, tea leaves in place and lid sitting by her side. Harry lifted the kettle to fill it with water only to be shrieked at.
She laughs.
.  This was the dream that he always lived for, the way that Harry always lived for his dad, and – and he thinks that he knows exactly how Harry feels, looking the man in the face, because it
“Scorpius’s dad told Scorpius that he’s been going to pub with you,” is what Albus says, his green eyes sharp, the background behind him Slytherin green.
away with an air of sublime disinterest.  He’s terrified of meeting Teddy, Draco can guess.  “Ask your son if he can still feint as well as he used to.”
Jaw tightening, James looks away – his eyes flash, as though he’s keeping something back.
“Who says that I’ll be acting indifferent?” Harry asked him, though he wasn’t sure that he could promise anything.
The man appeared at the foot of the bed, stumbling like a drunk.  The light flashed back to the centre of the ceiling, filling the room.  Wand under his pillow, Draco scrambled for the shorts that he’d thrown off from the day because, well, it was hot, it was midsummer, this was his flat and he was perfectly entitled to sleep without clothes if he –
But Draco ignores him, accepting the bob of Kreacher’s head with a feeling somewhat like satisfaction.
At this point in the summer, Harry didn’t know what his dad was talking about – but he also wasn’t going to remember this conversation’s specifics, so that doesn’t matter.
She has red hair, this woman, and for a moment Draco thinks that she’s Ginny Weasley.  But of course she isn’t.  Her hair is darker, heavier as it swoops over her shoulders – less attractive than Ginny Weasley’s, to be honest.  She’s wearing a knitted jumper with square shoulders in some sort of cream wool like a lamb’s above high-waisted trousers that run straight before tapering to her ankles.  On her feet she’s wearing loafers.
The man is a rake, Draco thinks.
Nonetheless, Teddy goes red.  “Sorry, Harry,” he says.  “Thank you for my broom and my bike.”  And Harry ruffles his hair with forgiveness.
With a rush of blood to his face, Harry steps away from him and looks down, silenced by the thought of it.
Before they can make it, however, there’s a sound of indignation from one Lily Potter.  “James!” she shouts over the sound of Granger’s laugh.  The man whips his head towards her.  “Did you know that Moony has a
They were the only ones here, but none of that mattered.  Draco turned on the paving stones and shoved both of his hands into the wilds of Harry Potter’s hair, kissing him until they both surely saw only darkness.  It had been over a month, after all, and he still didn’t know how to live.  Fuck it all, indeed.
“I’m sure he’ll live,” Lupin says passingly, clapping Draco on the back, both of them covered in blood.
“Well, that only makes it more important,” Harry tells him shortly, het up, suddenly feeling like he could take some very fucking radical action before the night is through.  He scratches up the back of his short hair.
Draco goes for broke.
“Ugh,” James responds with disgust, before Harry can make sense of what this means, his stomach turning over.
It’s March.  “Right,” Draco says, out loud this time.
Breathing, Harry’s not thinking.  “Look, you’re lost.  This’ll show you to the mountains,” Harry insists, and he whips his wand to cast a stag of his own.
This is a joke about how much Harry’s been going on about his Fortnum’s jam, Harry realises when he googles what and where the Wolseley is.
,” he snaps witheringly, at last.  Harry breathes out.  “It doesn’t make you sound clever, it doesn’t make you sound cool, and it doesn’t make you sound transgressive.”
The only answer he gets is pair of rolled eyes.  “I’m annoyed that those fuckers ripped you off,” comes a strange sort of admission, Malfoy’s expression like there’s been a bad smell.  “You shouldn’t be embarrassed,” he says, despite contradicting this every time they talk.
They might even see the phoenix, Harry thinks, though it’s very unlikely.  He could at least see Draco in the sun again. “Luna will whittle,” he goes on, “and we’ll watch that; it’ll be educational.  And then we’ll watch her set the core and finish off.  The varnishing takes ages,” he adds just in case Moony doesn’t know.  “But Teddy’ll have a wand in time for Christmas.”
Draco snorts.
She continues, “But he means well, I promise you.”
“Yes, Harry,” Moony says solidly, and it’s as though they’re finally friends.  “Because Snape was a twat.”
“…and this one really belongs to a dowager duchess who drinks too much sherry and has a spoilt, irritating dog named Bathsheba.”
“There we are,” McGonagall concludes, unreadable.  It was because of the Bardley fiasco that McGonagall offered Harry a job.
“Mm,” says Harry’s dad, narrowing his eyes as though calculating the trade-off between pushing it and being told off at home.
“I bought him these,” Harry tells Mopsy, only glancing up when Draco looks at him.  “Thank you for telling me the right size.”  Mopsy made him cucumber sandwiches, that day.
“I might buy him a motorbike,” Harry confesses in his Barbour, no scarf.  It comes out of him in a rush.  “Maybe a scooter, so that I can threaten him with destitution and needing to join Deliveroo.”  He’s not sure how to explain; he wouldn’t have explained, if Draco hadn’t asked.  He tries to keep it in.  He didn’t see Teddy for his birthday last year and it nags at him, what Teddy must think.  “He’s been such a good housepet and badgerly Potterpin; I couldn’t have done it without him…”
he spits, as though he should have seen it coming.
Oh, Harry thinks.
Oh no, he thinks, his stomach twisting over itself.  No, that’s not true at all.  Because magic is real and they’re
With a show of reluctance, Harry changes the mark, which means nothing, but doesn’t give her points, which means a lot.  The Slytherin prefects keep track of who’s lost and gained points, to determine the picking order for everything ever managed in Gryffindor by first-come-first-served.  Harry thinks that it’ll give the girl something to think about, when she realises that she’s been done.
“What’s a zero-sum game?” Harry finds himself asking Ron while the others carry on.  Draco never says much, but he’s always listening, which is distractingly attractive.  Harry’s hand ends up on his knee.
His supervisor was Vespers Avalorne, Head of Department and every other honorific, famous most of all for her work on memory.  She liked the project not least because it wound up other departments of the Ministry.  Draco liked the project because he found it somehow therapeutic, sieving his thoughts until the details meant more than the whole.
“Of course I'm not doing that,” Harry tells her flat, wishing he had a drink.  He glances over his shoulder to get a measure of the seething crowd.  There are no journalists that he can see.  “I wrote all that ages ago – and I’m not…”  He’s not that sophisticated.  The speech was supposed to have been ring composition, going back to what he’d said at the end of it all.
“James is ruder about Slytherin all the time!”
“Harry Potter!” another voice calls out, which Harry doesn’t recognise.  He shakes the witch’s hand anyway, smiling again – a different smile.  McGonagall’s presence by his side is sharp and prickling like gorse, familiar and grounding.
It’s Lupin, sounding brisk and autumnal once more, late September.
Oh Lupin, Draco thinks.
Sara and Amy weren’t the last of the Death Eaters’ muggle dead to reappear, and nor were they the last to reappear in Wiltshire.  Location mattered sometimes, well enough.  Sometimes it indicated the actions of a man who couldn’t apparate very far anymore, because the Cruciatus had given him a dicky heart.
With a gentle, enraptured smile on her face, Luna used the silence to begin tickling this particular chosen birch tree with her branch, wafting it up the tree’s split white bark and towards its own lower branches.
“It’s good to see everyone again,” Lupin begins with an obvious lie, lazily, breathing out.  He sets his jaw, the idea of a smirk around his mouth.  He’s spiteful, spiteful, and Draco thinks that it must be because he’s caught the man smoking.  “Whatever happened to Ginny Weasley?” he asks into the darkness, cigarette between his lips, his tone barbed.  He breathes, pulls the stick free and exhales, spits acid, all while peering down the garden.  “She was such a sweet girl.”
from a nearby beachfront bar.
“So we can people-watch,” Draco said. And then slanted his eyes sideways at Harry. "And be thankful we’re not them."
what your hideous garden is doing to me. I’m going crazy.”
Before him on the lawn, wedged between the banks of wildflowers that lined the sides of the garden, was an enormous table, piled high with what looked to be a pretty extravagant spread. One that could rival a Hogwarts weekend luncheon, he suspected. If he could only see it clearly.
"The two of us," he whispered.
Once done, Blaise offered Harry the first toke, but Harry shook his head. “Nah, mate. Thanks.” Blaise shrugged and offered it to Pansy, who closed her eyes and took a long drag and then handed it back, the end now all crimson-smudged and shiny. Harry used to enjoy a joint on occasion, but he’d stopped enjoying it lately; weed just made him paranoid now rather than chilling him out.
“It’s Cho and
His hopes skyrocketed when he saw Pansy walk out an hour and a half later with a wide smirk on her face. He knew he could count on his friend to get Potter to see reason.
“Indeed.” Draco bit into a cereal bar. It was very… oaty. He’d have much preferred a bar of Dairy Milk.

"Yes,
It was the first thing she’d ever said to Harry… like

Draco sighed in defeat and nodded. He should have known that the most well-known critic in England would not settle for just speaking to the waiters. All critics wanted to talk to the chef, and Draco knew that if he kept trying to avoid it he would look unprofessional and end up getting a bad review anyway.
Laughter.  “The
Frowning, Draco groaned as their eyes met again, sounding weary.  “You’re being irrational,” he complained as though it was a sin.
“I went to her shop on the Alley,” Pansy admits, as though this is embarrassing.  “I think she volunteered her and her
A while later, a woman sits down next to him, two feet of bench there between them, a tag of carved graffiti.  There’s a swirl of dark hair on top of her head and she’s wearing a long, crisp black coat with a deep collar of what must be fake fur.  She’s wearing pointed leather shoes and it seems to take her two seconds flat to pull a cigarette from somewhere and light it.
rather than
Harry looks at her.
Apparently Lupin was also involved in crafting Lily Potter’s ring.  Draco doesn’t point out the slip.
Between them, chairs appear, slotting into rows facing forwards but arranged to form a circle, cut with an aisle like a stone with a wand, and there’s another shape that’s missing.  There are hundreds of chairs, solid and smart, sheathed from head to toe in white velvet with a ribbon of black around their feet against the grass.  There’s an emblem in black on the back of each, and Harry recognises this as the Hogwarts crest.
There was a look on Harry’s face now, just for a moment under the London sky.  It was as though he wanted to fight it – to resist the inevitable death of what they had.  It made sense.  The man had never been able to hold onto a proper set of parents, so he lacked a full appreciation of generational responsibility.  He didn’t feel the churn of the seasons – as indicated by the fact that he was wearing short sleeves outside in what was now
This makes Harry laugh, and he thinks he sees McGonagall look at him from further down the table.
It makes his dad laugh with a titter down his nose.
The black stone ring made a dull thunk as Draco dropped it to the carpeted floor.  Then he was scratching hold of Harry Potter’s jaw and kissing him as though his life depended on it, because in that moment it really felt as though it did, always had done, and he didn’t want to die.  Not if there was an option besides doing it all on his own.
Frowning, Harry looks at Sirius, but Sirius is still wearing his sunglasses and looks like he couldn’t be ruffled if Harry tried.  He’s also looking down at the map.
Silence follows, and the door is not so closely ajar that they won’t see him if they look around, Draco knows.  He’s been eavesdropping long enough.  Really, he’s been eavesdropping too long.
,” he managed in a croak, with a wand from somewhere and a rush of magic.  The wand went away and there was a hand softly tracing Draco’s jaw, all warm fingers.  He moaned, and it sounded like yes, not at all like complaint, thank fucking Merlin.
“Draco?” Harry asked, squinting, presumably as blind from his missing glasses as he was from the night time.  “Am I still in your flat?”
” he quotes scathingly.  “They were a drag queen and a DJ who picked him up out of the gutter.  I reckon he shagged one or both of them, and fuck if they ever made him pay rent.  It was Tone’s flat, he told me –”
“Me and the Weasleys, matching jumpers, cake and a kiss when I’m thirty.”  He was in a very strange mood, Harry Potter, holding Draco’s knees.  Draco tried to tune him out.  “All those candles.  Molly’s cakes are the best.”
Lying in bed, in the heat, in the rainy cool, in the wind of the final days of August, on his own for the first time in years since Ginny was regularly on tour – Harry finds himself thinking about his job.  He wonders what it would be like to move sideways off the promotion track and into training.  Trainee aurors learn as apprentices, the trade passed on like every other wizarding profession, and Harry’s had several apprentices now.  These days, nonetheless, unlike when Harry learned from Kingsley, there’s also a central programme director, who’s currently a witch in her sixties named Cordelia Rosewater.  Harry wonders if the next one could be him.
It’s not clear why this is offensive, although Draco is naturally appalled.
Moony is walking with Sirius, lagging behind, and there’s the sound of Sirius snickering as though he’s enchanted.  The distraction is clear now, and it winds Harry up.
“It’s best that she knows,” Draco agrees, because this can only be about one thing.  “Lupin can’t hide forever.”  It’s late at night, Saturday, but Draco’s just come home.  There’s a sketch on the parchment in his hands that he’s still not sure is right.  He doesn’t look up from where he’s sitting on the bed, working at it with a pencil.
The aurors are doing things about Lupin, though they’ve not got anywhere yet.  Everyone’s had a chat with Katie Bell, who’s taken it up because Ron’s officially too close.  They keep an owl in Grimmo and Harry’s mum’s bought another, who’s gone for a long time but returns with her letter unopened.
The boy’s godfather takes his cue.  Crossing the few feet that separate them, Harry lifts him by his waist and turns on his heels until Teddy squawks.
Draco looks confused, and, right, it’s possible that Harry’s never explained about Quirrell being possessed.
“You don’t fancy anyone, according to you,” Draco said scornfully, arm around his shoulder and face to his temple as though to seal off the healing charm, not really planting a kiss, not really in front of other people.  Harry didn’t know what he was doing, mostly shivering, shutting his eyes and wanting to hide, breathing in the smell of red wine.  “Tell me that you didn’t call her a
of apparition.  Their reaction pulls them apart, and Harry’s wand is in his fingers.
“What’s this about?” Harry asked, when he and Sirius found themselves in one of the local muggle coffee shops, a week before the second of May.  It was a busy Friday morning in central London, the colours of the place an un-homely corporate blue and the feel of it all printed type.
.  If you use your wand, then it’ll come out the end a foot high, and if you hold it too long it’ll catch and bugger up the varnish.  The click’s easier, but it tends to gutter when you register your fingers burning.”
“I wish I could’ve seen his face,” Harry said, finishing his mead and summoning them both another cleanly poured measure.  It was a display of finesse that Draco never thought to expect, and it almost made him miss what Harry added as an aside.  “I should’ve been with you lot.”
Now Lupin crosses his arms, suspicious.  “Is that so?”
Squeezing Harry’s naked foot, Draco’s shaking his head, grinning because he wasn’t being serious.
The bowtruckle hissed again, incensed.
“Don’t get mead on my sheets,” Draco complained as the duvet rustled around.  “Fucking barbarian…”
James simply laughs, as though this is normal conversation.  “Moony, you traitor!” he mocks, using all the wrong words.
I’m gaining weight.  I’m four months pregnant.”
In the end, it’s James Potter who breaks the roaring silence, with a very deliberate, very considered, “Fuck me.”
she points out, sounding scandalised and touching a hand to her cheek, surrounded by cats.
“Mm,” says Harry’s dad unenthusiastically.
“I bought them to try and turn you on,” Harry tells him, and his grey eyes flash to Harry’s, though his mouth doesn’t move.  “Then I’d stick with my knackered ones.”
Harry kisses up his jaw, all over him, seducing him because he knows exactly how.  Draco doesn’t pull away, kissing him back, breathing harshly, and it takes a worryingly long time for the effort to exhaust him, the good feeling to relax him.  Harry worries, lying on top of him, feeling breath draw in and out over his cheek, the odd shiver.  He worries and he feels a burning feeling, like anger, like something needs to be done.
“Once removed,” Harry mumbles into the end of his pint, looking away from Teddy’s expression.
you doing here, anyway?” Draco asked, more seriously.  He could use a distraction from his own misery, he supposed, but that wasn’t really the point of his question.  “If news of Ginevra’s engagement has not stung you to flight, then…?”
“My godfather came back from the dead, all right?” Harry says, reaching up to card fingers through Draco’s greasy, likely bloodied hair before he worms his other hand under Draco’s collar and pushes his fingers into muscle.  “I’m very needy today.”
But Black, it seems, is amused more by life.  He’s laughing – he’s laughing at Draco, who goes on while his parents are dead, and somehow it doesn’t seem cruel.  It’s almost as though he likes him, Draco thinks, bemused, and he’s laughing at this ridiculous world, because he thinks that Draco will see that it’s funny.
Lupin shakes his head, distracted and amused.  He throws Draco a look like a feast on Halloween.  “I look forward to reading it,” he tells Black.
Clapping, Harry expects that Albus has played on the fact that he’s taller and has longer arms, like the one he’s holding straight above his head – but Lily’s nippy, and Harry hopes that they’ll have the chance for a rematch next year, when Albus will be taking his OWLs.
“I’m fine!” Harry protested, meeting his eyes and batting his hands away.  He looked down between them and at Draco’s face and then – “Budge over,” he commanded, shooing Draco backwards before clawing his lumbering drunk self up and into the bed, kicking off a truly hideous pair of sandals.  The rest of him was a short-sleeved shirt in some quasi-tropical pattern and an even worse pair of long cargo shorts.  Sweat and clean heat, angles wiry but powerful, the only smell coming off him was nonetheless beer.  Wasted or not, he had a clear grip on his wand.  “I said budge
“You’ve made the news, Harry,” Lupin said, dropping the pages to reveal his warm eyes.  There was laughter in them, kind, all a game.  “You and the back of Sirius’s head.”
Harry’s dad puts his glasses on.  “It really
Hermione, of course, only came out with, “Honestly, Ron,” and strode forward onto her tiptoes to throw her arm around his neck while Ron gathered her up by the waist, like it was instinct and he was in love with her.
“You fucking bitch, he was our
“Did you use the stone on him, Harry?” Draco asks, because he’s weak, and it’s the last piece of the puzzle.  He could try without knowing, but he wants to –  He needs to –
.  Harry gets the impression that changing Draco might be below Mandragora’s pay grade, and that Pansy might have behaved improperly by making her babysit earlier.
It makes James laugh, nonetheless, tilting up his chin to the sky, the grin on his face plainly a smirk.  “What was he when you
The trip to the Royal Academy is a relief, because Harry spends the beginning of August avoiding his parents.  He knows that they’ve become friends with George and Angelina, so it makes sense that they’re friendly with George and Angelina’s friends – Lee and Alicia and Katie, most of all – but it’s still a bit much.  Alicia has been married to Justin Finch-Fletchley since 2003, in one of the more heart-warming match-ups from the DA, Neville reckons, so he’s part of the group too, and what’s that about?
“And she’s pulling your leg,” he tells his son, glancing at Draco askance.  “Christmas of sixth year, Moony wasn’t talking to us, and I didn’t have much to say to Padfoot or…”  He stumbles over Pettigrew’s name, pressing his glass to his forehead.  “Although I’m not certain that they noticed.  I’ll confess that I wasn’t terribly…”  He nods towards Lupin.  “Uncle Moony,” he mocks, “is much more stubborn than I am.”
” his dad finishes.  “Well, fine,” he says.  It’s all a game, and Harry can see the definite way he would dip the quill back in the ink.  “What do we say, Lily Potter?” he asks her, seducing, ignoring the interview’s instructions.  His attention isn’t on what he’s writing, so likely he’s scribbling.  “
It’s not because he’s not been expected, Harry knows.  He knows what it is.  He refuses to think about it, because it’s
“Is that it?” he demanded, but Harry only moaned, squinting.
On the platform, past the salt on the scorched step with the rune-inscribed iron above, under the arch inside the bell jar of the veil, there’s the compromised boot with its missing eyelets, as well as the thin slice of what was once Black’s leg.  It looks like something from the butchers, bloody and wet.
There must be something in his voice, because Draco looks up, his hair rumpling against Harry’s leg, his head a weight.  His eyes flick to Harry’s and he apologises, frowning.  “Sorry.”
leaving now!” Malfoy declares, turning on a heel to look at him.  His eyes are wide, disbelieving, and his left hand rises; he breathes from the back of his wrist.  His unicorn wand is in his right hand.
But there is evidence against this line of argument.  Principally, there is what happens in the car park of the car-hire place, when Harry and Draco finally escape from number 12.
, when Lily Potter’s Order of the Phoenix was clearly about friendships on the front line.  “First to fifth year.”
The atmosphere chills.  Harry’s face grows hot, and he thinks that it must be with embarrassment.
this!” Granger complains, looking at the punch.  “Thank you, Kreacher!” she calls to the ceiling.
“Yes,” Harry hisses, spare arm around Draco’s neck, and he’s snogging him and letting Draco hitch up against him, up to spill all over his hand.  He laughs as Draco shudders, the wanker, speaking for him.  He sounds so happy.  “Oh, I should’ve done that the moment you woke up.”
“It’s something Bill told us, once.”  Another brother, Draco recalls.  “Goblins see their stuff as sold under licence, for the life of the owner.  Hermione’ll want something that she can pass on in good conscience.”
“I could have taken two and lived with it.  I could’ve gone that bit further.”
Draco,” Granger finishes mawkishly.  “We want you to be
,” Lupin reads off Draco’s bag, ignoring the question.  “Are you proposing to someone?” he jokes, as if they’re friends.
“So I should buy her expensive presents,” James suggests, too insightful for his own good.  His expression is wry and he’s smirking.  “Or put her up in our house.”
“Which winds up any right-thinking witch or wizard, because…?”
“Not…”  Lupin continues, before he looks away for a moment.
“Maybe I will,” Lee agrees about the pet, grinning, and they go their separate ways.  He doesn’t ask about the divorce.
Stalking by Harry’s desk and circling, the wolf is keeping low to the office’s flagstones, never holding its head high.  It would be willing to send a message, Harry thinks – to check with Luna that Malfoy’s with her and Ollivander and that he’ll be safe, here in this castle.  Protected.  At least on this day.
Can you imagine being

The note is sent back with the

He blinks, taking her in.  Her figure’s curvier than it used to be.  She looks poised and sophisticated, and there’s humour in her expression that he might finally understand.  “Pansy Parkinson,” he realises.
As it is, standing by the door, Malfoy pulls his wand from his sleeve and non-verbally casts
“That’s not on the –”
There’s another version of himself there behind him.  It’s the little boy’s dad, whose eyes are narrowing, meeting Harry’s for a moment, vivid and shrewd and too warm, before he looks at his son.  They look right together: a thirty-year-old man and a child nearly six.  Give the child a wash, and they’re each other’s spitting image.
Eventually, Sirius speaks again.  “It’s a ridiculous name,” he says, mulling on this.  “Deeply unattractive.”  Again, he’s startlingly open and at the same time everything’s a joke.  Again, all Harry can imagine is Molly’s reaction, flustered.  “Whatever possessed me to take up with a man named

But it’s Justin Finch-Fletchley, with remarkable stamina, who points out the obvious.  “Isn’t this when we take the survivors’ photo?”
“Pardon?” Draco directs this question to his face, before turning back to the  mug of sweet, sweet (bitter, bitter) milky coffee that’s hovering its way into his hands.  “I have no idea what you’re saying.”
That fucking note from James fucking Potter, Draco thinks.  He thinks he knows, does he?  He thinks he fucking –
“Sometimes I think that I was only made for you to kill me,” Draco tells him.  “So it’s about penetration, you see,” he’s now saying when Harry opens his eyes, talking about getting fucked.  His colouring is stark and statuesque.  “The ecstasy of self-harm.  The
An edge enters Harry’s voice, distracting Draco from the bob in his throat.
Draco’s huffs, a closed smile on his face.  He’s looking down at his hand, now working Harry’s foot, which is cradled in the angles of his legs, grey twill; they’re holding bottles of beer with no rings to clack against the glass.  “I’ll pass that on,” Draco suggests about Luna, his throat long as he drinks.  “She’ll be glad to know that her heathen marriage destroyed your heterosexual union.  It’s a shame that she’s abroad –”
“You’ll worry yourself into the ground,” says Sirius unironically, turning on the path.  “The war ended, remember.”
There’s Neville too, again, over by the platform which the elves have constructed, black and white to match the chairs, feature and field reversed.  He’s chatting easily with Ron and Hermione and Ginny, her fiancé Matías, Harry guesses, who doesn’t look at all out of place.  Matías is surely going to be more than nice enough, though this is the first time Harry’s met him.  He has dark features, and Harry supposes that it could even be flattering, that this is what Ginny likes.  He’s handsome: taller than Harry by a couple of inches and broader, his face nonetheless more precise-looking, the shadow of a beard around his jaw.  He’s laughing at something Ginny’s saying, like they all are.  His laugh is a loud and easy sound, uncompromised, much more like that of a stag than a wolf.
After they'd beat hasty retreat from the cellar, flinging up a couple of cursory protective enchantments in their wake, Draco had led Harry to the bedroom for a lie down. Only for Harry to guiltily murmur that he wasn't
the singer crooned. “I mean. We should.”

He was feeling warm, and his hands felt airy, light, like they might just gently fly off on their own. Moving them felt really, really nice. He made some experimental dance-like movements with his wrists and laughed at the sensations. It was like the music was flowing through his hands.
“How about tomorrow, if you’re free at any point? Though you’re probably busy, I—”

A variety of noises followed: a bag dropped to the ground, the sharp rip of a zip and the tinkle of glass—things he assumed were the masseur preparing the accoutrements of his craft.
"Quite impressive wordless casting, there, Goodbrother," Draco says.
However, his period of tranquillity was short-lived, because at the break Potter cornered him.
Potter opened his front door, and stepped inside, and then looked back over his shoulder. “I'll tell you a favour you can do me, Malfoy. Get a bloody life, and stay out of mine.”
It all started with Draco Malfoy being an atrociously clingy child.
The Daily Prophet’s fashion supplement insists Draco looks just as beautiful in a three grand silk crêpe de chine Valentino gown as he does in a sharply tailored high street suit.
Potter is kissing Draco everywhere: his temple, his jaw, his neck. So many hot brands of lips and mouth in so many places. Draco is trembling from each brilliant new combination of flesh against flesh. He becomes aware that he's rutting up against Potter's hips, that his cock is rubbing a slow hot friction into Potter's thigh, and when he looks down he realises Potter's trying to awkwardly shimmy out of his pants.
She looks up. "Yes. For several weeks before she died." Draco notes her phrasing. Clearly Joanna is maintaining her innocence in all of this. "It started off as small shocks when... when..."
But he didn't want to be alone, either.
“It’s a start, and it means you
He ran.
Draco had run through at least seventeen worst-case scenarios by the time the last person left (the seventeenth was that Chang had carked it, and the Dementors were going to arrive any minute to administer the Kiss), and he was well on his way to full-blown panicking when Potter spoke.
“If you expect me to share all the details of my personal life with someone I’ve barely seen for eight years—”
to kiss him.
“What are we like?” Potter chuckled. “Two knocked-up and cranky single blokes trying to figure shit out. It’s tragic, really.” He Vanished the rest of the rice cake; Draco didn’t blame him.
“Oi, I’m standing right here,” Eoin laughed. “And you try walking a mile in ankles this swollen.”
"So, Master Draco, Master Harry, we're quite sorry." Hestia sniffed, her voice wavering slightly. "We have let you down immensely. And we have Kreacher to thank for, well, knocking our silly lids together and making us realise that what we thought to be irreconcilable outrage with one another was no more than a storm in a teacup."
he was of it. His mind reeled at the idea that maybe he was free now, free to move away from it all, to just be, to do what he wanted to, to dance if he wanted, to talk to Draco Malfoy if he wanted. Draco, who in a matter of words, had relieved him of a tremendous burden.

“Alright gentlemen, it’s time to demonstrate your Patronus babycare charms on this cute little dolly here. Neil, why don’t you try first?”
, and certainly not his mother. She’d been surprisingly supportive of him, overjoyed to be honest that he was producing a grandchild, but he couldn’t countenance putting her through the ghastly discomfort of watching her son give birth, not to mention his own at having her there. Perhaps he could ask Pansy, though he knew how squeamish she was. Or maybe he should just go it alone. He was a grown man; he could manage, surely.
“We broke up,” he admitted. “Not long after we discovered I was pregnant.” He grimaced as the baby chose that moment to squirm around in his belly
Draco feels a whoosh in his brain as the Magister's words sink in, and he's helpless to stop himself turning to Potter to see his reaction.
"We could meet again, if you like," Draco said mildly. Harry's heart leapt and then settled. The blissed-out vocals of a song drifted out to them, swooping high and low,
Then Potter shuffles slightly in his sleep and his hard-on pushes even further against Draco's before slipping away to the side. That extra press against his swollen cock has Draco panting in desire, and it's all he can do not to grab Potter by the hips and mindlessly drive himself against him.

Potter frowned and stuck his fingers into his thick hair, scratching at his scalp. "I just... we've had such a perfect record. I don't know how we didn't detect that curse. It makes no sense."
But he’s glad he did it. He feels profoundly changed. He’s noticed several differences in his behaviour since the
The first day he moved in—at Potter’s request, Draco is at pains to remind everyone, his Weasel friend having deserted him now that he’s engaged to Granger… and really, Potter had insisted, it was just a convenience seeing as they worked in the same building, just different floors—Draco woke in the morning and came into the kitchen only to be met with a topless Potter in yet-to-be-buttoned-up jeans. It was then he wondered how he’d

would have been a better place to start.
He decided it was time to flick through Hermione's handy guide and choose a nice restaurant to eat at; he was a bit bloody hungry after all that drama.
"Itinerary from hell? Now this I need to hear about!" Draco laughed.
Because, as you may by now have deduced, Chef Marco A. Floyd was none other than Draco Malfoy, newly returned from ten years’ training and working in Rome.
"I'm not making the racket! It's her! Your snooty pureblood kettle!" Harry ran a hand through his hair. "Worse than Walburga's portrait, that one."

Harry chuckled at her, "You're such a brat, Gin." Pansy dug her heel into his side, causing him to grunt out a huff of air. "What was that for?"
“Yes.” Harry holds his hands up. “Right. Yes, I’m sorry.”
“No, not really. Is there much more of it? Only I’m not supposed to be doing any heavy lifting in my condition.”
But Draco's not

Over breakfast, Potter watched with raised eyebrows as Draco scratched and rubbed at his arm. He held out his hand to Draco.
Harry lost time. He danced. He put his wand up in the air when other people put their wands up in the air. He cheered and whooped when other people cheered and blew whistles. There was a strange sense of unity.
"Do come on," Draco urged, "or the house's magic might rebel, just as the Manor's did. It was a ghastly time by all accounts, and it was all my great-grandmother could do to make him see sense before utter bedlam prevailed. You think that curse in the cellar was bad? That was a drop in the cauldron compared to what craziness we might have to endure. So, you
Potter was still clutching Draco’s hand and grinning. Draco’s head felt light as air, and he couldn’t stop looking at Potter’s mouth. The bow curve of his lips. They looked soft. Draco realised he wanted to kiss Potter… and oh fuck, he felt a bit dizzy too.
and spritzed it discreetly around him. The cab filled with the aroma of sandalwood and Tahitian vanilla. A vast improvement.
Pansy never did manage to throw the baby shower she’d been planning, what with Draco and Harry hardly spending a minute apart in the run up to the birth. But she plotted with Hermione and Allison (all three fast friends since they bonded at St Mungo’s over being birth partners to three demanding men) and threw a surprise party for them when the babies were four weeks’ old. Draco’s flat was heaving with all their friends and family, as well as their classmates and their new babies, and to Draco's surprise, he had a brilliant time, showing off little Phoenix and telling everyone who'd listen what a good baby he was, not to mention handing him off to various people while he ate baby-themed cupcakes and handfuls of Pom-Bears and bitched to Eoin and Sam about the 3 a.m. feeds.
transfered to me and Malfoy, and it's bloody inhumane! Forcing us to touch each other against our will!"
“You can’t stop yourself, can you?" Draco scowled. "Always have to be good at everything and think you can fix everyone’s problems?”
“He should be alright, Mr Malfoy,” she replied, and Draco wasn’t sure how she knew who he was, but then his mugshot had been in the papers rather a lot following the war. “There’s a charcoal and fluxweed poultice under the bandages that’s working away, drawing the poison out. And we’re monitoring the baby while that happens. Once that’s done and we’re sure she’s safe and well, we’ll treat Mr Potter's head injury and hopefully he’ll come round shortly afterwards.”
But Potter went all quiet then and said, “Do you?” and well, Draco couldn’t back down then. And he probably meant it, really, if he was honest with himself.
According to Harry, the kettle had taken a dislike to him from the outset. And he'd been nothing but nice to it!
Potter didn’t meet his eyes, just shrugged, and Draco was surprised to note that he was looking embarrassed.
"For the hundredth time Draco,
Harry pinched a thread of rogue tobacco from the end of his tongue. Then took another big drag. Draco turned and swiftly captured Harry’s mouth, and inhaled just as Harry was exhaling. It wasn't exactly a kiss, but Harry's groin seemed to think it was, flaring with arousal. The warmth in his chest had moved south and he could feel something uncoiling inside him, a deep desperate need that he hadn’t felt for a long time
Potter nodded; he didn't really seem to care. “I remember it very well. But it’s been years, and I’d like to think that we’ve both changed a lot since then.” Draco had to bite his lip to stop himself from saying Potter had definitely got better looking. “And I thought we buried the hatchet that time when I clocked you one after the trials.”
morning sickness. It lasted for months. I could barely keep a thing down.”
Draco was in shock. "How early? This must have taken ages! Where did you find a birdbath so early? Abbott's doesn't open until nine o'clock."
"That's brilliant, Harry," Luna smiled. “You both deserve so much love.”
She closed the door and waved, and as the car pulled out into the mid-morning London traffic, Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco thought that things were maybe going to be alright.

“A rare type of Devil's Snare." She lifted Harry's other hand and pointed her wand at his wrist. A small red glow pulsed in time with Harry's heartbeat. "One that secretes poison as it suffocates," she added, then looked at her watch as she counted the pulses.
Healer Thornberry adds that the effects will keep alternating back and forth between them until the equilibrium is reached. And that is even more confusing. Although she's unsure as to the objective of such a curse—if there is one (other than to just be highly fucking annoying)—Thornberry also says the easiest way to sort it is to get the original caster to remove the curse. The alternatives can be rather more...
“What the buggering fuck are you doing?”
“That’s fair. You’ll have to keep her locked up until she's seventeen if she’s anywhere as pretty as you.”
But there was no response to his owl that evening, or the following day. He considered calling to Potter’s home, but he feared that might be presumptuous. They weren’t a couple. Not yet. He didn't know where they stood, if indeed they stood anywhere at all.
Potter was fucking with him. Potter was totally fucking with him, and Draco had been stupid enough to have actually fallen for it.
Draco bites at a bit of skin on his lower lip. "There's a reason for that. I found the description of the spell, and it turns out it requires a specific counter-spell rather than the general one that Placid cast. So the curse didn't, in fact, get lifted."
In the end he agreed to let Hermione book it all for him, while he diffidently sipped a beer... several beers, and took another look at that bloke with the surfboard. Not even his type, he thought, he preferred blonds; though who was he to be choosy these days?
"And you!" He pointed at the figure leaning oh-so casually against the doorframe, eyes crinkled with mirth, dressed in the green silk dressing gown Harry bought him last Christmas. "You know I've got the tickles,
