good," Harry said, tucking his free arm across his belly against the cold, crossing his legs at the ankles before him.
Harry felt his cheeks warm. He loved his parents. He loved Sirius and Remus, too, more than anyone else in the world. But this conversation? Harry had heard Jackie talk about the degree of awkwardness she had been forced through when attempting to explain her sexuality to her parents, but this felt different. Harry wasn't concerned that his parents would have a problem with him dating a boy, especially not with Remus and Sirius as an example themselves, but…
Draco realised, rather abruptly, that he hated the interviews. Even with only the first published in
"I'm not encouraging but recognising wit when I see it."
It wasn't unexpected, that he was shunned. It wasn't unfamiliar to be glared at, to be sneered at, to be the subject of hissing and spitting as though surrounded by a particularly disgruntled horde of kneazles. Draco was used to it – or had become used to it in the years he'd been back in London. The war had passed and the post-war clean up all but swept under the rug, but memory still remained.
"Right."
"Yeah." Harry picked up his drink once more, biting the end of his straw. "Just because you've been looked down on or whatever doesn't mean you have the right to look down on others. I don't care how much money your parents make or how big your house is or – or how 'clean' your blood is or whatever. Don't," he pointed a finger at Draco, "look down on me."
"Where are you going every day?" Lily had asked.
Hands compulsively fixing his shirt as though they didn't know what to do with themselves, Draco strove to grasp a hold of his own composure, grappling with rising anger that always flickered like a suppressed flame when he was harassed. He attempted – and likely failed – a returning smile. "Quite. I wouldn't have thought that
Sirius glanced towards James, towards Remus, and Harry's clenched his jaw so hard it hurt. There was no surprise from any of them. Not the kind that Harry would have otherwise expected. "Did you all know about this?"
"So why?"
Draco sighed through his teeth. For a brief moment he closed his eyes, gathering himself before he returned his attention to her. "I'm sure he's had his fair share of suitors approaching him for every reason and with every request under the sun. I don't want to be just another one of them."
Harry swallowed a laugh. The blond kid – Draco, the girl had called him – clearly hadn't meant it to be amusing, but it kind of was. He shared a glance with Jackie only long enough to roll his eyes. She looked entirely too pleased with the situation.
"Yeah. Thanks."
Harry thought.
Besides, little sleight of hand movements, conjured simplicities, and flashy flourishes weren't anything special – and yet Draco jerked in his seat and swung his gaze towards the rose with wide eyes.
Kurt snorted and flicked another paper.
Harry stared at the dark smear of the door, and he almost couldn't breathe. Slowly, fingers trembling, his hand rose to his stinging cheek, pressing against the angry flush of his skin. A wordless sound managed to slip from his lips but it died almost immediately.
The hubbub of the entire student body was a buzzing storm of voices rebounding throughout the Entrance Hall. Walking alongside Ron and Hermione, Harry glanced at it only briefly as they descended the stairs. Travel pack slung over his shoulder with little more than the bare necessities packed, he was barely aware of where his feet took him or what either of his friends were saying. Just as it had been for the last week, his mind was decidedly elsewhere. Decidedly fixed upon someone else.
Harry didn't speak. Not immediately. He barely even seemed to be breathing himself. The passing thought snagged Draco, and he instinctively glanced towards Harry with the irrational thought that he might have somehow stopped breathing altogether.
Blaise grinned widely, teeth flashing and eyes dancing. He had an infectious smile, Harry had noticed, which only enhanced what he'd also noticed was a considerably attractive face. Not that he quite suited Harry's tastes, but that didn't matter; his smile seemed to be reserved for Jill most of the day.
Harry couldn't help but smile. "Can't wait," he said. "What have you got for me tonight, by the way?"
A beat of silence met his words, then James broke into laughter. "Very good, Bambi," he said through chuckles.
"Think what?" Harry asked.
Harry didn't know why at first. Glancing up at Draco, at the tight lines of his face, he followed the line of his gaze towards the bricked archway and the smattering of posters stuck across it. Posters he hadn't noticed coming out but must have surely been there.
"How do you figure? You raised me."
Snorting, peeling an eye open from where he'd closed them minutes before, Harry met Jackie's gaze through the darkness. The streetlamp outside his window was enough to make out her features down to the disgruntled set of her lips.
he thought as he crossed the threshold into
Harry laughed behind him, and even if Draco really had objected to the inevitable meeting, that simple outburst of amusement would have been enough to soothe his disgruntlement. Draco would do just about anything to make Harry laugh.
A bark of laughter rung from behind his parents. "Yep, he's definitely yours, James," Sirius' said between chuckles. "Can smell a discovery from a mile away."
"Alright, alright, wanker," Jackie said. "We'll do something academic. Maybe…" She trailed off, raising her book to tap it thoughtfully against her chin. It slapped down into her lap a moment later when her face suddenly lit up. "Oh! Harry, we could go to that magic show down in London!"
As if it had been waiting for their conversation to reach a natural close, the distant clocktower chimed again. Straining his ears, Harry cocked his head to listen to the chimes. "Shit," he said as they silenced. "It's four already?"
Sirius was the 'fun uncle', as Remus called him. The one who gave him his first coke when Lily said he shouldn't have fizzy drinks. The one who watched his first R-rated movie with him and gave him his first sip of alcohol. He was the one who always had a joke on his lips, a friendly arm around Harry's shoulder, and a ready smile. He was always took an interest in Harry's love life, had given him his first packet of condoms, and seemed nothing if not thrilled by the prospect of Harry one day getting a boyfriend.
Nonetheless, he didn't comment further as the elevator pinged and the doors slid silently open. He wouldn't discredit Pansy by asking how she'd managed it – for a master never revealed their methods – and he wouldn't do her the even greater disservice of asking why she'd bothered to go to such lengths. Her assistance was for the same reason that he'd helped her write her essays without question countless times throughout their school years. It was simply what they did.
"She probably already is."
"Not at all," Draco said with just enough sarcasm that Pansy wouldn't be able to miss it.
"You still have your feet," Malfoy said from above him.
"It is! I need to know this kid."
"Wonderful," Harry said. His gaze drew to a cluster of said green and silver students decidedly removed from the rest of the room. They seemed about as ostracised as Harry and his few friends were, if in larger numbers. "Condescending, then?"
"Preferably not. There's none that quite suits."
Malfoy frowned a little himself. He glanced back to the microscope, shifted slightly in his seat, then raised his hand in that fluttering, disregarding wave Harry had seen from him before. It was characteristic enough of his old prat-ish self that Harry had to bite back a smirk.
"I think it's nice," Luna said, drifting from where Harry hadn't even noticed her to Ginny's side. She smiled dopely at Harry. "You suit one another."
"Sorry about that," he said.
"I hate that you feel like you need to be someone and be helping people to be appreciated."
Draco blinked. The rapid-fire French struck him unexpectedly, but it wasn't what made him pause. Madame Clementine – or Clementine Holm, as she was legally known – was a Swiss designer and creative director by turns that was known for her incredibly humble attitude that bellied her prestige. Draco had never met her, but he'd heard enough of her that he was rendered momentarily speechless, distracted from his bout of melancholy.
"It might be a good idea to clean up a little if we intended to sightsee any more."
Jackie grumbled, stuffing another bite into her mouth. She didn't care that she was making a mess. She didn't care that the librarian, ancient Mr. Mann that everyone at the school nicknamed 'The Mummy' for the way he practically embalmed himself in unfashionable linens every day, would splutter and likely kick her out. Jackie made a point of doing exactly what she wanted. Always.
As such, he'd never seen Harry like this. Not smiling and even laughing casually to a man Draco detachedly recognised as a casting director he'd seen a handful of times around
Harry rarely visited the city, but when he did it always struck him like a dash of cold water in the face. London was different to Potting Point. Very different. It moved at about double the pace and people were
Draco opened his mouth to reply but found no words. That was the problem. That was, ultimately, the problem that he was realising. Pansy was right. Harry truly didn't seem to care that he was being used, as a model or as an idol for worship and adoration in the Wizarding world. Just as he didn't – or at least no longer – cared that he'd been used by Dumbledore, and the professors of Hogwarts, and the publicly recognised Order of the Phoenix. Draco could still picture the slight smile on his face as he shrugged at Pansy's words even hours after he'd seen it, disregarding the fact as necessary at the time.
"It wasn't like I particularly enjoyed being in it, you know."
Swallowing a little painfully, Draco dropped his gaze to the floor. Around him, the sound of voices murmuring in conversation through the walls, of models and stylists readying themselves next door and what sounded like another consultation of sorts beginning in the opposite room. But Draco hardly noticed. His fingers paused on the edge of one white-framed print, and he couldn't help but stare at the image of Harry staring back at him with his unwavering gaze.
Hermione, reclined on her elbows with her eyes closed, didn't answer. She started when Harry nudged her with his elbow. "Huh?" she asked, cracking an eye open.
"James, don't encourage him," Lily said.
Jackie glared. Medusa really didn't hold a candle to her.
Ron's clinking and tapping faltered. "What?"
that lucid part of his mind provided. "Oh, God. Harry, are you alright?"
"Do you think you'll ever visit your parents? If you're allowed to, would you?"
At any other time, Harry might have taken her up on the suggestion. He and Jackie had always baited one another when it came to open acts of rebellion, both in school and out. But her words niggled at the back of his mind.
It was Harry's turn to pull a face, though Hermione had leapt upon Ron's words, diving headfirst into explaining just why theoretical and practical were very, very different types of learning, and he doubted either of them noticed. Turning away from them, he picked up his pace a little to step around the pair of junior girls headed down the aisle towards them, offering them both a smile that they returned in kind as they passed. He caught a word or two as he did so, a brief "try out for the team" that was nothing if not utterly normal conversation, and unexpectedly halted into a flux of consideration. Rather than listen to Ron defending the merits of experience over book knowledge, and Hermione arguing the exact opposite, Harry turned towards the Head Table.
"And looking… yes, right, to me, yes."
"Because I saw them."
"You're not going to let this go, are you?" he asked.
It had been a near thing, though. Draco claimed he was just about tempted into passing the entire day between the sheets. His reluctance to rise was emphasised when he'd wrapped himself around Harry, stealing his lips and his breath all at once in a kiss so deep it seemed to reach into Harry's lungs. It was only with much grumbling that he'd hauled himself from the bed.
"Your, um, your lap." Harry snorted at his own thoughts, then again as he realised he'd actually spoken it aloud. "I think I've lost my feet."
It wasn't for such reserve that he didn't message Sammy back. He simply didn't want to. For once, not even the knowledge that Sammy wanted to himself was enough to urge him to reply. Not this time.
Harry barely heard him. With a brief glance to Jackie, he frowned at the Hogwarts students. "And that means…?"
to Abel, but he had few enough real friends as it was. It was worth sticking his neck out just a little to lend a hand.
"You interrupted my printing," he said, leaning against the door frame and raising an eyebrow. "Did you have to?"
"About what?" Harry said, tipping his head slightly as he regarded Troy. He had a good posture. He held the camera well, too. Considering him, when Harry really thought about it, he supposed that maybe Troy's attitude hadn't even been that bad.
"Maybe because it is."
first release. Draco knew Pansy was being hounded with the same.
"A couple of decades. It was kept somewhat under wraps."
Draco allowed himself a small smile. The thought of working with Muggles was a little discomforting still, but nowhere near as aversive as it had once been. Rendered all but a squib for two whole years, Draco had grown a reluctantly healthy respect for the capability of those without magic. He couldn't imagine the struggle of facing every day without it with no promise of his incapacity being lifted.
"What?" Draco asked, blinking hooded eyes.
, don't hurt him, don't –"
"But not as much as they used to."
Harry winced again. Family politics weren't something he had much experience with; James' side of the family was practically non-existent, with his grandparents retreating back to his grandfather's motherland when he was only a kid and rarely visiting since, though when they did it was always affable. Lily's family was a little less appealing, and Harry hadn't seen the Dursleys in years. They'd never gotten along, and when his Uncle Vernon had almost popped a vein at learning of Harry's coming out, it had been the final straw for Lily. Vernon had always been a bigoted ass, and Lily admitted that her sister wasn't much better these days, to say nothing of their son Dudley.
"One," he said primly, "you
"If I'm going to be boringly truthful, working," Harry replied.
Draco could hate someone but still recognise they were gorgeous. He'd practiced just that habit for years. But what did it mean when that hatred was abruptly found to be… just a little less profound than it had been?
"Was it accidental magic?" Draco asked.
Pansy blinked. If he were to hazard a guess, he might think she even looked a touch surprised. Any evidence of such vanished an instant later, however, when she plucked her pen out of the air where it had been suspended and set the nib to her page.
"Will we be holding a meet-and-greet today, then?" she asked. "To see where everyone stands?"
"Bitch, then. Crazy bitch." Jackie's breath hissed between her teeth while Jill returned to wrapping her arms around Harry's waist in her gentle, firm hold. "I hope she rots in hell.
Across the room, Malfoy shifted between his feet. He was dressed again, and Harry hysterically thanked any god who was listening that the pale skin he'd caught an eyeful of earlier that evening was covered by thick robes. Malfoy's blond hair was almost luminescent in the thin darkness of the room, his face just as much, and the dark smudges of his eyes were trained directly upon Harry.
Harry felt like he didn't know much of anything anymore, but he knew he was scared. He'd been scared since the second Bellatrix had yanked him from the roadside out the front of his house, dragged him into a tunnel of Apparition, and dumped him into a closed room of no windows, furniture, or warmth. There was no room in his head for anything else. No room for feeling anything but fear.
Her words were flung towards Draco and Pansy, both of whom immediately adopted identical expressions of raised eyebrows and parted lips. Jackie likely didn't see them however, striding across the room towards the exit without a backwards glance.
So Harry sat with Jackie's disgruntlement. He enjoyed his pizza and laughed as Blaise poked fun as Pansy using her knife and fork "like a real Italian". When Jill asked him where they'd been that afternoon, he and Draco replied with a watered down – and non-magical – explanation of exploring a certain outdoor mall across the city. When Draco drew him into murmured conversation about the movie, the mechanics, how there had really been explosions, and if they'd been actual guns, Harry laughed and attempted to explain special effects in a way that felt as watered down as their explanation to Jill had been. Given he knew little enough about filmography, it was a case of the blind leading the blind, but Draco's fascination was worth the attempt.
"The pleasure's all mine. I owe Pansy more than a favour or two, so consider it partial repayment."
Draco hung up with only the barest chuckle chasing his words, leaving Pansy staring down at the earpiece in the full throes of a smirk. She shook her head, barely registering when Blaise reappeared behind her from where she'd elbowed him away and hooked his chin over her shoulder.
Harry stared at him a moment longer. Malfoy stared right back, probe raised expectantly. A moment of stasis passed, the mutters of the rest of the class the only interruption. Then Harry snorted, shook his head, and turned back to the microscope. "Whatever. Prat."
"Forget illegalities, I'm talking about the fact that you're still a bloody teenager. Slow down a bit, champ."
"Yeah, yeah, whatever." Another yawn had Ron slumping back into his chair, rocking it slightly on its feet. "Did you actually get any sleep at all?"
It was even more surprising for the fact that she wasn't a witch. That much was made starkly clear from the moment Draco followed Pansy into the room.
It was wonderful to consider, but daunting in a whole new way. What would this mean? What if his parents found out? Christ, what would Lily and James say if they found out he could do such a thing, that magic was real and that he could use it?
"So that's why everyone else in Hogwarts hates you?" Memory of Ron's palpable dislike rose to the forefront of his mind.
Which wasn't to say that it was necessarily bad, but he found himself utterly unsurprised when, leading them back to the stage room, the guide planted himself before their crowd and began performing magic tricks.
Draco packed up slowly that evening. So slowly that he was one of the last to leave the conjoined rooms that sat adjacent to the studio he'd spent most of the day in. The clock on the wall ticked steadily closer to six o'clock, but Draco hardly noticed. Just as he barely noticed his hands moving as he packed away the last of his equipment.
Potter smiled. Again. And this time just the hint of a dimple shadowed his cheek. How had Draco not noticed he had a dimple, even if only slightly? Potter should stop smiling. He should definitely stop. It was disconcerting.
"Yes, and I also have priorities when it comes to your work," Draco said. He turned deliberately in Dot's direction, fixing her with a faintly accusing glance. "Like making sure your photographers aren't fucking rapists."
"Do you like pepperoni pizza too?" Jill asked, cocking her head at Blaise. "It's the sauce, right? It tastes different for some reason."
"Yes, well, I do quite enjoy it."
"Hi, Sammy. Yeah, sorry I missed you…"
He didn't blame them. Not the letter-writers, nor the journalists, nor the public that kept their comments and criticisms to themselves. Draco hadn't blamed anyone for their hatred for a long time, for if he did he knew he would be caught up in the endless cycle of blame for a long, long time. It was just as Harry had said all too accurately the second to last time Draco had seen him: it was better to simply move past it.
"I'm right here, thank you," Harry muttered.
Harry didn't slow as he stepped into the alcove. Dropping his books upon the table, his bag to the floor alongside it, he thrust a kebab in Draco's face to the satisfying, annoyed grunt of his subject.
Pansy chuckled. She actually chuckled, which Harry supposed he'd have to tell Hermione about, what with her avid curiosity. He'd never thought she could make such an affable sound in the past. "Good to know which direction I should defend myself from should I slip up again."
Dimitri's office was unchanged from how Draco had first seen it years before. One of the few photographers granted not only his own rooms but a suite adjacent to a studio for his own personal use, it breathed prestige and superiority in a way that Draco hadn't initially realised. Regardless, he let himself through the door with barely a knock and swept through the studio to the office itself, pausing only as he reached the doorway.
Harry's glance behind himself caught sight of one of the handful of school buses drawing alongside the cluster of waiting students. It huffed and puffed as it stopped, sinking beneath its weight, before being rocked like a ship in a storm as its passengers crammed to climb aboard. They were a distinct distance away, enough that Harry doubted anyone could hear them. It was stupid that Draco had wanted 'privacy' for what Harry had a suspicion he wished to discuss, but that privacy was certainly available.
"Artemis never did give in to Callisto, did she?" Mel said, speaking through Thalia's continuation with a glance towards Clio for confirmation. At Clio's shaking head, she heaved a third sigh. "Silly girl."
"You mean not tonight too," Ron corrected.
"And so long as you're not picking up any bad habits like some models do." She paused, eyed him, and Harry shook his head obligingly. He didn't need another repeat performance of Hermione's blast of overprotectiveness when she'd realised the prevalence of eating disorders and body dysphoria in the industry. As much as wanting to avoid worrying her, it was… well, it was kind of annoying.
"Four," Jackie corrected him.
"I don't even care," Harry said. "Everything."
But Draco didn't retract his words. If anything, his jaw only tightened further. Harry's hands slipped into his lap, the remains of his lunch forgotten. "Holy shit," he said. "That's kind of intense."
Each were a different level of terror, but none were quite the same as how Harry felt in the face of the truth that Gertrude presented. Not how he felt when he was…
Turning in place, instinctively pulling the hood of his jacket up over his head, Harry stuffed his hands and phone into his pocket and strode back the way he'd come. He wove through pedestrians that eyed him curiously, didn't spare a single one a glance in return, and was climbing three steps at a time up to
Harry's smile widened. "I'd like that. Or maybe, if we have a chance, some of the churches?"
So Harry did. He showed, he explained, and then he stopped explaining and simply showed. Draco was fascinated like few people Harry had encountered. It could have been because he was a fresh audience and he could very well grow tired of the theatrics soon enough, but Harry didn't care. He revelled in the hint of awe spreading across his face that Draco couldn't quite seem to withhold. There was something immensely satisfying about being the centre of a good-looking guy's attention.
"You're on time today?"
Except that it wasn't. In spite of its isolation, its predominance of witches and wizards, and the head of the company being a renowned with herself, magic didn't permeate every room and fizzle through the walls like an air conditioning system. There were no folded, magically animated notes flapping about as flooded the British Ministry of Magic, no snaps and crackles of spells, no appearing or disappearing employees as they disregarded the elevator system and Apparated instead.
"Hating my sister," Ron said with less heat than the statement warranted. "She's a bullshit artist, and I can't stand her."
Harry smothered a snort, diving back into his book. Maybe they were just religious. Or maybe they had another stigma against the subject that they didn't feel inclined to share. Harry didn't know, and he was finding that he cared less and less as their shared afternoons progressed. Draco might be good-looking, and he might have perfect eyebrows, and he might be wonderfully tall and have perfect hair that Harry could never manage – but Harry didn't care. Not really.
Maybe it was because he'd been in the Wizarding world for too long, a world that couldn't give a rats arse about such insignificant characteristics of a relationship. Maybe it was because of what he'd seen in those around him, what had blossomed between friends and classmates, what he witnessed evolve first hand yet only fully form that year between Seamus and Dean. It could even be because of what hints from Mrs. Weasley and the likes had him thinking of Sirius. It didn't feel bad. Not wrong.
"You're disgusting," Harry said. Jackie threw a sweet at him.
Abel glanced up briefly at their approach. While he wasn't as close as Harry and the girls were, he still frowned slightly, shooting Kurt and his friends a glance as they took their seats.
"I think 'trial' is an exaggeration," Harry said. "Thanks anyway, though."
It was barely morning and it was already a long day.
Clementine's smile widened with a twitch, satisfaction softening her features. "I'm pleased to hear it. Word is that you're an efficient and dedicated worker."
"I take it you don't either?"
Because it was. It was him and Draco. The exclusion had been gradual over the weeks, but a glance towards where Jackie and Pansy sat alongside one another proved that much, at least. Jackie was peering closely at a dusty tome, muttering in what could be to herself as to Pansy. Not that Pansy seemed to be listening; legs crossed, a tiny vial of nail polish balanced atop her knee, she had spent the past half an hour meticulously painting them with surprisingly intricate patterns.
How ignorant he'd been. Draco hadn't understood then that what he saw would be one step closer to the perfect picture he'd made his goal for years.
Pressing himself briefly against the wall as a string of hastening men and women darted past, Draco cursed the narrow hallways of
Harry waited. And waited. And waited. Next to the door, Von settled against the wall, folded his arms, and similarly stood in silent wait. As the pause extended with only the sound of riffled papers for disruption, Dot maintained her silence. That in itself was almost concerning; she was rarely silent without reason.
Shaking himself from watching the girl disappear through the distant doorway, at the clamour of other bodies, crew and managers alike, swimming after her, Harry dragged his attention to where Draco had appeared at his other side. He was smiling, if only just, and regarding Harry with such an intense stare that Harry almost forgot what he'd said the instant he met his gaze.
he couldn't justify; he'd simply wanted to get out. To abandon the necessity for ducking under cover. To deny that he had to avoid and evade the sea of adoring fans who bathed in the latest news of Harry Potter as though he was a real hero and had saved the day only just yesterday.
"You…?" It really, really wasn't making any sense. Harry raked a hand through his hair. "What? You mean my tricks? What do they have to do with…? Draco, we've been over this, I –"
Or were they reluctant?
"I was, actually."
Levering himself slowly, almost delicately, with the arms of the chair, Harry climbed to his feet. He couldn't look at Draco, glancing around himself to the table, to their textbooks, to the notes he'd barely started that day, and shifted between his feet. He chewed his lip, gnawing over the urge to slink in Pansy's wake. He should leave. If Draco was pissed off – about Pansy's intrusion, her discovery, that she would make his life hell from there on out – Harry would probably be the last person Draco wanted to see. Even had Harry been comfortable right where he'd been, he wouldn't force his company upon Draco. It didn't feel right to do so. Maybe once upon a time he would have rolled his eyes and called Draco out on being a tosser, would have made light of the situation or even revelled in his sour mood, but not now. Not anymore.
"Is Blaise serious about that?" Harry whispered back. "Surely not."
"Good."
"What makes you think that?" Harry asked, genuine curiosity replacing the frown once more.
He broke himself off, exhaling harshly. Lily didn't speak but instead folded herself over Harry once more, arms around his neck as they'd been almost the entire time since he'd woken. The closeness, having the constancy of her touch, was more appreciated that Harry had ever thought it could be.
That aloofness and detachment was stripped from his tone, and the raw scraping of pain beneath was revealed in stark relief. Harry had known it was there, as much because every single person at Hogwarts had it and felt it, but it was different to hear it. It was different to bear witness to when he was scrabbling to cover up his own damaged surfaces.
"Daring is my middle name," Harry said, with an easy shrug.
Jackie clearly didn't care either way, which wasn't surprising in the least. "So long as you're not evil bastards or anything, it'd be better if you guys went together. They're not evil, are they, Harry?"
McGonagall settled back in her chair. Her hands folded over one another on the table before her. "What are your preferences, Potter?"
That wasn't why he rose to his feet, though. It wasn't why he made his way across the room on silent feet that he hadn't even known didn't make a sound with a single step until recently. Not until Ron had made the passing comment, "I can ever hear you coming up behind me. Weird, huh?" Had Harry always walked quietly? When he was a kid, too? Or was that something else that came with the war, something that came with dying?
And, most importantly, was he alright? With all that was going on, every story in the papers and the magazines, and what would surely be less than amiable confrontations in public, was he alright? Harry wanted to know. He wanted to ask, wanted to pick up his phone and call just as he'd never done before, because he cared. Unexpectedly, too late, and quite suddenly yet in a way that didn't feel sudden at all, Harry found that he wanted… that he wanted to…
"Menace," he said.
Harry didn't really know what Draco was referring to. He didn't know, but he didn't ask, instead staring and blinking listlessly. Not quite asleep yet not quite awake. It was an intermediate suspension that sounded good in theory but was really a right pain in the arse, and not of the frostbite kind.
He knew he'd had autonomy, at least to a degree. Draco knew that he should have known better, and a part of him had. Yet even in the face of the violence, the fear, and what had progressed to death and destruction so quickly and uncontrollably, Draco couldn't turn away. There was a part of him, even as he saw his classmates being shot down by Death Eaters, that whispered it was right. That it was how it was supposed to happen. That the Dark Lord had to win.
"What does that make me, then?" Lily asked. Glancing up, Harry saw her in the doorway, arms folded and frowning as anticipated but in the way that said it was really closer to a smile.
"Senior year's catching up with you?"
At Harry's side, Draco snorted, but Jill only smiled. "Tell me about it."
"Hey, if you guys get to stipulate, so do we." Jackie turned to Harry. "You have any picks, Harry?"
"Sacramento green?" Harry snorted. "Who the fuck says 'sacramento green'?" He nudged Draco's leg with his foot before tucking it onto the edge of his chair as Draco made to poke him back. Harry kind of liked that he did, too. It was almost friendly.
"Telephone," Harry murmured detachedly, staring at the beautiful, ornate piece cupped in his hands. Barely larger than his palm, from the weight of it must have been ridiculously expensive. But more than that, the magic, what it was capable of…
"I can see that even less. I wouldn't have thought she'd have put her hand up for something like that. It doesn't seem her style so much."
"So?" Harry squeezed Draco's hands even harder until he finally raised his gaze towards him. "So what? What does that count for anything?"
"Wasn't there an exhibition or something down in Manchester? We could make a day trip of it."
"Boggart."
was a minefield of dodging glares and hisses of hatred. Since that first intervention, Harry had stepped in with his amicable smile and gently raised hand on several more occasions, but that didn't mean the outright threats and physical violence didn't cease.
"What's that?" Von asked.
Harry flung his pen at her, and she only just managed to dodge out of the way as it sailed through the air. "Like hell you will. You love my parents too much."
"And you know," sniffing again, Ron turned back out the window, "any time you wanted to tell us anything, or who this guy is? Even if you just wanted to tell me? Go for it. I'm all ears, Harry."
And because he was Harry Potter. That always put a bit of a dampener on things.
Hermione opened her mouth to reply but caught herself before she spoke. Like Ron, she had more than likely come to terms with Harry openly studying with Draco. Not quite frequently, but every so often in the common room at night after they'd been kicked out of the library, he found himself drifting to the table Draco set himself up at. They couldn't sit as they usually did, not in the company of their classmates and not with the temporary limitation Draco had set upon them, but there was comfort in proximity. Reassurance only added to by the bumping of knees, the murmured exchange in which Harry would pose a question or Draco would comment, to receive a like-minded muted reply.
"Really?" Harry asked, raising his eyebrows at her.
, she said, and the water just… appeared.
Or that, on just the other side of the exams, exams that had such potential for being disastrous, there was… nothing. A whole world of nothing.
"What?" Harry said suspiciously, stopping where he'd been following their friends to the canteen counter.
"Alright, you two," Hermione said as Ron returned to his armchair, bowl in hand. "Even I'm getting sick of it now, and your antics aren't even for my sake."
Another shrug, and Jill passed him to slide into the seat that Blaise seemed to conjure at his side. Harry didn't even see him pull his wand, but it could very likely have been magical give what he was coming to know of Blaise. "Just thought you'd like to know," Jill continued. "Mr. Dawson was the one who gave you all a strike last time for fighting, wasn't he? I wouldn't want you all to get in trouble again."
"Why do you want to know?"
Snorting at himself and his foolishness, Draco tipped his forehead lightly against Harry's. "I like you," he found himself murmuring, so inadequate and yet so perfectly truthful that Draco could almost feel the memory of his childhood antagonism and his resentment shriek in distress. It was made no less starkly jarring by having already admitted to his feelings the day before.
"What's that?" Ron asked.
"How are you even affording that?" Harry asked, simply because he had to know. "Did you sell the other house or something?"
"You terrible person, Draco."
Lily stared unblinkingly up at the ceiling, daring another barely audible
Draco didn't see Harry outside of work hours. Not really. There had been their initial consultations with Picard and Pansy in tow, Von always watching with keen attentiveness like the guard dog he was. There were the interviews themselves, and Draco had little enough to do with them outside of his filming. Then there were the shoots, and though Draco was in charge, though he could conduct the proceedings and direct just as he wanted, it was ultimately still work.
Pausing in step, Harry glanced towards where Ron had all but stumbled to a halt on the curb. He was staring up at the towering building before him with eyes wide and freckles stark upon his abrupt paleness. Turning, Harry drew his own gaze similarly upwards.
Harry grinned. The subject was a heavy one, and it explained about Draco's character far more thoroughly than Harry had explored before. Why he seemed so detached from his peers, or why he didn't seem fond of any outside of his friends to the point that he seemed to actually shun them. It reminded Harry more of his own circumstances. Even on the tail end of a story of a murderer, the realisation sparked warmth in Harry's belly.
he thought, even as he attempted to distract himself by properly working.
Draco sniffed. There was no delicate way to go about making a demand for such truths, not with someone who deliberately lied. Even if there was, Draco had learnt to abandon courteous attempts. He wasn't quite the upstanding pureblood he'd once been, the pureblood he couldn't be when the world considered him so much less.
"Harry," he said lowly, gaze falling to the short span of pebbles between them. "I have to ask you."
"Mum?"
Jill was too, but even after years, she still compulsively flinched whenever someone misgendered her. Kurt and Jacob knew it, too. They took every opportunity to coax a response. Being the kind of person Jill was, she didn't rise to the bait.
were dating, you wouldn't have to struggle so much with my dad being an arsehole for stupid, prejudiced reasons," Harry overrode him. "It's the same thing."
"Apparently my 'attack' upon the Lady Barbara was 'cutthroat and malicious'."
Harry snorted.
"What?"
It was different because it was Harry's boyfriend who'd done it. His boyfriend who had practically threatened someone who had been so much more than a thorn in Harry's side for years. His boyfriend who had made Jacob freeze like a deer caught in a pair of headlights. Turning directly towards him, Harry stared at Draco's composed profile until Draco returned the stare.
? Pounding a fist on the door behind him, Harry spat a curse, squeezed his eyes shut, and drew a deep inhalation. Letting it out in a rush didn't help, nor did the next breath, or the next, but after that the trembling slowed. After that, he could move his rigid limbs enough to slump back against the door and slide to the floor.
"You don't think Weasley –" He flinched again as Harry stabbed a finger in his back. "Fine.
Harry didn't really care, but he asked anyway. It could have been breaking dawn, the sun crawling through the window to seep through the shadows and chase them away, hauling the eighth year boys awake, and it wouldn't have mattered. Harry didn't really care what anyone would say, what anyone would think, of him and Draco sharing a bed. Not even Ron. Not right then.
Harry peered at her sidelong. Her solemn expression had shifted slightly, enough that her agitation and frustration crept forth. She caught his glance and huffed, folding her arms. "You're not the first person to have this issue, Mr. Potter. Not even the fifth."
Ginny still wore a shit-eating grin, but there was definite excitement underlying it now. Even Ron seemed provoked into putting aside their disagreement, hopping to his feet and resuming his lean on the back of Harry's couch. He and Hermione both leant towards Ginny as she flipped her phone open one more, clicked at it a few times, before exclaiming in triumph. "Here. This is definitely the best one I got of him."
"Not really. Other than listening to it, there's not much else I can do but tweak it."
"That would be because the nature of the Death Eater's escape was unknown until only recently. Lestrange's means of escape is still in the process of being discerned –"
"Do you have any idea how fucking crazy I've been, trying to accept the fact that I like your fucking face and you're not as much of an asshole as I always thought you were? That you could actually be a decent person, and that you saved my life, and you spoke up at the trials of people that everyone knows you're supposed to hate, and you didn't ask for anything? How the fuck could I not think differently of you? And then you up and make it even harder for me with what by anyone's standards is incredibly unexpected and foreign by randomly just – just going and fucking sitting on me? What the hell am I supposed to do with that?"
"What?" Blaise asked, glancing his way and drawing Jackie's attention with him.
"Still impossible, but less so."
More than that, Draco knew because in the past few days, things seemed to have changed just a little. Certainly since he'd all but blurted out the truth of his feelings barely days before in the middle of a crowded cafeteria.
"Th-that was –" Scrambling to his feet, Harry couldn't bring himself to release his hold on the marble fountain that in that moment seemed about the only stable thing in his life. "That was –"
"I don't…" Harry sunk his teeth into his lip. Was it the same? What Ron had described, how he felt – could it be the same? Harry didn't know, but talking, even intermittently, and sharing space, and just being together… Was it the same?
Liberation was an addictive pursuit.
"There's plenty of standouts, but I'd be here all day if I told you them all."
Ron wordlessly held it out to him, and Harry glanced at the incoming number on screen. Ignoring Ron and Hermione further, he turned towards Jackie, Jill, and Abel. "It's Sirius. He's probably out the front. I'll see you tomorrow."
"Ginny."
"I said I'm not!"
apparently does, too. It's part of their policy."
"So, where are we going?" Harry asked, voice still low despite it being smothered by the heavy shadows of the corridor. "Is it far? Do you want me to drive?"
Sagging slightly, Harry raised a hand to his head. It shook, he noted, and couldn't for the life of him think why. The thought was fleeting, however, and far less important than what stood before him.
Blaise snorted. As Pansy shot him a glare, the first real break in her blankness, Blaise rolled his eyes. A touch of the easy swagger Harry remembered he'd once had resurfaced. "You're really something, Potter, aren't you?"
"It wasn't a suggestion in itself."
Harry swatted the bag away as he let Draco lead them through the crowd. "Cheap or not, I can't believe you just bought me clothes. When am I even going to wear that?"
"This," Harry reattempted. "You. And me. And you liking me. And me… me probably liking you back."
"You've got the face," the woman across the table told him, as though commenting upon the weather. "And you've got the publicity already. That's a step in the right direction that we can use."
Front and centre would make a very good spot for it. Definitely. Polaroids weren't Draco's preference once upon a time, but the sheer spontaneity of that image had certainly changed his opinion.
THE SECOND REVEAL – AN INSIGHT INTO HARRY POTTER'S SCHOOL LIFE
"Don't I know it."
Draco nodded. "Correct. I'm sure they'll have a wealth of historical resources."
If Draco was going to come, it would only be made it so, so much better.
"So unfair."
"It's a little bit concerning that you don't know them given you're the one who's going to be working with them over the next few weeks," Jill said a little chidingly.
Harry knew the techniques. He knew the prodding questions and had learnt how to peer beneath their superficiality to spy the booby traps hidden beneath, planted to trip his tongue into revealing more of himself than he'd ever wanted to share. He knew the habit of maintaining eye contact, of an unwavering smile, of body language – leaning forwards, copying gestures, the deliberate twitch of facial features – and he'd come to recognise more than a few in an instant of their flickering existence. It was necessary, just as it was necessary to dodge around the silent questions as often as the blatant ones.
"What're you -?" Draco began, then silenced himself with a startled blink when Harry flapped the knotted handkerchief in his face again and it unravelled in a dramatic sweep.
Draco considered for a moment before nodding obligingly. That much was true. Very true. When he really thought about it, he'd much rather face Harry's trio of friends than an opponent like Pansy, especially since she'd been on his back ever since their first interview session for the new series the day before. But still…
"Soon?"
Draco sighed. It was so typical of Pansy. "I take that as an insult to my good taste."
"No," Draco murmured, pulling away just far enough that their lips brushed together when he spoke. "But I think I'm closer than I've ever been before."
The doorbell rang.
Harry blinked again. He opened his mouth before closing it again almost immediately. That was… unexpected. Also unexpected, like everything else about what was rapidly coming to feel like the Draco Situation. Harry flipped hesitantly to page fifty-nine and eyed the isolated paragraph quoted by Cragstone himself at the very centre. It was just as flowery as the rest of the chapter, but if Draco had meant what he said…
"I don't care. I found your feet, but you can just use my lap-chair until you do, too."
"I thought as much," Gertrude said a little smugly.
"You bet." Harry smiled again, picking up his fork and turning his attention to the motley array of his salad. "You should know by now, Draco, everything I've ever done has been in an effort to undermine you."
Harry had asked him on their first day in Lucerne, as though it wasn't blatantly obvious. Because Draco cared. He wanted. He wanted so much that his fingers tingled with the urge to reach out, just to touch Harry – his hand, his arm, his face; anything – and he had to forcibly hold himself back. He wanted to talk for hours on end about the foolishness of a magazine spread, or debate over the latest claims that Potioneer Danielle Bern had revolutionised the make-up industry. He wanted to share not just lunch but breakfast, and dinner, and to spend the aftermath washing dishes just as Harry had done in his apartment weeks before, not because he liked to clean but because of what such simple domesticity entailed.
, with his perfect hair, his arrogant smirk, his superiority complex that wasn't quite as insufferable nor nearly as bad as it had once been - would take any interest in him. It left him stunned at times. Disbelieving.
On the lakeside, the attending crew were making short work of packing up the scene. The models, wrapped in heavy jackets to stave of the cold that would have chilled their skinny frames to the bone in their thin outfits, were being herded up the shore like glamourous cattle. Draco took a step backwards from an older woman as she appeared alongside him, reaching for his abandoned tripod and folding it with practiced hands. She nodded silently to him, nothing more than an acknowledging gesture, and set about her work without comment.
"That's a little excessive, isn't it?" Ginny asked, already reaching for the offered pen.
"Duly noted," Harry replied.
"I'm not even going anywhere after this, you know," Harry said, eyeing the crew as they swept around him in their post-shoot mania. He'd always watched curiously; as a world parallel to but distinctly apart from his own, it never failed to interest him. The flashing lights, the snapping cameras, the intent expressions and focused gazes - so often Harry had been at the mercy of masters of their trades, and that each worker had their own distinct approach to their respective roles was a curious study.
"Yeah, I promise."
"Yes. It's almost funny how long he got away with it when you think about it. You'd think the professors would have noticed."
"Rejects?" Hermione asked.
Pansy shot such a brief glance towards Draco that Harry almost missed it. For Draco's part, Harry noticed his expression was even blanker than it had been before. He was watching Harry too, his hands rested atop the camera, and posed so still that he hardly seemed to be breathing.
"I suppose," Draco said slowly, "we're a bit the same in that regard."
There wasn't much affection between them. Not that Harry could see. He wasn't even sure any existed, or what it would look like if it was there. He and Draco didn't like one another after all – did they? It was a transaction of sorts, comfortable for Harry and tolerable for Draco, though why and how, Harry wasn't sure in any sense of the term. It just happened. It was easy, agreeable, and Harry didn't worry that in a split-second Draco might decide he'd had enough and end their agreement.
Ron was his friend. His best friend. He was a good-looking enough bloke, and Harry could acknowledge that he was fit, but - no. The flush of satisfied warmth that Harry felt with Draco, when he was sitting with him, leaning against him, soothed into sleep time and again, wasn't there. Harry didn't feel the urge to reach out and touch him, to climb into Ron's lap and sink into the softness of touch and closeness that held nothing more than just that.
"Unduly, at times. How better to learn than by practicing adaptability?" Dimitri's finger drifted again. "Simone Whittaker. Absolutely gorgeous; you don't need to be told that. Just look at her presence. Winona Bellefonte: she's only young but definitely a something. Xavier: he was a struggle at first, but just look at his poise. You could hardly attain such a presence without innate skill…"
With leggy strides, she was crossing the room again without a backwards glance. Only a word flung to the receptionist, a querying "Josef hasn't called in yet has he?" and the replying dissent, was spared before she all but disappeared for the efficiency of her step.
"Not possible. Everyone loves jellybeans."
"About as bad as you did," Jackie said, and the unspoken elephant in the room remained unacknowledged. Harry doubted he would have performed well either if their roles had been reversed.
"About how I'm going to bloody well say this." Draco's hands systematically bunched into fists and released at his sides as he took another turn. "I can't – I don't know how –"
"Don't worry, Mr. Neat-Freak," Ginny said, patting his head affectionately again. She didn't miss the swat of his magazine this time. "We'll keep your place spick and span. That's what magic's for."
Before Draco could reply, Pansy was spinning towards him and hissing through her teeth. "Draco, what is this?"
"Why?"
"Harry."
Harry had never been properly self-conscious – or at least he didn't think he'd been. Hindsight, as he'd discovered only in the past few months, was an interesting thing. Sharing showers and changerooms, getting dressed alongside the other boys – or not, as Harry belatedly realised. He'd rarely shared an open dressing space with his dormmates, and he'd always waited until the shower room was empty before entering himself. It had been natural. Automatic. He hadn't even thought about it, and definitely not with undertones of disgust the likes that Dudley's teasing or Uncle Vernon's blatant homophobia would have exhibited. But it was uncomfortable, he realised. Unnerving to be seen in such a way.
He was watching without really seeing as a middle aged woman with frazzled curls scolded another that had to be half her age when a throat cleared at his side. Blinking, Harry straightened slightly and glanced over his shoulder.
"Yeah,
"We're here to help," the tall woman in the tall portrait said. "It's what we do."
"Too right. Which means Christine hasn't got a leg to stand on."
"Who?" Draco asked, his voice lashing out more sharply than he'd intended as he snapped his gaze towards Dimitri. "Who did you say?"
arrived in the talons of a different owl every day, shedding downy feathers and printed newspaper alike onto his dining table. He'd seen the headlines, the articles, the moving pictures that were so unlike the Muggle kind he was used to taking himself and showed far too many frowning faces to feel at ease with the contents within. Draco didn't even need to read them; he could predict well enough what they said. But he read it all anyway.
, and
"Family friends," Draco clarified. "Though they've always been more like family group."
Also, references to character promiscuity plays a pretty strong part in this chapter in particular. It's not necessarily long-standing and persistent throughout the entire fic, but just be aware if this makes you uncomfortable.
"Very good, sir," the waiter said, accepting the menu with a slight bow.
"Fuck off," Greg said, and Vince grunted in what could have been agreement.
"Oh, sod off. You're only deciding that because your boyfriend made a vague remark about his preferences."
"You practically raised yourself."
"Not as much." Harry grinned. "Just ask Mum. She'll back me up."
"Thanks," Harry muttered, closing the Apparition Room door behind him with a soft click and bathing briefly in the echoing silence of it.
"Don't worry about it," he'd said, brushing Harry's shoulder with his own. "Pansy would have known this was going to happen, so she'll smooth things over."
"Calm down, calm down," Pansy had interrupted him as the car drew to a halt. "This is just the preliminaries, Draco. Try and enjoy the preparation before you become too invested in the actual journey."
Sighing, Lily let herself fall sideways, slumping onto James' shoulder. His head rocked against hers, cheek atop her crown, and for a moment Lily felt the weight of the day seep from her shoulders. She closed her eyes, massaged the frown from her forehead with her fingers, and bathed in the simple quiet of their living room, the crackle of the fireplace the only disruption.
It left Harry in the unfamiliar role akin to a concerned but helpless brother. He wasn't even sure if he should be concerned as he watched Blaise follow Jill into their room, saw him playfully nudge her with an elbow with a whisper in her ear that elicited an outburst of laughter from her in return. He was so distracted watching the two of them that he startled slightly when Draco leant into him to murmur in his own ear.
"Old ones?" Harry had asked.
was certainly uncharacteristic of him
Harry glanced in the direction of her voice, saw her face only hazily, but didn't slow in his still stumbling entrance. He saw faces turn towards him, pale and exhausted. Parvati. Seamus. Susan. All only vaguely attentive, vaguely curious as they struggled to conjure the energy after a gruelling trial.
"Definitely. It tastes better."
"I think they probably didn't care for you, even though everyone assumes you must have been in a household that fawned over you," Draco ploughed on brutally, even as he internally winced at his own words. They were too true of his own past opinions. "I think that's the reason you had the same clothes from first to sixth year, and why you were always thinner when you came back to school from the holidays, or why you stayed at Hogwarts over Christmas. I think you had a bloody bad time of it, and either you don't want to admit it to yourself or you don't want to admit it to anyone who asks. Which is it?"
Draco still didn't turn towards him. His backs straightened slightly, almost rigidly. To make himself taller? Stronger? To fortify himself? Harry wondered why. "There was a man, years ago, who gave Slytherin a bad name for the cult that he formed from its members."
"That's a little unwarranted, don't you think, Jackie?"
Pansy's lips pinched, the only shift in her expression. "Why do you want to know?"
The cot rocked wildly with her collision. Harry was in her arms as Lily staggered to her knees. He was waking, stirring, gurgling and then grizzling as she clutched him and all of his swaddling to her chest, spinning towards the black-robed man. The man who straightened, turning towards her. The pale hand, the pale wand, the cowl and the black draping that hid almost every inch of him…
"What?"
The riot that was wreaking havoc through Draco's head – about Harry, the interviews, the hatred that seemed to claw towards him like a cinch tightened around the walls of his flat – and it was only made worse by his isolation. Even Pansy's occasional visits, more frazzled and tight-faced that he'd ever seen her let herself become, didn't alleviate the tension.
"Harry?"
"The shoot." Draco gestured to the vacated shoreline. "That's a wrap, unless I kick up a fuss and demand we do a re-take. So, what do you think?"
Harry wasn't uninterested in technology. He found it interesting, a curious study, and it was certainly useful. He could appreciate that it was impressive to have somehow modified such things to be able to function in the presence of magic, too, if not quite as enthusiastically as Ron did.
"Mr. Malfoy," she said with a nod. "A pleasure to meet you."
"I do, clearly," Draco said, dropped his foot from the expected retaliatory kick. "It's called proper English."
Harry bit his tongue on a retort. The Hogwarts kitchens. Draco had offhandedly mentioned they were run by elves, a revelation that had Harry scrambling for a proper explanation. Elves? Like the short, pointy-nosed creatures that allegedly helped Santa Clause in his annual duties? Apparently not, but the explanation Draco had given wasn't much more comprehensible and not in the least because of their pervasive masochism and obsessive servitude.
The smile grew crooked with self-deprecation. "I wasn't exactly the beautiful swan, Draco. The ugly duckling, maybe."
"I take it you've got your hands in computer guts?"
"Can't you like both, then, hon?" Calliope asked. "Although, I don't know why you'd think it such a bad thing to just be one or the other. Why, I'll have you know that some of the greatest legends had male partners."
Draco had bowed back to his task, long fingers working with meticulous proficiency over the cameras as he settled and adjusted flicks and switches. His head tipped to peer at it sidelong, his blank focus was disturbed only by a slight frown, nearly lost behind the curl of his white-blond fringe that flopped across his brow.
"Huh?"
It didn't last long. Harry didn't know how anyone possibly could. His irrepressible gasps and moans, whimpers and garbled attempts to speak Draco's name, culminated in a fevered "Draco, I'm going to –" before he couldn't hold himself back. Eyes closing, hips jerking, his hand in Draco's hair tightening, Harry was seized by the peaking waves of pleasure that burst through him.
Maybe Harry was the weird one. Maybe there was something wrong with him. What kind of a person even considered doing such a thing with a classmate, let alone an old schoolyard rival?
That captivation careened sidelong, however, when Draco continued. "I'm a wizard, just like you," he said. "I knew you were, though you pretended you weren't. Or do you really, in all honesty, believe that what you do isn't real magic?"
"I figured," Harry said slowly, "that you might want me to."
A door. There was a door here, somewhere, surely.
Turning back to Draco, Harry met his bleary gaze as he too dredged himself from sleep. Regardless of a night spent in what was surely an uncomfortable position, he looked barely worse for wear, which was fairly typical of him. Harry could still remember in the war, at Malfoy Manor, even during his trial and that of his parents – Draco always fought to maintain a well-groomed, immaculate visage. A night spent on the floor, leaning against the wall with Harry draped over him like a misshapen blanket, had added only a faint stiffness to his movements as he rolled his shoulders, the barest of unruly tufts to his usually pristine hair.
"Sorry," Harry said, even if he was only half apologetic.
Jackie overrode them both. She jabbed a finger at them each respectively. "You think you're better than us. With all of your inheritance served on a fucking platter and your stupid snobbish names that you think puts you on a pedestal above your supposed inferiors. Well, let me tell
"Oh, it's glamourous enough, I suppose. Just not as much as most people think."
"Why not just try using their names?" Jill suggested.
"Well, that's… I guess that's one way to distract from the end of a horrifying exam."
James paused and Lily turned towards him. "So early?"
Ron had shrugged. It was a limp gesture, somehow melancholic, and almost seemed to sigh with feeling. "Just that, you know, I reckon they'd know not many of us would be all too keen to jump into duelling or defensive magic again. After everything."
"Draco?" Harry asked, breaking into the deadened silence of Draco's stagnated mind. "What are you…?"
"What?"
"But Malfoy has always been a git," Ron said, catching himself only on his last word and lowering his voice with a hasty glance over his shoulder. "Come on, Hermione, he's been a right ass to you especially, what with everything that he calls you. And to you too, Harry. How can you even say that?"
Draco had lost his voice. It was a little humiliating, but he hoped his curt nod gave him an impression of dignity rather than incompetency. He didn't even need to shoot Pansy a glance to know she saw straight through him. She always did. He could almost hear her unspoken words:
"She's my aunt." Draco's words were strangled, catching in his throat. "She was - she –"
"Only half a dozen?"
From where that drive had arisen, Draco didn't know. He didn't really care, but it was curious to consider the nature of one's innate drive. Draco had done just that over the years, latching onto all that presented itself as a potential source of perfection.
anymore. In hindsight, he didn't know why he'd ever done so. He knew that no good news pertaining to himself would come of it. Even if it was tempting to hear of Harry – that he'd supposedly disappeared? That he was being all but hounded by fans, paparazzi, and reporters? – the weight of the accusations that struck him became too much.
"Harry," he said, nodding his head shortly. It was more formal than he'd treated Harry all year, even if he did still use his proper name.
"Is he demanding?" Draco asked just as lowly.
"That's a no, then."
And Draco.
Harry had sighed, folded, and accepted her orders as were duly presented. He did remember, and though it was all a little ridiculous, almost embarrassing, precautions were set in place for safety reasons. He didn't want a near abduction incident again; the most recent attempt had been messy, and not only because the Muggle police got involved.
The carriage was the first display of magic he'd seen, and even that was unremarkable next to every other spell he'd ever seen.
"What about it?" he asked.
Nonetheless, that slightly stunned realisation didn't dampen Draco's instinctive urge to compare himself to those with magic behind their lenses more fervently than others. Draco knew the name and face of every witch and wizard photographer of note in London.
because she threw a literal leg over one too many laps."
Far from offended, Pansy's smirk widened, and Draco couldn't help but reply in kind. "Did you read the article?" she asked.
Opening his eyes, Harry stared down at the table directly before him. "About what?"
Her smile when she settled herself, crossing her legs and regarding him with a slight tilt of her head, demanded a reply in kind. Harry pasted his own upon his face accordingly before drawing his gaze back towards the backstage workers. The man with the light had decided to readjust the height of the umbrella structure just a little, which was interesting only insofar as it was something to look at.
Whether Harry was aware of Draco's dawdling intentions or not didn't really seem to have much sway over the fact that he slowed in step alongside him. However, instead of persisting with the light-hearted teasing he'd tossed about with increasing frequency over the past days, Harry remained silent. Silent and staring as, head turned and gaze drawn to the lake, he stared past Draco as though he barely noticed him at all.
"Oh, spare me," Hermione said, drawing a book from God only knew where and flipping it open.
Draco shrugged. "She's my mother. So, yes, it is, but I'd rather that than be house-bound for the rest of my life. Although, she's been forced to take a slight step back since I've come of age."
He knew he could do magic. Somehow, he could do it. He knew that he couldn't Apparate – he'd tried that – and that it could have something to do with the room. Wards were a thing, he'd learnt, and even if Draco hadn't spoken much of them, Harry had spent enough time alone with his thoughts recently to weave together every possible morsel of useful knowledge stored in his memory.
She wasn't working anymore, however. Tossing her pen onto her papers, she rocked back in her chair and regarded Harry with another pointed gaze. "Come on, then. Spill. How was your day?"
Draco nodded shortly. "She should just know. There was another poster…"
Lucerne was beautiful in a way that London wasn't. A foreign, captivating kind of beautiful. And yet for once, Harry barely saw it.
"But Harry, you're forgetting" Draco interrupted him.
"Don't scowl like that, Draco," Pansy said, breaking into his grumbling thoughts. "It's unbecoming. Besides, you don't want to scare Potter away as soon as he steps through the door."
"I don't know if I've changed my tune more or something, but it really doesn't bother me who you date, and I mean it." He settled back in his chair, straight again, and rocked on the back legs slightly. "A boy or girl, even my sister, it doesn't bother me. Definitely not the boy thing. You remember when Seamus and Dean properly hooked up, right?"
"Thanks," Harry said dryly. "In return, I won't call you an arrogant, stuck-up, aristocratic, pig-faced prat, even if that's what
Harry nodded.
"Malfoy," James growled. "What the bloody hell do you think you're doing in my house?"
"Are you always so sincere and appreciative this early in the morning?"
As head photographer on the job, Draco had his own space. It was hardly considerable, was little more than a section of the back rooms off the studio than any kind of office workspace, and had an only partially concealed view into the dressing rooms for the models in one direction and the consultation space in the other. But it was Draco's space, and he made do.
Draco uttered a strangled laugh of his own. "Do you always have to try and kill the mood, or are you just nervous as hell?"
was going to try and get an interview with them, but I don't know how successful they've been so far."
"Has it?" Harry asked.
"Almost," Draco said. "The Leaky Cauldron acts as a gateway between our world and theirs."
"Friendly?" someone else asked.
"A… potion?"
Draco nodded. "A year earlier than you."
"How much I know?" Harry shook his head. He couldn't help a huff of disbelieving laughter. "What does that even mean?"
Harry made a face. "Some. It's convincing the intruders to agree that's the hard part."
"Goddamn it," he muttered. "I'm blaming Mum when I get home."
"Huh. Well, I promise I won't make a habit of punctuality, then."
The sun was streaming across the dining table, capping the distant cliffs visible from the eastern window, by the time Harry lowered his fork to the table. At his side, Draco was sipping through his second cup of tea, half-turned in his seat towards Harry once more and regarding him quietly.
Harry blinked. Down? He didn't think so. What made him seem down? If anything, he felt a little unbalanced with his affliction of realisations that still dawned on him every other day, but he didn't think he was sad. "I'm fine," he said.
Stepping towards him, Harry held out his hand expectantly. Draco took it in an instant. "They're renting in Hogsmeade," he said as Draco turned, leading the way up the path from the carriage drop-off.
"You alright, Harry?" he asked
He'd smiled. Just slightly, barely perceptibly, but it was the most natural smile Draco had seen from him. Ever. A little quiet, a little sad, maybe a little thankful, and utterly real. Draco had never wanted to capture a moment with his camera more than then.
He wished he hadn't learned.
"My experience?" Harry echoed.
But fun? Harry wasn't sure if he'd ever called it fun.
Everything that had happened before, every word he'd flung at his parents for hiding magic and the Wizarding world from him, for lying to him, for persisting in denying him the truth, seemed so foolish now. So inconsequential. So cruel and unwarranted, because yes, Harry was angry, had been angry, but not anymore. Not in the face of everything that had followed. He couldn't be, because to see his parents after what had happened felt like the greatest reward in the world.
"Do you intend to impoverish me, Draco?" Pansy drawled as the man slipped silently towards the bar.
"Abel's got a nose like a bloodhound," Jackie said, picking at her teeth. "It would be a crime not to get him to use it."
Slipping away from the bar, Draco took a brief, circulatory turn around the tables scattering the floor before once more returning to the line of attendees with drinks in hand and companions at their shoulders. He saw the gap-toothed kid already attempting to chat up someone else. A short, wide man turned from the bar with his arms laden beneath glasses. A pair were in such violent, hysterical laughter that they looked to be nearly falling of their stools, and Harry –
Life, Harry had found, was far easier, far less objectionable, and far more peaceful when he simply let things happen. Rather than chaffing at the bit, it was easier just to stop fighting entirely.
The problem was that Harry didn't know how to feel. He didn't know what he was supposed to feel, nor what truly lay beneath the mess of his jumbled thoughts. What was between himself and Draco had been a matter of convenience, of comfort from simple contact but otherwise detached and unemotional. At what point it had begun to become something else, Harry didn't rightly know, except that he knew it had. He could realise that now.
Harry found that he became cold often. He'd asked Ginny if his skin felt chilled and she'd shaken her head with a bemused frown, but he still felt it. Not even cocooning himself tightly in a blanket helped to chase it away.
But it was out now. The Niffler was out of the bag. He may as well give it the go-ahead, even if the possibility of finding golden success was non-existent.
How he knew it was Harry even before he lifted his gaze, Draco didn't know. He couldn't have said, couldn't have explained it, and yet he knew. Whether it was a magical instinct – for he'd heard of such triggers before – or something else entirely, each time Harry was in the room Draco couldn't help but look at him.
The touch of fingers residually warm from the hotel as they curled around the back of Harry's neck in return.
"I'd just be starving," Ginny said, just as much.
He learned that McGonagall was a stronger woman than he'd even given her credit for. That the professors as a whole were stronger, even if Slughorn spoke with a bit of a quaver sometimes and the new Defence professor seemed to be at constant war with the precedent set before her. The students themselves were stronger, too, and it was apparent from the murmur of chatter at mealtimes that rose into real conversation and even natural laughter over the span of a single week.
Harry readily followed his silent suggestion. It was too easy to fall into Draco's lap. Too easy to lean against him, to soak up the warmth of his presence. Far too easy to press himself up against him, to wrap his arms around him in return and graze a kiss over Draco's neck. As with so many things between them, in such a short time what had seemed so ludicrously impossible became utterly natural. Harry withheld from obliging to that last with only a brief struggle.
contract that demanded he catch said bus for at least the final few stops to keep up the act.
There wasn't as much disgruntlement in Draco's tone as Harry would have anticipated, which was the only reason he didn't drop the subject immediately. They'd had a pleasant day so far. Fun, even. He didn't want to ruin it by having a debate and triggering Draco's aristocratic snottiness.
Nodding again, a little saddened yet somehow also satisfied, Harry turned from the Head Table to that placed just below it. Only to pause halfway down the dais stairs, scanning along the length of the parallel benches.
"Fantastic," Von said. He tugged the door open and hummed with sincere appreciation at the mint-green Invigoration Draughts filling the shelf in a perfect line. "He'll know I've taken one, won't he?"
"… seem to always be tagging along," Jill was saying, turning towards Harry with a squeeze of the arm she still had hooked in her own. "I think your mum and dad see me as a bit of a babysitter, don't they, Harry?"
"As am I!"
"What do you mean?" Harry had asked.
"Sixty inches isn't too bad for a transfiguration essay, really," Hermione said, frowning at Harry for a moment longer before turning to Ron. "Especially not for
Harry couldn't really blame her. He supposed he should have told her earlier – should have told both her and Jill – but it had never quite felt like the right time. How did anyone tell their friends that they've started dating someone who they'd all initially considered to be a bit of a tosser only a handful of months ago?
Harry slowly shook his head. He was so lost that he couldn't even begin to follow the direction of James' words. Prophecy? Draco's lord? What…?
"Draco, you –"
"How'd you find this place?" Harry asked.
Harry frowned. "Well, yeah. Magic was kind of my obsession when I was a kid."
Harry folded half a piece of toast into his mouth, skirting the table once more to where he'd discarded his school bag the previous afternoon. "Ah, yeah. That."
"A meeting at three o'clock," Pansy said. "Parkinson."
"You're not an imbecile, Ron."
"Bloody hell," he croaked, shaking his head before abruptly stopping. No, head-shaking definitely made him feel worse. "That was - that was a -"
Smirking, because his mother was so full of shit but he loved her only all the more for it, Harry accepted the plate from where his mother nudged him with it. Lily was the backbone, the brains, and the heart of their house; what she said was law. Harry had long ago discovered that her ferocity extended above and beyond overprotectiveness.
When Harry woke, he was warm.
"So, aren't you curious?"
"Visiting students?" Jackie asked, frowning.
"Hey! I'm not a fucking piece of meat, Ron."
"I don't think it's that," Jill said. "It's probably just because Hogwarts is a very old school."
Fuck. Fucking hell. He was in such a goddamn mess.
A lord. A prophecy. Harry had more time to think in the past days than he'd known what to do with. He didn't know much but he could make connections. This bloody lord, this bloody war, and the madwoman who had escaped punishment for what she'd done in that war and was now trying to – what?
Draco either ignored or didn't hear the sarcasm in his voice. He nodded. "Certainly. I'm not prejudiced against magic, but simply… curious as to how one such as yourself has come into possession of such capability." Draco's eyebrow twitched. "You're not a wizard. Surely."
With a start, Harry abruptly realised. He almost laughed at himself, almost kicked himself, for his oversight. Of course, Draco was talking about himself. About the war. About his inability to climb free of his ensnared and reluctant allegiance with Voldemort. In a way, it was reflective; Draco had been locked in a situation that had indeed hurt him, that had been a heinous danger to him, and that he'd longed to be free of. Perhaps he did know just a little bit. But the even bigger part…
"What the bloody hell are you doing here?" he blurted out.
"Morning, mate," Ron said, appearing at Hermione's side. "Have a good Christmas?"
"Because they're the bastards," Ron explained, wrinkling his nose.
"Hey. Hey, Harry, look at this."
"Ron, I won't," Harry said.
It was a challenge, and one unlike any he had faced before.
Draco rolled his eyes. "For someone who considers him to be infallible, I'd have expected you to be more accepting of his decisions."
"Well, yes, because they're fun. And interesting."
Enjoy the chapter, and hope to see you next time!
"Thanks, Mum," Harry mumbled, only half sarcastically.
Where the thought came from, Harry didn't know. He wasn't quite sure what triggered it, but instead of embarrassment, instead of anger, what welled forth was regret and something like shame. He wasn't ashamed to be fucking Sammy, not even really to have been found doing so, but that Draco had been the one to walk in on him? Somehow, it burned in places Harry hadn't even considered.
"She's right," Blaise said, slouching back in his seat. "She'll tell you even when you don't ask for it. Especially when, actually."
Once, Draco might have scoffed and agreed. He might have declared that he didn't bloody well want to have anything to do with Harry, and that he would get away from him if he could but that it was an opportunity that he couldn't miss. He might have even dropped the job that was like finding a diamond in a sea of sand, because Draco didn't care about Harry and the job wasn't worth the trouble.
Was it even an exchange program? What did it involve, exactly? And it was just the C&C class… right? Mrs. Joyce had been somewhat vague on the subject when she'd mentioned it all of once nearly three weeks ago.
"A photographer?" Draco asked quietly.
How things changed when looking through different lenses.
"Thanks," Harry said dryly.
"You'll give me your number this time?" Simon said just as quietly. Yet even in its quietness, Harry could hear the edge of a demand. A want. A need? Maybe not quite, but that forcefulness was definitely there.
"It's not like that," Harry said, turning hastily to the window once more.
Harry shook his head. "No, but they kind of guessed."
"Besides, what do you expect? I'm a model. Posing for the camera is what models do."
"Thank fuck, no." Harry closed his eyes in silent gratitude.
The seamless hybrid of a bird and horse was as fascinating as it was disturbing. It was very different to behold a representation to simply being told of the existence of such a creature. Widespread wings scattering golden sparkles like dust as they flapped, talons upon its bird-like front legs clawing the ground like a horse would count. Its sweeping tail of delicate hairs, each discernible identifiable as though they'd been individually conjured, shed its own wisps of gold.
Schopenhauer
"I don't mind, Draco," Harry said, still speaking to his knees. "You can think what you want. You can want what you want. But please don't let that get in the way of me helping you when I can. I can't do much, but in this instance…" He paused, squeezed his wand briefly, before releasing it. His eyes flickered up just briefly, peering at Draco through the layers of his long fringe and his glasses that Harry's makeup artist Von would likely have been horrified to see all but masked his face. "Tell me what I can do."
Lily didn't quite manage a smile, but it was close. "He seems lovely, Harry."
"Uh-huh."
"And follow Jill's direction when in doubt. She's the only one out of the three of you with a sensible head on her shoulders."
Draco swallowed. That knot in his belly tightened sickeningly, but he couldn't deny what it meant. "Yes. Somehow. Impossibly."
"When you said that. I don't know for sure but it kind of felt like it." When Draco didn't reply, he asked again. "Did you?"
"That's because no one else likes them."
The hum Draco offered in return was so multi-layered with longing and sincerity that it tingled against Harry's lips. It was only added to by the slide of his hands around Harry's waist, his thumbs hooking into his waistband not with insinuation but simply to hold. Just to have that contact of skin on skin without the thin barrier of Harry's slacks.
It was tight. A brief moment of painful. Foreign and not at all like his own fingers. A muted sound uttered from Draco, but Harry barely heard him. His ears were deafened with his own rapid heartbeat, with his deliberately slow breaths that repeated
Zabini raised his own shoulder in a shrug, and Malfoy didn't reply, so Harry wriggled himself onto the bench. Or attempted to; he seemed to have drastically over-estimated how much room was actually available.
Drawn from his attentiveness, Draco glanced across the wide – ridiculously wide – spread of the foyer that mimicked the lake beyond the window almost eerily. An equally wide desk, of darkwood and shining with polished reflectiveness, stretched along the wall adjacent to the elevator. A single young man sat behind it, perfectly groomed in a tailored suit and blinking at them with quizzically raised eyebrows and open expectation.
Harry stared. Eyes locked on the wand in James' hand, he couldn't look away. Every other thought – of embarrassment, of sex, of pity both for himself and for Draco for being caught in such a compromising situation – faded into negligibility because… because Harry's
"No. He shouldn't have been in charge of that."

"Talk to me later," Dot said, ignoring Harry entirely and pointing her pen at Draco. "I'm not utterly oblivious, but even so."
"Will we be compensated?" Draco asked.
For Harry, too. He knew he was changing, if only slightly and slowly. It was nothing deliberate, but there was a distinct sense of recovery to be found in the aftermath of school stress, an affliction that only a year before he would never have seen himself prioritising. For the most part, that took the form of sleep. And where Harry found sleep was, unerringly, with Draco.
Harry's stare flattened. Like a hawk glaring at its foe, he stared at Draco unwaveringly, and Draco couldn't look away. If anything, he felt almost spellbound, his breath catching in his throat, and might have even been tempted to retract his words had it persisted any longer for longer than a few seconds.
Once more, Harry peeked over his enfolding arms. It was perhaps the strangest conversation he and Ron had ever held, far more intimate than he'd thought either of them capable of – or at least with one another. But Ron didn't seem to have a problem with it, and Harry clasped the opportunity to smear out a niggling worry that had been prodding him for days with both hands.
Then he was stepping around Harry and strode down the adjacent corridor, head tucking and automatically returning to his dodging act once more. Harry stared after him for a moment. It was almost disconcerting how easily Draco accepted that he was shunned. There was pride in the way Draco held himself, in his work ethic, and his self-conduct, but there was also something like subservience. It was somehow saddening.
a better person, from his prejudice against Muggles and Muggleborns to helping Harry through his own struggles. Whether it was natural to him or something he'd only explored since he and Harry had been dating was uncertain, but that he tried at all meant something.
For a moment, Draco didn't speak. Neither did Harry. Instead, he blinked down at him as Harry stared up in return, before stepping to the opposite side of the window and lowering himself to the ground.
Ron snickered, but he didn't say anything further. Amusement was still radiating from him for a long time thereafter, however, and Harry found that he didn't really mind, in spite of being the butt of it. It added a much-needed lightness to the night as he dove back into heavier thoughts.
Slipping silently up the stairs, Lily padded on muffled feet towards Harry's bedroom. She would just peer inside, would just check that he hadn't accidentally kicked one of his Sirius-cursed toys from his bed. He'd latched onto the three Sirius had given him for his birthday with a vengeance; Lily's sleep had been disrupted more than enough times over the past months to risk leaving them scattered about the floor where he couldn't reach them should he awaken.
The dining table was a little scratched and scuffed at the edges, despite the heavy, respectable wood of its make. The chair Harry sat in had squeaked slightly when he sat down. The blinds didn't quite fit the window, there was a hint of weathering to the glass, and throughout the conjoined rooms that Harry could see from where he sat were elements of life, of disrepair, of carelessness that seemed to suit the version of Draco that sat across from him.
Draco's voice, a murmur so skewed and muted it was barely words at all, hummed against Harry's shoulder. He glanced down at him, at Draco's face still lax with sleep. "It's nothing," he said, lips brushing over the top of Draco's head in a feather light kiss. "Go back to sleep."
Just like that. All at once, just like that, everything within Draco seemed to freeze. The air that swept around them, running fingers through Draco's hair, was chilling. The scent of the lake was sharp and crisp, the shuffle of trees further up the shoreline rising in oblivious whispers. But Draco barely noticed any of it. He had attention only enough for Harry's stare as it swung back towards him and the words that still rested upon his parted lips.
A respite. A break. Even after year it still felt like such a novelty. Why had no one prepared her for how exhausting wrestling with a child was everyday? They'd
It was all of that. Draco wasn't as much of a prat as the prefect Ron Weasley would have had him believe.
"Okay, Professor Lupin," Harry said, sighing long-sufferingly, "I know that you've got a thing for education and everything, but can you keep it at work please?"
Harry didn't know. He didn't know how he'd managed it but he abruptly didn't car because a moment later Jacob, and then Keith, and then Bruce appeared around the back building, charging like a heard of angry bulls. Even with the fence between them, Harry was pushing himself to his feet in an instant, staggering slightly before lurching into a run for the nearest side-street. Adrenaline still throbbing through him with every heartbeat, his breath shaking with every inhalation, but he only picked up pace as the shouts chased him.
Draco shrugged. "I told you, I observe. It lends itself to knowing certain things."
"Actually, I was chosen," Draco corrected. Which he had been, of a sort. By Pansy, yes, and there was a degree of nepotism that he preferred not to consider too closely, but Harry and Picard had accepted him. Picard seemed to almost approve of him nowadays.
But were they? Was he really an equal in their eyes? If they'd kept something from him, something so big, what else hadn't they told him?
Draco might want many things, but he wouldn't demand. He wouldn't force. Once upon a time he might have, maybe, but not anymore. Never. Never anymore. Not with Harry.
It was only then that Harry really noticed the rest of the room, and he unconsciously loosened his arms around Draco. Only then that he saw Pansy staring at them with an unwavering gaze, saw Neville and Hannah sparing them intermittent glances as they whispered to one another, noticed Seamus openly staring with amusement brightening the weary lines of his face.
Harry pulled a face as Lily finally rose to her feet and rebuffed James' increasingly loud exclamations. "It could have gone worse."
"Regardless," Draco was saying, "Harry and I will likely have to continue to work on the project over the break, despite our efficiency."
"Sorry about that again, Harry," he said, lowering his voice again even though, if anything, the intensity of the rain had increased. "It would have been nice if you'd had a proper partner for the Potions project."
"Reasonable? No. No, I won't lower myself –"
Draco smiled, dropping his gaze to Harry's hand and turning it over in his own. "Of course."
"It wasn't just me. Ron helped out a whole lot, and Professor Dumbledore's bird."
But that wasn't as bad as the disaster that arose when the prying attempts of an interviewer had discovered that he and Ginny were no longer dating. "We're still definitely friends, and maybe we could have been something more if we'd tried, but… we're headed in different directions. And Ginny has a career ahead of her, so –"
"What?"
"But?" Harry asked when Dot didn't offer it herself.
"McGonagall," the teacher supplied. "And you are…?"
He had a pointed chin and a sharp nose. He clearly looked down that nose too, his gaze incessantly hooded and lips pressed in a line when he wasn't speaking in a drawl. He was so pale he likely burned as soon as he stepped in the sun, his hair was barely a shade darker.
Pansy only hummed in reply, but the slight narrowing of her eyes, the way she watched the man named Von plant himself between Potter and Draco's chairs, bellowed her disgruntlement. Or it did to Draco, at least.
"Yeah, but it always dies on me."
"Get back inside," Von said, half turning his head to glance over his shoulder. "Just leave your bike today."
Harry didn't know, but he didn't ask. Or he didn't get the chance to, because Draco was speaking again, and his words were the best distraction that Harry had ever heard. "Would you like to get something to eat for lunch? It's midday already."
Harry didn't know what a Slytherin was but he didn't care. He barely considered his ignorance at all, however; it was difficult to draw his thoughts from that single word and the struggle it took to withhold a smile.
Draco almost couldn't believe it. He stared, and stared, and stared at the static, utterly Muggle picture, and even as the features that were all too familiar to him became gradually more apparent, he still didn't think he could believe it. To think that Potter – that
He hadn't seen them in a week. A whole week following the shoot at which some tosser named Erik Jackdawson had gotten his wand in a knot over what Ron termed 'the Harry Potter Debacle'. It was spoken of with many an eyeroll between them, many a sigh and a shaken head, but neither Harry nor his friends denied the truth of Ron's formalisation. It wasn't the first time a wizard-reporter had climbed up on his high horse in what they deemed to be a 'preservation of what was purely of the Wizarding world and not for Muggle usurping'.
