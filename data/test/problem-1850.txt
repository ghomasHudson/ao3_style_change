"Of course it's fine. Why wouldn't it be?" He beckoned her in, and Draco straightened up uncomfortably on the desk under the girl's scrutiny.
"Yes, we will be experimenting with a very
"Do they cause extreme excitement?" another Gryffindor mumbled in the back. His friend smacked him.
Harry wondered if there weren't any magical remedies for whatever caused the issues with her hands. Perhaps muscle tremors? He had never thought of it before, but surely there must be — especially since wizards tended to live so long. But if there were, wouldn't Zylphia have used them?
Harry put down his trunk and jumped at Draco, trying to wrestle him to the floor.
This effort quickly went out the window and he began staring at the wall behind Professor Ludgor's head, letting the sounds blend together into a background lull. Everything around him seemed to melt and became varying shades of red wax bleeding together. He couldn't actually
I really hate storms," Harry finally muttered, tearing his gaze away from the window to look at Draco. "You okay?"
Harry had dawdled around, putting off firecalling Ron and Hermione as long as possible. He'd taken a shower, and made himself an elaborate breakfast, and then washed the dishes by hand. He'd even
"Draco, I really would love too, but I promised Ron I would go to the Weasleys' this year. I've already skipped two years in a row, and Molly's beginning to get hurt over it. Ron told me he'd come and drag me over on Christmas Eve if he had to, and I'm expected to stay until Boxing Day."
"Well that depends," Ginny responded patiently. "You can't get rid of everything, but you can get rid of certain types of thoughts, maybe. What exactly do you want to fix?"
"Well I don't know about
Harry snorted. "Maybe the old, polished Draco could've pulled that off, but nobody's going to believe for a second that

"Thank you. Um, see you after break...Professors."
Harry rolled over in his sleep, curling against Draco's side, and Draco's eyes finally started to droop, comforted by the warmth and closeness.
"Sure." Draco pulled him back down, and that was the end of talking for quite some time.
"It's fun, I'll say that," Draco said, tilting the paper so he could read as well. "So far they've not-so-subtly implied I probably drugged you three times. I'm about halfway down the page."
"Yeah, he's my godson. He's almost eight and a

Harry leaned back toward Draco and murmured in his ear. "If you're such a fan, I think a repeat performance can be arranged when we get home."
“Where’s Angelina, then?” Harry looked about for her. “I’m sure she’d be happy to beat you all into the dust.”
"When on earth did you do that? And how didn't I notice? Well...I suppose they were never the most verbal..."
Poor Pomona had had to come out of retirement when he left for lack of wizards knowledgeable on herbology and passionate enough to want to teach it.
Harry slung an arm around Draco's shoulders, and Draco turned to look at him. Glancing quickly at the press outside, he spoke in Harry's ear.
Harry was sitting on the bed, staring at the open wardrobe.
, and that just made it seem so...so like he and Harry were that kind of forever couple.
"MERLin's saggy...cloak," he censored himself.
Now, Ron and Hermione were sitting on the sofa in the living room, waiting for Draco to bring back drinks. Which Harry had taken the opportunity to excuse himself to go 'help him' with.
He quickly skimmed the article. Blah blah something about them looking handsome and in love, blah blah what a surprise, blah...St. Mungo's?
"You're sure? I'm not sure three fingers is the same—"
way to contact me, so I had to figure it out.'
This year, however, it wasn't sly actions or suggestive comments that got the students talking.
"I've always been partial to the 'try and see' approach, but you'd better give it your all just in case."
He flopped down on it. His room would do — it wasn't like he was going to need it for anything more than sleeping anyway. From his spot on the bed he could see a cramped bathroom through a doorway to his right. Again, it would do. He thought he really ought to start putting his things away and go down to set up his classroom, but putting things off was always so much easier. He rolled over onto his stomach, but groaned and got up when his trunk stabbed him in the ribs.
Draco let go, and Harry pushed a few fingers back in to make sure he was properly stretched.
"Are they, you know," he made a vague motion with his hands, "together?"
Harry cocked his head and Draco's eye twitched as he stared at her.
," he snapped.
Autumn had practically flown by, and whilst Draco had moved into Harry's room, they still didn't get to be intimate as often as they'd like. Things were busy: there was teaching all day and then marking papers, and finalising lesson plans, plus there was a need to get enough sleep that doing the same thing all over again the next day was possible. However, with the winter holidays nearly upon them, they had managed a night to themselves.
"It's hard to explain, I don't know quite how to describe any of it." His shoulders slumped.
"I had the feeling I was still missing something though, but I think I've got it now. You're not the touchy type, or an open person...yes, you've definitely been flirting. I wasn't positive the first day, but there's no way it hasn't been intentional. You want to date me and piss everyone off. I know you and your little hero complex: you don't believe that you're special and deserving of all this reverence, and it
And he kissed him.
"Well at least she can read; I'm not entirely convinced you even know how."
"Damn, you even turned my own boyfriend against me."
"No, you're not," Draco agreed, sighing and walking off whilst muttering about Apparating under the influence.
"I know you had something to do with that, and I'll not be convinced otherwise."
Harry blinked his eyes open as Draco kissed his forehead.
"You okay?"
"Is it worth it?" Draco shot back.
"Was a little preoccupied," Harry mumbled.
"That was unnecessary, Harry," Hermione frowned.
It was wonderful.
Harry let out a laugh before he could stop himself, and pushed Draco's shoulder. "Merlin's pants, you're fucked in the head." He spied his robes from yesterday in a heap on the floor, and he remembered—
The wood was cool on his skin as Harry rolled his face against the table — with a hand on an open book, of course, so he couldn't be accused of doing
Draco waved. "Erm..." he settled for a questioning look around the room. Everything seemed in control — not that he didn't trust Harry in the kitchen, just that he didn't often...cook. It looked like he was making a stir-fry though, and it smelled good. "Was there some sort of special occasion?" he half-shouted to be heard over the abominably loud fan in the extractor hood above the stove.
. Here's your extendables," Sophie held them out.
"I really don't think that's any of your business. Can I buy the ring or not?"
Draco laid on the sofa, hands over his face, thinking of all the reasons everything he was currently doing in life was the Worst Idea Ever™.
"Please don't tell professor McGonagall," Harry asked the students quickly. "He's very tired."
Harry dropped the hand from Draco's mouth, and pressed a kiss to his cheek. "It won't take them long to warm up to you, I know it. They're all very nice, and they love me, so I'm sure they will be very willing to give you the benefit of the doubt."
"I'm not sure that would be a great idea. Like how would I even approach that. 'Hey mate, want to meet up with Hermione, the literal Minister for Magic, so I can reintroduce you to her as the guy I'm always shagging when she and Ron want to go out for drinks?'" Although, that wasn't quite all he was, Harry realised. They'd ended up doing quite a lot of talking besides just the sex and, well, Harry felt that they'd sort of become friends.
"No, thank you." Harry waved them off, and Draco quirked an eyebrow but didn't comment.
"That was a bit odd," Draco said, sliding into the booth that Hermione had vacated across from him. "Something I wasn't supposed to hear?"
"Wouldn't dream of it," Harry said blithely. "So is that a no?"
"Hmm, must be a leak in the ceiling," Harry said wryly.
Hermione shrugged again, looking tired. "Of
Harry was backing up and feeling for his chair with one hand. He sat and brought Draco onto his lap, trying to break the kisses as few times as possible. "Get these off," Harry gasped between kisses, vaguely pulling upward at Draco's robes.
Harry offered a couple treats, and Bartholomew gobbled them down agreeably silently. "You

"What? Mate, are you...okay? Like, did he slip you something? This is all so...where did this come from? We didn't even know you two were," he paused, seemingly unsure what to call it, "together?"
"Glad you stayed?"
"I couldn't see hardly anything," a Gryffindor complained.
After several still, silent minutes, Draco lifted his head. "Merlin's left tit."
"Whenever you like,

"Thank you, Harry dear, you're always so helpful," Molly said, waving a bowl of potatoes into the sink with her wand.

“Well
Needless to say, many of the students had been intrigued by the flowers in Professor Potter's office, and they were delighted when Professor Longbottom announced that, in the spirit of the holiday, they would be studying what certain plants symbolised. The flowers had to be from Professor Malfoy, and they were itching to know exactly what they meant.
He took the paper, and offered the owl a treat, which it accepted, before taking off out the window.
"Ugh. Fine. In a few."
"You're an

, yes."
The other three burst out laughing as Harry fumed, although there was no real anger behind it.
"Oh," Harry's face dropped slightly. He'd been hoping Draco would stick around a bit longer. "Okay. See you later then?"
On second thought, he'd better not try. It was bound to be horrendously addictive.
Zylphia pointed her wand at the sign on the door to flip it to 'CLOSED'.
"Ugh." Harry groaned to himself. Goulash
"Merlin," Harry muttered, shucking off his pyjama bottoms and pulling on the jeans. "The things I let you talk me into."
"Can I eat you out?"
"All I can make out is some mumbling."
The week up until Christmas was mostly filled with talking to Draco (when he wasn't marking essays). Since they didn't have any new classes, it was hard to keep up the pretense that they only talked to brag that they were better than the other. Their conversations slowly morphed into more normal things, like the Ministry of Magic and how its leadership seemed somewhat competent for once, and professional Quidditch leagues, and how Neville may be returning to his post as Herbology professor the next year, after having spent two years researching plants in the Amazon.
Harry followed them reluctantly, but was also secretly pleased that they still clearly wanted to
"Ah! Alright then." The shopkeeper opened the case, and pulled out the thin gold ring. "This one has a protection charm! Nice and understated; perfect for you. Let's get your size and you can try it on."
"Wow, you really never pass up a chance to inflate your own ego, do you?"
Harry didn't know whether he should be offended that Draco was treating the ring like a particularly nasty potion you'd plug your nose for and down all in one go. He thought it best not to press the issue though.
Draco had a different technique for dealing with his students. As soon as his Fifth Years took their seats for the first lesson, he turned from the board and shot all of them his most terrifying glare.
"Please, Lavinia, it's Harry. And it's Sunday, so I always show up, don't I?"

They were very well behaved for the remainder of class. Just in case.
The students just stood there until Harry finally said something to break the silence.
They stayed like that for several minutes until Harry spoke up.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Come on, I was joking."
." Draco and Harry spoke at the same time.
He found he really was quite sleepy even despite the discomfort, and drifted off still clutching Harry's hand.
After nearly an hour and a half of Draco slowly inching along several sections, an abundance of tongue clucking and exasperated book-slamming, and plenty of unintelligible mumbling, Draco finally straightened and tucked two books under his arm.

decided not to be together."
In the end, he wore a t-shirt and jeans like what Draco had worn last time. He just hoped that was the usual for him, and that Draco wouldn't have his heart set on going anywhere nice.
Apparently Draco Malfoy would be knocking at his door.
Of course Draco had the tiniest bird that somehow managed to be more intimidating than Minerva McGonagall herself, and with more frank personality than Harry had ever seen in an animal. Perhaps it was sensitive about its size; it really couldn't have been more than six inches tall altogether, although it was quite plump.
"Chill mate, that's not that big a deal. I know you don't usually, but that's actually normally how it goes."
"What, er, what's going on with you and the other Mr. Potter? Both of you are all...I don't know. You look like you haven't slept in ages, and you're always coming to classes late. Are both of you okay?"
They watched as twenty or so students crowded around a large table near theirs.
Harry sighed. "Need help getting to the bathroom?"
group in there. "What was the newest one from them?”
"I'm so sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going— Potter?"
Draco finally straightened and leaned back against Harry's desk with his arms crossed. "Why?" he asked simply.
Every Friday he made Pepperup Potion and a hiccoughing solution, as well as the four aforementioned ones. He found that the Friday brewing was his favourite part of his job; there was something about the slow, methodical, solitary work that set him at ease.

"Are you okay? You should really eat something, Harry."
Molly turned away, seemingly to mind one of the pots on the stove, and replied absently, "Of course, dear."
Draco pulled back after a second. "I've really got to brush my teeth, this baking soda tastes so fucking bad."
Harry rolled his eyes and started in on his dinner.

Well that was pretty depressing. Draco wasn't sure how to respond to that.

As Draco strode out of the hall, two Sixth Year Gryffindors excitedly took notice.
The old bartender didn't look up from the glasses he was cleaning as he spoke.
"You can nod."
"Why? They're my books."
"No, no it's not, it's just something we...I'm sorry."
"Great," Harry groaned. "What luck."
"Ah, we'll have to take a rain-check. I forgot, we have to see how our appearance at the Ministry Gala last night was taken," Draco said, casting about for change on his desk, and dropping a knut into the coin pouch on the owl's leg.
Harry turned around in surprise and beamed. Apparently it wasn't

looking equally uncomfortable, and nervously rubbing his left arm. Ah, Harry supposed he was right to be afraid that parents would say hateful things about a former Death Eater teaching at Hogwarts. Surely some would, but Harry hoped it wouldn't be too bad. If Draco had been acquitted, and Harry had found it within himself to speak in Draco's defence at his trial, then the rest of the Wizarding World should have no problem accepting that it was safe for him to teach their children.
Hermione had talked a lot with Draco about her work in the Ministry pushing for more creature's rights and protections, and then Harry had asked if they had any news about how wedding planning was going, which led both Ron and Hermione into long rants about how much work it was — not that they weren't excited!

Ron and Ginny would definitely be furious. He had no idea
“Yeah, just a second.” Harry grabbed his scarf from the table and wrapped it around his neck as he headed back up to the front. “Bye Zylphia, see you Monday!”
He let go of her and embraced Ron. "Please don't be too mean. He's trying."

Alright, so maybe that last part wasn't incredibly realistic, but hey, weren't people supposed to strive for the ideal?
. Sure, healing might be a process, but really what was the point if he didn't know if any of Hermione's suggestions would work at all? He'd have to drag it out for a long time because she'd say it works slowly, and he'd have to be so uncomfortable throughout all of it because he couldn't just do what he
The whole thing was such a farce anyway; Harry had already been living there for the past couple weeks. He'd set the date in the 'anonymous tip' to the Prophet a bit later to give them some time to figure things out. Not that it had really helped — they'd ended up winging everything anyway.
"No lady," he repeated distantly, and pointed. "Could I see that one?"
. They were all expected to marry someone of the 'opposite' gender and have children. Molly even still harped on Charlie, not believing that he just wasn't interested in anyone. She always insisted that all of her boys would find a nice girl (and that Ginny would find a nice boy) and settle down before they got too old, as if that was a comfort.
Harry's mouth twitched in amusement at the last bit, but he managed to keep his face impassive for the most part.
She just raised an eyebrow.
"It's not about

"Smooth, Potter," he said, heavy with sarcasm, but he wriggled out of his shirt nonetheless.
"Where Dada?" she asked, vaguely making reaching grabby hands.
Harry rinsed the glass and set it in the dish drainer with the spoon, before turning back to look at him. "You're not that person anymore. You've done so much work on yourself
"Um...over here. Sorry, this is...distracting. Being stared at by everyone." He pulled Harry over to the tables with arithmancy books.
He wasn't sure quite how he was supposed to convey the steely expression on Zylphia's face when he told Draco to open the backlog of letters on his desk, but he was sure he'd figure out something. And besides, the New Years get-together
She shrugged. "I figured it wasn't really mine to tell."
"Take off your boxers for me and lay back."
The picture was unmistakably him — with his flower-covered Dark Mark pressed against the window pane where he'd gripped the sill for balance, there was no arguing it was anyone else.
He had become quite the loner in his off time, and quite honestly he preferred reveling in the lack of work to do rather than hanging out with his friends. What he

He could teach them how to narrow down their dark magic detection spells to indicate the intended effects of the cursed object. They could talk about what the effects would be if someone came into contact with the object, and the difference if they were magical or Muggle, and how to counteract the effects. He could go over how to render the object harmless without falling prey to it magic. There were so many opportunities, and his inner Hermione was thriving. Needless to say, he was excited for Valentine's Day.
His other hand was released, and he let it fall into his lap, and then Harry was kissing his chest softly and untying the blindfold. He ran his hand over Draco's cheek and gently kissed his mouth, stroking over his shoulder, and through his hair — anywhere he could reach.
"Hmm... okay." Rodya said, in a valiant attempt at support. "Is it working?"
"What?" Harry was rather confused. He had no idea where that had come from — he tried to think back to anything he or Draco might have said before, but couldn't remember anything relevant.
"Uh-uh, you know better," Draco said, levelling a finger at the bird. He paused a moment, making sure Bartholomew understood, before dropping another kiss on his head.
"No it's just...er, I suppose it's in my head, but it seems real. It's just this red wax that comes dripping down and covers my entire body, and then everything is just pain. It's kind of peaceful once you get used to it."
"The blasted dragon," Draco panted, catching his breath. "I don't think he's a fan of you."
"Like I said, you're a big boy, learn some control," he bit out, trying to focus on slowing his heart and calming the adrenalin flooding his system.

He didn't know how he felt about Malfoy, honestly. He was stuck between holding onto the old rivalry out of his own stubbornness and bitterness, and feeling actual sympathy for him. Looking back, Malfoy had been horrible to him, Ron, Hermione, and a lot of other underserving people; but he was not only raised by, but also raised to

"Thanks for the scare, Zylphie, don't you know better than to sneak up on me? I could've ruined the potion, and that'd be your loss — I certainly wouldn't pay for it," he responded mildly.
"I also never thought I'd say I missed being able to cross reference the book of the Sacred Twenty-Eight," Draco grumbled, still pacing the room. "Even

He stepped inside, grabbed one of his kebabs, and opened up the window whilst holding out the kebab like a peace offering. Bartholomew ruffled his feathers (presumably in indignance at being left outside), but seemed to accept the offering.
“Well if the goal was to make you both cry, I guess I succeeded.”

Harry opened his eyes slightly. “Do what?”
"Mmh I wanna fuck you."
that was very dangerous. Draco could already feel he'd forgiven him entirely for abandoning him at breakfast, and for cuddling with Ron and Hermione instead of him. Dammit.
Of course, after the shower, he found himself stalling once again, though he wasn't quite sure
Harry dug through the pile of wrapped gifts on the cushion beside him for a few seconds, before giving up and holding his hand out for the right present to come to him. He handed Draco the lumpy parcel that had flown into his hand and smiled.
"What?"
"Should've realised; Draco's talked about you. You're his roommate, right?" she continued, brightly.
"I'm aware."
He once again left and the students were, of course, still lurking. He shot them his coldest glare, and continued down to the dungeons to clean up the mess.
He'd been out in the field all day, chasing after the heads of a wizard trafficking ring. The whole case was horrid and had given Harry quite a few nightmares, but those sneaky bastards were always slipping out of their grasp at the last moment. Harry supposed it would be awhile again before they caught onto their new trail.
He topped off and corked the last of the vials, placing them in a box to bring to the front. It was nearly closing time and he doubted someone would come in so late. It would be terribly inconsiderate to do so, in Harry's opinion.
And then Draco was on him, claiming his mouth for his own, and stealing his breath away. And honestly? Harry didn't much mind.
was discussing it, and Harry was listening with more interest that he would have previously thought), as the bartender wiped down the countertop.
"You know, if you ever need to talk, I'm here. Or if you need a quiet place to be alone, I found quite a few last year that I could show you?"
"That should get the point across," Draco said lightly.
He laughed as Harry continued trying to push his hand off of the desk, and continued lecturing dramatically.
If you missed it, there are also 2 lovely fan arts (by
He looked back up to the shopkeeper, who just blinked at him, still holding the ring over the case.

Harry let out a huff of laughter. "No, but sometimes I wonder if you're too prideful to use it in bed for fear of sounding like a fool."
He rolled over, and opened his eyes.
a few months ago?"
Draco sighed. "Ridiculous," he muttered, and then raised his voice to normal volume, turning away from the records he'd been aimlessly stacking and restacking. "You know I can hear you, right?"
Harry yawned. "Yeah. Prob'ly should."
He felt Draco's lips curve in a small smile. "I love you too."
very handsome, aren't you," Harry murmured, stroking the side of his face with a fingertip, and Bartholomew preened. He was beginning to think maybe Draco was right about how much the bird understood sometimes.
A large group of chattering friends pushed through the door just as Harry was following Draco inside, and he placed a hand on Draco's waist to gently bring him to the side so they could pass without jostling him.
Draco sighed, realising yet again how utterly buggered he was. Harry had him wrapped around his finger and didn't even realise it. He dearly hoped this didn't blow up in their faces.
"Harry. Shut up and go to sleep."

"Love, not that I'm not enjoying this, but I can't feel my leg."
the parselmouth! You little sneak, you should've been sorted into Slytherin!"
She looked down her nose at them.
Harry made a mental note not to argue next time Hermione told him he had awful taste.
He'd hoped at the time they'd bought it that it would be a family home, but now it never would (at least, not for him), and he almost felt like he was letting the house down. He didn't want to go back to Grimmauld Place (although he still held onto it, he'd just let Kreacher have the run of the place), and finding and buying a new place just seemed like so much trouble when he was already here. So for now he stayed.

"You don't have to be patronising. Can't I be happy sometimes?"
living in the Muggle world. Things could get worse, sure, and I bet they will at first. After a while though, it's possible I won't be so shunned any more — I mean you
He went to wash his hands off, and flopped back onto the sofa. So, right back where he'd begun: bored and annoyed.
Class with Slughorn had not been particularly pleasant for Harry for a number of reasons. Firstly, Professor Slughorn was still under the impression that Harry was a potions genius because he had done exceptionally well during Sixth Year due to using the old textbook of an
"Yeah, but it's been multiple days with me seeing them multiple times each day. It's kind of a lot when you compare it to not seeing anyone ever," Harry's tone became a bit sharp.
Harry sighed.
He had only rolled his eyes when Harry had asked and said, 'Well I really didn't have a choice — my coworkers have to have
Draco answered slowly. "I didn't understand at first, but the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. And then you gave me all the confirmation I needed today. I know you've never liked the attention and fame, even if it took me a while to realise that, and I see how often you're still in the Prophet. I know plenty of people still talk about you, and the Weasleys have always been up your arse — I doubt that's changed. You broke up with your girlfriend, and I don't think that was part of the plan, but it was the start. I think you realised you didn't actually have to live your life according to everyone else's idea of what it should be. And then you quit the Auror department, and now you're hanging out with me.
There was just so much that could go
Draco supposed maybe he should have exercised a bit more patience in the moment, but...no, he was still going to blame everything on Harry.
Draco shrugged again. "I'm never going to be seen as anything else."
that this was just Harry going through a rebellious phase, and that he didn't really have feelings for Draco, but it could be so easy to fall into the acting. He knew he was a fool for letting himself flirt so shamelessly with Harry under the guise of it being just for the press, but he had been even more foolish for letting Harry talk him into actually kissing him. For the last eight or so hours, throughout his entire shift, all his brain had seemed capable of was replaying it in his head, wanting more, and telling himself how stupid he was for it all.

Harry looked confused.
never seen one."
They played Exploding Snap in Harry's classroom to pass the time before the Welcome Feast, and they were still laughing and brushing ashes from their hair when they entered the Great Hall together and sat down.
"Really? I don't think I've ever noticed."
. Interest in anything just didn't seem like a reality to Harry anymore.
"Yes, hopefully mine won't be laced with anything,"
She had every right to be angry, but Harry supposed she had gotten the memo that he wasn't functioning well and was treating him delicately. Not that he needed it. He was fine, and he wished she would just yell at him for being a terrible boyfriend or something already, but it was clear she wasn't going to today.
"Now that doesn't sound like you really mean it."
"Wait, you stayed up the entire night? We had double Potions the next day, and didn't you have an Arithmancy test?"
"Right. How could I forget he was your godson? You're all tied up in half of the pureblood families there are! You're like a Potter, a Weasley, and a Black all in one."
"Dinner."
"Well we can clarify! It was just a gift! I just thought you'd like it."
"Yeah, well that's not quite like you. You could've at least told us," he said, sounding hurt. "And did you stay up all night again?" he added, taking in Harry's fully clothed state and glasses.
His eyes had found Draco across the room, as he spoke, and they were disgustingly tender. George made a face.
"Thanks," Draco replied blandly.
In a way, he missed it. He used to have such an easy and comfortable relationship with his best friends and he wanted to just be able to talk and laugh with them again. Another part of him despised the fact that he wanted things to be calm and relatively content again.
"Really? I don't believe you for a second. Even as hapless as you were in school, nothing adds up otherwise."
"Oh shush, you're a delight," he deadpanned, although he wasn't really joking. "And it wasn't that scary."
"It was...a badger," Harry said seriously.
"Wait, that actually makes sense. Why does that make so much sense?" Rob asked.
Neville, who had stepped up and taken the brunt of many punishments — must have incomparably more. But of course, Harry knew he only ever thought about himself, only ever assumed
And if you missed what inspired this fic, it was

"Merlin, Harry, it was all right there, nothing was a secret! I guess you were always just wrapped up in your head though. A lot was happening then." Ron grew quiet.
Draco sat. "Um... Alright, I guess. She ended up staying home today, but she seemed her usual self, so hopefully it's not too bad. She and Rodya want us to come over for dinner some time; Rodya said they've only met you in passing."
"I'm not sure what you're referring to, Charlotte."

He set a plate on the table under a warming charm for Draco, and brought his with him to sit in front of the fire. All he needed to do was
"Night Harry!" Everyone remaining awake chorused.
"Tomorrow's front page on the Daily Prophet." Draco wiggled the fingers on his left hand with a slight frown. "It may have been my fault."

"Hello, what can I do for you?"
"Do I want to know where the dragon is?" Ron muttered.

. You're not being a bad friend by sharing with me."
"No, I hadn't said?"
"What does it do?" Arthur asked interestedly, and Draco hesitantly turned back to him. Fuck. Now he was going to have to have a full-on conversation with the head of the Weasley clan (who he'd never even directly spoken to, as far as he could remember) completely by himself about Muggle technology he barely understood himself. Oh, Harry was definitely in deep shit for abandoning him.
unlikely chance, sure."
. Of course, he didn't have to work to have enough money to live comfortably, but he thought life would be rather dull if he just sat about all the time, and, well, he'd never dealt with boredom well.
"Nothing."
"I honestly still don't know what came over me. Usually I think before I act — then again, I used to be observant too. You were just being really cute, and I just...did it."
"Not funny." But Harry had caught the muffled snort of laughter against his neck. What a rotten liar.
"Why not? I might. I might end up with anyone, I might end up with no one. Why can't I be with a man if that's who I end up falling for?"
Well. That had been interesting. But a good kind of interesting, he thought. In any case, he'd successfully gotten a job, so that was certainly something to celebrate.
, really?" she couldn't help adding.
He got dressed as Draco looked for his shorts and shoes. Harry shook his head and sent them floating toward him, walking over behind them to kiss Draco on the cheek. "That's what accio is for, love."
Draco put one hand on Harry's belly and one between his shoulder blades, and swiftly
"From this point on, I expect you to act civil in each other's company. There will be no more fighting, verbal or physical. You are expected to call each other by your given names and not to antagonise each other. Do I make myself clear?"
He firecalled Ron's office, knowing he'd already be in. Ron always came in early on Fridays so he could leave early.
Hermione turned around to watch, and waved a friendly hand once Draco was done ordering.
Harry squeezed his hand back, and brought them up to press a kiss to the back of Draco's hand. He let them drop again and traced his thumb over the edge of Draco's ring, which made him feel just a tiny bit more soft and glowy inside. Not that anybody had to know that.

"I think I'm gonna puke."

"Who said anything about fair?" Draco murmured back, kissing him soundly to avoid further rebuttal.
Harry bit his lip. "It just…it just
"Why suddenly so nervous, love?" Draco yelled in his ear. His thumbs came up to rub circles on Harry's bare waist. His shirt covered just to the bottom of his ribs, a fact Draco was happily taking full advantage of.
"They wanted to meet you again, you know, fresh start?" he finally responded, avoiding the (pretty valid) points Draco had brought up.
A vibrant bouquet of yellow and orange flowers sat in a vase on his desk. He carefully moved them over so he could grab the stack of essays, and a small card fell off of the vase.
Harry looked pointedly down at Draco's hand, when he still didn't remove it from his mouth.
He flexed his hips, and another wave of pleasure washed through him.
Draco shrugged, and Harry handed him the glass.
Harry looked amused. "There's the modest man I fell in love with. Now, care to
, but now there isn’t a single one around either of you! I’m so glad everything worked out.”
Harry grinned, unable to resist kissing Draco again. "He should definitely have a name. Looks like a Herbert," he said, when he pulled back.
Draco yanked on a shirt and stormed out of the room, shooting the students a quelling look. They were duly terrified.
"I love you," he settled for.
Bartholomew made a halfhearted peck at the Snitch hovering around the collar of Draco's shirt, and he jerked the arm Bartholomew was perched on back a bit.
Draco grabbed him by the hips and pulled him in even closer, shifting up his own hips so that they were flush against each other. "Hard to complain."
A few Hufflepuffs at a table nearby were glancing at him a bit strangely (likely because of his odd reaction to dropping the books). He glared at them and looked the other way; not because he disliked them or really even thought they were being rude, he just wanted to discourage them from interacting with him in any way. That included looking at him.
He looked askance at Draco, who merely shrugged.
Harry snorted. "Oh yeah, you'll be thrilled to hear this: so I talked to Ron and Hermione the other day—"
sound like fun.
It was fairly late in the day, as Harry had never been a naturally early riser, so he decided to go ahead and visit St. Mungo's after his coffee. He figured he could pick up a bite to eat afterward, and then go check out the job prospect.
"So," he broke the silence, quickly eating the last of his cone, "I have some potions work to do, and I'm sure you'll be visiting St. Mungo's..." He trailed off.
Malfoy smiled. "Yes, of course, Zylphie. Wouldn't want more customers wandering in thinking it's just fine to shop past six. How much do I owe you? Include the potions, please. I'll grab them in a minute."

"I feel terrible because he went through a lot, but he's being a royal prat to you. You don't deserve it, you've always stuck right by him, but he was really laying in."
Three hours in, and he had been making progress — perhaps slower than most days, but progress nonetheless — and he was very glad for a break when there was a sharp rap on the door. He didn't much care if it involved wrangling
He really tried to keep a lid on his temper most of the time, but Merlin's tits everybody was really testing him today.
He shrugged. "I'm just in a good mood."
He'd have to ask her about that later. For now he'd try to sleep and forget the foolery that was his life.
He spotted the guy from the street earlier across the room by the bar. Well would you look at that: victim spotted.
"With all those teenage hormones, I don't doubt that you were. I wouldn't worry about it though."
"No." Draco gasped. "I dont— I'm not—"
And maybe Draco felt pretty content right now too. Even with his discomfort, feeling like he didn't belong at the Weasley family's Christmas, and his silly jealousy, and his stupidly hopeless pining after Harry. The room was warm and filled with laughter and chatter, and he was holding hands with the man who had so quickly wormed his way into his life, and who was now — to Draco's surprise — his best friend. He was safe and full of good food, and he thought maybe things didn't have to live up to your highest hopes to be worth enjoying.
The man looked up again and sized Harry up suspiciously. "Who's asking?"
Ron snorted. "A
"Oh, shite, didn't even think of that. Are we going to have to obliviate some poor Muggle?"
She patted his back. "Okay, dear. I'll try. For you."
"But! What about...You're always around each other's classrooms, and you always sit together at meals, and talk in the hallways!" The Slytherin girl piped up.
Still, when the fourteenth of February arrived, he left a vase of flowers on Harry's desk for him to find later — although he'd made sure to include no roses, and no reds, pinks, or purples. It didn't look, at first glance, like a declaration of love, but that was just how Draco wanted it. He left a small card attached to the vase and left for his first class.
With a turn and a
He pushed those thoughts aside (before he ended up stewing over the same things again and again, as he was prone to doing) and flicked a hand at the coffee maker.
Draco broke the silence, clearing his throat and fixing his hair. "So that was…"
Harry gave him a questioning look.
Draco kept quiet and tried to avoid them. Wouldn't it be just
The witch looked him over with shrewd eyes.
Harry kissed his back. "It's okay to take a bit. Stop trying to rush, you're going to hurt yourself."

Draco smirked. "Depends on how adventurous you're feeling about those."
"Oh, deadly," Draco said sombrely, digging into one of the bottom drawers of the bureau.
ingredient) that perhaps he really needed to do something about this procrastinating problem of his.
Harry looked away from Draco, and frowned at the people already stopping to point and gossip. He hadn't been seen publicly in over a month and now he had appeared holding some strange man's hand, but it was still rather rude. It didn't sound as if anyone had realised who Draco was yet, but in any case the reporters would surely be there soon.
"Bloody Merlin, I swear if that little meddling piece of shite poltergeist messed up my veritaserum brew, I am

"And so do I, but right now you want me to fuck you, isn't that right?"
Please go check it out, it's by

They continued in silence until they reached the pub, which Malfoy waved him into, holding the door.

"Well I don't know! He probably would've said something if he was, and
that's all Ron had to say. Well, I don't know Harry, perhaps just try and think it over."
It had barely been an hour and he hadn't even had but one shot, but Draco felt absolutely hammered on energy alone. He wound his way through the crowd, grinding blindly on whomever happened to be nearest. A couple of times he'd ended up making out with some guy who was dancing back against him. He hoped whomever his next victim was was going to be up for a bit more than some heavy snogging because he was incredibly horny at this point.
"Ah, bloody hell Harry. Fuck fuck fuck yes."
The Gryffindor boy pulled a small object from his pocket, and carefully set in on the floor in front of the table. The Gryffindor girl flicked her wand, and it enlarged to its full size. It was a trunk.
He held one out for the Gryffindors to share, and they placed the end against the bottom of the pillar.
Harry kissed his neck again. "Go to sleep."
Harry shrugged. "I've, erm, I've got to go, I'm due for a firecall soon."
awfully in love with him, and it only seemed to be getting worse by the day. And in his weaker moments, acknowledging the futility of those feelings hurt in a way he'd never encountered before.
. Harry just didn't understand how everybody could be so utterly
Harry just blinked, and Draco blushed.
Draco shook his head. "I can't leave Harry to fend for himself; I still haven't gotten the crumbs out of my bed from last time. Also I left a note saying I'd be home around seven, and don't want to have him worry."

"Fine. I'll owl you later to set up more plans."
"Hey mate, what's up?"
He knew Harry could be oblivious about some things, but Draco just didn't understand how the situation didn't seem to be getting
"Half five," the bartender answered helpfully.
"Oh. Oh Merlin, is that really your idea?"
Harry shrugged. "People are people. Things change."
"What?"
Harry pressed down against Draco as he slid their tongues together, and he felt Draco wrap his legs around him, pulling him harder against him. Draco rolled his hips, and Harry scrabbled at Draco's shirt, pushing it up out of the way to trace his hands over the smooth skin.
"No, stay. Let's just order pizza. We can eat it in bed."
"It does smell good— have you seen my other earring? The wreath stud?"
"No— I meant, yes—" Draco stuttered. "Yes, of course I want—" he cut himself off again as Harry started laughing again. "You're a twat."

Ron stuck his tongue out and stood up. "Well
"Well you're not wrong about me having been a royal prat," he said with a wry grin. "Hello Weasley," he said pleasantly to Ron's face in the flames.
He quickly repaired it, and put it back. Draco didn't have to know.
Draco dropped the paper and sighed, closing his eyes tightly. "That isn't going to stop the assumptions."
Bill and Fleur's children were thrilled about the biscuits, and within a few minutes they both had icing sugar down their fronts, and jam smeared around their mouths.
"Alright, you
of excitement in his life already anyway.
This time Draco's groan was neither from pain, nor was it internal. He tilted his hips, trying to get pressure on that one spot, but he couldn't quite. It was frustrating, but it still felt incredibly good, even when it was just getting brushed.
The guilt of not being honest with Draco settled back over Harry like a storm cloud. Well
known for having quite the temper.
Draco looked over at Harry with the same soft eyes he'd always had for Harry since that first year of teaching, much to Neville's secret contentment.
They were both surprised by how little really changed in their relationship now that it was no longer 'fake'. Of course, the guilt and the pining were thankfully gone, which was a massive relief, but other than that most things were effectively the same.
Draco started laughing. "I am
with them, but there were certainly quite a few. Some of them were still — presumably Muggle tattoos — but others moved and changed, dancing across his pale white skin. As mesmerising as it was, all Harry could think was how much Lucius would have disapproved. Not, of course, that Lucius Malfoy disapproving of something ever bothered Harry. He wouldn't say he was

He let out a long breath of relief once he found himself alone in the kitchen. The day had hardly begun and he was already exhausted, which could hardly bode well for the rest of the day, he thought.

Harry blushed. Right. She was always reminding him not to start conversations in the middle, because she was 'not any sort of legilimens, and couldn't be paid enough for it if I was'.
This was
impressive magic,
"Don't look at me, Potter." He turned to the four prefects (and the entire student body which was silently spectating behind them). "I was Professor Potter's number one rival for six years at Hogwarts! I once stayed up the entire night charming badges by hand to say Potter Stinks when pressed."
"I. Said. Don't. Call. Me. That!"
"Excellent! Ten points to Hufflepuff."
"Can't lie to you; it was a dumb decision."
Harry waved him in awkwardly. There was a moment of charged silence.
Well. Now was not the time to have said that but...in for a penny, in for a pound.
Harry squeezed his hand in reassurance, and dragged him through the doors of Flourish and Blotts. The reporters tried to follow them in, but the staff quickly moved to keep them out of the shop. That didn't stop the other customers (and some staff) from staring and gossiping, however.
Draco had found dinner to be a surprisingly pleasant — if incredibly boisterous — affair for the most part.
"Why don't you come in and have a seat?"
Whilst hanging out with Neville and Draco was nice, and they could comfortably sit around for hours talking in the front room of Harry's sleeping quarters; hanging out with
Of course, by dinnertime the Great Hall was buzzing with chatter. Heads from all of the tables would occasionally crane their necks toward the staff table in hopes of catching the glint of metal on Harry and Draco's hands.
"Noted." Draco mumbled, turning his face further into the pillow. "Get a move on though, I'm hungry."

want you to pretend to date me to piss everyone off?"
George grinned.
"Yeah, and I needed some new reading material, I've been pretty bored all summer. Haven't really had many people to talk to."
" Ron asked, incredulously. "Harry, I woke up to a frantic firecall from mum, showing me this morning's Prophet is covered with a picture of you and the ferret full-on snogging! You don't think there's anything to be explained there?"
"Not exactly. Why don't we go sit down in one of the exam rooms?"
"Hm, thank you. How gentlemanly," Draco commented.
"Better?"
Harry sighed. "Yeah, of course. That sounds great, actually. I'll have to double-check with Draco, but I'm sure we'll be there — we don't have any other plans that I know of."
Plus, stooping to jealousy just felt so...silly. But he couldn't help the pang he had felt when he'd come in for a respite from the cold and saw the two of them cuddled together, laughing and whispering on the sofa. Harry was a tactile friend and a cuddler, Draco knew that now, so it didn't even necessarily mean anything, but it still hurt a bit.
"I still need to stock up on potions ingredients, and the apothecary closes early. What time is it?"
," Draco demanded, dropping the cheerful tone.
Even if he meant it in a slightly different way than Harry had, it's not like he had to
Harry grabbed his chin, and forced him to look up into his face. "Did I say you could call me that?" he growled. "Did I say you could use my name like you actually know me? Like you're not just a common whore?"
"Oh? Not enough?" He cut a forkful of his cake and held it to Draco's mouth to feed it to him.
"It's fine, Harry. I, at least, manage to prepare for the future."
Molly and Arthur were predictably weepy, and immediately claimed Ron and Hermione’s attention as everybody found their places at the tables.
Harry huffed. "I'm in love with him, which you already knew, which you knew
"I don't know. I honestly don't know what to think. Other than just 'hmm.'"
"Just try."
He Apparated swiftly back to his house, and, once the dizziness subsided, he couldn't help frowning at it. He really hated Apparating in front of the house so that he was forced to take the whole thing in.

Harry rolled his eyes, before adopting a very serious expression and looking into his eyes. "You look utterly breathtaking tonight, love," he said.
"Hmph..." she conceded after a lengthy, thoughtful pause. "I can't see a reason you'd have to trick me. I'm not going to give you any special treatment or anything, just so you know."
Draco faced him, and Harry pushed him back against the tree, pressing himself right up against him, and yanking Draco's robes up to his waist again. "Put your legs around me like a good pet," Harry said, wrapping a hand around one of Draco's thighs to help him up. Draco managed to get most of the way up, and Harry hitched him up properly around his waist before grabbing the back of his head and dragging him into a brutal kiss.
"Sure," Harry nodded.
Ron gave him a strange look.

Harry let out a short laugh. "Yes, different too."
"Well I believe you told me last night to 'come seduce you tomorrow', and it's tomorrow, so here I am."
was just at work."
It was nearing midnight by the time Draco was satisfied he'd touched base with everyone worth doing so. Harry had enjoyed their conversation with Kingsley — who was truly a breath of fresh air from the posturing and circuitous speech — but unfortunately it was a rather short one, as the Minister was pulled away to someone else's attentions.
"Who knew you were such a busybody?"
"What? But I haven't finished yet."
Harry looked over his shoulder, and saw photo-Harry looking horribly besotted with photo-Draco in the garden. Lovely. At least he didn't look disgusted or something, but it was embarrassing for his emotions to be shown so clearly so
The pillar swung open, and he stumbled sleepily in.
Draco kissed his shoulder. "I'm sorry."
"Morning," he heard Hermione whisper.
“Is that so?” Harry replied, and briefly froze as he heard his voice boom out over the ballroom.
Draco thought that skipping breakfast was the best option. Although Harry reluctantly agreed, he pointed out that they wouldn't be able to avoid their classes.
getting angry over these sorts of things, though. He tried his best, but he also couldn't just
Draco grinned and leaned back. "Alright, no calling you darling. As for when we start, I haven't got anything else to do today, have you?"
It seemed Harry had missed quite a lot over the years. He wondered what else he had failed to notice. Now that he thought about it, he couldn't remember ever noticing much that didn't directly pertain to him or whatever the Problem of the Year was.
Another crack of thunder sounded, and they both tensed, but stayed where they were.
Harry paused. "Er…"
. I mean locking and silencing charms are a given."
Harry's head jerked to the side, and Draco blinked away the sleepy haze enough to realise he was clearly still asleep. And apparently having a nightmare.
"Oh good, you're alive."
"Oh, definitely high on the scale. If you're making noise why not go loud?"
"Harry! What was that I just saw?" Molly scolded from across the room.
The healers exchanged another look and both of them shifted uncomfortably.
Harry dropped his glamour and leant heavily against the wall in the lift as it took him up to the children's ward in St. Mungo's.
This time it was Harry who spoke, although his face still looked like he was trying to work out a particularly difficult arithmancy problem.
"'S only three in the morning—" Harry tapped lightly at the tattooed pocket watch on Draco's chest, "—it's gonna be a long night." His voice was complaining, but his hand stopped its tapping and flattened against Draco's chest, warm brown against frosty white. He scooted closer, until they were up against each other, and he could feel Draco's heart beating not just against his hand, but in his own chest.
"Okay, come in."
"No. I'm being honest. You're not drunk, and I'm in love with you. Have been for a while."
Harry grinned and brought his mouth back up to Draco's, exploring the vibrant, shifting art with his wandering hands.
He sighed. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad — there was even the possibility it could end up being a little bit nice. "Okay. Yeah, we can go," he finally agreed, but he still felt a little uncertain.
"Well, how did he act when you asked?"
"Eight!"

The first time he woke up with Draco in his bed, Harry decided it wouldn't have mattered if they
"Erm, yes, I had some questions about my essay."
"Yeah. Yes."
"Mhm." Draco snuggled down into the bed, and then seemed to have a thought. "Wait."
Ron swiped at his eye with his sleeve, and Harry knew he'd been thinking of the Horcrux hunt as well. “Fucking hell, Harry, you weren’t supposed to actually do a

"But—"
"There you are mate! We were wondering why you weren't in the room," Ron exclaimed, shattering Harry's intense concentration on the flames. He nodded vaguely in acknowledgement of Ron's words and continued to sit in wait for Hermione. Ron seemed to be trying to begin a conversation for a few moments before he gave up and plopped himself down on the sofa to wait in silence.
"Is this completely necessary for them to believe we're in a relationship?" Draco couldn't keep himself from asking lowly, as Harry backed him against the sink. He swore he could feel his heart pounding in his ears, and the traitorous Snitch beating its wings on his throat certainly wasn't helping matters.
The house was, as usual, crowded and overflowing with foodstuffs. Draco quickly charmed Molly by complimenting her food, and eventually enough food and alcohol was consumed that the atmosphere lightened up.
Draco nodded absentmindedly. "Where do you want to go?"
He was just glad Harry had still been asleep for that bit.
He glanced over to his right to see Mal—

Harry was confused.
"Yes, why not," Draco repeated pensively. His fingers ran lightly through Harry's hair as they sat.
Draco suddenly started.
Draco leaned back. "Come on, we've got to prep you." He pulled Harry back up and tugged his robes over his head. He stood for a moment with his hands digging into Harry's bare waist. "Oh Merlin, You just— I sometimes don't even know where to start with you; I just want to do everything to you all at once. Bloody hell you're fit—" He broke off with a moan when he saw Harry palming himself through his pants.
He quickly stepped forward and tilted his head down slightly to kiss Harry before he could overthink it. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's shoulders, slipping one hand into the back of his hair. He was certainly prepared for this show then, Draco thought.
, that just seemed to be his general state now.
"Don't know." Draco rolled away, and Harry frowned at the loss of contact as he got to his feet. "They didn't mention it."
"Fuck off. You just wish you got chocolate."
Harry held out his hand, and Draco took it, turning on the spot and Apparating them home.
He had
"I can't imagine she would ever need to know," Draco replied smoothly, kissing over Harry's jaw, which made him let out an embarrassingly breathy sigh.
That response had given Harry many more questions than it had answered, but he figured he could ask later. Draco seemed to be rather absorbed with the book at hand, so Harry stood and watched his eyes dart over the pages. He made somewhat exaggerated expressions whilst skimming through, which amused Harry. Right now his face was creased into a childish pout. Perhaps the book was turning out to be not quite what he was hoping for. He sighed and snapped it shut, quickly reaching for the one next to it, mumbling under his breath.
?" Harry challenged. "Because I'm pretty sure I can do whatever the hell I want if I decide I want to get married. Are you seriously telling me the minute you turned eighteen you stopped finding men attractive?"
The closest thing to certainty about the plant was that when picked, the compound emissions from the broken stalk tended to affect one strongly. If Draco had to hazard a guess, he'd say the plant emissions were wildly lowering his and Harry's inhibitions, but then again Draco wasn't incredibly concerned with theorising at the moment.
Harry frowned. He was surprised that Draco had owled so quickly, but Saturday was a bit farther off than he had hoped. Still, there was only so much one could expect from a new...friendship? He supposed that's what he'd like, but it did feel rather odd to think he was developing a friendship with Draco Malfoy.
He donned his glamour once again, and exited the shop quietly, considering himself dismissed.
"So..." Both of them began at once, causing another silence.
as well. Speaking of the outside, he realised that lunch may very well be over and he'd better see if he was late for class.
"What look?"
Harry redoubled his efforts, and was rewarded with a particularly loud moan.

"Come on Draco, you already spent so much time working me over, what'd you expect?"
"You wouldn't tattle on me, would you?" He whispered, grabbing the bag of treats from the desk drawer. "No, of course you wouldn't."
"May I come in?"

Harry sighed. He was dressed to pull anyway, it'd be a waste not to go out at this point. He started to get up off the window seat, when something shiny out the window caught his eye. It was only the sun reflecting off of someone's hair through the faint trail of cigarette smoke drifting upward. Harry thought it would make a nice photograph — with the small point of brightness in the middle of the haze, and the faded grey of the streets. He turned away, before he could get too lost in thought; he'd been doing that a lot lately.
Harry let his eyes wander through the rows of shelves, as most of his looking options had been taken away by those Hufflepuffs. He saw something shiny out of the corner of his eye and looked to see Malfoy.

Several students laughed, and a Hufflepuff boy began explaining.
"Anyway, I think the young Mrs. Fawley over there — and perhaps
Harry shrugged again, and followed Draco to his bedroom, immediately flopping onto the right side of the bed.
"Does it?" Draco asked, taking a sip of his tea. He slipped a finger up to trace back and forth across the skin just under the sleeve.
"I dunno 'Mione. I'm fine now. Come on we'll be late for class. Do you know what I have?"
The Seventh Year gave a sly smile.
"Yeah."
“Mhm."
Harry shrugged. "We've been in the public eye for a few weeks now, so I dunno. I wouldn't mind living together, regardless of
Harry rolled his eyes and headed into the kitchen.
But he
Draco scoffed. "
"Can I do it for you?" Harry asked hesitantly, gesturing needlessly to the only action occurring in the room.

"Isn't it? I'm just supposed to miraculously grow out of it? Look, I'm glad you and George found Hermione and Angelina, but — if you hadn't noticed —
Harry frowned.
"See you tomorrow morning." Harry waved and let himself out of the shop, Apparating back to Draco's apartment with a sigh.
Harry felt like he was fucking up quite a lot lately.
"Is that a bad thing? I hadn't really noticed anything."
I give myself Christmas presents every year."
Draco narrowed his eyes at him. "You haven't a clue what he can understand. You wouldn't get it, you're not his father."
"I'll be fine. I just really need you inside me before I go completely mad."
He supposed he wasn't really doing a job interview today, just checking the place out and seeing what exactly the position entailed, so there was no need to dress up. Still, he thought he ought to at least wear some nice casual clothes and not the type riddled with holes that used to belong to Dudley. In fact, he wasn't sure why he even still had those, come to think of it. He shrugged the question off as something to care about at some other, later date, which was, of course, the very reason why he still had them.
You two were talking like he was a sure thing! And you just let me confess to him
had something important going on. He supposed he could just add the fact that he'd never paid attention to anyone else to the list of things he should pay for. Maybe paying attention to the things around him could have been the key to sparing more people.
"I know, I know. It's just… He really makes you happy? He's who you want?"

keep denying it.
"You know that isn't what we meant, Harry," he paused in exasperation. "Right, Hermione's going to be the only one trying to help you from now on, because I am giving up! Tell me when you want to stop being a completely crap friend and a miserable person."
. The same way it was easier to just sit. Alone, of course.
Harry thrust again. "Yes, faster, faster."
"Thank Merlin for small favours."
She gave a watery laugh. “You did.”
"And you came
"We'll talk later, Harry." And Molly bustled off back into the kitchen.
"Hey, you're the guy who was checking me out in the street earlier," he said, mockingly imitating his surprised tone of recognition.
He suddenly stepped back and pushed down on Draco's shoulders, forcing him to his knees. "You said this is what you wanted," he spat out. "You said you wanted to suck my cock, didn't you? Do it then, see if you enjoy it as much as you thought when I'm fucking your face so hard you choke."
He asked a few simple questions about what he could improve and left. He needed to get to the library and talk with the others.
"Why did
Harry and Draco looked at each other.
," Harry said, relieved, and then he was pulling Draco towards him.
"Oh no, it's much worse than that. They rope you into hyper-specific
Harry's response was interrupted by the server bringing their orders over.
Harry gave a small snort. "You're not too far off the mark, if we're just judging from her complaints about customers."
Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco's face must have betrayed his hesitance, because Harry rushed to continue.
He probably would have, actually, but he didn't have to admit that.
The consensus seemed to be that they were in some sort of cult. But, whilst Derek hadn't completely disagreed, he seemed to think that there was some serious weight behind his alien theory, now that Missy and Rob had filled him in on what had happened the day before. Matt hadn't contributed much more than a grunt and a shrug, as usual.
"I'm wounded, Draco, that was my best one!"
"That's—"
surprised — it was all over the papers.
"I don't mind, I was just caught off guard."
"Hmm, actually I'd forgotten about that whole Dumbledore's Army thing. But still. I can be very...personable at times."
“Right, sorry.” Draco settled back into the bed, and Harry curled into him.
of his life? Could
"Okay, thank you, here take Luna." He handed her over, and gave Harry a grateful kiss.
Hours later, Draco was about to suggest they leave, when Harry got up to use the restroom.
He succumbed again to letting his thoughts eat at him until it was time for his one class of the day. He wearily rolled out of bed and trudged to class, barely noticing the new teacher and failing to pay attention to the lesson.
"That does sound difficult. Where do you work?" Harry asked carefully.
Even though he felt guilty, another part of him wanted to sneakily continue avoiding everything, and maybe get some sleep. Somewhere, he was craving normalcy (whatever that may actually mean), and it made him want to just internally wipe the past and move on starting from the present.
Harry felt the bed jostle, and he clutched tighter to the warmth. A warm hand drew lazy lines up and down his back and he sighed in contentment.
"No."
Draco swallowed hard and blinked back the tears that had suddenly sprung to his eyes. "No, that's perfectly fine. Thank you. They're lovely."
Draco's eyes glinted. Oh
"You slept with
, like, two other people before me."
"Woah, that's intense. What does the dahlia mean then?"
"Our families have a longstanding blood feud, I was horrible to them at literally any chance for years, said all sorts of insulting things, I'm the reason Bill got mauled by Greyback, Ginevra...she hates me. Seventh Year, Harry...you weren't there, you don't know what it was like, and I—"
"Even though I'm completely disgusted with how soppy you are...I'm proud of you."
Harry's mind was a fog, drifting slowly toward unconsciousness, but still reveling in how nice it felt to be going to bed with Draco. He thought it felt quite similar to the way treacle tart tastes: warm and thick and happy.
"Please, is that even a question? Ryan can't keep his mouth shut for anything. All I've got to do is tell his girlfriend, and we share a room," the Gryffindor replied.
"Yes, thank you. We're like competitive acquaintances."
" He asked again, incredulously. And then, "Wait, you slept with Malfoy and

Now that he was an adult, Christmas was more of a chore. A monotonous list of people he had to find things for. Honestly, he found the whole thing rather boring, although he still appreciated his gifts and the thought behind them.
"I'm glad you like them," Molly smiled at him, and directed a mug his way, before turning her attention to little Victoire, who was tearing open a similarly lumpy parcel.
Harry realised that, in fact,
"Well we wanted to tell Professor Malfoy, sir, but we didn't know where his rooms were."
"Well it's not as if there will be a
Draco leaned forward and wrapped his hand around Harry's cock, slowly stroking it before closing his mouth around it. He licked at the tip before sinking down as far as he could. Harry grabbed the back of his head and held him there, making his eyes water. "Suck," Harry commanded.
"What're they going to do? Tell Minnie?"

comment on it and let it slide. It wasn't exactly as if he had a whole lot of people to model in his life who wouldn't be spitting mad either.
Harry flushed. "You probably did."
The other two turned to look where Sophie was pointing down the corridor.
"Come on, come with me to the kitchen." He dropped his hand from Draco's hair, and held it out for him to pull himself up.
They jumped apart, but not quickly enough.
And then Harry was kissing him, and he forgot to overthink the situation he'd gotten himself into. They kissed slowly, and one of Draco's hands crept under Harry's shirt as the other buried itself in Harry's wild curls.
It didn't take long for Harry to lose himself in the work of research and writing, and the next time he looked up, the library was much emptier, and it appeared to be quite late. Checking the time, he discovered that he should probably get back to Gryffindor Tower before curfew. He had nearly finished his essay, and figured he only needed a few ending paragraphs, which he knew generally what to write for. As he gathered his stuff and headed back, he thought cheerfully that at least he hadn't been interrupted by anyone whilst he was working. His stomach growled loudly, cutting off his thoughts. Shite. He'd never eaten.
"Oh," Draco laughed. "Sorry, I'm not laughing at

"Quite right," she turned to George with a stern look, "no more of those Wheezes in my house."
"I doubt it'll be getting out that we hooked up," Harry muttered.
"What's the 'H' stand for then?" another student chimed in.

"Details," Draco dismissed, and Harry kissed him.

Draco's hand traced over Harry's body as he continued his ministrations on Harry's jaw. Harry's eyes shut and he let out a ragged breath as Draco's hand squeezed experimentally over his boxers.
Draco scoffed, not hurt by it. He'd fully been expecting all of this. "Oh yes, but that doesn't mean they agree with the verdict. I rather think most of the wizarding world — in Britain at least — would like to personally stick me on a boat to Azkaban."
Draco flicked his wand at the door, adding a few extra shielding and locking charms on top of the usual

Harry nodded mutely, but stayed where he was. Draco made as if to move, and Harry blushed, finally stepping away so Draco was no longer trapped against the glass.
far back to get arrested for sodomy."
Mercifully, the day passed quickly and free of gossip from the students. Draco wiped his quill, and set it down, gathering the marked assignments into a neat pile. Sure, Valentine's Day was a silly holiday, and ultimately meaningless, but all the same he was rather glad he'd finished his work for the day before dinner.
The headmistress met him in the entranceway.
The exchange in the staff room was a bit strange and formal, but it was nice enough. Only Harry, Draco, Filius, Poppy, and Septima Vector were present. Filius gave everyone bourbon chocolates that gave off tiny colourful fireworks when bitten, and Poppy gave a restorative draught. Septima (whom Harry did not know very well at all, as he had never taken her class whilst in school and she kept mostly to herself) gave out tiny hummingbird figurines that whistled on the hour. Draco opted for personalised stationery, which could be switched with the wave of a wand from personal to officially titled.
Draco shoved the drawer shut and looked back. Oh, he might actually die tonight. Sweet Salazar, Harry looked good enough to eat.
"Okay, moving on to the actual lesson, since I can't get any straight answers out of you. You lot are going to learn how to do a corporeal patronus."
"He said...he can't feel his body?" Hermione told Ron confusedly. "What do you mean Harry? Do you think someone cast some sort of hex on you?"
A corner of Draco's mouth turned up. "She's the same with everyone, I see."
your mates like that."
Harry shrugged. "See how everybody reacts now that the news is out, go out on another date tonight to confirm it."
. You had like four shots at
Draco smiled as he swallowed. "Hmm, I'll never say no to chocolate. I suppose it's
Harry shrugged again, trying his best to look unaffected.
"What's yours?" Draco asked.
, even Weasley and Granger, I'm sure
Draco couldn't hide his fond smile as he leaned against the doorframe, watching Harry finish up the food and get plates out of the cupboard. Harry was just so...
"Fuck," he mumbled, pressing his own thigh against Draco and kissing him again, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth and biting.
She kept the look firmly in place and let him sit in the uncomfortable silence for several long seconds before finally nodding.
With considerably more pomp than he could ever remember having performed an action before, Harry gathered the books and put them primly on the table with the rest of his things. He pulled his chair out and sat down harshly, blowing out air and trying to gather himself back together. He opened the first book on top of the stack and checked for an index. Right, of course there wasn't one — that would be too easy. Really not wanting to do actual work, he let his eyes wander.
Nevertheless, he entered the room and sat, staring at them expectantly.
"Competitive acquaintances," Draco filled in, helpfully.
" Ron's eyebrows were nearly at his hairline.

"You alright there, Harry?" George asked, and Harry waved him off.
"That's ridiculous; why would they come here instead of staying at home?
"Would you like to, erm, catch up or something?" Harry blurted.

"Harry! Hi, so nice to see you," Angelina hugged him (which she had to bend down a bit for, as she was still — and would apparently always be — taller than him). "Great Godric,

Draco heaved himself up to sitting, and wiped his eyes. "Okay, what? You can't just say something like that and..." he looked back down at Harry. "No you're
Harry gave the password and entered his quarters, looking around. It was small, but at least he had a space of his own. There was a front room of sorts with a worn looking sofa and a table, and space for little else. He moved into his bedroom, which housed a four poster much like his old one in Gryffindor tower, except the bedclothes and hangings were all a gentle dove grey rather than red.
"Sorry."
The crackling fire in the Gryffindor common room meandered through his brain, and he thought of the evening before. Hermione had succeeded in actually getting into the swing of another intervention talk in the common room after dinner. Not that she hadn't already tried multiple times that day during lunch and in their breaks.
rather intelligent. It would only make sense, since nobody else can even come
"Yeah, well." Draco laid his head on Harry's shoulder. "You should probably get a move on if you don't want to be late for work. Should be interesting to see what Zylphia has to say, at least."
"Well, if he's been in here for long, at least I won't have to give him the talk. They grow up so fast."
"Alright."
"Draco!" His face lit up, and he immediately move to embrace him.
"You're not gonna— Ah, shite Harry— you won't hurt me. I promise I'll stop you— Mmm
"Pretty, pretty, such a pretty Luna Lily you are, huh? You'll be nice and smart like me, won't you?"
Harry and Draco were seated at a large circular table with Molly, Arthur, Charlie, Ginny, Cho, and Luna; and the dinner conversation was predictably boisterous.
more than just a blowjob, and Harry was able to watch him fall apart without being distracted by trying to get there himself. Sure, he was turned on, but he could ignore it for now.
"It really does," Harry laughed.
When he stepped back through the Floo, he was already thinking about how he'd like to just collapse into bed rather than clean up all his potions mess from earlier
with him. If he were in their place, Harry thought he surely would've given up by now. He'd made himself practically unreachable and constantly unavailable all summer, and had been incredibly curt and ungrateful with them whenever they talked — and yet they were still here. Not only were they around, they still sought him out, and even after Ron said he'd given up he had still smiled when Harry was waiting for him.
Harry smiled. It actually sounded like a fun memory, even if embarrassing. "Do you still keep in touch with any of them?"
introduced to him."
"Okay. Okay. Optimistic," Draco muttered to himself, burrowing his face against Harry's chest.
"Regardless of what you may believe, I do actually know how to cook. Takeaways are just easier."
"Want me to suck you off?"
He bit his tongue.
Draco gaped. "Okay sure," he mocked. "That's all you have to say?"
be catching up, but that Professor Ludgor would continue talking at them all anyway.
"We wanted to get you something that would be useful to both of you. It has thirteen levels, all with different locks and they all expand."
Neville found it particularly amusing, since he was always the one the students went to complain to, although he had joined in on the act almost immediately after they started. He always acted completely befuddled by their complaints and questions. Neville. The person who knew more about Draco and Harry's relationship than anyone else. He found it strangely satisfying.
"So let's just admit this is really odd," Malfoy said, once again breaking the silence after they sat down in a booth. "If we don't, I'm not sure there will be much to talk about."

As Ginny gave Harry her goodbye hug, she whispered in his ear.
"Four!"
"It doesn't really concern you, Malfoy."
Harry still looked doubtful.
"Hello Draco, what are you doing here so soon again?"
Ron had bargained Hermione down from using full names to avoid having 'Bilius' on the invitation. The letter itself was beautiful, as he was sure the wedding would be, but it was also terribly presumptuous.
"If you say so. Lead the way, then."
, or saw anything to suggest them, so pardon me if I don't believe you."
He ran his hands through Draco's hair as he kissed him, and traced them down his waist, finally ending at Draco's belt buckle, he tugged at it, questioning and Draco nodded. "Yeah. Please."
"Yes. But, he's also the whole...hero of the war, one who defeated the Dark Lord...that guy."
A couple of the students giggled at Harry's clear obliviousness.
expecting a visitor to come in unannounced and close the door firmly, muffling the sounds of the students yet to leave the classroom.
"Well, tied with Professor Malfoy, probably."
Draco pulled back slightly, still grinning. "You?" he prompted teasingly.
"Draco." Harry came up behind him and covered his mouth with a hand, resting his chin on his shoulder. "It's going to be fine. I promise. It'll be good to introduce you and all that, even if we're not
"I'm tired," Harry replied, unbothered.
"I don't
"Harry, I love you, but if you kick me again I'm going to punch you in the throat."
. And why are you so mopey then? Did something happen?"
"Malfoy, no need to sound so surprised. I'm sure you knew I was joining the staff this year too. What are you doing on the fourth floor?"
"Fine. I have...feelings for Draco. I— I think he's pretty, and I admire him for his skill and knowledge, and I like it when he gets talking in depth about a subject or when he's concentrating. I like the way he is with Teddy and with his students. But there are so many problems here, Neville!"
"Not the time I was expecting that, but yes, I do know rather well how stunning I am." His hitching breath from the movement of his fingers inside of himself made the statement sound quite a bit less pompous than it usually did.
"We'll finish this conversation
"Hey Zylphie?" He called from the back room.
, bloody hell, he's
"I'll just Apparate then."
"Yes," Harry rolled his hips forward into Draco's hand, which rewarded him with another squeeze.
"I still think you made a stupid decision and it shouldn't have happened, but since it's
problem though."
"I'll let you alone now then." She stood and patted his shoulder before leaving the library.
Ron made a pained face, and signalled to the bartender for a pint. "Don't really want to think about the two of you fucking
Draco coloured slightly, and nodded. "If you absolutely have to phrase it like that."
"I know." Harry tilted Draco's head up to give him a proper kiss, and backed away.
"What was that?"
"No. I think I'm more grounded than ever right now. Maybe it's that rather than trying to follow along with a plan for my future, I've gotten to a place where I really enjoy my life in the present, and I just want to keep it like that forever."
Harry almost didn't feel as if anything was real. Time seemed fragmented and inconstant.
They were currently discussing the theory that whilst the Philosopher's Stone
"Why wouldn't I be?"
"Hey, that wasn't nice!" Harry complained.
"Er— Yes?" Harry asked.
When those leaving for the holidays finally departed from the grounds, Harry practically skipped down to the dungeons.
The small owl ruffled its feathers.
"It's not like that! We're really just friends, you know that. And yeah, I know it all sounds like a stupid scheme, but I think it's the best chance either of us have for getting what we want."
Harry smiled.
Malfoy merely nodded, looking inquisitive.
Harry turned around. Of course it was Draco bloody Malfoy who'd messed up his painstaking organisation. The git probably did it on purpose somehow. Harry so badly wanted to sneer at the blonde's uncharacteristically disheveled face; he looked like an idiot standing there with an open book askew in his hand, and Harry really wanted to take a jab at him, but he remembered Hermione's lecture. Still, he couldn't quite keep the edge from his voice when he responded.
"Yes, I'm happier than ever," he said sharply, "it's just tiring being a—" he cut himself off and gave them a hard look for tricking him into talking.
"Erm...yeah?" Harry stuttered out.
There were several new faces at the faculty table, so he supposed starting out his classes this year would be quite the adventure. Not, of course, that he forgot why there was more than one. His mind snapped to the image of Professor Burbage suspended above the table in Malfoy Manor screaming as she was tortured, and then to Snape's memories leaking out and covering the ground. Harry shook his head to clear it and took a sip of tea to calm himself. It was still quite hot and his tongue smarted at the burning liquid, but he took a few more sips anyway.
The first time Harry and Draco have sex. That's it. That's the chapter.
It wasn't that he didn't like them — he did very much, they were his best friends and they had been with him through everything — but they were still
"Wait." He was probably squeezing his hand too tightly, but now that they were actually
He took a deep, steadying breath, and looked over to Harry, who didn't appear to be in much better shape. He looked to be counting quietly under his breath, breathing slowly and intentionally, still staring out the window into downpour.
"Come on Hermione, you could at least
Harry sighed. "It's going to be obvious I'm wearing your clothes, isn't it?"
"Why did you come to
"Yeah, and I need to put away the...shite. I don't know where I put the plant," Draco said, looking around. "I think I may have dropped it."
"Somewhere near the sofa," Harry muttered, and tried to collect himself. He was trying to appear unaffected even if inside he was quite the opposite. Riling Draco further seemed like a bad idea.
him all that. Keep it simple.
Conversations amongst all of the tables were filled with snatches of, "Did you hear? Clara said they were holding hands! And I asked some Second Years and they said Professor Malfoy
Harry shrugged. "It's not hard. You're pretty amazing, you know." He pushed the hair back from Draco's forehead and combed his fingers through it, and Draco's eyes fluttered shut.
"He was...an integral part of the process."
"It's all about what you focus on," Harry winked. He leaned forward to kiss Draco as he slid one finger in. "Can you turn over love?"
"Love? Love? Can we switch positions, I can't, it's—"
the sort of thing the Malfoy family would have been all over. Exactly the sort of thing Draco was no longer extended an invitation to, for reasons that Harry was supposed to be
Draco reluctantly sat up, and looked to what Harry was holding out in his palm. His eyes widened comically for a moment, and he dropped his face into his hands.
what. Kiss me properly."
' and all. And perhaps he could ask them if they knew anything about the Fourth Year class.
"Yes. Fuck yes."
Yeah, Harry was definitely not liking this whole intervention-esque thing going on. He was just so very,
"Good?" Harry murmured. Draco seemed alright with this, but they hadn't actually discussed where the line was.
"Who — Filius? Septima's not so bad. Maybe I'm just attracted to intelligence"
"Oh. Yeah, I didn't intend to be out for so long."
Harry thought he may already be at the point of screaming if Molly asked him one more time when he was going to marry a nice witch. Deciding what he wanted to do, he finally responded to Draco.
"The ghoul that lives in their attic. It likes to hang about Ron's room quite a bit."
Ron and Hermione had left, and they'd gotten ready for bed, and still Draco hadn't brought up what had happened in the kitchen. Harry decided to take the leap as they settled into bed.
Well, Harry guessed that made sense, since that was the way Draco made him feel most of the time. Still, so what?
"I can't, I'm sorry."
"Mmph— Shite!" Harry frantically grabbed at Draco's shoulders to avoid falling backward onto the coffee table. Draco quickly stabilised him, and laughed.
"He's my assistant alright, now are you gonna pay for your things or are you just gonna stand there all night? I've got a shop to close up, you know."
"That good huh?"
His father's death had hurt him — even as much as he disliked some of the things about the man his father had been and the choices he'd made. But his mother's death had really hit him hard, and he'd forgotten the particular feeling that came from being mothered.
— he hadn't even realised any photographers had been around whilst they were outside.
. He was supposed to confess to Draco this morning. Fuck fuck fuck.
Ron greeted him, spitting crumbs from his muffin as he talked.
He hummed tunelessly and slightly off-key as he slowly stirred the Blood-Replenishing potion.
feeling rushing through him and nothing else.
, I couldn’t be happier that you did. Even if the first time you chose to
Her accent took Harry briefly by surprise — though he couldn't quite put a finger on where it was from, perhaps somewhere in the Middle East or northern Africa — but he continued on.
And then louder, to Harry, "Takeaway for dinner?"
"I've been on edge all day."
"Er, Lloyd?"
"You know I'm only teasing, sweetheart. Come on, I think it might be more pleasant outside. Less risk of attempted eavesdropping."
Harry shrugged. "I dunno, I suppose it just was a surprise to see you after so long. You seem..."
"Well maybe people change, Ron. It's like me
How unrepentantly conniving.
"Great, thanks," Harry said, quickly turning toward the portrait, eager to escape.
"To whom? My father and I don't speak, and my mother has isolated herself."
Harry helpfully swiped everything onto the floor and sat down on the edge.
, right? He has no idea what you said."
any business."
Great. Now the eyes were all on him.
Sometime during the second week in June, both professors suddenly seemed tightly strung, but extraordinarily excited. Still, no answers were to be found. Some of the students speculated, but there were never any satisfying answers, and many simply forgot about it over the summer.
"Are you two...seeing each other?"
Just...not tonight.
"That seems a
"It's none of their business."
Neville sighed.
usually the one to instigate things, and— and it's not as if he has many friends! I've not had the chance to see him around his other friends besides Zylphia, for all I know it's perfectly normal for him!"
When he reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, he realised he had no idea what the password was. He heaved a put-upon sigh and sank down against the wall to sit in wait. Bored seemed to be his default state now anyway, so he didn't much mind waiting anymore. Waiting was just like anything else. Boring.
either.
Eventually, he decided that a nice eagle feather quill would always be a safe bet, and he simply added some chocolate for Draco.
He found himself unable to control his hands as they roved Draco's body, clutching and stroking, sliding under the light robes to grasp at more skin. For all that Harry's hands were roving, Draco's certainly weren't any better. He gave Harry's mouth a rest, only to move to his jaw, and his fingertips brushed the inside of Harry's thigh.
She nodded in greeting.
had he been thinking?
He reluctantly left the safety of the kitchen and ventured into the living room where everyone else had gathered.
"They've tried to make us all 'buddy-pal-mate!' After that!"
"Oh good, you brought Mr. Potter," Milton said as they entered.
Harry smiled and nodded, reaching for the door of the common room where the kids who weren't bedridden generally gathered, but she stopped him with a hand.
"Yeah? You're sure? You know I'm always a little—"
Harry put the paper down and sighed.
"No, it did — as well as it could. I guess we're still friends, I don't know, we haven't really talked and I prefer it that way."
"I was awfully afraid to tell you, because I didn't want to ruin the holidays, and I didn't want you to hate me or for our relationship to be completely ruined, but I'm starting to think that I should've been more worried about you just not believing you're loveable." He squeezed out the sponge. "You are though. You're great company, and you're smart and hilarious and beautiful, and honestly what's
"Erm. Yeah." He saw Harry get up out of the corner of his eye, and turned toward him, silently pleading
"Yeah, but that was," Ron shrugged, "school days, you know? I mean it's not the same now we're out in the world."
"Ah, just fuck me already."
As they walked toward the counter, Harry offered to pay for the books.
"You can wear some of mine, we're close enough in size. I'm sure I have a t-shirt that can accommodate those arms of yours."
"This is ridiculous!" Draco waved a copy of the morning's Prophet through the flames at Harry. He had firecalled rather early and Harry wasn't fully awake, so he grumbled a response that he was sure Draco would take for agreement.
"But there are two of us. How are we supposed to share it?" Draco spoke slowly, as if trying to see if he was missing something.
connections. The people I work with here are literally the
He awoke to Draco clucking his tongue in annoyance. Harry had apparently curled up against Draco in his sleep and had an arm flung over his waist. Draco didn't seem to mind, as he'd stayed where he was, save for sitting up. He had a hand on the back of Harry's head stroking his hair as he read the Prophet with a frown.
"But—" Harry started, and Ron interrupted.
Draco held up a hand to cut him off. "Yes. And don't bring it up again. I swear I'll spend the rest of my days trying to forget I have that god-awful tattoo."
"Er, I guess, yeah." Harry obviously hadn't thought that far ahead.
Harry jolted awake to the sound of sharp knocking, and groaned. He did

"Come on mate, aren't you a
"Ten seconds!" Rodya announced, and they all counted down together.
Harry swallowed and looked to Hermione, who was seating herself on the bench opposite him. She merely raised her eyebrows expectantly and folded her hands on the table.
Draco yawned. "Guess so." He slid a hand over Harry's waist, just to sit there at the dip. It was nice to have the solid reminder that he really wasn't alone in all this.
. He was enough company for himself, thank you very much. However he knew that wasn't quite true. As much as he had always liked to spend time on his own, he did need his friends, and he was still relieved that they chose to spend time with him (even if he didn't really want them to). But he also
They were currently talking about the newest Firebolt as compared to the Nimbus brand, which was trying to keep up, and Draco was absentmindedly running his fingers through Harry's hair as he spoke. And then he wasn't.
After his final lesson, the brave Gryffindor headed up to the Defence classroom and knocked on the professor's office door.
"What is it you keep picturing, hmm? You want to lay back on your desk and have me take you from above? Do you want me to bend you over it— oh, that's it, isn't it? That's usually more my thing. Want to see what all the fuss is about, do you?"
"Yeah, you're sure?"
just get a leg up. Merlin I didn't miss all this cramming of inane personal trivia, though."
Over the next few weeks, Draco thought he and Harry did a rather good job of keeping themselves professional in front of the students. Surely, with no further incidents since
"Hmm?"
"No," he responded carefully.
"I, er, I work here," Harry replied, kicking himself internally. Was he a wizard or wasn't he? Why didn't he just put his glamour up? He could've avoided this entirely if he hadn't frozen like a deer in headlights — oh, his old Auror partner would be so disappointed.
Finally satisfied he wouldn't be recognised as himself or any of the other guises he'd taken on, he left. He didn't like to repeat looks very much — it turned out people didn't take it so well when you weren't interested in a second one night stand. Harry thought that rather defeated the purpose of it being
"I dunno. Negative?" Ginny gave him a disparaging look, and he continued. "It feels weird to try and tell someone about it. They're just, er, you know...going over the war, and even before that. Since I came to Hogwarts, but
"Ah fuck that tickles," Draco gasped.
"Just do it."
"Happy Christmas!" He hugged her tightly, before stepping back and grabbing Draco's hand again, tugging him forward a few steps. "This is Draco, now that you can be
Harry merely rolled his eyes in response, and perhaps clapped George on the back a bit harder than strictly necessary.
“You ready to go yet?” Draco asked, knocking lightly on the doorframe.
Harry smiled and gently gripped his chin.
Harry snorted, and Draco flicked him again, this time in the neck.
Back at Harry's, Draco sat on the sofa, crunching on his ice cream cone in hopes of escaping the awkward silence that covered the room as soon as possible.
"Yes ma'am."
He removed his tongue from Harry's mouth long enough to gasp out "Take these bloody robes off. I wanna suck your cock, and I really don't feel like holding them out of the way the whole time."
Ginny laughed, and then sighed. "I miss my girlfriends. Don't get me wrong, you're an excellent cuddler, but…yeah I miss my girlfriends, they've got you beat."

They would

Harry, but that's why we've got to work toward— you know what, nevermind. I don't wanna argue right now. What's up?"
Draco turned away, digging through the drawers. "Thoughts on leather?"
"Right, that again."
"Could just be your general aura," Ron said, trying to sound mysterious. He let it sit for a moment, before showing his hand and continuing. "Or I tried to firecall you last night to see if you wanted to go for drinks for Seamus' birthday, but you and blonde tattoo guy were a bit busy making sure I never touch that couch of yours again."
“You okay?” he asked quietly.
Fucking hell, he had work in ten minutes. Damn it, he was going to be late. Shite.
The conversation had become so stiff with all of the nerves, and it made Harry uncomfortable. So, to break the tension, he did the only thing he could think of. He kissed Draco again.

the place.
"Wow, yeah, I'll help you bring it up."
"Well...I suppose you should go down to the Great Hall before you miss breakfast completely."
Harry quickly lost his temper. He stood up to his full (still kind of short) height, and crossed his arms.
"Useless," Harry muttered, and dragged Draco's head back by the hair. "You can't do anything on your own, can you?"
"Nn— love?"
"You weren't supposed to hear that, and it's none of your business," Draco replied tersely.
"Swish that, don't rinse your mouth after."
Well, apparently the man
"You don't know?"
Harry peered curiously at it, although he wasn't sure why. It was, as expected, an unfamiliar liquid of some sort.
"I think this is all I'm going to find." Harry nodded and suppressed a grin. He'd certainly think so — Draco had to have read half of the books in there by the way he'd been frantically flicking through them.

"So what if I did?"

"I told them to go back to their dorms, it's not my fault they're nosey little bastards. It's too bloody early for this."
It was a Saturday, so Harry felt completely justified in lying on his floor, cocooned in blankets, laughing at Draco's latest tirade.
They wouldn't stop gossiping, so Harry had to resort to taking points to get them to just
"Fuck, Draco,
"Thanks." Harry left the room without looking back, therefore not noticing Neville looking slightly mystified, but much more optimistic.
She didn't have to act like it was
"I think he went right?"
the screaming, but he knew it was there. The pain, however, he really
"Maybe," he said, popping the finger into his own mouth to clean off the rest of the frosting. "Maybe not." He let go of Harry's hand and ran his hand up Harry's arm, stroking his fingers over his bicep.
Perhaps he should put that matter aside for now as well. He wondered if Ron and Neville had ever come back. Harry figured he'd been spaced out for a few hours at this point and ended the charm around his bed. He heard snores and even breathing filling the room. Definitely four people.
"Fucking hell," He reached for his bedside drawer and pulled out a bottle of lube, "I'm going to fuck the shit out of you."
Draco ran an agitated hand through his hair, before hurriedly trying to fix it back into place in the mirror over the bureau. "This is— this is
Well, at least Harry wasn't going to ruin his day at work. But still. Fuck. The only way he was going to be able to do it was first thing before he could chicken out, and he'd cocked it all up.
The food and drink materialised in vast platters and pitchers, which never ceased to amaze Harry. It was strange to him how Hogwarts always seemed to feel like home — so familiar and comforting.
Honestly, they probably
A Gryffindor girl raised her hand.
Oh it definitely could, Draco thought. But that wasn't going to stop him from agreeing, even if it was a stupid, stupid idea, and they would surely be breaking up soon anyway.
"Can we not talk about my little sister having sex?" Ron butted in, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Flattery will get you nowhere Zylphia; you know I'll buy from you anyway. I'm running low on Pepperup and Blood-Replenishing Potions, beetle eyes, nettles, and lacewing flies."
"Don't sound so concerned. It's a record store, which is seemingly not the busy locale in Muggle society as it is in wizarding society. One of my coworkers said something about a thing called a 'CD', which is apparently much more popular. Strange how so many little things are so different, and if I seem to not know about them, they ask if I'm an 'alien'. I still haven't figured out what that is, but I
Harry was reading an essay with his feet propped up on the desk, when Draco came in.
A tap on the window startled him out of his reverie, and he saw a very tiny owl with a rounded head perched outside. He opened the window and it stuck its leg out for him to untie the letter, albeit with a rather disgruntled look on its face.
wanted to do was go out clubbing, but he was starting to wonder whether it was healthy. It felt fine to him, but sometimes he remembered Hermione's lectures about isolation after the war and how it wasn't good for him.
— just a mess."
"Oh alright. My next day off is Saturday, why don't we have them come over. I don't really want to do this in public, just in case."
He looked so bright, so calm and happy and pleasantly amused — he looked as if there wasn't another place he'd rather be or another person he'd rather be
"Really?" Malfoy asked archly. "Wandering about the corridors at the crack of dawn and sitting alone on the bathroom floor during breakfast is 'fine' now, is it?"
," one of the Gryffindors said incredulously.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, but seemed to hold back whatever comment he was going to make.
"Er. Yes?" It came out more like a question again. "He's not really a child. We're the same age."
"Anyway, I'm not a parselmouth anymore. When Voldemort murdered me and the horcr—"
Harry thought that maybe some things could be brilliant just being whatever they were. Maybe it didn't matter what it was called or how it happened. Maybe it could just be paradise.
. Why would someone want to lay such a petty hex on me? It isn't as if it would help anything. The war is over, and not everything's about Death Eaters."
"Of course you didn't notice anything, you're Harry." He continued on, before Harry could get offended.
The sounds of several pairs of feet echoed through the dungeon corridors and Harry realised both that it must somehow already be time for breakfast and that he must have circled back close to the Slytherin common rooms without noticing. At least he would be able to get back out easily.
"Come on love, get up," Harry shook his shoulder gently.
He followed the voice into the kitchen and nearly collided with someone heading toward him. They steadied him by the shoulders and then pulled him into a hug, which he returned one-handed, awkwardly holding the box out to the side.
Harry rested his forehead back on the table and began mulling over the conversation.
He rolled onto his side and gestured at the mess. "Can you...? I don't have my wand." Harry waved his hand.
many, and he
Whatever sensations Draco seemed to feel from some of them, Harry couldn't feel a thing through his skin, which he thought was a bit of a shame. Might be interesting to be able to feel if there was a tangible flutter from the dark flock of birds he'd seen swooping over his ribs.
work, and then you think
He did as he was directed, and Draco gave a small gasp. One's own fingers and someone else's were a
He slicked up his cock, and slowly pushed in. Draco moaned loudly trying to push down, and Harry thrust all the way in, making Draco's voice go up an octave. "Yes, yes, please fuck me. Please, oh Merlin." Harry set a fast pace, snapping his hips up frantically. It felt so tight he figured it must have been at least a bit painful for Draco, but if it was he didn't seem to mind. He dug his nails into Harry's back, leaving scratches up to his shoulders.

Harry had drawn his knees up to his chest, and sat in foetal position, trying to keep his mind clear of the more insidious thoughts. He vaguely wondered if it was even

"I think he got off on the sixth floor, come on." They began running.
Part of his brain was quite tempted by her offer of spending time with just her in quiet. The other part continued to insist stubbornly that he didn't need or even want
"Yes, well, he's the one who got me into this mess in the first place," Draco snapped.
"I'm teaching them things they
"You wanna prep me? Go on ahead," Harry tapped one of Draco's hands and it glistened with lubricant. Draco closed his eyes.
interesting. Not as interesting as what happened at dinner, though. It's funny how they think they're being all inconspicuous."
"...Transfiguration?" Ron asked, breaking through Harry's reverie.
Feathers. Feathers were pouring everywhere. They caressed Harry's face as they floated by, and he could feel that several were perched in his hair. The sharp end of one scratched his arm, and he looked closer to see that they were actually quills. Thick black ink was dripping out of them, and he felt some trickle down his forehead out of his hair.
"That's a no, then. I guess I know what we're doing tomorrow. It's a good job I've the weekend off for once. Merlin's pants, two days to prepare for a goddamned Ministry Gala. I'm going to be eaten alive."
"Hmm," Draco mumbled, suddenly quite sleepy.
"I'm not taking your bed from you, Draco."
"What am I supposed to do if they stop talking to me? What if I get fired? I'm already sketchy as fuck; they weren't exactly gagging to hire me in the first place!"
"That's where you always keep it," Harry said, tossing it and his own wand in the general direction of the table.
"Can I?" Draco hooked a thumb in Harry's waistband, and Harry nodded, bringing their mouths together again.
"Alright, go back to your dorms or patrol or whatever, he will be made aware of the situation."
"Come on love, get up."
He was not going to cry. But fuck she'd
Harry had turned and snapped his hand onto Malfoy's, forcing the quill flat. He put a bit of pressure on the hand for emphasis and then removed his own.
Sweet fucking
"Listen, it's in the past. What's done is done and we're different people now," Draco interrupted him. "I couldn't care less about them."
Draco nodded.
"I was, er, just wondering if he was done with the drink."
"I'm sure it would, but that'll have to be a no from me," Harry said as he finally hauled himself off the floor and walked to his room with his blanket around him like a cape.
Agreeing to this whole pretend-dating thing was a ridiculous plan from the beginning. He'd agreed because he thought he'd be able to gain something he wanted (re-entrance to wizarding society) with very few drawbacks. Unfortunately, whilst he'd expected to feel pretty ambivalent about the whole thing (excepting, perhaps, finding the pretending funny), he hadn't been expecting
"Oh, er, let me try to summon it." Harry held out his hand and then frowned. "I don't feel anything responding to the spell."
Death Eater," he corrected quietly, "And you were exonerated— No, you know what, that's not what this is about," he continued, raising his voice. "Not everything is still about the fucking war, Draco. It's been over for half a bloody decade! I didn't even realise it was you anyway until you told me your name—"
She held her hands up. "I didn't mean anything by it, I heard you just fine earlier. Just wanted to tell you dinner's on; I'm about to let the others know, if you want to go ahead and get seats."
in a bad way.
"Aghh!" the girl practically screamed, pulling her hair and staring pointedly at Harry's hand.
Ron wiggled his eyebrows. "Busy night?"
"So that's pretty much it," he said, as he finished catching her up to speed on his life and his relationship with Draco. "What about you? You have to 've been doing
, Mister Brilla?"
Ron rolled his eyes. "Why does everyone think I'm gonna attack your boyfriend? Hermione gave me a whole talk too — it's not like I'm the only one here who's punched him!"
"I think they're pretty cute!" someone shouted out.
Harry sulkily walked around Diagon Alley in the early August heat, buying new things for the upcoming year at Hogwarts. He wasn't sulky for any particular
The headmistress smiled. "The feast will begin at six thirty. You may do as you wish until then."
"You won't be leaving?"
Harry closed his eyes so he didn't have to look at that heartbreakingly earnest smile, and leaned the side of his head against Draco's.
It was hard enough as it was to put his actual responsibilities before shagging (and therefore almost never having the opportunity for said shagging), but whatever this herb did, it felt
"Professor Malfoy does seem like he could be a bit of a freak, if you know what I mean."
, then? Me and Hermione? I mean we knew you two were hanging out, so he must've changed a lot, but it'd be nice to see, you know? Kind of weird for you to be dating someone for months and your best mates haven't even really met him, right?"
They swayed together, and even Celestina's corny lyrics couldn't dampen how full Draco's heart felt.
Draco gave a hesitant smile and stepped inside.
. You aren't going to be saving
When they got back to Hogwarts, Draco regaled Harry with a running commentary on everything about the Weasleys and the Burrow (making sure to at least focus briefly on Molly's cooking and the jumper). Harry rolled with laughter at some of Draco's remarks, which were sarcastic and surprised in turns.
Harry rolled his eyes and looked at him incredulously. "Draco. Seriously? We can
"It's unprofessional." Harry mumbled between kisses.
Harry burst back into the room, and looked at all the boys staring at him because of the startling noise.
"Harry? Are you feeling okay?" Hermione's face was creased with concern and Harry found that forcing out more words was too difficult. He mustered a shrug.
"Yeah, well what about sarcasm? I'm sure there's no state you'd be in where you wouldn't get that."
Everywhere the wax made contact his skin burned and blistered painfully, but Harry stood still and took it. In a way, it was good to have this reprieve occasionally — to be reminded that he was human and elementally ordinary. The wax didn't give him exception because he was
Professor Ludgor waited a moment before he replied.
"I've missed you too." He pushed at her until she resituated herself. "Watch the shoulder," Harry complained, as she accidentally jostled his bad shoulder, sending a bolt of pain up to his neck.
. Fuck, you're an arsehole."
Rodya looked more lost than ever, and looked to Zylphia for explanation, but she only rolled her eyes. "Oh, this again."
"If you can't keep your hands to yourself, I guess I'll have to make you," Harry growled as he continued fucking into him. Draco suddenly found his wrists bound above his head against the tree trunk.
Most of the professors had left for the holidays, but the ones who remained had planned to exchange gifts in the staffroom before the feast. Harry hadn't been sure what to get them, and that was when he'd discovered his dilemma. He realised he had no idea what to do about Draco. They weren't friends — he was pretty sure Draco wouldn't consider him a friend either — but they did talk quite a bit. Their relationship was one formed from lack of other options, and barely-this-side-of-friendly competition. Draco wasn't on the same level as the rest of the staff, but Harry wasn't sure if he should get him something more or not. He wasn't even sure what he was going to get the rest of the staff.
Hermione. Zylphia and Rodya love you — don't even
Draco straightened and pointed his wand at the flames, which lowered. He turned and jumped slightly when he saw Harry.
Harry performed another discreet locator spell, and then slipped his wand back into the back pocket of his borrowed jeans, pulling the back of his windbreaker over to hide it.
"Is there a way to get rid of all the rubbish in my head, do you think?"
He watched Draco silently watching him, felt him stroking a warm thumb over his ribs, and he thought. He thought that maybe this was the stupidest goodbye he'd ever had to give. And Draco wouldn't even know it was a goodbye.
strings attached to everything they did, regardless of how Harry tried to act like there weren't, and that wasn't
He didn't care — not really — as long as he stayed friends with Harry. Whether that friendship included their fake relationship and/or the current 'benefits' that they had or not, he was past pretending he wouldn't rather have Harry in his life in any capacity than completely absent from it.
Thinking things were best not left to chance, he simply reached for the container of curry, opened it, and placed it in front of the owl. He had known he was right to be wary. Hopefully it left some for him — and also that he wouldn't contract some strange disease from eating after a carnivorous bird.
Draco sighed, letting his head tip forward onto Harry's shoulder and carding his fingers through his hair.
Harry had no idea what to wear. Yes, usually casual robes were a fail-safe, but he was going to be in Muggle London and robes were not an option. In fact, there was so much more room to be dressed incorrectly for the occasion in Muggle clothing. He didn't even know where they were going, so there was no help there
"Hmm, I admire the all-or-nothing approach, but something tells me that would be a bad idea."
"Well it must have slipped their minds. Or they value my class for actually
"And how does that make you feel like you're making things fair and even?"
"It's, uh, it's Boggart—"
there, but he wasn't sure he could let go if he tried. Harry bobbed his head, and tried to make up for what he couldn't fit in his mouth with his hand. As far as Draco was concerned, this was turning out to be the best night of his life. Harry nicked him a couple of times with his teeth, but oh it was so bloody worth it. He tried to warn Harry to pull off when he was about to come, but Harry only redoubled his efforts, tipping Draco over the edge and swallowing. Draco's vision blurred, and he swore he could only feel the good,
Draco kissed him.

Draco sniffed haughtily. "Don't be rude. He's a very special boy; he can't just be
Harry could already feel a headache starting. He'd gone out 'shopping' without a glamour specifically so that reporters could ask questions about his 'relationship' with Draco, now that it had been confirmed for a couple of weeks, but it was still bloody exhausting.

Harry resumed with enthusiasm. He wanted to make Draco cum this way — there was just something so alluring about the idea of bringing Draco off so thoroughly. Draco was clearly enjoying this
Draco shrugged. "Okay. Like right now?"
He occasionally firecalled Ron and Hermione, but he hardly thought that counted — they were both so busy with work that they'd only talked maybe three times since Harry had started at Hogwarts. Hermione had disapproved of his and Draco's childish competition, but allowed that it was better than them actually fighting all the time. At least they were acting civil with each other.

Harry grinned as George shot him a glare.
He grabbed his jeans from the night before and pulled them on, shoving his glasses onto his face, and following Draco to the living room. "Look I didn't expect you to stay the night—"
He sighed and extracted himself from Draco's arms, pulling on a robe.

"But how did you keep that from us? I mean, you two can't hide
He descended the stairs to discover that Ginny was indeed playing Exploding Snap, but with Dennis Creevey. It wasn't that he was afraid to face him (Harry knew he'd be nothing but kind, as he had been on the first day), but he was ashamed. Dennis made him feel all kinds of guilt, which was exactly what he was trying to avoid right now.

Harry hesitantly approached the counter, though the man behind it still seemed absorbed with his phone and was paying him no mind. "Er, sorry, but is Draco working?"
have sex in my office!"
Harry grabbed Draco's face with both hands and brought him up for a heady kiss.
"Hello Po— Harry," Draco greeted politely (if a little stiffly), as Harry took his seat.
Well, it was only a first attempt. The reporters may have collectively stuck their heads in the sand, but if this continued there was no way they could keep denying it.
Harry blinked his eyes open, and sat up in an abrupt movement, looking about the room and breathing heavily.
Minerva McGonagall had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and towered above them.

fancied doing, at the moment the prospect was looking amazing. He brought his hands around to hold Harry's robes up in the front — these things were certainly not created for ease of access for sex acts — and palmed his cock.
He quickly decided he had better go to St. Mungo's, because alone with his incoherent thoughts was not something Harry wanted to be right now.
" Draco protested. "It works, we're friends, and it's hopefully going to get us each what we want."
After eating, he headed over to the empty looking apothecary and looked in, seeing that it was not, indeed, completely empty, only empty of customers. A small bell tinkled as he pushed open the door, and the witch at the counter looked up.
"Are you picking up stuff for school too?" Harry asked.
"Come on, can't we just be buds like always, but just hang out less often or something?"
"Well okay," Hermione replied, ignoring Ron. "But even say he managed to work something out with three people — that isn't

He insisted to Hermione that it was because of a lack of initiative. He missed Hogwarts and working, that was all.
be made, there was no way to find out if the elixir from it could truly keep someone alive
He snuck a glance down to Draco's forearm, and there it was. Reddened and faded, but still there amongst all the other markings: the Dark Mark. Fuck, it was really him. How did Harry always get himself into these kinds of situations?
"They were fine. And yours?"
. He quickly reasoned that that was impossible, though, and schooled his features into careful confusion.
Draco bit down on the base of his neck, and happily got to sucking a mark when Harry's hips bucked up against him.
Harry sighed. "It's called saag paneer."
He came back a minute later with a fluffy pillow and blanket, and Harry reached to take them from him. Draco frowned, pulling them back toward himself. "You're not sleeping on the sofa."
Now that Draco thought about it, when he'd gone to bed, none of his mess from earlier had been in the hallway. Just another thing to add to the list. Saint Potter indeed.
"You'd be surprised. They'll just say we've decided to become roommates." Draco sighed. "You really want to move in? Just for this charade?"
Harry nodded, and Draco went back to the front.
When they'd finally settled down on the bench in the alcove, Ginny ventured another question.
"Thank you," Harry said, and turned back to face the front. He could see both Ron and Hermione giving him questioning looks, but he refused to look at them. The back of his neck prickled, and was sure that he could feel Malfoy staring at him, but he was also sure there was no way he could actually tell unless he looked. Which he refused to do.
of a nervous wreck, although he was hiding it admirably. He stepped out of the Floo in the Ministry Atrium right after Harry, and Harry offered his arm.
"Whatever. You wanna go to breakfast?"
Madam Pince shot him a warning glare at his volume, and Ginny surprisingly backed down instead of getting fired up by his agitation.
"Thanks Professor Potter."
"Nothing. Nothing at all," He quickly kissed Harry, before shoving the plate into his hands. "Now eat."

"Shh, Draco, it's gonna be
Ron blushed. "I was already with Hermione!"
The bell over the door chimed as he stepped into the dim shop, and the attendant behind the counter looked up from his mobile briefly, before going right back to texting.
"Okay." Draco slowly removed his fingers and dropped Harry's leg from his shoulder. Harry groaned and his hand twitched south, but Draco grabbed his wrist. "Still not your job."
just did not want to leave them. Cho already visited her family for the holidays, because Chanukkah was early this year; and since the Lovegoods operate the Quibbler out of their house, I was the only one who had to go. We all got to celebrate the first few days of Yule together, and I know it's silly because it's just two of the days, and I
Draco laughed.
"Yes, Deirdre?"
By the time February had rolled around, Harry and Draco had become practically insufferable to the rest of the staff. They would argue in circles, both refusing to back down about the same point they'd been arguing since early September. Generally the rest of the staff avoided them, but the students seemed to hang around them increasingly often, and so did the ghosts. If they happened to be walking in the halls, good naturedly taking pokes at each other's teaching methods, there was always bound to be a group of students lurking nearby, trying to listen in, or Nearly-Headless Nick trailing along ‘casually’ behind. And Harry could swear whenever either of them would laugh at mealtimes, several heads would whip in the direction of the staff table.
"Harry," Draco amended. "Will you help me bring this cauldron up to Poppy? She and I need to test this."
"It's just, well." He dropped the magic that changed his appearance. Damn, he'd really never gotten less awkward, had he?
A Hufflepuff held up a book and slid it over to Jamie.
"Yep, just leaving," he confirmed, clapping Harry on the shoulder, tossing three sickles down onto the table, and sliding out of the booth. "Enjoy your lunch date."
"And anyway," he continued, "Ginny's one of my best friends too. She may not have the greatest opinion of you at the moment, but she'll try, and once you warm up to each other...I know enough to know that you two will get on like a house on fire."
"Of course you can conjure lube nonverbally and wandlessly now."
"Yes! My notes said it could mean upcoming nuptials, and this book says 'Honeysuckle — shows love, tenderness, and the giver's unending affection. Can also symbolise a happy life or upcoming nuptials.' Well isn't that interesting. I really want to know what that card said."

badly in Harry's opinion, and he thought he'd be content with never seeing the other boy again just to avoid the awkwardness.
Harry laughed. "You don't have better things to do besides holding onto petty school grudges?"
Instead of looking at anyone, Harry decided to try and see if he could see what was going on in the lesson. It was quickly apparent that he had
"'M off to work, sweetheart."
"I'm sure she was just intimidated by the Saviour. And, of course, the best looking teacher to grace Hogwarts unexpectedly being in the room."
Harry's speech cut off as he was grabbed tightly around the middle. Draco turned around to see what had happened.

"You know, Christmas is coming soon; maybe we could go out on Christmas Eve? Maybe have dinner?" Draco brought up one evening as they were relaxing, reading on the sofa.
Now that it was the day of, Draco was more than just
"Really? I had no idea."
She nodded once, and turned back to the front of the shop, leaving Harry to follow uncertainly behind.
to do.
"Draco," Harry said, gently chastising, looking over at him and trying not to smile.
There was a rummaging coming from the bedroom, probably Draco trying to get dressed for work.
"The rain's let up," Harry said, instead of answering. "I think the thunder and lightning are done for the night."
Ginny snorted in laughter, and Harry picked up his head to glare back at her. She stuck out her tongue.
"Well all you have to say about it is
Harry shoved at him half-heartedly. "Leave me to my misery already, before I find out if spontaneous death from sexual frustration is a real possibility."

"Yes. I very much agree with the sentiment." Harry squeezed his hand, and Draco smiled.
He slid back under the covers and turned to face Harry.
It was just that the ring was so perfect. He just knew Draco would love it, and it would be subtle enough for him to wear with everyday clothes. The longer Harry stared at it, the more he knew he just

ring, and he could only assume the press would think so too if they saw him actually purchase one.
"Doesn't count," Draco insisted, as he left the room. "We're having goulash."
Draco looked just as regretful to leave as Harry felt, but, nonetheless, he pressed a final kiss to Harry's forehead and left, closing the door softly behind him.
"Ah. See, I don't have that problem because I just give them an intimidating look when they start to go overboard."
"Relationship. We're the ones who gave you the present that made you realise you were meant for each other." She looked at the clock. "Bugger, I don't want to miss the train. The rest of the Seventh Years send their love." As she left, she flicked her wand over her shoulder, and they both turned to watch the trail of magic. Words began to appear on the blackboard.
"Mhmm," Draco answered the baby, still bouncing her on his hip and smiling.
"Yes? Harry, are you serious?"
"Good."
of them had punched Draco at some point. Ah. That was sure to make Draco feel comfortable, he thought sarcastically. "Fair enough."
"That's enough, I'm good."
His hair was somewhat long — not like his father's had been, but worn loose and slightly above his shoulders, and it wasn't straight, as Harry had always assumed (or what he guessed he would have assumed, had he spent time pondering the texture of Malfoy's hair during their time at Hogwarts). And he was wearing Muggle clothes — something he never would've imagined a Malfoy doing of his own volition — but it was the tattoos that were the most shocking.

was that happening. Pansy was disturbingly prepared with the ink enchantments, and it was a horribly embarrassing half hour," he laughed.
Harry sat in his place at the staff table between Professors Sprout and Sinistra (well, now he supposed he should be calling them Pomona and Aurora). Students were beginning to filter into the Great Hall, and many were pointing and whispering at their respective tables about the new arrivals at the staff table. Harry tried to avoid looking at any of them.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes to the ceiling. "Draco." He snatched his wrist as Draco paced by, and pulled him around so Harry could put his hands on his shoulders and make stern eye contact. "Chill out. It's going to be fine. Your nervousness is infectious, and I'd rather not overthink everything, thank you."
Harry tried to ignore the way that made his heart ache.
"I'll be back 'round one. I'll bring home lunch, yeah?"
Taking a deep breath, he decided he could and

Finally Hermione burst out laughing. "Oh, is that all?"

He sighed, grabbed his coat and keys, and left, heading down the street for some curry. Well, 'down the street' in a sense, meaning that he Apparated from his front step into an alley in London, and it was down the street from there.
"What?" He finally forced out.
Harry chuckled and turned back to his students (all of whom seemed very intrigued by their quiet conversation).
" he raised his eyebrows. "I wasn't aware students knew about the location of

Draco shook his head, but walked toward him. "Well your timing is impeccable — I was just about to leave for my break." He tsked. "I'll have to brew—" he cut himself off, and his eyes darted over to his Muggle coworker behind the counter. "Uh...
"So. I wanted to talk to you about Draco."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I forget and end up letting them pile up."
He read through the entire letter, something about esteemed guests and influential figures welcoming in the new year hand in hand with the Ministry, blah blah. Something about it was niggling at something in his mind, though, and he read through it again.

"I'm certain they're not. I'd bet ten Galleons it's about the professors," Philip responded.
No doubt, this guy — no matter how pale and pointy he may be — would never pass for a prim and proper pureblood Malfoy. In fact, Harry thought he probably wouldn't be allowed within ten metres of the family.

now even his own skin was betraying him.
Draco blinked. "Do you think that's a good idea?"
Draco laughed.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Then let's go, are you done?"
"I'm certain of it, Sophie. Professor Potter is going to leave after him. Come on, let's go get Philip."
"Well, for Harry he wants to get rid of the weird hero-worship thing around him where people don't just see him as an actual person. And I just want to be able to comfortably exist in wizarding society again. I mean, if anyone can fix a reputation, it's The Saviour, right?" Rodya and Zylphia looked at each other. "It was Harry's idea," he added quickly. The two of them were making it all sound a bit...stupider than he'd thought it was.
what we were doing, we just didn't care. We would've been upfront from the very beginning if all of the students hadn't decided they were bloody detectives."
, obviously."
"I love you."
He checked his watch — a present from Ron and Hermione before he left — and started. He should probably be going now if he wanted to have time to prepare a bit before his first students. His first class was going to be Second Year Hufflepuffs, so at least he was starting off easy.
"Okay, so there were sunflowers and yellow honeysuckle, but I don't know what the other type was. They were orange and yellow, and each had a big cluster of petals."
"If you don't sleep in the bed, I'm sleeping on the floor."
"Yeah, well, you knew what you were getting with me." He slid a hand through Draco's hair and down his back. "I take it you still have a problem you'd like me to solve?"
"Alright, see you Monday," she waved him off.
"It will help me better gauge what those with

seemed like a bit of a mouthful for the students, so for school, Potter it was.
"Alright, well at least get under the covers then," Draco said, crawling in the other side and yanking at the blankets.
"Harry. You are so disgustingly happy with Draco it's ridiculous. Why are you trying to prevent the one thing that would finally make you happy? If I hadn't seen it myself, I'd never have believed you were capable of being such a light-hearted, smiling person. You've always been so weighed down and tired in the past, and

"What do you mean it doesn't make any sense? I've been in love with you for ages — I don't know why I got into this whole...thing," he gestured between them, "thinking this
"Yeah, about that. What do you plan to do about the sleeping situation if you move in?"
"We shouldn't," Harry said weakly. His eyes had closed as Draco was speaking and his neck arched to give him access.
"Hmm." Draco pursed his lips and surveyed Harry carefully. "I suppose you're right enough. Fine. And you don't think the papers will find it suspicious?"
As he talked, he absently toyed with her hair, twirling a strand around his fingers. He really had missed Ginny quite a lot. A big part of the reason they'd stayed together so long was that they were just so comfortable with each other and they got on so well together.
magic that was doing it.
Draco moaned as his half-hard cock ground against Harry's.
"Well maybe you shouldn't have trusted the Sixth Years; some came to my class after and they were acting strangely. I think it was infectious too, because by the end of the lesson nearly all of the students were giggling and giving me strange looks. They were making cryptic remarks the whole lesson, and I can't help but feel like I was missing something major!"
"Well, are we giving them something to report or not?"
Well that didn't bode well at all. Draco raised an eyebrow, and waited for Harry to go on — although, he suspected he was not going to be a fan of the direction this conversation was heading.
After carefully setting out a roll of parchment, his inkwell, quill, and textbook on the table in a clean row, he went to the stacks to find some relevant books. He scanned the titles in the transfiguration section, not sure what might contain relevant information. Impatient, he began grabbing books at random, figuring some of them must contain at least a

area."
"Thank you for the chocolate earlier."
"Rude," Draco muttered.
"You really love him, don't you?"
“The very few times over the years that the two of you weren’t on speaking terms, I think prove to all of us how much better you are together than apart. You've always managed to find your way back to each other and I can't help but believe that's a bit of magic in and of itself." Harry remembered Ron coming back during the hunt for the Horcruxes, saving his life and destroying the locket; hearing all he'd gone through to find them again and how the locket had been poisoning his mind for weeks beforehand. "I’d honestly be hard-pressed to find any other people who are as good a match as you two.” He picked up his champagne glass and held it up in a toast. “So, to Mr. and Mrs. Granger-Weasley, and many more happy years together. Cheers.”
Draco's eyes gleamed and he repressed a smile.
"Oh, I
Harry patted her arm. "They're not going to think you're a crazy, clingy girlfriend. Come on, since when has Luna ever been judgemental? And I'll admit I didn't know Cho very well, but she was a very nice person from what I can remember. I don't think a little clarification is going to ruin everything at all; it seems more likely that continuing with everybody not knowing if they're on the same page will end up causing problems."
reacted badly. It was worth it. Harry felt so warm and safe and almost violently content.
"Well tell me about it!
"What is it?"
"I'll be back around five," he said, dropping a kiss on the top of Harry's head for Weasley's benefit. Best to make it look real and all.
"Well
potent, but it was the best that had been found so far.
"Well I'm just heading off to work," he turned back to Harry. "I left a plate for you on the table."
Harry started to protest, but Neville plowed on.
"Go get some sleep, love; I'll wake you up at the end of your free period."
"That's never going to get less hot," Draco said stepping forward, back into Harry's arms. "I love you too." He murmured into Harry's neck.
"No matter how different he is, how can you just
Harry hadn't really thought this far ahead. "Er...cinema?"
"I still didn't say you could name my dragon."
"Yeah, I figure most things are worth a try."
"What's this?" Draco smacked his hand away, replacing it with his own. "I'm pretty sure that's my job. No need for that."
“Please don’t leave me in the middle of a horde of Weasleys. They’ll eat me alive,” Draco muttered in his ear.
Harry slowly pulled back and thrust back in. Draco let out an internal groan — yep that definitely still hurt. "Down, love. Aim down."
more like," a student mumbled in the back of the class.
As much as he disliked getting attention for being 'Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World', he knew his visits in the children's ward meant a lot to many of the patients. The healers had told him that the children would guess at what days he would come during the week and get excited just talking about it. Some of the children even got upset when they were checked out if he hadn't visited in the last couple days, wishing they could at least see him one last time before they went home.
dessert?"
"It's what I do best, love," Draco replied smugly, smacking Harry's bum as he stood. Harry turned around, giving him a hard look.
He spread his fingers inside Draco, and pulled them out, waving his hand to get rid of the oil. "Turn around."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Come on, just come through so we can go on our
"What?" Harry looked up at Bartholomew's cage. "Oh. Shite, yeah. He knows the way back though, he's an owl."
"Whenever either Hermione or I've actually gotten to talk to him, yeah."

it anymore."
He cleared his throat. "Uh, she says hi."
To be sure, her first letter was hesitant, but much like Harry, she seemed to be much too tired to waste energy on hate (although Draco noted that Harry hadn't really seemed tired since the very beginning of the last school year).
"I'm fine, thanks," he tried to brush past his roommate quickly, but Neville grabbed his arm to stop him.
Harry followed along behind her up to the sixth floor where there was an ornate pillar, covered in marble vines in abstract swirls.
none of us want that." She gave him a hard look, and then paused. "You're, of course, welcome too," she added. "I don't think you and Rodya have properly met."
Harry stared at the back of Draco's head trying to figure out just how his mind worked.
going to fix it and figure out how to explain this somehow."
He would never understand the fixation, but after the several-month-long whirlwind of garbage when he and Ginny broke up (in a fairly peaceful way, as breakups go — but not according to the tabloids), they had put Harry under the microscope. Much to their frustration, he hadn't been very active in the dating scene, just as he hadn't been before Ginny. If he wasn't attracted to someone, why seek out a person specifically to be attracted to? It didn't make much sense to him. Besides, he'd had plenty on his plate with work.
Apparently, the students of Hogwarts really didn't talk, because the wizarding world had accepted Harry and Draco's friendship (after the initial speculation when they were first seen in public together), but there had never been any public speculation that they were
He clicked the 5 twice quickly for a simple 'K', and pressed send, snapping the phone shut.
He followed behind her and stopped short when he saw another of the healers (with the rather unfortunate name 'Milton') whom he often interacted with around the children's ward.
Draco was even better. Not that Harry didn't value Neville's friendship, but he was still reveling in being able to touch and kiss and cuddle with Draco whenever he felt like it — provided, of course, that they were in private.
Percy settled for more stiff, formal handshakes, and Ron and Hermione both enveloped Harry in a hug. Ron clapped Draco on the back.
"Oh yeah? Well am I gonna get to see any more of them?" Harry asked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Deciding it couldn't hurt, he swung his feet over the side of the bed and stood. Checking the time, he discovered that it was just past five in the morning; wandering around the castle should be alright then. Quietly, he got dressed and left the dormitory, deciding he might as well go ahead and bring his bag with him so he could avoid further human interaction later going to get it.
"It's not that, it's just...you know."
"Three!"
Harry rolled his eyes, turning to Draco. "You hear that? They're calling you easy."
"Please, I haven't even started. I'm not saying it's
Draco curled against his side. "Go back to sleep, sweetheart," he whispered.
"What section did you want to look in first?" Harry asked Draco, trying his best to ignore everyone else in the shop.
"Of course it's worth it," he said. "Isn't that the point of all this?"
, but it might be easier if we just let everyone assume that things are the same."
"Oh shite! Sorry!" Seamus apologised and sheepishly righted the pitcher he had knocked over.
"Yes," Hermione smiled.
"Draco." The guy made an odd face, and Draco quickly said, "I know, weird name." He'd never get used to this with Muggles. It wasn't
The Snitch tattoo fluttered restlessly in a dizzying corkscrew around his throat as he paced the room.
The first hour passed in a whirlwind of small talk with various influential magical folk, and Harry was happy to let Draco do most of the talking. He felt as if everyone was having three conversations at once, and he was only catching perhaps half of one.
Hermione bent down, and neatly plucked a folded sheet of parchment from the discarded wrapping paper. "Would this be it?"
Harry was stuck between laughing at his apparent incredulity and flippancy toward Muggle law, and concern for whatever shady business was paying him under the table.
Harry rolled his eyes at the implication that tea from just any place wouldn't do. Just because he wasn't the old Malfoy, that did not, evidently, mean he couldn't still be incredibly posh sometimes — not that Harry really expected anything else.

that was hot. And then he was kissing him, and he didn't even know how it started, but now they were snogging the faces off of each other and Draco was grinding on him and telling him all the things he wanted to do to him in his ear.

mentioned a 'special lady'. Perhaps he hadn't heard about it.
He didn't know how it had started, but nearly every weekend he asked whoever was working for a new music recommendation and bought whatever record was suggested. Usually they took this as an opportunity to ask questions about him being an alien, which Draco did not find funny
"You got me." Harry gave a small smile.
"A dahlia flower," someone said. "That definitely could have been it, and they come in lots of different colours."
Harry's brain was a whirlwind of
He jogged over to her and took it, thanking her.
He didn't stop kissing him as he trailed his newly oiled fingers down Draco's arse and over his hole, circling it and slipping a finger in just far enough to make Draco push down onto it, before pulling it away. Draco whimpered at the teasing, and Harry dug his nails into his thighs.
. You're not supposed to
nice. "You can move darling. I promise I'll tell you if it's too much."
As was all too often in his class, the students weren't entirely sure if Professor Malfoy was making a joke about his own good looks, or if he was actually making a threat on their lives.
He felt the bed dip as Draco sat beside him. Harry just gave a noncommittal grunt.
