“Alright, have it your way then. My poor mother will have to deal with the humiliation of having to see her one and only darling son walk down the aisle with all his bits hanging out-”
“Who could’ve written this? I can’t recall anyone at Hogwarts called Tara Gilesbie.” Draco questions and hopes his subtle shift in direction will go unnoticed.
Harry almost found it rather cute to see Draco looking so undignified. Almost being the keyword. There were a bit too many bogies at the moment to overlook.
A delicate, familiar hand starts to rub his back in a soothing up and down motion, “You’ll be fine and if anyone tries to take the piss out of you I’ll hex them into oblivion.”
Draco’s eyes widen and he lifts his gaze to meet Harry’s once more. His eyebrows were drawn together and his lips were turned down into a small frown. His eyes were dull and humorless gone was the glittering merriment that had lit them up just moments before. Draco felt like a mountain troll had ripped his heart out of his chest and stomped it into oblivion. He hated seeing Harry anything but the happiest he deserved to be. Especially when it was his own smart mouth that had caused the grief (which he had been working on but old, snarky habits die hard).
On their next date, Harry figures he could cook and introduce Draco to some of the milder flavors his masala dabba had to offer. Or Harry supposes he could introduce Draco to the wonderful world of a late-night greasy fish n’ chips basket. Either way, he makes a silent promise to himself to hold off on giving the other boy anything spicy again for a long, long time. The thought of future endeavors puts a smile firmly on Harry’s face as he heads to the kitchen to rescue his newly acquired damsel in distress.
“Well, maybe when someone tells you not to eat the spicy food because you can’t handle it you should listen.”
Finding the books had been made a top priority. Unfortunately for Harry, his star power had followed him into his adult life, and high profile cases were frequently handed over to him. “Good for press and whatnot” he’d been told on several occasions by almost every supervisor he’d ever had. Fortunately for the Ministry, the magical world, and maybe even the muggle world—Harry happened to be more than competent at his job.
What was really the absolutely most maddeningly stupid thing Potter had done was strutted into class, walked right past, and gave him no acknowledgement whatsoever. As if last night never happened. How stupid could one person be?
"Oh, please! As if you two would behave any better if this was happening to you!” Blaise quirks his brow and Pansy crosses her arms. A shared look of disbelief crosses their refined features. “Ok, fine you would.” Draco concedes.
Draco hesitates a bit before answering, “Not a lot of it. I skimmed through mostly, enough to notice that I was mentioned. Once or twice—I think...,” his voice trails off and he turns his head away avoiding eye contact.
Pansy simply shrugs, triumphant smile on her face as she reaches down to put her winnings into her bag.
―there's a hole burning through it.” Draco moans as he clutches at his throat and sinks himself further into Harry’s couch.
“Then you saw how silly it was. Or a part of it. Trust me whichever part you read—there’s a part of it even more daft that you didn’t.” Pansy says as soothingly as she’s capable of.
Grey eyes drift over to glower at the sight of the offending dessert. It was a sundae. Normally that wouldn't be enough to entice Draco but this didn't happen to be any old sundae. It was the famous Autumnal Apple Delight. Hand churned apple ice cream served in a warm bowl made out of a rich buttery, flaky pie crust with generous amounts of caramel drizzled over. If that wasn't decadent enough it was topped off by a decorative swirl of baked apple slices, fluffy whipped cream and a cinnamon stick for flourish.
“Gimme a minute.” Before getting up Harry grabs the tub of sour cream and the spoon he had brought in and disappeared into the kitchen once more. He returns with a bowl of warm water and a washcloth. Placing it gently down in front of Draco he turns to start packing up the pork vindaloo.
by Tara Gilesbie, they decide to leave me in the dark and carry on as if nothing foul was afoot. As if one of their dearest friends wasn't having his very character run through the mud and made out to be the biggest laughingstock of Hogwarts! Spare my feelings indeed!"
Maybe the night hadn't turned out exactly how Harry had ever imagined it would be like. And maybe it was far from being perfect in some people's eyes but it was...perfectly
A hushed silence filled the room and Draco opened his eyes to find every student’s gaze fixed upon him. Curiously enough most of the faces staring back did not seem surprised by his declaration but displayed various degrees of amusement.
Pansy sashays over to Draco’s side and grabs for his hand. Intertwining their fingers she sways them gently to and fro. A habit they had shared since they were first years.
Letting his gaze travel ever so slightly over he’s met dead on with intense green eyes. Potter is half-turned in his seat to get a better view of Draco. The bright grey sky illuminates him from behind shrouding his strong features in moody shadows. Still, those eyes, those damn green eyes, were as bright as ever. No amount of shadow could ever seem to dim Potter. Those eyes were burning with that same fiery, unabashed intensity that had brought Draco to his knees, literally and figuratively, just the night before.
He had been minding his own business, enjoying a late dinner when a group of students, from intermixed Houses, one table over, had caught his attention by glancing over every so often and giggling. By the time he had finished off his apple crumble for dessert, his patience was all but gone. He had stormed over to demand what exactly was so funny. What he hadn't expected was to find them crowded over a lengthy piece of parchment. What he had expected even less was the heinous crime against himself that had been written on said parchment. He snatches it from the table, a flush burning red on his cheeks and for a moment he is frozen in place. A fresh round of giggling shakes him from his reverie and he dashes from the hall.
“And just what else have you thought about when concerning us?” Draco drops his voice to a soft husky whisper causing Harry to lean in. To hear better is all…
“Propriety be damned! Robes be damned,” Draco exclaims breaking off a piece of the pie crust. “I wait all year for this. I don't want to wait any longer,” He crunches down onto the piece of crust and reaches again for the spoon. “And consider me taking the rest of yours as payback for that little seduction trick you just tried. There are children here for Merlin’s sake! Have you no couth?!”
Though at this point it was impossible to differentiate it being from the tears or the neverending stream of snot his nose was so ungraciously supplying.
Harry furrows his brow, tuning Draco out, he reaches further into the depths of the refrigerator. He knows there's got to be something in here somewhere. It had been his turn to host taco night this past week. A tradition Hermione had insisted upon as they’ve gotten older. Everyone was getting busier and busier so having a standing date every week ensured their little family some much-needed time for catching up.
“I was criticizing your attire, Potter. No one, at least no one of worth, would willingly associate with a person dressed like a slovenly guttersnipe.” Draco responds still slightly flustered but no longer willing to let Harry have the upper hand in the exchange.
!” Draco pouts, sharply exhaling through his nose he crosses his arms over his chest and turns his head away from his obtuse fiancé.
“I just figured I’d put mine away for later and we can both share the butter chicken. Nice and even. No more spice wars. ‘Sides I reckon there’s plenty of time for us to build up your tolerance.”
Draco grabs a napkin off the table and dabs at the corners of his mouth in an overly exaggerated dainty manner, “What a pair we make.”
His face is flushed a deep red that Harry reckons would match one of his Gryffindor jumpers quite nicely. His face is also very
"Just that you think it took this to make you the laughingstock of Hogwarts and not your obsession with Potter."
“I know!” Draco shrieks cutting Pansy off. His grey eyes were lit up with a sort of manic intensity. “Why would I ever start dating that absolute nutter when I had been dating Potter? As if I would ever leave him once I finally got him!”
Hadn't he also meant to say that under his breath? Wow. He had really cocked that up in every way imaginable, hadn't he?
“I think a perfect pair.” Harry grabs for one of Draco’s hands kissing the backside of it. “Say, there was less than half of that left,” he gestures with their still clasped hands towards what's left of the half-melted sundae, ”want me to grab another?”
Pansy reaches over with her free hand to playfully swat at Draco's chest. "Not my fault there are so many pretty girls attending this fine institution."
Draco closes his eyes and lets out a long suffering sigh pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
Harry wipes the tears from his eyes and looks over to see Draco gently running his fingers up and down his throat, his head tilted back, eyes closed in pure bliss. He’s softly whispering to himself in a low calming tone. Harry sits up a bit straighter. How could someone with bogies covering half their face still be so attractive?
Unbelievable! He supposed he should be upset about his closest friends betting on his love life or that him having the hots for Potter had been evident to everyone (and that apparently he had been so obvious it warranted such a dull reaction). No, he was more upset that Blaise had been right. Draco suspects he may have hit a personal low having managed to cause a bigger scene than Drama King Potter himself.
When he wasn't at work Harry preferred wearing muggle clothing. Draco wasn't even sure Harry had a proper set of dress robes, to be honest, so he had no clue what Draco was going through. For the wedding, Harry had ultimately decided to go with a cream-colored sherwani with an exquisite gold pattern sewn throughout and a deep burgundy dress robe to be worn open over top. For the reception, however, he would be changing into a tuxedo. It was his way of trying to honor every part of his heritage.
"You knew about this—this…monstrosity?!" Draco accuses, struggling with what exactly to call the offending object in question.
Draco looks away and picks at the sofa for a minute before quietly asking, “Do you have a towel or something…?” He gestures vaguely at his face.
Were there more of these circulating through Hogwarts? If so, how many? How many students had read it? Most importantly—has Potter read it?
“Yes, I read it. I’m a nosy little gossip. Of course, I’m going to read something in full when I see my own name. Acting surprised at me fancying Potter? Really? That’s only insulting your powers of observation, I’m not at all that subtle. No, we are not together already. Why would I be here with you when I could be cozied up with him someplace nice and secluded? In a perfect world, I will win him over yet. Yes, I would like to formally announce it. It’s the pureblood in me—I do so love an announcement. Pansy, please don't fret. I assure you when I have successfully wooed that idiot we will most definitely partake in a lovely afternoon tea.”
Before Draco married him, he knew the blonde was already friends with Cedric. As long as they were married in the past five years, Harry never suspected Draco and Cedric's closeness because he knew that they were only friends.
"I haven't told you. There are a lot of bushes here. We have to be careful," Cedric helped Draco to get back on his feet properly.
Draco was silent. He's been so naive. He doesn't live in the modern era. Here he must submit to his husband and obey all his wishes. Draco was reminded of the title of the War God that Ares carries. He was anxious to become the food of the monsters in the forest of Olympus.
"I know that we don't love each other, but this is a precious event for me. I want to remember it as a beautiful thing, not doing it with a guy I just met especially when he mentioned the name of his other lover when he tried to sleep with me," Draco purposely quipped a little sarcastically.
"De-" Deco gulped. "Destruction," he replied. Of course, he didn't say the part when he saw Harry killed him.
"Only the part where your position as a god is threatened, God Zeus who is said to want to step down from his throne, and Goddess Hera's disapproval of me being here," Draco answered truthfully. Indeed that was all he had heard before Alastair forced him away from the door.
The man chuckled. The young man in front of him was charming. Greyson thought he was a woman, but when he straightened up, Greyson realized that he was a man. Perhaps this young man was the most beautiful man he had ever met. Yes, he was extraordinarily beautiful. His long blonde hair and crystal clear eyes kept Greyson stunned.
Strengthening himself, Harry finally came out of the room and went over to Ron's. The Alpha nodded briefly at the handful of soldiers and omegas, who paid little respects to him as he passed. His footsteps were constant and filled the silence in the corridor leading to the main door.
Draco snorted. "Huh? Are you kidding? How could I love a man half-angel and half-demon like you," Draco said suddenly. And he only realized he was telling Harry his secret that he already knew what kind of creature Harry was.
She kept crying and continued to cry on Harry's chest. Of course, this made Harry confused. The king could only move his strong hands to stroke Arabelle's back, which was shaking violently. He hoped it would make Arabelle feel better.
That devil saved him. Draco closed his eyes, imagining Harry blocking the knife that was about to stab him with his bare hand. Draco still remembered the flowing blood and couldn't help but realize that he had been saved by Harry several times.
After a short goodbye to Draco, Natalie grabbed her weak husband's hand for them to leave. She knew it would be a little rude for them to continue on their way, considering that Natalie's old husband had a mouth that she couldn't keep up with at times. Natalie was afraid that the words that would come out of her husband would hurt Draco's feelings.
Draco felt like crying when he heard Harry's warning. This man has absolutely no sense of empathy for his fellow human beings. Silence surrounded the room again. Draco could only bite his inner cheek, so he doesn't cry because he was unwilling to cry and showed his weakness in front of this demon.
This time Draco saw that there were flower cars and catering cars. Is Harry going to have a party? If that so, it is possible that Draco's chance to escape could reappear.
The journey took a little while, and Draco was sleepy, probably under the influence of the wine and the appetizer he had eaten earlier. Draco began to close his eyes, and the temptation to go to sleep was delightful.
Cedric seemed blind and deaf. The handsome prince didn't answer the question that came out of his brother. Let alone answer; the prince didn't even want to look at his relative at all.
"Excuse me, I have to calm my woman down," said Harry briefly as the man passed the King of the Delion.
A bit of precum spurted out of his cock as Draco let out a moan. His legs wobbled, and he leaned more against the wall. Harry spread his legs wider apart so that one was lifted in the air. From that vantage point, his tongue teased in and out of Draco’s hole. He used his fingers to separate Draco’s cheeks even more, then started inserting a finger alongside his tongue.
Draco immediately frowned in fear. Hermione had probably passed his request to Ron for help, and Ron told Harry about it.
Harry gently ran his hand across Draco's cheek, and then his lips followed his fingers. Draco closed his eyes. This must be a dream. Harry Potter, in the real world, could not possibly be this gentle. That man would have immediately forced, raped, and treated him harshly.
The temple of Athena stood majestically not far from Sparta's palace and was surrounded by densely populated houses. The temple looks alive and though sometimes lonely—never completely empty.
Draco took a deep breath. This was not the married life he wanted. He wanted a husband who could love him with all his heart, not a husband like Harry. If Draco had forgotten that he was currently the Empress of a large empire, Draco would have filed for annulment long ago.
A frown of displeasure crossed Cedric's forehead at the suggestion. "You. Can you ride a horse?" Cedric asked Glenice.
"I see. Your Majesty admires my sword more than my face," said Cedric formally, which invited laughter from the other guards.
Doctor Jason's laughter blared through the room. "Of course, even now, I know that all your bodyguards are surrounding this place, ready to shoot me whenever I let my guard down," Doctor Jason quickly moved next to Draco and stuck the sharp knife to his neck. "But before you kill me, I'll kill this bitch first."
Several servants were seen immediately rushing away to carry out his request. Draco then looked again at the King and Queen, who looked sad. He felt confused, wasn't their child already conscious? Why do they keep acting sad? As soon as the servants returned with the large mirror, Draco froze with surprise when he saw his reflection. Then the Queen began to wail.
"I don't think they're compatible. Besides, if I pick randomly, they'll only mess up later." Harry stood up from his seat and brushed the dust in his pants. "I think we're done with this search—"
Alden muttered to himself. Harry's words were like orders to him. This drug was powerful and could not be used for jokes. Alden studied the white powder in the small container in front of him. Very strong, but very effective. If the young man drank it, he would surrender to Harry and please his master.
Draco lifted his body, and now, he saw his husband standing, not alone anymore. He saw Arabelle lovingly embraced the king's body from the side. Draco smiled faintly and raised his hand to wave gently as his eyes collided with Arabelle's.
"Last night, you made love to me, hot and intoxicating... But you probably can't remember clearly, and I don't like that," Harry's voice was low, full of passion. "Tonight, I will make you remember every second."
That person is still walking. But Draco didn't just let the man put himself in danger. It is possible that he is deaf and doesn't see that the crossing lights for pedestrians are still red. Draco quickly ran towards the man and pushed him away when the car suddenly crashed toward his body.
Ares smiled at him. "You're right. We gods should just live on a tropical island. There aren't too many mosquitoes there," Ares said half-jokingly.
And right! That gentle touch managed to make Harry avert his eyes from the King of the Delion, although the man's face was now perfectly scrunched, at least, he would not vent his anger on the older King.
"Calm down, babe. I might hurt you," Harry held Draco's hips with his hands as they were moving, inviting him urgently. "But I promise, after the pain, you will feel pleasure." He said.
Draco continued to stare at the couple until the man hugging his woman there accidentally looked at Draco. Draco's glazed and dejected eyes locked for a few seconds with Harry's. They continued to stare at each other until finally, a booming sound of thunder made Draco break eye contact.
Harry stared back at his reflection in the mirror in disbelief. Did he really do this? He was frequently involved in inner struggles for carrying out ideas that he thought were both reasonable and unreasonable at the same time. Harry tried his best not to think about Ginny, who was probably very disappointed to see him do this.
"How does it feel about flying?" asked Harry again. "Ah, I remember the first time I flew with my mother. It was both funny and tragic. My mother lost her wings after that, the punishment because she loved a demon. At that time, she was desperate and felt that her life was nothing without wings, and she finally committed suicide. Then I was dumped by the angels."
As Harry stopped in his tracks in the middle of the dance floor, an astonishing melody filled the ballroom. He put his hand on his wife's slender waist while his other hand gently held Draco’s. Draco put one of his freed hands on Harry's broad shoulders.
A movement in the corner of the room made him turn his head. Alden stood there, the marks of Harry's beatings still bruising here and there, but the man seemed to have been treated.
Draco flushed with embarrassment and anger, hidden behind the shower curtain. “Potter.” He growled. “Leave the bathroom at once.” He snarled, feeling vulnerable as he stood under the streaming water in the nude.
Draco studied his body. His legs are normal, head and hands are smooth, there are no scars at all. Wonderful.
Draco quickly shook his head, then smiled. "It's okay. Uh, are you Pott—I mean, Mr. Potter's guest who came today?" Draco asked, correcting his words nervously.
A splash of warm water soaked the two of them, making the glass of the bathroom mist from the steam.
Draco took it with a little hesitation. "I can't carry this sword around all the time. The police will arrest me for carrying a sharp weapon."
"Morning, everyone." Professor Trelawney placed her sketchbook on the table. She then stood in the middle. "A few days ago, I read a book. In that book, it tells about an angel who loves a demon. The question is, can the demon’s tricks attract angels?"
Due to the limited access in the mountains of Olympus, no human dared to roam there. In supplying food and raw materials, Ares asked several Demigods to make transactions with the humans at the border.
Harry stepped closer, stood in front of the sofa where Draco was and stared at him intently. "I think we've reached an agreement."
"Of course not." Ron turned the steering wheel, slowing the car a bit as it entered the gates of the packhouse. "You can take one of the Omegas in our pack to go."
From the information Draco had received, Harry's father and mother were of French descent. Perhaps this is why Harry speaks fluent French, even though that is none of his business. Draco quickly took his mind off Harry.
"You should know this, prince of Sparta. The gods hate magic and curses and don't cast a spell on them or perform sorcery. Olympus has clear laws about that. Wizards will be put to death," Alastair informed.
The Titans glanced at each other and looked a little uncomfortable. At that time, their horses stepped slowly because they passed through a rocky shallow river to discuss various things. But when the prince of Sparta began to ask questions about their god, the atmosphere turned silent.
Draco put on a dazzling smile when he saw one of his guests greeting him while bowing respectfully in front of him. "Thank you, Duke Richmond. Hope you can enjoy this party until the end," Draco said, which made Duke Richmond, Charles Richmond, straighten up.
He had to break free from Harry's clutches because he was frightened. Yes, Draco was terrified that the longer he was around Harry, the sooner he'll bend his knees beneath Harry's feet, falling into the devil's charm. Draco just needs someone to help him. Can Doctor Jason help him?
And as expected, Cedric looked directly at Draco with sparkling eyes. The chance to take Draco away from a formal party like this was a rare opportunity for Cedric. Remembering that the Empress always felt comfortable sitting in his throne from the first guest to the last guest.
Charles wanted to curse his nervousness. This was the first time Charles had felt nervous while dancing with someone. Take notes, dance! Oh, God! They don't even hug!
Draco looked at Vlad with horror. He was sure that Vlad was not playing with his words. He's a crazy monster who's only obsessed with him. And Draco will be stuck with Vlad for the rest of his life because he belongs to...
Draco did it out of curiosity most of the time, with no real interest in doing it. He had high self-esteem and felt righteous to judge if the men weren't worthy enough to touch him. Besides, even though he wasn't a devout person, Draco had sworn to his grandmother to kept his virginity until he married.
The man waited for Alden to close the door and leave the two of them alone, then said calmly. "Good evening, Draco." Harry smiled calmly. "Actually, I want to discuss matters relating to your twenty-third birthday..." His smile turned mysterious. "But then I realized that good talk would be of no use between us, so I'll get right to it."
Not wanting to stand and stare at the bustle of his subordinates, he then stepped his feet towards the place where the horses belonging to the group were rested. Before actually leaving, it would be best if he chose a horse to use later.
Harry and Draco continued to walk until they both finally settled their bottoms on a pair of throne chairs that were right next to the throne chairs belonging to the King and royal concubine of Delion.
"How dare you to hit Mr. Potter!!" shouted a deep, harsh voice. Draco turned his head and found himself embroiled in a large man who appeared to be one of Harry's bodyguards.
"Greetings, Lady Canterbury. It seems that I no longer need to introduce myself to you." Draco said with a gentle smile.
Draco glanced at Harry, who was still wearing a flat expression. Then Draco raised his hand. "I'm sure they have charming faces like angels, and maybe with a little trickery that the devil has," he said.
Draco's words seem to have brought Harry back into consciousness. The man was stunned. And a second later of relief, Harry let Draco go. "Damn you!!" Harry whispered sharply into Draco's ear and left the room.
Doctor Jason seemed to be calculating. "The maximum is seven days, but it is possible that if in less than seven days the development has improved, we will recommend him to be treated at home."
Draco struggled to remember. He was sure that he was asleep as usual on the set last night. But now, he wakes up in a strange room that smells of herbs. There was no light other than sunlight pouring in from the wide cracks in the walls. His back ached from the hard bedding. Obviously, he was not sleeping on his comfortable bed.
If he thought about it, he’s probably the luckiest man among all the men in this kingdom because Harry managed to marry a young man called an angel by the people of this kingdom.
"I don't like making love to a corpse." The smile on Harry's lips was cruel. "You are more enjoyable when you live and breathe."
The dashing-looking young man bowed slightly as a sign of respect as Draco and Natalie watched him come. That man was none other than the crown prince of the Delion Kingdom.
He leaned his back that wrapped in an elegant dress on the headboard of the magnificent bed that he had been sleeping on for the past five years. His heart skipped a beat as he read the vulgar lines in the book. Actually, Draco's conscience asked him to stop this disgraceful act, but Draco's brain seemed to force Draco to continue the book to its last page.
Alden nodded his head and pondered. Harry also seemed busy with his own thoughts. "Why don't you just tell him?" muttered Alden.
"Then I'll be out. You hurry up and clean up. It's going to be night soon." said Harry as Draco's helpless little bird finally landed smoothly in the palm of his stout hand.
Draco bit his pale lower lip. He couldn't possibly be drying his clothes when the sun was no longer showing itself. Frustrated, he decided to sit by the river.
Drinking tea with the royal consort of Delion was Draco's schedule on this cloudy morning. After making sure he was dressed modestly, appropriately, and elegantly, Draco, accompanied by his maid, Glenice, then stepped into the central royal garden.
But he now didn't want a woman to satisfy him. He wanted Draco. Damn it! Why did his mind keep returning to that blonde? Harry stepped his foot toward Draco's room with the frustration still overflowing him, opened the room without permission, and found Draco in the room.
He spread Draco's legs wide. Draco couldn't think anymore, his mind clouded by the passion that the hot and wet lips brought from his lips at the center of his body. Even Draco ignored the fact that the man called him
Harry, being quite used to his other half’s penchant for theatrics, simply shrugs while shoveling a sizeable bite of his dessert into his mouth. “Suit yourself.”
“Because-,” Harry leans in even closer invading all that was left of Draco’s personal space his voice dipping lower into a seductively husky whisper, “you didn't seem to mind me looking so
Harry chooses to ignore his date for the moment as he makes his way over to his fridge. He opens the door and starts to rummage around looking for something to help with the spice. As he roots around he is graced with more of Draco’s bellyaching from the couch.
"Thank you for the clarification. I’ll be able to sleep better knowing I don't have any familial competition for your heart. And I suppose I love you too,” Draco says softly as he settles himself into Harry's side, letting his head fall onto a broad shoulder.
Harry opened his mouth to counter but Draco cuts him off, “Now, outside of clothing, I assure you I very,
“I suppose I did make quite the scene. I don't blame you for wanting to end the night here. I’ll take my leave once I look a bit more presentable—if you don't mind.” Draco laments softly as he rubs the soft cloth over his face.
“Oh, no! I didn’t mean- you know I always speak without-,” Draco frantically sputters trying to undo some of the damage, “I think you loo--”
“I know these are your favorite so how about we come here right after the wedding so you can have one before we leave for Italy?”
After checking out a few toddler-worthy storybooks, he ambled back somewhat awkwardly towards section L, aware that the librarian was watching him and possibly wondering why he was so eager to begin reading them.
Malfoy slumped against his chair, huffing in defeat. “I’ve tried a vision improving Charm but my eyes get horribly itchy afterwards,” he admitted.
“I am going to issue some books,” he stated in a tone that conveyed just how Adultish he could behave. There was no fist-clenching, no glaring, and definitely no flipping Malfoy off when the arsehole mockingly waved goodbye.
“Mate.” Ron cupped a hand over his mouth. “The Harpies got busted for doping. It was all over the papers for
agree with them. Harry didn’t know what had spurred Malfoy on to mingle with the muggle world but it was foolish to let it pass unsupervised. The scent of smoke lingering around him was a testament to that.
He removed his hands from the wood to spread them in the air. “'Harry Potter and ex-Death Eater spotted in close-knit companionship!' That should do it,” he said, not commenting on the blatant hypocrisy of it, although Harry could tell it wasn’t lost on him. “Don’t worry, I don’t twist the truth in my articles. I only employ a bit of artistic license. Can you imagine the titles otherwise? ‘Harry Potter mopes around with Wastrel Weasley and The Mudblood for the umpteenth time since the war, who’s surpri—’”
Harry found that the odds of him conjuring a single sane thought increased with every step he took away from Malfoy’s table. As he browsed the library’s collection, he attempted to piece together minute bits of information, treating his ex-nemesis’ presence in public like a particularly tricky Auroring assignment.
Harry supposed that, for Kreacher, the purchase of muggle baked goods from a corner store broke some ancient law that he'd abided by.
“Potter, I don’t understand a single word that’s leaving your mouth. And I don’t need glasses. Just imagining myself wearing such atrocities…ugh.” He made a face at Harry’s round spectacles, as though they were the only model in existence.
The front door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place clicked shut behind Harry as he emerged into its entryway. The light of the setting sun dimly illuminated the narrow passage, bringing murky shadows to life where science deemed it could. He gave a perfunctory wipe of his trainers on the old coir doormat and headed inwards.
had his mind doing a series of ecstatic cartwheels. Perhaps Draco wouldn’t cut ties with him even after being able to see! Anyway — enough of the dreary internal monologuing.
“You’ve got to stop living for us,” Hermione said, sternly but kindly. “You’re your own person. It doesn’t
Currently, however, his slender fingers gripped the page with surprising force, crumpling the cream-coloured corner. Harry noticed that since his arrival, Malfoy’s frown had only deepened, pressed lips disappearing into a thin, frustrated line. His eyes were narrowed, fully focused on the text, almost squinting down at it.
he was acting like his sixth year self that gave him the most comfort. It was habit. It was known territory, something reminiscent of his past, and treading on it filled him with the energy he’d been so dearly longing for.
, Harry thought. But Draco didn’t want him — he’d made that explicitly clear. All he could do now was hope to earn back his right to Draco’s side, and hope he fucking would. Because, hell, he already missed the tosser, and it hadn’t even been twenty-four hours since their last meal together.
) and waded through it to the background noise of Ancient Runes discussion. It took a lot of self-restraint to keep his eyes on the book and off Draco.
“Since when has luck been on your side?” Harry shot back, his hurt at Draco’s words driving him to rancour. Spotting a secluded gap between two stores that they had just crossed, he grasped his partner’s wrist, hauling him in. “Fucking
A doorbell could be heard ringing in Ron’s background. “Oh — that’s cool. Just a sec, got to let Hermione in. She’ll be freezing out there.”
For all its perks, the library didn’t look like it had any sort of navigation system. To find anything of value, Harry would simply have to trust his instincts — a major forté of his. He decided to start his storybook perusal in section C for ‘children’s books’. It seemed promising. He would be done in minutes and be left with three hours to kill in the coldest month of the year.
And despite his godson’s growing dislike for loud onomatopoeia, Harry felt like he truly belonged in the tranquil countryside home. There were no politicians begging for his attention, no Auror trainees waiting to be impressed by the Boy Who Didn’t Jump Onto The Death Express Although Sometimes He Feels Like He Should Have. At the Tonks-Lupin residence, he was welcomed with a cup of tea and a smile that he wasn’t obligated to return.
be on the phone, but Ron loved talking over the phone as much as Kreacher hated it. He’d once drunkenly proclaimed that he would rather die than miss one of Harry’s ‘felotone’ calls and today Harry would hold him to that. He had beans to spill.
Harry; that much was clear from his lazily written ‘Thanks’ in response to receiving his old wand back a few months ago. This left Harry to surmise that the note was Malfoy’s attempt at provoking him.
Could he be preparing for his NEWTs? He hadn’t attended Eighth Year, as far as Harry knew, having been sentenced to a year-long house arrest shortly after his trial at the Ministry. It wasn’t an outlandish idea. He supposed even Malfoy, for all his past criticisms of the Hogwarts curriculum, needed the qualifications to get a job. But it didn’t explain why he’d chosen somewhere so far removed from human civilisation as his study area.
Still, it wouldn’t be prudent to pick a fight here. Harry may have currently been feeling like his fifteen-year-old self — volatile and impulsive to a fault — but it didn’t mean he had to act like him. He was an adult now.
. The Yngenuity Tree, contrary to its yngenious name, was not a sacred trove of medieval English literature, but rather the only library within five miles of Andromeda Tonks’ house — to which he would be headed, in around three hours, for his customary Saturday play-date with his godson.
Clearly, the current circumstances required a change in strategy. Harry could no longer sit there studying Malfoy’s face, biding his time until he made a misstep. No, he had to directly intervene, and if intervention meant pouring over seventh year Charms textbooks, then so be it. Harry, for the sake of humanity, would relearn his entire NEWTS syllabus with Draco Malfoy.
getting involved in your idiotic, reckless, Gryffindorian plans! You leave me out of this,” he hissed.
Malfoy had his head bowed to his textbook, appearing to be in deep concentration. He didn’t even deign to look up as Harry slipped into the chair opposite him, acknowledging his presence with a slight frown instead. Now that Harry had come this far, he realised he wasn’t actually sure of what his motive was. To wait until Malfoy’s next arson attempt? To provoke him for a faster outcome?
“I read your bloody letter. I know the Auror department loves giving their star pupil little cases, but I don’t need to be
, and slammed the window shut. Now, Harry almost felt like laughing at it. It seemed that Malfoy could be rather funny when he put himself at the butt end of a joke.
The sound of a sharp sniff tore Harry’s gaze away from the text. Malfoy sat slack-jawed, a faint pink tinge appearing over his cheekbones.
Harry thought that he would act in a similar manner if asked whether or not he enjoyed Auroring — except, nobody ever really asked him.
“Merlin, are you okay?” he gasped, rushing over. They’d been exerting her something terrible in the past two days. He checked her with a delicateness he soon discovered was unnecessary. The show-off was absolutely fine.
"I’m on probation," Malfoy said. "They're monitoring the places I visit until May. I don't think they care for my education enough to allow me the privilege of sight until then."
on Sundays. As a result, Harry had stood outside it for a good twenty minutes until he noticed how ostensibly lifeless it looked and approached its entrance, where the weekly opening times were displayed.
The city of London didn’t seem to know what to do with early January. There was nothing much to look forward to or to look
Granger had given everyone a bit of a shock the month prior. She’d joyfully disclosed that she’d quit her job, which had never been an internship at the Magical Education department, but a full-time position as an Unspeakable. Draco had felt quite jealous, despite her claiming she'd resented the position as well as the secrecy that came with it. “I don’t want to keep anything from you guys anymore,” she'd reasoned, “and I'd hate to limit myself to such an exacting profession.”
trying to crack Wenlock’s code? Harry, that’s like, the most complex part of NEWTS-level Arithmancy! It’s barely in the curriculum, worth only two bonus marks in the exam. And you’ve never studied Arithmancy and Numerology! How could Malfoy ask you for help, despite knowing that?”
“Oh you’re a full-on comedian, aren’t you?” Malfoy replied, sneering. “Yes, they do, but they’re not very willing to provide service to someone like me. Much meaner than muggles in that respect.”
But after Andromeda had eased him into Harry’s arms and Teddy had let out an impressive sneeze square in Harry’s face, his heart was won over.
“None of your business, Malfoy,” he chirped, savouring the words as they left his mouth. It wasn’t often he got to say that to people; the media didn’t take well to the show of attitude. “Don’t try to distract me from the matter at hand. Your wand is emitting vapours!”
Her tone lacked the know-it-all energy it usually possessed and Harry found himself missing it. Ever since she’d started an internship at the Department of Magical Education, around the same time as he and Ron began the Auror course, there had been a frayed edge to her demeanour. Whenever brought up, she’d automatically put herself on the defensive, asserting that she
Harry longingly recalled their schooldays, the blessed years during which his best friend had been as academically disinclined as him. It
Harry noted the sad lack of thirteenth-century Britons when he entered the building, half stumbling in his desire to escape from the cold. The sole librarian seemed to be a bored-looking woman stamping a set of paperbacks at the front desk. A row of wooden tables could be found to her right, basking under the soft glow of yellow lamps that hung from the ceiling. Shelves of colourfully bound books snaked around the interior, interspersed with a beanbag or two at their base. The Yngenuity Tree actually had a lot going for it, if one could excuse the unsettling smell of burnt paper in the air.
. He also noticed, upon turning his head to glance at his partner’s profile, that Malfoy was at least two inches taller than him. He was sure his school-going self would have had several comments to make on that, but he didn’t mind it much now. It was liberating to not care about the petty little victories the other had over him.
Malfoy let out quite the snarl as he tore his eyes from the page, evidently annoyed by the distraction. “What?”
Draco wrenched his wrist free from Harry’s grasp, immediately replacing it with his own hand, such that their fingers intertwined. “Watch who you’re calling a tosser.
Ever since Harry had informed him that Ron and Hermione were due in thirty minutes and that there was no way they could buy ingredients
what we think. We’re not going to turn our backs on you because you want no part of the role the world’s pressured you into playing.”
It took a moment for Harry to piece two and two together. He stared at Malfoy’s wand, still hanging on to the last of its smoke tendrils, and back at the boy in question. Then, he grinned.
way in which he spoke only made Harry grit his teeth harder. The worst thing was, he couldn’t even correct the bastard. The area was frightfully vacant and nastily silent this morning, giving him the impression that he and Malfoy were the only two people left on Earth. Harry would almost rather have his nose broken again.
“I’m not setting fire to anything!” Malfoy defended, scowling first at his smoking wand and then at Harry like he wasn’t sure who to be angrier at. “Why are you
It appeared that whatever wrong Malfoy was doing wasn’t on purpose. He was just an overconfident idiot — an unintentional criminal, but did that really excuse him? If Harry simply let this simmer, there was no telling what harm Malfoy’s visual impairment could cause the world. Which Avaro could be his and everybody else’s last.
. Calling her something so common as Oafie is not only distasteful but disrespectful to her ancient ancestry.” A short pause later, he added, “And yes, she’s strangely doing quite well, even after you fed her a fucking Bertie Bott’s bean.”
“Won’t you get on with it?” Harry pestered. The way Nott put it made his deed sound a lot more intimate. He hadn’t thought it through

something about all this mess,” her brother grumbled, throwing his arms out in despair. “And right now, I want nothing more than to kip in my bedroom. My
for Malfoy, Harry didn’t imagine he would face major problems with it, especially after having observed the other’s disastrously good grades for six years at school.
It was not. It really was not. Where the smell of smoke reached its densest point, instead of being subjected to the heat of an indoor blaze, Harry was subjected to the smouldering tip of Draco Malfoy’s wand.
Harry wrinkled his eyebrows. “No? I just switch to another song. The music industry isn’t exactly lacking low-pitched pieces.”
“I’m going to keep ignoring it until I find an answer,” he confessed, leaving Malfoy to roll his eyes at the statement and mutter a quiet
“Oh! Thank the heavens you were brought up muggle — ugh, not really, you know what I mean. You’re the first person I haven’t had to explain the concept of higher education to. Ron thinks it’s bonkers that muggles have to go through three more years of schooling. What he can’t comprehend is the variety of topics on offer in their world! All those interesting courses and the

Or each time the sunlight met his white-blond head, drowning him in a hue so delicious, it made Harry want to have a lie-down. Draco didn’t just look
He found that Teddy didn’t much care for what he was saying, as long as Harry entertained him, and thus he started telling him stories. Some were from his personal adventures and others from the books he’d read at primary school. He liked adding sound effects to accentuate, just like those that played in Hollywood action movies. They usually elicited happy reactions, but there had been a humiliating instance where Harry had
The hallway is empty. Carefully Draco stepped out. The sound of Alden's banging and shouting was still heard as Draco came out of the room, but as Draco closed the big white door, the sound faded and became silent. Apparently, the white room where he was locked was soundproof.
Draco shook his head, firmly in thought. Was that thing targeting a Demigod? Or the devil that Harry said — Abaddon — really likes to kill humans, and it just happens that Draco was there?
Cedric chuckled. One of his freed hands moved to caress the top of Draco's head gently. "No, you always look beautiful in my eyes. Whether you wear makeup or not," Cedric said honestly.
Harry gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his intense lust, trying to defuse the urge to charge and sink deeply into the bottom of Draco's tight hole.
Holding back tears and holding back his embarrassment, Draco took off his clothes in front of Harry's eyes, who stood stiffly while staring at him and then putting on the dress. It was an extraordinarily fine dress, slid slowly over his body, and felt so snug.
"Just one chance, Draco. I love you so much. I know you've never been happy with Harry. Therefore, allow me to make you happy,"
Draco smiled as he listened to Natalie's grunts, not typical of a royal concubine at all. Maybe it was because Natalie was not a woman who was born into a noble family. No matter how hard Natalie applied all the royal rules, she would still broke sometimes.
"No need! I mean—it was an accident, and I'm fine. I don't want to punish them," Draco shook his head quickly. He felt sorry for the envoy. They all looked tired and hurt. He must be fortunate because he just sprained his leg while the tough Attica now appeared with her hand broken and bandaged.
Draco frowned. Maybe clothes like that were normal in ancient Greece but just seeing it made him uncomfortable. He recalled the story of Ares that he had read before, the God of War once made love to a nymph until she gave birth to a child. Surrounded by beautiful nymphs dressed like that, how could Ares not be tempted? Even though they were not human, they were still beautiful women.
Draco was undoubtedly familiar with the story of Eros and Psyche. Aphrodite, jealous of Psyche's beauty, orders her son Eros to make the princess fall in love with an ugly monster. But Eros gets hit by his own love arrow and has a love affair with Psyche. Aphrodite initially disagrees and undertakes various gruesome trials to dissuade them. Finally, the two of them got together. Their story was a Greek mythological tale with a happy ending.
A pile of crazy questions immediately filled her head when she heard Harry say those words of refusal.
"If I wear it, I'll catch a fever. I can't be sick." Draco muttered with his brain already moving to find a solution to the problem he was currently facing. His eyes moved restlessly across the river.
"Trouble solved. Draco, give your horse to Glenice. You will ride with me. This way, we can get there on time," said Cedric.
Abaddon comes from Hebrew and in Greek is Apollyon, which means the Angel of the Abyss as recorded in the Book of Revelation to John chapter 9; The king who rules them is the angel of the abyss; its name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon.
"Honestly, I enjoyed it," Draco said, breaking the silence. Harry turned to him with a confused face. Draco spoke again, "You're annoying, but it's not so bad when you're just sitting around like this,"
But because Doctor Jason seemed to be accustomed to walking freely in and out of this room, he caught them off guard, and they let him as he please. Who would have thought that Doctor Jason was the dreaded Hyde?
Draco blushed at Harry's words. He violently slammed the book on the sofa and stood up. "I think I should go,"
Fresh blood flowed profusely. Hector lost his left arm, and he was screaming in pain. Draco couldn't help but fall to the ground and move his feet back away as far as he could. The hem of his dress was splattered with fresh blood, and it all looked like a horror movie to him. This was all real. His breath was racing as Hector tried to press the wound with a cloth.
The music had stopped, signaling the dance was over once Draco climbed the last ladder. The black-haired woman seemed to be looking for someone. Who on earth was My Lord referring to by that woman?
"See! It's all just rumors! Prince Troya isn't dead! Goddess Athena is protecting him!" Such exclamations were boisterous as soon as Draco started stepping on the shrine grounds.
With his face still hardened, Harry pushed open Draco's door with a grunt. However, when Harry's feet had stepped on Draco's room, the man immediately remembered that if someone was sick in the room, he shouldn't make a fuss.
"Well, you understand that even with just a glance, it's easy to notice your resemblance to..." Alden stopped his words, noticing Draco's blank stare. "Are you all right?"
However, the other side of Harry, who was filled with prestige, argued disagreed. He is the Alpha of the big pack that everyone knows. Where would he put his face if someone noticed his absence and questioned the reason behind it? Seriously.
"Excalibur!" Draco exclaimed, and the mark he saw under the thumb of his left hand flashed, and immediately the sword was in his left hand.
"What? No. They saved my life earlier when in the palace of Sparta I was almost kidnapped, and they helped me escape," Draco explained.
Draco pushed Cedric's chest hard so that there was a distance between himself and Cedric. Suddenly, Cedric was shocked and was about to ask what happened, but when he saw Draco's calm face, a strange feeling gnawed at his heart. Didn't the young man feel a flutter when Cedric touched him?
This time he wouldn't satisfy Harry. Draco wasn't Harry's boyfriend. He was a man and not a doll he could tweak at will. Harry had to realize that.
Doctor Jason's face flushed with embarrassment. He looked sorry he had said those words. "Ah, I'm sorry Draco, forget it that I said something like that."
"You were forgiven, but now you owe your life to the prince of Sparta," Ares told the envoys. "I also want to hear what's going on in Sparta. I hope you're not hiding anything from me," He continued.
"You have to bear Potter's child. It doesn't matter if you love him or not. Your mother gave birth to you with that gift, so don't waste it." Lucius said in an overtly authoritarian aura.
"Little boy, how about we also get to know each other? I'm Aphrodite," The Goddess of Beauty forced Draco to focus on her.
Draco looked at the man as if he had grown two heads. "Whatever. If I'm still in London, let me out of here. I can go home by myself," Draco started to get up from the bed.
It was clearly a god's weapon. The Greeks were not familiar with such weapons, but the Spartan warriors will not fear death. For them to die in the line of duty was an honor. They only hoped that Hades would not drag their souls into Tartarus for defying the gods.
Draco was stunned by Harry's apology. He looked at Harry carefully. Harry Potter apologizes! What was Draco's dream last night? "Why are you apologizing?"
"Where's Louis? Get him!" Draco shouted out his manager's name. Again, a foreign language came out of his mouth. He also felt a strange horror, as if he had become a different person because even the voice he heard was not the same as his own voice.
But why didn't the man do anything to him? It doesn't mean that Draco wanted Harry to do anything to him. But that memory, the image of Harry, who was so enthusiastic about it, could not disappear from his mind.
With his terrifying chuckle and laugh, Doctor Jason swung the knife, and for a second, Draco felt a sharp pain from the sharp metal cut in his arm.
Tired of seeing the crazy pair in front of him, Cedric immediately took wide steps towards the royal ballroom. Cedric ignored his brother as the king shouting his name in anger. Harry suppressed the anger that was currently holding him back. However, he had to calm the girl who was still sobbing.
Draco bit his lower lip as he felt a strange sensation start to creep upon him. He didn't know what this sensation was called. Draco was experiencing something this crazy for the first time as a sudden heat rose between his thighs.
Draco walked without direction. All the guards and servants that Draco accidentally passed looked at Draco with prizing eyes. Even in a simple dress, Draco's beauty radiated so extraordinarily. It was as if he had just descended from heaven.
Harry chuckled at Draco's scowl. "You hate me?" The man casually stood up, unashamed by his muscular naked body. “Look at me, Draco, you left marks on my body. You were very excited last night, like a cat in heat clawing here and there to be satisfied. And for your passion last night, I'm not sure if you hate me."
Worst case scenario, he could be dead by the time Ares found him. He was lost in the mountains of Olympus. A place where human-eating monsters roam freely. When the monsters met the smell of humans—they would act like sharks in the ocean when they smelled the blood of their prey.
Draco chuckled. "My mother likes growing flowers too, so I guess that's natural for some women." Draco felt sad when he remembered his mother's face, who always cheerful when talking about flowers.
Even the secretaries and household financiers were affected by Harry's rage when the man checked the reports in his study room earlier. Now everyone was hiding from each other, trying to avoid dealing with their master, who is so intimidating, like a wounded bear.
Doctor Jason walked over to Harry and tried to explain. "He's fine, Mr. Potter. We've stitched up the wound on his head. But he lost a lot of blood, and we are currently looking for blood from a nearby provider…”
Draco watched Harry, who still had a flat face, approached him. Draco gasped for breath. "What did you do to him?" he asked haltingly, trying to calm his beating heart because of running.
"It hurts!!" Draco screamed, trying to push Harry's body. His body screamed between pain and desire to be filled with lust at how wide Harry's cock was opening him. A tear dripped from the corner of his eye, the remains of his consciousness lingering.
Harry saw Draco lose consciousness, begin to sway while tied to the chair. Harry's attention is distracted, and he stands up to grab Draco. At that moment, Doctor Jason, who was already battered and tried to grab the knife that Harry had thrown earlier, grabbed it and directed it to stab Harry from behind and...
Cedric raised an eyebrow for a moment to confirm Draco's answer before the man finally sighed and smiled. "Love is like that. Love will drive you a little crazy, so you have to go through a journey that you have never gone through in your life. But, that journey will lead you to believe that love is the need of all human beings."
Suddenly her sadness evaporated as she repeated those words in the back of her head. She beamed at Draco, her savior.
But he decided to calm down and carry out his original plan, which was to befriend Hadreda. The Star Tower looks quite deserted, but that doesn't mean the building was neglected. There were several Titans seen working there and carrying scrolls of parchment in their hands. The Titans lived like the ancient Greeks, including their clothing and food.
"I'm your husband, you're my wife, and it's been five days since you arrived at my palace, Troya. Strangely, we haven't even slept together. What are you waiting for? Are you trying to oppose me?" Ares said a little fiercely to Draco. He immediately regretted it. His intense desire for the prince seemed to have disturbed his composure.
It felt like Draco wanted to cry again. He didn't know what to say to the brunette. Draco was afraid that the words that came out of his mouth today would have a massive impact on the Shinia Kingdom and the Malfoy family in the future.
Again, a strange sensation appeared. Draco has been having these weird dreams for days. And the dream repeats itself over and over again, a dream within a dream, as in the Inception movie starring the legendary actor, Leonardo DiCaprio.
Harry chuckled, approaching Draco like a lion stalking its prey. “I would never expect such a thing. I just wanted to get more of a taste of your milky skin.” With that said, Harry fell to his knees on the shower and slinked over, so his mouth was precariously close to Draco’s now half-hard member.
Draco gulped, his back stiffened, but fortunately, he could still maintain his expression until he was sure that Harry was not aware that he was currently overcome by extreme fear and nervousness.
He shoved the tip of his sword at the bull, trying to get him to move first. The monster rubbed its hind legs as if taking a stance. Then it shot towards Ares with three pointed horns aimed at his heart. Ares quickly dodged. His alert and trained eyes immediately plunged the tip of his sword into the bull's neck deeply.
Draco was dumbfounded at Harry's words. He kneaded the bottom of his Omega outfit, which was slightly dirty and tattered. Draco had, of course, taking part in a celebratory event which caused him not to be amazed by the atmosphere of the event, which was full of festivities and luxury.
"As if!!" Draco screamed sharply, trying to restrain himself from crying. “I don't belong to anyone, let alone an evil monster like you! I want to get out of here. I'm sick of you, sick of everything in here. I want to go out!!!!"
The front of Harry's living room was very grand, with old-style architecture that somehow seemed modern. The marble floor glistens with ivory, and the large pillars in the living room of a similar color soar high, paired with shades of red and gold. Harry led Draco to a large round white staircase and again half dragged him up the stairs. They both stopped in front of a large white door.
Draco turned his head again and gave Harry a defiant look. “Either what you said about giving me freedom is a lie, or you simply like to control and irritate me. I can take care of myself, and I hope you don't bother me."
Draco's fingers explored Harry's body, and the man left him to do what he wants. Finally, as Draco's lips curiously want to taste Harry's cock so bad, Harry raised Draco's head with a sharp, misty gaze full of lust.
Draco wiped his tears harshly and glared at Harry. "All this because of you!" exclaimed Draco accusingly. "If you don't involve me in your life full of enemies, I won't experience this!"
Harry didn't break their kiss right away. He wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, deepening their kiss. Draco had no reason to refuse. He immediately wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, feeling comfortable in this position.
"God, this is heaven." Harry breathes out, panting harshly. "After this, I will teach you how to satisfy me," The words echoed through the room, like a promise from the darkness. Draco had utterly lost consciousness, his body writhing with a tingling pleasure as the pain finally disappeared. It was replaced by the hot pleasure that gave severe tingling throughout his body.
Harry asks him back, Draco's feelings numb enough to turn him down - he uses the excuse that his parents were preventing them from restarting their relationship because he knows that the same cycle will repeat itself.
"Yeah," Harry muttered, watching Draco's reaction. “You should be afraid, Draco, because they'll do anything to hurt me through you. You're safe here, with me. And I'm sure you're conscious enough to know that you better stay here. "
"I'm just feeling confused, Your Majesty. The night will soon come. Arabelle definitely needs you," Draco replied with a sincere smile, as he did to everyone when he was talking.
Their queen looks very gentle in their eyes, and whoever hurts their queen, they will never be silent.
"Your Majesty, since everyone is gathered here, maybe we can start the journey and... since Arabelle will be coming, it looks like I'll be taking the same carriage as Prince Cedric," Draco suggested with a smile.
Harry gritted his teeth. He couldn't bear to play around like this anymore. Being around Draco, naked and ready like this, made him feel almost crazy. This young man had to give up on him.
Harry was as surprised as Arabelle, but the man managed to control his emotions so well that his face didn't show the slightest look of surprise.
Draco sneered. "Why should I be nervous?" he retorted in annoyance and walked forward, standing right next to Harry. Just to prove that he wasn't nervous.
Ares laid back his lover's body on the bed, took a strand of her golden hair, and then kissed it. Aphrodite smiled. She still remembered why she was attracted to Ares. His masculinity and charming physique were some of the main factors. He has everything a human could want.
A second later, Draco's body slammed through the surface of the pool and sank. He didn't try to save himself, letting his body sink deeper into the pool. His eyes darkened and closed, and who knows how much water he swallowed. His breath was tight, and his lungs felt like they were about to burst.
She bit her lower lip deeply. The black-haired girl tried to stop herself from crying loudly again. Draco’s getting worried.
"No. It's better to ride alone, but I would definitely prefer to take the carriage if you are by my side. Your pretty face can definitely dispel my boredom." stated Cedric regardless of the circumstances around him.
Draco's cheeks flushed red, not just because of the deep meaning in Harry's words. But because of the way Harry pronounced it, it was so erotic and meaningful that it seemed as though Harry was uttering something sensual from his usual words. And Harry seems to be on purpose.
"I don't want you as my lover, and I'm not ready for anything to do with you." Draco vigorously argued.
Harry came into the room, only minutes after Doctor Jason had popped a few spoons into Draco's mouth. Seeing the scene before him, Harry's emotions flared up. He stared at Doctor Jason and Draco with death glares. Doctor Jason, who seemed to be able to read the situation, quickly stopped feeding Draco, while Draco just stared at Harry lazily while chewing his food.
Harry was silent. He again directed his focus to the increasingly crowded state of the city park. Children who walk full of enthusiasm, their tiny hands intertwined with their mother's, accompanied by their soulmates. The boys who walked together exchanged jokes that Harry didn't understand. They all seemed to be enjoying each other's moments, looking free and unencumbered. As for himself? Busy looking and messing around with something meaningless.
"Alpha Harry," Draco called, hoping he hadn't made the wrong move. "I am pleased to attend the event with you." Draco could feel his cheeks heat up as several soldiers and comrades watched from a distance.
Draco’s stared in surprise at Cedric's words. Uncontrollably, the blonde took a step back with his eyes already staring at Cedric with horror.
Harry rolled his body next to Draco, the soft hospital bed making their bodies pressed against each other. Harry's hand grasped Draco's fingers, then guided the fingers to his cock.
"That is a lie, my King! There has never been anything like this before! A real god doesn't need to ask a human for permission to marry a human!" Hector tried to convince his King.
With a swift movement, Draco put the robe on. He didn't want himself to go back to making Harry because he was moving slowly.
Draco bawls at the intimate penetration, arms and legs clinging tighter and tighter onto his Daddy's strong body. He wants to be bred just as much as Harry wants to cum in him.
Without thinking, Cedric immediately lifted Draco in his arms. Panic was clearly depicted on that handsome face. Cedric ran fast from the training ground.
With a gentle smile on his face, Draco gave Terence an even look. He didn't like it when someone else brought Shinia's name into a vortex of trouble that even Shinia didn't care about.
He shed tears, but he didn't let out a single sob, nor did his body shake violently, as noblemen usually do when they cry. He kept shedding tears and let the raindrops brought by the strong wind hit his dress. Until a warm feeling enveloped his body. Without opening his eyes, Draco could tell that someone had just draped a blanket over Draco's frail body.
It had been fifteen minutes since Ares left his residence to look for the prince. He rushed and forced Herion to run faster. The prince could die at any time, even a few seconds after the local earthquake occurred. But Ares knew that his new wife was still alive because the bracelet he gave him had a transmitter.
Harry stood that night in the middle of the garden in front of his house, hoping the cold air would soothe his desire that had set his body on fire. He stared at Draco's window on the second floor.
"What are we going to see here?" Draco asked, confused because Cedric stopped right in front of the entrance to the garden of the royal labyrinth, which was nothing special.
"I thank all the guests who have taken the time to attend the welcoming party of the Shinia Kingdom's entourage. Hopefully, this party can entertain the Shinia Kingdom's entourage. It can also create even closer relations between the Delion Kingdom and the Shinia Kingdom." said the King of the Delion Kingdom, whose hair had almost turned white in a loud voice.
"It turns out you're a little ambitious, Troya. You have a war god as your husband and want to announce it all over Olympus,s right? Basically, you want to have a wedding?" The god guessed.
What if this moment becomes his path to determine his own destiny? Maybe he can escape. He had a horse not far from there. Draco tried to ride it several times over the past two days. He was able to ride by keeping his back straight and making his horse go straight. It should not be difficult to get him to run. Draco thought about tying himself up so he wouldn't fall.
Pansy took a deep breath before speaking. "You know how annoyed we are with him, but if that's what you want, Dray..." Pansy trailed and patted Draco lightly on the shoulder.
Draco was led into a room with wooden furniture and shades of brown and elegance on the second floor. Alden sat on the sofa in front of him and motioned for Draco to sit down.
"I don't want to, sir Hector. But this is my duty as a Prince of Sparta. Therefore, please spare me," Draco spoke softly this time to the older man. Troya's half-hearted attitude all this time—has raised hope for Hector.
"Last night was you and Lord Ares' first night. Usually, the lovers wouldn't be too comfortable after—"
"Yes, Your Majesty. I'm sorry," said Arabelle. She got up in a hurry and stepped out of the gazebo rotundas, located above a small river.
Harry smiled. The blonde obviously wanted to challenge him. And Draco's presence in the room caught his attention. He wasn't even interested in his papers anymore. Harry folded his hands on the desk, and he watched Draco, who was acting as if he is reading.
"Have you forgotten the royal rules? A man is forbidden to enter someone's room at night, especially if that someone is married. It seems you really want to be punished." said Harry coldly.
Curiously, Draco stands on his tiptoe, trying to clearly see the man's figure, Harry Potter, a figure who was feared in the business world because he doesn't hesitate to crush anyone who gets in his way. Anyone who dares to fight Harry Potter will end up in tragedy.
"No need, it's not important to him. Our job is to bring the Prince of Sparta back to Olympus," Alastair responded.
For several hours on the journey to Olympus—Draco was busy observing all the messengers. The first was Attica. Although she seems fierce, she turns out to be very friendly and soft-spoken. She seems to try to be on par with the men around her and refuses if they try to help her.
"If this Lady is curious, she can tell me. I will answer." Draco said as he placed the small white cup decorated with gold flowers on the table.
"You look so stunning tonight, Your Majesty Draco. Even I'm sure the goddess of beauty would be jealous of your current beauty."
"Now go back to your room and wait for me to come to you, Troya," Ares ordered as if to confirm who the boss was. Ares had taken off his mask and let Troya see his true nature. Ares had plenty of time to seduce him back. But for now, Troya had to know that he already belonged to the God of War and could never leave his dominion.
"What the rumors said was true. You are very charming and humble, Your Majesty." said the concubine in the admiration which made a gentle smile decorate Draco's face.
Draco jumped up, grabbed the liquid soap, and then rubbed it over Harry's tough, muscular back. The touch made both of them gasp. Harry couldn't even stop his groan; his manhood was already so hard like a rock down there until it hurts, protesting to be satisfied.
Unaccompanied by anyone, Draco walked down the halls, room after room, until finally arriving at the end of the hall, with walls completely made of glass, reflecting sunlight all over the hall and a magnificent view behind the glass. The view of the crimson rose garden that vines and fills the small garden there.
Hera sighed and folded her arms. "Now, regarding your human wife. He must leave Olympus, Ares. He will only make your position difficult, put an end to the ridiculous game between you and the other gods. It's all not worth it for your future." She advised.
"Of course, Duke Richmond," Draco smiled as he rose from his seat. He took Charles's outstretched cold hand. Is that man sick?
Subconsciously, Draco pursed his lips slightly as the boy lifted his head to look at Harry's face. Draco looked at Harry expectantly.
Troya was so beautiful that the king didn't care about his pride. He shouted to convince everyone that Troya was his biological son who was blessed by the beauty of Aphrodite. The king even lied that Athena had spoken to him in a dream about the blessing. Usually, the real Spartan men do not hesitate to cut off the neck of their cheating wives, but the king didn't do it. Draco knew that Troya could have been born blonde due to a gene mutation or something. It seems that the queen was also not too stupid to dare to cheat on the king. What was clear, Troya's beauty has saved the life of his mother and himself.
Draco stayed where he was. He gently rubbed his eyes over his dress. He didn't want anyone else to see his tears. After all, Draco was a queen of a great empire. He couldn't seem weak in front of anyone.
Draco failed to hide his surprise. His face went red from being caught by the other boy. "I thought you were still in the hall," Draco responded, trying not to sound stupid.
"Wait," she remembered something, "Why do you say I'm lucky? Aren't I unlucky if Potter likes me?" Pansy looked at Draco suspiciously.
"Is that true? Have you ever seen a snake?" Draco asked. He looked for bite marks on his wrist, but they weren't anywhere. He doubted the testimony of courtiers about the cause of his illness.
Instantly, confusion filled Draco's head. Right now, there was only one thing running through Draco's head, why do people who were in love always have irrational thoughts? He did not understand.
Draco Malfoy really was an angel. With his heart and attitude, that young man was too ravishing to be a human.
"I found your body covered in wounds and losing a lot of blood." Draco could feel the dark atmosphere rising from Vlad's body. His presence looked really threatening and intimidating. "I gave you my blood."
She trotted over to Draco with all four of her charming legs, then reached out to shake his hand. "I'm Hadreda. Are you the Prince of Sparta?" She said, introducing herself.
Harry wasn't in the least bit interested in looking at Ron as he said, "Do what you want to do, Ron."
Draco thrashed, trying to hold on, but Harry didn't care. He kept dragging Draco with all his might. Until Draco does want to have to drag along than his hand must break. Harry dragged Draco up the stairs and back to the room where Draco was locked. Some of Harry's guards had gathered, and Alden was standing there. Apparently, he managed to contact Harry and was released from the bathroom.
Draco had grey-colored eyes, just like Cedric. He also had a pair of blonde eyebrows that were very thick and lips with a natural pink color, lips that succeeded keep any man yearned.
"I forgive you because you just woke up from your long, deep sleep." Then Harry turned to the refrigerator next to him.
"That's right, Troya. I hope you won't think of me too badly. I married you for fun. From what I hear, it seems I have freed you from your father's restraints. Isn't this a good thing?" Ares was still holding the prince's hand and walked around his palace.
"I thought I was going to marry a crybaby and timid prince. It turns out you're quite mature even though you're still very young,"
Someone also raised their hand. "I don't think so, because the devil has an ugly face," he said, and everyone laughed except Draco, Luna, and Harry.
However, since the crazy words Cedric said to Harry the other night and the defensive lines that came out of Draco's mouth, Harry had started to feel restless.
Draco, riding his horse leisurely with Attica, frowned slightly when he heard the envoy speak. Were they really not human? He still had a hard time believing it.
He proceeded to look for books on how to exorcise demons or kill demons. Most of them only tell how the devil was expelled from hell and came down to earth to tempt Adam's descendants. Everything was clear. Draco already knew about it. But how about driving them away or at least keeping them from coming near him?
Draco was stunned when the man tore the dress from his chest. A dress as beautiful and fine as it was already damaged, with rips of cloth and threads stretching out, and the crystals scattered with a soft clink on the floor.
Draco carefully peered through the adjoining window and found a man in an expensive, formal suit standing at his door. From his appearance, he seemed to be a good man. But looks can be deceiving, can't they? Draco still couldn't believe that such a kind and smiling Doctor Jason was actually a ruthless psychopath.
"If you do anything to him, I swear you'll die terribly." This time Harry couldn't hold back his anger. Harry glanced at his bruised knuckle, which he used this morning to beat Tom up so badly that the man was lying covered in blood, unable to even beg for forgiveness. "I will kill you slowly and horribly so that you will feel every second before your death."
After Draco was dry, Harry tucked him in. He then laid down himself and drifted off into a satiated sleep.
"Ah... Umm... She's our new employee, Mr. Potter, excuse her impoliteness. I've never taught her how to bring drinks to guests as important as you," The club owner interrupted nervously. His face looked worried, seeing Draco halfheartedly serving his important guest. With a scolding look, he warned Draco. “Come on, Darcy, introduce yourself to Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter has chosen you to be his drink partner. It is an honor for you. You should be grateful."
