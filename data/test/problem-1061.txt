Malfoy seemed to give up on whatever he was looking for in Harry’s eyes. “I’m —slightly claustrophobic.”
A sound came from one of the beds in the dormitory and he jumped, startled —oh, right! The snores! He’d forgotten about that!
He watched as the lips that were making him crazier earlier blew on the hot tea and closed softly around the edge of the mug so he could sip slowly. Oh, how he wondered what it felt like if his dreams did come true and he had it wrapped around his-
He gave his friend a handful of coins in exchange for the shredder, which was immediately declined, so he was forced to throw the money on the counter on his way out and run off.
Sorry for taking so damn long for such a short chapter! I just wanted it to be good! Thanks for reading and give me your honest opinions please!!!
“What do you mean by losing… the most… the most important thing?” a few caughts interrupted him, but he did his best to speak clearly.
“No! Can’t you just listen to ME for once? I might not be the one with brains, like Hermione, or the one with funny jokes and comebacks, like Ron, or even a ray of sunshine and a powerful source of strength and confidence, like Luna and Ginny. But I’m the one who recognizes dark magic a mile away, I’m the one who defeat—“
At dinner that day, Harry was so focused on discovering what Malfoy wanted, or what he was plotting against the trio, that he didn’t eat a thing.
He wanted to ask what was going on, what he was doing, but he felt another thing, something that pleased him very much:
“But, you don’t know who that was?” He questioned, still a little shocked to know she had kept that from Ron and him.
“Alright” Harry whispered to himself. “Just ignore it and shower as fast as you possibly can...” he nodded to himself and started to wash his hair.
How could he had forgotten about the Marauders’ map?! How could he had forgotten about something as important!
“Wow, wow,come here and calm down, mate.” Neville said “Why have you been going through my stuff? Oh, you know what? It doesn't matter! I know you, Harry, and I know you would have a really good reason for that so come on I might have something to help you.”
He had even helped Ron carry his books from the library and had given him one of his books about plants that was really helpful.
Flitwick just waved him off and pointed at Hermione, as to allow her to answer the question and for her to rest the eager arm she kept wiggling around, trying to catch the teacher’s attention as always.
He looked at her skeptically, “What are you talking about? Ginny likes Malfoy too? But I thought Luna and she—“
Once everyone was firmly standing out of their brooms—with the team in the front and the newbies standing behind, panting from all of Ginny’s exercises— Minerva started.
“Yeah— wait, NO! That bet was in second year and I betted twenty galleons! The one where I told you Ginny played in the other team and—“
twoooo chapter !!!!!!!!!! just to apologize!!!!!!!!!! i know its bad but later there will be smut (son i promise)
“—just give me a second, alright?” He heard her ask the brunette who had just asked her something. “Potter” he heard her voice closer to him now, followed by the sound of multiple steps hurrying away sensing a fight.
After an almost peaceful day where nothing happened, his suspicions started to die down and he was finally able to stop looking around every five seconds and pay attention to what Flitwick was saying.
Their eyes locked for a brief second and Malfoy mimicked Harry’s actions with his pink tongue, as if in a warning, and used his wand to clean himself.
Now was his chance to dance with ‘Mione while the pair of raven haired people yell at each other and maybe if they’re lucky, they’ll get distracted for a long time.
He had been so distracted by this whole Drarry thing that, when he looked at the clock, he realized he was already twenty minutes late!
“No, no! You know what we could talk about? The next game, it’s Gryffindor against Slytherin, right?!”
“That’s not what I asked you to do. I asked you to wait a day. One day so we could get an emergency removal order.”
And he was on the screen. His face, sweaty and red, beside the image of someone sitting in the Gryffindor side— their face was covered by a hood and Harry did not recognize who it was.
He was just bloody frustrated, since the guy he… whatever, had just rejected what wasn’t even an invitation. He only did this because he remembered the story Sirius told him about giving his Black heirloom to Remus. However, as it seems, Pansy is the equivalent of what Tonks was for Remus to Draco.
Harry knew that if he turned his head a few centimeters, something would happen. Whether that was good or bad, there was only one way to find out.
His leg, under the table, started bouncing and his eyes turned to the clock, counting the seconds and wishing he could alter time to make it go faster, and the soft nibbling at the slight bulge in his pants that was an effect of the magic the blond was doing while still nibbling his quill, making the feel transfer to him. And, oh, was it good.
Harry was so bloody tired! He hadn’t slept, again. Those dreams had the excellent idea of haunting him again that night. Making him imagine himself licking, kissing, straddling and doing every unimaginable thing with Malfoy.
Ron thanked Merlin when he found it and made his way back as quietly as possible; always checking the Map to make sure he was safe.
Once they were in Diagon Ally, Hermione was the first to run to a book shop. They reluctantly followed her and searched for every book needed.
He stopped questioning himself, tough, when he felt his zipper move and, as he quickly looked down to check, it was, in fact, opening by itself. Was he so fat that his pants were snapping at the zippers?
“Y—yeah, uh,” he forced himself to clear his throat after noticing how uneasy and uncomfortable his voice sounded.
He had been sitting in the back row, just like him, but a few chairs away, beside another Slytherin girl whose name he didn’t know. Neither seemed not to notice his fixated glare on his perfect pointy nose, or the ring of hair that fell on his face, because of a lack of the usual ginormous amount of gel there, or even the way his lips moved along with the words when he was silently reading something to himself. Who’s the oblivious now? He thought, a smug smile creeping into Harry’s face.
He closed the bed`s curtains and grabbed his map and cloak- he wouldn’t forget them this time. He said the usual words and searched the map until he found exactly the probably Latin name he was looking for.
Right before their mouths crashed into each other, Harry stopped. Making everything even more awkward.
“How do we get out of here?” He asked after a while, putting his head in the middle of his knees, breathing heavily —and all Harry could do was par his back gently.
Most people were already in their respective dorms- even though Harry was oblivious enough to not notice Luna and Ginny in the Ravenclaw one, nor did he notice Anna and Neville sneaking to the kitchens where he had just been a few moments ago.
Ron nodded, processing everything in his red head. “So—“ he started “if you think someone should be with another person, you put their names together and shit them?”
A shiver ran down his spine and he couldn’t help the moan that escaped his lips, which made him cover his mouth with his hand and bite hard, although it didn’t help much when the fingers inside him started moving.
He admitted that he pitied Malfoy for what he’d been through—he’d even testified in the blond’s favour in the Malfoy Family’s trial—but everyone from both sides had suffered and lost something during and after the war.
“Enough time to inform you of the fact that the weasel is not funny, people don’t laugh at his jokes, they laugh at him. Also…” he got closer, slowly, forcing Harry to press his back against the wall behind him, caging him there with his arms. Placing his mouth less than an inch from his ear, he continued, “your friends don’t need to know everything you do…”
The couple went to the other side of the room to talk to some friends of Luna’s about some kind of weird creature flying around their noses and left ears.
A deep part of him wished it had been like that in reality, while the rest of him mocked him for being so weak and allowing Ron’s words to get stuck in his head and for kissing that sinful mouth.
For a few seconds, neither of them moved, eyes locked on each other, breathing heavy, until Harry just leans forward and hugs Draco.
Harry apparated in the train station—he was now of age and had already passed his apparition test with Hermione’s help, since she made it on her first attempt and he had needed lots of practice, but, anyway, who’d fail the chosen one?
“What,” Ron said, stepping forward, and Harry saw the fire burning the ginger’s eyes and face. “in the name of Merlin, are you, SNAKES, doing here.?” He spat the question as if it was poison burning his mouth.
Harry’s insides were screaming when he approached her — without his invisibility cloak — because he didn’t know how to explain that he needed the best perfume a person could have just to impress his enemy.
Harry rolled his eyes at their childish behaviour and made his was towards a free spot near the shower, the rest of his teammates —except Ron— followed suit.
He grabbed his towel and, just as he was about to grab the handle of the shower’s door, someone had grabbed it before him.
He took the bracelet off of his pocket and extended his hand for Malfoy to take it. He did and raised a questioningly eyebrow.
“Yes, it is! I’m sure we’ll win, but everyone else is more excited about the kissing cam than the actual game. Honestly, after the last game, I-“
“Uh, Harry, don’t you think you’re doing it again. Being obsessed with Malfoy, I mean. I know, the last time you had a real reason, but now—“
It felt good, as if he were sleep walking, as if he were under water and there was only silence and failed attempts at breathing, moans he wasn’t sure where they came from and hands wandering everywhere, drinking each other’s neck, arms, ands, waist, hips, backs—
“Yes, this is actually not the first time someone has ended up here for the same reasons. Usually only muggle-borns are affected, but half-bloods are affected as well.  That's pretty much the only advantages of being a pure blood,
The Slytherin struggled against him, freeing himself from Harry’s grasp and sending him the deadliest of glares, before saying, “your insults stink, just like you, Potter!” And leaving the raven haired boy with his green eyes wide open.
Once they were in their locker room, Harry came face to face Theodor Nott —who was a bit taller than him, but not enough to make him back down.
His knuckles knocked on the door at least five times with full strength until someone opened it. He passed them, without even looking to see who it was, when a hand grabbed his shoulder and pressed his back against a wall.
“Harry?” came a dreamy, soft voice from upstairs; which calmed his nerves immediately. He ran to her, arms stretched out, and hugged her as strongly as he could and only noticed he was holding his tears when they started falling down his cheeks, nose and chin, wetting his friend’s shirt and his as well.
Oh, he was gonna make that cunning snake regret everything! Specially offending his smell! He didn’t stink!
He watched a few metres away, as Harry waited downstairs for the twins who went to the girl’s dorms to search for the best perfume they had.
“I’m sorry” he said between kisses, “just, let’s not leave any visible marks, I don’t want Hermione and Ron to—” he regretted the words as soon as they left his lips, knowing fully well that was not the right theme to bring up at a moment and in a situation such as this one. Why couldn’t he just enjoy the feeling of those soft bruised lips, instead of ruining his chances of getting laid.
“It’s alright.” Said the raven headed boy, “we wouldn’t get anywhere, anyway...” he shook his head and letting Ron see the blush in his friends’ cheeks. What wasn’t Harry telling him? “What I’m trying to say is... Ron, if you and Hermione are meant to be, you’ll be, but if you can’t... you can’t be with her in that way.. I, uh, I hope we can still be friends after—“
During the first week after the Headmistress’s announcement, everyone was too curious for their own good.
Draco tried to reach for it, but Harry looked him dead in the eye as he grabbed what he now identified was a letter- since it still had a pretty looking formal piece of green and silver ax, how slytherin of whoever wrote it- placing it inside the contraption. It swallowed the letter and shredded it to tiny pieces.
Lastly, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about the whole Malfoy thing. The way he had pressed the blond’s soft body against the wall and the Death Eater comment and— HOLY GODRIC GRYFFINDOR!
Harry hadn’t seen Neville much this year. They only saw each other at night because of the intense training his friend was getting. He was studying Herbology with Sprout every morning at six in the morning and the rest of his day was spent with her, except for meal times, where the professor and he would eat in the Divination Tower to hel Trelawney with some sort of plants that she said would be very useful in the future of seers.
“We are aware of that fact, yes, MsGranger, but this one was created specifically for the Wizarding World. The  Department of Magical Games and Sports wanted to test this ... thing, for the next Quidditch World Cup and they asked me, as the Headmistress of Hogwarts, if we would be willing to do it.”
“I solemnly swear that I’m up to no good.” He whispered as his wand was pointed to the map and the words and images started to appear.
‘Yes, Harry, I’m still here’ the red head thought with another exasperated sigh. “Yes! Calm down, would you? There are other more important concerns to have in mind.”
Then, as suddenly as possible, the door to the dorms opened and Harry hid the bottle behind his back and looked at his fellow Gryffindor.
Every single night you after that unfortunate one, Harry sad unable to sleep more than a couple of hours straight.
“Harry?” A familiar voice asked, bringing him back to reality. It was already dark outside and his stomach was empty.
“where did you find this?” he asked, mesmerized. “this is a bracelet used in the Black coming of age tradition.” He continued.
This had to be easy, compared to the difficulty he’ll have to leave his dorm unnoticed by Filch or MrsNorris.
The day after such a moment, one would imagine nothing worse could happen. However, one probably didn’t know Draco like Harry did, after years of watching in a—he now realized—starker-ish way which would be creepy had it not been reciprocated by the blond stalking him back.
Ginny jumped and Ron looked up, both blushing; with that look Teddy makes when someone catches him stealing a cookie in their faces.
Unfortunately, as soon as his confused expression appeared, a disgusted expression modified his entire face. He turned around an faced the lake, throwing the contraption to the side.
All Harry could think of was, ‘what would that feel like if it was me?’, as his eyes closed so he could take a deep breath and calm his heart beats.
He passed a few people who gave him funny looks and pointed, but he knew it was because of his hair, which he had forgotten to comb.
“Malfoy.” Harry said, stepping in front of the door so the blond boy —who was at least one head taller than him; Harry knew he had grown during the summer, but not this much— so he was blocking the door.
He pointed his wand at a far away wall and jinxed it with a spell Hermione had teached while they were on the run.
He’d need to enter Slughorn’s locked classroom. Well, he thought, this must be easier to break into than Gringotts.
It talked about coincidences and the butterfly effect, it explained how to make certain events turn to our favour and benefit.
“Luna!” he yelled, and a few kids- probably third years who just found out there are dirty wizard magazines under the sink of Moaning Mirtle’s bathroom- ran upstairs looking bloody scared.
He then proceeded to change his position and placed himself over the other boy with an elbow on each side of his blushing face—purposefully neglecting the member brushing against him, aching for attention— and whispered, biting the earlobe carefully, “Thank you for everything, Potter, you’re right and we should absolutely do this again, another day.”
That's what Hermione and Ron called it now, but Ronald was not respecting the schedule they made a few weeks ago.
She didn’t answers right away and after more than a couple of seconds he asked her to look at him, placing a finger under her chin and making her look up.
“Ship them, yes, but—“ when Hermione noticed, she was no longer in her boyfriend’s lap, but in the couch, while the ginger jumped up and down in front of her.
Hermione nodded—still in a bit stunned to know what was happening with her boyfriend— and took a cloak, that looked normal but they both knew wasn’t, from her backpack.
“Ronald Bilius Weasley I—I don’t know how to tell you this... we’ve been friends since first year and—and even though we were just kids—I think my feelings for you started then. It almost killed me when you and Lavender were together. But now—now we’re together and I couldn’t be happier — couldn’t feel luckier. And even—even if—if you still need a while to say it back, I-I love you, Ronald, you’re the love of my life, just like those books make fun of me for reading, you’re my soul mate, my best friend and everything I need in one person and—“
He turned the water off and wrapped the towel around his waist. He had brought a towel for his hair as well, but now remembered he’d left it with the rest of his clothes.
In a movement unexpected by both of them, Harry got up and hugged Izy as hard as he could, whispering “me too” into its huge ears—remembering why he started wearing different socks in each foot.
Draco had his back turned to him, shirtless, so pale he almost reflected the moonlight, soaked from head to toe- which explained why the normal silver seemed so dark. It was pass midnight, he’d probably freeze like this, what the fuck was he doing?
George was walking down the stairs to go the kitchen and, on the way, he passed the big window in the hall.
Well, maybe he didn’t sleep in the girls’ beds, but Harry was sure he wasn’t someone who cuddled after sex.
Firstly, she would be at dinner reading a book instead of preoccupying herself with boys. Since when was he the one with boy problems? He was a boy, for Merlin’s sake. Well, if he was having boy problems, like a girl, maybe he should act like one and try to have the uncomfortable talk of “Where is this going?” “d’you really have feelings for me, or blah, blah, blah…”
He was face to face with the person who he considered his worst enemy, right now, and—instead of anger—all he felt was pity, sadness and shame on himself.
Many memories dances in front of his eyes, as if he had his head stuck inside a pensive. Memories he had tried to forget about.
The moment their eyes met, Harry remembered everything that had happened in his dream— sinful thoughts all around his head now— and his cheeks started burning because of the embarrassment he was feeling.
Of course she doesn’t even want to spend the entire night dancing in painful shoes or yelling at other students for bringing unauthorized alcohol.
“Wow” She said out loud. Ron’d kill her if he knew she was doing this behind his back — Harry probably wouldn’t care, since he was too obsessed with Malfoy to even care or notice what his friends were doing — but she was sure Ron would AVADA her, or try to make her vomit slugs. Thanks Godric, when he discovered, she’d just tell him she was trying to surprise him, even though he didn’t like surprises, because they made him feel stupid and oblivious for not noticing.
And Hermione smiled to herself as she shifted closer to the fire in the room, whilst hearing Ron’s exited words about ‘no more obsessions or complaining about the ferret if they shag each other!’
His eyes scanned a shinny bracelet, there was something familiar about it, yet he was sure he’d never seen it.
It was only when Harry heard the sound of a wet body pressing itself gently against the wall — as if resting — that Harry noticed he’d pressed his ear against the shower’s wall to listen more closely.
Harry sighed and helped his friend take care of his teeth, warning him to be careful with what he said to a woman when she was in a bad mood, specially women as powerful and dangerous as Ginny and Hermione.
In his way down the corridor, Harry started remembering why he was in the this mess in the first place...
But she wasn’t dumb. Actually, she had a few documents which said OUTSTANDING  who proved her point.
The raven haired boy turned around and his green eyes focused on Neville Longbottom. He had the old looking map Harry was looking for in his right hand and a big smile in his whole face and, as always, that smile made Harry feel calm.
Behind him, someone started laughing, scaring him and making him turn around so fast he slipped and fell on his ass, hurting himself.
After Quidditch practice, which Harry missed too, Ron and Hermione were in the Gryffindor common room.
But he was cut off by the door of the shower, next to the one they were arguing for, opening and, without another sound, Malfoy slithered in after its earlier owner left.
He arrived, to his relief, at the Gryffindor dorm and tried to ignore the people staring. He went straight to bed.
His rage was so bloody hot, that he kicked the door with all his strength and, as soon as the pain hit him, started cursing. “Oh, for the love of Merlin; Ahh!”
He reached up with his hand and pulled the other boy down and their lips met again. The legs he had pressed together were spread apart by the knee that came down between them, rubbing against his member and making him throw his head back, momentarily stopping their kiss, which was replaced with kisses down his exposed throat and near his chest. When Malfoy ran out of area to kiss, he started taking Harry’s shirt off and, once done, he kissed down his chest and stomach like he had done the other night.
Once he was walking towards Hogwarts —hood down— trying, again, to not be noticed, he decided to pass honey dukes just to buy something sweet. Candy always made him feel safe, for some reason.
And, once again, after the last Quidditch practice, in the shower, he ended up with his ear pressed against the wet tile wall and wasting the little energy he still had on “touching himself”, while hearing the Slytherin moan.
His knees gave out and he fell to the ground with an exasperated groan of frustration as the weight of his lack of luck pressed his shoulders down.
“What do you think the sorting hat is trying to warn us about, this year, ‘Mione?!” Asked Harry, oblivious as always to what those warnings meant.
Harry shook his thoughts out of his head. He really needed a hobby besides Quidditch, or a girlfriend. Yes, a girlfriend would be ideal.
He left the kitchen and made his way to his dorm. He was feeling a strange lightness in his chest he hadn’t felt since his first years at Hogwarts when he left the Dursleys, saw his friends again and was allowed to use magic. He felt relieved, as if there was nothing to feel guilty about.
“Potter.” Malfoy said, just as Harry passed him. His eyes were red, but not puffy enough for Harry to think he had been crying, just enough to remind Harry that the boy— man— in front of him was also human.
The ginger haired boy was, as planned, waiting for Harry to come down for breakfast —he’d removed the silencing charms on his best friend’s bed the previous day so he would wake up with Seamus’s snores.
He could feel them staring as he tried to dress, but as he was still wet, his clothes cling to his body and he only blushed more.
Harry felt the weight above him shift and disappear, but he remained there, breathing hard, eyes still closed, cock still hard and wet. His head empty for a split second, before the weight of everything fell on him.
Grey eyes focused themselves on Harry’s, probably looking for some sign of mockery, but he wouldn’t find any because Harry wasn’t joking. He sat beside Malfoy and sighed.
But, in the dream—which he couldn’t call a nightmare because it had felt bloody good — instead of being stopped after the bite, it had only made everything more wild.
He sometimes wished Harry would come out just like the spider. He remembered Hermione explaining him some muggle expression like: had to come out of the wallet, or something weird like that.
As Ronald left the Great Hall you could hear Hermione Granger’s sigh that sounded a lot like, “I’m dating a bloody fangirl” followed by the sound of her head hitting the table several times.
“Are you afraid of getting caught? Of telling your friends that, when they aren’t in the room, I’m making you moan and squirm under my fingertips? Are you scared that, if we are in the same room as them, they might notice how hard you get when I touch you here?”
Draco’s breath was hot, which made white puffs of air escape his mouth and he looked like a real dragon and Harry’s cock, for some reason, twitched in his pants.
They entered, tiptoeing, sat on his bed, - which he hoped he had made this morning instead of leaving it so messy- closed the curtains and sound proofed them. “Drink it” he said as he forced the tea in Draco’s freezing hands and leaned closer to take a few sea weeds out of his hair.
He turned the water on and took off his boxers. He washed his face first and leaned against the shower’s wall, trying to ease the tension on his shoulders by cleaning them with a soap Luna had given him, saying it was relaxing and helped whatever part of your body you used it in to ease tension.
Bloody hell how were his eyes still stinging? He wasn’t even crying, nor was he even sad or anything.
Hermione was, obviously, as close to the teacher as possible; Ron, however, was sitting right in front of him—since Harry was in the back row—and, of course, the person he had paid the most attention to, Draco-the bouncing ferret-Malfoy.
There they stood Merlin knows how long. Harry Potter hugging Draco Malfoy, whose arms were by his sides, fists clenched and tears shining in his closed eyes.
He had always assumed Malfoy would be one of those who slithers their way into a girl’s bed and then, in the morning while the girl is still asleep, he escapes her bedroom and tells his friends everything he did as if it was just another victory.
Malfoy pressed his lips in a thin line , his pale eyebrows almost touching. His arms were holding Harry in place, not letting him fall. One of them holding his waist —he could feel those slender pointy fingers even through his robes— the other on his arm.
‘Mione would die if she ever saw this. She does not deal well with messy stuff. She’s totally freak out.
“Very well, Gryffindors, we are all here to win! So, people who are already in the team—“ she looked directly at Harry, the seeker, Ron, the keeper, and Dean Thomas, the chaser. “—you all go and practice. Free the snitch for Harry and you, Dean, try to score against Ron so he can practice his defences.”
At first, Harry even attempted to look away and entertain himself; however, after what seemed like a decade, he decided to entertain himself by looking at the blond.
After they were all calmly sitting at the Gryffindor table, eating breakfast, Hermione noticed some ... interesting things in her friends’ behaviours:
Neville, for starters —who was sitting beside her— was making cute faces at Hanna Abbot— who was with her friends at another table —and Hermione had never seen him so happy, not even when he had killed Nagini, or when he had discovered he hadn’t really killed Harry in their fourth year.
So Harry will be too focused on Malfoy’s personal life to notice the spell on the floor of that hallway.
The only thing she asked in exchange of this little favour was a dance with her boyfriend. She needed to tell him something very important.
He needed to be careful so his oblivious friend wouldn’t get suspicious, so he followed him around in hopes to perfect his plan.
The three of them threw themselves to the couch in front of the fireplace and said, “I’m exhausted!” In unison, looking at each other and asking, “why are you two exhausted? I DID NOTHING!” And getting up and going to their respective beds, feeling bad for lying and suspecting each other.
Going back to his prior order of business: teasing and marking his property, Draco stroked his tongue slowly up Harry’s extremely hard cock.
The tears forming in her eyes and setting her dark long eyelids made him worry. He could hear the sound of his blood running through his ears and he swore I’d he concentrated a bit he would bruh able to hear both of their heartbeats. The music simply playing as if it was simply a background whisper.
Two red ones— who he supposed were Ginny and Ron— a brown one —who he suspected was Hermione — right beside the blonde, almost white one— who, by the colours he could see in the person’s clothes, even though blurry, he’d say was Luna.
Then, when he thought he was too tired to read the million cards he still had left and the hundreds of thousands of chocolate frogs to eat, he decided to read at least one more card.
She sat down at the Gryffindor table, next to Ginny and in front of Harry and Ron, who was ignoring her for what happened in the train.
Every head turned to see whose bitter voice that was. And, to every one’s surprise, they found a head of blond-silver hair and silver-like-steel weary eyes glaring at them.
He sneaked his head out of the courtains just to check if his mates were asleep and-as that fact was confirmed- he left with his cloak around his shoulders and map in hand.
She sighed and kept nodding and saying "sure", "mmhm", and other things everytime he asked something.
The bloody cat was looking at him, head tilted to the side as if asking something or making fun at him, for being able to see him through the cloak.
Only, when he was just passing Madam Malkin’s, something in the window of a shop he didn’t know—probably a new one— caught his eye:
“There they are” he whispered to himself as he saw one of the cupboards with a small note saying “Amortentia”.
Ginny called them all to the ground to tell them they’d never win against his the other houses if they kept getting distracted like that.
Then, with his index finger, the Slytherin cleaned the remaining of the milk from his throat to his jaw and licked his finger.
For example, that morning, when Ron had missed breakfast, Harry had been sitting by himself at the Gryffindor table— Hermione was too stubborn and kept saying she needed to study for her N.E.W.T.s even though she already knew every word in every book in the school’s library and Ginny and Luna were too busy focused in kissing and cleaning each other’s throats to notice he was there.
He pushed the other man— who, he noticed, was at least a head taller than him— away, cleaned the non-existent dust from his robes and said, “don’t touch me, Malfoy” through clenched teeth.
Once he unlocked the damned door with a simple “Alohamora” —honestly, Slughorn trusted his students too much —he entered the classroom and searched for the vials of the potions they had finished some weeks ago.
“This is… alright, I guess…” he murmured, swallowing hard with embarrassment when he felt the blond biting his shoulder, distracting him from the third finger that slid in.
He followed it with his eyes and saw it flying above the heads of the people sitting on the Ravenclaw side of the pitch, near his blonde friend, Luna, with her lion head costume.
After some unsuccessful tries and some spells that rebounded and almost hit them both, he was finally fed up, “give up, Malfoy, you’re fucking with my patience.”
As usual—and as if nothing had happened —Malfoy started sneering as soon as they laid eyes on each other —Harry responded with a disgusted look of his own.
He, wildly, left a trail of hot and wet kisses up both of Harry’s legs, always avoiding the main priority where he certainly wanted to be kissed. It was easy to notice his arousal, seeing as he was as hard as Draco himself, if not harder, the tip of his cock glistening with unshed precum.
His hands grabbed onto the edges of the table for dear life. He knew he had to control his magic, since the last time he had gotten this excited, at the Dursley’s house, he had made some stuff around him float involuntarily.
The next day— their second day of the Christmas holidays —Ron could start putting his plan into action, everything was ready and in place for step one.
He was really thankful for how supporting Hermione had been lately, he hoped the gift he bought her for Christmas would please her.
So, Ron was alone, in the library, surrounded by books. However, he was not studying. He was planning what to do during the holidays to make Harry understand that Malfoy was going to be his husband, whether he liked it or not.
When the silence got too awkward for both of them, Ron got up, patted Harry on the shoulder and left him to go tell the news to his “sidekicks”— Yes, sidekicks, plural, since Pansy had convinced Zabini to join them on this quest when he started complaining about Malfoy’s constant rambling about Potter—in this ship.
And lastly, the Slytherins. Parkinson was certainly going with Zabini and, come to think of it, Harry didn’t know any other female Slytherin. I mean, sure he wouldn’t have gone with any of them, but he felt a weight on his shoulders for not taking his time into knowing them as he knew his classmates from other houses. He always said he hated Slytherins, but this opinion was based on what he knew about one or two.
He turned around, searching for the source of the noise, however the face he had was the most painful facial expression the Boy Who Lived had ever seen.
When Harry noticed the odd look some Slytherins were giving him — including Malfoy— he followed their stares and got a view of the towel wrapped around his waist. And there it was: the one that was supposed to be used for his hair because it was really small, the only thing covering him and, as he looked over his shoulder, he saw the towel he should had used, near his sweaty Quidditch clothes.
So eager that it made that time when she was waiting for her OWL’s ressalta to come out seem like she was relaxed.
Merlin, he was so close he could smell…mint? In Draco’s breath and those lips looked so sinful and once he licked them Harry could swear his dick was so hard it would explode, it hurt so much. Malfoy got a little closer and raised his hands  near Harry’s face.
“Malfoy, I know.” Harry huffed, quiet and gentle with his words. “I’m sorry, I messed up.  I feel terrible that I had even put you in that situation and I swear it will never happen again.”
The first two weeks upon their return to Hogwarts, much to Headmistress McGonagall’s approval, saw a unification amongst the former separated houses.  Pansy Parkinson had even approached Harry in the common room on a Wednesday night within the first week, to apologize to Harry in front of the rest of the returnees. Harry simply stood from his seat on the sofa and pulled her in for a hug, cutting off her jumbled attempt at the apology.
“My mother can help us set up some blood wards,” Draco started. “Oh don’t turn your nose up at them Granger. Molly has her own established at The Burrow.  We’ll establish some blood wards but otherwise we should be just fine.  Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go handle the discharge paperwork then we have to clean up Grimmauld and finish preparations for the day after next.” Draco turned on his heel and strode from the room.
Harry was pulled from his nightmares violently as he quickly registered the tight grip of another’s hand around his wrist.
“Potter.” Draco’s firm voice cut across the din, snapping Harry out of his rage.  The spirals of magic stopped and the air returned back to normal but the 6th year Gryffindor still hung in mid-air while his two friends cowered behind Harry in fear. “The boy, he needs to go to the hospital wing.”  Draco approached Harry slowly. “Let McGonagall deal with them.” Draco added quietly.
Hermione had been complaining for the third week straight about Harry not letting his magic get out of control, ever since that corridor incident months prior, Hermione had been nagging him to read the books she recommended to him on controlling wandless magic.  Harry would just huff and and brush Hermione off, leaving her disgruntled and disapproving of him for the remainder of the evening.
Harry left Hogwarts that morning, apparating straight through the wards as if they were nothing and directly into the sitting room of No. 12 Grimmauld Place.  Harry closed the floo and adjusted wards, he needed time alone and uninterrupted.
.” Harry whispered, and with a gentle breeze of air, the fiendfyre was gone. “I’m so sorry Draco.” Harry reached out to Malfoy, pulling the blond into himself and settling back down onto the bed. “The night in the Room of Requirement still haunts me too, I think I might have been having a nightmare about it.  Please,” Harry begged. “I’m sorry.  I would never hurt you.”  Harry wasn’t sure where that last confession came from but it spilled from his lips and he knew it was true. He squeezed Malfoy tighter to his chest, willing the tremors to ease.
Right after their graduation from Hogwarts, Draco had moved into Grimmauld Place with Harry.  Narcissa was living in the South of France and Harry couldn’t bear to part from Draco, their relationship was still so new and vibrant.  Draco had been hesitant, if only for the fact that his mother would be by herself, but she encouraged him to begin his life. The pair had visited her at the beginning of the summer, after graduation.  Harry had been locked in a sitting room with Narcissa for nearly two hours while Draco nervously paced the entirety of the house.  Upon their emergence, they both looked as if they had been crying and Draco was frozen in place, scared as to what his mother would say about their relationship.  She merely kissed Draco atop his head and hugged Harry, then told them to be happy.
While the others would demand answers, and yell and scream and cry, Molly simply pushed past the shouts and embraced Harry.  She saw what the others had not, she saw the light in his eyes.
That very evening, by dinnertime the entire school understood that the only thing worse than a dressing down from the Headmistress, was a dressing down from none other than Harry Potter himself. And while the rest of the students all chatted away in mixtures of awe and fear, the very few Slytherin children ate their dinner in peace, hopeful that their continued years at Hogwarts would not be in fear.
“Yeah! This filthy Slytherin! They’re all death eaters! How dare any of them even come back here after what happened”
Harry’s heart warmed at the easy contact and he smiled, practically ear to ear.  He quite liked the sound of Malfoy’s laugh he realized.  As he was wont to do, he disregarded all thought for consequences and pulled Draco into him, crashing their lips together. In a small moment of panic, Harry considered pulling away and apologizing but Malfoy grounded himself with one hand on the back of Harry’s neck and the other on Harry’s thigh then deepened the kiss all in one movement.
“Oh come off it.” Harry laughed, letting himself fall backwards onto the bed, pulling Draco with him.
“You tell me you sodding arse! I heard you screaming so I came to wake you up but the moment I touched you, this happened.” Draco rushed through the words as he tried to shrink in on himself, shaking in fear that any moment the flames would consume them despite the defined radius they had given the bed.
“All right, okay, quiet down,” Robards said, voice barely above a whisper. The murmurs died down. “Thank you. Our potions department has been working on something that will lessen the effects of the Succubus’s power to enthrall people, which should keep all of you focused enough to trap her in a Lock Box,” Robards continued, “Potions Master Parkinson has assured me that it’s nearly done, so before anyone heads out to follow a lead, go down and see her.”
spell. The effort to cast made his legs feel like jelly, so he leaned on the brick wall of the alley to keep steady. Spells rolled off her, so he’d resorted to hitting her with actual objects and it was working, at least it would until he couldn’t gather the strength to focus on casting.
In an effort to right his stance, Potter leaned himself on the side of the sink, getting very close to Draco. The smell of liquor floated towards him like a potion wafting in the wind of an open window. It was an overwhelming smell that made Draco want to barf.
It took me an hour to sort my area out, even with the help of a few cleaning spells Molly Weasley taught me, but finally all the papers were in their proper places and now I was terribly late.
And if it were under any other circumstance, Harry might not have given the article a second thought, but Hermione was right; it definitely would make his crush skittish. Admittedly, Harry knew if he had seen an article like that about the other man, he would have given up entirely.
When all was finished Harry took a deep breath and drew the shining and shimmering swirls of magic back into himself.  Then with a nod and smile, he reopened his floo and made for The Burrow.
“You need to speak to someone about your magic Potter.  This is becoming dangerous.” Draco spoke gently as he pulled himself out of bed and left Harry’s room.  Harry could only watch Draco leave, his brows furrowed.
“Malfoy!” Harry grunted, trying to nudge the blonde off of him so he could sit up, only when Malfoy moved just a bit, Harry caught a glimpse of the source of the heat.
It was now just two days away from their first Christmas post-Hogwarts and Harry offered to host it for everyone at Grimmauld.  Harry and Draco had been prepping Grimmauld Place with expansion charms, just three days prior to Christmas Eve, which was when everyone was set to arrive.
“Fiendfrye Potter! That was fiendfyre you were fucking with! You could have killed yourself, or worse me! Or burn down this bloody castle! You need to fucking control yourself Potter!” Malfoy was yelling, his chest heaving, and his eyes went red and glassy.
Harry placed a kiss atop Hermione’s head and whispered an apology.  “I’m sorry Hermione, I promise not to leave again. I just….” Harry faltered, having not been able to find the right words. “I needed to remember something very important.”  He finished, the glint of smile twinkling in his eyes when Hermione looked up to him in confusion.
Ginny had given him and his teammates an “encouraging” speech about not losing the game or they’d lose their lives.
That scared him above anything else, being with someone who only cares about his fame and makes him feel alone anyway.
He wanted to start another conversation when he noticed he had stopped talking, but he just couldn’t, he didn’t have any more will power to keep himself from touching the blond.
Now it was the beginning of the second week after the announcement, and everyone knew their time-tables.
The solution for a problem like this would be to think in a smart solution; the smartest person Harry knew had to be Hermione; so, in his place, What Would Hermione Do?
A loud moan came from the shower next to him— so close, that he jumped upon hearing it— and it was extremely close. So close it felt as if the person moaning was in the same shower as him.
“You, you..” he mocked and rolled his eyes. His facial expression then proceeded to change completely as if he had just had an idea. He took his wand out of his pocket- which he hadn’t even noticed was there before- and made the mug disappear after drinking every single drop of it in one swing; then proceeded to lean closer to Harry, slowly and silently.
He cursed himself, he cursed his wet sheets, he cursed Malfoy’s lips and tongue and he kept cursing.
The pressure inside him eased and he realized the fingers were not there anymore. As he prepared himself to protest, something else was asking for entrance. His eyes shot open and he melted in the mattress, like a small poodle of pleasure.
Harry turned to the Slytherins once again and, before he could open his mouth, Blaise Zabini stepped forward towards Nott and threw his arm around his friend’s shoulders. He had strong arms, with strong, dark hands and long fingers with clean fingernails, Harry looked away.
Harry rolled his eyes for the hundredth time that day and, fearlessly, reached forward and placed the Patronum bracelet in the blond’s pale wrist. It glowed shapelessly for a few seconds but then went back to normal.
“There’s no need to get so edgy, Potter. It was just a question.” And Harry was pretty sure he heard him whisper “for Salazar’s sake” under his breath.
Malfoy looked down, his grey eyes turning silver, like steel. “Shut up, Potter!” Harry could see him loosing his patience, which was good, because angry people couldn’t control themselves and maybe Harry could force him to tell him what he was hiding. “You know nothing about me, about my life, about my—“
He thought about the possible loophole for a while and connected his lips with Malfoy’s cheek as fast as he could.
That thing was—no, not Umbridge wearing tight lingerie or anything of the sort, if it were, slowing down would still be too fucking fast—it was Hermione and her judgmental face.
A pair of lips touched his and he couldn’t take it anymore. He pushed Draco’s chest and when he was lying on his back, he sat on top of him with a leg on each side of his body, kissing him passionately with his hands undoing his shirt and grabbing anything his fingers felt that wasn’t Draco’s perfect, pace, spotless skin.
Another finger slid inside him and he shifted, pausing the kiss and scratching his partner’s back harder.
When things started to get faster, he involuntarily circled Draco’s hips with his legs as a way of slowing him down and savoring the feeling. His hands rose from the back to the other boy’s hair and deepened the kiss, keeping their hips moving in synchrony until he accidentally bit Malfoy’s lip after his hand moved down Harry’s side, up his leg and down again, resting on his buttock dangerously close to a very personal area of his.
He’d prove them wrong! He’d make them see the evil ferret that Malfoy was! The sneaky snake! The—the — whatever, Ron was the one who made the jokes. He just needed to prove them wrong.
He tosses his clothes aside, grabbed his towel— the right one, this time— and entered the first empty shower he saw.
So, why had he woken up? He questioned, after noticing the clock indicating that it wasn’t even eight am yet and the Great Hall had just opened for breakfast.
“Wait! Wait! Wait!” Said Harry. “So, they didn’t admit it? You have NOT won yet! Ginny could just.. I don’t know but—“
He entered the library and searched for the restricted section. He was not really sure why they didn’t have better protection on this section as it was restricted, but he was surely grateful for that.
“I asked you, MrWeasley, what’s the last ingredient in the potion, after the powdered moonstone? You were listening to the lesson, weren’t you?”
So, today, the sixth day after THAT nigh, he promised himself he’d do whatever was in his power to bring Draco back if he didn’t show up at breakfast.
“I was thinking that, maybe, the school library might have the book in looking for” he answered, looking proud.
Harry knew he’d have to be smarter, just not sure how to do that. Therefore, he stayed alert the whole day. Always sitting at the edge of his seat, ready to jump at the smallest of signals; wand never leaving his hand, his neck already hurting from looking around him constantly.
He was aware that he could glamour them and make them disappear easily with a flick of his wand, but he was only going to do so if any of them were visible. He wanted to hold onto this moment for as long as he could.
Malfoy raised his head slowly —probably to prevent any sickness — and waited for an answer with a questioning look.
It was the first day of classes and now, at the first class they had after lunch— potions— Ron was trying to stay awake while Slughorn kept talking about— about an Aswinder’s egg being the first ingredient in— in some potion and— and it  had some kind of rose thorn and— and other stuff he couldn’t place.
But, above all, Draco Lucius Malfoy was a real, huge, bastard, because he made Harry Potter feel something other than happiness when he didn’t show his face at school—something he shouldn’t feel.
“I have to create a name, like — like Harco or something!” He yelled, and Hermione knew he really wanted to see his best friend happy, AND to have some drama and action in his life again, since he truly missed fighting and all.
Then Blaise started saying, “kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss,...” and everyone started to understand what was happening and did the same.
He sat up and looked around, noticing he was alone in bed, but hearing his roommates’ snores around the room.
He only recognized it as his because he saw the unmistakable silvery blond hair. He didn’t even notice if he was alone, if he was with his pugfaced cow of a girlfriend, Pansy Parkinson, or if he was even alive. Honestly, he didn’t care at all. And that was what he expected him to do this year as well, don’t care and let them be.
He hid behind a tree and listened to their conversation as best as he could over the giggles of the girls a few meters away observing them as well.
Malfoy dropped his head on the mattress and laughed quietly, making his already blushing face heat up even more.
“After our locker room being destroyed, we’ve been given permission to use yours; just like the other two houses will share theirs.”
He would have given up on the whole “Drarry” plan just to star there with her, if only Pansy hadn’t appeared beside them and warned him that it was time.
“Calm. Down.” He told him countless times, totally fed up after listening to his best friend complain about the blond ferret for literally more than three hours straight — ha, he couldn’t even think about that word without laughing, at least not with Harry in the room.
Harry pull his face from the wall and looked at Ron’s eyes with his half closed ones and sighed— probably for the thousandth time that day.
And after the look he saw in Malfoy’s piercing eyes, after hearing those throaty moans, he started to think of himself as insane.
They all had their stoic expressions on, as cocky and arrogant as ever. With that ‘Slytherins are better than everyone else’ look and actions.
That’s it! Maybe he just needed to fulfill one of his fantasies and get Draco Malfoy out of his system and imagination. Just try it once and never think about it again. To do that he just needed to be… bold. Thankfully, boldness and stupid bravery was the main Gryffindor traits.
“So, I think I've got something for you—and before you can say anything— don't worry, it's Hermione's.”
She was a bit like Wood, sometimes. If you didn’t do everything perfectly at first, you’d hear a two hour speech— literally. But, thanks Merlin and Morgana, she wasn’t as obsessed as Oliver. The shitty part was: she way scarier; like when she adopted MrsWeasley’s features to scold them.
After half an hour he was bored. He had never spent this much time alone, isolated from everyone else, his only friends were his thoughts.
But— he told himself, as he and the rest of the team entered the pitch for the big game— if he ignored his exhaustion, he wouldn’t feel it, nor be affected by it.
Harry’s eyes locked on Malfoy’s. He thought he saw a flicker of surprise in them, but it vanished as soon as it had appeared and Harry wondered if it wasn’t just some trick of the light reflecting in that steel grey.
“I don’t know, Gin. He is starting to notice stuff, he wants to go to the library AND he had an ‘Exceeds Expectations’ in our Charms assignment!” Suddenly, her chest filled with dread and her eyes focused on Ginny’s. “Do— Do you think he was poisoned or something?”
Draco threw him to the bed and, as he tried to sit up, he felt the bed shift and, as he looked up, he saw the blond above him, a hand on each side of his face.
Of course this bastard of a riddle had to appear and remind him that, besides being in a hurry, he was not Hermione bloody Granger!! Morgana, did he want to hide his head in a hole somewhere.
And when he looked up again, after kicking that piece of underwear under someone’s bed, he saw them.
“Oh, hey, ‘Harry.” Said George, noticing the boy with green eyes for the first time that morning “so, I was walking —“
The other three made eye contact as if asking ‘what the hell is going on?’ and Hermione decided to speak.
Everyone nodded and they made their way to what was going to be —even if they didn’t know it yet— a very important night.
Well, now he was already in front of Luna’s dorm, waiting to hear the riddle so he could go in, so no point wasting time on going back to his dorm with all this anxiety.
“Explain?” George finished Ginny’s sentence. “Go on then, I’d like to know why you were an inch from snogging in the garden and why you, dear innocent Ginevra, are blushing so much..” the ginger finished with his best imitation of Molly.
“Thanks” he said and noticed how raspy his voice was because of the time he spent in the Hospital without drinking anything. “How many hours have I been out?”
His back was straight and stoic, the only proof of Draco’s discomfort being the way his shoulders were poised. He was a very good actor, if you weren’t looking as closely as he was. Also, if he had to admit it, with all the stalking he did he probably knew him like the back of his own hand.
He felt whoever it was towering up on him. He could feel their breath on his face and the negative energy coming from that person. As he finally opened his eyes, he met two dark ones, almost black, and recognized the face of the one and only Blaise Zabini. His muscled arm was pressing against Harry’s neck, making it hard to breathe. His eyes were also kind of crazy looking, reminding him of the first time he looked at the eyes of a Death Eater behind their mask: desperate for something.
“You will remain curious then, as I do not frivolously dole out compliments like a after dinner dessert.” However nervous Draco was, he would not let Mr. Potter best him in conversation. There was still a bit of their old rivalry in their back and forth. The same push and pull like planets getting caught in each other’s gravitational pull. Fighting for dominance.
Harry closed the space between them and wrapped one hand around Draco’s waist, drawing him in. Then he slipped the other behind Draco’s neck. He could feel Draco’s pulse pounding under his touch. It was racing like a hummingbird’s wings.
Since inspiration struck, I am positing another chapter. This is actually really great since the holidays are coming up and I may not have as much time to write.
“The pOrion’s partners clause that says you have to do what I say,” Potter quipped. His mouth turned up into a smirk that was dangerously handsome. He stopped walking and turned to face Draco now.
“I cry when I’m drunk and serious. Don’t worry, it will pass,” Draco said, matter-of-factly. He didn’t take his eyes off Harry, and another tear slid down his cheek.
“No fang marks,” Harry found himself saying. “Oh, and there’s the fact that every victim was shriveled up with all their Life Energy gone.”
I didn’t even pretend to look ashamed. Hooking up at a party was the least terrible placed I’d ever hooked up with someone. The loo at the Leaky Cauldron ranks higher on that list.
“It’s too cold and most of them cannot be found in the Forbidden Forest. This is pointless,” Malfoy whined.
Malfoy turned abruptly once inside the back room and waved his wand to shut the door behind me. “Well, let’s get whatever all of this is over with.” He held out his hand to me.
When I came to, we were just outside of Hogsmeade. It would be a five minute walk to Seamus and Dean’s cottage which according to Ron sat just on the edge of the village and the Forbidden Forest.
Potter scoffed, but Nikola ignored him and moved closer to Draco. The whole situation hit Draco like a quaffel to the stomach. Nikola was coming on to him in the cellar. He was moving closer and closer, until Draco found himself backed against the wall. The stone was like ice on his back. He shuttered away from it, knocking him forward into Nikola. Arms were suddenly wrapped around his waist and Draco’s head was swimming from the wine. He chided himself to drinking more than he should. He was completely out of control in the situation and that worried him.
Neville spun around. He seemed startled. The clippers in his hands almost caught the side of my face as he steadied himself. “Blimey, Harry. I could have taken an eye out.”
“Take it from someone who's only ever been around wrong his whole life. I know it when I see it, and you aren’t it. I get that you feel...like what you want and think and feel doesn’t matter. You are trying to distance yourself from that image everyone has of you, so you can figure out who you are without the fate of the world on your shoulders, and you can’t do that with someone who only sees you as that guy. It doesn’t feel real, or at least you don’t want to do all the right things just because they are ‘right.’ You want to be sure it’s what you want.”
Harry writes the letter for Draco and is in Denial. Ginny comes in and he hides it. Hermione comes to visit.
Hermione and Ron arrived a moment later. They did look visibly winded. Ron clutched his side and a gasped for air. “Shite. I need to get back into the training program. Being Junior Auror in Charge has made me soft.”
There was a moment where Potter leaned in, grasping Draco’s robes in his fist, when Draco thought that maybe, just maybe, something would happen, but then the familiar sound of Robards’ voice reached them and Draco pulled back.
Neville looked uncomfortably back and forth between Hermione and the mystery professor who I decided I liked, if only for the fact that she had some serious knuts to confront Hermione. I admired that.
and then turned to see Draco twisting the top off the bottle. He seemed to glow against the absolute darkness around them. That pulse of excitement surged through him when Draco lifted the bottle to his mouth, wrapped his lips around the top and took a long swig.
Draco decided to play with Potter. If the man wasn’t disgusted, then Draco would take this as far as he could tonight because he could see no other opportunity like this ever again presenting itself. He would enjoy watching Potter be aroused by another man sucking his cock. So he shoved forward into Nikola’s mouth again—his eyes locked on Potter’s.
“Me?” Draco asked and turned to face the mirror instead of Potter. If he looked at Potter, he was sure to lose it. He watched his reflection. His face was flushed. It bothered him that his hair looked unkempt. He tried to tuck it behind his ears again. Maybe he should have let Luna spell his hair into a braid after all.
I had to shake my head to keep focused. Ron and Hermione were arses for sending me in here alone. “Malfoy, can we be serious for one minute?”
“Do you even hear yourself?” Draco retorted. He wanted to snap back with an insult, really give it to Potter good because he was pissed off at his partner’s reckless behavior, but then that’s what he always did, and it wasn’t getting Draco anywhere. Each time they argued, he felt Potter closing off more and more. And while that hadn’t mattered in school when they didn’t need to work together, now it was less than ideal. How would he ever become a trusted Auror if he couldn’t make it work with the first partner they ever assigned him to? And their Golden Boy to boot?
Running out of ideas, Harry leaned his head forward to rest his forehead against Malfoy’s. Their noses brushed slightly and Harry let his eyes flutter closed. For a moment, he let himself savor Malfoy’s quiet breathing and the sweet smell of Malfoy’s breath.
Draco clenched his jaw. The potion made him overly aware of Potter’s next to him; static electricity crackled between their bodies. All the hair on his arms stood at attention, as if reaching out for Potter. Every second felt like it was stretched to an eternity, and he hated this potion and how it made him think of everything he wanted but could never have.
“Merlin, it’s good to see you,” Seamus said slapping my shoulder. “It’s been ages. I don’t think you’ve come ‘round since the wedding. And before that it was months since we saw you. How’ve you been?”
“Yes, you have made that abundantly and boringly clear, Potter,” Draco drawled as he surveyed his captive. Draco noticed that the man had new cuts on his wrists and ankles where he clearly attempted to escape his binds. And the muggle way by the looks of it.
Draco was inconsequential and had always been. Even when Mr. Potter helped his family after the war, after Draco made a very public mistake in siding with the Dark Lord that cost him his position in society, he was inconsequential. It was not something he had done for Draco, rather something he had done simply because he was that ridiculously noble and insufferably moral.
,” Luna paused and then looked over at Potter again. The man was egging Weasley on to chug a Butterbeer. Granger looked positively revolted, but Girl Weasley seemed very amused. Her freckled face was alight with laughter and her red hair swung behind her elegantly.
Draco nodded. “I accepted it a long time ago. Accepted that he wouldn’t feel the same way. It made it easier to stay in control when the potion hit. That doesn’t mean I didn’t feel the effects, just that I could control myself better.”
Harry pulled up and sucked at the tip of Draco’s cock. He knew it drove Draco mad when he teased like that. He wanted to hear Draco beg for it. It was his favorite part; hearing how badly Draco wanted him.
His reflection still seemed to want to run back up to the castle and the safety of his dorm, but he ignored it and unlocked the door. The bathroom door swung open before Draco could even blink and a very drunk Harry Potter stumbled inside. The man’s face was flushed red. His right hand was tightly gripping the neck of an unlabeled bottle of alcohol. It swished in the bottle. The clothes he wore were some muggle fashion that Draco never fully understood; just a plain white t-shirt and a seemingly old pair of jeans. Seemed more like clothes to garden in rather than wear to a party.
This was the first time Harry could remember getting to look at Malfoy uninterrupted in a long time. Malfoy’s usually calm, uptight exterior seemed to be slipping away under the effects of the potion. Harry even thought that his hair seemed less tame than it had back in the lab. Where it was usually painstakingly styled to stay out of his face, now it fell forward in strands, some falling in front of his eyes, reminding Harry of the tragic heartthrob Jack Dawson in
Yet, just as he was about to close his fingers around the snitch and feel the rush of victory pulse through his body, Draco soared in from the left, grunting resolutely, and snatched it out of sight before Harry could.
Harry couldn’t believe he’d spent so long making Draco angry when making him laugh was so much more pleasant. Harry felt himself leaning his head back against the tree, utterly relaxed for the first time all week. He closed his eyes and let himself enjoy the moment. The pressure of New Year’s and everyone around him suddenly talking about futures, and the fresh start that the next year proposed for him had only served to make him think about all the things he wasn’t ready for...but here, under the tree with Draco’s shoulder against his, he felt all that fade away.
Amid the after dinner rush of students in the Great Hall, Malfoy stalked over and pinned Harry in a corner. It reminded Harry of a very aggressive Flamingo attacking the water. All legs and pointy nose, but still sort of eye-catching. He narrowed his eyes and fixed Harry with a serious look then mumbled, “You
Draco laughed eventually, obviously deciding that Harry had to be joking. His laugh, his smile, those lips…
Draco crossed his sitting room and stood in front of the fire. He knelt down and picked up a log from the pile next to the mantel. The hearth roared to life as he tossed the log on the pile. The manor was quiet outside of the flickering fire.
“Oh, I like it very much,” Harry muttered, thinking of all the very not studying things he wanted to do with Draco. He started humming the bridge of “Your Song” because he knew it made Draco smile. He sang it to him all the time, sometimes changing the lyrics about the eyes from “you see I’ve forgotten if they’re green or they’re blue” to “you see I’ve forgotten if they’re gray or they’re blue” to match Draco’s smokey eyes that always pulled him in like a black hole of lust.
Dean pulled Ron by the arm and ushered him to the outside area where I could see everyone standing near a long white table with food and drinks. There was another table to the right with all the housewarming gifts. Ron placed his on the pile and followed Dean to the small group.
She looked at me and in her eyes I could see every little thing I’d ever done wrong to her looking back at me. Each time I showed up to a date drunk, if at all. Every argument about my behavior, my choices, my rashness. All the times she begged me to get help and I told her she had no right to tell me how to heal. I felt guilt like I’d never felt it before.
In the cellar of the Manor, the Death Eaters had created a prison with cells and shackles, all to keep certain witches and wizards out of the way. The cells were small rooms that were charmed to keep their occupants from performing magic. It was quite clever and quite necessary, since, in the end, Potter and his friends ended up being more valuable alive than dead.
“You would have told Robards, and I couldn’t take that chance. I needed to find this thing and stop it before someone else died.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “That is the fourth time Luna has tried to set me up this month. Is it written on my forehead that I haven’t dated anyone in two years or something? I mean, Merlin’s cock. Do I look
Frustrated, Draco said, “You know, you wouldn’t need to make such a mess if you’d just use my system.” He didn’t look at Potter as he pulled his chair out to sit. He gathered the fabric of his robes and made sure to sit so there would be no wrinkles.
“Again, why not get it from the Hogwarts stores?” Malfoy asked. I had no idea what the ingredient looked like, let alone where it could be found, but he clearly knew. “I’m sure someone in the castle has a bottle for you. Or you could come to Mordeau's. We have a bit in stock.”
The sun had set long ago, but the air still held the warmth of a summer day. Draco hardly looked like he’d broken a sweat, but that wasn’t a surprise. A year’s worth of friendship had given Harry a peek behind the curtains in regards to the neat and tidy man sitting next to him. He often cast charms to freshen himself up. Harry joked that Draco was vain. Draco joked that Harry was frumpy.
They were close now, dangerously close. Harry felt a heat settle in him that had nothing to do with the bonfires, and waited for Draco to speak. Every inch of him tingled with the anticipation, and probably the after-effects of the Solstice Punch.
“I’ll take it under advisement,” I snapped. She had some serious knuts. “Can you just spit it out already? Why are you here?”
In spite of himself, Harry thought about how this must look. The pair of them whispering and standing inches apart in a semi-dark corner of the Great Hall. The holiday decorations didn't help. The twinkle of the lights from the tree and the bannisters shone on Malfoy’s face making odd shadows that accentuated his pointy nose in a way that made him look less like an angry Flamingo and more like the distinguished bloke he always claimed to be.
Harry laughed again. It was the only option that didn’t include yelling, so instead of being annoyed that Draco had used him to avoid being set up, he laughed. He laughed so hard he had to hold his stomach.
Draco paced back and forth. Granger was the most boring of all his captors. She rarely ever cracked and she only ever wanted to tell Draco to fuck off or call him a coward. At least the Weasel cried and Potter fought back. She just accepted things as is and spoke to him as if he were the bothersome one.
“Nothing, did you meet the new Divination professor?” I was getting pretty good at changing the subject.
“I mean you’re my friend, so I shouldn’t want that. But I do. Maybe it's the firelight, maybe it’s the pressure of my family, or maybe…I don’t know,” he looked up and met Harry’s eyes, his gaze suddenly intense and challenging, “but I want to kiss you right now, and I don’t know if I should.”
“Hi,” Harry said, wrapping an arm around the small of Ginny’s back and bringing her body close to his.
“You’re a pain in the arse, anyone ever tell you that?” Potter asked, opening the folder. Some of the tension eased out of his shoulders as he rested back in his chair.
“I’m going to devour you now,” Draco purred into Harry’s neck. His breath warm, and his words soothing. “You lovesick, fool.”
Nikola smirked. It was wicked and Draco noted it almost made up for his pleasant eyes. There was something dangerous in there after all. “I would be interested in seeing him. The rumors are he is quite formidable, which again only speaks to your great power since you were able to thwart him and his followers.”
It was too hot for tea. Too hot to be in the forest for any reason other than necessity. Was I really supposed to believe she was just out here gathering leaves for tea? Could I trust this woman I barely knew? How was I supposed to know the trace hadn’t been leading me to her?
To be addressed directly by the Dark Lord was supposed to be an honor, he knew. Especially since his father always made sure to remind him that it was an honor. However, this did not feel like an honor, it felt like a test. One that Draco feared failing. He knew what happened to people who failed. Quickly, he decided on a course of action.
“Some things never change,” Draco mumbled to himself, covering his mouth as another yawn escaped him. He shut the magazine, and when he looked up, Potter was standing over him looking rested. They’d cleaned all the blood off his face and healed the cut. And if the stupid grin he wore was any indication, rid him of his concussion, too.
“You’re right. It’s too hot for a full quidditch kit, so I’ll just fly like this,” Harry said, smirking because he was sure Draco was as affected by Harry being shirtless as Harry had been watching Draco bend over in those shorts. As always, two could play that game.
“This is the story of eternal love, celebrated at the Summer Solstice each year,” a voice boomed over the crowd. It sounded like Hermione, but Harry couldn’t be completely sure because it echoed over the rowdy crowd of students, professors, and villagers from Hogsmeade who were all gathered around flickering bonfires that had been placed along the slopes of the highlands. “Of two souls who met, fell in love, and yet had to spend their days apart, separated by long, dark nights. That is, until the days grew longer, allowing them to touch briefly on the nights when Dawn and Dusk got closer. They were so in love, they waited all year for just a moment with one another. And today, we celebrate that love by burning fires for the same good fortune in love and life as those two eternal lovers. It is said that jumping the flames brings good fortune and if done with your love, can predict whether the match will last…”
Draco turned to Pansy. She shrugged at him seemingly uninterested. Then Draco returned his gaze to Harry. “How about we meet later to talk?”
Now with a firm grip on Draco, Potter spun them around and slammed Draco against the bathroom door. The breath got knocked out of him, but before he could complain, Potter pushed his body flush with Draco’s, leaned his head up, so they could look at one another in the eyes, and said, “I’d very much like to kiss you.”
Draco put his hands up, as if trying to stop the idea dead in its tracks. “Really, I would rather watch.”
“Goyle failed again. The Dark Lord removed an arm as punishment. Though I can’t say I am surprised. That is what happens when a brute is sent to do the job of a diplomat.”
I didn’t move. I stared at Greyjoy, debating. Her mention of more frequent visions gave me pause. How could it not after all the visions I’d had in the last week? I didn’t trust her, but she was a seer and that meant if anyone could help me understand the visions I was having, it was her. I didn’t have time to overthink what I was about to say. I needed information fast. No one else was going to die because of my inaction.
Ron nodded. “Hermione says she doesn’t care if Odette was tricked. It’s still unprofessional to gossip about coworkers to the papers. Especially about the Minister for Magic.”
“So, uh, how’s this work?” I asked just to have something to think about that wasn’t how badly I wanted him.
“Sorry, it’s just,” Luna started and then seemed to be considering her next words very carefully, “well, it seemed rather obvious to me. Whenever we all go out to bars, I see you looking at both women and men.”
“I was, too, but that’s because I didn’t think you liked me the way I liked you. You were older, more experienced, not to mention I had just broken up with your sister.”
There was a long, silent moment as Draco took a deep, long breath. He let it out in a shudder. “I’m thinking ‘should’.”
“So the trace spell still wont work. We have no way of studying the body to gauge how he died or what killed him and there is no way to know if the partially dug up hole has anything to do with the crime.” Hermione let out an exasperated laugh that made her sound like she was a mad scientist whose experiment failed…again. “That’s just, well, that’s bad, Harry. It’s pretty bad.”
“Po—Potter, I…” Malfoy said. Harry watch him struggle to swallow. His adam’s apple bobbed under the tight skin of his neck.
that Potter was attractive. He was built for a fight with wide shoulders and thick muscles. His jet black hair grew in tendrils that fell around his face accentuating that olive tone of his skin.
“Thanks for the invite, Harry,” Charlie Weasley breathed into Harry’s ear. They were standing very close together on the stoop of McGrady’s home. The cold air seemed to act as a lasso, forcing them close together. Snow had begun to fall and it was clinging to Charlie's red hair, which he had grown out to his shoulders recently.
“You know I’ve had amiable feelings toward Mrs. Granger for a while now and was curious as to her disposition in regards to our acquaintance. This was my chance to test the waters and she seemed to be receptive to my advances. Further, I do not believe that there is any validity to those rumors about them,” Pansy said as if this would be good news to him.
“I don’t even get why he—oh, for fucks sake, Potter,” Pansy stopped herself and seemed to consider her next words carefully. Her brows were pushed together and it looked like she was in a considerable amount of pain. “Do you even know what you’ve done?”
Malfoy stood up and walked closer to where Harry was still crouching. His wand shone like a spotlight on Harry. His eyebrow was raised and his smirk was devious. “You find my humming amusing, then?”
“Not if you’re going to be a twat about it, no.” Malfoy stepped in front of me and raked his eyes over my body. His gaze lingered over my groin before he settled on my face.
“Tell me why you care.” Harry stepped closer and now they were toe to toe. He felt his own breathing getting erratic and took care to slow his breaths. He watched for any sign that Draco was as distraught as him.
“It is a burden I must bear. You should consider yourself lucky that it does not afflict you so,” Draco responded callously, shifting himself away from Mr. Potter. It was one thing to be polite, but it was another thing entirely to allow himself to indulge, in whatever small way, the feelings he long harbored for Mr. Potter in spite of the reality of his situation.
Before anymore pleasantries, or subtle elbow nudges could be exchanged, the first course was brought out and Draco could tell Nikola was impressed by the sheer abundance of food that was placed in front of him. It was the first time all night that he looked at anything other than Draco.
This meant that the Manor was the center of many dealings with the new Ministry officials. And it meant that Draco, himself, had his own set of duties. Many of which, he disliked and therefore ignored, but some he enjoyed. Specifically, he enjoyed being tasked with prisoner care.
After the first sighting, Harry positioned himself back in the corner of the pitch. This strategy always worked when he played, so he saw no reason to switch it up now. Draco kept moving like a madman. It was hard to keep his eyes searching for the snitch, especially when Draco zipped past him and Harry would catch a whiff Draco—sweat mixed with something earthy like rain, though rain hadn’t fallen in over a week.
After the fight with Draco, Harry finds himself back in the Gryffindor common room and Ginny is there.
“The Ministry works you all too hard,” Charlie said. He was a ruggedly handsome man. His face blanked with freckles like constellations in the night sky. His red hair pulled back in three braids that reminded me of the kind Vikings used to wear. Everything about him screamed outdoorsman. “You guys need more breaks.”
A warm tear slid down Harry’s cheek. He wiped it off with the back of his hand, feeling embarrassed even though there was no one around to witness his pathetic display. He gathered up his things off the pitch, tucking his broom under one arm and made his way back to the castle.
Harry’s whole face turned beet red. He felt his throat dry up and all words failed him while Draco turned back to Ryder, maneuvering their bodies so Draco stood with his back flush to Harry’s front. He’d even taken one of Harry’s hands and snaked it around to rest on the front of Draco’s torso covering Harry’s hand with his own.
Harry held his breath, sprawled out on the ground. There was no stirring from the couch, so he sighed out the breath he was holding and stood up. He took one more look at the couch, and then turned to head for the stairs to his dorm, but it was too late.
She was right of course, but Seamus and Dean hadn’t set their floo system up yet. They both worked in Hogsmeade; Dean for George, Ron’s brother, at the new Weasley Wizard Wheeze’s location and Seamus at his own Quidditch shop, so they rarely had use for it with everything in walking distance.
“What?” Hermione asked and moved in closer to read the stone. “Why is he buried here? Did we know he was buried here?” She scratched her chin as she examined the stone.
“The potion Parkinson gave us. It felt like my whole body was a live wire all night, but it didn’t seem like it bothered you much.”
Lamont and Reed began casting the same spells that Ron had. Their perimeter spells came up negative, too, and their trace spells did the same thing Ron’s had. They swirled around the area, never settling, never changing colors.
Then the hand that Malfoy had resting on Harry’s hip moved around to the small of his back and Harry felt Malfoy’s slender fingers fan out. Due to the new position of Malfoy’s hand, there was barely an inch of space between their bodies.
That made Potter laugh. Actually laugh. Okay, so it was a chuckle, but still. Draco felt the muscles of his cheeks fighting off his own smile. Potter had laughed
The walk back to the Great Hall and the expectant crowd was easier now that I released some of the tension coiling in my gut. I’d been in a right mood ever since the hearing was announced. The news of the trial came two days before the Ministry fundraiser, so I had been deep in the drink and feeling restless. That night when I saw Malfoy leave during in the middle of the fifth speech about how amazing the Ministry was because they raised money for orphans or some other shit, I decided to follow him. At first because I fancied a fight, but when I caught up to him he was getting his coat and before I knew it we were pushing each other against walls and I was sinking to my knees. If Ron knew I hooked up with Malfoy, he would likely commit me to the Mental Ward at St. Mungo’s since our past had been nothing if not toxic and destructive. Not that he didn’t want to already simply for kicking the shit out the Ministry official. But add in Malfoy and he would be sure I was losing my mind. I wasn’t entirely sure if I didn’t belong in St. Mungo’s myself, but I needed someone who didn’t want anything from me except what I was willing to give and Malfoy fit that bill. Probably because he wanted the same thing—a release.
“Figured you for a coward.” Harry opted for an insult in response instead of the truth which was he was afraid Draco would stand him up and he would have been the fool who snuck out at midnight to stand in an empty field with a snitch buzzing in his pocket.
“Just, wow, what a great rendition.” Harry paused to clap slowly. He made sure to pause between each one long enough that Malfoy got that angry-bird look in his eyes. “Have you considered taking yourself on tour?”
Mr. Potter stepped back and released Draco’s forearm. He did not look offended, but there was disappointment in his tone when he spoke. “You are entirely too taciturn, Mr. Malfoy. Are not certain things meant to be enjoyed in their simplicity and others for their meaning and value?”
Harry was too shocked to care that Malfoy sounded sad, not angry. His whole body kept reacting to simple touches. He couldn’t imagine what kissing someone on this potion would feel like if a touch made him feel like this.
I didn’t wait any longer to unzip his pants and found his cock was already half hard. I rubbed my hands up his thighs and kissed the outline of his erection in his pants. I heard him moan and pulled his cock out. It was filling and I wrapped my lips around it and let myself fall into a rhythm. The world melted away, all the responsibility of the day and the shit memories, until all that mattered was Malfoy’s cock in my mouth and his hands pulling my hair and his labored breaths.
“Like heightened sensitivity to touch, or becoming easily aroused. Remember puberty and how even a strong wind could get your knickers in a twist? Well, it’s that times a thousand.” Pansy didn’t let the awkward subject stop her from getting her point across. “It has the potential to be worse if the person you’re attracted to is near you when the potion is in effect, or if you are somehow blocking or denying said attraction.” She took a moment to eye Draco.
I turned to face him again. There was a fierceness in his eyes. A determination. He wanted me as badly as I wanted him and I could see it annoyed him. I was about to ask him if he wanted to get out of here when I heard it.
The only sounds were the soft breathing of patients sleeping, and the sounds of Potter’s shoes clicking on the tile floor as they made their way down the halls. Potter walked next to him, keeping in step with him. Potter’s knuckles brushed against his and Draco held his breath. The potion had to be out of his system by now. It’d been hours. So why did Potter’s touch still make him feel like he was flying?
“A bit,” I said truthfully. It was more than that, but they didn’t need to know all my issues with the Ministry. Not until I could prove they were hiding something big again. I got enough concerned looks from Hermione and Ron.
And here they were, walking over to the corner of the room Draco and Pansy had chosen for its isolation from the merriment. Of course, Draco and Pansy’s presence was necessary at such events, even though Draco found these events a stark reminder of what he had lost and how he just what he did to lose it.
(the only Muggle movie Draco seemed to like). He squeezed Harry’s hand once before dragging him over to the collection of smaller bonfires where people lined up to jump across, wearing flower wreaths on their heads.
Draco woke that morning, well rested for the first time since his mother’s passing and suddenly he felt guilty. For it was unusual to wake so peacefully in the Manor. Even as a child he woke to anxiety pressing on his chest like an anvil. His only serenity had been his mother and the gardens. Once she died, he all but lost hope of ever feeling calm again.
In the foyer, Draco waited at his father’s side like a trained pet. He was very practiced at receiving guests by now. This had been a recurring part of growing up in the Manor. At age five, he was taught the proper posture for receiving guests: back straight, arms relaxed and hands linked in front. At age seven, he had forgotten this and after the guests left he was whipped once across the back. He never forgot after that.
Robards laughed. “Merlin you are something else. You’re on desk duty for beating up a Ministry official thanks your little magical surge theory. Isn’t that enough attention for you?”
Pulling back slightly, Mr. Potter looked Draco in the eyes. His face went stern and he stopped swaying, but left his hands wrapped around Draco. “I never received such letters as those. If I had, I would have heartily accepted.”
The crowd turned to see Draco, lemon tart halfway to his mouth. He smiled and placed the desert on the plate he held. “Of course, Luna, I’d be glad to.”
“No, I was at the Burrow after the war, just like you, and accidentally saw you two flirting,” Luna smiled dreamily, unaware of Harry’s level of discomfort at hearing he wasn’t as subtle has he always assumed.
But out here, in the dark, alone with Draco, Harry couldn’t find a damn thing to distract him, except for maybe the snitch. But he hadn’t seen it yet, and frankly, he found himself not caring. Then like an answer to a prayer, Harry heard the snitch buzz past his ear and he took off after it.
“Sorry, sorry. You know me. I get going and,...there I go again,” she stopped, looking at Ginny’s empty glass and Harry’s half empty one. “I’ll grab us all new drinks. We all know Ginny needs another one after having to listen to me ramble for the last half hour.”
Draco glided across the night sky—still as graceful as before only somehow more enticing, more entrancing. His movements were still the same, but Harry had trouble keeping his eyes from raking themselves up and down the length of Draco’s thighs. So pale. So firm. Harry felt his fingers twitching at the thought of running themselves up and down the soft inseam of his thighs.
Draco dressed in his favorite robes because they reminded him of his mother and how she had nearly hexed the tailors balls off for poking Draco with a needle during the fitting. She had always been formidable but in a secret way. Everyone underestimated her strength simply because she was demure, but then when she unleashed her wrath, there were few who could best her. He thought wearing them might channel her strength as he was going to need it to face the day.
“Hello, Harry Potter.” And without waiting for a response, she added. “And Draco Malfoy, too. What a treat.”
Draco was already dreadfully bored. This evening would be a mess of pleasantries and empty platitudes from each side about how much they respect one another while simultaneously trying to figure out how to screw one another over if the need should arise. And Draco would have to be a good little doggy and sit where he was told, speak when he was asked, and be paraded around to show off what a good job his father had done in training him.
“What’s that about Gryffindor brutes?” Ron called from the other small group which consisted of Dean and George. They were parked near the food table, all with tiny white plates full of finger foods held up to their mouths.
“I’m not doubting her capabilities as weird as that is to admit out loud. Hermione understands the potion better than most, but not better than me. If you want the potion, I come along, too.”
So on the fly, Draco decided to switch tactics. “I get it, you know, but what happened to Thomas wasn’t your fault. He saved your life, Potter, which is what partners do. You would have done exactly the same thing for him, and don’t even pretend you wouldn’t.” Draco said the words hoping it wasn’t a stupid idea to bring Dean Thomas’s death into it, but everyone knew that’s why Potter had been so difficult to work with, even if Potter himself didn’t see it.
I nodded in response and he headed toward the house, leaving me on my own. My only advantage was that no one had noticed me yet. If I was going to sneak away from this party to check out Skeeter’s lead at the cemetery, I’d have to go now. I decided to head back toward the maze and the forest. It would be easy enough to hop the hedge and follow the tree-line to the cemetery. We were a three minutes walk from it.
He fingered the vials carefully, trying to avoid clinking them together. Even though it was a one person bathroom, Draco was afraid of someone catching him rifling through the potions. They might think he was up to something. Most people thought he was planning the next big Death Eater uprising even when he used a simple
should be enjoying it. Yet, here I am, scowling at all the happy couples and people drunk off their arses, thinking how ridiculous it all is.”
Her hair was still a visible mess, but her pale complexion held a certain appeal that was not entirely lost on Draco. As did her position in the Ministry. Ms. Granger was an Unspeakable and it was said that she would one day take over the entire department. A connection like that was not entirely unfavorable; however, it paled in comparison to her companion, Mr. Potter.
With a mumble, Potter shifted and his eyes fluttered open. When he spoke, his voice was gravely from sleep. “Malfoy?”
When he stood upright again, Potter was finishing buttoning up the robe. He concentrated on each button, furrowing his brow. “Merlin this is a torture device.”
I started jogging toward the trace and Malfoy kept pace with me. He didn’t complain again. I tore my eyes away from the trace and watched him move, his body toned and steady. There was sweat on his forehead and a small line of sweat around the collar of his shirt.
“What?” Draco stammered, pulled back a little, but not removing his hands from Harry’s grip. “What do you mean? Everyone will know for sure that we’re together and we haven’t decided anything about that yet.”
I ran to him and caught him before he hit the ground. His hands wrapped around my shoulders, gripping hard. A tremor ran down my spine when he touched the skin of my neck and I felt the urge to kiss him again. He yanked his foot out of the rotted tree and we both stumbled a bit from the force. I slipped my hands around his middle tighter, pulling him close. His eyes flicked up from the forest floor to my eyes. I let myself fall into them for a moment, forgetting where we were or why. The muscles of his back were taut and I felt them under my touch as he worked to move back from me. I released him even though my whole body screamed at me to hold him closer.
“I said,” Malfoy started in a soft whisper by his ear, but then moved so he was now face to face with Harry, “that I would rather you figure out what makes a posh boy like me
It hit Malfoy square in the chest. Other than the snow on the front of his coat, there was no evidence that he has been hit. Malfoy didn’t make a sound, nor did he move to shake the snow off. Instead, he looked amused.
I rolled my eyes but didn’t argue. If he wanted to put himself in danger, who was I to stop him? I sure as hell would never have let anyone tell me to stay put and neither would he.
“Oh, right.” Draco knelt down to pick up Potter’s white shirt and slipped it over his head. It smelled like sweat and Potter’s cologne. Then he slipped himself in Potter’s jeans which were a little too big in the waist and a little short in the leg. He fastened the belt tight and knelt down, ignoring his own bulge, and cuffed the legs.
“White Rose Cemetery, but why is she trying to cast? Succubi can’t do magic the way we can. It’s part of what they give up. There’s no way a spell works for her even with the power boost of the Ley Lines.” Draco was surprised at how hoarse he sounded in the face of Potter’s excitement.
Midnight seekers games became a regular thing for Harry and Draco after that night. They met at least twice a week, sometimes more, to fly around in the crisp midnight air. Harry kept it secret from his mates, simply because it was nice to have something that was his and only his—something he didn’t have to share with the whole wizarding world.
. If his father ever caught wind of it, Draco was sure he would be whipped within an inch of his life. That had, after all, been his father’s promise when an unfortunate incident the summer between sixth and seventh year revealed that he and Blaise Zabini had been more than friends to his fathers utter disgust.
I passed by grave after grave. Some presenting as a vibrant blue, others in varying shades of blue and gray. There were a few other traces like a green one at the base of a gravestone where someone had cast a charm around some flowers they planted to keep them fresh longer. I looked carefully at the magic surrounding me. It was beautiful and haunting at the same time. It was like the magic was frozen in time, hovering in place until it dissipated or faded away. I dared to look up toward the forest and found lines of color running though the trees like ultraviolet waves. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw one of the traces, a black one in the trees, that was tethered to a spot at the back of the cemetery very close to the spot where the caretaker died. It was like a trail of smoke that led from the trees to the grave.
Once the couple were out of sight, Harry sprang to his feet. He did so without paying attention and managed to collide with Malfoy, who had done the same thing at the same time. Their heads knocked and Harry tried to right himself by grabbing hold of Malfoy’s elbows. That was a mistake. The instant he touched Malfoy, his body ached to touch more of him, to touch all of him. The potion was getting stronger, harder to ignore.
After a moment, Harry shook thoughts of Draco’s flexible limbs from his mind and mounted his broom, with much less grace, and zipped off after Draco and the snitch.
That drew his attention away from the stage. “Oh, I’d love to have seen that. What did Hermione do?”
His interest seemed to annoy Draco in the beginning and that only made Harry more curious. Once he opened his mouth, he surprised even himself with how much he wanted to know about Draco.
Being partnered with Potter had come as a shock. He’d been expecting to come out of his training and get assigned an older Auror for his probation year like the rest of his class, but instead Minister Shacklebolt insisted they work together—for the sake of post-war unity. In a twisted way, Draco found it an inspired PR tactic that he hadn’t thought the Minister capable of, and yet here he found himself, unable to escape Harry Potter, yet again.
“Thank you.” Potter licked his lips. The motion woke up Draco’s desire, not that it had been slumbering too deeply after the day he’d had. “As I was saying, I have been ignoring how I felt for a long time now. In fact, I haven’t even let myself entertain the idea of being attracted to someone since everything that happened with Dean.”
As Malfoy smirked, he launched his next snowball directly for Harry’s gut. It landed and Harry let out an oof. The snowball was rolled so tightly that it actually hurt a bit. Like getting hit in the gut with a tennis ball. The noise was more reflexive than anything. Each of them managed to get a few more hits in before they were almost standing on top of one another—panting.
Potter moved in closer and tilted his head to the side. “Oh?” He placed a soft kiss on Draco’s cheek and then moved to kiss his jaw. Draco froze under his touch. Potter kept placing soft kisses down his neck.
Kharkov threw her hands up and belatedly laughed, the water trickled out faster when her mouth opened wide. “Nonsense. I was just young enough to be boring myself, as you say, with being head of a school.”
The cemetery was a half a mile from where the Portkey dropped them, so after Harry caught his breath, he started to walk towards the sidewalk where people bustled about their day. Many carried umbrellas with them since it was scheduled to storm again in the evening.
That McGonagall and the other professors hadn’t noticed was almost as funny as the fact that Rosmerta, from the Three Broomsticks, had designated a few punch bowls as the “adult” ones and didn’t notice when she had started serving out of the ones Dean, Seamus and Blaise had spiked. Harry laughed to himself because it also seemed like everyone was much more drunk than he was, and he was decently tipsy.
The door swung in, revealing Dean who stood tall in the doorway. He was smiling, beaming actually. He couldn’t have known we were there unless they had some kind of charm on the walkway, but I didn’t sense any magic. I could smell alcohol on his breath and noticed a bit of a flush in his cheeks. He looked like he might have started drinking before the party.
“Merlin. You must really hate your life, maybe even hate yourself, if you prefer to spend your days down here bothering us.”
He threaded his fingers in Nikola’s hair and tugged slightly, overwhelmed by the growing need inside him. Nikola responded by sliding his hands up Draco’s thighs and cupping his ass. They were warm and when Nikola gripped hard—hard enough that Draco was sure to have nail marks on his perfect skin—Draco let a moan rip through him, his head falling back against the wall.
At one point, these halls felt safe. Growing up at the Dursley’s had been hell and this place was my sanctuary, until it wasn’t. I got to be myself here, well, most of myself anyway. It was always easy to hide behind ‘doing the right thing because its the right thing’ excuse since that’s what people expected drove me to fight Voldemort over and over. In the end, it didn’t matter what drove me to do it. All anyone cared was that I did it.
Harry, eager to have his lips on Draco’s so he could know if this crush was ill-fated, offered another interpretation. “Say it happens like that, but it’s
headed straight for Harry. The moments between when the curse was fired and it hitting Dean had felt like they were happening through molasses. Harry could have dodged the curse, put up a shield spell, something, but he let the curse come for him. He was tired of all the fighting, and thought it might not be so bad to die.
Standing, she moved closer to the front of the painting as if sensing his pain. Maybe she could. She stopped to pick a daisy that grew at the bottom corner. Twirling it between her thumb and index finger, she said, “You look quite nice today. Something special planned?”
“Yes, ‘Arry, McGonagall's orders, yeh see. O’herwise, I ‘spect Snape would’ave both o’ yeh expelled fer the simple fac’ that he hadn’ the slightes’ clue teh what ye were up teh. He on’y calmed when she agreed teh a detention in the fores’. He was pushin’ fer it, now I think about it.”
I coughed to get his attention. He looked up and his eyes darted to the front door of the shop and then back to me. “Hi, Malfoy.”
Ron looked back and forth between me and Robards. “I didn’t know about the other incident, but I trust Harry. If he says something is going on, then there is something going on.”
It was too quiet, too peaceful, after what happened here yesterday. I tried to ignore the memory of the dead caretaker’s screams. The ground was still wet, but the sun was bright in the sky, warming my back as I stood on the spot where he died.
“Yeah, in the spirit of honesty, I’d sort of grown fond of all your dithering about proper filing and the fact that you put a coaster or napkin under my mugs when you think I’m not looking. Plus, it’s kind of nice having someone at my back. I’d forgotten what that felt like.”
Mr. Potter leaned his head forward and pressed his forehead to Draco’s as he spoke. If Draco thought his heart hammed before, it was nothing compared to this moment. Nothing compared to how he felt when Mr. Potter let his words fall between them pregnant with meaning. “You flatter me.”
—The issue is that he and I cannot work, Pansy. Would never. We are not compatible. He is too proud to condescend himself to my station and accept such an undesirable match as I. My family ties alone should be reason enough to avoid me, but add on the fact that he could not even bring himself to accept my invitation for dinner and ask yourself this question: How could we ever get passed those issues which I have laid before you?”
“I—well, I was invited, Potter,” Draco said, still attempting to be casual and polite, but feeling his mouth get dry and his palms get sweaty. He stumbled with a particularly jolting sway of the ship and, in an effort to stay upright, he gripped the front of the sink. Their hands nearly touched.
like he wanted to, Harry pulled the practice snitch out of his pocket. It had been humming against his thigh while they spoke, but now, exposed to the night air, it was thrumming with energy, itching to zip into the sky and flit along until one of them caught it.
“I see,” Harry replied. It was hard to keep his tone light and unaffected, really hard. But he didn’t want to let on anything until he was sure Draco wasn’t messing with him.
Draco rolled his eyes, but complied, tugging his shirt over his head, revealing the pale, taut muscles of his chest and torso, and tossed the shirt at Harry’s face. “You’re a menace.”
The back room of the shop looked much the same as the front of the shop. All wooden fixtures. Candles in sconces. Book shelves that went to the ceiling lined one wall. A work table lined another. There were vials and potions brewing in cauldrons. Parchment was spread across every free space of the room.
I looked around the shop. We seemed to be alone, but that was not a guarantee in the wizarding world. I knew all too well how easy it was to conceal yourself and eavesdrop. I did my fair share of listening in growing up, and up until I got stuck on desk duty, I got paid to do it. There were at least five legal concealment spells and about a dozen illegal ones. That’s not to say any spells or potions the Unspeakables used and never had to tell the DMLE about since they work outside of the laws.
There was a noise behind me. I had my wand in my thigh holster, but I rarely used it anymore. Most of the defensive spells I learned fighting Voldemort, I could do wandless now. Some of them, I could manage wandless and wordless.
“I see someone who looks like they work here.” Malfoy pointed to a man in a green jumpsuit who was pulling up some weeds near one of the newer graves. “We should ask him if he’s seen anything odd. Narrow down a location where the Succubus might be hiding out while she completes activating the Ley Lines. She’d stay close by.”
“Did you catch the bit about people jumping in pairs to see if they are well-matched?” Harry asked, his breath hitching in his throat as he forced himself to say the last bit, “Romantically speaking, I mean?”
I couldn’t pretend that it all was for the best, that everything had all happened was worth it so we could save everyone. Not the way Ron and Hermione did, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. I told myself over and over that people were safe because of me and that mattered more than my feelings. That if I had to suffer so they could live, that was just fine by me. But Ron and Hermione hadn’t been lied to their whole entire lives. It was different for them after. They had parents who took care of them and identities that expanded beyond The Boy Who Lived. They could move on after the war. All I‘d been to them, to the whole of the wizarding world, was a chess piece. And now that I was living my life the way I wanted to, making choices I thought were best…
“The whole of the wizarding world would not stand a chance,” Draco commented, more to himself than to Mr. Potter. If Pansy gained the favor of Mrs. Granger it would mean the end to her sufferings. Mrs. Granger’s influence in society would mean the end of the sideways glances and the end of gossip. And the beginning of so many things. With Pansy’s cleverness and Mr. Granger’s status, Draco knew they could accomplish anything.
“I love you,” Harry whispered when Draco pulled back from the kiss long enough to start sucking at the spot under Harry’s ear that drove him mad. “I love you.”
Something in the back of Harry’s mind told him to send a Patronus to his Auror partner, but he didn’t have time to wait for backup; the longer he waited, the more likely it was that the woman was dying. Harry wasn’t going to let that happen, not when he was here and able to fight.
“Sorry about that, Harry,” Neville said as he entered the office again, however, this time covered in dirt and wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.
Draco was saved from further explanation when the returning form flew in with an adjoining letter. Pansy grabbed them out of the air and unfolded the form. She placed it on the table nearest Potter and motioned for him to sign it. Potter did so without hesitation.
I was in the forest looking at a man hunched over in front of the giant rock. There was black ooze everywhere. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I touched them. It felt so real. But I’d just been in my living room, hadn’t I?
“Earth to Potter?” Malfoy snapped. “Can we do this before the potion wears off? I’d rather not become lunch for a hungry Succubus.”
Harry couldn’t see any sign of the thing near the road, so it had to be in this alleyway. He’d followed it, not more than a few feet behind, as it led a petite woman out of the club, so they couldn’t have gotten too far. Someone’s life was in danger, and Harry had to help.
On the ground, Harry was met by Draco, grinning and holding the snitch between his index finger and thumb.
“Oh, there are two of you,” she cooed when she saw Malfoy behind him, her flesh, or what counted as flesh, was charred black from the burning fire that she managed to put out somehow. “What a treat.”
Harry felt a lump forming in his throat. Of all the things he expected Draco to ask him, he was unprepared for that. He felt his face get warm, and knew he must look like someone who had the rug pulled from under them.
Her face went from mischief to innocence in the blink of an eye. “I don’t know what you mean, darling.” She twirled a strand of her hair in between her index and middle finger.
me?” He scoffed, making his way over to Potter. The idea wasn’t entirely without it’s charms. He could set Potter free, Potter would kill him, or at least beat him within an inch of life and then kill his father and the Dark Lord and Draco would be free to be with his mother again.
“We’ll be your human subjects. We can test it in the field.” Potter’s sounded frantic again. Draco hadn’t bothered to wonder why Potter was so hellbent on finding the map before because he was more focused on how unorganised his partner was and how badly that reflected on Draco. But now, under the aggressive bright lights in the lab, Draco saw it; Potter was upset, and like any wizard with a savior complex, he clearly blamed himself for the most recent woman’s death. Silly that Draco hadn’t noticed it before. It was classic Potter.
“I think we have Potions together,” Draco answered. He eyed Luna seriously, then turned his attention back on Ryder.
Potter snatched up the map. “I don’t have time to sit around and theorise just now, but I agree, there’s no way normal magic works, but Ley Lines are different, ancient. Maybe it found a way to tap into them. I don’t know, but I do know it will definitely kill again tonight. There aren’t any more Ley Lines that need activating before… what? Wh—why are you looking at me like that?”
I’d forgotten about the magical trace. I spun around trying to find the black smoke again. I saw it in the distance on the other side of the clearing. It was barely visible. Either the potion was fading or the trace was nearly gone. “It’s disappearing.”
"Speak for yourself." A smile spread across Draco's face. Potter laughed again and eyed him seriously, which made Draco’s heart pound. “Okay, fine. Yes. I am stubborn and prideful, too, there, happy?”
Malfoy’s face lit up. He was smiling and it was so genuine, so completely different from how I’ve seen him, that it made my breath catch in my throat. I wanted to kiss him in that moment. I felt myself moving toward him and stopped myself. Kissing him because I liked the way he smiled after seeing his potion work was definitely not casual hook-up territory. If he had been confused about things with us before, what would my kissing him out in the open mean to him?
“Because it was my fault. I planned to sneak away from the party.” Hermione geared up to say something, but before she could I said, “I know, I know— Anyway, I let myself get distracted.”
It was even evident in their day time dynamic, which up until the night, had remained the same as it always was—to everyone, they were still enemies. Now, their interactions during the day were punctuated with smirks, knowing head nods, and looks that communicated unspoken understandings.
Ron smiled at me. It was his ‘you’re not going to like this’ smile. “Yes, indeed. Hence why, when you were having
Harry choked on whatever it was he had intended to say to Hagrid. It was lost now anyway. His throat was dry again. He was transfixed. He stood motionless under the scrutiny of Malfoy’s stare.
Draco turned and saw the person who the voice belonged to was, in fact, not a student but Amelia Kharkov, a past headmaster of Durmstrang and a ghost. She had been young to be head of a school, possibly in her late forties, when she died nearly a hundred years ago. Her hair matched Draco’s in length, dropping to her shoulders. Though she wore hers tied back with braids, something he thought Luna would approve of. She had a long nose that ended in a dramatic point. On someone else it would seem out of place, but somehow on her, it fit. She wore robes with no embroidery, no embellishment. If one weren’t paying attention, she would simply blend into the background.
“I lost people in the war, too,” Malfoy snapped. His chest was rising and falling with a stained effort like he was working to not lunge at me and take me down in a tornado of punches.
“Which is not very.” Harry narrowed his eyes at Draco and shoved him with his shoulder one more time.
Harry sighed. The potion made him feel like he was sinking and flying all at once, and it was distracting. He thought about it a moment and considered telling Malfoy he’d call for backup
“Did she?” Draco asked, raising a hand to his chin. Then he pulled his hand back a little and examined his nails. He seemed amused. “And what did she have to say?”
“You nervous?” Neville asked as he took the free seat next to me, angling it so we could face each other. He looked better than I did. His suit was a deep navy and it fit him well, hugging all the parts of him that should be hugged like his biceps and his broad shoulders. His shirt was a pale blue with little plant patterns in it. He forwent the tie and instead, unbuttoned the top two buttons. Making him look relaxed.
He pointed a finger at the thing, the Succubus that had been killing people all over London. “I can feel love just fine, lady.” Suddenly, he felt drunk. It was hard to stand without wobbling from one foot to the other. Part of him remembered the wand in his hand, and thought he should do something with it, but he couldn’t think what. The rain fell harder now, but he hardly registered it.
Breathless, Draco pulled back and Harry found himself leaning forward, trying to recapture his lips. “Why did you stop?” he asked, surprised by the husky tone of his voice. “I didn’t want to stop.”
The Succubus laughed. It was comforting, and he wanted to listen to only that noise for the rest of his life. “Mmm, you mortals are so blind to your own Life Energy, your own desires. You would rather be alone than admit you want to be loved?”
Harry swallowed hard. “Umm, thanks,” and then nodded to Ned as he went back to his weeding. Malfoy was pretty far ahead, so Harry jogged to catch up. Ned’s words spinning around in his head like a merry-go-round only added to the already dizzying revelations he was having courtesy of one demon-witch and one Pansy Parkinson.
.” He pulled his wand out, hoping he had enough in him to throw an Incendio before the Succubus killed her final victim. He wasn’t feeling especially lucky, so he was about to tell Malfoy that maybe he should go in first when Malfoy sighed again, closed his eyes and rolled his neck.
Instead of responding, Harry moved forward, grabbed Pansy by the arm and dragged her down the nearest hallway and shoved her into the small supply closet. After he shut the door and cast a muffliato, Harry asked, “What in Merlin’s beard is your problem? That will be in the paper tomorrow whether it’s true or not.”
Skeeter looked around the sitting room and nodded. “Oh, that was your lovely house elf’s doing. He said you liked it unnaturally bright.”
“Go out with me.” Harry smiled. It was a gamble, but if the way Draco was looking at him were any indication, Harry was sure the answer would be yes.
“Why didn’t you get back with her?” Draco asked. He shifted his head, so he could look at Harry. “If you don’t mind me asking.”
“I understand, and you know how she is...Hermione needs to process. I’m sure when she stops thinking about how it isn’t the plan she had in mind, she will realize that working with George is what’s best for you, and for him.”
Harry closed the door shut and leaned back against it as if it wouldn’t stay shut without the weight of his body. He felt like he had half the wizarding world chasing after him, and he probably did.
“I can still hear that scream,” Hermione said. She had her wand tucked behind her ear as she crouched down looking at the spot where the body had been. She picked up a clump of dirt and let it sift through her fingers and fall back to the ground.
Potter nodded. “Makes sense. Blocking the attraction to the thing with something else. Okay, good, but what if you’re not attracted to anyone?”
“I do love you, Harry,” Draco whispered. He leaned forward so their foreheads were pressed together.
“Maybe…” Harry’s voice a trembling whisper, “…we should try a third time, just to be really, extra sure?”
I sighed. “Course he did.” I made my way across the room, grabbing the decanter of whiskey on my way to the couch and sprawled out across it. I didn’t drink the whiskey, but I knew I was going to need it at some point during this conversation. “Well, get after it then.”
She nodded. There was a hint of anxiety there that I wouldn’t have usually noticed. I assumed Hermione was never affected by this stuff. She sure as hell never let on that she was—or at least, I never noticed if she had. I could probably thank the alcohol for that one.
Draco choked as he heard those words. No one had ever asked to see Potter before, nor called him formidable. Most people wouldn’t dare offend the Dark Lord in such a way. Asking to see Potter was like asking for proof that the Dark Lord actually had him in captivity. And to question the Dark Lord was to die. Yet, here Nikola was, sipping his drink smugly awaiting a response.
“Well, that does happen when you live with someone and spend all of your free time with them. You start to learn everything about them,” Ginny said matter-of-factly and then sat upright again. She turned to face Harry and then gave him a sideways smile before she cupped his face in her gloved hands.
Mordeau’s was tucked back in an alleyway next to Seamus’s quidditch shop, out of sight from the Main Street of Hogsmeade. A rusted iron sign in the shape of a cauldron creaked in the slight breeze. I’d been inside only once before—when I went looking for Malfoy after the ministry function, but he hadn’t been in and it was probably for the best. I remember waking up that morning with a terrible hangover and my first thought was ‘Malfoy.’ I’d rushed to the shop before I even really thought about why. I hesitated at the door now, unsure how to ask him for the potion without telling him why I needed it.
Hermione had the grace to look ashamed. “Right. Sorry. I just need this to go well. You know I am up for that promotion as Advisor for the Minister for Magic. I’d be the youngest to do it.”
“Uh,” Draco said, scanning the group. Right off, he decided he would not switch with Potter. Wearing his clothes would be torture. The smell of Potter’s cologne would haunt his dreams for weeks if he was forced to smell it on his own skin all night.
Likely, blowing out one of the candles would disconnect the Ley Line, but if the breeze and damp air wasn’t doing it, the candles were  likely enchanted somehow, so getting them to blow out wouldn’t be as simple as blowing out the candles on a birthday cake. Plus, there could be any number of things that could go wrong. If the Ley Lines power was tied to the candles, and the bond was strengthened by the sacrifices of the victims, then blowing out the candles could mean messing with the Ley Lines intrinsic power, and Harry didn’t know how that would affect magic on the whole. And thanks to the Succubus stealing some of his Life Energy, he wasn’t sure he could cast something without it backfiring, or fizzling out completely.
Stag night: there’s drinking (surprise, surprise), there’s karaoke (Dean and Seamus put on a show), and then there is a little something between Harry and Draco (more emotions...:D).
With their height difference, Draco was left staring at Potter’s forehead, and effectively, his scar. Thanks to their new proximity, Draco could almost feel each of Potter’s ragged, drunk breaths against his own chest.
The Succubus froze. Her features sharpened, and if her skin wasn’t already a pale grey, she would have gone white. “You know nothing.”
“Everything is so upside down, Gin,” Harry admonished. He knew it wasn’t supposed to be this way. He wasn’t supposed to love someone who had been so terrible to him growing up. He should love someone who had been kind to him, even when it wasn’t convenient. He should love someone who hadn’t been a coward, someone who hadn’t let circumstance affect them so wholly.
After the battle, I think I got bored, everything moved too slow. Maybe that’s part of why I imploded my career—just so I had something exciting to do. Something that was as blood-pumping as dueling with Voldemort. Something that made me feel like I was on the edge of destruction. Maybe I really was trying to ruin my own reputation like Ron said. Go figure.
“Wow, Nev, this place is amazing,” Harry said when the door closed behind him, sealing him inside whether he liked it or not.
“Like any other spell. I wave this little thing called a wand. You have heard of one of those, haven't you? And then I say some magic words.” Malfoy waggled his eye brows mockingly and then held his wand up between us. “Ready, Potter?”
Draco knitted his brow and peered over Harry’s shoulder to see if anyone else would be coming through with him, but the flames turned bright orange again. “Uh, hi?”
“Can't I?” Potter reached out and grabbed Draco's robes, fisting the fabric to pull him closer. “Is it terribly forward if I said I wanted you to kiss me?”
Draco’s face was one of pure shock when Harry landed on the pitch. His eyes were wide and his mouth agape. Before Harry could even gloat, Draco was demanding a rematch, claiming that Harry cheated somehow and that he would surely have won if Harry played fair.
It was easy. Like their bodies and lips were made to fit together in this way. Harry wrapped around Draco and Draco sucking at his bottom lip. In a haze, Harry lifted Draco up and sat him down on the edge of the desk, their lips never parting.
I took a sip of the tea and wished it was whiskey. “I’m sure plenty of students fainted when they saw you in that suit, Mr. Longbottom.” I was flirting and it felt damned good to do it.
“I had a front row seat, and it was tragic, Draco, that you pushed off a perfectly good-looking bloke for no reason.”
Hermione fire-called, her hair half done, to say I needed to look presentable since the papers would be there, so I tried to flatten out my hair a bit, but it was more stubborn than usual, so I gave up and hoped it was good enough.
He was still recovering the Life Energy the Succubus siphoned off him. It had taken him three tries to get his Floo working, and his wand only sparked whenever he tried casting. He hadn’t felt so useless since he was living with the Dursleys.
“Black traces leading to the forest.” I started to follow the black tether to the back gate of the cemetery. It was a stone wall that ran the length of the forest. It was up to my waist. Easy to hop, so I did.
“I saw my mother,” I said. “Why would I see her when these visions have nothing to do with her? She’s dead.”
“And I was telling Harry that there are other whiskies in the sea.” Draco sipped the whisky and winked at Harry.
“Gin,” Harry started, but the look on Ginny’s face was so sincere and so understanding, that Harry couldn’t help but smile at the amazing, brave woman she had grown into over the last two years. And he had missed it. He missed it because he had to set off and hunt down Horcrux after Horcrux, and then when that was over, Auror training had taken over most of his life. It was only the last six months that Harry had even been able to socialize properly.
“Tomorrow,” Luna answered and then turned her attention once again to the pigeon who was still perched on the windowsill.
“But we love each other, right?” Harry asked, his voice cracking as he fought back tears. He swallowed once and added, “I know things are complicated. I’m not pretending they aren’t. You always say that I’m not looking at the big picture, but I am. It’s you. You’re the big picture for me.”
Draco laughed, snatched the bottle out of Harry’s hand, and said, “Merlin, you do not want to know.” He took a sip and then leaned back against the tree trunk. He handed the bottle back to Harry. “Okay, fine, fine. You pressured me into it, Potter. Sheesh. Relentless.”
We headed through the floo to the Ministry lobby. The portkey station was on the ground floor past the main atrium. Hermione headed toward them, ignoring the front desk witch who waved at us. That was odd. Hermione usually said hello to her.
“This is as good a spot as any,” Draco said when he found a tree in view of the lake. He plopped down to the ground, yanking Harry down with him.
The Potions lab at the Ministry was, similarly to Hogwarts, in the basement, though that’s where the similarities stopped. Where Hogwarts was all gothic—high ceilings, dim lighting, and old dusty books—the Ministry’s potions lab was clinical with white walls, hard metal counters, and more conventional equipment that didn’t look like it had been used in the Middle Ages.
“Ha, course not.” Harry licked his lips and worked hard to keep his eyes forward. He didn’t understand why he was so nervous. He and Draco had hung out alone plenty of times since the beginning of the year. But there was something about the way Draco walked a little too close. Something about the pulse of excitement that hit him every time they stumbled closer, their knuckles brushing. It made Harry feel awake, more than he’d been all year.
” Harry spoke calmly, no wand flourish in sight.  The Gryffindor was lifted from the floor, his wand clattering down onto the stone.
Harry decided to take a different approach, quickly he grabbed Malfoy by the wrists and used what little momentum he could gather to push him down onto the bed. After a small tussle and a very indignant shout on Malfoy’s part, Harry had Malfoy’s wrists pinned at his sides while he was sat on the edge of the bed with Harry standing, or rather bent at the waist in front of him, staring him dead on in the eyes.
“Mate, I know you love him and all but Kingsley said Dolohov’s throat was nearly crushed! You still haven’t told us what happened?”
.” Harry spoke quietly, though the effect it produced was anything from quiet.  The wall behind Walburga’s portrait shattered, plaster and wallpaper flew every which direction and the frame around the nasty woman’s portrait fell to pieces as well, the canvas fluttered down to the floor and landed in a heap at Harry’s feet.
“This had better not become a Christmas tradition.” Hermione huffed, only sending Ron and Harry into further laughter.
A few weeks thereafter saw a frantic Pansy rushing into the common room shouting for Harry to come quickly.  Without hesitation Harry launched himself from his seat and hurried after Pansy, his wand drawn and ready. Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Draco, and Blaise were not far behind him as the lot of them had taken to spending most of their free time together.
“Don’t move.” A familiar voice spoke firmly from somewhere above him.  Harry willed his eyes to open only to be frozen by the sight above him.  He was still laid out on the floor but Draco was crouched over him, only this Draco was different.  Lines of silver cracked across his skin, almost vein-like.  They shimmered and rippled and Harry thought it was the most beautiful sight he’d ever seen.  Harry realized he was looking at Draco’s magic, with each ripple it would shimmer and shift looking brighter and brighter.  Harry watched as the magic snaked around Draco’s arm that was held out over top of him, but Draco’s hand wasn’t pointing at him, but rather past him. Harry followed the length of Draco’s arm with his eyes, he saw Draco's magic swirled from his fingers reaching out, dangling Harry’s attacker off the floor by his neck.
I don’t know why but I knew I had to reach the man and soon. He was running out of time. I looked at the ground and with a deep breath, I stepped outside of my patch of green. My foot hit the ground and I watched green spiderweb out from under my foot, reviving the ground. I took another step and the same thing happened.
Lost in the thought, he found his feet had carried him to a back corner of the gardens which lay under the cover of large trees. The shade was comforting in the oppressive heat of a summer that lingered well into fall. The unwelcome sweat on the nape of his neck slide downward as he approached the small white garden table where he often found his mother reading in the late afternoon. It looked very empty now.
“Potter, what are you…” Draco started and tried to pull his hand away from Potter, but he felt Potter tighten his grip slightly.
“But one evening, one summer evening, We decided to take too much. Together we opened a door. It was empty, so empty.” The voice sang. The melody was eerie and ancient. It sounded like a warning.
Draco glanced around some more, ignoring the few students who were shouting about the ghost who just walked off the deck. There was a table that someone had transfigured where the booze sat. It was a menagerie of half filled bottles, likely stolen and snuck into school from their parents homes.
“I know things, Potter,” Draco drawled and then punctuated it with a wink. He circled Harry, eyeing him up and down, then continued, “Plus it is getting too hot to play in a full quidditch kit, don’t you think? Last week we were both positively drenched by the end of it.”
