“Do birds even have saliva?” With a sigh, Harry summoned some seeds that he hoped wouldn’t accidentally poison Lucius’ favorite pets or something. After all, who knew what peacocks ate? “Here,” he said, tossing the seeds down at a safe distance away from Draco.
“Shut up!”
“It’s just a not-nice way of saying ‘stuff’,” Harry rushed the explanation before patting her back. “Papa’s sorry he said it.”
Colin nodded and sat up straight. People around them were taking photos that would sell to The Prophet for thousands, after all, and Colin knew what made a good photo. “Yes. You may finish proposing.”
When they were all sitting at Harry’s kitchen table Hermione started again.
“The kind with a happy ending,” Draco said, drunkenly making this up as he went along. “Pour us two more shots, sweetheart.” He could always be drunker.
“You’re about to be much fuller,” Draco promised with a purr in the back of his throat. “Would you like that?”
“I know, mother. Believe me, I can’t forget that night.”
Harry was on cloud nine.
After introductions and another explanation of the concept of the show by Draco and Harry, the reunion show was officially on.
“I’m sure.”

Ruth with her blonde hair and the pastel pink bedroom behind her, shrugged. “I guess it never occurred to us. We both really like to talk over text.”
“It’s complicated,” Draco started and took a long drink. He sighed. “Really it’s rather simple, but… you know what I mean.”
“I was walking home and I saw a poster hanging up for the London Zoo’s new tiger habitat or whatever. That’s what really got me thinking, and then everything fell into place.” He paused to put another spoonful of vanilla delight into his mouth. “The crib will be a light wood, with green leaf detailing along the sides, and a mobile of different animals.”
“I still like that,” Remus pointed out. “But you don’t carve phalluses into everything you touch now, which is something I appreciate highly.” Even the forever-young Sirius Black had matured. He was a Lupin now, anyway.
Their next booked hotel room had two beds, so they used one to lay out charts and schematics.
Lucius Malfoy loved his son, he really did, but Draco would be the death of him. He was so willful, so proud, and so much like him that it scared him.
Hermione immediately perked up. It hardly made up for Harry’s actions, but she heard what he was saying. That, and he still sounded like the Harry she knew and loved. He was beside her in the fight in the long run.
“Halfway there, my painslut. Keep those legs open,” Draco instructed with a glint in his eyes.
Hoping he could conjure one that didn’t taste terrible, Harry opened the door and found… Well, nothing. “Hello?” he asked the empty room. Maybe Grace had gone into the bathroom.
Draco noticed the poor girl practically salivating at the thought. “We’ll eat afterwards.”
“Apologize.”
“Father,” Draco called to him, looking out the window to their driveway. “The limo’s here, you can stop harassing Harry now.”
Sirius rolled up his shirt sleeve to reveal a tattoo of a blood rune in the middle of a target on his left forearm. “Do you know where I got this, Alex?”
They walked in silence, Harry’s eyes flicking over every single piece of shrubbery. This wasn’t the sort of work he imagined himself doing when he signed up to be an Auror, but he’d take his victories in stride.
“And what do you want me to talk with you about?” he huffed and finally withdrew his hands. “I already told you that I feel like shit about her mum. I also already told you that I’ll get over it. I have to.”
“Are they…?” Remus asked gently.
“I want you,” Harry said with his last modicum of calm. “To leave. I want all of you to leave. Hello, no kidnapping, get out of our house.” The room of Aurors, having heard this entire fight and not knowing what to say or do, looked to Ron.
“Who can blame them? You look hot today.”
He’d gotten to know a happier Remus, one with a husband, a job he loved, and a family. Remus told hilarious jokes, was ever-so-subtly mischievous, and always knew what to say to comfort Harry. How could Harry possibly know what to say back to him?
“Or dragons.”
Eric would change it to a deep sea blue halfway through that year and Aiden would drown in it.
“Oh, wow,” said Harry, not expecting such a potent intensity. He stepped inside after Draco and immediately felt his skin getting moist.
“Was good enough to beat you in a duel every time we tried,” Harry recalled airily while Draco pretended he didn’t hear. In the background the quill scratched away at Harry’s patient for and he tried to sneak a peek at what it was writing.
“What? I always do.” The last thing Draco wanted was to pick a fight, so he moved that wandering hand of his up around Harry’s shoulder. “Talk to me.” To encourage Harry, Draco gave him a little kiss on the shoulder. This was their child.
He had checked in with Luna, Neville, Dean, and wished Ginny a happy birthday on her Facebook timeline before Hermione finally logged on and he could unload some of his wild tales of Draco Malfoy-isms onto her.
That got a wicked laugh out of Draco. “Touché. Still.” He handed Harry another shirt in his size and Harry groaned.
The camera was shaking the whole time and the audio on the spanks was off.
It was nice, though. It was nice waking up to her hand down Pansy’s panties and her breath on Pansy’s neck without a word about some inane dream or flight of fancy. Maggie was down-to-earth like that, and Pansy wondered if she even dreamed at all.
The word ‘artist’ struck something in Marcus. He shifted in his chair and swallowed down a lump of hatred.
Somehow, Harry doubted that. The man claimed to have loved his mother, but the whole thing smacked of obsession. If Severus had really loved Lily, then how could he have treated her son with such disdain? It had been an uphill battle with him every step of the way from grades to war, and the excuse that Harry ‘looked like his father’ was a weak one.
“Yes, yes, I’ll admit Lorraine has terrible taste, but she messaged the
“And then this prick has the nerve to tell me he was ‘glad my father chose him’ like this was a damned arranged marriage as he slurps his fucking catsup.” Draco shuddered. That image would haunt him more than anything Voldemort had ever done to him.
The persnickety young Jonathan was already dialing them up.
The cab driver was normally a kind, calm man. He had two grandchildren from his only daughter whom he loved very dearly. He had their drawings hung up on the fridge and read bedtime stories to them. In a moment of sheer and unexpected rage, he leaned on the horn to make such an obnoxious noise that Grace whirled around on her rock perch.
“After my father’s. Ugh.”
“Here is your table, sirs.”
“I’m not going to sue,” Grace said slowly, breaking her silence. She had no idea what the family she was prepared to give her unwanted offspring in had to do with her mother’s death. “But, yes. I think I’ll go to the hospital.”
“Do you want to hear the story?” Draco questioned of Harry and he arched a brow even though Harry was facing away.
“We’re conducting interviews this afternoon,” Draco sighed. “We’re meeting with all the different candidates today for about ten minutes so we can rule some of them out based on some simple questions and seeing if they’re in this for the fame or if they’re unprepared for adoption or this process.”
“You look like shit.”
“That aside,” Remus continued as the corners of his mouth were tugged up into a smile. “I don’t think there should be a ‘we’ in talking about Draco and Harry’s child. We’ll support them in whatever they do.”
“Then I’ll just deck all of those men.”
Harry smiled because Draco had called him by his first name, and it sounded just like he remembered. So much had changed about Draco and yet so much remained the same. “And I swear it as well,” he nodded. With nothing left to do he finished off his drink through the straw. It was fruity and had a tang of citrus.
Colin snickered. “Sounds adventurous.”
“Of course, don’t just take my word for it,” she went on, ego having swelled. “We have a council of parents that are always clued in on their individual child’s progress along with the progress of the class. We are a very tightly-knit community with ten children of each age.”
“Oho, Mr. Potter,” Mr. Georges observed with a merry little chuckle and for a moment Harry was scared that he’d been given away. Was this man a wizard? Did he
Harry put a curve in his back and moved his groin up into Draco’s hand. “Yes, yes, you bastard. You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.” And how long he’d denied wanting it, too.
Harry, left with nothing to do but enjoy the stimulation, pressed a barrage of sloppy kisses to the inlet of Draco’s shoulder. He bit down and sucked a hickey onto his skin, moaning softly around the chosen patch of flesh while Draco’s finger eased in and out of him.
“So you’re suggesting that someone here wanted to sabotage me so badly they put a spell on my room to tell them what literature I was bringing in and out? I was only looking at Harry’s ad once in the office, just the once…” If that had been his mistake, if that was why the two of them were suffering now, Draco didn’t think he could forgive himself for his own stupidity. He should have known better, should have seen this place for what it was, a dangerous den of derailers who hated him for his position and prowess.
Draco’s gaze warmed Harry’s whole chest up again, tingles spreading out from the center to hear Draco say that oh-so-forbidden and heart-stopping five-letter word. His posh accent made it sound so unbelievably hot. “You daydreamed of me?” was all Harry could manage, face red but turned upwards smiling so hard it hurt.
Still, they were high enough to make him reach for a quill and parchment, shaking his head at himself all the while. Was he really doing this? Was he really putting himself out there to be hurt like this on his own free will? Could there be anything more foolish, any pursuit more doomed to fail than his?
“Not everyone trusts the police—and for good reason. Plus, they probably would have been sexist about the whole thing in thinking that women can’t be predators or making light of the situation.”
“’They’? I think The Prophet called me a ‘Raging Disruption’ yesterday.”
“I am in bed.”
Harry lowered his wand and the final armchair of the room was put in place. Empty shelves lined the walls and in the far corner Draco and Harry had set up a reading nook that looked as comfortable as it was homey.
In his dressing room Draco paused in his trying on of clothes, hands coming to rest over his heart. “Spiffing, eh?” Draco grinned. “Well, I can hardly wait to see it.” He finished buttoning his jacket. “Be sure to put on the shoes and socks, too, and then I’ll show you what I’ve picked out.”
Draco snorted but the corners of his lips turned up anyway. “Well, you can be the president of the fanclub since nobody else is stepping forward any time soon. Have fun holding meetings of one.”
“I like it,” Harry declared, looking around the room at their work completely oblivious to Draco’s amazement. “Now, if you really want some place cozy it needs carpeting. Should we do that next?”
Harry took his head off of Sirius’ shoulder so he could give the older man a playful shove. “You are a hippie. I never thought I’d say it, but Lucius was right.”
Toiletries went in the small attached bathroom and shower, small but better than showering somewhere a student could run into him. If he wanted baths they’d have to be after-hours when the students were supposed to be asleep, but he also knew the mischief Hogwarts students got up to at night having been one himself.
The need for subservience overwhelmed his shame and guilt, though. Harry was in charge of keeping citizens safe at age twenty, and a world safe at age eleven. He’d led an army at seventeen, and people had died. People he loved.
“I really wasn’t concerned with his ear piercings, Draco.”
Draco tossed his winter coat at the magic coat rack that reached over to catch it and left his briefcase on the bench in the entrance hall. He’d insisted on putting one there even if Harry thought it was useless. It created order, for Merlin’s sake!
“Agreed.” Draco didn’t have much experience comforting people over failed romances, and he hated that he was definitely going to have to do it the next day.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Really? This is your last one?”
When the blood elf fell from his bird to face-plant hard against the violet rocks the battle was being held on, Harry recognized him from just a day ago.
“Hair-tie and Draco Mally-Pooter,” one kid with a particularly painful-looking dental device in his mouth. Harry would have to ask Hermione if it was even legal to force a child with baby teeth to wear that nonsense.
“Narcissa,” Remus said carefully. He knew what this was about; he just didn’t know when or where it had happened. “Why don’t you take a seat?”
Draco smirked. “I better put my phone away, then, because I’m actually Emmett. I’ve been messing with Alvaro this entire time,” he said with mock-solemnity.
“That can’t look good on her white cloak,” Maggie replied.
Lorraine scrunched her nose up. “I’ve heard his music enough to know his voice. Yeah, I’m pretty sure it’s him. The combination of the things he says about his career, the way he speaks like he does in interviews with the press, his genuine kindness and tolerance, his money, and his voice all make me think it’s him.”
Telling the truth was a terrifying thing.
“He was the one who put an ad out looking for someone with exactly my kind of desires,” Draco let them in on. “I was one of many who responded to him, but he only ever replied to me.”
The rush of footsteps could be heard within before the door swung open. “Oh my god! Come in, come in,” Ruth greeted them.
“I always saw Granger as a Domme,” Blaise sighed wistfully.
“Ice cream,” Draco decided. “We’re eating ice cream now.”
He sat up; the mane of golden hair that usually was gelled and combed to perfection was frizzed out and tangled. It almost made Narcissa laugh. “It’s just one,” he sighed before sinking back into the emerald comforters and pillows.
“Hey, Ruth,” Harry replied. “I’m Harry and this is Draco. We’re from MTV’s show Catfish. You sent us an email about wanting to meet your boyfriend Chris and we just wanted some more information.”
That was the very definition of sap, according to Draco. “I never took you to be one of those guys who’s obsessed with love. True Love and all that.”
“And having a kid would soften me up?” Grace scowled, entirely disgusted with what she was hearing.
“Woah,” the muggle said. “Why?”
“Upstairs!”
“Good, Daddy,” Harry murmured, the word so delicious in his mouth now that he wanted to add it to every sentence he spoke. “Just stay here with me, that’s all I need.”
Luckily, it was just a text message and Harry wouldn’t have to try and form coherent sentences this early after having woken up.
*** *** ***
Even though the thoughts of skeletons missing pieces would probably haunt him for the rest of the night, Harry opened the door and eased into his domain. Unfortunately, his domain was in a state of disarray.
Harry elbowed Draco’s shoulder and pointed out of one of the stained-glass windows. “Look! I think she’s enjoying herself. At least your peacocks value consent, I suppose.” Beyond the window, one of the peacocks had spread his ivory tail feathers to impress his new girlfriend, and she had taken a shine to him. What happened after that, well. Harry could have lived his whole life without seeing two peafowls mate.
The animagus promptly chucked the Chuck Taylors with ‘P.P.’ written on the inner seam into the lake. The splash it made was not nearly as satisfying as it should be. “Nothing to do with him.”
“Nghrk,” said Draco, lowering himself gently so as not to crush Harry beneath his weight.
“Nutter,” Remus said fondly before giving him a quick kiss.
“Yes,” Harry whispered back anyway, figuring it would be rude not to. He let out a squeak when Draco closed his thumb and forefinger over the pink nub, rubbing between his fingertips as Harry squirmed harder than ever before.
“You’ve tried this?” Harry asked. Draco’s history was still not fully explored between them.
your sorry arse no matter what you do.”
“Ready.”
“Sure took you long enough,” Pansy greeted him with the utmost affection that a Parkinson was capable of. She had long since changed out of her front desk uniform and was in a tight little number of a green dress that brought Draco once more back to his schooldays.
“Oh, don’t flatter yourself.”
“Well, are we not all scholars?” Potter asked with a grin. “Had to be to get here. Give me your official answer, Professor.”
Considering Draco had helped deliver Rose, Ron looked past the fertility jokes.
?” Draco snapped in disbelief. He too stood now, seeing witches in their Auror-blue robes now gathering outside his window in the front yard with wands drawn, lit up by the flashing lights.
“Draco,” Hermione hissed, fist clenched nervously around a handful of her blankets. “What is going on?”
A sharp nod cut Ron off. “Yeah, it is. I’m not having the nightmares anymore, and I’ve been a lot less paranoid.” Harry hated when people asked about his therapy. It made him feel even more ashamed for having to have it in the first place. “I just didn’t sleep that well last night.”
He shrugged. “Maybe I do and you’ve just gotten used to it. Hey, you know what we should do? We should go back to the Quidditch pitch and find where I—“ Then he remembered. The pitch had been burned down. “Um. We should go where I made that carving of our names and carve it in the new pitch.”
Replaying the text of the ad a few more times in his head did nothing to ease Draco’s mind. He Vanished away the magazine with a resigned huff, reserving this dilemma for Future Draco.
“And I’ve got Hogwarts.”
“So I will hear nothing more of this about the man our Harry has chosen to bring home. Have I made myself clear?”
Ron and Harry laughed. “I dunno, mate, do we know how that is?” Harry asked him.
“I have heard of the front-page news, yes,” Luna said, voice sympathetic and soft. “Please, come inside. I have a pot of tea on.”
“Make a wish!” Pansy reminded Draco as he leaned in to blow out the candles.
With a snort, Draco looked up from his food. “So now you’re a sniper when it comes to unentertaining classes?” If anything, Pansy herself was an entertainment. Draco could at least roll his eyes at her from across the room in history class.
“We’re not sure. Ron was thinking about Neville and Luna, but I’m leaning more towards George and Angelina.” Luna was a sweet girl, she really was, but if her son came home blabbering about Nargles one day, Hermione might snap. “They’re just wonderful with Fred Jr.”
“I’ve known to fear Kneazle-batting since Crookshanks,” Harry nodded. “See, Hagrid?”
“Thanks,” Draco nodded when he got his as well.
“Here you go!” said the kid named Kenny, holding out a bag for Harry. He loaded them into the caddy, near-full now.
With a little chuckle Harry settled back so the slices would stay flat and still, the darkness of his own eyelids comforting when that darkness was spent with Draco Malfoy. “Hey… Draco?”
Harry let himself laugh at that one. “I’ll say.”
“Fine. Call-
“Cooking, Healing, and a credit card?” Harry whispered to Draco as they were led through racks of expensive clothing. “Next you’re going to tell me you have a mobile.”
The finishing touch on the Frappuccino of Draco’s dreams was a perfectly-poured whipped cream pyramid. It would be the ‘cherry on top’ if Draco particularly liked cherries. Coffee was much better.
“Good point.”
Draco held the thick book with one hand while the other rubbed Harry’s back in soothing, large circles as he read. Harry was in Draco’s warm embrace and could smell the expensive cologne on him while he gobbled up his plate of dessert eagerly.
“Stop what? It’s true.” Blaise reached out to curl a strand of her hair around his fingertip. It was strange, having just slept with someone else but being more attracted to Ginny than ever before. “You’ve got a body that lots of women would kill for and kill to be with.”
Draco snorted. “Of course I cook, Harry, I’m a grown adult man who lives on my own. You’ll be happy to know I also insisted my parents learn to cook without the aid of house elves in France as well.”
“Speaking of them…”
“About us,” Draco clarified. “You, and me, and this Manor we’ve built up… I don’t ever want it to end, Harry. I love you.”
“No way! This is sick, and wrong, and disgusting—“
Harry’s pants had been pushed down to his knees. Phone in one hand and prick in the other, he let out a small groan at the idea of some beautiful man getting him hot and bothered and felt his nipples actually hardened at the thought.
“I’m cold,” Draco defended. “And this thing is ratty as it is.” This time when he pulled back Harry’s strong grip had him stuck.
They did work, was the crazy thing. Looking between them now Ron could see every little look they exchanged, how in sync they were with each other. It was mad, and sort of brilliant.
Harry turned around as he spoke. “Hey,” he replied eagerly before he really even got a proper look at the other man.
Who it really was happened to be Hermione Weasley, and it was coming from St. Mungo’s.
Theo pulled out the golden ring for the full effect. Colin audibly gasped, which was the best sound he had ever heard.
“Thank you,” Harry perked up, quite proud of his work. It was the first and only thing he’d ever built, magic or otherwise. He looked towards the window where it was now too dark to see the grounds but he knew it was out there, something he’d built just for the two of them. “If I’m not careful I may get addicted to this feeling.”
It was a song that Narcissa had sung to Draco when he was a boy, a slow, lilting tune: Brahms’ Lullaby.
Hermione knocked twice before backing up and releasing Ron’s hand.
“Late afternoon,” Draco stressed.
The man’s face went pale and Harry excused it as being starstruck. “Famous…? Who is this person dating?”
“They could ride horses!”
“Do come up for air sometime, I actually happen to like having Harry around,” Blaise told them. He kept to himself the embarrassing fact that this was the happiest he’d ever seen Draco.
Maybe then Draco would respect him.
“That wouldn’t be necessary,” Harry shrugged, making the mistake of not checking with Draco first. “You could always stay—“
“Okay,” Harry said more to himself than to Draco, covering his index finger in lubricant. “Okay…” Harry lined his finger up with Draco’s hole to watch it pulse from the lightest of taps. Harry moved his fingertip around the puckered skin nice and slow, dedicated to easing him into this.
? Who the hell is Brian?” Harry said aloud in his confusion. He copied and pasted the man’s name into Google, itching for answers.
In silent protest, Lucius wrote down the alarm code on a nearby notepad with a flourish of his jewel-encrusted quill. They would change it over his dead body.
. Even in his relationship he had a clear sense of self-sufficiency, and the only time Draco would consider anything close to subservient to Harry was when they were in bed on special occasions, or when Harry was sick.
In messy red ink at the top of the page they were looking at, James had written ‘BIG PONCEY IDIOTS’ after Sirius had scribbled some notes to Remus.
“Exactly.”
“Only for you, my sweet,” Draco replied airily, taking the seat next to Harry and sitting down. Even though they had to share the table with two others this was a great date spot, and admittedly Draco Malfoy’s first double-date if it was to be viewed that way. “Should we start with a red or a white?” He opened the menu and turned first to the drinks.
. “How’s your stay here been?” Okay, that one he couldn’t hold back because he was punchy.
“I’ll upset whomever’s germs I please whenever I—“ Draco was cut off by his own cough.
“Well, have you heard any of them say anything homophobic lately?”
“Of course, dear.” Draco gave Harry’s shoulder a squeeze to test where he was on touch this morning and Harry eagerly leaned into it. Interesting. “Now, eat up. You have a long day of training ahead of you if you want it, remember?”
Harry’s chest bubbled up with warmth. “And Daddy’s only.”
“Breakfast is served,” Draco announced with a knock and walked into the guestroom with eyes wide and alert for the morning. “How often do you eat breakfast?” Draco followed up suspiciously.
Harry nodded. “Assigned female thus far.”
On the other side of the cafeteria, Harry was doing some math homework at his lunch table while Neville kept him company. Hermione and Ron were busy on the lunch line while Harry had packed, so he ate his peanut butter and jelly sandwich while they stuck waiting for the trusty school cardboard pizza.
Now Harry was really going red. “Thanks.”
“Don’t you dare come,” Draco countered seeing how into the rocking motions Harry had gotten, but still he did not stop. “You are a tight little cocksleeve, and I want to play with you more before you’re spent.”
“Goodnight, then,” Harry said, feeling strange about why they had been so prickly in responding to him.
Love? Since when did she call her slave ‘love’?
“You admire everything about me,” Pansy informed her with a regal tone. Sometimes, that nickname really did make her gigantic ego swell even larger. “There’s a lot to admire, so I don’t blame you.”
“Hm? Draco, you said some horrid stuff but you never exactly were guilty of being the pot calling the kettle black—“
?" Hermione demanded, her knuckles turning white from how hard she was grasping the sides of the hospital bed. "Harry, make yourself useful and owl Arthur and Molly. Ron, get the fuck over here. Draco–!"
“Sirius, shut up. I’m defending your honor.”
Harry had received the text from Brooke just an hour after their heated phone call that yes, she would meet but no, it would have to be away from her house.
“Also not a phase!”
Grace smiled. “He tutored me when I was back in school. I’ll try and channel his patience, hm?”
Draco was feeling similarly blessed, having waited so long to get inside Harry when he was all dolled up like this for him. “Such an obedient housewhore,” Draco moaned, nails digging into Harry’s hips as he moved them onto himself. “You’re such
Draco pushed his finger past the outer ring of muscle and into Harry, slowly inching up inside of him. Draco hissed at how velvety Harry felt around him. With his other hand he swatted Harry’s away from his cock, taking up both of their lengths at once. “Now, how’s that, little love?”
“Yes.”
Draco deflated, all of his anger leaving him in a breath. “Pansy.”
That just made Ron’s frown deepen. “I’m not here to nag you, Harry.”
Alvaro cocked his head to the side. "Did he go out with a friend of yours?"
The attendant behind the counter immediately zeroed in on him. “Hello there, and welcome to the Pleasure Chest. Can I assist you in any way? We have a buy-two-get-one sale on personal lubricants today.”
“I’m going to go up to my room now,” Grace interjected before leaving whatever fight was soon to come behind. No need to stress out Fiona, or Bella, or Cassidy, or whatever they were naming the damn thing. She couldn’t think of anyone besides Nymphadora Tonks that had died in the second war that they would spend time naming their daughter over.
"It's less chit-chat if they already know my name."
Harry took Draco’s hand and followed him through the door on the opposite side of the room to a humid hallway with several more doors. Draco led them to a room labeled ‘Steam’ and opened the door to release a wave of wet heat.
. Do not tell me you had a threesome with
a fifth year. Next year Remus would be seeing her for the sixth time around, and hoped that she could keep up with her homework schedule this time. “Miss Sato, what can I do for you?”
Day six of training had barely begun and this was shaping up to be Harry’s favorite day yet.
“When was the last time you saw him?” Hermione asked, voice creeping on panic.
Had Harry mentioned that? Well, he had gone on quite a bit about the material of the clothes those women wore. Harry was a tactile man, and everything from the dessert they’d had last night to now was a physical phenomenon with Draco. This man made Harry’s whole body feel charged, from his crown to his toes and some key spaces in between.
The prompt is “Harry and Draco coming out together at the Ministry's Memorial Ball for the end of the war” from lightacandledontcursethedark on tumblr.
“You cheeky boy.” Draco kissed his cheek. “But how can I blame you when you’re learning from the best?” He kissed his other cheek. “So give me ten, and we can talk about that round two.”
Obviously, the strike had no effect on the real world and was not even picked up on by the press. After the third day, he gave in and ate his creamed corn.
“Yes…?” Narcissa prompted. Her love for her son and his husband was much less complicated. Narcissa loved Draco. Draco loved Harry. Therefore, Narcissa loved Harry. It was all about what made Draco happy.
“It’s gone now,” the cameraman frowned. “Sorry. I don’t think it was anything. It just felt like for a moment it lined up with your calls.”
Draco lined up his cock and pushed it in with one swift motion of his hips, mounting Harry and encouraging his legs around his waist. Draco bit his lower lip at how right it felt to sink into Harry’s warmth, crawling forward to bite down on Harry’s lower lip in return.
“I will,” Harry confirmed with great cheer, and took Draco’s arm with greater ease this time around.
“You haven’t checked the mail?” Draco asked quickly.
Draco pulled out a chair for Harry and the man murmured his thanks as he sat down in it. “Such a gentleman,” Harry said with a grin.
.” Draco wrapped his hand around Grace’s wrist before yanking her back into the living room.
The day Harry had been appointed Head Auror he’d had a panic attack. It was Draco’s final straw before assigning Harry a therapist he trusted in the hospital.
It had actually been rather unnerving. Hermione knew that happened to new mothers with the rushes of endorphins and hormones and whatnot in order to keep the human race reproducing and caring for their young, but she hadn’t expected it so strong.
“Hey,” Harry called out from the bathroom door, quickly closing it behind him so Draco couldn’t see how he’d moved all the debris from the main areas into hiding. “You’re here, what, a minute and you’re already spying?”
Lily had seen this before. “It means the hat is having a hard time sorting him. Poor thing.” Hunter was more sensitive than most.
As evidence by her stellar first evening self-made green empire waisted dress, Miss Lily Malfoy-Potter had a passion for fashion. She learned how to sew as a little girl and had gotten free tickets to every Fashion Week and runway show in the world. Having the daughter of celebrity royalty at your event was one way to guarantee a huge turnout, after all.
Nothing Draco Malfoy-Potter did was desperate, though, so he was the first to speak. “Are you sure Zeke is the father?”
Dudley nodded. “Cool. That’s, uh, cool. How’ve you been?”
A strangled whine burst from Harry’s mouth before he gave in on the need to touch himself. The sight made Draco quiver inside him before falling back into the rhythm of his strokes. The heat rising in his stomach was a familiar and well-loved burn.
“He’s…” Draco thought hard about it. “I don’t know. I don’t know what he’s like or who he is.”
Draco loved that about him. “The rules that you are supposed to uphold are the Sacred and Untouchable Law,” he teased anyway.
“They were alright,” Harry defended this time. They were nice men. They were the sort that introduced Harry to their parents. “But hey! This is not about me. This is about you.”
Fuck, that night with the ice cream had been incredible.
“Next one?” Harry’s jaw dropped. He’d known Draco had wanted more than one in theory, but this was an actual agreement. Plus, nothing would get back at Lucius like forcing him to love a grandchild that was a muggleborn. It was almost a sick sort of pleasure that Harry got out of it. “Promise me.”
Draco huffed and set his laptop to the side. “Fine.” With his penguin pajamas and matching slippers on, Draco marched his sorry arse downstairs to whatever sort of discipline awaited him.
“I grew up in a castle,” Pansy shrugged. “It wasn’t really a town.”
“So what vile and purist crap did you spew at him?” Harry didn’t even need to ask if it was about purebloods versus muggleborns. He’d been in school with Draco at the height of his bigotry and had seen the man say some frankly disgusting things.
“I don’t care about the tarts who come after you or the tarts they give you. You, you…” Draco lifted Harry’s shirt above his head and tossed it to the side. Laid out on his back, messy raven hair caught in a strip of sunlight from the window, Harry Potter looked like a dream. “You are the love of my life.”
The only moments of true clarity amongst the muddled relationship between Wesley and Vera, who later turned out to be a frequent customer of the ice cream stand Wesley worked at, were in the moments Draco and Harry planned while off-camera.
Goyle, who had stuck to beer for the evening, stuck to what was really important: cutting the cake. “Here you go,” the man said, handing a plate to Draco and then one to Harry.
Draco—who considered airplane food to be somewhere below garbage—had whined about how Harry’s airline chicken was worse than the food at their high school. It smelled foul enough to make Draco plug his nose, too.
When no such thing happened Draco supposed it was time to tackle the guest bedroom considering he might have a guest soon that wasn’t just Pansy or Theo crashing in his bed. Draco selected the one closest to his own room but still a ways down the hall, to keep his sub close but not invade his privacy. The submissive having his own room was important. He needed a space to decorate, to fill, and to retreat to if he needed it. His independence wasn’t going to be forfeit to Draco, not entirely, that wouldn’t be any fun at all.
Harry shook his head. “No, I’m not happy now. That’s maybe the last thing I could possibly even be right now. You’ve never apologized, Malfoy. Ron apologized about the things he said to you.”
“Of course.”
She felt responsible for it. Not in the way that she’d drop out of school and give her life up for the damn thing, but in the way that she wanted it to have a decent life. With Draco and Harry, it was crystal clear that their standards of living would be more than ‘decent’.
“Don’t stop,” Harry begged. He needed this repetitive, almost painful stretching more than ever. His chest being clamped only added to the experience, amplifying the sensation of his lower half. He was blushing around the hot tears falling, hoping not to be judged or worse, for Draco to stop. Sometimes Harry had cried when he masturbated, but he didn’t do that anymore, not when Draco controlled his every orgasm. “It’s good, it’s so good.”
Rachel was stunned silent for a moment.
“I know,” Harry nodded. He turned in slightly on the barstool so he could keep scanning Draco’s face, trying to memorize it all over again. There were those shrewd silver eyes, and then there was that big nose of his, something Harry now reacquainted with found disturbingly charming. “We had this conversation some years ago, but I’m glad we can have it again. I disagree with you on one point, though,” Harry switched up on the other man, seeing how he handled the repartee. “You do still have to fill me in on just about everything after that day. You’re a Healer now.”
An inhuman cold came over Draco’s body, pale like he’d seen real ghosts be. “My parents, Harry. My parents read The Prophet.”
Remus put his arm around Sirius’ shoulders and leaned into him on the couch. “I don’t know how to break this to you, Padfoot, but you always have had a talent for stuffing your face with food.”
“You’re impossible.”
“That doesn’t mean you can’t make my stay a little… Comfier.”
“Harry!” Draco greeted him, leaping to his feet so he could hug him in a drunken display of affection. “You’re home and you smell nice. I’ve decided we need to purchase a film studio because I am a genius with porn.”
It was more often than not the negative that Draco dwelled on in his inheritances—membership to the world’s worst Death Cult, purist ideals, a generally repressive atmosphere—he did know one thing: His parents loved him, and had made all their mistakes for the sake of protecting him and his future. Draco would write to them soon, let them know he was settled in the castle.
decision,” Lucius sighed, exasperated.
He’d tried every tactic he’d learned at the Auror Academy and then some on Marcus Nott. Negative prodding, positive prodding, bartering, intimidation, controlled fear, throwing Ron in there to do whatever it was that he did, and Harry had to stop himself short of torture.
Harry certainly couldn’t argue with that.
The mother gave both Harry and Draco the stink eye while Draco mumbled something about how children on airplanes should be quarantined.
“You are. You haven’t even given me one sassy hair flip this entire time. I’m beginning to think those stereotypes were all just cruel lies, Harry. Look at how disillusioned you’ve made me.”
Harry zipped up the trousers and looked at himself in the mirror. The way these hugged his hips made him look like an entirely different man than before, and he felt like one, too. He straightened his slouched back so that the silk shirt would be pressed to his skin without wrinkles. Now for the moment of truth.
“Draco,” Harry said breathlessly, that smile never leaving his face. “You just made a hotel meet-up with fifty women sexual.”
“Damn right I am,” Ron muttered.
“Oh?” Harry let out.
bed.”
“That I did,” Draco nodded. “And this time we don’t have to worry about the crew walking in.”
“Also a great snogger.”
“Harry,” Draco said as he sat in the chair across from him. “What is going on in your head right now? I can see smoke coming out of your ears.”
“I know you don’t like her.”
Why hadn’t he gone out with his friends?
“You,” said Pansy, a finger pointed square at Draco. “You are telling me,” she paused for a breath. “You have Harry James Potter, your painfully obvious childhood crush, tied up in the Manor somewhere
Draco could only imagine his mother seeing her grand-baby. Little Lily. “Hermione,” he said gently. “We’ll bring in Healer Baldwin to prep you for surgery soon. She just needs to finish up with another patient.”
The portkey took the three to what Draco at first thought was an open field. When he turned around, though, he saw the mismatched tower that was The Burrow standing tall and proud through years of repairs.
It was really only a matter of seconds before they lost their self-control and burst into laughter.
“I just had to ask,” she panted, clearly out of breath from running. “You and the Malfoy-Potters.” Tiffany could barely gain the air to get a full sentence out. How long had she been running?
“Yeah,” Harry agreed happily before conforming to Draco’s shape entirely. He kept his hands planted on Draco’s arse as he lined up his cock, wanting to be able to push Draco inside of him himself.
Narcissa enveloped Draco in another hug regardless of whether he was volunteering one.
“I don’t really care what
“It’s definitely weird,” she nodded. “But it’s nice.”
“That won’t do,” Draco said with a tsk-tsk and wag of his finger before jumping into some good, old-fashioned degradation. “You’re a whore, you remember that, right? You put an ad for your body out in a public newspaper for the market to decide what to do with it. You need punishment so terribly you wrote a glorified want-ad. Sluts like you should at least know how to walk in heels if you like rubbing off to just thinking of wearing them so much. You’ve never actually worn them before now, I’m assuming?”
I did not just hear you say the name of my baby boy in hopes of furthering some kind of agenda against a guest in our home.”
“You so do! You want to fuck Macklemore.”
Grace let out a frustrated cry.
Alvaro shook his head. "I know that. I was going to finish with 'and you clearly want each other'."
“Harry?” Ron asked.
“Oi, Malfoy,” Maggie said from the door frame, her Mediwitch scrubs finally having undergone a good wash after the flobberworm boils incident of the previous week. “Hermione’s got visitors.”
“Harry, you once hexed a girl for peeping on us when we stayed in that hotel in France,” Draco drawled with an easy grin.
Without needing any further instructions, Harry eased the rest of himself into that sweet hole with a commanding push. It would be unfair if he didn’t rough Draco up like Draco roughed him up.
There was something hypnotic about this bed. Before Harry knew it he was yawning, and yawning loud.
With a chuckle, Harry clicked ‘play’ on Draco’s remote.
“Well, not right now, no. But maybe someday, I dunno…”
“From what? The Prophet?”
“Looking for…?”
xxxxXXXXxxxx
Harry cracked a big grin—he was ready, too.
“Uhm, yes? For like three seconds?”
“Oh, you know us gays. We’re able to be easily paired with one another because all gay people are attracted to each other, and we’re born with intimate knowledge of beauty products,” Harry replied with a shit-eating grin.
“I was dating this one woman—my friend Kathy, I talk about her sometimes—and she got pregnant.”
His stomach growled, an unfortunate reminder that he often forgot to eat. He wasn’t trying to get any thinner, but for some reason it always slipped his mind that he had a body he needed to take care of. After the war Harry tried to gain the weight back from before the Camping Trip From Hell, but it never seemed to stick around long. It seemed he was doomed to be spindly and short at the same time. He forced himself towards the kitchen.
“Yes,” Harry whined. “Draco—“
Harry pulled out his phone and showed Draco the screen: 6:13. “Right now,” he served up as his final challenge to Draco.
Harry managed to shake his head in the bonds and whimper around his gag.
“It’s hard work, and often messy, but I love it,” Draco confirmed. “Before Harry I spent perhaps too much time there, but now I’ve got a nice balance between work and life at home.” Having Harry to come home to made all the difference. “I have a roster of regular patients who come to me for all their ailments and I know them well. I do get new patients from time to time as well, and some emergency cases. It depends on how short-staffed we are that day.”
Draco had to laugh at that, recalling his ‘Potter Stinks’ badges. “Well, ‘Potter Smells Lovely Actually and It Confuses Me’ wasn’t as catchy. And especially now…” Draco leaned in to rest his head on Harry’s shoulder. He took a deep inhale of the mixtures of scents he’d put together for him, and sighed happily.
Zeke knew when he was beaten. He picked up the quill and looked to Grace. “And you’re sure this is what you want for our kid?”
!” Lucius replied, exasperated. His usually-proud shoulders slumped. “You grew up there, I grew up there, and your children will grow up there.”
He nodded and looked around the room before putting quill to parchment.
With a bit of shame Harry reflected on how he had better hygiene habits in school than now. No melancholy could last long, though, not when Draco’s handsome pointed chin was touching him and rewarding him for washing up like he’d asked. Draco breathed out against his neck and Harry shivered.
“It’s what we’re here for,” Draco joked, voice light enough to chase away the heaviness of the moment.
“Dudley.”
From behind the young man, the guest that Ron and Harry had actually been expecting appeared. “Sean?” Remus asked, confused as to why one of his students was looking bashfully at the ground of the Auror department. “What are you doing here?”
That took some serious effort on their part to make sure James wasn’t in love with her braids, her hands, her style, or her body, but he loved Lily Evans for Lily Evans. He was the first. Her first.
“So you really have been here before?” Harry asked, looking around the entrance hall. From what he could tell there was only a coat check and a flight of stairs leading down, and that was it. “What’s this place called?”
The trip through the floo was an uneventful one, with Draco ending up going from one opulent house to another albeit more finished one.
Looking over her shoulder occasionally to check that they were there, the woman in the pink shirt finally got them to a maze of shelves and clothes racks. “And who are you two to her, exactly?” the woman asked the couple.
“It’s a hairless cat. See how regally it’s sitting? It’s also on the thin side. What do you think about that one that looks a little like a dinosaur?”
Blaise was the first to floo away, but Pansy wasn’t far behind. She gave Harry a last tiny wave before disappearing from the home entirely.
Harry couldn’t help but snort at the childhood memory. Things had been so much simpler back then. “He was a git in Hogwarts, yes,” Harry nodded. “But he never really wanted to be on Riddle’s side. Riddle was threatening to kill his parents if he didn’t do what he said. He’s put off that wretched purity complex, I promise. We even went on our first date to a muggle tailor and a muggle dessert shop.”
“Hey!” Draco shouted in surprise before returning the favor by giving Harry’s arse a spank. “Bad boy.”
To the side was a row of showerheads and Harry followed Draco’s lead in taking off the robe as they approached it. They folded the soft fabric and rested it on a table nearby, with Harry only slightly paranoid about how big the room was to be naked in. He would always be at least a little suspicious of such open spaces.
“Of course. I was fourteen and he was nineteen, and it was really sloppy. What about you?” It wasn’t a hobby of Theo and Colin’s to rehash their past experiences with people who were not the man lying next to them, but it was still the truth. The reason Colin loved photography so much was because it exposed the truth no matter what it looked like. The reason Colin loved Theo was because he was always honest.
Draco looked down at his phone screen and continued to fret. Lucius had picked him up from MildMay with eager questions in the car in attempt to relate to Draco, but he’d gotten even worse feedback than usual.
Colin didn’t even notice when the bartender wrote his name and number on the napkin under Colin’s drink. He was a ray of bliss in the bar, knee bouncing impatiently while he waited for his friend to arrive.
“Maybe,” Draco laughed sardonically before popping a piece of chocolate in his mouth. “It’s about all the shitty dates I’ve ever had.”
He parted Harry’s legs and flattened his tongue against Harry’s arsehole just so he could hear Harry call out his name again.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You know what? Nevermind. Never change, Draco, never change.”
Harry quickly put them back against the wall, palms flat. “No, you didn’t, I’m sorry.”
He felt a horrible, rotten anger growing inside of his chest. Had they all just expected him to lay down his wand and die over this? Oh, how little they knew of his tenacity. Draco would show them, he’d show them all.
The elf fired the chilly ice shards that had killed the worgen the first time around, but Draco had lost his advantage.
“Looks like we now have—“ Remus looked at his watch. “Forty-five minutes until the train comes. Why don’t you tell me what food you
“Have you ever seen either of them shirtless?” Pansy demanded.
“Dinner is ready!” Molly eventually declared and waved her wand to ring a bell.
“This is—“ Harry said and everyone went unexpectedly quiet. “This is not the outfit I was going to wear to meet you again,” he spoke of his t-shirt and plain trousers. It was all he could think to say. “Um.” He stood up, letting the cloak fall to the floor behind him in a heap. Harry put the vase back on the table and then turned around to face Lucius and Narcissa. “Hello.”
“Was there a wrong answer?”
Kingsley either didn’t hear Harry or pretended not to hear him. It didn’t really matter. “And get to hair and makeup.”
Harry, helpless to do anything about it, watched the blood elf hop back on his dragon and fly into the night sky. It was lucky for him that the concept death was only temporary in the virtual gaming world.
“I’m angry that she didn’t tell me she’d decided on adoption!” Zeke argued.
It was the night after Hermione and Ron’s wedding, an affair held at the Burrow like Bill and Fleur’s and George and Angelina’s had been. There was dancing, laughter, and an irresistible buttercream cake.
“Hate Chris.”
“Never, darling,” Rita assured him unctuously over the brim of the newspaper. She found a line she particularly liked and laughed gleefully before sealing the paper again. “And here’s your coin.” The Prophet might be just a ‘dirty tabloid’ to most journals these days, a relic of the nineties that ought to have died long ago, but they still had the deepest vaults in Gringotts. Rita had a feeling they were about to get deeper.
Pansy was the first to poke fun. “Get into a fight with an eggplant?”
Harry burrowed his face into the dark of the blanket to discover new horrors. Dementors floating his way beneath the darkness of the fabric, their horrible sucking sound pervading the air. Harry screamed but no noise came out, tossing the blanket off himself and sprinting off the bed.
“Thank you, mother.”
Draco spent the last few minutes of the thirty he’d given Harry standing at attention in front of the grand fireplace where the Floo was in the Manor. He counted down the seconds on his watch, comforted by the repetition of the numbers and the constant circular motion of the second hand.
“Thank you,” was all Harry could say when Draco’s sweet, sweet palm was pressed up against him. “Thank you, thank you—!”
The ‘yet’ bit was unsettling nonetheless. There was still very much an opportunity for him to be duped by an internet predator with a handful of candy.
“Huh?” Harry asked, caught off-guard.
Draco looked down to see Hugo nodding off.
He loved his friends! Harry saw Ron like a brother and Hermione had been there for him in the toughest times of his life. Dean and Seamus were fun albeit mushy, and Neville was a loyal guy who never let Harry down.
“Hello to you, too,” Draco said with a grin, tousling Harry’s hair. “Forgive me if I’m foxed, that woman knows how to ply me with drink.”
“Exactly,” Draco chirped. “People usually know what they want, but not what they need or how to get there. That, and there’s something achingly beautiful about a man in pain because he’s chosen to be for a purpose, don’t you think?” Draco watched Harry swallow thickly with some pride. “Now, it is only fair I ask you in return of your role,” he happily flipped on Harry.
“Of course,” Draco replied and passed them right along. It felt bizarre and otherworldly to be called such a thing, but Merlin help him if it didn’t make Harry smile.
“Because I am a little,” Harry admitted. “A little foxed.”
Draco’s stomach felt light. “Well, then.”
“Er.” Sure it was, right? Oh, Harry was going to kick his arse for taking such a long pause. “It is.”
It hadn’t occurred to Grace that while Narcissa was braiding her hair that three generations of women were in that room. A grandmother, a mother, and a daughter were there even though one couldn’t speak.
"No," they replied at once and Harry thanked Alvaro for the solidarity.
“I don’t need an ‘I Told You So’, Moony,” Sirius sighed. “And you are such a hypocrite for saying that she can’t do drugs.”
“She was worried about the same thing when I got married. I hope she realizes ‘having babies’ and ‘settling down’ are different things. I don’t think I’m even capable of the latter. When the kids are old enough to floo with us, we’re going on wild and exotic vacations with them. There will be at least two nights a week when Harry and I go out with just one another, and Pansy will have the pleasure of babysitting.”
“Oh? I’m flattered.”
A small and lanky girl scrambled up to the stool, excited as ever to have that musty old hat on her head. The hat chuckled, flapping its folded lips. “We have a brilliant RAVENCLAW!” it announced. The blue-clad students cheered and welcomed in their newest member.
“Thrilled,” Harry responded breathlessly, undulating his hips forward against Draco’s hard-on.
*** *** ***
Harry James Potter, conqueror of the Dark Lord, done in by memorization classwork. He flipped through his textbook in a quiet panic.
“As, uh, nice as that all is,” Ron interjected. “Will Harry be safe when you tell your parents?”
“Off,” Draco managed through their kiss, and Harry’s first and most pathetic thought was
Draco settled in some more, resting his head in the crook of Harry’s neck. “Good, good…” Draco let his eyes close for a moment, exhaustion washing over him. He couldn’t rest long, though, not when Harry needed his immediate attention. “Such a good boy,” he murmured, moving up to pepper his cheeks with kisses using his nose as a bridge between them.
“Hello?”
“Thanks,” Harry replied. Off to the side, he could see Draco rolling his eyes and decided to ignore it. Draco was the one that was making him buy hot clothes anyway.
“Am I ever going to get to meet your parents? I mean, if they don’t perish at the thought of their daughter courting a woman.” Maggie wasn’t even sure if Pansy’s parents knew much about their relationship beyond what The Prophet said.
“I really do,” Harry urged again and was met with Draco’s hushing index finger. He quieted down.
“It’s perfect,” Harry responded with a sleepy grin.
“I assume you got a small mountain of messages?”
Narcissa was on the edge of her seat. “Yes?” What could it be? Injury? Danger? Rise of Neo-Death Eaters? Them moving to a far-away country? Her mind went to the worst possible situations.
Kennedy motioned to the man on the couch. There was no mistaking it, he was definitely her father. They had almost exactly the same nose and both had blue eyes.
“Not if you come back home to me in the end, no. I mean, you’re a woman, right? Okay, duh, you’re a woman, but that’s not what I mean. You have complex needs just like I do. Do you really want to get married and only sleep with one man your entire life?”
“Yup. George has already convinced himself that he’ll be the uncle who buys my kids firewhiskey when I’m not looking.” George had aspirations of being a Sirius kind of godfather.
It didn’t take long at all for Harry’s tongue to lap out of his mouth during these kisses, turning to long, languid licks up from his bollocks to his cockhead.
“Yeah,” Harry laughed as he remembered himself stewing in his room over this. It seemed a world away in this colorful bar. Here in this larger-than-life space he was having a more-than-civil conversation with Draco Malfoy, maybe even a flirtatious one. “A lot of them didn’t even sound like they read my words, but I knew you did.” Harry pivoted further to face him. “Draco?”
The pregnancy had brought them together and it was the pregnancy that Healers told her she would never have.
“What does it say?” asked Draco, looking over Harry’s shoulder.
“And don’t fall asleep with the television on again. It disturbs the sleep cycle.”
“Just grab what you like,” Draco shrugged. “They’re all pretty stretchy, so you don’t even need to try them on.” Nobody had ever taught him how to budget or shop without emptying his week’s salary, which was a rare opportunity for Grace to see.
“How’s the case going?” Hermione asked. While her daughter was lovely for watching telly with, she wasn’t the best at stimulating adult conversation.
Albus Dumbledore was gay and Draco remembered the snide remarks his father used to make about his leadership. Some other insufferable parent could make the same complaint of him, in addition to his sordid past. Draco wouldn’t allow it.
“How dare you wish nightmares on me.”
Lucius shook his head.
Sirius gave his cousin-in-law a small shove. “Let the children do what they want, Lucius,” he said in a voice of mock-concern that wasn’t in an entirely mean spirit. “You’ll give yourself a hernia.”
The subject matter of his words were serious but Harry couldn’t help but smile whenever Draco complained about straight people. It was so funny, that disgusted curl of his lip up when he talked about hexing homophobes or exacting bizarre revenges on the Dursleys.
“Yeah,” Harry said, cracking his first smile since the Aurors left. “Me too.”
The two voices stopped as two Healers stopped dead in their tracks upon seeing Healer Malfoy enter the stairwell.
Her eyes locked with the other woman’s in complete understanding.
“I’m pretty sure that is a breed of fox.”
Not a single question was answered after that. He fucking stonewalled Harry Malfoy-Potter. It felt like a stupid kind of irony.
Rolling his eyes, Harry didn’t even bother guessing who let the news slip. Either Skeeter or some other prying journalist had broken in, one of the downsides to a centralized adoption agency where the Malfoy-Potter papers were kept between the Smiths and the Joneses.
“You have terrible timing.”
“Is that the paper girl?”
Draco didn’t particularly want to play Auror this morning but it wasn’t like he had any patients to tend to. “Can we discuss this later?” he asked, already feeling drained by the day and it had hardly started. “I have some paperwork to do that Pye will skin me alive for if I don’t complete by end of day.”
Harry could have strangled him.
“My point exactly,” Harry laughed. “You don’t know what it’s like to struggle with rent like Lorraine was struggling, and you don’t know what it’s like to
Leaning into his touch, Colin sighed. “I just wish that this wasn’t happening. I know my dad deserves to be with someone he fancies and all, but…” What he was thinking sounded dumb after a decade of dealing with it.
“Am I wrong?”
Draco accepted the request quickly.
He huffed. “No, Draco.”
Being alone before Harry in this big, empty house was overwhelming.
As far as the people in the neighborhood knew, she was a glamorous and young trophy wife of some Russian mafia boss. None of them had to know she was a teenager when her tits had gotten so big. That was always a plus.
Kind and cruel, empathy and torture… Draco brushed his fingertips over the words as if that could better help him feel them. He had even stressed discretion as Pansy advised, and Draco was now properly horrified to realize he was taking her advice.
‘However long’ he was out…? “Well, how long are you planning to be out?”
“You don’t have to be sorry,” Harry murmured. “This is an emotional process.” At least he figured it was. “Do you want me to walk you back to the lobby?”
They side-hugged with the arm that wasn’t holding Harry.
Something clicked. “It couldn’t be.”
“Wow! Thanks, mister! I can buy a whole video game with this!”
“Draco,” Harry growled in frustration. “Have you ever even met yourself? Everything you touch turns Technicolor; you make the world so much more wonderful to be in with your humor and your way of thinking. You’ve changed so much from when we first met, you’ve overcome so much. It’s fucking astounding.”
“What would you call it?” Harry demanded with a bristle.
Harry—oh, how appetizing he’d look in some stockings—somehow understood that shift; that it was time to go after what he wanted and prove he wanted it in the first place.
“You don’t
“What?” Harry laughed. “They were horrible kids with Republican fathers that brainwashed them when they were growing up, it wasn’t so bad. It could have been much worse.”
A world away in Romania at his much less-glamorous day job was another child of Weasley clan.
“Glad you like it. The pink isn’t too much?”
A crash came from one of the closed doors and Draco couldn’t help but giggle imagining Harry trying to hide a pile of sex toys. “Take your time,” Draco allowed him, amused with Harry’s attempts to make this place more presentable to Draco.
“I am not telling anyone from my family. Now listen up, and listen well. It is too fucking late for me to abort, and I’m not in the mood to go shopping for a coat hanger, you hear me? My aunt and uncle would kick me out, and I don’t want to live on the street. The only way this baby is coming out is if someone massively rich pays for a late-term abortion potion, or if someone takes the baby,” she seethed. Grace couldn’t take this anymore. “And since there’s a couple looking for a baby and I don’t feel like puking my brains out for a year thanks to hormonal insanity that the potion would bring: this is the idea.”
Harry brought his hand up to stroke Draco’s cheek. “Right.” He shifted so he could look Draco in the eye. “But you don’t
“I’m going,” Lucius clarified snootily. “To tell you that I have seen Theodore grow up. He spent a great deal of time at the Manor as a child for obvious reasons. He and Draco grew close, and he always got a mention in letters back home from Hogwarts. I consider Theodore family.” They actually were second cousins twice removed, but Lucius figured mentioning that after his early marriage plans for Draco would be uncouth.
One by one, they all turned to him and for the first time since his imprisonment, Marcus Nott smiled.
The two ate, bodies wanting from how much they’d walked the night before.
A little chill ran through him at the thought of lying there next to Draco in the dark when all he had on was a pair of tight Calvin Klein briefs. Harry tried his hardest to ignore it.
“You’re not the one who had to put on a gallon’s-worth of sunscreen just to come here, you bronzed bastard,” Draco murmured back, vicious in tongue even when he was sleepy.
“Alright,” he muttered before narrating what he wrote for the camera’s sake. “’This is a friend of Lorraine’s, I was wondering if we could talk on the phone’.”
“Any plans aside from cooking today, boys? You have my number, right?”
No matter how hard he pushed his body, though, Harry felt as if he were moving through molasses. His flight mattered not when he bumped right into two Aurors with their wands at the ready.
“Let’s just say our favorite Nott knows some people who know some people.” Theo and Sirius were strikingly similar in their way of dealing with sadness: drugs and sex. Sirius snuck a kiss in on Remus’ cheek, because this would undoubtedly lead to shagging. “Now, would you like to do the honors?” he asked cordially.
“That’s because…” Molly interrupted with a loud, showmanlike voice. “This is your card!” She reached behind Fred Jr’s ear and pulled out the Six of Hearts. Fred Jr. gasped and started to feel for anything else that might be hidden behind his ears.
Draco considered himself victorious. “Wonderful! So I’ll be helping old queens and learning about struggle and such. Great plan. This is going to look marvelous to colleges.” He got into position to scamper back upstairs.
Even one of the camerapeople snickered at that. Draco’s larger-than-life personality had quirks that were becoming obvious to all his coworkers. “Let’s turn in, guys,” the cameraperson said and ended their recording. “That’s enough travel and hotel footage for now.”
Kingsley cleared his throat.
Harry took one step, two steps, and promptly backed up into a high-arching end table holding what he could only assume was a priceless family vase. He had only a second to decide what to do, and he made his choice valiantly. Diving out with hand outstretched Harry caught the vase—only to expose himself through the cloak.
“Really? Because your ancestors fought for laws to keep muggles out of our hospital.”
xxxxXXXXxxxx
“You want this?” Draco asked teasingly because he couldn’t help being a git and because he genuinely needed to know. Things were moving fast enough to create a regrettable evening if Draco didn’t check in.
“And you’d be comfortable with us paying the medical bills and monitoring you closely?”
This one is anti-dedicated to JKR, that transphobic bigot. Let’s all be better than her.
“Wait!” Narcissa still had some power over the younger woman, and intended to use it for the greater good. “Don’t forget the biscuit. As a peace offering. After all, once Zeke signs those papers, you’ll never have to see us again. I don’t want any bad blood between our families.”
“How was your day?” Harry moved to strain the pasta in the sink, the smell of fresh noodles piquing Draco’s appetite.
“And who are the future leaders of this world?”
The next couple of women were luckily less dramatic, ranging from an uptown girl in khakis to a Syrian-born woman who had to use her wand as a translator.
“Come quickly,” Draco finished before whisking the ghostly dragon away. Maybe Remus would know where kids hung out those days. It was strange that he was the one most in-touch with pop culture since he was stuck in the seventies, but he was around kids all day for work.
“Thank you, thank you,” Harry continued because he couldn’t stop saying it now, lest Draco stop moving his hips like that, zeroing right in on his prostate with his cockhead.
“You did
“Fine.”
!” Draco exclaimed.
“Yes, Sir,” he choked out.
Harry sighed. “Fine, that was a stupid reason.”
The older man had apparated a way so fast with the notebook in hand that he didn’t even get a chance to look at the scribbled hint that Nott Sr. had left next to the bone.
Down came molten hot water, spraying Draco’s scarred chest and sliding down his body in rivulets when he dunked his head under.
“That’s… terrible,” Pansy had to admit. “But the other option, that someone stole and copied your record of the conversation…”
“Oh, shit! One second!”
Harry and Draco had several of these emotional nights leading up to the ruse they were going to spring on the next in the line of villains in their lives. They swore to each other they’d get out in front of these homophobic scoundrels, whoever they were. An outing was bad enough but such an outing had been an act of pure bigotry and hatred, pointing at them with intent to shame.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco assured them. Something within him was willing to work around the limitations of galleons for a boy who seemed destined to choke on a golf club. “I can get this little guy an appointment.”
“Your parents,” Draco murmured in a hushed tone. He’d never known how Harry’s parents had died, he’d always figured it was cancer or a car crash or something wildly mundane.
“If you,” Pansy murmured slowly, leaning in as every word came to her. “Could cheat on Ginny, and know you wouldn’t get caught—“
Draco nodded, cockiness fading when he was so utterly at Harry’s mercy. “Yeah,” was all he could reply, struggling through a nod.
“Hello?” the girl on the other end of the line answered. Being muggleborn had made her adept with a cellphone.
The phrase made Harry shiver. “Yes, Daddy.”
Remus took the bait. “What I want to know is how Walburga let a muggle movie past you into the house.”
Draco spread his cheeks to see Harry’s hole, casting his eyes to his when he turned his head. “You may come only after I do, don’t you dare get lazy on me.”
It was a good thing Harry seemed to be focusing on Draco’s clothes—and smiling, Merlin how handsome he looked when he smiled—because Draco’s jaw had almost dropped to the floor upon seeing Harry. Draco knew he’d picked out a great outfit, yes, but this was on a different level. These garments actually fit Harry, fabric gripping and caressing him soft and sweet as a lover. It made Draco’s mouth water.
“And I owe it all to Draco,” he declared with confidence.
Theo liked to imagine it growing legs, putting on a little top hat, and dashing off to hide where all unused engagement rings go. He also liked to think that there was an underground society of them, walking around until their owners eventually plucked up the courage to pop the question to their significant other.
Harry pushed the fabric of his pants down low enough so he could also get Draco’s pants down. His cock wasn’t hard yet, but Harry could certainly fix that.
Remus beamed. “I would hope so.” Whatever darkness his and Sirius’ godson hadn’t destroyed, of course. Harry was the most talented student to grace Remus’ office and private lessons, but he didn’t like to play favorites. At least not too obviously, anyway.
“Draco,” he said gently. “You need to go to bed. You have work in the morning.”
Draco gave him an enigmatic look. “I want to think I could have both, yeah.”
“I think you have another student to attend to,” Minerva pointed out, motioning to the Ravenclaw at the end of the Great Hall with her one lonely suitcase. Remus would be sure to send her back to her room with a second suitcase of his own to make sure she had everything. After all, he wouldn’t want Olivia to miss anything when she stayed at Grimmauld Place.
“I know. I happen to like them.”
“Oh, fuck. No. Have they run another article about how Draco and I are clearing out our ‘sex dungeon’ for the baby’s nursery?” It made no sense. Draco and Harry could floo to Hogwarts whenever they wanted, and those dungeons were much more authentic. Some rooms still had chains and broken furniture in them, too.
? Draco, when we were, you know, I felt so damn good and not just in the obvious way. My head was clear, my heart was lighter, and I felt like, like I don’t know, I had a purpose again.”
“Your magazine featured situations in which one of the parties involved…” Lucius shook his head in disgust. “Gets hurt by the other.”
Draco let out an exasperated sigh. They had left the Hospital for lunch for a nearby café for lunch for fear Draco’s office was somehow compromised. What had once been a safehaven for him felt like a reminder of the shame and guilt of the outing. “Fine,” he gave in, seeing his protests going nowhere.
He and Draco were just about to search who the phone was registered to, and Harry was afraid his hopes for Kennedy and Brooke’s romance would be squashed like their last case.
Draco couldn’t help the bitter laugh that pushed its way out of him. “Great. We’re just great. Are you sure you’re okay?” Where was the brutal honesty? Where was the scathing professionalism? Kingsley was either violently ill or he was up to something.
Draco immediately thought back to last week’s surprise in the tub. Merlin, he loved that man of his. “The theme can be anything, Pansy. The
“Correction: I am under you.”
“Well, I’ve never done it!”
“You’re going to be on television,” Draco reminded him. “You’re not going to go broke. You’re going to be famous like you’ve always dreamed of and when you take men back to your apartment after filming is done and they ask to get a closer look at what you wore for the show, you will be thanking me.”
The knowing look in Sirius’ eyes was starting to grate on Lucius, but he knew better than to start a fight over eye contact with a madman. He’d save their eventual fight for something more substantial.
“’Course it worked. They’re in one bed. Is MTV really so desperate on saving on hotel fees?”
If there hadn’t been a group of cameras breathing down his neck then Randy would have tried to lie. He would have gone for the ‘what couldn’t be me?’ response and feigned complete uninvolvement, but he’d always been bad at lying to crowds. “I…”
Harry rested his head on its side on the pillow, eyes cast back at Draco wide and expectant.
“Eh. Ask again.”
“My whole body for you, just like always,” Harry said softly, thighs spreading wide again.
“The worst part about that,” Remus said more to himself than to anyone else. “Is that I really don’t know if you’re kidding or not.”
“Do they… know?” Ron pressed.
“I know,” Tiffany softened. “It’s just… You know I’m being a bitch because I love you, right? You and the blob of cells hanging out in your uterus. So, I just want you to have a life after this. If you end up on one of those shows my mum is always watching about teenage girls who keep the baby.”
It was a room full of celebrities, and Olivia wasn’t sure if her twelve year-old frame could take it. These were the people she saw in papers and magazines, the couples she idolized, and the war veterans that had saved them all. Well, some of them were on the wrong side of the war at the time, but still.
“Oh, me? I, why, I said I had an invitation to this, er, soiree…”
“It wasn’t pressuring,” Harry said airily. “It was constant reminder of my needs in this relationship.” Lucius gave Harry a glare. “And your father’s—er—needs.”
“You’re a saint, Draco.”
To the woman on the phone, however, that sounded like the creepy heavy breathing that serial killers used on the phone before announcing they were inside of their victim’s house. “Who is this?” she demanded.
On an intellectual level when Draco said the Manor had been bulldozed and built anew Harry understood that. When it came to actually seeing it, though, Harry found himself holding his breath long after they’d found a private place to apparate.
Draco used that time to faithfully secure Harry to the bed on his back, legs spread wide open. His mouth was full of a ball-gag and his arms were fastened above his head. The rest of the ropes were really for show, but it made Harry looks like he was trapped in a spider web with no escape.
A flower-laced eyebrow on Theo’s forehead rose. “You were thinking about shagging me in a wedding venue? That’s scandalous, you horny fuck.”
“Right, of course.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that no matter how unlikely and ‘insane’ it all sounds, it could be the truth because of the money.”
Approaching them was a slightly overweight man dressed in slacks and a fedora, which was maybe the worst outfit possible in Draco’s opinion. The fedora was tipped down like he was some kind of smooth criminal, and all it did was make Draco resent him more.
“Absolutely not. Who are you clowns?” Ginny demanded. “Because my friend here doesn’t trust you.”
“That’s what I thought.” Kingsley was far too pleased with himself for Draco’s taste. He wanted so badly to wipe that grin off of his face. “Now that that’s taken care of…”
Luna drew the swirl of a green stem with her thin-tip pen. “We should be learning about important things like the secret existence of wizards and witches among us,” Luna lamented. “If everyone started using protection during sex so this class would become unnecessary, maybe we would reveal the world that’s right in front of our eyes.”
The phone almost rang out before Draco got ahold of someone.
“Maybe she’s in the closet,” he remarked sarcastically. “I hope she said ‘hello’ to Slughorn for me.”
Draco gritted his teeth. It was almost embarrassing how he knew the scale of every one of those in-game accomplishments. That took dedication and time, and Draco hadn’t run Ahn’Qiraj since he was in primary school.
Harry wasn’t quite sure how he was supposed to ‘round up’ the winged crowd that had perched in every available surface of their kitchen. None of them had relieved themselves on Draco’s precious marble counters, but there was still time for a bunch of owls to send Draco into a snit.
“Fine.” Harry grabbed the phone off of her desk, receiver and all. He dialed their new home phone number, holding his breath for Draco to pick it up the right way. Harry had gone through too many conversations with Draco talking into the speaker and listening to the mouthpiece.
Though a bit rusty on the hinges, the house was well off.
“No, fuck
Gregory Goyle’s eyes were wide, even behind his mask. He too was wearing a full suit, which he had insisted on from the start. “Want a towel?” he asked Harry carefully.
“Scare the shit out of him,” Remus told his Padfoot, who was still sitting on the floor.
The once-mellow look on Harry’s face vanished. All he could hear for a moment was the sound of his own swallowing. No, there was no way…
Even if Harry was fucked in the brain or something, how would he get treatment? Easy answer: he wouldn’t.
Taking that as a sign of victory, Lily padded through the garden in her bare feet that were covered in mud from running. Grandma and grandpa would make her wash her feet before she came inside, but that just seemed silly to her.
Draco, not needing much time to find it anymore, zeroed in on Harry’s prostate with his fingertip and began a relentless massage. Harry gasped and writhed against the couch, angling his hips to give Draco the greatest ease of entry.
Draco, a whole world of bickering left within him, would not let his point go. Father and son would argue about entirely different things into the dead of night, just as every Malfoy father and son before them, but the next morning Draco would wake up early to catch the mail.
, Head Auror,” he emphasized. He’d dealt with crazed fans and homicidal ‘avengers’ of all sorts from that media circus. They were not about to hurt his family more than they already had.
Harry’s groans climbed the walls, longer and louder as Draco worked him like he was the one being paid for it. “I’m gonna—“ Harry warned with a full-body shiver. “I’m close…”
“I can’t believe you’re offended by compliments. Anyway, tell me why it ended with Harvey,” he requested.
“Then down these go,” Draco narrated, pushing Harry’s knickers to his knees and hiking up the already-short skirt of the dress so Harry’s backside was exposed. “There you are.” Draco pinched Harry’s arsecheeks hard and smirked at the noise Harry made. “My pretty little slut.”
“When you’re finished up with that, all we have to do is patiently wait a week for our friends to fill up our gift registry and get drunk in front of them when the time comes,” Draco grinned as he watched Harry wrangle in each owl to tie a silken bow around each fragile ankle. It really was good to have someone around who was willing to touch animals.
“Actually, I have not a single clue. We’ll have to ask one of these pregnant teenagers how that works. They’re apparently ace enough at it to procreate.”
“Last one,” Theo confirmed from his bed. He was sprawled out and twisting the accursed ring in his fingers, as he was apt to do of late. “All your baby mamas are accounted for, and I think you’ve properly learned how to dial a number.”
She nodded reluctantly and Draco was sure to get every reaction as close-up as he could with his handheld. He hadn’t seen this coming and Lorraine had a point with her not being able to hear the phone ringing before that day. This could have been a lead or a dead end, and Draco wanted to capture every second of it.
“Can I just finish proposing?”
Ron and Hermione were helping in their own way, as well. They were waiting across the street in a diner, watching all who entered and exited the unsuspecting brick building. When Harry had told them of a harebrained, barely-functioning plan they had no choice but to join him in it, of course. Between Ron’s Auror senses and Hermione’s impeccable note-taking there wouldn’t be anyone unaccounted for.
The network gave them two cars. One for Draco and Harry, and one for the camera crew. The first car was outfitted with dash cameras that recorded the inside of the car to capture any exchanges between the two hosts that they wanted to use in the how or the opening.
“So,” Harry started, sitting up straighter under Draco’s gaze. Harry had been the one to say it, that forbidden word to start off this whole thing, and oh, how worth it everything was to see Draco’s face when he did. Harry could live through this, even if it was awkward, because he’d already made the most mortifying step, right? “I’m not calling you that
“I know that, Theo,” Colin laughed, swatting his shoulder. “Come on, get up off of the floor.”
“What—? No, Harry, no, she does not hate you. Pansy Parkinson reserves hate for those who deserve it and you don’t, not to me and not to her.” Draco realized he was coming on strong in his defense of her but all Pansy had ever done was defend him, so how could he not return the favor? Draco took a breath to calm down. “Funnily enough she thinks the same of you, that you hate her because she wanted to give you up,” he recalled of one drunken night spent venting to each other.
“Just once when he left me a voicemail on my birthday,” she admitted.
“Okay, they really kicked me out because they raised me wrong, or whatever. I am beyond help to them, and they were gracious enough to blame it on their own shitty parenting,” Grace reclaimed her voice. “So I wanted to tell you that my living situation has changed. I have no supportive family members.”
Draco followed Harry’s gaze curiously before breaking out into another signature Malfoy grin. “Hungry for more?”
“Well, then what term do you prefer?” he asked, exasperated.
Draco shook his head. “I know, it’s stupid.”
Their sense of fear for their little boy was only heightened after that night he’d gone out with a jar to catch some fireflies like he’d read about in a book. The full moon lit up the whole town for Remus not to trip or fall on some treacherous pebbles, but there was a man far more treacherous than any scraped knees in town that day. That night, Remus had gotten in his way.
“Unfortunately I’m beginning to have some idea of it,” Draco nodded with his knowing smile. “You are very welcome, Harry. To think you were the one I spent these past few days daydreaming of—‘H’, a submissive seeking solace. You are a vision in your new suit.” Draco’s eyes followed the seams of the jacket around Harry’s arms, wondering how they would feel to hold. “Any Daddy would be lucky to call you his.” What was he getting himself into?
Their wizarding audience burst into applause, the flash of camera lights filled the air, and Marcus Nott coughed up a little bit of blood in the prison infirmary before waking up with cramped but distinct sense of dread.
Maybe the reason why he was doing so badly in chemistry was a fault of his classmates. Neville was scared shitless of the teacher, Luna was always trying to talk to him about some ghost or another she swore she’d seen, and then there was Draco Malfoy.
Real or not, Pansy Parkinson—The Girl Who Lived To Never Commit—liked them. “Draco,” she gushed. “It’s so much bigger than that dingy old flat. You’ll have to put some nicer flowers in the front, though.”
“Let me guess, you brewed it yourself?” Harry asked, having caught onto Draco’s need for specificity in his products.
Without thinking, Draco leaned into his touch. “I know. I just wish we could skip it, you know? Get to the bit where we’ve got a roly-poly.” Waking up to a happy, gurgling little baby that was all their own wasn’t such an awful thought to Draco anymore.
Harry looked confused for a moment before remembering what he had asked for.
Draco had changed outfits three times before alerting Worgasm as to what he would be wearing through a quick whisper in the game. He’d kept it open while he was getting changed and had flown his blood elf to Karazhan so he could hear his favorite raid music of all time.
Harry whimpered and writhed against the bed. He could feel himself twitching back to life almost painfully. “Sensitive,” Harry got out between whines. “I can’t believe I’m getting hard again so fast…”
“…No.”
“It’s still weird.”
“Listen,” Harry chastised Draco. For someone who liked to pretend he was horribly regal, Draco really was an impatient man. “’I met Vera on a forum about theories on ‘The Shining’. Vera was so much fun to talk to at first. We’d chat for hours about movies and TV shows we both liked. We were boyfriend and girlfriend for a few months, but as time went on Vera got more and more possessive. She got angry whenever I posted pictures of me with friends who are girls.’”
“I… have absolutely no idea,” Draco had to admit. It was a good thing his world-saving boyfriend was able to hold them still with no words because Pye and his accomplice were pinned for Draco to inspect. But who was this?
Everyone cheered again, hands reaching out to muss up Draco’s hair or clap him on the back. He fought off all physical affection except for Harry’s, keeping his man tucked under his arm for the evening just like he knew he liked it. Drinking made Harry a little sillier and an ounce more socially confident as well, counteracting some of the anxiety he might feel.
“I thought we had this conversation last month,” Umbridge said as she teetered forward on her pink high heels. “This institution of learning has a strict policy on harassment and inappropriate language.”
If Grace had paid attention in her birthing class she would know that fetuses don’t breathe and actually take their first breath when they are born, but there was no way in hell she was going to listen to that woman blather on about bodily functions.
Harry changed into a long-sleeve white cotton shirt and thick brown trousers to hide what might be dirt. He had given up on plants since Hogwarts, but if he focused hard enough past the noise and guilt he could recall Pomona Sprout’s voice saying something about soil quality. He had the power of the internet in his pocket, too, with endless knowledge on muggle planting practices.
The only established elements in the rear lawn were the thick, leafy plants on the perimeter and keeping it private, and green grass well-trimmed in the center of it. Harry squinted, and in the distance at the edge of the property saw a small building. He began his walk towards it, a pleasant sun warming his back.
Blaise joined in. “And that sort of commitment is forever. As in, you know,
Ron looked between Draco and Harry, then to the table of spaghetti dinner, then back at the men. “What exactly is going on here?” Ron asked, Auror voice stern.
One of the cameramen gave Harry the signal to move into the Q&A portion of the interview. Each Catfish hopeful got some time to chat with Harry and Draco before turning them to the real challenge—the audience.
“You can have it all,” Draco said wistfully. The amount of galleons that Grace would do unspeakable things for was a trifle for Draco. He just didn’t care about it, which was the epitome of his privilege.
He spread his fingers out again, receiving a startled squeak from Harry who thought a fifth one was going in. Draco quieted those fears with a kiss to his lips. “I’m going to shag you,” Draco informed him with his signature smirk.
I stand by my headcanons that their first child is a little girl named Lily Narcissa Malfoy-Potter. I know it’s cheesy but I honestly just don’t care. Draco is dad and Harry is papa. Also this is kinda mad sacrilegious at the end, I have no idea why but I love doing that.
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s bare wrist. “Not from where I’m looking.”
“I want to help you.”
“Beautiful women,” he tried in a last attempt to save himself. “I meant that beautiful women don’t usually go for men like me. I’ve been burned in love before.”
Harry wasn’t going to challenge him there, taking the few he was handed and turning them over in his hands.
they did not snog. Even if they had, it was purely chaste.
he do?"
Before the next episode could suck them back into obsessively watching how MTV had presented them, Harry hit the power button on the DVD player.
The worst part was, Draco knew it was for good reason. No matter how rude, obnoxious, or self-obsessed she was… She was what they were looking for in a legal contract.
They teased each other like they were lovers across chat screens and raids they performed together. They were an excellent team and they never failed to get that banter and bickering up at just the right level of snippy and affectionate.
“The only person that deserves a father like Marcus Nott is Marcus Nott.”
Draco Malfoy in all of his obscurity and sudden burst of alertness from the coffee, turned the corners of his lips up. “I’m still not convinced.” This ‘Harry’ was interesting.
“I don’t just want to fuck you,” Harry blurted out suddenly, eliciting a look of embarrassed shock on Draco’s face. “I mean, I would love, love, love to shag you right now. That would be so perfect. What I’m saying is that I want more, Draco.” Draco hadn’t even really agreed to this yet and Harry wanted more. “I want to be the one that treats you right.”
The endless clamor of voices trying to scratch their way to Draco’s ears ended abruptly, leaving him to wonder if the whole thing had been real. “What?”
*** *** ***
Still shaken, all Pansy could do was nod. “Yeah, er, I suppose I’ve got nothing to do then.” Pansy had been hoping for a weekend of sex and general debauchery and felt all of the pleasure she could have had fly away, too far from her fingertips.
She honestly didn’t care, either. There was a line between right and wrong that Harry had crossed, and he’d betrayed his own morals as much as he had betrayed hers.
“For sure. If Ron wants to push any out, he is welcome to try,” she laughed. “Plus, my family has a detestable history of cysts.”
Harry did sometimes feel the rebellious urge to masturbate in secret, but it would doubtlessly come out in the heat of the moment and Harry would expose himself. It wasn’t worth the punishments that would follow, the less-fun ones that he got when he broke serious rules.
Still, the laugh drew the attention of the class, so Harry and Draco were left to hush themselves and make it look like they were still working.
Kingsley wouldn’t be accompanying them on their travels in order to work on all of his separate projects (The Real World Miami wasn’t going to direct itself), so they bid farewell to him at the airport and walked to Gate 3B as fast as they could. Harry would have accused Draco of trying to walk in front of him as some power-trip thing, but that would have set him off again.
“No,” Zeke huffed. “I just—I mean, she didn’t tell me!” His mother tried to silence him with a hand on his shoulder. “Stop it!”
Theo wasn’t having any of it. He put his free hand on Lucius’ shoulder and shook his head. “Lucius, let’s just get this over with.”
Colin kicked him under the table.
“Hey, I said not to worry about it, okay?”
Draco hit the record button.
“This is a moment?”
“Are so.”
Sirius grinned. Oh, his Moony was one sneaky bastard.
“Want to go home and watch The X-Files?”
Hermione’s eyes went wide, and her hand flew down to her swollen stomach. “Apparently, neither can he.”
Oddly enough, Harry didn’t. He picked a corner that Draco didn’t have in his line of vision to change into pajamas, content with what he’d gotten out of the other man.
“Draco,” Harry murmured as he carded his hands through his damp hair as the other man kissed his neck.
Harry inhaled sharply. Was this bloke for real? Either way the whole conversation was making quite the tent in Harry’s pants.
about this. You know what? Let’s just go. Let’s just run into the store and divide and conquer and get hundreds of bras. We could get an army of bras, if you want.”
“Harry!” Draco cried out roughly, a tremor overtaking his legs as he spilled and spilled inside of Harry’s mouth. “So good, so good, oh, fuck…”
And how could he not be? Harry had been abused by the Dursleys, then he’d been thrown into a magical world where everything was out to kill him, and there really hadn’t been a moment for the man to take a breath and explore himself.
Draco cleared his throat. If this was what his good boy wanted at bedtime then he’d get it. He started at first just by humming an old, familiar tune. Harry could feel the vibrations of his throat behind him.
“Exactly,” Lucius criticized. “And when he leaves you, who will you see in the remains?”
One kiss could have Harry hanging by a thread. They’d mastered each other’s bodies over and over again with no sign of boredom, and knew just what to do. Where to touch, how hard, how fast, how much the other could take…
Under the table Harry squeezed Draco’s knee. Draco covered the hand with his own for a moment before bringing both above the table to grab his utensils as the plates of scrumptious-smelling food floated magically down around them to settle on the tablecloth.
“Well, considering we don’t have anything planned until later tomorrow… If you’re up, I’m up. I was having boring dreams anyway,” insisted Draco.
Swallowing hard, Harry tried his best not to turn entirely red now that his shoulders were out in the open. Even they tended to turn pink when he got embarrassed. “Thanks.”
Waking up to a bird staring at you would be unnerving for most people. Those people, unfortunately, were not Narcissa Malfoy.
“It’s not me,” Draco insisted. “You know how my father is, and you know what lengths he can go to! I’m not a racist; Blaise is black!”
“If you think that’s bad, then you should just see how much the closet renovation cost,” Remus teased. His husband had a proclivity towards going overboard.
Olivia laughed to herself before facing forward again and walking on.
“Mother seemed thrilled about it and wants you over as soon as possible, it’s just father you have to win over,” Draco tried to frame for him. He put his legs up on the couch and over Harry’s lap. The sitting room was the perfect setting for a drunken evening with his beloved—though he hadn’t quite told him he was his beloved just yet. “He has… issues with you helping out with the Manor.”
“I hadn’t noticed,” Harry replied completely deadpan, brows raised. Draco laughed first and then they both laughed. Yes, Harry had seen him at his worst. “But I think you knew I liked them, too. Not the weird kid ones you came up with, but the way you said them.”
“I’m going to,” she decided before realizing her hands had curled into fists. There was something so unnerving about taking all of this beautiful new life without having earned any of it. “You said I could do whatever I wanted while I stayed here.”
Facing his lover, Harry had no problem at all getting dirty in the tub with him. He could see through the pink bubbles that Draco was getting excited, so he dipped a hand below the water’s surface to take hold of him. “So you wouldn’t know anything about this?” Harry asked innocently, giving Draco’s cock a gentle tug.
Harry’s emerald eye cast their spell upon Draco. He swallowed to gaze into them, and it wasn’t long before Draco was kissing him.  Harry melted under the affection because he wasn’t touched enough, he’d never been touched enough or kissed enough or hugged enough. Harry wanted it, he wanted it all from a man who he trusted, as Draco said in the bar.
“Are you really going to sit there and let me talk like this? Wow, this place really has defeated you. I guess I could just start detailing all the wild escapades he and Draco had when they were both single and you wouldn't even mind."
Before Grace could properly accept (because honestly, she would have been fine sleeping on their front porch) Draco whisked her away to the fireplace, taking her off to meet the grandparents.
Harry’s reactions made everything so worth it. Draco didn’t even really find what he was doing funny after the first hour of it, but Harry was still cracking up.
“The crooked feet tell me that you are also a complete arse—“ Harry went on.
“Yes, yes, I do. I’m especially interested in how it ends.”
Draco’s hand rubbing him up and down with such dedication sure felt like more than a ‘little’ encouragement. Harry’s toes were permanently curled under now in his heels.
“Hey,” he murmured, lips pressed to Draco’s chin covered in platinum stubble. It was rare that Harry got to see him so disheveled. After a night of copious shagging, though, Draco just couldn’t be arsed to get up and shave quite yet. “What’s on your mind?”
“You two are sick,” Hugo laughed back at Hunter’s sibling from a safe viewing distance.
“Second time’s the charm, it seems,” Harry agreed. He pulled back from Draco’s lips on his forehead so he could bring their lips together with an audible smack. He quickly checked his watch. “Well, that was July 31
better.”
“It’s the person on the other side of the phone number. I’m sorry,” Harry offered, walking with a protective arm around her shoulder until they were out of earshot of Chris.
“No. No, please. You’ve been kind enough already. Thank you for this, even if it got neither of us anywhere,” Rachel battled through the tears and wiped them away with her rough jacket sleeve. “I’ve made enough of an idiot of myself.”
Draco’s cheeks warmed up. “Essential to any summer outfit or subtle hangover,” he explained and closed the doors, feeling a bit exposed on that tidbit of information. Draco hadn’t shown anyone new his room in a long while.
Harry smiled back at him, legs spreading unconsciously.
Harry wondered if this was another trick to life he’d been missing—lists. Draco sure liked to make them from the look he got at his desk back in Draco’s master bedroom. His workspace was probably like that too—Harry had a sudden and perverse interest in seeing Draco’s office at St. Mungo’s.
The raid chat immediately flooded with similar sentiments.
The second morning of Draco going to work was as hard as the first.
Tom Riddle had always wanted his life, and Harry briefly wondered if that twisted man would have used this against him too somehow.
Still, he wasn’t done for the day. Something else Pansy said had caught Harry’s attention and he was headed further downtown for a store that would sell the item in question in his size. Harry was going to an ‘adult novelty and video’ shop, and he was going with bags full of toy train parts under his arms.
“Slytherins,” some more joined in.
“I’m not icing your fucking cake,” she said, eyes still closed.
They said their goodbyes to the couple knowing that they had more than enough problems to work out on their own.
She was blissfully unaware of what had just transpired. All she knew was that her nails were painted and the boy she liked was going out with her. “See you both later!”
Zeke’s hands were firmly in his pockets when he saw the maternity store and looked away like the sight burned him. He was allergic to all things baby.
Harry choked out a groan. “I need you to wreck me, Daddy.”
“Any time,” Draco said smoothly as he tried to read the expression on Harry’s face.
Draco led her to the counter to give the cashier his joint account number he shared with Harry. Lucius had nearly perished from shock when he heard about that one.
Aubrey paused. “Like, the rapper?”
“Agreed. It’s too obvious that it’s a Catfish,” Harry nodded. That may have been the name of the show but it certainly wasn’t what Harry was looking for at the moment. Harry wanted at least one honest person in the world if that wasn’t so much to ask for.
“You’d rather push a living being out of your vagina than never have a normal period again?” Tiffany asked skeptically, crossing her arms. She looked rather ridiculous in her sea-foam green bathroom with tin foil and yellow gunk in her hair, and Grace sort of wanted to slap that doubtful look right off of her face.
Draco placed his glass down and turned his gaze from admiring the room to admiring Harry. He’d worn a simple long-sleeve shirt and shorts in case any paint had gotten on them. The way he was sitting in the armchair hiked his shorts up ever-so slightly to reveal a soft expanse of thigh.
Harry moaned shamelessly as Draco’s cockhead ground against a spot that made him see stars. “I love it,” Harry replied through his strain. “I love being yours. Oh, oh—“ Harry cut himself off with a deep growl that simply had to be let out of him.
“Ooo, I like to call this room the Science Lab,” Ginny narrated on her tour of the next chamber. Harry stepped in to find out why.
Blaise swallowed his own drink in seconds while Pansy downed her own ice cream mix.
“Oh? And what was that?” Narcissa asked.
“When was it?” he asked softly. Remus’ worst fears had been realized when he’d seen the look on Draco’s face. It was clear that the poor boy had been there.
“Ah, so we’re in the same mortgage boat, huh? Tied to that home for life, am I right?”
“…Anyway, I wouldn’t want to be the hotel staff that had to clean up that mess when it was done. Lord knows what a blacklight would reveal!” The audience laughed, but that was mostly because whoever laughed the loudest got a free shirt.
.” He hadn’t known how badly he wanted to say that until he actually said it.
“Am I?” Draco asked with a smile. “Then explain to me why I am baby shopping with Harry this weekend.”
“Yeah. Sorry. Your mother and mine.”
“Fine,” Lucius answered cordially even though it had been a trying day with the new lesson plans for the primary school children trying to integrate some form of education on homosexual couples and parents into the regular program. It had been a goal of Lucius’ as part of his mission to understand every part of his son. “And school?”
“We reconnected,” Draco listed, ruffling Harry’s hair in return even if it didn’t make that much of a difference. “We reconciled, we… reunited in the way only we can.”
“Sorry—“ he tried before his mother grabbed him by the ear again.
“I’ve often been called ‘princely’,” Draco nodded before getting a nip from Harry on the collarbone.
The aisle in the middle seemed to glitter golden, too.
“Don’t care.”
Both hands in Harry’s hair, Draco held him steady as he thrust up into the silken warmth of his throat. Harry was sputtering but still had both of his hands gripping Draco’s thighs tightly, silently willing him on. Were it ever to become too much, Harry knew all he needed to do was snap his fingers.
When Harry heard the familiar crack of apparation, he turned around. Also gracing the Malfoy-Potter kitchen was Ron Weasley—who was busy digging into Draco’s bowl of fresh fruits—who appreciated Harry’s effort, but wished they weren’t doing this.
The opportunity was impossible for Harry not to take.
“The… ring?” Harry asked, confused.
Draco was the last one of the group to stand, camera in his hand. “Yes, you do. Come on, you know.”
“Wow,” Draco replied. “You actually got something right.”
“Good boy.” Draco pulled his hand back and Harry felt the warm press of a coated finger to his hole, properly dripping with saliva as well. With a little added oil from Draco’s quiet summoning spell Draco nudged the first finger at Harry’s entrance.
“But mum—“
“And to throw an unforgettable party, hence why I am here,” Pansy nodded.
“Harry is much better with people than you are,” Hermione nodded with a smile.
“Fine,” he shrugged. “You never have to learn cleaning spells with a maid. With a Manor like this, though… You’re going to need more than one. A team you’ll entrust with the care of every artifact, book, piece of jewelry, furniture item, and personal detail you two ever mention in front of them. When Harry and Draco come over you’d probably have to pay them extra to keep quiet about the Golden Couple.”
“You switch,” Draco said, eyes flicking to Harry’s with a disturbed endpoint already in sight. “Between wanting to climb me like a rock wall and thinking I’m some moral atrocity. You only see things in black and white, Potter, and you’re constantly either putting me on some sex pedestal or condemning me as the worst scum you’ve ever met.”
“Oh, we really don’t have to do that, Draco,” Harry relented, blushing under Draco’s gaze once more to be essentially admitting his enjoyment.
“We need to have a discussion,” Pye repeated.
On instinct, Ron and Harry grabbed the device. A flurry of lights and pressure spun around them. Ron always joked that the teleportation made him feel like he was being born all over again.
going,” Theo shrugged. Colin wanted to do the whole corsage and limousine thing for once, and Theo was sort of helpless in saying ‘no’ to him.
Draco shook his head. “No, I’d call it that,” he admitted. “It sounds insane coming out of your mouth, is all.”
And just like that, Blaise did a wildly sappy thing he would never admit to after he did it. He wrapped his arms around his girl and squeezed her tight.
“Do you have any in mind?”
“Draco!”
Draco handed a glass back to Harry—a dark glass of Amarone—and downed his own with ease. “Now,” he said, clearing his throat. “I’m ready.” He relaxed back into Harry once again.
It never seemed to matter what mood he was in, that soothing voice of Draco’s always managed to make him feel safe. “Thanks.”
,” Lorraine said breathily before a deep breath. “I… I have to go now.”
“I like you,” Harry murmured, taking a step closer.
“Welcome back,” the teacher cooed in a voice that Harry would definitely describe as patronizing. “I hope you all had a nice holiday break, but it’s time to get back to learning.” There wasn’t a single person in the room happy to hear that.
“We can make that work,” Ginny nodded. “Or maybe I should be asking Draco what he prefers, hm?”
“You’re strange, dearest.”
“Wolf-thing,” Draco corrected.
“This all sounds great,” Harry said, eyes scanning for his favorites.
“Did not!”
Draco pulled Harry in by his thin black tie for an appreciative kiss. Everyone clapped.
“They get too clingy. They want me to move in with them and get married,” he joked before moving his finger in a ‘come hither’ motion to feel the stretch. “Can’t take that kind of stuff.”
“She does actually love me and want to be happy,” Draco admitted reluctantly. “We can ease her into the truth of who you are. Still, this means I have to update Theo and Blaise with the same or similar information
“The first boyfriend I had left me and it was so my fault,” Draco asserted.
Giving in to his hormones, Harry put the empty bowl on his wooden dresser and moved his hand under his pajama pants and underwear, jumpstarting his stirring arousal. After all, there was nothing more satisfying than seeing your enemy the morning after you jerked off about them.
Something about Draco telling Harry that made both of their hearts clench tightly in their chests. Harry tried his best to ignore the sensation as he stormed out, and he blamed the wetness on his cheeks on the cold wind.
“Excuse me,” Draco said as his classmates filtered out into the hall. He wasn’t going down the partner rabbit hole without a fight. “I can’t work with Potter. Change my partner.”
“I’m going to be your new mother-in-law. You can call me ‘mum’, if you want.”
The bones fell under the category of terror. A vague, haunting sense that everything around him had been stolen and replaced with identical copies. Just… Slightly off. That’s how the ribcage got to him.
“I am irresistible,” Draco confirmed, wrapping a hand around Harry’s cock and sighing lovingly at it. He moved further down Harry’s body so he could kiss the tip and taste the bead of precome that had gathered there. “Just like you.”
It smelled delicious enough to fool anyone who hadn’t drank this particular mix, but Harry knew all of those wired and sugary flavors packed quite the punch.
Harry blinked a few times in the face of the journalists before his senses returned to him. A lifetime in front of cameras had taught him to look beyond the flashes and upwards at the ceiling, which happened to be decorated with silver and gold streams of garland.
One of my hobbies is making fun of Theodore Nott 24/7, oh man. I hope you guys like him as much as I do. Now let’s get Draco and Harry in the same room again!
“Fuck,” came next from Draco. “Fucking—“
When Theo got close enough to touch his shoulder, his hand missed. It was like his boyfriend was more air than person. “Colin?”
“No! Harry, if you think I want to be living in some group-home with a screaming kid, then you are mistaken. I’m not going to work at McDonald’s to pay for diapers.”
“Yup,” Harry nodded. Draco didn’t even have to finish his sentence for Harry to know what he meant. Their nonverbal communication had improved far beyond what it was during the show, and there were several reasons for that.
Learning of Harry Potter’s homosexuality sorted out a great deal of their childhood looking back, didn’t it? The following, the staring, the verbal spats where they couldn’t stop gazing longingly at each other’s lips—Draco had thought it all to be one-sided but now knew better.
Harry quickly turned back to the mirror as if he’d been fixing his hair instead of snooping when he heard the man zip up his jeans. Those Auror senses of his were going to get Harry clocked one day, he just knew it.
“You didn’t even come here. You were walked here by guards because
“No. No belly-rubs in public.”
Pansy quite appreciated her current nakedness. They’d gotten off from work together, ate dinner, and then gotten off together. It was Pansy’s definition of a fabulous afternoon.
At three-thirty, Ron Weasley and Harry Potter would sit down in the Head Auror’s office and try again anyway. They’d both agreed that bringing it up to Remus was a last resort, and they weren’t that desperate.
Luckily for Draco, Harry hadn’t noticed any of his contemplative facial expressions. Harry had entered the number that they were given for Emmett into a public database and gotten nothing. “Damn.”
. Draco thought that was valuable, and was proud that his Harry did it.
“I thought I was too full to keep eating, but I was so wrong,” Harry sighed happily as he grabbed his fork and dug into the cocoa confection.
Harry pulled down his waistband to reveal Draco Malfoy in all of his naked glory, smiling as Draco stepped out of the pants, too. “Lay down on the table,” Harry instructed and watched as Draco did so with no hesitation.
“You better not—don’t you ever underestimate how creative I can be to make the punishment fit the crime,” Draco growled, thrusting forward at a brutal pace to savage Harry’s hole and sate his own need for friction. He could give a damn about Harry’s cock at the moment, throbbing and leaking everywhere, for Draco had not yet given him permission to come and wouldn’t be touching him there until he did.
“Yes, mother?” Draco huffed as if this had happened to him a million times before.
The crowd went nuts for that one. Hoots and hollers echoed through the studio and made Draco and Harry’s Southern Belle blush.
At least that was how Draco Malfoy saw it coming up the neat, trim lawn of Pansy Parkinson’s London townhouse. Worse than mocking him Draco feared that his friends might just not believe him, might think his truth was a joke in bad taste.
“No,” she sighed, embarrassed by her son’s behavior. “We keep telling him how unhealthy it is, and we can usually get the objects out ourselves, but the problem today is that the elephant has quite a pointy tail, as you can see. I didn’t want anything that wasn’t supposed to get pricked get pricked.”
She gave a wonderful response to every wonderfully-crafted question, much to his distaste. He could see how Grace bloody Burbage was growing on his husband.
“Do you think I want this getting out?” Harry replied in a laugh. “I have to make you swear the same thing, too, Draco.” Harry had been calling Draco by his first name in his head for a long time now in the agonizing years and therapy sessions he spent dissecting his youth—was he still ‘Potter’ to Draco? Maybe this was all in his head.
On his way into the employee locker room that connected him to the owl perch where a woman neatly sorted the mail by Healer’s name, Draco was accosted once more.
It all reminded Harry of Ron and Hermione. The quiet laughs, the lip-biting, the leaving Harry alone to go somewhere private… It was horrifyingly couple-y. “If I ever get like that, shoot me,” he grumbled to himself.
The path of small stones leading up to the front door crunched under their feet. “Clearly it needs a lot of work,” Draco prefaced, a bit embarrassed at the state of it. He had spent so much time pursuing his career that the house wasn’t nearly as done as he’d have liked it to be ten years into the project.
“Oh, I know,” said Harry, understanding his every meaning. “But to share a life with you is worth all the madness and more.”
“But I think,” Draco said, thumbing his teacup. “I have to apologize to you. I’m sorry, Luna. For everything I did when we were younger.” The vitriol he’d spewed into everyone’s lives at that age was immeasurable, and he was sure Luna had less-than-pleasant memories of her forced stay in the Manor basement. He wondered if he should let her know he’d torn the place down.
“I am so happy that you have that,” Narcissa urged. “We both are. Aren’t we, Lucius?”
“We could take him down,” Draco confirmed, a new fire stoked in his gut thinking of something Pye had said before about photos. “And I know just how to entrap him.”
“That’s a kind word for it,” Draco nodded.
“Dunno. Some expert in breaking home protection wards from the Ministry,” Aiden said. He’d picked up that much gossip on the train ride over. “Not sure what her name is, though.”
Draco moaned, hands flying to grasp at Harry’s hair and push him down.
“Hm?”
Draco huffed, nearly out of breath from how hard he was giving it to Harry. “Yes, hold off on it,” Draco encouraged, edging Harry into oblivion with his full palm now. “Not yet, not yet…”
“We’re happy to help,” Harry nodded, holding his camera steady on the computer screen while someone from the crew got his and Draco’s reactions. “We’ll find who Vera is and get her to stop.”
Maggie laughed and gave her girlfriend’s shoulder a little nudge. “D’you think Pye is any more interesting when he lights up?” she asked with her teeth looking positively sharp when she grinned.
“Yes,” Draco hissed, sounding almost like a Parselmouth. Harry wondered briefly how Draco might react if he started to speak in Parseltongue, a vestige left over from the Horcrux, but decided against it when he saw how peaceful Draco looked on top of him. No need to make him think of that duel Harry turned his snake away in.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hips, fully sheathed inside of him as Draco covered his hands with his own, their fingers intertwining.
Silence lingered between them once more, and Draco could hear his own heartbeat in his ears with how close to the wire this might be on time. The courses were coming out at acceptable speeds, ice cream scoops next. It was hard to speak with mouths so full so they went quiet once more.
“Yes, thank you,” Harry requested quietly.
Draco’s face went bright red and then the laughter came. He sighed, taking it with a stiff upper lip and an arched brow.
“That’s because you were an annoying twat back then,” he defended. “But you thankfully grew up. It’s not my fault you matured faster than some knocked-up schoolgirl.”
“No,” Draco laughed as he hushed Blaise. There were certain things that had to stay between Slytherins. “He does not want to hear that, and he is taking me to bed.”
“Most likely,” Kingsley admitted before adjusting his royal blue robes. Suddenly, he had the urge to lock himself in his office for a few hours or a few days. “But it’s still unsolved, and we have a surplus of the bastards to interrogate in custody.”
Draco laughed. To his mother standing in the hall of Draco’s room it was sort of a sad laugh, the kind where nobody else was laughing in return. Just her Draco and a screen.
Harry kept the arch in his back when he gripped the side, sticking his arse up just above the level of the water. He looked over his shoulder and shook his hips enticingly, earning him a few more pinches for his impatience. He took each one with a happy mewl.
With a grin Draco pushed the digits in deeper, feeling the velvety inside of Harry’s cheek with his fingertips. “Now open.”
There were too many players (eleven million, actually) for there to be one central server, so there were hundreds. Each with its own strange quirks, like entering that server was playing in an entirely different game. They were all also named after items, people, or locations in the game. Dragonblight was full of assholes, Sporregar was full of freaks, Deathwing was full of new players, and Proudmoore was full of homos.
They were all a bit like war flashbacks in Draco’s head. Too many weird things had happened to him and his grade for younger students to disrespect his seniority.
Oh, that would take years to scrub out of Harry’s memory. “That’s what I thought! Moving on…”
That was the reason Draco had betrayed them, wasn’t it?
“Right, Draco is your first scene partner. Ah, I remember my first,” Ginny recalled fondly. “I was so nervous to voice what I really wanted, and it was over way too fast.”
“You are so full of it. You get to decide who’s a ‘decent person’ now? Would you have let me talk about fucking you if you didn’t think I was a decent person back a couple nights ago?” Draco demanded.
“Any time. Now, I never think I got her name or yours…?”
“I’m not living for him!” Harry shook his head. “He didn’t, I dunno, save me or anything as cliché as that. He’s helping me, helping me see why I shouldn’t live for anyone but myself. To pursue my actual desires. I’m living for me now, Ron, and I’m living here.”
Much like Harry, Remus didn’t have a blessed clue about the begonias. Neither did Sirius, McGonagall, or the twelve other professors Auror Weasley showed the note to. According to Sprout, the grounds didn’t even have begonias in them and they were unlikely to grow in the Forbidden Forest.
Harry’s interest in him made the eleven year-old boy in Draco go absolutely googly-eyed. He was reining in the desire for sappy looks as an adult now, but only just barely. “Of course, you can ask me anything you like.”
“Of course I am proud of Draco,” Lucius huffed, setting down his tea and crossing his arms. “He is my only child, and a brilliant one at that. I simply… struggle with the choices he makes sometimes.”
“Please let me come,” Harry begged through the pressure. “Oh, please, Daddy.” He’d been hard since Draco had used his throat, and every second in his lap drove Harry further and further away from any semblance of control.
With shaving cream still covering half of his chin Harry sprinted naked to his room, the fastest he’d moved to do anything in ages. “Yes!” Harry exclaimed to see the black device printing away. It sort of looked like a muggle printer, really.
. I can’t put Draco through the ringer on this issue, too. Sometimes, when you see those signs that the church people hold, even though you know everything they’re saying is wrong and narrow-minded, it gets to you. They become a blob.
“Wait—Think about it. Lily Narcissa Malfoy-Potter,” Harry insisted, sitting on the edge of Draco’s couch.
“But I’m not,” Harry said, resolute. “I’m not killing myself, Ron. I don’t think I quite want to anymore, and that’s not because I’m magically better—“ Harry looked to Draco, breath catching in his throat. “It’s because I got my rut—I got pulled out, really.” He looked down at Draco’s feet with a little laugh.
“He,” Draco started to his parents who amidst his thinking were waiting with baited breath. “Is. Someone who is good to me and good for me. He is someone who makes me happy, and yes, I… feel strongly about it.” Why deny it any longer? He’d been found out. “He lives in the Manor with me, he helps me build it… And his name is Harry Potter.”
First up on their agenda was picking another Catfish case to pursue.
