wants to be for too long. And as he reached the lifts, Harry noticed an old man with a heavy gaze on him, eyes looking at him cautiously.
They talked. Talk about school differences, magical education, the Ministry… It was very nice, nothing remotely sexy or flirty about it. He wasn’t even sure if Neville lied about Marcus being gay because they were
“That’s not what we’re doing right now.”
Was Harry so drunk that he invited Malfoy to his house? And to do what? To have a quick shag with the enemy?
“I work with him, and he’s my friend.” Hermione crossed her shoulders in her chest.
It was a bad idea.
Harry opened his mouth to talk but then close it. Draco was blushing slightly, looking down at his fingers.
And Harry did. He kissed him slowly. Placing both of his hands around Draco’s cold cheeks, holding him close, trying to make sure Draco stood there for him and melted to Harry’s embrace.
When Draco finished, he put the comb down somewhere in the bed, and kissed Harry’s cheek from behind. The air felt strange. They really flipped from yelling to grooming in a matter of minutes. “Done, love.”
, don’t kill my boner.”
. We had a choice. It’s sorrowful to know we didn’t take it.
“Whatever!” Ginny dismissed him. “Time to pick.”
he would tell himself before going to sleep, knowing that he had to wake up the next day to do the exact same thing.
And whatever Draco wanted wasn’t enough anymore. It was never going to be enough. The minute he had kissed Draco for the first time on Hermione’s birthday, he should have known that it simply wouldn’t.
Harry did so. He mimicked her posture, taking his socks off and pressing his foot on the fresh grass, feeling the texture of the lawn beneath him.
Hermione huffed, rolled her eyes and poured more orange juice into her glass.
“Well,” Hermione began, “The last time you started your quest, it all ended in just casual sex, so--”
“Morning, you’re late.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “I’m going to sleep. I was really hoping you would give me a more insightful answer.”
“Oh,” Harry widened his eyes.
Draco left a gentle kiss on his lips as he took Harry’s gift in his hands. Unwrapping it slowly, as if he knew it, made Harry miserable and simply enjoyed killing him.
“This tea is absolutely disgusting, Harry,” Draco told him one morning when their breakfast became routinely and not a once in a while thing.
After that, it only took them a shot of firewhisky on their system and the summoning of a white chart (which Harry had
And then what happened next became a blur in Harry’s memory.

Harry's voice was cold. But Mr

But then he said, in a whisper, “I want you too. I want you since forever.”
- It had been a good and unusual year.
And then, he couldn’t get it out of his mind.
But right there, while surrounded by couples (okay, maybe only one and a half) and after his last night realizations, it felt like the most brilliant idea to announce.
“It looks amazing, by the way,” Draco finally said. “Not surprised by Antoniette skills, of course, but I think this time she did absolutely fantastic--”
Harry felt dazed. If he waited any longer, he might come without wanting to. So with a swift move, he lined his cock to Draco’s arsehole, and without more preamble, gave the first push. Filling him slowly, at first impossibly tight, but then allowing Harry to move forward.
“I don’t think Flinch is dead.” Neville muffled, mouth filled by a handful of crisps.
“I can’t believe you got a haircut,” Draco said softly, almost a whisper, only for Harry to hear.
“Apologising,” Malfoy said and locked his eyes with Harry’s. Grey eyes, almost too dark. A steady look, without hesitation in it. “I’m just doing that.”
“What about Draco?” Blaise asked.
“Blaise Zabini,” She blurted. “Friends with Malfoy, I know….”
“Where’s your husband? He needs to calm you down.”
But then he said, “I want to have dinner here.”
He had only taken it off once. After the war was over when there was nothing but hate towards his past and his ancestry. When he had wished on his bed to be a completely different person, from a completely different family.
“That night...He said things...”
“Which one has the food poisoning for Mr Abbort?” Harry whispered to Draco’s ear when they both stood close, drinks on their hands, guests starting to arrive.
And Draco felt his body clenching as the orgasm grew inside his body. As the shivers and the burning sensation covered him all over.
“Mrs Malfoy probably doesn’t know.” Harry tried a weak smile. His mind was fogging; he could
But then, it wasn’t only Hermione who was talking about him.
to see him doing that. He was looking so beautiful under him, naked on his back, all flushed, with his curls brushing the pillow and the sweat making them stick to his forehead.
He felt his body clenching with pleasure.
With a small gag, Harry pushed his mouth away, seeking for a breath, “Yeah,
“Kinda, but you usually do the same with the Manor.”
“Yes. Can you drop the
Harry’s mind fogged, memories flying as he shut his eyes, remembering Draco. Draco, during those first birthday parties, nodding at conversation, wanting to help, only agreeing to everyone’s point of view because he wanted to be good in other people eyes.
Harry understood the whole Malfoy thing worked solely because it gave him consistency. Then, with their small morning conversations, Harry allowed himself to notice things about him. Like the way he liked to be touch, or the way he liked to be kissed. He noticed Draco craved for slow unhurried kisses instead of the hard ones Harry usually gave. It was during nights in which Draco fell on his back, fingers tangled in Harry’s hair, when he noticed Draco’s tongue on him trying to slow the pace, his mouth making an effort to change Harry’s rhythm. And Harry simply followed.
However, he wasn’t able to hide his smile, and when he looked up from his teacup to meet Mrs Malfoy, he noticed a caring gaze looking at him. A fond smile that Harry knew too well from seeing it in his son’s expression. He could catch the sadness that swung in it.
Draco never made their breakfast. It was usually Harry who always groaned in the mornings, who yelled at him for waking up early, yet stopped Draco from getting out of bed. He always repeated:
So, certainly, his quest could end in shitty dates and making other people feel bad; but the reality was that it wasn’t his intention. It never was. Harry
It didn’t take more than a couple of seconds for Draco to feel familiar with the sensation. He squeezed Harry’s arm, letting him know wordlessly he could continue.
“Hi, Rosie. Err…I don’t.” Harry said politely. Lately, he had grown used to strangers trying to make conversation with him. However, it still made him uncomfortable, no matter what. “He’s single if you were wondering.”
“Biggest mistake of my life, I understand, believe me.” Draco interrupted, holding his hands to the air, exasperated. “Now, can we go back to the agreement of never speaking about it again?”
“You look fine,” Draco said. He wasn’t looking just
“Yes, yes, he told me that too. But he was so drunk, Harry. He was so embarrassed and--
him. He needed to touch him, to hug him. But Draco felt cold and distant, and Harry needed to melt it all down first. “I didn’t know your mother knew about us.”
So in order for him to properly flirt with a man, he needed to be plastered on alcohol, or perhaps like it had been with Draco, overcome by one particular emotion, making it for him too blurry to separate. His first months hanging out with Draco were a combination of both; drunkenness of birthday parties and hating him for being so damn attractive.
Harry knew it wasn’t going to be easy even before he started. So why was he so disappointed? Why did he felt the ache on his stomach crawling him every night after coming back from another plain and boring date?
“Are you oka–?”
“I don’t
And then Harry felt brave. As if he could do much more than just
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but Blaise quickly interrupted, “Maybe fight somewhere else?
“You can stay for dinner. If you want.”
Maybe.
“You’ve gotten a

, probably trying to clean the errors of their past actions. He talked with Malfoy once or twice in the halls of the Ministry, when it was all paperwork, trials, and the Ministry trying to fix the fiasco they made in the past. They had exchanged some cold hello’s, avoiding at all cost eye contact. It happened while Harry was living his worse, and by the look of Malfoy’s expressions (Harry dared to look at him when he knew he wasn’t going to get caught), he was not in a much better place than him.
Maybe he tried. Harry couldn’t be sure because he was trying his hardest to avoid him. Each time their eyes met for a second -because, well, Harry was all the time looking– he would quickly brush it off changing his sight to somewhere else. And by the time Malfoy made a move to leave the party, Harry ran to the loo the minute he saw him giving the first goodbye.
But how could he tell Harry that?
“I didn’t know you had a boyfriend,” Harry heard from behind.
“Piss off, Ron! He’s doing it! He did step one, now he’s going to move into a friendship with you and–-”
than seeing Draco after he came, naked and vulnerable, red face and those eyes…those eyes shining from the glow post his orgasm. Harry wondered if Draco saw the same on him.

He then shook his head and turned back to the mirror, “Like I was saying…I don’t want to look
Harry noticed something in Zabini shifted; a look, a glance to somewhere else in the room. And before Harry could put a finger on it, he asked them to excuse him.
“I want to have kids one day,” Harry huffed and took another bite of his blueberry muffin. The morning was surprisingly warm, and they were enjoying their breakfast in the garden.
It was pure annoyance and angriness that Harry didn’t seem to be able to put away just by mumbling insults or heavy complaints. And everyone around him was pretty much tired of it.
“Please, I don’t care.” Draco interrupted, looking away. His pale face was covered in red patches. Harry knew if he touched them, they would probably burn.
As expected, he pushed his feelings away instead of confronting them. He told himself it was because he never dated someone before.
And Luna wasn’t wrong, Draco’s ring made him look much more sophisticated.
It also meant he had to actually start dating.
“Let me try one, just to see!”
obsessing with the idea of knowing what he was up to every second. Being right at the end and also being wrong in so many other ways.
“I’ve been worse...And I’ve been much better.”
“Yes, Seven Floor.” The drinks displayed themselves in front of them. The familiar scent and the dark purple colour warmed Harry. “Department of Magical Education, we worked next to Ms McCormack.”
And Malfoy was once again Apparating to Grimmauld Place with Harry on his side.
“Err, didn’t he date Parkinson?”
. He didn’t want the blank and hollow space on his heart now that the adrenaline of his previous years disappeared.
Harry was eager to please him, to Draco’s luck and misery.

Harry then notice a strong burgundy coloured mark on the back of his hands. It looked like a bad burn. “What’s that?” He said as he brushed the pad of a finger lightly over it.
So he gave him a nod, and Harry moved to sit on the edge of the bed. Draco sat behind him, legs on each side of his thighs, and grabbed the plastic comb out of Harry’s hand.
and the fact that he already knew he was gay.
“Mione is the observant of the relationship,” Ron winked, “Looks good.”
getting through that door wearing his family ring. No. So the best thing Draco could do was to please him, wait till he gets all soft, and then hexed it out of him before his date.
He was irritated, annoyed, and fucking angry at Malfoy for serving him two Whatever Flowers. And somehow horny, because Malfoy was not bad looking after all. The idea of touching him, of breaking his elegant posture, making his rigid aspect a mess, and to untie his clothes, was just…
“She is. You two worked together?”
“Maybe you could try dating man?” Neville suggested. “All your last dates had been girls.”
Ron had caught him trying to Disapparate, had given him a knowing look and then proceeded to yell
stupid for doing it in the first place. And because he was doomed. Doomed and cursed for the rest of his life. Maybe Harry had fucked him so much that Draco had lost the ability to get turned on by others. Maybe Draco needed to learn an effective way of pushing all his feelings aside until they disappear completely.
“I—” Draco stuttered, “I guess I’m—”
“Why?” Harry huffed, “To fail and to suffer miserably because no one seems to fit me?”
“No, you don’t get it.” Harry shook his head.
“In all honesty!” Ginny started. Raising her drink, calling everyone’s attention, even those from strangers at the bar. “Tell us, please…was it good?”
Did she know his son spend at least one night of the week at his house? Did she know Harry makes Draco’s breakfast and that he liked buying him tea because he hated the one Harry used to have? Did she know that Harry, over the past year, had learned little things about Draco? Things that not every

on time.”
But Draco wasn’t talking nor nodding, not even paying attention to their conversation because his eyes were entirely over Harry’s. To Harry on the bar, next to Marcus, with two almost empty Midnight Flowers between them.
The year after the war ended, when he was sent to a mind healer, he learned something. It was small. But it stood with him ever since he heard it.
It started with Malfoy’s posture shifting once again, and a soft smiled forming on his lips. He talked more; he offered Harry a new drink, made some jokes in the way. And then...both of them were Disapparating to Grimmauld Place alone.
Without being able to think it -to fully process it, he was involved in their conversation. With a quiet Malfoy next to him and a loud Blaise trying to keep the conversation from ending. At first, Harry tried to act cold,
And there he was, greeted by Narcissa Malfoy on a bright Sunday afternoon to the Manor. She was waiting for Harry in a flourishing garden; tinted with magical plants in every corner, shining with the calming weather. It was too beautiful, and it seemed that Mrs Malfoy knew the charming effect it had on people because she carried a soft proud look in her eyes.
“Don’t pretend to be asleep to skip your date.”
In the dream, they were back in Sixth Year, Dumbledore alive in the Astronomy Tower repeating the words that somehow Harry never forgot:
But Harry never listened, and he was too busy examining Draco’s outfit anyway, “Your rings! That’s it. Give me one.”
“I made
“I don’t like when you say that.” Harry said, frowning, “Sexual life…As if I’m only that to you.”
“It was bad,” Harry simply said, downing the last of his beer. “Really, really bad.”
“Potter, Weasley… please leave the papers in my office.” Camil announced to them, stepping out of the lift, “Then, you would be ready to leave for today.”
“You never know….”
“You’d to know it.”
. Yes, life will forever be something that happened around him, but he was trying to catch up on it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t as careful with Draco’s clothes. He never was; no matter how many times Draco insisted that his were pristine and should be treated with care.
Malfoy, with a raised eyebrow, said, “You were laughing alone in there?”

for anything he needed.
“Yes, please.”
Another sip.
Draco thought.
“Why do you agree all the time?!” Harry had irritably asked once. They were inside one of the stalls of The Leaky’s bathroom. He was kissing Malfoy’s neck harshly, wanting to leave a mark so badly.
Harry smiled at her, “The bar was amazing.”
But the worse part (and the one he needed to deal with so he could finally let the memory sank in the deeps of his subconscious), was the regular Saturday meeting with his friends.
“Then, we'll shag and go to sleep.”
acting like a couple, kissing and touching blandly.
But…what was he supposed to do?
“It was great,” Seamus said. “Harry confessed he would marry Dumbledore and all.”
But then, something shifted. After one morning, when Draco dryly asked him, “Do you like this? What we do, I mean.”
“I don’t want to know more about this,” Harry stood up. It was better this way. They wouldn’t understand; they never did. They always thought that Harry was childish and obsessive when it came to Malfoy. It was Sixth Year repenting itself all over again. “Let’s continued before everyone arrives.”
But before Harry really could think about it, he was being dragged by Draco to a small hall. He opened a new door and then pushed him inside the bathroom.
Harry answered instantaneously; with a hard moan, he opened his mouth fully to let Draco fuck it. Letting him slide inside of him, hot and heavy. Pulling in and out until he found a sweet rhythm.
Ginny laughed hysterically next to Seamus and Dean, and Harry felt dizzy with bliss. Except that he couldn’t ignore one particular disapproving look on the room.
For a while, the game kept like that, with funny and witty combinations that made everyone laugh till crying. Then, as it also did last time, it shifted into a more personal and more realistic type of game. It was better to do it like this, when everyone felt relax and with more drinks on their system. “Ginny, your turn!” Dean started, “

As expected, Harry was the last one to arrive. But everyone in the room knew him too well to expect otherwise. Hermione and Ron were unpacking
But Luna didn’t talk, didn’t intervene. Instead, she stood silent, waiting for Harry’s following words.
This one could be on the list.
Harry nodded but his gaze looked apologetic.
Tonight it was Grimmauld Place. Every Saturday, because no one had work to do the next day, they picked a place to crash on. Grimmauld Place some nights, The Leaky Cauldron others, and maybe (if Hermione was persuaded) Ron and Hermione’s cottage.
And, for Harry’s disbelief, the rest of their night consisted of talking about Blaise Zabini.

With his free hand, Harry cupped Draco’s arse harshly.

“Loverboy is here!” Seamus’s voice overran him.
Harry gave him a funny look. As if there was something so comical in this whole horrific,
“Mr Malfoy. It is clear, Mr Potter, that no one wants him here. The problem is that he hasn’t done anything for us to get rid of him.” He let out a snort as if he was telling a joke to an old friend. “So…don’t doubt telling us any issue.”
. Oh, it had destroyed everything in me to see him suffering the consequences of his family decisions.”
“Should we have another glass?” He tried, looking at his empty glass. “Is three too much?”
someone from the Ministry?”
Draco touched Harry’s ring, rolled it slowly. Kissing it as if that ring had always been there, on Harry’s hand since the beginning. Harry pushed his index into Draco’s mouth, making him suck it. Licking it, making movements with his tongue around his skin and the silver.
The lift opened in front of them, but neither stepped a foot into it.
“I hope you didn’t use that language in front of my mother,” Draco said with a raised eyebrow. “May I ask you why you are sitting in this garden drinking tea with her?”
He used to ignore Harry. Not because he wasn’t interested in him, but because Harry resembled his worst fear; he was the living picture (according to the

in India and how he was recently learning a lot about Herbology. Neville, big-hearted, recommended him books and shared his notes. And just like that, they began owling each other with book recommendations and who knew what else.
“Harry-yy!” Ginny’s euphoric laugh from the couch called him. “Bring me some…and also, let’s play!”
. Draco wanted to relax his neck into the pillow, to look at the ceiling as he enjoyed the sensation of Harry warm fingers inside him.
“You think so?”
In the weeks that followed, Harry couldn’t keep himself far from Draco. He had asked him to stay at Grimmauld with him.
Harry wondered how much Narcissa knew.
After a hard month of effort, Hermione had charmed the wooden bar so drinks would float and create themselves with the perfect amount of ingredients.
“Wha—I’m not. Keep moving,” He replied breathlessly, still pressing his hands onto Harry’s arse to
“I don’t know.” Harry shrugged, nervously tapping his glass. “Maybe? I don’t know.”
“Harry!” Neville said, coming close to him, the smell of Firewhisky clearly impregnated on him. “I have someone! I bloke for you to date!”
Harry really wanted those fingers everywhere around him. The metal of his rings over his skin, the icy feeling of the first touch.
“I forgot you had no taste.” Draco scoffed but still shared him a sleepy smile. “Anyway, I’ll only move out from The Manor if it’s to a house in
Harry craved making a comment. To tell Ron something witty or to get angry at him for believing Hermione’s words in the first place. But there was something in his stomach, anchoring him to the chair. Curiosity, maybe.
“Not like that.” Narcissa let a soft laugh. She suddenly looked younger. “Not
“You have finally lost it,” Draco said in disbelief, meeting Harry’s eyes for any sign of mockery. There wasn’t any. “Harry James Potter finally
“You’re not doing it, right?” Harry had asked, knowing the answer already.
Harry was careful with his drink. Malfoy was too. The mocking became something else, and Harry wanted so bad to prove that he was better than
“Do you want him here?”
“Yea, I think I’m going to do that.” Harry started nodding, trying to hide his inside throbbing. “Yea, yea- And if it doesn’t work out then I’ll completely drop this quest.”
A sudden shiver crossed his body.
He would never admit it or say it with actual words; he pretended to be cold or distant about the things that hurt him. But at intimate things like kissing or having sex, it was impossible to keep acting. It was impossible to hide vulnerability. Harry couldn’t complain, not even a little.
“Ginny told me nice things about you.”
“I don’t want to be bad, Harry.” Draco let Harry hugged him, he surrendered to him, allowing vulnerability to come his way, “I don’t want to be bad, I don’t want to—”
“We’ll be fine,” Harry said from his couch, his naked back touching the leather, making him feel so warm that maybe if he closed his eyes just for a minute--
But Draco didn’t smile at that. Instead, he just gazed at Harry intensely, looking startled.
, as they had called it. It was just better to flow with it, laugh with them, and answer their questions.
“Clearly we are not.”
“Why would you do that?”
“He is my friend.”
“I know, but it tastes….”
“Warm and safe,” He concluded days later, in bed, next to Draco, who frowned in response, trying to understand where those last words came from. “The house.” Harry explained, “It needs to be warm and safe. Okay? My only request.”
“I want to blow you.”
“Harry, if you don’t want a drink, it is fine…I’ll leave you alone.”
He knew he was alive, of course.

They fell asleep. Or perhaps they didn’t. But they both closed their eyes for the rest of the night. Until dawn, when a soft voice from Draco’s lips came. Weak and low, and Harry only wanted to kiss it,
A couple of hours later, when everyone was strolling around the room, talking loudly and sharing drinks, Harry allowed himself to get close to Draco. He had tried hard to stay present, to not drag himself to him, to give him the space he
“So it is a no?”
“It has a P,” And Draco finally met Harry’s eyes, a deep grey, “Harry, this is a Potter family ring.”
Before Harry found a way to formulate his feelings, Blaise was around him, with a hold over his shoulders; “Harry! We were talking about Quidditch! You used to be really good at that. What happened?”

“Don’t tell Granger.”
ugly, you know I do. But love is not about that, I would like to think. I don’t think I would be dating Ron if I had made a list.”
“My father,” Draco’s grip on Harry’s shoulders tightened, “When I—” He breathed in, then out. “I got into a fight with my father at fourteen. It was…bad. I said things because I wanted to hurt him somehow. I think-I think I was angry at something, maybe at you and all the attention you were getting for the tournament,” Draco snorted,
“Just fuck me!”
“Don’t come at me pretending I don’t.”
But after that…things slowly grew better.
“Similar interests? I don’t remember Hermione being a former Death Eater.”
Antonietta was surprised to see him alone, without Draco dragging him through the door of the salon. “And your

“It is.”
“Excuse me, Potter? You

It didn’t stop after the war.
“So…” Harry started mid breakfast when he finally felt awake enough to speak. “Was it all okay? Your party, I mean….”
Harry had decided to owl Mrs Malfoy the night before. When the options were short, and realized there was no other way of reaching Draco. He avoided at first because he didn’t know how much she knew about Harry and Draco’s relationship; how unexpected it might have been if he desperately wrote her.
“Not me!” Ron rushed his words. “It’s her! She’s the one that’s insane!”
Too many bad choices for just a night.
“Hey, I forgot to ask.” Harry stepped into the small garden, which had been nicely decorated for his birthday.  “Did the Moonseed Potion get the approval?”
the other week,” Dean said. “Have you seen Celestina’s new hair colour? I swear everyone is going to start having blue hair at Hogwarts now.”
Then he snorted and, shaking his head, he added, “Lovely. Didn’t have time for much tourism. Did you know it’s spring there?”
“Next Quidditch match… Camil on my team, okay?”
“Mrs Malfoy…How’re you?”
peevishness on his voice but still crawling back to bed with a tray of tea. He was always like that. Sulky and temperamental in the mornings (and maybe the rest of the day) but still willing to make him comfortable.
Harry opened his mouth. He wanted to keep the conversation, the inevitable shouting. But, yeah, he was tired too—body sore, muscles weary for the uncomfortable position.

“It’s not like you know him−-I’m mean, yes, you do, but….”
when Harry got on his knees, and he had desperately grabbed the couch to hold his impulses.
Harry,” Draco muttered. Harry noticed exasperation in his voice, “We knew this was going to be over. Your little quest, my inability to date. Come on, it was written in the stars.”
At first, he pushed gently, looking carefully at Draco’s expression. His finger movements
“Sounds expensive,”
“Did you hex him mid-sex?” Ron asked him cheekily. He and Hermione were calmer than the rest about the situation. They weren’t mocking him as much as the rest. Well…Ron was laughing uncontrollably, but at least he was not saying much. Even Luna and Neville were making fun of him, asking him embarrassing questions.
“How was I supposed to know?”
“Well, she doesn’t fuck you, you know,”
“So you are waiting for him to make the talk, basically.”
“Wait, no-” Harry interrupted;
“You promised me.” Draco jumped immediately, the red on his cheeks forming furiously, “You promised me you would never in your life mention it again.”
So Harry pulled off slowly. Getting himself out of Draco, with the head of his cock outside the hole,
“I’d love to do that,” Harry smirked, getting closer and trying to not think about evident looks around them. “It’s fine. I’d worse.”
you ignored me?”
Like the time he let Hermione pick his outfit for that Daily Prophet interview when he was twenty-one. Or maybe the time he had decided to leave Cho Chang alone at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop. Or perhaps every decision he made at fifteen when he was overflowed by anger and felt misunderstood.
“What are you all talking about--?” Hermione started, but Harry glanced at Ron, placing his hand on her thigh, and she stopped mid-sentence.
He was carried through the deep and dark stuff, just as much as he was also carried through simple daily actions; like going to dinner, like not losing touch with his friends, like waking up before midday and not skipping breakfast or any other meal.
He felt a slight burn on his navel.
Heat suddenly invaded Harry's face. He was burning and blushing, and he wanted to hex Malfoy. “I’m drunk, whatever.”
and that
And, of course, because his friends were the way they were;
“What?” Hermione said incredulously. “Why would you leave my birthday party? You want to make me have a full

at me and then proceeds to tell me about his new date.”
Harry wanted to bring all of his flowers from Grimmauld to his new place, but Draco told him plenty of times that ‘It was rude to leave the garden there fully empty’ and that ‘Andromeda and Teddy would take care of it properly.’
“I’ve been yelling at you to get a haircut for months, Potter, and you got it
“Harry,
“You never do,” Harry said, echoing his voice tone. And then said the only thing he knew how to handle with Draco, “But okay, want to kiss me?”
Maybe it was genetics.
What the fuck was he supposed to say.
He left one of the hands that grabbed Draco’s hip and hold his own cock. Letting the tip lingered around his hole, ready to push it all the way in…waiting only for--
“I couldn’t care less about your date.” Draco lied. “Can you
He opened one of the cabinets where he knew Harry kept their tea. It was empty except for one bright orange cardboard box that read;
Because Sirius had given the place to him, and it felt like one of those gifts you hate, but because someone you love gave them to you, you still used them. Like the gifts Arthur gives you at Christmas, horrific and somehow terrifying, but you still used them because you love him.
“Sod off. It’ll only be for an hour or two!” Harry growled. And maybe Draco was too stunned to resist because Harry grabbed his hand and attempted to attack one of his fingers. “The middle one–-no, no, the M one.”
“Oi! I…Yes, sure.”
“It is fantastic. Here, let me,” Harry tapped the wood bar with his wand, thinking about his request. Seconds later, the glasses were floating, enchanting the ingredients Hermione previously bought and store in the bar.
, no!” Ron protested, taking a sip of the Firewhisky from his plastic tumbler, “There must be better games than that.”
“Mr Potter, you know more than us about it.”
“You’re ruining my life, Granger,” Draco had said in response. “If you leave, I’m going to be all alone on the terrifying floor--”
Except that he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He couldn’t stop thinking about what would have happened if Draco decided to stay and Harry got close to him and begged for something. Because, of course, Harry would have asked for something; for a better conversation, for a simple touch of hands while sleeping, for a quick shag somewhere, or for something
“I think they were joking when they said the loo,” Harry muttered.
“You know what I mean,”
Draco was the only one who decided it was better if he left. Harry had the suspicion that left because he could trust himself with spending the night somewhere near him. Or maybe that’s what Harry wanted to think; that Draco was incapable of saying no if he crawled close to him sleepily in the middle of the night.
And right then, he knew Draco needed this. Being softly
don’t date you, rather why
A friend.
He couldn’t escape Dumbledore’s words.
Harry’s name on Mrs Malfoy sounded exactly like his name always sounded in Molly’s voice. Impregnated by motherhood and kindness. Harry let himself revelled in it.
“I don’t want to leave yet.”
He liked doing those things to his friends; he just needed to cross the line for his dating.
No. no.
“I don’t know what to say.”
Their kisses floated and danced from one place to the other. In their lips, their necks, their collarbone. Navel, then thighs. It was hot everywhere, and the slow of their movements help them through their arousal, stopping as soon as they felt too desperate because they didn’t want it to end just yet.
“Come on, Harry,” Hermione said tiredly. “I don’t think it mattered
“Thank Merlin, you’re here!” A new voice joined the conversation, the old Mrs Fawcett. “I need one of you to stay till late today; I’ll go mad if I have to do all this by myself!”
“I’m leaving now, Potter.”
Everyone in the room began supporting Luna, telling her that she should definitely dye her hair. Harry couldn’t agree more. But for some stupid reason, he couldn’t stop ignoring Draco’s presence next to him. It hadn’t been too long since Hermione’s birthday, but it felt like the time passed slowly. He had gotten so used to Draco’s company that every week that passed had meant something.
“Whatever.”
Harry mimicked him. Oh well...they have almost finished anyway. The colours Red, White and Gold covered the entire garden. It was looking lovely, Harry had to admit it.
“You did too.” Draco cut him off. “And I didn’t blame you. The night you talked to me for the first time, I told you I didn’t care that you hated me. Not because I don’t care about other people’s opinion over my life, but because
Harry thought. But how could he explain to Draco he felt too much right now. That if he didn’t fight he might drop confessions senselessly.
“Because you’re the best good person I know.”
Ginny and Blaise broke off; rosy cheeks, clothes shaggy, showing more skin than Harry would have wanted. If it wouldn’t be for his angriness, he might have even found it hot. Ginny was beautiful, and he couldn’t lie, and Blaise…well, Blaise was something else. The air truly smelled like sex.
“It’s okay.” Draco interrupted. Then decided to try; “Dinner is nice.”
Harry had no idea how it all happened.
“Harry, darling!” Hermione smiled at him, warming the atmosphere around Harry’s. “What are you doing here?”
Maybe he did at some point; he couldn’t remember it very well. All the memories of the last months of Sixth Year with Ginny were fogged by Dumbledore’s death, the quest to the Cave, Regulus letter, Snape being the half-blood prince, Malfoy’s frightened face at the Astronomy Tower. If he made a great effort, he could revisit the good times with her; touching her tenderly, kissing her in hallways, having sex for the first time in his life, being self-conscious about his body, and his insecurities being brushed away by Ginny’s touch.
And Harry smiled him back, feeling the pit of his stomach burn heavily, his heart twitching strangely and then…
“I can’t believe it,” Harry growled. They were lazily fixing the garden decorations for Ron’s twenty-four year’s old party. “You invite him here, next you’re gonna talk to him,
And then it was Malfoy’s birthday, and Hermione was invited, and Ron was invited, and Neville was also invited.
Harry thought,
“Yea, I kinda figure out he likes cock.” Harry said wryly. “But that doesn’t mean he couldn’t have been a confused boyfriend.”
, because this time, the Wizarding World realized they shouldn’t have done it in the first place.”
“She would if it wasn’t for the fact that today I told her I wasn’t looking for a relationship.”
Flowers were floating, mixing themselves with an alcohol bottle Harry never saw before. Lime and sugar hybridising with different flowers. A shimmer of glitter running to get into the glass. Harry tried to catch up with the steps, the ingredients. He thought about Draco. Perhaps he could try preparing it at Grimmauld for him or
“Don’t fall asleep.” Draco nagged him as if he had read Harry’s mind. “And please, can you put your clothes on? I don’t want your friends to find you naked the day of your birthday.”
“I want to announce something!”
“Fuck me.” Draco then said. “Come on, I don’t want to retain you much.”
“That one,” Malfoy said after some time, “
Harry looked at her bemused; she was nibbling her lower lip, waiting. And Harry laughed. He laughed because everything seemed like a joke. Once again, the universe was joking with him.
“Why are you acting like this?”
So he worked on his own clothes, pulling them aside, stroking himself with the sticky lube warm from being inside Draco. He didn’t want to look up. He didn’t want to meet Draco’s stern gaze on him. He couldn’t deal with that right now.
“Here?” Draco voice was hoarse. Harry couldn’t really tell if it was a question or a preposition, but muttered a soft
Draco began muttering under his breath that Harry was

laugh. Ron was the absolutely perfect match for Hermione, yet, they had always been opposites since their childhood, and Harry had been present during the entire journey.
“I knew you were putting a trick on me when you invited me for dinner.”
“Yes, I understood the question.” Malfoy’s words were coming out politely, but Harry felt the coldness in them. “Why are you asking?”
“…I once read on
“Wait-” Ron interrupted. “Wait, wait, is that why Draco was furious at you last night?”
“It’s a stupid flowery drink, Draco.”
Draco quirked his mouth, “What then?”
Harry might hate staying till late working for the Ministry, but there was always something in going back to the emptiness of Grimmauld Place, no matter how much he had tried to make that place his home. He felt stupid, hating to go to the Ministry but then hating to come back. Why couldn’t he ever feel normal?
And while Draco thought of what to say next, Harry took the opportunity and brutally stole one of the rings.
“Wha—no no, we are not.”
“Yeah,” Harry simply said, shrugging.
In the end, before they fell asleep, Ginny finished the conversation with something that stood in Harry;
“I asked him”
“Hello,” Harry said to the bore looking woman in the closest desk; at least Harry wasn’t
Draco widened his eyes in surprise.
with contempt. That same man was now breathing heavy, eyes close and body fully delivered. He pushed another finger further into Draco’s arsehole.
“Yes!”
Harry repeated himself.
Draco shook his head and emptied his cup of tea on the sink. Harry yelled at him, and they fought for a solid minute about it.
That made him craved for something that was not coming and made him predispose to accept any offer.
Mrs Malfoy’s letter arrived no more than a couple of hours later, with a time and place to meet, including a dress code (for some strange reason). He was glad he had cut his hair that past week, that he looked tidier than other times, more presentable. Before Apparating in a station close to The Manor, he took the Malfoy ring out of his finger; he wasn’t

thing ever. It made him want to drink more. His glass was empty.
“Well, you stop trying a year ago. You should try again.”
Draco took his forearm out of his face and locked eyes with Harry. His face was all flushed in red. “It was the right place to do it. To prove that I wasn’t bad after all. If they accepted me, if they finally saw through me, maybe it’d mean that I’m not bad after all.”
Harry thought of Hogwarts; he wanted to translate that feeling to the new house. He thought of the Burrow. He even thought of his room at the Dursley’s (not the whole house, just his room), which for him felt like the only safe thing during his childhood and teenage years.
“Please not this game again,” Harry sighed but still showed his grin, feeling the heat of his cheek grow as a result of Luna’s brew.
His silver and black ring with the letter ‘M’ engraved in the middle. The one he wore on his index ever since he turned seventeen, as a gift from his father. It was a tradition for Malfoys to start wearing the family rings when they came of age. It was a tradition from hundreds and hundreds of years for each and one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight Pureblood families to keep and follow.
“No,” Hermione cut them off. “Go yell at the loo or something!”
“Yes, well. My birthday today, but the rest of the year I’m still Hermione’s boyfriend.”
“Oh my
Every single one of those emotions Harry shoved onto their kiss. Draco’s lips were cold but quickly heating up under his. The pace was frantic, possessive and perhaps too hard. Malfoy didn’t seem to care; he was trying to follow Harry’s moves, trying to sync with him.
“It’s Monday.”

She kissed his cheek gently. “A break-up haircut…I read it on
“See, I can.”
“It’s going to be a year since we–-”
With just the thin fabric of their pants in between, Harry didn’t waste more time and pinned Draco over the mattress. He captured his mouth and began kissing him deeply. It made Draco dizzy. The way Harry kissed was all-consuming; he kissed like it was all he needed to do and the rest of the world didn’t matter enough. He deposited all his energy there; the energy of the day, of the week, of the
“Well, of course, it is.”
“Yes, but you also had my cock on your mouth last night.” Harry tried humour; he wanted Draco to genuinely smile at him.
fitted through generations?”
“Draco,” Harry gently said, softening his voice. He tried to catch Draco in his arms, tried to find a way to comfort him. “I like who you are now. But this speech you have…I hate when you do…
He thanked Ginny, with a long sloppy letter that Harry then refused to acknowledge. He also thanked the memories of those who died in the past; he had dreamt with the voice of his parents telling him it was time to get better. Some nights it was his godfather who spoke, and others, it was his old headmaster speaking about how only love will recover the pain.
“What does that supposed to mean?” Draco frowned, but Harry could tell he was trying to cover a smile slowly building on his lips. A part of Harry wished that it meant he was happy to see him. “It’s better than the chaos of Level Two.”

for touch. But Harry was too slow; because he was already coming, completely untouched, with an orgasm that cut him so fast that he could only muffle a hard moan into Draco’s cock.

But he couldn’t. Of
In the end, she made Harry and Ron decorate the garden with a carefully thought step by step guide so they couldn’t make any mistakes. On the other side of the garden, she and Draco worked with the food planning. They ended up calling for Ginny and Blaise because Hermione kept insisting that they would never make it on time, even though they still had three hours till the guest started to arrive.
And then he did. He ran his long fingers over Harry’s hair. It didn’t tangle as it sometimes did with other people; it just flowed, allowing Draco’s finger to cross it. Harry closed his eyes and regretted it immediately because Draco got his hand away as if the hair was suddenly fire.
Harry was standing barefoot over the living sofa. A big grin on his face as he held on his right hand his usual plastic tumbler filled with Witches Brew. He didn’t need a mirror to know his face was a bit sweaty, with his curls sticking in his forehead and a red flush all over from the earlier karaoke.
Hermione made a small movement on her seat in an attempt to join him. But Harry noticed how Ron’s hand dropped on her lap, pausing her. Harry sighed. Was he ever going to find someone that could dim his temper?
Harry gazed down at his outfit. He never gave much attention to his appearance. Months would go by without a proper haircut; he wouldn’t bother with taking care of it, always using the cheapest all-in-one shampoo and conditioner on the market. His outfit choices surrounded a simple concept; being comfortable. So it was during times like this, after a date, that he looked

“You know what?” Harry asked, taking a sip of Draco’s tea. He hated whenever Harry did that.
“Definitely,” Marcus nodded and shifted his body to the wooden bar. “Do you want a drink?”
“Oi! You wound me!”
Irrational, Irrational, Irrational. Draco was acting like Harry

aaaaaaa we reached the end!
“Yes, I do.”
Hermione smiled sleepily. She was probably exhausting from the long month of planning. “Exceed my expectations, definitely. And I think I’m definitely heading for a new department. Mrs Lovellette was drunk on Orange Whisky all night and I
Draco was quiet before Disapparating, and Harry never woke up in a good mood.
“Maybe we could make lists,” Seamus offered, and with a swing of his wand, he poured more witches brew on everyone’s tumbler. “A pros and cons list for The Chosen One’s possible partner.”
But it wasn’t only his obliviousness. They both knew that. Harry simply couldn’t allow himself to think about them.
“What is so funny about it?” Hermione interrupted, “I think Draco it’s a nice person.”
But in reality, he had always relied on gut feelings, in doing whatever he believed the second he felt it, because no one had ever taught him how to deal with it. He didn’t grow up in a house in which emotions were explained, in which his feelings were priorities. And when it was time for him to do so,

“Don’t be an idiot, Draco.” Harry chided. A sharp twinge grew on his stomach. “You’re not your father or--”

Draco’s face was on his neck, leaving warm tears. Harry’s heart sank,
Draco was listening, softly under him. His hand reached to meet their fingers, entangling them.
It was small compared to Grimmauld, and of course, miniature compared to the Malfoy Manor. But it spacious enough for two people.

“You are, love.” She affirmed with a wide grin on her face. “She plays Quidditch, by the way. So you already have a topic for your date!”

There were degrees of emotions inside people; primary and secondary emotions. The primary emotions were the ones that we genuinely feel, that we sense in our core. And once we exteriorise them, we feel calmer. As if we are free of them. Then, we have the secondaries. The emotions that we
“So… you’re basically copying my dream. That’s called plagiarism.”
“Please,” Draco whispered and let his weight fall against the kitchen counter; he kept his eyes close as if he was trying to hold something back. “I don’t want to talk about this.
“I think I’d like to have blue hair sometime,” Luna said. “Wouldn’t it be lovely?”
So he allowed himself to open (only for some time) a place to think about his relationship with Draco. It wasn’t the first time, neither would be his last. But somehow, this time, it was

And then…the consequences. It was interesting, to be brutally honest. To say the first thing that comes to mind, feeling right for a split second, and then the next, you realized you might have crossed a line.
“We never do that on weekdays.”
“Trying to make an impression.” Harry shrugged. He stood up, moving closer to Draco,

Draco had said on his ears when Harry cried out for
“Buenos Aires, I know.” His attempt with the Spanish accent was the least arousing thing in the world, not at all as Draco’s had been.
“Okay, I was just--”
It wasn’t a big change. Antonietta, of course, tried to trim his hair, get him a
Harry wanted to say that in his defence, Ginny and Blaise were eagerly doing it openly in the kitchen, but he didn’t think Ron would appreciate the knowledge.
“I’m going to get a drink,” He announced, getting on his feet. “So you can whisper about the pandemonium that is my life while I’m gone.”
He had only told Harry once that he preferred that specific tea over a fight almost a year ago. Ever since then, he bought the same teabags for him to drink in the mornings. Draco smiled softly. He could imagine Harry on a supermarket aisle, looking for different kinds of tea, trying to remember Draco’s words. Buying it and rebuying it every time they run out of it.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry muttered and did what he truly wanted to be doing instead of fighting.
Harry blamed Ginny for having a new boyfriend. He blamed Ron and Hermione for being perfect for each other since childhood. Blamed Seamus and Dean. And the fucking Magical Violets at his feet. He blamed his following actions on being so angry at Malfoy for laughing, for talking, and for persuading him to invite him here, at his place, at Sirius’s old home.
he had only drifted for maybe two seconds. “I was asking you about your date.”
“We’re here to help, Mione.” Harry softened. He would never understand the way Hermione panicked over little details, but the least he could do was help her load the weight on her shoulders. “What should we do?”
It was so intoxicating that Draco felt hopeless, not being able to do more than tangling his fingers into Harry’s hair and tried to follow his pace.
“...You know why I sent Miss Granger the letter that day?” She asked him, and Harry just shook his head in response. “Not because of the obvious reason, but because I wanted Draco to be with people her kind.”
And she did it.
“Err…Well yeah, she always--she is very nice to me.”
He could easily add everything that happened since he saw Malfoy laughing at the bar and how he confronted the situation because he had no control over his anger issues and heavy impulse.
But behind Hermione’s concerned looks and worried lip, there was a non-spoken conversation that Harry knew too well by now. She was right. Of course, she was;
The minute Harry finished dressing up, he saw himself in the mirror, and he felt like an idiot. He had the hasty impulse of getting a haircut when he woke that morning. It had been three months since he last got a pair of scissors close to his hair, and he decided that

.  The day was grey, but the smile on his friend’s face was showing a completely different weather.
“Fuck,” Draco whimpered, and Harry continued in a faster rhythm, pressing his lips hard as he sucked in and out, making everything messier and wetter.
“Sounds like a nightmare.”
On the other hand, he was now more eager to try dating men.
. And I know you don’t love this quest. And I know you love what you have with Draco. And it’s okay if love is terrifying, sometimes it is like that. It doesn’t mean that’s wrong, it’s just a feeling humans fall into because it’s hard to allow vulnerability. But it’ll be fine.”
.” Ron finished. “All Hermione’s words, obviously.”
“Potter,” Draco said.
Harry’s hands felt sweaty, uncomfortably moving on each side of his body. He definitely needed a drink. Harry gazed at…was his name Marcus?
Harry had tried to flirt or something. And did Marcus too. But the conversation would shift once again to something too serious and boring for a Friday night.
“I do remember Hermione working next to someone similar our age,” Harry tried to pick his memories back. It was so long ago. Not necessarily in years, but for Harry it felt like a lifetime. Was he dating Ginny back then? No, that was probably after. “Did you study at Hogwarts?”
“Because I’m the Chosen One?” Harry mocked sleepily, tempting the new atmosphere.
” Draco said wryly. “If you actually liked her, you’d have gotten a haircut. Honestly, Harry, it’s getting out of hand.”
“And then what?”
“Happy birthday, Zabini.” Harry smiled. As he got close to hug Blaise, he noticed a new pair of eyes looking at him. Draco was closing the door behind them with another cardboard box in his hands.
But right now, it didn’t matter if he knew that he was angry just because he didn’t want to be sad, because he needed

and then fell into a deep sleep next to him.
“I –- Let’s drop this, Harry. I’m tired.”
“Well, now that you mention the whole pros and cons list, I guess it’s because of that…I have too many cons.”
Pansy had said to him after he put an end to it. After apologizing and feeling like a horrible person for dating her in the first place.
And then, Harry thought about Luna. Their night conversation, the way she told Harry that love was about being vulnerable. That was terrifying but also
“Do you remember that stupid quote that says something like
And Draco was making everything too hard for him.
Later that week, he had stupidly felt better on Harry’s bed. After having begged Harry to touch him everywhere because he needed his skin to be impregnated on him and take away any old memory of his body.
A part of him wanted to keep fighting with Draco because if they did it, if they continued, it would mean that at some point, they dropped it and go back to normal. Right?
“How are you?” Harry said, “And why the
When he opened the door to return to the garden, he saw Malfoy resting on the wall in front of him, coat on his hands, ready to leave as he was supposed to. Their eyes met for the first time in a distance that wasn’t too far.
“Draco doesn’t want to date.” He blurted.
“I noticed earlier you were wearing the Malfoy ring.” Marcus pointed Harry’s hands.
had much clue on how things happened.
“You got a haircut.” He then said, with the same gaze Harry expected. Draco’s evident amazement showed in his grey eyes, looking at Harry’s hair intensely as if he was trying hard not to card his fingers through it. Harry felt a sudden burn in the back of his neck.
Malfoy quoted quietly, still looking down, gazing at every corner. “That’s something my mother says.”
And somehow, it all ended on Draco sitting on Harry’s bed, not because they were having incredible sex, but because he was helping Harry to get dressed for his date.

“I didn’t. Wanna know why I knew you’d show up tonight? Why I didn’t travel all the way to Argentina to hex you?”
He blushed with embarrassment harshly. What would be Malfoy’s reaction be if they said these things to him instead of Harry? Would he hex them right away without making a threat first? Should Harry do that instead?
And Malfoy
“Obviously.”
“Talk to him on the lift.”
So it wasn't the same, but Harry still had colourful flowers blooming around his feet, the way he always liked.
not saying a word. Just nodding, laughing and asking short questions to keep the conversation going.
Harry could hear while he recovered from the shuttered sensation of his, letting his head rest on one of Draco’s burning hot thigh.
“Thank you,”
“Hmm, did we went to the same school or–?”
There was something magnetic in the way Harry looked, and he didn’t even
Harry said at the door, but Draco simply gave him a warm smile and rolled his eyes in goodbye.

and so…amenable.
“Like what?”
“Unfortunately for her, yes. She lived here for a year or so, can’t remember.”
Her expression softened. And with a caring smile said, “Of course, Harry.”
Hermione smiled, “What were you expecting?”
Harry didn’t want to go back to the party either, and he could only think about his soft mattress waiting for him at Grimmauld Place.
“No, I study at Beubatonx. It was a very lovely school, honestly.”
with it. After a year of doing whatever the hell they had been doing, they both compromised on that word.
They took the floo and left Ginny and Harry alone. Ginny’s place was lovely, far away from the mess of the city, soothing noises filling the space around them. There was something charming about it, but Harry couldn’t deny his love for the city; he cherished the noise of busy streets, of people moving around him at all times. Here, everything felt extremely relaxing and
“And you still like it there? Draco, what the
“I definitely know that.”
Malfoy laughed. And this time, there were no background noises from the bar, no loud music or heavy talking from around. It was just Draco laughing, and the serenity from the garden.
He was drunk and shaky and a fucking mess, but he felt the electricity of his orgasm hitting him in the

“Yeah, I think. My head hurts from all the mocking.”
“He is not my--not yet, anyway,” She blushed. Then took a breath in and then out. Attempting (and failing) to control herself. “I need this to be perfect,
“I have it on my head like the lyrics of a song. A horrific song that you can’t stop humming no matter how much you tried to get it out of your head.” The tears still fell slowly over his cheeks. He didn’t brush them away. “He told me I wasn’t bad, that I wasn’t

Well, that, and a nice garden. But that was Draco’s request too, so it didn’t really need clarification.
Draco muttered on his side. “Blaise, you’re a real gentleman.”
“And, Mr. Potter, I’m full aware that our family
either.”
“Piss off,” Harry laughed and finally turned to meet his eyes. Draco stood still, astounded, staring at every curl, every string of Harry’s hair. Was this all he had to do? Antoniette must have done a spectacular job this time. Maybe she had read the Witch Weekly article about breakups…Maybe Harry should read it.
“He was the one that asked me!”
At Auror Training, he made grave mistakes, which were overlooked by his mentors in the hope it was just a
“I think I look like an idiot,” Harry concluded after he checked himself in the mirror.
“I think it would work wonders this time!” Ginny interrupted and grinned, “We just need to plan it properly. Maybe last time we messed up the people!”
Months slowly passed in front of Harry, who dropped pointless dating and began to pay attention to what was at his reach. And with a year onto their backs, everything felt…
He couldn’t stop himself from thinking of Harry kissing Josie (who he really had no idea what she looked like). The thought of Harry’s lips over her neck, over her collarbone. Sucking her skin, breasts, navel.  And what if she did the same? What if she kissed him all over and made Harry lightheaded with arousal? An overflow of heat and jealousy covered his body before he could stop himself.
“Harry, you arrived!” Blaise exclaimed, entering the room. He was holding a cardboard box with presumably a birthday cake on it. Then, with his signature grin said, “We didn’t want to start drinking without you!”

“Harry,” Neville started, a soft gesture formed on his face. A concerned look. “I-I’m really sorry this isn’t working out for you.”
“Whatever, today I do.”
“Does this have magic in it?”
He didn’t talk to Harry.
The room was silent, only the noises of heavy breathing, almost hearing the way their hearts were pounding hard in between them.

shattered on him. It made him revisit the entirety of their relationship; how wonderful it had been when he was sixteen, how sorrowful it turned at seventeen and how empty it felt at eighteen. She was the one that kissed, the one that touched, the one that talked…he just moved along.
“Fucking hell,” Harry gasped.
“Harry,” Luna said, shifting her body to finally meet Harry, to lock her gaze with his. “I may not fully comprehend romantic love, but I know full well what love is…And
Not only he was doomed to like Hermione since the moment they met, but of course, he was also doomed to fall in love with Harry Potter.
“Okay.”
So he moved towards him. His steps not gracefully slow, the way Malfoy usually walked. Chaotic pace, with his glass of Firewhisky, trembling and spilling alcohol as he walked to him.
“Am I hallucinating?”
how they had managed to charm) to put a start to Harry’s quest.
“The world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters,” Harry quoted, dipping in old memories.
“What?” Harry snarled. “Being terribly bad? Of course he told you that,”
Draco was relatively silent. He was only leaving heavy breaths on his ear. Not moaning or panting as he usually did.
Harry laughed drowsily. It was the first time, without alcohol inside his system, he did it in front of him. He immediately noticed the evident surprise on Draco’s face in response.
This time he had a year with Draco onto his back, and he had learnt to give without being completely lost.
“Oh, sod off.” Harry rolled his eyes; maybe if he wasn’t that drunk, he could start another fight...or perhaps hexed Malfoy out of his house. “What happened to the Malfoy that nodded to everything I said?”
“Err…well, I’m out.” Harry managed to say.
“Yes, but I can still call it home,” Draco said. “It’s been my home since I was born. It’s big, spacious, too many rooms to disappear, I never see my family…”
“It’s made with flower essences and alcohol”, Harry quoted Draco because he was a
It wasn’t a Slytherin thing, Draco wanted to think. It was probably a product of his entire friend group being involved in the war; on the wrong side of it. Everyone was too stiffened, too quiet, and they all made bad choices and never got a question about it.
“What?” Draco asked breathlessly, his hands sunk on Harry’s curls.
There was a poem hanging in the wooden garden gate. Harry spotted one of its quotes, remembering the familiarity of it.
Harry looked up. The moon looked like bright white, with no tint of blue on it, “S’pposed,”
Harry noticed Ginny and Blaise looking at them from somewhere in the party, a big grin on their faces. And through the dizziness, he remembered Ginny months ago telling him that Malfoy fancied blokes, and he was drunk, and he didn’t give a shit anymore, so he just asked;
“Move,” Draco panted. “Harry,
“I’m not going through a break-up,

“And it was also headquarters of the Order,” Harry quirked his mouth, “Look it needs to be fixed but--”
The fifth of them were watching a movie at Ginny’s place. It was Ron, Neville and Ginny’s favourite activity; they were obsessed with muggle TV and could watch the most tedious and overused clichés on loop and still enjoy them.
I’m sorry, I couldn’t…I don’t know why--” Malfoy whispered breathlessly.
“I don’t mean it like that.”
He knew it was the panic taking over him and that Ginny was probably trying to make him a favour. But why would he go back to that? He remembered exactly how it started; everyone around him dating, feeling overwhelmed, trying to date, forgetting about his dates, never owling or calling back, and then falling into his bed with Draco.
“I can hear your thoughts all the way from here, by the way,” Draco said. He wasn’t eager to have a Hermione Granger thinking too loud on a Thursday morning. “Spill it out.”
Harry felt a small ache under his navel, a burning sensation. A knot present on his throat. The image of Draco Malfoy doing anything with someone other than him
A sharp feeling of hatred crawled through Harry. It was stupid, he knew. But he didn’t want him to be happy. He didn’t deserve it. Bad people didn’t deserve it.
“Well, he was always brave, you know. Something about
. That Draco wasn’t doing him any favour with it. That they were good together, and it didn’t matter if they both suck at being intimate, because when it was just the two of them, things simply
“This was my way of telling you.” Ron’s skin was flushing. “I’m sorry, mate.”
“I know. He’s an idiot.”
“Basically,” He shrugged, “Why? She always insists on having an opinion about my love life.”
Neville helped him. Without everyone knowing, he provided Harry with flower essences to help him sleep. He was trying to avoid potions in case Draco would find out and ask him questions about it. That, and the fact that he had grown sickened of the taste of the Sleeping Draught he took every night for years after the war. So instead, he settled with an overnight brew of Chicory, Zinnia and Yarrow flowers. The taste was horrific, but Neville didn’t lie when he told him it would make him sleep for long uninterrupted hours.
He wasn’t lying. Draco didn’t think he could live if he ever saw Harry wearing his clothes. The thought of Harry well fitted, on a button-up shirt, good fabric embracing his muscles, trousers instead of jeans… Draco felt himself shudder.
Of course, that was a poor analogy keeping in mind that he had to actually

Draco groaned. “Fuck me.

thrusts.
sound into Draco’s prick.
But Harry accepted his hand anyway, “Breneon Abbort,” The man introduced himself, “I work here in the Department next to Mr Borgin.”
Draco shrugged. He got up from his chair and took Harry’s plate to the kitchen. Harry didn’t want to push too much when Draco got like that, so he waited silently.
“Mr Boris felt sick, so Draco and I’ve been freaking all day in his office doing absolutely everything.” Hermione began. Harry was glad that no matter how cold and distant the floor was, Hermione was still Hermione, unaffected by her two years working in it. “Honestly, I didn’t even know that old man did that much!”
It was a cold night at Hermione and Ron’s cottage. The wind was daintily brushing the tree leaves, letting only white sounds fill the space. It was one of those times, during that type of weather, that Harry wished his hair was shorter and the curls less chaotic.  He was urgently trying to make them stay in their place, tugged against his ears, as he asked Ron;
“And all dead, I love that pattern,” Ron said darkly.
Harry remembered a younger Hermione, entering for the first time The Ministry, helped by McGonagall, into the Department of Magical Education. Harry loved to visit her there. It was probably one of the only departments that Harry didn’t loathe. It reminded Harry of Hogwarts, of McGonagall, of his old home and old professors. It felt…
“What do you want?”
Draco looked too vulnerable, body sore and tired from his crying. Looking fragile and helpless. Harry wasn’t excepting an answer. He didn’t need it. The nod was enough this time.
It wasn’t that bad. It made him feel vulnerable, leaving the sessions with the sensation of exposure, but he hadn’t learned how to truly deal with his emotions yet, and Harry felt like he could.
. Just because you want me to lie…I guess I’ll
“There it is,”
While the laughing, mocking, and commentary continued, Harry decided it was time to use the loo. He hadn’t really drunk that much, and he was growing into a bad mood. And it definitely didn’t help that Hermione waited for him outside the loo. “Hey,” She spoke gently, “You ok?”
Harry lifted one hand and started to gently touch Draco’s naked chest. Creating small circles, the way he knew Draco liked. It was lovely to see his face whenever he did that; with eyes closed, feeling each soft press of his fingertips.
In the letter Hermione received from Narcissa Malfoy, there was a preposition. An offer to work next to Malfoy side. He had been assisting an old man whose name was Brutus R. Borgin, and they needed more “help”. Hermione was sure that
Malfoy fell silent. There wasn’t an evident shift in his posture or a notorious change of expression. He just stood still, reconsidering Harry’s words without showing any sign of emotion.
He cringed at the memory; at whenever the memory came suddenly and out of nowhere. Remembering the way he touched Malfoy everywhere, like if he needed it to breathe. The way he said,

But for now…The Leaky.
“I was just asking for company. You perverted.” Harry elbowed him with his shoulder playfully.
Harry thrust harder, further, fastening his moves (or as much as he could in that position), but Draco was still biting his lips, trying to push aside any sudden gasp.
“I can live with that.”
“I didn’t think she supported your quest.”
It used to be like that, just simple hook-ups that no one around him understood, not even himself.
hope you enjoyed this chapter! see you in the comments ♥︎
I do irritates you.”
“We’re having a drink right now.” Marcus grinned. “But yes, I’d love to.”
As Harry promised, it was different. Less chaotic, but with that same frantic pace. And when Harry finally thrust into Draco’s body, letting the shiver and the pleasure of it flowed through him, he realized he had probably lost his mind.
everyone knew about their fall apart, so he wasn’t too self-conscious about it. This was going to happen tonight. They needed to talk.
It was Ginny and Blaise, and also Ron and Hermione, and everyone knew Seamus and Dean had a thing for each other even though they acted like they didn’t.
But he didn’t. Of course he didn’t.
“Well, because I changed everything,” Harry shrugged, shifting uncomfortably over his feet. “On my first year. It was too cold, too wicked–-Ginny helped me.”
Harry didn’t care. He whipped out the mess around his mouth and dropped his weight over the couch, feeling like he had no time to even sit properly.

Harry dragged himself up and looked at Draco’s eyes. “Is it because of Josie?”
“Well, yes.” She giggled.
Harry no longer signed his letters. Draco always did.
Blaise had joined them at some point; he had come through floo powder as soon as Ginny asked for reinforces when they all started to run out of names and people,
But Hermione and everyone’s effort really did something, because, by the end of it, the garden was looking absolutely lovely. A mix of green shades next to off whites all around, with magical lights shimmering around everyone. The food was floating with magic around the corners.
Harry and Ron both looked at each other instantly, trying to keep an unspoken conversation within them.
“Godric, no!” Ginny snorted.
“I like him.” He spilt out. He wasn’t surprised about his confession; his body felt warm after the tea, and his only desire was for Mrs Malfoy to truly understand him.
Harry nodded once again. He didn’t feel like talking too much.
Harry realised he had no idea what he was drinking; the liquid was a rich dark purple with something in it that made it shimmer. Was he really that drunk that he had accepted a drink from Malfoy without checking the ingredients first?
“What?”
” Draco interrupted, “You come
he had to come to him. He needed to see his embarrassment from up close.
He left a quick kiss on Draco’s lips and then took a step back to let him get down the counter kitchen. Harry bent to his knees and allowed Draco’s fingers to guide him. Draco touched his lips roughly, pushing his thumb into the inside of his mouth, making him
“Haven’t I looked like this since
“You could ask him out, I dunno.”
That night, when the game ended, when everyone changed subjects and then fell asleep in the living room, Harry dreamt of Malfoy.
” Harry softened his voice as much as he could, allowing himself to get closer to him, close enough to smell that incense his body impregnated. “Come
Dating was terrifying...but having a fear of dating was far worse.
He could already picture Hermione’s horrified face and Seamus amusement. And he didn’t even want to think about Ginny laughing till eternity. And Ron…Well, Ron was going to kill him.
“Give me something of yours, then. I need to improve this!”
“No. Because I know you want to, you just don’t know how to do it.”
“Should I try now?”
“Does anyone know what Malfoy is doing lately?”
“He wasn’t that bad,” Luna said as she entered the living room and joined them. She would always hang alone in Harry’s cold garden for a while, sometimes minutes, other times hours.
There was something in the words of Luna that remind Harry of Dumbledore, of the way the old man talk about love. Wasn’t love what had made Harry survive anyway? So, why did he knew so little about it?
A surprised look formed over Malfoy’s expression when he met Harry’s glance. At this close distance, Harry was able to notice the rosy cheeks strong in his pale complexion. “Hello, Potter,” he said.
“Because your family is fucking terrifying?”
“Yes, Mione. And I was the one being embarrassedly bad at sex!”
He had said. But, in reality, they both knew that they simply needed each other like that, in proximity.
Was this what he happened to become? A bloke longing for a relationship but never finding The One? His friends not being surprised that he couldn’t keep a girl for longer than three dates?
It took him days, weeks, months, and years. It was slow, really slow, but then...he was a better friend, a better neighbour, a better lover, and a better person in general.
As simple as that. With a game on a drunken night, a letter received on a Monday, a best friend working with everyone’s arch-enemy from childhood, and a new friendship built. A strange and out of nowhere friendship between Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy.
“I don’t know, maybe this way you’d lighten up and drop this scene.”
“Then fucking explained it to me!”
He had meant to give it back to him after his first date with Josie, but he had found a guilty pleasure in the way he looked wearing jewellery. He never had in the past, not a single necklace. He was expecting Draco to nag him to give it back as soon as that first date ended, but he hadn’t brought it up. So, in the meantime, he allowed himself to enjoy the feeling of keeping a ring on his index.
“Gladly…” Draco started, a lovely smirk formed on his face. He was looking really handsome tonight. “He’s not coming so there was no need.”
She had asked in her usual thick and loving Italian accent.
He was good looking. But blokes had always intimidated Harry, made him feel anxious, too conscious of his appearance and movements. That was one of the reasons he usually felt like an outsider of the queer community. Too scared of being
“No, I didn’t hex him because we didn’t really have time for much.” He admitted. It was better if he told them the truth. It was much better than letting them imagine that he and Malfoy had the best sex of their lives.
“It’s okay, love. It’s okay,”
“Honestly? I don’t think I want to.”
“Good, he’s suffering,” Harry said, the first real smile of the night formed on his lips. “Good, good, excellent.”
Back then, during his Hogwarts days, the conversations he kept with everyone were utterly different. Neither Crabbe nor Goyle ever questioned him. They never fought, never disagreed, and never said that whatever he was doing was stupid or wrong.
“We only did…You’re still—
Harry began, “Draco. You can still be a good person and make mistakes. You can still be a good person and get in a fight with your loved ones; you can be good and still let some people down by a mistake. Being good is not about making everything right. It’s not about nodding and agreeing and never letting someone dislike you because you don’t give them a reason to.”
“You promised me to help with the decorations and the food and the drinks and the--”
“Sophisticated use of words for this breezy morning.” And a grin formed on Draco’s lips.
“I just didn’t believe him. If maybe I had...Maybe my life—”

…At least Harry didn’t cancel his date. Instead, he wrote to Josie that a minor ‘inconvenience’ came up and that he will show up an hour late.
” Harry shook his head, “Leave Draco out of this, what I mean--”
Harry turned around to Draco; he was worrying his lower lip. “I know you were probably expecting to shag tonight, but I don’t want to be late and--”
He didn’t have a subscription of The Daily Prophet.
Harry wasn’t going to lie to himself. No, because it was too obvious for him to do so. He got the haircut because he was in desperate need to get Draco’s attention. To see his startled eyes all over him when he walked into Ginny’s place with his new non-messy haircut.
Blaise’s birthday arrived the day the weather got better in the city. The wind was still too strong for the time of the year, but at least there was no sign of upcoming rain. In truth, the climate did not matter, because Ginny had organised for Blaise a simple game night in their pleasant living room. And maybe Luna’s famous witches brew to accompany it.
When Harry got up, the alcohol rushed through his body. Making him dizzy, losing his steps.
“Don’t worry, I don’t hold a grudge anymore. But if you think you did so much better than Mr Malfoy, then I think you should revisit your past actions. Because from what I recall, most of the people here pretended the Second War never happened till it was already over.”
“Oh, hello.” Draco’s voice interrupted them. “What are you doing here?”
“The two other options were Snape and Flinch, by the way,” Harry clarified to Ron, who had a raised eyebrow while everyone busted laughing around him.
“Yes, because I got you off.”
And it felt like the Universe seemed to know exactly what it was doing because, for a whole week, the storms in London were uncontrollable. The weather tuning in with Harry’s emotions, the heavy rain impeccably matching his irritability.

He was prone to forget the dates he had arranged. He was easily distracted, he never liked someone enough, and he was present but also not fully there. He usually felt terrified whenever things escalated or move forward too quickly.
It took Harry the longest. Of course. But because he was overflowed by motivation and want and need, it didn’t distress him.
He had said months ago when they were barely speaking to one another, when Harry

And as if Luna had heard his thoughts (sometimes Harry thought she really could) she said, “Love is not reserve for relationships only.”

words his mother had told Harry minutes ago. Draco looked cold, distant and tired. Not open to any kind of conversation, any discussion, anything that had to do with opening his heart and talking to Draco.
“No. I’m not sure we’re on the same page.”
“I didn’t get it
But then he opened, and his smirk disappeared from his face. Eyes widened. He looked at it for a solid minute before meeting Harry’s eyes. “A family ring.” Draco whispered.
It was always vulnerable to stay like that, naked with his legs wide opened. To Harry, who kept that concentrated expression, his tongue in between his teeth and a frown on his face. His eyes filled with lust, his arousal evident as he cast more lube onto each palm.
Harry was glad that Draco was at least writing him back. Maybe it was because Harry was too persistent, but he liked to think that, in reality, Draco couldn’t help himself, no matter how much he tried to ignore him.
“Of course not.” Ron’s eyes didn’t meet Harry’s as he said it. “Look, I don’t bloody care about Malfoy. But he’s Mione’s friend, and she wanted to invite him.”
“Okay,” Granger’s eyes softened to him, “I still think a nice chat could solve so many things…But okay, let’s check today’s agenda.”
Draco gave him a small smile. He looked
In her mischievous plan, she was going to invite her co-workers, make them invite other people from The Ministry, get them drunk and find a new job offer somewhere in the middle. She was ready to reposition to a new Department and leave old Brutus Borgin behind.
Harry pushed himself closer to Draco’s body, closing the little space there was in between. Being pressed like that, with every bit of layer touching, permitted Harry to feel Draco hardness under his trousers, growing stiff against Harry’s hip. It was a heady sensation, and he couldn’t help but groan for the quick response of Draco to his body,
It hanged loose. Harry’s hands were the complete opposite of Draco’s, whose fingers were long and slender; one of those hands people looked at and usually say:
“Would you just drop it?” Harry said, but his voice wasn’t loud as it was before. And how on earth Draco knew Marcus last name?
What came good about his boring and long dates with Marcus was the once-again realization of Harry’s love for education. He didn’t want to be a teacher at Hogwarts as McGonagall once offered him. But he longed for teaching
He gazed down at his empty glass of Firewhisky, took a long breath and said, “Buy me the drink first.”

And it was as if he couldn’t contain his laugh.
“Let’s wait till midnight for that,” she winked.
And Malfoy was
Was I always an option or—?”
“I didn’t–” Harry interrupted for the first time, but then his words trailed off.
Harry shrugged. He had no clue why he was pushing Draco to talk about this again. “Just tell me again.”
“I love you too Luna,” He then said, meaning it fondly and deeply. “You also deserve love.”
Harry blushed for an entire week.
But the next week, when Draco was back, a new teabag was on his cup. Green leaf tea mixed with Orange slices and Lavender flowers. Exactly the one that Draco, during that last fight, yelled at him that would be

Hermione was a terrible liar; did Draco really think he could leave the fucking country without Harry knowing? The sleepless nights at least gave him something.

But he did. And they drank their Midnight Flowers in silence. Not meeting their eyes but fully noticing the closeness of their bodies. The alcohol acted fast on Harry. The flower essences making him dizzy. He felt his body loosened, the resentment he held inside fading.

Narcissa let another laughed, and Draco looked at her, astonished. Maybe it wasn’t only Harry that was surprised to hear the sound of her laugh.
Ginny broke up with him a year after the war ended. He couldn’t say he was surprised; nothing really surprised him those days. He felt sorry for her, knowing that she had to deal with the mess that Harry was during those times.
“I don’t know, just--”
“Hermione,” He breathed out, “I like him. He doesn’t want me back. I’ve tried telling him; I gave him the whole speech on how messy and desperate I’m for love and that no one seems to fit me. He
For Harry, it was the memory of his life at Hogwarts. On chasing Malfoy
Harry nodded; the words didn’t strike him too hard. Was he really surprised by them? No, of course not.
“Stop,” Harry looked around, making sure neither Hermione nor Ron were listening. “I am okay like this, for your information.”
“Tomorrow, I’m doing a list for you.” Harry tried lightening the mood and dropped a gentle kiss on Draco’s cheek. “Those who I reject can work for you.”

His heart felt heavy on his chest. His throat was building a lump that he couldn’t get rid of. Anguish flooding through his body. To have all this love to give, have this craving and need, and desire to give to someone and feel like it slipped through his fingers.
wearing.”
“Mate, it was completely unnecessary to tell me about the bathroom shag!” Ron continued, face covered in red. “I go there every single day!”
Draco did. It wasn’t because of his father threat, but because his mother had begged him that night that he shouldn’t forget, never in his life, where his life began.
With a heavy groan, he got out of bed and opened the window to let Hermione and Ron’s owl fly in the room. Harry took the small letter from the white owl, put his glasses on and read;
(See the end of the chapter for
“My ancestors wore these rings, Harry.

day.” Draco’s voice was cold, hard. “Do you get Midnight Flowers to all of your dates to prove them you are rich or something?”
a relationship.
He and Draco were complete opposites. Two completely different individuals with different stories and different backgrounds. Wasn’t it always that? The good and the bad, the hero and the rival. Light and darkness. Warm and cold, courage and fear. Every single detail about them was a pole of opposites, one standing in the other end.
“I just started!”
It happened a month later when Blaise had invited them to his house for a drink and chat with some of his stiff friends. And when Harry saw Malfoy trying to avoid him, blushing notoriously from a distance, he
“The war?” Harry challenged, with roughness on his tone of voice growing. “Your problem with him is what happened during the war?”
And both of them did. Both fell asleep on the couch, almost fully clothed, and Harry’s glasses and Draco’s wand lost in between.
And as Harry always had, he started to become another version of Luna. He never expected to ever show Draco Malfoy how he got like when he was drunk, but life was truly unpredictable.
Harry told himself. “You’ve no idea how much I wanted
“Well,
“I mean, I don’t want

had much clue on how things happened.
From an outsider perspective, it was as if they were playing some type of new game. It was names being said loudly, followed by a full analysis on why it would work or why it wouldn’t. It was magic floating in between them as the floating marker wrote each one of the names down. Drinks being served every time anyone named someone ridiculous.
. Is this your way of trying to make them think you are actually good? You know, by agreeing to everything people say.”
“He did it with Hermione, no one saw it coming!” Harry exclaimed.
“My Draco will be okay, I know that.” Narcissa continued. “I made a lot of mistakes when raising him, but I know that ever since he was little I taught him to be persistent, to try and try. So I know he’ll be okay.”
The following day, both Ron and Hermione woke him up with breakfast. Harry’s stomach was shut from the hangover, but he spotted the glorious Hangover Potion he was very familiar with and fond of at the table.

“I work with what I have, you know.”
“Not that.” She interrupted, “The one-off thing. He doesn’t have sex
Why did he allow himself to see Draco as more than just friends?
His body was aching. Own cock painfully hard, untouched, still on his jeans. He was about to reach for it with his palm when Draco cupped Harry’s cheek with a hand and finally got his prick closer to Harry’s mouth. His other hand on the base of his cock, steadying it to push it properly onto him.

from a bag. Luna and Neville were mixing a brew of most definitely alcohol. Dean and Thomas were sitting together, taking in a couch. And that whole picture confirmed Harry that tonight it was going to be good. A good and casual night with his friends. No evil co-workers from the Ministry, no panic attacks from Hermione, no Ron being obligated to arrange wonky-looking decorations, no loud music that Harry sometimes really hated. It was all good.

“Yes, yes. This is insane behaviour. I’m leaving.”
“I love him. I need him.” Hermione continued, “I don’t love him
“You suggested the Quidditch, I think we can both share a dream.”
Especially when the pleasant spring breeze brushed him like that. It was spring in Buenos Aires. Not only he hadn’t thought twice before taking the International Portkey to Argentina, but also he hadn’t considered the climate difference. What an idiot. Since when Draco didn’t contemplate things like that? Of course, it was spring in the southern hemisphere.
“Yes!” She said, answering his unspoken question that undoubtedly showed on his face. “Goodness, it was like he had a new skin tone and it was just pink!”
“I think I’ll owl her.”
“Are you and Malfoy--?”
him. Not only fogging his mind but also his body. Making him have stomach aches during midday and not wanting to have dinner the nights he thought about it too much.
you do.”
“Good afternoon,” Harry repeated. A weight lift over his shoulders. He felt relieved Draco was there. Not in Buenos Aires, not far away from Harry. “I just came for tea with your mother, is there anything wrong?”
Or Perhaps his words had an actual effect on him.
And Draco was tired of their fucking miscommunication, so he pushed himself forward, grabbed Harry’s shoulders and tried to shove him down to change their position. Harry allowed himself to be pressed onto his back.
Harry kissed him like that, without doing anything else, for long minutes. Keeping both of their bodies press together but not letting his hands move further. Draco knew he kept it for longer than needed because it was Draco’s favourite part, and he loved to please.
Draco’s mind clouded. He spread his legs open, not taking his eyes out of Harry’s beautiful,
But then he learned.
. He was tired of being in it for the stupidest little things, so he promised himself to never get the newspaper if he could avoid it. But right now, he needed it. He ran out of the door to a local Witch Café close to Grimmauld. It was hidden for muggles, and it was hard to find. Harry used to like it there. He liked the smell of morning coffee mixed weirdly with myrrh, an odd combination but definitely
“Can’t blame him,” Harry smiled. “See you on Saturday, okay?”
And Harry thought the teasing was definitely worth every second of it because there was nothing more attractive than Draco’s gasps on his ears.
“I’m selfish.”
“I choose Harry now!” Ginny said with a sly smile, as if she had planned perfectly what to ask beforehand. “Mmm, I’m bringing some flashbacks from the past now…
“Bugger off!” Ginny was laughing terribly next to him, having trouble forming her next sentence. “So…your other two options to

And Draco tears began to fall. He shut his eyes, failing to stop them. Making his face red and puffy, tears dropping slowly one behind the other.

Harry glanced back, trying to catch Draco again. But he found instead only Hermione talking in the circle. Harry tried looking around for him. Was he mad at him? Was it not okay for him to flirt (if you could call that flirting) with someone?

“I like it like this.”
“I think you need to talk to Draco,” Hermione quirked her mouth.

“Pardon me? I don’t--”
Draco smirked and Harry lost it.
The sign held steady, and it perfectly read:
“Err, yes?”
“You think you deserve people treating you like shit?”
“You really think so?” Ron asked and ungracefully dropped himself onto a white chair.
“Goodbye, traitor.”
“I know that. But he can’t, because I’m the politest person in the office. It’s fine.”
“And what? Make them sleep in one of the creepy rooms? I remind you this house was filled with dark wizards long before Voldemort was born.”

as he left the living room.
“No, Harry. You’re simply not making it a priority.”

It was a true journey for me to write and post this story. The last time I post a fanfiction I was eleven (now I’m twenty-two!!). Before this, I used to write drabbles that never passed the first draft. So…finishing this is genuinely terrifying for me. That’s why feedback is appreciated!
“Cornelia Hopkins!”
Because never in his short adult life he had thought he would be ever doing this. On his bed, with Malfoy panting softly with each thrust, taking Harry through his orgasm with no sign of effort.
“Don’t thank me for these things.”
“I can tell.” Malfoy shook his head, “Honestly, Potter. Why couldn’t you just ask a professional to help you with this?”
Harry could almost read everyone’s mind, no need for Legilimens;
With a glass in his hand, a bunch of ostentatious silver rings covering his long fingers, making slow movements with them as he spoke. He was dress entirely in black except for a dark emerald scarf hanging open over his neck. He was talking. With Luna for a bit, with Neville next, then Dean and Seamus, and then alone with Ginny.
Harry looked down at Marcus’s hands, pale hands, not thin as Draco’s, not as beautiful. A silver ring, more delicate than his, with a gentle T engraved in it.
fine. I don’t want to look like
Harry wanted to think.
It was hands leading him around places; the voices of those who survived indicating him what to do next. It was healing sessions he was bound to take for wounds the war left and will never be healed. It was potions and remedies offered so he would finally
“What?!” Harry snapped, “It’s not like I haven’t tried to kill Malfoy in the past, you know.”
“…And you’re here, asking yourself if you’re good or bad. But I had never seen bad people ask themselves that. You are a good person, Draco.”
. In contrast, Harry’s were a polar opposite. They were bigger in size, rough-looking, nothing elegant in them, with a few black hairs where the ring should fit.
“You are a nightmare,” Draco repeated, voice hitched. But this time, as Harry began thrusting again, pushing in and out, he moaned louder. Allowing him to received his beautiful chanting,
the answer was there, flowing between them, even in the conversation they had last week.
“Err, yes. That is why I
or what?”
Malfoy gave him a funny look, and before Harry thought too much about it, he asked the bartender for another Midnight Flowers for Malfoy.
“Okay, just say you want to touch. It’s fine.”
“Did you also want to see the blue moon?”
And after some time, when the night started to fall and the air grew colder, they hung lazily on the couch saying some names sporadically as if they had suddenly remembered a possible love of Harry’s life. Or to only share trivial stories about co-workers or ex Hogwarts students. “I saw McLaggen two years ago at a pub. Somehow he still holds the stupidity on his face.”
“Look,” Draco started, “You can do whatever you want with your cock. You could blow a guy in front of me and I wouldn’t
As it was pretty much expected since she was a teenager, Hermione was currently working to find herself a place at the Ministry of Magic. And she was doing a splendid job at it. After the war ended, Hermione got in contact with important figures from the inside. Everyone knew her. That she had always been at Harry’s side, just like Ron. She began working as an assistant with the hope of slowly making her way up the career ladder.
Because yes, the Potion Regulation and Analysis Department was indeed ridiculous. Level Six reminded Harry too much of the Dungeons of Hogwarts, except that in this case, there weren’t kids running and talking loud, making everything feel warmer. Instead, everything felt too silent, too cold, and too rigid. Even the sticky notes flying around felt more graceful and slower than when they fly in the Auror Headquarters.
Then, Harry
And he was laughing, in Ron’s bathroom, alone, with the glass of Firewhisky in his hand.
“As a matter of fact, you should do that right this second.”
“You once say you would fuck him.” Ginny pointed out.
It was a miserable and stupid way to find out that he was falling in love. But as his body touched the stranger, he felt a twinge down his stomach. Flooding him. As steady as a rock making him sink. He was on his fours, taking the thrusts, and he was glad the boy couldn’t see his face. Because he wanted to cry. To cry for being too
He should have stopped Harry the minute he saw him writing the letter down. But he was selfish. He had always been selfish.
“I don’t beg forgiveness, Potter.” Malfoy continued. “But I don’t want to fight, and neither do I want to bother you. So I’m leaving.”
They both came before Harry could start thrusting himself inside Draco. But after some time of gentle touching each other’s hair, after whispering,
“We should’ve cast a silencing spell.” Draco finally mumbled, voice almost inaudible.
“Err…Yes, a bit of a long story. I won a bet, now it’s mine” Harry lied.
“If you were an animal…” Harry started.
. Harry wasn’t stupid or
Harry always thought when seeing them like that; fitting perfectly in each other’s touch.
. Draco’s body squirming because of his touch.
And Draco, who needed someone that loved every inch of him.
Draco’s words felt like lies. “He didn’t even work with you!”
Harry kept quiet. He allowed Draco to run his fingers delicately while he looked down, at his tanned hands, at the Malfoy family ring around his finger.
that moved around his friends. Slow, but still there. And when all of them, infected by the feeling of hope, met in The Leaky Cauldron, it was like being back to life.
“Yes, terrifying. I know.” Harry said as both of them stood in the hallway. “After Sirius died, he left it for me.”
Neroli flowers flooded his mouth.

The only thing that kept him sane was that Malfoy had acted just like him. He had also touched him hurriedly. He had also made noises and said stupid shit. He had moaned a

after Ginny. And it was okay. Until now. Until Ginny started dating Zabini; talking about him often, inviting him to their Saturday meetings...and they were
And then there was Draco Malfoy. Reputation ruined (that was for sure), but nonetheless a Malfoy, and still got a place inside the Ministry of Magic. Like his father, and the father of his father, and so on. During his years after Hogwarts, he specialized in Potion Brewing, which led him to work in the
He started to look at Hermione and Ron’s relationship, how happy they moved at talk. How soft they acted around each other when no one was looking. How they tangled their hands together...They didn’t show their relationship to the outside much; they were both shy about it. It was during movies when Harry noticed them softly touching each other’s hair. Or maybe on Saturday nights, the echo of loving voices coming from his kitchen.
“That’s so pretty,” Marcus said softly, enchanted by the magic working in front of them. “Hermione is such an amazing witch.”
. People who fought the war when they were kids because they loved too much.”
“How long could Draco Malfoy stay in a place he didn’t plan beforehand?” Harry smirked. “I grew up with Hermione. I know how your minds work, believe me.”
“Thank Godric,” Ron whispered to Harry’s ear. “I’m so tired, and it’s only Monday.”
And Harry, without meaning to, rolled his eyes.
Hope life finds you well!! ♥ Thank you for reaching the end. You have no idea how much it means for me that you did.♥
Harry complied, with rushed movements, working with his belt, then his button, then unzipping. And when he finally sank his warm hand inside Draco’s trouser, he couldn’t help but moan. He panted and began to stroke his cock through the thin fabric of his pants. Draco’s dropped his head into Harry’s neck, breath hitched, his hands moving all around Harry’s body, leaving his hair to touch his shoulders, his arms, pressing himself impossibly closer. As if he was frantically trying to feel every bit of Harry’s body and was not sure where to start. Harry fastened his strokes.
“Harry.” He corrected him. “Stop this. We can all tell you’re having a bad day.”
The second time was on Ron Weasley. His change wasn’t immediately, but Harry started to notice how he slowly retrieved the personality they both knew from school. It began with dark jokes about the war, then escalating in just general banter, and he was back a bit. Different, but back.
“Potter,” And then he sighed, “I like whatever we’ve been doing for the past few months. I like that you share things with me, and I like that you listen to my night rambles. I enjoy this, but….”
Harry huffed, taking the clothes Hermione made him buy. Clothes that not only look and felt expensive but that, of course,
fingers.
“Sod off.”
Apparently, Draco thought exactly the same because he followed his steps.
The three Midnight Flowers were poured in front of them, the shimmery rich purple swimming on the glass. Harry took a big slurp and then said trustfully, “I’m sorry.”
He needed a drink.
“I couldn’t, Harry. I couldn’t tell him that he was right. I was terrified. I wanted to believe him. He told me things about protecting me and my family, but that’s not what I was listening. No, I was focus on the way he was saying I wasn’t who I thought I was.
But now, Harry’s heart began breaking, suffocating him.
His statement gave place for everyone to start discussing the differences (if they were any) between Crabbe and Goyle. And then, after some minutes passed, Neville asked what everyone wanted to ask in the first place;
he wanted to know that part. That part was ok.
. This place is disgusting, let’s go to yours.” He tightened his grip around Harry’s hair.
“Come on, love.” Ron scoffed, trying to tone down his laugh. “You can’t be serious!”
“Neville!”
Slytherin, and everyone in the sodding school kept repeting to us that it was the evil house, the house of dark wizards, and
“Of course,” He smiled, showing all his teeth. It was a pretty smile. Well, he was a handsome man. Probably the same age as Harry. He smelled like some type of citrus. Orange, maybe. “My little sister would die from excitement if I told her I talked to you.”
“No need, I’m leaving,” Draco said, arms crossed.
on repeat, they moved close again.
But sex with other posh boys was nothing compare to how
Harry smiled softly. “And? Come on, it’s not like you can’t tell me these things.”
He began by carding his fingers through it slowly. Everyone who looked at Harry might think that the nest he had in his hair was impossible to detangle. But for some strange reason, it never did around Draco’s fingers. The first night he got to touch it, he could it believe it, how those chaotic curls could be so
he had asked.
No. No, no.
Draco laughed low onto Harry’s hair. And Harry could felt himself losing it. He wanted to rut harder, to roll his body toughly to the counter, to make Draco moan the way he usually did. But, no. He needed to slow down. He needed to follow the pace Draco usually put. Slowly at first, and then all a sudden harder.
Harry felt his body twitched as his arousal grew bigger, making him leave small and low moans over Draco’s ear. He dropped both of his hands over Draco’s hips, pressing and squeezing his fingers over the fabric of the button-down shirt. He then attempted to lift him up, just a little for Draco to understand what he wanted.
“Think about Rosie!” Ginny interrupted him. “She’s nice. And you don’t know her, and if it goes completely wrong, you never have to see her again. And the Cup is almost over, so
Hermione still saw him every weekday, and Harry still hated the idea of Malfoy near her. At least he had Ron next to him, who had a good time making jokes on Malfoy’s possible plan on murdering his girlfriend at work;
He was glad Harry kept his eyes closed. He couldn’t bear it whenever Harry opened them and looked at him directly with those wide green eyes. With that gaze of lust and hunger and--
“You are unbelievable,” Malfoy muttered and shook his head slowly. “You came here, I didn’t call you. I don’t care if you hate me, I can live with that, believe me. I just want to be on good terms.”
he repeated him into his ears soothingly.
And he said it only because he knew it would make Harry smile or laugh, and he
“You came from Grimmauld?” Granger widened her eyes. “Since when do you sleep there on weekdays?”
Harry tensed.
“Okay.”
Maybe he

It was a product of having slipped a confession to Neville and Luna, a declaration he had kept lock for so long that the timeline felt foggy. Making him bewildered, off-balance.
him. He could picture Draco surprised smile before quickly hiding it to make fun of him. The twinge down his stomach deepened.
Harry tried to bit down his laugh. If someone ever told him at the age of fifteen that one day he would sit next to Narcissa Malfoy talking about something as mundane as tea, he would have lost it.
“I hate this office,” Harry said, observing everything. Clean, empty, cold, packed by paperwork and shelves filled with labelled potions.
“You’re looking nice,” Harry said because it was inevitable.
“I hate you.”
Harry hesitated before he sat on the edge of his bed,

. Harry did. Rolled his hips with a hesitant press at first, and then tighter when a soft pant came out of Draco’s lovely

“Of course they are, Lu.” Ginny told her, “Harry wants more options, I’m assuming.”
Harry’s chest grew big, he suddenly felt suffocated. He grabbed the first thing he found on a chair of old clothes and dressed quickly.
And when he pushed the first knuckled inside, Draco dropped his face back, eyes fluttered closed, looking at the ceiling. As if it was all he really needed, and Harry had made him wait too much for it.
A shiver covered his body when he got close to read the poem properly;
“Harry,” Draco whispered shakily. “Harry, come on.”
The words echoed over Harry.
Hermione was giving Blaise a look, something Harry couldn’t really decipher. He was too busy to think about it when a small memory on his mind was making an effort to reappear, to play like a movie. A months younger Harry, asking Draco out, and then being delicately rejected.
how a new haircut looks like, and yours was probably cut just hours ago,”
“That was it!” Ron shouted in realization from behind, “Mate, I was eating my brains trying to think what was different in you.”
There was something in Malfoy’s words that immediately hit Harry. Something familiar, something that knocked him way too hard in his core. It was the memory of Ginny wanting him to give more than what he could. The memory of Hermione telling him he needed to be a better boyfriend. The memory of his dreadful dates with strangers. The memory of his short and brief story with Cho Chang when he was a teenager.
“You’re taking the piss!” Ron howled while the tipsy round of clapping began. “Please tell me you are joking!”
“Yes, well…” Draco made a movement with his hands as if it explained something, and his words trailed off. “So, she’s telling you to try dating Josie?”
Harry felt his neck burning. “Neville’s idea.”
there and that Sirius loathed the place too.
So Harry talked, and Malfoy was laughing the way Harry never in his life had seen him laugh. “Did you know Luna brews the best alcohol on the entire planet?” He said, and Malfoy was just…
“I already told you. I changed my mind.”
haircut!” Ginny yelled in amazement the minute Harry arrived by floo into her living room.
“That’s nice to hear.”
“Harry,” He interrupted. It was the first time Malfoy called him by his first name outside sex, outside the usual moan that accompanied it. “You—I’m not meant for dating. It’s just…too much for me. So, if this is fine for you, well…I like it. I’d like to keep doing it.”
“You can Disapparate from the garden, come.”
about it.
“Exactly.” Draco huffed but kept his body still so Harry could continue with the soothing pattern over his chest. “And I’d immediately hex the guy that did that to me.”
“Okay, but don’t get angry at my choices!”
“His father does,” Draco corrected him, breathing hard against him. “And he probably has a hate club around my family.”
“How is dating Turner?” Draco interrupted before Harry could continue. There was a slight tint of fear in his voice.
Was it so long since he dated that he couldn’t even spot when people were flirting with him? “Err…Yes?”
“I don’t want to get too comfortable here,” Harry said bitterly. He knew he was childish. He didn’t care. Whenever Harry got angered, he just pushed too hard.
“That’s what I was saying!” Hermione pointed out. “Anyway, we have a lot to do. Draco, you can’t go home yet. I know it’s getting late, but….”
So he did tell him.
“And? Is this all because of what happened with Turner?”
Then he felt a soft kiss on his cheek, the strong scent of incense, and the noise of sheets moving around him.
Harry pulled the damp locks of his fringe away (Draco could easily spot his lighting scar) and then moved one palm to stroke Draco’s prick. He couldn’t help himself from bucking his hips up in response.
this feels a bit stupid now.”
Another nightmare, he was used to that, but it had been years since he last got one in which Malfoy was in it.
“Careful with your words, Potter.” Blaise pointed with a smirk. “What I meant is that he never really dated, and you know, I wished he had someone.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Draco said. “You’re not listening to me. You’re meant for dating, but you’re not fully there when you do so. That’s it. And that’s why it’s good that we’re ending this, you know?”
It was Ginny’s birthday. Of course it was a birthday because Malfoy was only there during those occasions, and he was always quick to go. He looked different than last time at Ron’s birthday; Blaise presence easing him. And Harry fell once again into the obsession of carefully looking and analysing Malfoy. Observing his posture, the way he looked open, relaxed. The way his long thin fingers moved as he talked...
They stood silent, looking at the full blue moon in front of them as if it was intoxicating, and Harry was probably about to sleep in any minute if it wasn’t for wise Luna who said softly;
Draco opened his mouth to talk, but Harry felt as he couldn’t resist any more. As if the confessions were desperately trying to come out of him. “I’m not meant for dating either.”
“I’d marry Neville and…well, sorry Seamus.”
“If you could only allow me….” Harry held his breath, “If you allowed me to love you, I think we can make things work.”
“Well, it looks bad.”
Harry allowed himself to truly look at Malfoy, to really pay attention to him. It was the first time in his life he got to see him
And Malfoy was gone from his bed once again.
“The. Loo.”
me…he did everything.”
Harry remembered the voice of Narcissa Malfoy;
“What for?”
do you like blokes.”
“I’ve seen this before,” Hermione let out, lower lip caught in between his teeth. “I’ve seen this ridiculous quest before, and Harry…you’re a complete mess at it.”
Harry would talk, and Draco would mostly nod, sipping the hot black tea, only responding in the necessary bits, as if he didn’t want to make Harry mad. But Harry was mad anyway just because he agreed with him for nothing.
Ron made a gagging noise from the couch, and Hermione nudged him a bit. She was sitting on his lap, with an arm resting on his back, making gentle movements.
Maybe that was why Harry chose to come for him for a second time after the awkwardness of the first. Perhaps that was why he had felt the need of going for a third, a fourth. Because his body or his fucking soul knew he always needed much more from Draco. From the boy he met at eleven that for some reason was still present in Harry’s life no matter how much hate and rivalry moved around them for years.
“Your friend’s fault.”
“What a prick,” Harry muttered. He shifted his body to his side to meet Draco, whose back rested against the bed headboard. “Yea, well…I’m making lists.”
There was a big chance that his voice sounded bitter, annoyed. But he couldn’t really help himself. And Harry was probably too oblivious to realize, anyway.
Ginny insisted everyone stayed the night. And with a couple swinging of wands, the living room was filled with soft, colourful pillows and blankets all around. It looked so peaceful that by just looking at it, Harry could easily fall fast asleep.
“Honestly
“I realized it was better if I assume it.” He continued, and Harry stood from his chair and moved closer to Draco’s body. “So I did. I now understand that everything that happens to me at the Ministry, or in any aspect of my life, it’s because I deserve it.”
“I don’t even know her!” Harry frowned; it had been a long time since his friends interfered with his non-existent love life. “And she was suddenly telling me I was
She nodded and then said, “Are you single then?”
And it hit Harry.
“All of you are here!” Ginny snorted, a pink blush spreading on her cheeks. “But okay…I would fuck Harry –As I’m already familiar with that, you see…”
“Don’t say that.” Harry huffed, “I’m retired from prophecies, you know?”
Draco opened the door, and without looking back at Harry, he left. Not even saying goodbye.
Everyone went silent.
“I thought we were friends or something,” Draco said sardonically.
his family ring?” Marcus said in surprise, almost choking on his drink. “My mother will definitely kill me if I gave someone mine.”
“You didn’t stop me.”
“I will let you two alone to talk.” She said gently as she moved gracefully over the door, kissing Draco’s cheek softly.
Narcissa laughed, “You’re pleasantly honest with me, Harry. I wonder if you were also honest about your feelings with Draco.”
The garden was the last bit of their moving. They left it for a day in which everything felt somehow organized and could concentrate on the task.
“Just goooo!”
His mind wandered. It was idiotic, thinking and thinking about questions he had answered and dealt with in the past. But the situation was opening all types of questions again; “
“Oh,” Draco glanced carefully at Harry, “I’m not going to lie; Blaise told me about your…
lists and everything, what you mean I didn’t make it a priority?”
That was the night Harry dropped his pointless dating. When he decided he didn’t want to be a boyfriend, a partner, not yet. That he was okay with this weird relationship he built now that he and Draco talked during his nights together.
“Granger told you that?” Draco interrupted. He was frowning. The words came in a strange tone that meant
“Yeah, Blaise said that, but I don’t think
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, in her usual pity voice Harry had known since his teenage years.
“I want to blow you.” A voice that didn’t seem Harry’s came out of his mouth; desperate to break or to finish the strange sensations that were running inside his body.

Harry kept the first thrusts slow, adjusting his body to Draco’s. Letting the first’s heavy moans onto each other’s mouth in the attempt of kissing.

“I’ll kill Malfoy—”
he wanted to say. But if he did, Draco might sense the lie.
lift him and set him over the kitchen counter, but he didn’t think Draco would appreciate being tossed around. So he just made the small encouragement for Draco to follow.
“It’s okay. I’m gay anyway.”
He used some light spells, but also allowed himself to clean the muggle way. Picking the left ingredients from the bar and restoring them into the kitchen cabinets. He moved the chairs and tables slowly as the alcohol in his system began to fade.
Harry nodded, letting her continue in her voice that felt like a chanting. “I don’t see people that way, and I’m still capable of loving. I still love people. I still love animals, and plants and things and magic. I love the food that I eat and the friends that I have. I pour love in every second of my life.”
“This office is better than the rest of the Level. But I like it better than your floor, which it’s definitely too chaotic and should be changed and-–”
Potter,” Draco said hoarsely, trying to catch up his breath.
“You need to move to the woods or something,” Draco grinned, sipping his Lavender tea.
“Don’t worry; I know he hates me.”
It wasn’t like it had been at Hermione’s birthday, in which he had stood alone till he joined a conversation with people from the Ministry. This time, it was Ron’s house, filled with Ron’s life. Which also meant it was also Harry’s; same friends, same childhood, same family. Even the place was fucking decorated by the both of them.
But immediately, his try was interjected by Ron’s loud laugh next to him.
“Well, I don’t,” Ron muttered. “Okay? Err…If I was an animal…I guess I would marry Crookshanks. I mean, I already live with him. And no, I’m not going to say fuck because that bloody disturbing…I will softly kiss in the cheek Buckbeak.”
“Harry,” Draco begged, and Harry pushed the first finger inside.
“Whatever, you didn’t answer me.”
Harry gazed at their entangled hands, the way his palm covered Draco’s slender fingers, the softness his hands always held, feeling like they could break under Harry’s firm grip.
Those are one of the flower essences Midnight Flowers has.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry added quickly, “The point is that he’s mad at me, we’d sex in your ugly bathroom and then he left without saying goodbye.”
When both of their pants were out of their way, Harry muttered a spell with his wand, and a shiny and sticky texture dripped into his fingers. They were covered in lube from his fingertips to where the ring met his palm—the
“What do you think about dating?” Harry asked a week later on his bed, body sore and tired even after his nightly shower. Draco hated whenever he fell on the bed without casting a drying spell on his hair and damped the pillow in warm water. Harry couldn’t care less.
“Supposed”, He shrugged, his fingers brushing his pale blonde hair, tugging it behind his ears, “I’m not going back to the party.”
If this man thought Harry would let this go, let it pass as a casual conversation, he was completely out of the blue of who Harry was.
“Mione told me some things,” Ron continued, ignoring the peevishness building on Harry’s. “She said he’s a mess. Not…
Harry nodded. Resuming his movements, but continuing his slow and careful shoves, with that stupid grin on his face.
This chapter is narrated from Draco’s POV! I thought it was nice to switch some things up and get a different perspective.
And he couldn’t finish his sentence because he allowed himself to break off. To cry the way he had wanted to the minute they both entered his room. And
“I don’t know,” He repeated. “Honestly? Nothing. I don’t want to do anything about it. It’s terrifying. I can’t believe how frightening it is.”
And right there, in Ginny’s garden, was Luna. Luna looking at the moon, sitting barefoot on the grass with a dreamy gaze. She looked like a painting, like one of those things you see in European museums and tourists die to get a picture of.

But that was just one day of the week. And for the rest of it, he would still snarl at his alarm, still, find it insufferable to wake up and floo to training. He hated having to make himself breakfast, having to clean the coffee pot, having to make himself presentable for the world.
“Well, clearly, I give you the worst tea of my selection.” Harry lied. He didn’t have a tea selection. Why would he?
don’t know.”
In Harry’s defence, he did try to eat dinner.
It could have been that, or maybe the endless nights in which they had told each other secrets because they were too vulnerable and they didn’t feel like lying.

, I hate lists—but for this! Maybe we need to organize things.”
The news of Ginny dating did something to Harry. It was hard for him to put it in words; maybe it was jealousy, or perhaps he was envious. Not because he wanted her, but because he realised he wanted
Draco laughed, and Harry couldn’t do another thing that to follow. To meet his eyes and join his laugh and to feel the warmth of having him close.
He thought.
But they had been doing the training for years now, and it was almost over. Maybe working for the Auror Headquarters was different from training and doing really subtle work (most paperwork) for the Ministry. Harry could only hope, at least.
He needed fresh air.
Harry scoffed, “You buy the house.”
A week after Draco smelled a woman’s perfume on Harry’s pillow, he was on edge. His mother held the monthly tea party in their garden, and a nice bloke had flirted with him. Without much thought, he took him to his room when no one was looking (not that the women at the party were paying attention to something else than the pretty garden and the French patisserie).
Harry felt a sudden burn on the back of his neck.
And Harry didn’t know what to say. His plan was to show Malfoy that he was looking at him. That he was paying attention, judging him, and that he should stop laughing because he didn’t deserve it.
“I want you,” He said, words rushing to come out.
“It’s weird,” Ron continued. “She says he’s nice, polite and all that shit. He even has a sense of humour, surprisingly.”
“You’re right. I’m in a bad mood, and it’s better if I leave.”
…I don’t have a Potter family ring
“What do you want?” Harry rushed out the words.

sure about that. It had been a year since the both of them had fallen into a strange dynamic. How did it all happen? What was it that leaded Draco to be in his kitchen counting the food for Harry’s birthday after shagging him senseless on the couch?
“What?” Malfoy’s face changed, his smile fainted, and his posture stiffened. Harry didn’t like this Malfoy; he liked the quiet one who laughed at his jokes.
“It’s silly.” Harry felt himself getting sick. Maybe he was about to throw up.
“Don’t feel pity for me. I survived worse.” Draco threatened before she could continue. He didn’t feel like having a speech about
. He understood that he needed to be vulnerable to love. In order to show Draco how to be vulnerable with him in return. He needed to make the first move.
So why did he feel Draco’s words resonating with him so much? Why did he feel like it was his story being told from another person’s mouth?
Harry only nodded; he felt his mouth and throat burned from the previous sensations.
It led to Harry’s explanation of how he had always been (accompanied or not) temperamental in the mornings. And after that small and meaningless conversation, Draco began accepting tea before leaving.

” He stretched his neck up to meet Draco’s eyes, darker than before and noticeably filled with lust.
“Bless him,” Everyone said in unison, toasting their drinks, accompanied with drowsy laughter.
but the taste of knowing it was bought only for him made him the happiest man alive.
He put a hand on hers, reassuringly. Harry could have been a terrible boyfriend (Godric knows that) but he always knew how to comfort. No need for words; just a touch, a look, an understanding nod. He was good at that. He could do that.
But this time, it wasn’t prophecies, or villains, or the death of those he loved. It was
“You’re a nightmare.”
“Yes. He is good. People that hate him at The Ministry are just hypocrites.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But before Harry could finish his question, Draco had his lips occupied with another kiss, hard and hasty. He then hurried one hand down to Harry’s pants, and when he pressed his palm to the outline of his cock, a soft moan came from Harry’s lips, and Draco
“Marcus Turner! He’s right…there! Works at the Ministry like Mione too, but he is nice! Just had a chat with him and ran all the way here to tell you.”
Draco breathed in, and out. He still wanted to brush Harry’s hair. He really

thinking out loud.
There was no point of stretching it for longer--
He wrapped his fingers around his erection, making fast strokes up and down with one hand while the other held Draco’s inner thigh tightly. Not taking his eyes away from it, wetting his lips at the idea of tasting him. Draco was breathing hard, and Harry could feel his thighs trembling with desire under his palm. He decided that there was no need to torture each other like that, so after a couple of hasty strokes, he spat over his cock (Draco hated whenever he did that) and lowered his head to press a wet kiss over the tip. Then, a second. And then, a third, with his lips more parted, followed by a short suck. Draco let out a soft pant, and Harry allowed his tongue to slid and travel through the shaft. Slowly tasting the bitter taste of Draco before fully taking him with his mouth.
But Zabini didn’t need to know that.
“So you just call everyone by their last name now?”
Moving in was nothing compared to the quest of finding the place; Draco was highly picky, wavering pros and cons, looking at all the details, trying to not miss on anything.
“No, Gin. I’m not jealous. I still want to protect you, that’s all.”
he always made sure to wear his favourites whenever he met Harry. And also,
“You know much about alcohol?”
Neville’s words weren’t harsh. On the contrary, his voice was low, comforting. Yet, they still created uneasiness on his inside.
Ron would usually say that every single day at Aurors Training, but Harry knew there wasn’t a tint of truth on those words. Ron was never tired enough to not enjoy it, he usually left the weekends hoping to return. And it was definitely the opposite for Harry, who long dreamt of being in this position, but now it felt like a nightmare suffocating him...
“Fuck, Harry.” Draco held him, breathing hard against his ears “
“So…” Rosie continued, “If you ever want to go for a drink or something….”
She let out a loud and annoying sigh and gave her tea another sip.
It turned out to be a peculiar night.
“It’s not a-–” But Harry let the sentence trailed off. He was already blushing, and it was better not to repeat the word break-up in front of Draco.
Harry move it messily inside, not as cautious as he usually did it with the first finger. His mind was clouded, but he couldn’t stop thinking about how Draco said
Harry didn’t mind. He’ll still affirm he wasn’t a morning person, however, he had to acknowledge that there was nothing more pleasant than an early morning with Draco.
It was childish and absurd, and maybe even laughable, Harry knew. But there was something in it, something he liked about the whole situation. He was acting the way he always did during his Hogwarts days, and the memory brushed all over him, intoxicating.
“Maybe he doesn’t, and he only felt sick for you to do the job.”
And he knew the man that was standing next to him hadn’t learned that lesson yet. And Harry was more than willing to show it to him.
“What do you
The way that Draco looked at him, gaze overflowed by

“She deserved better.”
casualness on it.
. So instead, he masked it with an easy emotion.
“I’m starting to wonder why I’m having sex with someone that seems to despise me,” Draco slapped his hand, and with a smirk added, “You’re not even that good at it.”
Harry looked around the room; even Luna was giggling from the corner. Neville was the only one that at least tried to hide his smile under his drink.
“Don’t say my name as if we are friends.”
Blaise moved aside the minute he spotted Harry getting close.
Harry had always been known, since the beginning of his childhood, as a temperamental kid. As someone who always had a hard time controlling his emotions. Someone who did the first thing that crossed his mind because he felt in his guts.
“I don’t like some people in it, but that’s just a small part of it.”
Like the way his hair was the same as his father’s, same height, same facial features. Wasn’t it also possible to acquire and develop the same attitude towards life? The constant thinking and thinking and thinking. Draco didn’t want to think about Lucius, no. Not now, not ever. They didn’t talk anymore, so was any good to think about him?
oblivious. Luna had told him plenty of times that she sees Draco as his boyfriend. He avoided giving it much thought. Why torture himself like that? Longing for someone who he couldn’t have, at least not in the way he truly wanted. Hasn’t Draco been telling his stupid quest was pointless just this morning? Hasn’t he joked about how hopeless Harry was about his love life?
Draco’s cheeks started to feel warm under his touch, all flushed. Harry moved his hands to his hair, carding his fingers through it and then tugging it. Draco responded with a wheeze onto his mouth and skimmed his hands down Harry’s body. Untucking his shirt out of his jeans, gliding his hands into his lower back. The coolness made Harry jumped a little, leaving a smile on their kiss. He was now used to it, to Draco’s constantly freezing fingers and the touch of the silver rings over Harry’s skin. It would only take seconds to mimic Harry’s temperature.
And Draco’s smirk was back on his face, and Harry took the moment of silence to really check on Draco. To notice the dark under-eye circles, the tired and sleepy gaze he held. To observe the way his hair was brushed tightly to contrast the rest of his outfit…
He remembered how that image crumbled with the Pensieve memory of Snape. The way he cried, thinking his father might have been a bad person after all.
“I don’t know, Potter, just–-” And he pressed Harry back to him, entangling his fingers in Harry’s hair, reaching for his lips once again.
Harry had bad hook-ups in the past, but this one was something else.
Perhaps he was…jealous.
“It’s not! Molly always says there’s

With a whimper, Harry slowly removed his fingers. And with the same hand, gave himself a couple stokes before lining up to Draco’s arsehole.
Harry wanted to shut him up before he actually did.
“No.” Draco huffed, the glass on his hand being clench too hard. “Because
Harry had done it a million times already over the past few months. He knew how to handle a casual shag with a stranger. But this time, it was different. Malfoy was not a stranger, they didn’t even flirt with each other (not consciously at least), and he was overcome by million sensations.
Luna quirked her mouth, “That sad, you two work nicely together.” And Harry felt something sinking on his inside.
“Deanne Cresswell!”
He felt dazed. Hypnotized to properly understand how everything moved. Somehow they managed to drag each other to the living room, Harry pushing Malfoy to the couch, stranding his body and pressing down.
Harry decided it was better if he let her speak without any interruption. So, he relaxed his muscles, tried to sit better on his chair. He sipped the tea, trying to pause the unease the situation gave him.
Hermione laughed, and a gentle hand fell over his back to slowly caress him. With a low tone of voice, for only Harry to hear, she said, “The way you are seeing this…this quest. That is not how love works. I love lists. I love to think about the good, and the bad, and the
our differences.

Harry’s hands were firm on Draco’s shoulders as he pressed their bodies closer, looking at his lips, wanting Draco to give him the right sign for him to close the distance.

“You don’t get it. You’ll never get it.”
Harry met his gaze as he pushed another finger inside.
Harry thought as the number of people around his house started to lessen till it was only him standing in the kitchen.
“You thought about running away?” Harry asked. He couldn’t say he was surprised. Wouldn’t he do the same if he was him? What was Draco still doing in England where co-workers were horrible, and people on the press never leave him alone? Why hasn’t he already run away to Latin America?
he could even smell the scent of incense Malfoy carried with him.
As Harry let the sip of alcohol fall down his throat, he felt a sudden burn in the pit of his stomach. He could lie to himself and say it was the alcohol (because it was definitely something to do with it). However, he

“How was I supposed to know that?!”
“Dunno, tell her I’m sick.”
“She’ll be dating you, so I think it’s best if you present as yourself.”
Mrs Malfoy poured tea onto both of their empty teacups and closed her eyes at the first sip. Harry imitated her, trying to be careful with the china, as he pressed his lips for the first taste of it, scenting the perfume of the flower tea. The Neroli burned his tongue. It tasted…
He had cut the food into small pieces, trying to trick his brain into taking the small bits. But ever since he got out of the Ministry and floo to Grimmauld, he had felt full. He knew full wasn’t the right word, but it was the easiest way to put it.

Draco sighed. And after a brief second, with an almost whispered voice, he said, “You know why.”
“I do.” Draco groaned and placed both of his hands on Harry’s arse in an attempt to make him move further. “
Even Harry dreamt with that.
“Well, he’s twenty-five, yet he has never dated someone.”
And why was
“I wanted colours. Couldn’t decide, so…I just put a bunch of them.”
“Malfoy?” She laughed; she had one of those really pretty and charming laughs, “I was at Hogwarts, two years below you two...he was terrifying.”
Harry huffed, “I really like this girl. I need to look better than fine.”
They woke up in the early morning, and with an awkward and meaningless exchange of words, Malfoy was gone from Grimmauld Place. Leaving with the definite idea of ignoring each other for the rest of their existence.

It was cheesy, and it made Harry felt stupid, but there was something in knowing precisely what the other person needed at that time.
“I can believe you’re talking about bad temper.” He muttered.
Draco was the polar opposite. His mind would ponder in between millions of options. He would overthink it so much it wouldn’t even make sense in the end. It was

Harry felt a tug down his stomach when Draco said goodbye to him. He stayed longer than what he intended, Harry knew, but he still felt somehow disappointed. And it didn’t matter if they didn’t really talk that evening; it was still nice to know that somewhere in the house, Draco was still there, moving around the living room, helping him host his pathetic birthday party.
“I’m starting a new Boyfriend Quest!”
aaaaaaaa lasts chapters are almost here!  (
But at least
Harry dragged his mouth out of Draco’s neck, lifting his head to meet his grey eyes. His lips were swollen, and his hair rumpled by Harry’s previous hands. The sight made Harry’s heart throbbed hard. “You are so beautiful.”
. But Harry knew that she secretly loved being everywhere and doing everything at the same time.
Harry bit his lips as he looked at Draco’s flushed cock, dampened with precome and hard over his belly.
“This tastes really good, Harry,” Marcus said.
After Ginny, he dated others. Humdrum dates with people from Auror’s Training, friends from Neville or friends from Seamus. He dated pretty girls that he liked but never enough, and occasionally boys that intimidate him to consider liking.
“Terrible,”
“Oh, no, no--” Harry answered with a grin, “I think she tried. If I think about it. But, you’re forgetting how oblivious I can be, you know.”
“And I know you really want it. So just say it.”
Last September, no matter how much Harry had tried to avoid it, he saw Malfoy at Hermione’s birthday. And he looked…well, he looked like he always did. Elongated and tall, as if he never in his life had bad posture, not even for a minute. His hair impeccably done, without a single strand spoiling his image.
“Wanna come after this?”
The last days of July finally arrived, and Harry was persuaded to celebrate his birthday. But not with a casual celebration at The Leaky or a simple board game night at his place.
But the reality was that they both needed that time. They both needed to learn about their relationship, about love, about vulnerability, about good and bad. All in order to live like this,
His therapist used to tell him,
It was always around him; movements, choices, and decisions being made long before he was born. It was life plans prepared for him before he knew magic was held within his core. It was fucking prophecies all around.
“…He—He was trying to make me a proper Malfoy, he wanted me to line up with my duties, and being soft was never good for heirs. And I…Harry, I only knew that I was a bad person. Everyone confirmed it to me. My family,
“Oh, I know
“Midnight.” Malfoy corrected him.
Malfoy blushed rapidly, and after a pause said; “I think this is a bad idea. I don’t know what I’m doing here.”
The entire night revolved around
“He was keen to… well, find a way to get you out.”
“But it’s your birthday!”
Harry huffed. “I don’t feel like waiting”.
Harry looked back at Ron, “You’ve talked to him!”
After the war ended, many things happened between Harry and the Malfoy’s. He had received letters from Narcissa telling him that
It was lovely. Harry never had something like that.
“You hate it too!”
“Don’t kill me, Harry, please.” Neville begged with a shy smile, “I don’t want to be killed by the Chosen One.”
Harry was saved by his favourite Hangover Potion, and once the stomach pain left him and his overall dizziness was gone, he felt embarrassed. Mortified as the memories of what happened the night before started to build slowly on his mind.
The same conversation repeated itself over and over for the rest of the month. No one truly expected it to be easy.
Harry didn’t want to know why he thought people wouldn’t choose him. No, he wanted to know why Draco hadn’t tried it.
“Sure,” Harry nodded. “I owe you one, honestly.”
. Harry could repeat the speech on his head without Draco needing to say a word. “I’ll only move out of here if you do it too…which is never, so let’s enjoy our crappie homes.”
“You changed your mind over Harry or the

But it was okay. It felt okay, and Harry’s body was reacting as if it was
“Straight to the point, I see.” Draco raised an eyebrow. And then, worrying his lower lip, added, “I did, Harry.”
- At least he offered tea. Only for it to be rejected with a quick
“Sure,”
“I love you too.”
His thrust became more frenetic, letting Harry almost out of breath, hand clenching hard onto Draco’s bare thighs, for sure leaving nail marks on them.
“Why do I have you here if you are not helping me?”
“Hello, darling.” Narcissa greeted him. “We have a guest, you should be kinder with your hello’s.”
Draco nodded, looking at the blossoms growing on the ground. It was Harry’s favourite side of the garden, the colourful flowers entangled together; some of them with small buds closed, and others fully flourished with lovely petals showing. It was colourful, but not in the chaotic way the walls inside the house were; the flowers here felt coordinated.
Nonetheless, he saw light in some faces. Some lucky ones knew how to deal with pain and how to not rotten with it.
“You’re pretending to be nice, acting as if you don’t care any of this. Buying drinks, talking to my friends…what are you doing?”
“And?” Draco looked back at him, burning his gaze into him. “We’re not leaving together,”
Harry had spent the first two weeks after the first letter arrived being completely irritated at Draco. It was anger whirling out of him through his fingertips, through his magic.
“Would you like to get a drink sometime?”
“Well, yea…because I’m kinda worried.”
“Pardon me?”
, Harry only needed
When Harry arrived, before crossing the main door of the bar, he breathed in and then out. He certainly didn’t want to do this today, but he hated to cancel on his friends.
It was a gift from Narcissa Malfoy. She had taken hers to give it to his son; “For you to have a piece of my garden in yours,” She finished while Harry drank his Neroli tea on his side.
“I thought the same, the first time I tried it.” She said; a fond smile formed in her delicate appearance. “I get my tea from a very famous witch from China. But the thing is…there’s no magic in it. Just
Harry stood in silence.
Harry stayed in silence. He tried to think of all those conversations they held in the past.
“Am all yours.” Harry smiled as he caressed Draco’s arms softly, making him feel tingles all over.
” Harry huffed, “I’m not going to yell at you because it’s your boyfriend’s birthday. You don’t deserve it
“I’m tired of you,” Draco said breathless, straddling on top of Harry. “I’m gonna do it myself.”
“Are you out of your

“Mr Potter,” He then said, stretching his hand to meet Harry’s.
. “Do you know old wizarding families would die for a house like this…And what are these colours?”
Maybe it was all that which made Harry lose his mind in the end.
“It’s your quest anyway.” Neville chuckled, “But, I’ve someone perfect for you!”
The pleading voice of Draco made him dizzy. Harry’s eyes fluttered close as the shivering sensation flooded him. Then moved quickly to work on Draco’s trousers; taking the belt away, unbuttoning his fly, unzipping and pushing them down all the way down to the floor. Allowing Harry to properly settle himself in between Draco’s naked legs. He widened the gap, pressing his knees further from each side.
“Dunno,” Harry shrugged, one of his fingers rolled around the top of the empty glass. He needed more alcohol, or maybe water, or perhaps to Disapparate.
“Done.”
“Great,” Harry took the last bit of his drink and then added, “Look, I really have to go. Err…I’m supposed to help Mione check the party so… I’ll owl you and yeah.”
, he wanted to say. His mind felt unclear, unsure of the words that wanted to appear.
Draco was worrying his lips, uncharacteristically. Harry wondered if he realized he was doing it. “But I also understand that part of growing up is realizing I could have handled better, I could’ve changed things, I could’ve lived differently. I’m okay with that.”
“And?” Draco’s eyes were dark, shaded. It made Harry feel distant. “I don’t want to have this conversation over and over again. I’m paying the consequences of all my actions.”
I’m also working on other fics for the HP fandom, you can follow me on Tumblr for some
And then, Harry remembered Hermione and Malfoy saw each other every-single-day at work.
They fell asleep again after their second orgasm, overcome and overflow by the sensation of affection. Of required and reciprocate love.
“Everyone does that.”
And it wasn’t an exaggerated statement. No, he truly sucked at it.
Harry allowed her words to sink in. To taste them slowly, to take each and one of them onto him.
He didn’t even say hello to him.
The irritation and anger he felt were gone. As if he hadn’t spent the past couple of weeks yelling internally and complaining at Draco’s letter.
And what if he

But the most important thing, the one that Harry cared for the most; she told him that Blaise was a good person. He had his flaws, still meeting ghosts of his past like all of them had, but nonetheless a good person. Harry felt his muscles relaxed.

about it.”
“And because it’s your birthday.”
“Are you setting dates on me?”
Life from Harry’s point of view was completely different. Raised in a family that hated him but only wanting to seek love in other families. Holding to the image of having good parents, who fought the war because of the injustice of life, being throw to adulthood the minute they left Hogwarts.
So he did. The waiting for the flowers to bloom, for the herbs to rise, and the trees to root, gave Harry

Draco stood at their garden door, trying to put a spell in the wooden sign so it held properly.
Draco’s whispered voice from the first night he spent at Grimmauld echoed in Harry’s mind
. He felt a sharp shiver overran him from his scalp to his cock as Malfoy helped him to finish, with his fist moving fast and out of rhythm.
A sudden silence filled the room.
Harry breathed out, “It was not a breakup.”
“Jesus, no.” Harry interrupted.  “But now that you bring that up, it feels like you are still guilty about it….”
Draco couldn’t recall the exact moment in which he realized he had fallen for Harry. Somehow it felt like it had always been there. It might have been the first time Harry ordered lunch after spending the whole night together, or the day he gave him his ugly Gryffindor scarf because
“Harry.”
Hermione’s words were rushing desperately. Harry felt ashamed; they were supposed to help her. Draco was also blushing, trying to mumble an explanation out.
He often wondered if he would have the same experience if Ron wasn’t there. Would he hate it more? Would it made him drop the training?
to do about it?” She wasn’t looking at him, yet a compassionate look was visible from her side.
Harry was gulping the last bit of his second drink when he met Draco’s gaze. He was surrounded by some people, probably co-workers because Hermione was eagerly chatting next to him.
“So what? You’re planning to find someone else to shag?”
Draco stiffened at Harry’s question, and he suddenly realized
“I’m sorry. We shouldn’t be talking about this. I want to know how you are.”
It wasn’t as if he never had other crushes. He remembered some guys from Slytherin who flirted with him during Hogwarts, or perhaps the sons of his mother’s friends during tea parties at The Manor. He occasionally had sex with other blokes just because it made him feel wanted, liked and whatever. So he didn’t really

He didn’t want to fall into that loop once again. He started to feel a twinge on his stomach because he knew that a part of him did crave intimacy of that kind. He just didn’t want to open that door once again. Of feeling like everyone around him got it easier except for him. Everyone around him met their fucking soulmates at the age of twenty, except for him, who only fucked up relationships the older he got.
He was a good friend, he knew at least that. He might disappear some weeks because he needed to be alone, or maybe because he felt once again overwhelmed by old memories. But he was still
Harry felt a rush of cold going through him. He and Blaise kept a pretty basic relationship; he had learned to like him because Blaise was kind and absolutely perfect for Ginny. But their conversations always consisted of Quidditch matches and sometimes the weather. They rarely mention Draco; he was positive he had covered the details of their relationship with Blaise
Harry Potter made Draco feel. The way he looks at him during it, as if he was the most beautiful thing in the world. The way he touches, kisses, bites, licks.

Draco smiled vaguely, but it felt genuine enough for Harry; “I do.”
A year ago, Harry would never in his right mind think that he was going to spent his birthday like that; on his couch naked after Draco had fucked him, laughing at the exaggerated face he pulled when looking at the food served on the kitchen counter.
Draco let out a genuine laugh. Hermione could be too obtrusive, she could be a pain in the ass, constantly giving unsolicited advice…but
Ron flinched at his words. “He’s paying for every single one of his actions, you know that, right?” His voice had shifted. It was almost a whisper, although the garden was completely empty.
“Don’t.” Draco shook his head, “Look, you don’t do that to your friends. With them you’re truly attentive; you care as if you need it to breathe. We all know that. Everyone in this room knows you’d probably die to meet someone wish and that’s not even metaphorically-”
were doing the entire work?”
Harry was definitely sulky. He hated being possessive of his friends, but he couldn’t stop himself. He couldn’t help but gaze at Malfoy constantly; what he was doing, where he was standing, who he was talking to, or what he looked like when he spoke…
Hermione’s birthday was around the corner, and her evident distress was tinting every conversation.

Harry never listened. Instead, he pressed his upper body closer to him. Chest to chest touching. Nibbling Draco’s ear, as he kept the almost
“Why, why, why?” Harry began muttering, feeling the embarrassment rushing through him, burning. “It is one of these things we pretend never happened!”
“Jesus, Draco…I think I could come by just
“Who, then?”
Harry busted into a laughed, drunk Neville was the
“Oh,”
Harry wanted to move, to touch him, to hold him close, to kiss his tears and to kiss each and every one of his words. But right now, he needed to listen.
“Sure, no problem.”
. The idea of someone finding out his soft spots, finding out the way Draco liked to be kissed. The way his gasps felt onto his mouth. The image of Draco moaning someone else’s name didn’t make sense to Harry. It just didn’t. It was pure hypocrisy. Harry of course knew that. But...
“It looks like it’s going to stay.”
Draco sighed. Harry was in
“Thank you, thank you,” Harry managed to say in between the cheering of his friends.
“I have a fascinating and eventful life, you know.”
“Dunno. I blame the Midday Flowers.”
Malfoy’s hands froze for a second. He then murmured something that sounded like
. Merlin really loved Harry Potter, because he made him the prettiest man alive.
And with an embarrassing trembling hand, he decided to finally write the letter down;
Harry didn’t want to talk about that. At all. He drank the rest of his Midnight flower. Of the stupid drink that tasted exactly like the taste of Draco’s mouth had the night they went home together for the first time. The ache at his stomach widened, burned.
Draco’s body stiffened around him. Then, with a whispered, he added, “You are planning to go back to Turner.”
And Harry smiled. He smiled because he felt the weight on his shoulders and back lifting. He felt the knot on his throat clearing, his breath steading. He felt light for the first time in months. For how long he had felt a weight in every part of his body without realising?
And after a year of sharing his nights with Draco, Harry was surprised to find out how love and vulnerability changed everything for them. How their morning’s conversations were technically the same, but there was a new atmosphere surrendering them.
“That’s it.”
Draco took a breath and met his eyes again, “Harry,
does that.”
“Apparently I was flirting with the son of one of his enemies at the Ministry, or some shit like that.”
“We’re on time,” Harry protested.
“Wait,” Malfoy stopped him. Perhaps he was too drunk, but he sensed a tint of anxiousness in Malfoy’s voice. “Let me buy you a drink, please.”
Therefore, he ordered three Midnight Flowers instead of one. It was the only drink that could get him drunk fast enough, and he was sure Luna and Neville would appreciate it.
Or let me spent the night here with you. Let’s talk about everything. Please,”
“Err, yes,” Harry said, unsure. If he said Firewhisky he was going to sound like the most boring human on earth. And the only drink he could think of to make him look like an acceptable adult with an outstanding taste in alcohol was....“Have you ever tried Midnight Flowers?”
he thought. “I’m sorry Hermione. I tried, I didn’t like it.”
“Ask for it.”
“It’s beautiful there,” Draco smiled, “And the Quidditch players are phenomenal…maybe you should drop Auror Training and play Quidditch there.”

“Have you seen my wand?”
Maybe he
“Harry.”
It began with birthday parties, that was certain. Back then, it was the dizziness of the alcohol that made Harry easily attracted to Draco. It was the number of emotions he held inside whenever he saw him that made him what to do
, they needed this.
Harry blamed the alcohol.
“Thank you very much. That makes me feel better.” Malfoy huffed, grabbing his drink way too hard with his hands.
At first, Harry thought Hermione was joking.
Because yes, it was not only about making lists.
“That is
“I’ve already spent more time with you than any of your friends.”
Why did he keep calling him Potter?
“Oh, but your hands were very enthusiastic about my presence, you see--”
For a slight second, Malfoy looked puzzled; he obviously didn’t know how unpredictable Harry’s thoughts were. And if he didn’t move fast enough, he would change his mind quickly. But he
Harry felt it was okay if he held him.
“Definitely.”
“Oh, Mr Potter.” She said, finally lifting her head from the desk for the first time since Harry came out of the lift. “She is in Mr Borgin’s office, right…
“Also, Harry…” He said, coming to his side, touching his shoulders softly. “I’m not going to stay for too long if that’s okay for you.”
Can’t believe we are reaching the end of this story! I hope you enjoy the last chapter before the Epilogue (which will be pretty short; less than 1k words)! See you there for more of a sloppy goodbye to the readers.
Draco left the warmth of Harry’s mouth and stoked himself into his own orgasm. “
“Is this for what happened on your birthday? Because I told you I’d things to do, I wasn’t lying-–”
before pushing Harry back into a kiss. And decided to never bring it up to him again. He had mentioned it to Hermione and Ron once or twice but left the topic to disappear from his brief interactions with Malfoy.
Draco continued his nagging, but Harry wasn’t really listening. He headed to his bathroom, through Draco's yelling, only to come out with a cheap-looking hair comb on his hand.
Maybe he should go back to therapy.
“I always enjoyed calling Hermione by her last name,” Draco answered dryly, “And she doesn’t seem hurt.”
“You are so lovely,” Harry whispered. He wrapped one hand over Draco’s cock, stroking it with the right pace. “So, so
The city was beautiful. He should stay.

“Pardon me?” Draco left his side and moved quickly to the kitchen,
Maybe in between his begging, he understood Harry’s meaning behind it. Maybe he sensed his need, his desperation, his necessity of confessing love. Maybe it was all that or just the mere fact that Harry intruded in his house to have tea with his mother. The reason didn’t matter because, in the end, he nodded at Harry’s words and, grabbing his hands, took him to his bedroom.
I was bad.”
A glance over him and this bloke who he couldn’t even remember his last name. And
“If you demand,” He smirked.
The new house was almost empty.
“Nice to meet you,” Harry said, thinking about how rude it would be to press the lift buttons right that second.
“Oi! Don’t be so harsh at Harry.” Seamus said, “He just wants to love and have good shags.”
Draco only nodded and hid his face under the tea mug. It was a bit too early to have that conversation, and Draco didn’t seem willing to continue it. Maybe Harry needed to bring it back on a night where their minds were lighter, and the air between them was tranquil.
“I’m not! The wonderful Ginny made me realized this on my birthday.”
He needed to step away from the vertigo and the dizziness his thoughts were making him have.
“I’ve been worse,” She said gently, “And I’ve also been better. You’re a very kind man, Mr Potter.”

was the only reason. A month wasn’t enough time.
To Harry’s surprise, when he reached the bar, he sighted Neville and Luna getting up and walking closer to his side. He decided their company couldn’t do any harm, and it was better than the rest of the options, anyway.
“Are we going to play or not?” Ginny was saying somewhere in the room. And Harry was dragged to reality once again.
“Plenty of time.” He told Draco as the letter flew from Grimmauld Place. “Shall we take the ‘just fine’ clothes now?”
Hermione left them, and with a heavy breath, Harry looked at his feet. He felt exhausted. Without meeting Draco’s eyes, he turned around, heading his steps to the inside of the house, where the music wasn’t loud, and his mind could find rest.
“Only Blaise and Ginny were close, and I’m sure they were busy.”

as if everyone around him was dull and too boring. It was now replaced with something else.
Harry’s heart felt heavy on his chest,

“The Blood Traitor!” Dean said, beer raised and everyone applauded him.
“But I can’t do more than this.” Malfoy finished.

Draco smiled. “Please, enlighten me.”

“Oh yes, because I
“Oh, no? Is it good?”
“And?”
“You look not so good,” Luna added gently.
“And we’ll be back again next year,” Neville smiled at him, his eyes waiting for a smile back. Harry appreciated his effort. So he did.
“Harry.” He corrected. He was tempted to stay there. To remain still till Draco finally called him by his name. But he was also torturing himself, and he was almost losing it, aching at the need.
It was filled with boxes everywhere; Harry’s side of the job was out of order, while Draco’s was perfectly organized, making the cardboard boxes almost look like furniture.
, but, I- Well, I don’t know.”
Harry kissed him clumsily, hands sinking down to their junction, touching the outline of Draco’s hardness through his trousers. Draco answered, bucking his hips up, seeking for the touch.
to meet up with them, because everyone already knew and they were going to talk about it, him being there or not.
