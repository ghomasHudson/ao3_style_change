Trading a look with the Weasleys, Harry shrugged, "You know how I was forced to confront Voldemort nearly every year since I was eleven until the bastard was finally dead?"
Rubbing his scar, Harry stated tonelessly, "We need to find a way to stop them. If there are enough of them working together, who knows what they might do."
When the pureblood pointed out, that her 'fixtures' were the least of his worries, right now, she cut him off, commanding, "Sit!"
The blond caught up with Harry just outside the kitchen. Balancing the tray, the Auror wanted to know, "Were you able to talk some sense into her? Is she going to file a report?"
'Thank god it's Sunday,' or so Harry thought, pacing the length of his living room. The women he needed would be hard pressed to make time for them during the week. Since it was nearly four, he expected them at any moment. An exasperated voice startled him out of his musings.
"Poppy came in once a week to check on you and one day she brought Emilia Nightingale." Chuckling at the memory, Harry recalled, "Emilia breezed through your room like a hoard of Cornish Pixies, leaving no stone unturned. Curtains were pushed aside, windows opened, sheets changed. That day - three months after the battle - we gave you your first bath. She did not even ask if I wanted to help; just ordered me around. And I was so afraid to hurt you or to offend your sensibilities. But Emilia would have none of that. Within the hour, you lay in a friendly, aired out room, on fresh pillows with birds chirping outside. Nothing reminded of the tomb I had put you in even though you were still alive." Reluctantly looking up, the young man met the understanding eyes of the former patient and was finally able to take a deep breath.
"Me included." Harry nodded a little but didn't comment. They had talked about their shared past at length. No use bringing the topic up again. "But, these days, you wear it like a badge, showing it off on occasion."
Still, the blond stayed on alert until he heard the Auror go down to the kitchen and leave for work. For another thirty minutes, Draco worked diligently before exhaustion took over. Between one heartbeat and the next, he was passed out on his desk.
A warm hand on his shoulder had him whip around and overwhelmed green eyes met his, dispelling any lingering hope that his slip of tongue had gone unnoticed. But Harry did not address that matter. Instead, he merely held on for one lingering moment, before letting his hand fall away, "It's okay, Severus."
"Because he's Harry Potter. He never cared for fame or power. All he ever wanted was for the people he cared about to be safe." It had taken Severus Snape six years to understand that, but now he did not have the shadow of a doubt. Harry Potter was the best man he would ever know.
"You can't do that!" The terrified denial swiftly morphed into a full-blown panic as Draco wrestled with the Head Auror who had reached for him. "No! You can't make me to go back there! I ... Potter ..."
Shrugging the raven-haired explained, "It seems that having a war-hero in the family is good for the reputation. Your cousin Morwena - please don't ask me the degree - approached me not long after the award ceremony, to ask if I would … ahm … patron…ise …"
Glancing at his wizard as if he was an imbecile, Kreacher stated with forced patience, "Master Harry has the young Master Draco study ancient potions recipes, especially anti-venoms. The Potion Master's library is the best place to look for an antidote. Or at least a recipe. Kreacher is an old house-elf, he has learned to think without having to snoop!"
Suppressing a smile, recognising the stages and ingredients of the 'Draught of the Living Dead', the potion he had mentioned in Harry's very first class, the Potion Master wanted to know, "Did it work?"
Everything was soft and warm and tender when Draco slowly woke. Moving a little, he absent−minded noticed something sticking to his cheek, but since the comfortable touch continued, he did not want to overthink it.
Baffled, both by the admission and the idea, Harry wanted to know. "We can do that? Just add more floors?"
Since it was not even six a.m. Harry could enjoy a little lie-in. Or so he thought until someone started pounding on the door as if wanting to kick it down. With reflexes won during the war and honed at work, the Auror was in the entrance hall, his wand ready, in ten seconds flat. Shivering from the morning breeze that hit his naked chest, Harry froze when recognising his unexpected visitor. Despite the man wearing a hood that cast his face in shadows, Harry would have known him anywhere from his posture alone.
For a moment, nothing happened, then a banging noise came from the door, and the rattling of china could be heard. Kreacher hastened to open it and in danced their tea-pot, an empty cup, milk and sugar. Emerald even managed to levitate everything to the couch-table, before losing the spell. With a slight clattering, everything sat down.
“Let's hope so.” She pondered, rushing through her volumes. “But we will need help. Get me Ron and … Luna would be good … and I’ll see what I can do.”
Relenting, the pureblood shuffled around, until he sat on the thin mattress he had discovered in a corner. "I've checked this cell several times. There are no cracks, moving stones or secret passages, as far as I can tell. Please, come here and relax. We can't do a thing until we know more."
Unable to meet his liege's burning gaze, the former Lord lowered his eyes while admitting quietly. "Yes."
"I …" the blond started, but when Teddy pushed the pendant at him insistently, he accepted the gift. "Thank you, Teddy." Sinking to his knees, he hugged the boy, who kissed him on the cheek rather wetly before smiling. "Love you. Good night, Dragon. Good night, Mister Lucius," before skipping out of the kitchen."
Harry could hear her take a shuddering breath and waited patiently for her to regain her composure. When she got up and turned, her posture screamed pureblood, regal and strong, but her eyes betrayed her. Her gratefulness was so evident that the young man wanted to pull away.
Then the raven-haired instructed, "Don't let go. I know it will feel like pins and needles, but I need a complete circle for this to work."
would never be able to identify traces of a spell that has already been ended or analyse spell-patterns revealed by a Prior Incantatem, I can! Nobody at the Auror Department can refute my findings, and do you know why?" He had leaned over the table, careful not to touch Hermione's wand, until the man who had just insulted him whimpered and frantically shook his head, he explained quietly, "Because I am the best! That's why I was hired twenty years ago, and that's why I am here now."
The two witches traded a look before the newcomer untangled herself and offered her hand, "Exactly, pleased to meet you, Lord Potter-Black."
He only noticed how tense the blond was when Inari yipped since Draco had clutched her too tightly, after pulling her from Harry's lap. On his way to the sink, the raven-haired put a comforting hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry, Draco. Everything is set up. You can go to bed now."
Chuckling, the young Auror pulled out his wand, shivering once again. Maybe they should start a fire? This house was still draft, despite all the renovations Harry had made. Clearing his mind, the young wizard stepped up to the portrait and started casting. Slowly, over the next few minutes, every snake in the room came alive, apparently offering an opinion on what Harry wanted to do. Neville and Severus crowded together in the middle of the room, trying to stay away from the animated wards. Though both had come to accept Harry's parsel-magic, it was still hard to feel comfortable surrounded by hissing serpents.
"Draco, why are we talking about family mottos? They are bullshit. Relicts of a time long passed. 'Toujours Pour'? Look at what came of that. Bella was batshit crazy, and Andromeda produced a powerful witch with a muggleborn."
Chuckling under his breath, since even properly bound, his elf had cut back on the sarcastic comments only a little. Harry gestured around himself. "I need every potion's journal and other publication in this room. Special emphasis on those that mention poisons or antidotes."
The moment his father looked up in confusion, Potter pushed a button, and a flash went off. Fascinated, Draco watched the other wizard pull the black and white square the little machine had spit out, shaking it to dry the potion that coated the developing picture. The three Malfoys were still blinking dots from their visions when Harry gave a broad smile. "Lovely. That goes into my office.",
"Nana had a new dress made for Aunt Cissa's birthday. And I got a robe. It was really pretty, with a shiny lapel in deep brown. Nana said it reminded her of daddy. She promised me crêpes if I were good. You know, the really thin pancakes from France that taste so much better than ours."
When he trailed off, turning the last few pages back and forth, Draco inquired after a minute, "What do you have in mind?"
Gazing at the table, Harry decided, "But now let's return to work. We did enough soul−searching for one day. Don't you think?"
Tense anticipation filled the air, rousing even the smallest children out of their sleepy haze. Thumbs in their mouths - clinging to their parents, or godfather in Teddy's case - they looked around with shining eyes. When the first ray of the weak winter's sun climbed above the horizon, Arthur began the prayer. Facing south, he took in the beloved faces of his family and friends.
"Alright? Just like that?" Rising his eyebrows, Harry studied his colleague. He was not used to anyone taking his 'instinctive feelings' at face value. Well, except his friends, of course, and even Hermione had argued on occasion.
"I know what I have said, Draco," the raven-haired sighed, touching the bridge of his nose as if praying for patience. "But now I am telling you to bloody shut up and eat. Things won't progress any faster if you topple over from exhaustion!"
Her voice was quiet and full of pain, more pain than he had ever heard, she whispered, "I am so sorry, Sev. Please, forgive me."
Resolutely pushing down all unbidden pictures that rose in his mind, the man asked, "And what is he doing up there?"
Both watched the blond and his pet before the dragon-tamer continued drily. "I think she missed him."
Thinking back to the day the Auror had gotten buried under a house, the young pureblood shrugged. "It wasn't all sunshine and roses. But you were in good hands. Father had managed to convince himself, that he could support you best if he tried to help with the case. It got better when you came back to Grimmauld Place."
"I need a muscle stren… streng…," damn those sounds! At least the witch knew better than to correct him by now. He was no child in need of guidance, no matter how much he sounded like one. "Tisle. Tistle!
"Harry, … I, …" Severus felt pathetic, like an imbecile he had always accused the other to be but … there were simply no words to express the gratitude he felt.
"Of course," the former Lord agreed, not ready to admit that he literally had not understood a single word of what had been said.
Smiling down at his boy, James Potter revealed, "We're an echo, nothing more. Yet more complete than we were the moment this painting was finished."
Angrily, Lucius looked at his master. "Your best friend considers subterfuge necessary to gain your help in a trial that aims to put wizards behind bars, who nearly killed you. Simply because she is convinced that you won't help otherwise. As long as these people are out there, they could harm you and most likely will, because you will continue to go after them! So, you will forgive me,
"We picked up some food and kicked George out of bed. Fortunately, Angelina attended Rose's slumber party. We ate and talked and dozed while the wireless was on. Around seven we returned to the bank and then …" messing up his hair even more, by now Harry resembled a duster, he took a moment to collect himself. What to share? What to leave out? What was too personal?
Shaking his head, Lucius explained, "I tried to steal one of your vegetables but received a nasty burn for the attempt."
Finally entering, Lucius walked to the little suite in front of the merrily crackling fire, so he could face his liege. "The librarians are running potion experiments. Narcissa supervises. There are magical creatures everywhere. I just … please, don't make me go back there, Harry."
"No," the librarian replied evenly. "But scientific journals are treated as diaries before their publication. Most likely because Merlin could not make a distinction in his time. Some of them are so interesting that I take a peek. Mind you, I barely understood yours after fifth year and stopped reading since before you even took your N.E.W.T.s, but I recognised your handwriting in the copies Draco presented as 'his' latest findings. I always wondered why he insisted on writing them on our black-board instead of merely duplicating the parchment."
The nefarious noise was back, and someone was shaking him. He wanted it to stop. The pain. The noise. The confusion. Severus felt like a lead-weight was sitting on his chest, and when he finally managed to pry his eyes open, enormous green eyes were looking at him. But those were the wrong eyes. Where was Lily? A sob silenced the noise and reality came crashing down. Lily was dead. His attempt to barter for a better position in the Dark Lord's inner circle had cost her, her life. The only thing that remained was her son, who was now leaning over Severus and attempted to soothe him.
the first picture of him," the redhead defended himself weakly, aware that he was losing ground rapidly.
Doing as he was told, Harry discovered a relief of a beautiful woman, petting a bull. It was barely larger than the palm of his hand. He wanted to reach for it, yet somehow it felt wrong to touch. "I did not know."
Teddy, however, seemed unfazed by the comment. "Good. Nana was worried that you wouldn't like her. You and your mum I mean." Turning towards the older pureblood, he shared, "She believes that you will never like her, but I don't think you don't. I like you. You're Dragon's dad, and you have pretty hair." That being said, the child climbed back up his chair and continued with his picture.
"Not you too," Hermione groaned. "We don't know the sex of the baby, and we will love it, whether it is a boy or a girl!"
Suppressing a sigh, since the young wizard was purposefully vague, she gestured towards the floo. "Shall we then?"
With a brief smile, Ginny rose and inquired, "Kreacher's still elusive, so I'll make breakfast. Anything you want?"
Back at her office, Hermione pulled out a bottle of some strange muggle spirit. It was transparent and tasted like mouthwash. She offered Lucius a glass of what she called 'Ouzo' and some orange-juice. Throughout the afternoon, she did everything in her power to convince herself to put this entire, unpleasant affair behind herself. It was evident that the injustice of it all hurt her, but she had worked long enough in the Department of Law to realise that you could not always win. And, after all, they still had another case that needed their attention. The Children of Hecate were still roaming Britain, and the pair was determined to locate or at least identify them.
Draco flinched when there was a hard knock on Severus' door, revealing Harry in full Auror garb, once it opened. "Mr Malfoy, I need to talk to you. Would you please join me."
Gesturing for her family to stay back, Narcissa shook her head before replying in a calm tone, “This is not aunt Walburga’s room any longer, no matter how much she loved it when she was alive. It is yours, Harry. You can throw out the entire furniture and replace it with rummage if you so desire, I honestly do not care. But I care about you, and in your own home, you deserve better than to be surrounded by garbage.”
an Auror after all. Why do you think the file was on top of the stack, despite the case being several weeks old?"
"He still should have known better. All three of us are at fault. We should have told him not to treat a muggle garden different than a magical one."
Reclaiming his own chair and drink, the older man commented. "For talking like that, I would have torn you to pieces at Hogwarts."
Draco needed a few more minutes to calm down. Embarrassed that the stress of the last months had finally gotten the better of him, he turned away to clean up. "Sorry, … I … I wasn't sure that I would succeed and now … it being so easy … sorry."
Stretching towards his nightstand, Harry retrieved the snitch he had inherited from Dumbledore. An artefact that now was exactly like it had been the day he had received it. Sitting up, his friend seemed confused about their change of subject, but content to wait until his smallest not-brother was ready to explain. "You got it right, you know? The tale of the Deathly Hallows. Together they make their owner the Master of Death."
“Second,” Harry continued, but interrupted himself with an exasperated, “Lucius, look at me.” Meeting his vassal’s eyes, he stated with absolute conviction. “I will never, ever, under any circumstances, use your family against you. One of you makes a mistake, that person – and that person only – suffers the consequences. I’m aware that you have a hard time catching up, but I am not Tom! I will not take it out on your wife and son if you anger me. Alright?”
"He offered himself. His life. His services. His dignity, since he claimed those were the only things still belonging to him after everything that had happened. And do you know what Harry Potter demanded, in exchange for the mere
Pulling back reluctantly, the two wizards met Astoria's eyes, who stood shoulder to shoulder with Narcissa and Lucius, protecting them. There was no judgement or reprimand in her eyes, just iron determination. After another quick peck on the blond's lips, the raven-haired shouted over the pandemonium that surrounded them, "Call for your wand!"
"A good teacher," Snape finally allowed himself to admit, "would have been able to teach them respect."
At Harry's nearly unperceivable nod, Hermione replied, "Salazar Slytherin's locket." Drawing strength from her husband's embrace, remembering the end of this particular item, she added, "Ron destroyed it with the Sword of Godric Gryffindor."
someone in Draco's corner unconditionally. The blond had had a hard-enough life after all. Yet a tiny part of him envied the unreserved support. The raven-haired nearly flinched when a warm hand touched his shoulder, turning him back around.
When a shadow fell over the blond's face, Harry confirmed, "She did and without Hermione's quick thinking and even quicker casting, he would have died in that boat-house."
other master, might have killed him. Hence, a punishment was inevitable. Also, if his father had more faith in his liege, none of this would have happened. So, Draco merely shrugged, "It's not supposed to. But I want the collar to be soft. Black leather preferably."
"Well, we'll see who will win today." Her husband challenged, before egging his horse on. The Lady was behind him in a heartbeat, leaving her confused son behind.
Rubbing his neck to get rid of the lingering tension, Harry admitted, "She's a woman on a mission. I doubt that she will join us before nightfall."
"What?" Hermione snapped irritated, not enjoying being left out. Immediately she claimed the book. "Valerian Root? All we need is Valerian Root to stabilise the damn poison?"
Eyes lighting up with long forgotten memories, the blond recalled, "And he always chose apple-juice over wine. He said it would bring out the flavours even better."
"I know. I feel most fortunate that you found us yesterday." When Narcissa started to tremble in his arms, Lucius nudged her chin up and inquired worried, "Narcissa, what is it?"
Nodding, the raven-haired gestured towards the few books he kept in his office. "If you don't want to work, feel free to help yourself to any book that strikes your fancy."
He tried, he really did, if only so she would not let go. But all he could do was produce a faint spasm. Panic set in again, but before he could get worked up, Poppy eased him. "It's alright, Severus. Just stay calm! Though you are physically fine, as far as we can tell, your body has to build up its strength again. That's perfectly normal. You were in a coma for five years. You need time to adjust."
Understanding dawned in the pale, blue eyes. The witch pulled up her hood again and indicated a bow upon rising. "I'll get back to you." Then she left.
Clenching his butter-knife for a moment, Draco nodded. "I'm aware. It's just … all this brings up a lot of bad memories."
Taking in the numbers on his alarm clock, Harry sighed contently and snuggled back under the covers. Friday! Best day of the week, in his opinion. If no lead came up, all they had to do was boring paperwork, maybe some light investigating and around one, they would head out. Lunch in the Leaky Cauldron with his friends was the best part of Harry’s week.
"Nothing," Draco confirmed, pulling Harry's hands on his chest, so the other could feel his calming breaths. "We just have to learn to trust you."
"That's … to be expected," Severus decided before gazing into the antidote. Just a few more minutes. The potion was already a milky yellowish colour. Once it was a saturated yellow, it would be ready for consumption.
"I mean …" pulling his legs up on the windowsill, the raven-haired pressed his head to his knees. Today was the first day he had been up and about, despite a brief rest after lunch. Hermione and Ron, as well as Neville and Luna, had joined them for dinner and afterwards, they had discussed Harry's ideas for the integration of muggleborn into their society from an early age. Regrettably, Lucius - in an attempt to prove his trustworthiness - had played devil's advocate, pointing out the legal flaws of every plan Harry had put on the table. On the one hand, he had been delighted to hear the pureblood contradict him, something the former Death Eater would not have done with Tom. On the other hand, it was beyond frustrating.
That, however, seemed the wrong thing to say, as the raven-haired whirled around and stormed up to him. While Narcissa flinched back, the leader of the resistance at Hogwarts held his ground, meeting his furious friend's eyes without hesitation as the other wizard hissed, "You don't want me calm, Neville Longbottom. Because then I will remember exactly who I am and what I am capable off!"
"This is hardly a random potion," the shaggy-haired wizard roared back. "And as far as I know, this is still my project! So,
But the house−elf merely looked at him, his big eyes full of concern. That was the moment, Harry heard it: a suppressed sob, intermingled with quiet whimpers. Slowly he let go of Kreacher and turned towards the noise, understanding dawning. "He told you not to tell anybody."
"Something's wrong," Charles and Neville interrupted in one voice. Interestingly, though, the two were facing in opposite directions. While Leewood was frowning at the spot where Harry had stood during the binding ritual, Neville waved his wand in the direction of a blank wall. Immediately pulling out his wand, Pince demanded, "Explain yourselves!"
Whipping around from comforting his friend, Draco demanded to know. "You seriously think he will kill her; his own wife?"
As expected, the blond curled up on 'his' side until Harry sighed and pulled him close, spooning him from behind.
"If you really think so, Christopher Pendragon, you are an even greater fool than Harry and Draco made you out to be."
Astoria shook her head and pressed her lips together, though that had to hurt her split bottom lip. She actively avoided Harry's gaze, turning her black eye and most likely broken cheek away from the young Auror.
Narcissa had just picked up two cups of tea to separate Pendragon and Mdm Pince, when a far too familiar voice drew everyone's attention. A voice that had no place in the Manor because … because the owner was dead…
"Potter, I do not appreciate being hit in the back of my head with a memo on my way home. Our case is closed, and I do have a private life, you know?"
Chuckling, Harry needled, "Hunting down someone without hard evidence … on a mere suspicion … someone would call that a 'witch hunt' and very, very wrong. If only I could remember who?"
Setting the artefact back into the centre of the circle, Harry left the ring and redressed before heading back to the house. "Well, you never mention it. So, I was worried that you might be … irritated about me drawing attention to it."
"And you promised, Uncle!" Teddy reminded him seriously, shoving his godfather's hands away to button his own jacket. "I can do that. I'm not a baby!"
Chuckling, George lifted his cup in a silent toast. "For the sake of my brother, I hope that Hermione is."
"I should not have done that," James admitted in a small voice. "Even when he did his best to protect my family, defecting from the dark side, I never had the balls to apologise."
"Harry, words will never be able to express how grateful I am for what you have done for me. Maybe I will ask you to borrow the stone in five years, or in ten or fifty or not at all. Fred made it very clear, that our talk was a one-time thing and that I better be damn grateful for every single family member who made it out of this war alive. I needed that. I'll always miss my twin. But it's okay now. I will thrive to show the rest of my family how much I appreciate them."
Prepared for his shift of vision, Harry let the stone fall into his open palm. He met the loving gaze of his mother, mirroring her smile before some movement in the corner of his eyes drew his attention. A mousy haired teenager was cowering there. His nervous eyes darted from Sirius to James to Lily and then to Remus, who was standing at the bedside as well. Something in the boy's aborted movement felt familiar, but the young Auror could not place it. Then it hit him. Furiously, he drew his wand, "What the hell is Wormtail doing here? He has no right …!"
But Harry merely shrugged, serving the rest of the breakfast. "It's not as if I can't afford it. And it's never more than one dish at a time she experiments on."
"No, I …" looking around, at all the things they had not inspected yet, Harry had decided. "Maybe just a little longer."
Then the open vial was put to his lips, and a bitter taste flooded his mouth. Something that had been there already. But that did not make any sense. He had only ever brewed one dose …
Recalling the state of Severus Snape's vaults - Harry had paid a solicitor to put his professor's affairs in order - he ordered Griphook, "Wait here, please," before motioning the older wizard to slip in through the partially opened door.
"Can he?" turning around, Teddy asked, practically bouncing on his knees. "Can Neville have breakfast with us?"
Harry was another matter entirely. However, he trusted his partner and allowed Draco to direct his every move, so they were able to follow the dance with minimal problems. Partners were switched several times, but of all the 'male' dancers, only Lucius was able to lead the young muggle-raised wizard as easily as his son. The traditional circle ended with the men kissing the 'women's'' fingers, and though Harry tried valiantly to suppress it, Ginny could spot the faint blush that coloured his cheeks, when Draco's lips actually brushed over the back of his hand. Passing George, on their way off the dance-floor, she high-fived her brother.
"She didn't," the Auror shuddered, trying to dispel the fathom smell of burning flesh. "Narcissa Malfoy neé Black is an incredibly strong and determined witch. She doesn't wait to be chosen any longer.
"It was for me," she commented absent-minded while starting to dismantle her hair slide. It was a beautiful piece of highly polished oak, it really complimented her hair, with mother-of-pearl inlays for accents. Right now, the witch wiggled free one of those inlays, revealing a small blade. It was barely longer than a scalpel and looked wickedly sharp.
Watching his injured liege, Lucius shook his head. "It is unwise to shun the pureblood society. You should reconsider this stance. Even the light families have their pride, and if you ignore them, they might turn against you."
"Draco!" Severus bellowed, barely able to keep himself from reaching for his throat when it burned up at his outburst.
"What makes you say that? You know that my offer for you to stay here does not come with an expiration date. And you only have to say a word for me to release you from your vow."
Nodding tiredly, Harry took Kreacher's hand and vanished at the snap of the elf's fingers. Rubbing his face, equally drained, Draco started to collect the notes he had spread over the coffee table. "You should get some rest, father. Lunch will be served around one."
During their hunt, but especially after starting his life with Hermione, Ron had discovered, that he had a knack for cooking. Undoubtedly a skill inherited from his mother. He managed to put decent meals on the table with but a few flicks of his wand. Hermione had been quite reluctant at the beginning, afraid that Ron would 'bring work home' so to speak. However, she could not be prouder of her husband these days. His skills had significantly expanded, and the redhead thrived to put a new spin on old dishes, making them savoury but never too exotic.
With a smile, Harry nodded. "Of course, she does, but Justin insists that all payments are covered in equal parts. He is very,
For a heartbeat, his godson opened his mouth, but then closed it again. Picking up the brush Emerald had brought, he whistled for his familiar. "Come on, girl. Let's get this carpet untangled and then curl up on my bed." Excitedly, the grey snow fox wrapped around Draco's legs, before climbing up his body. Hugging her, the young man assured her quietly, "I know, sweetheart. I have been neglecting you. But I will do better from now on. Promise."
Looking at the witch and wizards, at the table, Severus saw the wisdom of the request. "I will see to it."
"I planned for it to become a wristband. You pull it over your left hand, and it will adjust. Only you will be able to remove it."
Rolling his eyes, Neville shook his head. "We were dormmates for ten months out of twelve for six years. You could give me some credit."
The corner of Westwood Gardens and Westwood Roads was as unremarkable as the name suggested, with one exception: as soon as the Aurors and their companions had set foot on the corner estate, a concealment charm lost its effect, revealing a sizable mansion. Since, strictly speaking, Narcissa was still under house arrest, and Severus was officially deceased, the four Aurors - and Ron - approached the house alone. Once they had knocked, a tiny elf with strange eyes opened the door. "What can Ruby be doing for the Aurors?"
"Never! Neville might be angry with me, but he would never tell on you. He understands that you being here is important to me!"
"Exactly, and if you can … harmonise the intent of many people, you can achieve truly extraordinary things."
Their former head of house only had time to nod before he called out again, "Brace yourselves," Then the fog dissolved.
Serenely, Luna strolled over to where Narcissa was surrounded by three mares. "Can't you decide which one to take?"
"The snake, …" Draco shuddered, and with rising horror in his eyes, he looked back at Harry. "The snake, and you! That's why you walked into the forest … why you had to die, … for his Horcrux to die with you." Looking around, he swallowed around a constricting throat. "And this is
George and Angelina were next, and the girls instantly challenged each other over the strangest combinations of food. It seemed that the dark-skinned woman had not reached the craving's stage, yet. However, she appeared concerningly interested in a few of Hermione's favourites.
"The poison still explodes into your face as soon as it's separated from the blood?" The raven-haired pondered.
Swallowing, Harry nodded and left the room. As he was just about to close the door, he heard Narcissa sob, "I'm sorry. I am so sorry, Andi, for everything." Then a few fast−paced steps and the meshing of clothes, before the older woman soothed, "I know, Cissy, it's alright. It's over now."
Raising his hand, recalling the hex, he lowered it again the 'Saviour of the Wizarding World' relented. "I'll try. I have Lucius who helps me with the political side of things. Narcissa with the social and Andromeda with the light families I meet at various get-togethers."
"We …" the team-leader started, but closed his mouth again, since he was too caught up in his anger, he could not say for sure.
"Really, Narcissa?" Lucius took another sip. "I always thought you enjoyed that particular type. We have a vast amount of it in store."
"Once my latest niece or nephew are born, you won't have enough time to care for your family and the shop and eat and sleep in sufficient amounts. At least that's what I am told," the young redhead winked at her family. "So, we thought one last holiday would do you some good."
Slowly turning around, he spotted the youngest Weasley-Granger hiding behind the doorframe of the living room. Narrowing his eyes, he replied on a whim, "No, I am a tooth fairy."
He had just put his book on counter−curses − one of Hermione's most brilliant presents as of late − when Kreacher popped into his room. Confused when the elf didn't say anything, he wanted to know. "Is there a problem?"
Neville glared at his superior. "Now listen, Sir, what I'm about to reveal, has to stay in this office at all cost. Do I have your word?"
"How …," Lucius started, rubbing the bridge of his nose, to sort out his jumbled thoughts. "I have some reading to do. I don't have time to rest. And what were you thinking of insulting him? Need I remind you, that we are entirely dependent on his goodwill?"
Since these were all reasonable concerns, Lucius merely tilted his head, before preceding her to the Manor. On their way to his study, he could not help but ask. "To Robarts, you said that my mas… Harry made a protective parselmagic artefact for all of his friends. I assume that includes you."
Surprised, Harry noticed that Draco and Narcissa sagged in palpable relief, though they replied in one voice, "No."
Shaking his mop of unruly hair, the young man explained, "No, just the first time. I'm going to imprint it on your magical signature. After that, you, me, Emilia … everyone could close the buckle, it would still only be yours to open again."
Reluctantly Harry approached the bed and leaned against one of the elaborately carved pillars, looking down at his vassal. "I am afraid that you won't be as grateful once you learn the method I had to employ to save your husband. Or the price your son has offered for the mere effort." When she didn't reply, he continued hesitantly. "Your husband and I, … he entered the Rite of Compulsory Surrender, accepting me as his liege for the foreseeable future."
Her forgiving nature had always been one of Luna's most outstanding qualities. Briefly reaching for her hand, Harry squeezed it, smiling at his friend gratefully.
Slipping into the open-floorplan house, he came by in the middle of an argument between Molly and Hermione about the Weasleys-parents sleeping arrangements.
The late September air was fresh and crisp, reflecting on the dozen shop-windows of Diagon Alley. Even after five years, the remnants of the war were still visible in some places. However, the Wizarding World tried its hardest to heal. Buying himself a triple club sandwich and some pumpkin juice, Harry made his way down the street, towards his best mate’s shop.
After sharing but sandwiches at the Manor, because the stupid oven would not even let Harry heat soup, the two wizards returned to Grimmauld Place around five. While the Malfoys enjoyed a tranquil afternoon tea in the living−room, Harry went over the latest developments with Neville via floo. Unexpectedly the front door opened. Used to several people having a key to his place, Harry did not even look up, until a toddler with grass−green hair dashed into the room.
When the elf popped up, all wizards looked at him. "Teddy poisoned himself with wolfsbane. Severus can help, but he needs to know where the lab is."
Twenty minutes later, Neville Longbottom found Luna enjoying the spring sun while hanging upside down from the big oak tree in the back garden of Longbottom Manor. She had already changed out of her work clothes, wearing an overall and a lavender shirt with little daisies. With the golden sun illuminating her, Neville took his time to savour the moment. His beloved's golden locks were brushing over the leaves on the floor, and the happy smile on her face just added to the serenity of the scene. He mirrored her smile when he approached. "Professor Snape sends his greetings."
"Trial and error?" The young Auror gapped. "Are you telling me that sooner or later we have to start poisoning people and simply hope for the best?"
Kneeling next to the two wizards, Andromeda straightened first Teddy's and then Harry's hair and replied with a smile, "I am not talking about the money."
At that question, Astoria sat down her cutlery and used her napkin before folding her hands on the table. Narcissa would be absolutely delighted by her manners, Harry thought. "My future husband is a highly intelligent man. I do not doubt that he will draw the right conclusions, once introductions were made."
The presumed leader of the cult began wielding big words about the superiority of wizards and witches. How all magical beings were the next evolutionary step and how sacrificing one non-believer would show their goddess their determination to rid the British Isles of all vermin. Their curse would weaken and ultimately destroy all muggles, and Great Britain would be a paradise for all magical beeings. And so on and so forth. Had Harry not needed his entire concentration to cast a protective dome, he would have rolled his eyes. Still, he could not allow himself to become side-tracked. The last rays of sunlight were dying, indicating that the time of the sacrifice had nearly come.
Puzzled by the sudden change of subject, Harry shrugged. "Social standing, etiquette, proper addressing, these sorts of things. Neville says that if he's my partner, he won't let me humiliate him due to ignorance, no matter if I'm the Boy-Who-Lived or not."
Taking a steadying breath, Narcissa nodded and then prompted, "Now, let us see if we have some old armour around. I distinctively remember your grandfather being partial to dragon-leather outfits, Lucius."
Still, he - the battle-hardened Auror - had to keep himself from flinching when his mother's eyes found his.
When Astoria shook her head, Harry dared to reach out and lay but a finger on the young witch's hand. As horrible as it sounded, he counted it as a win when she did not startle violently at the gesture. In a sure voice, he swore, "I can protect you, Astoria. You won't have to get back to him. I promise!"
home seemed to always be at the heart of strange plots and secret gatherings. Not that Lucius or she could do anything about it. She was well aware that - though Harry had allowed her to choose - he was the one with the power over all of their assets, at least for the time being. Somehow, that made her feel a little better. If Harry Potter approved, surely nothing bad would happen. Right? At least this time their 'guests' planned to help and not destroy half of their society.
"Remus …" Harry whispered, clutching the table in front of him. The man had lost two of his best friends through the betrayal of another, that night. He had lost his family as much as Harry had if his stories were to be believed. Still, he had remembered to save James' and Lily's wands from possible raiders and gold-diggers. Had kept them safe for Harry to find more than twenty years later.
Neither of them liked to put everything on one card, but they were out of options. So Harry nodded and Neville started to count, "Three … two … one," throwing every last bit of magic behind the shield-spell, while his partner tapped the stone above their heads and hissed, ~
Ignoring the incredulous looks of his fellow Aurors at the dead man walking, the brunet nodded. "Alright, let's relocate to Grimmauld Place. We'll fill you in there. Harry, look around Hermione's office. Take Ron with you. As you've pointed out before, the two of you know her best."
"Auror Longbottom," the witch pulled back her hood. This time, her hair was a blinding white and shone like woven silk. Her eyes were of the palest blue like chips of ice. "I'm afraid I don't have much time. Please, ask your questions."
At that, the witch downright chuckled and tilted her head. "Fortunately, my father's opinion is not something I have to concern myself with."
George had always been absurdly grateful for Harry yelling at Molly and Arthur during their second Christmas after The Battle. The burrow had been unbearably suffocating for George, everybody treating him like glass whenever there was even a hint of his missing twin. Harry had watched him, all of them, until the raven-haired had lost his temper around midnight.
consider most important could be of no interest to you. As I said, look him up and try to find out if there is something about him that speaks to you."
Together with my eternally helpful, patient and overall amazing betareader topgngoose, we managed to have another chapter ready for you. This is for all of ye of little faith, who would ever think that Harry would take something as precious from Draco as a stone on a string ;). Enjoy.
Dejected the man stepped back, raising his hands in surrender. For a minute, both hovered in suspension, Lucius barely dared to breathe, before Harry hissed, "Get out of my sight!" Then the man fled.
"Actually," Christopher Pendragon explained, "My line descends from both. Merlin was the last Dragon-Lord, and the 'Pendragons' descended from an ancient clan of warriors-chieftains. Their magic was weak, I mean squib-level weak, but it was there. So together Arthur and Merlin were able to create a new bloodline. We are bound to this library, the guardians of these treasures and usually one member per generation feels the call of the sword. If he or she can pick it up, they become the new librarian."
Clearly not liking this one bit, Ron asked mulishly. "Why make Neville head of the investigation and not you? No offence, Nev, but nobody knows Hermione better than you and me."
He had passed Russia; visited Durmstrang and Victor Krum once the season was over. The former champion of the Triwizard's Tournament had invited Harry into his own home, and over the course of an extended weekend, they had drunken several bottles of vodka and reminiscence about times passed. That weekend Harry learned that Hermione was pregnant. He was giggling through the entire fire-call and tears had started streaming down his eyes when she showed him a blurry ultrasound picture of a little blob he could not even identify. He wanted to return home that night, but his best friend had – sensible as always – told him to continue his journey and that the baby was not due until next spring.
"No," Lucius shook his head, "as far as I know, her girlfriend served as her chambermaid. Her skill in healing magic and discretion are the only reasons she was able to stay at the Rosier house for so long, and that Astoria is still alive. All in all, I would consider it a quite advantageous arrangement. No matter the children, we will never have to worry about a Malfoy heir not being of Malfoy blood."
"Yes," the Minister nodded. "And one day I hope to include you to that list. I am trying to lead this country out of the Dark Ages. Though it helps to have Harry Potter and his friends' innovative ideas on my side, I am not one to heap the responsibility for our entire world on the shoulders of a boy his age. It's time that he wakes up and does what makes
For a moment, the young witch seemed to contemplate putting up a fight, but - since she could not take her eyes off the sword - she sooner rather than later recognised the blade. Her hand began to tremble as she lowered her wand. Barely audible, she whispered, "That's Excalibur, the sword of … who, by Merlin, are you?"
Looking from liege to vassal and back again, Narcissa suggested, "It might be better if we depart as well. With your permission, Harry, we will return for dinner."
Studying the crowd, while walking the perimeter, Harry had no trouble identifying the witch. She was surrounded by a throng of people. "I have a bad feeling about this," he mumbled while claiming his allotted place.
Maybe Andromeda Tonks was right. Perhaps it was time to return to the land of the living. This way, he could at least do something useful until he had decided what he wanted for the rest of his life.
Looking at his partner, the brunet suggested, "That we should be cautious about what happens the same time tomorrow. Time turners are dangerous. These people could very well catch us in a loop, without us even knowing until they get the outcome they want."
Summoning a box, he hesitantly handed it over. "I did not have time to wrap it. I found it in my parents' vault and thought you might like it."
"No, mate," his best friend shrugged easily. "You just look like death warmed over and either you lie down and recover, or I will drag you back to St. Mungos, Malfoy included."
"Yes, I …," the young mage hesitated. "I thought … I mean … I know you always cover it with your sleeve. It's just … I needed something inconspicuous, and I thought the general public would not wonder about something like this."
"And lastly," Hermione spoke over both of them, "Ste… Sandorn abused the trust we placed in him as a Department. All of us leave our wand on or in our desk on occasion. We have to, because of the Department's Regulations. But though we have drawers with locks, barely anyone bothers to actually engage them. He broke our trust …
"Because we all know how much times goes into knitting jumpers for seven children plus extended family," Percy admitted sheepishly.
I'm currently on holiday with my family, and it's brilliant! Sun all day long, a pool, too much food and wine, basically I'm in heaven. Still, I remembered to prepare a chapter for you in advance, so enjoy :).
In a heartbeat, the sword was back in Pendragon's hand, levelled at the witch with a steady arm. "Don't threaten me, Miss Greengrass, you wouldn't like the person I become."
Reluctantly putting his hand over her middle, the pureblood promised, "We won't let that happen, and neither will they. Children are the most precious in our world. No matter what happens, they will not endanger your child."
had he not forgotten that Ginny had nearly died because of that cursed diary. But Harry had had his back, or Ginny's, back in second year. He had saved them and had suffered more from Lucius' actions than any other member of the Weasley family. So, if Harry could give the guy a chance, so could George. That, and if 'former Lord Malfoy' ever stepped another toe out of line, George had gotten so much better with spells and potions over the last few years. The wizard would not even know what had hit him! Hence, he interrupted the quarrel between the two Aurors with a calm, "I think I might be able to help."
"No, but I think we might be able to find one rotten fruit or the other under the surrounding bushes or foliage. Then we floo Longbottom to learn about the best way to extract the seeds, and then we plant every last one of them. At least a few are bound to sprout."
Looking at the wizard who had claimed an armchair near the window, Harry shrugged, "Of course, they are, as you very well know. But wards are an entirely different thing."
Chuckling, Neville gestured towards a small plant at the side, "Your Lupines introduce a high amount of nitrogen into the soil. To benefit from this effect, you need plants that thrive in nitrogen-enriched earth. Roses do. But if Charlie is concerned about your kit hurting itself, we can find an alternative. Strawberries are great, and I think your little fox will like them."
take your advise into consideration when I'm acting on your behalf. In return, I will trust you that you won't subjugate me. Because let me tell you, Lady Malfoy, that would not go over well."
Biting his lips, to keep himself from laughing, Harry needed a few moments to school his features, before he managed to ask with a straight face, "Draco needs his dress-robes and toiletries."
Not even the seasoned teller could entirely hide his grin at the back-handed compliment. Once they had arrived in front of the vault - a different one from last night - he assured, "Since only vaults of the sacred twenty-eight are in this area, discretion is our first and foremost concern. No supervision spells are active in this area."
"Well," the pureblood rose. "We might not be able to do much, but at least I can try to make his job easier by helping to outlaw these 'Children of Hecate'. If he has his colleagues at his back, and these fanatics off the streets, he will be a little better protected."
Laughing out loud at Draco's indignant anger, Harry explained, "Because Foxglove can't be arsed to even look at the owlery I have renovated just for him, after he arrived at No 12 Grimmauld Place. He rejects the cage as well as the perch I have installed in my bedroom and in the office. Kreacher draws the line at having him in the kitchen. The only compromise we all could agree upon was Fox sleeping in the garden. He does not even let me feed him. He accepts the occasional treat, especially around a delivery, but hunting for himself seems to be a matter of pride."
The meal turned out a quiet affair. Ron put the old wireless on a shelf in a kitchen, and the entire family enjoyed a more or less calm breakfast while listening to Christmas Songs. Mostly the peaceful atmosphere could be attributed to the fact that Narcissa threatened the adults with decaffeinated beverages, should they not behave, and Andromeda zapped the kids with colourful sparkles when they reached for the cookies before their plates had been cleared.
Seeing the distress his words had caused, James had apologised, "I am sorry. I did not mean to bring up painful memories."
Yet, before Draco could defend his little she-devil, Harry's words were mirrored from the living-room. A moment later, Kingsley wandered into the kitchen, holding an excited Inari at the scruff of her neck. "This little beast tried to chew off my ear. Care to tell me what that's about?"
"I am sure it is delicious," Narcissa offered, serving her husband and herself, before taking a small bite.
Draco suppressed a shiver when the magic activated around his wrist. Still, he nodded gratefully, though he wanted to claw the offending band off his arm. He was so tired of being shackled. Be it by jewellery or a trice damned tattoo. But Harry tried so hard to give them a pleasant Yule. Therefore, Draco forced a smile and left it alone. The unwanted jewellery flew from his mind as soon as he stepped through to the burrow. Instantly, Molly Weasley was upon him, hugging him while guiding him to the kitchen.
"Narcissa, Lucius," Harry whispered placing the tray of soup on the bedside table. When the couple hastily tried to free themselves from the comforter, obviously embarrassed to be caught in such an intimate position, he stilled their movements. "Relax, please. We still have time before we leave for Grimmauld Place. I just thought you two should eat something."
"True," Harry conceded with a smile. "Arthur and Molly are but loving parents who had it rough all their lives and had little but morals and their devotion to their family. No matter how you look at it, they
Studying the house-elf, who clearly seemed torn between conflicting loyalties, Draco folded his arms before his chest and glared down at him. "Do you know what happens to house-elves who snitch on their house-guests?"
"It is completely safe!" The blond insisted. "I did my research, just like you taught me. Nothing in there is even remotely toxic and the reciprocal effects between the ingredients are neglectable."
Narcissa, on the other hand, turned around and pricked her pinkie with one of her hairpins. Pressing the welling blood against her name in the tree, she declared, “I am Narcissa Malfoy nee Black. From this day on, as one of the last living members of our blood-line, I take responsibility for the Black family tree.”
Children were most precious, especially to a pure-blood like Draco. With most Ancient and Noble Houses struggling for even one heir, due to inbreeding, it was unthinkable for a Malfoy to put an unborn child at risk. While the Weasleys were a fertile bunch, surely at least Ron would know that.
"Anyway, I'll try to sort this out, Neville. Roberts gave me the next week off, but I'll floo you, alright?"
"Very sure," the young wizard chuckled. "But bids might be made for a week of studying it. With a guarantee that no harm befalls it of course, and that it is returned to me in the same condition it was handed over."
"Requirement of what?" Charles asked confused, but Harry and Neville merely brushed the question aside and took up positions, closing their eyes.
Raising his eyebrows, Severus challenged, "Other masters would be a lot more liberate in their … affections. Considering what my godson has told me about your … performance at the Yule Ball at the Ministry, you heavily insinuated such an arrangement to the general public."
The disdain was so heavy in the Potion Master's voice, the tone so very familiar, that a tear ran down Narcissa's cheek. "So, you make a habit of reading people's most private thoughts?"
"Apologies. But I thought the two of you drifted apart after your Lily started to hang out with Potter and his crowd."
Putting down his breakfast, cleaning himself with the napkins Harry always brought in abundance, the young Auror studied his partner before bringing a certain fact to attention. "You are aware that her target was Draco and not you."
Chuckling wetly, Hermione shook her head, safe in the comfortable embrace of her two best friends. "Definitely not."
Having scrambled out from under the table, where yet another tower of cutlery seemed to be in the making, Emerald studied the vial with her head tilted to the side. Her face was scrunched up in concentration, until she giggled and jumped up and down, clapping her hands in excitement. "Pretty!"
"Sir is Sirius Black's godson. But Master Black was banished from the family, his name in the tree was burned!" He wailed, banging his head against the table. "We are not to speak of him in this house ever again! Bad Kreacher!"
Trying to take a deep breath, to expel the dust from his lungs, Harry winched from pain. Inspecting the back of his head, he hissed when it hurt like hell and his fingers came back sticky. Knowing his luck, the young Auror resigned himself to yet another laceration and possibly a concussion, judging from the way his brain throbbed. Still, they had more pressing matters to attend to. "Why?"
In the evening all inhabitants of Grimmauld Place merely picked at their dinner. Immediately after, they retreated to the living-room to unwind with some fire whiskey.
"Well, …" the wizard defended himself, "after five years of coma, I was not fit for polite company. The first few weeks were …" Before he could admit to his embarrassing lack of coordination, or the inability to even speak, excited voices from the door drew his attention. One, he did not recognise. The other, however, belonged to his godson.
Pulling the young witch close, he soothingly rubbed her back. "It's okay, Hermione. I know you had no such intention. It's fine, really. I've had worse. The spell must be on the dishes and cutlery."
Folding his arms in front of his chest defensively, when Draco slapped them away from his head, Harry shrugged. "You were scared to death; convinced that Tom would be back. I saw no other way."
A few minutes later, a doe and a terrier faded into existence before Neville. "On my way," they replied in unison.
Thousand days of the same question and thousand days of receiving the same answer. Morose, Harry sank down in his chair at the head of the table, accepting his house-elf’s, “Dinner will be ready in a moment,” with a simple, “Thank you, Kreacher.”
Swaying slightly when he let the magic drop, Harry regained his posture after a mere heartbeat, looking towards his superior, pleading, "Sir, I need to … Draco …"
Slowly turning around, Severus spotted the youngest Weasley-Granger hiding behind the doorframe of the living room. Narrowing his eyes, he replied on a whim, "No, I am a tooth fairy."
"Soul magic …," the shaggy-haired wizard groaned. "Nasty stuff, especially when abused!" Pulling his sword, he gestured for Neville and Harry to join him. "Let's see what we can do." He gestured for the two Aurors to put their hands on the hilt of Excalibur and explained, "First we cast Tergeo, then Scourgify."
When Harry merely looked at his hands, mumbling something incomprehensible, his former professor prompted, "Speak up!"
Putting a steadying hand on his companion's shoulder, since he could feel the tension radiating off of him, Harry looked at his former teacher, the former Death Eater, the former spy. "Sir, do you know what the Rite of Compulsory Surrender is?"
Ashamed, Harry looked down again and whispered, "Sometimes, I even wished you were my godfather because at least you were there …"
After an endless minute, where the former Lord barely dared to breathe, his wife agreed reluctantly. “Yes, my Lord.” Clearly, Narcissa knew that something was going on, but decided to follow Potter’s order not to get involved.
Lucius Malfoy was guiding Hermione Weasley. He cut an impressive figure in the high-collared, midnight-blue robes Theodore Nott had designed for him. The former Lord had forgone all embellishments save the heavy chain around his throat and the walking stick his liege had gifted him, the day of the Lostrife-trial.
Ten minutes later, Hermione was chewing on her bottom lip, stepping up to her books. “I don’t think we can prove that Mister Malfoy doesn’t deserve the Dementor’s Kiss. He has done all the horrible things they accused him off, after all. But maybe, I have an idea that could help. I just have to check something.”
Harry was just serving the bacon and eggs when he felt a cold breeze running over his back. Putting the empty pan into the sink, he excused himself. "I'll be back in a minute." Taking a deep breath at the bottom of the stairs, he made his way up to the third floor.
Severus hovered at the door, just outside of the child's line of sight. Calmly he inquired, "What is it?"
After receiving a confirming nod from the young witch, Narcissa revealed, "Astoria already lost two babies. I am not convinced that she can keep up her end of the bargain." Though she spoke calmly, merely stating the facts, her fingers in her lap were clenched so tightly that her knuckles turned white.
When Andromeda came to call them to dinner, Teddy had been curled up on the small of the other wizard's back, snoring subdued. With a quiet chuckle, the witch had picked up a piece of parchment and had just started to weave a spell, when a muffled voice stated indignantly, "If you take a picture of me in such an unbecoming position, I will sue you."
Smiling ever so slightly, Neville revealed, "I proposed, and Luna said 'yes'. At that moment, I felt on top of the world. A corporeal Patronus hasn't been a problem since."
But … well … maybe … just in case, Draco decided he should concentrate more on potions and less on his pet. He could decrease the time he wasted on playing with her. Only twenty minutes in the morning and in the evening. Maybe a few minutes around teatime. He could use them to train her better when Emerald inevitably forced him away from his notes to eat or drink or take a break or any other nonsense that interrupted his work. If she didn't bother Harry, he would surely forget what a nuisance she could be. She was young after all. Barely half a year old. Her pelt was just now going grey, and she seemed to slim down, losing her winter fur. He would start cleaning up after her. Some days, his room looked like something furry had exploded there, hair literally on every surface. Harry usually respected Draco's privacy and did not enter without invitation. But why take a risk? A quick cleaning charm; a reminder to Kreacher to remove any traces of hair laying around; an order to Emerald to gather all of Inari's toys. Then he could take his time and concentrate on the Wolfsbane Potion for Teddy. He had to find a solution. Had to be useful. Otherwise, what was the point of him being here …
"Terrified of losing those most precious to him," a calm voice at his back replied to his unspoken question.
"You were shaking," Emilia contradicted him sharply. "You were able to move your head, and when Mr Potter was lending you his voice, you were able to cast a summoning spell. A 'normal' wizard might have survived, but only because his core would have … sustained him, so to speak. But in doing that …"
"Give me a chance," he whispered, closing his eyes, trying to reach out. "Please … I don't want to violate his privacy or steal what is his. It's just … his research is my last resort. If anybody ever has a chance to find an antivenom to Nagini's poison, it's him! He's not dead yet, but seeing him, lying motionless in his bed, day in and day out … having to move his body, having others put their hands on him so his muscles won't diminish completely. He would hate that! Hate how weak he has become. He has such a strong mind. I want to believe that … need to believe it, because what would have been the point of it all otherwise? He should be at St. Mungos or another clinic, but Poppy was right the day of the battle. Nobody would ever take care of him the way we can. Because nobody would ever understand the ordeals he had put himself through. He never had a chance at Hogwarts because all that counted for something in Slytherin were purity of blood and money. Nobody but Tom understood his ambitions, how he was determined to overcome is 'lacks' with hard work and ingenuity. And once Snape saw the Inner Circle for what it was … saw Voldemort for what he was … well, he had lost his chance with them too."
And though that was comforting yet no guarantee for success, Molly very well knew that she could not stop her children. Ron had been willing to follow Harry, ever since their first year. And Hermione … well, she had always been the brain of their operations. Harry needed her; needed his best friends to save the one he loved. If she were entirely honest to herself, were Arthur in danger, she would do exactly the same.
Hesitant, since he could not think of anything of common interest between Harry and himself, Severus pushed back the lid. His fingers started trembling when he took the first magazine out of the box. 'Potion Practisers - A Magazine for Master and Apprentice', May 2005. Directly beneath it, he found the edition of April, March, February, January, December 2004 … 2003 … 2002 … the last magazine in the seemingly bottomless box was dated January 1997. Overwhelmed, Severus looked at the young man, who smiled sheepishly while trying to keep about a hundred issues of one magazine from slipping down to the floor.
Molly, however, shook her head decidedly. "Absolutely not, dearie. You went through all the trouble to invite the family. The least we can do is let you sleep in your own bed!"
Reaching for Draco's throat, allowing his fingertips to travel the expanse of the creamy skin, Dolohov mocked, "Did you have to offer your heir for Potter to take the deal?"
At Neville's suggestion, Kreacher wrapped his tiny arms around himself and started rocking. "No. Kreacher is a good elf," he rambled hoarsely. "He can do as he is told. The Master said to stop and stay there. Kreacher stopped. Kreacher was a bad elf. Not able to find Master's servants. But Kreacher is being good now. Kreacher stopped. Kreacher is a good elf!"
"I am!" Lightening his grip on the bond's wrist, the raven-haired started to rub soothing circles over the skin. "Don't worry, Draco. Not about something like this. Everything will be fine. But now I have to go." Harry was nearly out of the door when Draco threw him another vial.
With a contemplating gesture, the older wizard leaned back. He could not fault his godson for his conviction, since he shared that particular view. He had been the one to insist on paying rent for a room that had come free for these last five years. "While I agree, do you really think the best way to do that, is working yourself to the bone, neglecting your familiar
"Ever since he saved me, he was compassionate and kind and…and I…" Trailing off, the pureblood gazed at his wife, only to find her frowning at his feet. "Narcissa!"
"And is going to hate it," he finished for her. Messing up his hair, Harry sighed. "I wish I could spare him the humiliation of being dependant on someone else, even for the simplest tasks. But to be perfectly honest, I don't really care."
Ginny's voice pulled Draco out of an uneasy sleep. Looking around, he gathered that he must have dozed off on the landing. Taking in the redhead, he noticed the boxers and shirt she had undoubtedly fleeced from Potter and swallowed a retort of her being here as well. It would be of no use since they both knew that she belonged to Potter's Inner Circle.
Yet, as was expected of him, Lucius Malfoy served the lawyer he stood by, even answered the occasional question himself. In the end, Stephen Sandorn was convicted of obstruction of justice and banned from ever practising law again. He was sentenced to make reparations for those who had been unjustly sentenced to Azkaban due to his bias and lies, though of course they did not phrase it like that. The exact amount would be decided upon when the number of witches and wizards affected could be determined. Lucius could feel Hermione fuming in the stands, and Lady Talbot did not seem any better off, though she was able to conceal her ire.
When Astoria confirmed that with a nod, his partner continued, "When did you meet Mr Draco Malfoy, Lady Rosier? As far as I know, he is still residing exclusively at Grimmauld Place."
Shrugging, Harry stated, "Well, I thought that maybe the last year before the battle, you might not have had time to keep up with the latest developments of your trade. A few editions are missing, mainly spring of 1998 because the publisher's headquarters were destroyed. The first edition after the battle contains an obituary for you, detailing all of your achievements. That was not long after you had received the Order of Merlin 2
Picking up the book Draco had left behind; Severus Snape shook his head. "Belladonna and Skullcap in the same potion? Foolish boy!" Skullcap needed an acidic base that would destroy all beneficial properties of Belladonna. But Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black had always been exceptionally good with poisons, as had her sister Narcissa been. However, the later had turned her attention towards the healing arts, even at Hogwarts. Bella, on the other hand, had been feared when she held a stirring rod. Also, Severus doubted that Draco had the slightest interest in discussing his topic of research with his mother. The man could only hope that the boy was smart enough not to discuss it with Harry either.
Angrily, Harry whipped out his wand and weaved it over the shards of the broken cup. Since Roberts lost his temper at least once every few days – being Head Auror for the Ministry of Magic was a difficult job  – every Auror could cast the Reparo spell in his sleep after working here for a few weeks. Slamming the cup back on the desk, he snarled. “Bringing Death eaters to justice is my job, Sir. And since Malfoy had been sentenced to five years in Azkaban, as his entire family has aided me in the fight against Tom Riddle, I fail to see the justice in starving them, sentencing them to psychological torture and him receiving the Kiss for the simple reason that our prison is overflowing!”
So now, Lucius was looking forward to spending a weekend with his radiant wife. Maybe even entice her to accompany him on a walk through their gardens and a picknick by the little lake his mother had loved. Just the two of them, away from prying eyes with but their slowly recovering white peacocks for company. The birds had been smart enough to flee when Voldemort had taken refuge at Malfoy Manor and - according to Narcissa - had only returned two years after the war - with some blue and green streaks in their feathers, it seemed that they had not bred only amongst themselves. However, for a carefree picknick to happen, he and Mrs Granger had to get through one last interview today. A muggleborn, associated with the Children of Hecate was in for questioning. Lucius did not have a lot of hope to gain new insight, but was determined to be as thorough as possible and exhaust all venues. After all, this group had harmed his liege!
Aware that protesting would be futile, Draco pulled Harry close, wrapping his arm around the other’s waist to guide him. Since Ginny was just bounding down the stairs and the blond wanted to have a word before she left for the apothecary, he turned away from his patient, as the other man opened the door to his office.
"After You- … Voldemort returned, it was just mother, father and I light the candles in my parents' bedroom. We used to pray:
"Though I am sure I would look quite lovely in a yellow dress," the blond referred to a photo Harry had in his office of his best friends attending some kind of garden party. Then he brushed off the topic and inquired, "What colour would you prefer?"
Aurors were coming up to them, scrutinising the scene, "Mrs Granger, would you tell us what is going on? You are aware that it is frowned upon to cast a spell in the Atrium?"
Once Harry and Lucius were alone, the young wizard reclaimed his seat and studied the gasping man. Apparently, the spell was meant to punish but not to harm, since the pureblood was still conscious. However, the former Lord seemed to be bound quite effectively, unable to defend himself, should his liege decide to retaliate for the attack. Recalling the details of what Hermione had told him about the Rite, Harry slowly raised his wand and brushed over his trembling vassal's neck. The magical choke-hold lessened gradually, allowing Lucius to breathe freely once again. The liege permitted the other to gather his composure and to think about what he had done. The platinum-haired seemed to curl into himself, until the invisible bindings seemed to be the only thing holding up his trembling body. After a while, he choked, "I am sorry, my Lord, I thought …"
Harry considered explaining that it was a muggle-magical-device from work, but since that did not matter at the moment he merely nodded.
Squeezing his eyes shut, the blond shook his head. “No,” he admitted quietly. “But I would really prefer you letting me sleep alone, instead of looming over me like I’m some prized possession.”
"I will," the young man promised, before he added with a smile. "And thank you, for giving me the chance to help."
Checking the enchantment on the coat, George really had a gift for these, Harry left a little note before bundling up the fabric. He left through the shop, thumbing it close. Those two would be useless for the next few hours, ironing out the last flaws in their latest product.
Snape interrupted him hoarsely. "Lily had these made for your father's seventeenth birthday. They are white gold with her letters engraved into the backside. I don't think you'll find anything in your parent's vault as valuable as these."
Reluctantly, Hermione and Harry followed; Draco a quiet sentinel at their backs. Nobody said a word when, one after the other, they prepared for bed. Emerging from the tiny bathroom, that was part of the tent - honestly, the pureblood could not even fathom to survive in such sub-standard living conditions, never mind having the capacity to plan the downfall of the darkest wizard of all, as these three Gryffindors had been able to - he noticed the electrical candle, that stood on a small stool between the two enlarged beds.
"We don't even know what they are researching. So, we can't consult with anybody to gain further insight." Charles pondered.
Looking from the Potion Master to the Lady Malfoy and back again, he commented drily, "Hard to accuse a dead man of murder. Mr Potter, I expect you to rectify Potion Master Snape's status come morning."
Having stood close to the Malfoys, only Harry could spot the surprise on his vassal's face. He smiled gratefully at Arthur for reaching out to a man who had offered him nothing but contempt in the past. Harry had been hesitant to have the pure-blood family under his care join him tonight. But both the patriarch and the matriarch of the Weasley clan had promised that they were ready to bury old grudges in favour of having people important to Harry with them tonight. Now, the young wizard was glad, when Lucius indicated a respectful bow and replied evenly, "I would be honoured," before he joined the sea of redheads and his sister-in-law.
During dinner at Grimmauld Place, the four Aurors, as well as Snape and the Lady Malfoy discussed the intricacies of the case.
"No … I mean yes!" Harry exclaimed, shaking his head. "I have no problem with Inari. She's a sweet thing. I'm just worried that something in the garden might be bad for her. Basil certainly is not harmful to foxes," he pointed at the corresponding field on the map. "But Draco just said that's not basil."
Then they enjoyed a companionable breakfast. For once, luck seemed to be on their side, since Robarts only stormed their office after they had finished.
For a few minutes neither spoke. Instead they soaked up the peaceful atmosphere of the unusually warm spring evening.
"Yes, … No, … Maybe?" Messing up his hair, not seeing the tender gaze Lily gave James at the all too familiar gesture, he sighed. "Maybe not now?"
"This artefact belongs to the Library!" Christopher Pendragon bristled, but Alexander Pince secured it in a belt-pouch. "And it will be returned to the Library, as soon as everything is back to normal. Do your research, Mr Pendragon. No more shortcuts. We will support you to the best of our abilities, but I cannot allow you to interfere like this again. Messing with time is dangerous, and your research now expands beyond these walls."
"Of course, I am," Draco admitted as if his longing gaze and his worshipful handling of the tome had not been sign enough.
It might have been adorable to see Harry perk up, as soon as Severus was addressing him. For now, they had sat more or less in companionable silence, after the young man had outlined his day. If someone had told Severus a few years ago that he would feel content sitting with the son of his former enemy, he would have called them delusional, maybe even insane enough to earn themselves a nice little padded cell in St. Mungo's with daily therapy sessions. But during the last few days, where the young wizard had tentatively opened up to him - most likely due to the lack of scanting remarks on his part - he had discovered that he started to look forward to their conversations, nearly as much as the hour after lunch he shared with Draco. Regrettably, his chosen words had been true. He 'had' to make this request, no matter how humiliating the outcome. Severus had not been able to think of a better way, to show that he was willing to bury their past and accept Potter's … Harry's help in the future. Hopefully, that would allow him to return the favour. He had promised to care for the boy, and while he might not have done the best job in Hogwarts, the more he recently got to know Lily's son, the more he was determined to succeed from now on.
"None of your business," Christopher tried to brush off her question, but even he flinched when a furious Daphne pointed her wand at him and growled menacingly, "Make it my business! This all seems very shady, and I have half a mind to apparate to the ministry and call in a full Inquisition Squad!"
"No, Padfoot escaped but … barely a year later, he died anyway because I … because Voldemort tricked me and I made a mistake." Scrubbing his face roughly, Harry forced out harshly, "I am sorry, dad. I should have paid better attention. Thought it through … Voldemort, he just … he put these images into my head. All I could think about was Sirius being in danger and that I had to save him. Had I taken a step back, reflected on the situation …"
At last, Charlie opened his eyes. He had revelled in the first rays of sunshine, washing over his face. Now he concluded in a firm tone.
"And if you had gotten her pregnant straight after Hogwarts, or after you've returned from your soul-searching, do you think that you could have raised happy children?"
So, I will change this story into a series, though I can't predict when the second part will even start.
The next year, Harry had returned from his gap-year just in time for Halloween. Being a mother and freshly appointed barrister at the Ministry had taken its toll on Hermione. Therefore, she had been the one to break down. In the year 2000, Harry had just lost a young muggleborn witch to a vicious Death Eater attack. Somehow, the world was not becoming a better place. It was still full of people that considered their blood-status more important than anything else. Humans and witches and wizards alike had that overwhelming ability for cruelty, viciousness, and pride and that tore Harry to pieces.
"Exactly," Harry confirmed, clasping Alexander's hand, while Neville bound them. Then he turned towards their colleague. "We can find someone else. You would just have to leave for about an hour."
His last stop had been South America. He had port keyed to Rio, but as soon as he had set foot in the city, something had pulled him into the jungle. He had bought supplies, and since he had an enchanted tent in his bag, he had no trouble to find a place to sleep, wherever he stopped for the night. Transfiguring it, so he could hang it in a tree, rather than set it up on the ground – something he had learned in Australia – he had felt safe enough to sleep unguarded. He learned to cast more than the essential wards when he woke one day to a horde of monkeys going through his food supplies.
Looking at his patient, the young man noticed the tears that were already gathering in his patient's eyes. But at Harry's inquisitive look, Snape merely gave a miniscule nod, before drinking in the sight of his childhood friend like a starved man.
The young pureblood had washed away his make-up twice to make sure it was applied correctly. Now he was hovering in the middle of the room, prepared to sink to his knees at a moment's notice. He did not want to risk punishment. Especially not since Lady Blackwood had left the riding crop in the middle of the table as a reminder. This morning, she had offered him tea, before conducting his 'training' and to Draco's ever-mounting horror, he had gotten hard despite her lashes.
