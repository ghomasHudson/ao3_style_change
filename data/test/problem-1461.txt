Draco always liked to wake up earlier than him and today was no exception. Harry cracked one eye open, a moan already forming in the back of his throat before he could fully awaken. He looks down and sees a large figure hovering above his crotch underneath the blanket. Draco must be in a stellar mood this morning for him to be waking Harry up with such a pleasant morning surprise.
“You’re still drugged?” Merlin, how much of that stuff did George use? Low-grade or not, not even Harry, the most powerful wizard alive, could resist more than three drops.
Harry barks out a laugh. Appropriate then. “No, not like me.” Draco nods, trying to keep his disappointment from breaking him. Harry shakes his hands vigorously in an attempt to backtrack. “No! Not like that, I just mean that I’m not gay, just bisexual.”
Scorpius smiles ruefully. “Enjoyed may be a bit of an exaggeration.” Draco rolls his eyes, smiling back at him. Merlin, it was going to dull in the house when Scorpius leaves for Hogwarts.
Scorpius looked up at his father, who was glaring at the city around them as if someone might jump out of the shadows and attack them in a moment’s notice. They were two Pureblood wizards deep in Muggle London and Draco was trying his best not to let his past prejudices cloud his judgment. Still, he was in unchartered territory— he can’t help but feel on edge.
“10 points from Gryffindor for talking in class Potter!” Snape bellows from the other side of the room.
“None of you thought to say, ‘Hey Harry, we think you have a massive crush on Draco? Maybe you should do something about it?’”
“You’re a good dad Malfoy. I’ll see you on Friday for the meeting, yeah?” He turns into the room to collect his pretend werewolf son before Draco could react to his unprecedented praise.
Draco smiles, hesitant and unsure if he’s allowed to do so. “I bet that was quite a shock.” His younger self is sneering in delight that Harry actually does have an Achilles Heel, but his older, smarter self remembers that he doesn’t need to be aching with spiteful elation, they weren’t in competition anymore. Unless there was another biscuit sale.
His strong hands stir, mix, whisk the contents with such precision that Draco’s fairly confident that the resulting food will be far better than anything he could produce. Though it would be fairly easy for almost anyone to best him in culinary skillfulness.
“Ron and Harry used to joke between them that we were carbon copies of each other because of how similar we behaved. Can you believe that?”
Draco nods because hell bloody yes he agreed. Areum says nothing, her eyes fixated on the chalkboard ahead and her fingers drumming rapidly against her wheelchair arm.
funny. Potter is ridiculous.” More like a self-absorbed arse, as he eloquently told Pansy over tea last week.
Draco digs his thumb nail into the soft flesh of his forefinger. He was overreacting. This was Blaise, his best friend. The same Blaise that he could tell everything to before they even went to Hogwarts. Straight or not, he wouldn’t think any less of him.
There’s silence, uncomfortable and deafening in its stoic loudness. He wants to leave so badly, go back to London, to his home, his real home, and fall asleep in Harry’s bed. France was nothing like how he left it. The person he left in the study and the kitchen isn’t the same either.
“Draco?” Harry’s examining him nervously like just might detonate if touched wrong. Yet he risks brushing his arm with a light finger and Draco remembers why he was here in the first place.
Draco’s face burns when he looks down and sees a sliver of black pants peeking out from his grey trousers. He looks up and Potter’s walking away, the sound of his laughter echoing in the nearly empty hallway.
She holds up her wand, the tip illuminated from a bright Lumos for an entire ten seconds before it begins flickering in the darkness. “No, I came here because I needed advice. I think the solar eclipse that’s going to happen is affecting the quality of my spellwork due to the material of my wand’s core.” Smart of her to recognize the cause of tetchy magic so quickly, but then again, she’s Hermione Granger so he doesn’t expect less. “I came here for your help, but I think you need help more than me at the moment.”
Robes. That was the first thing Harry noticed. Draco was wearing robes. Traditional, masculine robes, cut in a similar fashion to a Muggle men’s suit. Only, these robes hugged his curves and made Harry’s mouth water as he approached.
Hermione storms up to him, Ron trailing pathetically behind her like a lost puppy dog as she tears through the grass to them. Her eyes are nearly black with anger and she looks positively murderous. Malfoy’s shrill screaming had attracted a fair amount of onlookers as well and of all people, he sees Ginny shake her head in disgust.
An adorably small squeak escapes Draco’s mouth when Harry unintentionally pushes him up against a wall in his haste. Draco’s nimble fingers find themselves tangled in Harry’s hair and he tugs at the strands, sending small sparks of pleasure down Harry’s spine. Harry’s mouth opens in a moan and Draco uses the opportunity to slip his tongue in, brushing teasingly along the velvety inner flesh of his bottom lip.
Draco rubs his temples, trying to remember the various grooming spells to make him look halfway decent. One thorough body cleansing and mouth freshening charm later he answers, “It doesn’t matter.” It does matter, but he wouldn’t dare be picky after…
He can breathe a little easier as she rabbits away, but not by much. In the past forty-five minutes since she's started talking, he still hasn’t been able to touch his soup without revealing his shaking hands. He has to settle with taking large sips of water to keep himself busy and to wet his dry throat.
When he’s done, Scorpius’ breathing has calmed and though his eyes are red and puffy, the tears have stopped falling.
He smiles coyly at her, taking her hand and giving it a polite shake. “Yes. How did you know?” His nose twitches. “It’s the hair, isn’t it?”
Harry’s hand is encouragingly stroking the back of his neck, playing with the shorter hairs at the nape.
Quill and notebook in hand, he outlines the constellation, his hands needing to do something productive when he starts thinking about stupid rides he should have never gone on.
His son gives two tugs on his finely pressed shirt sleeve, nodding over to Potter’s glaring face. “Why don’t you try talking to him?”
to have a happy, nuclear family with her, not knowing that some lemons were too sour to make lemonade out of.
In his efforts to expose him to Muggle culture, Scorpius fell in love with the song, which had a rather beautiful melody even if the lyrics were pretty silly towards the end in Draco’s opinion. But he forced himself to learn the words when he heard Scorpius humming it for several days after the play and it slowly became his favorite song as well. Given that he would go to the metaphysical ends of the universe to make his son happy, this was one thing he didn’t mind doing.
“You don’t know me Potter,” he snarls, his face so close that he can feel Potter’s hot, even breathes on his lips. Draco shoves a finger into his chest, not bothering to try to conceal how badly it was shaking. Potter doesn’t even flinch. “So don’t act like you do. Some of us have grown up since Hogwarts.”
He’s just stalking the Quidditch pitch for him when his legs start to cramp up from the constant movement. His body can survive an entire war and a fight against Voldemort, but it draws the line at desperate searches for Draco Malfoy.
Potter spares him from responding to attend to the food. Draco’s stomach makes an embarrassingly loud sound when he smells the delicious scented breakfast and Potter laughs that charmingly masculine laugh again.
And bloody fucking hell was it hot. Draco glares up at the Sun as if he could will it to dimmer with a few sour glares. A woman scurries out of the way when he frantically asks her to buy biscuits, clutching her plaid printed handbag to her chest.
Finley leaves, but not without purposefully knocking into Draco’s shoulder and hissing a foul comment about his sexuality in his ear on his way out.
Malfoy shrugs and unwraps it, sucking at the candy on top with his pouty, pink lips. Harry looks away, feeling uncomfortable watching Malfoy suck at the lollipop with such an avid determination. It was almost worse than the case of the fellated sausage.
Draco shrugs, feigning nonchalance. “Get your knickers out its twist, it was just an offer. I think everyone has the capacity to change.” He wasn’t talking about singing anymore and from the way Potter was staring at him, he knew it too. Suddenly uncomfortable with the turn of the conversation he clears his throat and fiddles with the cuffs on his shirt sleeve.
Draco scowls at the giant dome Harry takes them to. A crowd of Muggles was streaming in and out of the building with large smiles on their faces though Draco can’t figure out why. “So… my surprise for taking the potions is… a dome?”
“Albus,” he says softly. Albus raises his head from his desk and for the first time, Draco sees a dejected frown on his face so opposite to his usually smiling self. His drugged heart hurts at the sight.
He rolls his eyes. “Well I feel great.” He spots Harry fuming outside of the classroom where the event was to be held and pushes Scorpius along. “Go on, I’m going to speak with Harry first.”
But now they were back for a new term, and Draco couldn’t hide from Potter forever. He was doomed to suffer for the rest of the year with a smile on his face and a hard cock throbbing in his trousers.
“Okay, that’s enough,” Potter snatches the bottle from Draco’s hand, ignoring his childish protests. He reaches for the bottle and Potter
Sighing, he heads over to the study to rest his eyes for several minutes before he has to return to work. He’s grateful that he had his mother to watch over Scorpius while he was stuck in his office all afternoon. Scorpius didn’t require much attention and he was fairly good at entertaining himself at this age, but it never sat right with Draco to leave him unattended for long periods of time.
The door shuts close with a soft click, the sound reverberating in the empty, crayon-scented air as Draco leans back against the pale wood, uncaring about ruffling his carefully done braid as he pressed his head against the frame. He wandlessly casts several additional locking spells, the sound of the door locking tight behind the small of his back music to his ears.
Draco clears his throat, plastering on his politest, Charm School ingrained smile at the woman. She blinks slowly, still indifferent. Not dangerous, definitely not.
Scorpius shrugs in the easy, nonchalant way children always do when adults freak out over seemingly simple things. “Just ‘cause.” He pushes his glasses up on the bridge of his nose, examining him, “You look like you do.”
“Potter. Ana.” He nods at them in greeting. “Good morning.” He thumps Scorpius on the shoulder when he doesn’t do the same. Glaring up at him, he mutters a good morning to his teachers through pouted lips.
Scorpius bites his lip, kicking around a rock below. “I dunno. She said that she’s met every parent ‘cept you so far. I guess she’s just curious. You’ve never come into the school before.”
“Ow!” Ron complains, flushing beet red when Harry raises an eyebrow and Hermione puts her hands on her hips. “Sorry Mione. It’s not my fault though that Malfoy chose to wear the shortest skirt possible. No bloke can’t help but to stare; I mean, it’s like he’s asking for it!”
He’s sitting in a Muggle PTA meeting with Harry Potter. Potter, armed with his stupid dimples and smooth confidence, is the President of said PTA group. And, worst of all, his son’s sodding teacher at his new school.
Had they not been in the middle of Muggle London, Draco would have probably gotten hexed in half for being such a pain and for screwing with Muggle sayings like he was. “No hints,” Harry says firmly. “We’re here anyway.”
Harry feels his face flush in anger. Girl or not, Malfoy was a slimy git all the same. He leans forward, poking a threatening finger into Malfoy’s collarbone. Those silver eyes taunt him to do his worst and he does. “Listen here you pompous, vexatious, gender-bent little prat, I don’t care if you’re a bloody girl, I’ll still hex the skin off of your stupid, short skirt wearing ars—”
With a red face, Finley reaches for his robe pocket, the one where he knows he keeps his wand, and Draco prepares himself for the nasty hex that was coming.
Harry takes this in, seeming to ponder the common truth they share as he bites his lip. “Does the reality involve you speaking French for me more often?” That goofy grin of his is unfathomably adorable. Bloody Gryffindors. He loves them.
It’s a rare, cloudless and sunny day in England—people’s smiles are brighter, the Draco constellation will be especially visible in two weeks, and Harry Potter wants to talk about things that are not real. “I’m not discussing this anymore Potter,” he spits. “Not now, not ever. So stop bringing it up.”
Potter holds his hands up in a calming gesture. “Sorry if I offended you. But it was just a question, Malfoy.”
Draco turns the chair so that he’s angled right in front of the water fountain placed against the wall. It’s less of a water fountain and more of a crystal bowl of water spinning continuously around on an axle. The small ripples that form are subtle, consistent with the gravitational pull naturally occurring on Earth at the moment. It’s another sodding Waxing Gibbous, but in another minute there’ll be a Full Moon in this room.
“Possibly, but I don’t know if he’s just saying that for my benefit or if he’s genuinely okay with it.”
When Harry asked what it is Draco liked, he couldn’t come up with an answer better than, “I don’t know.”
Harry takes a breath, ready to show her that there are still some students in Eighth Year who do have a sense of maturity. “I’m very sorry about this Professor—”
This was his reality. Trial and errors, of not listening and trying to say it like it is. He tried to escape it by stuffing it away in the back of a dusty cabinet in France and plugging his ears to everyone’s advice, but as he wraps himself around Harry’s body, he thinks he can accept it now.
A light female voice calls out to him. “Hey Harry!” He turns and sees Ginny strolling down the hallway behind him. He leaves Parkinson, grateful to be out of her clutches and goes to greet her.
“Oh, nothing Harry. I think it’s best to let you figure it out for yourself, regardless of what Hermione thinks.” She leans up on her toes and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek. “Good luck.”
“An existential crisis.” Harry nods and points in agreement. Draco laughs. He knows he probably sounds a little bit mad. He probably is; most astronomers he’s met are in some capacity. “I think I have one of those at least once a day!”
“How’s Potter and wild child?” She asks conversationally. Her stomach is growing bigger each time he sees her and he’s aggravated that he’s missed his chance of scolding her for bringing him tea. He scowls at her through the steam floating towards the ceiling.
He gulps. “Everything feels… off. Like something isn’t right but I just can’t… figure it out. And the vibrations from my wand…” Draco’s fingers lovingly touch the small beauty mark he has behind his ear. He understands. He’s conducted this experiment hundreds of times and there’s only one word Draco can accurately describe the feeling as. Anxiety.
Draco shudders as he pushes into him. It’s been too long since they’ve done this. He feels bad for James—as much as he may hate him for being with Harry, Draco knows that he will never let this man go. A terrifying prospect, just like the man in between his legs.
“Snape’s been taking forever with it; I hope he remembers that Yule’s in two weeks,” Ron snorts, “I doubt anyone wants to see Malfoy in a dress.”
Potter snorts next to him. “Real original Draco.” Draco resisted the urge to stick up a naughty finger his way. “Let the kids go riding. You, Lily, and I will stay here and wait for them. She doesn’t like rollercoasters much.” He motions to the sleeping little girl in his arms.
With an amused sigh, Harry sits atop his desk next to his self-orbiting Milky Way figure, waiting patiently to be shown that Draco was not a loon and was in fact, just a damn good astronomer. He throws his hands up in the air and lets them fall onto his thighs with a loud clap. “Do your worst Malfoy.”
Draco takes his hand in his, trying not to think about the firm calluses that were scattered over Potter’s hand and how good the rough skin would feel against places other than his palm. Or that he was letting this bullheaded Gryffindor prat boss him around so early in the morning.
Unless it was another text similar to the autobiographical tales of a Black witch from the states that left her small, southern hometown to move to Britain and help fight in the first war. Apparently, she was a genius at tracking even the faintest of magical signatures. Before that, she was helping combat racism in the Muggle community of her old hometown, going as far as living as a Muggle for several years to help in the cause. That book was without a doubt his favorite and if he was going to be given another reading assignment, he was hoping she’ll continue picking interesting ones like that one.
Call it paranoia, but Draco swears Potter gives him the faintest hint of a wink when he finishes his introduction.
“Sorry,” he laughs, “you just can’t tell Al or Scorp about this. I have two extra tickets to the London amusement park. Ginny has a game so she can’t come with us this weekend but I was wondering if you and Scorpius might like to come with?”
,” Astoria corrects, “He’s good. He’s… been helping me.” If he didn’t know better, he’d say that she was actually blushing at the mention of her boyfriend’s name.
James returns home, no more friendlier than when he left, but willing to greet Harry and him in the mornings and teach Scorpius some basic Quidditch skills on his broom. Ginny says it’s a start; Draco thinks it’s a miracle.
“It got in the way of a lot of things. My own wife could hardly sleep in the same room with me at night because of my nightmares. I didn’t want to spend time with anyone, even my children, I just wanted to try to atone for everyone that died in the war because I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Ginny told me to go see a Mind Healer or sign the divorce papers. Merlin, there were so many times we had nearly gotten divorced, I’m still surprised we made it as long as we did. James saw the worst of it.” His face crumples as he admits this, souring in a dull, sorrowful expression.
“It’s a lollipop. A Muggle treat. Hermione told me that it's what she eats when she has her period. She wanted me to give you some.” He doesn’t understand the fascination girls—or blokes— have with sweet things when they’re on their periods but he’s learned not to question it.
“Is this what people usually talk about on the first date?” His joke falls flat when Harry purses his lips. Some people just can’t appreciate good humor.
So naturally, he stuffs the letter away in a dresser, letting it collect dust as he worries about more important things. Like whether Scorpius was getting along with his professors. Each time he tries to write a letter in response to the research offer, it only overwhelms him terribly.
Boot comes up several parents later and Draco can tell his work as a Knight Bus driver is far less exciting when he fabricates it as being a school bus driver. Several kids yawn as he stumbles to answer the questions without revealing anything magical.
Draco growls, “Yes, you—!” He pinches his nose. Despite the Eclipse occurring today, there was no risk of a detrimental magical occurrence or astronomical reason for why he shouldn’t let his emotions run wild and consume him. But there was a moral one. Letting his anger and frustration out on Harry would not do either of them any good.
Draco lets out a dry laugh. “You mean an insane blood purist? You can say it; Scorpius and I try not to sugarcoat things.” He blows his hair out from his eyes. “We call it ‘say it like it is’ over here. I can't condemn any opinion you have if you start it with that.”
It’s a bit funny how people work sometimes. When Draco gets frustrated he reaches for a pint or baggie stuffed at the bottom of his desk. For his wand to turn his anger into a physical manifestation of the fire in his chest.
Draco gapes like a fish out of water, disbelieving that his mother would rather side with Harry bloody Potter than her own son. Betrayal isn’t even an adequate word to describe how he feels.
Though he’ll be sore pressed to admit it, Malfoy was right. And he was right as well. Malfoy could wear whatever he pleased and Harry was now certain that the Slytherin had superhuman hearing.
Harry licks a path from his shaft to his navel, looking up at him the entire time with dark, hooded eyes. “You could say that. But sometimes a bit of foresight isn’t a bad thing. Don’t you think?” He punctuates this by adding a second finger.
“He hates Dad!” Albus exclaims, bringing the large caterpillar up to them and holding it to their faces. Draco shrinks away behind Harry, disgusted by the green, squirming thing writhing in the palm of his hand.
He keeps a careful eye on Scorpius, but as time drags on, it seems that he doesn’t really need to. From what he can see, Scorpius is a massive hit at the dinner.
Scorpius squirms in his seat, pulling a crumpled paper from behind his back and handing it to him, looking away as he does.
“Ha! Listen to this,” Draco smooths out the paper and clears his throat for the table to hear as Harry sets a plate of steaming breakfast food in front of him. “
“You’ll be wishing that you wouldn’t have told him anything, that’s what.” She pulls him down to her level, her voice gentle like she was speaking to Marcéline. “You really are a big softie Draco. Like an angry kitten really.” He growls. Dragons are
Scorpius is still clinging to him and muttering apologizes which Potter shows up, his eyes focusing on Albus then Scorpius’s tear-stained face.
Yes. A little bit. But anyone would cry seeing such beautiful pictures of the Rose Nebula projected onto the ceiling. He quickly wipes his eyes before Harry can make a fuss about it. Bloody hell, this man and his surprises always turn him into a fucking crier.
Potter comes down the creaky backyard steps, stopping until he was a mere foot away from him. He’s still visibly shaken by Draco’s sudden outburst of flames and he looks on the verge of violently sneezing from the smell of burnt grass and paper in the air, but his voice is strong. “Don’t look so surprised. I think it’s clear that we’ve both matured enough to admit that the other person isn’t as mad as we thought they were. Don’t you agree?”
Finally. Patience was never his strongest asset, and he believes that he was in for some serious compensation for his troubles.
It's two days later when Malfoy finally makes his reappearance in the Great Hall Thursday morning. Much like the first day he appeared in the lunchroom, he’s all hips and legs, his silver-blonde hair done into two intricately woven Dutch braids. Harry makes a mental note not to get into hair whipping distance when he goes up to him later today.
“Aw better luck next time, yeah?” Jaspers says solemnly once they’re out of the conference room, clapping him on the back. The sodding git didn’t even have anything to present today, he just showed up to annoy Draco. “And sorry about earlier, it turns out it was
James’ fists clench and suddenly Draco is also thankful that he doesn’t have his wand on him. “You know I’m right. You never cared before the divorce either. All you did was isolate yourself from us. So what’s the issue now that I’m doing it to you? Now that
“To see when you will crack. It’s only a matter of time.” His body is like a wall, somehow looming over him despite his shorter height, encasing him in a shroud of distrust.
Harry awkwardly pats his shoulder. “Yeah… you kind of did. At least it’s over, right? I had a feeling you were one stuttering sentence away from admitting that Malfoy now has the best arse in school.”
Draco clears his throat of any residual nervousness lingering there. “Hullo, my name is Draco Malfoy and I—”
He keeps talking and telling him that it’s alright when it’s not and he’s lying because how can he know that? How can anything be alright when Astoria is demanding to have Scorpius back?
He tunes them out, his gaze trained on Malfoy as the blonde watches with an open mouth and red cheeks nearly the same color of his fancy lipstick. Revenge literally never tasted so sweet. He sticks two fingers into the fruit and sucks them clean as he smirks cheekily. The sausage on Malfoy’s fork falls off into his plate with perfect comedic timing and Harry laughs, wiping the juices from his mouth with the back of his hand and tries to give the orange half back to Ron.
He leans forward to the receptionist’s office, watching warily as two hands clutch each side of a thick novel tap against the cover.
Draco doesn’t quite see why this would lead James to hate Harry but he lets him speak, knowing that it was important sometimes just to let the truth out.
the potions. If Draco can stand in front of a board of Ministry appointed officials seven times and handle being rejected seven times, he can handle a bit of anxiety. Astoria was wrong, like usual. Whatever fictitious mental illness the Mind Healer had diagnosed him with was clearly far off base.
He waves his hands behind Boot’s thick head, attempting to get the resident Gryffindor here to tell this idiot to leave them the hell alone.
Feeling like he’s just been punched in the gut, Draco hardly notices the kiss she plants on his cheek. She pats it twice before turning and calling after her grandson in a cheery tone.
He feels Potter’s breath warming his neck, the both of them pressed together near the window watching their sons play. From the corner of his eye, he notices the small mole at the juncture of his neck and two laugh lines permanently etched into the skin around his eyes. Potter’s gotten older. And bloody taller too, because since when was Harry Potter almost as tall as him?
His nose twitches. Once, twice, three times does he remind himself why it would be a bad idea to strangle Boot. It was unimaginably difficult, seeing that Draco did not take kindly to people, especially shallow-minded Ravenclaws, who did not properly pronounce his son’s name. It was one thing for it to be an honest mistake, it was another thing for it to be a result of simply not caring. Names are not something to be careless of.
around them. “Scorp, that’s why you go to Hogwarts, to learn how to control your magic. No one expects you to have a firm grasp on it at this age. I certainly didn’t.” He cups his face in his hands and wipes his tears away with his thumbs. More soon follow to dampen his face.
Draco yanks the door open and Potter’s alarmed face is staring back at him, his glasses slightly askew but looking much more well-rested for a man who just let his sworn childhood enemy sleep in his home. In comparison, he must look like a stray crup with a severe alcohol problem.
“I already have. I’m calling you because Scorpius was climbing in the tree beside him and he’s positive that it was him who pushed Al out of it.”
“And as for you Mr. Malfoy, I will do my best to accommodate you during this… predicament. Professor Snape has already agreed to brew an anti-potion. In the meantime, you will attend
the word revered as if it was something sacred, something better than just being magic or better than just being a three year old child that could tell his colors apart.
Potter should know. He got them dropped. Yet he doesn’t say anything, just flicks his finger off his mouth and stares at Draco like he was trying to decide best what to do with him.
For the sake of his future friendship with Malfoy, Harry wisely decides not to snap at her to mind her business.
That represents positive outcomes for your current hardships.” Jaspers grins, giving the Sun card another tap with his wand. “Oh excellent! Gemini’s are also going to conquer a feat that seems insignificant to others this week!” He frowns slightly, “But you’re probably going to take a short-cut to get there.” He flips the cards back into a neat deck. “Ah well, can’t win them all fairly I guess.”
Harry’s like a kid tagging along with their parents at their job for the day—annoying as hell but unfathomably good company.
Hermione inspects her amulet with a closer eye, the pink rock gleaming in the morning sunlight. “What’s it made out of?”
he wants to say, but Draco holds his tongue because sometimes, speaking his mind wasn’t always for the best. He just hums in agreement. Potter’s hand wraps around his elbow right when Draco turns to leave. “What did I tell you, you’re an excellent father.”
But regardless of his tactlessness, Scorpius is all ears, looking up at him with Draco’s own shining grey eyes. Not soft brown, like Astoria’s. No. A pale, honest grey that’s nearly translucent under the light of Aquarius.
There was a certain hardship in not knowing. Draco could ask Scorpius a thousand times whether he was okay with him being gay and still not actually know. It was infuriating enough to make him consider using Legilimency just to find out.
Once at the Black home, that old bugger Kreacher scared the living daylights out of him when his five year old curiosity led him to wander into the kitchen. He’d gotten both a screechy bit of screaming from Kreacher and a long talk from his parents to not go poking around in areas designated for subordinate creatures like house-elves. He idly wonders if Kreacher was still alive. Potter probably has him holed up in the lap of luxury at this very moment and he doesn’t mind not one bit. He is much better company than a sour old house elf.
A cautious hand travels up the base of his spine and onto the tail end of his braid, while the other takes no time to bury itself into the looser locks messily undone around the nape of his neck. The feeling of someone else’s magic engulfing him is so strong and vibrant, that Draco finds himself caring less about the placement of his hands and more about the warmth exuding from Harry’s body.
He can feel Scorpius swaying side to side next to him; a strange tic Draco’s picked up on when he’s feeling unsettled. “I mean, you don’t have to, I know Mum never liked to—”
Draco doesn’t need a man. He’s never needed anyone but himself, so why should that change now? Besides, he’s got a perfectly good left hand. And a right one, though it doesn’t work as well as the left.
“You can always try serenading them,” Potter jokes, though it’s not really a joke when he adds, “You certainly have the voice for it.”
“See that wasn’t so bad… Draco?” Harry’s eyes flash with concern when he turns and sees Draco hunched over. “Draco?”
did,” he drawls sarcastically. There’s something else behind his tone, something that almost reads as bitter.
Draco fidgets in place, ravenous for something that Boot and his insidious cock-blocking jabbering couldn't provide. His eyes ever so often drift towards Harry’s muscled torso, the outlines of his shoulder blades and spine flexing as he turns talks to Boot with animated hand gestures.
“Er, well that’s good too!” Blaise says, recovering enough to clap him on the back encouragingly, “That’s the spirit.”
from his eyes. Harry rolls his own eyes, wishing Malfoy was a male so he could punch the dramatic prick in the face. “I-I’m okay.” He sniffs as more tears fall down his dirt-covered cheeks. “He pulled my hair a-and yanked me to the ground.” His breath hitches and he covers his face with his delicate hands. “And t-then he punched me in the stomach.”
Call it immature, but Draco always thought that anger was a rather productive emotion. Useful, for moments when you need to find a house in London in a week. Or file for a divorce at the drop of a Knut.
An odd look crosses his face when Draco doesn’t sit up front with him but instead joins the children on the carpet. A boy that has an uncanny resemblance to Scorpius offers him a little wave when Draco ends up sitting next to him. He waves back.
Boot nods, disinterest translucent in his flat gaze. “Cool.” He turns back to Harry. “So Harry, I’m sorry I missed today.” He ribs him playfully. “You know, wives and all.” There’s a special place in Hell for cock-blocking heterosexuals. “So, would you mind filling me in?”
Merlin, and Scorpius. He’s never seen him have an attack—that he knows off. He’ll probably be scared half to death and in front of everyone in his year nonetheless.
Draco wants to stomp his foot in protest like Scorpius does. This wasn’t fair. He was here first, and if he’s being honest, far more important than Terry Boot. He had
Harry taps the whisk against the side of a pan. “What makes you think I’m avoiding something?” Not even he believes his own words, his hand losing some of their smooth easiness as he whisks another bowl of eggs and turns erratic with each flick of his wrist.
“Ahh,” Harry scratches his beard with twitchy fingers. “There’s something you should know about James…”
“Who the fu—Harry?” Blinking several times, he looks down and sees an arm sprawled out on the floor and sucks his teeth. “Harry what the hell are you doing down there?” And he calls
He bites his lip. “I mean, I think there’s a fair amount of people who are bisexual here. Really who is entirely straight or entirely gay? I suppose some people like yourself are but it just doesn’t seem realistic that
Potter’s outside the nurse's room, leaning up against the door and apparently waiting for Draco to return. Draco raises his eyebrows in a silent question, forcing himself not to stare too long as the way Potter’s biceps flex with his arms crossed.
It certainly wasn’t because he could either, it was actually the complete opposite. Harry Potter, the Chosen One, the most powerful wizard of their time, couldn’t hold a damn note if Voldemort had him at wandpoint. Bless his heart, but it was so endearing to watch him genuinely try to carry a tune that was just too heavy for him to pick up.
“Prat.” He takes a deep breath. “And you’ve wasted your time and energy climbing up here because there’s nothing to tell Potter. Go play hero somewhere else. I don’t need your help.”
Harry’s words are like Princess licking his wrist—as much as he wants to pretend that he doesn’t love it, he simply can’t.
Draco hears the little pidder patter of tiny feet and his heart melts in relief. Scorpius was soon standing in front of the fireplace, his pale cheeks flushed from exertion. He looks clean, alive, and wonderfully taken care of.
“That would be delightful,” Draco hisses sarcastically. “Until then, I better not see another backward-arsed question like this on his homework again.” He holds up the tip of his wand, the end humming with barely contained magic. Potter wisely inches away from the charged end with dilated pupils, his back pressing as far as it will go in his leather seat. “Or else, Potter.”
Draco groans. He should know better than to promise things to kids. Especially kids named Albus Potter. He rubs his neck, breaking out into a coughing fit, “Oh geez, my throat hurts. Maybe tomorrow?” Or never—that was fine too.
Yet, he laughed instead, because in this rare instance the fantasy was far better than the reality. Shook his hand from Harry’s grip and said, “Seeing your horrendous organizational patterns every day.”
Harry laughs, quickly kissing his knuckles as compensation. “Sorry, I just got excited. I have something to show you.” Draco’s eyes widen and he takes a step back, preparing to defend his already soiled virtue if necessary. “No! Not that! Merlin, get your head out of the gutter.”
noticed how good-looking Malfoy was. It was always just a fact of life. The grass is green, he is a Gryffindor, and Malfoy is unfairly fit. The problem was when Malfoy found that out for himself. It was somewhere between when Harry realized his attraction to blondes and Malfoy’s features went from pointy to refined was when Malfoy was, objectively speaking, supremely attractive.
She hums thoughtfully. “Well, you’ll definitely find a lot of that here. We have students from various racial and ethnic groups that attend the school, so you and your son won’t have to look far.”
“Fuck!” He writhes under Harry’s touch, arching his back so that Harry could take more of him. He can’t quite take him all the way but Merin it was more than enough to satisfy him.
Harry’s eyes snap up from his plate, his face bloodless at Draco’s outburst. He wipes his full mouth with his napkin. “Is it because of the food? Because I can try the chopsticks again it just may take a while…”
” Draco hisses, his quill snapping in revolt, “is Gilderoy Lockhart. Eccentric is my Aunt Bellatrix. Eccentric is Luna Lovegood.
Little Lily Potter is possibly the messiest eater Draco’s ever encountered. She slurps and smears the ice cream all over her face, her spoon missing her mouth seven times out of ten. Potter has to grab a fat stack of napkins just to keep her face moderately clean but her nose is nearly permanently covered in a droplet of chocolate ice cream.
Harry glances over at the Slytherin. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, a carefully placed bandage laid over his Dark Mark. Despite his exploitation of his large assets, he doesn’t seem to be doing anything wrong. In fact, he seemed far too focused on his work to care about anyone else. Like Neville staring longingly in his direction.
“Well it wasn’t,” he snaps. He runs a hand through his hair, tugging at the ends. Here goes nothing. “Especially not her because she’s—”
This time Draco snickers. 13 year olds were ruthless. He can only imagine that Scorpius would be ten times worse with his quick-witted tongue.
Potter places a self assured hand on Draco’s shoulder. Warm and steady, just like his strong, Not-An-Auror body last night. Draco flushes. “Easy, Scorpius is fine. You left him with Blaise and Pansy remember? I Flooed them this morning because I knew you would ask. And by the way, I’m not so sure you should casually keep the Floo coordinates of other people on your person. Though I guess it worked out in your favor this time…”
Malfoy sits up, his eyes bleary and he blinks several times. “Who’s there?” He demands, his wand already in hand. Merlin, did he sleep with the thing? As amusing as it was to see Malfoy shivering in his green satin pajamas, Harry rolls his eyes.
“Oi, Malfoy are you up?” Potter’s voice booms from outside of the door and Draco nearly falls again from fright. Merlin, does he have to be so
“Before?” His voice is too light and Draco can hear the thread of trepidation needling it’s way in it.
Draco’s face finds itself buried into his hands. He cracks and that wave of nausea hits him full force as a stream of tears, not vomit.
Draco stills, his smile fading. This feels a lot like…flirting, actually. Not at all like their usual verbal sparring.
“—And you know how George is still doing the joke shop right? Well, he’s been testing this product that’ll change a person’s gender for a day. Isn’t that ironic mate?”
“Though of course, in my fantasy, I was a lot smoother than dropping a bottle of lube everywhere,” he admits, groaning as he says it. “And I think I had much better pick up lines. My cock was the same though—it’s big enough as is.”
Taking a deep breath, he looks at his hands. There was only a minimal amount of shaking. He smirks. He’s getting too good at dealing with Harry Potter.
Potter snickers behind the door as the loud thud of Draco’s hazardously clumsy footfalls echoes around the room.
“Those fucking arseholes!” Harry seethes next to him. “Even I could see that you deserved that approval.” Draco shrugs, walking quickly past the other witches and wizards in the department. Apparently everyone sees it except for them.
The moment he steps into the silver-grey drawing room, his eyes immediately focus on the array of liquors on the antique Singaporean table. “Planning a party?” This was more liquor than two people could drink in a week.
His plan to stay away from anyone, especially Molly, was working splendidly. Everything at the Weasley’s was going far better than he expected. Lily shows him her pink nails her ‘Aunt Flew’ did for her, Charlie informs him and Harry all about the stubborn horntail that was refusing to mate with anyone in the sanctuary, and Arthur Weasley asks him if it’s true that Muggle children really do use something called a calculator to compute simple maths.
The prat gracefully hops atop one of the desks to him, his skirt inching higher and higher up his thighs. Now that he had an up-close view of them, Harry was realizing how smooth and hairless his legs were. It looked good on him, but he personally didn’t mind a bit of hair. In fact, he thinks he’d rather it be there.
He turns to leave the room when Malfoy’s weak voice suddenly stops him. “Potter, can I ask you something?”
Draco feels his body temperature rise and this time not in anger. “Dare I say, is the Chosen One baring
She’s charming. Also, she knows how to pronounce Scorpius’ name. Not a bad first impression. Not bad at all.
Draco can hardly exaggerate the sigh of relief he lets out once Kacia leaves with the rest of the parents, leaving him and Potter in the empty room. He also can’t exaggerate the spike of hatred that burns through his veins at Potter’s dastardly smug look aimed right at him.
He catches sight of the now fully cooked eggs, bacon, and pancakes on the plate and discreetly licks his lips. It’s a plain breakfast for Pureblood standards but Draco couldn’t imagine eating anything else at the moment. Surprisingly, there were days in Paris where he would prefer this to a decadent plate of
With a shaky shrug, Potter shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, rocking nervously back and forth on the heel of his feet. “Merlin, I’m going to regret this—what’s so wrong with those comics?”
The day before he’s supposed to leave for France, he goes to his mother’s, hoping to get some last minute advice on how to deal with Astoria, Finley’s demands, and keep Scorpius blissfully unaware of the war raging in his name. It’s only right to want the advice of a person powerful enough to evade Voldemort's invasion and outmaneuver him. With a straight back and determined gait, he recites the list of questions in his head on how to deal with a lesser enemy when he enters from the Floo.
Albus pouts, smacking his lips. “Oh come on Dad, Scorpius told me how great of a singer Mr. Malfoy is, can't we just stay for one minute?”
Harry fixes him with a stern look, though he can see that he was trying very hard not to laugh. “Fine, fine. Here, give that to me,” he holds his hand out for the whisk. “I’ll finish cooking. You go and sit your fit arse somewhere and relax, I’ve got this.” Draco doesn’t know much about PTSD, but if there was one thing he did know, it was that Harry did not need to be overworking himself any further than he already is.
Potter cuts him off. “You do,” his voice is firm. “I’ve told you that you were before; what did you think I was telling you that for my health?” Draco finds himself believing it, despite his better judgment. Because it is, in fact, the second time Potter had said that he was a good father and because it’s truthfully the second time
Draco clutches his parchment papers closer to his chest and walks faster. If he makes eye contact then he'll be asking to resolve himself for twenty minutes of his babbling about palm readings and horoscopes.
Secretly, he’s ecstatic that Potter was making a fuss over it. But, like always, Draco would never give him the satisfaction of telling him so. He had much better things to do. Like child-proofing everything in his home before Saturday.
After lunch, he watches as Parkinson and Zabini walk together arm in arm from the Great Hall. Harry raises a brow. They sure seemed…
He’ll give up his innate ability to pick out fancy dress robes and his excellent taste in décor if he didn’t have to deal with yet another bloke running away with his cock tucked between his legs when Draco mentions Scorpius. Every man he goes out with fled like he’s just seen a legion of boggarts coming his way at the mention of his son.
So, in an even, steady voice, he demands, “However, I would like to know why it is you insist on stalking me.”
The silvery streaks of dawn’s light had just begun to appear outside when Draco’s foot ruts up against a solid form. His legs were far too long and he needed a lot more room to be comfortable than most people. So whatever it was preventing him from stretching out was going to have to move.
“You know I’m not an Auror,” Potter replies, his tone uncharacteristically frosty. If he didn’t know any better, which he probably didn’t in his inhibited state, he’d say that Potter bristles every time he mentioned Aurors. He’ll have to remember to mention them more often. “Bully for you it’s me, not them who's here to stop you from ruining your reputation and possibly getting sent to Azkaban. Aurors aren’t known for being quite so forgiving.” Matched with his humorlessly dry tone is a scathing bit of obnoxiousness that Draco had always hated about him.
“As expected, the effects of unbalanced magic manifests in the quality of your spellwork. However, the gravitational pull of a Full Moon can further destabilize this balance, as it’s doing currently.” He takes a deep breath. “So, with that being said… cast a
Draco lifts his head so that his chin is resting on Harry’s shoulder. “Did Scorpius ever fail one of your exams?”
“My hero—I’ll be sure to hold you to it. In the meantime, don’t feel bad about being out of practice. I'll make sure you get up to speed.”
“Hold on,” Draco grabs Harry’s wand from the side table and casts a quick cleaning charm onto Harry’s mouth. “Now we can kiss.”
“I thought she was sick,” he admits. “Sometimes she wouldn’t get out of bed for days. It would have been cruel just to leave her by herself like that, right?”
His pale hand yanks away from the jar and he scowls darkly at him. “And so what if it is?” Harry squints and notices for the first time the light coat of mascara on Malfoy’s lashes and the pink stain of blush on his cheeks.
What has he done? Getting drunk out of his mind like that? Scorpius could be anywhere, he was so tiny and vulnerable; he could have found a portkey and be halfway across the world right now, or ventured out into Muggle London by himself or—
Well Draco has no idea what the hell a Royal Navy was, but he does know that if Ana Lellory hated him, then he did too.
“The thing is, it sucks for every unlucky bugger who has a period. I’ve only had one and I feel like I’m either going to throw up or pass out.” He leans back into his pile of fluffy green pillows and huffs. “And don’t even get me started on men.”
“Shut up about Boot,” he growls. Draco yanks at his tie, loosening the damned knot before he chokes on lust. “Come here.”
Draco’s nose stings. He won’t cry. He refuses to cry over some stupid rejection. He shakes his head. “No ma’am.”
“—for the book but I must be on my way.” He wrings himself out of her grasp and sprints to the Floo. “Bye! Love you!”
Sure enough, when he looks down, two elegant black pumps with insanely high heels capture his attention. How Draco’s feet weren’t screaming at him was a mystery.
Ignoring her boyfriend’s panicking, she simply shrugs. “The resemblance was uncanny; Malfoy always did have girlish features. Plus, most of the Slytherins had been talking about it. It’s actually rather fascinating, I don’t know how you managed to create such a powerful potion Harry, but you should definitely look into reproducing it. Of course, only for people who actually want to change their gender.”
“You know what? I’m done. I’m trying to help you and you’re just pushing me away. I know that I was wrong to fight you and shoot you with water but seriously, how can anyone
When he’s older and making the same mistakes that Draco is now, he’ll make sure to warn him about finding the unavailable so alluring like he does. He’ll tell him that not even a Malfoy can have it all, that some things, regardless of their attractiveness, were not meant to be had.
“I just wanted to remind you that today is Thursday, we have our paired reading for the afterschool kids.”
He yelps, his hands immediately flying to the ends of his hair to shake out the phantom caterpillar. He stops once he notices everyone laughing at him, Harry’s being the loudest voice amidst the noisy London atmosphere. “Oh sod off.”
Every afternoon he goes to pick up Scorpius, Potter’s there, standing outside with his two kids and watching as children are sent safely to their parents. Draco watches with the gaze of a predator, hating his every breath before he exalts it.
Shaking legs carry him to the closed metal doors of the conference room, and for a moment he actually is shaking with jealousy. And fear. Mainly fear.
Time feels surreal as Potter finishes talking and opens the floor up for suggestions. When the desire to feel small appears, Draco wraps his arms tightly around himself, wondering when his life became so convoluted that he ended up here. He doesn’t even notice the figure looming over him until he feels the tap on his shoulder.
“There’s nothing wrong with loving or being excited about something other people find odd,” Harry wisely points out, sounding exactly how Draco imagined him sounding in the classroom. “It’s important to be passionate about what you do, otherwise what’s the point of doing it?”
Catching both Harry and Ron’s eyes in the crowd, he brings a skewed sausage on a fork up to his wet, smirking lips and flicks his tongue around it teasingly, causing an uproar of boisterous laughter from Parkinson and the rest of his goons. Harry wrinkles his nose in disgust as Malfoy puts the rest of it in his mouth; his eyes rolling back in mock pleasure as he pretends to gag on the piece of meat. Harry swore he could even hear him
Draco is reduced to a muttering mess as Harry slowly works him open. It’s been so long since anyone has touched him this way that he nearly forgot just how good it was.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Yes, Potter. That’s a thing. But where pray tell, would these bisexual blokes be at? I swear, sometimes the students at Hogwarts are so suffocatingly heterosexual…”
Draco gulps. Oh fuck, this was going to be harder than he thought. Every ounce of confidence he’s managed to build up overnight has vanished completely, his chest deflating in discouragement.
He’s moving a bit too fast and Harry slows him down. “Hey,” Harry clamps a hand on his shoulder, “I love you.”
Draco nods, trying to relax in his seat as the thing takes them higher and higher up. He groans softly. “Peachy.”
Hermione and Ron look at him with bright eyes; watching, waiting for him to acknowledge that something— or someone— has caught his eye.
“I could tell he was in deep just from the way he talked about you. He never had so much to say about Ginny. You can imagine how sick Ron and I were of hearing your name.” The trace of a smile grows on her face. “Harry would tell me all about you, your crazy theories, your love for Scorpius, your singing.”
A laugh is caught in the center of his throat; he was not expecting to hear that after Harry literally
Jaspers looks at him, tilting his head back as if noticing him standing there for the first time. “Oh are you Draco’s boyfriend?”
“—George!” Ginny snarls. Draco feels himself begin to sweat nervously. Fuck, it’s him. He knows it’s him. He’s the bad thing, the reason for this supposed animosity.
“Don’t be a meanie, Potter,” he says with as much snark as he can muster. The day has barely started and he already feels drained. A brutal hangover, panicking, a bit of crying, and now a healthy dose of reignited horniness. Was there no end to his suffering?
“I won’t pressure you to do anything you’re not comfortable with Draco, I swear on my magic and my scar.”
Despite what his dreadfully confusing nightly wank sessions tell him, Malfoy wouldn’t be interested in him as anything more than a friend— if he even agreed to that. It was harder to keep his priorities in line as he watched Malfoy’s finely pressed green skirt sway around his thighs. First talk to him, then try to be his friend. Right.
“In the spirit of saying it like it is, I must point out that it is seven in the morning and while you should be sleeping or better yet, spending time with James, you’re here, cooking me breakfast.” He looks at the sizzling sausages frying on a pan. “And you know I hate sausages.”
“The anti-potion will take at least a month to brew correctly,” Snape mutters, seeming far too unconcerned with the entire matter. He shrugs. “That or longer.”
“I won’t last much longer,” Harry groans into his ear just as he hits a particularly sensitive spot inside him. He runs a hand along his cock, making him whine when he flicks his thumb over the tip. Draco sharply bucks his hips up in approval. This man was going to be the death of him.
“Blaise, I have to ask you something,” he takes two more gulps, because why the hell not? He has to take a breath when the burn in his throat becomes unbearable.
The dark-skinned witch smiles warmly at him, looking strangely pleased by his presence when she appears from behind a cart of self-help books. With a swish of her long dreadlocks and several pressed buttons later, Draco was the proud new owner of an email account.
Relaxing on the hard desk, Draco’s body feels like liquid as Harry sucks him off. He can see outside the window from this angle. Though upside down, the warm, cheery sunshine that was a rarity in dreary England shined down on him, pleasantly warming his face and torso as the tendrils of an orgasm pulled at him. Even Mother Nature was rewarding him for finally getting laid. He thinks he might cry a little.
Once the Slytherins were sufficiently out of earshot, Ron turned on him. “Really Harry?” He asks, his arms incredulously splayed around him.
A large smile that Harry has never before seen on Malfoy's face—both male and female—appears at the description. “Excellent!”
It was so easy to forget how annoyingly studious the prat was underneath all of the thick layers of unpleasantness.
me to hex your bollocks off.” Ferrets are an off-limit topic if this growing tolerance for each other was going to continue.
“You’re going to make this as difficult as possible, aren’t you?” Harry asks, grunting as he tugs Draco along. He had been shuffling his feet in a way that would cause his mother and Charm School tutor to have kittens. “I knew we should have just chanced Apparating,” he grumbles. They couldn’t, because the place Draco had specified was in the middle of Muggle London and without any Apparition points close by, they were doomed to get there the Muggle way.
He picks up a box of mint chocolate biscuits and shakes them angrily. “How can something be both mint
Though when he looks at the large array of ice cream flavors in the little tattered shop they find, he concedes that amusement parks may have
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. He wants better for Harry, he really does. “You're going to have to be more specific.
Potter looks away from the witch, his eyes locking with Draco’s. A joke that must have been about the witch falls flat on his tongue and for a moment Draco wonders if all of those touches and ear-whispers weren’t just Potter failing to live up to the societal expectations of a straight man. Draco was usually weary to look too deep into things that could always mean nothing, but maybe those nothing’s meant something.
The second he stands up, Albus is racing full speed into Draco, making him grunt in pain from the impact of his tiny body demolishing him. “I’ll miss you bunches Mr. Malfoy! You better sing for me when I come home!” He squeezes his midsection so hard Draco wonders if he would ever be able to eat again.
. An astronaut is someone who goes into space. I just look at space.” He won’t lie that he is a bit impressed that Scorpius knows what an astronaut is anyway. That’s mainly a Muggle thing.
Finley’s white hair is the first thing he sees through the opened door, followed by Astoria, looking withdrawn and sickly in a pink silk dress that wears her more than she wears it. She fiddles with her earring, the flash of white teeth digging into her bottom lip. They sit under the crystal chandelier Draco purchased years ago, sitting in the lap of luxury and surrounded by fancy antiques that have no real meaning as they watch the flames from the fireplace flicker endlessly.
Harry gasps and Draco jumps away as they stare at Lily’s surprised face staring back at them. The silence is so strong that Draco can feel himself melting in his seat from embarrassment like a naughty first year. Fuck, he had completely forgotten about Harry’s kids.
She sets her wand down beside her and he does the same, extinguishing the only visible light in the room aside from the Waxing Moon. The grey light catches the defined edges of her cheekbones and the top of her cupid’s bow. He looks away, another memory fresh in his mind from the sight. Harry in Diagon Alley, his deep, disapproving scowl glaring down at him, the pink words reflected across his face.
Maybe that is the change his falsely poetic horoscope foresaw. If so, he thinks he can live with that.
He finally looks up from his shirt, his huge grey eyes still swimming in tears. Draco’s stomach bottoms out when he correctly predicts the next word from his son’s trembling mouth. “Sing?”
The second night was a bit more bearable. After he pushed down his pride, Draco realized that there was value in being held while you slept. At least if those arms holding you are Harry Potter’s. Still, it doesn’t help his restlessness throughout the night. Draco finds that he’s very good at organizing things in the dead of night. Harry’s teacup collection is arranged in a beautifully neat order by the time he wakes up in the morning.
“It’s more professional.” His braid twitches in agreement across his finely pressed robes. “Besides, I’m hoping they won’t care what my hair looks like after the experiment is done.”
Draco elbows him in the ribs. “Shut up,” he hisses, but he’s laughing too much for it to have any real venom behind the words.
Her voice is sharp and commanding. He blinks twice when he sees some of the passion that he thought she lost years ago spring to life in her eyes. “Out.” When he doesn’t move she shoots out of her seat, a glass of wine spilling as she destabilizes the small table.
This was pointless. Who are they, outside of their children? It was a bit scary to consider; Draco’s identity had been cultivated around being a father for so long, he’s almost forgotten about the things he used to do. What was he, underneath the ten years spent raising Scorpius?
Unfortunately, Malfoy seems to be full of questions today because ten minutes later and he still has not come out of the room. Too curious and far too stubborn to admit defeat, Harry finds himself pressed against the door of the Potion’s classroom, one ear pressed against the wood. He can only distinguish a few warbled sentences and phrases from the conversation.
The words leave a bitter taste in his mouth and he wishes it was tangible so that maybe he could spit it out or wash it away with a cup of hot tea. Instead, he’s forced to live with it.
James holds out his fist to him. Draco stares at it, unable to decide what to do with his outstretched hand.
As subtle as a brick wall. “Come off it Harry, I’m not daft. We both know this is my gift for not being a stubborn arse anymore. It’s actually kind of sweet that you think I don’t know this. But I don’t see why a dome is a suitable gift.” He squints his eyes at the name of the white building etched in block letters as they walk closer. “Or a… planetarium?”
Potter.” He does that deep purring thing with his voice again, the sound going straight to his groin and settling there like a phantom ache.
comet was about to finish its orbit around the Sun this month and he had to be careful of his emotions influencing his magic during this time. Balance was important, but so was figuring out why Harry Potter’s presence continued to be a constant in his life.
Clearly, Harry’s warning didn’t have much of an effect on their noise level because when they peek through the crack of the door, their children were far louder than they left them.
Harry groans, a small, painfully endearing frown on his face. He obliges anyway, coming close enough to Draco so that they were chest to chest. Taking Harry’s hands in his, he wandlessly
This was all types of wrong. Scorpius was enamored with Potter’s son and his teacher for Merlin’s sake, he couldn’t start having illicit thoughts about Potter now. He was freshly divorced and Potter was with the Weaselette—no
Draco stays up past dark, restless, waiting for the inevitable moment when Harry comes back and tells him that it was a disaster, that James still hates him—hates the both of them.
. Can you believe it? He understands, Draco. He’s still angry of course, we have years of tension to work out, but it’s a start, isn’t it?”
, Draco. You’re too good. Too… too…” A small trail of sweat glides down his exposed neckline, glistening under the soft yellow bedroom light. “You also have the prettiest arsehole in all of bloody England.” His eyes snap open when he realizes what he just said.
“I meant to thank you for coming on such short notice. Your timing is rather impressive.” She gives him a soft smile as she works, curiosity etched into the corners of it.
It’s when Harry bids them a good day and the parents leave the room one by one does Draco make his move.
upset.” He pauses. “And don’t tell your Dad either please? I don’t want to make him upset too. I always make things worse when I say things I should keep to myself.”
He and Scorpius rarely return home during those long summer weeks. September 1st was arriving faster than anyone expected and they both agreed that they’ll rather spend their last few weeks with the Potters than in their cold, empty home.
Draco rolls his eyes. He takes a healthy swig of his whiskey and glares at him. The darkness shrouds his face in foreboding shadows, making him look far more dangerous than he actually was. To him, Potter will always be that annoying little Gryffindor constantly showing him up as he parades around the castle with his stupid glasses and stupider scar. If he had claws he would take a gratifying swipe at Potter's face. Maybe do him a welcomed service and claw that horrifically ugly scar off.
Another hex. This one hits his back and sends him hissing as the pain of the Stinging Hex travels up his spine.
A ball of tension wells up in his chest, and Draco can sense what’s about to happen from the way his left eye twitches and a rush of heat floods his nose. His nerves are hot, as his mother would call it, sending prickly pockets of pain to his hands and feet.
His unheard goodbye is left on his lips and Draco felt a piece of his heart crack like glass as he watched his son run away from him.
at the pile of ash, just to give his magic something to take his anger out on. The flames evaporate themselves in the air with a crisp
Percy murmurs the reply in the inside of his shirt, but if Draco’s hearing served him correctly, he could have swore he said something about being caught wanking in the Prefect’s bathroom.
discuss this? I understand that you’re stressed about Scorpius, but can we please have an actual conversation about you first? You had the worst panic attack I’ve ever seen, we can’t just brush that aside and pretend it never happened. ”
An unshaven father sitting on a stoop next to him chuckles, nodding towards the crows. “Crazy birds eh?”
“Ginny, I’m going to tell him,” Harry says into her hair with the utmost conviction. “You were right.”
“Since you asked to be Hermione’s friend. If you’re friends with her and she’s friends with me, that makes you a friend by association.” Malfoy sneers. “Sorry,” he shrugs, “I don’t make the rules.”
He stills. He knows that voice. That’s the voice Harry uses when he wants something. Draco straightens back, dropping back down in front of the fireplace and staring warily at him. “Well? Be a Gryffindor and spit it out.” He crinkles his nose. “You clearly want something from me.”
Potter crosses his arms and watches as Ana helps Scorpius settle into her room. He tsks disappointingly. “Glasses aren’t
Watching his best friends’ brother die would be one way, Draco thinks. And Aurors. He knows that now, so he’ll be increasingly cautious not to abuse that knowledge.
“Right, right,” she concedes, a barmy smile on her face. “You can’t blame me for trying though. I mean, if you’re fucking Harry Potter I want a teacher of my own to shag.” She holds up a finger to silence his protests. “And before you start raving to me about how you’re not sleeping with Potter, let me just point out that you should. And you definitely want to.”
He kisses the top of his head, rocking him gently in his arms like a toddler. Scorpius always needed a lot of reassurance and Draco was more than willing to give it to him.
left him in the care of two adults you trust before getting foxed. I’d say that you’re a better father than you’re giving yourself credit for.”
A broad-shouldered man dressed in fancy, deep red Auror robes steps into the lift with them, nodding respectfully at Harry and ignoring Draco entirely. Draco internally curses himself when Harry’s fingers on his braid stop moving. Fuck, fuck, fuck. How he have been so stupid?
The past and the present smack him across the face when he turns and sees Harry Potter standing behind them, looking dreadfully intimidating with his broad frame and crossed arms.
Draco traces circles around his nipple with his forefinger, eliciting another moan from that too. “I love that you fall asleep after one orgasm too—you should be grateful, not many other people would love that about you.”
When Lily’s lower lip begins to turn into a small pout, Draco knows he’s going to crack very, very soon. She clasps her hands together. “Please Mr. Malfoy?” Her little voice is so bloody adorable and Draco doesn’t know how Harry can stand to
Harry chuckles, imagining Lucius catching a seven-year old Draco playing in his mother’s fancy high heels. He removes his hand and brings Draco closer to his body as they dance. “You could bring home a very nice Half-Blood wizard instead?”
While he’s looking up at the stars, sighing at its beauty, Harry’s looking at him, the corners of his eyes crinkling from smiling at Draco’s delight.
It’s moments like this—the moments where each breath is ragged and strained—where Draco realizes how often he takes air for granted.
It takes a bit more prodding and a lot more reassurance before he finally gets Harry to come off his self-imposed leash. This was good for him and Draco could sacrifice a bit of his comfort if that meant his happiness.
She gives him a pretty, slightly confused smile. “Yes, I’ll need your email address.” Her tone is patient but it only increases his nervousness further. He could just hear the seconds on his watch
Harry relaxes his tense body and he sighs in contentment, looking as though a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. “Whew. Well, I don’t know about you, but I feel much better now that I told you that!” Those damn dimples appear. He rolls over to his side, head in hand and grins stupidly. “Being honest feels great.”
Malfoy’s easy enough to track. He can hear him spitting out drying spell after drying spell in between cursing
“You can’t cook,” he points out, clutching onto his whisk a bit tighter than necessary. Harry had eaten his spaghetti on those rare times Draco attempted to impress him with his limited culinary skills, and it was suffice to say that Draco was clearly not the cook in this relationship. He still hasn’t forgotten how Harry tried to spit the noodles in a napkin when he thought he wasn’t looking.
Scorpius looks thoughtful for a moment, fiddling with the worn edges of Draco’s parchment book as he formulates his response. “No, I don’t think so,” he admits. “Just as long as you aren’t sad like you were with Mum.”
“Scorp!” Albus calls, grinning like a madman. He places Batman, his new black, white-faced owl, on his trunk. “You ready?”
After several more minutes of reassuring Ana that yes, Scorpius is fine, no there’s nothing going on at home, yes he’ll be at the next PTA meeting, and somewhat convincing her that a Harvest Moon actually can affect people’s emotions but without mentioning magic, of course, he finally gets her to join the other students back outside and he leaves to go back over to his son.
Malfoy looks at him with hooded eyes. “Oh come on Potter,” his voice is light, with a flirty edge to it. “Don’t tell me a bit of tits bother you.” He puffs out his chest to further taunt him.
He has him stumped. Hell, no one's ever asked him that. Sometimes people ask questions about his profession or his research and he would answer them, all the while watching as their eyes glaze over from dead boredom, mouths closing in perpetual apathy. But no one’s particularly cared about the
Albus waits several breaths after Scorpius finishes venting before saying, “My godbrother Teddy gets like that too before a full moon. Your dad looks at the moon, right? He should know then. Dad usually makes sure he has a big batch of wolf juice beforehand so he’s not so jumpy. Maybe he could try that?”
“Draco.” She removes his hands and grips them tight, her eyes bore into his, the color darker than he remembers. “I’m not going to tell you to go to a Mind Healer. Or take potions that made you feel like a hollow shell. Trust me, I’ve been there and I understand the hesitation. But what I will tell you is this,” She holds up the piece of glass in between her thumb and forefinger. “When you feel that tug in your chest, try to hold onto something that’s real. Tangible. If you can feel something as simple as a piece of glass, you’re not dying. You just need to breathe.”
Draco laughs dryly. “Besides, Scorpius not being properly fed, or looked after, or sent to school for a week? I guess you could say nothing happened. But that isn’t much of the problem, is it? The problem is that anything
So instead he clamps his mouth shut and lets the soft pidder padder of rain hitting the roof shingles speak for him. Because how can he ask Harry Potter why in the hell would he want him, when he could have the world?
He wouldn’t be mad if it was simply a bad mark on his exam. School was always going to be a struggle and Scorpius was still learning Muggle culture like he was; if anything, he had grasped onto it far easier than Draco had.
and the sound of the horn blasting in the station hovel vibrates around them, raising the wisps of hair from his messily done braid. Draco watches as she captures his hand, slipping a large metal object onto his finger and parting their connected embrace with a kiss on his knuckles.
“Please don’t,” his voice crackles pathetically and he wishes he had another swing of that Firewhiskey. Just a bit more alcohol to dull the things he doesn’t want to feel. “I don’t want to go back there. 'S too cold. Soon too empty.”
That’s another thing on his to-do list. He’ll have to inform Scorpius that pictures in the Muggle world don’t move. Lest the Statute of Secrecy be broken by an overly earnest ten year old, he’s beginning to realize that there’s going to be a lot about Muggles that Draco will have to explain.
Jaspers laughs. “It’s not anything you should apologize for mate, we’re all always growing. Besides, I have a feeling that you’re just naturally a bit grumpy.”
A strangled sound tears through his throat and he has to physically push Harry away with his legs to keep from coming in his mouth. “Too much. Gonna come if you keep doing that.”
his letter immediately. No, instead he smoothes out the crumpled parchment and throws it in the fireplace, watching as the inked words fade to black, then ash, then nothing at all.
Scorpius smiles, prompting Draco to go on like it does in the song. They usually do it together, with both of them having memorized the entire song front to back. The male’s lyrics were silly, singing about free shampoo and eating shirts, but it always made Scorpius laugh and now it makes Albus chuckle. He honestly forgot that he and Potter were still in the room.
to know when he’ll sod off so he can go home and cry in the shower. But what’s the point of spreading anymore negativity? This would be the last time he sees him anyway. He folds his arms over his chest, sighing, “Sure Jaspers. Give it a go.”
“You’re so dramatic,” Harry snickers when Draco purrs while he strokes his hair. “You’ve always been so theatrical.”
“Please don’t,” Blaise groans. He turns to Draco. “Yeah, her hormones are totally shot and your ridiculously adorable kid isn’t helping.”
Harry’s rumbling laughter vibrates against his cheek and he sighs under his breath. Harry’s tugging at the base of his braid again with shy fingers, and Draco wants to tell him that it’s okay to touch his hair if he wants to. Hell, he’ll let him do a lot more things if he wants to.
He’s promised Scorpius he would do this. He promised, and Draco doesn’t go back to a promise he made his son. So he’ll march into that school building and talk the ears off of his son’s Muggle school teacher even if it kills him.
Harry’s name is doused in his mouth, and he knows from the way his tongue pushes deeper along the inside of his cheek and grazes along the ridges of his roof, that he can taste it too.
He methodically stirs his tea over and over again, just watching Potter’s hands move as he cooks. Potter catches him staring and gestures to the array of cooking tools and ingredients littered across his counter. “Want to help?”
He follows her directions verbatim, though not needing to remember the last part when he hears loud crying from the third door down. He takes a deep breath. This wasn’t going to be pretty.
“Aww they grow up so fast, don’t they?” Ginny cooes, leaping up behind them and squeezing both Harry and Draco in her strong arms. Draco has a feeling that Ginny Weasley could kill a man if prompted. He’s suddenly terrified of the man Albus will become.
A scandalized gasp captures their attention. Next to them, Kacia removes her sunglasses, watching with wide eyes and an open, pink mouth while her bratty son squirms in her grip.
He turns sharply to the left to reach for a quill and whips Harry in the face with his long braid for the
he waggles his eyebrows in Harry’s directions. Harry snorts, knowing that Draco was referring to his promise of blowjobs. He continues, frowning slightly as he reads,
The stars look especially beautiful tonight, nearly as bright as the tip of his wand as he lights the rolled gillyweed with lazy movements.
“Excuse me?” Potter waves an envelope in between his two fingers. “Give me that,” he snatches the paper out of Potter’s grip.
The wards are down, allowing him to Apparate inside to the living room of his old home. He’s never realized how silent this house was until he’s standing in the foyer. It’s empty too— though the art on the walls and hand picked accent pieces would give the impression that there’s life springing from the floorboards.
“I’ll talk to Neville and Ron,” Harry assures him. It was going to be the most awkward talk he had ever had with them but he’ll do it if it’ll make Malfoy feel more comfortable.
He hates to admit it, but he can breathe a bit easier once he’s away from the Weasley matriarch. Regardless of her motherly spirit, she reminds him of things he had no right to forget but hated remembering.
“Astoria…” As happy as he was to hear that she was going to a Mind Healer, Draco doesn’t think he can stand to hear another person telling him about the wonders of therapy.
s by a comedic amount, though this seems to spur on Malfoy even more. The Snitch in sight and he’s readying himself to reach his hand down and grab it when Malfoy rams into his broom, forcing him to grip onto the handle for dear life or risk sending himself back into Madam Pomfrey’s care. They’re mere feet off the ground now, both beginning to bottom out to catch the Snitch before the other.
In France, he’s an astronomer. In England, he’s a war criminal. It’s terrifying. Draco never liked being discussed in spaces absent of his presence.
He swallows and nods a bit too quickly. “Yeah, yeah I’m fine. I’ll head back to class in a few, just need to sort some things out.”
Harry pushes him onto his back on the table, the forceful action causing a dull ache in his head when it hits the wooden desk unexpectedly. He’s about to curse him for being such a buggering brute when Harry’s warm mouth engulfs him inch by inch and immediately all is forgiven.
Harry sets the bowl down with clang and rolls his neck. The bones pop from stiffness and Draco winces. “Fine. You want the truth? I am avoiding James. For good reason too. Sometimes I feel like he’s just waiting to explode, you know? With Al and Lily, I can tell what they're thinking without them even having to say it. James on the other hand…”
“Thank you so much, Hermione,” Malfoy gushes when he pulls away. Harry blanches. Since when did Malfoy call her
If there was nothing else that spoke to Draco's perpetual singleness, even when he had been married to Astoria, it was that he was very unused to sleeping in a bed with another person. For the entirety of his life, Draco had slept by himself, curled in his own blanket and dozing in a world of his own.
Harry blinks. He grabs his glasses from the side table to ensure that he wasn’t dreaming and that Draco, the real Draco,
Harry snickers behind James’ back, a joke on his lips that’s cut off when James gives him a quick side hug. “Bye Dad.”
Astoria’s father. Draco knew he’ll hear from him soon enough, but how tactless does someone have to be to convince their gay former son-in-law to remarry their daughter through a bloody gift basket? He rummages through the basket Potter sits on his desk. Inside are fancy jewelry and chocolates for him. Draco wrinkles his nose. No thanks. He doesn’t need jewelry and those chocolates are probably spiked with an illegal love potion.
Then he coughs pointedly, clearly wanting to shift away from the topic of the war and his Mark. Harry doesn’t need a second hint.
Maybe it wasn’t Potter who was the problem. Or Albus. Maybe it was him and his desperation to cling onto the past despite his attempts to look towards the future. A bit of honesty is as good of a start as any.
“Wass dat?” Scorpius asks through a full mouth of noodles. Draco wrinkles his nose. He usually isn’t such a messy eater, but spaghetti has a way of bringing out the grubby side of any ten year old.
He doesn’t answer, sweeping him around the building and letting him gawk at the vivid pictures of constellations and nebulae at his leisure. Stars, galaxies, planets. Some of them that he’s spent years researching and some that he hadn’t even known existed.
Draco lifts his chin up with his forefinger, pulling his gaze to his smirking face. “On your knees Potter. I believe I’m owed something.”
“Where is Pot—Harry?” His tongue feels disgustingly fuzzy speaking his given name. “Doesn’t he like work here or something?” Slacking on the job? How very unusual for the Golden Prat.
There’s a long pause and Harry wonders if he was going to ignore him forever. It didn’t matter anyway, seeing that Harry was going to come up there if Malfoy didn’t answer him in the next five minutes.
Draco’s breath hitches and he bends down so that he can be at eye level with his son. He digs in his pocket, pulling out the green stuff dragon. He can hardly see, his vision a blur from the accumulating tears in his eyes.
Constant would be generous. It’s more like a never-ending plague. Potter comes and goes into his life all the time like he has the right and Draco wants to know why.
He sighs. Blaise was his best friend, far before he had even met Pansy. He wouldn’t judge him, right? They weren’t in Hogwarts anymore for Merlin’s sake. “I’m coming through.”
Scorpius looks up at him, his brows flushed together in pondering. “But Dad, we haven’t sold a—” He grunts loudly in protest when Draco clasps a firm hand over his mouth.
Harry snorts childishly. “Well then in that case I guess I shouldn’t apologize for having a huge cock either.”
The gift basket falls into a crumpled heap on the grassy backyard when Draco violently tosses it out the door. The comics spill out onto the grass, the cover image of Martin Miggs smiling moronically up to the grey sky. He’s never been happier to have a fence around his backyard because his Muggle neighbors will not appreciate what he’s about to do.
Molly pulled him aside before they left, entwining her firm hand in his shaking one as she apologized for James’ words and for a man who can’t produce a Patronus anymore because all of his happiest memories are shared with an empty seat.
Sometimes, a Total Eclipse can release not only feelings of anxiety and dread, but feelings of yearning too. The feeling of needing something that you’ve been wanting for a very, very long time.
“You are 31 years old, Draco. I will not listen to another Potter rant at this age. Either decide what you want to do with him, or leave him be.”
Harry’s hands are gripping the sides of his chair, his brown knuckles turning light. He cranes his head up to look at Draco, his eyes wary and large. “You are
However, the one thing he absolutely cannot compromise on in this relationship was cooking. He was currently at an embarrassing loss trying to figure out how to cut the carrots properly. Why couldn’t they just use magic? A simple slicing charm would suffice.
Malfoy smiles at him softly, balancing on his knees so that his face was poised downwards towards Harry’s. Harry’s fingers twitch when he looks up and sees Malfoy’s long hair cascading down beside him in a silvery curtain on each side of his face. He likes his hair better this way; open and soft looking. He can smell the clean scent as the wind flows through the strands, several locks of hair tickling Harry’s cheeks as the winter air pushes the tresses towards him. It also didn’t hurt when the hair hit him in the face like the sodding braid did.
Ginny, Harry, their children, and Scorpius busy themselves by taking pictures while Draco desperately scans the platform. 10:40. No Astoria. Harry’s eyes darken apologetically at him in between their picture taking. With each minute he waits, the more his eyes sting and his fingers twitch.
mean he likes them. He still doesn’t even like Gryffindors. Not really. Truth be told, he merely tolerates Harry and Draco simply has a desire not to see any of his smarmy little friends get their feelings hurt. Harry Potter wasn’t the only soul with an unfortunate savior complex.
“I wanted to place him to experience a bit more diversity at this stage in his life,” he states as honestly as he can.
He’ll let Harry indulge him in as much weird Muggle shite as he pleases, but Draco still doesn’t see how a dome is exciting in any way, shape, or form. He resigns himself to pretend to act excited because he’s absolutely positive nothing in that building is that interesting.
The resounding snort from Harry reverberates around the dark room. “Scorpius is one of my best students. The only student who fails my exams is Albus. Why?”
There’s no time for talking, because several minutes later he’s coming down from his climax, his breathing erratic as he lays on Harry’s damp chest and stares up at the dark ceiling.
She owls back two days later, promising to meet at the spot Draco specified no later than 10:30. He takes her word for it, shoving the letter away in his bottom desk drawer.
Draco laughs again, feeling that fiery sensation of adrenaline rush through his veins from another successful experiment. “Can you believe that that’s only one of the dozens of experiments I have? The rest are based on planetary motions, orbital patterns, supernovas… I’m assuming you're convinced?”
Draco laughs softly. He spins Harry without warning then yanks him close to his body, leaning backwards slightly and gripping his waist to prepare for his body weight. There’s not a single moment where he falters in the fluid motion.
Putting one foot in front of the other, Draco makes his way up the staircase leading into the school, remembering those breathing techniques Astoria taught him all those years ago. She may have been a shite mother, but he couldn’t deny that she was an excellent person to have around during a panic attack.
Scorpius mutters something about no PDA being allowed on school property and Draco thumps him on the arm right as he enters the room.
Dumbfounded, he stares at her, his interest in Malfoy momentarily lost. “I— what?” The truth? What truth?
Draco smirks. Always the skeptic. He juts a thumb behind him with a confident ease. “Look at the tides of the water fountain.”
Hands entwined, Draco leads him up the dark staircase, past the empty walls that have yet to be filled with art and life, and into his study on the third floor. There’s a surprised gasp behind him and he turns to find Harry gaping at the fluttering star constellation on Draco’s black office ceiling.
Snatching the basket, Draco storms past Potter, thankful that Scorpius and Albus were too busy braiding Puff fur in Scorpius’ room that they don’t hear Draco’s growls of anger or his heavy footsteps on the hardwood.
“Oh and I’m supposing you’ve found it?” He fixes the laughing Slytherin with a pointed look. Harry wasn’t daft, he knew where the clitoris was. It was like, somewhere inside, right?
Kacia melts into her seat as Areum proudly wheels up to the front of the room. Oh how sweet karma could be sometimes.
“No. Never.” Scorpius was an unexpected rose in such a god awful situation. He would do it all over again if he had to. “I just wish…I wish someone would have told me that she would. Regret it, I mean.” He sets the wine down, pinching his stinging nose as he remembers all that she didn’t do.
Not wanting to admit that Hermione did have a point, Harry plows forward. “Either of us? I don’t recall Hermione being mad at me?” Harry protests. She had no real reason to be upset with him, he wasn’t the one who talked about Malfoy’s body in front of her. Then again, he didn’t stop Ron from doing so either.
But it’s what’s at the bottom of the basket that ignites him. Scorpius’ name is printed on several new copies of Martin the Mad Muggle comics.
The newspaper dangles from his fingers. “I doubt his theory applies to a horoscope in the—” he looks at the cover sporting a busty blonde and one of those Muggle Princes that was always in the news for something, “
He wraps his hands around hers. Holds them close to his chest and kisses one dry knuckle apologetically. “Will you come to visit? I lied before, with your Father. Scorpius does miss you, he doesn’t say it sometimes, but I know he does.”
Malfoy’s hands are curled into tiny fists under the ill-fitting sleeves of his robe. Harry backs away, experienced enough to know when it was too dangerous to be near the Slytherin. “Pansy, shut up,” he growls through painfully clenched teeth.
He thins his lips. “Is there something you need, Jaspers?” He keeps walking, heading towards the dusty conference room where the presentation proposals are held, wondering if he spins around fast enough if he can hit Jaspers in the eye with his braid. It was one of the nastier advantages of having long hair.
He shakes his head, reminding himself that he doesn’t care about the romantic afflictions of Slytherins and follows a healthy distance behind them until they’re in a relatively quiet area.
Draco shakes his head frantically, not caring about Potter’s ramblings on his very responsible adult habits. “No, no I need to see him for myself! I need to make sure—” he’s shaking now, his hands finding their way back into his ruffled hair.
Resolving to fly off some steam to clear his head of all Malfoy-related things before the match, Harry readies himself on his broom, only to be nearly knocked down by the broom of a certain Slytherin landing next to him.
He moves in front of him, swiftly stopping his fast-paced walking. “Want to know your future?” His pudgy hand palms his breast pocket where Draco knows he keeps his tarot cards. “Geminis are predicted to have a good week, maybe you’ll get lucky?” His smile is brighter than his obscenely orange hair and Draco feels his insides churn. It was worse than Weasley’s and that was saying something.
After Potions. That’s when he tells himself he’ll do it. Malfoy almost always stays behind to drag further information from Snape about the potion work. He truly was the male version of Hermione, only Snape didn’t seem to mind going into the theoretical aspects of each brew with Malfoy as he did for Hermione.
But Harry doesn’t know this. He doesn’t know that Draco hasn’t felt another pair of lips against his own in over a decade or the shock of how good a simple kiss was enough to take him off guard. He just laughs with him, leaning against his body for support as they cackle over Lily’s shocked face.
The fourth and fifth tears fall down and soon he’s losing count because it's the first day of spring and Harry Potter’s just brought him flowers completely unprompted simply because he can and because he
Okay, and he also couldn’t help but notice how positively adorable Malfoy looked, with his doe-like, shining eyes looking up at him. Despite everything, his eyes remained the same; a familiar color of grey mist. He thinks he understands Parkinson’s Kneazle comment. He never thought he'd see the day when Draco Malfoy was cuter than a Kneazle.
Usually, Draco would bristle and snap at someone for asking so many questions of him, yet he’s finding patience for her. She at least seems relatively harmless. As much as he was loathed to admit it, it has everything to do with the fact that she’s a Muggle. It sounds unfair but their cluelessness was refreshing. “London’s nice but Paris is…
“Will do Malfoy.” He turns, giving Draco a warm look. Something that feels suspiciously like endearment bubbles up into the center of his chest, unyielding and nagging. Stupid Potter and his stupidly green eyes. “See you at the next PTA meeting yeah?”
“Leave…” Draco clutches at his throat with tingling fingertips. There was no chance at breathing. He was going to die, he can feel it in the way his throat is closing up and the way his heart was so fast it might explode in his chest. Or maybe it has already exploded and what he was feeling was just the aftermath. Harry keeps talking to him in a low, soothing voice to breathe but all Draco needs is for him to just
And an idiot, though his pride wouldn’t allow him to admit it aloud. He, like to stupid sod he was, actually
Malfoy blanched. “The other one’s a fourth year. That’s just gross. And of course the last is me. Joy.”
Making a point to chew widely and swallowing loudly, Scorpius shrugs. “I guess. What’s a PT… is that an ‘A’?”
Draco’s fingers seek out Harry’s, entwining them on the finely polished wooden table top for her to see. She raises her chin in silent approval.
Though, when Draco catches his reflection in the mirror late that night, wearing his hair down no longer feels like a compromise.
“Dad!” Scorpius runs over and clings to Draco the second he sees him walk through the door. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so so sorry.”
“I will. I’ll miss you too Albus,” he says, genuinely meaning it. He hugs the rowdy boy for all but five seconds before he’s off again, waving goodbye to everyone, even strangers, and racing around to grab his stuff. Merlin, he’s really going to miss this crazy kid.
Scorpius scampers up off the staircase outside, clinging onto his hand and looking up at Draco’s face with expectant nervousness. “So? How did it go?”
It’s not enough to be interpreted as anything but a simple touch, but from the way Potter sucks in a quick breath, Draco knows that he feels it too.
“And Grandma makes a massive fruit cake!” Albus explains excitedly as they walk to the closest Apparition point near the school. “And Uncle Ron beats everyone in chess!” He puffs out his chest, “Except for me of course.”
A car flies by, lifting Scorpius’ hair and Draco’s stylish Muggle cloak from its impressive velocity. Draco smooths out the wind-mused strands of blonde on his son’s head, easing the hair back behind his ears with soft fingers.
A powerful gush of water streamlines towards Malfoy, knocking him off of his broom when it hits him square in the chest. Staining his pure white shirt. His
Harry’s cock pushes deeper and deeper into him, reaching places that Draco forgot could even bring pleasure. He couldn’t even imagine just how good Harry would feel writhing under his thighs as Draco rides him, slow and steady, with his hands pinned above his head. Harry would probably make those little noises he’s making now as Draco stares down at him…
The cooking food smells delicious but Draco still twists his nose in distaste at the mention of the pesky Animagus. “That sodding hag still making the lives of witches and wizards miserable?” He didn't think that she
was the one that just got assaulted. “Really what?” His voice is raw and he touches his throat gingerly. Malfoy really did have a grip on him.
She has to drag Burns away from Albus as Areum wheels up to the front of the room and begins to talk about her work as a professional boxing coach. Though Draco has no idea what boxing was, it sounded brutal enough to make Kacia squirm in her seat.
Malfoy narrows his eyes and Harry can practically see him weighing the consequences of telling him. He finally takes a deep breath and huddles in on himself.
He rolls his eyes. “Pizza,” he mutters. “And not yet. Though Princess ate most of the spaghetti I gave him.”
. Closes one eye and then the other, watching the star shift when he looks at it from a different angle.
“Well for one because he is Draco bloody Malfoy! Who cares how attractive he looks; he’s the same blonde demon that endangered everyone we love by letting Death Eaters and Greyback into the school.”
Draco dealt with the Dark Lord, slinking through his home, wilting everything in his presence with his dark magic. With nearly being burned alive and having his skin sliced open. Taking a potion would be like putting a tiny plaster on an open, festering wound. There was no point, so why try?
Pansy rolls her eyes, mouth set into a bored line. “Oh here we go again,” she sighs. “Darling, have you ever considered the possibility of just not giving a fuck about what Scorpius thinks?”
Draco laughs to himself, ignoring the bewildered stares of the several witches and wizards around him. He must look unhinged and smell like a bar. He wishes he had some gillyweed on him. Misery loves both company and alcohol.
Unwilling to sit here and be a part of Potter’s circus show any longer, he clutches to the edge of his seat, waiting for the perfect moment to slip out unnoticed.
Placing his hand on the headboard above, Draco forced them to still, staring up at Harry with a wide, open mouth. “I—
Breathing in the sharp, crisp air, he absentmindedly wonders who Malfoy’s going to the Yule with. If he decided to at all. He wonders if Malfoy would mind going with him.
make sense. Malfoy never took the time to explain any of Harry’s mistakes in Potions nor did he ever cease to antagonize him over his accidents in class. Until recently, Harry still never heard the end of it from Malfoy when he accidentally turned his shoes blue from a spilled potion in third year.
All in all, the last person he expects to see staring down at him with a raised brow and pursed lips, is Hermione Granger.
“Yours is.” His face collapses in another wave of pure embarrassment. “Please stop talking to me before I say something worse.”
In a rare bout of unsureness, Albus bites his bottom lip and gives Draco a little wave. “Hi Mr. Malfoy.”
With a curled finger he summons Harry to him, tilting his neck to show off all of the unmarked pale skin Harry was free to abuse at his will. Harry cups his cheek in his palm and Draco melts into the warmth. “Never make me wait that long again,” he sighs just as Harry’s lips suck on the bone of his collar, creating a path up his neck and along his jaw. “Never.”
She plays with a bit of the broken glass, a large piece with a smooth texture that she rubs her thumb over in even strokes. “And then he told me something else. He told me that you hate large crowds. Which, I mean, who
“So I’m guessing that means you can’t walk,” Potter grunts. He’s having to grip Draco underneath his arms to keep him from taking a nosedive. Draco blows a raspberry at him, his braid feeling too heavy for his head. “And I can’t chance Apparating without getting you Splinched to death.” Sighing, he makes a single swooping motion and lifts Draco off the ground and onto his shoulder. Tomorrow, he’ll hex Potter’s bollocks off for carrying him like a damsel in distress. But for now, he’ll allow it. “Salazar,” Potter exclaims, “Do you even eat? You’re so light!”
The worst part out of the entire day was that when he finally finished cleaning the cauldron and hurriedly raced to the Quidditch field, Malfoy and several other Slytherins were all sitting the sidelines, rooting for Ravenclaw and wearing the infamous Potter Stinks badges as promised.
He hears a groan and Neville leans up from behind him, whispering sharply. “Come on, Harry, if you keep letting Malfoy get to you, you’ll get all of our house points taken away!”
“Fuck,” Harry breathes in his ear. Draco pushes several sweaty black locks from his forehead, silently agreeing with the monosyllabic sentiment. Fuck indeed. He’s just shagged Harry Potter and he must say that the world's favorite hero certainly did not disappoint.
tall white guy. From what Ana tells me, he was in the Royal Navy, so that’s part of why he’s such a hardarse about everything. She hates him too, everyone does.”
He doesn’t listen. He’s not quite there. George laughs, seeming to rib something with his elbow in the empty seat next to him.
He ends up buying all 100 boxes of the biscuits himself, his stubbornness refusing to let a Potter best him in anything, even a ridiculous school sale. At least the boxes didn’t entirely go to waste though. Pansy was particularly grateful for Draco’s donation to her pregnancy craving list and took all 100 without complaint.
He jumps in surprise when Potter throws his head back and laughs. Several people’s eyes are drawn in their direction from Potter’s booming laughter. “Stalking you? Malfoy, you do realize that we would inevitably be in the same room together?” He cocks his head, genuinely concerned that he may be too stupid to understand. “I’m your son’s teacher for goodness sake, you should expect to see me.”
Unfortunately, peace was a rarity these days. There was a world to rebuild, bridges that needed to be formed, and a female Draco Malfoy that consumed his mind most of the day. The male version did too, but Harry tried to suppress those thoughts. Somehow, it made the entire attraction thing worse. Fancying a girl was one thing, but fancying a girl who was actually a bloke though at the moment a girl was… well, Harry didn’t know what to call it.
“What are we gonna do next Dad?” She doesn’t give him a chance to speak when she excitedly suggests something called a fairy wheel. “That’s the only good ride left.”
Tears prick his eyes, pouring down his cheeks when he flexes his jaw and pain blossoms everywhere. He only sees a wet, white figure stomping off of the field as everyone is still reeling from the exciting match.
Blaise rolls his eyes. “Her hormones are all over the place. I didn’t know it was possible to get baby fever when you were already pregnant.”
So it seems that The Savior is a talker during sex. He never thought he’d be so thankfully for his incoherent babbling before. It’s so much better than the awkward silence he and Astoria shared.
” Everyone shakes their heads. Potter gives an exaggerated gasp, feigning shock that they haven’t heard of such a story. “No? Well then settle in, I have a very true and very wonderful story to tell.”
He draws Harry into a dip before he could protest, his leg placed precariously close to his inner thigh. He makes a show of pressing closer to the crotch inseam of his trousers.
Blaise Zabini slams his palm on the table and gleefully declares in a voice far too reminiscent of a certain former headmaster, “A 100 points to Slytherin!” The other Slytherins laugh and Malfoy blows Harry a pouty-lipped air kiss. Harry seethes silently, the spoon in his fist threatening to bend.
An unpleasant sting in his nose travels up to his eyes. He covers them with the palms of his hands. “I don’t try to be irrational; I don’t want to be. It just…the irrational thoughts always make sense, it always makes sense in my head.”
He nods and she slides her hand over, tentatively wrapping her dainty fingers around his hand. After a moment’s hesitation, he squeezes back.
Scorpius. Gone. He knew there would be a time when his son wouldn’t be right under his constant eye but he never thought it would happen by way of Astoria.
“Would you look at that?” Harry murmurs, shaking Draco on his shoulder. “Every day offers unexpected miracles, huh?”
“Her?” Draco nods. “Oh, that’s Sachi, Sagitta’s sister actually.” He smiles fondly, moving closer so that his hair was tickling Draco’s cheek. “There’s a lot more witches and wizards in Muggle London than people think. You should meet their mother, she’s Nigerian and apparently the Muggles there are far more knowledgeable of magical communities than the Muggles here are.”
He takes a deep breath, even though he doesn’t need to but because everything was, for once in his adult life, fine. “I’m…good, actually.” Draco takes another deep breath because he really can’t believe it. He smiles at Harry. “Really good.”
The chatty blonde woman with awfully thin blonde eyebrows and an even thinner mouth claps cheerily for him and it’s not long before the rest of the group is clapping in unison. People move out of the way, an invitation for him to move forward in the crowd and stand up in front of the classroom.
And of course, who else does Draco get partnered with? Why Harry Potter himself, who is all grins and concealed smirks when he and Draco are 'randomly' assigned to take Thursday afternoons.
A glimpse of that old rivalry flashes in Harry’s eyes. Draco feels something stir in the pit of his stomach. God, he could make him do anything with that look.
Scorpius tugged once more, harder this time, pulling at their locked hands with increased fervor. They must look like quite the pair—a father and the miniature version of himself playing tug of war with their connected hands.
Draco reaches into his back trouser pocket, waving the papers he digs out in between his two fingers. “I’m not trying to keep Astoria away from Scorpius. However, legally, I can if I choose to.”
It’s only several more tugs until he’s coming on his office floor, panting like a bitch in heat over Harry Potter like he was sixteen again. He presses his forehead on his wooden desk, trying to calm his racing heart as the rest of his orgasm shudders through him with surprising strength. His fingers trace the spot of his hair where Potter touched as if trying to replicate the feeling. Though when he tugs at his braid, it doesn’t live up to the feeling of Potter’s thick fingers running themselves over his hair.
It feels like forever before his tears begin to taper off and his body no longer feels like it’s constricting itself. Refusing to look up, he keeps his eyes focused on his pale hands, still shaking awfully in his lap. On the scuffed hardwood beneath him. On the small puddle of his fallen tears on the hardwood. On literally anywhere but Potter’s face.
“My ten year old child says a lot of things. Doesn’t mean that they’re all true,” snarked Draco. Great, now his son was auditioning him off to entertain Potter and a bunch of children as payback for this morning. He’d rather go and handpick his cell in Azkaban than do that. It’s not his fault that he needs glasses.
“Of course I will. I mean it’s my fault that this is happening to you anyway. It’s the least I can do. Is there anything else you’ll like me to get?” He should hate it, bouncing around like Malfoy’s house elf and waiting to take orders from his master. Yet for some reason, he finds that he genuinely doesn’t mind taking care of him.
