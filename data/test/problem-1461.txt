Draco snorts. “You’re my best friend, you absolute dick head. You should be on
Harry hasn’t noticed him yet, or at least he’s pretending he hasn’t seen him yet. He takes a few more drags of his cigarette and throws it down onto the street. Draco frowns as he notices dark shadows on Harry's unusual pale face.
Harry giggles and shakes his head. “Excited, yes. But it doesn’t rob my sleep, no.”
Harry hurries up, conjures some lube onto his dick, and spreads some more around Draco’s hole.
He tries to stay quiet, but he’s not succeeding. His skin is burning, and he desperately needs to cum. Draco seems to notice how close Harry already is. Therefore, he lets go of Harry’s cock and kisses him passionately.
“Fresh wood, oak, marzipan.”
Harry grins. “I have no idea what that is.”
Malfoy chuckles. “Yes, of course, you oblivious fool. They do it all the time.”
“It's not illegal. This isn't Highschool. And it’s only weird because you make it weird. He’s cute, he’s nice and he blew you away the minute you laid your eyes on him. I say give it a try.”
“Come on, guys. It’s not that bad, is it? I mean, you’re not angry with me, are you?”
Harry presses his lips together. “Sorry. What happens if you don’t - you know.”
Without thinking, he raises his hand. He immediately gets the Professor’s attention. “Yes, Mr. Potter? Is everything alright?”
“But seriously, Potter. All we ever did was fight and shout and insult each other. Who would’ve thought that you and I could ever have a normal, civil conversation with each other?
“What did just happen? Are you okay?”
He sends an email to every department, telling them to send a round-mail to every student with the information.
Maybe it’s the soft touch, perhaps it’s Draco’s sweet voice. Maybe it’s just Draco’s presence in general. But Harry begins to calm down. He feels the adrenaline slowly wearing off and removes his hand from the guy. He takes a step back and takes a deep, shaky breath.
Harry smiles. “Thank you. I’m glad you like it, but you also did a great job at cooking.”
Harry nods again. He’s suddenly very nervous, even though he’s never nervous about sex. He’s a confident guy. He’s got nothing to worry about. But something about Draco and something about this situation make him feel incredibly nervous. They walk back to the room of requirement in silence.
Harry frowns. “I don’t really know. Sometimes, they’re so clear and vivid. And at other times, I’m just left with the feeling. I felt horrified and lost.”
Not breaking the kiss, he guides them to the bed and pushes the younger boy on top of it gently. Draco crawls over Harry and sinks down on top of him, causing them both to moan.
„I see you’re an early bird.“
“Let’s head to class then, shall we?”, Malfoy suggests with a nod towards the greenhouses.
He watches Draco jump down the bleachers and head up to the castle.
“See you.”
“It was terrible, Neville!”, Draco cries. He’s actually crying. “The entire train ride he wouldn’t look at me. He just listened to music and kept staring out of the window as if he hadn’t just confessed his love to me.”
“I was stuck in Magic History.”
Harry feels overwhelmed. God, Draco smells fantastic. Keep it cool. Don’t think about it. “Um. Yeah. I – I don’t know – I felt very stressed.”
Harry wipes a tear away and stops him. “I need more than flirting, banter and fake fancy dinner dates. So call me when you’re ready for more.”
"It's always complicated with you!", she says and rolls her eyes.
“… Right,” Draco repeats. He seems to be lost in his thoughts.
want to spend Christmas with me or are you just suggesting this because you feel sorry for me?”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
Harry catches the way Draco’s cheeks turn pink. “I thought about that too, actually.”
Harry shakes his head. “No. That doesn’t really matter that much. As long as we get along nicely, I’m good to go.”
Harry is screwed. He really is. And he’s also finally ready to talk about all of this. He’s at a point where he desperately needs his friends’ advice.
at him! And Harry’s heart rate speeds up. Fuck. He quickly grabs one of his textbooks and opens it at a random page. “What page was I supposed to read again?”
Every time he walks around campus, he searches for Harry. The campus is huge, therefore he hasn't seen him yet, but he still keeps his eyes open.
It’s passionate, it’s full of heat, it’s sexy, it’s wild, it’s everything Draco needs right now.
He watches Draco closely now and notices how pale the man suddenly seems to be. Draco only nods but it seems forced. "Yeah, I'm fine. Would you please hold my arm and keep it steady?"
”, Draco waves around. “Sitting here, having dinner with you. It’s nice.”
He sets up his laptop, opens his presentation he has prepared to inform the students and gets out the printed sheets with all the information.
Draco blushes and hides his face behind his scarf. “You're right. I am.”
Draco looks taken aback. “Really?”
When Draco finishes his work, he turns around to Harry. "I'm finished."
He slams into Draco, hard and fast. He holds on to Draco’s waist, and he’s sure there’s going to be bruises tomorrow. Draco’s hands fist the sheets, his hips meet Harry’s thrusts and he cries out desperately. “Harry, Merlin. Fuck, yes!”
Harry sighs and eventually gets up. He walks towards Draco and falls into the seat next to him. “Hey.”
“Okay. Will you kiss me right here right now?”
Draco blushes, as he tilts his head. “Just physically?”
on his looks, he’s actually very beautiful”, Dean says after considering this for a while. “His grey eyes, his blonde soft hair. He has a nice body, and a really nice arse, if I do say so myself. Yeah, he’s stunning. I actually agree with Ginny.”
Draco’s mouth falls open and he stumbles against the wall, his hands gripping the showerhead tightly. “Uuuugh. Oh my god, please don’t stop. Harry - I - Fuck, I can’t breathe - this is too much”
“Didn’t see you at breakfast nor lunch the entire week,” Draco introduces himself and puts his bag down on the table. "I thought we agreed on you eating more regularly."
Harry beams at him and surges forward.
When he finishes work that day, he immediately drives to Neville’s flat. He bangs on the door impatiently.
Harry feels a painful sting at this comment. Draco is probably right, but something inside of him doesn’t want to believe that. There’s something
Harry surges forward. He grabs Draco’s face with both his hands, presses his lips against Draco’s, and lets Draco decide whether he wants to push him away or continue. He’s not moving, his lips pressed against Draco’s and waits patiently for something, anything.
Then, he turns around and almost runs away, straight towards the terrace. Maybe he can borrow a cigarette from someone. The moment he steps outside, he feels less like throwing up. Merlin, that was a horrible idea. Why did he do that? He takes a couple of breaths and tries to calm his spinning head. He already feels a little calmer. God, he shouldn’t have drunk this much. The alcohol really hits him now and he sees everything in a blur. He wipes his mouth and actually feels sick to his stomach. He shouldn’t have kissed this Lucas guy. It was a stupid reaction. He felt so jealous and hurt seeing Draco kiss somebody else, even though he has no right to feel that way. Draco didn’t do anything wrong. Harry knows that. But still.
Neville slams his hand against the table. “Merlin. Harry, please talk to him for god’s sake. Sober. And tell him everything. And force him to be honest with you. I can’t believe how dumb both of you are.”
Harry sighs. “Um. I have a problem.”
Harry moves the finger inside of Draco, curls it and teases him with as much care as possible. Draco radiates so much heat, Harry is beginning to sweat.
Hermione frowns. “Has that anything to do with the boy you’re seeing?”
“What’s the problem then?” His voice seems gentle now.
Draco sits down in front of Harry and grabs his hands. “Potter, stop being such a little chicken. It’s not like I’m taking your virginity or anything. It’s just about sex. We both get something out of this. Okay?”
Draco avoids looking at him. “Do you regret it?””
Harry shakes his head. “I’m serious. The sex is great, that’s all. I don’t even know him that well.”
“Will you be a good boy for me Draco?”, Harry moans and bites Draco’s neck. “Moan my name, open your legs for me? Take all of me, scream for me? Tell me that you’re mine?”
Harry stares at himself in the mirror and doesn’t even notice the way Draco stares back at Harry.
Harry tilts his head in confusion. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Harry sighs. “I just really miss him, Nev. I didn’t think I would actually miss him. I didn’t even realize I was in it so deeply. I just pushed it all away, I didn’t want to think about any of it. And now it comes crashing down on me.”
“You didn’t seem like you were looking for me. You only had eyes for him!”
the one asking questions, not you.”
Draco takes a deep breath and fumbles for a while. Eventually, he goes for it and hangs the bauble right in the middle of the tree.
He ignores Ron’s knowing stare. How did Ron figure Harry out this quickly? Harry hasn’t even figured it out for himself. He's got no clue what's going on with him. He continues to stare at the dance floor, desperately trying to find Draco. Now that he knows for sure that he’s here Harry scams the entire dancefloor. But it’s too dark and the people move too fast. There’s no way he could make out anyone in this light.
“Are you seriously uncomfortable talking about this? After everything we did so far?”
“Scared of what?”
When Harry gets back to his room, he’s already worrying about the marks on his body. How is he going to explain those to his friends? He really doesn’t want to talk about it all.
Draco raises his leg, allowing Harry to hit him even deeper. They both let out a desperate cry at that.
Harry’s throat feels dry. He wants to reply, but Draco interrupts him. “Draco, I –“
Draco huffs. "Potter. I was here first. How am I supposed to follow you around, then? Maybe
The others watch Draco and Harry knowingly as if they know something Draco doesn’t. Which is probably the case, Draco thinks.
“Oh”, Draco simply answers.
“Well, how old are you?”, Draco fires back with a smirk. He leans on the desk and crosses his arms.
“Oh my god, Draco”, Harry sighs, his voice filled with fake outrage. “You’ve been missing out on so much!”
“Fantastic”, Draco mumbles and stares at the silver iPhone in his hands. “Muggles are fascinating. I had no idea they were so clever.”
"A Chai Latte for Draco!", a young woman shouts causing Harry's head to snap up and his eyes sparkle in excitement.
“Harry,” is all that comes out of Draco’s mouth. It sounds weak and broken, and Harry’s heart clenches. He never wants to hear Draco’s voice sound that vulnerable again. “God, Harry, I love you so much.”
to participate. He doesn’t have to be the strict annoying teacher who forces the students to behave.
Draco nods and smiles. “Alright. See you around.”
Draco eventually places the two plates in front of Harry. There’s eggs, bacon, avocado, and toast. Draco even conjures some coffee and orange juice, and Harry can’t help but think that this might actually be the best breakfast he’s had in a long time.
“That was awkward”, Harry mumbles as he turns around to face Ron again.
"Don't make this a big deal", Draco warns him and takes a sip of his wine to hide his blush. This whole situation is making him incredibly uncomfortable.
going to think about what this all means. Nope, not all.
“Well, that’s another good reason why I can’t leave you”, Harry says. “Let’s get you to the hospital wing.”
Harry sighs. “Yeah, sure. But I’ll stay for a while.”
Harry slowly pulls the finger out of Draco, giving him time to adjust. He remembers that Draco had told him that he hadn’t had sex in a very long time. The last thing he wants to do is hurt the man. Therefore, he gently pushes back in and moves the finger inside of Draco, curls it, and teases him with as much care as possible. He tries to read Draco’s reactions, but he doesn’t know if Draco is in pain or in pleasure, judging by the way he’s squirming and moving underneath him.
Harry lets out a desperate sob and slams a hand down onto the mattress. “Fuck!”
And then, Harry hits this particular spot inside of Draco. Draco’s head snaps up, his mouth falls open, and he looks as if he’s about to pass out.
And Harry does, he pushes into him in a steady rhythm, his orgasm slowly building up.
. Just like that. As if that means nothing.”
Dean nods. “Yup. Maybe now you can finally confess your undying love to Draco.”
Harry grins and presses another kiss to Draco’s lips. He feels all fuzzy from being so close to Draco. “Yes, that means I’m your boyfriend now.”
Harry pulls out his fingers and Draco immediately begins to shake and groans in pain.
Draco grins. He conjures a second glass with a flick of his finger. Harry tries to hide his admiration for Draco’s magic skills. He always secretly had admired Draco for that. Instead, he grabs the glass and takes a big sip.
He’s thankful that they spare him from helping much. Molly had given him a kiss on the cheek the other day. She had commented on how soft Harry’s hair feels and Harry had almost burst out into tears. Ever since then, he was left alone most of the time, his friends chatting with him occasionally and trying to distract him from the aching burn inside his chest.
“I certainly haven’t.”
They move their hands in a fast pace, both grinding into each other and biting each other’s neck, lips, ears and shoulder.
Draco chuckles. “You’re right. We really were.  Hating you was so
“Do you ever say yes?”
He collapses on top of Draco and lets his head rest on his shoulder. He’s breathing heavily. “Wow. I fucking love this.”
Draco presses his lips together, hiding his smirk. "Damn right."
He looks around. Everyone seems to be teamed up already. Neville is working with Luna, Dean is working with Seamus. He sighs. Merlin. He hates teamwork.
Draco seems taken aback. Then, he shouts. “You flirted with that guy first. You didn’t even care that I was waving at you!”
"Harry", Draco moans, but then, suddenly, Harry pulls away and wipes at his mouth.
Harry smiles. “Thanks. Anyway.”
“Saturday, we’ll visit the National Gallery, take a walk through Hyde Park, and visit Big Ben. In the evening, we’ll go to the London Eye and at 9 pm, we’ll take the train back to London. Any questions?”
He enjoys the sex, the kissing, the cuddling. He even enjoys falling asleep next to Draco. If it’s all just the Armortentia, it feels crazy real.
The moment he wakes up, he feels throbbing pain his head. Harry opens his eyes, slowly gets used to the light and his surroundings. There’s a body lying on top of him, it’s incredibly warm under the blankets, and he’s sweaty and gross.
Harry tenses, then he nods and gets up. He turns around before walking out of the room.
Harry shrugs. “Wherever you want. It’s our tree. There are no rules.”
„And what’s so crazy about a guy that’s like 6 years younger than you? I’ve dated people who were 10 years younger and it never was a problem.“
kissed Draco. He’s a freaking Gryffindor, after all. He’s all about bravery! Why does he feel like such a coward around Draco?
Draco tilts his head and watches him through unreadable, sad grey eyes. Harry’s heart begins to flutter. Then, Draco finally answers “Yeah, you can always pretend.”
Harry lets out a moan himself. Merlin, this is getting too much.
Harry begins to explain the phone to Draco. He shows him how to send a text message, how to make a phone call, how to take photos, and how to download apps.
“I need to be penetrated in order to fully turn”, Draco explains as he takes off his shoes and fumbles with his trousers. “That’s why you can’t help me. I’m pretty much stuck in this heat until I have a cock shoved up my arse.”
“I admire you and your passion for history”, Harry says softly. Draco doesn’t dare to look at him. “I wish I was as passionate for something as you are.”
Harry takes a deep breath, but the words come out so easily, Harry almost forgets about the Veritaserum. “I fell in love with you months ago, Draco.”
“Harry, are you even listening? I said we’re going inside now!”, Ron shouts and grabs Harry’s arm. Harry shakes his head in confusion and follows Ron.
When he reaches for Harry's dick through his boxers, the boy lets out a silent scream.
Harry looks at him. Draco lays on the couch, shoes plopped up on the table in front of him. He seems very relaxed, which is a rare occasion. Draco looks handso - Harry stops himself from finishing that thought.
actually admit to it. He's also a little scared to be with him. His job is too important for him, he can’t risk it.
talk to anyone again.
Draco doesn’t finish his sentence. Instead, he turns away from Harry.
He scribbles something on a paper lying around the desk and gives it to Draco.
His right-hand moves lower and he eventually grabs Harry’s dick. He begins to stroke him slowly, making Harry’s jaw go slack and his mouth drop open. Little grunts are coming out of his throat, and Harry already sees stars at the sensation, and he doesn’t know how long he will last this time.
"You sure?"
Harry smiles. “Since the first day?”
Harry stares at the guy who is shivering and squeaking in panic below him. Harry did defeat Voldemort after all. The guy better be scared of him.
“Do you have a problem with me being bisexual?”
After what feels like an eternity, the other man sighs. “Ok. I’m finished.”
“What the hell? Draco, you've got to chill”, Neville says once he opens the door. “What’s up? You look like shit.”
Draco grins. Then, he finally decides to end Harry's suffering and licks Harry's entry.
When Harry tells Hermione, Ron, and Neville about their deal later that night, they don’t seem convinced.
Draco nods and grabs a blanket. “Okay, I’m ready.”
fancy dinner dates. I need to talk to you every single day. I need to kiss you.”
Harry presses another kiss onto Draco’s neck and then carefully slides in all the way. He swears, he sees stars at the sensation of being inside Draco’s tight arse.
He walks over to the sofa and sits down on one of them, then he closes his eyes.
Harry joins him. He feels so light and carefree and happy. He never wants this feeling to stop. “I’m so happy.”
Harry presses another kiss onto Draco’s neck, and then, without any warning, he pushes in all the way. He swears he sees stars at the sensation of being inside Draco’s tight arse. It has never felt so fucking good. He’s close to passing out, just from being inside Draco. He can’t concentrate on anything else.
Draco grins and then goes even lower making Harry shiver. The boy lets out delicious moans and Draco can feel his own cock hardening more and more.
A huge smile spreads on Harry's face.
Harry opens the door and helps Draco inside. Draco seems to get worse every passing minute.
“So, do you like it?”, Harry points with his chin in the direction of the book.
Harry licks his lips and pulls Draco’s cheeks apart. He strokes Draco’s hole with his finger, teasing his entrance with it. Then, he leans lower and begins to lick Draco’s thigh. He wants to drive Draco mad. He wants him to beg for it. Draco is already panting heavily, but Harry wants more. He wants to hear him cry. That’s why he licks over Draco’s hole once. Just once.
Harry runs a hand through his wet hair and nods. “Yeah. I just took a shower.”
Draco frowns. He blinks a couple of times. “Right.”
Draco shrugs. Then, he smiles. “Yeah, I guess. But I do miss fighting with you sometimes. It was so damn easy to rile you up. It was entertaining.”
“Malfoy! You scared the shit out of me”, Harry gasps. “What on earth are you doing here?”
Harry listens to Draco attentively.
“What’s so wrong with it?”, Neville asks him with a grin and takes a sip from his glass of wine.
Harry watches him amused and sets up the DVD. Then, he sits back down next to Draco and begins the movie.
But now that he isn’t officially allowed to reach out and touch Draco whenever they spend time together, Harry painfully notices how often he feels the desire to kiss him, hug him, hold his hand, stroke his hair, or caress his arms.
When Harry wraps his hand around both Draco’s and Harry’s cock, Draco sees stars.
Draco grins. “Yeah, I do. But I’m brilliant at Potions, so I’ll help you with it.”
Harry apparates them to the location of the little house. They land a few feet away from the house and Harry immediately hears the swooshing of the ocean and breathes in the clear air.
Harry stares at him in shock. “I can’t believe this.”
Then, Draco steps inside and hums at the warmth and cosiness of the water. "Come here."
“Um”, Draco begins. “Would you like to go for a walk?”
Harry turns around and walks straight up to Lucas, who is standing next to his friends only a couple of tables away. If Draco can make out with somebody else, so can Harry. He stops right in front of Lucas, who smiles down at him in surprise.
“Draco?”, Harry asks concerned. “Fuck, are you okay?”
“Would you -”, Draco begins. Then, he cuts himself off. “Nah. I’ll just head over to my own room.”
Draco shrugs and runs a hand through his hair. "It doesn't really matter."
“Shit”, Draco whispers. Within minutes, it starts pouring.
Harry’s throat goes dry. Oh. That’s - Merlin.
Harry follows Ron’s eyes and his stomach drops the moment he sees Draco. He knows it’s him. The silver hair and the long, petite body give him away. Also, the way Draco holds somebody else’s waist and snogs this handsome man seems too familiar. That's how Draco used to snog him.
Draco feels like suffocating. He tries to focus on his book but he can feel Harry so strongly next to him. They're not touching, but they might as well be.
Neville raises an eyebrow at Draco. "You act like a drama queen."
“I don’t really understand you two”, Ron sighs. “You fuck for months, then you stop talking all of a sudden. And now you want to be just friends? Why don’t you fucking confess your feelings and finally get into a relationship?!”
Draco licks his lips and blushes. "I might have."
* * *
Draco obeys him, grabs his waist and pulls him even closer. Harry begins to undress Draco. He helps him out of his sweater and throws it to the ground, unbuckles his belt and pushes Draco's jeans down. Then, he undresses quickly, leaving them both in their boxer shorts.
Harry furrows his brows in confusion.
But it doesn’t come. Draco sits back down. He cuddles under the blanket and crawls closer to Harry.
Then, it all happens quickly. Draco moves forward, grabs Harry’s face with both his hands and presses his lips on top of his. Harry gasps for air. He feels taken back by Draco’s sudden action.
“Rollover”, Harry orders, and Draco complies immediately. Harry slaps his arse cheek, then he nudges Draco’s legs apart, waiting for Draco to adjust before positioning himself.
Harry sighs. “But that's the problem. I don’t want to get with just anyone. The people here either go crazy for me, which scares the shit out of me. Or they faint the moment I talk to them. Trust me, these are bad conditions for a hookup.”
Harry considers this for a moment. But then he agrees. He might never actually meet up with him, but accepting his number sounds fair enough.
“To be honest, I think Blaise Zabini is really hot”, Ron eventually blurts out. When the others look at him confused, he clears his throat. “I mean, come on. He looks insanely handsome.”
“Hm?” Harry hums, looking up.
“Harry”, Draco shouts and arches his back. “Fuck- I - oh Merlin - do that again - don’t stop - please - I need -“
“Harry,” he sighs, pressing back as Harry sets up a painfully slow rhythm, letting Draco feel the length of his fingers as he pushes it in and out. It must hurt Draco, it must burn, but still, Draco begs for more. “Please,” he gasps, “Harry, more.”
Even though Draco and Harry aren’t enemies anymore, they’ve left all of their rivalry with the war, they aren’t exactly friends either. A nod here and there, a quiet “hello” when they walk past each other, a “could you hand me the book, please” once in a while, staring at each other when the other isn’t looking and that’s about it.
“Okay, I’m done for today”, Harry sighs. “Can we please do something fun now?”
. Very nice. Harry ignores the churning feeling inside his tummy. “Just like that?”
“Who would’ve thought that you of all people would fuck me senseless?”
Neville sighs. “Draco, will you shut up for a moment, you drama queen?”
* * *
Draco presses his lips together and decides he has to say something. “Harry.”
Harry’s brain logs off. Any chance of thinking clearly is now over. His dick reacts to Draco’s body. He feels hot all over. His hands find Draco’s stomach, and he pulls his shirt up to touch Draco’s incredibly soft skin.
“Ah, shit. I promised to wait until you were ready to tell us the whole story.”
Hermione sighs. “What?”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
His eyes are filled with something that Draco can’t quite read. “Even though you're not on the same page as me: Thanks for last night. It meant a lot to me.”
They finally reach the greenhouses. Draco licks his lips and straightens his shoulders. Harry can tell that he feels uneasy. He wishes he could somehow make it easier for Malfoy, tell him that he doesn’t have to feel weird around Harry. But the thing is, Harry also feels weird and uneasy around Malfoy. So, what kind of Hypocrite would he be?
Neville nods. “Yeah. We figured that out too. You both seemed to be very delusional with each other. I mean, the fact that you still think that Draco doesn’t like you back is insane to me. That boy would literally marry you on the spot if you asked him.”
Harry nods. “Yeah. I went grocery shopping before we left.”
He jumps out of his skin feeling absolutely terrified.
Harry shakes his head. “I can’t. I’m sorry.”
Harry frowns. “
“I won’t”, Harry reassures him. “I won’t. Promise.”
“Confessing my love to you, for fuck's sake!”, Draco shouts.
“I swear!”
“A what?”, Draco asks again.
“Hey!”, Harry pouts. “I am a professional athlete.”
But when Draco suddenly steps inside the library where Harry is currently trying to do homework and sits down next to him, Harry is genuinely surprised.
He then begins to massage Malfoy’s shoulders gently, rubbing them and squeezing them. He doesn’t know if this is a good idea, judging by the obscene moans coming from Draco.
Harry shrugs. “Yeah, sure. Why not? But isn’t this the room of requirement? Can’t we just wish for Armortentia and drink the one that the room gives us?”
“Mhm. Didn’t really work, since you ran into me, huh?”
“Stay here”, Draco suggests before his thoughts can stop him. “You might sleep better.”
And after hooking up at that club, Harry can’t help but think: What if? What if Draco feels the same way? What if Harry and Draco actually have a chance? What if this isn’t just sex and love potions and no strings attached?
Draco is confused.
Harry licks his lips. “I want to try it!”
Harry presses his lips together and shuts his mouth. For a while, neither is saying a word.
“They do not light up!”
. You’re uptight.”
“Are you insane? Isn’t that illegal?!”, Harry shouts into Dean’s ear.
Draco walks up to the door. Harry doesn’t want him to leave just yet. “Is everything cool between us?”
Draco stares at his glass and sighs. “I like guys with dark messy hair, smaller than me. I like green eyes and a muscular body.”
Draco feels partly disappointed and partly relieved when his navigation system tells him they’ve arrived.
„Is this seat taken?“
Of course, permission and financial support are granted a week later. Draco is good at what he does and he has planned this trip in very beautiful detail. He hopes enough students will apply.
Harry tilts his head. Now that he looks at Draco from up close, he does realize that he seems tired and more pale than usual. There are dark shadows under his eyes. He wants to ask why, but Draco cuts him off. “Do you like it? Breakfast?”
Draco eventually gives in and agrees. They head upstairs together and enter the bathroom. Draco gets out two little bottles with a green liquid inside.
And then, finally, Draco pushes in with one smooth movement. Harry sees stars, his head spins, and the air gets stuck in his lungs. His mouth falls open, and he sinks against Draco’s chest. Draco holds him up with his strong arms and gently begins to move. He’s sweet and careful, and he gives Harry enough time to adjust to his movements.
“Harry.” He takes his hand and shakes it. This feels awkward. Especially with Ron standing next to them.
Neville frowns. “Okay…”
“Hope next time we see each other you and Harry are finally boyfriends!”, Ron shouts after Draco, who rushes towards his car.
"Yes, you can", Draco mutters, grabbing Harry's arse for support.
On rare occasions, Draco gets lunch in the cafeteria. He hates the unhealthy, fatty food there, but sometimes he forgets to bring lunch so he has no choice.
Draco only shrugs. “I have an exquisite taste.”
Harry feels a shot of disappointment. But he nods. “Yeah. I guess you’re right. Besides, we don’t really need it anymore, anyway.”
Draco’s answer, again, shoots out immediately. “Yes.”
“I can’t concentrate when you are watching me,” Draco mumbles as he measures something Harry doesn’t recognize.
Draco runs to his car in a desperate attempt to save his coat and rushes inside, turning on the heater.
Harry seems to follow Draco. Sometimes he “accidentally” touches Draco’s arm, then he “accidentally” stumbles so that he almost crashes into Draco. One time, his
This feels so much more intimate than Harry has ever felt with anyone. He wants to do this forever, wants to feel Draco, wants to kiss him, to take care of him, touch him and make him feel good.
Then, he turns around and rushes out of the tent.
“Why’s that?”
Draco tilts his head, his eyes are softer than before.
“Well,
Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s torso. “Yes, you are. Now shut up, relax, and go back to sleep.”
He locks himself up and focuses on his work. He needs to prepare a few lectures, read through some essays and answer tons of emails. Trying desperately to distract himself and also trying to get rid of the images of Harry cuddling with another man, he throws himself into his work.
Draco chuckles. “I liked this. You know. It was different.”
“Okay. I’m done.”
“So, does that mean …?”
Then, his face goes blank and he suddenly gets very pale. "Oh shit. I'm not supposed to call you Draco. I'm so sorry."
And on top of that, Harry is so, so horny. And being in Hogwarts, he doesn’t have many possibilities. This isn’t London, where he could go to the pub and try to pull a muggle. Someone who has no idea who he is. In Hogwarts, everyone knows who he is, and during school term, all he has left is his own hand and his imagination since he’s tied to the castle. His options are limited, and it’s driving him mad.
A few students raise their arm and Draco answers all of the questions in detail.
Harry shakes his head. "No, Sir. No. Sorry."
The world stops, Draco’s heart stops beating, his eyes shoot open and his mouth feels dry.
Neville tilts his head. “Well, that doesn’t sound like ‘not knowing each other well’. It seems as if you guys spent a lot of time with each other.”
“Right”, Harry says and shakes his head as if waking out of a trance. He tells him the address and Draco starts to drive.
When the lesson is over, everyone jumps up, grabs their bags, and rushes out of the classroom. But Harry and Draco both linger on.
He opens the piece of paper and notices neat handwriting. He begins to read.
After taking another deep breath, Draco suddenly smells smoke and turns his head in surprise.
“I haven’t gotten laid in ages, man. How would I find someone here in Hogwarts anyway? You’ve seen the way people act around me. It’s insane.”
Luna helps Harry style his hair. She slicks it back and holds it in place with a charm that Harry doesn’t even recognize.
Harry’s chest tightens. He wants to hold onto him and never let go. But then, Draco straightens his back, turns around, and leaves the bathroom.
friends, and we’ve spent the past hundred Christmas Eves together”, Harry argues.
Maybe it's meant to be, him and Harry. Everything that has happened so far seems like destiny. Draco doesn't believe in coincidences anyway.
Harry nods and simply watches Draco undress in trance. God, that man is beautiful. And Draco said he hasn’t transformed into a Veela yet. How gorgeous must Draco be once he’s fully transitioned?
“Thanks”, Draco whispers.
“No, sorry. I’m busy tonight.”
Harry nods. He wraps his arms around Draco and manages to calm down a little. If Draco is okay with this, he could be okay with it too. They stay like this for a while. Harry loses a sense of time. After what feels like hours, Draco finally speaks up.
Draco raises his eyebrows and watches Harry make himself comfortable on the grey couch. He gets out his laptop and some papers.
And he definitely needs to clean his apartment. Hands shoved deeply into the pockets of his blue coat and cheeks hidden behind his Burberry scarf, he walks to the closest Starbucks and gets himself a Chai Latte. He waits paitently in line and already searches his pockets for his money when he feels an unexpected, sudden tap on his shoulder.
Draco sighs and rubs his eyes. "I guess it is."
“It’s going to change everything between us. It’s going to be fucking weird afterward.”
Harry frowns and watches Draco's hands. They're actually shaking. "You never tremble. You're the calmest person I know. Are you okay?"
Draco chuckles. “You look so cute, Potter.”
Then, Harry surges forward and presses his lips on top of the other man’s lips. Lucas gasps in surprise but seems to recover quickly. He grabs Harry’s face with both his hands and begins to kiss him passionately.
Draco hisses in pain but throws his head back shortly after. “God, that feels better. Eases the pain.”
For a few moments, Harry doesn’t feel anything. Wasn’t there supposed to be rainbows and butterflies? But the moment he puts the bottle down, it’s almost as if a warm blanket is thrown over him. He smells fresh wood, vanilla, and hot chocolate. The room turns warm and cozy; he feels relaxed and light. His muscles don’t hurt anymore. His stomach feels fluttery, and his heart beats in a calm, steady rhythm. The world feels safe and calm.
“Do I have to spell it out for you?”
Harry finishes the second drink within minutes. “I can’t stand being in the same room as Draco whilst being sober. Getting drunk will help me get through this.”
Draco and Harry rush outside, hands intertwined. They find their group of friends and step closer.
Malfoy watches Harry through unreadable, impossibly grey eyes, but he looks friendly. His face looks softer than Harry remembers, almost younger. “Were you running away from something, Potter?”
Harry ignores the churning feeling inside his stomach and doesn’t want to define what that means.
Draco runs a hand through his wet hair. “I couldn’t think straight. I have never missed anyone in my life as much as I have missed you. I need you, Harry. I need your smile, and your eyes, and your smell, and your body wrapped closely around mine. I need
Harry grins, then he pushes two fingers in. Draco cries out “
Harry holds his breath and waits for Neville to continue. The other boy sighs.
Draco presses his lips together and shakes his head.
A huge, genuine, happy smile stretches across Harry’s face. He feels dizzy and lightheaded, he wants to kiss Malfoy and dance, and sing, and hug the world.
Harry nods. "Yeah, sorry. Can I help you with something?"
“Yes, you are. You’re squirming, you get all blushy and awkward, you avoid my question. You’re uptight. That actually doesn’t surprise me at all. I bet you’re the flowers and hearts kind of guy.”
Harry stares at Draco in disbelief. He can’t just talk to Draco about Sex!
Harry smiles. “And are you happy?”
Harry looks at him in confusion, his eyebrows raised. “Am I?”
“Alright, mum, I’ll be home in about 40 minutes, I have to go grocery shopping first”, Draco speaks into his phone, whilst finishing his cup of tea.
“Wasn’t interested in him at all,” Harry replies.
Harry feels a shot of disappointment run through his body. He shouldn’t be feeling this way and he quickly tries to push down those feelings. He grabs Draco’s shoulders and squeezes him. “I will miss you.”
"I was wondering if I could study here. I like your office, it has a really nice atmosphere. I promise I'll be quiet."
He quickly sits down in the bathtub, hides his body with his arms, and grabs the showerhead. He turns it on and waits for the water to warm up, while Draco sits down on the floor.
Draco nods. “Yeah. I know. Don’t worry about it. That guy was pathetic.”
Once they’re all back at Hogwarts, things are different. Harry doesn’t know why things have changed, but it’s weird now. Draco and Harry don’t meet up on Friday nights anymore. They actually stop talking completely and Harry has no idea why.
Luna squeezes his hands. “If it makes you feel better, they forced a shot of Veritaserum down Draco’s throat too.”
“Oh God,” Draco sighs into Harry’s mouth. “Bed, Bed, Bed! Now.”
Harry also takes a slice and begins to eat.
Draco lowers his head and begins to suck Harry’s sensitive skin. Harry’s moaning loudly at this point.
A few more pushes. Harry can feel it. He’s already so freaking close. And when Draco moves his arm around Harry’s slim body and squeezes Harry’s ass, cups him, and holds his arse cheek tightly, Harry sees stars.
“Yeah. You know. Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini,
Harry gets up and returns the smile. "I agree."
“You did?”, Harry asks softly and runs his hand through Draco’s soft hair. In the dark light of the room, his hair almost seems silver.
“Only because you were flirting with him! And I was right, three minutes later you walked up to him and kissed him!”
“How old are you?”
Draco does as he's being told. He begins to thrust into Harry, keeping himself steady with a tight grip on Harry's waist. The other wraps around Harry's neck,
Then, everyone starts to count from ten.
Then, Draco waits for Harry to hug them all and waves at the group awkwardly. "Hi, I'm Draco. Nice to meet you."
Draco begins to dry Harry’s hair with his wand. He brushes through Harry’s jungle of hair and tries to tame it.
“Who’s uptight now, huh? Look at how the tables have turned!”
“No, that’s not what I meant. I simply don’t enjoy other people’s company that much. I like being on my own. I always had to be, you know? But I do enjoy your company. A lot, actually.”
Draco follows Harry into the living room. “I’ve never done that before.”
He isn’t brave enough to ask him though. Something about Draco makes him lose his confidence. November passes so quickly, Harry doesn’t even know if the four weeks really happened in the first place. They’re all so busy studying, they don’t have one spare second for themselves. All Harry does is study, eat, train Quidditch, and sleep.
“Harry!”, Draco screams, fully sobbing now. “Please don’t do this to me. I need you inside me right now, please, fill me up, it hurts so much!”
“I wasn’t flirting with – Merlin. I told Draco I wasn’t flirting with that guy.”
“Promise?”
“Us. Where we’re standing. I mean, we obviously don’t need a love potion to fuck anymore. That incident at the club proofed it. And I don’t really know what that means.”
Ron nods. “Damn right.”
“I think this is actually working! Look at this! Your hair seems so much softer and neater!”
Draco turns around and watches Harry with an unreadable expression.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Fuck,” Harry sighs. He won’t be able to resist any longer. He wants to touch this man so badly; his fingers are itching. His skin is burning.
“I knew that this would happen. I knew right from the very start that I could never keep it casual between us. I found you so attractive and fascinating. I had the opportunity to get to know you and I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t resist. I should’ve been honest with you. That wasn’t fair. I pretended I didn’t fancy you because I was trying to play it cool. I agreed on all these things, despite knowing that it never would’ve worked outright.”
Harry frowns. Draco Malfoy, attractive? Harry has never really thought about that. Why would he? He had focused too much on absolutely hating his guts. And then, once the war was over, after they’d been through so much, after they’d grown out of their constant fighting and mutually agreed on behaving like adults for once, he had worried about things being weird between them once they would return to Hogwarts. Harry still doesn’t know how to face his former enemy. But Dean’s words make him think. Harry was always intrigued by his eyes. Draco does have beautiful eyes. And his hair is extremely fluffy, the softest hair he’s probably ever seen. Harry wonders if it actually feels as soft as it looks like. Draco is tall and slim, but Dean is right, he does have a nice ass. Harry’s just a man, and the boys have competed in Quidditch too often for Harry to not check out Malfoy’s bum in Quidditch attire.
Draco chuckles. “How do you manage to look like that then?”
Draco breaks the moment by helping him out of the bathtub, still holding on to him. “Alright?”
the one following
Draco nods eagerly and prances closer to the bed. His light blue silk pajamas make him look elegant and put together, they balance out the mess of his hair. It’s so wild, it could almost be considered curly.
They stare at each other for a moment, until they both surge forward and press their lips onto each other. It’s sweet, it’s passionate and it’s nothing like the rushed heat between them just moments ago. This is calm, collected, meaningful, intense.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco nods. “Yeah, we could try.”
What would his coworkers think? What would his students think? He’d have the image of a nerdy professor who uses his status of power to bang his students. Draco groans and gets up. He can’t lay still in his bed any longer.
Harry turns around. “Draco, what is your favorite cake?”
Draco presses his lips together and rests against the door. He sighs. “I can’t stay here.”
“What is that?”
Neville frowns. “Not really, though. He visits one of your thousand lectures.”
“I’ve been hard for the past thirty minutes”, Harry admits. “I’ve thought it through, believe me.”
Harry nods.
“What exactly are you reading?”, Harry asks. He can read the title himself, but he wants to talk to Draco.
Harry’s head snaps up. “Both of you?”
After half an hour, Draco slowly seems to wake up. He rubs his nose, turns around on his back, and stretches his legs and arms with an “Uurrghh” sound.
They bought their tickets and got on the train, just like he told them to. He’s glad to be a university professor. Students are old enough to look after themselves and actually
Harry orders a firewhiskey, swallows up the liquid in one go, and orders another one.
He grabs both of Harry's cheeks and massages them roughly, giving them a good squeeze.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“I smuggled fire whiskey inside the castle.”
Draco opens his mouth in disbelief and desperately wants to argue that there isn’t anything that could be “discussed” but Harry raises his glass of wine and smiles at
He wants Draco, and he realizes he’s utterly fucked. Because now he could once again destroy everything between them. It was his idea to brew Armortentia and shag. That already messed things up between them. It was also his idea to kiss Draco in a club whilst being completely drunk. It was also his idea to stop shagging and just be friends. He really couldn’t bring in another idea into this, now that it actually works just fine between them. He can’t confess his feelings and suggest trying out a relationship now.
Draco stares at Harry in disbelief for a second, then he bursts out into a genuine fit of laughter. He throws his head back, his mouth is wide open and his eyes sparkle in amusement as he lets out the most beautiful laugh Harry’s ever heard. He notices that he never actually heard Draco laugh like this before.
Harry agrees happily. He sighs in relief. “Yeah. I’m good with that.”
Harry listens to him. He can’t believe he’s actually opening up like this. Draco never talks about his feelings. Even Blaise and Pansy have mentioned that to Harry a few times before. Over time, they had all started hanging out more.
He almost wants to pull away, his heart beating painfully fast. But then, Draco sighs into the kiss, his muscles relax, and he starts to move his lips against Harry’s. Harry sighs, his mind dazed with pleasure and pure happiness. His body is on fire in the best way possible, because Draco is actually kissing him back! Merlin, this can’t be true, right? Harry must be dreaming. But then, Draco slides his arms around Harry’s back and presses him up against the wall. He’s kissing him back, leaving Harry breathless and thrilled by how good this all feels. It's the best kiss they've shared so far. They're both sober, both needy, both desperate.
“Without any magic?”
"Okay?", Draco asks, keeping still. He needs to move, now, but he doesn't want to hurt Harry.
"Fuck, this feels so good", Harry moans. "Don't be gentle, I can take it."
“Show him you’re serious about this. Show him you’re ready for more. Show him you love him. Don’t just call him, that’s too simple.”
Harry swallows and takes a deep breath. His head is spinning. For some strange reason, he feels his eyes prickle with tears. “I hated kissing him.”
The boy nods. “Right. I’m Harry”, he stretches out his hand for Draco to shake. “Harry Potter.”
"What time is it?", Draco asks and checks his phone. "Ah, shit, we have an hour until we need to leave."
Harry grins. Then, he starts to push into Draco. He’s rough and quick. He doesn’t try to be gentle, just like Malfoy had told him to. His fingers sink into Draco’s hips. There will probably be bruises tomorrow. He slams into him harder, quicker. It’s making him sweat, but it’s so fucking good. He can’t think of anything else but Draco.
"For the bruises. Got a little carried away", Draco looks down and avoids Harry's firm stare.
Harry gets up from under the table again and frowns at the piece of paper in his hand.
Draco beams like a ball of light and Harry has to look away. His heart aches and he starts to wonder whether Ron was actually right. Maybe they are like two cars destined to crash into one another. Maybe this whole thing will blow up in their faces. Harry’s throat feels dry and he needs some orange juice to swallow the toast.
Draco smiles gently and nods.
He sighs as he walks up to them. “Guess you’ll have to stick with me.”
“Oh Merlin, Harry, I won’t last much longer! You feel
Harry hums in pleasure.
Malfoy shrugs. “I could ask you the same thing. I was here first.”
He certainly doesn’t feel like the upper hand. Especially not, when Harry is wearing a black jumper that slightly goes up when he stretches and shows the softest skin on his stomach.
“Of ruining everything between us.” Merlin. Freaking Veritaserum.
Draco puts his hands on Harry's waist and pushes himself up, grabbing him tightly and slamming into the boy. Judging by Harry's moans, he's not being too rough with the younger boy.
“Will you be my boyfriend, Draco?”
"Hey", Harry smiles "um - can I come in?"
Harry feels nauseous. Being close to Draco doesn’t make him feel better. It’s quite the opposite. Fuck, he looks
Harry clears his throat. “I don’t know. I guess, the bed is too big for me. Why are you up?”
Draco sighs. “Then close your eyes and focus on my breathing.”
Harry blushes and turns away. He also decides to get up and jumps out of bed. He grabs his clothes and starts to get dressed too.
“Because it was freaking obvious. You started eating more. And you started laughing more. Harry, you started to care more! Also, you became all bubbly and excited. I think he’s perfect for you.”
“Oh god”, Draco sighs. “My hair looks ridiculous.”
Harry can’t believe this. Did Draco actually get him breakfast? His heart swells, and his chest flutters. That is very, very sweet.
He feels like screaming and kicking everything around him. How can one guy have this effect on him? Draco seems to be in a constant state of blushing and being aroused. Thank god, the other students are too engaged in the tour guide to notice Draco’s state of despair.
Harry shakes his head. “Not really.”
“The people adore you, Harry. All you have to do is choose. I literally don’t have anyone to choose from.”
Therefore, he decides that he’s going to let loose. If the boy is approaching him again, Draco will talk to him. He will have a casual conversation with him and then he can go on with his life.
He smiles at some recognisable faces, some of his students who have written essays in his courses.
When Harry puts his lips on Draco's chest and begins biting it, Draco sees stars. He can't focus on anything else but Harry's hands, Harry's lips, Harry's cologne. Harry.
Draco sighs. “You’re only saying this because the Armortentia is clouding your brain.”
Harry raises his eyebrows in surprise. Why is Draco being so kind to him?
He’s now sweating furiously and looks as if he’s about to pass out. Harry watches the room desperate for help but is surprised when he finds a cosy room with a nice bed in the middle and a huge shower on the left.
Draco answers immediately. “Because I was scared.” His eyes shoot open in horror. “Merlin, what the hell? Why am I telling you this?”
New Year’s Eve is only two days away and Harry would much rather spend it all by himself in his bed, but his family doesn’t allow him to do that.
"Does this feel wrong, Draco?"
“Potter,” he moans. “I swear to god, I will kill you if you don’t do something.”
Harry bites his lip and Draco’s heart stops beating. “Well. I’m hungry. I’d like to come with you.”
"I'm sorry, honey, but I just had to tell him this!", Neville explains and winks at Harry with a knowing smirk.
Draco remembers Harry's lips on his neck and his hands on his body. Just the thought of it could make him cum on the spot. Draco fights against these images and tries to empty his mind. This is
Draco grins. "Yeah, I'm glad we could figure it out."
The boy smiles and runs a hand through his crazy messy hair. Then, he turns around. Happily, he jumps up the stairs and out of the lecture hall.
Draco doesn’t arrange a whole trip for Harry.
Harry smiles. “I’ll take that as a yes. Did you have anything in mind or can I take you somewhere?”
Harry grins. He clearly doesn’t think, when he reaches out to touch Draco’s hair and runs his fingers through his locks. “I can’t believe how soft your hair feels despite looking like a bird's nest right now.”
They've been dating for two weeks when Harry suggests a nice get together with all of their friends.
Harry’s head snaps up. Draco Malfoy is a Veela? How did he not know that? Why does it even matter? Why does it change anything? Why is that confession doing things to his cock?
The bloke doesn’t need to be told twice. He rushes out of the bathroom with shaky knees and slams the door shut.
Neville tilts his head. “Sounds like a nice plan, Harry. I’m not sure it’ll work, but yeah.”
“Are you okay?” Draco asks. His voice is quiet and concerned. Harry doesn’t understand when exactly they’ve started to act like this around each other. This soft and caring and understanding.
“You being a cock block? My whole life is cockblocking me right now.”
So, Harry does. He listens carefully to Draco, breathing in and out and tries to match his rhythm. At first, he feels himself getting lightheaded. But then, he’s slowly starting to relax.
Draco smiles. “Thanks. Hermione, is it?”
“Wow,” Draco says between fits of giggles. “I feel so dirty. I can’t believe we did this at a dirty toilet in a club. That isn’t my style at all.”
For some reason, Harry can’t stop thinking about the fact that Malfoy is gay. He wishes he could talk to someone about those bound breaking news, but he doesn’t know if Draco is outed already. That’s why he keeps this information to himself.
“Draco, I’m telling you. I didn’t care about him. I was looking for you. Fuck, the only reason why I’m here is the fact that Ron told me you would be here. Otherwise, I would’ve stayed at home.”
“I know how you feel. I’ve experienced some bullying myself. It’s awful.”
Harry clears his throat and takes a deep breath. Fuck it. “Yes. I do.”
Suddenly, the door opens again, and a bloke his age enters the bathroom. He’s tall, has bright blue eyes, and wears a chic black hoodie. Ginny would probably find him attractive, Harry guesses. Many people would probably find him attractive, but he's not really interested right now. He's tired and wants go be left alone.
“I didn’t know what to say, Neville! He completely caught me off guard.”
“Harry”, he screams as he comes inside him, his fingers rubbing Harry's delicate skin, making up for the roughness from before. He feels dizzy and breathless and
Harry barks out a laugh. “Matter of fact, I do know. I was able to have a sip of one of your potions once or twice.”
Neville raises his eyebrows. „I think you need to relax. How old is he?“
He gives Lucas his phone and lets him type in his number. Then, Lucas surges forward and presses a kiss to Harry’s cheek. Harry’s eyes open in surprise. They exchange one last smile and say goodbye. Easy enough.
“Ahhhh”, Draco moans. “Harry, please do something! Anything!”
“It’s cute how your eyes light up when you talk about scary things like Hilter and the concentration camps.”
Everything went well so far. All the students showed up half an hour early, just like he told them to.
. We both know that we’ll never be just friends. Never were, never will be.”
“Bullshit”, Neville laughs when Draco tells him so.
After the students have been chosen, he feels a heavy weight being lifted off his chest. Draco couldn’t be happier. He sends an email to all the students who managed to get a spot to meet him on Wednesday at four o’clock in one of the lecture halls.
“I fancy you, too”, Harry admits. Because fuck, he does. “In case that isn’t obvious by now.”
Suddenly, Ron nudges his side. “Harry. We’re supposed to partner up. Hermione and I already decided to work together.”
He beams at Draco. “Say that again.”
“I’m Lucas, by the way.” The stranger holds out his hand.
Harry looks at him confused. “But I did. You were in so much pain and I took advantage of that. I shouldn’t have, but I just couldn’t - you know - um. Control me around you anymore? You know - ah fuck. I’m not made of steel and I couldn’t help it. It’s not my fault you’re bloody attractive.”
“Please, I need so much more, need to feel you inside me!”, Draco groans.
he so desperately wants to know that.
It becomes a habit, this thing between the two boys. Every Friday night, they meet up at the Room of Requirement. Draco always comes prepared with two bottles of Armortentia, which makes Harry feel nervous and excited every single time. For some reason, he can’t get used to being around Draco. Something about this new level of their relationship makes him nervous but in the right way. In a good way. He doesn’t think about it. He
Harry swallows but nods nevertheless.
Harry keeps Draco's hand steady and helps him put the powder into the Cauldron. When it's done, Harry steps away from Draco and tries to cool down a bit. Is it just him or did the temperature rise in the last few minutes?
that?!”, he shouts over the music. “After everything that’s happened!”
Draco removes his mouth and grabs the oil next to him. He puts some into his hands and rubs them warming them up.
. But Draco doesn’t say that, god.
Harry frowns. "Your boyfriend."
Draco’s back arches, and his fingers turn white as he grabs the sheets. “Oh, god. Yes. That’s what I’m talking about.”
“And you aren’t seeing anyone? Anyone, I could owl?”, Harry tries.
“I’m no expert, mate. But I think you should talk to him. Be honest for once. Tell him how you feel.”, Ron eventually says.
Harry can’t hold himself back any longer. He slams into Draco with full force, grabs his skin tightly, and he’s sure there’s going to be bruises tomorrow. “Draco! Fuck.”
Draco can feel himself getting more and more aroused each passing second.
“Everything’s different now, you know?”, Harry begins. He doesn’t know how to explain it.
“I-“, Harry begins but stops himself. Why on earth is he upset? They’re not in a relationship. They’re not officially dating. They’re not even friends. Not really. Draco can snog whoever the hell he wants. Harry has no right to be upset. Logically speaking, Harry totally knows and understands that. But his heart tells him other things. His heart is upset and sad and angry and fuck - The way he’s feeling is absolutely ridiculous. Why is he feeling as if a truck just hit him with full force?
Harry rubs his eyes, his chest feeling uncomfortably tight. “I wanted to tell him, but it all happened so fast. It wasn’t the right moment!”
“Harry”, Draco cries and arches his back. Draco lets Harry fuck him patiently. His breathing is ragged and the heat radiating from Draco becomes hotter and hotter. “Oh Merlin, Harry, don’t stop, don’t stop, I need you, need your cock, fill me up, come for me, I need to feel your cum inside of me, please.”
“You know, there’s this fancy club in London. They arrange a huge Halloween party. I think we should go. Luna, Dean, and Seamus have already said they would go”, Hermione says. They’re now sitting in the living room, the fire in the chimney crackling softly after they put all of their luggage inside their rooms.
Together, they exit the room of requirement and head down to the dungeons. Harry points out that they should probably use his cloak of invisibility since they’re on school grounds, and they’re not exactly allowed to go to the dungeons at midnight, but Draco couldn’t care less.
Draco seems like a child. He listens carefully, takes notes when things get too complicated for him, he nods and mumbles incoherent words, he stares at the screen in confusion and fascination and Harry wants to kiss him. God, he wants to kiss him and tell him how much he needs him in his life. How could Harry ever think he could just be friends with Draco? Draco, the most handsome, sweet, intelligent, funny, adorable man he has ever met!
Draco sighs. He stares at his glass of wine. “Mother wants to visit relatives in France. She doesn’t want to spend Christmas in our little apartment.”
They end up discussing questions for about an hour until everyone feels satisfied and happy. Draco hands them the sheets and tells them to be on time.
And even though he misses Draco terribly, he’s also not brave enough to look for him and talk to him. He’s scared of finding something he doesn’t want to find. He doesn’t want to be rejected. And he doesn’t want to ruin things between them even further.
And then, because he can’t wait anymore and because Draco won’t make the first move, Harry surges forward. He grabs Draco’s waist and his throat, pushes him against the desk, presses himself against Draco’s body, and begins to kiss him fiercely. The moment their lips meet, it’s as if Harry was starving before, and Draco is water, saving his life. He needs Draco to survive, needs him to be impossibly closer. He needs everything about Draco. He throws off his glasses and puts them on the table next to them, never letting go of Draco once.
Draco smiles sadly and nods. “Yeah. Of course. Everything was different back then.”
Draco almost feels empty at the loss of contact, but then Harry grabs Draco’s hand and holds it tightly. It makes up for the empty feeling and it weirdly comforts him.
“And then it kept happening. But we were always intoxicated when it happened. We kind of made this agreement that we would have sex to relieve some pressure.”
“What do you need to see him for? Confessing your love to him, apologising for being such a dickhead and finally coming to your senses? Or breaking his heart all
"Thank God", Draco replies. "I love you too."
"I know", Draco grins, shaking his head in disbelief. "You really bring out the worst in me, Potter."
Harry stops in his movements and thinks about that for a moment. Draco doesn’t sugarcoat things, and he definitely isn’t obsessed with Harry. Yeah, maybe that’s why they get along. At this point, Harry doesn’t know anything anymore. Also, he doesn’t want to read too much into it. Draco told him he’s not into Harry. It’s just about sex. They’re not dating. They’re not getting into a relationship. They’re not even friends. It’s –
“Harry,” Draco whispers, wrapping his arms around the raven-haired boy. “Relax. It was just a dream.”
He rolls his head back and tries to adjust to the new feeling of Draco’s extended finger, pushing in and out of his hole. He’s being gentle, but it still stings.
Neville watches his upset friend and pats his back. “Draco -I”
Harry looks up in surprise, his hair already wet from the rain. “What are you doing here?”
Everyone’s here: Molly, Arthur, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Charlie, Bill, Percy, George, Fleur. It’s wild at the Burrow, and he loves it.
“We didn’t know for sure. But it became more and more obvious. You guys always met up with some mysterious date at the same time. You started watching him from afar. He started blushing every time he caught you staring. He would drool over you at Quidditch games and cheer you on, even though he hates Quidditch ever since the war ended. He never watches any game unless you play. You would always look for him in the crowd, you probably didn’t do it on purpose, but you did. Then, Halloween happened. I don’t need to explain Halloween any further, do I? After Halloween, we knew for sure.”
Harry smiles fondly at him. "It's far from being messed up, Draco. You're making it a lot more complicated than it needs to be."
Draco and Harry both roll onto their backs. Then, Draco starts to giggle. “Oh, Lord. That was insane. I can’t believe what just happened.”
Harry looks up through red eyes and nods. “Yeah. Okay.”
“Hm”, Harry says watching Draco with a dangerous glint in his eyes. “I hope I can live up to that.”
“Do you
If Draco could think straight, he would snap at Harry and never talk to him again, Harry is sure of that.
“Well, I’m only admitting this because I drank a freaking shot of Veritaserum.”
“Do you think it will snow before Christmas?”, Harry asks.
He shakes his head, takes a deep breath and closes his eyes for a second. When he opens them again, he’s staring into intense green eyes looking right back at him. His breath hitches in his throat and he feels a mix of embarrassment and arousal.
Harry shakes his head. “Liar.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
It’s been two weeks.
“Yeah. Don’t you?”
Harry nods eagerly. “Yes, please!”
Draco tilts his head. "What did you have in mind?"
Draco nods. “Right, right. Okay.”
“What? No. No, that’s not going to happen”, Harry says. “Lay on your stomach.”
Draco stares at him. “What? I did – how?”
He grabs Harry’s waist and pulls him close to his body, stumbles backwards against his car and runs his hands all over Harry’s body. Thank god the boy is wearing joggers, Draco can feel
Harry bites down on his hand, suppressing a scream. “Fuck, Draco feels so good. You’re so hot, fuck. Please, touch me.”
Harry bites his lip. He doesn’t want to confess to them that he
“No. I’ll eat whatever you prepare.”
Oh no. Harry's eyes open wide and he blushes faintly. He looks over at Hermione and presses his lips together in a tight line. She simply gives him an encouraging nod. Having no choice, Harry slowly gets up from his seat and walks over to Malfoy's table.
Harry nods and gets up. He walks past Draco and accidentally (or not so accidentally) brushes Draco's waist. Draco jumps three feet in the air and squeezes his eyes shut tightly. His entire body tenses.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry clinks their glasses and swallows the liquid in one go, never leaving Draco’s intense stare. He feels the power of the love potion run through his veins, clouding his brain, and taking away any sense of rational thinking. He takes a deep breath.
He immediately sends Harry the link per Email and types a response message.
Once he’s finished giving his lecture, the students rush out of the lecture hall leaving Draco to himself. Well, almost to himself.
Draco takes a couple of deep breaths and nods. "Yeah, don't worry. Just go to work."
“Draco”, Harry shouts and arches his back. “Fuck, I can't -“
Neville grunts. “That is a big, fat lie. Everyone finds you attractive. Even straight guys would fuck you.”
A mop of red hair runs past them. “Harry, Draco! Quick, in one minute it’ll be the new year! Get your cheeky little bums outside!”, Molly shouts as she rushes to the kitchen to grab some champagne.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco comes first, his cum spreading all over Harry’s dick and hand. With the new sensation, it doesn’t even take a second for Harry to come himself, with Draco’s name on his lips.
Neville takes a long sip from his coffee. “Draco.”
Draco grabs Harry's hand and leads him into his big bathroom. It has a huge bathtub on the left and Draco walks over to it, turns on the water and tells Harry to dim the light.
“Me too. Close, so fucking close”, Harry pants. He’s unable to form any clear thoughts.
Harry licks his lips, his eyes sparkling in amusement. "Yeah, I totally agree."
“I want you to be my New Year’s kiss.”
Neville makes a grimace and hides behind his shovel.
“Shit”, Draco whispers again.
Draco smiles softly. “Yeah. We’re friends.”
Draco presses soft kisses down on Harry’s messy hair and continues to rub his back while Harry breathes heavily into his neck.
Harry sighs. “Potions. You know how much I suck at Potions.”
* * *
“Haven’t talked in a long time, huh?”
“No love potions, no alcohol, no touching, no kissing, no sex”, Draco replies, watching Harry with curiosity.
“That is pathetic, Potter. You have fucking options, so use them! Some people don’t have that luck!”
“Oh Merlin,” Draco sighs as he wraps his arms around Harry and pulls him closer to his chest. He presses a kiss on his forehead. “I think I’m getting too old for this shit.”
Draco’s head snaps around, grey eyes staring into green ones. Neither of them says anything. Draco seems lost for words, his cheeks rosy, his lips glossy, the hair a mess and his hands clenched into fists. He’s never looked more beautiful to Harry. Harry’s madly in love with him, he realizes then. It’s a miracle to him how he pushed it all away until now. Fuck, Harry’s probably been in love with Draco from the moment they first kissed. It all seems so fucking ridiculous now. The Armortentia, the denial of feelings, lying to himself, running away from it all. He should’ve been honest with himself. He should’ve talked to Draco sooner for god’s sake. Harry was such an idiot! How could he ever fool himself and everyone around him and pretend he wasn’t in love with Draco? It's all crystal clear now.
“You tell me whatever this is between us.”
Harry looks up and feels as if someone had woken him up. “Huh?”
Oh God, why is he even admitting to this stuff? The Whiskey must be spiked.
Harry grunts. He strokes himself twice before he places himself on top of Draco.
“Draco has liked you for
His hands are clenched in fists, his jaw is tight and his muscles are trembling. Harry has never seen anyone in this much pain, not even the Cruciatus seemed this bad.
“This is an electric device. You can send letters and receive letters from anyone in the world. These letters are called text messages. It’s almost like your own little owl. You can also call anyone in this world. Calling somebody means you talk to them on the phone. Through the phone.”
He saves Harry a space and then lets a computer system choose the rest.
They stay like this for a while, both heavily breathing and panting, trying to come down from their high. Then, the boys both start to giggle.
“Draco, for God’s sake! I’ve known you my entire life and I’ve seen you in and out of relationships and your eyes have never lit up like they do when you talk about Harry!”
A weird silence settles between them. Harry feels the awkward tension again that he thought they had gotten rid of. But he’s just not used to talking to Malfoy yet. But since he doesn’t like the sudden silence, he decides to speak up.
“So are you.”
“Fuck, you have no idea how hot you look tonight,” Draco moans as he reaches for Harry’s cock. Harry feels close to passing out the moment Draco’s hand touches his aching dick. Harry reaches for Draco’s cock and begins to stroke him. They moan into each other’s mouth.
don’t find
Neville sighs. “She’s a big diva. This girl needs so much attention. But I don’t have the time to give her what she needs. That’s why she’s behaving like a bitch. Please don’t tell Molly. She’s going to kill me.”
“Do you think that I’m ugly?” Harry doesn’t know where that came from. Why does he even care about Malfoy’s opinion? He obviously doesn’t. Malfoy doesn’t matter at all!
Draco rolls his head back and Harry watches him in awe.
* * *
yet.”
Draco presses his lips to Harry’s forehead. “What did you dream about? You kept shouting and kicking me.”
Harry tilts his head. “That’s really sad, I’m sorry.”
“He told me he loved me. And once we were done, I fell asleep. When I woke up, he was gone.”
He stretches his neck and searches around the club for blonde, silver hair, but he can’t find him anywhere.
“Draco?”, Harry asks.
When they go to Hogsmeade together to get some butterbeer and to buy some bits and pieces, they walk next to each other, and Harry would only have to lift his hand a little for their hands to touch. He clenches his hand into a fist to stop himself from reaching out.
“Merlin, Harry. Draco actually likes you. Anyone could see that. Of course, he was jealous!”
Harry shrugs his shoulders. “I don’t know. I’m in a good mood today.”
. Or else I'll come right here, right now."
“Nothing but the truth. I always loved your hair, you know?”
After a long walk at the beach, both cuddling into each other’s sides because it’s freaking cold outside, thank you very much, they fall on the couch and watch ‘Jim Carrey’s A Christmas Carol’ together.
Draco tries to speak but the pain enables him to do so. After a while, he manages to speak up. “They told me - fuck- to find anyone willing to shag me and get it over with.”
Harry steps into his office and takes a quick look around. "Wow, your office is really stylish."
They use the exit at the back that leads to a secluded smoking area. The two men sit down on the bench with some safe space between them. Harry watches Draco fumble with the pocket of his jacket, and when he finally pulls out his cigarettes, he offers Harry one. And even though Harry doesn’t usually smoke, he takes a cigarette and puts it between his lips.
It's oddly comfortable working alongside Harry. Since the boy does keep quiet, Draco can easily focus on his work and also feels motivated enough to not get distracted by his phone or Youtube.
He doesn’t dare to move and wishes it could stay like this forever. He sighs happily and presses a soft kiss to Draco’s forehead.
For a terribly long moment, Draco stares at Harry’s hand. Harry is almost certain that Draco will shrug it off and tell him no. He knew that eventually, he would have crossed the line, just as he always seems to do with Draco. He prepares himself for the rejection.
Harry frowns. He wants to ask what kind of things Draco means, but his mouth forms other words for him instead.
Draco gets ready as if he had an out of body experience. He doesn’t really feel the water when he’s showering, doesn’t taste the toothpaste in his mouth and packs his things like a Roboter.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

“About everything. Life. The future. I don’t know.”
“I’m actually not looking forward to Christmas at all.”
Harry closes his eyes, lets his head rest on Draco’s shoulder and presses gentle kisses on his skin.
Draco licks his lips. “Well. I analyzed your hair structure, researched a bit. Long story short, I made a potion. For your hair.”
"I know, babe", Draco sighs, biting down on Harry's shoulder.
But Ron only giggles. “That’s a fantastic idea.”
Draco nods "Yeah, but-"
Harry shakes his head. “Merlin, why do you even care?”
“Soft or rough?” he repeats.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Let’s head to the bar!”, Ron shouts into his ear and Harry nods.
He can’t say anything else though. Even if he wanted to stop and distance himself from Draco, at this point, he couldn’t. He’s falling, deeper and deeper, and there’s no way to stop.
Draco sighs desperately as he puts down a plate with olives on the table. “He’s a freaking student, Nev. It‘s so freaking unprofessional to even think about him.“
Harry joins him. He laughs out loud. “Same.”
Harry stops and turns around to look at Draco. “Excuse me? Did you just say you never decorated a Christmas tree before?”
Draco blushes and grins. "Just don't let Ronald see those. He'll get me arrested."
“It was nice to see you, Mr Malfoy. But it's your turn now."
“That’s why you couldn’t take me to the hospital wing. Didn’t wanna embarrass myself being sweaty, with my dick all hard and thirsty for a cock.”
„We‘ll take the train on Thursday morning and get right to it once we arrive in London at 11 am. The first stop will be the National History Museum, we‘ll spend approximately four hours in there.“
“Calm down,” Malfoy whispers. “He’s not worth it.”
Harry nods, now understanding the whole situation in Potions earlier. "Me being close to you started this whole thing?"
Suddenly, Ginny grins and her eyes flicker dangerously. Harry knows this look too well. “Guess what?”
Draco feels sick to his stomach. He wishes he could just disappear and never come back. A thousand thoughts run through his head but he just can’t seem to make sense of any of them. He’s so confused, hurt, anxious, and angry at himself.
“Neville!”
Harry walks into the kitchen first, slowly turning around. “Um”, he starts. “I know we agreed not to give each other presents. But I have something for you.”
"We need to go back", Harry says, eyes filled with lust. "The play begins in five minutes."
Draco rolls his eyes and puts the lasagna on the table. “Still. It’s weird. It's probably forbidden”
“Harry,” he whispers and shuffles even closer.
Every time Harry catches a glimpse of Draco, the other man seems to be busy. He starts to walk the other way, or he begins chatting with his friends.
“No?” Draco asks and tilts his head. His interest has clearly been sparked.
"No", Draco lies but his mum only raises her eyebrows at him. "Okay, maybe. But it's complicated."
Once all of his cum has left his cock and found it’s way into Draco’s arse, Draco’s entire body tenses. He starts to tremble, groans and moans and cries and grips both of Harry’s hands tightly.
"Don't you fucking dare", Harry hisses.
“Do you prefer girls or boys?”
Neville sighs, but then he shrugs giving up. “Okay. Uh this smells delicious. I’m starving. Thanks for cooking, Malfoy.”
Draco looks up at him in surprise. “What? Right now?”
Together, they transfigure a book into a big, splendid Christmas Tree.
Harry nods. “I know, I know. I just –“
The corner of Draco’s mouth twitches as if he knows exactly what's going through Harry's head but he doesn't comment on it. He just shrugs. “No problem.”
Halloween is supposed to be on Sunday, but Harry isn’t in the mood to celebrate it this year.
Draco shakes his head. "So needy, so impatient", he whispers "but you'll have to wait."
“Alright. Let’s head back to the room of requirement?”
Harry turns around and sighs. There’s no way he’s going to fall asleep anytime soon, but it’s already three am. He can’t stop thinking about Draco, and how the other man is sleeping peacefully in the room next to him.
“I’m not so sure about this,” Harry exclaims.
Draco doesn’t lookup. “Um. Hi.”
“Yes”, Harry declares right away. Draco stares at him in utter disbelief and surprise.
Harry rests his head on his hand and watches Draco fondly. Draco doesn’t know where to look: Harry’s eyes, his lips, his hair, his neck?
Harry grunts. They don’t say anything for a while. Harry manages to calm down and takes a step closer towards Draco. He wants to say something, anything, but he doesn't know what to say.
Harry giggles. “Don’t worry, I’m sure it’ll be great.”
The boy steps even closer and puts his hand on Harry’s bicep. “I can’t stop thinking about you. I wish I could lick your abs, you know? Get a taste of you.”
doesn’t want to shag anybody else but Draco. He doesn’t even know when that happened. He already misses the other boy. Fuck, he’s so screwed. He tries very hard to push away any thoughts, but it’s getting harder every single day. Deep inside he knows he won’t be able to ignore his feelings for much longer. But for now, he’ll pretend that it all means nothing. Nothing at all. Yes. Absolutely, utterly nothing.
The girl blushes furiously. “Thank you very much, Professor.”
“But that’s so boring, mate. Please come!”
Draco turns around. The other man looks into Harry’s eyes. God, he’s so incredibly beautiful. Harry can't help but kiss him softly.
Draco huffs out a laugh. "Yeah, that too."
* * *
Harry blushes and sits down next to Luna.
The group of friends chats for a while, talking about Christmas and Christmas presents, self-made cookies, and Christmas markets. Harry feels peaceful.
"I can't go back in there now. I'm so fucking hard. I can't sit next to you for one and a half more hours.", Draco cringes at how desperate and needy he sounds.
Then, Draco leans down in one swift movement, wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders from behind, and presses a kiss to Harry’s cheeks. “Thank you. This was the best Christmas yet.”
Harry bites his lip until he feels blood. Merlin. "Merlin. Stop
“I was waving at you! For five minutes, straight. I looked absolutely ridiculous. And you stared right at me and turned around and flirted with that guy!”
Harry moans at Draco's soft touch. He's massaging his arms, his stomach, his legs.
"But I don't know how to write a whole assignment about that."
“Neville? You make hair potions for Neville?”
Harry cares about people. He always has. And he always felt protective over people and wants to help when someone is feeling bad. At least that’s what he tells himself when he walks down the crowded corridor and searches for the tall young man.
It’s pouring rain and Draco watches the gym anxiously for half an hour now. He just needs to get out of his stupid car and walk up to the receptionist and tell them he needs to confess his love to the most wonderful man he’s ever met. Can’t be too hard, right?
around?"
It’s scary and beautiful all at once.
“Please, I need so much more, Draco. Please, I need to feel you inside me!”
“Harder, Potter!”
“Let’s get breakfast, then”, the blonde man says and heads out of the room.
Harry sighs. Neville probably wouldn’t say that if he knew the whole story.
"Him being your student feels wrong?"
“We never actually hung out. We always met up just for sex. And then, we were always … intoxicated.”
Draco finishes his cigarette and flicks it away. Then, he gets up. “I’ll get back inside now. See you later.”
“You should see yours.”
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. He seems genuinely curious when he asks “Escape from what?”
Draco tilts his head. “Mhm. I can see that.”
But he also notices one thing: He fucking
“Sure,” Harry agrees because going outside to have a smoke with Draco Malfoy sounds fucking fantastic right now.
Draco sighs. “And I’m in love with you, Harry. Madly, hopelessly in love. And I’ve never felt like this about anyone before. I was scared, I was running away. I was stupid, okay? And I’m so sorry. But I fell so hard for you, I can’t live without you now.”
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Draco stares at him in shock and disbelief. But then Harry bursts out laughing.
“So are you, Malfoy. So are you.”
“Okay, okay,” Dean eventually says. “Ginny, you are the judge. Who’s the better kisser: Harry or me?”
Then, he heads to the door. Before he leaves, he turns around one last time. "Just for the record: I'm not seeing anyone either. See you on Tuesday!"
Harry still struggles to breathe slowly. He closes his eyes and tilts his head back. “
Draco eventually looks up at him. “Do you
Draco laughs softly. “Um, okay. I guess so. Thanks for that. Why, did you think I was older?”
Draco moans and shakes his head. "Fuck, no. No, it doesn't."
Harry wakes up from his trance and watches Draco limp towards the shower. He’s fully naked now and Harry has a perfect view of Draco’s wonderful, round arse. Harry gulps. Shit, he feels trapped.
The wizard stops in the doorway and watches Draco. He’s standing in the middle of the room, eyes closed, hands covering his eyes, and he’s breathing heavily.
, out of all people, managed to calm Harry down within seconds.
Then, all of a sudden, Draco turns around, rushes forward and throws his arms around Harry. He squeezes him tightly and burrows his nose in the space between Harry’s ear and his neck. “Thank you, Harry. Thank you so much.”
* * *
“It only gets painful when a potential mate is in close proximity to help turn the person into an even stronger Veela.”
Draco gulps. "That's not fair."
Draco doesn’t seem to notice since he’s busy tying his shoes.
Draco stares at him in disbelief. “You’re kidding me. We’re sitting in a fancy restaurant like a couple on a date night.”
so, so good.
Harry nods and smiles. “Yes, I do. That’s actually wonderful, Draco.”
Draco nods and clutches the mattress with his fingers tightly. “Okay.”
He doesn’t dare to say anything since he doesn’t want to interrupt Draco’s flow. He seems to be deeply concentrated. Harry has never seen anything like it. Sure, Hermione is focused when she studies, and Harry is very concentrated when he flies and trains Quidditch. But Draco seems lost in his own thoughts, caught up in his own little world of creativity.
“So, you’re just not hooking up with anyone, then?”
Therefore, Harry removes his mouth and conjures some lube into his hands. He strokes Draco’s back with his free hand as he enters one finger into Draco’s tight hole.
Harry doesn’t sleep well. He starts to feel anxious most of the time; he keeps dreaming about that night. He doesn’t eat regularly, and if his friends notice, luckily, they don’t comment on it. They know Harry well enough that something is up and that he will eventually talk about it when he’s ready.
Draco gives Harry what he needs eventually. He puts in a second finger and works him open slowly. After some time, he adds a third finger.
Draco then leans down and seals the deal with a kiss.
Draco lets out a desperate moan, feeling the sensation of Harry’s big cock against his own. He squeezes Harry’s arse and presses him down even more.
Ron nods happily. “I’m glad. Harry isn’t here though. He’s at the gym. Here’s the address.”
“You’re obviously pretty. I’m just not into you.”
Harry nods and does as he's being told. He watches Malfoy grab a few things from the cupboard and then he begins to work on Harry's brew.
Harry closes his eyes, holds on to Draco’s hips, and slowly, very slowly, slides inside. He’s so tight, Harry might actually faint. Fuck, how much better Sex feels when he’s sober. He can feel everything about Draco. He groans. Harry rocks slowly inside of him, slowly building up a rhythm.
“So, what did you dream about?”
Draco’s eyes light up with admiration. “Wow, this is so cool. I’ve never been down here before.”
Draco sighs in exasperation. “The flirting. The banter. The touching. Everything.”
He’s young, ambitious and hardworking and if that makes him a miserable single guy in his thirties then so be it. The thing is, Draco is truly happy. He just turned 31, he works at his desired university as a professor, he lives in a little cosy flat and owns a cat named Greg. Draco doesn’t feel like he’s missing out on something.
Harry nods and looks at the bathtub. Should he undress and get in the bathtub naked? Or should he keep his boxers on? How are they going to do this? He probably should’ve thought about that earlier, but when it comes to Draco, he can’t think straight.
When he looks up, his eyes land on messy raven hair sitting a few tables away from him. There's no way Harry has noticed Draco since he's sitting in a hidden spot.
Draco hesitates. Shit, he shouldn’t take the number. This is getting out of hand. This is
Harry smiles. “You put it on the top of the tree. It’s the last missing piece.”
Harry's hand finds Draco's crotch and he wraps his hand around Draco's dick, massaging it through his trousers.
Harry nods. “Yeah, sorry. I’ll try.”
“Harry,” Draco cries. Draco lets Harry fuck him patiently, melts like butter in his arms. Harry tries to match his strokes with his thrusts. He can feel Draco’s hot breath brush his ear. His breathing is ragged, and the heat radiating from Draco becomes hotter and hotter. “Oh Merlin, Harry, don’t stop. Don’t stop. I need you, need your cock, fill me up, come for me, I need to feel your cum inside of me, please.”
Harry hums in agreement. “Yeah. Me too.” He doesn’t think about how true this statement really is.
Draco moans and moves his own hips into Harry's leg. Then, he moves the finger inside of the younger boy, curls it and teases him with as much care as possible. Harry radiates so much heat, they're both beginning to sweat.
Harry does as he is being told and goes straight to it and grabs Draco’s arse cheeks with both his hands and begins to massage them.
But Draco nearly runs to the closest loo. He desperately needs to get away from everything. He feels so hot and aroused, and sweaty. His trousers are too tight and he needs some space.
Draco’s heart skips a beat. "Is that so?"
He can’t tell Ron that, for obvious reasons. But Ron still watches Harry through worried eyes. “Man. You’re behaving really weird today. When was the last time you and your mysterious guy hooked up?”
It’s stressing Harry out much more than he would ever admit. Just as he walks to his next class, he ducks his head down and tries to avoid as many students as possible. He even goes as far as pulling the hood of his cloak over his head. He rushes towards the greenhouses, hoping nobody will see him or talk to him, but suddenly, his shoulder bumps into a solid body. Harry’s head snaps up in surprise. Then, green eyes meet grey ones and his heart stops beating for a moment.
Harry continues to push into Draco, hitting that particular spot over and over again.
Harry shakes his head and points to Ron, who waves awkwardly. “Oh, I’m not alone. I’m here with my friend.”
it could never be the same. It obviously isn’t.
With that, Malfoy turns around and heads back inside, leaving Harry behind feeling absolutely star-struck and nauseous.
“You’re so fucking beautiful,” Harry breathes into Draco’s ear. Draco is probably the most beautiful human being that Harry has ever laid his eyes on.
The moment he steps inside, his eyes land on Draco Malfoy, standing in the corner, murmuring something into Pansy’s ear. Harry’s heart stops beating, and he wants to run away, but at the same time, he wants to run up to Draco and kiss him and hug him. He had no idea that Draco was invited. Frantically, he searches the tent for Ron, or Hermione, or anyone really.
“Harry”, Draco moans. “Please, hurry up!”
Draco smiles.
She shoots out the answer straight away. “I already answered this before. Harry.”
"No", Draco quickly says "That's not it. I believe he's very interested. I mean, I'm not sure. But he visits my lectures."
How could this get so far? Draco doesn’t even recognise himself anymore. He’s so passionate about his job, he can’t risk his position.
“Okay, and what exactly is this? And what is it for?”
“Mhm.”
“I'm being serious here. You’re head over heels for that boy. Just make a move. He’s not gonna wait forever.”
Draco moans. “Me too. Fuck, come for me, baby. Come for me.”
“So, there you go”, Draco says and runs a hand through his wet hair awkwardly.
Draco sighs in relief. “Well. I tried my best. Not sure if it’ll work. I don’t know your hair
“So,” Draco begins. “Is this becoming a thing now?”
. And Harry hasn’t been to any of Draco’s lectures. He doesn’t understand what happened.
Harry shrugs.
Malfoy sighs. "Just sit down. I'll brew it for you."
Harry sighs in relief and wraps his arms around Draco’s torso. He breathes in Draco, closes his eyes, relishes the moment. This feels like home. Harry tightens his arms around Draco and presses his lips to his neck. They stay like this for a while, until Draco removes his arms. Harry feels cold and wishes Draco would have kept hugging him.
“Guess I’ll head back to my room and get ready?”, Harry mumbles and runs a hand through his hair.
Once he steps outside, a big raindrop splashes right across his face.
He smiles at his coworker and gives her a soft kiss on the cheek. "Hey, Luna. Thanks for coming."
“I actually have something for you as well”, Draco announces, a deep blush forming on his face. “It’s meant as a joke though.”
Draco blushes and stares at the boy in shock. He wasn’t expecting that. “Thank you. I’m very pleased you enjoy it so much.”
side!”
Draco shakes his head again. "No, I'm not so keen on unnecessary body contact. If it's with someone I find attractive, then it's not a problem. But with anyone else, it is a problem."
He really needs to pull himself together. He finishes his lecture as he usually does, smiles shyly at the applause he receives afterwards and watches the students leave the lecture hall.
Draco nods, but he seems tense. “Yeah.”
Draco rolls his eyes. "I am not head over heels for him. I've just met him, for god's sake. I don't even know him. He's probably a complete psychopath waiting to murder me."
Instead of talking, they listen to their assignment. Draco takes notes and Harry is thankful for it because he doesn’t really listen at all.
Draco presses his lips together. „Don’t worry. You look fine.“
"No. I told you not to be gentle with me. This was perfect. You are perfect."
Draco shakes his head and presses his lips to Harry's. They walk up to Draco's door and he gets his keys out. "Don't thank me. It was the least I could do to make it up to you."
Ron licks his lips. Then, he slowly speaks. “You know, Hermione spoke to Pansy. And Pansy said that their gang might come with us.”
, Draco,” Harry breathes, and then both his hands slide under Draco’s arse, holding him up and spreading him open and squeezing.
“What is it then? What’s the problem?”
“And why is that?”
“Mhm. Really.” Draco mumbles. He stares at his shoes. “I also don’t care about anybody else. And I also hated kissing that guy. It was awful.” He watches Draco mesmerized. There’s a tiny voice inside his head, screaming not to step any closer. He will ruin everything between them.
Draco takes the knife and tries to follow Harry’s instructions. Every now and then, Harry places his hand over Draco’s to apply more pressure on the knife. He can feel Draco tense every time their fingers touch. Harry tries to focus on anything else than Draco's presence and his incredibly delicious smell.
Draco exhales the smoke and looks up into the sky. “Tragically, it’s the truth.”
* * *
Harry had thought that returning to Hogwarts might give him a break. He thought he might actually have time to get into a serious relationship. He was ready. He had the time and was in the right headspace. He wanted to be in a relationship for once. With Ginny, everything had been so rushed and forced. It hadn’t been the right timing and it definitely hadn’t felt right. It was meant to break apart eventually.
fucking good, you have no idea. ”
Draco Malfoy. The realization hits him like a truck.
Harry clears his throat and nods. God, how embarrassing.
this”, Draco moans.
Deep down he knows that Harry did the right thing. He challenged Draco, he directly addressed the situation and put Draco on the spot. He put him out of his comfort zone, which is exactly what Draco needs.
But he can’t talk about this. How could he confess to his friends that Draco and Harry got high on a dangerous, potent love potion just to fuck the entire night? That doesn’t sit right, even with himself. And still, that night was absolutely incredible. It was so fantastic that his mind keeps drifting back to it. He can’t think about anything else.
Draco smiles and holds out his hand for Harry to shake. Harry grabs it and shakes it. The moment Draco’s long fingers wrap themselves around Harry’s a tingling feeling sparks inside his chest and Harry can’t stop himself from smiling for the rest of the lesson.
The boy smiles. “I just wanted to say hi.”
Harry shakes his head again. “I don’t feel uncomfortable around you.”
Harry feels tears forming in his eyes. He never wanted to make Draco feel bad. He rolls his head back and stares at the ceiling. When did things get so awkward between them again? Harry has never seen Draco act this shy and quiet. And when did Harry get so nervous and unsure? Everything was going so great and now it’s all ruined again.
Harry shakes his head. “Um. No. I didn’t really have time. It all happened so quickly.”
Draco doesn’t dare to say anything.
It makes Harry feel all sorts of strange things when Malfoy's face lights up, when his eyes start to sparkle in excitement and his lips turn into a huge smile. It's even worse when he gets praised in front of the class. He seems so much younger and softer then.
When the gondola ride is finally done and they all meet up in front of the London eye, Draco feels like crying. He just wants to get home and sleep and never, ever
“You’re so fucking beautiful”, Draco breathes out. "I fucking love you, Harry."
“Is that why you like him?” Dean asks. “Because he doesn’t kiss your ass like everybody else?”
“And I’m angry because I know you feel something too. But you’re too stubborn and stuck up to actually confess to it. Or maybe you're scared, I don't know. Fact is,
He bursts inside the bathroom and already notices a pleasant smell coating the air. “Draco?”
* * *
Draco’s mouth falls open. “Oh, fuck, Harry!”
Draco sighs. He behaves like a little school girl with a giant crush on a teacher. Just that
Ron tilts his head and opens his mouth, but Hermione grabs his hand, forcing him to stay quiet.
"You don't know what you're doing to me", Harry whispers as his hands run all over Draco's sides. "You're so fucking hot, I can't think straight."
Harry nods. “Yeah.”
That is until he’s giving the first lecture of the semester about the First World War and its reasons. He’s busy talking and explaining and showing his students a few videos. He even answers a couple of questions which makes him feel very proud. Draco never feels happier. He loves teaching, he loves talking about things that matter such as history.
“Did you bring all of this with you?”
Draco turns around and gives Harry a tiny smile. Small, but genuine. “Of course.”
“Where should I hang it?”
“So”, Harry states. “You’re making breakfast?”
Harry shakes his head. “No, he wouldn’t. It’s not like that.”
Draco sighs. Then he chuckles and shrugs. "It's fine. You can call me Draco in here. But you still have to call me Mr Malfoy outside this office, okay?"
Harry huffs. “No, thank you very much.”
They exchange one last glance before they both open the bottles and drink the entire thing.
“You’re amazing, Draco”, Harry’s voice sounds so much raspier, it surprises them both.
Harry sighs but doesn’t disagree.
Harry feels his eyes fill with tears.
Harry’s throat is dry, he feels hot all of a sudden and he doesn’t know what has gotten into him.
“If you don’t care about looks, and if we’re both horny, why don’t we fuck?”

Draco only snorts, a few tears roll down his cheeks. He hisses, as a wave of pain must have shot through his body.
He begins to collect his stuff and puts it back into his backpack. "Thanks for letting me study here."
Harry smiles. “You’re actually really young.”
Harry sits down in the front row and puts his head on his hand. “I’m really looking forward to it. Even though I technically don’t have time.”
Draco doesn’t put on his nice grey jumper and his black trousers for Harry. He doesn’t style his hair in a nice soft quiff and he doesn’t moisturise nor shaves his stubbles Tuesday morning for Harry. He does it for himself. He doesn’t care about Harry. He
Draco rolls his eyes. “You uneducated twat. You really don’t know anything about a Veela transformation, right?”
