"No they aren't I don't want Slytherin's in the house dad!" yelled Ron making Harry curl further, Otiz by now was furious and was now growling and was about to attack when Severus spoke.
"Lets get these paper's signed shall we before someone decides to rise from dream land" smiled Narcissa towards the boy who still had a handful of Severus' robes.
Everyone was shocked at what Harry had inherited from his family, he had to be the richest Wizard in the world, but Griphook noticed something wrong with his accounts but he thought he would bring that up at another time as they were here for the blood adoption first then they would get back what was owned by the young Lord and Heir.
"Hadrian we have decided to take you to Walt's Wizarding World Attraction Holiday Theme Park!, two weeks away of pure joy and relaxation as well as celebrating two soon to be fourteen year old birthdays!" said Tom to him
He opened Harry's door to see Harry tangled in the blankets covered in sweat, he gently shook the boy. "Harry? It's alright. Wake up, you're having a bad dream" Harry's eyes then opened and he nearly jumped out of the bed when he felt Severus' hand touch his shoulder. Harry started crying "I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to wake you up" Harry mumbled. "It's ok. Just go back to sleep. I'll see you in the morning".
"Who in Merlin's name has done this to my Hadrian, I will kill them once I know who it is!" and he snarled at the three in the room.
She bit Draco drawing blood this made magic flash around the pair telling magic that they were bound together.
"Mister Weasely I suggest you let go of young Mister Snape there" said Filius to the boy but he didn't hear him or he did but just ignored the dwarf Charms Professor.
They had ended up at Zonko's Joke Shop as that was one place that Otiz really wanted to go and once they entered Otiz struggled to get down only for Pansy to do so but before he ran off to have a look Harry grabbed his arm.
Steam was coming out of his mouth, he wanted to get into that room and help Harry calm down but no matter how hard he tried the door stayed shut.
"Headmaster if I have to remind you again that my son is called Hadrian he is no longer Harry James Potter! Can't you get that into your head!" Severus had raised his voice which woke up from his sleep.
"Oh looks like the slimy snakes are bloody well here, why don't you all just sliver back where you bloody well come from and stay there for good, we don't need you here" said Ron making a shooing motion to make them leave.
Otiz wondered up to the staff table but not before he headed to the Ravenclaw table and licked Luna Lovegood and then Hufflepuff, no one seemed interesting there lastly he headed for Neville, Fred, George and lastly Percy making sure to lick their hands and growl at Ginny, Ron and Hermione, he hated them more than anything.
"He doesn't have to do nothing he doesn't want" said Draco to them coming over to help Harry up off the floor then noticing his bleeding nose and broken glasses.
"I'll be going to the Headmaster about this just wait and see what he has to say about this when I get him back into his position of Headmaster! That fake sitting in his seat will be out!"
Mark my words you slimy, disgusting death eater worshipper! You being that slimy gits son makes no difference you will be going down!
The three nodded at the request and Theo took hold of Harry who buried himself into his shoulder when he brought them to the sofa, they noticed that the other side had dipped and when they looked who it was, Harry threw himself into Draco and started crying.
"Can I hold him please, it's been so long since a child has been here that young" said Narcissa to them only for Harry to nod to her and let his father place the now out cold child in her arms.
"My homework professor and I hope that it exceeds all my others I spent almost all night on it!" she sung happily to him only for him to look at her in shock.
"Draco one of the guests is none other than Severus, he is bringing his son to visit us as he would like us to be his god parents. I will say this now my Dragon that his son had been abused and that he is now very shy and would appear to have some problems with dealing with this all"
Both Harry and Severus came running into the room wondering what was happening and when they saw the poor boy crying his heart out they sighed.
"Hadrian calm down we will be going out into the park soon but we aren't going anywhere until we are unpacked and had lunch" said Tom as he came out holding Harry's things and tried to march him into the room he would be staying for their stay but he was almost ball dozed over due to a hyperactive hybrid turned 6 year old human.
"Um.... I have an appointment....." and he turned down the hall towards the dungeons he didn't want to go to classes he wanted to be anywhere but near them.
He clutched the toys tightly to him, his magic still lashing around him which he didn't notice at all. He just wanted Otiz and his father but neither of them were there for him.
"D...d...dad" was all he said making his Gryffindor friends look at him, "Hadrian is something the matter here?"
I took it upon myself to adopt him as I have been through what he has been through and I would never let him go back to those...monsters he calls relatives.
No one noticed that two red heads were watching the whole thing play out and tried not to laugh at their siblings and their friend, it was way too funny, so in the end they headed up to their dorm and once they entered the fell on the floor laughing so hard that they had trouble breathing.
By the middle of the week, they were all potting on how to kill her without anyone finding out that it was them, this included the teacher who used to love her and all the hard work she used to do.
In the greenhouse they were working on the Valerian plant and what it could be used for most of the students made an 'yum' when they learned it could be used for Treacle Fudge but not Harry, they all knew he loved treacle tart but the mention of the fudge made him feel really sick to his stomach.
"Severus is this true young Mr. Potter's animal can do this?" asked Albus as he was holding the boy who was reaching again for Remus.
"It is not my story to tell it is Hadrian's if he should choose to divulge to, I am his father and as you stated when he got resorted at the beginning of the year" sighed Severus calling another house elf for another fire whiskey as he knew it was going to be a long night as well as a long weekend.
Harry took the toy off him which made him almost cry but when he turned the child to the other toy's, on the shelves he saw children Quidditch toys, brooms, snitches, quaffles, ect...
"Hadrian yes you can. Otiz can you take him back to the dorm room and make sure that his friends comfort him and I'll be back very soon".
Harry just nodded into his shoulder he didn't want to look at anyone, he was scared way to scared to admit it but he didn't think that they would love him now due to finding everything that had happened to him from the moment he started living with is ex relatives.
"Calm down" said Tom trying to help but he was just flung back and into Severus' waiting arms, "ouch".
Ron followed Hermione to Potions but half way there they saw Harry with Draco and Blaise all talking and laughing, Ron was fuming!! That was what they used to do!! Him, Harry and Hermione!! The three of them!
Both men stood up straight they knew not to mess with him when he was in this mood.. it was something you never did. He knew how to kill you without you even knowing.
I will see you tonight at 7pm sharp!, everyone read the chapter on the body bind curse and write an essay on it, a foot long please, class dismissed" and with that everyone left for thei next class.
With that she dismissed class but Harry stayed behind, he wanted to talk to her about what was being said and what would happen.
I should get you arrested for that! You freaks are nothing but a disgrace and should just die if you know what's bloody well and good for you!"
You sir left him alone to be treated less than a House Elf should be, bleeding, broken and bruised it has taken me a year to get him so then he feels safe in my presence, he's slowing opening up to the idea of a family. A real family.
"Well my client or should I say clients have such harsh treatment by Mr Dumbledore due to not checking up on young Mister Snape.
"Severus could we perhaps have a talk about Harry tonight perhaps?" asked Lupin to the dower man who now had a small child in his arms.
The morning came quite quickly if you asked one Severus Tobias Snape as he got out of bed he was met by a whimper and so looked down next to him and saw his son sleeping peacefully.
"Nothing Dray, just Dumbledore being an ass again, trying to make me go back to them of all people! He doesn't care what they did to me, keeps saying it's for the "greater good".
"Sir don't think that way, by the look of it all it was those people and not you. I would like you to come again free of charge that is, either that let your son pick something out of the souvenir shop, I'll pay for it so don't worry".
"Well I was on my way to class when I remembered that I had to speak with Professor Dumbledore and I've tried all the sweets that know but I couldn't get in to speak to him" she looked around the office spotting nothing that she remembered that belonged to Dumbledore.
As they were eating slowly they heard small crunching sounds coming from Draco's plate so they looked down what they saw shocked them.
"Hadrian we need to talk about Draco" said Severus as he came into the room smiling, he did that more often than before which made him look more human, more of a person then he knew Severus cared so acting like this also in turn made him smile as well. "Ok dad what is it" asked Harry putting his art work away.
He so wanted to laugh but then he felt something on his head he reached up right away and screamed in shock making everyone look at him.
The reason why your scar didn't hurt through the trial was because I was able to create a spell that wouldn't hurt either of us if we were in close proximity of each other all I have to to is cast it where I know you would be close and we would be fine.
Hermione was outside in the yard heading down towards Hagrid's she was fuming with what had happened to Ron.... letting everything that had happened since last year spill from his very own mouth.... it was still going almost twenty four hours and it was getting ridiculous... they were specifically told not to tell anyone when they entered the school back in first year and here he was spilling the freakin' beans!!
~Tom you're an idiot~ said Nagini as she came into the office with a cover that appeared to belong to one of the Slytherin's
Harry cried and cried, his magic lashing out of him! His magic took on a purple hue but we going black around the edges.
Example: the match to needle spell, mice to snuffboxes both from your first year, then we have Vera Verto spell, the softening charm and Reparifarge which undoes the spell being taught.
"Headmaster you know very well that Hadrian is a scared and shy child after what had happened to him, thank Merlin he lived through it.
So that's Ron out for good, yes he will be going to a Muggle school after he has been placed into a Muggle family who will have their memories altered into believing he is their son. He will remember everything sadly which is also a punishment in its self.
Severus was one pissed of man, he was more than snarky with anyone within a five mile radius, he was giving out detention for stupid little things like not wearing your tie properly or scuffed shoes and all because of one man....
Otiz, they had managed to dress him in a red sailor suit, with white sock and black shoes, he wasn't happy... he wanted blue like his hair, his fur colour but Harry had told him very bluntly no!
"Professor I'm sorry about that" said Harry to him but yet again he was looking at the floor scared, he only stopped when he felt fingers underneath his chin and onyx met forest eyes. "Harry don't be, if you want anything I will give it to you within reason, that is something that I will promise from today onwards ok" said Severus as he let Harry's chin go.
But before he could go any further he was punched none to lightly in his face breaking his glasses and his nose, blood spilling everywhere.
Hermione came round a few hours later and woke up to Poppy bustling around the room, she was attending to a few first years that had blown up a potion, a fifth year who had somehow fallen off their broom and broken their leg all the while she was ignored.
Otiz bound up to him and attacked him with barks and licks to his face, quickly changing into his six year old form.
"Otiz will you stop already and tell us what's going one already" screamed Harry after another thirty minutes of him not answering him.
But he was with Severus! The slimy disgusting Slytherin dungeon bat of Hogwarts, someone who had defiled him over and over again all throughout his adult life.
He took the parchment and headed straight for one Albus Dumbledore, without even knocking he kicked the door in making it bang against the stone wall.
He protects anyone he deems is worth it and the way he does is by feeling their magic and when he's happy with it he will lick their hands, if not be warned he will attack you.
"Otiz soon but first we have to put our things away neatly first then we will have lunch, then we will go out and explore the park we have two weeks here" said Severus finally able to catch both his son and familiar at once which had taken him about 20 minutes so far.
As they sat down Otiz whimpered and nudged Harry's arm and then looked at the table, he had nothing to eat!!! So Harry looked towards Narcissa and asked "aunt Cissa could I have some raw meat please, Otiz here only eats raw meat" she smiled at him and called a house elf to bring some raw meat to the pouting fox next to Harry.
Harry had managed to get to charms on time and he sat between Theo and Draco, Coco uncurled herself and sat on Otiz as they silently conversed about what had happened and she wasn't happy with Hermione.
By the end of the day Severus was exhausted, he never knew that the boy could have so much energy, he had never seen him so excited, running from one place to the next over and over again.
"Max come on and eat your breakfast or you will be late again. It's the same every morning with you. Your father and I won't keep taking you to school because you can't finish on time" said his new mother bringing him to the table, placing a bowl of rice crispies in front of him.
"I need you to set up a meeting with our esteemed Headmaster as he still isn't understanding that Harry Potter no longer exists, you have all the records on this and I would like you to make sure that he finally understands this" snarled Severus.
Just as Ron had finished shouted, Lucius sighed and Harry finally broke down crying into Draco's shoulder.. before Lucius could say anything the doors to the Great Hall banged opened to reveal two Aurors walked in as well as Molly and Arthur, Ginny trailing behind, they didn't trust her to be home alone.
Harry got up off the sofa he was sitting on and slowly made his way over to his father who was sitting in his chair in front of the fire.
Fudge turned to the boy and asked "young Master Snape are you will having trouble with him at school again? How are your sessions going?" but Harry kept tight lipped all he wanted to do was go home, he didn't want to go back to school.
They had their lesson on Bogart's and Neville of all people changed his Bogert Severus into his grandmother's clothes making everyone laugh, yes Harry and to tell Severus of it all and said man said that he would be kinder to the poor boy, which they had made much progress on it.
"We just wanted to know what was going on, why Har... I mean Hadrian isn't in Gryffindor anymore, why he changed his name that's all!"
By lunch time Ron still hadn't come back but the rest of the Weasely's had turned up to have enjoy the atmosphere that came with Christmas even though it was just left overs from the day before no one complained about it.
We also know that Ronald Bullius Weasley has been cast out and has become a Muggle, his magic bound so tight that he would never be able to use his magic again as well as any of his children in later years, he also has a new family as well, we might be seeing them again over the course of chapter/years/books not sure yet.
As they were leaving they saw Hermione walking towards them and once close enough she started screaming at them about how they could shunn Ron and then somehow making him lose his magic altogether!
She took Ron by the hand and brought him to his class for the first period it was completely different from what he was used to, normally he would have potions now but he was having something called Religious Studies which he knew nothing about, he knew about Yule of course and Halloween and how the Wizarding World celebrated it but here in the Muggle World he knew nothing of it.
Draco smiled he loved when Hadrian called him that but he wouldn't say anything about it incase he upset him and then he would have a meltdown which hadn't happed for a few months now, he was getting better.
Fudge nodded to this pulling out the file that he had on Harry and now held that held his adoption and blood adoption certificates.
In his quarters Harry was waiting with baited breath, he didn't want to go back to the Dursleys nor did he want to go back to Gryffindor he had managed to improve his grades and he had made some friends at least he thought he did.
An hour later the two were back in the office they had left, everyone was talking quietly and only stopped when the door opened again.
(All with unauthorized withdrawals by one Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, to the Order of the Phoenix and personal accounts of one Ronald Bilius Weasely to personal account, one Ginerva Molly Weasley to personal account and Hermione Jean Granger to personal account)
"WHAT??!! they hate me, me and Draco fight all the time we cant stand being in the same room as each other!" yelled Harry after taking a drink washing down the lodged food.
To him if your magic sings a happy tune to him and it's a white light or any colour light besides black then he's happy to protect you if it's black then he will never protect you and will be in you an enemy of him as well as his familiar.
When they had arrived home Harry bolted to his room and slammed the door shut! He didn't want anyone to hear or see him, without his knowledge he had cast a powerful silencing and locking charms on his door and room.
When it came to Harry's turn, Remus tried to get in the way but Otiz pushed him out of the way showing that it was his uncle, Harry stepped back scared having a grip in Otiz' fur only to make him pull forward as if to say face it he can't hurt you.
"Severus my boy please understand they are his relatives they can look after him, he must of hurt himself some how, it's quite normal for a young man such as Harry to hurt himself now and again, I bet he was just over reacting, weren't you my boy?" Albus redirected his sentence to the hidden boy.
Next it was time to really Christmas shop, he knew he WASNT getting Ron, Hermione and Ginny something, they didn't deserve anything after what they had put him though the past two months.
"Reviewing everything she is in major trouble not only has she rapped many students who were under a charm but has threatened to kill Hadrian Snape..."
"Ok what did it say all I heard was hissing" said Severus to them he was starting to hate Parseltongue.
"Oh Hadrian it's going to be ok, with me and aunts Poppy, Pamona, Narcissa, Molly as well as uncle's Filius, Arthur and Lucius you will be alright.
Everyone was shocked he was meant to be his friend for Merlin's sake but here he was slating his friend off, for what, nothing!
"Albus his name is Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, he is no longer Harry James Potter!!" Severus sneered again, making Harry flinch but with Severus hand on his knee he calmed quickly.
He looked down and saw that they were still stuffed animals but they were moving. His toy snake he had called Salazar was now wrapped around his arm hissing happily and his wolf he had called Mooney, he didn't know why but he called it that but it seemed to fit it, like a memory of some sort, was laying on his lap and it sounded like he was growling contently.
"Potter, Harry please this is the last time I'm going to beg you!" moaned Hermione she was getting pissed off now, just like the Weasley siblings.
Fred and George were having so much fun, they couldn't work out why they hadn't got into trouble yet as they knew that everyone knew it was them but nothing was being done and so they were delighted to just carry on with what they were doing.
"Lupin this is Otiz Hardian Severus he is Hardian's familiar, you know Hadrian as Harry Potter but last year before going back to school I rescued him from his relatives but I'll explain that more at a later date".
They had decided that from this day forward Harry would be known as Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape, Severus didn't want to take away Harry's connection to his father so let him keep his name but he thought that adding his own would help as now he had two father's.
Other Professor's have also come to voicing their complaint that have been brought to them about you, each one having evidence in hand.
"Ok then Maxwell ok, just breath for me. Remember out breathing exercises we do when you get like this.. that's right in and out, in and out well done Max perfect keep going that's it. Well done feel better?" she asked at the end only for him to nod at her.
I am a familiar and I will protect those I care about, I can smell that you were once both best friends but it changed when Sev adopted Hads here" with a flick of his wand Ron was now lying on the floor unconscious.
"Off you go everyone and enjoy your holiday" and he ever so slightly smiled to Pansy, Blaise and Theo.
"Do I have to?!" moaned Harry to his father but he knew it was wasted as his father only nodded to him.
Severus sensed that something was up in the common room and so left his potion brewing and headed straight in the room and was tackled to the ground by his son.
Now it was lunch and as he was heading there he was stopped by some Gryffindor's, his own house was going to be picking on him.
With that the Howler spat at them and ripped itself up in front of Ron, everyone looking at the two youngest Weasely's, Ron turing his sights right onto Harry, making the poor boy flinch, Otiz's hackles were standing straight up and vapor coming out of his mouth as it say 'you hurt him and I'll rip your throat out in half a second'.
"Come on son time for breakfast, go an have a shower and meet me in the living room ok" and he pushed his son towards the shower.
"What do you mean Harry's old godfather?!, I was named his godfather the day he was born!" screamed Sirius to his best friend after James that was.
He will always shorten your name if he likes you but will completely ignore you otherwise, he sees the Weasely family minus Ron and Ginny as his cousins, Molly and Arthur as aunt and uncle, Harry's Slytherin friends as his cousins as well. Lucius and Narcissa are his aunt and uncle be default.
"Oh can I sit here?" asked an airy voice bringing Hermione out of her thoughts and looked to see who was talking and noticed that it was Luna Lovegood.
He knew of Remus and his classes was something that he looked forward to even the big black dog that was normally found in the classroom or followed either Tom or Remus around all the time.
"Professor Snape, Professor Lupin, Professor McGonagall, you all saw it, that thing attacked me for no reason I demand you get rid of it right now!" she screamed at them.
They had managed to get mostly everything from London that they wanted but it was the last Weasley's that he found hard but he knew Percy being Percy would like something with law as he wanted to work in the Ministry, he knew Charlie worked with dragons and so would get him something along those lines and Bill well he didn't know what to get.
During the rest of the day Otiz stayed by this side not leaving, he had asked an House Elf for some food as he didn't to leave just in case something happened to Hadrian while he wasn't there.
"....yes thank you Mr. Zabini for that. Now as I was saying we will be spending a fortnight there and Lucius knowing him has already booked my events for all of us to go and see when we are there"
Behind them sat Ron, Ginny and Hermione all in their school uniform as Dumbledore thought that they had to come along for no reason what so ever.
"Ronald Weasely I would hold your tongue where it is right now mister!" she screamed at him asking him drop back into his seat, once she was at the Gryffindor table standing behind the pair.
Severus then let another five drops of blood onto the middle parchment and again it flowed and writing started to appear and that gave all his vaults which was another twelve mind you two of them belonged to Severus but still... twelve vaults!
Molly wanted to get up and say something to her youngest two but was stopped by everyone in the room minus Harry of course he was out for the count.
"He's been like this since I got up today he said and I quote "I'm bored so lets annoy as many people as possible" and since I've decided to pack or at least try too in case at hand and each item I put in, he throws out" sighed Harry as he again placed his uniform into his trunk only for Otiz to grab one and tried to throw it out but Tom caught him.
Albus wanted to say more but he noticed that his floo had activated and the other two had disappeared from the office.
Yahtzee brought a plate of raw meat to the staff table and placed in front of Remus making Otiz happily tuck into his food.
Once he was done he was met with yet again a hyper active Otiz in the living room. Otiz took hold of Harry's top and brought him towards the sofa where his father was drinking his coffee waiting for him.
Not once in eleven years did you once check up on the boy, he would of died if my subconscious hadn't of told me that I had to check in on the boy.
"No you can not Otiz" said Tom to the now pouting hybrid, "it's something that me and Severus need to tell Hadrian as it's a two part present"
The Perfects from the houses stood in front of the staff table and looked at all the teachers minus Albus really, it was Minvera that finally spoke.
"Harry I need you to hold onto me we are going to apparate" and with his they left and returned to Hogwarts only to leave again to Spinners End.
"Sadly I do not, if his own family don't know then we won't know unless th..." he was cut off by Hermione banging her hands on the table crashing everyone's eye.
"That's some kind of sick joke even for you professor, my grades are perfect! I don't even know why you sent those stupid elves gave me story books and a potions book for first year students, I'm in third year!"
"What my godson is now Snivellus' son why in Merlin's name was he allowed to do something like that, I'll kill him!"
Draco: chess set from Severus and from Harry a broom cleaning kit, his parents got him new sets of robes and some sweets
"Dray it's true Fawkes has told me that Tomas has finished and is heading back now" said Otiz as he walked up to Hadrian and pulled Pansy off him with a slight growl, Fawkes on his shoulder who trilled at them.
Severus paid for the cleansing and blood adoption and with that they all left to do their own thing, Severus took Harry home to Spinners End so then he could rest in bed.
As they were looking around everywhere enjoying themselves and everything when Otiz noticed some bushy hair in the distance, he straight away transformed into his animal form and growled.
"Can you sort out that thing of yours" said Ron but this made Otiz go on the attack but stopped when he felt Harry grab hold of him.
"Oh haha very funny Haddy, as I was saying Dumbledore can't do anything about it as everything is registered at Gringotts and the Ministry, if you go back to "that place" Uncle Sev will come and get you right away" and he messed up Harry's hair more.
Severus and Harry was gift with two house elves by the names of Boris and Mink, they were to be their privet elves only to serve them when they needed and would only obey them. Boris to Severus and Mink to Harry.
They all say down and talked and once lunch was called they all headed over the the dinning room where lunch was waiting for them.
"I kinda had something to do, that's all, sorry if I worried you" said Harry as he was putting some food onto his plate and slowly started to eat his breakfast, wedged snuggly between both Ron and Hermione, making him slightly uncomfortable.
I hope you all like this book 2 when I get up and writing it as this is just a quick review of book 1 mind you.
...they felt a snap within their sibling bonds meaning that Magic know cast him out of their family for good. Everyone in the hall felt the magic besides Ron as he was still shouting profanities at Lucius and at Harry.
"Hadwin Oti bored, wants up!" said the now six year old Otiz who had stopped in front of them all lifting his arms up asking; read demanding; to be picked up.
"We were asked by the Headmaster to join him in his office where he asked why Hadrian never went to his relatives or to the Weasely's for the summer. Let's say he wasn't happy with that answer" and he sighed and rubbed both boys hair.
"Well we went out for the day and we met some people that I never wanted to see again.... even if my life depended on it".
"That bushy haired witch is out ok, she's out and I don't trust her! She could be doing anything to try and hurt you Hadrian and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if anything happened to you.
Thank you Otiz, don't worry about her the Nargles are just confusing her, she might change if she is able to clear them"said Luna putting her shoes back on.
They explored Haleakala National Park where Severus gathered up different types of rocks, fossils and ash all to be used hopefully in up coming potions he had in mind.
The security guard walked up to them and asked them to leave right away and that they were banned from the zoo, the staff member of the reticle house came over to the pair.
Everyone knew he hated the end of year tests what he hated more was O.W.Ls and the N.E.W.Ts he could so do without them but they were a must for everyone Witches and Wizards to take and thankfully Harry wasn't going to be taking them for another few years.
"Well class welcome to a new year, this year we will be expanding on what we already know and will go back and forth with old and new material.
They need to be rip due to his teeth and claws, in other words they need to be highly durable for all occasions" explained Severus.
"Oh my love I know you didn't mean to but.. what has happened has happened" he hugged him "we are going to be in so much trouble, me for escaping and you for attacking someone which we all know you didn't mean to" he looked up to the sky to see that it was now becoming lighter as they spoke and so turned to Otiz to say something but all he did was nod and she started to drag Hermione away, stopping at the tree where Harry and Draco were hiding and brought them all back to the school.
The rest of of Harry and Draco's friends came into the library then and sat down in the only available seats, the desk with Luna and Hermione.
Harry finally broke, he was full on crying and wouldn't stop who would want to take him form his father? He was adopted and then blood adopted, he was legally Severus Tobias Snape's son..... who wanted him away from him.....
Everyone looked at him but Otiz paid no mind to them and started helping himself to some pasta that was close to him, with a flick of his wand a goblet of blood appeared before him as well as Mink, he was wearing a black and silver towel with the letter 'S' on it.
When he's 14 he sees Harry as his little brother as he is also a familiar he tends to stay a year above Harry to keep him better protected.
Within moments Narcissa was standing in the room, disbelief written on her face, this made then all stutter and back away slowly none of them wanted to be on the wrong side of one Narcissa Eridanus Malfoy nee Black!
Harry would have died if it wasn't for Severus going and checking on the poor boy, and that was if Poppy hadn't of brought it to his attention!
While everyone was eating Fred and George came up behind Harry making him squeak as they grabbed a hold of his arms and taking him out of the Great Hall.
Remus hugged Sirius tightly around his neck hoping he would change back but he didn't until he buried his face in Sirius' fur.
"Oh Hadrian!" exclaimed the rest of the adults in the room, Draco was leaning into his mother trying not to cry at what Harry had been through, so much more than anyone should of come through.
"Severus what has happened to you? Don't take your anger out on a small boy" said Tom to him but Severus growled at him.
He called up to Ginny to come down for her dinner, at first nothing happens but then there was a bang and shouting, he sighed as she finally appeared at the bottom of the stairs.
Tom was in the doghouse, big time that was for sure, Severus hadn't even spoken a word to him yet looked at him since he had come to his office demanding to know why Hermione was out of isolation.
Hermione noticed right away that her book had bits and pieces missing and so she would have to look it up if Madam Pince would let her that is or she would get another failing grade which she couldn't afford to get.. she was getting worse than Crabbe or Goyle and they don't even do their homework.
Otiz was trying to push Blaise out of the way to get to Harry as this had also become the norm but stopped when Hedwig came flying in landing on the table in front of the three.
"We should speak to Tomas about why she was seen there and not kept into her room" and both got up and left the office and headed up to the Headmasters office.
"You're disgusting and if you come anywhere near the Puffs you will be dealt with" amd he returned to his seat, Professor Sprout, Pomona looked towards the Gryffindor table and then looked at Minerva.
They then both looked at Otiz who was still growling at Lupin but then looked at Harry and saw the question in his eyes and so transformed back into his human form.
Hermione hung her head low and started reading her book on Care of Magical Creatures for an essay that was due in on Monday.
They had finally finished with all the magical toys and so Severus thought it would be a good idea to go into Muggle London to finish getting something's for Otiz while spending time with his two boys, yes he was now counting Otiz as a son instead of a familiar to Harry.
" I can't change it Miss Granger the only magical signature on this work is yours and your teachers, I have nothing to do with this at all, your tutor will be here tomorrow morning after breakfast, I suggest you finish the work given to you, have dinner and get an early night. Goodbye Miss Granger" said Tom as he got up and both him and Minerva left the room.
"Next is Smiler and then before dinner its Saw and I'll leave you alone then" said Harry as both him and Otiz dragged him off to the Smiler which was just around the corner both smiling like crazy and Lucius following behind them, they were met up by everyone else.
"Ronald Bilius Noname you are to escorted out as you are no longer a wizard, you magic has been locked away and you will never be able to feel it again" said one of the Aurors making Ron look at him wondering what he meant but nothing else was said.
Staff members all cooed at what they thought was the father of the sleeping boy making him blush slightly, once at the till they paid and headed back to the Leaky Cauldron and then they apparated after Lupin took hold of Severus sleeve along with Harry.
Lucius tried to say something but it just came out as animal noises, Tom tried as well but he too made animal noises which didn't please anyone which made Severus scream but all that came out was quacking noises.
Inside the office sat one pissed off Severus holding Harry to his chest who was still crying while the other four students stood in front of his desk.
The boys entered Dervish and Banges and picked up everything that Severus needed and it was a long list, thank Merlin he had Floo'ed ahead and Dervish was happy to give them what was ordered.
The last thing he remembered that he was eating in the Great Hall with his friends when the new Headmaster was introducing himself and then everything went black.
"That hurt!" she said getting up and trying to dust herself off from the forest floor which did really nothing as she still looked like a mess.
Remus took the seat that Harry had vacated and gave the Headmaster a cold hard stare making his honey coloured eyes turn gold, Mooney right below the surface.
Once changed he followed Griphook to the polished stone table in the centre of the room, he noticed that it sat in the middle of a Faustian Mark, and once he got up onto the table it flowed slightly meaning that it had recognised him needing to be cleansed.
He didn't notice one bit that it tasted ever so slightly off and just kept eating them until lunch time, he couldn't even be asked to do his work.
Lupin looked on he never knew that the boy they had once called Sniverllus back at school could be so caring to his cub, this made him smile it looked like Harry was in good hands but he could smell an underlying bitter smell if he could call it that.
She hung her head and sighed, she knew she wouldn't get away with it now, everything was there in front of her.
What do you think is office looks like? I'm think bright and airy with some colours of the houses dotted around and some plants, what about you?
"Quite right sister it is, it was ok when he was little but this is going on boarder line crazy" said Jessie getting up with her sister as they had finished.
Eyes narrowed towards the boy, but said boy was about to dart out of the room when another knock on the door was heard and so he went to answer it.
Me and Tom throught it would be a great idea to take you and your friends to somewhere that lets you experience joy and laughter...." he let it hang in the air for a bit.
"Just keeping you innocent until you're at least sixteen or if I had my way until you're twenty one but Tom said I need you to spread your wings and let you grow" he sighs.
"Hadrian just calm down ok... just take a deep breath and..." he didn't get to finish as he was tackled to the ground by a hyperacive child! One Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape.
I wish I was there to help you and introduce myself to you back then and also introduce you to the magical world but Dumbledore sent me away" he sighed and picked up his drink, taking a sip he and tired to calm his nerves.
Severus came into the room to check on everything when he saw his son fast asleep on Draco and Otiz curled up next to him.
"Yes Luna he is but he's still in trouble for breaking my last quill and stealing the others including dad's favourite one, so we are on a mission to get him a new one and a few more for me and hopefully he doesn't eat them again and end up at Madam Pomfrey again.
It was slow going but he managed somehow, it could all be down to him being a spy and was able to get himself out of tricky situations he found himself in but he managed all the same. After getting dressed for the day in his normal black attire he went into the living room and sitting there ready for him was a piping hot cup of coffee and that mornings news paper.
You will notice what I have said has already been done, your window is also blocked so you can't see outside until we find you have learnt your lesson now march!" yelled Molly to her daughter once she handed over her wand to her mother.
Otiz had selected many blue tops all differing in shades, black trousers and blue and white shoes, he wanted no other colours besides those.
Otiz wasn't really helping either as he was also stuck to Severus like glue all in the name to protect Harry from what had happened in the Great Hall.
Narcissa smiled towards the boy and said "Sev you don't have to explain everything again, after your owl came with the letter explaining everything that had happened to the poor boy we knew we had to step in right away"
"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED! WHERE'S HADRIAN?" they both shouted only for the phoenix to trill angrily at them kindly asking the to 'shut the hell up'.
"Mister Malfoy where is Mister Potter? I asked for all you to come to my office, why isn't he here as well?".
Fred, George and Percy were shocked at what the school had started to do but they were also happy about they wanted nothing to do with their once brother, the shunning also meant that as he was their family he would be cast out.
Sirius Orion Black (alive, Azkaban) Alice Sarah Longbottom (insane, St. Mungo's) Frank Augusta Longbottom (insane, St. Mungo's) Lucius Abraxas Malfoy (alive, through adoption), Narcissa Aquila Malfoy nee Black (alive, through adoption), Molly Nicola Weasley nee Prewett (alive) and Arthur Septimus Weasely (alive)
The parchement glowed and then a copy was made and then both disappeared one into the Prince Vault and the other to the Ministry.
Then coming home and crying, being comforted by Severus and then a flash of magic and now his once hybrid animal familiar as now a young boy!!
"Hadrian, son take this potion and try to get some rest while the rest of us discuss everything ok" said Severus as he handed Harry a Calming Draught which he took right away, relaxing into a light sleep on his father's lap.
Sirius just whined not wanting to leave the safety of the table he was under but when Tom slowly nudged him out and told him to go and see his friend Sirius went slowly to his best friend.
"So a new familiar has entered the family it seems" laughed Severus as he went and made everyone a drink and they sat down to enjoy the rest of the weekend getting to know the new familiar Coco.
Harry washed and changed into his only pair of robes after his 'loving' uncle burned the rest of them, thank god Hedwig managed to fly away before anything could happen to her, as he left the bathroom a cup of hot chocolate was waiting for him and right next to it hooting away as she was being petted by Severus was Hedwig.
Once back in their apartment he finally collasped into a chair and sighing, he took of his shoes and sunglasses, he was going to take his har out of its pony tail but stopped when he saw a flash of light.... a camera and one sorry teenager was looking at him.
Hermione wanted to say something but she knew if she did she would be in more trouble, she had made sure that she had kept her head down and she wanted to keep it that way.
"Severus can you bring young Mister Potter to my office please. Remus I would like you there as well" and so he left the two, without listening to Severus about Harry know being known as Hadrian.
Hermione wasn't happy about it and stood up and started complaining about how they should follow school rules.
Harry looked at Severus and Severus looked at Harry and then they both looked at the gifts sitting in their laps, both laughed at what they were doing and started opening their gifts.
Fred and George kept themselves to themselves but they had made sure that the House Elves had slipped something into their food, it was the same thing as Ron and Hermione had, this was going to be so much fun.
Severus contacted me a few years back when you first entered the school wondering what we were going to do but when he found you at the end of your first year everything changed.
Otiz really wanted to doodle on some of the class but he too was almost asleep half way through.... Hermione on the other hand wasn't so there went that idea.
"Yes there is sir, these people have accussed me stealing my son from them. I haven't got a clue what they are on about, we want to leave but they won't let us" and he sighed towards them.
As they floo'd into the living room both of them were hugged to an inch of their lives by one Molly Weasley but were happy enough to be hugged minus Severus.
"Tev were we go?" asked Otiz as Harry took hold of his hand tightly while they walked through the Leaky Cauldron and into Muggle London.
"What was that password anyway it sounds ridiculous if you ask me" she said sitting down without being asked to.
Eriol got up and once Ron saw a bright red letter attached to Eriol he knew he was in trouble, everyone at the table looked on to see why a Howler of all things had been sent to the Weasely's, they were the one of the lightest families in Britain.
Griphook looked on, keeping a close eye on how the two were acting towards each other and then smiled a wolfish smile he knew he was going to have some fun information thrown at him during this talk.
Draco got up to leave the room, thinking of how he would go about apologising to the boy, who looked so much smaller that he knew from school.
"Miss Granger must I inform you that if you carry on you will be exspelled from Hogwarts as you are already in so much trouble as it is" said Minvera to her.
The other two noticing a glare on them they turned round and faced him, the Grimm tried to hide from Remus' stare behind Tom but he only jestered for Remus to come up to his office after dinner that night.
"He's not James anymore, his hair is slightly messy but straight if you can believe it and his eyes are Lilly a beautiful shining emerald green. He's meek and shy but he is more likely than James in personality. Just to warn you he has a familiar which is very protective of him, he is two Japanese demon's in one, he looks like a large light blue fox really.
Otiz was having a ball day with is fur changing and was up at the staff table showing everyone he could, when he got to Dumbledore he hissed at him and carried on to Poppy and Pomona who both smiled at him.
I know their youngest two have been bullies to you but from what I know from what Mrs Weasely is like from her oldest children she is a force to be reckoned with.
She knocked on the door and waited for Hagrid to answer but when he did and saw who it was he wasn't happy about it.
Harry was bouncing around looking at anything, everything he couldn't sit still for a matter of what 3 minutes until he was up and looking at something new again, Otiz wasn't really helping much either he was now in his child form and was climbing everything and jumping all over the beds an sofas.
"Miss Granger what can I do for you besides give you detention for being out of class for no reason, you don't have a free lesson so... I would like to know why you were outside my office and not in class" said Tom.
"So my young friend this is a gift for someone you love right?" and he smiled at the blush that creeped across Harry's face. He saw Narcissa as a mother figure more than anything.
He was brought out of his when he heard Harry laughing he was being licked but the cat... no kitten by the looks of it all but it was huge!! but when he looked again it was neatly tucked into Harry's arms sleeping.
"I would like everyone that has had been hurt by Mister Weasely to come to my office right away and I would like each and everyone one to write a statement.
"You kidnapped our nephew and you expect us to be quiet about it and after a year you appear with the blasted god for nothing freak at this place!
If young Hadrian would be willing to submit them that would help everything, you cause" said Fudge to him.
Great someone wanting to talk to me as my freakin floo, should of put a spell on it, has just gone off, so I leave the safety of my personal potions lab to find out who it was. Standing there in my living room is none other than Poppy Pomfrey looking rather worried, this can't be good I have never seen her like this before.
Harry's eyes then opened and he nearly jumped out of the bed when hand touch his shoulder. Harry started crying "I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to wake you up" Harry mumbled. "It's ok. Just go back to sleep. I'll see you in the morning".
"Just a few more seconds young Heir Prince and it will be over" said Griphook from his spot on the circle, they had been working on breaking and cleansing everyone out of his body which had been forty five minutes and a normal cleaning would only take about twenty no wonder the poor boy was crying.
Arthur and Molly looked at Severus and then at Ron, back to Severus and then at Harry, no one looking at Otiz as he was slowly but surely getting closer to Ron.
"Rest young Heir Prince and I will bring in your father, is there anyone else you would like here as well? " asked Griphook but Harry just shook his head all he wanted was his father.
"What could they get up to?" asked Sirius making them look at him he just "oh'ed" recalling hat Harry could do with the help of Otiz, Fred and George were on the level almost as the Marauders back when they were in school, so adding complete pranksters into the mix they were doomed.
Harry nodded at this, "I don't want Dumbledore and my ex friends to interfer anymore, I want them to leave me alone!" said Harry to the Goblin who again smiled towards the shy boy, not as shy as he had been but still shy.
On the way there Harry started to heat up, hotter and hotter and then he just bursts into flames, Otiz did the only thing he could think off really, he dropped Harry onto the floor.
Both knew it was Severus shouting as at the next minute they saw the man in question, his face was as black as his robes.
"Dad?" Harry asked nervously towards his father, keeping a tight grip on Otiz for support as now he was bringing to transform back into his animal form.
"I'm sorry professor I've been asked by the Headmaster to bring Snape to the Headmaster as well, I'm sorry that I won't be able to attend class" said Draco only to have Filius sigh and turned to Harry.
"Why did he lick us?" asked Percy, only to have Severus answer as now Harry had decided to retreat into his jet black robes hiding away, Otiz clearly standing in front of him.
"Now that we are all here, let us get down to business" said Lucius as he picked up a cup of coffee that was brought in by a House Elf, he gestured to everyone to help themselves to the refreshments, everyone in turn took a drink but Harry.
At the end of the day after having his lessons in that small classroom as well as his lunch he was brought to the car park where his sister's were waiting for him.
"Ok then Hadrian all you have to do is take this dagger and cut your finger and place five drops of blood on this parchment, this will give us your birth certificate, as you already have your adoption certificate, this one will have what you are Lord and Heir too as well.
"You know I asked Hadrian for help Sev, I didn't know what to do to get back into your good books, I don't want to be in the dog house any more, I love you, you snarky bat" he kissed him full on the lips
"Ok whats going on? Why did you wake us.. should I say me up as Hads is still sleeping" yawned Otiz once he was standing up and stretching making his back pop.
Once standing in front of everyone Harry whimpered again and tried to hide again but with Severus' hands on his shoulders, he mumbled his name but no one hears him and so Severus bent down slightly and said "Hadrian can you say that a bit louder for everyone to hear you please?"
"Harry leave those slimy snakes and come back to the lions right now" said Hermione, she was not helping one bit but she had to put her two cents in.
"Otiz can you stand here for me while the Madam measures you for your clothes?" asked Harry only to get a happy nod in return.
After introductions were done Harry dragged Severus outside into the heat which made the man sulk too but he wanted Harry to be happy so he went along with it.
After reading for a while he finally heard movement in his bedroom meaning that Harry was finally getting up for the day, he carried on with the news paper that he was reading until he spotted a mop of dark hair in the door way and when he looked it rushed away banging a door as he went.
"It's what you heard Sir...." he raised an eyebrow but she didnt see it as she was trying not to look at her two Professor's but instead lookd at her shoes.
Severus had decided to take Harry back home for the fortnight of the holiday even though Harry had begged to let him bring Draco along, Severus just said to him "some father and son bonding is needed".
If it wasn't for his father young Mister Snape would have been killed but his ex relatives it had taken Madam Pomfrey weeks to get the boy healed throughout his life if young my client Mister Snape was at at the receiving end of the abuse he was given by said ex relatives.
Inside Harry brought them to the hoodies which one that he saw had a red loin and green snake on, which paid homage to both Griffindor and Slytherin which made Severus laugh.
"Mrs. Millstone is everything alright with Maxwell, this seems different than his normal behaviour" he asked her only for her to sigh.
"I was thinking we could do our Christmas shopping today, get t over and done with, no before the whole Yule rush" said Severus putting down his cup of coffee, Harry only nodded having his mouth full.
"I missed you so much Paddy, after James and Lilly died I had no one else. Harry went to his aunt's, you in Azkaban, Wormy high tailed it out of there, I was so alone" and he started crying.
"Come on son, I know you love this place but remember we can always come back. Now stop your silly complaining" and he ruffled his son's hair and smiled.
"I don't know what they are talking about! I am the future Mrs Potter and I don't care what they say! I will be the future Mrs Potter!"
"Would it be aright with you Hermione if we saw your work, just in case that is" said Ginny to her distraught friend and so she gave over all her work to them so then they could look it all over to see if anything was out of order.
"Yes Professor, they belong to me. I have to be honest to you I only wanted to be the best witch around, I didn't want to be out done because I'm Muggleborn! I just wanted to prove myself! I didn't care if I had to cheat to do it!" said Hermione getting more and more worked up.
You will notice what I have said has already been done, your window is also blocked so you can't see outside until we find you have learnt your lesson now march!" yelled Molly to her daughter once she handed over her wand to her mother.
"Every well I would like to know what has happened to you young Mister Snape and why in Merlin's name you have got resorted in the first place, Professor Dumbledore said that you left your relatives for unknown reasons but is that true?" she asked him making Otiz's hackles climb he DID NOT like where this was going.
Harry whimpered slightly cutting off what ever Marcus was going to say and mumbled just loud enough to hear "it's not Harry Potter anymore it's Hadrian Snape..."
Ah picked on the dreamy looney girl in the library and so Lady Hogwarts attacked her, the wench is now out from Poppy and Lady Hogwarts can hear and feel her plotting against you!
The day started out fine Harry had to admit Herbology was good Professor Spout talked about the Venomous Tentacula, good thing it was only revision, next was Charms where they learned the Shrinking Charm which was great as he was one of only a few that had managed it. Hermione wasn't one of them.
"Very well Hadrian anything else you would like? Otiz what about you?" said Severus to the two boys.
"Hads don't say it" said Otiz as the bubbling and hissing continued only for the goblet to explode but before it could harm anyone a shield was in place.
"Who does that bird belong to?" only to have the door open again to reveal Severus with Tyki on his shoulder nuzzling his beak into his hair.
Otiz had promised to behave himself and not go all demon on anyone, he sat there in a suit that he was forced to wear, it wasn't even in his colours, it was black of all things!
"Well took you long enough, been here for what forty five minutes after I had knocked out the Weasel, got no thanks for that by the way..." and he shook his head and his ears went away.
"Sev I'm really sorry, I was insensitive and stupid can you ever forgive me?" he looked into watery onyx eyes, his dark blue eyes looking into them.
"Yeah Harry come on let's go" said Ron grabbing Harry roughly by the elbow and pulled as hard as he could.
"Mister Snape his magical guardian is none other than Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts as you both know" this made both of them look at the Goblin in surprise. Albus knew this was happening!!! He was the boys guardian!!! How did this get missed by him!!! Albus of all things!!!!
"Miss Weasely he has been adopted last year, we have on file from Madam Pomfrey and St Mungo's about his abuse at the hands of what you call "loving relatives" they have been dealt with we are here about why you have done".
"Albus I do not care what you think as he is my son and that all paperwork is filed in the correct places, the "t's" crossed and the "i's" dotted, you have no right to move him back to his abusive relative's or back to the lions den. He is now and forevermore be a Slytherin and my son, good day Headmaster" and with that he left the room, he so needed a glass or two of some nice fire whisky.
"Dray stays here. He said to us that he needs to go to Dervish and Banges as well as Scrivenshafts Quill shop, plus Sevvy has asked us to get him some more red ink" said Otiz making sure both Harry and Draco where behind him.
But said boy was laughing and everyone was woken up by his laughing, Otiz' barking and running of feet, they weren't happy but it was either get up now or be pranked and with a pranking hybrid it was safer that they got up.
Seeing this Severus stopped and smiled slightly..... Severus Snape, the Demon Dungeon Bat of Hogwarts was smiling of all things, this made Harry smile shyly to him.
Waiting on the table was a starter of ham and pea soup for Severus and stuffed mushroom in a garlic butter for Tom, a main of lobster ultimate feast with broccoli, garlic butter and lemon for Severus and for Tom sirloin steak and chips and for dessert of tiramisu layer cake and molten chocolate lava cake.
Draco just mumbled something under his breath but Severus caught it, due to his years of being a spy "Draco please enlighten us of what you have just said" this made the boy jump out of his skin.
He was out right crying at this point waking Draco up when he looked at the time after checking seeing that it was now one in the morning he got out of bed and sat in Harry's.
Everyone knew that the twins were behind this but due to practically everyone had been pranked even themselves they couldn't prove it as all.
Harry looked at his father who was steaming he didn't want him to go, he didn't want to be left alone like he had been for so many years after his parents had died he wanted him! Did the adoption and blood adoption mean nothing now!?
Dinner was over and everyone started to head out of the Great Hall other than the Slytherin's that is they waited and once the rest were gone they decided that they would talk to Harry in the common room and then head to bed.
Little did anyone else know that one snarky potions professor as well as one brave lions head were also helping them with everything, even though they were also pranked!!
"Aren't you coming? This is your room" Harry then scrambled to Severus' side, Harry then looked up and asked "M-my room? My own room? at home I never really had a room, I always slept in the cupboard" Harry slowly looked around the room that he could call his, it had a four poster bed, a dresser and a desk. Harry was still so shocked that the greasy git of a Professor was being so nice. "Thank you sir" Harry mumbled while giving Severus a hug, "you're quite welcome, well off to bed with you, if you need anything at all my bedroom is just to the left of yours. The bath room is to the right of your room" Severus watched as Harry set his things down and climb into the huge bed.
Before Harry could sit down he was pulled into Severus' hold and hugged him gently making everyone look at them like their head of house had grown a second head as well as other appendages.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, this is the best present ever!!" said Harry getting up and hugging not just Severus but Tom as well.
Get over it and think about someone other than yourself for once you brat, you had a five star up bringing compared to him. He is only here because I rescued him from those monster's that Dumbledore sent him to.
"Minerva if I could be so kind to ask you escort these two young gentleman to the Slytherin dorms while I put my son to bed for the night and I ask that all of you be so kind as to never let slip what you have learnt tonight" said Severus getting up from the chair and leaving the room.
Once he gets to know you he should be fine but be warned again he can transform into two other forms a six year old boy and a teenager and the said teenager is Severus in personality. I think Hadrian called him Otiz not sure though" said Remus hoping he had the information right he looked to Tom hoping he was right.
What do you want me to say Thomas! I forgive you! Like heck I will! You pathetic, insignificant arse! I should never of confessed my feelings to you, you idiot!" he was back to crying.
"Thank you Hadrian for this and either way I'll get you some sugar quills ok" and they both left the room and headed towards the living room only for Harry to stop and stare at the blonde headed boy in the room.
"Voldemort.. I didn't think it was you but now that I look it is you.." and he glared as best he could, truth it would be no where near as effective as Severus' or Otiz' but it would do for the time being.
"I...um... I don't really know" stammered Harry making his way over to his father and sat down on the bed next to him.
"How could you do that to the students and think to get away from it! You disgusting girl! Hadrian is more than enough traumatized by what his relatives have done to him since the moment he was placed within their care....
With their loving care I know his relatives will look after him and care for him like any other family should. They have missed him and have reported it to the Muggle authorities because he went missing...."
As they sipped their fire whiskey and ran over everything Narcissa walked into the room and sighed, she hated when these two got together, yes it was to do with her godson, her nephew in her eyes but.. drinking at eleven am was stupid didn't they have something better to do than that!
"..........................They have been released from prison, they are now back home and are waiting for you to return to them for the holidays" said Albus but by this time Harry was in a full blown panic attack, Severus was by his side in a flash.
"Mister Weasely I suggest you let go of my son this instant" said Severus, this made everyone look at him, Ron at that moment lost all colour in his face.
"Why do you think it would be us of all things GINERVA!" spat Fred to her, using her full name which all of them knew she hated.
"So where are we going in Hogsmeade? I do want to try the sweets and have a butterbeer" said Otiz finally leaving as walking down to the little village along with everyone else following.
The other grabbed a few sweets and paid for them and left, Otiz happily eating a blood lolly as the group all headed to the Three Broomsticks for some lunch as they sat down and got some Butterbeer, twin fingers sat down as well.
In the office he made everyone sit down and then noticed that Harry was missing, he looked at everyone and then stared at Draco again.
Blood freakin wards that would only protect if the person it was meant to protect thought of the place as home as well as being loved by the family, otherwise it would do nothing in the protecting.
Once the flames had died down there now stood a very colourful phoenix who trilled up at them, making Otiz sigh as he picked him up in both hands.
"Professor he fell when he turned round" said Ginny smiling, playing the innocent game, which wasn't working.
Severus had left the room by then and headed straight to McGonagall's office and without waiting for a reply to his knock he walked straight in.
Harry looked at Draco and his friends while Otiz layed under the table bored, he so wanted to bite her but that would leave an awful taste in his mouth that would most likely stay there for forever.
Annoyed was one Madam Pomfrey, she knew she had to do her job and help the girl recovered but with what had been going on she just left the girl but did keep a eye on her just in case she did wake up.
"Professor sir, Hadrian is having a panic attack after what Weasley has said to him is it alright to take him to the medical wing?"
"I think it's time we went to Professor McGonagall about all of this and let her decide what to do with all of this evidence" and she gathered up all of the material and headed back out only to be met by over half of the Gryffindor's all wanting to go along.
"It's better than before, we can ask questions and answer them when called on" said Theo who didn't look up from his book he was reading.
When he saw nothing he wondered what happened and saw an angry Harry making him sigh, he nudged his elbow making Harry leave the room.
He shouldn't even be here! He should be back where he belongs! A collection freak will always be a freak! I can't believe I was once friends with the freak nothing came out of it!
"Draco darling please sit down we are still talking" said his mother making him sit in the spare chair.
The conniving, nefarious, disgusting old coot how could he do this to a poor boy of only twelve years old, he hadn't even begun his life and here he was trying to kill him before his life even began.
The students looked towards Percy Weasely for him to do something as she was now annoying them to no end, he took it upon himself to cast a silencing charm on her given everyone some piece and quite for the time being.
"Max get up will you! You have to go to school!" shouted an unknown voice this woke Ron up due to not knowing who was calling for someone he didn't know.
"Now I know why I couldn't find anything wrong with you when I always did a scan when you came to spend time within the Hospital Wing. Hadrian I'm sorry that I didn't notice about these Charms on you. I'm so so sorry" said Poppy as she burst into tears and leaned into Minerva.
"Well that was a very stupid idea if I say so myself" quittled Hermione to them looking up from a book she was reading.
Professor Snape, Flitwick, McGonagall, Sprout, Madam Hooch as well as Lockhart all stood there, Ron still had a hold on Harry's elbow tightly, Harry still had tears streaming down his face whimpering slightly, it hurt.
They walked into the Great Hall and everyone was silent until someone at the Gryffindor table said "look there is the new snake of Hogwarts whatever happened to the Great Harry Potter' and they laughed.
"Dad what's going on?" Otiz just growled, he wasn't happy and he now had bright first Red hair and his emerald green eyes where now glowing.
That child was never cared for until he was taken in by Professor Snape last summer, I thought your father and I brought you lot up to be respectful and not harm others! You young lady are grounded and I think most likely Professor Snape will go to the Ministry about you planning to murder the poor boy as he is his father now.
"Dad...." he was just loud enough to draw the attention of the Dursley's to him, right away Vernon's beady little eyes where drawn to him.
The next parchment will access your vaults and I will need another five drops and then the final parchment I will need a total of seven drops and this will bring out any health problems from when you were born up until now as well as any blocks, potions and or spells within your system.
Boy it was just annoying to think that your once familiar was now a small child of six years old! How in Merlin did that happen in the first place all Harry and Severus knew was one minute Harry was upset because if what happened with the Dursley's at the zoo.
"Hello Otiz are you having fun with Hadrian and Draco?" she asked as she stroked his fur making him purr.
Coming back into the room Severus now had his hair down and looked right at his son.... "the photo Hadrian..." was all he said but Harry didn't move, no way he was letting the picture out of his sight.
"I, Madam Bones have nothing to say besides Albus Dumbledore threatened me to be here, as you know no I'm a squib I have no magical powers I have no magic.
"Harry before we leave I would like to ask you to hold your tongue with Draco, I will admit he can be very bull headed with what he can say and do but just remember if you aren't sure of anything I will help you. Lucius is most likely telling Draco the same thing but more sternly" with that he grabbed hold of Harry, bringing him to his chest and called out Malfoy Manor.
Draco's birthday 5th July rolled around and he jumped on my one messy haired green eyed boy and he wasn't happy about it and so threw him off making Harry land with a thud, he had no idea why the boy would get up .... no wait due to his up brining Harry would normally wake early and Severus had tried to drill it into him that he didn't need to but he still did any way.
Tom along with Poppy and Severus waved their wands over Ron casting a spell that stopped him from talking about the Magical World for as long as he should live.
"Why did they have to be there?" "Why did they have to say those things? In front of all those people" and he cried again, making his magic burst out of control even more, this made Severus run towards his room wondering why in Merlin he had felt that.
They both knew who he was along with Lucius and Severus but no one said anything and carried in with their breakfast at the sound of the bell signalling the end of their first lesson everyone got up and left the Great Hall to go to their second lesson of he day.
Ten minutes into just sitting there relaxing with some coffee and a potions books, Otiz was in the land of nod and wasn't going to be waking anytime soon.
"It has come to the courts attention that one Albus Dumbledore has state claim over one Harry James Potter as his magical guardian but due to the paperwork given to said court, the person no longer exists!"
"Professor Lupin is Hadrian going to be ok?" asked a third year, he only smiled back at him and said nothing more, everyone turned to see Severus come back down, Otiz still glued to him.
Harry wanted to go away like he did for Easter but he knew that his father had many potions to make for the Hospital Wing and indulge in his own experiments.
"Sir be reasonable. Hadrian isn't here because you didn't ask for him" said Percy trying to calm the infuriated professor down.
"Hadrian calm down already and help me unpack, then we can have a look round the resort and then we can go for a swin and perhaps sign you up for some surfing and kayaking lessons" laughed Severus to his son as he watched him jump up and down in excitement.
"Ok professor I'll tell you everything that has happened to me but before I do could you calm down slightly your making Otiz upset and I don't want him to hurt you" said Harry stroking his fur to calm him down.
"Dad no more please I don't want them to know please" cried Harry more, "I don't want to be here, I want to go back to your chambers please no more dad" Severus just hugged him tightly and walked off.
He picks him up and right away he curled into the broad shoulder and was almost asleep before they hit the living room, thanking Merlin that the child was sleepy he took up place on the sofa and conjured a warm blanket and draped it over the child who was now almost asleep on his shoulder, his legs bracketing his own.
How do you feel? It couldn't of been one of the best days I have to admit but that was only once and hopefully we wont have to deal with them again for some time" and he sat on the bed.
He had wolf ears on his head that match his hair perfectly and a tail also of the same colour, Otiz had changed colour instead of his blue silky fur it was now orange and kept changing making him look like a rainbow!!
"Hadrian calm down for a few minutes, my stomach has to settle a bit more" said Draco who smiled weakly at his boyfriend but it didn't help calm Harry down much all he did was whine but stayed put for a moment until the others felt fine and they were off onto the next ride.
They talked and played games for the rest of the night, the three mentioned only came into the room to say good night and get something to eat, they didn't want to be anywhere near the Boy-who-lived-to-be-a-Slytherin.
He is in human form now but he is a hybrid familiar of the Japanese Bakeneko a cat demon and a Kitsune a fox demon.
"Severus what has brought you here? I thought you would be hiding in the potions lab brewing for Poppy" smiled Minerva with a slight smile on her face.
He crept upstairs after doing a "point me" spell which lead to a small, small bedroom, the last door which had many, many different locks on the outside of it with another "Alohomora" each one was undone.
"No I'm not telling you that Tom, you have to work it out" Harry just laughs making Otiz change into his teenage form.
"What the bloody hell happened to you too?" asked Ron as they both at down leaning on each other to try and stay awake.
Voldemort or Tom as he was now to be called by him told him about his childhood and his time within Hogwarts and how he made fail safe items to protect him so he couldn't die and he pointed out that he; Hadrian was one!
Harry finished quickly but not so quick he brought everything back up and headed over to the Floo with his father following behind him.
"Thank you Otiz, now Hadrian... get down from there!" said Severus noticing Harry was now hanging off the ceiling, some how getting his magic to work wonders yet again.
Flitwick looked at the animal and his eyes went wide seeing that it was an Occamy of all this but a very rare one due to her colouring.
How could everyone do that to him! He wanted his best friend back! Was that too much to ask! Was it!" she screamed the last part which then she was thrown back into a wall.
With that I hope you all enjoy your breakfast and I hope that you all enjoy your day and I do hope that we can all get along with eachother over the course of your time within Hogwarts" and he just clapped his hands and the food appeared on the tables.
It looked like his father regretted his choice of words to his mother to this day, it was the day that his mother stopped talking to him and started dating his father back in 6th year (A/N not sure) and then four years later he was born and then everything fifteen months later that Tom also regretted leaving poor Harry alone.
The three adults all look to him like he was stupid while Harry whimpered at the noise and angry that first came of Lucius and then Draco, ".........I want to go home" was all he said making Severus look at him and sighed.
As I asked in a previous chapter on Wattpad for a new name for Ron and any siblings and I have come up with his new name as well as his new family.
"Oh cut it out you two we know it was you, just give us the antidote" Hermione demanded to them but they just walked off dragging Harry with them.
"But she didn't do anyting wrong!" yelled Ron to them making Severus just look at him, a look that said 'carry on and I will personally talk to your parents and you will be exspelled' Ron shut his mouth.
"What are you three up to?" asked Draco has he had gone off to get them some drinks with the help of Blaise, Theo and Percy who seemed ok to him, a bit stuck up but other than that fine.
"The menace thought it would be funny to mix all my potion ingredients around and when I went to make one the bloody thing exploded on me, then he thought it would be funny and run out, transformed into what you see now.. that face Otiz will get you no where mister. You know the rules blow up the lab ten minutes in the corner" and Severus picked him up out of Lucius'arms and placed him in the corner.
"Hadrian I think it would be best to inform your father so then he can talk to them right away" said Marcus but before he could reply Tyki took flight.
They all headed out to the park, they had made a progress of going from the slow and careful rides as not to over whelm Harry as he had never done anything like this before and to gain more experience on them, today would be the ultimate test for the boy which he couldn't wait for he was practically jumping up and down even at almost 14 years old.
~relax young one I would never hurt the boy now, he is my potion master's son and I think of him as my son and with that the boy is now something along the line of grandson. I think of Draco the same as well~
"Well we were doing homework before you two fell asleep discussing going to Hogsmeade this weekend, uncle Sev said that Hadrian can go from now on and we were trying to wake him up but it wasn't working" said Draco as he headed to the dorm room with Otiz following holding Harry bride style.
"... something" said the twins going back and forth while wearing a hole in the Gryffindor common room floor, they were looking at their older brother who was reading a law book while also doing his duties.
Nodding Madam Malkin went to work while the three looked around in the Muggle clothing area, it was limited but at least they could get something different then just robes.
"I heard the commotion and I don't condone bullies as much as the next person... So Mister Snape let's get this elbow seen too" and with a flick of her wand she cast a diagnosis spell on his elbow.
Yes he was human but he rarely showed his true emotions, he had shown Harry more times then he could count but everyone else no, it was a side he didn't want to show anyone.
"I completely understand Tomas well let's finish this.." the door opened and two Aurors walked in and stood right behind Albus...
"As I was saying die to evidence that was giving to the court as well as Mister Harrington, Mister Potter has been adopted by Severus Snape on the 6th August last year" everyone looked to Harry who looked to be shaking in his seat making Severus hug him as well as Otiz.
Everyone in the hall looked as she left not saying a thing, it was a completely harmless prank s no one would really get told off, Otiz on the other hand fell off his seat laughing everyone ignored him and carried on eating.
Harry held the stuffie tightly and within no time he was sleeping, Severus brought him to his room, followed by Otiz of course and then went to bed he knew tomorrow was going to be a bad day for his son but with the older Weasely's, Otiz and himself protecting him along with is new friends he should be alright.
"So wand snapping and basically a slave? We don't condone that but if it's with just your family then I don't see any problem with it all with it. Do you have her wand?"
Otiz growled again only to make Tyki attack again bashing them with his wings over their heads, his claws scratching them and his beak biting their skin.
"Miss Granger please understand, your grades have slipped to that of a P, if you don't pick them up you could be expelled" said Minerva to her.
Draco looked and sure he notice her blue colouring and her wings hitting Hermione's face, "it is, I think I can get her into trouble, Granger I mean".
"Well as you know Lucius, Narcissa and even you Draco must of heard that Hadrian here was adopted by me and I would like you to be godparents to him, Hadrian has willing excepted this out come with some.... a lot of thought on this" said Severus to them and the turned to smile at Harry.
Severus took his son by his hand and led him out of the reptile house and out into the sun once again.
"Ok now that we are all up, this early morning, I think a nice warm breakfast with coffee and hot chocolate would be a good idea to start the day don't you think?" said Severus as he got out of bed leaving Harry there laughing.
"Ok now that you have something let's get Otiz sorted" laughed the man who was now holding a sleeping Otiz in his arms.
Otiz on his plate he had a small amount of raw meat as well as a bit of cooked meat, the adults were happy eating the seared salmon with roasted potatoes in a chive and butter dressing along with a freshly picked summer Caesar salad and that was just the starter.
Back in the hall Severus was waiting for a more formal answer to the questions that the teachers had asked them but he wasn't getting any.
As his new mother talked to Greta about his day his father informed them that he would be taking the girls home while, he Ron/ Max... whatever his name was went with his new mum to his weekly appointment.
The following day Hermione was full of herself she knew that she would get full marks and couldn't wait until her essays were given back to her at the end of the class what she wasn't expecting was annoyance from her teachers of all things!!
This made Harry very happy as he couldn't of asked for more, he had never had something like this before, not when he was with the Dursley's! He was so looking forward to this holiday!
Filius got off his stack of books and cast a Patronus and sent a message to Severus asking for him to meet the boys at the entrance to the Headmasters office.
Molly and Arthur nodded and then looked at their daughter, who was doing everything in her power to not looks at any of them.
His father came back in and announced that dinner was ready, Harry slowly got up and placed Otiz on the sofa and placed his blanket over him, and ruffled his hair again and then went into the kitchen to have his dinner, Otiz slept the whole way through.
"Severus the boy has to return to his relatives house when summer begins, the blood wards with protect him for any harm that may come to him, it's all for the greater good" the god damn twinkle was in his eyes again this meant he was up to something.
"It's ok Otiz we were worried about you but we can see that your fine now" said Harry making his finger make a pop as he took it out of the mouth and tapped him on the nose making him giggle.
Fred and George asked one of their female friends to go into the second year dorm room and look around to see if there was anything else they could use against Hermione, their friend was happy too as she was disgusted with what Hermione and Ron had done to poor Harry and she was happy that he finally had someone looking out fo him.
He walked right up to the front door of number 4 and whispered "Alohomora" and with a soft click he walked into the household.
"Oh you know that mummy loves the idea I'm going to be Harry's wife no matter what she says now before hand she would always say I would be" and she held her nose in the air like she was the freakin' queen of Sheba!!!
Your wand will be with me or your father at all times, you will not be allowed to use magic you will act as if you are a Squib. Do I make myself clear if I do hand over your wand and head upstairs to your room.
Don't let it worry you, ok I would rather have you like this, your calm self than the idiot that tried to attack my friend which I might add scared him senseless and with that I think you need to apologise to him if not I'm not talking to you for a week, plus no sweets and I can and I will restrict your raw meat supply".
Harry managed to get everyone to his room and then went out to give his father his shopping but when he got close enough he noticed the bottle of what he could make out was Fire Whiskey.
"Hadrian I don't think you will need them anymore, how about you take them off and see for yourself" .
"No Hadwin upsetted, no woom on bed for me so made human!" stated Otiz matter of factly, he then returned to play with the wolf and the snake.
I herby take away all of your own personal quills, you will be using one given to you by the teachers each and every lesson, you will be sitting up at the teacher's desk so then we can keep an eye on you, you will return all the money that you gained from selling the answers to your peers. You will have detention with me for the next three months and you WILL rewrite all your assignments.
They were looking at maps and were trying to make plans on where to go as the park had many different area's to explore and rides to go on but for now until lunch it was just exploring and trying to keep Harry and Otiz off things before the could tomorrow.
Everyone in the room either had tears in their eyes, was crying, seeing red with angry or wanted to spill their guts or a mixture of everything.
Harry placed him down on his feet and he ran over to the toy, once in hand the snitch flew off but no where as high and as fast as the normal snitch. This was fun!
I find it horrible grotesque in fact that one Albus Percival wulfric Brian Dumbledore could not be asked to check on Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape I think it's in my clients best interest that stays with Severus Tobias Snape and not go back with his ex relatives" and he sat back down.
"Hadrian I know I should of asked your permission to tell them but I would love for you to have them in your life, I would like them to be the go to people that I know that they are, also they were and still are your parents best friends, I don't want you to lose that.
Soon the adults had come out Tom was holding Severus' hand which made poor Severus blush at it all, they had now been dating for a good few months but only ever showed it to their friends and family and never at school, they didn't want the students to have a heart attack that Severus Tobias Snape had a heart even though they knew how protective he was of Harry.
He let the child go who started to climb up onto Remus' lap and then purred at finally being able to sit there, even if it wasn't Harry he was better, he smelt like an animal!
"Ah Miss Granger welcome back to the world of the living, let's just run these tests to make sure everything is fine with you and then you can go" she ran her tests taking longer, much longer than normal to run her tests just so then she could waste her time.
He was meant to marry my sister! Now look at the freak he cowering in the room ferrets arms like he's a baby! I was meant to be his best friend and then after our schooling he was meant to give me half of his money and the other half to Ginny!
"Look Jessie, whittle Maxie hit his port whittle nose" said one of them to her sister, making her laugh.
"Remmy, Remus did you remember to take you potion?" but he was flung aside and ran off into the woods.
"Ouch what was that for you stupid bird!" screamed Ginny making mostly everyone cover their ears as she had screeched.
After leaving Minerva's office and practically dragging her daughter to the Floo system in the Great Hall making sure as they went everyone were in classes or studying, she threw in some Floo powder, making sure she had hold of her daughter and calling out for the Burrow.
In the shop Molly was able to pick out some nice meat for dinner and a few bland vegetables for Ginny's, she paid for them and next they headed for the Ministry.
"Well I hear that their are two birthdays coming up soon and we thought to take these two boys out for their birthdays as on is in June and the other is in July and we thought we could go on holiday between said birthdays" said Tom as Severus smiled a genuine smile.
It had been three weeks since Otiz had transformed into a teenager and he made doubly sure that he always stayed like that to make sure that the Stooges couldn't get to Harry at all.
"That Hadrian was some impressive magic, I have been trying to break them now for over two hours but they were budging one bit, that silencing and locking charm worked so well in fact that I think we will have to talk about that more at a later date but for now...
"Oh hello there Harry or is it Hadrian now? No it's Hadrian now" she smiled at him and he smiled back to her.
This enraged Albus how dare the brat ignore him! He was Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, he is not to be ignored!!
"Ru'et" squealed Otiz as he was given them who smiled a thank you and the started playing with them on Harry's lap, he was so not moving for the time being.
"Well I can't see anything wrong with it all!" said Ron to his friend making his sister nod agreeing with him on it all, she saw nothing wrong at all.
"Miss Granger I have checked these items and each and every item has your particular magical signature all over them, so I would like the truth!"
Once Harry had stepped foot into the castle it self he changed back into his teenage form and picked him up bridal style and headed straight to the Slytherin common room.
"Max we have gone through this everyday, I'm you mother remember?" she said to him making him shake his head at her.
Screw the paperwork! It meant nothing to him, it must of been forged by the bat that was they only reasonable explanation he didn't care that it had the Ministry logo and stamp on it as well as Gringotts all that mattered was that he got his hands back in the brat!
"Well if it isn't our "dear" little nephew, Pet look who it is. Harry has come back to "us" at long last" said Vernon, making Harry stay where he was.
Poppy nodded to him and went over to collected Claiming Draught and to inform Severus what happened.
If you hadn't of went after a stupid rat I would of been better off! I've only just gotten back on track I still have to take a nutrition potion twice a day compared to four times it took weeks maybe months for me to eat more than four spoonfuls of food at any given time" by the end of it all he was screaming at Sirius his magic crackling around him setting Otiz on edge.
In the living room Severus was talking to Otiz who was sitting in Harry's chair while Severus sat in his.
"Miss Granger is that true? you have been trying to steal someone's familiar? that is unheard of, you could kill the familiar as well as the person they are bonded to
"Ok now what is he?" asked Draco holding onto the now animal Otiz for protection, he had never seen an animal like this.
"Otiz don't he's not worth it" said Draco and Blaise together, Pansy just got out of her seat and hugged Harry only for him to flinch, but settled down after a few seconds.
"You have no right to say his name! Change his office back right now, you are not the Headmaster! He is! Not you! Get out of here!"
"Why thank you Mister Nott, I have been well, daddy has wrote an article about Hadrian and how young Weasley has been cast out of the magical world.. do you where he went?"
"Poppy its Hadrian, Fawkes is a fire phoenix and this one is a rainbow phoenix and its Hadrian it looks likes he has tapped into his Anim..." he was cut off when the doors banged open to reveal an out of breath Severus Snape and one Tom Sötétség aka Tom Riddle.
"Oh look the traitor of the light now with the snakes" said Hermione putting her nose in the air like she as trying to get some clean air into her lungs.
Severus had rented a private apartment in Kihei on the south west coast which had beautiful beaches, Harry couldn't wait to go swimming and try surfing, snorkeling and kayaking.
Harry sat bolt right up and sneered "well lets just say my relatives are monsters, Ron was my first ever friend in my life, I knew nothing of the Wizarding World, I didn't know I was famous!! Someone treated me as just Harry for the first time in my life. You just seemed so up your arse that I didn't want to know you, you remined me of them!"
He just turned round to Harry and his friends who where shocked to say the least and took them to Charms saying nothing of how and why he was like this now.
"Stop!" they both finished together making everyone that's within the common room all nod in agreement with the twins.
"So our own Harry Potter is no longer a lion but a slimy snake at that. What the hell happened Harry? Why have you gone over to them and not stay with us?" asked one of the sixth years by the name of Yasmin Cruise she had black hair with purple tips to it and blue eyes, while her brother Jacob had black hair with red tips to it with green eyes, just sneered at the boy in front of him from next to his sister.
Harry came back wearing a black Reebok top with blue jeans and black converse trainers, and when he saw Otiz in the same outfit only reverse he had to slap himself, of course Otiz would dress like this when they went out it was to say 'my familiar I will protect'.
"Oh I have to go and look at Gladrags" said Pansy as she tried to drag Draco off only for Otiz to growl at her.
I opened the door to see Harry tangled in the blankets covered in sweat, I gently shook the boy. "Harry? It's alright. Wake up, you're having a bad dream"
In the end they walked out with four children's robes all of white and blue to match his fur colour with a hint of silver throughout.
Harry just nodded to him and slowly got up only for both Otiz and Severus to notice that his stuffed animals were alive somehow.
"Don't get into trouble, otherwise I'll have you tell Professor McGonagall and she will give you detention with Flitch... again" said Percy as he got up when he noticed two first years coming into the room after cerfew.
"Arthur I can't believe she would do something like that and then threaten to kill poor Hadrian, he's such a sweet lad and all, I thought we raised her right why did she turn out like this?" and she burst into tears.
"Oh Merlin really dad you didn't tell me that Malfoy was here, is this the reason why you came and got me in the first place?" he asked while Severus headed towards the kitchen to get them something to drink, acting like he didn't know what he was talking about, so Harry went and sat down in what he had claimed as 'his spot', a light brown chair that had a Gryffindor blanket and cushion on it as well as two stuffed owls, a white one and a black one.
"Oh Harry why didn't you say anything?" this made the boy just shugg and hide behind his knees as a defence, to everything that was going around him.
Otiz transformed into his teenage form and leaned against the sofa and smiled to them knowing what had happened.
"Madam we are after some children's robes for young Otiz here but he is also a familiar to my son Hadrian here, who I think you know as Harry Potter".
It was the last night before going back to school for the new year and Harry was apprehensive as tonight was dinner with the Malfoy family... yes he had spent a year with Draco finally becoming a somewhat friend to him but he still wasn't sure of Lucius, Narcissa was fine she loved him as a second son which helped Harry out alot.
"Quite now if you would let me continue. Yes this has never happened before but due to what has happened over the past few months, this person has been adopted and their parents would like them to be resorted so I would ask one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape to come up" and so Harry stood up and walked to where the sorting hat now lay.
Draco looked down and sure enough Harry was out cold on his shoulder snoring lightly as he slept, Otiz had made himself small enough to fit on his lap who was also asleep, Draco brought Harry to him so that he was stretched out on the sofa with his head in his lap as he talked to Blaise about their visit to Hogsmeade tomorrow morning.
'Thats strange he never cries, at least not in front of anyone that is' thought the owner of the voice as he walked further in.
They spent the rest of the night on the sofa under a cashmere blanket wrapped in each others arms, Tom feeding him chocolates every so often, who knew the man loved chocolate so much, Tom though he would have to stock up on the chocolate if he wanted Severus in a good mood.
Arthur was waiting outside for them as they came in, he brought them into the office that was being used for this whole thing, Cornelius was waiting for them.
"So Poppy hasn't told you yet? well I was informed just recently that Mr. Potter's household currently at the residents of 4 Privet Driver is unsafe for the child. Albus he's a young boy, a second year at that, he has been abused since he was three years of age......" Severus replied sadly. Dumbledore could only stare back incomplete shock "Severus my boy, I'm afraid that I'm aware of this already. It is only safe that he is with fami-" Albus was soon interrupted by Severus' uncontrolled temper. "Albus how dare you! He has had way to many near death experiences just in the past two years from his uncle's beatings! If you won't take him out of that damn household I will remove him myself. I am not bluffing. Good evening, Headmaster" and with that Severus stormed out of Dumbledore's office, only to leave behind a very shocked blue eyed man.
"Hadrian is reading his potion book that we got him at Diagon Alley when we went, he's been reading ahead which I think is really going to help him now, he's really listened to what we have told him and he's growing into a fine young man" and Tom kissed Severus's head making said man blush.
"What is that thing?" shouted Ginny so then everyone could hear her, this made Harry lean into Draco and made Otiz growl.
"Welcome Lupin to my home, sit down while I put our little one to bed and put away everything, won't take a minute" said Severus as Lupin sat down and Harry disappeared into his room not wanting to left with a complete stranger.
"Mister Weasley, Miss Granger and Mister Malfoy I would like all three of you to come to my quarters after dinner tomorrow so then I can explain everything to your about Hadrian here. Now if you all don't mind classes are about to start so off you go" and Severus left after he managed to get Harry from behind him.
He was in History of Magic and was getting bored like the rest of them were, Binns talking about different parts of the Goblin War was enough to drive anyone to sleep, when it happened.
As it passed over to Tom or Tomas as he was calling himself at that moment was still shocked at what the thirteen year old boy had gone threw yes he tried to kill him when he was only fifteen months old but still this was over kill!
"Headmaster I will say this one last time Hardian is my son the Ministry has this on file as will as the Goblin's at Gringotts, my son will return home with me".
Molly and Arthur looked like they were discussing her punishment, once they had decided it they looked at Fudge.
"What he's in Slytherin for Merlin's sake James and Lilly would be rolling in their graves knowing that their son, their only son was in the snake pit but with Snivellus of all things, Remmy Snivellus all of things come on!"
"Fine" was all he replied back with and jumped into the air and landed on the bench with such grace it was unheard of.
"Hey 'mione what's wrong?" asked Ron as he sat down next to her but she didn't hear him as she was still screaming into the cushion, Ginny saw this and slowly pulled the cushion away from her and when they both saw her crying they admitly wanted to ask her what was wrong.
