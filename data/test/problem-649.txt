He awoke with his head at an odd angle, not quite lying flat. He opened his to see Draco above him. Clearly whilst he had been asleep, Draco had come down, and was now sitting on the sofa with Harry’s head on his lap. Harry shifted so he was more comfortable, made sure Teddy was still asleep, and then fell back to sleep himself. Despite how scared he was to face Pansy and Blaise that morning, Draco’s hand in his hair made him feel at peace. Soon enough, Teddy woke up and started fussing for his breakfast. Draco rose, and took the baby into the kitchen, letting Harry sleep. Harry protested but ultimately was happy to take the extra time off.
It was nice, thought Harry, to talk as if they were normal teenagers on the cusp of adulthood, rather than war veterans who had seen things most adults could never imagine. He felt normal, for once. He revelled in it, the warmth of the fire on his skin combining with the warmth of the firewhiskey in his blood, combining with the warmth of knowing he was safe, and amongst friends. The whiskey soon went to his head a bit, and he could tell the same had happened to everyone. Ron and ‘mione were being a bit too affectionate for proper company, but no one cared. Parkinson and Zabini were chatting about something, Harry couldn’t quite tell from the other side of the fire, but he could see Parkinson giggling a lot.
“oh dear boys, is there a domestic you need me to preside over?” Pansy giggled, drunk. Draco just took her hand and yanked her into the pensive. Unable to watch it again, Harry stood in the attic and wrung his hands.
He sat on his bed, fretting over the strain this weekend would put on his recovering body as he watched Blaise drag himself out of bed and start to get dressed. That was another problem- what to wear. He had transfigured himself all sorts of clothes the night before, but he felt so distinctly out of his comfort zone in anything that wasn’t robes or formal wear- they were all he was used to. That was another side effect of the war- he had emerged with copious amounts of anxiety. He had researched it somewhat, and was surprised to see that the muggles knew more about it than the wizards.
Then he heard footsteps, and knew it would be the prefect on duty.
“what did he say about me?”
“Ron’s mum. You must have met her when Ron took you to get some more suitable clothes” Sirius said and Draco remembered the warm and motherly woman at Ron’s house, who seemed so overflowing with love, a stark contrast to Draco’s mother. He adored her, but her capacity for love was limited at the best of times. She showed her love though gift giving and quality time rather than hugs and kisses and Molly seemed to be the opposite.
“There’s a copse of apple trees at the very outskirts, and the recipe is a Lupin family recipe passed down for generations. I love Remus purely because he introduced me to this, and gave me permission to make it myself, on the condition it is kept for us and ours, and never sold for profit.”
Theo had a steady girlfriend of Daphne Greengrass, a girl whose father was some horribly rich, horribly prejudiced tory MP that Draco and his friends hated but who their parents loved. Daphne was nice enough, though. Theo doted on her, and they made each other happy.
He walked into his room, and Harry was lounging on the bed, reading one of Draco’s books. It hit Draco like a ball to the stomach that all he wanted was to crawl into bed next to Harry and have Harry hold him.
“oh please, I much prefer you like this” she purred. Harry blushed, bravado lost now that he was quite literally naked and vulnerable, and he left, all but running upstairs. In typical Harry Potter-style luck, as he ran up the stairs, a very hungover Draco was stumbling down them, and they crashed into each other, falling so that Draco fell back-first on the steps and Harry was on top of him. “shit sorry Draco” said harry, scrambling up before holding out a hand to help Draco up. Draco just lay on the stairs, blushing pink and raking his eyes over Harry’s scantily clad form. “well, your friends are in the kitchen, I’m gonna get dressed and then I’ll make breakfast, yeah?” Draco nodded mutely, and Harry just ran past him in his embarrassment.
“Hermione will love you, mate. You look like a tasty morsel” Harry laughed.
“Draco, oh Draco I’m sorry, I’m so, so fucking sorry” he says, over and over and over again. I tilt my face to the ceiling, blinking back tears.
“Honestly, Harry. I did not expect this level of immaturity from you. We keep talking about communication.” Hermione interjected.
“it is with regret that I stand here before you all to tell you that Hogwarts failed you, and your parents, and their parents before them. While as a school and faculty we were arguably on the ‘right’ side of the war, we fed the prejudices of the opposition with our lack of thorough education.”
The lights are on but no one’s home
“You’re doing the right thing, you know? And Harry just keeps lashing out at everyone now, so whilst I know it's hard you need to try and not take it personally. I heard Remus go in to talk to him, which hopefully will knock some sense into him” Draco said, reaching for his own tea, and passing Hermione the biscuits.
No escape from reality
As he pondered this, Harry’s words swam around his head. God, Harry would hate him so much more if Andi was introduced, as it would be something Draco had in common with Sirius that Harry didn’t. Well, Draco decided, Harry would just have to deal with it. He was nearly twenty now, that was old enough to move beyond feelings of jealousy that revolved around parental figures. and, thought Draco petulantly, Harry had had Sirius and Remus his whole life, Draco had only had them for a few weeks.
Harry could already see he and Ron reflected in another two boys- Dean and Seamus. They gravitated towards each other in between drills, and when they went to the gym for the second hour of their practice, they spotted each other, much like Harry and Ron did. This was comforting, and Harry hoped that the four of them would become friends.
“what is it, anyway?” Malfoy asked, looking slightly horrified that Harry was so comfortable around the snake.
“shut up Blaise”
“But you know what they did to Sirius” Harry said weakly.
“Draco.” Replies Draco curtly. Quite rudely, even, if Draco cared about being rude, which he didn’t. He was so used to being mocked for his name, and he knew how mean rugby boys could be.
He will slay you with his tongue
“I must say Potter, I am enjoying your company much more than I had expected to. I’m sure Pansy and I will join you. Bear in mind though, Pansy needs upwards of two hours to get ready.”
Oh you got plans?
“Hey. Do you mind if I actually sleep on the edge? I might panic if I wake up in an unfamiliar bed and there’s no easy way out, sorry” Harry said with a sheepish smile. Draco nodded and went to get out of bed but Harry just rolled over him. Not to be pathetic, but Draco thought he could have died in that moment. Harry then snuggled under the covers like a child and it was just so endearing, Draco thought he might combust.
“I can’t help but think that is why your mother sent you to us” Sirius said, his tone growing warmer. Draco looked at him in confusion.
“so I have been told” Harry responded wryly, bending down and putting Teddy in his crib
“Yeah, mate. Was hilarious. I don’t know what you were drinking last night but maybe a little less heavy next time, yeah?” Ron said, laughing.
The outside world seems so far away in this moment, but I know that its lurking out there, ready to destroy my happiness with a click of its fingers. I burrow impossibly closer to Potter, letting his deep breathing wash over me like a soothing balm. Maybe, just maybe, it won’t be so bad.
He could not, however, say this to them, he simply nodded, settled onto the floor by Blaise’s bed and held out a hand for a glass from which to drink.
“if you consider vomit sauce then I guess you could say that”
“Ron says they’re in King George. You can take us there, right? And you're staying for the party, yeah?”
Draco watched the Gryffindors now, huddled together. Their easy closeness made his chest tighten. Slytherins didn’t cultivate friendships like that. Their parents’ politics and potential arranged marriages and the emphasis on self-preservation severely impaired the ability to form strong, stable friendships. His resentment was a foul form of jealousy, and he didn’t know how she was going to survive this weekend, especially when he saw the tenderness with which Weasley helped Granger adjust her backpack straps, and the small smile on Potter’s face as he watched them; no trace of jealousy to be seen. He didn’t understand. It should be messy. Why couldn’t they be messy, so Draco could feel a tiny bit better about his own mess.
“Mate, honestly its hardly a massive deal. We weren’t going to let you get bollocked on the first weekend of the year. Anyway, carrying you up those stairs was easier than rugby training” replied Harry, grinning.
“you’re right, ‘mione. Sorry. You know what I’m like”
Then again, that was only the year thirteens of last year, who were all gone. None of the members from Draco’s own year had been quite so cruel. Come to think of it, they weren’t so homophobic either. He can’t remember any of the ones from his year, and even the current year thirteen rugby boys, being bigoted at all.
“it really is very kind of you to take Draco in” Pansy had said with shocking sincerity as they entered the nursery.
“mm... Draco? It's the middle of the night, what's up?”
He was too drunk to deal with this, and all he wanted was to find Draco and be held by Draco and be kissed by Draco. All he wanted was Draco, and he wasn’t going to let Blaise ruin that, he just didn’t know how to fix this. Draco’s dep-seated insecurities meant that he was unlikely to believe it if Harry just told him, Harry would need to show him somehow. Through his drunk haze, he remembered the cracked and decrepit pensive he had stored in the attic of Grimmauld, that had previously stood on a pedestal in the centre of the library.
Watch out here I come
Oh lei oh lai oh lord, oh lei, oh lai, oh lei oh lord,
“ughhh you spent your new year’s watching me vomit into a toilet god Harry I’m so sorry”
They found seats right at the front, and Draco sat in between Hermione and Luna. Hermione immediately pulled out a book, something about a Chinese Empress, and Luna chatted his ear off about her wild assortment of pets, many of which he suspected to be bordering on illegal, but the stories are terribly entertaining. Draco found that in spite of himself, he was having fun. He had thought he would feel bitter jealousy towards Luna, but he could see how clearly, she didn’t see Harry in any way other than platonic, and after she had exhausted her pet stories, she moved on to fawning over a girl she had a crush on. Draco didn’t miss the looks she kept sneaking at Ginny, and resolved to ask Harry and Ron about it when he could.
“That was weird, mate” said Ron once they were ascending the stairs to their room.
When he next emerged in the kitchen, Pansy was bouncing Teddy on her lap, Draco had his head on the table and Blaise was watching in mild amusement.
Draco thought wistfully of three course French meals at the manor as he watched the golden trio begin to boil some water for their noodles. He wandered over to Pansy, and suddenly resented the fact that they weren’t close enough for him to just hug her for no reason. It must be nice, he thought, to have such physical affection so readily available and freely given. Pansy held his hand this morning, but it never went beyond that. Today had shown the massive differences in the two groups. The Gryffindors had such a strong friendship. Draco had always believed such reliance on others to be a weakness- his father had spent Draco’s childhood drilling this into him- but watching them now, he wasn’t sure how Draco had ever believed this. Loneliness felt like the weakness now, having no-one to turn to was a testament to the weakness of Draco’s character. He had Pansy, at least, in some way, but not the way the holy trinity had each other.
“Right. It all starts with this girl, Cho Chang. She went to my school, and I started dating her like, near the start of year ten. Through her, I meet Cedric because he was always at the parties, she would take me to, and he and I became friends. We would chat sometimes online, we both liked rugby- I played, but he watched it with his dad as like a bonding thing- and he was mates with my girlfriend, so we spent a lot of time together.
For the first time that half term, Harry thought back to what Hermione had said about Draco liking him. He decided to test her theory in the coming weeks, just to see where he stood with Draco. Summoning all the seductive confidence he had learned from Sirius, he draped his arm along Draco’s shoulders, just resting here. He felt Draco tense further and then relax, sighing softly. Harry grinned inwardly. He loved the chase, and he had decided to put his best into seducing Draco. Subtly, of course, especially as they were going back to school soon.
“Hermione always says I’m like toothless” Harry says when they first meet the dragon.
They continued the fake relationship act a little too long, with a little too much intensity, but it was just so nice to kiss someone, and after what must have been over a bottle each of champagne, Harry awoke the next morning to Luna in his bed, very scantily clad. Oh shit.
“I don’t need your pity, Harry. You don’t have to like me, it’s fine” said Draco gently, lowering a hand to run it through Pansy’s hair.
“Lovely to meet you my dear” she said as she stepped back, keeping her hands on Draco’s shoulders. “You must be eating more! You are so skinny! Sit, sit please”
songs in this chapter are
She had thick rimmed glasses on, and Draco found her strikingly pretty. She threw her arms around Sirius's neck, and then immediately started talking a mile a minute about her school studies as she waved goodbye to her parents and got into the car.
Pansy linked her arm through his as they made their way down the hall, before selecting what Harry called his ‘Slytherin shirt’- the deep green one with the embroidered snakes.
Now out of the shower, Harry put on his ‘pull’ playlist, and began to get dressed. The clothes were nothing too special; his best jeans, a tight Beatles t shirt and his trusty converse. It was the face and hair that Dean had meant when he told Harry to dress ‘properly’. Harry had shown Dean when taking Dean to his first gay bar to introduce him to his new community. His favourite song came on, and he got to work.
Harry was uncomfortably reminded of his parent’s funerals. He has only vague memories of both; tall men carrying him around- they must have been Sirius and Remus- strange adults crying and holding him; feeling utterly overwhelmed.
Draco felt the wood slide through his gloved hands and into the ground and he marvelled at the strength of the man before him.
He slides off Draco’s bed, puts his hat back on and puts a heavy hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“I- thank you, Sirius” was all he could muster up, and Remus nodded at him, before announcing that he was off to make lunch. Sirius then fished his cane up from where it was lying on the floor, and used it to push himself up to standing.
‘you’ve walked out a hundred times how was I supposed to know this time that you wouldn’t come, that you wouldn’t come home” Harry trailed off here, despite having barely started. It was clear he was too overcome to continue. Another shock in what had become a very surprising day for Draco, he heard Luna’s voice, clear and light, pick up where he had left off.
“Fuck me, Draco. Your room is huge.” Harry said, staring around in wonderment.
At nineteen, he was being forced to face the fact that maybe, just maybe, his worldview was wrong. It wasn't a comfortable feeling.
The next thing he was aware of was a knock on the door. When he opened it, he saw that he had been lost in his book for hours; darkness had fallen, and stars twinkled and winked at him from overhead. Harry was stood at the door, looking more put together than Draco had ever seen him. He was in a baggy short-sleeve button down and jeans that looked to be older than Draco’s father.
“There are certain things a child shouldn’t know about their parents, but you are nearly a man now, and so I am going to tell you something. It might upset you, but know that I never want to hurt you.
“I mean, I don’t have to if you don’t want me to anymore” Draco said, looking at his fingers twisting in his lap.
“You’re a funny man, Peterson” Harry says, and Peterson’s brown furrows deeply. It’s not an attractive look, if I do say so myself.
They sat pressed against each other on the sofa, the little dvd machine balanced on Draco’s legs. At some point, she laid her head on his shoulder and he felt all warm at the proof that she genuinely liked him and felt comfortable with him. After the film ended they chatted for a bit, and Hermione drew her head off his shoulder but immediately threw her legs over his thighs and he was once again left to marvel at how quickly she had taken to him, and what a lovely feeling it was.
Draco flushed again. He knew little about Harry’s background, but he knew he didn’t come from the kind of money Draco did.
“Draco, I-” Harry tried to say, looking pained.
In order to stake a claim, one must announce it in the Slytherin common room, standing upon the largest snake carved into the stone floor of the dungeons. You must then announce to the room ‘I hereby stake my claim upon’ and then the person’s name. the magic imbued in our dungeon by Salazar himself then creates a sort of bond between the two. This is not like an engagement, and does not have to lead to an engagement, however it does stop the person you have claimed from being able to enter into a magical engagement with anyone else.
“it's not okay, Ron told me how stressed you were, I'm sorry. I just couldn’t face it. I know people pity me, but seeing it so clearly on your face made it hard, I'm sorry. I want to spend every day with you from now on” Harry breathed, before kissing Draco so hard Draco’s knees went weak.
“oh dray” sympathised Pansy. Harry didn’t know how to feel, he thought Draco had a surface level physical attraction to him, he didn’t realise it went deeper. He wouldn’t have joined the teasing otherwise. He felt a bit sick as he remembers how he had poked fun too. He felt even more sick when he realised what this meant. Did he even like Draco? He wasn’t sure. He was attractive, but he had been such a prick at school and a few weeks ago. Harry would need more proof that he had really changed.
“of course not my boy. Of course not.”
“Oh! Hey Draco. Didn’t see you there” he heard Harry yell over to the corner where Draco had been not-so-subtly watching them. Harry was still draped across Ron’s lap, and Ron was just laying back on the sofa, eyes closed, basking in the first Friday night back.
“uhhhh” he said elegantly, faced with Harry and Ron blocking his doorway with their tall and broad bodies.
“Harry! So lovely to see you!” He greets, ignoring me entirely.
“I want lots of things, Harry. Right now, I want to be there for you the way you’re always there for me”
Draco collapsed into the chair near Harry, staring into space and thinking about how empty his room would feel without Harry and his music, dancing and cheeriness. He felt a coarse finger brush his hand, and heard a hoarse voice, “Malfoy, can you please get Luna, and my iPod, its tucked under my Pillow.” Draco nodded, and turned to leave but was stopped by the rasping voice again; “oh Malfoy, come back too yea? And bring me some treacle tart if you can”. Draco smiled at the fact that whilst Harry may have wanted Luna, he wanted Draco too. He strode off into the castle, wondering where in the hell he would find treacle tart at 3:37 on a Sunday afternoon.
Draco loved it, he felt very at home here already. It had a small library, which was romantically cosy and had been a great hideaway in the winter months of GSCE when Draco escaped here to avoid the madness of fourteen- and fifteen-year-old boys. The common room also had a small kitchenette- a privilege reserved for sixth formers, which Draco awaited taking advantage of this year and the next.
It was Sirius. Sirius never called unless it was important. Shit.
“Do you want to do something tomorrow? We can talk properly in person, I can help you plan how to tell your mother, or we can do something to take your mind off it.” Harry said.
They had an early dinner, and Draco suspected it was because his mum was allowing, he and Harry an uninterrupted evening. He both hated and loved her for it.
“Charlie, Bill, this is Draco, Sirius’ cousin” Remus said.
“Harry, my boy, just before you go, I have something to show you. It won’t take long. Ronald, you may join us” she said in her severe manner, though her eyes were soft. She led them through to the headmaster’s office, and inside it.
He immediately felt fear wash over him as they all turned to stare at the intruders.
After a very stressful two hours, Draco is preparing drinks in the kitchen whilst Harry waits by the floo, Teddy giggling in his arms. The flames flash green and Pansy and Blaise step out. “my, my Potter” Pansy drawled. “you look positively edible”
After long agonising hours, they get to take Teddy home again. Harry refused to leave his nursery, and Draco came back from making a cup of tea to see Harry had fallen asleep in the armchair, as he had a penchant for doing. Draco worried for the state of his neck and transfigured a bed, before bending down to take Harry under the shoulders and drag him over to the bed. He eased him between the covers, and stood to go, but a warm, dark hand shot out to hold his wrist, then tugged, pulling him onto the bed. Draco sighed, easing off his shoes and slipping between the covers next to Harry, who had already fallen back to sleep. Draco sat up and sipped his tea, entranced by how vulnerable Harry’s face looked in sleep.
“There’s summat up with him” Remus murmured to Sirius, who nodded, brow furrowed in thought. Draco kept eating, eyes on the day-old newspaper on the table next to him, pretending he couldn’t hear.
He was awoken as promised the next morning, and opened bleary sleep-blurry eyes to the figure of Harry standing over his bed.
By the end of his story, Harry was looking at Draco’s ceiling, rather than Draco himself. Desperate to have Harry’s attention back, Draco said “well he sounds like a rat bastard. You’re better off without him”
Draco groaned again, unable to voice how embarrassed and still sick he felt. Harry laughed again; a belly laugh that made Draco feel warm inside.
“I have a ring! If you don’t like it we can change it, of course, but I had it designed for you? I asked Narcissa what you might want on a family crest and then I thought about what I might want and I sort of incorporated them and-“
as it turned out, Harry and Draco and Luna were the only three eighth years to have signed up for classical civilisation. Harry and Luna walked to the classroom, hand in hand, and went in to see Draco already seated. Harry and Luna sat, still holding hands, Draco saw, causing a strange twist in his gut. Their professor came in shortly after, reminding Harry painfully of Lupin with his brown and bookish clothes and air of organised Chaos. He presented the three students with their own copy of the Iliad, and began to explain the context of the Trojan war.
“I hate portkey travel” grumbled Weasley from where he had fallen on the ground.
Draco groaned. His head felt like it had been sat on by a hippogriff, and Harry was way too chipper for early in the morning. He said as much, his tongue feeling like lead in his mouth.
Harry smirked and waved his hands. Soon a smooth jazz-like sound filled the room and Harry and Dean started to roll their bodies laughing and dancing together. Then Harry started to sing.
The word ‘round de town
“There was one on Netflix though, called La Vie Scolaire, that I liked the look of. It's about students at a school in the cite, so they are all working class, living on the estate. Sound good?”
“I would never” Draco says, too intrigued to worry about why it would be a secret.
After the arrival of his Hogwarts letter, where he and all those in his year were invited back to complete their NEWTs, Harry, with encouragement from those near and dear, decided to travel for a month before returning to school. Not only had he never had a childhood, his teenage years were ripped away from him by a murderous maniac, and Harry wished to experience at least some of what he heard about in the songs broadcast across London.
At some point after breakfast, Ginny and Harry passed Draco off to Remus and wandered off somewhere, and Draco didn't see them again until lunch. They came in not looking at each other, both of them stiff and uncomfortable, and they sat as far away from each other as was possible given that there were only five of them at the table. Harry left the minute he finished eating, Ginny hot on his heels. Once they’d both gone, Sirius and Remus shared a look that told Draco that this was an ongoing saga between the two of them.
“It’s Harry’s day off” Sirius said, but the bags under his eyes and the paleness of his face made Draco believe that Harry was missing because of the dinner the night before.
One small issue is that a lot of archaic magic relies heavily upon intent, and as my claim was staked with revenge and anger in my heart rather than a heartfelt wish to court Potter until he swooned at my feet, I am of the belief that this affected the nature of our bond. I have a chest full of scars as proof of this, in fact. I believe that the tenuous bond between us, borne of resentment, led to Potter using such a torturous spell. Perhaps, though, I just believe this because I struggle to think of Potter as being capable of such darkness.
“Right, so I would say ‘never have I ever...’ and then if you have done the thing I've said, you drink. I have to say something I haven't done, though. For example, never have I ever done muggle drugs, and yes so if you have, you drink, great, everyone gets it.”
“your portkeys are scheduled to leave once you have all touched them together. Good luck.” Within minutes, the hall was empty.
Teddy then began to get fussy, so they apparated home so he could have his nap. The afternoon, and the rest of their days together that week passed in amicable monotony. Harry had decided that Draco’s first day had overwhelmed him somewhat, so the other days that week were spent playing in the garden, watching muggle cartoons, and some disastrous baking attempts on Draco’s behalf. Sunday rolled around, and to his astonishment, Andy arrived arm in arm with Narcissa for their tea and cake. No Draco though. Perhaps this was to become an old ladies’ affair, thought Harry, amused. Molly would be next. “Harry, I hope you don’t mind that I bought Cissa, there is always more than enough food.” Said Andy, scooping Teddy up and placing a smacking kiss on his cheek. “of course not. Its orange polenta cake today” said Harry, getting plates out. He then took some photos of the two women holding a smiling, dribbling Teddy before trying to feed him his dinner, without much luck. The three talked, chatting. Harry told them about his and Draco’s shopping excursion, and they told him about their childhood in that very house. Harry loved it. He felt a bit like an old woman himself, given that all his time was spent baking and staying at home with a baby, but something about the feeling made him feel safe. Soft embers glowed in his heart as he was accepted into the fold of easy, relaxed adulthood. “you’re terribly mature for your age, Harry. And I don’t just mean the war. Draco seems aged by the war but he’s still a teenage boy. He fusses over his clothes and hair. He reads awful action novels, he protests when I ask him to do the housework but you’re more, wise than that, I guess I would say” said Narcissa, somehow voicing his inner monologue. He smiled. He was glad he wasn’t the quick-tempered boy he had been, yet he was unsure how he had changed so much in less than a year, and Narcissa was right. It was more than the war. Perhaps it was the scale of loss, harry thought. He had come to appreciate the more important things in life at a younger age because he had lost so many of them.
“Pansy, you can stay here with us, for as long as you like. You’re always welcome here.”
And, to his eternal joy, he and Harry chatted almost every day. He had called Harry that first night back to explain what had happened between his mum and Lucius (he wasn’t Father anymore, just Lucius), and now he texted Harry every time he broke one of Lucius’ inane rules, and Harry would respond with teasing encouragement.
“please, call me Harry, both of you.” Said Harry as he took his place, settling Teddy into his lap. “yea Draco, I made it. I started baking after the war because I found it relaxing, and now it’s what I spend most of my time doing.” He explained.
For someone who had been at an English boarding school since age eleven, harry was unsure how Seamus managed to be so Irish. ‘Sure, it’ll be grand’ felt like a line from Father Ted. Harry loved it though- Seamus’ unabashed foreignness helped him feel more at ease with his own.
He dressed hurriedly, and stumbled out of the tent and into the tree line at the edge of the field. He collapsed against the sturdy trunk of a Rowan and tried to hold the tears back. He didn’t know how long he had been there when he saw Potter slowly making his way through the trees towards him. Fuck.
Feeling unusually brave at having Harry in his room, Draco climbs onto his bed, and sits on the other end of it, cross legged.
“It’s better than nowt” Harry said before chuckling. Finally, after the entire conversation being about Draco, yet carried out as if he wasn’t there, Harry turned to him.
“For some maybe, but not for me” Draco said, trying to cover up how pathetic he felt with a laugh.
“we’ll be there” Ron said, grinning.
“yes, yes my mistake” said Harry, stretching, as he sat down.
“What is going on with you Harry?” Came Remus’ deep voice, gentle yet still somewhat reprimanding.
“i guess that depends on what people consider important in a relationship.” Harry said.
“That's a lot of children” Draco said, dumbfounded that anyone in the modern day and age would have any more than three kids.
Luckily- not that anything about the whole situation felt much like luck to Harry- they landed in the attic unscathed.
Wont you get up off, get up off the roof?
“nothing’s wrong, Harry” Draco said softly.
Oh lei oh lai oh lord”
“I’ll leave this key with you, but I’ll be using my own to get you up in the morning” he said before closing the door softly behind him.
“Oh, do you do English too? We also have to pick a sonnet. Which were you thinking?”
Effie came and made curry again, with a spinach dish that Draco couldn't pronounce the name of, but that he thoroughly enjoyed. The paratha and rice also made a return, this time with extra naan.
“the two of us?” Draco sneered, “got a boyfriend I don’t yet know about, Potter?” he asked, quickly looking back to his book to hide his nervousness as to the answer.
“I only apologise because it feels insensitive” Draco eventually says.
“I owe you boys big time. How can I repay you?” he said, and Draco knew that this was just as much Theo flaunting his wealth as it was him being thankful.
Draco maintains that Harry had no idea he had cried that night, but the raven had clearly latched onto Draco’s appreciation of the singer, and for the next few days, every time the blond entered their room, he would be wrapped up in the soft tones of one of Hozier’s songs. He took this gesture of recognition, understanding and friendship and held it close to his heart.
A massive pencil-case looking bag flew into her hand and she ushered Harry into the bathroom next to his room. She swiped golden shimmer over his eyelids and on the apples of his cheeks, before lining his eyes with a vibrant blue liner and forcing him to apply lip gloss.
“so Draco wasn’t kidding when he said the three of you shared a bed. Pray tell what kinky Gryffindor antics ensue” said Blaise, looking at Harry as if he wanted to eat him.
“Here we are, lad. My favourites, cows are” Remus said, opening a gate and leading Draco into a field full of massive cows.
So, he did French, and now English? He was invading Draco’s domain. Draco also found it hard to believe a boy with that many muscles was also able to appreciate the beauty of Shakespearean sonnets. Draco also maybe kind of resented the fact that Theo must be in this boy's class, and Draco just had to be in the other one.
“You are a genius, Harry” said Ron, already pulling out his phone to message their little group chat and ask the girls to catch the earlier train.
“It was Remus’ idea, actually, I just helped him with it” Sirius said and then Draco was jogging over to them and wrapping his arms around Remus’ solid chest. Strong arms wrapped around his back for a moment before he stepped back again.
To Draco’s surprise, it was Sirius who was stood outside the next morning, knocking at a much more acceptable time of day. He was leaning somewhat heavily on a cane, which surprised Draco even more. Perhaps it was why Sirius never seemed to be doing any actual farm work.
Draco was too hungover for this.
“You uh, you can tell her. Actually, invite her here. I'll ask Sirius to tell her.”
“ yeah, sometimes” he says, and it’s too much.
“It is though, and none of us need it. I’m sorry my existence is so troubling to you, Harry, but that's between yourself and myself, so make up with Hermione already, okay?” Draco said, directing his gaze on Harry, who hung his head, looking undeniably young in that moment, despite the muscular and scarred arms that told otherwise.
Draco looked sweet when he was asleep, thought Harry. He could definitely see the physical attractiveness of the lithe blond. He was somewhat shorter than Harry, which Harry found endearing. Draco sighed against him, a pale hand clutching at Harry’s t-shirt. When harry was sure he was asleep, he slipped out again, and went back downstairs. He was impressed to see Pansy, Blaise and Seamus and Dean getting on remarkably well in the absence of the people that had connected them together.
Draco, drained from the mortification of laying himself bare to all those he had hurt, putting himself at risk of more pain, more suffering, just wished to slide into bed with ‘Fire from Heaven’, and fawn over the budding romance between Hephaestion and Alexander. Yet when he entered his room, he was faced with the high-pitched voice of a singer he didn’t know, and Harry. Harry Potter stood in the middle of the floor, body facing Draco but head to the ceiling, eyes shut as the so often were these days, white t shirt stuck to his skin with sweat, jean clad hips swaying seamlessly with the beat. He was flawlessly matching the girlish pitch of the singer, despite the deepness of his normal voice. ‘ain’t no particular sign I’m more compatible with, I just want your extra time and your… kiss!’ and on that tantalising final word, Harry’s head came down, and he threw his eyes open, bright green meeting stormy grey, his chest heaving, and easy smile gracing his lips as he looked that the blond in front of him, agape and seemingly awe-struck.
After what felt like aeons, the ginger boy straightened up and wiped his eyes, before ignoring Draco completely and turning to Harry and saying “he did Ken he was working on a farm, Harry?” He asked
(Harry, 6:30pm)
I wanna be your lady, your l-l-l-love
Hermione emerged at this point, and crawled onto Harry’s chest as he began to stroke her hair.
“you have your mum though, yea?” he heard Harry saying into his hair.
He believed what he was saying, but he said it less because it was true and more to feel Harry’s green eyes on his face again.
I caught it bad just today
“you’ve grown up nicely, Weasley, but I must say that Granger looks utterly edible in those jeans” she said, slowly raking her gaze over Hermione before taking her arm.
“I really hope Ron doesn't hate me” Harry sighed, and Draco remembered for the first time that Ginny was Ron’s sister, and that this would inevitably split his loyalties.
“you know I didn’t think killing Voldemort would turn me into a sex symbol” laughed Harry.
“if you don’t mind, I would love to stay and discuss what lead to you raising Teddy with you. I know in my mind you are too young to be raising a child, but you act as if it’s all you had ever known.” Narcissa smiles up at Harry.
“It is lovely to meet you, Sirius. I know little of my mother’s family, so it will be a pleasure to stay with you and get to know you more.”
“Ron is better than that though. When he thought we were together in the forest of Dean, he just left. He didn’t try and break us up- not that there ever was an ‘us’. That’s better than what Blaise did. And anyway, Ron was hurt and jealous and angry because he loved you. He really loved you, heart and soul. Blaise doesn’t love me; he’s doing this just to hurt Draco. That’s mean. Ron was never vindictive or malicious like that, just jealous and insecure.”
“Its… actually not as bad as I thought it would be” Ron said, giving Harry an appraising look.
“I hate that you’re always right.” Harry sighed.
brief warning, this chapter contains descriptions of a funeral !
Thursday morning dawned, and Draco was practically buzzing with excitement to see his mother again, and apprehension about his father.
“Hermione, this is Draco. He’s my cousin, staying for a few months and helping us with the farm” Sirius said when she finally paused to take a breath.
Harry was due to arrive any minute, and Draco was unsure of whether he should wait in Harry’s room with Ron, or let Harry come to him. He settled on waiting in his own room. It was a Saturday, so Theo was out cavorting with Daphne.
When Harry was sure Draco wouldn’t vomit on him, he knelt between Draco’s splayed legs and began slowly unbuttoning the vomit-soaked shirt, before stripping Draco of his trousers, and then hefted the blond into his arms before carrying him into Harry’s room, and tucking him under the covers, on his side so he wouldn’t choke. Harry placed his bin on the floor in line with Draco’s head and left a glass of water and hangover potion on the side of the bed before slipping out and going back to his friends.
Though Harry has offered Pansy and Blaise separate rooms, given that they are not a couple, they always insist they stay together. He gathers from Draco that Pansy often gets nightmares when sleeping in an unfamiliar place, and Blaise’s presence soothes her. Harry can understand this- he often sleeps in with Ron and Hermione when he feels overwhelmed.
“no, it’s fine” Draco squeaked. His mum winked at him. He hoped to God that Harry didn’t see.
Mama, oooh
Draco and Sirius looked at each other and grinned. Five minutes later, another notification that read ‘you have a message from Andromeda Tonks!’ flashed across the screen, and Sirius’ hand was shaking as he guided the mouse to open the message.
“you can take him through to the living room while we clear up, Mrs Malfoy. It’s just through that door and up that small flight of stairs- the room you floo’d into” he explained, before gathering plates up, and placing stasis charms on the remaining food.
Harry pushed Teddy in the baby swings and soon the little playground was filled with the sounds of Teddy’s giggles and Harry was once again reminded of how right his decision to adopt Teddy had been, even though he was approaching his nineteenth birthday and had been a ‘dad’ for almost a year now. He was also grateful that he had made the decision to write to Narcissa that morning last November; a decision that had led him to waking up in a warm bed with Draco draped across him this morning. Harry smiled as Teddy clapped his chubby hands at him. Draco was also wonderful with Teddy, even though he acted very much like a cousin rather than a co-parent, but it was rather early for that, Harry supposed.
“Oh, Draco no of course I want you to. We all want you to. I just thought that you might be put off by whatever went on between you and Harry and Hermione?” Sirius asked, clearly knowing more than he let on, likely told by Hermione herself.
“Poison?” Draco asked, uncomfortably aware of why his family might be referred to as such.
A perfect Titania and Oberon.
“Nana does make it the best” Harry acquiesced a bit coolly, before standing to the side to let Draco through, and walking into the house. Draco walked back to his cottage with his hand covering the shoulder Harry had touched, trying to pretend it hadn’t meant anything.
“I hope you don’t mind dinner is quite simple, I spent most of this morning setting up the spare room” Harry said, placing the bowls of pasta in front of the three Slytherins seated around his kitchen table. “he did it the muggle way” explained Draco. Pansy bared her teeth again and said “I see now where those muscles come from, Dray dearest why didn’t you tell me how handsome our lovely saviour is now” she said, before turning back to Harry “peacetime suits you” she winked.
“i need to go to Ron’s house, I'm sorry.”
“it’s not that bad, Ron. It doesn’t quite match the ginger, but it’s not that bad”
She flushed. Being from a Caribbean family, she loved a proper big party, but the culture was so incongruous with British party culture, let alone wizarding party culture, and she never felt able to bring Carib culture to Hogwarts- it was something she wanted to keep to herself but over the summer after the war she had invited Harry to a lime at her uncles house, and he had immediately gotten into the swing of things, learning how to secure a whine from Hermione’s meddlesome older cousins, and she had loved having someone to share that part of her with. He loved the soca music too, and kept trying to persuade her to introduce it to Hogwarts parties.
“Isn't that a surprise” said Harry cryptically, before he upped and left the room.
A forceful shout of “FUCK” from Malfoy, standing before the board startled Ron out of his reverie dreaming of the bacon waiting for him in the Great Hall.
Later that night, Draco heard sniffling and turned to see Harry, hunched over his Iliad, tears pouring down his face.
So I lied to my mum and dad,
“I bought my portable dvd player and some films. I thought we could watch one?” she said, rummaging in her bag and pulling out something that looked vaguely like a laptop, and various dvds.
The team was good. Despite it being an English private boy’s boarding school deep into the countryside, Harry wasn’t the only non-white member of the team, which was deeply reassuring. Dean Thomas was black, as was one of the other boys, named Isaac. It immediately put him a little more at ease. He had felt very out of place during the first few days of school. Academically, he deserved to be there, but neither his race nor family background fit the mould for the types of boys who attended these types of schools.
When they reached Harry and Remus, Draco thought he might be sick. Harry was crouched on the ground, with his arm inside a sheep. The sheep was lying on its side seemingly blissfully unaware of the fist and forearm inside it. Draco felt horrified, which only intensified when he heard Harry grunt and then slowly pull his arm back out of the sheep. In his hand were the two spindly hind legs of a lamb, and soon the whole little animal was out and laying on the grass, surrounded by the sheep’s bodily fluids. Harry gently swiped his fingers around its nose and mouth, before rubbing its side and placing it by its mother’s head.
He tentatively rested a hand on Harry’s hip and Harry responded by opening his mouth, licking at Draco’s lower lip. Draco opened his mouth and Harry deepened the kiss, keeping it oh so impossibly sweet, and gentle, and tender.
Draco dragged Harry every which way, and bought probably more clothes than he knew what to do with. He pestered Harry on muggle fashion, and much to his chagrin he ended up buying several pairs of ‘trackie bottoms’ as Harry called them, for his time with teddy. He bought some plain sweaters and hoodies for the same purpose. Harry bought himself some hoodies too, as the weather was getting colder. “right Draco, if you’re not too overwhelmed, we could get lunch, there’s a great muggle place near here called Wagamama’s’, that does Asian fusion food.” Harry said, retying Teddy on a bit tighter. Draco was indeed feeling quite overwhelmed, so he just nodded.
Draco doesn’t respond because he cannot find the words to express what that means to him, even though Lucius was dead to him long before his final breath. Instead, turns his head, laying it on Harry’s shoulder, and hopes that touch can convey what words cannot.
He was given his cup of tea in a slightly chopped William Morris mug that he couldn’t help appreciate. As he sipped he looked at the men in front of him, conversing earnestly in front of him about something to do with farming and he thought that maybe, just maybe the company could be bearable, even if the rest of it wouldn’t be. At the very least, he was unlikely to be hatecrimed.
“I'll touch your hair forever if you want me to” Harry said in response, softly, breathily, before threading his fingers though Draco’s soft golden locks, stroking gently.
I almost say ‘in love’
“oh, fuck Draco. I’m so sorry you had to see that” Harry said in his ear. “God, your poor mum”
“so you went from being a worthless person to being a Good Person. But when you were a child, you know you did nothing that merited you being worthless, yes? Your actions did not make you worthless, and you understand that as such, your relatives should not have called you this?”
“Uh homework” Draco managed to reply.
Fuck. Harry had a girlfriend. Fuck.
(9:34 pm, Draco)
As if sensing the emotion threatening to overwhelm Harry, Draco scooted his chair closer and lay his head on Harry’s shoulder, kissing his neck gently. Harry slipped an arm around his back, and kissed him on the top of his head.
“you- you don’t regret it, Potter? You’re not here to beat the death eater for taking advantage of you in your intoxicated state?” the words didn’t contain the bite Draco intended, instead they came out weak and shaky.
“Ah. Let me explain. I am Sirius Black, your mother’s cousin. This is Potter Hall Farm, your home until mid-November, that being said there is a permanent position here should you choose to take it,” Here, Sirius smirked as if he knew the idea of life on a farm was Draco’s absolute worst nightmare.
“do pancakes work?” he got three nods of approval, and set about making pancakes. Once the batter was done, he left to settle Teddy into his swing-thing and cast a special monitoring charm; if Teddy became distressed Harry’s wand would buzz and let him know. He paused outside the kitchen, just to double check the charm worked and he heard the three Slytherins talking.
“what did I do to deserve you, Harry Potter? Me and Draco both” she laughed into his chest. It sounded weak, and broken.
The game started at two, and the time between breakfast and then was spent in a mad dash to get all his homework done, so he could focus on just Harry, both during and after the game. He also changed his outfit, about five times. He finally settled on a pair of Levi’s jeans Pansy had made him buy that he had worn about once, and a t-shirt he had ‘borrowed’ off Blaise about a year ago that Draco liked to think looked artfully oversized. Theo always insisted it just looked baggy, but Draco didn’t want to wear his usual posh clothes- he wanted to make a good impression, and displaying the wealth disparity between him and Harry’s friends hadn’t seemed like the way to go.
Their conversation was cut short when there was a strong knock at the door, and Draco opened it to see Harry there.
“No, I'm fine. Go away” he said, sliding further down the bed and burying his face in the duvet.
“No, sweetheart. They both left yesterday, so I could have some time with you.”
Dean and Seamus were standing at the door, talking animatedly. They turned when they heard Draco and the girls’ approach.
“talking about me, were you?” asked Malfoy, sounding petulant.
It got even worse when the poor mother of too many children got bent over a table and fucked within an inch of her life in an effort to produce another (illegitimate) child and bring her husband home from the war. Draco choked. He had quite forgotten how explicit the French were- how prudish they considered the English to be. He didn’t know where to look. His eyes darted between Harry and the whiteboard, his palms sweating, and he felt very much like a fourteen-year-old gearing up for his first wank.
The two of them sat on the sofa entirely absorbed in each other for hours. Pansy told him about how she had spent her first part of a-level summer, which included a lot of lazing about the house and a girls trip to Cornwall with some of her friends from school.
“I mean, technically I am the ‘or something’ in that, and you’re right- I’m frankly terrified for the rugby team to find out- but I don’t think a blond skinny posh boy who uses a ‘princess’ mug can be that homophobic” replied Harry, using his shoulder to shove open the door to their room, immediately stripping off his sweaty t-shirt and shorts.
“i wore my pyjamas past noon today. Feeling rebellious.
Maybe he should tell Harry. Maybe he will.
“Where’s Remus?” he asked when he had finished eating, surprised as Remus had never once missed a meal since Draco had been there.
“Potty darling I hope you don’t mind if Blaise and I stay a few days longer? It’s a lovely house you have, and I have lots of shopping I would like to do. If there’s one thing muggles are unequivocally better at, its fashion”
“yeah, you say that because you didn’t have to go months without sex waiting for the bloody thing, and in the aftermath of the birth. You’ve got it easy” Ron huffed as he descaled the salmon.
“Apart from Harry” she whispered, tangling her feet with his. Draco snorted into her hair.
“you’ll never have that, Teddy. I'm your godfather like Sirius is mine, and I will always be there to protect you” Harry said to the boy in his arms. Teddy snuffled and yawned, slowly opening his eyes and gazing dazedly up at Harry.
“can I kiss you, Malfoy?” Harry dared ask, watching Malfoy’s face intently for a reaction.
“I’m not going anywhere” Harry whispered, fierce and earnest, squeezing Draco impossibly closer, feeling as if he never wanted to let go.
Is this the real life
The ball was going well. The dinner was lovely, Ron and Hermione were making lovey-eyes at each other over the table, and Luna had kept him entertained with her stories about all her mad pets. The terrapin was his favourite, he had decided.
“Good riddance, eh?” he says, face grim. He passed the baby to Harry, who immediately felt better with the small boy cradled against his chest. Remus then followed Sirius into the kitchen and he heard low, muted and urgent conversation that steadily rose in volume.
Harry handed Draco his phone and the four of them assembled into a little group. Harry slid his arm around Luna. She smelled of lemons, he thought absently. She stretched onto her tip toes and kissed him on the cheek, and he grinned at the camera.
Draco made his way to the reception desk to pick up his timetable for lessons, having gotten his dorm assignment the night before. He wondered where the two new boys would be living, and if he would have the misfortune to be sharing any communal spaces with them.
“I don’t know. I've never kissed a boy before. I want to” Draco admitted, spurred on by the feel of Harry’s fingers against his scalp.
“You may come here whenever you wish, to see the photo. I am looking into finding a copy for you to keep. Good luck, today. Take the rest of the week off if you feel you need it. Remember, we are all here for you.” she said, before silently exiting the room.
Harry greeted Narcissa with a formal handshake and a “Mrs Malfoy”, before nodding at Draco with a “nice to see you, Draco,” before ushering them into the kitchen so he didn’t leave Teddy unsupervised for long.
Draco nodded and waited uncomfortably as Ron shoved two more pairs of trousers and some t-shirts into a canvas bag, before the two of them went back downstairs.
It felt good to change, to know he was working hard and accomplishing things, and eating well. He felt more like a man with every passing day, which was something he hadn't expected to find joy in.
“all my friends love you, Draco. I’m sorry that you felt like you had to lie to me, and I’m sorry that you have so little faith in this. If you wanted though, we could test this out in the world of our flat? Not tell anyone until its less new, and more secure, and then start thinking about making it public? We live almost like a couple anyway- the main differences would be sharing a bedroom, maybe, and spending more free time together. We could even go out in muggle London”
“fuck” breathed Harry, as he bent down and swept Draco off his feet bridal-style, and eased him through the crowds and carried him upstairs. Just in time, Harry gently let Draco down in front of the toilet in Harry’s ensuite as Draco heaved and bright pink vomit went all down him.
“I’m secretly hoping that each time is bad enough to make him give up drinking yet somehow it never is” mused Pansy.
“Take these Ron my love, for the boys” Ron’s mum said as they left, shoving a sealed tin into her son's hands.
“Come on, we have a few hours until Theo gets back, we can just watch telly in bed?” Draco said, desperate to be wrapped up in Harry’s arms again.
“Yeah, yeah okay. You could come here?”
“I sat in great grandmother’s armchair”
As with Narcissa, it was awfully formal, but Harry deeply appreciated the sentiment. He wrote back immediately.
I say this last part knowing I’m likely to be hexed for it, and I hold my breath. He nods slowly, wearily, and I take this to mean I am safe for the time being, and so I plough ahead.
Draco stared with his mouth open, but Blaise jumped in with a predictable “I liked you better without it, Potty”
I want to break free from your lies
“Did you have a film in mind? That sounds good to me” Draco said, happy to do whatever Harry said. Also, the idea of watching a film in bed with him again was too tempting to resist.
“He is gorgeous” his mother said, right before she swept past Draco, opening the door before he got a chance to.
“Ron’s bed was the first bed you ever slept in?” he asked.
“Yeah. I know what they’re like.”
“yeah” Harry breathes from behind him, before standing up abruptly. “Well, see you tomorrow Draco” he says, slapping Draco on the shoulder and going back to Ron, who heaves himself up off the sofa and drapes an arm over Harry’s shoulder as the two start bickering and laughing as they head off to their room, which is two floors below Draco’s.
Maybe it was cruel of him to compare his father to Harry’s dead parents but Harry had Sirius and Remus and Draco had a mother who may have loved him but had only ever said it to him five times in recent memory. She had sent him a birthday card but hadn't offered to come up and see him. She had sent him away for months.  That wasn't really good mothering, was it, Draco thought as he trudged back to the cottage, not noticing any of his surroundings.
“I always wanted a Josh”
Harry held Luna’s hand as they followed McGonagall’s swift, un-faltering footsteps to a far corner of the castle, which was to become their home. Upon reaching a large ornate door, she turned around and announced to the gathered teenagers the decisions made for their Eighth year.
Here she stopped to sip her tea, then set the mug down on the floor and tucked her feet up onto the sofa.
I go, of course. Pansy is my best friend, horrible bint that she is, and it wouldn’t do to be the only eighth year not in attendance.
“Do you need a hand?” Draco asked, before wincing at how condescending he must have sounded.
“But I'm telling you that you can. Ron complains about his parents to me all the time, and he has more reason to feel guilty about that then you do”
It was nice, having someone who could relate. Sirius was the person Draco had always needed growing up, and how he finally had him. Being able to complain about his father without the worry of being screamed at, of having his phone taken away and being shut in his room for hours on end for voicing displeasure. It was freeing.
Harry threw himself on the sofa, and to his surprise, Blaise flopped on top of him. Maybe Blaise wasn’t taking the piss.
It was more information than Draco had expected, and he was grateful for it. He wasn’t sure what to say, though. It felt like navigating a minefield.
“sure” said Harry with a grin, before getting into Draco’s bed. Not onto, on top of the covers like all the times before, but fully into, snuggling up under the covers. Draco had no choice but to join him.
Two hours later, Remus arrives with a sleeping Teddy strapped to his chest.
“we’ll take our leave. Fake norovirus will give Draco at least three more days off school, so we’ll both be around.” Narcissa says, giving Harry a tight hug.
Harry laughed. “you look equally ravishing, Parkinson. I would expect nothing less.” She bared her teeth at him in a feral grin, and Harry nodded to Blaise, “Zabini, nice to see you.” The other black boy nodded gracefully, but replied with a somewhat biting “is it, Potter?”
“Honestly, Hermione don’t go to the trouble. He doesn’t need to like me, it's okay. It's not breaking my heart or anything.”
“Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good” Harry said, clambering onto Draco’s bed and pulling Draco next to him.
“sorry Zabini, the only third we accept is Potter”
He knew he shouldn’t worry; he trusted Harry, and he trusted Ron to look after Harry, but he couldn't help himself. He so wished it was himself at Harry’s side during this, offering support during such an unimaginably complicated time, but he also knew why it wasn’t him. He knew the place Ron held in Harry’s life was special, he knew that Ron had seen Harry go through unimaginable pain, and suffering, and that he had been a sounding board for Harry in those times, a safe space.
They had a lovely lunch in borough market. Harry enjoyed watching the three purebloods struggle with muggle change, used to the ease of credit cards, and ultimately ended up paying for them all.
Why were you digging, what did you bury?
I close my eyes against the onslaught of hope that threatens to overwhelm me. For the first time in my life, words elude me, and so instead I shuffle backwards and peel back the top corner of my duvet, hoping he gets the hint. He does, and he swings his legs over before wriggling under the duvet and turning to face me.
“The letters?” I ask, my voice hoarse.
“no worries Blaise, I have learnt Draco is the same.” Harry and Blaise laughed, and Harry realised he really rather liked the two of Draco’s friends. He was glad of the advice his mind healer had given him after the year, that forgiveness is light as a feather, but hate is heavy as a brick. As much as he resented the three- specifically Draco and Pansy for their school and war-time behaviour, he could see that they had changed, and carrying around hate for them would just make his life miserable.
Ron let him stop for a minute to catch his breath back, and Draco felt the sudden urge to cry. He was so far away from home, surrounded by people he neither knew nor understood, expected to work a punishing job that he had no experience in. He could see the summer and autumn play before him; painfully stiff joints and tired achy muscles and nights alone in the tiny house and early mornings with two boys who acted like he wasn’t there for most of the time.
“Harry’s is nicer” mumbled Seamus before almost immediately starting to snore again.
It was the Thursday before they went back to school when Harry found himself walking back up the impossibly long driveway to Draco’s house. His mother answered the door again, and much to his surprise, swept Harry into a hug.
“I’ll come back to visit before the summer ends, and again in autumn” she promised, as she gripped him back just as tightly. Too soon, the whistle indicating the train's imminent departure blew, and he had to let her go. He stood and watched until the train was a speck on the horizon, before he felt Remus’ hand land on his shoulder.
“Yea he’s some slimy lad from t’village that won't leave me alone either. Not sure why everyone wants me. Maybe it's because I'm the only brown lad for miles around, makes me exotic” Harry said the last bit self-deprecatingly, and Draco felt surprisingly sorry for him. He had only ever been the object of unwanted attention from girls from the sister school, but he was mean enough that it soon turned most of them off.
He then took her all the way to the copse of apple trees, and the two of them lay stretched out in the shade next to it, basking in the early-July sun. they talked through Draco’s options, and Pansy said that he should stay here just so she could visit and drool over Harry, and though she was joking Draco knew it was her way of expressing support for him if he chose to deviate from the traditional path, and he loved her for it. Knowing had her support warmed him more than the sun ever could.
“shit you heard that”
“I’ve asked Hermione, and she said yes” said Ron, grinning. “I don’t know if she sees it as a proper date, but she’s coming nonetheless, even if it’s just as friends”
“its really fine, Narcissa. The walk is good exercise anyway, and Sirius is okay with it!”
“won’t you get lonely, mum?”
The food was delicious, and Pansy said so several times, much to Remus’ and Sirius’s amusement. Draco was just so happy to have her there to spend his birthday with, and he kept glancing at her out of the corner of his eye to remind himself that he wasn’t dreaming, this wasn’t one of their sporadic texts he could send or receive whenever he found signal in the blasted countryside, but she was actually there, her short-clad thigh pressed against his trouser-clad one, her elbow knocking his as they ate.
They spent a lovely day exploring London together, but Harry was thoroughly exhausted when he returned home. Dean and Seamus had gone, but Draco was sat on the sofa, looking much better, chatting amiably with Blaise.
Harry went for a run to calm down, before apparating to the burrow and spending the whole day baking with Molly. Not ready to go back home yet, he stayed as late as he could, before strapping a slumbering Teddy to his chest and apparating back to London. He wandered the dark deserted streets for hours, before using his wizarding privileges and apparating into Regent’s park, which was locked for the night. He refreshed the warming charms he had cast over Teddy, nestled against his chest in the baby carrier. He wandered around, loving the glow of the streetlamps over the near-skeletal trees. Pushing down the feeling of cowardice, when he finally decided to return to Grimmauld, he apparated straight into his bedroom, conjuring a cot for Teddy so he didn’t have to face Draco. He was so disappointed that Draco had so quickly reverted to how he had been at Hogwarts. Harry felt a bitter taste in his mouth thinking about how much he had hoped Draco had really changed.
“Oh, Draco, that's so sad” Hermione breathed and Draco chuckled, releasing her hand and draping his arm around her shoulders. She cuddled into his side and said “well I’m your friend. Fuck boys, who needs them?” and Draco laughed and agreed, secretly suspecting her declaration may also have had something to do with a certain Ron Weasley.
“ten!...nine!...eight!...” Harry laughed as he rubbed Draco’s back and whispered to the sick boy in front of him, “Happy New Year, Malfoy”. Harry kissed the blond’s cheek, then muttered to himself, “so much for a new year’s kiss”.
“yea, that should be fine. I'll just ask my mum” Draco said, all but running for the door.
(Harry, 8:30)
Noise reached them before they even opened the kitchen door. Voices so deep they bled together. When Sirius opened the door, Draco saw Harry and Remus sat with two ginger boys he hadn't met before. They were all shovelling pasta into their mouths in between sentences,  and Draco took a moment to appreciate how much energy farm work must burn.
“What about you then, what’s the low down on your love life?” Harry asked, grinning at Draco.
“Oh, so you want someone to put up with your snooty poshness?” Harry said, laughing and putting the laptop gently on the floor, and sitting up.
Draco’s attention was automatically pulled back to the here-and-now. He dreaded the idea of more of them infesting what he very much believed was His school; generations of Malfoy’s had attended Hogwarts, all of them graduating with top grades, and going straight to Oxford or Cambridge. Draco belonged here, in these halls, where his father, and grandfather, and great grandfather had all roamed these hallowed halls.
Draco was starting to see the appeal of farm life. Remus and Harry were clearly in their element out here, surrounded by nature and animals that they clearly loved and adored.
“Come now Draco” his mother admonished. “I’m your mother. I’ll wager I knew you liked boys before you did”
Feeling bad for the constant teasing Draco was suffering, Harry thought to rescue him and said, “let me put my top back on and then Draco you can come with me to get Teddy yeah?”
Draco went to take another sip of his drink and Harry deftly swiped it out of his hand, before taking a sip and exclaiming “Jesus Draco, are you drinking pure vodka? No wonder you’re this out of it”
Draco could have kicked himself, of course. England was full of universities, of course there would be one close by, should he wish to go.
“Hey Harry” he replied, voice embarrassingly scratchy. He was so glad no one else was here. He turned back to his laptop, trying to focus on the last few paragraphs of the essay he had been writing since 5 pm that afternoon when he heard heavy footfalls and looked up again to see Harry bounding over to him.
The next thing to bring him out of his book was a light knock on his door. Looking out the window, he saw the light had dimmed considerably as the day bled into evening and he assumed it was Harry calling him for dinner, but instead it was Hermione. She was in a long, hippie-like skirt and baggy sweatshirt, holding a backpack.
“It's Harry, mum” Sirius said quietly, his hand shaking a bit as he reached for his water glass. Effie had a dreamy, far away look on her face and seemed to ignore Sirius completely. She rubbed her hand down Harry’s cheek and said “my James, my best boy”
‘bought four drinks I’m wasted, I can see you dancing, I can lay down next to you, at the foot of my bed, if I drink enough’
Hermione sat next to Draco, on the opposite side and other end of the table to Harry, who looked somewhat hurt. Remus looked between them, but he wasn’t frowning this time. Sirius looked confused and Draco watched as Remus leant over and whispered something in his ear, and the furrow in Sirius’ brow immediately smoothed out.
The film ended and Harry climbed out of the bed, saying “right, well if we both make notes on it, then meet again in a few days to make the PowerPoint? Does that work?”
“Reet. reet, so this isn't pity this is me making up for my behaviour, and trying to start over. And also because Sirius, Remus and Hermione all told me to get me ‘ead out me arse” Harry said, laughing uncomfortably.
He starts to stroke my hair. If I were a cat, I’d be purring.
“she looked like Hermione because she’s Hermione’s cousin, and god I wasn’t ‘all over her’, we were dancing.” Here Harry looked annoyed and god, Draco could have cried knowing that he had somehow caused this.
He started dancing in earnest now, clearly affected by Ron’s impending return, given that it was too early for anyone sane to be dancing.
“alright boys, into bed now” Harry announced, sounding shockingly like a house matron. He half walked, half carried the two drunken best friends over to his bed, tugging off their shoes and magically pulling the duvet over their already-sleeping bodies. “guess it’s you and me tonight then, eh Malfoy?” Harry said, smiling softly and getting into his underwear before making himself comfy in Draco’s bed. Draco was too drunk to register what was happening, and before he knew it a smooth brown arm had yanked him under the covers, and the lights were turned off. With the comforting scent of firewhiskey emanating off the warm body next to him, Draco was lulled into an uneasy sleep. He can feel the whiskey in his bloodstream, and he knows it’s not enough to stop dreaming.
Later that morning, Draco asks if Pansy and Blaise can stay again. Harry grins at the prospect- he loves his flirtatious friendships with Pansy and Blaise- or rather, they flirt with him and he laughs in response, and ever since the ‘childhood incident’ as Harry calls it, he and the other Slytherins have become very close. Seemingly out of guilt, Pansy and Blaise- but mainly Pansy- have become very protective of Harry, which Harry finds endearing, if completely unnecessary. They seemed particularly affected by the starvation part of Harry’s past, and the first month of Harry and Draco’s relationship involved many dinners at the luxury Chelsea flat that Pansy and Blaise shared, until everyone agreed that Harry’s cooking was objectively nicer, and they went back to dinners at Grimmauld. They hadn’t stayed longer than just dinner since the conception of Harry and Draco’s relationship, though, and Harry was excited at the prospect of them staying again.
“Honestly, nothing, we swear,” said Ron.
To dissolve the bond; for example, if you have found someone better (here, this usually means richer, or of a purer bloodline), or if your ‘claimee’ wishes to marry another, you must simply say ‘I hereby renounce my claim upon...’ and the bond is dissolved.
“You don’t deserve to rest on hallowed ground. You don’t deserve to rest at all. If there is a god, you should be burning in hell for what you did to me, but I don’t care about that. I'm not going to wish that on you. All I care is that you’re gone, and I will never, ever have to see you again” Harry said, voice low, in his own approximation of a funeral speech. He scooped up some soil and sprinkled it on the mound, to soften the blow of his words, though he wasn’t sure why. Perhaps because he was indeed on hallowed ground. Perhaps because he didn’t want the other occupants of the graveyard to think he had no respect for the dead. He had respect for the dead, of course. The good dead, the ‘glorious’ dead as soldiers were often called, which was how he viewed his parents, but he had no respect for Vernon Dursley.
Luckily, he returned home to Draco frantically dressing the table in very smart trousers and an ornately patterned shirt Harry hadn’t seen before. “I guess this mean’s I’ll be expected to dress up too” groaned Harry. “you’ll have to help me Draco. I want to impress your friends, but I can only dress either how I do every day or how I do to go clubbing, and I doubt Pansy or Blaise want to see me in trousers that tight” Harry smirks as Draco blushes again at Harry’s mention of himself in tight trousers, but the blond nods and grabs Harry’s hand frantically saying, “they’re going to be here in two hours and you still need to cook”
I watched this all from my armchair, the unwilling spectator. I was about to get up and go after Hermione when Potter flopped onto the armchair across from me, staring at me with that intense gaze of him that reminds you that you are faced not with an eighteen-year-old, but with the man that managed to defeat the wizard not even Dumbledore could. After a long minute of being stared at, I turned back to my book and was getting stuck back into the world of Bram Stoker and his blood-sucking fiend, Potter said “how do you do it?”
Draco felt his heart rate speed up dangerously.
Draco settled down with a new book, looking forward to a day of peace and desperately trying to keep the image of Harry’s sleeping face from his mind.
“yeah, okay” he breathes, before leaving the kitchen, cake unfinished, and curling up in the corner of the sofa, looking out the window at the trees that are slowly turning from brown to green with the encroaching spring. They seem to represent an optimism that Harry doesn’t feel.
“shove off Malfoy” muttered Harry. “it’s not like you want this either.”
His mention of the morning reminded Draco that he was likely to be expected awake and functional at about four. He groaned and set about brushing his teeth to get ready for bed. He considered sleeping in pants only like he did at home, especially considering the balmy late-spring heat but decided against it. He didn’t need Harry seeing him so close to naked so early on in their acquaintanceship.
“Sirius? I can come back later if you’re busy” he said.
On softly padding feet, clearly another victim of a bad night’s sleep, Hermione came to join them, kissing Harry on the cheek and laying her head on his shoulder, happy to be enveloped by his warm voice, “I didn’t care much how long I lived, but I swear I thought I dreamed her, she never asked me once about the wrong I did”
Draco was left holding a baby at arm’s length, now scared he was going to be vomited on, staring at the retreating image of Harry’s muscular, dark back. An hour later, Draco found himself feeding applesauce to teddy with a small plastic spoon while Harry painstakingly iced a monstrosity of a chocolate cake. “it’s so much easier with someone here, you have no idea Draco.” Said harry, as he finally finished and put the cake in the middle of the table and began to lay plates around it. “I uh, I’m not really doing much at the moment. I can’t work until my 18 months’ probation is over, so I could come over a couple days a week and help out if you wanted?” Draco offered, trying to wipe baby food out of Teddy’s hair, with no idea as to how it got there. “that’s really kind of you Draco but please don’t feel like you must! I do manage okay” replied Harry. Draco gave up trying to clean the wriggling baby and turned to Harry. “seriously, Harry. It would get me out of the manor which is a godsend these days. I can’t stand it there, and I would love to know more about both my cousin and muggle life. We could see it as an exchange. I play au pair three or four days a week, and on those days, you teach me about the muggle world. The black box in your living room is muggle, and you bake the muggle way, and all of teddy’s toys, clothes, and most of your furniture is all muggle, so you clearly are living in both worlds. It would help me become less ignorant, and you would get a bit more time to relax.” Draco turned back to feeding Teddy, unusually scared for what Harry’s response would be. “god Draco that’s, thank you, so much. I’ll accept that exchange. Teddy wakes up around 6 most days, but I don’t eat breakfast until 8:30. So if you could get here maybe 9? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays? I’m at the burrow enough Saturdays that we shouldn’t schedule it in, and Molly won’t relinquish her Teddy time. I see Andy on Sundays. Soon though, I’m sure, you and your mother will be joining her on Sundays too. Does that work?” Harry asked, “as there is an exchange of sorts you can treat this as a real job with holiday days or whatever, just owl me in advance if you need the day off, or owl me in the morning if you’re sick.” Said harry, turning and then groaning at the sight of his godson covered in pureed apples. “I tried to keep him clean, I swear. I don’t know how it got in his hair.” Harry just laughed, and said “don’t worry Draco, it always gets in his hair. Can you run up and grab him a new onesie and nappy? I’ll just rinse him down in the sink. He can have his big bath later. You can help with that if you want.” Draco nodded and turned to go.
“I would kiss you after that, but your breath probably smells of vomit, and you should definitely shower. I’ll kiss you when you’re clean”.
Draco was affronted by the term. It felt derogatory, even though Draco could not have been even two years younger than Harry.
“Oh, Draco. Ron likes you, you know? He just feels a lot of loyalty to Harry so he doesn’t talk to you much. You would really know if he didn’t like you. I’ll talk to him about talking Harry round” she said, patting his arm in a distinctly motherly way, despite the fact that she had been leaning on him for support just a few minutes ago.
Draco steels himself, and walks out of the room to his mother’s library, where he knows she will be.
“Come here, Draco” Harry said, pulling Draco into his lap and holding him close.
“of course, Draco” Harry says in his impossibly soft voice.
“Can you not come without Draco?” Peterson asks and I can’t help but smile. Harry laughs out loud, and Peterson looks startled.
But now I’ve gone and thrown it all away
“it’s okay dear, he will be okay” she soothed rubbing circles on his back.
The night passed in much the same fashion, with the addition of more of the heavenly spiced cider, many bottles of wine and lots and lots of Molly’s cake. Draco had an amazing time, despite the fact that he only truly knew one person in attendance, but given that Hermione, the adults and most of the older Weasley brothers had gone out of their way to make him feel welcome, the party didn't feel disjointed or strange to him.
Harry greatly enjoyed the hilarity of explaining to three uppity purebloods that they were expected to spear marshmallows on sticks taken from the forest to their right, burn said marshmallows in open, sooty flame, and then eat them. He also enjoyed how Malfoy was so dainty, as disgust with the cooking method warred with the joy of eating singed marshmallows warred openly across Malfoy’s face.
Draco’s heart stopped for the second time in fifteen minutes.
Draco’s voice came from uncomfortably close, and harry realised he was stood, gaping on the threshold, and he walked in, sitting on one of the armchairs that faced the sofa on which Narcissa sat. Draco sat next to his mother, and reached out to hold one of Teddy’s tiny hands, smiling softly.
“I love this. I finally have someone to gossip with” he said, leaning forward towards Draco, his light eyes twinkling. Draco noticed that they shared the same grey irises.
“That it is, but I’ve never seen a man and woman more in love than Molly and Arthur, even if they have a unique way of showing it,” Sirius replied, smiling gently at Draco. It made Draco relax for the first time since he arrived, the look of friendship on Sirius’ face.
“They are disgustingly in love” he said, going to lean against the wall- aiming for the picture of nonchalant rich boy at a party beneath him- but he was further from the wall than he had thought and he stumbled back, only to be caught by Harry who murmured
monster winer by Kerwin Dubois
“Again, Harry. You don’t have to do this because other people told you to. That feels almost worse, actually” Draco said, smiling pityingly when Harry’s whole face dropped. He felt Pansy’s hand cover his and knew that she was awake and listening.
“Oh, Harry! I didn’t realise you were here. I thought we could watch the second how to train your dragon film?” Draco said, looking up at Harry with such a sweet expression on his face.
“where is that sound coming from, Harry? Its oozing out of the walls.” Asked Draco, already slightly slurring after only two glasses
“more so than I thought I would be” I admit. “the picture is too sweet for me to be angry. We look-“
The image that conjured was so sweet. Draco had never done anything like that with his mum. She used to take him to art galleries sometimes, and then to posh cafes afterwards, but she was never an ‘arts-and-crafts mum’ as she referred to them, usually with disdain.
“merlin Harry, you sound like an old man.” Breathed Draco, visibly relaxing. “I’m basically a dad now, Draco. That puts me in old man territory” Harry laughed, drying his hands and gesturing for Draco to follow him into the living room. He stopped short when he saw Narcissa singing a lullaby to a sleepy Teddy, who was sucking his thumb with eyelids half closed.
I turn around and sit at my desk, my back to him. I hear him heave a sigh, and then walk into my room.
“Fucking muggles are we, Potter?” I say, smirking. This act that Blaise and I are putting on reminds me so much of before the war that I struggle not to cry. I detest who I was then, but God do I miss being the Ice Prince of Slytherin. I miss the superiority, the confidence, the knowledge that every Slytherin would do my bidding at the drop of a hat. I miss having that power. In today’s post-war landscape, I am powerless.
Remus bought them takeaway, and Harry ate what Sirius assured him was his dad’s favourite type of curry, feeling bittersweet as he did so.
“no, a loving one.” Replied Harry bluntly. He had become better at talking about the Dursleys recently, and he saw a mind healer to help him cope as he raised Teddy when his only point of reference was his own upbringing. “my muggle relatives abused me up until I went to Hogwarts, and every summer when I went back.” He said, unable to look either of the Malfoy’s in the eye. Spurred on now he started, he ploughed ahead. “they made me sleep in the cupboard under the stairs. They would lock me in there if I did something they considered ‘bad’, which was often. They starved me, which is why I think I like baking so much now. It reminds me that I have control over what I eat. That’s why I wanted to raise Teddy, to give him everything I never had.” He finally looked up, and to his surprise it was Draco who had teared up.
Harry’s face had dropped a little at the mention of his family, but some of the light crept back into his eyes at Draco's somewhat weak assertion that he wasn't like them. Draco remembered Sirius saying Harry probably saw Draco as the same as the other Blacks, and hoped that this conversation would help in changing that belief.
“He looks like you, Harry!” Ron said, pointing at the boy in the middle, clearly the captain. Though his skin was somewhat darker, the likeness was clear.
“fuck OFF Blaise”
“it’s a French muggle song about a bird” said Draco behind him. “she used to sing it to me when I was a baby”
Harry stumbled groggily down the corridor to where he could hear Teddy crying. Eyes barely open, he scooped the baby up and collapsed into the plush armchair in the corner of the nursery. Teddy calmed immediately and soon was fast asleep. Unfortunately Harry was not so lucky. As he stroked the sleeping boy’s hair, he wondered how he had got there. He was barely 18 and basically a dad already; Andromeda helped with Teddy as she could but was so deep in her grief, she had become neglectful of the infant, and before it could border on abuse Harry had swooped in without thinking, taking full custody of the baby and moving into Grimmauld place. He had enough money that he needn’t worry about a job yet and for all intents and purposes, he was essentially a stay-at-home dad before he had even reached adulthood.
“Pans. If Harry held all that against us, do you really think he would be letting us all live in the home he shares with a child who is essentially Harry’s own son? Harry understands that we were children, and even if he doesn’t expressly forgive us, as I would never ever expect him to-“ here Draco looks up at Harry, and Harry sees grey eyes filled with emotion and silvery with tears. “he has moved past it, yea? I’m sure that if you apologise properly, as I did, Harry will be okay.”
“I would never do that!” Harry splutters.
They walked for about two hours, going around the tiny village about three times. Sirius knew most of the locals by name, and they all greeted him cheerily, which he hadn't expected. His view of old english villages were that they were all quite racist and homophobic. When he voiced this to Sirius, he hummed.
The table murmured praise at Ron finally getting the balls to ask her out, and then Theo waxed poetic about Daphne for a bit.
“I think since then he’s always subconsciously associated Sirius’ family with the people who took his parents away. And whilst I think it was a fair pre-conception for him to have, the minute you proved you weren't like them he should have treated you with more kindness”
The next day I wink at Peterson as I stride into The Minister’s office.
Draco laughed again. “Maybe this will push her to divorce him. Their marriage was arranged, did you know that? I didn’t, not until this week. God and I bet your parents are so disgustingly in love”
And then with the war…”
Harry then turned to hug Dean and Seamus, who had brought vodka and lemonade, proclaiming that the group had to partake in a muggle ritual of ‘pre-gaming’.
The room was empty but for three people. Draco, and what must be his friends. One was black, with deliciously rich skin and depthless dark eyes. The other was a non-descript, tall mousey boy, who also looked like a poster boy for rich parents and private schools and personalised porches and homes in the country.
“I don’t know what to say. I'm not good at being a boyfriend, I don’t know how to do it. All of what I want, or think I want, feels disingenuous, or heteronormative”
He and Harry hadn't had a proper conversation since their first in the sitting room after Sirius had gone, but Harry soon went back to the cool indifference of before, and Draco felt a fool for ever wishing that Harry would want to be his friend. In fact, it almost felt as if Harry was putting even more distance between them, as if regretting ever having a real conversation with Draco.
Sirius trailed off, and the pain in his silence was almost too much for Draco to bear.
“That's rich coming from you. Where’s any of tha’ fucking communication between you an’ Ron, eh?” Harry asked, suddenly angry. Draco was honestly surprised.
Almost, until...
“has anyone told you that assumptions make an ass out of you and me?” quipped Draco, lacking his usual malice. He held a black-tipped porcelain hand up when Harry tried to defend himself, and then ran said hand through his short platinum hair. “yes, I’m gay, Potter, you assumed correctly… this time.”
Blaise apparently had a crush on me at the time, even though neither I nor Draco knew about it, and despite knowing the whole endeavour was fake, Blaise was convinced that me and Draco were sleeping together anyway, and it inspired this… insidious resentment of Draco.
It was really nice, too. The film was sweet enough to start with- the young girl living with grandparents in a quaint French village, the beau that showed her the wonders of romance, carving their initials into church bells and singing their love to the world…
It all came back to Potter on this infernal weekend. Every time he closed his eyes Draco could feel the warmth of Potter’s body wrapped around him, Potters soft breathing stirring up the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck. Every time he adjusted his bag he was reminded of Potter’s unexpected kindness. Draco didn’t know what to do. He and Potter, despite not being enemies, or hostile, or hateful anymore, were still no closer to being friends, or so Draco thought. Once this weekend was over, they would go back to their own worlds; never talking, never interacting, never cuddling under the stars on a crisp welsh September night his brain treacherously supplied. Draco heaved a sigh, that same bittersweet feeling filling his veins.
“let's get you a drink, huh?” and began to propel Draco through the crowd of people.
“It took a long time for them to get used to us, and I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we don't live here, so they never have to see us be that affectionate or anything. We only come to this village for the communal events. Not only are we careful to not be overly affectionate in front of everyone, but we also almost always have Harry, and the locals will always love us more for what we have done for Harry than they’ll hate us for being gay.”
“fuck off” the blond mumbled.
Pansy pouted a bit when she saw Draco in jeans, but didn’t push the issue after seeing the look on Draco’s face. She sat the two boys down on her bed, before meticulously applying glitter to both their faces, and black eyeliner to Draco’s. “I’ve gone for subtle tonight boys, seeing as you’ll only have eyes for each other.”
“Teddy’s in a bad mood so we’re going to watch a film. You are all welcome to join” he said before settling onto the sofa, Teddy tucked against his stomach. Surprisingly, none of the Slytherins leave. Draco makes himself comfy next to Harry, and Blaise and Pansy arrange themselves on the other sofa. He decided on Aladdin, before dimming the lights with a lazy wave of his hand.
Remus helped Effie get up and took her somewhere, maybe the family living room or her bedroom, Draco wasn't sure. Soon enough, he was left alone in the kitchen, and he fell into the monotony of washing and soaping and drying and stacking as he tried not to dwell on the pain clearly evident in this little world that he had stumbled into.
“Come on, Draco! You’re a good-looking bloke. Surely there’s been one girl you’ve had your eye on” Harry says, evidently wishing to embarrass Draco more.
Greg, Vince and Theo were all in Ron’s economics class, and they formed a small study group where they would collaborate on essays and do projects together. As Theo and Harry were in English together, they also worked together often, discussing the merits of various texts. Much to his disappointment, Draco’s class were doing different set texts to Harry and Theo’s, and so he was largely unable to join in. Theo, Harry, Ron and Blaise also all did History, and the large number of subjects they had in common brought the group together often.
His mum, the sneaky woman she was, insisted on going back to his room with him to check everything was okay with Harry. He should have known she had ulterior motives.
“surely it’s my balls for breakfast he wants” laughed Harry, before Teddy lurched forward in his highchair and spat up milk and banana all over his shorts. “oh for fucks sake” muttered Harry, shucking off his shorts so he was left only in underwear and spelling them up to the laundry. “why don’t you just cast a cleaning charm?” asked Blaise. “you do live awfully muggle”
Oh god, I’m about to cry, this is so embarrassing. Harry slides his hands up and down my thighs.
“I’m afraid I can’t help much, and I can’t say I’m enamoured with the idea of Lucius banging down my door claiming that I’ve kidnapped his son, but I would love for you to stay with us.” Sirius said, before pausing, opening his mouth, shutting it, and opening it again.
Blaise smirks as me as if he’s doing me a favour, and not thoroughly humiliating me for the second time in half an hour, and I'm about to AK myself on the spot until...
He found Sirius and Harry sitting at the table as he came in and sat down. They smiled at him and wished him a happy birthday, and Sirius shoved a plate of scones and a card at him. The card was from his mother, and he smiled so wide his cheeks ached. He noticed the lack of a card from his father but chose to ignore it.
The shirt underneath was a lilac so pale it looked white from far away. It suited his dark skin, but he wasn’t sure how well a sparkly suit would be received at a school like this. he did look nice though, he thought. The colours were fun. Harry wasn’t a fan of wearing black after being forced into a tiny black suit to attend the funerals of his parents. It was too dark a colour for him, and he appreciated Luna’s equal love of colour.
updates won't be daily, but I wanted to post this second chapter just to get the story going a little bit
Luckily, they weren’t, and Harry and Draco were back downstairs and eating more cupcakes than was strictly healthy when Pansy and Blaise returned, laden with bags.
“Gin, I’m sorry, you know I love you like a sister, but not like that. Won't you let it rest? Has it not been too long?” Harry said, his gruff voice pleading.
Draco spoke of how his father made him spend the Saturdays and Sundays of primary school in extra tutoring, and so Draco never learnt how to make friends. He spoke of how isolated this made him; how, in secondary school, he turned to cruelty because he knew neither how to form nor maintain friendships and he was so jealous of those who could.
“Draco, the cottage is yours for forever if you want it. I’ll get Hermione to show you how to use UCAS if you're serious about this. If you want to go this year it would have to be a late application, which doesn’t guarantee a place, or you could go through clearing?” Sirius asked, saying a lot of words Draco vaguely remembered from year thirteen.
Sometimes Harry couldn’t fathom how different his life was now to how it was just a year ago.
After lunch, Draco retreated to his little cottage, desperate for a shower and a sit down before he inevitably returned to the house to hang out with Sirius. As he stood in the shower, the warm water cascading over his aching muscles from helping Remus move some sacks of feed the day before, he overheard voices again.
Draco nearly found himself agreeing, which was odd. Apparently a week in the countryside was enough to convert him to farm life. Instead, he nodded and said that he too was enjoying the peace.
“I am possibly even more unavailable now than I was the last time you stayed here, Blaise.” Harry laughed, collapsing onto the sofa next to Draco, who immediately put his socked feet in Harry’s lap.
When she opened her mouth to protest, he ploughed ahead rather than letting her voice her concerns.
Then Remus was hurrying Harry out of the door for more work and the conversation was over. Draco returned to his living room and tried to read but ended up over-analysing every facial expression Harry had made whilst Draco had spoken.
“Tell me, Harry, is it any of your business who I get with?” Hermione said, and Draco felt her tense beneath him.
Having finally tracked down the elusive desert, not wishing to return empty handed, Draco wandered into the hospital wing at 9pm, and saw Harry, broom free, head in Luna’s lap as she French plaited his hair. He looked so happy, despite the pain he must have been in, and Draco almost felt he couldn’t disturb the two, no matter how jealous he may have felt. Harry’s face broke into a grin when he saw Draco, tart in hand, and like a child on Christmas he reached out and made grabby hands, unable to sit up while Luna played with his curls.
Once there, instead of talking, Harry dug out a small tin from his pocket and sat on a log. He opened the tin and Draco was a little shocked to see him start rolling a joint. Harry did so expertly, and as annoyed as Draco was with the man it was annoyingly sexy.
Harry hated him for the pity writ across his face, and loved him even more for changing the subject so quickly.
“what the fuck, no. I don’t care who you sleep with Draco. I care when you bring strangers around Teddy” Harry was yelling now, seething.
I have never known real love, Draco. I would never take that away from you, never, ever begrudge you that, not matter who it may be with.” She smiled sadly at him, and Draco felt a tear escape his eye. His mum deserved better. So much better than his bastard of a father.
The longer she took, the longer Harry sat panicking at the kitchen table. He sent a Patronus to Molly to let her know that ‘something came up’ and asking her to keep Teddy a bit longer. After an hour, he couldn’t bear the silence or the stillness, and he forced himself to get up and start doing something, just to flood out the screaming silence inside his head. Of all the emotional turmoil Harry has been subjected to- and he had had more than his fair share- he had never experienced anything like this.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, wondering if he was finally to learn about Harry’s elusive past.
“Fittin ‘im near like a glove” Ron replied, as Harry shot a grin at Draco that made his insides tighten. It wasn’t fair for him to be so attractive, thought Draco. He barely gave Draco the time of day, so it was nonsensical for him to be getting Draco all wound up, and yet here Draco was.
“whatcha doing?” Harry asked, standing right behind Draco and leaning over Draco. His breath smelled of alcohol which should have been horrible but it just… wasn’t.
“not really. I feel relieved, though. I felt a perverse pleasure in watching the earth pile atop his coffin. I'm glad he’s gone.” Harry said, from where he sat on the edge of his bed, next to Draco.
“they don’t fancy you though” Draco mumbled, before heaving again.
Draco stared up into the darkness, pushing away all thoughts of Harry. He let the knowledge that he was back at Hogwarts, and safe, rock him into a deep, easy sleep. Free was enough, but now, at least by Potter, he was forgiven.
Draco was bloody cold. So bloody cold and he was shivering alarmingly violently. He had hoped Potter was asleep but was proved wrong when a deep voice, thick with sleep, rumbled from beside him; “come closer”
To his eternal astonishment, breakfast also included Harry turning his gaze on Draco and saying “what d’ya think of yesterday?” It was said with so little softness that Draco half expected Harry to follow up with ‘because you’re a posh little twat who has probably never been to something similar’ but he didn't.
It was a Thursday evening, and they were all gathered around the table they had commandeered for themselves in the corner of the common room in their building. They were all typing away at one essay or another, comparing notes or asking questions every now and then.
The door to their ensuite was shut, with plain blue towels hanging on the hook on the back of it. Harry went to the desk on Ron’s side of the room and picked up the chair, bringing it over to his own desk, and motioning at Draco to sit, before he rifled through his backpack and found his own French sheet and the Charlie and Lola pencil case that Draco had come to love.
“get the fuck out of my bed , Potter” Draco drawled, kicking the sleeping boy next to him, weirdly fearful of how the raved would respond.
Clearly hungover, and half dressed, Harry stumbled over his own shoes from the night before, and rolled onto his bed, not even bothering to get under the duvet, despite the Scottish September chill that had begun the permeate the air; warning of the winter to come.
Harry’s arms tightened around Draco and he shifted so his head was above Draco’s, Draco’s face buried in his neck. Draco had never felt so warm and safe.
The rest of the morning lasted in much the same manner. Harry would only speak if issuing instructions, and for the rest of it only the sound of their breaths and footsteps filled the air as they moved bags of feed for the chickens and did some health checks on the lambs. Hermione ate breakfast with them when they returned to the farmhouse at about ten, and then went home.
“You handled that very maturely. Who are you and what did you do with my best friend?” Pansy joked, her face turning serious when Draco turned to face her, a strained expression on his face belying his inner hurt.
“Okay Malfoy. Later though, I'm not too keen on an audience” Potter says from across the circle, winking at me, and I'm automatically hard.
“please, help yourselves” he gestured at the food, feeling tense and uncomfortable.
“the stars are too blurry. I can’t distinguish them” Malfoy spoke slowly, clearly trying not to slur his words. He looked lovely in the firelight with the night sky around him, thought Harry. So very, utterly lovely. Harry grinned at him and was delighted to get a grin in return, Malfoy’s straight teeth glowing.
I say, standing up and patting him briefly on the shoulder as I pass, his green eyes staring into nothing.
When he got close enough, Draco put a finger to his lips and pointed to Pansy, whose head was lolling on Draco’s thigh as she breathed softly and deeply. Harry grinned and nodded his understanding. His glasses were smudged and greasy, and the sunlight glinted off of them in a way that shouldn’t have been endearing.
Parkinson, Pansy. Granger, Hermione.
“I can stay back with you” Ron said, as he shouldered his school bag, ready to be driven back for the new term.
When Harry entered, Pansy tugged Draco’s arm so they both hung back.
She waited as they all assembled into groups, watching them all. She admired this group for how they had started to piece themselves back together after the war. She saw how Padma lay her head on Neville’s shoulder, and he put a protective, almost brotherly arm around her shoulders as he yawned. she saw how Pansy held Draco’s pale hand in hers, how Terry was helping Hannah move her bag over to her group.
“I know” replied Draco, grinning at her taken-aback expression, and pulling her into the kitchen. For the upteenth time that day, he smiled so hard his cheeks hurt when he saw a cake stood in the middle of the table.
Sirius sighed. “I had hoped Harry would be a friend to you, but unfortunately he seems to believe the poison in my family has spread to you- no offence”
To Draco’s parents, studying sciences or maths implied studying for a future vocation, such as medicine or engineering, and Malfoy’s didn’t work such menial jobs- they’ve always had enough money not to need to. Draco’s father had wanted him to study economics; ‘Draco my boy, people with money must understand money’, but Draco could think of nothing worse, and so had insisted that the class was full when he applied. Despite being governor, he knew his father would be unable to interfere so directly on his behalf without raising questions, and so Draco was safe for now.
Smeared with oil like David’s boy
“you can hold him normally if you want, but you look terrified so I figured this way would be easier. If you want to hold him against your chest, you have to have one hand cradling his head and neck, and one hand on his bum and lower back. He’s sleepy so he shouldn’t fidget much.” Said Harry, demonstrating the safest way to hold such a young baby.  Draco gingerly picked up the child, before nestling him into his chest and laying his pale cheek against Teddy’s head. “he’s so lovely” whispered Draco, in awe.
Not yet, but soon.
“It certainly didn’t seem like he liked me when he was waxing bloody poetic about not wanting anything serious and then fucking my ex not even a week later”
He made it to the next floor up but then heard the creak of the stairs. Shit. He would be seen by Cedric if he tried the second staircase now. He saw a maintenance cupboard at the end of the corridor and ran for it, pulling the door closed quietly behind him.
“What the fuck are you doing here, you bitch?” he asked, laughing as she squeezed her thighs even tighter around his abdomen.
On the drive home, he received a text from Harry that read
Surprisingly, Malfoy reached up to clasp his hand, and Harry hauled him up, shocked at how light the boy was, so frail and fragile. He resolved to make more of an effort with Malfoy that year, Hermione would call is his saviour complex but he couldn’t bear to see someone looking as under-fed as Harry had once been. The re-joined the group, and Harry tucked into his pot noodles with fervour, feeling ravenous after being used to Molly’s cooking and Hogwarts meals since the war. He and Ron then spent about half an hour building and lighting a bonfire, and by the time it was merrily crackling away the sky around them was pitch black and liberally splattered with glowing stars.
The driver of the car, a tall broad man who had picked him up from the station had said not more than three words to him for the whole journey. His phone had lost service five minutes into the drive so Draco had been left to stare out of the window, lamenting what his life had become; reduced to a lowly farm hand in the middle of nowhere surrounded by people with accents so thick he could barely understand them.
“Good to see you again, Harry. I wish it was in better circumstances. As you know, the court ruled that as the Dursley’s were your blood relatives, you are to be kept in the loop, as it were, with key information about them” here the lawyer took a deep breath.
“see, you understand what I’m doing, now Blaise, get off him so Potty can enlighten us on what happened last night with dray.”
“Pansy, if you could separate my ones from yours, and I’ll put them away when I get back”
The funeral was on a Thursday, and so he was at school that morning. As he and Ron were leaving to catch the train to London, Harry heard his name called. He turned to see Minerva, his strict yet kind hearted English teacher, who was apparently a friend of Sirius’, striding towards them.
I rejected him, I said that I didn’t like him, and now I’m crying like a child because he slept with someone. It’s not fair, he’s right. Fuck he’s just so right. I’m still looking right at him, but my eyes are unfocussed now.
Ah, but I’m singing like a bird ‘bout it now.
“I hate to impose, but would perhaps Pansy or Blaise be able to utilise your spare room at some point?” Draco tried to sound as polite as humanly possible. Harry looked up in confusion “there is no spare room set up Draco. I can do it this week though.” He said
Harry replied with
(Draco, 1:30pm)
Draco smiled. He hadn’t smiled sober in a long time. Once the food was eaten and Draco felt sick from the sugar, he felt Potter’s hand on his neck, gently coaxing him down until Draco’s head was in Potter’s lap, face turned towards the window. He felt Potter’s hand stroke though his hair, and he sighed happily. He felt Potter move and then felt a soft kiss on his cheek. He didn’t know anyone, let alone Potter, was capable of such gentleness, especially not towards someone who had done what Draco did.
“It wasn't the best, but you’re making up for it, and I didn't have many friends back home, I wasn't exactly the nicest person at school, so I’m used to entertaining myself, and there’s a lot of books here”
“THEY LOCKED YOU IN A CUPBOARD? THE FILTHY BASTARDS” Pansy yelled. Teddy started to cry, so Harry busied himself with that, turning away so Pansy didn’t see the emotion he felt at her being so angry on his behalf.
He had opened the little window of his bathroom to let the steam out, and he heard Ginny and Harry once again.
All Draco could think in that moment is ‘I want you’, so he just nods.
“I’m starting to think she won't ever get better” Sirius’ posher voice replied, laden with sympathy and sadness.
At Blaise’s insistence, the group of four teenagers opened a bottle of firewhiskey, and Harry put some music on.
“Hello, cousin” the man said as he reached the bottom of the stairs. He had a posh accent, a stark contrast to Remus’ Yorkshire broad. He gave Remus a chaste kiss on the cheek before leading them all into a large spacious kitchen with a long bench-like table stretched down the middle that could probably comfortably sit around fifteen people.
Hermione charmed a muggle speaker to work in our common room, and even I have to admit it’s quite brilliant. I envy muggles for the music they have access to. For some reason, though, the Gryffindor boys have such awful taste- who even is Kanye West and why is he so angry all the time? Though, I can hardly complain when Potter dances in his pyjamas with his friends. I don’t like it when Seamus smacks his arse, and then I catch them snogging in the loos an hour later, though. A deep, intrinsic thing reacts to it with a burst of archaic possessiveness.
“You know I also want you t’bugger off, Bryn, '' Harry said, prying Bryn’s hand off of his arm.  Bryn’s expression dropped imperceptibly before that awful smile was pasted back across his face. Harry started shifting on his feet and looked clearly uncomfortable. Ron stepped even closer, draping a freckled arm over Harry’s shoulder.
I want to break free
“Hope your mum is ok (: I can come round next week 4 project? H x”
“you looked like you needed company, Malfoy, you’ve been away with the fairies all day and I just wanted to check you were all right”
Dinner conversation started off easy; talking about the farm and plans for the upcoming summer. At a natural lull in the conversation the old woman, Effie Draco thought Remus had called her, turned to Harry and pinched his cheek and said “look at how big you’ve gotten James!”
“I’ll get Charlie to help set up a spare room for your friends Draco, he doesn’t go back to Romania for another week.” Harry said, kindly, which was more than Draco felt he deserved.
“I'm sorry I've been distant. I missed you” Harry said into Draco’s hair.
“I'm sorry I was so obvious. And it's okay, I know they understand more than I do, and you’re here now” Draco said, all his insecurity dissipating in the face of Harry’s presence, his earnest apologies.
“Hop in then lad” Ron said, climbing into the driver's seat of the vehicle, and Draco awkwardly struggled to get himself up to where the seats were, at least three and a half feet off the ground. Without even waiting for him to do up his seatbelt, Ron started driving.
“of course, mate. Anything. Hermione hasn’t gone back yet, she’ll be round at Sirius’ tomorrow to see you, yeah?”
At least Greg and Vince shared his perpetual bachelorhood, though. It was a small comfort.
“I really thought he’d come here to find us. God, he pisses me off so much sometimes.” she said, more to herself than to Draco.
“You shower first, yeah?” he said, as thanks for the reassurance.
“alright, Blaise?” asked Harry, grinning.
Turns out it was neither Remus nor Sirius with Harry. Instead, a very tall muscled ginger stood leaning against the wall, talking animatedly with Harry.
Harry then reached down and turned Draco’s bedside lamp off, and they were plunged into darkness.
“oh, Pansy” Harry whispered into her hair, rubbing his hand up and down her arm. She sniffled a bit, before saying,
“Just to see how well you’re all settling in. let me know if you need anything, Harry” Cedric said, eyes trained on Harry, still simpering pathetically.
The most striking was of Harry as an infant. He was held in the arms of a beautiful woman with rosy round cheeks and long curling red hair. Next to her stood a man who looked identical to Harry, yet his skin was just a few shades darker, an arm around the woman and smiling down at Harry. It must have been Harry’s parents, or ‘real’ parents, as it was clear that Remus and Sirius considered Harry to be a son, and Harry considered himself their son as well. They looked so happy and Draco wanted to know more than ever what had happened to them.
After what felt like ages, Pansy and Draco emerged. Draco was in black jeans and a sheer mesh black top, his hair artfully mussed. Pansy was a vision. She had obviously changed her mind from the dress she was in before, and this one left just as little to the imagination but it was a stunning glittering purple that went wonderfully with her sleek black bob. She was in black stilettos that looked impossible to walk in. on seeing him stare she winked and said “they’re charmed so they feel just like normal shoes and so that I don’t break my ankles.”
He walked in and rolled his eyes when he saw the teacher had made a seating plan. He would have thought they were old enough to be trusted with sitting by themselves. He sat down, alone in a middle row. The class started and seat next to his remained empty. He prepares for a year of bliss- sitting alone and being able to just get on with it without some stupid boy constantly asking him questions.
He handed Teddy over and slid a note under Draco’s door (the blond seemed to be avoiding him) simply saying Teddy was gone for the night if Draco wanted to bring someone back. He then went to get changed. Harry had a special drawer of ‘going out clothes’ that Ginny and Dean had helped him buy as the three navigated their novel and budding sexualities amongst the apocalyptic aftermath of the war. He wriggled into a dangerously tight pair of jeans (they were all dangerously tight, Ginny had been adamant) and a crisp white shirt, that he buttoned up only half-way, exposing the rich dark skin of his chest, and the circular scar of the locket. He swapped his glasses for contacts, and made his way downstairs. He realised too late that he hadn’t told Dean and Seamus that Draco was living with him, and came into the living room in the midst of a fierce staring competition. Harry rolled his eyes and ran to the two Gryffindors, enveloping them in crushing hugs. He then turned to Draco and said “Malfoy, Teddy is with your mum and Andy, so do what you want tonight. I will probably be back late.” Then he grabbed his mates’ hands and pulled them out the door.
(here he winked- winked!- at Draco and the blond felt his knees go weak)
Harry carefully lined his lash lines with Kohl. While makeup was typically seen to be a ‘gay’ thing for men, Kohl was worn by some Indian men, most notably for harry, his father. This made the ritual of getting ready extra special for Harry as he carefully applied the black cosmetic to his eyes. He then put in contacts, some lip-gloss and his face was done. Now the magic (pun not intended) happened. Harry braided small sections of his shoulder length curls, and clipped golden beads to the braids, so his hair seemed to glitter in the low light of clubs and bars.
Which is incidentally how I ended up getting with Luna. We were sat outside, and he kept trying to talk to me and use this awful nickname he came up with, so she climbed into my lap and kissed him to get him to fuck off.”
