The young man walked over and took a sit beside Draco. “So we are doing a covering up?” He asked in a thick American accent. Back Draco and Pansy stared at him for a moment before Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, there is a page right there.”
"It is alright. If you remember correctly, I didn't push you away. Nor did I stop it." He confessed.
He grinned. “I really should do it more often. It’s such an improvement.” He replied making her burst out laughing, as Harry sunk down in his chair. “I have a feeling toast and eggs weren’t worth it.” He muttered.
“Who said you could unpack my things?” Draco asked him, raising an eyebrow as he took a sip of the tea.
Draco smirked. “It goes in my eyebrow.” He told him, picking it up and placing it back into his brow. He turned around and moved back to his room. Harry took the scissors from Pansy, placing them back into the drawer before following Draco.
“Draco..” She whispered, biting her lip. “Draco.. is that you or your father talking?” She asked him.
“It’s fine Harry. Come have some breakfast.” She told him with a smile, motioning to the stack of toast and eggs behind her. He smiled. “Thanks.”
He remembered the outraged screaming, the spells flying overhead. His mother’s panic and worried expression, along with his father’s disgusted and frightful one. He didn't know what he had been thinking of at the time when he had thrown Potter his wand. He just wanted it over with. He was tired, emotionally drained and hollow. He couldn’t do it anymore. So he had thrown away his future, his friends, his education, all for what?  A gamble that stupid Saint Potter would be the end of it all, finally, once and for all. A gamble that he really didn’t believe would pay off.  A gamble that in the in the end cost him his home, friends, education, future and pretty much everything that he could remember.
It was towards the end of the next week that they started on the apartment. It was musty so he told Andromeda that he could do it himself if she just wanted to watch Teddy and do errands. She argued at first, but then relented letting Harry have his way.
“No, it seems like everyone got a letter.” She beamed at him. “Let’s celebrate! Get everyone together and meet at the pub?” She asked him.
Harry chuckled. “Had to do something. It was more for Sirius than for me, to tell you the truth. At first, I was just angry and then it sort of morphed into this challenge.” He chuckled, going into an in depth retelling of his first night at Grimmauld Place.
“I've tried to hide it so that no one knows, but I guess it shows when you look into my eyes.” He sang loudly, standing on the tip of his toes and pulling down a book to inspect it. “What you did and where you're coming from, I don't care, as long as you love me.”
Ginny looked up to say something but was interrupted by Ron doing a spit take. “WHAT?” He yelled, turning pale and looking like he was going to faint.
There was more whispering when they got off of the train at Hogsmeade station, not to mention Harry was practically bum rushed by the gaggle of girls that had been waiting, or more like stalking, outside his train compartment. They were all fawning over him and Harry was trying to be nice but just wanted to be left alone. Draco could see the irritation slowly rise on Harry's face before he moved in, parted the fan club like the red sea, and pulled Harry into the next available carriage. The dark haired man didn't miss the nasty looks the girls gave Draco as they took off.
“How have you been?” She asked him as he settled Teddy on his hip, bouncing him lightly as the toddler sucked on his thumb.
There was a pause. “Anyone else I should invite?” She asked. He frowned at her. “I’m not hosting a charity party for wayward Gryffindors.” He said pointedly. She smirked, looking away from him with a chuckle.
Draco stood there, mouth open in shock as his body went into complete shutdown. Pansy ran over to him, staring at him with large eyes. "What just happened?" She asked him, looking back to where Harry disappeared.
Two movies in, the blond was sound asleep on the couch under his blankets. Harry sat there, staring at him for the longest time. He looked sad and miserable. More than he had been at the party. He looked hollow… Harry bit his lip before getting up. He gathered him up into his arms, blankets and all, and carried him upstairs. He tucked him into the bed, making sure he was alright before leaning down and pushing his bangs back. What Ginny had said in the pub came back to him as he stared down at Draco.
“Because Pansy wanted to impress her little girlfriend, so she begged me to have this stupid party here.”
“What happened? What’s wrong?” He choked out, abandoning his tea completely as he moved to her side.
Draco snorted. "That's a million galleon question." He muttered. Pansy glared at him as she placed her jacket on. "Come on, we are going to miss the train."
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, taking the money from Draco and flattening it out. “ None of your business Potter.” He glared at Harry as the other placed the money in the slot and the checking machine went silent. It spit out his change and his receipt within seconds.
"Are you sure you are alright with this?" Harry asked him. Draco nodded. "It's fine, Harry.. I knew this was coming.." He sighed.
Harry gave one last sigh and pulled up his sleeve, exposing his forearm. Pansy choked on her coffee, coughing loudly before finally able to breath properly. "Have you lost what bloody sense you have left Potter?!"  She hissed at him.
Harry just shrugged and the conversion just died between them and they rode in silence the rest of the way.
“We don’t have time for impossible questions. Just don’t freak out.” She told him. He frowned at her. “I am not going to freak out.”
Harry had dismantled most of the stove, figuring out what was the problem by the time the takeaway arrived. Pansy called Draco down, sitting out two plates and opening containers. Draco came running down the stairs, dressed in nothing but boxers and a band shirt.
“Make your own dinner, the muggle things don’t bite.” He said, turning off the stove and pulling Pansy out of the kitchen. “Let’s go.”
“I don’t know who the fuck I am, Pans.” He yelled, turning around to stared at her. “I just know that I have a chance now. To do something. To redeem the Malfoy name.” He hissed crossing his arms.
Ginny grinned at her, tucking her red locks back behind her ear shyly. Hermione shook her head. “Never mind, I don’t want to know.” She held up her hand.
“Yeah, just really drunk.” He chuckled, staring down into his cup. “Do you think things will ever change?” He asked her out of the blue.
Pansy watched him for a few moments, still not sure. After nothing seem to happen to the other, she grabbed a fork and joined him.
He sighed before using the fireplace in Kingsley’s office to floo to Hogwarts. Which was a weird experience in itself. He arrived in the headmistress’s office, looking at the portraits along the wall before McGonagall looked at him over the rim of her glasses. “Potter, I was told why you were here and the circumstances around why you are here. Why should I let Mr. Malfoy back in this school?” She asked him.
“If you need anything, just text or ring me.” He told him, moving out of the room. “I will.” Draco told him. Harry turned back, walking over to him and fishing something out of his pocket. “Here.” He said, placing a wad of muggle money into his hand before leaving. Draco stared at his hand in complete shock.
“*Sleep little baby, try not squawk. Tomorrow and tomorrow you’ll learn how to walk. To love and laugh, to toddle and talk, but for now beddy-byes.” He sang in a frustrated, lofty voice that Harry recognized from school.  He bit his lip to keep from laughing before inching closer and watching the blond.
“I didn’t think it was a secret.” Harry said, fixing his cup before leaning opposite of him. “I’ve known for weeks. Parkinson is alright… I mean, we haven’t talked at any length but I’ve seen her around Ginny and she’s nice.” Harry turned looking over at Ginny and Ron, having a domestic in the sitting room.
She hesitated for a moment before reaching out and taking a quill from her ink well. She signed a piece of parchment before drying the ink with her wand. She placed it into an envelope, sealing it before handing it over. “Give this to Kingsley.” She told him as Harry took the letter.  She produced another one that was labeled. “Give this one to Mr. Malfoy.” Harry took the letter and placed both of them inside his hoodie pocket.
"Get to bed." Draco told him, lightly shoving his shoulder. Harry's eyes flickered to the bed behind him. "I don't know if I can sleep.." He admitted after a moment.
“Of course.” She said, shaking it off. “They broke up.” She snipped. He opened his mouth to say something as his mother came around the corner. He jumped off the counter, quickly straightening his shirt.
"What the bloody fuck Ginny?" Harry asked after she had locked the compartment door and pulled the blind.
Draco moved down the train hallway, looking into windows to try to find where Harry had gone. Every time he only was met with the nastiest looks. He adverted his eyes, taking a shaky breath each time before continuing on. He had gotten halfway down the train when he was hit with a spell, knocking him off his feet. He fell hard, letting out a loud groan as the wind was knocked from him. He shook the disorientation off, lifting his head to see some Gryffindor (he was already in robes) standing over him, wand raised high.
"Come on, let's get this over with Dawson's Creek." Chris told him, looking over at Draco, staring at the blond's ass. Harry grit his teeth before shoving off the counter. "Put your eyes back in their sockets prick." He growled, walking into the back. Chris blinked, turning back to look at Harry a bit shocked.
"I know, but we're at school now and …" He trailed off as Harry chuckled. "Draco I told you, nothing is going to change."
So, after this chapter, I think we will check in on Draco. Lovely Draco. Then probably time skip about a month or two after that. Harry's drinking will get worse. Also there will be more (heavier and detailed) mentions of wolfstar. But Oblivious Harry is Oblivious. Also, I am not British and only have a limited British vocabulary, so if there is something I got wrong please tell me. Also thank you so much for the Kudos! I love them so much!
“What do you want Harry? Chicken noodles or shrimp?” He asked, turning to look at the other. The name leaving a weird feeling on his tongue and a fluttering sensation in his stomach.  The sound of his name startled him as he stood up, making him slip as he turned towards the blond. He landed on his ass with a yell as Draco watched him with a twitching smirk. “The savior of the Wizarding World everyone.” He deadpanned.
She chuckled. “Potter left them here. Ginny said that he was so drunk he walked home in swim shorts and trainers.”
“Well don’t look at me Potter, I am just a messenger. You should really sort out your affairs before galivanting off to do weird Muggle things.” He snarled, some of the angry that he had for Pansy boiling over the surface.
“Am I to believe that you got into Hogwarts and allowed us to get off probation early without any help?”
He shook his head, pulling his hand back. Maybe he had gone finally mental. He was just so tired of people,
The line that starts with 'its like your screaming' comes from the opening of Rihanna's We found Love. I just couldn't stop thinking about it and well it fits!!
The Aurors turned and looked at Pansy in her short skirt, heels and designer blouse. "Follow me." She said, leading the lot into the house before going up to Draco's room. It was small in comparison to the house with large windows over looking the garden. It had a reading nook in one of the windows near the oak four poster bed. She moved to the trunk sitting spilled over on its side and started to sift through the contents, much to the displeasure of the Aurors.
IMPORTANT MESSAGE: I am so sorry, it's been a while since I've updated. I was supposed to only be gone for four days for a end of spring break camping trip but ended up spending the entirety of my spring break in the hospital and on major pain meds because of kidney stones. I passed one but I still need to pass another. If I don't then I have to get another xray because then it might be a cyst. I'm off pain meds as of rn, so yay! I can write! I have been wanting to get this out for weeks now!  It's been sitting on my laptop unfinished since like the 9th.
After promising Andromeda that he would come by again, Harry had gone to the DIY Centre and picked a few things up, before heading back to his home. He made something to eat before mapping out what he wanted to do with everything.
“Ginny I’m just-“ He started but Harry interrupted him. “What does it matter Ron? Like seriously? Why does it matter? It could be worse. Pansy isn’t that bad. Actually she’s quite nice. She made a mistake. Everyone’s made a mistake. Just like that time when you stringed Lavender along when you actually was gagging for Hermione.” He said, making George choke on his drink while Ginny burst into giggles.
Harry had stopped to get something to snack on while he waited for the address and was eating chips when his mobile beeped. He read off the address before looking around. He wasn’t that far from it actually, nor did the other live far from himself. He shoved the rest of the chips into his mouth before replying that he would be there in a bit and headed off. When he arrived at Malfoy’s house, he spotted the other hanging out of his window, smoking. He stopped right before his garden gate, watching him.  He noticed how his lips held the cigarette by themselves, emitting small puffs of smoke. How he was staring off in the distance as if it held all the answers he was searching for. He licked his lips before shaking his head, hitching the shopping bag up higher on his shoulder.
“Say it.” Draco told him, moving closer. “SAY IT! I know you want to.” He yelled, shoving him. “It’s because of me. People are dead because of me and I should be rotting in a prison because of it.”
Draco rolled his eyes at that, moving back to the sink and turning off the water. “You don’t know what you are talking about.”
Pansy smirked, looking away as a very flustered Draco unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged it off. It was Chris’s turn to become flustered, which made Draco feel a little better about the many scars on his body. He showed Chris his mark and the other nodded, getting started.
"That you have lost your bloody mind, that's what." Draco said, pulling away and crossing his arms. "I'm going to get blamed for this. Granger and Weasley, oh Weasley will be beside himself." Draco ranted as the other watched him.
“It’s from Hogwarts.” She stated, looking up worried when she saw the seal. She tore it opened, reading the first few lines of the letter before reaching behind her and falling into the desk chair.
“No.” He said as he heard his mother’s heels on the stairs. They both were quiet until they heard the master bedroom door close.
“Malfoy, a spout is  for your sink.” He said, laughing a bit.  “It helps water come out. It has nothing to do with your stove.” He looked up at him with a smile.
Pansy coughed to cover up the laugh she couldn’t hold in. Draco’s head snapped to her. “Traitor.” He whispered to her. She broke down a bit, laughing softly. “You bought a spout..” She muttered, covering her face with her hands.
I'm pretty sure everyone can see what Pansy is planning to do.... Who else could get under Harry Potter's skin like a Malfoy? XD
Draco looked over the bright colors and the openness of the room. He smiled slightly, feeling calm for the first time since his father came back home. He hugged himself tightly before turning to look at the other. Harry had picked up the bottle of bourbon before twisting the top off.
“Take care of Pansy for me while I’m gone.” She told him as she stopped right in front of him. He scoffed. “Like that was ever a question.” He rolled his eyes. She smirked, leaning up and whispering, “Take care of Harry too.” She patted him on the shoulder before walking away. Draco jerked around looking at her bewildered.  He turned back, looking at Harry, his brows knitted together in confusion.
Your music for this chapter is 'Light a Fire' by Rachel Taylor, 'I'll be Good' by Jaymes Young and 'Scars' by Boy Epic. All and some new songs can be found on the spotify playlist.
Draco gave a chuckle, shoving the other away from him. “You are really damaged Potter.” He said, shaking his head but couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation.
He kind of was glad that nothing had changed between him and Malfoy. The other didn’t tip toe around him, or act like he was pathetic. He didn’t even act like he owed Harry anything for what he had done at his trial. It was refreshing. Hermione was right, he had been the most lively then he had been in a while. Might have been that and the glimpses that he had caught of Malfoy, the king of composure, tripping up. Muggle life had been good to the other.
A moment later, a knock came to her door. She groaned, cuddling closer to Ginny. “Sleeping!” She called out with a huff.
Pansy bit her lip, trying to keep the laugh in but couldn’t stop the smile on her face. Of course that’s what Potter would think.
Harry had been home for a few hours from the garage when Ginny appeared from the Floo and into his kitchen. He looked up from his take away, raising an eyebrow. “Hi.”
“Where is he?” He asked, taking a sip from the mug as his mobile started to ring. “Can you grab my pants?” He asked her, grabbing for his glasses and putting them on. She raised an eyebrow before getting up and picking his jeans from the floor. “What did you and Draco do last night?” She smirked. “Nothing.” He said, taking his jeans and pulling his phone from the pocket.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Sirius asked, shocked. “Because it’s you and Remus. Pads and Moons. You can’t have one without the other. I thought maybe you were just having trouble adjusting or something and you guys would be okay again..”
"I did." Draco said, closing the journal and holding it out. "Your godfather right?" He asked. "It's talking about your godfather right?"
Draco looked over the tattoo with wide eyes, not believing what he was seeing. "It's not my best work, he kept moving. Unlike you." Chris told him.
“So do I, but I have a friend that might get a kick out of this headline.” He told her with a smile, paying for his purchases. She smiled at him before handing over the bag and Harry hurried out. He started to get paranoid that people were starting to notice who he was and skipped out on going to the joke shop. He headed back home, dropping off his purchases and sorting through them. He placed the letters and Draco’s wand in the same place as the vials of Remus’s memories, sealing it up again.
We've had Harry's thoughts on the matter, Draco's thoughts on the matter, know it's time for Pansy's thoughts on the matter. Also more of Draco is clueless about muggle things.
"Jesus kid." He chuckled. "I can't ink you if you don't know what you want." He turned to look at Harry. "I'm only doing this as a favor to that feisty blond out there. Just like singing at your party."
Draco was a bit suspicious when Pansy came over, relaying an message from his aunt. He had been talking to her through Owl over the last couple of days, ever since she had finally came over to help his mother. He knew about his cousin, but had yet to meet the toddler. Andromeda had shown him pictures and told him stories, making him curious, but yet he hesitated.  He didn’t know why, but he just felt like he didn’t belong. He was the reason why the boy had no parents. It didn’t feel right to come into his life as if nothing had happened.
The idea had been appealing and Harry was all for giving it a go. He had kind of missed being a nobody and a vacation from the Wizarding World sounded brilliant right now. That statement alone though seemed to have really shut Molly up and she relented, not even making a fuss about George leaving for Romania that same day.
Harry waited patiently before Chris left them alone to ring up Harry. Draco looked over the tattoo again, staring at it transfixed. "Why did you do this?" He asked, motioning to his arm. Harry shrugged his shoulders.
Harry moved into the room, seeing the title of the book. “That’s a good one.. I’ve read it, but personally Gone with the Wind is a better movie than a book. If you like Austen and Carol, then try Hemingway or Bronte. I know he has a few Shakespeare novels up there, too.  Also Perks of being a Wallflower is a nice novel but not really a classic one. I would say Phantom of the Opera, but I liked the play better.” Harry ranted, making Draco jump.
Harry looked away, not sure how to approach the subject again. “God why is this so hard?” He muttered to himself. He stood there for a long time just watching as Draco ate his soup, the blond tensing a bit when he moved his forearm a bit wrong.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm stealing this, and wearing it." He told him as he flopped down on Draco's bed.
Ginny had been acting a bit strange since her date with Pansy, looking at him strangely as if she wanted to tell him something, but couldn’t. Every time he asked her about it, she changed the subject but still looked extremely worried. Ron hadn’t been that bad since both he and Hermione had shut him down. He even seem to be warming up to the idea that Ginny was with Pansy though he still thought they were friends. The subject never really came up until Dean and Seamus invited him, George, Ginny, Ron and Hermione out for drinks that second day. Harry had been hesitant about accepting, but George talked him into it with a convoluted escape plan if he needed it.
Harry frowned at him before leaning down. He grabbed hold of Draco's chin, holding it tightly as he kissed the blond's lips lightly. Ron squawked like a dying bird as Pansy gasped from the doorway. Draco wanted to pull back, feeling the frown forming on his lips before his body moved for him, kissing him back, eyes screwed up in confusion. Harry didn't pull back until he heard the sound of floo and Ron had left.
So sorry It took forever to update! I've been home from convention for a week now, but I had some school stuff to take care of so that kinda ate into my editing time. Also the Chrome update threw me because begone you damn black border boxes!
“Of course she bloody fucking did.” He spat. “I miss when she could keep her mouth shut about everything.”
"Fine." Ron finally said as Ginny sat down. Hermione leaned over and kissed his lips. "How was everyone's first night back?" She asked.
“Draco!” Pansy called, smiling at him as he walked over. “Finally joining us?” The small group turned and the reactions made him smirk. Seamus spat his beer out in shock as Dean coughed and shifted. Longbottom just looked shocked while Luna pulled her pink glasses up onto of her head and whistled softly.
Harry nodded, walking over to her as he opened the journal. He stopped at the page with the letter to Teddy, handing it to her. She shook her head, pushing it back to him. “I don’t want to read it.”
“Call me if you need anything..” She told him, leaning down and pecking him on the cheek. He gave her a tight smile before nodding. “I will.”
He turned back to look at Harry. He had looked so exhausted when he had arrived, almost dead on his feet. He was snuggled up to his pillow, snoring slightly as he slept. Draco leaned down, moving his fringe off his forehead and looked at his scar. How did his life get this fucked? He let the fringe fall from his fingertips before biting his lip. He reached over, removing the lipstick smudge that Pansy had left earlier. He moved closer to him, lifting his arm before snuggling close to his chest. He placed his arm down around him, burying his face into his shirt. Harry pulled him close in his sleep, burying his face into his hair with a puff of contentment.
“You were the one stalking me! You’ve been completely obsessed with me!” Draco yelled, stepping closer to Harry in his anger.
“Are you ever going to tell me what happened?” She asked as her mobile went off.  Draco rolled his eyes. “I went to buy the stupid thing and Potter was there of all people, and was being a complete prat!” He growled.
Harry caught the bag. “Malfoy, wait!” He called after him with a sigh. When the other one didn’t turn back, he moved back to the checking machine and grabbed his change.
“So assuming from Malfoy’s reaction, you haven’t told him about us all hanging out all this time?” She asked. Ginny sighed. “Just like how you haven’t told Ron?”
“You only have two months left of probation. What point is there to leave you out of Hogwarts?” He asked, moving closer.
“Oh, don’t even get me started on you!” He yelled at Lily, who looked like a deer in headlights. “If you could just let go of your pride for five seconds we wouldn’t be in this mess!”
Ginny bit her lip, looking down at her feet before looking back up as George sighed. “Hurry up and go, we will handle Mum.” He told Harry.
Draco walked into his room, having yet to run into . He found Pansy in his room, talking on the mobile with Ginny. “Where is everyone?” He asked her. “Your father went to the ministry for a probation meeting and your mother is still asleep.” She said before telling Ginny she had to go. She hung up before turning to him.
She looked away. “They added more time at the Probation hearing today. They feel that your father hasn’t been reformed these last few months. The visit to my cousin reflected negatively on us and they thought a little more time might help.” She explained.
“What more can I do to put a stop to this mind numbing noise you are making?” He sang, nuzzling the child. “I don’t know what else I can do to try to hush you. My heart says ‘I love you’ but my brain is thinking ‘fuck you.’  And hoping a child trafficker will abduct you at least then I’ll get a few hours in bed.” He sang almost pleading as Teddy wailed.
Draco nodded. "Why are you going back to school if you already have a job you wanted while you were there?" He asked him.
Harry placed it securely inside his hoodie with all the letters he had collected. Leaving the Ministry, Harry headed towards Diagon Alley to buy his things for school. He still had his robes and other things, he just needed books and  potion ingredients.
“I appreciate the party and everything… but it just made me depressed… Don’t tell Hermione..”  He said downing the rest of his beer.
Harry spent the next two days in and out of the Burrow. He spent time with Charlie and Oliver, talking about Romania and playing quidditch out in the yard. He spent time just talking with George, laughing and testing out new magic products. These little individual hangouts helped ease his anxiety a bit.
"Bollocks! Sod off, you literally came in here and attacked me." Draco said, furious as he peered around Harry at the redhead.
“Are you wearing my shirt Malfoy?” He asked, tilting his head. Draco looked down as if he forgot what he was wearing and crossed his arms. “Pansy mixed it up with my wash.” He said defensively.
She gave him a squeeze before letting go. “Let’s go. Chris’s band will be playing in a bit and I must slay the “muggle Firestarter” for your mum.”
, but without the kitten it was kind of boring actually. Granger’s personality was as dry as a piece of toast. Even though the whole thing with Ginny was a bit of a weird thing in itself. After being shunned, ignored or just completely talked to with hurried fake politeness, it had been so refreshing to find someone that hadn’t given a bloody fuck what she said or how she came across to Pansy.  That brutal honestly had been the wake up call she had needed to get her own shit together, and in turn help Draco get his shit together before he turned in the looney case that was Potter.
“Wait.. do you want to come stay here?” He asked her. “Draco said something about things being bad at home and not wanting to go back.” He said before he caught himself.
Draco was woken up by ragged breathing and someone moving him. He blinked, staring at Harry unsure of what was happening. He rolled over, turning on the lamp before turning back to Harry. The other was bent over, holding his head. He was whispering, ‘no’, over and over.
“You’ve been at my work, my shop, my café  all while I was there!” Harry accused. “Seems like stalking to me.” He said his voice angry but his facial expression didn’t match his voice.
“My family doesn’t care about he-“ Her words died out in shock as she stared at the other’s bare back. She bit her lip before looking pointedly away, shoving her things into her backpack as Pansy pulled on the clean shirt.
They were soon joined by Ginny, Hermione and a very begrudgingly Ron. "Harry must you smoke those?" Hermione asked with a frown, waving away smoke from in front of her face.
Harry burst out laughing when he left, walking over and fixing everything that Malfoy had wrecked trying to turn off the radio.
“Watch it Malfoy.” Harry snapped back. “It’s not my fault that you can’t come up with a better excuse than that to see me.”
Narcissa smiled tightly at her son, not getting too close to the muggle appliances. “Thank you Pansy. You are such a dear.”
“I don’t want to hear it Ronald.” Ginny said with a frown. “Frankly, I don’t want to hear it either.” Harry muttered, making Ron blinked. “When did you get here?”
Harry frowned, shifting a bit as he opened his eyes but didn’t turn to look at the redhead. “Is it because of what happened at dinner last night? Mum… she was just trying to help…” Ron trailed off.
Pansy smirked. "Going back to Hogwarts will be like feeding Draco to shark infested waters. You can't be a Gryffindor going into this. You have to come at this with a Slytherin mindset."
Harry chuckled, choking a bit on his coffee. “I’m already Uncle Harry so that ship has already sailed.”
“Teddy, please! I am coming back!” Andromeda sang from somewhere else in the house as the small infant cried from his bassinette swing. Harry smiled and walked over to the baby, setting his bag down. He leaned down cooing at him, making the baby giggle and the bit of hair he had changed to bright blue. He picked him up, blanket and all, and held him close to his chest. He hummed, rocking the baby back and forth getting him to stop his fussing.
That was a very long one for you guys. Thank you so much for the Kudos and comments. Please do continue to comment!
“I have to meet Hermione and Ron for lunch, but I should be back by no later than dinner so if you want you can order a takeaway.”  Harry told him.
“Yes, her and your father are back.” She hugged him tightly. “Eat some breakfast before heading back.”
“You’re bloody fucking insane.” Draco called after him, hanging over the railing. Harry laughed, jumping down and hurrying off.
“Because he knows better.” Harry said, kissing Teddy’s forehead as the baby cuddled closer to his chest. Andromeda walked over to the stove and sat to work putting a kettle on. “How have you been?” She asked him lightly.
“I went to check on him this morning.” She told him, making Harry turn even more red. “Yeah.. I can explain..” He said a bit uncomfortable.
“No, I’m here to see George, but I thought I would ask since the last thing I kind of remember is talking to you.”
She looked at him pointedly over her shoulder, taking down the chocolate biscuits. She moved to the cupboard and took down two mugs. “You didn’t have to. You could have just washed your hands of all this madness.” She told him. “Milk or Honey?”
“I’m sure Remus has a lot of things that belong to your parents and photographs and such.” She shrugged. “I really haven’t moved or looked at anything so I don’t know what is there.”
“Oh that is complete shit, Potter and you know that.” He spat. “I know that the only reason you are here is because Pansy told your little Weaslette shit because she can’t keep her mouth shut.”
There was no answer. After a few moments of silence, Draco turned to see if Harry was still there only to see him climbing up the trellis just like Weasley had done.
“Dyed hair, piercings, tattoos and muggle clothing.” Harry answered George before turning to the couple in front of him. “When did this happen?” He asked, shocked.
“Malfoy!” He called, dropping down next to him. Draco looked blue and his eyes were unfocused. Harry grabbed his face, turning it towards him. “Draco, breathe. Focus on me. Breathe.” He said, his voice strong and steady. The shock of hearing his name from Harry was enough to snap him out of it. He took a deep breath, scrunching his nose at the smell. “The… That smell..” He choked out. “Get rid of it.” He hissed.
. He had yet to have another episode like the one in the shower. Pansy came and visited him or talked to him through the floo, staying at his house in Camden by herself. It was apparently taking a while to convince his mother to come back to London, and Andromeda had already almost hexed his father quite a few times.  At this point, he was about to give up on his mother ever coming home and his father ever taking responsibility for his actions, instead of blaming him or someone else.
Draco scoffed. “Why would I want to swim? Especially with all these people.” He frowned, dipping the other foot into the water.
Pansy pursed her lips as she sat the glass down. “I’m dealing with pretty much the same thing on my end.”
“Me and Pansy are about to leave!” He called back. “Oh, Pansy dear would you mind making Dinner? I can’t start the muggle Firestarter.”
“I was hoping, with the party, that Harry would realize that everyone is still there for him and that with it I would try to bring some normalcy back into our lives. We could also use it to bring the two together and maybe this time it might stick?” She drew out the last word into a question, biting her lip as she looked up at the dark haired woman.
Andromeda chuckled. “Nice work on Harry’s face. It really goes to show that you can make your point even in the muggle way.”
“You don’t have to. But do try to be civil. If you make a scene, both your sister and your girlfriend will kill you.” He told him.
Lily gave him a smile. “Don’t worry about it. Black is a wanker, but I do want to see Remus happy.. and it’s been a while since he was.”
“Not particularly.” Draco muttered, pushing his food around. “You don’t have to if you-“ Harry started but was cut off the other. “Cut the bullshit, Potter.” He snapped before pausing. “My father drinks bourbon.”
He gave a chuckle, putting down the cup before he spilt any liquid. “As well as one can be when your parents abandon you in a muggle house.” He said snidely.
He nodded, finally catching sight of Harry. “Morning..” He muttered, turning a bit pink before hurrying over to the stove.
“I know Pans, but you don’t have to worry about me. I’ll be alright, I have to live with my decisions.” He said quietly, turning all his attention on perfectly painting her nails.
Andromeda hurried around the corner, concerned but stopped in her tracks at the scene before her. She let out a relieved breath and smiled gently as Harry softly sung to the baby. Harry looked up and gave her a small smile. It always shocked him to see Andromeda, as she always looked so much like Bellatrix it was unnerving. Her dark brown hair was falling out of a hastily done up bun, her faded and bleached out tshirt hanging off one shoulder and covering up most of her leggings. She looked tired and wore out, dark circles underneath her eyes.
The next photo was one that look like James and Peter were helping Sirius serenade a bandaged and blushing Remus in the Hogwarts courtyard.  He raised an eyebrow but just shrugged it off. He smiled at the photo of his parents in Christmas sweaters and his dad with an antlers headband atop his head. He never knew his dad was such a nerd. Antlers? Really Dad? His mother seems to echo that thought as she rolled her eyes in the photo but still smiled.
Once he was packed he and Ron slowly brought his trunk down the stairs. He peeked around the corner to see that all the commotion was taking place in a far corner of the sitting room. Molly had her back to them as George yelled over Ginny’s loud sobbing, covered in something green and nasty as the rest of the family circled around them. George got louder when he caught sight of Harry and Ginny shoved him, smearing the green slime on his face. This resulted in a terribly fake but convincible enough fist fight that completely distracted Molly from everything else.
Draco caught it too the moment the words left his mouth. Potter’s eyes had gone big, his mouth slacked and he seem to not breath for almost a  minute afterwards. He pulled back, his eyes dropping to the floor and the cocky bit of arrogance that he had a second before was gone.
Pansy gave a chuckle and Hermione seemed to relax a bit. “Draco and Potter are more fitted for each other than I thought.” She shook her head. “Thanks Kitten.” She leaned over, giving Ginny a kiss on the cheek before putting her sunglasses back on. Ginny turned a bit red, looking away. She watched as Harry pulled himself out of the pool, wringing out Draco’s flannel shirt before making his way back into the house.
Dean and Seamus burst out laughing. “So that’s why we can’t go back to Kimchee To Go.” Hermione said with a frown. “I really liked that place.”
“Draco!! Are you even paying attention to me?!” Pansy scoffed at him, slapping his arm and breaking him from his thoughts. She had been chatting along, doing her nails as she sat on his carpet and he sat on a bean bag chair next to her.
“Mother broke Parole and went to stay with her cousin in  Scotland.” He said evenly, even though his movements were jerky.
Pansy turned to Hermione and smirked, giving her a knowing smile. Hermione looked completely shocked and stared at Pansy. “Was that your plan? To have them try to kill each other?” She hissed.
“I know that he might not ever be happy,” She whispered to them, “but I do want him to not be hurting anymore.”
Ginny and Hermione started to giggle at that. “He’s not lying.” Ginny said with a smirk. “Apparently I can’t win this.” Dean said before sitting back in defeat.
Harry frowned. "It's not like I have the dark mark on my arm. I have a serpent, the symbol of Slytherin House wrapped around the Sword of Gryffindor, which symbolizes the Gryffindor House."
Draco leaned over the kitchen sink, waiting for the water to turn warm, biting his lip against the stinging pain from another botched attempt to remove the mark from his arm. It was one of the reasons why he hadn’t gotten into the pool at all. The chlorine stung worse than anything he had ever felt in his life. He was leaning over the sink when he heard the sliding glass door open and close.
Draco gave a nod, reaching up and pulling her into a tight hug. “Thank you…” He whispered, muffled against her sweater.
Harry’s mobile rang around 1 am. He quickly answered it, making sure that it hadn’t woke up Draco. The blond was asleep, snuggled into his side with his head tucked in the crook of his shoulder and chest.
…’ He thought as he stood in front of the fireplace, grabbing a handful of floo powder. He chuckled a bit at that. ‘
He settled back, sitting down on the floor crossed legged and placed the box carefully in his lap. He sifted through the contents curiously. It was mostly trinkets, yellowing letters on muggle paper and a few photos. He pulled the photos out, sitting the box and the rest of its contents aside. There were a bunch of Remus… maybe when he was in Hogwarts. He looked really young. His scars weren’t really scars but more of fresh abrasions. One photograph was a moving photograph where Remus was laughing and it made his heart clenched.
“Wear the silver stilettos.” He answered, staring at the ceiling.  He hadn’t really did or said anything the entire day, just stayed cooped up in his room the entire time.
“He said to order takeaway, not make a meal like some housewife.” She hissed at him, tossing the package aside before whacking him back. Draco turned back to her, glaring daggers before going back to stirring. “Just put the sauce in.”
He shoved the letter into his pocket, moving to the floo. He arrived to an uproar in the Burrow. He walked out to see Molly crying, Ginny dancing around cheering, Ron completely red-faced and shocked and Hermione beaming.
“Breath Harry.. it’s alright. You don’t need the answers right now. You have a plenty of time to decide. You don’t need to go back if it is going to be this hard. No one would blame you. And if they do, tell them to come see me.” She smirked, winking at him before folding the letter up. He chuckled.
“When was the last time you called him Moony to his face?” She asked him. “Or,” She paused, “when on a date?” She shrugged. “Kissed him, held his hand, was anything other than remotely distant to him?”
“Where is Ginny?” He asked her, moving back to the kettle and turning the eye off on the stove. He grabbed his tea before turning and ushering her up the stairs to the foyer.
“The brilliant chosen one everyone.” Draco smirked. Harry shoved him, turning red. Draco grinned, smirking wider. “They probably wouldn’t even do it if you ask them to.” He said, jokingly.
"You don’t have to do this, you know?" Draco told him, biting his lip and playing with his piercing.
Ginny took mercy on Draco and moved over, sitting down next to him. "You don't have to say here if you don't want to. Harry gets an idea in his head and he doesn't think." She told him with a smile.
She jerked out of her thoughts when her mobile beeped again, Granger telling her that Potter would be there soon. Draco was going to kill her.
“Go away Potter.” He hissed, annoyed. Harry stood there, biting his lip and rocking back and forth on his heels wanting to do something but holding back. Draco turned to look at him. “What do you want?” He snapped. Harry seem to take that as an open invitation to move. He grabbed a clean dishrag and shoved it under the tap.
He let a small smirk cross his lips as he looked him over. “Nice pants.” He commented, making Draco’s face twinge a bit of pink. “This is my house, Potter. I can do whatever I want. Why are you here? We could have fixed it!” He spat at him.
Pansy nodded. “I’m not leaving you here alone…” She insisted. “Maybe you can go live with Andy.. She offered..”
Ron looked them over before rolling his eyes. "I'll be in our compartment." He told Hermione before stalking off.  The whispering that had been only a faint buzz, got louder with Ron's departure.
“I’m so happy you are back.” George laughed, pulling Harry into a hug. He tensed up for a moment before hugging the other back tightly. “Same here. I missed you.”
It really had boosted his spirits, considering he was not at all confident in his new muggle clothing. They were nothing much more than ripped up rags in his opinion. Why did Muggles even wear this garbage?
He had nothing to look forward to. Everyone was going to leave him here. Barely able to keep it together. He didn’t know how he was supposed to survive this. He climbed out of his window onto the tiny balcony. He sat down, settling into the back corner. He pulled his legs to him, taking out a cigarette. After a long drag, he tilted his head back and blew out the smoke slowly, letting the tears finally fall. This was his life now..
“Yeah.” She said, looking down at her tea. “There is something else that I wanted to talk to you about.” Her voice and face turned serious.
Ginny and Hermione had popped by one night when he was completely pissed. He didn’t really remember what they had said or what had happened. More like snippets of conversations and faces. Faces that pitied him. He was pathetic, he knew that, he didn’t need anyone else to baby him and remind him of it. He resented the entire event and drunk more heavily. That sort of stopped when he forgot to visit Andromeda, making her worry and Teddy cry for him all that day. She gave him a stern talking to, cutting him deep. He pulled back on the drinking a bit, and spent most of his time at the garage, fixing up his motorbike. Now that his house was basically finished, he really didn’t have anything else to keep him busy on the days he wasn’t at Andromeda’s.
“Is that Weasley climbing down my garden trellis?” Draco asked as he walked towards his house with Harry. Harry’s brows knitted, staring as the redhead scaled the side of the blond’s house. “Um.. Yeah, that’s Ginny.” He moved to stand under her path. Draco stood there watching the two.
Draco smiled softly, hugging his shirt and him close, falling asleep to rhythmic beating of the other’s heart.
The wand felt heavy in his pocket along with the letters, being pressed up against his chest by the volumes of books as he carried them over to the counter. While the small witch was ringing him up, a stack of Daily Prophets caught his eye to the right of the counter. He picked it up, scanning the headline before nearly dropping it.
Pansy smirked, pulling her close by her hips. “Fucking Gryffindors.” She scoffed, leaning in and kissing her lips softly. Ginny smiled, kissing her back. “Now seriously, do I have to go out the window?” She asked against her lips. Pansy smirked, patting her hips. “Fraid so, unless you want to make Draco’s mother had another nervy b.”
“If I explain things to her, maybe.” Hermione gave a little shrug. “I didn’t say that it was a good plan, but it’s all I’ve got at the moment’s notice.”
“Some things are best left to others that are more suited for the job.” She gave him a knowing smile before going to check on Teddy.  He stood there in the kitchen, holding the journal like an anchor. He couldn’t make heads or tails of his feelings at the moment and just wanted the painfulness to go away. He wanted to be free of everything. He wanted to be drunk. To be numb. He wanted to have never read this journal. To never find out what felt like the most hushed secret there was.
It took a while for her to reply. “It says that I’m invited to finish up my last year at Hogwarts.” She whispered, shocked.
“Oh please, Granger. I don’t need help with that.” She rolled her eyes. “Draco was right, you are kind of dense sometimes. I think some of Potter’s daftness rubbed off on you.” She scrunched her nose at the thought.
“I have a date… but if you want I can cancel.” She told him, sitting up. Draco was silence for a very long time, so long that Pansy became worried and moved to get up. “Bring her along.” He finally stated.
Harry came back in about an hour to check if the blond was still asleep and froze when he slipped into the room. Draco looked up guiltly. "It was stabbing me in the neck. " He explained, and Harry wanted to kick himself.
He had been slowly going through Remus’s boxes, which now lived in the spare bedroom that he had made into an office. He had found a total of almost a hundred journals, more photos than he could count and vials of what looked like memories for a pensieve. He had been careful of those, putting them in a cabinet so that they were safe. He didn’t have a pensieve or even knew anyone with one.
"I don't have my schedule yet, sorry." Harry shrugged and Draco frowned. "We have to get ready. Bye now." Draco told them before shutting the door. "Go back to sleep." He told Harry. "I'm sorry they woke you."
"You wish." Harry smirked, pulling back and taking his hand before leading him up to the castle doors.
“Just let her have her fun I guess…” Ron shrugged. Harry chuckled, placing his mug on the table. “How is the shop doing?” He asked, curious on how the joke shop was faring with George still in Romania.
He sat the mug on his desk before going back to laying on his bed. Six more months. It would be February when, or even if they let them off probation. Because his father would never change. The wizarding world would love nothing more than to keep them here, away from their home, away from family and friends. Away from everything that they had ever known. Away from everything he knew and known. He moved to the window, opening it looking out over the street.
Malfoy hesitated, and for a moment Harry thought he’d offended him. He winced as Malfoy disappeared through one of the doorways out of the main room.
“I don’t know, but I think we need to talk to her. Look, she’s heading to the drinks table, you need a refill, don’t you?” Harry asked, snatching Malfoy’s glass and downing the rest, grinning at Malfoy’s sigh of impatience.
“Don’t you worry, we’re very understanding here; we get all sorts visiting.” Suzanne smiled at him and winked. Harry decided not to cause a fuss by contradicting her and instead asked about Cressida again.
After she disappeared, the four discussed for some time, rereading Hermione’s notes, working out new angles for the case, but eventually, they grew tired and it was time to leave.
They arrived outside Pansy and Blaise’s country manor, lit up by the bright coloured lanterns strung up along the driveway. There was a hum of noise, of laughter, coming from ahead of them as the three followed other well-dressed people towards the house.
“Isn’t she going to explain where she’s going?” Malfoy, baffled, asked a proud but confused Ron, steadfastly ignoring Harry.
There wasn’t much – he’d practically shredded her memory with the constant charms, and the trauma of her death didn’t help, but they got a name, and an age, and a general description. It was enough to go on.
“I need to do a little background research, but I think we can clear four of the five people I talked to today. Hermione, obviously, and several people in Magical Transportation.”
“And to think we once thought it would be you marrying her!” Ron joked, and Harry laughed out loud, amused by the memories of their relationship – it had been a pleasant and amicable break up when it had become clear to both members that neither was interested in the other’s gender. And on top of that, she’d wanted to start her career without any distractions or complications, and he had no longer been in love with her, so it had been an easy break up.
“Not the Killing Curse, then.” Harry brushed his fingers through the air above the blood soaked ground and stiffened in confusion. “It’s the Sectumsempra. The one I used…”
“You were right – I was being childish. I read that article and I got all jealous and petty. You mean a lot to me, Potter, and not just because I fancy you. You’re a good man, and you’ve saved my life and trusted me with yours. I don’t know how you feel, and that scares me.” Malfoy sat down, heavily, in the seat that Harry had vacated only minutes before. He was looking down, and one of his hands was rubbing against the part of his arm that Harry knew was Fenrir’s bite.
The event was never pleasant for Harry – he struggled with the guilt and shame of causing the war, and he was reminded that Malfoy felt similarly about his part in it as he watched Malfoy flinch slightly.
The conversation turned to news about friends and colleagues, as Pansy eagerly shared any gossip she’d acquired in the last few weeks since she’d been back in London. Pansy was an excellent story teller, and was even better at piecing together facts to create the story.
Shaking his head, he decided to pop in and visit Ron and Hermione – all their conversations lately had been about the case, and he’d missed their banter. None of them had been to last night’s Wine and Whiskey Wednesday, instead choosing to rest and relax after the successful end of their case.
Harry and Malfoy took a seat at the table and began to rustle through the papers. Malfoy worked in silence, carefully taking notes with his left hand as he read, but Harry, as always, felt the silence closing in on him and instead twisted his hands in the air, charming a quill to take notes as he spoke aloud anything interesting that he read.
There was a couple of seconds where Harry took a hasty gulp of champagne while he tried to think of something else to say.
The ceremony was beautiful – Luna had sung her vows, which had been both hysterical and hauntingly beautiful, and Ginny’s vows had been so touching and honest. There had been several mentions of nonsensical creatures, of course (Hermione had barely contained her objections) and there was a wild moment where fireworks went off too early, causing quite a scare, but those moments of madness only served to make the event better.
They stood in comfortable silence for a moment, watching the remaining Aurors returning to their natural selves while Hermione hugged Ron tightly, loudly scolding him for his stupidity and kissing him for his bravery.
To the left was Ginny and Luna, sat on a bench, bodies bowing in towards each other, both weeping, and Neville, still hopelessly clutching the bloody sword that had killed Nagini. Further out behind them was the rest of the Weasley clan, crowded around a motionless ginger body on the floor, Mr Weasley curved into Mrs Weasley’s warm embrace as they both sobbed.
“No, of course not.” Hermione replied, not offended, smiling across at him as he stood and, clutching his pile of papers, headed to the door.
Harry stuck his tongue out at Malfoy, half elated to finally have gotten a joke out of him, and half embarrassed it had taken such a stupid comment to do it. Malfoy rolled his eyes back at him, cracking a tiny smile. Preoccupied with each other, neither man saw Hermione and Ron sigh and share a glance.
“If he’s not your type who the hell is? I can’t think of a more godlike man in existence, Harry, you should get on that.” Neville nudged Harry, winking.
An hour and a lot of disgust later and the four knew everything there was to know about Herman Bellchant.
Both men stared for a second, and then, slowly, afraid of what they might find, they made their way up the stairs, stepping over the body. They walked through the hallway towards the only open doorway. Pausing at the doorway, they snapped on latex gloves – Harry had strongly campaigned for better on-scene conduct for Aurors, taking cues from Muggle police. Aurors actually used fingerprinting and DNA evidence now, which Harry considered a minor miracle.
“Thank Merlin, I wasn’t looking forward to writing it for a third time!” Harry relaxed into his chair and instantly regretted it, wincing away from a particularly sharp corner. He looked jealously again at Malfoy.
After an hour of talking, Luna suggested a second therapeutic tattoo – rather than using normal ink, it would be spelled and charmed with a particular purpose. Harry agreed, and held out his arm – she’d chosen each of his previous tattoos (the silver lily, the Deathly Hallows symbol on his right shoulder, and the Sirius star he’d had done after the war) and so he trusted her to choose right this time too.
Phase one of his plan was complete, then. He could only hope the second phase went as smoothly. He crossed his fingers.
He knew the spell, and he’d cast it before, but Malfoy’s body hadn’t featured in his dream. He needed to talk to someone. His mind flitted to the possibility of asking Dumbledore, but he faltered at the thought of using the stone, and so he checked the time; Hermione would be in a meeting, but he knew Ron would be working on his paperwork in his office.
“Well, slandering me is nothing new, is it?” Harry replied bitterly, recalling every terrible thing the Daily Prophet had ever printed, remembering all the hate mail he’d received after the Triwizard Tournament.
And behind them all were the countless rows of the shadowy bodies of the fallen, Tonks and Lupin among them.
“Ah, like that, is she? Well, love, I don’t know anything about it, but I expect Suzanne next door will know, if you want to ask her. She’s not in today, though, so you’ll have to come down tomorrow if you’re still here.”
Harry promised, and Lupin told him. When he was finished, he returned the stone to its box and activated the charms and curses that protected it. Then he went to the kitchen and cooked his dinner, using spices from Mexico he’d collected a few years ago on a trip with Neville, all the while trying and failing to forget the little black stone hidden under his bed.
Harry stepped out of the green fire into the large living room of Ron and Hermione’s flat, greeted by the delicious smell of curry. He could hear Ron and Ginny chatting in the kitchen as they cooked, and sat on a large red sofa was Hermione and Luna, laughing merrily at something Luna had just finished saying.
The door opens then and Weasley and Granger come in, bruised, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, but alive. Draco’s surprised at how relieved he is to see that they’re ok. He’d sort of thought all his compassion reserves were spent, by this point.
He jerks his head and they all turn to look, Draco craning round to avoid having to move Potter too much. He’s never been in a car in his life. Never even been on the Knight Bus, but right now it might be their only hope.
“I know it can be shit,” Potter says anyway, like Draco asked for an explanation. “I shouldn’t have assumed you’d be awake.”
“Is this normal roommate behaviour?” Potter asks as Draco pulls on a sweatband to keep his hair out of his face.
several times thinking about it, and had probably only offered to soothe Harry’s headache for purely innocent reasons.
Still, he manages to drop off before the need to feel the chill on his face wins out over his exhaustion. He doesn’t even realise he’s fallen asleep until he’s jerked awake again by a sharp sound. He lies there, disorientated after barely being unconscious for ten minutes, heart pounding. The noise comes again; Draco blinks over at the window, then gets out of bed and opens it to find Potter staring up at him.
If he had the capacity for rational thought, he might have taken a moment to appreciate the bizarre reality of the situation, considering his and Malfoy’s history, but instead he feels like any coherency is being steadily worked out of him by the pads of Malfoy’s fingers on his skull. Malfoy combs through his hair, presses his thumbs into the tender spot behind Harry’s ears, palms carefully around his forehead, drags his nails over the sensitive skin of his scalp until Harry’s nothing but a vaguely human-shaped bunch of nerves and tingles.
Luckily, Pansy, who seems to have this sixth sense about when Draco needs her, shows up before she can make a complete fool of herself by doing something like burying her nose in Potter’s neck as she’d been considering just then. “Come dance, Draco!” Pansy half whines, grinning easily at Potter when the other girl nods in greeting.
“Morning to you, too,” says Potter, and Draco turns to find him only feet away. They’re in adjacent beds, the walls white, the clinical smell of disinfectant everywhere.
“Thanks,” Potter says, looking only a little surprised at the compliment. “You don’t look so bad yourself,” she continues, with this dirty grin that has heat curling up Draco’s spine and then, “What did you think? About the match, I mean. Really thought we might lose for a couple of minutes after that bludger took Jones out but I spotted the snitch whilst Cooper was distracted. Lucky catch, I guess.”
Draco sees what he’s trying to do, keep talking and then go for the element of surprise. Potter’s good, but he’s also a teenager, whilst Dolohov’s a fully grown wizard with a trigger-happy wand arm and little patience for chit-chat. Potter barely gets his own wand raised before there’s a sound like an explosion and shards of something hit Draco all over, cutting into his skin.
, Potter, I get it.” Draco pulls his knees up and wraps his arms around them, stares at the rain outside and tries hard not to miss his dad. He’s not surprised that it doesn’t work -- he’s been failing at it for months.
“Oh.” Potter smiles so wide Draco can see his fucking molars. “It’s been better. Didn’t you say something about warming it up?”
Draco remembers reading something about that. They’re making him take a NEWT in Muggle Studies this year and he’s been doing some studying before classes begin, half out of embarrassment at how behind he’s going to be, half out of a weird, angry curiosity that’s taken hold of him.
Potter only laughs that stupidly charming laugh again and sort of— shifts. She keeps wriggling around, dipping back on her elbows so the height difference between them becomes more pronounced and she’s looking up at Draco, smirking.
“Yeah.” Harry cannot tear his eyes away from where Malfoy’s top dips low over his collar bones, exposing the bare skin. He seems to only wear clothes that are either two sizes too big and hang off him, or tight enough that they leave literally nothing to the imagination. Weirdly, the oversized ones are worse. They make Harry want to gather all that fabric in his hands and push it slowly up, over Malfoy’s stomach—
“Well.” There’s cool silence for a moment, just the waves and the blood pounding in Harry’s head. “I thought it was, but maybe I’m wrong.”
Harry moves onto his stomach and Malfoy’s eyebrows shoot up, the outline of his cock straining against his underwear. Harry wonders if he’d even finished before knocking on Harry’s door, or whether he just got himself to the edge and came right over, ready and eager for it.
Potter’s plonked himself down very close to Draco and he leans into him right away. Draco doesn’t know why he expected Potter, who’s practically the patron saint of throwing oneself into things, to be less forward now that they’ve crossed whatever line this is, but he’s surprised again how easily Potter just kisses him, no preamble.
Draco had been teasing him about the weather, basking in the dry heat of it and telling Harry he wouldn’t last two seconds in the humidity of Florida, when someone had come right up to them, stood in Harry’s path so that he had to stop walking or else barrel straight into them.
There’s a distinctly awkward pause that Henry seems unaware of. He grabs the two drinks he’s finished making and spins, face colouring slightly when he realises they’re all still staring.
It certainly speeds up the process. They don’t even make it upstairs before Dolohov appears, shooting curses from the landing and grinning horribly at them whilst he leans over the bannister. A man that side of fifty should really not be able to bend like that, Draco thinks, and sends a hex at him that misses and explodes a wall sconce.
“Yeah,” Potter says. “Yeah, I guess not,” and then heads back into his own room without another word.
“Merlin, Potter, yes, it feels good, shit,” Draco pants, her own hands splayed on Potter’s thighs again, trying to communicate that she needs more through hip movements rather than actual words.
The day of, Draco’s antsy, his energy high and restless. He goes into work before Harry’s even out of bed and they meet at reception once Harry’s had some breakfast and thrown some clothes into a bag. What exactly one brings to space, Harry has no idea, but he steals a couple of jumpers out of Draco’s room, assuming the t-shirts and shorts he packed for the Florida heat won’t cut it.
“Yeah, I know, and it felt weird.” He slips slightly against the headboard, sliding down the bed a bit and pushing himself back up with a hand on the mattress that comes within inches of making contact with Draco’s upper arm.
Weasley frowns at him, and Potter looks so disappointed it makes Draco’s throat tight, but he forces himself not to care. It’ll start all over again soon, and they won’t even remember that he chose to stay outside.
Draco doesn’t want to have this conversation. He can deal with Potter being moody and distracted but they’re not going to sit here and talk about how Draco has no one to lean on.
Potter slaps her arse playfully and they’re both giggling like Hufflepuffs, Draco is honestly never going to live this down.
“I was twelve,” Weasley says, exasperated, but his eyes are on Potter, watching him with a worried expression.
Malfoy is not asleep. He wasn’t asleep when Harry brushed his teeth as loud as humanly possible, nor when he’d deliberately banged his bedroom door closed behind him, and he isn’t asleep now that Harry is in bed, the room dark and warm. But not quiet, because Malfoy isn’t asleep.
“Not very good at following orders, are you?” Potter doesn’t look put out, rather, she looks frighteningly like Draco is everything she’s ever wanted and then some. It’s more than a bit overwhelming, having the full force of her gaze directed at Draco this close up.
Potter makes a humming noise, one Draco recognises from when he was to prod Potter awake in the middle of the night and tell him it’s his turn to keep watch.
She stops and they both freeze, listening for the telltale sound of music from the other side of the wall.
It’s weird — Harry knows some people like this, the choking thing, but he never understood it. It felt too restrictive, a little too on the side of violence for his tastes. But this is— it’s different. It isn’t Malfoy holding him down. It’s Harry in control, Harry cutting off his own air supply because he wants to, because he knows it’ll feel good and Malfoy told him to. And he wants to do what Malfoy says, which isn’t really a new thing, if he’s honest.
Draco’s mouth goes dry. They should have realised there might be someone here. All that time planning how to avoid being recognised and they didn’t stop to consider the possibility that there’d be more than just spells protecting the place. It’s the fucking Ministry all over again. Every time they come up with a new plan, find a new lead, a new thing to throw all their effort behind, he forgets just how out of their depths they actually are.
“Nice catch.” Potter laughs, sounding disproportionately pleased that Draco’s appeared. He looks good, not just in his jeans and t-shirt, but happy. Draco hadn’t registered the subtle tension in his face this past week until he looks down now and sees it gone.
Draco is drunk on it; she feels like she spent half her life at school trying to get Potter to notice her and now here she is, seemingly unable or unwilling to look away as Draco dances, throws her head back and spins Pansy around, laughs at the ridiculous moves her best friend always somehow ropes her into. She gets distracted for a sec trying to convince Pansy that, no, this is absolutely not the time and place for the routine they’d perfected together aged nine, and when she turns back to the bar it’s empty. Well, not empty, it’s Friday night, but it’s empty of what Draco is looking for, empty of short, nice-smelling girls with green eyes that’ve been looking at Draco like she’s a particularly refreshing glass of elf-made wine all night.
They returned to Malfoy’s bedroom, and Harry sat awkwardly on the edge of Malfoy’s bed. Smiling, Malfoy got Harry a t-shirt and a pair of trackies, and then vanished into the bathroom while Harry got changed in his room.
Harry rustled around in the papers for a few moments, and emerged with a pile of newspaper clippings triumphantly.
“Of course. You’ve been a great help, Susan. Would you be able to come to our office on Monday morning to run some tests?” Harry asked.
There was no answer. Harry banged his fist on the door, shouting out several choice swearwords. After a short moment, the door opened up so suddenly Harry almost fell into the bathroom.
Ron crouched in front of Harry’s chair and stared him deeply in the eyes and whispered “Legilimens”.
“I like to collect things.” Harry said, embarrassed. He looked around at all the cooking books and different spices in pots, all the random souvenirs that overflowed from his living room. “Sorry it’s a mess.”
But there was no denying it now as Molly Weasley fussed around him. Ginny had forced her brothers to keep her mum away until the start of the ceremony, and so Molly’s maternal instincts were overflowing to anybody within arms’ length.
It’s bloody inconvenient, he thought, that the one person I actually have romantic feelings for is the most fucking annoying man in the world.
They stared at each other, neither backing down – Harry refusing to speak about the Horcruxes, and Malfoy refusing to accept more secrets. After long minutes of a silent and tense standoff, Malfoy nodded, looking unhappy but resigned.
Harry wanted to interrupt, to say he didn’t give a shit, or that he was sorry for bringing up his father yesterday, but Malfoy held up his hand.
As he showered and brushed his teeth, still thinking of Malfoy and their ever complicated case, Harry felt something stirring deep inside him. He felt as though he was walking, step by step, into something he couldn't see – like he was getting involved with something, or things, beyond his understanding.
“Susan. It might help you to see someone – just to talk. I can get you an appointment with Luna Lovegood, if you’d like. She’s helped me out, I’m sure she’d be happy to see you too.”
“Yes, Potter, we’re boyfriends, partners, gay lovers. Pancake?” Malfoy flipped a pancake onto a plate and pushed it towards Harry, who was grinning widely.
“Agreed. It says here he almost got expelled from Hogwarts for attacking a fellow student. He claimed she was part Veela, although her heritage was never proved. She nearly died, apparently.”
The man growled, and nodded. Without saying anything, he fell to all fours and loped off into the trees. Malfoy and Harry exchanged a panicked glance and jogged after him.
Harry did as he was told, unoffended by Malfoy’s sarcasm – it was part of the reason Harry liked him, after all. The sarcasm had made Harry’s questions more light-hearted – an honest but easy conversation.
After all, wasn’t he a cold-blooded murderer? Hadn’t he systematically hunted down and murdered pieces of Tom Riddle’s soul? The man had been a monster, and he’d been barely human by the time Harry had faced him down in the wreckage of their first true home, but that didn’t change what Harry had done. The fact that he’d only destroyed the diary himself didn’t matter – he’d encouraged Ron to stab the Locket and Hermione the Cup, he’d told Neville to kill Nagini – he was the moving force behind those acts.
Hermione, after returning to Hogwarts for her NEWTS, had joined the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, working in the ‘Being’ sub-department, which handled goblins, house-elves and werewolves. She’d worked in the Department for two years before being promoted to Head of the Magical Creatures Department. She’d revolutionised the way the magical community treated house-elves, and was now working to do the same for werewolves. This was exactly the sort of thing she dealt with.
And so he sat, alone, throughout the night, silent and still until he fell asleep. And in another flat, another lonely man sat, wishing he were braver, wishing he were stronger, wishing he were a better man.
“It’s part of what we’re investigating.” Another lie, this one from Malfoy. “Can you tell us anything about your lost time?”
“Well, I suppose I can manage that. That’s the only photo you’re getting for free, though!” Malfoy teased, and Harry smiled back, pleased – Ron and Hermione would love the photo, and this way Malfoy got to keep whatever photos had so inspired him.
“I think I’m going to go home now, if that’s alright. I’m rather tired.” She finally said, standing up, smoothing down her clothes, rearranging her hair, wiping away dried tears.
“Is that the invitation to this year’s dinner party and ball?” Harry asked, taking it and looking more closely.
“So, Susan. We’re interviewing everybody again and asking for a few more details that may help us with our case.” This was a lie, although Susan wouldn’t know that; Harry felt bad for lying to her, but it was his job to find out everything he could.
Jumping out of bed, he rooted around under his bed for some time, studiously and passionately ignoring the heavily charmed box at the back, and finally came up to breathe with a huge stack of papers, tied together with bright red string.
Neville cheered and sent off a messily-written note into the flames, and moments later Ron appeared in the living room.
“I don’t know…my father hated mess, hated my art. I had to keep it in my room so it wasn’t burned or thrown away.”
“Well, I’m glad you’re alright, anyway.” Hermione perched herself on Ron’s lap, facing Harry. Had anyone else displayed the same level of affection publicly, he might have been uncomfortable, but she was just as likely to have sat on his lap if Ron’s had been unavailable – it was just the way the three of them were, had been since the end of the war.
They watched as Scratch was reprimanded sharply by Malfoy and Bellchant was dragged away by the Aurors, the six year old cheering in her little voice.
Malfoy stood, frozen, half in, half out the room, carefully taking stock of each person present. Harry realised he’d forgotten to mention that Neville and his latest girlfriend would be coming to dinner too, rounding out the number at eight, counting Malfoy. Malfoy took a deep breath and stepped fully in, smiling round at everybody. Neville and his girlfriend were already sat at the table, listening with amusement to Ron and Ginny’s bickering about the Chudley Cannons.
“Blaise, dearest, this really is a day for celebrating. You are the bravest, most wonderful man I’ve ever met. You have always been by my side and I couldn’t be happier to be standing here with you, with the rest of our lives ahead of us. I can’t wait to be your wife.”
Malfoy’s flat was minimalistic – mostly black, white and grey, with a large sofa in front of…was that a muggle TV? The main room was open plan, with the living room spreading seamlessly into a kitchen that looked so unlike Harry’s own cluttered, chaotic kitchen that he couldn’t help rolling his eyes.
“Well, there must be a way to find him! What about looking through old Ministry records to find children of Ministry officials?”
He crawled out of bed in search of Malfoy, who he found already dressed and showered, eating breakfast at the kitchen table.
Reluctantly, Harry opened his eyes again, noticing that it was, again, past midday – he was getting into some bad habits, he thought, but he couldn’t bring himself to care when he realised where he was. He’d spent the night with Malfoy!
“Yeah, you definitely did.” Still laughing, Malfoy pulled back, dropping his hands from Harry’s waist. Harry jokingly pouted, disappointed, but took the opportunity to look around at the flat, which he’d never seen before.
“Everyone decent?” He called as he stepped through the green fire, keen not to repeat a mistake he’d made early on after Ron and Hermione had moved in together – he’d burst into the flat only to find them in varying stages of nakedness on their sofa. They had all screamed, and he hadn’t been able to look Hermione in the eye for several days afterwards.
Her crying petered out and she started to speak, telling them about the times she’d ‘woken up’ in a strange place, no idea how she got there, or when she’d realised she was missing hours of her life, or, the worst, when she’d found blood on her hands but didn’t know whose it was.
“It’s terrifying!” Susan burst into tears, and Malfoy left his seat, knelt down beside her chair. “Sometimes I find myself just standing somewhere, no idea where I am!”
“That doesn’t look like me, though. Too attractive.” Harry added, leaning closer to the small figure of him, with his almost glowing skin and wild, dark hair, looking almost angelic, looking handsomer than Harry ever had. “And they’ve made me look so… hurt."
“Why?” Harry couldn’t understand – he’d been the opposite of scared – he’d been on top of the world with Malfoy’s lips on his.
Harry nodded. He didn’t refute Ron’s claim about his Occlumency skills – it was one of the few skills he’d been totally unable to develop, despite more training in recent years.
“It’s too late!” Harry was no longer crying – he was shouting. He didn’t know why he was so upset – he’d never even met Cressida. But he was sleep deprived, and he’d had enough of finding mutilated bodies.  He’d read pages of her notes, heard her voice, understood her thoughts, and besides, nobody deserved to decompose in a ditch thousands of miles from their home.
Harry had barely leaned in when Malfoy (Draco? Harry thought, wondering how weird it would be to call him that) pulled Harry into his flat, pushing the front door shut with his foot. Malfoy pushed him up against the door and kissed him, hard. Harry let out a squeak of surprise as his back hit the door and Malfoy broke the kiss to laugh, resting his forehead against Harry’s.
Harry stopped short, feeling the buzz, feeling his heart catch. At the end of the little corridor was a large painting of the minutes after Voldemort’s death, and standing in front of it, stock still, was Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy, adding the date of the event to his note to Ron, reminding him to keep the night clear. Every year, he forgot and scheduled some team meeting or drinks with friends, despite, every year, Harry and Hermione reminding him multiple times. Harry suspected it was a little bit of Ron’s subconscious prejudice against Slytherin acting up, because Ron always enjoyed the event more than anybody else when he actually got there.
“Are you experiencing memory blanks? Losing periods of time?” Malfoy’s voice was soft and sympathetic, non-judgemental.
“It’s new protocol, Mr Umbridge – we’re to visit anyone who speaks out against werewolves or any other kind of magical non-human, just to check up.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and waved his wand discretely, and Harry’s baggy jeans and large t-shirt transformed into black slacks and a white button down shirt, similar to Malfoy’s own clothes. Muttering a quick word of thanks, Harry followed Malfoy across the road and into the bar, where they were greeted by a loud squeal of joy.
And so Harry and Malfoy found themselves in the outskirts of London as the afternoon drew to a close, knocking on Susan’s front door. There was no answer, and the door swung open when pushed, no longer locked. Sharing a worried glance, both men cautiously stepped inside the house, Malfoy drawing his wand, Harry letting a spell bloom in his fingertips.
The sky was black and sprinkled with stars when Harry finally staggered out of the bar, grinning back at Pansy blowing a kiss. Behind her stood Malfoy and Blaise, watching him with strangely pleasant smiles on their faces, waving goodbye.
Time passed in a blur of paper cuts and ink stains, until finally Ron spoke up, looking unimpressed.
They ate as they discussed what they had each found so far – Harry had been going through some of her notes on her magical creature rights campaigns in America, which were very detailed but had nothing to do with her presence in England. Malfoy hadn’t had better luck – he’d found a stack of papers that seemed to be in code, but he was fairly sure they were about werewolf packs in Britain.
Susan’s face was blank for a long moment, and then, as though surfacing from deep under water, her face cleared and she nodded, relaxing into her chair, more at ease, but still not making eye contact.
“No, Luna, don’t worry, I don’t need a tonic.” He almost retched at the thought of her anti-nargle concoctions. “I’m just thinking.”
Harry returned to the table and his notes, only to notice that the light in the room had faded away as the sun slipped beneath the ocean. Harry suddenly swore, casting a tempus charm.
“Alright, that’ll probably take Granger an hour or two, max, to do, so I suggest we head to the latest crime scene.”
“I might ask Andromeda for Lupin’s journals while he was underground – I know she kept them for Teddy, but I’m sure she wouldn’t mind us taking a look before then. And I think it might be smart if you try to get into contact with them, Harry, Malfoy.” Hermione paused and looked a little awkward. “Because there hasn’t been contact since before Voldemort, we don’t know what their alliances are – so you should both go.”
Fingers still wrapped around Harry’s wrist, they watched each other, aware of something bubbling up in the space between them, unaware just what it was.
“We’ll have to look into both options.” Harry said, trying to dispel the sickening memories of casting the curse, as a small owl flew into the alley, landing at Harry’s feet. He looked around nervously, but no muggles were around to see. He knelt down and opened the note that Hermione had attached to its ankle.
It was only a fifteen minute walk to Malfoy’s flat, and Harry arrived right on time, despite the light drizzle of rain and rapidly fading sunlight. He’d never been inside before, although he’d occasionally met Malfoy outside on the way to a case nearby. He was filled with a sudden strong desire to see if Malfoy was as neat and tidy at home as he was at the office, everything exactly in its place, so unlike Harry’s own desk or flat.
“Of course! We love you, Harry, and we couldn’t think of a better namesake.” Hermione replied, smiling at him.
They’d been there for only moments when the paparazzi swarmed around them, buzzing with excitement. The camera flashes startled Harry and he grimaced for a second before he remembered himself, pasting on a wide smile, his famous face all teeth and lips.
“Alright, mate?” Ron greeted him as Harry appeared in their living room, turning around as Hermione fussed over his navy robes. Hermione’s robes, a pale lilac, complemented perfectly, and Harry smiled.
Harry usually hated any art of him – they felt so fake, like paintings of an idol, but this whole scene had been painted with familiarity and love and pain – it had been painted by someone who had been there that night, he was sure.
“I think it’s fucking with you. The Wand, I mean. You haven’t used it in six years – you’ve told us it speaks to you – maybe it’s tired of waiting for you to crack, and it’s trying to make you think you already have.”
Harry woke up with a raging headache and a dry mouth, and immediately vomited onto the pillow next to him.
Harry looked suspiciously at the bacon and cheese flavoured crisps, and shook his head. Ron was continuously finding new, disgusting junk foods that no-one else was willing to risk trying.
Harry tumbled out of the Floo first, still unsteady on his feet even after all these years, and grumbled to himself as Malfoy stepped out behind him, ever graceful. They’d arrived in a lovely little cottage on the edge of a seaside village in the north of England. Both wizards paused to wonder aloud what Cressida Boone had been doing, seemingly hiding away in a muggle village in another country, but neither had an answer.
“Right, read out the dates and places of each murder or other crime mentioned, and I’ll write it on here.”
Ron and Harry shrugged at each other, and turned to their own piles, steeling themselves. Malfoy leaned towards Harry.
“She’s sent a list of names and addresses for four vocal werewolf haters. Oh, look at that – Jeremiah Umbridge. Her brother, apparently.” Hermione had written several unpleasant words about Umbridge and her brother, but Harry didn’t relay them to Malfoy, remembering fifth year. Malfoy’s face looked pinched and uncomfortable, and it was such a Malfoy-esque facial expression that Harry could suddenly see through the stranger to Malfoy’s true face.
The interior was even more striking than the imposing exterior, especially decorated as it was tonight. An entrance hall led into a multitude of rooms, primarily the ballroom which was the venue for tonight’s party.
It wasn’t until Wednesday morning, two days later, that Hermione signed off on their excursion to find the Northumberland pack. She’d spent that time communicating with werewolf representatives and ensuring Harry and Malfoy would cause no harm or offence, and their time had been split between obsessively learning werewolf etiquette and learning new defensive spells. Hermione had quizzed them, much to their dismay, but had been satisfied they’d behave appropriately.
“I…broke a glass.” He felt dazed, like he was in a dream. Malfoy moved towards him, fast, and Harry flinched backwards, collapsed into a seat, wincing as his arm hit the railings.
“I’m not going without having a shower.” Harry stripped off his t-shirt and boxers and stepped into the shower defiantly.
“Well that depends on the favour, doesn’t it, Potter?” Malfoy replied, but he was still smiling, so Harry was hopeful.
Harry froze – had Malfoy painted it? It would explain why he’d want it to be sold anonymously, as presumably some older Ministry people might still be biased against Malfoy for his past, and additionally Ron would never let Malfoy forget that he was technically an ‘artiste’. It would also explain why Malfoy had been stood in front of it for ages, but had shown no interest in buying it.
But the fourth person he’d interviewed, the Deputy Head of the Portkey Office, Susan Darling, had left him feeling uncomfortable. All her answers had been exactly what Harry wanted to hear, and she’d been perfectly polite and helpful, but something in her eyes had unsettled him. He hadn’t asked anything about werewolves, which, in hindsight, was a blessing – whether or not she was involved, it was safer to keep the two cases separate in the public eye.
“Oh, that reminds me – I’m looking forward to celebrating tomorrow.” He put extra emphasis on the word celebrating, hoping Malfoy would catch his hint.
Once the words were finished moving, both wizards could clearly see she’d been writing about werewolves.
Having finalised their plans for the next few days, the four went their separate ways – Ron and Hermione returned home, as Hermione was starting to get tired and a little sick from her pregnancy, and, according to Ron, there was “no decent food here”.
Malfoy had no time to recover, however, as Hermione immediately appeared behind him, looking ready to burst – her due date was almost upon her, but of course that didn’t slow her down.
“Don’t be silly, Harry. Anyone who can love someone else’s child that much definitely wants to be a father. I mean, look at him.” Luna gestured to Malfoy, who had taken over Harry Frederick duty so Ron could have two slices of cake.
Harry and Malfoy made eye contact, just for a moment, and Harry realised he didn’t have to finish his sentence – both men knew exactly which spell he meant. Malfoy wasn’t going to make him say it, and Harry was grateful. Whoever had cast this spell had meant it to be a slow and painful death, and they both knew it.
As though to prove his point, the bartender, a dark haired, tall, tattooed man, called out Malfoy’s name. Malfoy grinned back, waving, as he led Harry to a small table in the corner. Harry sat down but Malfoy remained standing.
Shucking on a jacket Hermione had gifted him last year, he glanced in a mirror on his way to the door, helplessly patting the black shock of hair that sat atop his head.
Smiling, Harry bid him goodbye and walked out of the courtyard, feeling a terrible warmth burning in his chest. Pride at solving the case, he supposed, or relief that his plan had gone well. After all, what else could it be?
Harry shook his head, not sure how to explain that he wanted someone witty and sarcastic and a little bit mean. Ron looked like he knew what Harry couldn’t say, and he didn’t like it. Harry turned away and caught sight of Malfoy on the other side of the room, laughing at something Pansy had said.
“You didn’t do any of the writing in the first place!” Malfoy sounded indignant, but he was smiling a little, and Harry stuck out his tongue, pleased. Harry prepared to retort something witty, but was interrupted by Ron’s arrival.
“What’s the theme, then?” He spoke through the mouthful of crisps, and although Hermione rolled her eyes, she read out the letter. The theme wouldn’t be officially announced until everybody arrived tomorrow, but Pansy always caved and told Hermione beforehand, knowing she would tell Harry and Ron.
“What can I say? It was Wine and Whiskey Wednesday.” Harry grinned lopsidedly back at him, only to be distracted by the arrival of a neatly folded memo. Malfoy snatched it out of the air before Harry could reach for it, quickly scanning it.
For someone who had grown up in the muggle world, Harry knew very little about the muggle world – his childhood with the Dursleys had left him somewhat lacking, and he was still catching up. He’d been learning about the magical world during his time at Hogwarts, and now he was learning about the muggle world.
“Even so, that is incredibly lame.” Malfoy, still snorting, replied. He pulled a stiff white piece of card from his pocket and showed it to Harry. Engraved on it, in black spidery font, were the names of Pansy and Blaise, along with their address and a time.
They stared at each other for a long moment, silent and still in the silver shine of the moon, and then finally Malfoy moved. More graceful than Harry had been by far, he leaned forward, carefully pressing his cool lips against Harry’s warm ones.
“Harry, you git, where were you last night? You missed out on a banging night, mate! Katie and Oliver got so drunk they staged a Quidditch match without brooms! And you should have seen Cormac! He put on the karaoke and started dancing to Celestina Warbreck! Reply ASAP that you’re coming tonight or I’ll come and find you, idiot!”
Harry was delighted – he couldn’t wait to rub it in Malfoy’s face that he, too, knew the secret theme before the event started.
Finally, he reached out, tapped the door a couple of times. A few seconds passed, and then the door swung open, revealing a ruffled and sleepy-eyed Malfoy dressed in a large t shirt and muggle trackies.
“Harry!” Ron cried out, frustrated, and heads started to turn. Harry was still gawking at Malfoy, hearing every word he’d ever thought about him ringing in his ears.
“I can’t be disarmed.” Harry’s throat was dry, his heart was racing. What happened next? It shamed him to think it, but Malfoy could kill him and steal it now, and become something greater and worse than Voldemort ever was. Harry stumbled on.
“Ha! Hardly. They hated me. Thought I was a freak.” Even now, so many years later, Harry felt himself choke up a little.
“And catching Dark wizards is mine.” Ron added. “Maybe I should get assigned officially to your case, make it a bit easier for us to work together.”
A blur of gold and black flew past Harry into Malfoy’s arms, and, at a much more respectable pace, Blaise followed, giving Harry a quick, tight hug, more business than pleasure. Harry’s relationship with Blaise was friendly, but both knew it was mostly because Pansy insisted.
“That’s OK, Potter. I do, too.” Malfoy reached out to gently stroke Harry’s cheek softly with his finger, looking like he thought Harry might not let him. It felt terribly intimate, and Harry almost blushed and turned away, but he stuck it out, feeling fire where Malfoy’s finger touched his cheek.
Harry did try writing Savage’s report, spending at least an hour sat at his desk clutching a dripping quill, but he couldn’t write more than a few words without getting distracted. Sat neatly in the trash was a short letter from Connor Johnson, saying he’d be at the party and was looking forward to seeing Harry. He kept taking it out and reading it, and then throwing it away again in a flash of annoyance.
Hope you enjoyed the story! Leave a comment and let me know what you liked :) Feel free to ask for one-shot ideas and I'll give them a go! x
How could something so wonderful have become so awful in such a short time? It was only this morning Harry had woken up in Malfoy’s bed, and now he was sitting alone in his own. Again.
He hoped Malfoy wasn’t expecting sex. Harry had never slept with a man before, although of course he’d thought about it (a lot), and the thought of doing it tonight made him nervous.  Besides, he really was tired, and he thought that would probably have an effect.
“I believed if she thought it was important enough to involve me, it was too important for her to be casual about it. I was right.”
Harry slept late again the next day, waking up just after midday. His head was throbbing as he slowly opened his eyes, and his mouth was disgustingly dry. He blindly groped for his glasses and the small vial he always kept on his bedside table. He swallowed a couple of swigs of Hermione’s hangover remedy, feeling a tingle as the fog in his head cleared away.
Harry would find himself getting distracted, thinking about what his next case would be, or how Ginny’s wedding planning was going, or if Neville had taken the next step with Calliope. Then he’d remember Malfoy’s mocking voice saying “You’re full of shit” and suddenly he’d be raring to go again, ready to punch through his bedroom wall.
“Harry, darling, how have you been?” She leant forward and kissed each cheek. “It’s been an age, we really ought to catch up more often. But at least Draco has finally given in and brought you along!”
“How did you contact the werewolf packs when you were underground, Lupin? We need to get in contact with the Northumberland pack.”
Harry sat silently for several long hours, a half-finished report abandoned in front of him, seemingly unaware of the tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Severus once mentioned a house mate of his named Bellchant, said he was a real piece of work.” He looked horrified, turning to face Harry with wide eyes. “If I’d known he was still around….”
“Exactly! I don’t think you’ve used it at all. Not to be rude, but you’re shit at Occlumency – I’d have seen something.”
“That’s because Snape created it when he was at Hogwarts. I found it written in my sixth-year Potions textbook.”
“Alright, I get your point.” Harry laughed, tucking into the meal. “When did you become such a good cook?”
But when he stepped through the flames this time, he didn’t look at what surrounded him, instead walking through the living room and kitchen into the smaller bedroom at the back. He knelt under his bed and pulled out a small cardboard box. He pulled it onto his lap and whispered five words, followed by a complex pattern traced in the air by both his wand and his left hand. Spell disarmed, he carefully he opened the box and pulled what looked to be an ordinary ring box. Whispering another four words, temporarily disarming a nasty curse, he pulled out the small, shining black Resurrection stone.
Hearing the words come out of his mouth, he darted out of the door, grimacing and repeating the words to himself in a silly voice.
That night had shown him the true danger of using the stone, and it had terrified all three of them. Hermione and Ron hated being near the stone – they were only here now to make sure neither Harry nor Malfoy got caught in its spell.
“Can you tell us anything about these dates? Perhaps you noticed something or somebody strange around the Ministry?” Malfoy pushed a slip of parchment across the table to Susan, and Harry caught a glimpse of the paper as Susan picked it up – it was a list of the dates of the werewolf murders.
“Forensics should find DNA and fingerprints at the scene, so we can at least see if they match a Ministry official.” Harry said. It was an unpleasant thought, but it was certainly true that Susan’s killer could be a fellow Ministry official.
He was vaguely, and probably pointlessly, hoping Malfoy would suggest Harry could stay over. He didn’t want to go back to his lonely flat.
“She seemed off. I don’t know how to describe it. Something about the way she looked at me. Like there was something else going on inside her head that I couldn’t get at.”
“I don’t care about the bloody stone, Granger.” His voice was calm and quiet, but both Harry and Hermione could feel the anger underlying. Harry winced, and Hermione made a sympathetic face as she darted out the room to follow Ron, who was whistling, obliviously, down the hall.
“Haven’t they got anything better to write about?” Harry, relieved the article wasn’t anything worse, as it had been in the past, smiled at Malfoy. He didn’t smile back.
Susan looked at it a long time, working her way down each date and thinking hard about each one. Her face grew more pinched as the seconds dragged on, and both men watched her fingers start twitching.
He wondered, vaguely and perhaps cruelly, if Malfoy would write in to his beloved paper and tell them the story of Harry’s muggle relatives – it would be the first true thing they’d ever published, Harry thought bitterly. It was admittedly an unfair thought to Malfoy, who had been his partner and perhaps friend for years, but Harry was in the mood to be unfair.
“Ha. They got that wrong, then. I was at yours, not with some random hook-up.” Harry was triumphant, glad to have proved the Prophet wrong, even though he was long past the stage where he’d write in to complain.
“What are two young wizards doing in our territory?” His voice was low and gravelly but the men were relieved he spoke without formality. Harry and Malfoy glanced at each other, and Malfoy dipped his head, allowing Harry to answer.
It wasn’t the best response to the heartfelt apology Malfoy had given him, but it was the best he could do in that moment.
“I think we might be looking for a body.” Hermione agreed, peering through the darkness into the wide stretches of field surrounding them.
Dean held up each photo as Seamus described it – each photo was taken with care, capturing private moments between friends or lovers. One lovely photo showed Ron hugging Hermione from behind, chin resting on her bushy head, both smiling widely and laughing at what Harry knew to be himself, just out of view. Another photo, more striking, showed Harry and Malfoy stood side by side, heads bent towards each other, chatting enthusiastically, faces relaxed.
“Alright, boys, this is very important. You’ll have to act as diplomats first, Aurors second. Please remember that.” She implored both of them as they stood in in front of her dressed in formal black robes in Cressida’s cottage.
Malfoy stepped impossibly closer, pushing Harry further against the railings, and it was Harry’s turn to make a strange, strangled sound.
“Hey, Hermione.” Harry greeted cheerfully, closing her office door behind her. He rarely came to her office on Level Four nowadays (she mostly came down to Level Two to see both Harry and Ron in one fell swoop) and he’d almost forgotten how overwhelming it was. Obsessively tidy and neat, every single inch of wall was bookshelves, with hundreds of books in alphabetical order. Her desk was littered with countless labelled folders and there were boxes, stacked waist height, of case files in organised lines.
“It’s run out,” Granger says, her voice already starting to take on the worried tone that Draco knows is only going to get worse as the night progresses. “I
the dead-looking plants in the Home & Garden section, appears at the end of the aisle. “They’re done,” he calls, gesturing to the checkouts with his head.
bored, which is making her think a run and a cold bath might have been a better way to spend the afternoon.
They get a frozen turkey. Granger defrosts it with her wand and a distinct look of distaste once they’ve traipsed back out into the snow and found a safe spot to apparate, getting the tent and the protective enchantments up in record time because it’s too cold to be standing around in the Forest of Dean at the arse end of the year.
“I didn’t want to be too high, you know.” Potter’s rambling. “I didn’t want a view of the forest.” He flinches like he’s said too much. Apparently he’s the kind of person who’ll just keep talking if there’s an uncomfortable silence to fill. Draco’s never noticed that before, but then they’ve hardly had many conversations over the years.
to just leave it, find somewhere to disapparate and write off the whole trip as a waste of time — and not for lack of trying, he’s suggested it so many times it doesn’t even embarrass him anymore, coming off as a coward — but he wants to see what will happen if he takes himself out of the equation. Plus, he’s fucking
His nostrils flare for a minute but then he sighs, seeming to deflate. He comes over and sits heavily on the floor next to Draco.
Harry sighs. “No, I. Sorry, I didn’t mean— you know.” He waves his hand vaguely. “You can sleep with whoever you want.”
“Better get another couple then,” Ron says, reaching over her head to grab a bottle in each hand. “What the hell is Jägermeister?” he asks, pausing.
“Hey.” Draco leans back down over him. “Hey, Potter. C’mon. Can’t sleep now.” He doesn’t know what will happen if Potter falls unconscious, but he knows it won’t be
He hadn’t thought he’d be able to do it, actually try to end someone’s life (see: the infamous Dumbledore fiasco of last year) but it’s weirdly easy to want to hurt Dolohov when he pictures a dozen Potters, all of them bleeding out in the backseat. It’s not enough for an Unforgivable — he probably won’t ever be able to cast those, doesn’t have the stomach for it — but it’s enough for a stupidly powerful
And then there’s the other— stuff. Noises. When he comes home in the early hours of the morning and Harry’s forced to lie in bed, the sounds of Malfoy and whoever he’s picked up muffled but persistent through the wall. Sometimes there isn’t even anyone else, just Malfoy on his own, and he’s still loud. Sometimes Harry wishes the git would take a hint and cast a silencing charm.
“It’s raining,” Potter says unnecessarily the next day, appearing again in Draco’s window, damp and smiling. Draco had pushed it all the way open that morning to let the smell of the rain in, so the sound and feel of it could permeate the quiet room. He’d woken up feeling more settled and he’s been lying on top of his bed all morning, half-sleeping, half-reading. He’d never been in the Muggle Studies section of the library before, but he’d been looking for a textbook the other day and stumbled across a whole shelf of Muggle literature, undetectably extended by the look of it. He’d had to lighten the pile of books with a charm just to get them all checked out and upstairs into his room.
He turns to Granger, the most likely of the three of them to understand. “I’m stuck in some kind of— time loop thing. I’ve already done this twice. I know who’s in there and what’s going to happen.”
He keeps having these dreams where he walks to the very edge of the Hogwarts grounds, right up to the edge of the wards, which are always a visible wall of shimmering magic. When he steps through them the world dissolves into white and he’s stuck there, suspended in nothing, until he wakes up. They’re a lot better than the kinds of dreams he usually has but they scare him in a different way, like they might be real and if he tries to leave the school it'll be different when he gets back. Or, worse, that it’ll be like he remembers it from before and he’ll find that the castle he’s starting to relearn now will turn out to be something he imagined all along.
The party’s ok, though. Teddy’s having the time of his life and all of Harry’s favourite people are there. Draco looks good, tanned, which means he’s probably been spending more time working at the ground station than Harry thought, and it feels like a small, weighty punch to the stomach when Harry sees him and knows he can’t go over there and just— bury himself, like he wants to, but he gets past it and it’s easier, then, a little better each time, like exposure therapy.
Draco lets her slump them both down further, content to lie there against Harry. Harry entwines the fingers of their hands and Draco rolls her eyes but allows it.
Blaise, Dean.. Draco had even thought Michael Corner was attractive in a whiny, floppy haired sort of way, and then there’s Potter, of course, who’s not in the room, as far as Draco can tell. He hasn’t actually seen him at all since they stood in the hallway and grinned at each other like idiots. Quite embarrassing, now Draco remembers it, and that was before he even started on the tequila.
off like, ok, that can definitely happen but Draco wasn’t exactly expecting it, if she’s honest, she’d thought Potter would probably want to get Draco on her knees just to shut her up. And isn’t that a thought she’s now finding it difficult to shake out of her head.
“This is only happening because you’re you,” Draco says to him, taking his bag like Harry’s incapable of carrying it. He’s flustered, grumpy, but in the exaggerated way that means he’s not actually angry.
Potter looks down at the small stone in his hand like he’s already forgotten it’s there. “Yeah. Er, it’s a muggle thing.”
Draco barely has time to feel her stomach start to drop in disappointment before there are hands on her waist. She spins wildly and comes face to face with the eyes she’d just been scanning the room for: Potter, right there, inches from her nose. Draco is suddenly very aware of how sweaty and gross she probably looks but also, she doesn’t really care.
“Is it me or,” Harry starts as soon as he’s gone, unable to finish the sentence. Like, the guy is white but besides that it’s
“Funny, that’s what Harry always says too.” Ron said to Hermione, who was watching Harry carefully. Harry was confused.
“He’s only gotten worse since leaving Hogwarts, look at this – his sister married a werewolf, and they both died only a few months later. Bet he had a hand in that.” Ron said darkly, holding out a newspaper clipping to Hermione, who frowned at it, disturbed by the idea.
Harry had cheered up by the time he stepped into Ron and Hermione’s living room, or at least he’d pushed his worries deep down and forgotten them for now. He happily took the glass of wine Hermione held out to him with a large smile, and they took turns to make a toast, as they always did.
“No, Potter, nothing’s wrong. Just tired.” He replied at last, returning his gaze to his notes. “What did you find out?”
“And how is that my problem?” Malfoy finally looked up, annoyed. He crumpled the newspaper between his hands and threw it, with more force than necessary, at the bin.
“This is more like it!” Harry smiled and tentatively took Malfoy’s hand, glad when he didn’t shake his hand away.
Harry left soon after – Ron and Hermione were visiting the Burrow, and he needed to shower, change and return to Malfoy’s.
“Voldemort lost the war, and when he fell, the old Ministry fell too. The people who lead it now are just and fair, and unbiased.” Still silence, so Harry continued. “Hermione Granger, she’s the Head of Magical Creatures, and she’s a good person. She wants to make your lives better for you, in whatever way you want it. She doesn’t want to control or regulate werewolves – she’s trying to legalise you as people, not creatures.”
“Of course I’m fucking secretive!” Harry shouted back, slamming his hands against the table. “Do you have any idea what I went through, Malfoy? What I suffered?”
“Well, you looked cold.” Harry said simply, passing Malfoy the salt and pepper. Harry then automatically dropped a sugar cube in Malfoy’s tea before pushing it towards him. Harry often made Malfoy’s tea and coffee at work, and he knew how he took it.
“What do you mean, Potter?” Malfoy said tiredly, rubbing his hand across his eyes, leaning against the doorframe.
Harry looked up, towards the end of the room, where Malfoy stood, and felt something unfamiliar and scary tighten his heart to see Malfoy looking back at him.
“Do you kiss all of your friends and then run away?” Harry snapped, annoyed that he was having to explain himself.
“Yeah, sorry, I was asleep.” Harry sat down on their sofa (thankfully not the same one from all those years ago), reassured that he wasn’t interrupting anything.
“I don’t know.” It was true – despite owning all three, by blood, by law and by war, Harry didn’t know what it meant for him. “They become the Master of Death, I guess. That’s what the story says, anyway.”
“You look terrible, Potter.” Malfoy said without looking up from his notes as Harry stepped out of the flames.
“Well, I was hardly going to tell you that, was I?” Malfoy looked desperately embarrassed, but Harry grinned widely back at him. Harry was pleased – just because he’d only just found out about his feelings for Malfoy it didn’t mean they weren’t strong feelings. The framed photo was reassurance that perhaps Malfoy felt as strongly.
“Feels like everybody’s all coupled up except me.” Harry admitted, already half-finished with his third beer. Not normally enough to loosen his tongue, but he felt at ease in this bar, and with Malfoy.
“I’ll do it. You know I’m better at transfiguration.” Harry held out his hand to stop him. He waved his hands in a complex pattern in the air, sending tiny ripples of sky-blue sparks outwards from his fingers. Both men looked down to see their robes replaced with dark jeans and a plain coloured t-shirt.
Soon the meal was finished, and everybody relocated to the sofas and chairs; Ginny was perched on Harry’s sofa arm and Luna was happily sat cross-legged on the floor in front of the fire. She was fiddling with the napkin dragon she’d made earlier, and as Harry watched she carefully tapped its head with her wand, whispering something under her breath. Hermione patted Luna’s shoulder gently, as though encouraging or reassuring her. Harry saw the nervousness on Luna’s face and, pleased, knew what was coming.
“Is this about Connor Johnson? Did Neville tell you I rejected him? It wouldn’t have worked out, he’s not my type, and you know that.”
Pansy and Blaise kissed, to the sound of cheers and wolf whistles. There was a pale haze of light shimmering around them (a charm, no doubt) as though they were doused in sunlight, shining inside and out.
“Yes, I’d like that.” He frowned at his over-formality, but shrugged his robes off and instead pulled on a muggle jacket, watching Malfoy do the same.
“Why’d he wink?” Malfoy, almost slurring, addressed Harry, who shrugged, equally confused. Malfoy nodded, as though he’d got an answer, and leaned back into the chair, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry didn’t bat an eyelid, surprised at himself for how casual it felt.
“Ah, yes. She was researching a couple of things, if I remember correctly. This was a few weeks ago, love, and my memory’s not what it was.” Suzanne shook her head sadly before continuing. “She mentioned wolves, and I said to her, no wolves in this part of the world, pet, but I’m not sure she listened. And then she wanted to know about crimes in the area.”
The conversation, which had been flowing as freely as the beer all evening, suddenly felt stilted and awkward. Harry felt vaguely like he was expecting something, but he couldn’t think what it could possibly be, so he stood, chugging the last of his beer.
“Oh, Draco darling, don’t you look lovely?” She tugged him into a tight hug, ruffling his hair. “So smart, so handsome…”
“Some American witch? God, don’t let Hermione hear you saying that! Cressida Boone is famous for her campaigns for magical creature rights in America, you know.”
“Good work.” Harry found himself saying, and watched, discomfited, as Malfoy’s strange new face smiled back.
“Potter, what took you so bloody long?” Malfoy snapped as soon as Harry swung open the door to their office, and Harry, surprised, stared at him.
Malfoy sighed and didn’t bother replying, instead tossing over the file report, which had mercifully been green-stamped.
Malfoy flicked to the next page – a photo of Harry from this afternoon, walking home from Ron and Hermione’s (he figured he needed the exercise) – the caption described Harry coming back from ‘yet another’ one night stand. It was true that he looked messy, with his wild hair and ill-fitting clothes, but Harry didn’t think it warranted a whole article.
Harry looked for a long time, standing silently beside Malfoy, until he couldn’t look any more. He turned to Malfoy.
Harry hurriedly agreed and Suzanne left the table, collecting her breakfast from Sue and winking once more at Harry as the door closed behind her. It didn’t take long for Harry and Malfoy to finish eating and return to the cottage, having promised to pass on Sue’s well wishing to Cressida, who Harry had decided wasn’t feeling well and was taking a few days to rest up.
“Death gave it to the second brother to ensure his eventual demise. The stone lured him to his death, and countless since. Using it is highly dangerous - I believe it is partly to blame for Dumbledore going to his death so calmly – he wished to reunite with his sister.”
