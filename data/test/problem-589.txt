Putting the wine down, Malfoy leans forward on the bar, sighing. "Sixth year. All of it. The whole ugly thing, from end to end."
"It's not even noon." Draco watches as a rocks glass fills itself with three fingers of whiskey, neat, and flies gracefully across the room into Potter's grasp. "Don't avoid my question."
He knows what blood looks like after it's dried where it spilled. It's an old stain, nowhere close to fresh, but it's big, as though its living container was allowed to bleed out into a big pool. He suppresses the urge to retch.
"I'm 43. I don't have to," Draco says, sliding his hands along Harry's arms and feeling their girth and strength.
"I swear I've seen you make that same stitch five hundred times," Harry says a few hours later, sitting across from Draco and watching him continue his embroidery at the dining room table.
"I did see," Harry says, a bit kinder now, "that you've become a good man, in all this time. Molly loves you, you know, and that's no small thing. And this garden is—Malfoy, it's wonderful."
"You're awfully worked up," Griselda murmurs, lowering her eyelids coquettishly as she takes particularly languorous strides, and Draco feels nauseous at the implication of her guess. "But I mean—I'm not Voldemort. I don't actually care, you see, if I get Harry bloody Potter. I'd have to be as stupid as he was to focus on one person like that."
"Is that a hobby, or a much-needed change?" Draco asks, thinking of the oppressively narrow entrance hall he remembers.
"I may still add a bit more to the scenery," Draco muses, tapping the moon. "Stars? Maybe clouds." He hopes he won't have to. "I think—" He looks up, and he forgets what he thinks.
as he passes. He breathes through his nose as he wedges himself into the corner of the lift car, focusing on small actions like pressing the button for Level Two, and on the weight of his bag full of research digging into his shoulder.
"The Gala could be tomorrow, for all I care, I wouldn't send you in anything but my best effort." Draco stomps his foot before he can stomp himself, knowing what a silly little dandy he must look and finding he doesn't give a fuck. "Please, Potter!"
i'm excited to post the beginning of my second hp fic ever! i'm not sure how long it will be, although i have the story more or less plotted out to the end; that T rating should stay correct, though.
There's a thunderous roaring in Draco's ears as soon as the two disastrous words escape him, and he knows he must be flushing blotchy and red. Harry's eyes open wide, this time, and Draco looks away immediately with a hand clapped over his own mouth.
The following morning as Larch welcomes him into the office with a too-cheery “Good morning!” Draco notes, with mild annoyance, that Auror Pertinger's file has been taken from his desk. The case files have been replaced with his research, as if he's not allowed to possess both at the same time. Without even taking his bag off, he strides to Potter's door, and knocks in rapid fire.
Draco takes the jar of Floo powder from the mantle, holds it up to Harry like an offering at an altar. Harry reaches in slowly, grains of powder slipping from his pinched fingers.
"Greg is not emotionally sensitive. He can come some other time. This is an emotionally sensitive gathering." Draco shifts, the stonework of the kitchen floor uncomfortable beneath his knees.
"I know," Harry says, with a sigh and a smile. He unfurls the Shroud of Imperceptibility. "Be seen when I want to be seen."
"You really are a Pureblood," Blaise laughs, though he doesn't make the gesture again. "What, afraid all the other grownups in the room will hear us talking about SEX?" Blaise bellows this last word, and it takes every ounce of Draco's self-restraint, every second he's ever spent in Dr. Fiddlewood's office, to not tear Blaise's head off with his bare hands. But the room is too loud for anyone to have noticed Blaise raising his voice, and Draco exhales his relief.
"Right, you didn't mean to schedule me for the same day you brought over your little Slytherin school friends so you could tell them
"And then? What comes after that?" Draco hates the question even before he's finished saying it, knows there are very few answers he'll like, but he knows he has to ask it.
"My friends will be happy to see me, and not angry at me, and I will have a good time," Harry says to himself as they prepare to Apparate to the Burrow together. He's said this little mantra a few times since Draco's arrived to his house, as though he's not wholly convinced.
Draco doesn't take Harry to any of the aforementioned friends, not right away. Instead, he leads Harry back to the very edge of the dais. "Don't suppose you want to play musical chairs with the placards again," Draco says as Harry sits by the short stairs, taking deep, fast breaths that are edging too close to hyperventilation for Draco's liking. "We can mix up the Ministry officials on the Minister's other side."
"We have no ghosts in the manor. The very idea," he says with another snort. "Can you imagine Abraxas Malfoy dragging his ectoplasmic arse after me in the hallway, hounding me to continue the family line?"
As he climbs the steps, Draco imagines what kind of Harry Potter he'll meet when the door opens. There's still a strong chance he's been summoned by a stranger, but Draco's never liked to hope for the mundane. In school, Potter was a collection of sticks tied together in a boy shape, until he became a pubescent athlete with a broad, muscled core from riding a broomstick a hundred feet in the air. In his twenties, before his long disappearance from the public, Potter had balanced out—fit and lean, tight hips leading to curving thighs. Draco, of course, only took note because he took note of
No one else comes to the podium in Narcissa's absence. Some look to him, the son, but Draco bows his head and pretends to be too sad to stand. They look away.
"They're lucky I'm here at all. If they think I'm insulting her, they can add it to the list of all the other things they think of me, true or not."
He admonishes himself firmly as he approaches the door, shoes quieted by the runner carpet. He orders himself to go fall down the stairs for the crime of taking shallower breaths as he finds just the right spot near the door, unseeable by anyone glancing from the other side, and just as unable to look himself, but perfectly able to hear. Draco feels himself traveling 30 years into the past as his ears strain to pick out Potter's exact words that he has no right to hear.
friends—will talk to Draco ever again, out of respect for Harry's rekindled loathing of Draco. Maybe one of them will at least be kind enough to send back Harry's rejected wedding band so he can—so he can—
"You know very well I can't manage even one emotion, much less all of them." Draco's hands twitch with a desire to run them through his hair, but decades of being trained to keep his hands to himself and
He tries to find more time to sleep during the weekends, but the burning deadline of the Gala—and closer yet, actually showing Harry what he'll be wearing during a final fitting—doesn't afford him more than a couple extra hours on a Saturday night. At work, he supervises his stitching spells, adding hundreds of tiny beads to a robe he hopes Harry won't wear, and running enchanted silver floss through green silk. At home, he oversees gold floss instead, and he bemoans his own predilection for embroidery, especially this time on
In an instant, Draco sits bolt upright. Harry stands uncertainly by the back door, wiggling his fingers with anxiety at his sides. Draco misses that tic, the way he misses all of Harry's idiosyncrasies. Harry looks cleaned up, his hair short and clean, his salt and pepper beard trimmed nearly to stubble. He's even gotten new glasses.
"I'm not on my feet." Draco sticks out just the tip of his tongue at Potter's leg, which fills most of his frame of vision.
"Oh, but Harry, I'm so comfortable, and I've lost the remote," Draco says, dropping the remote to the floor where he could very easily pick it up, and where Harry couldn't reach it unless he sat all the way forward, dislodging Draco completely. "Besides, it's a classic."
he reminds himself, reworking his fabric choices. The inner robe is now a fine sage green linen, with an anti-wrinkling charm woven into its fibers, and trousers to match, cropped at the ankle. He transfers his choice of dark green silk faille to the outer robe, despite the weight. He dots an impression of beading along the collar of the inner robe, making a note to himself to ask more about the Southeast Asian part of Potter's family tree so he can represent it accurately.
He enters the wrong numbers into his payroll calculations twice in a row, and theorizes wildly about why Potter might have gone into hiding. He looks over an invoice for fabric acquired by Wilda Bucket, who's working on another Gala garment—this one for a mid-level Ministry official with wealthy parentage—and he daydreams of exploring the rest of Twelve Grimmauld Place. He doesn't even realize he's doing it until his imaginary self is reaching for the doorknob of Potter's bedroom, and he looks down to see he's initialed the invoice
"Fine. Maybe I will. Hope you like having my beautiful corpse on your conscience, Potter," Malfoy says behind Harry, amid the sounds of his chic shoes scraping against rocks. "It'd serve you right—augh!"
"Could you not sleep either?" he asks Potter's retreating back, and hides his fluttering hands in the canola stalks.
"I ought to ban the both of you," the barkeep remarks as Harry and Malfoy make their staggering way outside. "You're going to feel like shit in the morning, mark me!"
Lily looks up then, tucking a springy lock of hair behind her ear, where it won't stay. She looks more like Harry than Draco, with her brown skin and curly black hair, and her inky dark eyes are all her own. Of course, any ways she looks like either of her fathers are as coincidental as her name. It was no cakewalk, applying for parenthood while Harry dealt with the extremely public fallout of quitting the Aurors and looking for a new, much less dangerous career, but the adoption finally went through three months ago.
a big shoutout to Saphira in the drarry server for being an amazing beta for this chapter, and helping me firm up some future events!
That gets a loud, humorless guffaw out of him. "Go to Potter? Not hardly," he says, and he winces immediately after because he can hear the reflexivity in his voice, and if he can, so can she. She does look a bit smug.
"Of course I care what my date thinks!" Harry leaps back to his feet in his anguish, his black organza sleeves floating as he gesticulates in wild arcs. "Is this some weird Pureblood mannerism I'll never understand, to hold someone at arm's length until you're, I don't know, married? What is this?"
Harry locks his hands together behind his waist. “How do I know you’re not Goyle in disguise, or something?”
"I'd rather not talk of what I deserve," Draco says with a wince, looking at his knees. Between the closeness of Harry, the dark room, the lingering images of imagining what it would be like to undress Harry, he doesn't feel quite aligned with his own body. "But you shouldn't worry about it anymore. I'm only—" He licks his suddenly dry lips, sparing a thought for how dehydrated he must be lately. "You're alright, and you don't hate me, and that's all that matters." He misaligns even harder, feeling thoroughly disengaged from his physical form. His eyes feel crossed.
For a moment, Pansy looks astounded, then throws her head back to laugh uproariously. "How could I say no to that?" she asks, wiping away a tear of mirth. "Merlin's sweaty pants, that's one for the Pensieve. You looked as though you were about to pass out."
The old townhouse, on the inside, is a far cry from Draco's fuzzy childhood memories. The hardwood floors have been redone in warm tones that balance well against the soft teal paint on the wall, which hosts a watercolor portrait of a young couple he vaguely recognizes as Potter's parents. The pair give him a quizzical look, but not much else.
They'll look at everything around Potter, not at him. His backlit head will make Pansy's work the conversation starter, not the way his face has rounded out in the last ten years. The enchanted embroidery bowing their elegant heads to the wizarding court, as it were, will remove all attention from Potter's body, from his long absence from society. Every part of this ensemble is designed to let Potter hide in its beauty, deflecting unwanted attention so he can simply enjoy his evening.
"Suppose I can," he says, making a great show of pushing up his sleeves and rolling his shoulders before casting the very simple spell required. Draco shakes his head, and follows Molly's orders of heading out into the yard to join the other grown-up children, as she puts it.
a quick warning: there's a short part of this chapter that includes harry being angry and drunk, should that kind of thing bother you
A tiny room. A basement room, by the looks of the boarded-over windows near the ceiling. One door, behind which he hopes there are stairs. A wall that doesn't match its neighbors, haphazard and cheap-looking. Nothing in the room itself, he notes, careful anyway not to take any steps just yet. And on the floor—
Potter dismisses him as soon as the cheese is down to a nub too small to grate, chopping the last bit of cheese into tiny bits. The silence goes unbroken.
is that the end? that's the end. cat called this ending line "jane austen hands" which is how i stopped agonizing over it lmao.
"Constant vigilance," Williamson says from the corner of the dim room, startling Draco. His voice is comically gruff when he says it, and a wry smile twists his weathered face. "All sorts of charms standard to an interrogation room that would take time to apply to an office, that's what our vaunted Head Auror is after."
"I don't understand." Draco puts his fingers to his throbbing temples. "It's a robe. How can you find this—this deeper meaning in—"
Draco is so stupid. He's probably going to die, all because he was feeling soppy about protecting Harry, a trained Auror so competent in his field that he was promoted to the top of the ladder. He's going to die in a rank basement in Merlin knows where, and no one will find his body, and his mother will have to come back to England a second time in as many months to hold a second funeral. An empty casket funeral for her stupid, pigheaded son so concerned with bravery he forgot how useful cowardice is.
The banging on his door, a week after the Burrow dinner he did not attend, seems to have several sources. When Draco listens—ah, yes. Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Pansy. Pansy and Blaise are shouting abuses about how Draco must be smelling up the cottage after staying inside it for so long, Ron joins in with them, and Hermione tries a more peaceful tack by shouting that they just want to know he's okay over the din of the other three.
"It was only a bit of crack, which makes it funny, not naked," Malfoy says, counting off on his long fingers. "And I don't know what a Speedo is, but I'll tell you I thought what you gave me chafed awfully."
But he does as Granger asked. He tells Harry's friends about his split life between Head Auror Potter and just Harry, who until recently only ever seemed to surface when he was alone with Draco. He tells them about finding Harry mid-panic attack; he tells them about the episode that nearly took Thaddeus Dendron's head off, or so Ministry damage control said. He tells them about the canola fields.
The wards rumble gently as he passes through them, and he enters the fields surrounding the manor grounds. The plants here are tall, dotted with yellow canola flowers, and Draco lets his hands trail across their stems. The cultivated fields nearby grow much denser, so thick with flowers they look like a sea of gold, but here the plants' only owners are nature itself, and seed pods wobble and drop as Draco passes through. The sky is cloudless, bright with a moon that's nearly full.
"No, because my first design was a sham, and I'm professional enough to admit that," Draco says with a princely sniff. "We could give him to Wilda, you know. Or to Colm."
To Draco, it was memorable only because it was Harry. He can't even remember what else he did that day—only that it was absolutely routine. This weird little hit piece that had altered the course of Harry's life had had no impact on Draco's at all.
Potter huffs, and walks up the hall toward Draco, nodding toward the doors to Draco's right. "The sitting room, then."
"Yeah, something like that," Harry says, propelling himself forward to start swimming around Malfoy in slow, lazy circles. "Gets the blood pumping, Malfoy. What do Slytherins do, moan at each other about how life is bleak and nobody understands?"
"That's not properl—I mean, yes. Yes!" Draco wants to slap himself for being such a pedant at such a crucial moment, but Harry's got both of his hands. Then Harry's pulling Draco down to the floor, too, laughing at the way Draco yelps before they kiss.
"To the Granger-Weasleys first, then to Harry," Draco instructs Archimedes, petting his lovely white gold feathers and feeding him a strip of jerky. "And if that git Weasley tries to read Harry's letter, you have my permission to bite him as hard as you like." And then, "Don't bite the children. Just avoid them." And off Archimedes goes.
. But he sketches a smattering of moonflowers and devil's trumpets, all centered around a Luna moth that takes up most of the front real estate of the bodice, and writes that all these details will be tooled into the leather.
"Trust you to nitpick a word like boyfriend right after you said you want that for us," Harry laughs softly, pushing a fallen lock of Draco's hair back into place.
A hand peels down the top of the parchment, and Harry's face is on the other side. "I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important, Draco."
"Oh, saw it in the Prophet," Draco says airily, and quickly because he doesn't actually remember. Just another Harry fact he's absorbed and obsessively held onto over the years. "And—wait, I remember you being in those stupid Apparition classes we had to take. You never got your license?"
now. He has to have moved on, because he's been with other people, however short-lived those relationships were; he never thought of Potter then. Not really.
"If lives are at stake, Harry won't shut you out. Even if he's all wrapped up in himself." Draco doesn't realize he's let his hands rest on the table again until Granger pats one of them awkwardly.
"Well, Ron and Hermione do. When they're not busy. Hermione more than Ron, these days." Draco had expected Harry would take his hand back by now. "I think Ron's gotten a bit fed up with me, and I can't say I blame him."
"I can't say I'm not rusty at potions," Draco sighs. "Being as big a swot as I've become doesn't leave much room for practical application."
He'd been so afraid just to be near her and her treasonous words. Didn't she realize she could put her father at risk, criticizing Voldemort? Not just his high position as a Death Eater, but his very life?
Draco's heart stutters. He doesn't want to hear about this. "Have you now?" asks the autopilot graciously taking over his body. "Who's the lucky duck?" He distinctly remembers Potter coming out as bisexual in his twenties.
Harry grins, and Draco wants to hide under the table. He leans further over the organza instead, hoping the shadow will obscure his reddening face.
"Back at yours, then," Harry agrees, only barely regretting how little he got to swim as he follows Malfoy back to shore.
Pansy had had to concede that the sketch was, indeed, glorious. She practically salivated at the chance to make the halo of antlers, though she couldn't help but teasingly congratulate him on not simply outfitting Potter with a literal pair of antlers.
"Court is in session," Draco says as he takes his usual seat in the small room that overlooks the street. "Hello, Doctor."
Draco rubs at his eyes, blinking slowly until Pansy comes into bleary focus. Patterning paper covers an entire corktop table, with Draco hunched over a corner of it with a French curve. "Good morning, Pans," he groans. "Aren't you the early one?"
"Stand down, Potter!" Williamson bellows, his own wand pointed as he thrusts himself between Potter and Dendron.
"Privacy?" Draco wrinkles his nose, pulling his upper lip into a sneer. Even into his forties, Potter is still obsessed with his own celebrity status. The only reason anyone cares about the name
She cries. In front of at least a quarter of the British pureblood community, she cries, though she is not so indecorous as to sob. Andromeda, at last, rises from her seat on the other side of the front row and takes her sister by the hand to lead her away from the podium.
"I hate cars," Draco says as he bursts into Twelve Grimmauld, door held open by a smirking Harry. "Absolutely ghastly contraptions. What is the point of a mode of transport
"You're the one following me!" Harry splutters. "I came here for a peaceful getaway, and here you are, showing up everywhere I go!"
"I ought to, ought to change," Harry stammers, thumbing over his shoulder as he pulls his own trunks from his bag. "So I can see. Swim! So I can swim." He stumbles backward, clutching the trunks in two fists as Malfoy stares at him.
Then Draco pulls the tape around, finally able to step back. He glances up as he retracts his measuring tape, because he can't help himself. He expects to find Potter glassy-eyed and stoic, soldiering through the experience like being touched by Draco is one of the worst things to happen to him. (And for Potter, that would be saying plenty.) Instead Draco finds himself meeting Potter's eyes, and it's so
Potter only looks uncomfortable, and Draco has to contend with the fact that while Potter may or may not be a child, Draco himself is certainly being a
"I mean, if I didn't want to be seen, I'd just go on staying in here, wouldn't I?" Potter says, with a rueful smirk.
"He's brought wine!" an unidentified Weasley shouts, and a cheer lights up the majority of the crowd. Draco gets folded into the group by several hands, one pair of which takes the wine from him, and the only face he recognizes in that moment is Granger's, who looks at him with a rueful smirk.
Harry sprints for Malfoy, shouting, "I'm going to open up the back of that thing!" Malfoy cackles, taking off sideways with surprising ease. It doesn't take Harry long to catch up, though, and he wraps himself around Malfoy's back, reaching from both sides to try and grab the camera Malfoy clutches to his chest. "You're going to sell that to the Prophet!"
you, Draco. I like it when you're in my house. I like it when you eat my food, when you dress me, when you crowd into my space. I like when you look at me and you think I don't notice," he says. He grins, and his cheeks push the tears from his eyes, rolling down his face. "You make me feel like I've rejoined the living, Draco. Like everything is in color, like I didn't even realize how desaturated my world was."
"I'm going to remember that kissing chills you out," Harry chuckles. "That, or secretly you really do want to see me sacked."
"Lakes don't have deep ends, that makes no sense. Don't change the subject." Draco laces his fingers with Harry's again; it's so easy now. "Do you want to put the shroud back on? Take a breather, find your next pack of Gryffindors?"
"So I owled Ron and Hermione after I got your letter," Harry says as he shuts the door behind Draco.
"But they came into my house, Draco! My—" Harry's voice breaks. "My house! My godfather's house! I couldn't even be safe in
When Potter laughs in moonlight, it dances off his teeth, and he makes jokes about being a thief when he plucks a flower from its stem. Draco wonders if he could pay someone to Obliviate that one single memory, if only so he could stop thinking about it with every pause of his mind. That Potter's probably a man you could have a pint with. Maybe not Draco, but certainly
"Please let me hang up my coat, then tell me where I will be working while you—" Draco opens his eyes and regrets it, because Potter still looks unhappy. "While you change into something more suitable."
Potter is quiet, tracing Draco's lines with his fingers. "I suppose you know what my Patronus was, like anyone else in wizarding Britain," he says, head angling as he looks down at the sketch. "This is a work of art, Malfoy. You really—" His eyes flick up, catching Draco's. "You've come a long way."
"What about Greg?" Blaise snorts. "He'll just ask which of you's the woman and not understand why that's not polite conversation."
"Your touch-and-go contact with the Muggle world really is confusing, d'you know?" Harry replies. "You've got posh Muggle makeup in your bag, but you don't know an early aughts romcom when you hear one." He pulls the glasses off, inspecting them; they're gold-rimmed, octagonal with smoothly rounded corners. "Where did you get my prescription?"
"And for that matter—maybe I am reformed! Or maybe I want to be! But you—you, Saint Potter! You'll never let me, will you?"
He cannot. Draco cannot restart this project again. Pansy will have his hide, and then have it tanned and turn it into a chic jacket with matching purse. If she doesn't do that, she'll very realistically lock him out of the atelier.
Draco admits, as his pencil glides along the parchment, that he's designing himself a dress, not a robe, not a tunic—it's only just A-line enough to not count as figure-hugging, and hits ankle length. If he can find a similar mesh in a lace pattern he can stand, he might panel it into vertical stripes, but he won't decide just yet. He notes white cotton gauze for the lining of the dress bodice, cut on the bias so it'll stretch and drape with the mesh, and scribbles
But Lily is already headed up the stairs. "Goodnight," she says softly, once she's halfway up, then turns back around to keep climbing.
What he does notice, when he realizes where he is, is that Potter's not got his Disillusionment Charm up. (Either that or he dropped it in the span of time Draco spent checked out.) Draco's brain scrapes for a greeting, and comes up with, "A lovely morning." A groan follows; it's not morning, and that doesn't even begin to qualify as a greeting.
The door opens, just a crack, right before he manages to strike it. "Harry?" Draco says, voice straining.
"What?" Draco is lost as the pair of them swan into his home. Ron doesn't miss a step as he heads into the kitchen, looking for his pair of gardening gloves.
Draco claps his hand over Potter's wrist, stilling the hand holding his fork. "For the love of all four founders, Harry Potter," Draco says, "
"What I think of you is irrelevant!" It's like Harry is in another conversation entirely, Draco watching from afar and foolishly replying. "Why do you care so much?"
The fact of the matter is that Harry, or Potter, or Harry Potter, has gained weight in his time away from the public. He cannot be described as simply chubby, or stout, or solid; he is fat, unmistakably so.
He receives notice, with official Ministry stationary, that he has been given bereavement leave of five days. The signature is from some communications flunky, not Potter.
It's not the first time he's seen Malfoy in new light; no, that would go to the time Malfoy found him on one of his late night wanderings, and Malfoy met him where he was at. No worrying. No pleading.
"You don't have to keep doing that," Harry says, quite simply, and drops a pile of salad next to the shepherd's pie.
Within the hour, a soft pop of displaced air heralds the arrival of Hermione, and Draco wills himself not to let himself fall off the cliff's edge after all when Harry runs to her with glee.
"Please," Malfoy begs, words in a plaintive murmur. "Please, please don't tease me now. You have to know."
"I don't know about always," Draco mutters, pillowing his head against Harry's muscular shoulder. "But I suppose I'm trying." Dr. Fiddlewood would like him saying that.
Draco awakes with a gasp, slick with cold sweat. The fire has since guttered, leaving the room dark and chilled, and he shudders. His spine aches from the ungainly angle at which his sleeping body sank into the armchair.
Harry builds a cage for his every feeling, and a new face for his new placid self; one with shorn hair, and a cold expression that will not be shaken by evil. His friends don't give up on him, exactly, but then Hermione gives birth, and she and Ron are busy with a newborn and a toddler all at once, and Harry is a wall to the rest of his friends besides. All their efforts over several months are so much seafoam dashed against the rocks.
"I—" Draco feels that tension in Harry again, and he resents Ginny for introducing it into this part of tonight's cycle so early.
"I only ran into Potter a few times, back in the day." Williamson's hand on his beard stills. "But he seemed like such a fiery lad to me. Not a boy who'd grow into that, certainly." He nods at the glass again.
"I've earned my right to comfort!" Harry practically stabs himself in the chest with his own pointing finger. "And you—why are you even here? Isn't this well below your stupid Pureblood standards?"
"What Ron means," Granger says, and Draco whips his head to look at her, "is that while the apology is very,
And he curses himself before forcing himself to ask Greg, with a pained smile, what exactly it is that hops add to a brew.
"It didn't seem fair to treat you as equal to your father," Harry says at last. "Because you were a child. But it doesn't change that the rest of us were children, too, subject to your bigotry for years."
Draco forces his eyes open. As they adjust to the light cast by a single lit wand, his body exploding with pins and needles as feeling returns, he focuses on the figure in front of him.
i'm so happy to finally post this the end of this fic! it's been wonderful writing it, and i could not have finished this chapter without the beta expertise of ThestralHouseofBlack, Saphira, and Neev. i've been nervous about every part of this fic, from writing third person longfic for the first time in a long time, to the pacing and character development, and i have to thank all my cheerleaders from the start—my betas for this chapter, as well as spacehubsands, donnarafiki, gem♊️, crowry, and sunmoonandspoon—for keeping me on track and never letting me doubt myself.
Hermione hesitates, glancing at Draco again before saying to Harry, "I'm just so happy you're alive, and that we've found you." She holds her hand out. "Will you come home?"
It took Harry and Draco two days to go through the photo album together, mostly because Draco was still dehydrated and woozy. When Draco refused to go back to bed and get proper rest because he absolutely
"They said it's going to be a Legilimency treatment! How exciting!" Molly squeezes Draco's hands back.
"Oh, Draco," she says, with a sympathetic click of her tongue. "How long has it been since you used your magic? Fifteen years?" She waves, and Draco is pulled by an unseen force into the center of the room, right onto the massive blood stain. "I think I've gotten everything I wanted to say out of my system, and it's clear you really are alone. Let's begin your death, shall we?"
Draco scoffs, and shakes his head as he reaches for the next ring. "You're a pig. You'd better get it all out of your system before we head over, or someone's going to think you're flirting with me." He wants to kiss Harry's hand every time he puts a ring on it. He wants to press that hand to his chest, let Harry feel his heartbeat. He wants that hand to do so
"I know where trusting a Malfoy gets you, too," Potter says, narrowing his eyes. And he doesn't even have to elaborate; both men know the answer.
caffeine to be productive and setting himself a lighter read than last night's attempt. Then he tells himself he's perfectly capable of focusing long enough to brew one sodding cup of tea, he
"Of course I am." And with no more warning than that, they're off, just like when Harry Apparated them to the canola fields. St. Mungo's has a decent amount of wards in place, the better to protect their patients especially in the face of the Rabid Dog Curse, and Harry goes through them like old cobwebs.
"I know." Draco stops at his bench to trade his knife for a pair of shears. Hermione picks up a pair as well. "But maybe what I need to work on is figuring out how to not be loved anymore."
"Well," and Harry winces slightly, "maybe not on the floor. That was my mistake." They begin the process of collecting themselves up off the floorboards, Harry's body in particular full of the aches of a man in a physically demanding career, Draco's full of the pains of healing from recent torture. They lay themselves onto the sofa like a couple of pensioners, slow and deliberate followed by
"What else have you got, then?" Harry asks, trying to find at least one decent piece of meat in his stew.
Draco sighs. "Well, isn't that terribly Gryffindor of you? 25 years out of school and none of us can shake the pigeonholes a tatty old hat stuck us into." He picks up his satchel from where he dropped it by the stairs. "May we at least adjourn to a room with seating? Somewhere that isn't the foyer?"
"Draco, don't call Ron a cad," Harry sighs. "He's just—he's a busy man. He has a career, a spouse, children—"
He doesn't think Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley will live here, given they are adults with their own children, but he remembers, between old memories of war intel and new memories of Harry telling gentle stories about half-summers at the Burrow, that the Weasley hive is often buzzing with visiting family members. That, and perhaps he can convince the Weasley seniors to tell him where he
"You move quickly, don't you?" Draco smirks. They step nearer to the fireplace again, only three pairs ahead of them now.
And Draco explains, until Harry understands, that if a person's magic is like a well full of water and the water is being drained, then he wants to drop a Trace spell right into that water, and let it follow the water along its new path.
"It doesn't look like anything I've seen you design before," Potter says, with just a tinge of desperation, but it's his words that stops Draco mid-huff. Draco fixes him with a sharp look.
"Sometimes you win the case, but lose the fight," the old man says as he re-inks his quill with a few bobs of his hand. "The rest of us soldier on, but Potter always takes a day like this after one of those." Williamson shakes his head. "I don't know if—" A deep sigh. "Back to paperwork for this old man, eh? Go find something useful to do or take the day off, Malfoy. Don't you have another day's bereavement?" he adds, squinting at Draco.
"Then," Granger says, with a surreptitious glance at Harry, "I'm Hermione, and that's Ron." She points at her husband, clattering away with the kettle nearby. "Have a seat,
"Thank you for reminding me of my temporary nature," Draco says dryly, starting to push his parchments into his bag with insistent shoves.
Pain blooms, sudden and stinging, in the middle of his back, lancing up and down his spine as his body goes nerveless. Draco collapses in a twisted heap on the disgusting floor, watching a pair of feet swish under too-short robes toward him. A voice far above mutters something incomprehensible, and Draco is suddenly blind, his eyes wide and taking in nothing. He can't speak.
Eight more dead by the effects of Venari Virtute. Most of them found before they could be taken in by St. Mungo's, where hydration and nutrition spells—and in some cases, magically induced comas—are keeping previous victims alive. One hospitalized person has succumbed to the curse despite the best efforts of Mungo's Healers. Not Pertinger, he notes with a touch of relief that instantly turns to guilt. More victims, allegedly cursed by the dead, have been taken into St. Mungo's expanding Curse Damage ward.
There is no answer, not to his first bout of knocking, nor the second, nor the third much more raucous round. His knuckles feel raw. He lifts his fist for a fourth time, this time opting to pound on the door with the meaty side of his fist. "Harry!" Draco calls again.
"If you'd actually fucked Potter, maybe you wouldn't have gone rushing into danger to face down a wanted criminal," Pansy says, right in front of their whole little social circle, hand clearly itching for a wine glass or cigarette as she gesticulates with it.
"I'll have to. For dinner. It'll look bad on Harry if he has an empty spot next to him at the table."
"Hermione is downstairs, with Pansy," Harry continues. "She, er, set up an alarm in your wards, she said. When she was trying to take them down."
"You didn't think I actually needed that, did you?" she cackles, and she puts her empty wand hand to Draco's throat. "Or did you forget that I have the magic of
"I don't think you have any, actually! Too busy saving the world to get it up," Malfoy retorts. "Everyone in that bloody school thought you were some kind of sex god Adonis after that sham of a Triwizard Tournament, but I always knew better."
it was to get inside, posing as a friend of a friend. The details were dry to anyone who wasn't obsessed with Harry. Who was in attendance, what Harry wore, how much he drank, how many gifts he received, the three gifts he seemed to like most. An implication that he might be hitting the bottle a little too hard. Another that he was living up to the bisexual reputation, all because he'd kissed Charlie Weasley in what looked like alcohol-soaked joy, but also had been seen having a private conversation with Ginny. Because, of course, the only reason someone would smile at their ex in perceived privacy would be that they were shagging again.
"Stupid," Draco says to his empty flat, as he notes that the flowers continue to the back. "Stupid." The Luna moth receives moonstones for eyespots. "You're a complete twat." A smooth leather neckpiece rests just below the dress's collar, studded with the same moonstones, which will also be set into the buttons on the sleeves. He crosses out his note about mother-of-pearl buttons. Moonstone is fragile, and he ought to know better, but he's feeling dramatic.
By the time the hiss of the shower turns off, Draco has managed to clear a path through the front hall and is working on the sitting room. Without his wand, Draco has to sort through everything by hand, making piles of clothes to take upstairs later. Harry comes downstairs rubbing a towel into his wet hair, dressed in a different T-shirt and sweatpants. "You didn't have to do that," he says as he comes off the last step and puts the towel around his shoulders, with a tinge of embarrassment.
"Wave to them, Harry," Draco whispers as the crowd's murmuring of his name gets louder. "It's alright."
"Oh, don't act as though it was a secret I was keeping from you," Draco snaps, yanking his cape back on and buckling it with hasty hands. "You just didn't ask."
"Er, it might have been," Potter replies. He's wearing a simple moss green T-shirt with lightwash jeans in a relaxed fit, neither offensive nor inspiring. It's an upgrade from the ratty jumper he'd worn last time. "Are you alright?"
Harry puffs out a little laugh, the tension released from his body language like a thread that's been cut. "Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'll get you back, you know."
Dr. Fiddlewood has said he can become any person he likes, if he doesn't like who he is now. And Draco
"Fine." Hugo huffs and shoves his hands in his pockets before heading out of the kitchen. Rose rolls her eyes and follows her brother. Draco watches them leave, biting his lip.
"Oh, I'll jostle you around, then you'll see," Harry says with a wicked bounce of his eyebrows, and Draco sinks back down into the couch, hiding his red face by frowning aggressively into a throw pillow. Harry laughs so hard he starts coughing.
"Pansy?!" Draco shouts despite himself, pointing clear across the Great Hall. Harry had been headed elsewhere, claiming he'd spotted the Patil twins, but Draco cannot possibly leave this alone. Especially not after he sees who Pansy's with.
"No, I—oh, alright, what is it you want? A guide?" Harry holds out his hand in exasperated supplication.
"A man's got to take a lunch, hasn't he?" Harry replies, and leaves Draco with that as he ducks into his office. With the spell affixed to Harper Littletree, Draco has no more work to do but wait for the spell to give him its signal. Williamson shows him how to mirror the signal in one of the office's many alarms, and then he leaves, too glad to go home and clean himself up.
They hadn't meant to grow fond of each other in those weeks away from everyone and everything. Draco certainly meant to kiss Harry by the time he did, though, and certainly meant to invite him to his lodgings, and Merlin, he might have meant to fall in love with him, too.
But that sadness is for a future Draco to contend with. Present Draco is perfectly happy to wish to be loved.
Stupid to lie to himself, really. He's wanted to be in Potter's orbit since he was eleven, even if it took being his worst self to attract the other boy's notice. Potter's hatred felt better than Potter ever ignoring him, seeking the thrill of those green eyes focused on
"You can't say fuck you, you raised your voice at me last time and called me weird over a robe!" Draco points out. "I have to ask if you like it!"
"Enter," comes a voice from behind the heavy door. The secretary pushes at the door with a tense hand, and backs away. Draco rolls his eyes as he saunters inside.
"I say what you were hired to do!" Potter snaps. A cold thrill goes up Draco's spine at Potter's anger, and as much as he doesn't want to jeopardize this job, there's a rush in breaking through Potter's new icy exterior. He
"I see you're in early again," she says, making her way to her work station. "How lovely." Her tone does not seem to agree.
Harry is feeling the unusual heat of the day, and while it would be easy to take a cold rinse back at his cottage and get on with his day, he knows he'll just get sweaty again. He may as well enjoy the act of cooling off, and does his best to follow a big paper map to a hidden pond. The map itself is wizard-made, because by Muggle maps there are no bodies of water inside Connemara National Park, but local magical folk thought a bit of water might spruce the place up a bit. A pond only locatable, much like most wizarding places, by a wixen with intent, is advertised as a feature of a stay in Connemara Cottages.
"Who did you call?" Harry demands as he walks up behind Draco. "I'm not afraid to fight anyone you've summoned, you know."
"Come closer to where I've got my notebook," Draco says, beckoning Potter with a wave of his hand. "We'll start off easy."
Hermione sets her mouth in a line, looking at Draco grimly. "Ron's right, I suppose. I wouldn't advise you to think too much about it at this stage, Draco."
He can't, of course, stop thinking about his morning with Harry, by which he means he can't stop thinking of all the different paths it could have followed. All the delicious tributaries of kissing Harry and being kissed in return, of pulling away wrinkled robes and shirts and tracing fingers down hot skin, of Harry putting kisses there, instead.
Words he’d never thought Potter would say, especially not to him, nor sincerely. "Auror Larch will show you to your desk."
you to like. You have to see how it's logical, Potter, I—" The yawn that escapes him is one he's been trying to suppress for several minutes now. "I'm a professional. A client likes options."
"Draco, where'd you put my glasses? If you're trying to give me a hot girl transformation, it won't work, I'm bloody useless without them." Clanking behind Draco makes him whip around, just in time to see Harry's clumsy searching hand flip the (thankfully empty) jewelry tray right off the side table.
"What's wrong with that shirt?" Draco asks, because it's easier than talking about how it was his actions that interrupted Harry's timeline for something so mundane as an Apparition license.
"Well, ran out of time because of, you know, the war," Harry says, frowning at the faded design on his shirt, "and then there didn't seem to be a point. I could do it, and nobody was checking, so why bother?"
"More pub nights than I care to admit. Going to World Cups together. Harry coming with me when I finally admitted I needed glasses," Ron says with a chuckle. "What a bastard he was about it, for someone who's been a four-eyes since before I knew him."
There's a bright light in the room, making Draco squint as he wakes from its brilliance. Not from the window, because it’s still dead of night, but hanging over his wand on the bedside table. Harry is too deep in his drunk-sleep to be affected by it, apparently, still snoring away next to Draco, but Draco swings his legs out from under the coverlet and reaches for his wand as he sits up.
"You know," Draco says, fiddling with an errant packet of sugar, "I know I made an attempt at an apology when I blew down the door at the Burrow, looking for Harry, but I think it was just that. An attempt."
Harry fixes them tea afterward. Draco notes, with mixed feelings, that while he's not treated to any more flowering jasmine tea, Harry's procured a tea strainer for him in the shape of a gormless-looking giraffe, and filled it with loose Assam. He chooses not to comment on it, especially when he sees that Harry's drinking PG Tips, a Muggle brand he
Draco grumbles wordlessly, wriggling a big to burrow deeper into the tacky armchair. "What is this, another jab at my emotional honesty?" But she doesn't answer, spotting his deflection easily.
Draco doesn't realize how long he's been reading until he stands, at last, and his hips creak in protest, his legs tingling. The Malfoy line is not known for strong joints. He strides to Potter's door, knocking thrice as Larch had. When no invitation to enter results, he knocks again. "Potter," Draco calls out, only a little bit demanding.
"Why, I'm on the arm of my beau, of course," Blaise says, arching a single brow. "You silly man." He gestures behind him, to where Longbottom is pouring two drinks at the booze table. "What are
"Well, I was going up here anyway to put some actual clothes on, so it just seemed easier." Potter is almost all the way down the hall now. "Over here."
Pansy's head blurs in the fire for a moment, and is replaced by Blaise's. "I've had much smoother invitations for a threesome, for the record," he says with a dry voice and dispassionate features, then
"On my mother's side," Harry confirms. "They hated me. With every fiber of their beings, I knew they wished I didn't exist." He shakes his head. "I think if they hadn't been such milquetoast suburbanites always worrying about the neighbors, they would have drowned me in a sack."
Draco doesn't follow him out. Instead he watches Pertinger, his brain a spinning mass of cogs clicking together. She'd had no interest in Draco, but had wanted to curse Potter so badly she'd summoned superhuman strength just to take her shot. He finally trots out of the room, in time to have the entering orderly shoot him a nasty look.
Larch rolls his lips between his teeth, glancing around. Draco's aborted tantrum seems to have earned them some sharp looks, and Larch doesn't look so helpful anymore.
"I think we're a better looking couple than these two old men," Pansy says, smirking. "But I may be biased."
Pansy had said, and he knows she was just trying to needle him. It's their favorite way of expressing affection toward each other. But even now, as a firmly middle-aged man, Draco finds it too easy to fall into exactly what Pansy named it. Obsession.
"Don't you know? I'm the Boy Who Lived Again." Potter's expression is so lazy and disdainful, as his eyes take in all of Draco's unimpressive form, that Draco wants to slap it off his face. "I can do just about anything."
"Didn't even get that far," Potter says, wincing as though admitting to some petty crime. Draco takes another few steps closer, and Potter hasn't bolted yet.
For once in their long, complicated history, Draco is glad for Harry's fame, which keeps him from being subjected to long testy arguments about where he's allowed to go and why that list is so short. If the Ministry has sacked Harry in the past three days, the staff at St. Mungo's certainly haven't been informed, and it isn't long before Harry—and Draco, hurrying to keep up behind him—is escorted to that same strange, hushed part of the hospital where Draco had first seen Auror Pertinger.
"I like how you say 'Head Auror Potter' as though you've never met him before," she says, leaning back with another smirk. Draco doesn't miss her quick scrawl on the notepad braced against her crossed legs. She uses Muggle pen and paper; she's said in the past she found quills and parchment cumbersome, and Draco often wonders if she isn't right.
"I know that my heyday in the DMLE was—corrupt," Williamson says, as if admitting it to himself more than to Draco. "But sometimes it feels as though Potter's gone too far in the other direction, you know? Rigidity like his doesn't leave much room for corruption, but everything else is shut out, too."
"That's right," Draco says, watching Potter staring at the way the antlers twine against each other.
And the longer he goes without it, the more he knows what it is, twisting his insides with dread and panic and pure, crushing depression.
"I'm not flirting now, you arse. I mean it." Draco squeezes his fingers tight around Harry's wrist, as if to better prove how much he means it. "I know you like to fling yourself into the fray to prove how much of a hero you are, but for once, think of your suffering husband and be at least a bit of a coward."
"Brilliant," Draco says, laying his satchel into place as he chooses the same Chesterfield armchair as his first visit. "Once I show you this new sketch, you'll understand why I had to abandon ship." The satchel pops up into table form, and Draco makes a show of opening its drawer and removing the parchment inside. "Here."
"I, uh, forgot to clean up, I wasn't expecting company," he says, as if the mess hasn't clearly become a fixture of the house, and as if he hadn't invited Draco himself. Draco's fingers twitch at the sight of it all; doesn't Harry know a single cleaning charm besides Scourgify? Even after all this time, given a wand, Draco bets he could have every item back in its place or in the bin where it belongs in no time, done and dusted.
"No, you've got me. I'm a lazy fool." Harry curls his upper body just enough to brush his lips against the very top of Draco's forehead. "Just don't sing along."
Potter looks—bemused? "Shouting at you seems a bit redundant, I think?" he says, with a nervous chuckle, scratching at his scalp. "Seems you just did all the shouting yourself."
"I don't work." Malfoy shrugs. "No one will hire me on. No one will let me open a place of business, either. Pick a different topic if you want light conversation, Potter."
making my grand entrance by being punched in the balls by Harry Potter. People will think nothing's changed."
Malfoy plants a fist on a jutting hip. "What should I wear, then, Potter, if not the clothes I brought specifically for outdoorsmanship?" He flaps his other hand. "Shall I go nude?"
"Well spotted," Potter grunts, managing to turn the doorknob enough that he can get the door the rest of the way open with his foot.
Malfoy huffs, rubbing at his arms. "I am sorry. Sorry for calling Granger—that word." He glances at Harry, and when he gets back nothing, he continues, "For getting on Weasley for being poor."
Potter, Draco reminds himself. He clears his throat. "I'm a professional. If a client wishes full secrecy, then I grant it, outside of my business partner." Pansy, who could drag anything out of him even if they weren't in business together. "Let me guess—you don't want anyone to know you wear clothes?"
"Oh, shut up," Draco says, sinking down in the armchair. He flops an arm over the side, reaching for his bag again. "Nearly forgot—there's a headpiece, as well. Pansy hasn't finished enchanting it, but the body's complete."
The Ministry has released his father's body to the family for funerary arrangements, which is the only reason Narcissa has returned to England. Lucius will be added to the family catacombs below the manor, like every Malfoy before him, and Narcissa will perform the last rites that her wand has been cleared for.
Yet again, Draco doesn't quite remember how he gets to his next location. He's dimly aware of walking back out to the lobby, and the squeezing sensation of being Side-Alonged, but he doesn't remember going up the stairs at Twelve Grimmauld Place. Careful hands lay him out on a soft surface that must be a bed, and pull off his shoes, open the throat of his robes and the shirt beneath. Draco puts his own groggy hand to the fly of his trousers; he hates to sleep with a waistband choking him. He's fairly sure he's not the one who finishes the unbuttoning, and then his trousers are being tugged off his legs.
"I'd say she's just like her mother, then," Draco snickers. "Nose stuck in a book, nose stuck in a mobile—she's reading something, isn't she?"
"I mean, I think these are my best rags now," Potter says, plucking at the mockup he's worn all through lunch.
"Aging is overrated," Draco says, unfastening his pincushion as he heads for his satchel. "All the magic in the world, and I can't stop my knees from crackling like a hearth in winter."
Suddenly, Harry's hands are wrapping around the backs of Draco's upper arms, and Draco doesn't get to talk to the floor or look into nothing anymore. He's faced with Harry's burning green eyes, the determined set of his full mouth, the way his jaw flexes with an emotion Draco is frightened to pinpoint.
"Like this," Draco says, and he repositions himself to kneel in front of Potter rather than beside him. He draws in a big, exaggerated breath, letting his chest puff up tall. Potter is not imitating him, but Draco breathes out with the same overwrought slowness anyway. "Do it with me."
Draco holds out his hand for the parchment, chortling. She must have misread. "Now what would we do with ten thousand spools of—"
"Oh, come off it, an entire paragraph telling me to tell you I'm too much of a mental invalid to go to a party? Draco, please."
"Don't tell me you had someone in mind," Draco tsks. "Do you even know who's single right now? I'll have to make a list for you." Alright, maybe his autopilot isn't quite so gracious after all, because he could
At the very back of the room, framed by the massive cathedral window, is the table where Hogwarts professors would preside over every meal, including the podium where Dumbledore once spoke his strange words before every term. Not many people are back here, as if the dais the table sits upon wards them off. There are little placards on each empty plate, and when Draco brings Harry close enough, he reads the names. One for the Minister of Magic, dead center. A few more for other high-ranking Ministry officials, including the head of the DMLE, to the right. And to the left, the Golden Trio. The official heroes of the war.
The last thing he remembers with any clarity is the bed dipping under a second body beside him, and Harry's voice whispering, "Goodnight, Draco."
Potter doesn't speak to him as he works; Draco may as well be another ghost in any wizarding home. Draco thinks he sees pasta go into the pot, and when the tray comes out of the oven, its contents look distinctly like walnuts. He's not incompetent, he cooks for himself in his flat, but Draco doesn't know what to expect.
His ears prick to the scuff of an uninvited shoe against the floors outside, and his heart drops into his stomach, his skin cold. He knows, he
"So I've heard!" Draco says, then blinks slowly as he dulls the sharpness in his voice. "Hobbling me for not being an official part of your department will not solve the case. I just want to see her."
, and Auror Potter calls for backup to help him and his team transport the children to warmth and safety. Auror Potter also goes on to round up the bastards who thought of children as a disposable resource, catching the ones who escaped the house within the week.
"As I recall," she says, pulling her hands away from Draco's—a poor sign, "you denied you had a problem last time, too. For a long while, as a matter of fact, even when it was clear to everyone around you that you hadn't been such an awful twat since you were a teenager. Not to mention that you had lost total control of your life and yourself." She piles her hands on top of each other in her lap. "Telling me you're not drinking, over and over again, is not compelling evidence, Draco."
that is holy did you finish the, the," Potter snaps his fingers, "the green and silver job! If you were working on this as well?!"
Silence again. Draco wonders how honest all of Potter's assurances that he liked the robes might actually be.
, and because there's two of you in there, it feels like there's somehow, I dunno, double the colors?"
"Dash of cream, no sugar, five seconds of a cooling charm and no more," Harry recites proudly, as Draco takes the cup Harry holds out. "Yes, Draco, I did." And Draco hadn’t meant his question as a test of Harry’s memory, slipping up even now, but Harry is so pleased with even this small flex of his power of recall that Draco lets it be.
"You should know by now I don't do anything just because I'm asked, or my life would look very different now," Harry says.
"When did you get this out here, anyway?" Draco asks, grunting as he winds the umbrella's strap shut. "Were you sneaking about in the fields at night or something?"
"No, Potter, not the woods. It's for blackmail." And Harry turns back, mouth slack with surprise, just in time to get caught with the flash of Malfoy's camera.
Worse, he realizes that Pansy is tearing up, and when he replays her words in his head, he can hear the wobble in them. "You look terrible," she says, sniffling even as she furrows her brow into a glare. "You're unbalanced. You're forgetful. You slur your words sometimes."
"What is this? An intervention?" Draco folds his arms across his chest with a pout. "Go put on the clothes I've brought you so I can make sure they fit as well as I know they will."
In the morning, Draco's Healer says he's free to go, then asks him, now that his contract with the Ministry is up, if he wouldn't bring his research to St. Mungo's to help them cure the victims of the Rabid Dog Curse.
"Oh, you love it," Malfoy says, crossing his arms and sneering. "Everyone's so far up your arse they're crawling up into your head. That's why it's so big. It's a wonder you can keep it upright."
have to go back to work, so Draco pulls himself together and works on folding up the massive umbrella.
"Why would I go upstairs? Where are you going?" Draco demands, gesturing at the clothing littered all over the room that Potter's not taking with him as he exits the room. "Potter!"
Draco is nothing but his most professional self, he's quite sure, as he begins to parcel out the pieces of Potter's green ensemble. He can feel how he sways as he lays out each garment, but he's quite sure it's not noticeable.
must discover if this client request really is from Harry Potter, and the only way he's going to do that is to fully caffeinate and set out to that undisclosed location himself. He takes an enormous, scalding sip of coffee, then signs off on the maybe-Harry-Potter client request. Accepted. The document duplicates itself, and one copy vanishes.
