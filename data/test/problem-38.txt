I have now found a betareader. topgngoose has taken it upon himself to help me with my story. So thanks a lot for making my baby all better :).
"Thank you, my Lord. I'll make sure to tell them," Draco replied, trying his hardest to remain polite and detached from the elderly wizard, who had deftly manoeuvred him towards the darker, calmer part of the ballroom after he had claimed a minute for himself. His friends had all been very vocal in their compassion for his situation. Former housemates, with whom he had less of an immediate relationship, had offered their support, despite everybody knowing, that they would not even look at him, had he not entered at the arm of the 'saviour'. Used to months of isolation with only his mother, and now Potter as company, the chatter had become too much for the blond. Yet, now he called himself a fool for letting this Lord manoeuvre him into a corner.
As was proper, Kreacher had positioned the Malfoy family at the end of the table, with Lucius at the small side with Narcissa and Draco framing him. Harry, as always, occupied his chair at the head of the table, leaving a good fifteen feet between the attendants of this dinner. When everybody was seated, he looked at the distant Malfoy family and suddenly could not contain his laughter at the absurdity of the situation. The stress of the last twelve hours finally found an outlet, and when the Malfoys joined him with chuckles of their own, he only laughed harder until tears streamed down his cheeks. Pulling out his wand, he gestured for them to step back before casting, "Deminuere."
"I know what you have thought!" Harry interrupted with forced calm. "And I could not be any less inclined to discuss it with you. You entered the Rite of Compulsory Surrender with me, and though I am aware that everything is better than receiving the Dementor's Kiss, I would suggest you take your time to review what you know of me and my actions towards your family." Pulling a sheet of paper out of a drawer, Harry jotted down a few things before throwing the paper at Lucius' feet, well, knees in this case.
"True," Alexander commented. Then he drank the rest of his coffee, before pushing back from the table. "In that case, we better get him a competent Potion Master. I mean Draco's good, but he's no master."
"Lady Malfoy, Mr Malfoy, Draco," demonstrating impeccable manners, Daphne entered the house, offering a courtesy worthy of her pureblood upbringing, before unceremoniously pushing a huge canister of milk at Harry. "I expect a cup with one spoon of sugar and two ounces of milk at nine, eleven and three o'clock."
That was the general consensus, until Pince whispered towards Potter, "What just happened? He is the Minister of Magic. He can get tickets to any game."
Chuckling, the raven−haired shared, "She worships the ground he walks on. Honestly, he could pick up a pebble, wind a string around it and she would wear it proudly. To Victoire, Teddy's metamorphous abilities make him the most impressive wizard she knows, and she won't let him slip through her fingers. As soon as she learned how to write, she set up a bethronal agreement."
Raising his eyebrows, because finally, the man was asking the right question, the raven-haired replied, "Not a clue, to be honest."
That place of 'honour' was reserved for one particular dream. Walking into the carnage of the Potter's home, he felt hollow and as a spectator in his own body. Climbing over the body of a hated rival, he felt nothing. Watching the door to the nursery being blast open, regret rose in his heart. Then he was forced to watch his beloved Lily shielding her baby, before hearing the cruel words 'Avada Kedavra'. Seeing the light vanishing from her eyes, however, was not the worst part. The worst part, was an adult Harry Potter rising from the floor after he had caught the collapsing form of his dead mother. Fire burning in his green eyes, he stepped up to Severus, shouting at his face, "You killed her. It was all your fault." Then, cold, and uncharacteristically detached, he demanded, "Finish it!" Severus knew Lily's son to be right, it was all on him. Severus wanted to change the past, longed for it with his entire being, but he could not. When he looked down, he saw his own hand holding the wand, heard his own voice whispering the incantation, 'Avada Kedavra'. Then the boy's body fell down, right beside his mother, as if he had been but a puppet, whose strings Severus had cut.
"Actually, it's a mixture of spices," Ginny revealed. "I'm quite partial to the 'Spiced Chai Latte' myself. Let me show you."
Seriously, the raven-haired stated. "What you did today … I don't think I can ever express how much that means to me. But maybe, I can give you an idea. If you wish, I will consider your debt paid in full."
Frowning ever so slightly at the worried look, the witch pondered, "It's not about the ring. This is a token, similar to Lucius' cane. Where did you buy this?"
Looking his Auror dead in the eye, Robarts stated, "You pinpointed the location of Lucius Malfoy's item in Westwood Gardens. I don't care if you find the damn thing under a bush or by Malfoy's side!"
“ Alright fine, I’ll play with your hair, BUT only until you fall asleep, ok?” Draco says, starting to twirl black locks in his hands. Harry groans in response, enjoying the pleasant feeling.
“ Hi Harry, uh those are for defensive moves, when I have to block a hit so I don’t feel the impact,” Uraraka explained, blushing slightly and trying to look anywhere but the man’s naked chest.
But a strong hand stopped her before she could touch it. They made eye contact and stared at each other in silence.
“Mixed,” Albert said. “The ministry made some last-minute changes to their witnesses and experts. Probably hoped to throw Reginald off. Bastards clearly coached them all on what to say,” Albert recounted.
“Sort of. I want to focus on the need for prison reform,” Harry said. He felt himself flush at Nott’s intense stare, and waited to be scoffed at.
“Ash...” he pleaded as Burke harshly groped his balls before moving his hand lower. If Burke succeed in violating his genitals any further, Harry didn’t feel it because his mind was suddenly flooded with new knowledge. He gasped as he struggled to process it but was desperate enough to hold Asherath’s gaze as the dementor shared with him something he knew no other wizard had been given before.
Nott smirked at him, but moved to the other side of his cell and turned his attention to Crabbe. Harry thought the man could probably still see him in his periphery, but at least wasn’t watching him full on. Malfoy merely nodded and went to lie down on his cot. Harry figured Malfoy probably understood Harry’s discomfort. It must have been a hard adjustment for someone as dignified as him.
“But I won’t be able to practice,” Harry insisted. “I’m better at remembering if I can feel the spell, you know?”
Hale handed him the third scroll, which contained a list of government policies surrounding Azkaban, with some added explanations in plain language. Hale also included a list of seemingly random topics, but he indicated how they indirectly impacted the prisoners in Azkaban.
“You ought to thank me, Nott,” Burke gloated as Albert’s cell door closed once more. Albert tried to snort incredulously at that but what came out sounded more pained than anything else.
“Er, there was a dragon egg...” Harry wondered how he could explain without mentioning Hagrid. He wasn’t sure if Hagrid could still get in trouble after all these years, but he didn’t want to chance it. Luckily, he didn’t have to elaborate since the hall door swung open and a guard called out “Nott, your judicial-wizard is here.”
“Stop dallying and get in line,” Burke called from his place at the front of the line. He was still watching Harry and didn’t look pleased that yet another prisoner was acting friendly towards him. Stan quickly put on his shirt. He looked like he wanted to say more to Harry, but ultimately shrugged and scurried away to collect his shoes before joining the line.
“If Harry can’t hold them and a guard remarks on your recovery, we can say that another guard healed you to avoid additional problems from the ministry. It should be believable given recent events,” Lucius proposed. “Though we shouldn’t draw attention to it if we don’t have to, thus the illusions.”
“It seems like you already caught Burke’s notice,” pointed out Nott. “He’s a nasty piece of work. It certainly makes me glad I’m past my prime.”
“You’re not as clever as you think, Potter,” Burke responded angrily. “Doesn’t matter which way you twist it, we’ve got
“Gin, I – fuck, I love you. I know it isn’t right or fair of me to give you the ring when I... I... I’m sorry. I’m painting a target on your back. I just – there’s no one I trust more, and I need you... You have to know-” Harry stumbled as he tried to explain his regret at asking her to hold his horcrux.
“You asked it to kiss Burke?” Runecraft jumped in eagerly, like a shark that smelled blood in the water.
“Relax, Draco. We’re not going to turn on your new b-” Zabini started to say but was interrupted when Crabbe came out of the classroom.
Living with the Weasleys was difficult in a way it never had been when he was a child. There were reminders of Ginny everywhere, and every kindness the family showed him just piled on the guilt.
“Time to pat him down,” said Burke and stepped towards Harry. He ran his hands down Harry’s sides more thoroughly than the auror did when he was arrested. It made Harry feel rather uncomfortable. When he reached Harry’s trousers and felt a bump near the pockets, Burke reached into each pocket and pulled items out.
It was a valid argument. He really had no business making decisions about what was best for the other man. He could only decide what he would be willing to live with. He thought his own conscience would not allow him to risk hurting Draco, and thus he held back. But rejecting the man now would hurt them both. And frankly, Harry was running out of strength to resist what he truly wanted if it was actually within his grasp. He resolved that he would allow himself this, and spend every day making sure Draco had no cause to regret it. “Alright... that’s fair,” he admitted.
“It might not be tomorrow,” Malfoy conceded. “However, I would be surprised if you weren’t back in time for your end of year exams. You ought to keep on top of your subjects.”
Burked hummed in satisfaction and drew his wand away. With horror, Harry realized it was the first rune in his prison number.
“I just want to avoid all the questions... and stares... it’s been non-stop since I got back,” Harry admitted.
“You’re probably right that blood magic might be the key. You won’t find any useful books in the library though. Maybe in the restricted section, but not on the general shelves,” Nott said.
“Most of the guards aren’t hired for their intellect,” added Mulciber. Lucius and Harry supported Albert’s weight while Mulciber bent down to help pull up his pants. Mulciber didn’t complain even though it put him awfully close to Albert’s junk. “If they come relatively cheap and are able to keep secrets, then they’re hired. There are some exceptions. Believe it or not, Burke isn’t usually this much of a moron.”
There was an awkward pause as both Wiblin and the remaining guard watched Harry from the door to his cell. Clearing his throat, the guard finally decided to close the cell. Harry jumped at the sound of the lock.
“What?” asked a bemused Harry. He’d never heard that particular expression, and he shared a dorm with Seamus Finnegan.
“Harry,” Scrimgeour cut in. “You don’t know what you’re saying. These- these accusations you’re making – well, it takes a process to investigate. I can’t just fire someone because someone said something against them. It takes time to really investigate.”
By the end of the day, Harry not only finished his backlog of assignments, but also started moving forward with his alchemy studies thanks to Nott. In return, Harry helped Nott and Ron with their Charms work. Bored, but not wanting Hermione to ask how he managed to complete everything already, Harry decided to read ahead in Defense to make sure Snape couldn’t embarrass him by asking about subjects they hadn’t even covered yet. Before Nott left to return to his common room, Harry asked him if he would be willing to share his old Ancient Runes notes as well so that Harry would have something to do on Sunday while pretending to still catch up on work.
“They couldn’t interview us all at once after two aurors took you away. Gin’s interview had to wait until after ours, which meant McGonagall
“Just a cautionary suggestion,” responded Nott with forced levity. “Given the criticism the ministry is under, you don’t want to be the person to add fuel to the fire.”
Once Albert dressed, the guard heavily insisted that he leave the room. “Of course. It’s standard protocol to leave judicial-wizards alone with their clients,” Albert said with a cruel smirk. Harry barely kept himself from laughing at the sour look on the guard’s face.
“Just as well. Not sure how we’d have pulled that off without being able to read and write them,” responded Nott. “What about arithmancy?”
“The other prisoners can’t touch him,” Burke interrupted. Harry could hear impatience in the man’s voice. He looked towards Perkins, hoping the auror had finally decided to call foul on this whole thing. Unfortunately a few seconds of silence make it clear to both Harry and Burke that Perkin’s objections were over.
“You should get some sleep,” suggested Albert. Harry didn’t think he could sleep, but nodded at Albert’s suggestion all the same. He knew they were tired, but got the impression that they would stay up with him if Harry refused to sleep. Harry extinguished the conjured light, returned his wall to its original state, and reluctantly made his was to bed. It was hard to lay down in the same spot Burke had pinned him to only an hour ago.
“Oh, well… She… That is…” Harry was surprised that Lestrange actually seemed at a loss. Neither Malfoy nor Nott seemed to be gloating either.
Harry’s fault. And while he had no intention to make Draco wear another horcrux before getting pregnant, it didn’t remove the fear that it could end the same way.
When he finally felt like he wouldn’t pass out, Harry relinquished his hold on his sheets and opened his eyes. Burke’s vacant stare greeted him. Instinctively, Harry lashed out and pushed the man away from him. Burke’s body toppled off the cot and on to the floor with a slight thump. The body landed facedown and the wand that had been loosely held in Burke’s hand rolled away. Harry vaguely registered the sound, but his eyes remained on the unmoving body. With Burke’s pants bunched around the knees, the legs remained in their bent position, which resulted in Burke’s arse lifted slightly in the air. It might have been a comical sight if Harry wasn’t so traumatized.
He was only saved because something distracted Burke from finishing the job. When Burke’s grip loosened, Harry gratefully gasped in lungfuls of air between coughs.
Harry could do nothing as Burke carved the runes and numbers into his neck. He stared over Burke’s shoulder at a spot on the wall and tried to ignore everything. It wasn’t the pain so much as the fact that he felt helpless. He couldn’t stop them, and if Burke was telling the truth, he wouldn’t ever be able to remove it. Even when Dumbledore rescued him – if Dumbledore rescued him – Harry would never be able to truly put it behind him. The tattoo would always be a part of him.
Eventually they moved into Harry’s sight. There were two other guards with them, though Harry didn’t let himself relax since one of them was Wiblin. But it was Albert’s appearance that caused him more grief than either of his two least favourite guards.
Burke no longer looked amused. Harry felt his hands start to tremble as he watched Burke, so he clenched them on the meal tray hoping Burke wouldn’t notice the impact his presence had. Harry could still hear the other guards passing out the meals further down the hall, but that didn’t mean they would stop Burke if he wanted to hurt him. After all, Wiblin helped Burke give Harry the prison tattoo.
Harry burnt what remained of the body, and then his clothes. When Hermione joined him back at the spot of their last campground, he didn’t tell her what he did. If she thought he looked horrible, she had so many other reasons to choose from to explain why. She herself did not look good after that close call either.
“I don’t know minister,” Harry said, doing is best to keep is voice pleasant and even. “It’s going to be awfully hard to be your mascot when your employees insist on displaying their corruption on my body. Between my hand and my neck, I’m starting quite the collection. I’m sure it’s not exactly the message you want to send.”
“Are you sure you’re clean enough, Potter? You might want to savour this opportunity” Burke said. Given that Burke hadn’t seen Jugson’s confrontation with Lucius and Nott, he had no way to know if Harry remained unharmed because of the amount of witnesses previously in the shower area.
Harry knew it looked odd to Hale that he was willing to pass along love notes to the woman he had been arrested for cursing. However, it wasn’t about Bellatrix. Harry did it for Rodolphus. If Bellatrix got some comfort from the letter, well, that was regrettably unavoidable.
“Sure, but you have features from your mum too. Everyone says I look like my dad but have my mum’s eyes. James looks like a replica of me,” Harry said.
“Yours would be too, if you did what I did,” Harry said softly. Draco was quiet as he tucked Harry in. He sat on the edge of the bed when he was done.
Both Harry and Hale stood up once their meeting was coming to a close. Harry realized there was one more aspect they hadn’t discussed.
magic. He did not mention blood magic outright, but Harry suspected that was what his professor was referring to, and he was hopeful knowing it was possible.
“This is getting us nowhere,” said a witch. “Potter, were you and Burke the only ones in the cell aside from the dementor?”
Harry spent these days reviewing coursework with the death eaters. The Lestrange brothers and Mulciber seemed impressed with how quickly Harry picked up all of the defense against the dark arts spells, and consequently the dark arts. Harry wouldn’t admit it out loud, but he was finding the dark arts lessons morbidly interesting. He no longer protested learning dark spells, and even asked questions to ensure he had a good grasp of what he was learning. Mulciber kept saying Harry was some sort of prodigy. Harry thought it was ridiculous but felt oddly flattered all the same.
“Well, I didn’t know you then... although, I always knew you were smart. And if pressed, I may have admitted I found you somewhat attractive,” Harry said.
“Wait – did you or did you not cast the cruciatus curse?” asked the voice Harry now knew to be Mulciber.
He didn’t know what would happen when he inevitably ended up in purgatory’s train station again. He hoped he’d be able to board the train and go Heaven or Valhalla or whatever the
“No, Potter. I don’t want to hear any more nonsense about you being a bad person. There is so much good in you. I wish you could see it. As atrocious as you think you are because of the horcrux, you need to understand that that one mistake, as terrible as it is, does not wipe away all the good in you and all the good you’ve done. I’m still with you because every day you show me that good side. I know there is another part of you. A darker part that can... create a horcrux. But Harry, you never let it out. You actively fight against it to the point you overcompensate. I know you think no one would want you if they saw that part of you, but I’m aware. I see all of you, scarhead,” Draco said, saying the last bit softly. He cupped Harry’s face between his palms. “I knew who you were when we started dating. And I’ve loved that man long before then too.”
“Oh,” Harry answered. If they could prove it, then Harry wasn’t sure how he was ever getting out of the prison.
“What is that?” asked Ishanders. Both dementors became excited as the answer to their riddle was finally known. Harry, for obvious reasons, didn’t share their enthusiasm.
When Ron left, and their sense of desperation and despair increased, one insidious thought kept creeping in. If Harry was the only one that could kill Voldemort, he had to make sure he didn’t die... at least not permanently. And Harry knew of a way to make sure of it. He knew he could provide his friends with a way to bring him back if they needed to.
“It was strong enough to drown you?” Draco asked in surprise. Though he was confused about how an inanimate object could drown someone.
Sensing that Harry was more than willing to forgo defense review if it came tied with dark arts, Lucius decided to cut in.
“You should be thanking me. I agreed to work overtime just to ensure that you would be settled in,” Burke responded mildly. “Do you know how we help prisoners adjust to their new circumstances?”
“Found what, Harry?” Draco said. Harry wasn’t very coherent due to his inebriation. Part of Draco considered letting Harry sober up before they had this conversation, but he knew Harry would clam up again if he waited.
There weren’t many places to hide a wand in the barren cell. If he pushed it towards the toilet bowl, it would be further from the guards. Regrettably, Harry wasn’t sure if the shadows were deep enough to camouflage the wand. Summoning the wand to rest under his bed was risky, but it also was the closest hiding spot and time was of the essence. It seemed impossible to hide the wand quickly but stealthily. Harry urged his magic to gently pull the wand towards him at a reasonably slow pace. Luckily the wand moved soundlessly. In turn, Harry made more of an effort to regulate his own heavy breathing. Despite his efforts not to draw attention to himself, he was only able to move the wand a foot before one of the guards noticed the minute movement out of the corner of his eye. Harry held his breath as the man picked up the wand. Harry shakily let it out once he realized that the man didn’t even look at Harry with suspicion. The movement had been so slow that while it caught the guard’s attention, the man had not consciously realized it had been moving.
I survive, I’ll come back for it... but if I don’t... if I don’t, you can still...” and Harry found he couldn’t say it.
“Meals seem to be about the only creature comfort they consistently provide,” Malfoy stated. He placed his now empty food tray in the slot where it had entered and then tapped the bar directly above it. It vanished.
Harry expected Draco to tell Zabini to fuck off, but after a slight pause, Draco shrugged and said, “why not.” Harry had time to mentally scream ‘oh my god, oh my god, oh my god’ before he was enveloped by Draco. Harry’s hands rose automatically, but unlike his hug with Crabbe, his arms rested against Draco’s back rather than pat him. Harry was shorter than Draco, and it left his eyes aligned closer to Draco’s shoulder. Harry used to resent their difference in height, but now that he was so close to him, Harry understood there could be some pleasant benefits. Under different circumstances it would easy for Harry to tuck himself just under Draco’s chin and burrow into his warmth. Nevertheless, Harry found that even standing chest to chest he was able to take in Draco’s scent. Harry tried not to obviously breath in that delicious aroma that was a pleasant mix of – no doubt expensive – hygiene and beauty products. Harry was no expert in hugs, but this had to be high up on the ‘best hug ever’ list, surely.
Harry had double transfiguration with McGonagall first. During the practical portion of her lesson, she spoke to Harry about catching up on the work he’d missed.
“Entitled little shit,” Burke hissed then backhanded Harry across the face. Harry cried out in shock. While he was dazed, Burke grabbed his other hand and similarly trapped it between their bodies.
Harry passed Nott the outline he and Hermione had started. Nott looked it over carefully. He offered only a couple of suggestions, but even Hermione agreed they should be added so Ron didn’t accuse their classmate of sabotaging them. Nott asked a few questions about some of the points, and it dawned on Harry he was trying to ask about his dad without being direct. Hermione’s suspicion softened once she realized it too.
“I don’t know,” Harry said as he tried to recall what Riddle had told him in the chamber. Lestrange asked a few other questions about Riddle’s abilities. Unfortunately, Harry couldn’t tell them much. He hadn’t asked Ginny too many questions as he worried it was too painful for her to relive. He regretted that now. He shared what he had felt when writing in the diary and when he was pulled into a memory by the horcrux. It wasn’t much information, but it gave Lestrange a few things to mull over as he considered the theory behind how horcruxes work.
“Not Dumbledore, your blithering idiot,” said Lucius. “The dark lord has staked his claim on the boy.”
“What hap – sweet Morgana!” one guard exclaimed as he looked into Harry’s cell. The light from the lumos he’d cast illuminated the awful scene. The man’s eyes were focused on Burke’s bare arse.
Harry nodded. “I will. I’ll do better. With James, and any other children we have. If you still want them, that is.”
“Was it for... you know,” asked Hermione. She could not outright ask if it was related to Voldemort because of the crowded room. She frowned when she spotted Romilda Vane nearby, obviously listening in. Hermione cast a privacy spell with a glare.
“Surely there must be some consequences,” Harry said as he fretted over how long the guards were likely to leave Albert in pain. It was becoming increasingly clear that the prisoners couldn’t do much, but surely their judicial-wizards could step in. “Perhaps Mr. Hale could do something?” he asked.
Harry didn’t know what expression he was making, but he was sure it wasn’t flattering. He was uncomfortable and embarrassed, but that was probably what Hale was aiming for. After a few shots of Harry’s tattoo, he asked to see Harry’s hand. He took a few pictures of the scar. Normally Azkaban’s low lighting would have made the scar hard to see, but Hale had brought his own light. As the man was not allowed to bring in his wand, he brought in an orb that glowed. It looked a little like a lightbulb.
“He claimed he was already working as your judicial representative. However, I was able to prove that he never even attempted to visit you, so there was no proof you consented to his representation,” Hale answered. Harry flinched. It hurt to hear that Dumbledore didn’t try to see him. It pained him that the headmaster didn’t trust him to speak for himself like he was doing now with Hale. Harry hadn’t exactly helped himself when the aurors showed up to arrest him, but he would have worked with Dumbledore if the man had shared his plan to get Harry released. What hurt even more was the knowledge that Dumbledore hadn’t tried to see him just to make sure he was OK.
It surprised Harry how much he missed the other prisoners. Harry had constantly engaged with them during his entire stay in Azkaban. They didn’t just teach him spells; they built up his confidence in himself. Plus, they just
As Burke opened the door labelled ‘Block D’, Perkins spoke for the first time since entering the prison section. “Surely, Mr. Potter isn’t a high-risk prisoner!” he objected.
“You don’t have to keep the ring,” he offered because he trusted that she’d protect it, but he had no right to ask it of her.
With shaking fingers Harry undid his Gryffindor cloak and placed it on Anton’s desk. He was glad that the clothes he was wearing underneath were not his most embarrassing set of Dudley cast offs. The shirt was fairly old so it was pretty faded but Harry liked it because it was one of the few that almost fit him properly. The jeans were atrocious but hardly the worst pair he had. It could be worse and more embarrassing. Harry pulled off his shirt and immediately noticed how much cooler it was. He picked up the Azkaban shirt and quickly slipped it on. It was not comfortable but the material wasn’t itchy or anything. It was pretty thin so Harry still felt cold.
The sound of someone clearing their throat had Harry glancing behind him. He saw Ron and Hermione hovering awkwardly behind him.
“No,” Harry protested. Given their new position, it was easier for him to free his arms now. He slapped Burke’s hand away from his chest, and then tried to push the man off him. Burke barely moved a few inches before diving back down. However, Harry was determined to fight now that his arms were free. He resisted when Burke tried to recapture them. He kept slapping them against Burke’s chest and face while repeating “get off, get off, get off.”
His friends temporarily distracted Harry from his fantasies, but they returned full force once everyone retired for the night. Harry found that he didn’t mind his insomnia so much when he had pleasant thoughts to occupy his mind. Harry’s thoughts especially lingered on that brief hug.
“You really think Harry is going to want to go beyond handjobs if he’s constantly reminded that his boyfriend’s dad taught him the sex spells he’s using?” asked Mulciber.
After cross referencing a theory in several books, Harry thought of another approach he could try. He wasn’t overly confident, but didn’t want to wait a couple of hours so he could run it by Theo. Harry checked the time to ensure the guards weren’t likely to be patrolling their block, crossed his fingers, and tried yet another spell.
Harry saw that several heads nodded in agreement, but several wizengamot members stubbornly pressed on with questions aimed to highlight Harry’s guilt. Hale, equally stubborn, jumped in each time before Harry was forced to answer. Hale appeared to relish in the opportunity to chastise each person. Harry barely managed to keep a straight face as Hale snidely said “since Mr. Tetley seems to have forgotten his memory potion this morning, let me remind you...”, “Mr. Runecraft seems to be confused about how the judicial process works,” and “Madame Ito, perhaps you could consult the court transcripts if you weren’t paying attention the first time.” It became obvious to tell which wizengamot members wanted Harry to return to Azkaban as they were increasingly frustrated. The rest of the audience appeared amused by Hale’s comments.
“Harry Potter,” Perkins said, answering the first question. He didn’t answer he second though Harry supposed there wasn’t much need to since they now knew who he is.
“What did they do?” Malfoy asked, keeping his voice low and coaxing. To Harry’s horror, he felt tears welled up in his eyes.
“They sure are restless today,” the captain said. The other passengers on the boat nervously observed the growing number of dementors that came out to watch them. More than one patronus circled them, so none of the dementors could get too close. Harry was sure that Asherath was the one hovering at the forefront of the group. With everyone’s attention off of him, Harry decided to risk giving Asherath a small goodbye wave. As much as he’d grown to like the dementor, he hoped he wouldn’t see him again anytime soon.
“I knew a bit,” Harry said and felt his face flush. From the raised brows on Parkinson’s face, and the smirk on Zabini’s, Harry was certain they were on to him. He dreaded the taunts they’d inevitably throw his way.
“And maybe one at a time,” Theo added. “I mean, there are things I know I’d rather not say in front of everyone.”
And that was exactly how he spent his Sunday. At first neither Ron nor Hermione paid much attention to what he was reading, but Hermione was too observant not notice Harry had been reading up on something they were not covering in their classes. He’d claimed he was merely curious. Hermione did not push him, but she kept eyeballing the textbooks. Harry knew she’d eventually figure out his main interest. It wasn’t that hard since he was looking up how to connect two objects, and several ways to use reflective surfaces for more than primping. He didn’t know what reasoning she’d assume he had, but Harry felt safe that she wouldn’t jump to the conclusion he was trying to contact Lucius.
With nothing else to occupy his mind, Harry kept recalling how gleeful Burke had been when he’d had Harry bound and at his mercy. Harry’s hope that Reginald Hale was reigning in the guards was diminishing the longer Albert was gone. Some guards may have been more cautious, but he doubted they would try very hard to stop Burke. Without restraint, Burke would keep coming at them. Harry broke out into a cold sweat as he imagined how much worse it could get. Harry was genuinely worried for Albert, but he knew that whatever Burke was doing to the other man would only be a warmup for what he had planned for Harry.
“I thought those robes looked familiar... you know, I didn’t really believe you and Andromeda when you said Malfoy had grown up... but maybe he isn’t as much of a prat after all...” Hermione decided. She didn’t like the idea of Harry feeling like he couldn’t come to her, but she was intelligent enough to recognize she was too close to it. Ron even more so. She’d been glad that he struck up a friendship with Andromeda, though she’d been uneasy when that friendship began to include the Malfoys. Until last night, Hermione had her doubts about Malfoy. She would never be his biggest fan, but was mature enough to recognize he helped improve Harry’s overall wellbeing.
“What for?” asked Harry. He knew it was because Nott was sticking up for him. Harry didn’t think Nott deserve Burke’s pettiness. He tried to bring Burke’s focus back on him even if it made Harry’s stomach queasy to do so.
“Charms, transfiguration,” Harry said. “They tried to cover the Hogwarts curriculum that I was missing by being there. They might have been completely off base, but I still learned loads of useful spells.”
“No,” Harry said. “Dolph just isn’t shy about his feelings for his wife. And Mulciber helped him write the raunchy one.”
Harry frowned as he processed the offer. Perhaps Nott thought Harry had picked up a harmless side project and offered his help as a way to extend their mutual tutoring. It was tempting to pretend that was the case so he could get Nott’s help, but that excuse would not hold up once it became clear they were only working with one mirror present.
Harry was given the choice to go back, or to wait at the station until the rest of his soul joined him. Harry didn’t hesitate at the opportunity to go back. Afterall he had a job to finish, and then he needed to figure out how to undo his own horcrux. Seeing Voldemort’s horcrux was enough to convince him to try to fix his own mangled soul. Even if it wasn’t possible, he needed to make sure his soul was untethered, so he didn’t have to wait at the train station indefinitely the next time he died.
Harry left the meeting feeling a lot lighter. As with all good things in Azkaban, it didn’t last long. When they passed the room where Harry was forced to get his prison tattoo, he noticed that a couple of guards where there with Albert. His fellow prisoner looked confused. Harry recalled the warning about guards tampering with prisoners’ memories so that they couldn’t share the atrocities they suffered with under their care. He was considerably happier that he gave Hale his memory. When the other man realized that Albert was unable to relay what Harry had witnessed, he would realize Albert’s memories had been tampered with. Harry was confident the judicial-wizard would use it as another nail in the ministry’s coffin.
“What is he going to do?” asked Harry. He was feeling worried and guilty. Burke was only going after Albert because the flower. Albert had only sent it to Burke to make Harry feel better.
He doesn’t remember consciously choosing his mother’s ring as the vessel for his soul, but when it’s over the ring was what rested in the palm of his bloody hand. He immediately regretted sullying anything of his mother’s, but later reflected that he’d rather use something of sentimental value than a random rock he’d grabbed.
“What if they step into the cell?” asked Lestrange. It took Albert and Avery a moment to adjust the plan, but they eventually declared they’d tie the wards to blood magic. Only the prisoner keyed into the ward would feel the additional warmth.
“You’ll want to watch it, Potter,” warned Burke. “You might think you’re the big man just because you’re friends with the minister, but while you’re in here, you’re mine.”
, he will tell James he loves him with no hesitation or self-doubt muddying up the words. And perhaps, eventually, he could even say it to himself.
The only downside to these days were the increased visits from the dementors. Two dementors were constantly popping by to visit Harry and ask questions. One dementor introduced himself. To Harry, his name sounded like Ash-er-rath. He was the first dementor Harry had met in Azkaban. He introduced his mate as Ish-an-ders. Their interest still made Harry nervous, but he was keenly aware of Crabbe’s pitiful whimpers next door, so he willingly answered their questions. The questions seemed random and Harry couldn’t figure out why they would want to know things like his favourite colour or food. It was obvious they weren’t asking just to get to know Harry, but he couldn’t tell how knowing Harry had a weakness for treacle tart would provide any insight into whatever was going on. They had yet to explain to Harry why they found him so interesting.
“I didn’t need Dumbledore to point this out. I’ve seen it for myself. I’ve lived it,” Harry said tiredly. “Look, if you want people to believe you’re doing something, maybe you should actually
“I consent,” Harry said. Hale nodded and placed the quill above the notepad. He began asking Harry questions, and Harry answered them as he had practiced with his mentors. The answers might have been rehearsed but the sentiments were real. Harry wanted to speak out against the ministry, especially Umbridge. Lucius and Albert simply helped ensure he would do so elegantly.
Harry was rinsing the surprisingly odorless suds from him hair, when he heard a “Potter” spoken behind him.
“If there is anything I can do,” Dumbledore offered. Once again, Harry felt Dumbledore’s full attention on him. He made sure to avoid the avoid eye contact as the man assessed him.
There were some benefits to a home meal. Draco was able to set up Harry’s dining room with several romantic touches. He liberally decorated with Gryffindor red, though the only acknowledgement he made of it was to tell Harry red was the colour of love. An intricate centerpiece made with lilies took prominence on the table, though Draco made sure it was low enough that they could still make eye contact. Rose petals led from the table to Harry’s bedroom in case the night ended enjoyably.
“Expecto patronum!” a voice yelled. A second later a translucent wildcat chased Asherath away. A wounded noise escaped Harry as the dementor was forced away before Harry could ask how he could remove the unpleasant feelings. He didn’t feel any better when it was Wiblin that quickly approached his cell.
“Well Burke and some other guards took him out of his cell and returned him bruised all over. Since no one can visit Azkaban, it leaves the guards as the only possible-” Harry said angrily.
“Perhaps you better explain what happened exactly,” Malfoy answered calmly. Harry looked between him and Nott but both were wearing serious expressions and seemed to want an explanation.
He made no progress researching in the library that night, though he found it encouraging that Ron seemed less tense around Nott. Whatever happened during their chess game was enough for Ron to not only tolerate having the Slytherin at their table, but actually greet him when he sat down. Harry wouldn’t go so far as to call them friends, though they were at least friendly.
“It sounded interesting enough, that I now regret not taking it in third year,” Harry said. Of course, Trelawney had made him regret that decision in every class, long before he started learning about runes.
“Er, I don’t think the ministry is ready for muggle thoughts on law and psychology,” Harry said honestly. “But Hale says that if you want it, you have a job with his firm when you graduate.”
Slowly the common room emptied out as students retired for the night. Hermione was the last to leave him. Harry told her he wanted to finish at least one more assignment before going to bed. Knowing exactly how many Harry had, she didn’t argue but asked that he go to sleep soon with a worried look on her face.
Once the others asked all the less personal questions they had about Azkaban, the conversation turned back to what was happening in Hogwarts. Since Ron, Hermione and Neville had updated him about the reporters already, the others mostly told him the standard school gossip. Harry wasn’t all that interested in who started dating who, beyond the relief he felt knowing Draco hadn’t started seeing anyone in his absence.
“What did they do?” asked Hale when Harry stalled for too long. Harry glanced nervously at Hale, but the man did not seem upset that Harry was saying something they hadn’t previously discussed. He hoped Hale saw where Harry was going, and knew Harry had the best intentions for Albert. But that didn't make it any easier for Harry to actually say it.
“Is that so? Well, it’s a pity he won’t get the chance to ever learn them,” said Burke nastily. “Potter won’t be leaving any time soon.”
“What? How?” Lucius muttered in a confused manner. Harry’s view suddenly went wonky as Lucius started moving around. “Are you seeing this?” came Lucius’ voice, but it was Albert’s face in the mirror this time.
“Then you’ve picked the wrong career, haven’t you?” pointed out Harry. Malfoy made another choking/snorting noise and Burke narrowed his eyes.
“I feel like a prat,” Harry complained as he brought the food to his mouth and tried to chew “delicately”.
“While this... situation is terrible, the ministry cannot condone violence against muggles,” a wizard stated.
Nott managed to win over Ginny a lot easier than Ron. It probably helped that Ginny didn’t have the same history with the sixth year Slytherins boys. As he made both girls laugh several times, Harry found himself re-evaluating his impression of Nott. The other boy had always seemed quiet and a bit of a loner. He was reserved in the same way his father was, but Harry used to think Theo wasn’t as confident as Albert. It was surprising to see how charming he could be if he wanted. Theo was likely only alone most of the time because he wanted to be.
“You’re young. James is your first child, and you never had younger siblings to care for. You’re doing it mostly on your own, which would be stressful for anyone even before you factor in whatever misplaced guilt you feel about Ginny’s death,” Draco listed. Harry mentally reminded himself it wasn’t misplaced guilt, but didn’t interrupt Draco. He wanted to know how his and James’ relationship looked like from an outside perspective. “All his basic needs are taken care of. He’s not starved for attention or physical comfort...”
He didn’t know how much time he wasted idle in bed, but eventually he forced himself to get up. He needed a distraction from his own dark thoughts and unfortunately his failure to sleep only added to the negativity swirling in his mind. In Azkaban he’d used magic and made trinkets as a distraction. If sleep wouldn’t give him the escape he craved, perhaps magic would. At the least, he knew he’d feel better if he managed to do something productive.
The other students were still in class when Harry left the office, so he was able to make his way to Gryffindor tower unhindered. Harry practically ran to his bed and flopped on it with a small sigh. He took several minutes to just snuggle with his pillow and bask in the feeling of a comfortable bed.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked, somewhat hysterically. He was not reassured when Burke merely smirked at him and charmed his shirt to remain in place.
“Me too,” said Regina with pride. Even though Hale was focused on Hermione, he must have heard her because he put an arm around his daughter and drew her closer at the declaration.
“OK. If the professors don’t let me go to the village, I can just meet you here,” Harry said and gestured to the gate.
His fellow prisoners did not know how to reassure Harry. Lestrange did not mention that what little he knew about horcruxes was not good. Removing the soul from its vessel typically caused irreparable damage to said vessel. There was a chance that the vessel would be unharmed if the soul was removed without using the ritual to return the one that had died. Unfortunately, Lestrange did not remember reading about that, nor if it was even possible to transfer the soul to another vessel. The fact that Harry was a vessel with his own soul would certainly complicate matters further.
“Albus, we will also need to question Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Ronald Weasley, and Ginevra Weasley about their involvement in the ministry break-in,” Runecraft stated clearly.
“Initiate roundup. Burke kissed. Potter... attacked,” the man said and his patronus ran off to deliver the message to his fellow guards.
“I suppose,” Harry said as he came to terms with the idea that he would keep going even if it cost Burke’s soul. The moral thing would be to stop... but it wasn’t like Burke had stopped when Harry asked him to. Harry reasoned that it wasn’t fair that he should have to carry around Burke’s soul at the expense of his magic. Burke didn’t deserve that consideration after what he did to Harry. Harry decided that he would keep using magic, even if it ultimately used up Burke’s soul. It was terrible, but it wasn’t like Harry would keep eating souls. Harry just had to hold on until he felt like himself again.
“Thank you, Harry,” Albert said with sincerity. Harry nodded and slowly dimmed the light in Albert’s cell so everyone wouldn’t get another shock.
“You should create illusions for your own injuries,” suggested Lucius. Maintaining that many illusions on both of them would normally strain a wizard’s magic. For once, Harry though that might be a good thing if it helped lessen the negative feelings that having Burke’s soul in him caused.
The sound of Dean getting up pulled Harry out of his downward spiral. He closed his eyes and pretended to sleep in case Dean happened to look his way. A short time later he heard Neville get up as well. He waited until his friend left before opening his eyes. Harry figured it was safe to ‘wake up’ now without anyone questioning his sleeping habits.
“Oh, God. That really happened? I thought I just dreamt it,” Harry said, horrified to realize he really had told Draco about the worst thing he’d ever done. Draco gave Harry a moment to absorb the new state of things.
Harry had just finished performing the blood magic needed to make the mirror permanent when the door at the end of the hallway opened. The prisoners began whimpering as their dreams turned into nightmares. Harry braced himself for seeing a dementor for the first time since the incident. He hoped he’d finally get some answers.
Eventually an imposing shape started to form in the fog. By the time Harry could clearly make out Azkaban, he thought he would sick up over the side of the boat. He wondered if this was how Sirius had felt when he was first brought here.
As Lucius and Nott were the only prisoners he’d seen during the last few days, Harry felt the most comfortable around them – even naked. He couldn’t help but observe that both men still looked relatively healthy. Lucius wasn’t sporting a six-pack, but his chest was surprisingly toned. Harry tried not to dwell on it as it felt icky to notice that about Draco’s father. Though Harry couldn’t help but wonder if Draco was similarly built.
“Perhaps we ought to go before the dementors get antsy,” suggested a third man who had been standing in the back. At the mention of dementors, the others started shifting.
Harry’s testimony was hindered by not knowing who each Death Eater was. Hale described their masks, but a good chunk of that night happened so fast that Harry couldn’t be sure which Death Eater had said or done something in particular. He was able to confirm a couple of events that Albert had described, but Hale didn’t look as pleased as he’d been when Harry confidently spoke about Lucius.
“It’s not the first time the guards have done something like this. They’ll use any convenient excuse whenever they want to scratch that itch. It wouldn’t have mattered what any of us did or didn’t do,” Lucius said as he took over explaining.
Ron still wasn’t eager to have Nott join them. Sensing this, Nott asked Ron if he wanted to go play a game of chess once they’d both finished their homework. Harry didn’t know if it was the opportunity to get away, or the fact that Nott suggested his favourite game, but Ron agreed without making a fuss and implying Nott was up to something nefarious.
The man was a decent singer, but his gyrating as he soaped up his body made the scene as indecent as it was absurd. When Harry caught the man’s eye, Mulciber winked at him and continued to serenade the prisoners. The more they complained and demanded he shut up, the bigger the spectacle he caused. It drew all eyes away from Harry. His heart filled with gratitude and Harry made a mental note to conjure the man another bottle of lube.
Harry stood frozen there for a long time, only snapping out of it at the sound of a stomach gurgle. After one last glance at the room, he turned and made his way to the kitchen.
“There you go, Potter. One nice little souvenir,” Burke smirked at him. Harry was tempted to spit in his face, but bit back the impulse. Who knew what else the man would draw on him as revenge. Wiblin moved back towards the cabinet and returned with another potion bottle. Burked poured some on a new piece of cloth and pressed it to Harry’s neck. Harry hissed at the newest sensation of pain.
Draco grabbed the stunned guy and pulled him into the nearest room, which happened to be an empty study room.
“Their names are Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, if you follow the international hero news, you might’ve heard their names before,” he says.
Draco sighed and got up- tossing Harry the apple, telling him to eat it. He ignored the whines he got in protest. Trying to get Harry to eat real food was such a hassle.
Harry’s mouth popped off his hard-on with an audible Schlick-. He started to rub Draco’s length in full with his hands. His tongue played with the tip, his tongue ring sinking into the slit unforgivingly. Draco moaned at the abusive effect the cold metal had on his most sensitive part.
“ I don’t care, go ahead and introduce yourselves. We’re already wasting class time,” Aizawa said apathetically.
She grabbed fist fulls of his hair and pressed harder against his face. She rode out her climax with a few more thrusts against him-slightly abusing his open mouth.
Midoriya watched as Draco and Harry split ways. He lost Harry in the debris and saw Draco stealthily make his way to some high ground.
“ Mmm Good! I like! Nice Golden Trio~” Harry says. Draco snickers at the name he gave the three students. They did seem like genuinely good kids, if not a little goody-two-shoes.
The rest of class Midoriya pondered if he should tell someone about the new information Draco told him about Harry.
“ I guess we’ll see how tomorrow’s training goes. Honestly, I’m a little scared that I might have to fight against Draco…” He continues. The other two nodded in agreement. The look in Draco’s eyes had shone with a villainess gleam.
The next day Momo finds herself listless during a morning free period. She kept thinking about the shared lunch yesterday and their talk about the possible relationship between Harry and Draco.
She acknowledged that it might be a little weird but she honestly wanted to gain each of their trust and if feeding a cute boy was the way to do it then she would do her best.
The difference between the two transfers could cause whiplash. One was happy and giddy while the other was cold and bitter.
Draco couldn’t teleport down and take his flag yet, Todoroki still had his guard up and he’d likely be roasted alive before he could grab him.
Soon Iida returned with some sides and drinks. The main meal was a simple hotpot with noodles and beef- and sides of rice and fried dumplings.
“ No, Mr. Black just move the car. Besides I’m sure you’ll be far too busy with your...problem children to entertain me,” Aizawa says walking away.
She pulled out her collapsible baton and got into a defensive position. Over the years she had become pretty skilled with the defensive weapon and felt capable to fight without overusing her quirk.
Draco grabbed Harry’s pink headphones and his phone, before leaving the dorm. He didn’t bother with bringing stuff like pencils or paper. It’s not like they were going to take notes anyway.
“ Ya considering we’ve been in the same class since Highschool, some new faces would be nice,” Tsu says.
“ If you meant they run from the smell then ya. That mutt form of his could make a small country flee from smell alone, not to mention the fleas,” Draco says, making the group laugh.
The next morning Draco woke up to the pleasant surprise of his dick being sucked off by a very awake Harry.
“ Well we’ll give you something to write about, not many people have watched us work together since most of our hero work is underground stuff,” Draco says.
“ I know what you mean. On the outside, they seem careless and sloppy but on the inside, they are strategic and fast. I expected them to rush into the fight head-on but instead, they had a plan,” Midoriya responds.
‘Handler? It makes it sound like they are wild dogs that need to be corralled,’ some of the students thought.
Some of the girls grumble at the notion but agree to not bother the boys about possible Homerotic relationships and the possibility of them being added in.
It had felt like a deeper bite, but his hormone quirk must overstimulate the senses, making things feel more than it really is.
“ Uh thanks, it looks good, thank you for inviting us…” Draco awkwardly says trying to be nice. It was a little stiff- but you could tell he was trying.
Midoriya started to worry about how they could ever work with someone so cold and untrusting. Most of the classwork was focused on teamwork, he couldn’t see Draco working well with anyone. After lunch they were put into free choice periods, basically any class they thought they need extra work in. The college program classes were a lot laxer than high school had been.
Harry came up for air and pulled her hips down closer- making her arch ever so slightly off the bed.
At first, Momo was confused that he had pulled her back down, but it seemed like he wanted to brush her hair.
“ Wow I didn’t take Draco as the kind, caring type- but he’s actually a big softy! That’s so cute!” Uraraka gushed.
“ Stop. They may have their licenses already but they were sent here by their government to learn. From what I was told, they’re a little immature and their agency wants them to come down to earth some more,” Aizawa tells them.
At last, he grabbed her thigh and pushed it back, putting her knee closer to her chest- changing the angle to go deeper inside.
Yes, the teachers were moved up to the college courses with them. The board thought it would disrupt learning too much if they had to change teachers drastically.
He tongued her hole in a shallow rhythm, before taking time to plunge it further in and explore moist walls.
“ We should try to introduce ourselves again, only this time just the three of us. Maybe he will feel more comfortable with us if we try to explain ourselves more.
“ Like certifiable crazy. If you want to get technical he has Hypersexuality compulsive disorder that stems from childhood trauma. Basically, he has repeating sexual compulsive thoughts that run rampant in his mind, until he can’t form complete thoughts and goes into a psychotic state.
Draco surprisingly laughed. It was higher pitched than his regular voice, but still smooth and melodic.
“ No don’t tell us about the boring stuff, we want to know about the juicy details-” Hagakure eggs on.
He continued to torture both buds with his mouth until they were bright red and hard to the touch. He returned to mouth for a quick but fiery kiss.
From the girl’s loud moans she seemed to be enjoying herself too much to notice Midoriya watching. The guy turned his head and smiled at Midoriya.
“Vengeful little fucker,” snorted Mulciber amused. He sobered quickly as he recalled exactly who Harry had been stabbing.
“Mum sets a pretty high precedent,” Draco joked. Harry didn’t quite relent, but he allowed himself to relax in Draco’s hold.
“What about the one in you?” Draco asked, worried what effects the horcrux attached to Harry for years might have done to him.
“ Morning, I see you’ve seen our costumes. We try not to be as flashy as possible since most of our work is underground and at nighttime. Can’t sneak up on somebody while wearing bright pink,” Draco said, winking at Uraraka who blushed red at the comment on her outfit.
“ Good Morning fellow classmates, glad to have you join us for training this morning,” Iida greets them with his class rep mannerisms.
The students of 1-A started to think that Sirius and Aizawa were twins separated at birth, but Aizawa ended up being the evil twin.
“ Whatever it is Harry and I will do well. We’ve been working as partners for years now and have never lost to a villain,” Draco says patting Harry on the head.
“ It seems that Mr. Aizawa is telling Draco that he cannot park his car there. Draco is calling him some choice words. Some seem to be in English and Japanese,” Shoji says.
“ Oh? And what did your previous school do for training exercises?” Iida asks, slightly offended at the jab at UA.
She heard more steps surrounding her. The person was moving too fast and kept spinning in tight circles, her guard up, expecting an attack from the back.
The trio left to eat with Harry and Draco, as they had promised to start introducing new people slowly.
With that, the two exchange students thank them for the dinner and leave the room. Harry gives Uraraka a parting hug, and calls her by a shortened nickname, “Raka”.
She moaned at the friction it created. Harry took advantage of her open mouth moan and slid his tongue into it. Their tongues fought for dominance before she complied and let him explore her mouth with his tongue. The piercing was rough against her tongue and the coolness of the metal made her shiver.
Tsu blushes. “ The teacher put Harry and me together for a project about the ethical punishment of villains by Japan’s government-” Tsu says but gets cut off by Hagakure.
“ Um Mr. Aizawa, it says that they’re 20. Shouldn’t they be in the next year’s class with Mirio and Tamaki?” Iida asks, after doing his own research on the new students.
The students spectating couldn’t tell what they were but if they were closer they would see quarter-sized marbles.
Before Todoroki could rush him to get Draco’s flag, Aizawa blew a whistle- signaling the end of the match.
Momo groaned loudly and pressed against the door- as it was the only thing holding her up- when Harry started to suck at a sensitive spot on her collarbone.
The battle took place on their small obstacle course of toppled over buildings and crumbled streets. The class spectated the battles from bleachers beside it, careful to avoid flying debris when people like Bagugo were in the ring.
“ If you two have been such successful pro-heroes for the past three years, then why did your agency send you across the world to a college hero course? You obviously aren’t here on your own accord,” Iida asks pointedly. It was what all of them were wondering. Midoriya had read about them and how popular they were on the European circuit.
A surprising match-up was Todoroki and Momo. Their quirks and fighting style didn’t match up very well, since Todoroki was a distance fighter and Momo worked well as support.
“ Well if they are, then I hope it's an open relationship because DAMN. After seeing the training today- I would give anything to have been in Momo’s position,” Mina declares.
“ Hey, I thought you liked boys Jirou?” Kirishima interjected from across the room. Jirou rolled her eyes at him.
“ That’s right! Wow, aren’t you guys so cute. Anyway, my quirk is that I can control shadows and turn into a big black dog. I usually work at night since that’s when it’s darkest,” Sirius said.
“ Word of advice Princess, use colored concealers to cover up those marks. Looks like he did quite the number on you, eh?” Draco half flirted, half taunted the stunned girl.
Instead of just taking the flag from her belt loop as she expected, Harry also reached and undid her mask.
Harry seemed more interested in Uraraka who was explained an Ube flavored mochi she had brought with her as dessert.
“ Hi Uraraka, Iida brought this to share tonight, he handed me this and ran off to get the rest,” he said. The two of them set up the small room for dinner, with the food spread out buffet-style on a table for them to sit around in a more traditional setting.
Not much later the matches start. They were long since everyone can almost predict each other’s moves. That’s why it was harder for each pair to win since they have to surprise both members of the opposite team to retrieve the flags.
It shows the two boys together. One with black hair is smiling and the one blonde next to him is glaring.
Draco quickly got dressed in a white button-up shirt and black slacks that seemed to be the dress code for the school. He left the top four buttons undone that showed off a couple of metal chains he wore around his neck. He dressed Harry in the same white button-up shirt and black slacks. In addition, he put a pink sweater over the button-up shirt. He didn’t even bother fighting with him about putting on shoes, since Harry hated wearing shoes.
A few more thrusts rode out both of their climaxes before Harry pulled out of her with a squelching sound.
“ Look. There was an incident that I rather not repeat but it made the agency think that we were disconnected from society and that it would make citizens question if we were good heroes or not. SO they shipped us off across the world to get more grounded or whatever,” Draco says, scowling at the ground.
Hagakure humphs. “ Easy for you to say Jirou, you’re not even interested in men, this wouldn’t even affect you.”
Midoriya decided to go sit in Present Mic’s English lecture since he needed some help on an upcoming essay. Once he entered the classroom, he saw Harry. Intrigued to see how he acted during class, Midoriya sat near him.
They promise and they move from the cafeteria to the dorm’s main area. Uraraka had texted Midoriya and Iida to let them know the change of plans since they couldn’t all fit in the small study room.
Midoriya stays up a little later in his dorm room, finishing up an essay. He yawns and looks at the clock. It was a little past midnight. He figured since he’d be up for a little bit he might as well do laundry. He gathered some dirty clothes and made it to the communal laundry room, which should be pretty empty since everyone did their laundry in the day.
“ Hey everyone settle down and take your seats,” Aizawa said, standing at the front of the class. The older students obeyed the command.
“ He's rude and cold behavior is starting to make more sense now. He is only protective of his disabled friend and wary of those who might treat him differently,” Iida said.
Momo thought about his short question. Oh, he must be asking if she was sure she wanted him to activate his quirk. Yes, she was sure. It’s all she’s wanted for the past two days.
“ I’m Midoriya Izuku, you can call me Midoriya since everyone does. My quirk is basically the ability to stockpile energy and release it for a speed boost or to different limbs for extra strength,” he explains.
Eyes flickering towards the door of the Minister's office, the redhead coughed, "I was … ahm … at home. Sick, you understand."
Schooling his expression, Kingsley looked at the young Auror, "Mr Longbottom, can you tell me where the sun will rise?"
Conscious of the second line of attack the three wizards that remained, grouped together, and started a chant. No matter how much the two Aurors attacked them, their spells were diverted by an invisible force. It took the group of wizards barely twenty seconds to complete their ritual and their eyes were glowing an unnatural, electric blue when the leader turned towards them one last time, snarling, "You might have stopped us, but our legend will live on. By the power of Hecate, may we enter the afterlife by her eternal grace."
Since he saw no other way, Draco did as told. His cheek was still throbbing. When he emerged half an hour later, she merely pointed at the floor. Circling him after he had sunken to his knees, she touched his bare back and his damp hair. "You have not dried yourself properly and neglected to use body-oil. Your hair is still damp and not properly styled. The make-up, however, is acceptable. Use the blue-grey charcoal pen next time. I think it will compliment your beautiful eyes even better. Now rise and put your hands at your nape."
"Nope," Harry grinned, before he sobered. "The point is, you have your room and a bathroom for yourself. You know the majority of my wards, since you were in the Order. There is even a potions lab around, and I am sure Draco would share with you. But if you want your own, we can figure something out. Just, please, give yourself some time to get better. And when you are on your feet again, you can decide how you want to play this."
"Apparently so," the Potion Master mumbled, before lifting one leg after the other into the tub. In obvious disdain, he looked at the mountains of rainbow-coloured bubbles that rose out of the water. Still, he reminded himself to be grateful, so he did not comment. Choosing the moment when Harry turned away to reach for some towels, Severus hastily pulled off his night-gown and slid into the water. He could not withhold a groan of pure bills when the hot water lapped at his skin. He had a hard time remembering when he had last taken a bath, but after a moment decided not to bother and to just enjoy the fragranced water. When Harry turned back around, Severus felt the impulse to cover himself but noticed that there was no need, since the bubbles preserved his dignity sufficiently. Clever boy.
Only when he nodded, did Narcissa pass the threshold and closed the door, leaving her worried family on the staircase.
The trio could see the effort of him not pulling back when Harry reached out and brushed over the tattoo. At a hiss from the parsel-mage, the snake reared its head, making Lucius whimper. Immediately, Harry wanted to know, "Is it hurting you?"
"How … do you … know?" Severus inquired, eyes flying over the notes. He had not realised how much he had missed his potions. Even this was a welcome, and most importantly interesting, reprieve from his thoughts, that constantly circled from Harry to Lucius to ways to speed up his own recovery, before returning to Lily's son.
"And that was a good thing too," James chuckled, lost in memories. "Because once she handed you over to Sirius, he did not let you go for a solid six hours."
"Do you see me smiling, Auror Jenkins? No? Then you might assume, that I won't waste your time or mine with ill attempts of humour," Alexander Pince replied drily, unemphatically gazing at his colleague.
“Exactly,” Harry replied calmly since no Auror present considered Lostrife to be innocent. They always did thorough research on their targets, since capturing innocents was generally frowned upon. Robarts, Neville and Harry knew that the bastard in the interrogation chamber to be guilty as sin. “We either get new evidence, or we gain proof that my vassal is lying to me. In that case, I have no issue whatsoever, to send him back to Azkaban. Together with his new friend, of course.”
"Oh, alright." Without further ado, Draco helped the raven to the fire and after handing him the floo-powder, left the room.
The young Auror reached out once again, knowing what Emilia Nightingale was capable of when defending a patient. There was a reason he trusted her with the life and well-being of Severus Snape after all. Yet, instead of growing angry, rising to the bait, she stated coldly, "And I am responsible for his care. So, if you don't want to add yourself to my list of patients Mr Malfoy, I suggest you do as I say!" And before either wizard even got the chance to contradict her, she had pointed her wand at them and evicted them from the room.
Harry sighed because the blond's bad conscience was palpable and after what had happened in the morning, he knew he ought to take his time for this. So, the Auror stepped back and leaned against the desk, folding his arms so he would not be tempted to pet Draco again. He was relieved to notice the blond relaxing at the gesture. "Listen, I get this whole 'servant'−position you put yourself in. It's infinitely better than being locked up at the Manor, starving. But let's be honest, you merely had a choice between a rock and a hard place."
Briefly looking at Harry, Narcissa indicated a bow. "Of course, Mr Manson, this way, please." She would have a lot of explaining to do once Lucius returned from the Ministry. Not only why she had given access to their precarious books, but also why their home was - once again - invaded by wizards from all corners of the Kingdom. Somehow, she imagined that her husband would share her bewilderment of how
The crowd around the bonfire was nothing the golden trio had ever seen. Thestrals nibbled on snacks, confusing some of the younger children who could not see them. A few pixies and fairies were taunting students with glamour and some weak form of allure until the professors put an end to it. A giant spider, that hovered just at the edge of the forest, scared most of the first and second-years back to their dormitories and around midnight, when the festivity started to wind down, a herd of unicorns emerged from the forest, sampling the remaining treats. They even allowed a selected few to pet them. A young one approached Hermione and nibbled on her cloak. Rubbing its mane over her stomach until it lost a few strands of hair before returning to its herd.
"What?" The man rasped flabbergast, prompting the young wizard to prepare a cup of tea with honey, as per Emilia's instructions. After his cautious first sip, he was not ready to be drugged by the sneaky, little elf again, Snape tilted his head in a reluctant grateful gesture, before he prompted the other wizard to explain.
"Sorry, Mr Fairchild," Harry apologised for the interruption, "But I really don't have time for this. You see …"
Harry’s face lit up when he reached for his robes. “Great. Ron wanted to show me a new fudge. Maybe I’ll catch him before they close.”
of October 1981, he came for me. You duelled him, dad, but … but he was stronger, and killed you." Harry swallowed through a constricting throat. "Then he came for me. On Severus request, Voldemort asked you to stand down, mum. Told you that you did not have to die since he only wanted me."
After an apparition to the pub and a stroll through Diagon Alley, they entered Gringotts and Harry stated, "I want to talk to my account manager."
Blinking rapidly, Bill watched Fleur pick up Dominique before he guided her and Victoire to his father's left side.
Taking in Malfoy’s defeated posture, Harry made one of his many ill-thought-through and reckless decisions, that would - once again - change the course of his entire life. “No,” he resolved, rose from the couch, and called out. “Kreacher, show Malfoy one of the guest-rooms on the second floor. He’ll stay with us for the near future, in service to the family.”
Surprised what his studious brother could offer, the dragon-tamer opened the tiny package. "Seeds?" He was no herbologist. This was as good as wasted on him.
"He does?" The Potion Master asked, only mildly surprised, while Chris Drake inquired curiously, "The 'Saviour's' home has a dungeon floor?"
Returning to the room, the young wizard hovered for a moment, clearly unsure of how to proceed. Swallowing his pride, Severus allowed himself a scathing remark, "This can hardly be the first time you have assisted me in the cleaning process." Not that this was a particularly comforting thought for Potter's spawn to have seen him naked … all of him, even the tattoo on his lower arm.
Still not having gained the slightest insight into the poison-extracting potion, the next day, let alone the antidote, Draco decided to end his work in the lab around teatime. When he joined Potter in his office, cucumber-sandwiches, biscuits and another pot of camomile tea - Emerald seriously needed to expand her selection of beverages - the blond shared a new plan. "I want to build a shack for Inari, the muggle way. We can always repurpose it later when Lovegood's cave has been put in place, but until then, I want her to have a retreat in the garden."
"Then why did she talk about fairies and gnomes instead of saying that it's about the composition of the earth?" Draco exploded.
"Ten seconds later than the last time you have asked. Honestly, Draco, you need to calm down. You are getting splotchy."
"Would he even have had a chance?" Harry inquired quietly. "I mean he was a half-blood, and quite poor on top of that. I admit that I do not know much about the inner workings of Slytherin, but it seems to me that a boy of his standing had it difficult either way."
"It's alright," the raven−haired chuckled, leading them to the back where a small pavilion was exempt from the anti−apparation wards. "I'm not any better now than I was at school. I only know that they need to be watered every two to three days depending if there was rain or not. Neville and Luna did this for me as a housewarming gift. They chose particularly resilient plants, herbs and leaves that ward against Nargles."
"Wow," Draco stated impressed. "You really caught up on herbology, Potter." After a second, he corrected himself hastily, "Harry, I mean. Sorry."
The pureblood smiled comfortingly and shook his head, “Even if Miss Granger-Weasley were half as good at her job as she is, she would still be able to gain a conviction. However, since she excels at everything she does, there is no way for Mister Lostrife to ever see the light of day again. You convicted me on half the evidence we have on him.”
She could not decipher the enigmatic look Draco and Severus traded until the later offered the tiniest smile, "She already has it."
"It's a reference to his fourth journal," the blond revealed. "On page 75, he discusses the temperature needed for brewing antidotes."
"And they were all there," his father stated matter−of−factly. Reaching for his wife, who placed her hand in his with a gentle smile, he turned towards Neville. "Anyway, Mr Longbottom, how may we be of service?"
"They are not my parents," Harry whispered, looking out of the dark windows. All he could see was his own, distorted reflection. He had to remind himself, again and again, lest he started projecting. "I wish they were, so much it actually hurts. But they aren't. They are reflections of what my parents had been. And though I love having them around, your and Draco's comfort is still more important, because unlike them, you are alive. If you don't want my dad to have access to your room, I get that. I won't mount a picture in my office either. At least not a magical painting."
Draco was rambling, even in his own head, he realised. Still, watching the moon travel over the night sky, through the third-floor window, the blond took his time to sort through everything he thought, felt and knew. He banished his petty jealousy to the back of his head, resolved to serve and support his new master to the best of his abilities. Not because he had promised, or because he owed it, but because it was the right thing to do. Potter had been through enough in the first eighteen years of his life. It was time that he had more people in his corner who supported
"On the contrary," the man admitted somewhat hoarsely. "The Dark Mark seemed to like another item of parselmagic so close."
When all three younger Aurors finally stood side by side at the table, Neville shrugged. "Still, doesn't make any sense," before stealing Charles' last biscuit.
"Don't worry, Lady Malfoy." Ginny put the hostess mind at ease. Holding up two brown paper−bags with a mermaid on one side. "George and I brought enough refreshments for all of us."
Harry, who had been brought up with the concept of praying together and that 'good people' attended church, was utterly confused. "What use is a religion you can't share with your family and friends? There is no unity."
As a result of his years of service to the Dark Lord, the white−haired man did not even startle at the harsh command, neatly setting the cup down. Only the slight trembling of his hands betrayed his distress when he tilted his head and stated, "Forgive me, my Lord."
"If," she repeated with forced calm, "that potion is in any way related to my husband's death, you may return and will receive your answer."
When the blond whipped around, the raven-haired saw his terror and pulled him even closer. "Did you offer yourself, your abilities, everything you can do and everything you are in exchange for me trying to save your father from the Kiss?"
But before the pureblood could make any promises Severus Snape had no intentions of letting him keep, the former spy cancelled his charm and had his wand directed at his former friend's back. Icily, he ordered, "Shut down the floo."
Kreacher was sitting at his desk-chair, frozen as if petrified. The elf was twitching anxiously, flittering from his master to the Lady Malfoy and back, whimpering under his breath.
"Two children," the young Lady injected, "Draco and I need to produce two heirs. After that, we are free to … be ourselves."
"Because…" Harry started, only to bite his lips at the last moment. Maybe it was better to keep certain things to himself. At least until twelve hours had passed.
Dazed, Lucius returned to Harry's office, where the raven-haired was still tidying up, while Draco was leaning against his desk, talking about his latest research. The boys had become comfortable, closer in a way that was hard to describe. Draco's father could not entirely understand their relationship. It had started out as a business transaction, solely to Potter's advantage. He had gained a pureblood vassal and a servant from an old family to do his bidding. And though Draco was still at the raven-haired's beck and call, Lucius felt like an honest friendship had developed between the two. During the first few weeks, he had been afraid of Harry taking advantage of his son, but these days he was not so sure anymore who benefited more from their arrangement.
"Alright," Pince took in the new inventory. "The book on anatomy is back where it belongs, but now a volume on early child's development is missing. Also, the latest update of 'The Cores that make us'. We should look into getting a copy for the Lady Malfoy."
The first time, Harry had been at Longbottom Manor, he had been baffled by the sheer size of it. Of course, he had known that Neville's family had been well off. But nothing about his friend had ever indicated the grandeur his family lived in. It might only be a fraction of Malfoy Manor, but every stone and drape and furniture was of outstanding quality, albeit old. Where the Malfoys had put their wealth and breeding on display, Neville had ignored his. Meeting Augusta Longbottom in person had been quiet … unsettling.
"I … so … well," shaking his head to clear it, the pureblood admitted. "Apparently, it's exactly how it looks." Gazing at his wife, he inquired cautiously, "You're not angry?"
"Yes, Mr Potter?" McGonagall looked up from her grading, still more comfortable to do it here than in the office. Surprised, she noticed her former pupil fidgeting, so she transfigured one of the desks into an armchair and invited, "Tea?"
Studying the wizard, who had already fought in and survived one war at the age of seventeen, Robarts nodded, "You have my word."
The next moment, all conversation ebbed away, as the Aurors turned towards the ebony-headed witch that had just entered. Her attentive brown eyes, seemed to lay all secrets bare, just by looking at a person. Though she wore blue jeans and a green shirt with a Greenpeace logo on it, nobody dared to even breathe, since she wore the robe of an Unspeakable on top of it all.
That someone started knocking on their door shortly after breakfast, was undoubtedly out of the ordinary. Especially with Narcissa still being under house−arrest and him being here and at Grimmauld Place in equal likelihood. His master merely gazed at him, "There is someone at the door," should have clued him in that something was going on.
Pondering the question, she shook her head. "No, you need to be around them. Otherwise, you can't help."
The pureblood nodded. He had watched Mrs Granger sort through her notes and the files at her office when she needed to think. Hence, it was of no surprise to him that she did something similar at home. Narcissa usually started to rearrange the colour-schemes of the house. Once, late in her pregnancy with Draco, the blue salon had turned a dark purple and the pink one beige. It had been a confusing month, but fortunately, his lovely wife had switched everything back after Draco had been born.
A very Slytherin approach, but Harry could not deny that the chances of success were quite good. "Anything else?"
Harry was woken from a light doze by Foxglove, who had claimed a place on the back of the chaise and started grooming the raven-haired. "What do you think I should do?" The young man looked up, but lowered his head again, when his owl hooted in irritation. "Who would even listen to me?" At another soft noise from Fox, a realisation hit. Everybody listened! Every bloody witch and wizard in Britain devoured, dissected, and repeated everything he said and did. Maybe Narcissa was right. Perhaps he could change their ways, keep the people safe, not only by catching dark wizards but by making people learn from their mistakes. Children were left alone until they started Hogwarts, but what would have happened if Dumbledore had taken Tom Riddle with him after the boy's magic had been revealed? What decisions would have Severus Snape made, had he not alienated his best friend with a horrible insult he had learned on his grandfather's knees? And how would Draco's life have turned out, had his parents encouraged friendship with people like Hermione instead of setting them up as competitors?
Risking being labeled a homewrecker, Momo gathered up her courage and walked to the dorm's hallway where the new student's dorm was.
“ Come on Harry, we have things to do before next period,” Draco said, as he collected his stuff and basically dragged Harry away.
“ Oh, Harry’s just being a brat and won’t eat his food. It’s hard to get him to eat anything but candy,” Draco says, rolling his eyes.
“ Thanks for lunch guys, but Harry gets tired after using his quirk. He needs to get some rest before dinner,” Draco says.
“ Ya sure be my guest, maybe having a pretty girl feed him will change his mind,” Draco says, nonchalantly.
Harry started to pepper light kisses down her neck. Stopping to nip and suck harder in some spots- leaving dark looking hickeys.
“ Remember what Mr. Sirius said about Harry’s quirk? Once he takes that collar off, he creates hormones that go through the air and affect his opponent. That’s what the masks are for, to block the quirk’s effects,” Midoriya explains.
“ Hey I wanted to make sure you guys didn’t miss breakfast but it seems like Harry already has a mouthful!” Sirius said, laughing at his own bad joke.
Then proceeded to take the entire length of his cock into his mouth. Draco choked out a moan once he felt the head of his dick collide with the back of Harry’s throat.
The trio had to admit that the Scottish hero school sounded brutal. Having to win a fight just to get to class everyday sounded a bit unnecessary.
Draco snickers, “ Partly because of that- but don’t get me wrong. Harry’s a major pervert and loves sex. But after awhile the nonstop compulsions have to get old huh?”
How exactly do you take care of a 6’3 man, who acts like a deranged toddler and has a psychotic addiction to sex?
She shivered at the feelings of him licking and biting down on her neck, making her scream out in pain and pleasure.
Sure, Kirishima and Bakugo had open chested costumes, but they didn’t look like Harry and they definitely didn’t have pierced nipples. She could see that Tsu was having the same problem next to her.
Midoriya turned to see the terrifying sight of a tall scowling British transfer student running towards him.
“ I had Draco in my chemistry lecture and he told the teacher off when he was asked a question,” Jirou says.
“ Alright we’ll see you guys later~ we got a hot date with the dean of students,” Sirius said, putting his arm around Harry and leading him out the door. Draco rolled his eyes at the man’s antics and followed them out.
As he began to move his leg up and down, Momo met it with movements of her own- effectively grinding down his leg.
“ I’m just saying that you guys are acting a little crazy- they are just students like us too,” Jirou lectures.
“ You have some interesting quirks. I’m guessing you did all of your combat training in high school?” Draco asks.
The taller man crawled on top of her, connecting them in another kiss. This time Momo could taste herself on his tongue. Her toes curled at the sinful flavor.
Momo didn’t have time to think if the new position was uncomfortable because she was met with a tongue plunging into her leaking entrance.
Meanwhile, Momo was searching for one of them on the lower, east side of the obstacle course. She could hear Todoroki’s fire quirk going off, and thought he must be fighting one of them already.
“ I’m sorry guys but we don’t want to overwhelm them, and if we brought you it would be five new people,” Uraraka explained.
Once dressed, Momo felt her air, which was out of its usual high ponytail and thoroughly messy from sex.
“ Sirius said that we have to stay here for at least a couple of months, until the last scandal quiets down,” Draco said, dressing down to his boxers. He started undressing Harry like you would a small child.
“ Remember cum isn’t a sustainable breakfast food! Now don’t be late for class, I’m trying to get in Aizawa's pants- I mean on his good side!” Sirius yelled, as he closed the door behind him, not even trying to keep his voice down.
“ Close...ahh...Fuck…” Harry moaned. The sound of slapping skin filled the surrounding air, as their bodies collided against one another.
He was starting to understand why the English government had sent them to a college course. These guys were major brats.
“ That green guy saw you fucking that girl huh? Don’t worry, I’ll talk to him. Now stop chewing on my hair and go to sleep. You know that gives me split ends,” Draco chided.
Harry stuck his pierced tongue out at him playfully, before turning to engulf the girl's mouth in a sloppy kiss. This made her moan even more wantonly.
Harry started going down her body, leaving a trail of kisses in his wake, and stopping to pinch her already abused nipple, gaining a gasp from Momo.
It made him wonder if there was another reason they were sent to UA’s program. It didn’t make sense if they already had pro-hero licenses.
“ Hey calm down, you look like you’re gonna barf. I just wanted to talk to you, ch” Draco said, eyeing the shaking teen.
Draco smirked down at her shocked face and moved past her, into the dorm, effectively switching places.
Harry knelt down at the edge of the bed pulling her down with him. He pushed her skirt and panties down and removed her shoes and socks quickly.
He could teleport small objects that he’s touched if he could see where they go and their path of trajectory. He learned that trick from one of his combat teachers- for long-distance combat.
But this was different. What he saw was raunchy and lewd and all over pornographic. He hated to admit it but it turned him on a little. He was a virgin, only ever kissing Uraraka a couple of times when they went out senior year of high school, but they broke it off because it felt awkward.
“ Oh good, for a second I thought this school would be boring as hell with just books and papers. So when do we fight?” Draco asks intensely.
Draco shrugged off his clothes with a sigh. Looking back at the actual nice dinner they just had, he was starting to admit that not everyone in this school was so bad.
“ Anyway~ Tsu was telling us how she was partnered with a certain foreign exchange student for poly-sci,” Mina says, moving her eyebrows up and down flirtingly at Tsu.
Midoriya chose to speak up, “ I had Harry in my English lecture and he slept through the whole thing.”
The two foreigners sit down on the opposite side of the table as Iida and Midoriya, with Uraraka on the end closest to Harry.
“ It’s great to meet you guys, you might see me around here since my job is being their handler,” Sirius said, motioning to the two boys beside him.
Anyway, this chapter is explicit for a reason. MINORS DO NOT READ. contains GRAPHIC depictions of Sex. Pure smut scene (Straight sex) at the end of the chapter- I put no warning beforehand so read at your own discretion.
When Draco saw Harry he immediately went over to him and checked over him for injuries. Midoriya and Uraraka thought he kind of looked like a concerned mother duck, looking over her young.
“Hello, I’m Tenya Iida class rep of 1-A, I’d like to formally welcome you to Class 1 A,” Iida said formally.
The class changed into street clothes and broke for lunch, having worked up an appetite from the training.
It looked like Draco was eating a rather expensive looking foreign meal, while Harry seemed to be eating from a pile of assorted candy.
All of them knew it was a very real possibility that they would have to go up against either of them in the near future, and that made them want to train harder.
“ Oh, I’m um meeting up with Midoriya and Iida in one of the private rooms. We’re having dinner with the….two new guys,” Uraraka says the last part hurriedly.
Todoroki made his way to the middle of the course, an open clearing where his opponent would have to face him, where he would have the upper hand. Or so Todoroki thought.
The entirety of Class 1-A took the seat around them, effectively giving the transfers no choice in the matter.
Personally, she hoped that the two were not involved so perhaps she could get her foot in the door and try to get Harry’s attention. She couldn’t get that moment from the training out of her head. With him pinning her body down beneath him and setting her body alight with his quirk.
Draco was wearing black cargo pants that had many pockets and matching combat boots. His dark green shirt was skin tight and clung to every muscle. That gained more than a few stares from students, mostly females.
Draco was teleporting the small objects as he threw them- making them seem like they were being thrown by someone on the ground- closer to Todoroki.
She hadn’t noticed that he had unbuttoned her shirt and was now in the process of taking off both her shirt and bra.
“ Oh, tomorrow is Thursday isn’t it? That means we’ll be doing some sort of quirk exercise. Do you have any idea what it’ll be Iida?” Midoriya asks.
But it was also hard to sneak around when someone like Harry is walking around looking like... that.
Midoriya, Iida, and Uraraka were currently in one of the many private study rooms on campus. Iida and Uraraka listened earnestly as Midoriya retold the story he had heard that morning.
Momo, no longer able to contain herself to moans of pleasure, screamed in delight as she felt the head of his cock hit deep inside her. Momo saw sparks as he continued to hit that same spot over and over.
“ Oh? I wonder what it’ll be, usually, it’s part of the strategy to pick what partner will work best with you for that task,” Midoriya says, starting to theorize possible strategies.
“ Uraraka, yesterday you promised that we would get to eat with them next! And don’t even try to lie, I know that’s where you are going,” Mina says.
Uraraka hits him on the shoulder saying that it still counts as a nickname, and that means they are friends now.
Harry chose that time to lick the underside of his cock from base to tip, with that tongue piercing scraping blissfully across the sensitive skin.
“ Studying with Midoriya and Iida for that biology test this week,” Urarak replies, taking a seat on the couch in between Jirou and Tsu.
“ Ah sorry teach, we got lost and Mirdoriya was kind enough to help us find our way here,” Draco says.
Todoroki knew that Harry’s quirk was airborne, and must’ve chosen Momo as a partner in case he went up against Harry’s quirk.
“ Well, it makes sense. If I were a villain doing something evil, it’d be pretty hard to stop if that guy was sucking my dick,” Denki continued.
The rest of the class followed suit and either paired up with their friends or with someone that their quirk worked well with.
“ So I assume that Draco beat you?” Momo asks, snickering at Todoroki who normally isn’t injured from a fight.
So a mandatory two-year college course became the new thing. After they finished three years of HS they would need to go through a hero college program.
“ There, now go to sleep. We actually have to go to class tomorrow,” Draco said, ignoring Harry who turned to spoon him from behind and chew on his hair.
Next to him was Harry who wore a skin-tight black leather bodysuit that left nothing to the imagination. He was barefoot and the only accessory was the ever-present black collar around his neck. What was eye-catching was his muscled chest clearly showing through the unzipped top portion of the jumpsuit. That also displayed clearly pierced nipples and the start of a tattoo that dipped down towards his belly button.
“ Hey, I just wanted to tell you Todoroki and Momo’s quirks since it’d seem a little unfair if you didn’t know.
The group studied the new students' hero costumes. They were no doubt being studied by everyone else on the field too, I mean who couldn’t. They were quite striking.
The effect of his quirk was almost immediate. Her pupils dilated as she breathed in the hormones and she felt her mind start to fog with lust.
He tells them to go sit down. Midoriya goes to his regular seat in between Iida and Uraraka. Harry and Draco sit at the two new desks shoved into the far left side of the class.
“ So uh I thought you might want to know us a little better since we already know some stuff about you guys,” Midoriya says.
We’ve all been fighting against each other so long we know a lot of our weak points, fighting styles, and techniques,” Midoriya says. Draco thanks him for the offer, and that it would be helpful to strategize.
“ So Sirius is here to make sure you do that? Become more grounded and in touch with normal citizens?” Uraraka asks.
Momo smiled back, sort of stunned to hear actual discernible speech instead of the usual unintelligible babble.
Harry greeted Uraraka with that silly nickname and started to squish the plush wrist cuffs on her outfit.
??! It was the transfer student Harry. He was currently fucking the daylights out of some upperclassmen girl that Midoriya couldn’t recognize.
Iida goes next and explains his engine quirk and how he can use it as a speed boost in a fight or for offensive maneuvers.
Little did he know the object was coming at him from a diagonal way, but the person throwing them was above him.
They stared at each other at a standstill. Momo assumed it was because Harry usually depended on his quirk to do the work instead of fighting, after all, he didn’t seem to be carrying any weapons.
“ Christ you smell like sex. Leave it to you to fuck a stranger the first day here,” Draco says, putting his phone away.
