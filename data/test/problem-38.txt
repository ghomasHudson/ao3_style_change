with everything. He fiercely snatched the invisibility cloak off him, revealing himself.
The Slytherin shook his head, stormy grey eyes boring into his emerald ones. "A little, but nothing I can't handle... Just take me,
"No, seriously! You have to admit that there's always been so much weird tension between Harry and Malfoy", Hermione said. She was giggling uncontrollably. "Ever since they met!"
He paused, letting out a sigh. "I had always got everything I wanted... but I couldn't have you." He paused again, just staring at the wall for a while before still continuing: "I became jealous and bitter and I hated that I wanted you when you yourself didn't give a shit about me. I wanted to make you suffer for doing that to me. In the end I ended up breaking your nose, taking the Mark and doing all those horrible things to people and ruining everything for good."
"Enough of that topic for now", Draco said, sounding very tense. "We've just began dating, mum."
"If you tell
How could it be possible that the
"You know very well who I'm talking about", Hermione said with another sigh. "It's happening again. Admit it. Just like in our 6th year."
"Yeah."
"Uh... I don't know... It depends. You're not even willing to give him a chance?" Harry found himself asking before he even realized what he was saying.
"Draco", he said, lifting his hand to stroke the other man's platinum hair with his fingers. "It's over between me and Ginny. We're done, finished,
"Yes", Draco said.
Harry swallowed, still hesitating.
Malfoy nodded, still not looking at him. Harry honestly didn't know what to say. He’d had no idea that Theodore was gay.
about me! How do you think it makes me feel?! Year after year he only kept looking at
Draco was moaning loudly when Harry started to angle his hard thrusts so that he was hitting Draco's prostate. Draco was rubbing himself off at the same time, his eyes shut tightly. His brain wasn't able to form any words anymore, he only concentrated on the mind-blowing pleasure. He was so fucking close already.
"One of those nightmares again?" Ron asked. He was sitting on his own bed and staring at him, still looking very drunk and also worried.
Draco's lips curved up to a smile. "Yes", he said. "Let's go back to your place."
"So you'll help me?" he asked sceptically.
"What do you mean?" Harry asked.
"What is HE doing here?" she asked coldly while wrinkling her nose in distaste.
Involuntarily Harry carefully released himself from Malfoy's grip and pulled his own arm from below him, slowly getting up from the couch. Harry's eyes were still resting on the sleeping Slytherin lying on his side. Malfoy was so beautiful… but never to be his. With a sad smile on his lips Harry turned around, heading to his and Ron's room.
Harry hadn't been able to imagine that it could feel so good. Draco was so deep inside him and saying such dirty things once in a while, and those beautiful eyes looking into his soul at the same time... oh Merlin how
Malfoy shook his head. "I didn't", he said. "I was just having another nightmare about the war, if you must know. Theo was simply worried about me!" He paused, still very pissed. "I would very much appreciate it if you and your friends would quit spreading gossip about me and Theo! Or about my
Hermione was delighted. "Oh! But that's wonderful news!" she said with a smile. "I knew you'd kiss and make up soon."
"Yeah. It's just that... I really am sorry... about
to remember in all of those and sometimes Harry felt that his head might explode because of all the information. And to be honest, it wasn't the only reason...
"Yeah, you
Draco, however, wasn't going to be fooled anymore. "Stop playing games with me!" he snapped, wanting to push the other man down the stairs for still daring to lie to him.
"About Malfoy", he said. Ginny gave him a piercing look.
"Okay…", Harry said, feeling very confused. "Good night."
Nah… Of course it couldn't be. Once again he was imagining ridiculous things just because he was drunk. Drunk and
"Maybe you just didn't see him", Pansy said.
His voice died as he found himself staring at Malfoy's upper body which was covered by seven large scars all over it. They were very light, well faded and healed but he could still see them clearly enough, and he didn't need to ask where they had come from. He knew.
"Awkward? It's dreadful!" Malfoy spat. "I'm sharing a room with him!" He went quiet for a while, finally calming down. "He came on to me this morning and... Well. There was a kiss."
is going anywhere anymore."
How could he have ever thought that Malfoy was an ugly, pointy-faced brat? How could he ever have hated this man so much? How could he have done such acts of violence against him, when all he wished to do right now was to kiss him... and not just in the lustful, passionate way. No, right now he wanted to touch those beautiful lips lightly with his own and feel their softness, to kiss him tenderly, to show the man how much he cared for him.
"Did you have a hangover?" he called out, allowing his towel to fall to the floor as he started pulling his underpants on.
"Well, let's go get that one first, then", Harry said.
After a long, intense kiss they kept resting in each others arms, just holding and caressing one another.
"You okay?" Ron asked.
It was midnight again when Harry and Ron were finally finished with their Dark Arts essays, heading to sleep with a few others. Only three students were left in the common room, including Malfoy who had fallen asleep in his chair after all the studying.
"Calm down, mate", Ron whispered. "What's wrong with you?"
Harry found himself staring, something which had already happened earlier once today, at the library. It had been the first time he had really looked at Malfoy since the trial.
"Oh... yeah", Harry replied. "Draco took me to this nice clothing shop. It was time I renewed my wardrobe a bit, don't you agree?"
Hermione was now knocking at their door in frustration.
"Yeah, cheating!" Draco hissed icily, tears now flowing down his cheeks. "How
"Hi, Harry", she said casually, wrapping her arm tightly around him.
Malfoy seemed to tense a little. He stretched himself to place the book on his night stand and then returned to his slouching position, folding his hands on his lap. "Take a seat and fire away then." He gestured towards the bed.
Goyle didn't answer. Before the door closed after him, he could see the sceptical look on Goyle's face.
Harry had been thinking about that night
To make the things even more difficult, Harry had finally been able to sort things out with Ginny so they were still together, but Harry felt guilty for being more interested in Malfoy than his girlfriend. He never dreamt of Ginny anymore, he didn't have as much fun with her anymore as they had used to, he didn't look at her the same way anymore, he wasn't even looking forward to seeing her all that much... and even when Harry
"Well as long as we get some food it's all that matters to me", Draco said.
"Look, Potter... Why would I want to talk to you? And even if I'd want to, you wouldn't understand", Malfoy answered.
"I'm nothing without you", Harry continued, pressing their foreheads together and holding the sides of the other man's neck in his hands, looking deep into his grey eyes with his own green ones. "I love
"I was there, remember?" Malfoy said, like it was obvious. "I saw her flipping out and I'm not stupid. Of course I knew what it was about."
"Would you just shut up already, Harry", Draco said with a sigh. "I haven't fucked anyone else. I slept on Greg's couch."
, so…"
He thought about that one early October night when they had talked properly for the first time in their lives, Malfoy opening up to him all of a sudden… But no, he had been dreaming about Malfoy even before that. That night when he had helped Malfoy gather all his stuff from the corridor. He remembered how they had looked deep into each other's eyes for the very first time. Of course they had looked at each other before that, they had looked at each other for years, but it had never been so intense like that time. It had been the first time that Harry had noticed the exact colour and beauty of Malfoy's eyes… and the first time he had dreamt about him.
Harry could still clearly remember his dream from that same night too. The dream where he had been laying naked in bed with Malfoy, kissing him, holding him in his arms… screwing him… Oh lord.
"Feels good, eh?" Draco whispered.
He was standing there for a good while, holding his breath again, just waiting… but no one was coming. He was listening carefully. He didn't hear any footsteps coming towards the door. To be precise, he couldn't hear anything, and he was starting to get worried. Before he even realized it, he was already at the half opened door, passing through it as quietly as he could.
Malfoy didn't answer. He had finished dressing to his pyjamas and closed the door of his wardrobe.
"Promise me you won't get mad, okay?" Hermione made sure first and Ron nodded slowly, unsure of where the conversation was heading to.
Ron sighed too. "No reason to apologize to me. I'm not angry at you, Harry. I know she's not the easiest girl to be around with... But if you leave her, do it quickly and please do it
He finally started eating, even though he still wasn't feeling hungry. He'd have to eat something or else he knew he'd feel even worse soon.
The common room was still empty but he could hear some clattering and talking coming from the bedroom corridor. Raising his eyebrow, Harry opened the door, entering the corridor. His eyes widened a little at the sight.
Draco pulled away and thrust back in a little harder and deeper and Harry was suddenly shuddering from pleasure, gasping: "Ah,
"I wasn't planning on messing with your head..."
else? If Draco asked what was on his mind, Harry always answered that it was nothing important, just normal work related things. Draco wanted to trust him – but he couldn't help hearing Ginny Weasley's malignant words repeating themselves in his brain.
listen to me now!" A cold, morbid smile rose to the Slytherin's trembling lips as he leaned a little closer to Harry, his teary, stormy grey eyes flaring. "You think I'm fucking stupid, do you?! You think you can just toy with me and instantly go back to snog your little girlfriend when we come back, without consequences?! Wrong!"
"Maybe", Theodore said quietly. "Well, in case anyone sees him, I need to talk to him." He left the common room with his head bowed down, heading towards the bedrooms.
"Mum, please!" Draco cut her off, running his hand through his hair, face as red as a tomato.
Harry found himself thinking. If only he could touch him...
"But I am", Harry said. "I need to talk to my boyfriend."
That was all the letter said, but Harry knew it must have required a lot from Malfoy to say even that much to him. Malfoys didn't usually thank anyone, so this meant a lot. They’d never talked about it afterwards.
He loosened Malfoy's grip around him, quickly jumping out of the bed. He made his way to the other side of the bed to get his glasses and put them on, starting to search for his pyjamas and underpants next. He was walking back to the other side of the bed when he heard the sheets rustle and trembling he glanced towards the voice.
"You're not fooling me", she said with a sigh. "I don't know if you've noticed but I've been keeping an eye on you and… even if I hadn't… uh… What I mean is, it's pretty clear to me… Especially after I talked with Ginny today…"
Later that night Harry found himself sitting alone at the Hog's Head's bar counter. He had not planned to go there that weekend at all. However, because of everything that had happened today he had needed to get out of Hogwarts, just for a while. And so there he was, drinking again.
"Of course it's not mutual!" Malfoy hissed. "I'm not gay!"
"Huh?" the panting Slytherin asked with a weak voice.
"W-what-", he gasped as Draco took his erection deep in his mouth. "Ah, fuck!
Harry found himself admiring those long, black lashes of Malfoy's, that perky nose of his, those slightly parted and full, pink lips... Harry's heart was thumping madly in his chest.
Malfoy finished buttoning his shirt and started pulling his trousers off next, still his back turned towards Harry.
His Marauder's Map was in his and Ron's bedroom and he knew he could go and check from it if he wanted to, but… he couldn't make himself do it. He had a terrible feeling that he knew all too well what they might be doing right now, somewhere. He was feeling very, very sick right now.
They spent a long time kissing, holding and looking at each other before finally turning the lights off, about to get some sleep. Harry had no intention of going back to his and Ron's room tonight. Actually, he would rather sleep next to Draco every night from now on.
"Can you imagine
Harry found himself shamelessly inhaling the beautiful scent of his ex-rival. Damn... Malfoy smelled
"So do I", Theodore said back.
"He almost killed Katie, Harry!" Ginny snapped. "He almost killed Ron as well! The poisoned mead, remember that one?! If you hadn't been there, your best friend would be DEAD, and all because of
"It wasn't earlier", Malfoy snorted. "But like you said, I'm meddled in this too now, so-"
Theo had smashed the wall with his fist, and he was now shaking with anger, his normally pale face slowly turning red.
For years he had longed for Harry, ever since their third year at Hogwarts. He had dreamt about him for so long, fallen deeply in love with him, suffered when seeing Harry kissing with someone else... Then,
"Thank goodness", Malfoy sneered. "I don't know if this comes as a great surprise to you but I can't stand her either."
They had stayed awake very late last night and there had been a lot of snuggling, kissing, and of course, different kinds of sex. Draco had been amazing, he had wanted more and more of Harry, and Harry naturally hadn't resisted.
it definitely was a nightmare, hearing him taking it up the ass like a-"
"There's nothing wrong with
Draco's whole body was shaking. "You liar!" he hissed, tears running down his face. He turned around, about to continue his journey. "Leave me alone."
When the other man finally looked at him, there was a melancholic, embarrassed look in his grey eyes.
"Well if that's the case, you can always visit during the break if you want to?" Harry suggested, shrugging his shoulders. "Or we can meet somewhere for a coffee or something."
Malfoy turned to look at him. "It
"Huh?" he heard himself whispering.
Harry shook his head and let out a sigh, staring at the ceiling again. "No, not even with her. Only with you. Feel free to laugh", he said, ashamed. He knew that Malfoy was going to mock him so bad now and it was already pissing him off.
Harry and Draco were lying under a blanket on the Slytherin's bed, their naked bodies entwined. They had just spent almost an hour making love to each other and Harry was exhausted. He had wanted Draco to top him again, and blimey, it had been fantastic.
after that and knew that his jealousness and his fear of losing the man would have to lessen. He loved Draco and didn't want the other man to feel like he was chained down by him.
"Fine then. I still think he's lying about that night, though", Ron said. "He's definitely lying."
"Want you so fucking much, baby", Draco heard Harry breathe roughly against his skin as his lips travelled down to Draco's chest next, kissing and sucking on his hard nipples teasingly. Harry's hand had found it's way beneath his underpants now and his thumb was swirling around the slick head of his cock.
"You always look gorgeous, Draco. I spent the whole night thinking about you, I couldn't concentrate on anything else. I just waited for you to come back, but you wouldn't show up, and I had a bad feeling that you were going to sleep with him. I hated the idea of his hands on you and -"
"Yes", he found himself groaning, closing his eyes. "Yes, Harry..."
Harry realized how much he had missed flying. He had really needed this. He loved the feeling of the cold autumn wind blowing against his cheeks and through his hair as he flew higher and higher in the air. It was a great way to relax and forget about everything else for a while. And Harry
Harry, who was lying on top, was moving his hands on Draco's body, ravenously getting rid of all the remaining clothing still covering it. Draco soon followed his example.
Draco distantly remembered having read about the man some time earlier. Buckthorn was a dangerous psychopath who had committed numerous crimes.
"I know", Harry sighed.
Harry took a big swig of orange juice and grimaced. "Not yet", he answered. "But I will. Later today I guess... I wanted to give her some time."
"Good morning", Harry said with a gentle smile.
Harry's eyes widened. "Oh..." He slowly turned towards the Slytherin.
"Sorry, mate... Just wanted to make sure", Ron said quietly. "I just still can't believe that you're really tieing the knot with
"Well, she also spent most of her life in Azkaban, so it must have affected her", Harry pointed out.

"Just asking", Harry shrugged. "I thought he'd want to spend the Friday night with you after..."
"What
He had
"I love you too", Draco whispered and pressed their lips together.
by you! I thought you loved me, that we were going to get married and..." His eyes were already starting to tear up again.
"Oh fuck!" the Slytherin was soon moaning in exhaustion as Harry was hitting his prostate with each deep thrust. "Gosh... Harry!!!"
As you might guess, at first the atmosphere around them was very tense and they were all just sipping their drinks and avoiding looking at each other in the eyes. After all, they had loathed each other for years, since their very first year at school.
"Tell me what happened between you two", Harry said.
"Isn't it weird that there's a Quidditch match tomorrow and we're not playing", Ron sighed.
"I know... Back to studying again...", Harry groaned.
him about it?!" Ron cut him off right away, face flushing.
For the first time in their lives, Harry, Ron and Hermione were watching the Quidditch match together with Malfoy and Goyle.
"Sounds just like you", Draco commented with a chuckle.
He sighed heavily, tapping his fingers against his glass. What the
"There's nothing wrong with my memory, Ron!" Harry said angrily. "I haven't forgotten what he's done."
When everyone else had already congratulated him and Draco, and Harry saw his ex-girlfriend walking to them, he didn't know how to act. He was feeling very nervous because he had no idea what to expect.
"Where have
After that she had turned around and left Draco standing in the middle of the street, his stomach turning to knots.
However, after the biggest ruckus had passed and they hadn't had anything to hide anymore, they had been able to fully concentrate on each other and school. By the end of the school year they had both passed their N.E.W.T.S with excellent grades and graduated, and after that Draco had moved out from Wiltshire's Malfoy Manor to live with Harry in London.
Hermione, who had been oddly quiet, immediately turned towards Ron, giving her boyfriend a triumphant laugh.
After a while Harry took the head into his mouth and started sucking on it, his deep green eyes looking at Draco at the same time. Draco was groaning, his hands twisting the sheets, and
The Slytherin's grey eyes were looking deep into his own. "Fuck me, Harry. I want you so much", the blond breathed.
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have believed what Ron said", Harry continued. "But you kind of said it yourself... at the library. So..."
He finally started wrapping up his parchment and Malfoy pulled away from him. Harry closed his Potions book, stood up and pushed the chair under the desk, turning towards the other man who was still standing there, very close to him. "Should we -", Harry started, moving his hand through his hair. His sentence was cut off because when he lifted his gaze, he found Malfoy looking straight at him with an unrecognizable expression on his face, and the next thing he knew was that his emerald green eyes had – once again – locked with Malfoy's grey ones.
Harry's heart jumped in his chest. Everyone else had already arrived, so it was very clear who were the ones finally coming back. Harry, who was already standing in front of his and Ron's door, got a sudden idea and quickly pulled his invisibility cloak from his pocket, starting to cover himself up. He was barely ready when the door leading to the corridor already opened up.
"Night", Harry answered and disappeared to his own room. He went straight to bed and fell asleep almost immediately.
"Why are you defending him?!" Ginny asked icily.
"Yes, I'm here", Harry said softly. "And this time I promise that I'm not going anywhere."
"Out? Dinner?" he said incredulously, raising his brow questioningly.
where
"Gosh, Ron", Harry sighed heavily. "I'm happy to get out of the school for a while after all that studying, okay? Is that not allowed? Don't wanna waste the whole holiday sulking..."
Harry shrugged. "Because I want to?"
Once Harry even took Draco to ice-skating – although that didn't go as Harry had planned. Naturally, Draco who had never been ice-skating before, sucked at it
wanted to spend time with her, you wouldn't just forget it like that?"
already back to normal, like nothing had even happened between them?! He hadn't paid much attention to them earlier that day.
"Draco, my love, I'm glad that you've found someone in your life", she said, a smile on her lips.
"Alright then, it's time", Rivers said with a small smile on his face. "Harry James Potter, do you take Draco Lucius Malfoy to be your husband? Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, in sickness and health, and be faithful only to him so long as you both shall live?"
There was a short silence, before finally Greg said: "Now, tell us everything, so we can help you. Start from the very beginning, okay?"
Harry didn't waste any time. He had already reached the other man and taken a seat right next to his shaking body, and when he softly moved his hand to the Slytherins back he heard Malfoy let out a sob. That did it. Without hesitation Harry grabbed a hold of him, gently pulling the crying blond into his arms.
"I'm happy for you too, Harry, and for Ginny of course." Hermione was smiling. "You two really are a great couple. I know we've been busy with all this studying, but you
"What are you doing here?" Malfoy finally asked instead of answering to Harry's question. Harry noticed that Malfoy sounded very tense, so he slowly pulled his hand away from the other man's shoulder.
"You're still here?" he asked, addressing Malfoy.
"Perhaps", Ginny said. She was already standing in front of the door. "We r-really need to think this over and... it's not possible if we're both there with everyone else around all the time, you know..." Her voice was shaking.
Goyle seemed to hesitate for a while. "Nah", he finally said. "I'm staying." Harry had to admit to himself that he was a bit disappointed.
Harry spent most of Monday afternoon and evening in the library with his friends because they had received tons of homework, and when they finally returned to their common room after dinner, Harry was exhausted. They all went to sit in the corner, Harry's eyes circling around the room. Pansy and Blaise were lounging on the couch, Dean, Neville and Seamus were sitting across from them... However, one particular pair quickly caught his full attention.
Harry noticed that Theodore looked a bit disappointed before heading towards the bedrooms. "Good night."
"Ginny-"
"Don't even talk to me, Harry!" Ginny cried, rubbing her eyes with her shaking hands. "You've been fucking him behind my back and
"I don't give a damn about that, Theo, it's not-" Malfoy sounded annoyed. His gaze travelled through Ron and Hermione and finally stopped at Harry and Ginny snuggling. He didn't continue his sentence, instead he moved on and went to sit on an armchair on the other side of the room. It seemed to be his favourite place in the common room.
to him."
"So... You're hiding from him because he's gay", he finally stated.
Harry, however, was shaking his head. He was not going to let Malfoy down by gossiping about her mother's illness.
The Slytherin glanced at him. "What do you think?" he asked with a snort, but already had a very tiny grin on his face. "I guess the second round was a little too much for me..."
night with Draco Malfoy than
This time, however, the kiss didn't lead to anything more. Instead of the kiss being hungry and full of lust, this time it was soft and full of love. Harry's heart was hammering in his chest, his fingers caressing the nape of the Slytherin's neck, and he felt all warm and fuzzy inside.
"Weren't you supposed to go?" Harry heard Malfoy's strained voice say and he flinched.
"Yes", Harry answered, trying to wipe away his inconvenient thoughts. It was difficult.
He couldn't resist moving his free hand to his cheek, caressing it gently with his fingers.
love him back and aren't just after his body or money... I guess I could, perhaps, try to help you."
If he didn't change, it would become a huge problem in their relationship at some point, for sure. There would always be people drooling over his man and he would have to live with it and trust that Draco wouldn't betray his trust for a random fling. After all, Draco had craved for him for years.
, he groaned. "Harry..."
"Fuck me, you
Harry glanced at Ron, who walked over to give him his letter. He could feel his hands shaking a little as he rolled the parchment open, cleared his throat and started to read aloud.
"Do you like it?" the other man only asked, sounding tense, completely ignoring his comment about the price. "If you'd like something else, we can take it back and you can choose another. They've got at least a hundred different -"
Normally he would’ve spent the Christmas day with the Weasley family, eating Molly Weasley's delicious cooking, chatting and playing some games with the others, opening gifts and finally staying up late with Ron, Hermione and Ginny.
Explaining to his friends that he needed to go check something, Harry finally left the Great Hall, heading back to their dorms.
and nothing would stop him.
Before he knew what he was doing he had already jumped up. Ron and Hermione stared at him.
Giving the Slytherin one despondent glance, Harry left the room and headed to his own room where Ron was already deep asleep. He quickly changed to his pyjamas before taking off his glasses and burying himself under the blanket. A tremulous sigh escaped his mouth as he kept staring into emptiness. He had fucked up everything and there was no going back anymore.
Harry's smile was slowly fading away. He could never be the one. Malfoy was not gay, he liked girls, he had told Harry that. Last night Malfoy had been very drunk and so upset, completely wrecked, and he had relied on Harry simply because he had been there at the moment, that was all. Malfoy didn't care about him the same way Harry cared for him. Also, Malfoy already had one friend who was drooling over him, he would completely freak out if he found out that Harry – who he had only just learned to trust – felt the same way as Theodore did… And, even though Harry and Ginny had been fighting a lot lately, it was a fact that Harry was still in a relationship with her. Besides Harry had to admit to himself that he really sucked at being a boyfriend. He was far from the perfect man. Even if Malfoy
Harry found himself staring at Malfoy's adam's apple and quickly lowered his gaze. He was really trying his best to concentrate on his essay but he couldn't help gazing at the blond from time to time. Malfoy looked really hot today.
Harry let out a short laugh. "Calm down, Draco. I'm just talking about future. We're still young."
What if Malfoy had been lying to him? What if Malfoy actually had some feelings towards his best friend and just wouldn't admit it? What if he had actually enjoyed the kiss..? Malfoy had gotten
"Oh for
"What the bloody hell are
"How many times do I have to tell you?!" Malfoy asked, sounding very pissed.
Finally they arrived to their common room. After walking through the portrait door Harry pulled the invisibility cloak off, wrapped it away quickly and pushed it back inside his pocket.
"Harry is going to... leave me", he managed to gasp before starting to sob broken-heartedly again. "He has... someone else. Someone from work I think... He's... cheating on me... It's been going on for
with him?!" Ron hissed.
Actually, they didn't talk a lot about anything, really. Sometimes they were even the last ones in the common room at night, but they still didn't have things to say to each other. They may have been reading or doing homework in different sides of the room, and the only thing breaking the silence would be the crackling of the fireplace, flipping of pages or a quill rustling against parchment. This could easily go on for an hour or two. Then the other would finally gather his stuff and go to sleep, still saying nothing at all.
Malfoy turned to Goyle, looking very uneasy. "Thanks, Greg…" he said quietly. "I owe you."
"Goyle was there too", Harry added quickly, but it didn't make Ginny cool down at all.
He took a step closer so that their bodies were now fully pressed against each other, his eyes boring into Malfoy's own as he started to lean closer. He could feel his heart thumping madly and the blood coursing through his veins. He could feel the butterflies in his stomach, feel Malfoys warm and so tempting body against him, Malfoy's heavy breathing against his lips... And, he could definitely feel his own pulsating erection pressing tightly against the slightly taller man's lower body and there was no doubt that Malfoy felt it too.
" she pouted right away. Simply hearing Malfoy's name was clearly enough to make her angry.
His quill stopped moving as soon as he heard Malfoy chuckling on the bed behind him.
"Thank you", he said uneasily. "Ginny, I'm -"
Harry was waiting for Ginny in the library, finishing his Dark Arts homework, and of course that was when Malfoy entered the library as well. Malfoy was already passing by when he suddenly slowed down, noticing him sitting there.
"Why did you do that? Do you know how different things would have been if you had been in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor..?" Malfoy's voice quietened down. "What we... could have been..."
"Six", he answered shortly, quickly breaking the eye contact between them. The longer he’d look at Malfoy, the harder this would be for him.
Harry glanced at his best friend, starting to get frustrated. "I didn't
Draco knew that he shouldn't have listened to anything Ginny Weasley said to him the day he'd ran into her after meeting with his old Slytherin classmates at a coffee bar.
Harry smiled and they melted into a long, tender kiss, Draco's fingers tangled in Harry's messy hair and Harry's hand caressing Draco's back gently.
Harry immediately felt a twinge of jealousy. This time he recognized it for what it was. Instead of him, Malfoy was going out with Theodore tonight. The man who they both knew was crazy for him… Harry did not like that. He didn't like that at all.
A short silence fell over and they just looked at each other until Draco finally answered.
"How long, Draco?" he asked.
"What?
"So you were just
I've ever done to you", he said quietly. "I know I'm asking for a lot, but I really, really wish you could forgive me and... we could still be friends."
Hermione, however, didn't even bother listening to him. "You're becoming obsessed with him again, Harry", she stated.
"Marry me", Harry said again. His eyes had never shown as much emotion as they did at the moment.
stop. I did not come here to listen lies."
"I don't think tomorrow's going to be any easier", Goyle added.
He had just managed to close the door behind him – loudly on purpose – when he already heard heavy footsteps storming towards him from the living room. His lips turned to a self-satisfied smile as he kept unbuttoning his long brown coat. His plan had worked. Harry was most certainly pissed.
Finally Draco's worst fears started to come alive as Harry stopped even initiating sex with him anymore. Their sexual intercourses lessened, and the times that they actually did have sex, it was always from Draco's suggestion and Harry's thoughts seemed to be somewhere else entirely.
I'm tired of hearing that word!" Harry lost his temper. "It's not just about
did you sleep at?!"
"Gosh, Harry...", Draco gasped against his shoulder. "I love you so fucking much."
Also, Ron knows about us and probably hates me... Everyone else in these dorms knows about us as well. Actually... I think the whole school might already know by now. Including the professors. So..." He paused again just to look at the Slytherin deep in the eyes for a while. "… No more secrets, Draco. Nothing to hide anymore. I'm all yours. If you still want me, that is", he finished his sentence, still caressing the other man's hair.
?" he gasped, covering his mouth with his hand.
"And why is that?" Malfoy asked.
It definitely was working.
Harry's whole body was shaking. He quickly grabbed his school case from the floor, nervously starting to toss all his own stuff inside from the desk he had worked at. He was avoiding looking at the blond Slytherin.
When Ginny broke their kiss and looked at him with her deep brown eyes, he felt nothing. Nothing close to... He glanced over the couch to the other side of the room, where Malfoy was talking with Blaise and Pansy. Malfoy was facing Harry and Ginny, but he wasn't
Hermione scowled at her boyfriend. "Ron!" she hissed.
talking to each other and he was drunk, he didn't want to leave either.
"It won't. I mean it, Draco", Harry continued. "As if few old pictures would change my mind. I've already made my decision."
"What the hell...", he muttered by himself. He didn't know much about jewellery or watches, but looking at the watch in his hand, he could still tell that it had cost
"But it turns you on, doesn't it?" Draco said back, winking.
THE END 💙💙
Goyle gave him another questioning look, still waiting for an answer.
wrecked, he was torn apart. It was really breaking Harry's heart now and he couldn't stand it anymore…
I was only -"
Harry was not surprised. In fact it would had been a miracle if Ginny hadn't told anyone at all. He was pretty sure that Hermione wasn't the only one who knew about their argument.
Harry shook his head. "I do care about her, that's for sure", he said. "I really do. But all this fighting and other stuff… I… I don't know. I don't know
It didn't take long until they both got their orders and walked closer to Harry, taking seats right beside him. They all nodded to each others.
”I’m not as stupid as you think, Harry”, Ron said, flashing a grin. ”You’re thinking about my sister."
"You slimy,
"Yeah, I know...", Harry said quietly. "I'm so sorry, Ginny..."
Malfoy was sitting comfortably on the couch, cross-legged, rubbing his glass with his fingers and chatting with the group. He was acting as normally as always and it made Harry feel even more uneasy because it was just like the whole thing between them had never happened. He wanted to know what the Slytherin was thinking but there was no way to read the other man's thoughts because of the mask he was always wearing and it was really making him frustrated. He got up and walked to the bar counter again, buying another beer.
things that he wanted to do to Malfoy at the moment, but
Harry laughed, shaking his head. Draco was impossible.
"Fuck... Harry...", he was moaning. "I'm ready... Fuck me..."
"So did you, Draco", Harry pointed out, but the Slytherin didn't pay any attention to his comment.
, okay?"
"Fine, we are coming with you, this one time…", he said, still a very sceptical look on his pale face. "But just for a short while."
" she cried out.
Where are you going so soon?" Hermione asked. Harry was as perplexed as she was.
he promised sincerely.
"Did I mean what?" he asked.
"It was about you", he mumbled. Malfoy's eyes were now fixed on him.
"So, you agree that this was the first and last time that we...?" he asked tentatively. He secretly hoped that Malfoy would show some signs of objection, in any possible way, but it didn't happen.
"Yeah", Draco said. "But that was ages ago and -"
Harry nodded. "I know. Better than I assumed", he said as quietly as Hermione, flashing a grin at her. "Who would have thought?"
Draco nodded. "Yeah", he said. "Does it bother you?"
The other man turned his head to Harry. "Yeah", he said. "Did you come up with anything or do you need more time?"
Harry's hands were immediately all over the Slytherin's perfect, slender upper body that was covered by dark green shirt. Draco was kissing him hard, his lips almost crushing Harry's mouth by all that power, fingers tangled in his messy hair, and he could feel that the Slytherin was already hard as a rock, his erection pressed against Harry's abdomen.
"Yes", Harry said, thrusting deep inside him. "All yours, baby. Every inch. All yours."
"He definitely has a weird way of showing how much he cares about someone", Draco snorted.
"Hates me", Malfoy said icily. "Like almost everyone else in this school. Nothing new about that... I'm nothing but a Death Eater scum to everyone." Malfoy lowered his gaze to his feet.
I almost forgot", he snarled before getting up swiftly. "You are a
"Right now", Harry said and stood up, dragging his girlfriend with him as he stormed through the Great Hall, almost everyone's eyes following them as they left.
One night Harry took Draco to a movie theatre to see a comedy film together. It was quite a new thing for both of them, because having lived with the Dursley's Harry hadn't been able to do all the stuff that normal children would with their families. They both enjoyed watching the movie from big screen and planned to do it again sometime.
"Hmm?"
"I don't know", Harry answered briefly, trying to shrug it off like it was not a big deal at all. "I thought that I heard some noice coming from your room so... Nothing else."
After the door of the 12 Grimmauld Place closed behind them, Harry instantly found himself being pressed against the nearest wall in the hallway.
"Congrats, Harry", Ginny said to his ear. He could hear from her voice that she had been crying.
he think about it? He didn't know. All these arguments with her, all those opposite opinions about different things, all that yelling… He cared about Ginny, he really did, but was it enough? Would it ever get any better with her?
He soon caught up with the Slytherin and grabbed him from by the shoulder, only to get roughly pushed to the floor on his back, hitting the back of his head very painfully. Everything went black for a few seconds, but he could still hear Draco shouting at him from above.
The next day Harry and Draco packed their stuff and headed back to the King's Cross Railway station and platform 9 ¾. They had hardly managed to enter the platform when they already crashed into the one person they both least wanted to meet.
Ginny must have noticed Harry's uncertain expression because her smile suddenly faded away. "What's wrong?" she asked, jutting her lower lip out in a pout.
"And I think I'm gonna go with... The Triple", Malfoy said, then suddenly noticing Harry. He raised his eyebrows. "Make that
"Malfoy and Theodore", he said quietly.
Malfoy was still a very outspoken and haughty young man, that hadn't changed either, but somehow Harry had gotten used to it. After all, he had learned that Malfoy also had a warm and caring side in him, a side the Slytherin was, of course, trying his best to hide it behind his mask, but Harry wasn't fooled that easily anymore. After having spent so much more time with the Slytherin, he knew better now. Malfoy really cared about his friends and family and he was always ready to defend or help them if needed. Harry liked that thing about Malfoy a lot. He had once thought that Malfoy was nothing but a coldhearted and selfish bastard who didn't have any real friends and was only using everyone for his own gain, but in reality Malfoy was far from that.
"I know he's done a lot of stuff, Ginny... If anyone knows, I do", Harry said, feeling terribly frustrated. "But there's more to it than meets the eye. His childhood was not normal, imagine being born into a family like his. With Lucius Malfoy as a father, he was never able to –"
don't tell me you are friends with him."
After that he and Theodore disappeared to the corridor.
Harry was confused. He would never have thought that he would end up having a civil conversation with Theodore Nott of all the people. But then again, who would have thought that he'd end up as friends and even more with Draco Malfoy?
"Don't bother trying that shit with me! You just made your choice!" Draco hissed back, not listening to him.
And then you and your other friends would have handed me straight to the Dark Lord the first moment you got the chance."
"Harry... You must stop... Or else...", Draco was whining. Harry was working on him all too well and he was already getting close.
When the dinner was finally ready, they sat across to each other in the dining room and Harry was pleased to see that Draco – who usually didn't eat much at school – was now eating Harry's cooking with a good appetite. He smiled by himself.
"What did I tell you? Still better than you", he teased.
"Okay, we'll try not to tell her", Hermione finally said. "We don't want her to be upset the whole Christmas break."
Harry felt his heart starting to beat faster as Malfoy was suddenly leaning much closer to him, his body pressing heavily against Harry's back. He swallowed, cursing in his mind. Damn Malfoy and his perfect, slender body against him, damn this man for making him feel this way again...
Harry's face was priceless, a sudden understanding seeming to overwhelm him. He let go of Draco's arm. "Is that what this is about? Is that what you think I was doing that night?!" he breathed. "Merlin, Draco... When was the last time you read the Daily Prophet?!"
"Me too", Malfoy said, closing his eyes with a yawn. A wisp of his platinum hair was hanging on his forehead. Harry found himself staring at him. Malfoy's current posture, his eyes closed and his head thrown back... it reminded Harry of his last night's dream. The way he'd been sucking on that neck of his... holding him tight on his lap while... His cheeks started to heat up and he quickly looked away when Malfoy opened his mouth to speak again.
"If I could take everything back, I really would, you know", Draco continued. "If I had a chance to go back, I would never join Voldemort. I would fight by your side."
Malfoy looked pissed. "It's not about him being gay. It's because he's in love with me."
He turned to glance at the Slytherin who was now watching the TV again, noticing that the blond didn't look relaxed anymore. His posture had stiffened and he looked a little tense. Harry saw the Adam's apple bobbing in the Slytherin's throat before he turned to face him. Harry felt need filling him. He wanted to kiss and touch Draco so bad that he had a hard time to not lunge at him right in that very moment.
They were lying like that for a long time, both panting heavily, neither of them able to speak. Harry's face was pressed against the other man's neck, his eyes closed.
Most of the Gryffindor and Slytherin students spent the evening in the common room, flipping through their school books, groaning, cursing and writing as fast as they were able to. Everyone was in bad temper.
"Because it's for his own good", Malfoy answered.
"I thought you wouldn't come", Malfoy said again and Harry immediately noticed how vulnerable he looked at the moment, his normal confidence all gone.
Harry got some time for his own thoughts. He'd have to talk to Ron and Hermione tomorrow and apologize to them. It wasn't their fault that Harry's head was all mixed up all of a sudden. To make matters even worse, Ginny was probably pissed at him too, since he hadn't paid any attention to her that day. He would have to apologize to her too.
Draco shrugged. "You tell me... Of course, it was nothing more than a crush at first. I think it was the final Quidditch match at our third grade that started it."
"Did you go to Hogsmeade today?" he asked.
"Harry, we need to talk."
"I… I didn't say so", Harry mumbled. "It's
Harry rolled his eyes. "Oh, just shut up", he said. "It's not like you have to sleep here."
, Ginny. He didn't want to do it! He was scared and he just wanted to save his parents, like any child would." He was quiet for a while before he added one more thing. "I'm not holding any grudge towards Malfoy anymore because I know better now, and I really wish you wouldn't either."
Before neither of them could manage to say anything, Ron was already gone.
Malfoy froze and stared at his hand before slowly lifting his gaze to him.
"Yeah, right! And when is that going to happen?! In a month?! In

"Hey! What the

Theodore was standing at his own door, glaring at him. "I

enjoy spending time with you. I would never have thought that I'd be saying this to you of all the people but... I feel very comfortable when you're around." Draco's hand was squeezing his own a little tighter. "I like you being close to me and... I really, sincerely, care about you."
"No. You're
Harry also secretly observed Malfoy at lunch, being glad to see that this time the other man ate a little better. He also seemed to have a good conversation with his friends and was even wearing a tiny smile on his lips. However, Harry was suddenly woken from his thoughts when he realized that he had been caught staring.
Harry was astounded. "What?! I'm not taking anyone's side here", he said. "You are just overreacting again! I'm just trying to make you understand that it's not so – "
Hermione gave Harry an apologetic smile. "She'll forgive you some day", she said.
He waited for his breath to become steady again, just lying there for a long time. Finally, since he nowadays was already quite good at wandless magic, he started whispering the cleaning charm. Soon his body was fully clean of his cum.
"Well,
He paused again, smiling at his gorgeous looking soon-to-be-husband.
"Well then", Harry said. "Let's race, shall we?"
He was
He could still feel cold shivers running through his body, however. Shit, this was so crazy… He didn't know what to think anymore. He had just masturbated and, instead of thinking about Ginny, the girl who he was still in a relationship with, he had been thinking about having wild sex with his former rival. And still, he had a smile on his face…
Harry, feeling very embarrassed now, gave a slow nod.
"Night", he said quietly, walking to the door of the bedroom he shared with Theodore, not turning to look at him again.
"I don't get it. Why do those muggles let other people watch their intimate stuff?" he asked.
"Next time I'm the one who kicks your ass", he finally said after Malfoy had returned the Snitch to him.
"How is that possible?"
When their lips finally parted, Draco's eyes were looking deep into Harry's soul again. "Harry, I love you. I love you so fucking much", he whispered against his lips.
Malfoy asked in a teasing way.
He saw both of his friends watching him.
Harry's eyes flew wide open. "What?!" he grunted. He was all sweaty and his heart was pounding so fast…
"And get yourself and your family killed", Harry pointed out. "Come on, Malfoy. We've already talked about this weeks ago."
deserved...
"Yeah", the Slytherin answered, his hand already travelling down along Harry's body.
in Malfoy's eyes... what was it? He had no idea about that but oh Merlin how much he wanted to grab the man right now, kiss him and... Wait a minute. Did he just see Malfoy quickly glance at his lips? Or was he just imagining things again, just like he always was? This was getting ridiculous. Just because Harry was a mess himself and horny for Malfoy, it didn't automatically mean that the Slytherin felt the same way about him. He was pathetic for even thinking about that...
Soon it was time for Harry to walk down and meet Draco and his father there. He and Lucius glanced at each other very quickly before Lucius passed Draco to him and went to sit to the remaining empty seat next to his wife. Harry and Draco exchanged loving smiles with one another before Harry took Draco's arm with his own, and they kept walking together.
"Well, that's good to hear", Ron said slowly. "What have you been up to?"
. He had never wanted anything else like he wanted this man.
Draco glanced behind him, seeing that Harry had finally taken off his own underpants as well, and was now lubing himself up. The sight was fucking hot and Draco couldn't wait to get Harry's big cock inside him.
Harry immediately turned his attention towards Malfoy who was back to staring at the flames again. "Why are you being an arse to him again?" he asked.
All three of them turned to glance at Draco who was already walking towards them. He’d just come back home after visiting his father in Azkaban.
"Potter…"
From the first touch of their lips Harry knew he was hooked. He had never felt anything like this before, not with Cho, not with Ginny. No, this was how it was
They both gasped as Harry slowly pushed inside, and Draco closed his eyes. Good lord how he had missed this.
"So you're still angry at them?" Goyle asked shamelessly.
The next five minutes they gained lots of handshakes, hugs and warm wishes. Everyone wanted to congratulate them.
The only thing that seemed to have come as a shock to the Slytherin was the lack of house-elves.
"Hi", Harry said back, a gentle smile on his lips. "How's Lucius?"
Malfoy was still avoiding eye contact, just staring at the books. "I… promised to go with Theo already", he admitted quietly.
Ginny was the opposite. She was beautiful and very social and because of that she had already dated several guys before him. Harry had only ever kissed Cho and Ginny, that was all the experience he had. He’d been too busy with defeating Voldemort and various other stuff. Even Ron had more experience with girls than he did, now that he was dating Hermione. Harry did want to have sex, of course, but tonight wasn't the right time for that.
Ginny tossed her book angrily at the floor, getting up. Harry, still sitting in his chair, first gazed at the book thrown at the floor and then turned to look at his girlfriend.
Harry's Christmas day was very different from any of his earlier ones.
Harry pressed their lips together, giving the blond a passionate kiss before starting to move inside him.
"Yeah", Harry mumbled back, absentmindedly running his hand through his messy hair.
When Greg opened the door and let Draco in his flat next afternoon, Draco could tell that the man immediately saw that something was terribly wrong.
Harry's dominating tone was making Draco furious. He instantly stopped walking and turned around, staring at the other man venomously.
"Uh... I guess... very well", Harry answered, his gaze stuck on his fingers holding the coffee cup. He was feeling very uneasy. "We... haven't had any problems getting along... uh... Everything's been... great..."
Fortunately Malfoy still had other people to hang out with. Mostly he spent his free time with Goyle but sometimes with other Slytherins as well, or Harry. And sometimes he just wanted to be alone, withdrawing to his own room for hours without a word to anyone.
"What took you so long?" the Slytherin asked him, looking bored.
, and like that wasn't already bad enough, you've been doing it with
"Yeah right", Malfoy sneered coldly. "You're the saviour of the Wizarding World and I am an ex-Death Eater. I can put two and two together without you having to spell it out for me."
"I couldn't agree more", Harry said and they both smirked, tightening their grips around each other's bodies.
"Unlike mine", Draco added.
Draco's eyes widened in surprise and a gasp escaped his lips as he was next pushed hard on his back on their bed. Harry followed him right after, placing himself on top of Draco with a sly smile on his face.
He broke the eye contact and turned towards the TV screen again. He knew he'd have to talk about his feelings sooner or later... but not tonight. He would do it
The Slytherin was standing by the sink, back turned towards him.
It didn't take more than few seconds before Harry was already on top of him, all ready. "Ready?" he asked him, smiling.
"Clubbing?!"
Hesitating, Harry walked to the couch, slumping down next to the other man. Neither of them said a word for a while. Harry was watching the flames dancing in the fireplace in front of them.
"Where my parents got killed and I got this scar. It was Halloween 1981."
"Oh...", Harry said, lowering his gaze to the floor. "I thought you had... I thought you already knew what was going on without me talking to you about it as well... I didn't want to bother you with my work, didn't want you to... God... Not even this morning's Prophet...?"
He didn't sleep well that night. He kept on tossing and turning, trying to think of Ginny, but instead all he could think about was Malfoy and all the conversations of that day. He hadn't seen the blond after they had separated at the lake, but he knew that sooner or later Malfoy must have gone to sleep in his room. The room that he shared with Theodore.
"I wasn't worried", Harry answered. "Theodore is. He's been looking around for you everywhere."
"I'm so sorry for punching you", Draco breathed against his lips when they finally had to take a breath. "But seeing you kissing her again... not only once but twice... You have
When Harry reached the Quidditch Pitch later that morning, Malfoy was already waiting for him there, leaning on his broomstick.
In the back of the library he saw a glimpse of platinum blond hair. Harry's steps slowed down immediately and soon he found himself turning around, heading to that direction. He was sure that it was Malfoy. And yes, he was right. The Slytherin was standing there in between the two bookshelves, back towards him, facing the window. Harry noticed that he had a book on his hand but he was not looking at it at the moment. Instead he was clearly staring out of the window, though Harry couldn't see his face.
"Draco, you're his only son", Narcissa said confidently, smiling. "It will take time, but he will learn to understand." She was quiet for a while until she continued, a little unsure: "And, as for children... there are ways for two men and women to have a child as well, in case you haven't heard. You are two wizards after all. In case someday you two would want to be parents, of course."
Malfoy let out another sob and Harry simply kept stroking the blond's hair. "Shh… It's okay", he found himself whispering. "Please, don't cry… Everything's okay…"
"You were only one year old...", Draco murmured.
"Really? On a Friday evening?" Harry asked doubtfully.
Before Harry even managed to thank her, she had already turned around and left without bothering to say anything to Draco. Harry could see her walking to her parents, crying. Arthur placed his hand on his daughter's shoulder.
Harry quickly detached himself off his girlfriend, taking a seat on the edge of the bed, back turned towards her.
one, here..?"
nothing more.
, after years of waiting, he had gotten him... and this was all that he was going to get?
They even visited a muggle night club one night. At first Draco kept nagging because it was so crowded and noisy there, but the more alcohol they ingested the more the Slytherin seemed to enjoy himself, and so did Harry - at first. There were lots of good looking, stylish young people in the club, but still the only person he kept admiring was Draco.
They were soon rolling on the floor, trying to hit and kick each other as much as they could, groaning and cursing loudly.
Draco really knew that he should have let Ginny Weasley's words to go in one ear and out the other. After all, she hated Draco's guts, she always had, and even more so after Draco had practically stolen her boyfriend during their last year at Hogwarts.
"Why on earth would I dream about stuff like
Just no.
Harry shook his head, their eyes locked.
not some puppet on a string, and no one had a right to treat him this way! He would get back at Harry for making him suffer like this.
He owned Draco Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy owned him, and he never wanted to give up this man.
The next time Harry woke up, it was 9am.
"Right", Malfoy said tonelessly. He sat down on the grass, resting his back against the large tree behind them. He didn't say a word anymore. Harry was eyeing him for few seconds before he decided to do the same thing. He landed next to Malfoy and they sat there in silence for a good while, just staring into distance.
"Yeah", Ron said, staring at the fireplace. "Blimey, it will be fun to finally see their new Keeper in real action…"
"They will. Ginny's worked really hard for the team", Harry commented.
Harry trembled, turning towards the bed again at the whisper. Malfoy had turned on his back and was now staring at him, rubbing his eye.
It was midday when Harry finally woke up. He opened his eyes slowly, seeing the most beautiful sight in the world in front of him and a gentle smile immediately rose to his lips.
Malfoy sighed, slowly turning to look at him. "Why are you talking to me?" he asked back, sounding pissed.
"Yes, I was!" Harry immediately snarled back. "I was afraid that something terrible had happened to you, it was killing me, and you just went… clubbing!" His whole body was shaking now and tears were openly falling down his cheeks.
Also, thinking of the coming holiday and having to spend it all alone felt devastating. Well, he knew that Ron and Hermione would be offering to spend part of it with him... but it didn't cheer him up at all. No, his winter break would be very lonely and depressing, there was no denying it.
Malfoy now had a new book in his hands. Having finally found what he was looking for, he turned around, returned to his chair and started to read again, not once looking in Harry's direction. Harry turned to stare at the ceiling.
"You're staying here for Christmas
Harry gave him a quick glare, but he didn't look angry anymore, not really. "You ruthless, devious Slytherins", he snorted. "I should have known."
Malfoy turned his back on Theodore again. "Well, now you know. No need for you to worry."
"Really", Draco said with a nod. "I just wanted you to think that I had been with someone else. I wanted to hurt you, because you hurt me first."
Malfoy was still so quiet that Harry thought the Slytherin had already fallen asleep in his arms. Then, finally, after a while of silence he heard Malfoy say tiredly: "Right... Why do you think I didn't want to go all the way with you tonight? I
Harry really liked spending his free time with his girlfriend but there was also a but. Since Ginny still couldn't stand Malfoy and Ginny was with Harry most of the time, he didn't really get a chance to spend time with the Slytherin at all. And it bothered him. The slow bonding that had been happening earlier between him and Malfoy had brought something
"No problem", Harry reassured quickly because he noticed how difficult this must be for Malfoy. They had always hated each other, after all. "I don't mind."
Ginny had always had such a fiery, temperamental nature. That was probably one of the biggest reasons Harry had fallen in love with her in the first place. There had been so much passion between them straight from the beginning of their relationship – even though they hadn’t actually even had sex yet. Then again, Harry himself was a fiery person too so there was a downside: their arguments often became very nasty.
Harry soon added another finger and started twisting his fingers inside Draco, the other man shivering and gasping under him as he prepared him the best way he could.
"She already left", Hermione explained. "She probably went back to sleep, she looked tired."
He stayed at the bar counter for a while, just sipping his beer with his back turned to his party. He had already been drinking quite many drinks tonight so he was starting to feel the effect of the alcohol, but he wanted to be drunk to survive through the night. He needed to be able to relax, he needed to act casually and alcohol helped with that a bit. There were all too many thoughts going through his mind...
"Maybe not now, but what about earlier?" Harry said. "And even if you hadn't, your father would have done it for you. It was much better this way." He could still feel Malfoy's eyes on him. "But, like I said, I guess the Sorting Hat was right. Thinking about my personality now and the way I've messed everything up and used people without thinking any further... I would have done well with you guys."
Harry's mouth dropped. Had he heard right? "The
Ginny gave a slow nod. "Yeah?"
"The date was fine. I had fun with him as long as we stayed at Hogsmeade. However, when we were back at school, we ended up kissing and..." Draco sighed heavily. "It wasn't enough for him. He wanted to take things even further, but I just couldn't. I couldn't stop thinking about you. Of course, Theo got so mad and... let's just say that he totally gave me a piece of his mind. He told me how pathetic I am and how I'm going to waste my whole fucking life drooling over a big headed straight man who only cares about fame and would never give a shit about me and... In the end it got very personal. I don't even want to tell you all the things he said to me that night."
"Nothing", Harry murmured, moving his hands to gently caress the sides of his upper body with his fingers. "I was just thinking... We both have something to make up for to each other, don't we...?" He moved his face closer to Draco's and Draco chuckled at the feeling of the other man's short stubble tickling against his skin. "And I have an idea how we could set things right", Harry continued by whispering against Draco's ear.
"If you want an answer, you have to say it", Harry said dryly.
Hermione's cheeks reddened a bit. "They are so close and... Theo's quite a good looking guy... No, let's admit it. He's a
It just didn't make any sense to him at all. He was The Boy Who Lived… but that was all he was.
"He is
. "Malf-"
Draco's smile widened. "Oh, right... I had already forgotten...", he said, before adding: "You know, I've always gotten what I've wanted... but this must be the best Christmas present I've ever had."
Harry had to admit that Malfoy's words hurt him. So Malfoy had barely noticed that they weren't talking or spending time together anymore. Harry was
His lips were trembling and his voice was cracking.
"Come again?" he asked, mouth slightly open.

Harry sighed. "She was furious", he muttered, lowering his gaze to his feet. "I had promised to meet her yesterday and I didn't. I kind of forgot, so..."
be your new roommate", Goyle answered.
A tiny, sad smile appeared on Malfoy's lips. "Welcome to the club", he muttered, turning towards the flames again.
Harry, Ron and Hermione had almost finished eating dinner in the Great Hall, when they were suddenly accompanied by Ginny, taking a seat right next to Harry so that their bodies were touching.
"Gosh, just... just fuck off already, will you", Harry snorted, shaking his head. Instead of being angry, he was actually turned on and it was definitely not a good thing to happen right now. Thank Merlin he was still wearing his school robes so his slowly growing erection wouldn't probably be so easy to spot.
"Ron!" Hermione tried again.
Harry found Draco in the dining room, reading Daily Prophet and drinking tea.
"Well, you better, or else -"
"Fine. You know what, Draco? Do whatever you want", Theodore grunted. "I don't give a shit." He left the room, giving Harry a loathsome glare before slamming the door shut after him. Harry didn't know what to think.
"That's enough for me", Harry said, smiling back.
"Well", Harry murmured, his voice soft and low. "What would you say if..." His lips started pressing very light kisses against the very sensitive skin of Draco's neck, and Draco immediately felt shivers coursing through his body. Oh Salazar how much he had missed Harry's touch against his skin... "...I apparated us to our bedroom...", Harry continued, moving his other hand lower along Draco's back. "...ripped those excruciatingly sexy clothes off you..." Draco's stomach was tingling. "...touched and kissed your naked body, everywhere..." Harry nibbed at Draco's earlobe and another shiver ran through his spine. His pants were slowly starting to feel a little too tight. "....tasted you in every way possible...", Harry continued, his grip tightening around him, and a weak gasp escaped Draco's lips. Oh god... "...and finally..." Harry paused for a while, and Draco's heart was hammering in his chest. He was all too eager to hear the rest. "...gave you one hell of a ride that you will never forget."
Harry was very aware of the fact that Malfoy's body was very close to his own, and though they weren't face to face, of course, it was still enough for Harry to feel a little awkward. Malfoy on the other hand didn't seem to care at all. His face was still expressionless, mouth a strict, thin line.
"And you listened to her", Harry cut his sentence off, sighing in frustration. "I can't believe you would believe a word she is saying!"
"I've already said yes", Draco said, a small, confused smile on his lips.
”Oh, right... Just take it”, Harry said, closing the book. He was absentmindedly stroking his messy hair with his fingers, and once again made a quick glance to his right. Ron slowly took back the book and started flipping the pages.
Having finished laughing, Harry became serious again. "Umm… Malfoy", he said, gaining the other man's attention immediately.
Theodore had a wistful look on his face. "I just woke up and I was wondering where you were…", he said quietly.
Malfoy was staring at him for a while, mouth slightly open, their eyes meeting. Then he turned towards the books again, pushing the book he had been holding back to the shelf. "I… can't tonight", he finally said with a very weird look on his pale face. He was avoiding looking at Harry again.
It was almost 3am when Malfoy finally told Harry that he was tired. Harry himself had been tired for a while already, but he'd wanted to listen to Malfoy for as long as he wanted to talk. Besides, it was Sunday and Harry could sleep as late as he wanted to.
"You've always had a hero complex", Draco commented with a smirk.
"Well, how does it taste like?" he finally asked as Draco had already devoured over half of the food on his plate.
"Seriously?"
. The blond kept falling on the ice all the time, cursing loudly, and in the end the other man got so frustrated and angry that he yanked the skates off his feet and slammed them violently to the ground, storming away. Harry, not knowing whether to laugh or not, followed the Slytherin, telling him that it wasn't so serious and he should try to take it with humour. From the glare the other man gave him, he knew that ice-skating would definitely not be their shared hobby in the future.
People in the hall had stood up and were loudly cheering for them.
His eyes followed Malfoy at their shared Potions class where they were brewing the antidote to a garish pink blended poison. Malfoy's long, thin fingers were rigorously peeling and cutting all the needed ingredients and his face was perfectly focused, and Harry found himself admiring the Slytherin's skills and tranquility. As for Harry himself, his focus being directed to totally wrong thing, he managed to completely ruin his own antidote. Professor Slughorn gave him a slightly disappointed look after the class was dismissed, but Harry left it unnoticed. His eyes were – once again – on Malfoy, who was already departing with Theodore by his side.
After they had finished eating and drinking and Harry had paid their pricey bill, they headed out and just walked in the chilly Christmas night, looking at the beautiful Christmas lights and listening as some children were singing Christmas songs. They were both a little drunk and walking hand in hand, and it felt so right that at that moment Harry didn't even care if someone could see them. Of course he was still feeling a little worried about what the Daily Prophet would write about him and Draco when it’d come out, but sooner or later it would have to happen anyway. Draco Malfoy was the one Harry wanted and he would not lose the man because of being ashamed of him. His reputation would definitely come crashing down after the revelation, but it would be worth it. He was tired of living how other people wanted him to. He wanted to start living the life the way
"Yeah. You can watch all sort of stuff with it. News, movies, TV shows, documentaries..." He knew from Draco's expression that the other man didn't have the slightest idea what Harry was talking about. "My cousin used to have three of these and I always wanted one of my own as well. And now I finally have one." He let out a short laugh before gesturing at the couch for Draco to join him. "Join me?"
However, the worst thing was that even though Harry was embarrassed about the incident, he didn't regret it. He had
"Ron, stop that. You're awful", Hermione said, shaking his head.
There was some loud knocking on the door and they both jumped, quickly pulling away from each other.
Goyle gave Malfoy a questioning look before he too saw where Malfoy was looking at.
, Potter."
she raged, shaking with anger.
With a very quick glance, Harry could see that Hermione had buried her face in her handkerchief again, and the same thing was happening to Draco's mom as well.
Very soon they already walked to the counter, not so far from Harry.
"I'm so sorry, Ginny. I never wanted to hurt you", Harry said sadly. "I just..." He couldn't find the right words to say.
The match was very even but finally, almost two hours later, Gryffindor caught the Snitch and beat Ravenclaw. Hermione and Ron were screaming so loudly that Harry was almost certain he might become deaf. Malfoy, instead, was still complaining and rolling his eyes, but Harry saw a tiny smile appear on his lips as their eyes met.
life..." He took a bite of his chocolate biscuit, crunching it before adding: "Ginny will be heartbroken, of course."
"Uh... yeah...", Harry mumbled, feeling embarrassed. He quickly checked that his lower body was under the blanket so that Ron wouldn't see his erection.
"I know", Harry sighed. "But I still think she's seriously overreacting."
Harry gazed at the blond who was still staring at the lake with no emotion whatsoever showing on his pale face.
"You want it?" Harry made sure, teasing him by rubbing their crotches lightly together.
"Well...", Hermione started, letting out a little, nervous laugh. "Please don't get mad at me, Harry." Harry shook his head and Hermione continued: "I was almost sure that you're like… in love with him or something."
"There you are", Harry said.
Narcissa Malfoy shook her head, turning her eyes towards Harry instead. Harry gulped under Draco's mum's gaze.
Malfoy and Goyle were looking at each other now, exchanging words so quietly that Harry couldn't hear a word they were saying. Finally, after a while, Malfoy turned towards them.
Malfoy didn't say anything. He just kept resting his head against Harry's chest, letting out a heavy sigh, and another silence fell over them.
now... and last night... he didn't even... he didn't even come home anymore!" He burst out crying loudly again.
Draco was eyeing him closely, reading his face. "You didn't tell them", he finally said, the tiny smile on his face quickly fading away.
Harry was staring at him with his teary eyes, looking like he had no clue what Draco was talking about.
"Guess what?" Malfoy suddenly whispered against his lips.
Malfoy's words sent electricity up along Harry's spine. "Oh... yeah?" he gasped, flashing a confused grin to the blond.
"I guess so", Harry answered with a shrug. "Just have to check that there isn't any quidditch practise though." He was still perplexed by Malfoy's suggestion. Were they really going to spend the Sunday morning together?
Harry startled, cheeks flushing, quickly tearing his gaze off the Slytherin. There he had been, slowly, attentively,
Malfoy was staring straight ahead, simply concentrating on walking. Harry tried to concentrate too but he just couldn't. His heart was thumping madly in his chest and all he really wanted to do right now was to grab Malfoy by his shoulders and press him against the nearest wall. He wanted to smell his skin, to kiss him hard, to rip his clothes off...
Harry turned to glance at Hermione, who was now smiling. Harry only flashed back a very uneasy grin, returning back to his drink again.
furnishing?" he sneered, shaking his head.
of all people have been able to forgive him, I think we all should act like adults and do that too."
He decided to lie down on the sofa, closing his eyes, thinking. He knew what Ginny wanted, but Harry hadn't had sex with anyone yet.
"Keep your hands off me", Draco hissed. "How dare you lie to me, and even question where I've spent my night at after spending a whole night out fucking somebody else!" He burst out crying loudly.
"You have to promise me that you won't tell anyone what happened", he finally continued under Malfoy's intense glare. "I don't want to end up on the front page of the Daily Prophet because of this."
Harry rolled next to Draco and soon they were lying in each others arms, all sweaty, both breathing shakily and their bodies shuddering, their fingers entwined tightly.
checking Malfoy out, and got caught red-handed by the man himself. He could still feel Malfoy's eyes on him.
anymore. Professor Snape, the former Potions professor, had hated him and it had affected his grades a lot... But now, when there was professor Slughorn teaching, it was different. He really had gotten better at Potions.
in your life?" he added.
Harry hesitated for a while.
"What kind of person do you think I am?!" Harry snapped.
"Uh... Nothing", Harry said quickly.
"Well, kind of", Harry answered. "It's their job. They make quite a lot of money of it."
he snapped. "I
Malfoy gave him a nasty look but didn't say anything.
"What? No, of course not!" Harry answered quickly. "But I did smash the table and… uh… Ginny left and said I'm a… nutcase."
"Merlin, Harry", she said with tears of happiness in her brown eyes. "What a ceremony. It was so
The school week was really rough but finally Saturday arrived. Harry spent most of the day at Hogsmeade with Ginny. They had a really good time together shopping, eating, drinking and of course snuggling, and Harry was feeling totally relaxed.
That night Harry dreamed about Draco Malfoy again.
become a professional player if she wanted to!"
"For goodness sake, Potter, would you mind not to scare me like that", Malfoy hissed, swiping his blond hair from his forehead where it had fallen. He turned towards the bookshelf, sideways to Harry, not looking at him.
Harry smiled. "Yes", he answered. "If we stay very close to each other." Malfoy didn't say anything. "I've used it with both Ron and Hermione all the time", Harry continued. "And with Ginny of course."
He had initially planned not to tell his friends at all but had come to have second thoughts about it.
"I loved it", Harry answered honestly. "It was incredible."
Harry felt sick, sick of himself... He had never realized that his Sectumsempra-curse had caused that much damage. He remembered Malfoy's words from early November night:
be faithful", he said. "I will
Later that day they were sitting in their new common room, relaxing. They had been doing their homework almost all day and evening and finally they were ready. They were the only ones there, plus Ginny, Harry's arm around her. She’d wanted to visit after dinner.
They were just standing there and glaring at each other for a long time, until suddenly Malfoy's mask broke down, and Harry was shocked when he saw Malfoy burst into silent tears in front of him. What the hell..? He had not expected anything like this to happen. He had noticed that Malfoy was in a really bad mood but why was he crying..? Before he even realized, he had already put his hand to Malfoy's shoulder.
Malfoy took a sip from his own drink, watching Harry from the corner of his eye with a bit of a haughty look on his face. Then he turned around, gaze traveling through the pub. "Where's Weasley?" he asked.
"I haven't thought about it a lot either", Harry said. "But if it
Malfoy sighed angrily, pulling up the sleeves of his left arm in frustration, showing it at Harry. Harry was staring at his arm for a good while. The Dark Mark had faded to a huge, ugly scar in Malfoy's inner forearm after Harry had defeated Voldemort, but it was still definitely there.
He had wanted to ask Malfoy about his relationship with Theodore the whole night, but he hadn't yet. Maybe now was finally a good time for that.
Harry didn't answer anymore. He knew he wasn't great at Potions but he didn't suck at it
left their room.
to Malfoy?!
"Harry...", Draco soon groaned.
He stopped when he saw the warning look on Malfoy's face. He suddenly realized that Malfoy probably hadn't told Goyle about Theodore and obviously didn't want him to hear about it now either.
you fucking -"
to me!"
Harry gave a bleak laugh. "I don't even know where to start", he said.
Ginny didn't even bother answering to him. She resumed her path with her friend without another word, leaving the library.
"Oh", Harry said, raising his eyebrow, observing Malfoy. The Slytherin looked quite tense right now. "Why not", he finally answered. "I don't have any plans yet, so…"
day, you know", Harry said carefully.
"There's just one thing I've been wondering...", Harry said after a while, hesitating. "Draco... How do you know so much about sex? You told me you haven't had any experience before..."
instead."
It was already clear to Harry that he and Ginny had never been meant to be together for the rest of their lives. He obviously still cared about Ginny a lot... but only as a friend. He had only been doing what everyone expected of him. He still wished to get married some day, but Ginny wouldn't be the other party.
"Yeah, right", Harry teased, but after seeing the sulky look on Malfoy's face he quickly added: "I won't tell anyone, though. I promise." He passed his hand towards the other man. "Let's shake on it."
"Of course. Who else would I be talking to?" Hermione replied.
"Malfoy..." he started but couldn't find the right words.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know. They just do", he said. "Not my first choice, though."
"Nah, just forget about it", Harry said, writing another sentence with his quill. He could feel Malfoy staring at him the whole time.
"Nah, it's nothing important. It can wait", Harry said, opening the door. "Night."
Harry let out a heavy sigh, finally nodding slowly. "I... really am sorry", he whispered.
"Don't pay any attention about what others say about you. Just ignore them. They don't know the real you."

Harry didn't get it. Were they
Harry didn't answer. They were both staring at the open page that had two pictures of Harry and his red-haired girlfriend.
If you really cared about me you wouldn't have done this to me!" Ginny sobbed.
"Away from you and your lies", Draco hissed. He was trying to remain strong, but his mask was slowly starting to break. "I can't believe I let myself be
"So are you", Draco replied, moaning loudly as Harry hit the right spot inside him. "Aah! So -
"Me too", Draco said with a groan, pulling Harry in for a passionate kiss.
"Seriously, if he
Another silence fell over and Harry got up, stretching a bit. From the corner of his eye he saw Malfoy also getting up, grab his schoolcase and the book he had been reading, heading towards the corridor leading to their rooms without another word to him. Harry followed him soon after.
They were meant for… him.
Harry sighed. Ginny had reacted just like he had imagined she would. Her friends immediately started whispering to each others as Harry continued his walk along the hall, finally taking a seat opposite of Ron and Hermione. Hermione gave him an apologetic smile after seeing the look on his face.
Harry was staring at him for a good while in deep silence, his already naturally big emerald green eyes wider than ever, still pretending to not have a clue about what he was talking about.
A moan escaped Draco's lips as Harry lowered his head and started to tease the head of his cock with his swift, talented tongue. God but Draco loved it. Harry really, really knew how to use that tongue, and he really knew how to drive Draco absolutely crazy.
Draco, however, just grinned. "Don't be sorry." He grabbed the towel Harry had thrown at him. "It's only good to get used to it..." He winked.
"Where the hell
Malfoy offering Harry his help came as a surprise to him. It really seemed like they were friends now and the realization made his lips turn to a tiny smile. "Nah... No need to", he finally muttered without turning around, still writing. "I can manage on my own, but thanks anyway..."
"Do you love her?"
He heard Harry's voice shaking and opened his eyes, seeing the other man's eyelids closing as he came hard inside Draco, crying out his name again. Draco came in his hand only few seconds later, screaming, his cum spurting in between their bodies.
Ron was astounded. He just stared at his girlfriend for a while, before turning towards Harry. "Can you believe what she just said?!" he asked, amused.
"Y-yeah", Harry said quietly. He was suddenly feeling very stupid to be standing there, in Draco Malfoy's bedroom, in the middle of the night.
"So they're back to being friends", Harry blurted out after few minutes had already passed. He wasn't able to concentrate on anything else though he really had tried.
had Theodore
Harry's gaze followed as Malfoy, who was still breathing very heavily, slowly rose to sit down on the bed, took his wand from the night stand and started muttering the cleaning spell, pointing first at his palm and next at each of their bellies. Having soon cleaned everything up, the Slytherin quickly put his wand back, falling back to bed right next to Harry.
Hermione gave him a withering look. "I don't believe you. You're just making it all up because you still hate him", she said after coming closer, the tone of her whispering sounding quite angry.
That silky looking platinum hair, skin as pale as the moon, his skinny body, those perfect lips waiting to be kissed…
"You wouldn't ruin it, Draco", Harry had said warmly, still smiling. "I've seen you at Potions class. You're always so precise and diligent."
"Sorry I'm late!" she quickly apologized to Harry, giving him a kiss. "I saw Luna and-"
"Wannagosomewhere?" Harry found himself asking so quickly it got out in a jumble of words.
"Uh... Not really...", he heard Malfoy answer from the corridor. "You?"
, whatever. Harry had really, really wanted that before but now when he thought about it, he knew he didn't anymore. It didn't feel like the right thing to do, not after everything that had happened lately. All those arguments with his girlfriend, Ginny's behaviour, his lack of interest towards her… and not to forget the
Hermione quickly glanced behind her where her boyfriend was babbling about Extendable ears at the moment, his cheeks red because of the alcohol. Goyle and Malfoy were listening to him with raised eyebrows. Hermione turned back to Harry, leaning a little bit closer.
There were lots of questions running through Harry's mind. Why did Malfoy have to be a dick? Was it really true that he wasn't gay or did Malfoy actually have feelings for Theodore and he was just afraid of admitting it?
, really? How hot was that! There was a familiar, fiery look in the Slytherin's eyes again.
Harry tried to get up and grab the other man, but the Slytherin punched him hard in the face with his fist. Harry groaned in pain, falling backwards again. The pain was terrible, and with blurry eyes he saw Draco looking at him with tears flowing along his face before storming away, soon followed by Goyle who flashed a loathing glare at Harry as he went.
"But you promised to tell them
Harry had no idea what to answer. There was
Dray. This is like a dream..."
Ron asked, a weird look on his face.
"Congratulations", Harry heard Hermione say to Draco as well, before he himself was already hugged by George Weasley next.
Mostly they went out for coffee. There was this small, cozy muggle coffee bar near Harry's home where they sold delicious pastries and
The Slytherin did as told, turning around to lie on his back instead. Harry immediately crawled on top of him, positioning himself in between Draco's long legs. His erection was soon pressed against the entrance, ready for the action.
"Listen. I also made a promise that we're not going to talk about his personal business anymore, so if you don't mind...", he said, giving them a meaningful look. They both nodded.
"Oh yeah, say my name", Draco answered, his voice filled with lust. "I'm gonna fuck you so fucking hard,
One evening after paying a visit to Hagrid, Harry was walking back towards the castle to have some dinner... and that was when he saw him. The blond Slytherin was walking along the lakefront with slow pace, hands deep in his pockets, head bowed down. Why wasn't Malfoy at dinner?
Malfoy, who was still wearing his long black coat was… crying. His body was shaking as tears were flowing out of his tightly closed eyes.
"I could stay here, you know", she said casually. Harry shifted, turning to look at his girlfriend. There was a suggestive expression on her beautiful face. "Would you like that, Harry?"
Harry, feeling very confused, had to finally ask the question he had been wondering for weeks. "What about Theodore? You went on a date with him, didn't you? The night when you came back crying."
Later that day Harry cooked another dinner for them. Once again Draco ate everything till the last crumb and Harry smiled by himself. It seemed that he wasn't so bad of a cook at all, after all, since his food was good enough for Draco Malfoy of all people. Well, he had been forced to cook a lot for Dursley's and do all kinds of other housework, so that explained something.
"Really?" Harry asked, looking very relieved.
Harry was about to answer him, but the moment he had opened his mouth to speak, the huge doors at the back of the hall opened. Goyle, Draco's best man, came through the door first, walking slowly to Harry and Ron. They exchanged slow nods as Goyle took his own place.
"You do?" Draco asked, smiling back.
As if that weren’t not enough already, Theodore was not the only one whose eyes were directed at Harry. After lifting his gaze, his green eyes immediately locked with Hermione's brown ones. Startling again, Harry quickly broke the eye contact with her too, trying to continue his eating. He was silently cursing in his mind. Damn it, this would have to stop. He would really have to stop staring at Malfoy this much.
"I wasn't playing with you!" Harry said desperately. "You must believe me!"
"Uh... why not", Harry sighed absent-mindedly, resting his face against his palm. His gaze was glued to the Slytherin table where he saw Malfoy sitting with Goyle, the two of them having an intense conversation together. His head felt like exploding by any minute. Almost having kissed Malfoy, Ginny wanting to sleep with him… What the hell was he supposed to do?
"I'm not going anywhere", Harry said, shaking his head.
"I know we're not friends", Harry said. "It's just weird that you're hiding from him all of a sudden."
"So it seems", Harry answered, flashing a very tiny smile to the blond.
"Well, I was just thinking… Maybe we could do something together then?" Ginny asked.
Malfoy leaned back again in his chair, grinning widely. Harry had never been so glad to see Ginny walking towards them as he was now.
"She's at the common room", she announced before leaving.
The Slytherin had smiled back at Harry and just stood there the whole time, just watching as he prepared their dinner from beginning to end.
Few hours later Harry and Ron were chilling together at the common room, first playing some chess and later just sitting and relaxing on the couch. Almost everyone else had already left for Hogsmeade tonight.
The other man was looking at him confused, a tiny blush rising to his cheeks.
"Ginny", he said, putting his hand on her girlfriend's shoulder. She turned to face him, brown eyes flaring.
Malfoy gave him a sad smile. "That's because no one knows. I haven't told anyone. Except Greg. I tell him almost everything", he said. "And the people at the hospital know of course. She's been there for a week now."
"Yeah, I know", Draco said with another sigh. "But I can't answer your question yet. I've never even thought about it before, so..."
right?!"
Days passed and things went even worse between them.
, Malfoy immediately silenced him. "What's done is done." He turned around and walked past Harry to his bed, sitting on it. "Now, if you don't mind, I'm tired as hell and I really need to sleep", he said, avoiding looking at him.
" He noticed a riled up tone in her voice though she was still trying to stay calm.
His eyes were resting on Malfoy who was now walking towards the portrait door together with Theodore. His platinum hair was gorgeously styled and he was wearing a long sleeved, dark green dress shirt and tight, black trousers and he was pulling his long, black, cloak-like winter coat on as he was walking. Harry couldn't keep his eyes off him. He was totally captivated by the blond's undeniable sexiness. He was pretty sure he could even smell the beautiful, familiar scent of Malfoy's cologne again… Merlin.
been spreading any rumours about you or him to others", he hurried to say. "I
"I should go find Ron and Hermione", Harry stated and glanced at the Slytherin, seeing a sudden, sullen look on his face. "What?" Harry asked.
Harry froze. He turned to look at his friend, pretending to be calm when in fact he was everything but.
He found his underpants from the floor next to the bed, starting to pull them on. He could feel Malfoy's eyes lingering on him.
a nightmare.
like you?!" he snapped, hands clenched into fists.
"She's not dying", Malfoy answered quietly, hesitating for a while before continuing: "She's... sick in the head. Mentally ill... Whatever you wanna call it. She's not safe alone."
"Malfoy... Are you and Theodore...", he started after a few minutes of silence, not looking at the other man. The thought was still bothering him somehow.
"You know... I could check your essay if you want me to", Harry suddenly heard him suggest out of the blue.
Harry had never felt so guilty in his entire life. He hated to see Ginny's heart breaking in front of his eyes, he hated to see her world falling apart... and it was all his fault. He should have broken up with her a long time ago, way before starting to fool around with Draco. He had completely destroyed Ginny, not caring about her feelings at all. He had been so selfish.
"I just needed to get some fresh air", Harry explained to his friends. "And a drink, so I ended up in Hog's Head."
Harry nodded slowly. "Yeah, it was wrong…" He sighed, silence falling over them. They were just sitting there, both in their thoughts, until Hermione spoke again.
"There isn't", Malfoy said. "We were both wasted and horny, and one thing led to another. That's all it was." He didn't look at Harry anymore.
Malfoy finally turned to look at him. "You think she's going to break up with you?"
"There are many channels?" the Slytherin asked, raising his eyebrow.
Harry scowled at the Slytherin. "I
to take his side after what he's just done to Draco!" he hissed.
Ginny's whole body was trembling and tears were now flowing out of her eyes openly. She looked totally wrecked. "How could you fall in love with
"So you haven't been...", Draco finally spoke, incredulously. "There isn't anyone...?"
There were both pros and cons in Harry's new friendship with Malfoy, of course. Harry really liked spending time with him, and they actually did have quite a few things in common which had come as a big surprise for Harry. Also, they both had a bad sense of humor, so they were laughing together a lot, sometimes almost choking of laughter. But, of course, they were still nagging and arguing with each other a lot too just like they had always done, that hadn't changed. However, most of the time they got along surprisingly well.
don't tell me more. I don't want to hear, mate", Ron groaned, covering his ears with his hands.
His lips finally turned to a smile as he remembered something. Uncle Vernon had once taken Petunia to a restaurant for Christmas dinner without Harry and Dudley when Harry had been 9 years old. For the first time in his life he was glad that he had lived with the Dursley's. He would take Draco to a muggle restaurant for Christmas dinner. Yeah, that would definitely do.
"Hi", Malfoy answered icily, quickly breaking the eye contact.
"You mean like... best friends?" Harry asked, giving a short laugh. "
"Okay", Harry said, smiling. "I'm tired too. We had a really good time."
"It was nice of Mal-...
He quit blabbering and waved his hand towards downstairs without another word, and soon a thick newspaper flew through the air into his hand. He immediately passed it to Draco, who took it.
"I'm not feeling too well", he answered quickly. "I think I'll have to go lie down already."
"Well...", Harry started slowly. He didn't know how to say it. "I was told that... you had... sex with him..."
Because yes, he really did care for this man. Just thinking about last night, Malfoy crying like that... It was breaking Harry's heart. He couldn't stand it. No one was allowed to make Malfoy suffer like that. After all that he had already been through in his life, the Slytherin didn't deserve to experience any more pain. He deserved to be happy. He deserved someone who made him feel special. Someone who'd do anything for him.
"Very nice, thanks for asking", Harry answered instead of Draco, flashing a broad smile back at him. Theodore's eyes bored into him. As they passed him and kept walking towards the waiting train, Harry glanced back once only to see Theodore glaring at him.
"And still about that last night...", Harry continued. "I didn't want to-"
"Yeah...", Draco answered, suddenly sounding a little tense.
"Half past one", Malfoy answered, closing his book.
with you?!" she hissed at him, grabbing her book from the floor. She turned around, quickly heading towards the Gryffindor girl's dormitory. "My boyfriend's a nutcase!" she snapped before disappearing to the stairs.
Hermione was looking at him with a very serious look on her face. "Harry, I…", she started, hesitating. She was clearly trying to find the right words to say and it seemed to be very difficult for her. "I'm worried about you."
When Draco finally arrived back to Grimmauld Place the next day, it was already late afternoon.
Finally Malfoy turned around, face completely expressionless.
"Yeah. You're right", Harry said. "She's a strong woman after all."
"Draco?" he finally breathed against the beautiful pale skin.
"Harryyy?! Ginny's here!" they heard Hermione calling out from the corridor.
"Why would I laugh?" Malfoy surprised him by asking instead.
"I would love to", the Slytherin said, smiling. Harry had never seen him look so happy and it warmed his heart.
Draco gasped as Harry's finger entered and started to move inside him and Harry felt amazed. The Slytherin felt so damn tight around his finger that he was pretty sure he would end up hurting him tonight after all, even if he did go very slow. He would just have to do his best.
Even through the music, Harry could hear his best friend chuckling again, probably at Lucius. Harry, however, didn't care at the moment. He couldn't keep his eyes off Draco, his soon-to-be-husband.
"Turn around again", he said.
you that I can go by myself but you wouldn't let me", Malfoy said sharply.
Even Lucius came to shake Harry's hand. The man almost crushed his hand with his tight grip, and instead of congrats he only gained an icy glare and a sneer, but it was enough for Harry.
"Give way, Potter!" he suddenly heard Malfoy's frustrated shout from behind him. He jumped, quickly shifting out of the way. The blond Slytherin also had his wand up, his wardrobe flying in front of him towards the room.
torturing us", Ron sighed when they reached the bedroom corridor.
Great.
They shared another long, stupendous kiss and Harry was feeling very confused. It was still very difficult for him to believe what he had just heard. He was inexperienced and Malfoy had just told him he hadn't done anything sexual with anybody else before either, which meant that they had both just had their first sexual experiences...
wanted to kiss the man and he definitely would have done it if they hadn't been interrupted. Actually he was pretty sure that he would had done a lot more things to the Slytherin than just kissing to be exact, and Malfoy was probably aware of the fact too. After all, Malfoy had definitely felt Harry's erection against his legs, there was no chance he could have possibly missed it.
"We ARE getting married, Draco!" Harry snarled. "I am going to marry you no matter what, even if it is the last thing I'll ever do!"
Harry... She's only waiting for an apology", Hermione pointed out.
Ginny was simply glaring at him, looking very pissed. "I can't believe it... He's really brainwashed you, hasn't he?" she said, shaking her head. "He's nothing but a foul, devious SNAKE and you just suddenly believe everything he says to you, just like that?!"
"I guess so", Harry said. "However, it won't be anytime soon since it's Monday again tomorrow."
Harry's thoughts were cut off by a familiar voice, and he instantly broke the kiss. He and Ginny were now both staring at Draco, Goyle and Theodore standing few meters away from them. Goyle was shaking his head, and Theodore's mouth was slightly open as they all stared at Harry.
"Okay... That's good", Hermione said before silence fell over them. Harry lifted his gaze carefully, noticing Hermione's gaze still lingering on the golden watch around his wrist.
"I think we should go to sleep", he said, not able to look at the other man anymore.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, do you take Harry James Potter to be your husband? Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, in sickness and health, and be faithful only to him so long as you both shall live?"
Harry swallowed hard. Ginny wanted to have sex with him. He remembered dreaming about sleeping with Ginny – a long time ago. He had wanted nothing as much as to finally feel her girlfriend's naked body against his own, wanted her to show the unexperienced Harry all the tricks she knew... but now... just thinking about it suddenly felt very weird and almost… gross.
"Silence, Mr. Nott! I want to hear no objections! Both of you, follow me. NOW."
"It certainly matters to me! I haven't slept
He went to lie down again, surprising the Slytherin by wrapping his arm around him and pulling him against his chest. Malfoy didn't seem to mind, although he still had a little cranky expression on his pale face. Harry moved his free hand to Malfoy's hair, caressing the soft platinum locks gently with his fingers.
Malfoy", Harry answered sourly, pulling his socks on.
Yeah. Last night would be the first
The next weeks passed quickly and suddenly it was already the last week of the term before Christmas.
Malfoy behind Ginny's back..." He looked like he was about to throw up any minute now.
one very quickly", the Slytherin said, before adding icily: "I can't stand the idea of seeing her hands on you ever again."
Soon Harry's and Draco's selected song started playing in the hall. Everyone turned around in their seats to have a look at the two men standing at the open doors and starting to walk down the aisle, slowly.
"Let's go to Honeydukes too", Ron said. Harry lifted his gaze towards his best friend, sitting on the other side of the table.
"Yes", Ginny sneered. "I honestly don't give a damn about how people treat him. He's done too many horrible things in past to make me care one bit!"
"I don't know. Let's talk about it later", he answered. He wasn’t in a mood to discuss that any further right now.
"Blimey, Draco", he breathed and slightly opened his eyes, meeting Draco's gaze. "You're so fucking tight. Doesn't it hurt?"
Draco did as told, sitting on the other end of the couch, next to still very angry looking Theo.
He was already offering his hand, prepared for a quick, icy handshake, but was completely bemused when he received a hug instead.
"What are your plans for Saturday?" Ginny asked Harry softly.
When Harry arrived home an hour later, he was feeling a little relieved. Though he hadn't confessed to Ron yet, it warmed his heart to know that Hermione already knew about him and Draco, and wasn't disgusted by it. When they had separated in front of the café, Hermione had given him a quick hug, whispering to his ear: "I'm happy for you, Harry. I hope he's the one to make you happy." After that she had given him a gentle smile before walking away with Ron.
, pushed me against that wall and kissed me. Then you came and... you know what happened after that."
Harry nodded again. "Yeah", he said. He saw the Slytherin's lips curve up to a smile.
Harry felt his stomach tighten. He had not expected Ginny to come to him here, in the middle of the dinner and most of all in front of everyone's eyes. He quickly glanced towards the Slytherin table, luckily noticing that Draco was concentrating on a conversation between him, Blaise, Pansy, Goyle and Theodore.
Ginny's attitude towards Malfoy was also making Harry doubt everything. He had thought of Ginny as a warm, righteous person but today Ginny had shown him that she could be very cruel as well. Talking about Malfoy that way, when Harry knew better…
"Oh. I was at Hogsmeade", Harry said.
They soon entered the train, Harry on the lead and Draco right after, walking along the long train aisle.
Hermione was shaking her head. "I don't
Anyhow, the whole Christmas break Harry had been kind of living in a bubble. He hadn't wanted to think about school, Ginny or anything else, he had only wanted to concentrate on Draco, and now the reality was hitting him hard. They would soon be back at school and everything would be so different again.
"It's sad that it didn't work between you and Ginny", it was Hermione's turn to say. "But when one door closes, another one opens,
Harry's eyes were starting to burn from the restrained tears but it only made him even more angry at himself. He did not want to start crying in front of Draco Malfoy! There was
"Are you
He quickly followed the other man. "We
”That’s nice to hear”, Harry answered with a quick laugh. His eyes followed as Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Draco Malfoy, Gregory Goyle and Pansy Parkinson walked past them and left the library.
Harry grinned, feeling uneasy. "Yeah, I guess I should."
Draco realized how much he had really missed kissing Harry and holding him close. To even think about losing Harry to someone else... No. He didn't want to think about that anymore. That would
"I know", was all Ginny said before pulling away. She was avoiding eyecontact with Harry, but he could still see her brown eyes red of crying.
It didn't take long until the realization hit him, and with his mouth slightly open he turned his head to the man sitting next to him. The man who was looking at him back with an unsure look on his face, stormy grey eyes showing powerful emotion.
"I wanted to talk to Malfoy but he's apparently gone to sleep", Harry explained, quickly walking back to his own door.
He took a short pause before he kept going.
"Maybe he's in Hogsmeade", Pansy said.
Malfoy was eyeing him, still quiet and expressionless.
"Really?" Draco asked, unsure, and looked at his mum in confusion as they pulled apart from each other. "You're not angry that it's...
I kept hoping. Then you started dating Chang. Hmph. I was glad it didn't work out between the two of you, but then you fell for the Weasley girl instead and you two became a couple", Draco continued bitterly. "I tried to date Pansy myself but I had no real interest in her, so it didn't lead to anything."
Harry wasn't surprised. After all, it had taken over a month before his best friend had approved of his and Draco's relationship a year ago, and he still wasn't happy about it. Harry himself, however, couldn't possibly have been any happier.
Ginny was glaring at him with her brown eyes flaring. "Just look at yourself! What is
Harry grimaced. Right. Ginny… She really did despise Malfoy, she always had, from the very beginning. In Ginny's first year at Hogwarts, Malfoy's father Lucius had almost caused her death with Tom Riddle's diary, and then, during the war, Ginny's hatred towards the Malfoys had risen to its peak. She kind of accused Malfoy's for Fred's death, too.
He hesitated for a while before slowly shifting closer to that door, listening. He heard nothing. He shifted even closer and then closer again, until he was finally standing right in front of the door.
"I honestly don't think you'll have time to", Hermione quickly burst their bubble.
In the end Draco got tired of being ignored and rejected so much, no matter how much he put an effort to his looks, and finally he stopped trying as well. They stopped having sex, they stopped snuggling on the couch, they stopped doing anything at all together. They hardly even talked to each other anymore these days and when they did, Harry was only telling him how exhausted he was because of work.
Now that it was their last year at school, the classes were much more difficult, there was a lot of homework and so little time to do anything else. 8th grade students weren't allowed to play quidditch either, not that it really mattered, because they wouldn't have much time to practise.
Harry was running his hand through his hair nervously, already knowing for sure what was coming next. "Yeah, I was alone at first, until Malfoy came there. We-"
"Hey!" Harry greeted as he reached the Slytherin.
Ginny was looking at him, clearly not believing her ears. "You mean y-you... really want to... b-break up with me?" she stammered.
"Feeling regretful?" he heard Malfoy ask again after a while of waiting. The Slytherin was clearly trying to sound indifferent.
Draco raised his head from Harry's chest, looking deep into his eyes again. "You were?" he asked, a lopsided smile on his pink lips.
Harry smiled, tightening his hold around his beautiful man. "I love you too, baby", he said back, inhaling the delicious scent of Draco's cologne. He was so happy that Draco was finally all his.
Draco gave a nod. "Do you mind if I come?" he asked.
"But... why?" Draco asked. He didn't get it.
"Why are you not using any magic?" Draco had asked him in the beginning, when Harry had been cutting fish with a knife. "We are not underage anymore." Underage wizards were not allowed to use any magic during holiday's but since they were already adults they were able to use it as much as they liked, as long as they followed the rules when using it.
"Mm. Just take them off already", Malfoy soon gasped in between the kiss, still rubbing Harry's erection with his right hand at the same time.
They spent a long time just caressing and kissing each other, until they decided to go and take a shower.
Malfoy wrinkled his eyebrows, glancing at him. "Come again?" he asked.
"Fine. No talking then", Harry answered, tightening his grip around the Slytherin. Silence fell over.
"Oh come on, Potter... Don't be so touchy", he heard Malfoy sigh teasingly. The next thing he knew, the man was getting up of the bed and walking towards him and soon the Slytherin was already leaning over him and his essay from his right. Harry, having finally finished writing, glanced at him.
Draco was rubbing his red, teary eyes, feeling completely helpless at the moment. Finally he followed his friends to the living room, head bowed down.
"I love you too, Draco", he said back, thumb caressing the other man's jawline, once again drowning in the other man's eyes. "What would you say if I asked you... once we graduate, will you move in with me?"
"My bed, of course", Harry answered, turning to face the other man.
"Right", was all Ron said. He also took a swig of his coffee.
"What do you think?!" Harry shouted. "I'm
Malfoy slowly lifted his gaze, their eyes meeting. "Why don't you hate me like others, Potter?" he asked. "You of all people should hate me after all I've done to you and your friends, and still..." His voice died.
"What do you mean?!" Ginny gasped. "Don't tell me this is what I think it is, Harry!"
Harry shook his head. "I didn't", he admitted. "But I
because of you!" Harry shouted at him.
They just laid there for a long time, snuggling and kissing each other, until they finally decided that it was the time to get out of the bed and head downstairs to have some breakfast.
"Ah, Harry", the Slytherin breathed, making Harry's cock twitch. Hearing Draco's voice and seeing the sight in front of him was really making him horny as hell. He wanted the Slytherin
Ron and Hermione kept telling him about everything they had been doing at the Burrow, where they had visited and what they had gotten as presents. Harry listened to them, feeling very restless, fiddling with his sleeve all the time. When finally his friends attention turned to him, his stomach was turning into knots.
"There you go", Malfoy said, placing one of the Triples in front of Harry.
"Yeah", Malfoy said, stroking his hair which had gotten all ruffled after flying. Harry found himself secretly eyeing him for far too long, again.
"I can't believe it! You would rather spend the
", Draco answered with a sneer. He finally pulled his coat off and revealed his new, very sexy looking dark red dress shirt and the black trousers that complimented his butt perfectly. He had bought the clothes yesterday evening before going to the nightclub with his three Slytherin friends.
"We'll see who laughs at the end", Malfoy snarled.
"I had a fight with Ginny", he said.
"Great", Ron said with a wide grin on his face. Then, surprising both Harry and Hermione, he glanced behind him, towards the Slytherin table, and added, while getting up at the same time: "I'll go ask if they'd like to come with us as well."
"It totally was", Draco said, looking at him with a dazed expression on his face. He was gently stroking Harry's black, messy hair and rolling it around his finger, his eyes filled with fondness. Harry finally realized how much Draco really cared about him, just like Harry cared about Draco. It was clear that it had not been mere sex to Draco. Harry had been too blind to see what had been right in front of his eyes this whole time.
Harry trembled. His eyes were still staring at the flames of the fireplace and, once again, his mind was filled with nothing but Malfoy's fiery eyes. Those beautiful grey eyes that had looked deep into his soul just an hour ago.
Harry was staring at his glass again now, nervously tapping it with his fingernails. Fuck! He was a pathetic idiot. He startled again when he suddenly heard Ron mentioning his name.
happened, but after that I just couldn't stop thinking about you." He paused, letting out another sigh. "It just got worse and worse over the years."
When it was the last day before their return back to Hogwarts, Harry met Ron and Hermione alone at a small café. Harry, who had prepared himself to confess about his new relationship with Draco, suddenly found himself feeling ill at ease.
"I don't know", Ginny said, shaking her head. "I can't say you can't come but... I don't know if it's... uh... I know mum is waiting for you to join us and everything but... I don't know, okay! You have to think about it yourself."
"Hi", the Slytherin answered, looking at him expectantly. "Well, how did it go? What did they say?" he asked right away.
nervous. He didn't get it. He was Harry Potter, the one who had killed Voldemort, but still he was feeling nervous about something like this?
Draco had started to pay attention to the fact how Harry's work days as an Auror were slowly becoming longer and longer. Sometimes he would inform him that he would be late, but sometimes not.
Theodore and Blaise were whistling as Draco walked past them, gaining nasty glares from some of Draco's relatives, but Draco himself only grinned and winked at his friends before continuing his journey with his father, holding his head up high.
The Slytherin's face was priceless. He rose to rest on his elbow. "What? You mean this was your..." His voice faded away.
Harry was sitting on his bed in his and Ron's bedroom, nervously fiddling with his fingernails.
Draco chuckled. "I know", he said, wrapping his arm around him. "Gosh, I'm a Potter now... Draco Potter. Sounds terrible, doesn't it?"
Malfoy's eyes closed as Harry came very close and let go of his chin, moving his hand to the back of the blond's neck instead, about to close the last few millimeters gap between them. He closed his own eyes, ready for their first kiss.
"First of all, remember who you are", Greg said, a lopsided smile rising to his lips. "You are Draco Malfoy, for Salazar's sake!"
From the corner of his eye Harry saw Malfoy walking in without asking for a permission. The next thing he knew, the Slytherin was already strutting around their room, looking all high and mighty, scanning it with his eyes.
Hermione and Ron turned to look at Harry. They had no idea what he was talking about. He quickly looked to his side, making sure that anyone else wasn't listening.
Draco answered.
Harry smiled. He moved his both hands to the other man's buttocks as he continued his angled thrusts. Draco was rubbing himself at the same time, moaning. Harry was in heaven. It felt so wonderful to be inside Draco, he wished it would never have to end. He crushed his lips against the Slytherin's throat, leaving another angry red mark there.
After all, it had become very clear to Harry that Theodore's feelings towards Draco hadn't died. The man was still very much in love with Draco and Theodore had proved to be quite cunning before, Slytherin that he was, so Harry couldn't trust him completely. Actually, he didn't know if he could trust him
"Ginny wasn't too happy to read about your engagement in the Prophet, either", Hermione said, an uneasy look on her face.
"I enjoyed what happened tonight between us", Harry finally said, having calmed down. "But it's not like this could ever lead to something permanent, right? With all our crazy history together, all that violence between us, your family, our friends, my girlfriend... There's just too many things and... it would never work anyway, right?"
at all to the Slytherin? For a short while last night he had actually thought that Malfoy wanted him, Harry Potter, for who he was. He had thought that the Slytherin cared about him as well, as much as Harry cared about him, but clearly it had all been his imagination. He had just been
Theodore was quiet for a while, before finally saying: "If you
Harry cut Draco's sentence by smashing his lips against his mouth again. Draco kissed him back fiercely.
"You can't choose who you fall in love with, Ginny", Harry tried to defend himself. "I didn't do this on purpose. It just... happened!"
And what about later that same night, at Hog's Head? Harry had been pretty drunk that night, but he could still remember the thoughts that had been running through his mind the whole time. He had loved the woody, spicy cologne of the blond, with a hint of vanilla… Harry had wanted to smell the man better, he had wanted to kiss him, to press him against the wall… He had blamed it all on his drunken state but it had not been just because of all the drinking. No, he had
Soon Harry started arriving home so late that Draco had already gone to sleep, or at least he was already lying in their bed and
Malfoy cut him off, furious. "Well you can tell Weasley to go to hell!!!" he snapped.
Harry raised his eyebrows. How did Malfoy know about his and Ginny's argument? They had been alone...
"I guess that's true", Harry said, smiling back. "But it's different now, it's a lot worse when it comes to you." He paused and took a deep breath before continuing: "I know I'm still in a relationship with Ginny, but I've already decided that after we get back to Hogwarts... I'm going to break up with her, for good. I don't want to be with her anymore... It doesn't feel right." Another short pause. "What I'm trying to say here is... it's
Harry angrily forked some more stew and potatoes to his mouth, glancing towards the Slytherin table accross the Great Hall. Malfoy was sitting in between Theodore and Pansy, resting his chin against his palm. He seemed to be lost in his thoughts and Harry wondered what Malfoy could be thinking of. The Slytherin was staring at the table, not taking any part in the conversation with his friends...
"I'm sorry", Draco finally said. "It's so terrible and... I can't believe I chose to be on his side after everything he had done." He paused before still adding: "Harry, I... I'm so, so sorry." Harry could see the Slytherin's lips quivering.
"I assume it is another one of those muggle things you've been talking about?" Draco muttered.
"I... better be going", he muttered, closing his case.
He raised his head to look at the other man again.
Harry was smiling back. "I know... Just want to make sure that you haven't changed your mind..." He was now looking slightly nervous, and Draco didn't want to keep him waiting for his answer any longer.
"One Black Hog for me, please", Goyle ordered.
Ginny nodded. "Yes. We've got Quidditch practise", she said, sounding irritated. "In case you have forgotten, we've got a game to play tomorrow."
gonna tell Weasley about us soon, right?" he asked. "Like you promised?"
"Oh, poor you", Draco said back mockingly, rolling his eyes.
Draco had become like a drug to him. A drug that Harry couldn't get enough of.
Even after Ron and Hermione had already gone to sleep, Harry was still there in the common room, still lying on the same couch. He kept staring at the flames of the fireplace, deep in his thoughts. He could clearly picture Malfoy sitting at the pub, sipping his drink, looking at Theodore with his beautiful eyes, smiling… It made Harry's insides hurt.
Harry wasn't surprised that Hermione was the first one. He was instantly wrapped in his friend's arms.
"You what?" Malfoy asked slowly.
"How would you feel about it...", he started, hesitating, gaining a questioning look from the Slytherin next to him. "… you know, what your mum was talking about before we left?"
did he ask you?" Ron pressed.
"My cousin's here as well", Harry immediately told Ron, who was abashed.
Harry quickly shook his head. "Nah, I'll pass this time", he said. "I already promised to go flying after breakfast."
Malfoy seemed to hesitate, his eyes resting on Harry now. "If she wanted to break up with you... what would you think about that?" he finally asked.
"So you've read erotic books and learned from
"It may not hide our feet perfectly, though. Since we're both quite tall...", Harry kept babbling. "But it's better than nothing. I don't feel like having a late night chat with Filch at the moment. So...?"
After Ginny had finally left to go to her own dormitory and it was already very late, Harry still stayed at the common room, just leaning his head against the back of the couch, staring at the ceiling and listening to the three Slytherins chattering quietly behind him. He needed to have a word with Malfoy because he had been too shocked to to do that earlier in the morning.
we ignore the fact that your handwriting is still as terrible as ever", Malfoy quickly added in his familiar, sardonic way, making Harry sigh tiredly. Of course Malfoy had to come up with
Harry gave a nod.
eh? I knew it", Malfoy teased, not letting Harry to get away with the subject that easily.
Harry groaned in disappointment and was about to object again but was immediately silenced by another rough kiss from the other man.
Ron was trying to teach Pansy how to play chess, Hermione was reading a book and Harry was lounging on the sofa, chatting with Blaise, Dean, Seamus and Neville.
Once again, Draco looked very dapper in his all dark silk suit, his platinum, medium long hair magnificently styled. The man was out of this world and Harry still couldn't believe that of all the possible people in the world, Draco had set eyes on
Ron sighed, leaning closer to Harry in his chair. "You
For example, they had been told to write
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "As if! You were just lucky this time", he insisted, making Harry laugh.
"Where's Theo?" He blurted out, interrupting Malfoy and Goyle's conversation.
Malfoy teased, and his words made Harry tremble. If only Malfoy knew his thoughts... But Malfoy was not gay and he had no idea how he made Harry feel at the moment. Then again, Harry wasn’t gay either. He didn't know why he suddenly wanted Malfoy when he had never thought about any other man that way. He’d always liked girls, he was in a relationship with a girl at the very moment... and still, he had never felt anything this strong towards Ginny. Of course he had wanted to sleep with her too, but only the mere thought of doing that with Malfoy made him feel so… so... He couldn't even describe how exactly it made him feel. This was so crazy!
the one who's gay."
"I know… and I kind of understand that. You forgot all your plans with her without a word because you were with him", Hermione said, giving him a meaningful look. "You know how that makes us girls feel."
Ginny, however, had only given him a cold, obnoxious laugh in return.
Malfoy grimaced. "Yeah, you're right about that one… My new room is as small as a broom cupboard", he sneered. "But I guess I'll get used to it in time."
Harry repeated, clearly not able to believe his ears. Draco noticed that his face was slowly turning red with anger.
"Oh…", was all he managed to say. His throat felt strangled. "Okay."
"What does it look like", Malfoy answered.
"I heard about what happened last night", Harry said carefully.
"What time is it?" he muttered quickly, rubbing his face.
Harry hadn't seen his friends after the incident in the Great Hall and he wasn't ready to, either. He
Ron and Hermione exchanged glances.
He left the table, hurrying through the Great Hall. Ginny, who was sitting with her friends, was calling after him... but he didn't care. He kept on going until he was outside and pressed his back against the wall, breathing heavily. What was happening to him?
Harry moved his tongue in between Malfoy's lips and soon the other man opened his mouth, letting Harry's tongue slip in, and Harry kissed him passionately. He could still taste Malfoy's favourite drink in his mouth as their tongues were moving against each others. Harry felt his heart beating faster and faster and he pulled Malfoy even closer, wanting to feel his body fully pressed against his own. Oh god, this was
Harry nodded, staring at the ruins gravely. "Yeah...", he said. He could feel the other man's eyes on him again as they just stood there in deep silence.
