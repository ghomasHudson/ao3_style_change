“Oh, Harry, I was so worried – “
Draco made an undistinguished sound and tried to escape, but it was no use. Harry was an inch or two shorter than him, but was built much stronger than Draco was, rendering Draco useless in a physical fight.
“No,” he said finally, glaring down at the ground. “Even then, she didn’t know to leave well enough alone. In fact, I don’t know who was worse, her or Potter.”
wasn’t too much trouble. I mean, I grew up with them telling me I was a waste of space and, well, they didn’t ask for me so I have to be grateful for what they did for me. And I am.”
“What did you mean by ‘pretending to be normal’?” Draco asked hesitantly.
“I never knew, I never even thought to find out, I just assumed you had a perfect life and I was so wrong, I couldn’t have been more wrong.”
“Why can't I just have a simple life?" asked Harry, but all Ginny could do was pat him on the shoulder.
“Or I could bring it back for next year. Four Years Since – “
Draco raised an eyebrow. “See something you like?”
Draco dropped the pad where it had been levitating earlier; it obeyed and resumed floating by Leonel’s side. He then left the room to fetch Potter’s existing medical files. Upon finding only outdated ones, he started a new one, along with paperwork for this visit. He quickly filled out what he could on his way back to the room; he’d have to wait until Potter regained consciousness to complete the rest.
“This is weird, isn’t it?”
Harry looked at them; their interest was thinly veiled.
“Reckon I should be thankful I can’t speak parseltongue, then. Merlin, what were we even talking about before this? I can’t remember.”
"Oh my - Harry, I'm so sorry, Kreacher just said that you were sleeping, he didn't say that anyone else was here!" Hermione blurted all at once.
“There you are,” Granger said. “You keep disappearing on us!”
Potter stood in front of him, a bottle of butterbeer in his hand and his eyes hazy. Draco folded his arms across his chest.
“Like rubbish, and not that I know of,” Harry said shortly.
“I don’t know,” Draco admitted. “Relieved because he’s not my patient anymore, but actually a little…upset that I can’t see him every day anymore.”
you, Harry,” Hermione started to say, but then Ron said, “Not as much as she should.”
but thought that he could just waltz back into Draco’s life and give him an ultimatum?
“Progress is progress, Potter.”
Estrada cleared his throat and said, “Healer Malfoy, I am ready to begin as soon as you are.”
Malfoy nodded. “Withdrawal from both alcohol and calming potions will affect your sleep rather severely, I’m afraid. Because there’ll be no more risk of death after today’s procedure, we’ll administer a basic calming potion afterwards to aid in you retaining a regular sleeping schedule. It won’t be too strong, of course, but you do need something in your system.”
“Still.”
“Aright, what is it?”
Draco sighed heavily and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, because that was easier than talking.
Malfoy sighed, and he became less rigid. “Me too.”
Draco shut his eyes. No, Harry hadn’t. He needed this wake-up call. He should thank him.
The cleansing was over and done with in fifteen minutes, and the two Healers took their leave shortly after they’d finished. Once the door was shut, Harry went to pick up the business card Malfoy had given him the day before. Luckily, Malfoy hadn’t seen it on the ground, or if he had, he didn’t comment on it.
“Harry,” Draco whispered. His entire body felt like it was burning up.
There were probably more, but (only) these were at the forefront of Harry’s mind.
want to see Potter again. Not in St. Mungo’s, but anywhere else would do.
“No, it’s ok, it’s me,” Draco admitted. “I was just...”
He was brought out of his thoughts by Blaise’s murmurs and Ginevra’s laughs. Draco watched them for a moment, feeling achingly single and alone. He cleared his throat.
He went and sat down next to Potter.
been around Americans before.
“I’ve never said anything of the sort.”
But their friends were still firmly in the dislike camp, while they attempted to play nice for the sakes of Harry and Draco.
“Yeah,” Harry said, trying to smile. “That last shot did me in.”
Estrada gave him a sympathetic look. "Would you like a Pain-Reducing Potion?"
"As in...?"
“I don’t think you were a wanker,” Harry cut in.
With his father in prison and his mother spending most of her time in France, the Manor stood empty. Draco went to retrieve old texts or even keepsakes from time to time, and he and his mother spent Christmas holiday in it, but otherwise, it was deserted. There were too many ghosts to render it habitable, in Draco’s opinion.
Draco smirked, and Harry bit down a smile, always up for a challenge.
tear up. He focused on his cappuccino and sandwich instead of on Ira, and suddenly realized that he wasn’t hungry anymore.
flushed. “Why not? A
Draco never knew how to act when he saw Weasley or Granger without Harry; fortunately, when he did, it was only for short amounts of time (besides the Quidditch match). Harry was clearly braver than him, as he had approached both Draco and Pansy today, but look where that got him. Pansy had clearly said something unpleasant to Harry, and he didn’t think either of them were willing to admit it.
Harry gave a horrible grin and wiped his forehead again, rushed Draco, and put his sweaty hands all over Draco's face.
Harry stood awkwardly in front of Ginny, holding his arms out so she could adequately inspect her.
There was a sudden knock at the door. Draco already knew who it was.
Pansy sighed. “If you’re sure. I just don’t want you to get hurt.”
He flung an arm around Samuel, who wasn’t quite so intoxicated, but was definitely feeling the effect of alcohol in his blood.
Draco's lip trembled.
And the anxiety. His chest was so tight it hurt, and his heart was constantly pounding, loud and fast in his ears. Everything’d been making him jump lately and he’d had his first full-blown panic attack for the first time in a while yesterday.
“It’s been a week since I’ve been outside,” Harry said. He was looking out the window again, watching the leaves shift and move together gracefully, each one in sync with the next. And then he started talking and couldn’t stop the words from coming out. “It’s sort of…before, I’d stay in for – who knows how long and not even care. But now my mind’s clear again and I have to live and be
Potter was staring at him again, hard, but it wasn’t angry like the last time. No, now they were wide, full of wonder perhaps. Draco shifted nervously, dropping his gaze to his files and staring blankly at them. What on earth possessed him to say all that? He really hoped he wasn’t crossing any Healer/patient barriers by telling that to Potter, but he didn’t think he did. Not any
“Who?” Draco asked, looking up, and then saw Harry staring at him across the Great Hall.
“Right.”
“Is something wrong, Potter?” he asked urgently, fixing his grey eyes on Harry.
“Whatever, Potter.”
He turned to look at the person who was standing before him. She was a thin, white, conventionally attractive woman with a kind smile. Her blonde hair was being kept out of her face with several bobby pins though a few stray pieces had fallen out, gently framing her kind face.
“These will all be things to discuss with your Mind-Healer,” he said, without looking up.
“Alright, Draco?” said Samuel, bringing Harry back to earth.
Draco yawned, exhausted despite having slept for so long. He realized he was still completely naked and dug around the foot of his bed for his underwear. After getting them on, he turned to look at Harry, who was sleeping peacefully beside him. Draco gazed at him fondly, the usual warmth he felt now tinged by guilt and sadness.
Harry pulled back the curtain and stood up, back and arse to Draco. He noticed that he was right; Harry did still have his socks on.
“I’ve had a headache for a while now, and I’m a bit tired, but other than that…”
“I think this line of work requires the presence of relaxing tea,” Draco said. He glanced at him again. “You can sit down, Potter.”
Harry was interested in hearing more, but the heat of Draco’s gaze was enough to drive his curiosity away (for the time being, at least).
“Nothing I can make a career out of – just cafes, pubs, once a supermarket,” Draco grimaced. “Imagine the Muggles’ shock when I waltzed in asking for a job when I had no identification and no CV. What about you, Potter? Have you had the pleasure of working minimum wage?”
“Look, if you’re really all that worried about it – “
Kathy smiled at him. “Thank you for sharing that with us, Harry. I know how difficult it is to take that first step, and we’re glad you’re here with us.”
Draco found calm in potions; it was methodical and demanded his undivided attention, forcing him to leave his thoughts for a while. He excelled and did well on his NEWTS, and worked his way up from the bottom of St. Mungo’s. It had been difficult at first – his name on its own was enough to make coworkers and superiors recoil. Yes, a former Death Eater now trying to save lives for a living. He saw the irony. Still, he worked without reservation, determined to show everyone that he'd changed - he was a Healer, and a damn good one too. Slowly, management began to realize that, and he began his slow climb to where he was now. He was incredibly busy and barely got time off, but that was the way he liked it. It took his mind off all the other less pleasant things. The bad thing about that, though, is that over the years, he became enveloped in his work and drifted away from his oldest friend.
“Well…yes, it’s not the prettiest or most clear-cut situation, but it’s not the end of the world, Draco,” Ira said.
Draco flushed and avoided Harry’s gaze. “That’s why? Because I’m blond?”
“If that shouting match just now was anything to go by, I believe you.”
"He's actually very decent," Ginny said, a delicate flush crossing her face, "And I happen to like him quite a bit. Just because you never got to know him-”
“I’m so happy to hear that, Harry.”
This was a mistake, he thought for the millionth time in his life.
to be something here. A patient trying to escape? A thief, looking for potions to steal?
“Oh my goodness, that’s wonderful! Were they adorable together? I’m sure they were. I’ve got to send them an owl immediately.”
“It’s over with. It’s done.”
What was going on? They were talking about him, that was clear enough, but the way Malfoy was making quips around his junior, and the way Estrada had responded with comfortable familiarity right away...it was strange.
“Not the point.”
It must be Harry – who else could it be? He made to open the door when his brain interrupted him.
coming down!”
“Thanks,” Harry said again.
“Are you alright, Healer?” she asked quietly.
Harry froze immediately, a cold sweat quickly developing at the back of his neck. He turned slowly as a steady stream of curses cut through his foggy mind.
He went to sit.
Before Harry could respond, Malfoy had gone to the fireplace and thrown Floo powder into the fire.
Pansy blanched. “Jealous? Don’t be ridiculous. I’m just annoyed that he thought himself too important to join us on our first dinner back together.”
Draco felt touched that Harry had considered this.
Draco sniffed and turned away. “No.”
"How do you know I don’t want to kill you?"
Harry slipped his hand into Draco's trousers, past the waistband of his pants and took hold of Draco's cock, already wet with precome.
Ginny's mouth fell open, her previously tired eyes now glittering with excitement and intrigue.
“I dunno,” Potter said, and he bit his lip. “I mean, I just wanted to thank you. Properly. It, er, was nice to get that all of my chest.”
“I have to be,” Harry sighed. “Cos then it becomes too much.”
Draco stared at him openly, the Gryffindor too caught up in his critique of their new Defense professor to notice. He really was fit, which was completely unfair because he
“I might have a few ideas.”
Draco’s throat was suddenly dry, and he took a nervous sip of wine. It didn’t help.
“Hmm,” Draco said.
“You are,” Harry’s dirty look intensified. “If you’re just going to make fun of me –”
“Assistance will be here shortly,” said a pleasant, tinned voice.
“It’s not
Draco checked his watch. It was half past three. “I suppose I could leave around five. There’s not much left for me to do.”
“You idiot,” Pansy seethed, glaring at him with sharp, dark eyes. “You can’t keep doing this.”
Draco scanned over the top of her head to see if he could spot him in the crowds pushing out of the Hogwarts Express, but no such luck.
“Good idea,” said Draco, his heart still beating rapidly.
“You already know a lot about me, don’t you? By the way, some constructive criticism: you could share more, y’know. I, for one, would like to get to know you more, at least.”
Harry licked his lips. Malfoy’s eyes darted down to them, the pink tinge of his face becoming more pronounced. And then, even though his mind screamed not to, he moved closer. Malfoy’s eyes snapped back to Harry’s own, but Harry kept walking. With his body on autopilot, he finally came face-to-face with Malfoy.
“Draco?” he croaked.
Could he really escape? The only real belongings he had here were the clothes on his back, the one change of clothes that Ginny had brought him a few days ago, and his Cloak. And his wand, but he could worry about that later. Right now, he just had to leave.
He then realized someone else was in the room – a Healer, in lime green robes.
“Then there’s nothing to worry about.”
“Congratulations, Hermione,” he said as they pulled away from each other, beaming at her.
It was true. Hermione was still upset about his escapades featuring illegal Muggle drugs and he had no doubt she would strong-arm him into staying. And he didn't want to disappoint her for the thousandth time.
“Yes, Healer Malfoy.”
He groaned, leaned back against the couch, and closed his eyes.
“Stop,” Harry said, finally speaking. “I don’t - I don’t tell people, and this is why. I’m not the same kid in the cupboard. I have people who love me now, and I just have to remember that I’m not in that situation anymore.”
“You might as well surrender, Leo,” Draco told him. “There’s no use fighting it.”
“I’ll see you then.”
Malfoy looked like he was going to start an argument, but changed his mind and simply sighed.
Betty? You three are more than enough.”
“Harry, how could you – “ Hermione was already saying as she came into the kitchen, obviously distressed. She hurried over to him and searched his face, concern marring her features. “Are you alright? Oh, Harry, I don’t know what to say, when Ginny firecalled I – ”
"Yeah, alright, Healer Dragon," Harry said as he shifted once again onto his back. He avoided looking at Draco before saying, "No one else has ever seen it before."
“Wow. Well, congrats.”
“No, I mean, I’m sorry. About – in there. I shouldn’t have said all that I did. It wasn’t true. I don’t know what happened. It really felt like I was fifteen again.”
“Morning,” Harry chirped.
“What?”
Harry shook his head, not looking at them. He spoke to his hands.
“No,” Draco lied blatantly. “Of course not.”
“Right,” Harry said faintly.
“No, I should go,” said Draco, glancing up at Harry as he pulled on his shirt. “I don’t think I can sleep anymore anyway, and soon the rest will be waking up…you need your rest.”
“I apologize if I
Malfoy exhaled impatiently.
“He’s not your patient anymore,” Ron countered.
“Yeah, of course.”
“Likewise,” Harry responded.
He stayed in the same position for a good ten minutes before getting out of bed and shakily walking himself to the shower. He was sore in the best way possible, in the way that he hadn’t been in literal years. Harry winced as he bent to turn on the water. As he waited for the water to turn hot, he glanced at himself in the mirror, pleasantly surprised by what he’d saw.
Draco was left staring at the spot Potter had been standing at, smiling at him.
“I want you too. But not here,” Draco said, hearing the shakiness in his own voice. “Somewhere with a bed, preferably.”
“Fair enough,” Potter said, still grinning. His green eyes were bright. “We’re having a real conversation, Malfoy.”
“I have. It’s Malfoy.”
It was Malfoy. He rushed in after just one knock, his expression serious.
Ira's jaw had dropped, their eyes wide as they regarded Draco curiously. "Really?"
“I’ve never had sex before,” Draco said quickly, his cheeks burning now. He avoided eye contact.
Hermione exhaled. Harry wondered what would come next.
“Welcome, class, to your final year of Hogwarts,” he said, a nervous smile on his face. “It’s about time, eh?”
“The bathroom is just a few steps away, but if you feel you can’t make it, there’s a bucket at the side of your bed.” Malfoy gestured towards it. “I’ll leave you to rest now. Healer Estrada and I will be in tomorrow morning to do step two of the cleansing process, but if you need anyone before then, don’t hesitate to alert us.”
Finally, and with significant effort, Draco relaxed his shoulders and said in his best professional voice, “I think we’re set for now. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?”
“Matters to me.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to ask a question – something that was still eating away at Harry’s mind.
“Dreary business? You’re such a prat,” Potter said, though he didn’t dispute Draco’s claims. He nibbled on his bottom lip a moment while Draco pretended not to watch. “Do you not like it?”
. “Foolish question.”
A moment later, Ginevra poked her head out the door.
“He is. Of course, I
Draco heard a light knock on the door and he opened it. Harry stood outside, looking absolutely gorgeous in his black hoodie. It shouldn’t have been allowed, how good the man looked in simple Muggle clothing.
He stopped himself and glared down at the table. Merlin, he was certainly prone to rambling when he was drunk.
“We’ll catch up later, won’t we, Draco?” Pansy asked, as vulnerable as he’d ever seen her.
Estrada was back sooner than Harry had expected with the little bottle of maroon-colored potion. Harry straightened up, leaned against the headboard, and watched as Estrada carefully unstoppered the bottle and handed it to Harry.
,” Draco hissed. He slunk back down and laid in bed next to Harry. “Fuck you, Potter, for making me go through that.”
you outweighs anything they ever did for you, which doesn’t sound like much. A caretaker should never lock their child up or deny them food, and it sounds like that’s what your aunt and uncle did. You’re allowed to be mad at them, and you’re allowed to think that they were in the wrong. You didn’t deserve their abuse.”
"Of course. What sort of thing is he looking for?"
Splashing his face with cold water, he rid the images from his mind and tried to relieve himself of the guilt. Did they think he
“Right,” Harry repeated, his heart caught in his throat. He urged himself to speak. “Thanks, Malfoy. For…everything.”
“No, my first friend.”
“Good morning,” Draco said. “We should really get up.”
“Well,” said Draco hesitantly, “I understand if you feel indebted to me after so generously gracing you with my presence.”
Mostly, it was Harry. Merlin help him, it was always Harry. Draco was sure that if he knew Harry was staying at Hogwarts,
He gestured towards his food, and Ira looked down at it.
Potter didn’t stop, but he
“I’m not hungry.”
Harry stared at a corner of the room because eye contact was difficult. He sat there wringing his hands, wondering how to proceed. He forced himself to stop moving his hands.
“To Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, please.”
“Yeah, fine,” Harry said weakly, sinking down into a chair.
“I’m sorry I broke it,” Harry said, running a finger down its frame.
Draco waited as Harry retrieved the Invisibility Cloak from his trunk, and made an apologetic face as he passed it to Draco.
Draco checked his own and started when he saw that it was already fifteen past eleven.
“Maybe they’re right,” Draco said slowly, avoiding eye contact. “Maybe we can’t be friends, given our past. It’s just too messy and I’m too bad and wrong and I’m sorry-“
doing this? Maybe he did – no, he
“Harry, are you sure you don’t want to stay a bit longer? I feel like you’ll be able to overcome this much easier if you stayed here,” she said in her suggesting-not-demanding voice.
Harry was gripping Draco’s thighs so hard that he’d be surprised if there
can’t be relied on, I don’t know who can.”
"That's tied in with who I am, to be honest."
“It’s two till ten,” informed Malfoy.
"Doesn't make it any less shit."
Harry got it and they all sat down, dropping tea bags and pouring steaming water into the mugs.
And the sight of a sleep-deprived Malfoy in a tight, white button-up with the top two buttons undone was one he wouldn't be forgetting soon. It had allowed Harry a peak at Malfoy’s collarbone and the smooth skin underneath.
Leo made another noise and blinked wearily, his eyes adjusting to the light and focusing on Draco.
Harry’s hands roamed – from Malfoy’s cheeks to his hair to his back. Wanting more, Harry pushed him up against the wall, firmly placing his knee between Malfoy’s legs to keep him there. Kissing Malfoy was like something Harry’d never felt before – intoxicating, drawing Harry in and holding him tight. He finally understood the allure of snogging, Malfoy’s scent and feel enveloping him.
“Well, I – just – it’s fine, alright, Malfoy?” Potter mumbled at his hands. “I just want to finish this and get out of here.”
He flushed but didn’t look away. Harry’s full lips were still shiny with moisture, and Draco couldn’t help but stare at them. He wondered what it would feel like to kiss those lips. To kiss Harry.
Malfoy smiled slightly and said, “Only in extenuating circumstances.”
“I walked.”
“Found it,” he said, straightening up and holding something incredibly familiar to Draco. “Here.”
Draco hesitantly moved closer and reached out to place a hand on Harry’s tense shoulder. There was a blur of motion as Harry turned and embraced Draco, holding onto him as if his life depended on it. Draco was surprised into not moving before remembering himself; he wrapped his arms tightly around Harry.
Draco came into Harry’s mouth with a gasp, his vision whiting out momentarily, and Harry took it all without hesitation. Draco was so dazed he hardly realized Harry slipping his mouth off Draco’s cock and wiping it with the back of his hand.
“Shove off, Malfoy.”
Pansy looked up from her textbook, a surprised expression on her face. She glanced over at Patil, then back at Draco.
“No need to get your knickers in a twist,” Malfoy replied. “It was just a question.”
They fell into an uncomfortable silence, and Draco thought that this was the opportune time to begin eating. Halfway through his second bite, Potter spoke.
“I would,” volunteered a young woman who was sitting beside Kathy. She spoke quickly, her eyes darting across the room. Kathy nodded encouragingly, prompting her to speak. “Well, I’ve had a rather busy week; it’s like my professors are all plotting against me. I just feel like I can never take a break, like I’ve always got to be moving. My mind’s always working and if I’m not doing enough, I feel guilty. But I’ve been trying to keep positive.”
Harry couldn’t think of anything to say.
Draco returned to St. Mungo’s the next morning refreshed. After stopping at his office, he made his way to the employee lounge and found Betty and Ira there. The two of them were sat on the couch, apparently engrossed in conversation.
“Hey, I just wanted to say thanks again,” Samuel said kindly. “Are you new here? I don’t recognize you, and I like to think I’m pretty good with faces.”
Po – no,
“I suppose."
Before Harry could say anything, he undid Harry’s own and Harry lifted his lower body up so Draco could pull them off too. Harry had to pause a moment and appreciate the view of Draco Malfoy in a black turtleneck and white pants straddling him.
Leonel understood immediately; cautiously, he asked, “For an appointment?”
Draco scoffed.
Draco nodded and pushed the paperwork for Potter’s final evaluation towards Scarlett. She picked it up and skimmed it, nodding and making affirmative hums as she did so. Once she’d finished, she put it back down on the desk.
“Astute deduction, Potter.”
“Er,” Harry said, and he fidgeted uncomfortably as approximately fifteen people turned to look at him. He stared determinedly at Samuel and pretended that Malfoy wasn’t there. He pushed on, “Well, I don’t know if it’s exactly the same, but when I’m feeling, kind of, er, trapped in my head and anxious about things, I like taking walks outside. When I do that, it sort of reminds me how big the world is, and my problems feel tiny in comparison. It’s kind of humbling, I guess. It helps me relax.”
Potter said nothing for a moment, and Draco wondered if he should fill the silence. But with what? He was right. To his surprise, Potter echoed these thoughts by saying, “I hate it when you’re right.”
“I won’t stop trying,” said Harry lowly, coming closer. Draco was utterly fixated on him, and a thrill ran through Harry’s body as he realized this. “You already know how stubborn I am.”
“Yeah.”
Draco felt his face flush aggressively at that. He desperately wanted to forget everything about the War, and nowadays, he hardly heard it brought up in conversation. And now Potter of all people was talking about what he was like when he was seventeen years old.
“Yeah, thank you,” Samuel said, smiling kindly at her. “I caught up on some schoolwork, saw my parents…it was productive.”
Like Estrada had predicted, Betty entered the room a moment later with a light knock and a pale blue potion.
“Oh,” Harry said suddenly.
Harry ran a hand through his air and looked away, wincing internally. He’d been so focused on getting salty snacks that he’d completely forgotten that Ginny had asked for things with nutritional value, like vegetables.
. I can’t just stand by and pretend that you’re not struggling. I know you’re really great at pretending everything’s fine but I already know it’s not. You don’t need to keep up the pretense around me. And honestly, I’d really rather you not - it’s unhealthy, Harry, and I’m worried.”
“Betty,” Leonel said abruptly, catching Draco’s attention, “Have you tried
“Draco –“
Potter gave a hollow laugh.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He rubbed at his forehead and asked, “How much does she hate me?”
Harry nodded.
“So this means the cleansing procedure is working?” Hermione asked hopefully.
Draco snaked forward until their noses were inches apart; his pale face came in focus and it was smirking haughtily.
An angry laugh come out of Harry’s mouth. “Yeah, like you still aren’t an arrogant, cold prat. I’m surprised to see you here with all these –“
“It tastes different,” Hermione insisted, and Ron rolled his eyes.
“No, fuck you, Malfoy,” Potter growled. He backed up and stalked away, facing the window with his arms crossed. “Get out.”
“It’s alright, Harry,” Ginny said in a soothing voice. “Tell me what’s wrong. We can talk through it together.”
“Very,” Draco grumbled.
“This is helping. Distraction.”
“Whossit?” Ginny asked through a mouthful of crisps.
“Er, right. Thanks.”
“No, I’m not saying that,” Harry said quickly, his heart sinking and suddenly feeling very sick. “I’m sorry, Hermione, should I go? I’ll go.”
“Hmm?” Draco continued taking notes, half listening to Professor Ulman and half waiting for Pansy to speak.
He was outside his room during the day. The only other time he'd done that was going to and from Malfoy's office under a Disillusionment Spell, and under the protection of Malfoy.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Why do you care?”
“Fuck you, Potter,” Draco snapped, stung. “I didn’t fucking kill anyone.”
He looked around blearily, a panicked expression of his sweaty face. His eyes were wet with tears and unseeing.
Draco looked over at Pansy, willing her to say that she didn’t. She sighed and waved her hand.
“Admit it,” Harry beamed. “You want to watch it. You
is ruthless, even towards their so-called Savior. And really, you didn’t miss much. Just a few articles insinuating I’d
Draco made a dismissive gesture with his hand. "It's all right. I find I'm used to it at this point."
“Of course!”
“And given Potter’s antagonism towards me,” Draco continued, glancing away, a frown on his face, “He’s even less likely to listen to me. So I’m hoping that you’ll try and convince him.”
“See, that wasn’t so bad, was it?” Draco asked, his smiling, damp face inches from Harry’s own.
"Hmm? You said it yourself, I'm a Gemini."
Draco finally drew back, though his hands stayed firmly where they were.
Harry took it from him and drank it down in one swallow. If this was the closest he could get to what he really needed – no,
It didn’t work and he ended up wanking hard, desperately, his eyes shut tight until he came with a cry.
the abandoned loo that Moaning Myrtle occupied but shouldn’t the elves clean it properly anyway? Or they could at least do a better job of it.
"What about you lot? How've you been?" he asked warily as he shoved his glasses back on.
“Really?” Samuel grinned. “Wouldn’t’ve figured you for a copper.”
, Malfoy, Christ,” Harry groaned, his cock aching to be touched.
Hi SO sorry for how long it's been. Life is still full of chaotic events - imagine that.
Draco rolled his eyes.
“Like something bad is going to happen, or did happen. Y’know when your chest is all tight and it actually hurts? Like that.”
“Yes, thank you,” he responded. “I’m sorry I couldn’t say goodbye last week. I was preoccupied.”
Draco flinched and said lowly, “I thought they deserved to die. At first. I wasn’t clever enough to think for myself, to say,
“Yeah,” Harry agreed. He glanced over Samuel’s shoulder for a second, catching a glimpse of Malfoy. Harry hesitated, then nodded towards him. “Hey, er, d’you know him?”
Astoria took the glass and raised it towards him, her lips quirked into a lopsided smile. She disappeared into the crowd, and Draco deflated against the wall. He rubbed at his forehead; a headache was starting to form and Draco wondered how much water he’d had to drink today. Not nearly enough, he decided, and he knew he’d had even less food.
“Could I tell you something?”
He supported the generous donation that the Ministry of Magic had gifted to St. Mungo’s, but
Harry then felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, and it reminded him so much of looking over Dumbledore’s dead body and
Harry nodded, his eyes moving across the room. He honestly couldn’t agree nor disagree with Samuel’s statement; he didn’t know them well enough to have formed a fair opinion. Even Malfoy, Harry thought as his eyes rested on him, was a complete mystery to him all over again.
“I can’t talk about it.”
“I’m sure you already know,” said Draco, “But I’ll tell you anyway. It’s about that time you threatened Harry when my back was turned. Do you remember that?”
left in him.
“I don’t need a therapist,” he told it angrily.
“Harry, I...” he tried to organize his thoughts but his mind was too cloudy. “How do you even...I mean, you didn’t even know you liked men until two days ago.”
“No, you won’t!” Draco finally exploded, turning to glare at Potter. “I can’t release you in good faith. You have an
“Er – why?” Harry managed to get out before Draco fixed his grey eyes on him, silencing him immediately. It was like he was back in that bathroom, being stared at by those intoxicating eyes with the smell of sex sharp in the air. He could almost hear Bowie in the background.
Harry's wish was granted when Hermione and Ron arrived half past ten.
Draco put his head in his hands, wondering if his headache was due to excessive caffeine or all the agonizing.
“I s’pose.”
When he walked back into the eighth-year common room, Draco returned to Pansy and Blaise. They were sat in the corner of the room, lounging and speaking to each other with their books opened in front of them.
“Now hold your breath…one…two…three…four…five…six…seven. Exhale completely through your mouth. One…two…three…four…five…six…seven…eight.”
Draco nodded.
“Of course, we don’t have to,” Draco said quickly. “I just – fuck, I really want to.”
The two of them departed the bathroom (there was hardly anyone in the common room, and the few that were didn’t seem to notice them, thank Merlin) and trudged up the spiral staircase. They got to Draco’s room first, and they both paused in front of his door.
Draco took one last drag before Vanishing his cigarette quickly. He wondered how many he had gone through. There was no way to know for sure now.
“Why am I dating a complete idiot?” Draco murmured to himself, pulling Harry close. When Harry opened his mouth to argue, Draco added, “You don’t need to answer that.”
Draco felt strange after the conversation with Potter in Potions that day. It was the most normal he’d felt – whatever that meant – in a long while. He thought Pansy might have noticed a difference in him too; she looked at him with something other than sadness in her eyes.
Malfoy’s gaze lingered on Harry for another moment, his expression still impossible to read, before it moved to rest on the current speaker.
Draco wasn’t exactly in a rush to go off shouting about it from the rooftops, either. He still had shame, hot and pervasive, dripping over him, courtesy of his father.
"Don't be sorry."
A rustle from the other side of the room distracted him from his thoughts. Draco turned onto his side and saw that Harry was stretching and groaning.
Maybe things would be alright.
Draco had no future. He knew this. Who’d want to hire a mental ex-Death Eater? Still, his mother had pleaded with him, and when he declined, she’d forced him. He didn’t know if she was in complete denial, or if she truly believed that Draco would have a life after
Ginny sighed again.
Potter had, surprisingly enough, entered the public eye again. His sudden reappearance after over five years of nothing had nearly given the entirety of the Wizarding world a heart attack. Draco still remembered the
“Because it’s important,” Draco finished. He turned back around to face Harry, a completely defeated expression his face.
“Could we…go upstairs instead?”
“You’re nicer when you’re not.”
George seemed to understand and said sincerely, “Really, Harry. I’m not lying to you. I’ll always be grateful for what you did for us.”
myself around you,” Draco snapped, turning away from Harry in frustration. “I told you tonight – very plainly, I might add – that I wanted to do this right, take it slow, but what do I do? I kiss you like a fucking wanker – “
“Harry,” interrupted Draco calmly, “Are you all right?”
Leonel was in Draco’s office when he stepped through.
“I’ve had a feeling of dread ever since I woke up this morning,” Potter told him distantly, like his mind was far away. He was not looking at Draco, but instead at the bed. He wrung his hands together as he spoke. “I assume it’s just me being anxious for no reason, but it’s driving me a bit mad.”
With a deep breath and a glance at his watch, Draco slipped inside.
Draco fucked Harry harder now, merciless and beautiful and greedy. Harry felt dizzy with glee and the best kind of hurt there was – he clutched at Draco’s skin and tried to drag him down, wanting to kiss him with too much tongue and teeth. Physics didn’t work in his favor, however, and Harry had to live with Draco panting unevenly and thrusting deep in Harry – which wasn’t that bad.
“Brilliant,” said Harry, unable to articulate anything else. “You’re perfect for each other.”
Malfoy cleared his throat. Harry turned to look at him.
“Ooh, did you learn that from Granger?”
For the first time, Draco noticed something.
“It’s not my fault no one at this miserable school is worthy of my affections,” Blaise said, moodily picking at his eggs.
He made a half-arsed attempt at miming purging, and Draco didn’t know whether to laugh or shout. He settled on taking a deep breath.
Draco smiled back, then said, “It’s not set in stone, you know. That one should wait a year. It could be more of a recommendation.”
“I’ll see you later,” Harry said, already standing and making his way to Johnny’s front door. “Have a good night, Johnny.”
Harry glared at him half-heartedly. Finally regaining his ability to speak, he said, “Do we have to talk about this?”
Ron nodded in silent agreement of the questions, watching the two of them carefully.
He glared at Ginny, who smiled and asked, “What happened?”
Draco’s question snapped Potter out of his pensiveness.
Something indiscernible flitted over Potter’s face. “Greengrass? You barely know her.”
“What – I’m sorry if we acted inappropriately at work, I told him off afterwards –“
The next morning before breakfast, Draco was in the Owlery, sending a letter off to his mother. He had finally accomplished the task after weeks of silence. It was difficult, truly; most of his responsibilities felt like they belonged on a never-ending checklist of things to do, something that would only end when he was dead.
can do.”
He felt rather than saw Potter scan the room, the movements threatening to drive Draco’s head off Potter’s shoulder, but then Potter leaned back against the armchair they were both squeezed in and Draco was safe.
Ron looked away, while Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed.
Leonel met his gaze but didn’t answer right away.
Harry took a deep breath. It was now or never. He had to let them know, get it all out in the open, and make it the past.
“You’re more competitive than me.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Have you assumed we’re going to spend the day together?”
“You too,” he said, and shook her extended hand.
Harry watched as a short list appeared in front of him. Betty began copying down the floating words with great speed; Hermione and Ron looked interestedly at it, the former moving closer to get a better look.
Having spotted them, he hurried to the couch and retrieved them. He shoved them on his face.
“If you’re so brave, tell me what’s happened for you to stop talking to me completely!”
“You don’t mean that,” Potter said, his voice flatter.
“That’s a yes, then,” Leonel said more cheekily than Draco would’ve liked.
“Harry, Merlin, yes,” Draco breathed, hardly aware of what he was saying. All he knew was that he felt incredible, and it was because Harry Potter was sucking his cock like it was the only thing that mattered in the world. “Yes, please, Harry, please…”
Realistically, Draco didn’t have to see Potter until tomorrow. He had made his rounds earlier in the day and checked on all of his other patients then. But perhaps he
, and Harry couldn’t do anything but writhe.
"Have you been following me again, Potter?" he asked. "Have you taken it upon yourself to make sure I'm not up to anything nefarious?"
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Potter said with no real hostility. He gave a heavy sigh. “Well. As long as it’s not just me.”
“I bet you’re having a good laugh, aren’t you, Malfoy?” Potter goaded weakly as he lay back on his bed. He closed his eyes. “This must be bloody hilarious.”
Harry didn’t even realize the tears in his own eyes until he blinked. They rolled down his cheeks but all Harry could do was sit there, feeling even more hollow than he did before. Draco wiped them away with gentle fingers, a matter-of-fact expression on his face.
Draco was about to decline, and then he remembered how tired he was.
“It’s true.”
“I really won’t hurt you, y’know.”
Draco pulled back and told Harry to move back further and lie down. Harry obeyed, his eyes watching, waiting, wanting.
“Oh, wonderful! It’s called the four-seven-eight breathing exercise,” Kathy reminded kindly. “Anyone else?”
“Good,” said Malfoy. “Once again, Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger can either stay or leave – it’s up to you.”
“He almost killed one of my best friends,” Harry said hollowly. He blinked, looked at Estrada, and scowled. “What am I even doing here?”
Draco watched Potter warily, disliking the way he was acting. They’d been doing well the past few days.
playing from inside the pub. He could hear his own stifled breaths, but not Malfoy’s.
incredibly frustrating, that Potter could still look so good without even trying. He was bloody gorgeous when he smiled, all bright eyes and cheeky grins, but even when he wasn’t, even when he was closed off to the entire world, he gave off an aura of authority and raw power. It was alluring and intimidating all at once.
“Sorry,” Harry interrupted, “But you know what he was like, right? Did he tell you about all the classist and prejudiced shite he spewed? Did he talk about how horrible he was to me, my friends, some of our professors? Or did he just tell you the nice bits, like how he was Prefect or got top marks in Potions?”
Potter was gazing at him with such intensity it made Draco flush. What was this prat playing at? Why did he even care what Draco did?”
had a good week,” Cait said, kindly obliging to Draco’s request. “I haven’t had any coke since last Tuesday, which I think is a new record.”
“I will,” said Draco, and went to change into his clothes, his heart still pounding loudly in his chest.
“I think it was a fully formed crush – and I
“Potter?”
He frowned at Harry, who was still feeling rather resentful.
Draco didn’t talk to Potter again until Friday afternoon.
He moved closer and tucked some loose hair behind her ear. She closed her eyes and leaned into the touch, eventually closing the gap between them with a hug. Draco held her close, a hand to the back of her head.
The four of them made their way down the spiral staircase (two of them with difficulty, the other two with exasperation) and spilled out into the crowd. The amount of students packed into the eighth year common room was appalling, and it was clear that Astoria wasn’t the only seventh year to gatecrash. What Draco assumed to be Muggle music was playing loudly enough that it made Draco’s insides vibrate with the beat. Pansy and Daphne disappeared almost immediately, and Astoria rolled her eyes and took hold of Draco’s wrist.
. “It’s only six-thirty.”
Draco almost smiled. "One could call it that."
"You're not certain?"
Draco shook his head. “Not anymore.”
Harry sat on the side of his bed and stared down at the floor, not yet comfortable looking Malfoy in the eye.
“I wanted to apologize again for what I said. Last week,” elaborated Leo, and Draco suddenly understood. Before he could have a chance to speak, however, Leo began talking again. “You were right – it was completely unprofessional, especially since you’re my superior, and uh, yeah. I’m sorry.”
Malfoy was still making a face like he had just stepped in dog shit, and Harry found it rather endearing. He was wearing some sort of fashionable European coat and that deep green scarf of his. His face was tinged a light pink and hair slightly awry. God, he was handsome.
His throat was scratched raw and stung whenever he swallowed, the bitter taste of acid inescapable, but it was worth it. He’d gotten everything out, every last thing he’d eaten for breakfast and a bit more just in case.
They arrived at the front door to Harry’s flat moments later, Draco clutching onto Harry’s arm like a lifeline. Harry fumbled with the keys and the two burst inside the dark space. After slamming the door shut behind them and flicking on the lights, they resumed their messy kisses and frantic touching.
And Salazar help him, Draco thought his heart might have actually skipped a beat.
Draco spent that night at Grimmauld Place too, and when Harry woke up on Friday morning, it was to him spooning Draco.
Draco looked down at his notes again, uncomfortable. “I can take care of myself. I know my limits. I’m just – focused on this bloody case.”
Ron shook his head, and as he was about to elaborate, Hermione walked in, curiosity in her eyes.
“I died,” Harry said simply. He turned back around; his voice was scratchy and his eyes were sullen as he stared at Draco. “When Voldemort hit me with the killing curse in the forest, I died. I saw Dumbledore, and he told me I could go on or go back.”
“What are you two talking about now?” Draco asked, though he already had a pretty good idea.
Harry took off his glasses to rub at his eyes. He dragged his hands roughly down his whole face and knelt forward, still covering his face with his hands. Why did he suddenly feel like crying? Why had he been so angry just a moment before? Even Harry himself couldn’t keep up with his mood swings. He felt like he didn’t have control over himself – he was just watching as his body said or did things, detached from himself entirely.
He and Astoria watched the two head back towards the castle, once again deep in conversation that Draco wished he was privy to.
“What?” she asked, lifting her head, suddenly alert. “What is it?”
Pansy sighed and finally met Draco’s gaze, her eyes sad.
Draco woke with a start, pulled out of his dreams by a shout. For a moment he thought it was his; it wasn’t so unusual for him to cry out in his sleep. He looked around wildly, his eyes having trouble adjusting in the dark.
“That’s understandable,” Wolff nodded. “What else?”
Harry Potter I saw two nights ago, wasn’t it? How is he?”
“Morning,” Draco said and backed away, letting him in.
Draco and Leo had just finished tending to a patient when they were ambushed by both Ira and Betty in the corridor. Ira had a devious look on their face, and Betty’s cheeks were flushed. Draco raised an eyebrow. Whatever they wanted couldn’t
“Just one,” Harry interjected.
“Sorry, you
Would they be proud of him if they knew him today? Or would they, perhaps, be disgusted by what he’d become? Wonder how this could’ve happened to their only son?
“Muggles are wonderful, aren’t they?” she said admiringly. Luna picked up a package of vegan sausage from the meat counter, showing it to Harry. He nodded, and she put it back. “They can make anything vegan. I wish more magic folk cared about the welfare of creatures.”
“I – I don’t know,” Draco admitted. “I don’t know if I can.”
“I apologize for having to ask you all of these questions, especially at a time like this. I understand it’s a sensitive topic.”
He could hardly contain his anger - his disgust - as he fled the Great Hall. He didn't even care if this was undeniable "proof" that he couldn't eat properly; he had to get rid of it.
He was sitting near the lake and supporting this habit when Pansy sat down next to him and held her hand out. Draco passed his cigarette to her silently. Pansy lifted it to her lips and breathed in, eyes fluttering closed. She handed it back to Draco as he watched her, thinking about how she had admonished him when she first found out he smoked.
“I'm twenty-three. You're the same age as Draco, aren't you? I know you two were in the same year at, uh, Hogwarts.”
"Are you certain? You look a bit peaky."
"You must first understand that confidentiality is absolutely essential for this individual," Draco began, a slight frown on his face. He paused as the kettle poured tea into the teacup in front of him. He spooned a few cubes of sugar and stirred. "Thank you. As I was saying, he’s just very recently accepted help, so he’s still quite skittish. I believe his greatest concern is his privacy."
His heart was beating rapidly and his head was still throbbing with pain; Harry closed his eyes and leaned against the metal headboard.
Draco leant against the opposite side of the window Harry was standing at.
“Yeah I did,” said Ron. He watched Harry rub the affected area without remorse. “Bloody prat.”
“Erm – sorry, I um,” he stuttered, unsure of what to say.
“It’s not oversharing, you prat,” Harry murmured before leaning in to kiss those smirking lips.
"Vers."
Draco was put-off by how similar Potter’s words were to Draco’s line of thought just ten minutes ago. He couldn’t think of anything to say. His first instinct was to be defensive, but there seemed to be no fight in him left.
“It’s hardly morning, though, is it?”
“I’m certain you’ve heard the rumors. The myth,” Draco rolled his eyes, “That Potter has a Cloak of Invisibility. As in the one from
“Trust me, Sam.”
“You look a
“That’s completely different. But it was about this,” Harry said, closing his eyes. “Sort of. She just told me that even though you’d forgotten everything I’d done, she hadn’t. And she said that if I hurt you, she’d make me regret it.”
“Also,” Draco said, his eyes flickering towards Hermione, “I didn’t realize you were so weepy.”
Harry’s rigid cock was glistening; Draco took his eyes off it to glance at Harry, whose eyes were closed. His chest was rising and falling unevenly, and it gave Draco pleasure to know that it was him who was doing this to Harry, Draco who was making him so weak.
“Him, Malfoy,” he answered lowly. “I’m jealous of him.”
"Yeah, Ron mentioned it to me," she said, and at Harry's frown she said, "I'm his sister, Harry. And though it can be hard to tell, he really does have genuine feelings."
“Yeah, I am.”
“Where are your friends, Potter?” Draco asked, and Potter’s green eyes were on him again. “Your girlfriend? Do they know you’re tending to a Death Eater?”
Hermione was smiling slightly at Ron, her love for him clear on her face. She took his hand and began rubbing slow circles with her thumb. Harry's heart ached at the sight of it.
But Draco was only half-listening, preoccupied by his search.
She smiled at him kindly. “You’re welcome, Harry. You have a good day now.”
"I don't sound like that, you prat," Harry said, gently slapping Draco's arm.
“What?”
“Don’t look like that, Malfoy. You think I want you to be miserable?” Draco shook his head hollowly, and Potter continued in a matter-of-fact tone. “You’re right, you had to make hard choices – but in my eyes, you’ve already paid the price several times over. I mean you’re a bloody Healer now. And I won’t forget that you saved my life.”
Harry pulled the curtains closed around his bed before he went at Draco, pushing him down, kissing his mouth desperately. Draco leaned his head back as Harry’s kisses trailed down to his neck, lost in pleasure. Harry paused to pull back; Draco looked at him questioningly.
Draco kissed him back before pulling him down onto the couch. He positioned himself; going on his hands and knees and looking back at Leo expectantly.
The two of them loitered in a relatively quiet corner for a good hour, drinking and chatting and people-watching. They laughed at Blaise chatting up some Ravenclaw girl Draco barely recognized, and at Pansy and Daphne dancing unabashedly with what looked like a pair of Gryffindor seventh years.
Draco ducked his head and grimaced, uncertain of what to say. Ever since Potter had arrived at St. Mungo's, Draco's world had been knocked off-kilter.
“Wait,” said Potter as Draco turned away. “You don’t need to go.”
When Harry woke up the next morning, it was to an empty bed.
He liked learning as a child - it made his parents proud even though he always failed to surpass Granger in school. He didn’t like it as much now, just as he didn’t like much of the things he used to. He still had a knack for it, however, and thank Merlin for that.
“Yeah, I’m sure nearly killing two people is great experience,” Potter interrupted, his voice harsh. “Has everyone else here poisoned innocent people too, or are you just special, Malfoy?”
"Forgive me for wanting to make sure.”
“You’re treating Kreacher like he’s some animal,” Draco explained. “He’s smarter than some wizards out there. Of course he knows what fucking is, and that we’ve been doing it.”
Harry let out a shaky laugh as he turned to face them. “Sure, come on in, you lot. Why not?”
“Look –“
“Don’t be ridiculous, Potter – “ he began to say, but then he followed Potter’s line of sight and saw that Blaise was indeed talking to the youngest Weasley, his body a bit too close to hers for it to be deemed friendly. He let out a little laugh, unable to believe what he was seeing.
. I was too busy trying not to get killed by Voldemort for a good part of my life, and then…well really, I reckon I just like drugs.”
“Yeah, thanks Malfoy.”
, Draco typed, his palms sweaty. He entered in his address and hit send before he could rethink it.
"I might have had a recollection," Draco replied, his lips beautifully swollen.
He was horrified as soon as the words had left his mouth, but there was no taking them back. He barely breathed as he watched Potter process what he’d asked.
“Ok,” Harry said again, his voice low. “I’m ready.”
"Oh. Yes, I apologize. I didn't even realize," Draco said slowly, feeling his face heat up slightly.
Granger’s gaze snapped to Draco; she had been staring at Harry with an unreadable expression on her face. Good or bad, Draco didn’t know, but then, he didn’t know Granger much at all.
“So you've told me.”
Draco flushed as Harry raised his trembling hand to touch Draco’s face gingerly, that expression of awe still on his face.
“I agree,” Harry said matter-of-factly. “Luckily, this year is turning out to be better.”
“You’ve probably got a kitten to save, or an old witch to help across the street,” Draco said, rambling a little because of his nerves. “Shouldn’t be wasting time on some no-good ex-Death Eater.”
Potter’s attention returned to Draco. His brows were furrowed.
“Of course I did,” Hermione answered without shame. She finally wiped her tears away brusquely. “She has a right to know that you’re in hospital, and I figured she might be able to convince you.”
tell me,” Draco said, his patience running out, “And that’s why I’ve come to you.”
Harry looked like he wasn’t going to.
“Thank you, Harry,” Hermione beamed. “Hi, Malfoy.”
His breath smelled rancid and his arse was exceptionally sore, but Draco stayed. He rolled onto his side and watched Leonel sleep, feeling an ache settle in his chest.
“Saved your life, too,” Draco cut him off, lazily flapping Potter’s words away with a hand. “Yes, yes, I’ve heard it all before. Doesn’t mean you don’t hate me.”
“And the Weaslette?” Draco asked before he could stop himself. He didn’t see her now, and he wondered once again what her and Potter’s deal was.
“You don’t look so good.” His dark eyes were compassionate, his tone suddenly softer, and Draco was once again reminded why Leonel made such a good Healer. “You can still talk to me, Draco.”
Harry was barely listening. His curiosity was rapidly turning into annoyance, and his brain wasn’t nearly as hazy as before. Why was he here anyway? Sure, he might’ve wanted to come here a day ago (or whenever that was), but he was fine now, wasn’t he?
Noise filled the room as students began clearing their areas and packing up.
“What’s happened?”
to bed if you’d like, Potter,” offered Draco generously. “You don’t need to be…doing whatever it is you’re doing out here.”
Pansy huffed and turned to Draco.
A knock startled Draco out of his miserable thoughts
“Sorry – I was just hoping to talk to you. About Potter,” he added at her raised eyebrows.
Draco allowed himself be pulled, flashing Pansy an apologetic shrug.
“Stop,” Harry growled. “You weren’t one by force. It wasn’t like your life ambition was to be a fucking Death Eater, you weren’t – I dunno –
“I like it,” Draco admitted, feeling his face grow warm as he did so.
Her eyes grew even wider somehow.
Harry smiled tiredly, a small one, and stifled a yawn.
Draco crossed the space between them and kissed Harry, surprising him.
"I see," she said quietly after a moment.
“It’s true, Draco,” Pansy assured him. She narrowed her eyes at him, taking into account the jumper he hardly ever wore. “Oh, so you
Draco woke up with a pounding headache. He opened his eyes and was momentarily disarmed. This wasn’t his bed. Where was he?
Draco hesitated.
“I remember he’d come into work restless,” Weasley said, picking up where Granger left off. “Looking sort of drained, even though he told me he’d used Dreamless Sleep the night before. I reckon that’s when he started overusing it, to the point where it became a cycle. He’d come in, work his arse off, go home, do paperwork, take Dreamless Sleep, and go to bed. Every day.”
“’Was’ being the operative word.”
Ginny pressed a kiss to his temple. She smoothed his hair down and gripped his hand tighter.
Potter shook his head.
“Cait’s coming as well,” Damien said. At Harry’s confused look, he caught the attention of a thin white woman with blunt bangs. Harry thought he’d seen her speaking to Samuel before. “Oi, Cait!”
Draco quickly cast
“Ok. Fine. If you say so.”
“Malfoy?”
“His pulse is weak but it’s there.”
Draco was able to hear Potter’s annoyance just from him slowly breathing in and out.
After their near disastrous brunch, Harry made a point to see Hermione and Ron more often, having lunch with them on Sunday and going to the cinema on Tuesday.
“It’s true,” Hermione agreed. “It’s just – a shock, but if you two are serious, then I’ve got to do better. We both do,” she said to Ron, who nodded.
"Yes," he said without much conviction. "Kreacher's literally in the next room."
“Why do you think you deserve to bleed?”
“Me neither,” Leonel confessed. He turned down the volume before swiveling in his seat to face Draco. “Do we have to know now? We could always figure it out later.”
, Malfoy?”
Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco nodded; he understood, at least partially. But it was easier to admit to dating Harry Potter than dating Draco Malfoy.
Draco thought that perhaps he’d made a garbled choking noise, but really, who could fault him? It wasn’t as if Harry bloody Potter played with his hair every day.
“Right. Anyway, thanks.”
“Finally!” Pansy said, leaning back in her seat and stretching her arms out. “That only took ages to finish.”
Potter’s smile grew in a way that Draco really didn’t like, and then he stood up and offered his hand to Draco. He took it against his better judgment, and soon he was following Potter out of the eighth-year dormitory.
“Good night, Ron,” Harry said, and he was off again.
“I’m sorry if I scared you.”
Had it really been that long? It felt like it was just yesterday.
Harry had no intention of doing so but nodded anyway. Estrada left the room with one last reassuring smile.
Draco glanced back over at Leo and gave an apologetic shrug; Leo frowned but held his tongue, unable to say anything with their companions back in earshot.
“Harry? Come on, let’s sit down.”
“Really?” Potter asked flatly, disbelievingly.
“They’re brilliant. There’s Ron, who I’ve known him since I was eleven. He’s the funniest bloke I know and dead loyal. We used to mess around in school all the time…and there’s Hermione, who’s his wife, and I’ve known her just as long. She’s so clever and brave and I dunno what I’d do without her.”
“That isn’t all true, Harry, think. What did you do during your free time at Hogwarts?”
Harry finally put his hands down and peeked over at Draco.
"Fine," he replied curtly, his eyes dropping to his plate as he began eating again.
Potter avoided eye contact as he answered. “Said she was meeting you for a bite to eat and said I should come along. Better than being cooped up or whatever.”
“Shut up,” Draco whispered to himself.
“Malfoy? You alright?”
It didn’t matter much after the Easter holidays when he was forced to stay in the Manor. He felt sick just thinking about that time, how the days crawled past, how his mother had tried her best to comfort him when she herself was near breaking point, how
All the while, his eyes were glued to Malfoy’s back, burning a hole through his lime green robes. We wanted to say something to him – but what? He felt so incredibly stupid and desperately wished that he could take it all back. But from the six words he’d uttered to Harry, it was clear that Malfoy didn’t wish to talk to him.
“You’re seeing that Mind Healer again tomorrow, right?” asked Ron hesitantly.
Harry thought of Hermione and Ron.
Draco tried his hardest to meet Potter’s eyes, but the world was still spinning and there might have been two Potters in front of Draco right now.
“Turn around.” Draco looked up to meet Harry’s gaze, trusting, affectionate. “Go on.”
Ron whistled lowly.
“Well,” Malfoy said, clearing his throat and standing up even straighter. “This is it, Potter. I just wanted to say…it’s been a pleasure treating you and I am…very proud of all the progress you’ve made these past two weeks. And like I said, if you need anything, you can contact me anytime.”
Draco stopped walking. Pansy did too, and she looked up at him, brows furrowed, lips pulled into a frown.
Potter didn’t listen to him and stayed where he was, dark eyebrows furrowed again. Draco sat himself up wearily.
“Are you and Daphne heading back home tomorrow, then?” he asked her.
“Do you not agree?"
“Just…please…ignore everything I just said,” Draco said, feeling his cheeks heat up at an astonishing rate.
Harry inhaled at her count, his tongue still pressed against the back of his front teeth.
Harry felt a shiver go up his spine, his cock twitching in interest.
Harry couldn’t stop his face from heating up as he unrolled the letter.
Draco gave a short laugh. Potter went on, plucking pieces of grass from the ground.
“More than you’d like,” confessed Potter. “I know what went on the night Dumbledore died, and I know that Voldemort made you torture people.”
Harry shook her hand, hoping there wasn’t a horrible mixture of ash and sweat on his palm.
And before Draco could say another word, Harry went to catch Weasley and Granger as they exited the classroom.
“House stereotypes are tired and old, Draco,” he said firmly, and then added, “We don’t
“Harry? Are you and Draco all moved in?”
it, right?”
“And how do you propose I do that?”
“I know,” he said excitedly, eyes bright behind his glasses. “We can all go see the match together next week. Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw. What do you think?”
too many wands pointed right at him.
“Yes,” Draco answered. “Like I said, she has lots of experience and is one of the best in the field. I’ve already spoken to her and she’d be happy to have you as a patient. And of course, patient confidentiality is her highest priority, so you don’t need to worry about that.”
Ron was behind her, dreadfully pale.
sounded like he was asking you out on one.”
Draco panicked internally. He rubbed at his neck. He wondered momentarily if Harry had left any love bites visible. He had Harry’s scarf stuffed deep in his trunk, away from prying eyes, so he knew it couldn’t be that.
, is laughable.”
And to think, Draco had kept his own sexuality a secret – a heavy, dark knot in the pit of his stomach for five years. Meanwhile Harry seemed to have figured himself out in twenty-four hours.
She touched his hand once more. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”
believe,” Draco said. He paused, then said, “I could make a literal hat that says ‘Healer hat’ just to clarify, if you’d like. I’ll wear it every time I say something not-mean.”
He woke up.
Draco took a deep breath before turning to Weasley, who was staring at them with displeasure. Granger stood in the same place as before, that inscrutable expression still on her face.
been six years since we were even at school with him.”
“Catch me up, Draco. How were your holidays?” she inquired silkily, leading Draco back to the castle.
"Your vitals are excellent," Betty remarked as she let the clipboard swing back down and walked closer to him. She hugged her arms to her chest. "Mr. Potter? How are you?"
– “So I think it’s all right.”
She bit her lip. “No, I guess not. I reckon I’ll stay with Mum and Dad until you,” she nodded at Draco, “think Harry’s strong enough to be on his own. I love Ron and Hermione, but they’re never tough enough on him. I…need to stay.”
“I knew you didn’t exactly feel comfortable, despite what you said earlier today, so I kept it vague,” Harry told him. “And anyway, I’d sprung enough on them for one day. I don’t know how they’d react if I told them I was seeing
“As long as Harry needs me, I suppose. I’m not really certain.”
concerned about your mental health.”
Harry couldn’t breathe. In, out. It wasn’t supposed to be this hard.
He knew Draco would need one last pep talk before entering the Burrow, hence why Harry didn’t Apparate them right to the doorstep.
Draco wondered if this was going to be the case again, when Pansy turned toward him, a troubled expression on her face.
“Mmmph,” Harry said, then pulled away. His glasses were askew, and Draco still had his hands up his shirt, unwilling to let go. “We’re right in front of the window, Draco.”
“When did you know that you were, you know, er...” Harry trailed off.
?” Pansy repeated incredulously. “Were you even going to tell me?”
Draco took in the house, not even watching where he was going, his eyebrows pinching together.
“It seems the only medical records we have for Potter are outdated – they’re from Hogwarts and the Ministry.”
A warmness spread through Draco as he smiled back.
“Yes,” said Astoria.
“I still can’t believe he’d choose her of all people,” Daphne scoffed. “I can’t imagine his mother’s happy.”
“Mr. Potter?”
Draco gathered his nerve and knocked on the door with his free hand.
surviving, somehow. He wasn’t even fighting anymore. He just stood there, surrounded by bodies, alive and dead. It was a wonder he hadn’t been killed, and even more so that he wasn’t doing anything at all to increase his chances of living at this point. The fact was, he was much too preoccupied by the strange feeling inside him.
“Ginny’s also told us that you were thinking of going outside. Did that…ever happen?” asked Hermione in a small voice.
Harry wrote Ginny an owl on Monday evening, asking if he could come over whenever convenient. She wrote back with a note saying
“Draco,” Samuel said, and when Cait nodded, he smiled kindly. “I look forward to it.”
The meetings were held in a public library not far from Grimmauld Place. Going there by foot made for a nice walk, though it was a rather cool evening for September.
Draco felt his neck warm at that, an unwitting image of Ginevra placing Potter in handcuffs floating into his head.
“Me too.” Harry kissed Draco’s forehead. “But it’s dead now.”
“Yes, it suits you perfectly,” Blaise answered, though he was focused on flipping through
“Harry?”
His eyes flashed toward Kathy for a second, who nodded, and he went back to staring at the corner of the room.
He felt like he’d been reduced to just the worst parts of himself afterward coming back; his irritability, his lack of control, his guilt, suspicion, and hopelessness. He couldn’t do that to her. He couldn’t force her to stay with him and care for him when he didn’t even care for himself.
He watched as his eagle owl flew off into the sunrise and stayed there another minute before leaving.
“So how long until you
“We had an actual…conversation yesterday. Early this morning, if you want to be technical.”
“I know,” Draco murmured, crawling over to cup Harry’s face in his hand. Harry shivered. “And we can continue, or we can move on.”
“God,” Harry choked out, and went to stroke his cock.
He walked away and began putting the books back in their rightful places. It took him quite a while; he couldn’t figure out which section one certain book belonged to. He ended up having to ask Madam Pince about it, who was unsurprisingly displeased. Draco waited patiently as she examined the inside covers and muttered under her breath about how irresponsible students shouldn’t be taking books if they couldn’t even put them back correctly.
“Come, Ginny. I think our presence would be better received elsewhere.”
“You can’t rope me into this!” Leo argued.
Something about the sincerity in Estrada’s voice stopped Harry from arguing even more. The anger was slowly draining from his body and mind, and soon all that was left was the sickening pounding of his heart and the trembling in his hands.
Potter made an exasperated noise somewhere between a laugh and a sigh. Then he finally sat back against the wall and uncomfortably close to Draco with their arms nearly touching. Draco remembered how he’d been lying in Potter’s lap maybe fifteen minutes ago and wished he hadn’t ruined it by having to go vomit. He liked
Harry wasn’t exactly sure of proper etiquette of two mentally ill people talking about being mentally ill, so he just said, “Oh.”
“Broke the place in.”
His words, though unsaid, hung in the air.
Harry studied Malfoy. To be honest, he hadn’t given much thought to the Malfoy family after the trials. He’d spoken in support of Draco and Narcissa, explaining what they’d done for him, how he wouldn’t be alive if it wasn’t for them. But after that, their family didn’t often cross his mind.
“Fine, they’re also for losers.”
“Come in if you must,” said Draco before he thought better of it.
The Healers led the stretcher into the room as instructed. Once in, they levitated Potter onto the bed and continued to cast more diagnostic spells.
Harry had become again. His warmth was contagious, slowly thawing Draco out, piece by piece.
he wanted to be numb again. He didn’t have the energy or strength to revisit old memories; that was the point of all the potions and alcohol in the first place – to forget them.
“Your first friend?” Draco asked, forgetting his irritation.
. He was a Death Eater, for Christ’s sake,” Hermione said lowly, her eyebrows drawn together.
“It’s fine,” she went on, holding up a hand. “I’m completely over you, you dick.”
“Oh, Draco, you’re so much softer than I ever thought you would be,” Ira said.
“Harry?”
“Well, yeah, but…just forget about it, Malfoy. The rumors you spread in school don’t keep me up at night.”
“That’s great,” Kathy smiled. “You deserve it.”
"You are a grown man," Draco muttered to himself as he fell into bed. "He's a busy person, and it's late. Shut up."
He still wasn’t used to hearing Harry saying his name, especially not like this, it was so hot, Draco needed him, he felt so good inside him.
“Wha – Potter, what are you doing?” Draco hissed, though he allowed himself to be taken down the hall.
“Luna.”
“Of course, Draco. I hope you can find a way for you to be able to spend time together without it being painful.”
A small, sleepy grunt came from Leo, and he stirred in his sleep. Draco sighed, using his free hand to get the hair out of Leo’s face. The curls weren’t so tight now, thanks to Draco's insistent fingers, and looked a lot less lively because of it.
Draco cleared his throat and looked away, his eyes suddenly stinging. He was surprised at himself, and it seemed that Ira was too. He clenched his jaw and blinked rapidly, willing himself not to
“You really know how to charm a man, Potter.”
Draco thought about this.
“Merlin, I’m an idiot,” he said for the third time in the same amount of minutes. “I don’t know why I never returned it earlier, I just completely forgot about it. Draco, I’m sorry.”
“Thank you for having me, Mrs. Weasley,” Draco said quietly, hardly daring to look the woman in the eyes. “It’s very gracious of you.”
himself, hated what he’d done, what he’d become, and how he couldn’t just
“And you as well. You look…well,” Draco finished feebly, his face positively on fire.
He tried for a smile. Draco looked even less convinced.
"It's alright, Leo. Just...don’t do it again."
Draco didn’t blame Harry for giving him a doubtful look.
“Sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.”
“Sorry about that,” Harry said, gesturing downstairs.
“Still glad you asked? Now you know some junkie loser fancies you and –“
Remember when I was like "wow it's been almost a year since I posted, that's so wild, hahaha" and then I did it again?
Pansy raised her eyebrows.
“Really? Oh, thank Merlin, sometimes it feels like I’m the only one who remembers what happened. Or the only one who cares.”
“No,” Draco said defensively, though he had no reason to feel embarrassed. He was seeing Wolff when he and Leonel were dating, anyway. “I asked if she would agree to see Potter.”
“Come on,” Weasley then said. “You deserve a break as much as anyone. You’re wound up tighter than…I dunno. You might be wound tighter than anyone I know. And I’m engaged to this one.”
She smiled.
It wasn’t becoming any easier, he reflected. It wasn’t like he expected an immediate return to his earlier years at Hogwarts, but watching the rest of the school carry on made shame and anger rise in him. And it wasn’t just the Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, and Hufflepuffs. Sure, Slytherins were subdued compared to the rest, but they could eat. They could study. They could carry on a conversation with their friends. Draco, on the other hand, found these things near impossible.
“A Mind Healer, then.”
“Yeah, alright, we get it,” Harry quickly interrupted. “Harry Potter’s a giant prat, we know this. Why am I here again?”
anymore. I’d say that’s a compliment.”
“What else?” Draco muttered. And then the thoughts that had been running through his head flew out of his mouth before he could stop them. “Merlin, I never thought I’d see him again, which was foolish of me in hindsight, I suppose, but like
Draco flushed further.
“You’ve
“I just can’t believe it.”
“We’ll be right outside.” Hermione gave him a small smile.
“It’s fine,” Draco said. “Although, I must say, that wasn’t very Gryffindor of you.”
“Oh, but I’m hoping that you do,” Cait said, smiling her wicked smile again.
Ira regarded him carefully.
Harry wondered if Ginny had said anything to Ron, but judging by the way he was greeted when he walked in (normally), he figured she hadn’t.
Malfoy gave Harry a look he couldn’t quite read, then looked down at his watch again.
When he woke next, Harry felt slightly better.
He could hear the muffled rhythm of David Bowie’s
Dazed, he escaped into his room, telling himself he wouldn’t come out until the high wore off.
“Never mind,” Draco said. “Professor Snape came and fixed me, and now I’m sitting here with you, alive. So drop it.”
, Draco reminded himself.
They stared at him, and he stared back. Granger looked the same as ever, her defiant gaze on him unwavering. Her thick hair was pulled back from her face and she wore a thick Muggle jacket. Weasley stood next to her, arms crossed tightly, looking like some apprehensive bodyguard. His expression was full of suspicion as he stared at Draco, like he might attack them at any moment.
“We went to school together,” Malfoy supplied.
“Oh, wonderful,” she rubbed her hands and leaned in even closer. “Well, Potter…”
“No.”
“What happened to him?”
Draco turned around to glower down at Potter, who was standing a few steps below Draco, concern written plainly on his face. For a moment, Draco wanted to run to his room and lock the door behind him when he thought of how he’d wept into Potter’s arms like a child the last time they had spoken, but he held his ground. Draco did what he knew, what had been drilled into him as a child, and lifted his chin and looked down his nose at Potter.
“You went behind my back. You took advantage of my trust,” Ginny said, backing him into a wall. He hit it with a thud and shook his head desperately, trying to deny it all. She cut him off before he could even start, however, snapping, “Don’t lie to me, Harry. I can fucking
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, hitting his head against his fisted hands.
When he entered the room, Potter glared at him tiredly from his bed.
“Er, yeah!” Harry’s voice was thick with sleep, and Draco’s cock reacted. This wasn’t the time.
“Work?”
“It’ll be fine, Draco. Worst case, I buy Seamus a new bottle.”
“I will, Potter,” Draco nodded. He wrapped up his éclair in a napkin and frowned at Potter apologetically. “But I do really have to go, I’m sorry.”
She gave him a sympathetic look before stepping out to presumably call him over. The prat came in a few seconds later, looking self-important as he unshrunk the notes that he kept in his pocket. He glanced up, his eyes widening a bit as they caught sight of Hermione and Ron.
Well, he never really had much time to be a regular person, did he? Harry’s thoughts turned bitter, and it must have showed on his face, for Wolff frowned.
Malfoy said Wolff would help, didn’t he? He apparently knew from first-hand experience that she was a good Mind Healer. But that was Malfoy.
; Gin made me stop. I was sort of, er, well, a nightmare. No pun intended.”
- Halloween actually fell on a Monday in 2005, but I'm 100% ignoring that for plot reasons. Sorry xoxoxo
She placed a bowl of porridge, an orange, and a glass of pumpkin juice on the tray that was now floating above Harry’s lap.
He pushed himself off the wall and made his way to the closest entrance.
He took a deep, fortifying breath. He wouldn’t.
He blinked at her and straightened, pulling his leg away from Draco.
“I had one earlier,” Harry said, “But it’s mostly gone now.”
Draco knocked on Potter’s door and came inside, wondering how Potter would be feeling today. He got his answer immediately.
"I dunno, if I was in a Muggle club or something like that. It's been a while, though."
“Are you close?”
“Thank you for sharing, Harry.”
“Oh,” Draco said, “Well.”
“Sort of. It was kind of bad yesterday, but not so bad it interfered with everything. Today, though, I can’t focus on anything…” Potter trailed off.
“Oh my god!” he shouted, effectively waking himself and Draco, who let out a string of mumbles and grunts. “Fuck.”
“What led to your, well, epiphany?” Draco asked.
“Yeah, alright.” He looked Malfoy square in the eye. “Good.”
“Yes.”
Harry hesitated. “I dunno.”
“It’s part of it,” Harry said, his speech slightly slurred now. “Your hair looks great like that, all loose and erm...you’re ignoring the rest.”
Pansy and Blaise were the only people he could feel comfortable enough to talk to, but even conversation with them felt forced more often than not. He could feel Pansy’s worried gaze on him frequently, and she’d tried to get him to open up several times. Even Blaise had tried to start a few conversations with him, sent by Pansy, no doubt.
“God, you’re hot,” Leonel murmured, his hands now traveling beneath Draco’s shirt.
Draco fell into bed beside him, his face beautiful and exhausted.
Harry was still fatigued most of the time, sometimes feeling as though he might pass out any second. The worst was when he’d get shooting pains throughout his body – starting from the back of his head and running down his neck and spine. What had started as simple headaches evolved into these debilitating pains that sometimes didn’t allow him to do anything but lie on his back and wait for them to end. He’d asked Malfoy about it yesterday morning, and he told Harry that they were called waves, which was an incredibly misleading name in Harry’s opinion.
“Let’s just keep snogging,” Draco suggested.
Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. “I’ve been lying to them and practically ignoring them for years now. I’ve made more effort to see my dealers than the two people who were with me during the most important parts of my life. I left their engagement party early to drink
Potter ran his hands through his hair. Draco wondered when he had picked up this habit; maybe last year, when his hair had grown past its usual length. He was pulled out of his thoughts when Potter spoke loudly.
Malfoy sat down at one of the chairs in front of Harry, rather too close for comfort. He opened up the file folder and withdrew a piece of parchment; he set it on top of the closed file and pulled out a self-inking quill. Harry sat back on the bed, the sight of his and Malfoy’s knees so close together unsettling him.
"Good?" Johnny asked.
“Git.”
They only parted when they heard a cough and a stifled giggle. Harry froze and Draco scrambled away but it was much too late; Macmillan and Abbott had clearly caught them snogging. Macmillan's face was a deep pink and Abbott had her hand over her mouth, failing miserably in stopping the giggles from escaping her.
“What?”
“So it’s true. What’s Harry Potter doing here?”
“I reckon…yeah. But I don’t know if he does,” Harry said slowly.
Draco made a note of that.
Granger was furious, her brown eyes blazing as she rounded on him.
right now, I’d probably be jealous.”
“Are you alright?” she had asked, coming closer.
“It’s just, er, well, I think it’s nice,” said Potter with difficulty.
“Cloak?”
Now only a foot away, Harry took Draco’s hands from his sides and pinned each to the wall by the wrists. Draco moaned as Harry kissed him with fervor, sticking his thigh between Draco’s legs. He didn’t try to resist in the slightest; he simply gave in.
Draco’s cloak fell to the floor. He kicked off his shoes as Harry pulled off his hoodie, revealing a thin, long-sleeved shirt underneath. Draco’s eyes were drawn to the stretch of skin that peeked out as Harry raised his arms, and he felt his cock grow even harder.
Harry resisted the urge to laugh. He felt anxious all the time, except perhaps when he was on calming potions.
“I look forward to it,” Draco said flatly.
“Just weed and vodka,” Harry answered, then frowned. “Mostly just have a headache right now, though.”
Draco responded with a moan, one that made Harry think that eating arse was his most favorite hobby, though that couldn't possibly be true.
Draco gritted his teeth, reminding himself that Potter was a patient, a
It was ridiculous, he knew, but he was a ridiculous person. Pansy had told him just how ridiculous he was being when he explained his predicament, and urged him to ask Harry as soon as he could. He agreed, knowing he shouldn’t put off answering his mother any longer.
you do?”
No, not awful. There wasn’t a word good enough to encapsulate just how terrible he felt. His entire body hurt as if he’d been run over by a hoard of hippogriffs, even though he hadn’t done anything out of the ordinary yesterday. His mind felt heavy, bogged down, already worn out even though he’d barely started his day.
After climbing up too many stairs, Harry pushed open the door at the top of the tower. Draco watched him look around before turning to Draco.
She was wonderful, though. She’d try to cheer him up, she’d try to distract him, and she’d soothe him when he woke up screaming – and this happened more often than not. She’d try to get him outside, to get him talking to people, talking to Teddy. She’d calm him down when he had panic attacks, when he’d get headaches and fear Voldemort was coming back again.
“I agree,” said Harry, who was still cringing in his seat. “Think you should discontinue that, er, other one.”
“Sort of nauseous,” Harry bit out. “Not that bad.”
Draco fished them from the bedside table and handed them to Harry, who put them on. Harry smiled as soon as his eyes focused on Draco, who was now lying facing him.
Harry released him after a few more moments. Draco mourned the loss.
“You alright, Malfoy?”
“You’re staring,” Malfoy said, perfect eyebrow raised.
that he hadn’t gotten around to binning yet; if he remembered correctly, there was a mention of Potter in it…
Did they have surrogates in the wizarding world? Harry pushed the question out of his mind.
“Wipe that look off your face,” Draco drawled. “It’s unbecoming.”
But some part of him knew that he
“Good, good,” Scarlett said, returning her gaze to Draco. “Now I’d like to
Dinner went well.
again.”
“Is Selina coming?” Leo asked.
“Yeah,” he nodded. “She’s in a relationship.”
Warmth spread through Draco, and he wished he could stay here forever. He knew better than that, though.
“What type of tea, Draco?”
“How did you even notice this?”
“Fuck.”
It was short-lived but intense; it began when they spent Leonel’s first few months at St. Mungo’s flirting nonstop (he’d transferred from a wizarding hospital in the States). They could barely keep their hands off each other, taking advantage of every possible moment they had free. They thrived off each other’s wit and passion, their ability to talk about the same subject with each other for ages, and how they could have sex multiple times a day before finally tiring. Predictably, though, their relationship had fizzled out after six months, leaving them good friends and better colleagues.
He still felt shaken up, but he knew Hermione and Ron would be anxious to know how the appointment had gone. Harry had told them about it yesterday during their visit, feeling strange as he did so. Hermione and Ron took it in stride, however, and reassured him that it was the right thing to do. Still, he didn’t know if he could handle the both of them right now.
Harry nodded, and Malfoy cast the Disillusionment charm once more. The walk back to Harry’s room was quick and soon they were inside. Malfoy undid the charm.
Harry gave him two fingers.
“Come on.”
would have used it.”
“Siddown, mate,” Johnny said. When Harry did, he continued, “How long’s it been, Harry? A month? You haven’t answered any calls.”
His mind drifted to his mother; he hoped that she was doing well. He had sent her a letter a week ago but she hadn’t written back yet. She also worried about him, and he also wished she wouldn’t. It was much easier to evade his mother than Pansy, however, so he had to be thankful for the little things.
Various sounds of agreement emerged from the group. Harry was too busy staring at Kathy and pretending like everything was Fine to answer.
Maybe it was Ginny, maybe it was her bullshit words, maybe it was her yelling, or maybe it was his pounding headache. And it could have been a dozen other things but that didn’t really matter right now because he felt himself fall apart.
“I’m sorry you got saddled with me. I’m sure it’s much more than what you signed up for.”
“I’ll have someone bring you a nourishment potion, just in case,” Malfoy said, nodding to himself. He looked up, tucking his parchment underneath his left arm and withdrawing his wand. “I’m just going to check vitals.”
Draco turned to face Harry once more. He was still fast asleep. Draco grimaced, not wanting to rouse him; he looked so peaceful.
Draco nodded, hating himself.
“Fascinating,” Ginny murmured. “Dad would love this stuff. Not the drugs, the labels. It’s like a different language.”
Harry turned his head to look up at him. He cocked an eyebrow. “You like that?”
Draco’s heart was racing. Was it acceptable for him to see Harry again so soon? And Merlin, his flat was a mess. He’d have to clean up if Harry was coming over. Oh, what was he thinking? This was ridiculous. Harry was ridiculous.
person, Harry, and you haven’t caused any deaths. You have nothing to feel guilty about.”
Samuel simply shook his head. “You’re a complicated man, Harry. I feel like the more I learn about you, the less I know.”
Harry wondered eagerly.
Hermione was looking at him from across the coffee table. Harry didn’t have to ask her to clarify what “it” was. He knew what she was talking about, and that she was using her casual voice, the one she used when she tried to keep her curiosity under wraps. Ron’s attention turned to Harry as well, though his curiosity was much more obvious, all wide eyes and slowed chewing.
“Fuck,” Draco said softly, his voice heaven to Harry’s ears.
Harry was shocked and a bit hurt; his hands fell limply into his lap. It must have shown on his face because Draco looked away, his jaw working tensely.
Wait…had he just…?
Harry shrugged. He rubbed at his eyes from underneath his glasses and looked at Ginny, his mind blank.
And then Harry got even more of Draco’s cock in his mouth and it felt so good, so warm, and Draco’s bed arched slightly on his bed. Merlin, has a blowjob ever felt this good? He didn’t know it was possible.
“If it helps, we’ll do anything.”
“What? Speak parseltongue? No.”
“What do you think I’m doing?”
“She said she had to ‘leave,’” he explained as Draco sat down slowly, placing air quotes around the last word. “As if this wasn’t just a big ploy to get us together.”
“Why do you think that was?” she asked seriously.
Harry wouldn't say it aloud, but he
“Draco.” She sighed. “I’m sorry. I was out of line. You’re an adult, and I have to trust that you can make the right decisions on your own. I was just worried about you…but if you say your relationship with Potter isn’t unhealthy, then I believe you.”
Potter must have noticed, because he added on, "But I'm the one here who's a drug addict, so I reckon I shouldn't be making judgements."
Fourteen hours wasn’t even that much compared to some days, but all Draco wanted to do was go home, change out of his robes, and collapse into bed. He did
have feelings for Malfoy?"
For example, Betty had opened up brilliantly by the time she’d finished her drink. She could actually talk to Draco without blushing, which did wonders for the quality and length of their conversations.
The smile left Harry’s face and was quickly replaced by a frown.
“Fair’s fair, Malfoy,” Harry said, tugging on Draco’s own shirt and smiling smugly as Draco’s pupils darkened.
“As am I,” Draco said. He checked the clock. “Pass me the lavender, Potter.”
“Right,” Draco said, his focus back on Harry. “It won’t be pleasant at first. It might be painful. But you tell me as soon as it hurts too much, alright?”
“I…” Draco hesitated. “I don’t know.”
“Sure.”
“Merlin, you’re so pretty, Draco,” Harry said, eyes bright as he sat up fully and moved closer. He continued talking in a breathy voice that went straight to Draco’s cock. “You’re so beautiful, it kills me every time I see you, I still can’t believe how fucking beautiful you are…”
And then Draco began grinding against him, his hands gripping Harry’s shoulders tightly.
His miserable thoughts were interrupted by a low, quick knock and Betty entering the room. Harry had expected her; he'd become quite good at discerning whose knocks were whose, as sad as it was.
“No,” Draco said loudly. “I’d really rather hear about anything else in the world.”
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine at Harry’s low, husky voice and glanced away, fearing Harry would be able to see the flush on his cheeks.
Draco rubbed subconsciously at his uncovered forearm.
“Fuck off, Malfoy. You don’t know shit about me,” Harry growled, wanting to scare Malfoy into showing some sort of emotion – anything other than this infuriating blank stare he was currently getting.
They both started and looked over at Blaise, who was observing them with a satisfied expression on his face.
“Yeah.”
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and patted the pockets of his trousers impatiently, feeling for his smokes, as Harry sputtered.
“Merlin,” Harry sighed as he ran a hand through his wild hair. “That was a close one.”
“Not much, really,” Harry said. “I meet with friends sometimes, I read, I listen to old records…”
“What’re you doing here? I didn’t know you shopped at Muggle stores.”
“Oh yes, well,” Luna said, looking at him with her wide eyes. She was dressed in Muggle clothing, though there was still something quite odd and Luna-esque about them, “I find that Muggles have a wider collection of what they call ‘vegan’ food. Do you know what that is, Harry?”
Ira laughed and put an arm round her shoulders.
“That you’d be interested in him. Sodding Draco Malfoy. Remember when you talked about him
“He’s put you in the hospital!” Pansy’s voice rose and she stepped closer, her eyes blazing.
“Draco – “
When Draco exited the bathroom, he couldn’t even pretend to be surprised to see Potter waiting outside. He self-consciously brushed his still-wet hair away from his face and headed over to the other man, sitting where he’d also sat that one morning.
Malfoy unzipped Harry’s trousers, finally letting Harry's throbbing cock out in the open. Hard and swollen, Harry gasped as Malfoy took it in his palm. God, he was so fucking hot; that masculine yet graceful hand taking control, its arm covered in dark ink. Malfoy expertly slid the pre-come over Harry’s cock, and even that was heaven to Harry.
Potter was much thinner than he had been before his disappearance, which was saying something – he’d always been a bit scrawny. His face was gaunt; his hollowed cheeks and chapped lips made Draco’s heart fall. His light brown skin was covered in a thin sheen of sweat, his unwashed hair sticking to his forehead. He also had a fair bit of unruly facial hair.
Though really, he should be saying men and women by now. That’s what they were, weren’t they, at the age of eighteen?
“Man, I’m jealous. Do you want something to drink, by the way?” He rummaged around the kitchen, searching for beverages. “We’ve got…wine, some vodka…and…water.”
“Interesting,” murmured Draco. He looked up at Leonel, who was now watching him. “What do they do at the Ministry?”
“What is this?” he asked as he stepped closer.
“Ready?”
Harry shuddered and cursed under his breath. Encouraged, Draco continued to work Harry open, lapping and teasing. Draco's hands were now gripping Harry's arse tight; his fingertips pressing deep into the skin. When Harry subconsciously pressed his arse into Draco's face, Draco retaliated by sticking his tongue inside.
“I think you’re an annoying git with a savior complex,” tried Draco, “Who doesn’t know when to leave well enough alone.”
“Draco,” said Leo in a long-suffering way, “You’re not fooling anyone.”
him to eat or go to Pomfrey? Who did he think he was?
he was.
Across the room, Potter looked comfortable, surrounded by the ever-present Weasley and Granger. He didn’t seem perturbed. Of course, he had no reason to be. He was on the right side of the war all along. He wasn’t part of a previously feared family that had lost nearly everything after the war. His skin wasn’t marred by the barely-faded mark that branded him as the enemy. He wasn’t a fucking Death Eater. He was the Chosen One, savior of the wizarding world. He was good and pure, and Draco was dirt.
“That’d be an understatement,” Harry murmured. “Take that off too.”
"You're alright, Harry. I'm here."
Harry was staring nervously at him. He had to say something, something to reassure him...
“Fuck you,” he spat at her.
“Clearly.”
Draco checked his arms, leaving pink and white marks where he pressed his fingers into his flesh. He stared at his stomach, no longer as concave as it once was. He looked into his own fearful eyes as he wracked his reflection up and down. His eyes looked sunken, heavy bags beneath them, his cheekbones making him gaunt.
“Me too,” cut in Draco.
“Pineapple and mango,” Ginny replied.
“Hello, hello.”
He finally settled on saying quietly, “Took you long enough.”
“I’ve given you it and look what happened! You look awful, Draco. Just let me help.”
“Well,
“You know I feel, Malfoy? I feel clear-headed for the first time in years. You're right. I was in a haze. That's why I know what I want so clearly.”
Draco smiled and nodded slightly. “What else would you like to talk about?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said quietly after a moment.
Harry went on sucking and Draco closed his eyes, consumed by pleasure. He kept on going, trying different techniques as Draco made small sounds of contentment.
Draco flushed, embarrassed because he really didn’t mean to say all that. Harry was looking at him curiously.
At that moment, a bushy-haired individual came at them, followed by a taller, red-headed person.
Harry tossed and turned repeatedly, growing increasingly irritated as time passed. Finally, he gave up and chose instead to stare at the ceiling.
“No, a –“ He couldn’t come up with a witty retort in time, for Ginny asked,
“Well,” Draco said hesitantly, “I suppose that after everything, an actual conversation is long overdue.”
Apparently having noticed Draco not sitting beside him, Potter turned to look back at him.
Everything he forced in his mouth was tasteless, though he didn’t care much as his appetite started an infrequent schedule of coming and going two years ago. He wished he could bury himself in his studies, but his mind wandered too often and he could barely scrape up the energy to attend his classes, let alone do all his homework.
“It’s so good to have you with us, Harry,” Katherine said. “Oh, but please call me Kathy. I’d like us all to be comfortable with one another.”
“Fine, I just don’t want to, alright?” he asked, turning his head back around to meet her stony gaze. “Now kindly fuck off, would you? I’ve had a long enough day even without Potter interrogating me before this –“
"Come in." She waved him in and stood up, disappearing from sight.
“It should change,” said Harry firmly. “There should be help for people who need it.”
“No, I just had a question about…” Leonel trailed off at the look on Draco’s face. “Are you ok?”
“Alright, I’ll be right back with those waters. Thank you, gentlemen.”
“When did you start noticing these changes? The new potions?”
“Malfoy,” Weasley nodded. “What’s happened?”
Draco hummed in response.
He blinked at the sunlight coming in though the blinds, eyes adjusting to the harsh light that woke him up before unsticking the notes from his cheek. Draco checked his wristwatch – it was barely six in the morning.
“I’m going to…I’ll just be…”
“Face it. You might as well give up.”
Draco’s face was hidden, his hair falling in his face as he picked up his day-old clothes from where they sat on the floor. He nodded.
"What is it, mate?" Ron asked, face serious.
Harry went on as if Draco had responded.
“All these tricks up your sleeve,” Draco murmured. He pulled Harry back down again. “You really are sneaky.”
Harry’s eyebrows drew together, and then he froze momentarily before a sly smile began to grow on his face. Draco froze too, because he knew exactly what that expression meant.
Potter opened the door a moment later looking incredibly groggy. His hair was wilder than usual and he was wearing what Draco assumed to be his pajamas.
“No, I can do this. I need this,” he added.
“Wha – how?”
“Hm,” said Harry.
Harry was looking at him curiously. “Did I say – say something wrong?”
“Maybe they needed
“Yes,” Draco said, and this time, he was ready.
“Are the young masters hungry?” Kreacher asked, his eyes shifting to Harry.
“I think I would’ve cursed them, so I’ve got you beat,” Draco countered.
“Morning.”
He brandished his left forearm then, his face burning up as he pulled his sleeve back and Potter looked down at the faded red Mark impassively. Draco’s heart was still racing as he pushed the sleeve back down and lowered his arms.
She shrugged, frowning a bit as she glanced over at Blaise.
a bit longer. Looser, too. And though it was hard to tell given the black puff coat that obscured his body, he might have been a bit thinner.
“But I have.” Harry’s voice was muffled. “So many people are dead, and they’d all be alive if it weren’t for me. I should – I should be dead too.”
“Ok,” Draco murmured. He withdrew his fingers and slowly slid his cock in Harry – had Draco ever experienced something so
Harry had firmly told her
Harry agreed, though not as enthusiastically as before.
Harry approached Draco and tugged on his shirt insistently. His lips ghosted against Draco’s neck; Draco shivered.
“I know,” Harry sighed. He hesitated and looked over his shoulder to where Draco was standing, invisible. “Look, can we talk about this later? I’m knackered, and I just want to sleep.”
Draco’s heart fluttered at the thought that Potter noticed his absence.
“But that’s just it, Harry. You’ve done nothing wrong, it’s just
“So, er, how long have you been coming to this group?”
Draco blinked. What did that have to do with anything?
“What is it, Weasley?” he asked tensely.
He quickly cast an
“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Leo grinned, and Draco thought of how similar the sight was to his dream.
He pushed Harry’s legs apart with firm hands, exposing his hole. Normally, Harry would’ve been self-conscious in such a vulnerable position but right now he was just filled with a desperate need to, well, be filled.
“It’s not your fault,” Draco said, dismissing it with a wave of his hand. “It can hardly be avoided with Potter here in the ward. You’re lucky you were on the other side of the world for it all.”
Draco opened up a cabinet and retrieved the box of chamomile.
“Because you
“Be easy on him,” she said softly. Her eyes searched him – for what? “Bye, Malfoy.”
“There were two ingredients that had the potential to be deadly when mixed,” Hermione explained. “I’m sure that’s why they had to perform the cleansing procedure.”
“He hasn’t been as talkative,” Draco said. “He’s become closed off again, similar to how he was in the beginning. Just the day before yesterday we were having conversations, but now…”
Unable to articulate any of his feelings, Draco took Harry’s face in his hands and kissed him hard. His fingers brushed against the stubble on Harry’s cheeks, which also scraped gently against Draco’s own smooth-shaven face. He nudged Harry’s mouth open and kissed him deeper, coaxing a moan from him.
Malfoy’s lips in a flat line, he nodded once.
“We’re going to do this three more times. Right. Inhale. One…two…three…four. Hold it…one…two…three…four…five…six…seven. And exhale. One…two…three…four…five…six…seven…eight.”
Harry made a sound and turned around. “Could you do that cleaning spell?”
“Hey!” Harry protested, but Ginny paid him no mind.
He moved their hands so Harry’s hand was turned up over Draco’s lap. Draco examined the back of Harry’s hand, ignoring Harry’s soft
“It’s all right that you’re sort of…moving in when we’ve only been dating a week, right?”
“Not that it’s any of your business-“ Draco began to say as Pansy shot Blaise a look, “But, well, actually, it’s none of your business.”
Potter’s frown deepened. “Ron and Hermione are…
“I suppose so,” Draco answered with an amused smile on his face. “You finally wore me down.”
Warning: lots of talk about drugs in this one
of the Floo before speaking.
“I really like you too,” Draco returned, caught off guard. Then he thought, if this is what Harry wanted – to be distracted – Draco could give that to him. He could do that for him. “I have for too long, to be honest.”
“Right,” Samuel grinned. “Thanks, everyone.”
“Huh? Yeah, why?” he asked, panic washing over him and disturbing what had been a pleasant high.
Ron flushed, and Hermione was halfway between a gasp and a laugh.
“I saw him there the first time I went,” Harry explained when they didn’t say anything, “And I wanted to tell you, but there’s group confidentiality…I’m sorry.”
“They’re wrong.”
“You like that, don’t you?” Malfoy murmured, his eyes glittering as he watched Harry.
“We can go back inside if you’d like,” Draco offered.
“I think he’s still with his new Gyffindor plaything,” Daphne responded in a bored tone.
“Minimum,” Malfoy said, lips twisting into a frown.
“Fine.”
“C’mon, sit down.”
So naturally, he shouldn’t have been surprised when he fell to the floor simply after being hit by a moderate stinging hex, but he was.
Harry was filled with dread.
Sorry this is so late, a lot is happening in my life. I've never written Luna before this fic so if she's OOC I apologize. Thanks for being patient, and thanks for all the comments/subs/kudos ❤
Harry ran a hand through his hair and looked off at the wall, trying to remember when he'd first used Muggle drugs.
Draco shook his head. “No, Sir, Potter’s just being modest.”
“Julia Wolff’s office,” Harry snapped, and when the flames turned green, he stepped in without a backwards glance.
Harry shook his head, his throat too tight to speak.
“High praise, coming from you,” Harry grinned.
Draco nodded and finished the rest of his tea. "Thank you, Healer Wolff."
Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and tugged on it slightly.
“How’s it looking, Healer?” Potter asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.
“Well, I reckon I started coming here halfway through my third year at uni, so…almost a year.”
“And yet, you still speak of him in this way. You say he’s rude and arrogant.”
“Oh,” Potter said, and bit his lip. “Wanted to say hi. I said I’d see you later, didn’t I?”
“Talking…about it,” Potter responded, averting his eyes.
, I do,” Draco cut across him, not wanting to hear it.
“It really is complicated, Sam,” Harry said. He ran a hand through his hair. It’d be so much easier if he could talk freely about magic with Muggles but he knew that could be disastrous in so many ways. “We went to school together, this private school in Scotland, and we were er, rivals, I guess.”
“Stop that,” said Draco.
When Draco furrowed his brows in confusion, Potter smiled just a bit.
Draco sucked even harder and swirled his tongue around the head. Harry’s hand was tangled in Draco’s hair now, and he pulled. Draco moaned around Harry’s cock and sucked even harder in retaliation, taking as much of Harry as he could.
“It just so happens that people from different, well, upbringings can attend the same school, Cait,” Malfoy said. “Now can we move on?”
Draco raised an eyebrow and let out a short laugh.
Harry nodded. So Malfoy’s been coming to these meetings for almost a year as well. He wondered why he cared.
“Why?” Harry repeated with a faint smile. “How could I not? You’re...incredible, Draco.”
“I never said it was bad,” Leo said, coming closer and kissing Draco fiercely.
“You could borrow some of mine?”
Yes, Harry thought drowsily, it was alright. Just this once. And besides, he had a good enough reason, didn’t he?
“Yes, I’d gone to visit her. I want to work on my fears or whatever,” he gave a little scowl at this, “And I believed that my old home would be a good place to start.”
Malfoy nodded. "Very well. I'll let the department head know. Is there anything else I can do for you at the moment?"
Belatedly, he recognized the sound of a door opening and closing and realized that they were the only ones left in the room. Ginny noticed his head turn towards the door and confirmed his suspicions by saying, “They’ve left.”
Malfoy bristled. “No, Potter. It’s just – the way it is, unfortunately.”
He didn’t realize Ginny was talking to him until she’d stalked over and snatched the letter from his hands.
They scurried off, but all Draco could do was stare at the food. He raised his eyebrow at Potter.
“Oh?” Harry asked, biting his lip, a grin on his face.
Hogwarts; either way, Draco had no expectations and had instead accepted his fate of isolation and unemployment.
Draco frowned. “It’s part of mine, too.”
His gaze floated over to Potter. He was chatting with Longbottom, Weasley, and Granger. It was like Potter had never even confessed all that he did to Draco earlier. He was apparently back to pretending like everything was fine and normal for his friends.
Granger shook her head.
And that’s what he did until next Wednesday.
“Good,” said Draco stiffly. “And what about Jones?”
“It’s fine,” replied Potter quickly. “I’m just – er, particularly jumpy today.”
“Draco,” Potter said sharply, his grip tightening again, fingernails digging into Draco’s arm. Draco smiled. “You shouldn’t feel this way about yourself. We’ve all had to do things that we never wanted to do. The war’s fucked all of us up, and maybe none of us are
“You didn’t,” Draco said sharply.
“I saw Parkinson and Zabini walk out of here a while ago,” Potter told him.
“I’ve never told anyone that, you know. Ron and Hermione know bits and pieces of it, but they don’t know…that part.”
was on the tip of his tongue, but Draco restrained himself at the last minute.
“You alright there, Potter?”
“Cheers,” Harry said, and took a sip.
“Oh,” said Draco. So he was right. Harry was second-guessing his friendship with Draco. Why had he even told him? It wasn’t enough for Harry to know that Draco was an ex-Death Eater or that he liked to make himself throw up, he also had to tell him he was fucking gay. “Fourteen. When I really knew.”
“It’s done,” Harry repeated.
“Around a year.”
“All?” Potter repeated. At Draco’s raised eyebrow, Potter scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Oh, come off it, Malfoy. You know all my shit; shouldn’t I know some of yours too?”
“What do
Betty left the room, her long braid trailing behind her.
“I didn’t know you were so invested in all this.”
Potter did so. He sat there for a moment before saying to Draco, “It didn’t help. Maybe for a second it did, but now I just feel the same as I did before.”
He didn’t know how to feel about that. Harry surely wasn’t trying to keep him a secret. It wasn’t like he was embarrassed by Draco. He probably just needed some time before telling his friends.
“I don’t have the energy for it, Malfoy. I really don’t,” Potter said when Draco gave him a doubtful look.
“I don’t think you need to,” Cait replied. “I mean, I know Kathy wasn’t really fond of your ‘disagreement,’ but we’re supposed to get our emotions out, yeah? I reckon it’s better than faking and playing nice.”
Potter scoffed and took a gulp of his drink. “You’re an arse.”
“Luna, um, what are you doing here?” she asked as Luna came over to her.
Draco hugged back, his arms wrapping around Harry’s body comfortingly. Harry sighed happily, gripping Draco tighter and feeling like he could stay that way forever.
“Harry? Is that you?”
“Hello, Harry,” said Rose, who stood obediently by her mother’s side. “Hello, Draco.”
“Thanks.” Harry shot him a grin and came inside, his gaze wandering around the flat before finally landing on Draco. He looked Draco up and down and smiled, “Hope I didn’t wake you up?”
She then looked ahead to Samuel and Damien, who were leading by about ten paces.
The party was being held in the Room of Hidden Things. From a logical point, Draco could see why the hosts would choose this place to hold a gathering. It didn’t mean it hurt any less.
“Well, now we’re just going around in circles.”
As soon as the words had left his mouth, Harry knew he had made a mistake.
“I was…connected to Voldemort.” Draco flinched, but Potter paid it no mind. “I could see what he was seeing sometimes…think what he was thinking, feel what he was feeling. It was…well, the point is, I saw what he forced you to do – use the Cruciatus Curse. I saw...”
“Weasley,” Draco greeted shortly. “One of our Healers found him a few blocks away from here at around 9:40 PM. He was brought in unconscious, so we don’t know what it is that happened exactly, though another Healer is determining the cause of his state as we speak.”
“I just figured you shouldn’t be exposed to this so quickly.”
“Ron and Hermione don’t like that we’re friends,” Potter said one day by way of greeting.
Draco looked up at him, and then back down at his plate.
“Thank you,” he said quietly, and sat. “I hope it’s alright that I hung my robes up.”
Again, Malfoy sighed.
He shook his head.
“Just one of them?” Draco asked, flabbergasted. “Is this how you got away with breaking so many rules the past six years? Maybe you’re not as saint-like as I had thought.”
“Potter,” Draco called, but he just kept going.
“Oh! Healer Malfoy.”
“It’s the only thing that keeps me from offing myself,” Draco said wryly, only half-joking. “And the weight loss is just a happy side-effect.”
“Could we do that breathing exercise we did last time?” asked a young woman who was seated closest to the door.
“It’s alright, I’m just going to lie here for just a second. Just until the world stops spinning,” Draco explained, shutting his eyes but still feeling like he was on an extremely uneven surface, his entire being spinning round and round and round.
And then he fell asleep.
look much healthier.”
“It’s impossible not to,” Draco told him, but Harry ignored this.
Over the next few days, that much had become clear to him.
Draco had to admit some part of him wanted to eat, but he couldn’t let Harry know that.
He stepped away from the sink as Ginny leaned over it and opened said cabinet. A couple of Muggle prescription bottles greeted them, some lined up and a few knocked over. The contents of only a few of them matched their labels; the generic versions of Xanax and Valium. Others held a variation of bud, and one coke. Ginny scooped them up and inspected each closely.
"Never mind them. Look, Harry," Ginny said suddenly, her eyes flashing dangerously as she stepped forward. Harry blinked; he’d momentarily forgotten that she’d been there at all. "You've got a problem. I've known it for a long fucking time and I hate that I didn't try and help you more. But there's no use dwelling on the past, so the only thing to do now is
Harry reveled in the fact that this was truly happening, that his life had really taken this big of a turn. It simultaneously felt like his first meeting at group had been a day ago and a lifetime ago; he never could have imagined that
A wolfish grin appeared on Leo’s face, sending shivers down Draco’s spine.
want? Are you wholly prepared for a new relationship? Because that’s what you’ll be getting if you continue heading down this road. I’m not really one for a quick fuck.”
Potter began fiddling with a loose thread on the sleeve of his robes, avoiding Draco’s eyes.
“Me too,” said Draco. “I mean, if you’ll stay, I will too. I’d – I miss my mother, but I don’t think I’m ready to go back there yet.”
“Oh, I was just curious.” Harry didn’t think he needed to get into their complicated history.
“Cos he is,” Harry cut in. “Just cos he doesn’t deserve to be in Azkaban doesn’t mean he’s not a wanker anymore.”
“But what about what happened last night?” Draco asked Ira. “That certainly isn’t normal. I’ve never done that with any other patient before.”
“Stop,” Harry said weakly.
Pansy scoffed as she stood unsteadily. “Merlin, no! I’m planning on snogging someone tonight, and it
Draco watched as Harry wished Hagrid a happy Christmas and got enveloped by the half-giant in a tremendous hug. After everyone was seated, McGonagall gave some speech about Christmas and unity and Hogwarts and
"Here you go, Mr. Potter."
Hermione’s eyes were wide and Ron looked a bit sick. Harry, however, had dealt with most of these ‘severe symptoms’ before, so he wasn’t too worried.
“I’ve half a mind to,” grumbled Harry. He turned away and picked up the second letter from Malfoy, telling him where to meet him for dinner. He tried pushing down the light, hopeful feeling in his stomach without much avail. “Right.”
This surprised a small laugh out of Draco. “Instinct, I suppose.”
He chose punch for himself, and the two of them cheersed and drank.
When Harry looked up, his eyes met Malfoy’s grey ones for only the second time that night. Harry tried to make his face remain impassive, though he felt strange knowing that Malfoy had heard his choppy introduction. What was Malfoy thinking?
He tossed Draco’s at his face and pulled his own on. In any other situation, Draco would have retaliated, but Ron bloody Weasley was about to walk in on him naked, so Draco pulled his pants on as well.
spent so much time complaining about my own problems and never spent any time on yours. It was unfair and selfish and I’m sorry.”
Draco hissed as Harry stroked his cock methodically, up and down, his lean body taut. "Shut up. What do you - mmph, what are you?"
"Explain so I can understand then."
And then he realized there was no way to contact him. Or maybe there was? It would make no sense if there wasn’t. Patients need assistance and a way to get it, don’t they? He felt it was rather rudimentary.
“I’m not,” Draco lied, bristling.
“He was actually partly conscious while we were in there. He didn’t open his eyes or speak, but he did acknowledge what I was saying,” Draco said, slightly amused by how much Granger and Weasley were perking up. “Judging by this behavior, he might even wake up tomorrow morning, which is quite rare. I’m impressed, I must say.”
"Did you ever use illegal Muggle substances?"
“What, and then I get put back on potions?” Harry asked, irritation bubbling up in him once more.
Harry’s lips were unbelievably soft, even if they were chapped from the cold. His hair was heaven to card through, and Draco had a hard time deciding if he wanted to do that or lay his hands flat on Harry’s warm chest.
Draco’s expression was one of distress.
“Well, Hermione and Ron are easy,” Harry said, amused. “Everyone knows about them. And anyway, it all depends on your sources. If you’re reading rubbish like Skeeter, you’re going to have a lot of bad information.”
He was drawn out of his thoughts when he caught Leo’s eyes on him.
Harry woke up sharply, his eyes snapping open. They met Draco’s own, which probably conveyed the panic he was feeling.
Draco rubbed at his forehead. “All right, thanks. I’ll go see him.”
They went back to Harry’s room, whisky in tow, and Draco tried to push his nervous thoughts away. He kept thinking what had happened the last time they’d gotten drunk together. He had laid his head down in Harry’s lap, for Salazar’s sake. He still wanted to die from embarrassment whenever he thought about it, but then he’d remember that Harry had played with Draco’s hair and then it wasn’t so bad.
“Can you believe exams are this week?”
"Some people don't like it," Draco was saying even as he drew close to Harry's hole. Harry twitched as Draco's hot breath went over it.
made Harry cringe.
Scowling, Harry grabbed some Floo powder from the mantel and tossed it into the fire.
Draco stuck his arm out, and as Potter looked at it, Draco wondered if he, too, thought back to what happened all those years ago. Potter smiled, an actual toothy smile, and shook Draco’s hand.
He was frozen in place, arms still crossed tightly in front of his chest. But then others began following Potter’s gaze and looking at Draco as well, and so he had no choice but to sit down next to Potter.
Harry’s arm twitched like he wanted to reach out and save the pills from falling, but he restrained himself by crossing his arms across his chest. He watched as she binned the empty container, picked up a new one, opened it, and dumped its contents. She repeated these movements until she’d finished with all of them.
went unsaid, and Wolff’s eyebrows rose.
It seemed to be enough. Malfoy nodded again, a small smile playing at his lips.
Draco glanced out of it; he saw an empty street save for a few cars.
Draco felt worse. Potter could do such a good job at putting on a show for his friends, while all Draco could do was distance himself from the few he had left. It was typical of him, really, to be so moody and selfish. He half-watched Potter and wondered how he did it, how he gathered the energy to interact with people and put on a happy face when thoughts of death weighed on his mind. Draco was both impressed and bitter.
“I, well, when I was a kid…my friends say I was abused,” Harry said quickly, because quickly was the only way he could possibly get it out. “Which, really, is too strong of a word, I think. I mean, yeah, the Du- er, my caretakers weren’t the nicest people but they kept me alive. I had a roof over my head, and I got food at least once a day, so I can’t be ungrateful, y’know?”
Harry blinked, not comprehending.
They reached Potter’s room. Draco knocked on the door gently before opening it and getting welcomed by the sight of Weasley and Granger sitting by Potter, the latter holding his limp hand. Draco swallowed.
They stared at each other for a bit, and Harry wondered for the thousandth time how they had ended up here.
He opened his mouth. His eyebrows were drawn together; his grey eyes stormy.
“I really feel like I’ve fucked up,” Harry said, eyes wide and full of anxiety. “Draco, you’re gorgeous, if you’re thinking - “
And then Draco slowly slid his mouth off Harry and murmured, “Do you want me to fuck you?”
“Sorry I’m late,” Harry said as he sat down in the empty chair.
Malfoy withdrew his wand. “Would you like me to cast the Disillusionment charm on you?”
Draco released the smoke from his lungs.
“Right,” said Harry. And then, “And thanks for sharing. Y’know…if you remember what I said.”
“Draco.” She paused, then spoke carefully. “What if you’re building him up to be this perfect hero with absolutely no flaws?”
Pansy opened her mouth but shut it without saying anything, an angry expression on her face. She huffed and turned away to stare down the rows of books, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
“Sometimes, when we’d go over to his flat, everything smelled like alcohol. And when we told him he might want to stop, he shrugged it off.”
He was slightly surprised that Malfoy had decided to go with his given name; it wasn’t exactly ordinary, especially among Muggles.
Draco agreed begrudgingly, though the worried thoughts that flew through his mind did not cease.
"Right," he bit out.
He stood up and stretched, checking the mirror to evaluate the damage. His hair was sticking up on one side and his robes were wrinkled. But at least there was no ink on his face.
“It’s your fault,” Draco said. Harry smiled broader. Draco tried again, pointedly not looking at Harry, “I just didn’t want to say no. That’d be rude, considering you’re the host and all.”
“I guess you really could be a Slytherin.”
come here – he had brought himself to St. Mungo’s. He knew that he was hanging on by a thread, and that his life had become dangerously pathetic (if he could even call it a life at this point).
This wasn’t really happening, was it?
“Eat your soup, you git.”
“Draco?” Harry was asking him. “Everything alright?”
“I stand by what I said.”
“Anyway,” Draco cleared his throat, his grey eyes now bright with intent, “I was under the impression that we came here to get
“Oh, so just the highlights then.”
Not to stereotype, but if Harry had to sort her, she’d be in Slytherin.
Harry glared at him half-heartedly. Malfoy looked back impassively.
food, he’d realized just how famished he was. He had another few spoonfuls over the course of a few minutes.
“Thank you, Harry,” he said curtly.
He made to pick up the bottle in between the two of them, but Harry stopped him, catching his wrist. Draco was taken aback by this but didn’t fight it. He simply met Harry’s eye.
Hermione finally met his eyes – her face hard.
to be with you. You’re not a bad person. You’re not sick.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Do I look like someone who frequents that shop?”
? Was he feeling alright? Or maybe Draco was actually just hallucinating everything or dreaming it all up; he might’ve still been in that corridor, perhaps he’d just been knocked out and was in the middle of some obscure fantasy involving Harry Potter, house-elves, and a gigantic, secret kitchen.
When his cigarette was reduced to ash, Draco decided to go back inside. He found Pansy talking animatedly with Padma Patil. When she saw him, she smiled and held up a finger. Draco leaned against a nearby wall to wait for her, avoiding eye contact with the others in the room. He still felt like an outsider. He was a world apart from everyone else, and no amount of alcohol and friendly conversation could change that.
“You like that, Potter?” came Draco’s breathy voice, and it just made Harry suck more desperately. “You like it when I fuck your face?”
As he leaned against the stone wall of the castle, he felt himself shake. No, he was
Draco inhaled through his nose, uncertain of what he was feeling. Potter looked so sincere, which just made it worse.
Draco goggled at him. “We’ll talk about the fact that you have a weekly
They went back to work, speaking only to fact-check and work through problems out loud. They did this for about an hour before they finished.
“I’m glad, Harry,” Ginny said. “I’d have to have a word with the both of them if they were being idiots.”
Harry didn’t know what to say, and settled on, “Er.”
Harry bit down a smile and continued.
Draco rubbed at his left arm absently, taking his gaze off Potter and wishing for the thousandth time that he wasn’t here. His bitter thoughts were cut off by Slughorn entering the room. The classroom quieted as the old man made his way up to the front.
Harry gave a sly smile. He shook it out, whatever it was, and threw it over the both of them.
to Malfoy,” Ginny repeated, as if Luna had misheard her.
Harry flushed. “Oh, right. Er, Draco. I just wanted to say that I really want to be civil – this is about Sam, not me and not you. Y’know?”
Harry got an owl a week after they told him the news, inviting him and his plus-one (there was a neat little winky-face drawn next to this) over to the Burrow for an engagement party the Saturday after next. Harry wrote back immediately, confirming that he and his plus-one would be there.
Of course, despite this newfound friendship, Draco was in no way cured. He knew depression didn’t work like that; he couldn’t be fixed through simple companionship.
“Just – shut up and put the next one in.”
He studied the room. He wasn’t sure what he had expected; there were about fifteen people present, not including Kathy or himself. Most of them were probably a bit older than him, maybe in their mid-to-late 20s. Some were middle-aged. There were a few that were younger than him as well, but he knew that one had to be at least eighteen to join.
Granger glared at him, and Harry looked at him, abashed.
“Draco?”
Ginny raised a single eyebrow, and Harry fell silent, recognizing when a battle was lost.
Ginny had a little frown on her face.
Potter flapped a hand in his direction. “Go, Malfoy. You’ve got people to save, I get it.”
- Y'all ever love Harry James Potter with your whole entire heart?
Draco looked up at Harry, expecting to see revulsion (at worst) or tolerance (at best) on his handsome face. Instead, as Harry’s eyes ran up and down Draco’s frame, the only way Draco could describe the expression on his face was wonder. Draco felt his face heat up.
They were going out for drinks. Social drinking. Not drinking-to-forget-how-much-you-wanted-to-die drinking.
“Draco,” Pansy eyed him warily. “Where were you?”
Why was he so irritated that Potter had left that night? Wasn’t he the one who just wanted everyone to leave him alone and mind their own business? He still felt vaguely hurt whenever he thought of the way Potter had looked at him with such a resigned look on his face before he had left.
“Shut up,” Harry hissed as he nearly jumped out of bed and retrieved their pants.
“I – “ Draco said stupidly before shutting up.
Draco whispered something, and then Harry heard the click of a cap opening. He looked back then, at Draco rubbing lube over his erect cock and hands, such nice hands and long fingers, Harry thought dazedly.
“I mean, I figure we’ll all have to sit down and talk about it at some point or another, so we might as well get it over with, right?
Draco took this in, then said, "I thought you said it wouldn't take long."
Harry saw Draco nod jerkily, and then felt something hit the side of his head.
“Yeah, you too, Harry.”
“When will we know which potions he had in him?”
“I told you,” Potter said flatly. “You don’t remember?”
Malfoy gave a small smile and said, “You’ll be fine, Potter.”
“No, we’re trying to help Potter recover; he doesn’t need any chemicals in his system.”
Harry nodded, and when Malfoy passed it to him, he signed and dated it.
“Fuck, Draco, don’t say that,” he groaned. “We have to go in five.”
"What do you think I've been doing, Malfoy?"
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, determinedly not looking at Draco and choosing his words carefully. “I’ve gotten closer to someone. It’s been a while since I’ve gotten this close to someone – someone other than my best mates. I can really open up to him, and he…legitimately makes me happy.”
Draco checked Potter’s vitals, and upon seeing that they were as stable as they could be at this stage, he told Leonel to pack it up. Leonel collected the equipment in his arms as Draco undid the muting spell. When he opened the door, he was greeted by Weasley’s and Granger’s equally worried faces. Draco gestured to Leonel, giving him permission to go. Leonel walked away.
He gave an affirmative hum, but didn’t say anything else.
The bartender served Harry his drink – a cheap shot of whiskey. Harry thanked him and immediately drank it down. He was grateful for the burn.
“Well, the Sorting Hat almost put me in Slytherin, so we could be honorary Housemates,” Harry said.
"I, er...I wasn't just using potions or alcohol." He bit his bottom lip and his gaze started to wander. He settled on looking at his hands as he said haltingly, "I also...sometimes used some Muggle drugs."
“Please? Even if it’s completely horrible it’ll be progress, right? The beginning of tolerance?” He nudged Draco gently. “Right?”
Harry leaned over to kiss him. Draco threaded his fingers through Harry’s hair as he kissed him back, still surprised at how soft it was. Harry pulled away, but instead of straightening back to his original positon, he laid down in the grass and rested his head in Draco’s lap. Draco smiled slightly and resumed playing with Harry’s hair. He almost felt at peace, sitting here, gazing at the stars above him with Harry to accompany him.
Draco caught Harry’s eyes before clearing his throat softly.
“Merlin, you’re gorgeous,” Harry said approvingly, his eyes raking over Draco. His hands were still on Draco’s hips, steady and warm. “As mental as it sounds, I missed you.”
Draco followed Potter into the kitchen and marveled as they walked towards a large, brick fireplace. Even as they walked, a few house-elves came scurrying to catch up with Potter and looked up at him with huge, adoring eyes.
“You’re most likely right,” Draco conceded, then leaned in to kiss him.
“Really, you git.”
Draco flushed, hesitated, then looked away.
Harry took hold of Draco’s hips and positioned them roughly right in front of him. Draco stared as Harry slathered even more lube over his cock, his entire body aching with desire.
Draco sighed. It was true; Ira’s ward focused more on creating new potions or improving existing ones, not healing and curing patients.
“Betty. She tells me everything, so don’t punish her for it.”
, Draco reminded himself silently.
“Are you sure he said you two couldn’t date? Because that
“You don’t look well,” Potter said by way of answer.
“Yeah,” he said. His eyes went from Malfoy to Harry. “You two know each other?”
Potter opened his eyes and thought for a moment. “How mental it is that Ginny and Zabini are going out.”
Ira seemed to understand immediately – they were clever like that.
And for once, Ira seemed at a loss for words. Several moments passed before Ira stood and opened up a cabinet door. Draco watched as Ira pulled out a half-empty bottle of Crown Royal and set it down on their desk with a
“Officially today is fine,” Draco said, pink in the face again.
The only real hobbies he’d had the past few years were getting high or drunk, and they were rather all-consuming, not leaving much time, energy, or want for anything else. What did he like to do before? What made him happy? How did he function?
“And they’re all over the place,” Harry continued. “They could be part of a bigger organization that supports some general cause, or they could be part of hospitals. Oh, and there’s Muggle hospitals that just help Muggles with mental illnesses.”
“It’s 9:59. You wouldn’t want to be late.”
“Yeah, that’d be great. Thanks, Ginny.”
“She doesn’t
Draco stiffened under Harry’s meaningful gaze and had to work to keep eye contact with him.
“Fine.”
“I obsess over things, or did you forget?”
“What if…”
“So? How is it?”
“Draco…”
Potter gave him a wry smile. “Really.”
Hermione gave him a look that made him fall silent. He cleared his throat and decided to answer Ron's question instead.
But then someone came up behind her, a someone he’d rather not have in his hospital room.
“I – yes, I agree,” Draco said hesitantly, glancing over at Harry.
“What if you can’t help? I know you can’t even conceive of it – the thought doesn’t even cross your idiot hero brain, but you can’t fix everything.”
“Yes, I can understand that,” Draco nodded. “I will come collect you five minutes to ten on Monday morning.”
Draco rolled his eyes and waved them away; Betty gave a cheery, “Bye!”
“What are you doing here?” Harry finally said, feeling foolish as the words came out of his mouth.
“Whatever,” Draco scowled. He crossed his arms. “And what are we doing, anyway? You know I don’t eat anymore,” he said in what he hoped was an offhand manner, his voice wavering only slightly.
“But um...” Estrada began again, “He’s talked about his friends…his professors. Like what I’ve told Draco about Ilvermorny.”
“What’s your role in this, exactly? Force-feed me alcohol until I feel like exposing myself?”
Draco colored at this, and though Harry didn’t look angry, Draco was certain that Harry was teasing him.
Ron sounded relieved for whatever reason; Hermione swatted Ron's arm and glared at him pointedly.
“Leo,” Draco greeted, offering him a tight smile. “Yes, I figured my presence wouldn’t be missed all that much.”
“Oh,” Harry bit his lip. “Still?”
The two of them began walking to room fourteen while Betty caught Draco up on other happenings in the Ward while he had been absent. Everyone seemed to be doing well, especially one patient who’d been bitten on the arm by a Venomous Tentacula a day before.
“You’ll be able to see everyone soon enough. Whenever you feel up to it, of course, but you know, you’ll be released tomorrow,” Hermione said as if Harry didn’t know this himself, “And I’ve got a good feeling – about it all – this time around. Really,” she added at Harry’s scoff. “The circumstances are different and you’ve been doing so well…”
Harry complied, tearing it off and letting it fall off the side of the bed, and did the same to his shirt right after. Draco’s eyes scanned his body hungrily, making Harry feel ridiculous and embarrassed but pleased all the same. Draco all but leaped onto Harry, their near naked bodies grinding together as they kissed eagerly, their heavy breaths loud in the otherwise silent room. Harry grabbed Draco’s tight arse, his fingernails digging into the firm flesh. Draco sucked and licked his way down Harry’s chest, his tongue flicking at Harry’s hard nipple. Harry let out a restless moan; he was definitely hard now.
“Yeah, well, this was easiest.” Potter sounded annoyed. Draco hadn’t heard Potter sound this irritated in years.
"On recovery, yeah. God, you sound just like Malfoy," Harry scowled, "I get it."
“When was that?” he asked.
He stuck to his word and arrived to her flat through Floo five to noon. Harry stepped out of the fireplace and called out, “Ginny?”
“We’ll look into that.” Malfoy wrote something down. “Well, it seems you have the typical symptoms of withdrawal from calming potions and alcohol, so you shouldn’t be too worried. If you experience any more severe symptoms, alert a Healer right away.”
“Draco? What’s wrong?”
His words faltered a bit towards the end, but he still looked resolutely at Draco, who was admittedly surprised at Weasley’s uncharacteristic sincerity.
“Draco?”
Pansy’s face flushed slightly. “Regardless of my feelings toward Potter, you’re my best friend, Draco. You can tell me anything, even if you think I won’t like it.”
Wolff raised her eyebrows. “Would you like to elaborate?”
better. I told you,” Leonel smirked, well past trying to impress him.
Ginny was staring at him.
Throwing the mobile far away from him, he stood and went to brush his teeth. He checked his mobile once he's reentered the bedroom, but to his dismay, he hadn't gotten a response yet.
Potter smirked. “Still bitter about a certain hex, Malfoy?”
“God, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he tried to say, but he’s not sure she understood.
“Good,” Draco said distractedly, his mind not letting him forget about his dream.
“Healer Lloyd found him,” Leonel said, still instructing his quill to take down notes on the pad that was racing to keep up with him. “The patient had fainted on the sidewalk a few blocks away. It’s lucky Lloyd decided to walk home today; who knows how long it could have been before someone else found him?”
There it is.
“There’ll be plenty of time after breakfast to do whatever you like,” Draco reminded him.
“They’re from his snake,” Harry said before Draco had to ask. Draco didn’t have to ask whose snake, either. He saw it vividly in his mind, slithering towards the professor the Dark Lord had murdered on his family’s table. It must’ve shown on his face, because Harry whispered, “Draco?”
“I know. Just get some actual sleep in an actual bed.”
“Oh. Well. I still had loads of help,” said Harry, clearly uncomfortable.
“I did, Healer,” she replied quickly. “He was doing fine when I saw him.”
Leo laughed and ran a hand through his curls. Draco stood and began to take his clothes off too.
“It’s more than fine,” Harry said
“Since leaving treatment a little over a month ago,” Malfoy clarified. “It’s fairly common for patients to relapse shortly after being discharged from treatment, and it certainly doesn’t mean the end of recovery, or that you’ve ‘failed’ at it.”
“I don’t know.” Potter sounded frustrated now. His speech was a bit slurred, and Merlin help him, Draco found it endearing. His drunk brain needed to fuck off. “It’s just, the way everyone is acting, it’s as if nothing’s changed. But everything did. I don’t see how they’ve all just moved on with their lives but I’m still thinking about that body I stepped over on the third floor during the battle and how I have to walk past that spot every day on my way to class. Or how they’re all just getting pissed where horrible things happened just a few months ago but none of them seem to remember or care.
“Yes?”
In fact, it was normal up until the point he’d gotten back home.
“Draco?”
looked in the mirror? Merlin, he looked bad. No wonder he avoided his own reflection. He trailed his hand down his own chest; he was thinner – though he always was thanks to the Dursleys – and his skin didn’t have its previous healthy color. Heavy bags were underneath his dead eyes, and even his hair seemed to be less animated.
“Yeah,” Harry let out a laugh. “Dunno why I thought it was a good idea.”
He knew she was wondering if he’d gone to sick up in the loo again.
He then proceeded to take Harry’s face in his hands and kiss him gently, his soft lips heaven to Harry and Harry kissed back, putting everything into it, wanting to show Draco just how sorry he was (
“Whatever – even assuming that I
“Help me then.”
“Oh. Well, I’ve been sort of struggling to deal with things,” Harry said, panicking a little. Once again, it occurred to him just how hard it would be to explain his problems to Muggles. He continued, deciding to leave things ambiguous. “Things that happened in the past. I still get nightmares and I’ve got some – er, anger issues. Control issues. For a while I just tried to ignore it, self-medicating, I guess, but I’m not doing that anymore. So now I’m here to, er, help myself. The right way.”
“Hey, Malfoy.”
Draco suddenly felt warm and tugged at his too-tight collar. “Ah.”
“Malfoy?”
"I'm going to need you to stop talking," Draco said, not answering the question and instead kissing Harry hard, slipping his tongue inside Harry’s mouth.
“What is it?”
“Thank you,” he said softly, unable to hide his smile. “You too, Leo.”
“Hmm,” said Draco thoughtfully between his straw.
“They were happy for me,” Harry added quietly, and Hermione and Ron’s faces fell. Draco frowned at Harry and put his hand on Harry’s thigh, his action concealed by the table.
"Well, you’re here bright and early," Draco croaked.
Samuel looked behind him, trying to determine who Harry was talking about.
“Now there’s ambition for you.” She studied him seriously for a moment when he didn’t respond. “Well, alright. I’m glad things are going well with you and Potter. This friendship is an improvement over you pining away after him, day after day.”
“Draco,” Harry murmured, reaching out to run a hand from a slightly protruding collarbone all the way down to the top of his trousers. Draco shivered, and Harry’s bright eyes snapped up to meet Draco’s own. “You’re beautiful.”
“I mean I was definitely shocked when I woke up to Malfoy,” Harry admitted, “But it was fine after the first few days. We actually got on, mad as it is to say it…”
“Let’s go.”
“Hey.”
Malfoy turned to look away as he forced his crisp shirtsleeves up, displaying…Harry blinked.
Draco stood and gathered the textbooks as Pansy began explaining her romantic identity.
“Malfoy?”
“Perhaps,” said Draco. “If I may ask, how did Ginevra convince you to come?”
“I just, er,” Harry started to say to Draco with a nervous glance at Astoria, “Well, could we talk? It doesn’t have to be right now, I just wanted…”
“I remember,” Potter said. He didn’t sound mad, but there was a marked difference from the way he sounded just one minute before. “They sort of know what happened. Me going into the forest. Voldemort casting at me. Faking my death. But they think that’s as far as it goes – faking it.”
“I think I should…perhaps keep my distance from now on, Harry,” Draco began to say, and
Draco stopped for a millisecond – pleasure and arousal and anxiety running through him all at once - and then pulled back fully, looking Harry in the eyes.
“No, I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair,” Draco interrupted. “You haven’t done anything wrong.”
“Oh. Of course,” Draco said. “I’ll just, ah-“
The students who had been around during some part of their first six years knew of the aggressive history between them. The students who hadn’t had heard of them regardless – after all, who in this wide world didn’t know Harry Potter? And while Draco was much less well-known, he did gain some notoriety during the trials, adding to his previous reputation as a wealthy Pureblood.
“Straighten out your back,” Draco said, and Potter obeyed. “Now inhale deeply, as long as you can. Keep the air in.”
“No, I’m sorry, but it’s true,” Harry said, his throat tight. “I’ve just been so fucked up for
“Right,” Harry said, getting Draco’s attention. He was wearing that black hoodie Draco loved so much, and those Muggle inventions called jeans. His hair was slightly tamer than before, though that didn’t exactly mean tame. The large love bite Draco had given him the night before was fairly noticeable. “Breakfast?”
They only waited for a minute and a half when Potter’s body tightened and clenched, his back going stiff and lifting several centimeters off the bed as he writhed. He yelled out, his hand curled into fist and face scrunched in pain.
“Oh, yes, that’s rather common. The war was terrible,” Luna said in a rather mellow tone.
“Bloody delicious,” Ira corrected him again. They raised their wand and sent a locking charm at the door before returning their attention back to Draco. “Alright. Let’s talk this through.”
Ira nodded. “Naturally.”
“I dunno,” he said. “Maybe. But even if they did, I’d still be worried that someone would recognize me.”
A small scoff sounded at the opposite end of the room; Harry glanced up at that, intrigued. Malfoy was sitting there, rolling his eyes.
Draco’s heart stopped. His shoulders tensed; he could hardly register what was happening. Before he could even respond, Potter pulled away, releasing his hold on Draco’s arm as he did so. Potter looked mortified, his eyes everywhere but Draco as he stumbled backwards.
"Right," Harry said again. He wiped his palms on his jeans and took a deep breath. "Sorry for yelling at you."
His owl returned not half an hour later with eleven hasty numbers scrawled on a scrap of paper.
“I apologize as well,” Malfoy said quietly. “I don’t know what came over me.”
“Our own place. Isn’t that mental?”
He glared at her as he shrugged off his jacket and hung it over the back of the sofa. He collapsed onto it by her feet.
He had almost killed Draco.
Potter broke his gaze and glared down at his drink instead.
“We weren’t on the best of terms at school,” Harry tried explaining.
“Merlin,” breathed Draco. He reached out to touch it, then remembered himself.
He had very nearly told Potter that he didn’t want him to leave him alone, and Draco’s heartrate quickened at the thought.
“No, this is good. It will be easier to have him drink the Clearing Potion than having to force it down.”
Harry obeyed. When he finished, he insisted, “I’m all right.”
“Yeah.”
Harry ignored this question and asked his own.
“Go home, Betty. You’ve done well,” Draco sighed. “And Ira, piss off.”
Draco’s gaze lingered on them, admiring the masculine shape of them.
Sorry I'm slacking so much, lots of stuff going on, ha ha ha. Also - I'm obviously not a medical professional so sorry if I make any horrible mistakes.
“Excellent.” Draco smiled a bit. “Now, Potter, this may burn a bit, but I assure you that it’s beneficial. Do you understand?”
"Yes, really, and now I'm halfway regretting it, much as I hate to say it. Just because of all the complexities of our relationship…I was his Healer, and he was in a bad place, obviously, when he was in my care. I told him we couldn't do anything for at least a year after he began recovery because I didn't want to risk anything, and now it’s been a year, but I'm still worried that it was wrong of me to – to take advantage."
“We will persevere, Potter. We’ve drunk the fake Firewhisky before. In fact,
He wished he could get rid of it. He’d curse it off, if he had to. Draco kept it covered at all times; even
“Sam, man of the hour,” Damien said. “What do you say about all of us going out for drinks afterwards to celebrate?”
Potter sighed. “Are you? Are you happy, Malfoy?”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that.
Draco shook his head, trying to hide his smile.
“I’ve just been thinking.”
What else could he do?
Harry had immediately gone for the shower and put on a change of clothes, not knowing if Ginny even knew what weed smelled like but also not wanting to take any chances. When he had emerged from the bathroom, hair wet and heart pounding, Ginny frowned at him.
“God, you’re gorgeous, Draco,” Harry whispered to him admiringly.
“Fantastic. And what are you still doing here? It’s six-thirty already.”
“I reckon it’s fine,” Harry sighed. “I should have expected it. As long as he doesn’t tell anyone else.”
"I mean, a bit, but you can't say it wasn't surprising."
Fresh tears leaked out of Hermione’s eyes, and Ron put a firm hand on his shoulder.
tell me I told you so.”
,” he hissed, his hand tight on Harry. “I’m gonna come, Harry, fuck.”
With a sigh, he finished changing into the white hospital robes. If anyone saw him now, there’d be no doubt he was a patient here at St. Mungo’s. Hopefully the staff could keep their promises and keep his being here private.
“Nowhere in particular,” Draco said, wondering why he was being evasive. It was like he wanted to keep his conversation with Potter private.
for it – what he went through was nothing compared to me.”
“What would you like to do?”
– and stumbled back to Noc.
, Malfoy.”
,” Draco sputtered angrily. “How did those Muggles get away with that? How are they
He bit his lip, thinking.
Draco watched as Harry’s eyes opened, and as he turned toward Draco and propped himself up on his elbow.
“Come on.”
“You promise I look all right?”
“Well, I certainly didn’t need to know that,” he snapped.
“You say such sweet things, Potter,” Draco said sarcastically. He sat up and immediately regretted it. The world had begun to spin aggressively, and Draco’s immediate solution was to lie down and rest his head on Potter’s lap. “Ah. Hope you don’t mind if I – ah, lie down right…here.”
“How could you?” Draco asked suspiciously.
As the evening went on, more and more guests poured into the Burrow, offering Ron and Hermione their enthusiastic congratulations.
“I’ve got a headache, I’m nauseous, I still can’t sleep well…”
“Good question. I suppose we’ll just have to wait and see,” Blaise answered, his gaze slipping to Weasley, who frowned at Draco as one would a feral crup.
“Stop trying to defend my actions, Potter,” Draco said. “It’s different. You and all your mates, you did what you had to do because
Ira chose to ignore this question.
“What, then?”
liked.
He still felt sick, but Potter’s warmth and scent comforted him slightly. He resisted the urge to move closer to Potter; who knew what the reactions to that would be.
“Right,” Macmillan cleared his throat. “I suppose we’ll leave you to it then.”
much more than he needed to. Like when he sat and stared at nothing while their food arrived, and how he didn’t snap out of it until Harry said something.
“Er, congrats.”
“He doesn’t have any listed?”
“Not here,” Harry said firmly. He could probably tell Draco was going to protest, so he said, “Later. I don’t want to talk about this now.”
Harry jumped out of his seat to hug him, patting him on the back enthusiastically. Ron stood to hug him back, squeezing tighter than he usually did.
Potter’s mouth twitched, but he still said nothing.
"It's fine when I'm in hospital, y'know?" Harry said after a moment. "But I don't know if I'll be able to keep, er, clean when I'm back home. I could never quit before cos it was so easy to just - give in."
“You’re an arse,” Harry said, and Draco smirked.
“It’s no use if I
“Hi,” Draco said quietly.
He trailed off, his voice barely above a whisper. His heart ached as the truth sunk in, loud and obvious and as clear as day, and he looked away, afraid to look his friends in the eyes.
“That was pretty tame, honestly. It actually got physical a few times,” Harry said, wincing as he remembered their disastrous fight in sixth year. “More than a few times, actually.”
“You’re welcome, Potter,” said Malfoy before turning to leave the room. He opened the door and said, “Oh. Ginevra. It’s good to see you.”
Draco didn’t need to look up to see who it was, but he did anyway.
Draco was just about to tell him he missed him too when they heard voices from down the corridor. The two leapt apart from each other, Draco accidentally banging his elbow into the scratchy wall. He winced and rubbed at it as they turned to see who it was. When they realized it was just a trio of younger Hufflepuffs, they deflated with relief.
He crossed his arms, feeling vulnerable under Malfoy’s sharp gaze.
“Yes, a year of absolutely no contact. And then one dinner and suddenly a relationship? I want to do this right, Harry.”
“How are you feeling now?”
He picked up his own pace, wanting Malfoy to feel every bit as good as he did. It seemed to work, Harry thought, by the way Malfoy closed his eyes and bit his own lip. How was it possible for someone to be so –
“Of course,” Draco said, never failing to be endeared by Harry’s politeness, his uncertainty. He made space in the area next to him and watched as Harry made his way around the table and sat down. “How’d you sleep?”
“Of course,” said Leonel. “The entire hospital didn’t fall apart in the, what, five hours you’ve been gone?”
“What did they say?”
“Harry?” she took his hands in her own. “What is it?”
“Yes, I’m sorry,” Draco said, trying to shake off the suffocating thought of 'what if Father found out?’
Draco put his wand in his pocket next to his mother’s. “Yeah.”
“It’s not just you, Draco,” Harry said quietly.
Harry’s curiosity was piqued (when was it not when concerning Draco Malfoy?), and he asked, “Do you usually work?”
and the only one who can do that is you. So you're not bloody leaving until it's sorted and you admit that you’re ill."
“It’s true. You deserve someone who’s wholesome and good and wasn’t a Death Eater.”
. Draco looked away.
Harry looked at him, surprised he knew so much about this. Hermione was also staring at him.
“Alright,” Harry said, though not thoroughly convinced. “How’ve you been, Malfoy?”
Harry was dressed in one of his nicer button-ups and dark wash jeans, while Draco had decided to go with a tight black turtleneck, a smart grey blazer, and dark jeans.
“Fine. If you must know, it’s…Potter.”
be good to see him; it’d set Draco’s mind at ease to see him be well, and they’d finally get some closure on their…whatever it was.
“Thanks Luna,” Harry said meekly.
“Is Draco really popular with the entirety of whatever?”
“Betty’s no fun though. She’s too nice,” Draco explained, “So you’ll continue to be the one I pick on because there’s no one else.”
Leonel’s dark curls were swept back out of his face, save for the loose coil that never obeyed like the others did. He was clean-shaven and smelled discreetly like his American cologne. Draco had always preferred him with a beard, but Leonel liked to be shaved for work. And, well, he was fit either way.
“You’re so – arrogant,” Draco breathed. “Hurry up and fuck me properly, Potter.”
“Yeah, so, er…guess I’ll see you next week?” he said, though it turned into a question.
“Good morning,” Harry said, kissing him softly.
“this isn’t something she can fix with a potion.”
"We all love you, Harry. Remember that," she said, her voice calmer now. She stared down at him with stern eyes. "When we thought you were dead, that you were killed by
“He was,” Harry nodded. He exhaled shakily. “Not of his own choice, though. He was never happy as one, Hermione, I saw it.”
“It’s such a turn-on when you use my surname,” Draco confessed, his eyes dark as he stared down at Harry. “You can’t imagine how fucking
“Yes,” Draco answered. “I found a letter my father had written me years ago while sorting through some old things. I knew I’d find some reminders of my past, but I wasn’t prepared for something like that.”
“We would go visit him sometimes, cos he hardly went out anymore.” Weasley frowned, remembering. “His flat was always a mess. Just – empty potion bottles everywhere. Most of them were Dreamless Sleep, but there were some others too.”
would be able to speak freely.
“Draco, I –“
“Er, sure.”
“You’re – so –
“I suggest you thank me. I won’t recall saying anything remotely nice to you in an hour. The memory will simply vanish, and no one will ever believe you when you say I was nice.”
“Er, yeah, I am,” Harry nodded, a little unnerved by how chirpy her voice was. “I sent an email. I’m Harry.”
"He was found overdosed on a combination of potions and alcohol - he's been stabilized since, but he needs guidance. I know you have experience with addicts…and of course, war trauma."
“Here,” said Harry, and he took it from her.
Draco gave Harry a strange look at that but didn’t say anything; instead he made his way to the bedroom, Harry tagging along. As he gathered his things, he glanced repeatedly at Harry, who lounged against the doorframe.
"I know that, Leo. And either way, it’s true."
“Well?” Potter crossed his arms.
Some cuts just ran too deep; they couldn’t be healed no matter how much time had passed. Horrible, cruel, inhumane things had happened over the war, and Draco was a part of that. He had inflicted those deep cuts on many people, and no amount of begging or pleading or apologizing could make up for it. Sure, as the Wizengamot had said, he was just a child, but just barely. A few months later and he would had faced the full wrath of the courts. He wasn’t being adequately punished for his crimes - by the state, at least.
He mostly wondered how she would react. Would she approve? Would she be cautious? Would she be happy for him?
about splitting up with me just because I might’ve gained a bit of weight. And sod off, Harry. I’ll hex you too.”
“And with therapy?”
Ira nodded with a grimace.
When Harry didn't say anything, Draco gave a bitter smile.
He was holding the same papers he had had earlier that day. Betty was at his heels, carrying what looked like a hospital gown.
“I was just checking Mr. Potter’s vitals when I saw that he has a fever. One moment…”
"I need - I need you to fuck me," Harry was now saying desperately, while Draco tonguefucked him harder. "Draco, Draco, I need you inside -"
Ira was sat at their desk, legs stretched out and feet propped up on it. There was a book in their lap and they looked up from it as Draco came in and began to pace nervously. Ira blinked once and raised an eyebrow, a smirk growing on their face.
“Recovery is not a linear process,” Hermione recited immediately, her expression serious. “Even if it seems like we’re doing ‘well,’ we have our off-days, Harry. I’m sure you know that. I mean, by the way I snapped at you earlier…you know that. You can vent to us anytime. You don’t have to worry about us.”
Ginny moved forward in her seat, leaning closer to Harry. “Why strange?”
“I’m not shagging him,” Draco hissed. “I’m just…seeing him.”
“Thank you.”
Leo was looking at him wide eyes, a mixture of emotions on his face. Betty, on the other hand, looked like Christmas had come early.
he thought,
"You're amazing," Harry said softly. "You are."
Harry curled his hands into his fists and looked away once more, not able to stomach how Ginny was staring at him, like she didn’t know him.
“Hey,” said Leonel. He stepped back, making room. “Come in.”
Draco woke the next morning with his face pressed against his notes. He sat up slowly, back aching terribly from having spent the night hunched over his desk.
It was a week after Draco had regularly begun slipping into their dormitory late at night that Blaise confronted him.
tell him to fuck off, so maybe Malfoy took it to heart.
Draco scowled.
“Sorry,” he said.
"Would you mind if I came through, actually? It'll need a bit of explaining."
“Yes, Healer Malfoy.”
His body seemed to remember where to go more than he did. Draco followed his instincts into the building and up a set of narrow stairs before coming to a standstill at Leo's door. It'd been over a year since he'd stood in this exact spot, and he had to gather his courage before he knocked.
Draco studied him for a moment. “
Embarrassment flooded through Draco’s body, and then irritation towards Blaise for telling his girlfriend what was meant to be
“I’m sorry too, Draco,” Leonel said, giving him a sad smile. “But at least we know, right?”
“Harry Potter, of course,” Estrada interrupted. Malfoy rolled his eyes at this, but Estrada didn’t seem to notice. He smiled, revealing his startlingly white teeth. “Great to meet you, Mr. Potter. I wish it were under better circumstances, of course…”
They continued for only a few minutes longer before Draco came in Harry’s mouth, hot and salty and quick. He writhed underneath Harry, who took it all gladly.
didn’t want to say ‘crush.’
They sat in silence for a minute, Draco watching Potter carefully and wondering if he’d done the right thing in coming here. Maybe even
“It’s not especially comforting when you tell me you like me, but then look like you’re contemplating how to tell me you ran over my dog.”
I believe.”
"I reckon home, but it's a bit far..."
Draco tensed; Weasley’s voice served as a reminder of the outside world, so different from this strange limbo consisting of him, Potter, and the balcony. It reminded him that he wasn’t wanted - that he was undesirable and wrong and Potter was everything but.
They stood in the dim hallway and looked at each other.
He still couldn’t believe he was here - years after admiring Harry from afar and masking his arousal by being the world’s biggest prat to him and his friends. After being so ashamed of himself and so overwhelmed by Harry at the beginning of the school year. But somehow, after all the blood and sweat and tears, after nearly killing each other, after saving each other, they were here. They had wound up in Harry’s bed with Harry looking at him like he had never seen anything so beautiful in his life.
They crashed into each other, mouths working like they needed each other to breathe, and Draco’s hands traveled all over Harry, wanting to see and touch all of him. Remembering how good last night was just made him all the more impatient, and Draco pushed Harry back, making them both stumble toward Harry’s bed.
, so she’d continued to research ways to aid him by herself.
Harry could only nod, disarmed by this side of Malfoy. Even more shocking was the slight smile Malfoy gave him – a real one this time.
“Gin – “
This was Draco’s rationale as he wrote a letter in the affirmative to Ginevra that night.
Harry nibbled his bottom lip. Then nodded slowly.
The three of them sat in silence for a several minutes; a knock at the door made them all jump.
“Not hungry,” he mumbled. “Long day. I’m going back to the dorm.”
“Fourth year? Oh, you mean the ball?” Draco nearly laughed. “Salazar, no. It was never like that between us.”
called me by my title.”
Draco turned, rolling his eyes, and saw that Astoria was at her shoulder, looking just as annoyed as Draco felt. Christmas holiday had done her good, it seemed; though she appeared to be bored, he saw that telltale spark in her clear blue eyes. She was wearing a new coat and a smirk.
“As I’m sure you know, anxiety is a common symptom for both types of withdrawal you’re going through. Aside from giving you a Draught of Peace, the only thing to do is wait it out.”
“Is this alright?”
“Well, on Christmas Eve, I got attacked by Nagini, who was hiding in a corpse, by the way, and my wand broke. So I was out of commission the next few days.”
“Thanks, Malfoy.”
"Don't say that, Harry. You are."
He gestured towards the door.
did not appreciate the radical increase of paperwork that came with it all. Draco could have done without that bit. Scarlett sympathized with his struggles, but firmly insisted that he put forth his best effort to appease the Ministry.
The twisty feeling in his stomach disappeared as quickly as it had come.
He was enjoying his second (small) mug of coffee when Ira came in. They blinked at Draco suspiciously, as if to check if he was really there, before walking into the lounge completely.
“I promise you that it’ll be fine. They wouldn’t have invited you if they didn’t want you here. And even if they don’t want to be civil, they
“Foul, isn’t it?” she asked him. “Suppose you never noticed cos you were so used to it.”
When they’d gotten to the Great Hall, Draco noted with apprehension that there were hardly any people inside. Even worse, three of the four rows of House tables had been pushed to the walls, leaving only a singular table in the center where McGonagall, a few professors, and a handful of students sat.
He didn’t move.
“No, I’m glad you did,” Draco said conversationally, even though his nose was just a centimeter away from Harry’s. Harry shivered from their closeness and didn't know where to look. “I don’t know how I’d explain waking up to Harry Potter’s corpse.”
“Harry, while I can’t claim to understand what you’re doing exactly, you don’t appear to be under the influence of a potion,” Macmillan started off, straightening his back to look taller than he was, “So I assume you’re safe.”
again.”
“I – fine,” Draco said feebly.
“Because you invited me, or don’t you remember?”
Last night still felt surreal for Harry. He didn't even know what he was thinking at first. He had felt strong enough to walk down the halls in his Cloak for the first time since Ginny had brought it to him. If he
Draco thought he’d heard him wrong.
“What – no I’m not! You’re the one who’s taking it the wrong way.”
He made his next move after careful consideration. Harry was better at chess than Draco thought he’d be.
“Like I said, I've had worse. Don't concern yourself with it.”
Potter eyed him. Draco wondered what he was thinking.
"You were in the same bloody year. And in Slug Club."
Potter chose this moment to break the silence between them.
“Is that right?” That fucking smirk appeared on his face.
They pulled the covers out from underneath them (with much effort), and collapsed into bed once more. Harry pulled Draco in close, so close that his back was pressed against Harry’s warm skin, still sticky with sweat. Harry draped an arm over him.
Harry gritted his teeth. So Hermione would try to pass it off as him not being clear-headed as well?
“I am not adorable!” Draco said crossly as he lightly smacked Harry’s arm. “What’s wrong with you? Do you need a stronger prescription for those ridiculous glasses?”
Potter didn't argue this. Draco took a deep breath and stepped forward, holding out the letter.
“Go on. This is a safe space.”
“She’s what? Spit it out,” said Draco, now perplexed.
Leonel’s eyes were bright as he smiled lopsidedly.
“Harry?” Ron asked, snapping him out of his thoughts. “You alright, mate?”
“Draco,” Kathy said in her Warning Tone. “Have you forgotten the rules?”
Draco tried for a weak glare.
“I think Zabini’s had a bad influence on her,” Potter mumbled, fiddling with a teaspoon.
“I was doing paperwork at around two and was heading to the lounge for coffee when I heard something behind me. And it was bloody Potter underneath that bloody Cloak of his.”
“Do you not know how to pick up after yourself, Potter?”
“I slept with Draco,” Harry said quickly, his face growing increasingly hot. “Last night. I just – I dunno.”
I'm so so so sorry, so much shit happening right now and also that pesky ol' depression is acting up again. But here's the chapter at long last! Hint: still don't know what I'm doing or where I'm headed. Thanks for being so endlessly patient.
Draco set the glass down and gasped for air, trying to recall last night’s events as he did so. They came back to him slowly, the gaps filling themselves in. He’d gotten far drunker than he would’ve liked, thrown up in front of Potter, and then the idiot had told Draco that he’d died.
, for instance) when Weasley piped up.
“I swear I usually don’t that easily,” Draco said with effort, “You’re just…”
“You don’t need to apologize for anything,” Harry said, his voice soft and kind. It made Draco feel even guiltier; he didn’t deserve this, he didn’t deserve Harry. “I know the war’s affected you…like it’s affected me, just in different ways.”
“But you
“In December, sir.”
"How sweet. Will you reach out to him, or will you wait?"
“Brilliant, thanks,” said Harry, already reaching to open one of the boxes.
He was reaching breaking point, Draco knew. He opened his eyes and looked up at Harry – so fit, gorgeous beyond imagination, and all his, just Draco’s –
“Come in,” he called out, not looking up from his parchment.
“I don’t know what to expect, Healer you with all the reassuring words and kind smiles versus rude you who really just gets off on insulting me. And fucking me,” Harry added thoughtfully.
Draco hesitated before answering softly. “You want me to spend time with your friends in that capacity?”
Weasley didn’t look too happy either. Her red hair was blowing in the wind, whipping around her frowning face, and she made no move to pull it back.
They sat in silence for a moment, and then,
"I did, yes," Draco said. He sat back down at the foot of his bed. "I think you can see that I'm not really fit for company at the moment."
“One more,” Harry said, and stretched out his arm.
“I know that,” she snapped harshly – on the defensive again. “You think I don’t? I mean it, though. I’ll chain myself to him if it means it’ll stop him from using.”
“She did,” Malfoy answered slowly. “I saw her for quite a bit of time and I’ve come out for the better. I hope my…personal testimony will harden your resolve, if anything.”
“What? Draco? Where are you going?”
“Remind me never to drink whisky again.”
“I’m not a child,” he thought he heard her say stubbornly, though he was really focused on Harry’s taste and scent.
Thank you for all of the nice comments, they really do make my day better
He was immediately enveloped by Hermione and hugged her back tightly.
Comments, kudos, and bookmarks are everything. Thanks all. Hope you enjoy.
“Yes.” Granger sighed. “I wish I had the exact details down…how I didn’t think to remember everything before…”
Harry Apparated them a short walk away from the Burrow. Draco walked rigidly, looking this way and that as they made their way to the door.
"Erm," Draco said, and checked his watch. "8:32."
But then Potter fell silent, his gaze once again set firmly on the fireplace. Draco sat and watched him for a few moments before catching his attention.
A figure appeared a few meters away from him, and Draco reflexively pointed his wand at it. He blinked, then,
“Are you sure it isn’t because you love to overshare?” Draco asked quietly, his eyes avoiding Harry’s.
Harry winced. “They kept me in a cupboard until I was eleven.”
"Really?"
Draco obeyed and walked inside, closing the door and sitting in the chair opposite Ira. He watched as they finished up what looked to be a rough draft of a potions recipe. Ira exhaled with a broad smile and looked up at Draco.
"No."
“Excellent,” Malfoy murmured, his eyes also on the list.
“No thanks,” Draco said, cutting Potter off and slumping further against the stall wall. “Would
, and nothing can take its meaning away. Even if the Dark Lord’s dead, even if it’s been a year, even if it’s been ten years, whatever - it’ll still have the same connotation.”
“I knew no one would be here,” Draco answered, his voice croaky. “Or if somewhere were here, it’d be Moaning Myrtle, who already knows just how mental I am.”
“Great!” he said too loudly, trying for a smile. It looked more like a grimace. “Let’s all sit down, we shouldn’t, er, crowd the area.”
“Of course, Harry,” she said, smiling softly down at him. “I’ll make sure to keep the masses at bay for a while, all right?”
“What kind of food do you think you can eat?”
"Malfoy? What time is it?"
“Hermione was pleased,” Harry said with a smile. “Said she was happy for me, happy that I could stop sulking constantly. Ron was more surprised than anything. But I think – I think it’s helping him realize that I’m serious about this, about us. About you.”
“Not much, I’m afraid,” Draco admitted. “We’re a hospital, not a prison. We can’t force Potter to stay here, and as for you…you can’t force a person into recovery. We can try, and try we will, but ultimately, it’s up to Potter to make the decision – to decide that he wants to recover.
Harry gave an apologetic grimace, and Hermione nodded, understanding, and pulled her hand back.
Draco felt embarrassed.
Harry looked at him from the corner of his eye; he reckoned Estrada was an upstanding Healer, what with the way he didn’t look bothered at all and was carrying on like Harry was the usual type of patient they got in the ward, and that Malfoy always interacted with patients like this.
Potter’s brows were furrowed but he didn’t push it. Apparently resigned to dropping the subject, he picked up his fork again. His eyes flicked up at Draco.
“Ravenclaw. My family wasn’t too pleased. I’m a Burke, you see,” she explained.
Draco’s lips were surprisingly soft and Harry barely had to work to nudge them open; they gave way easily and soon it was all open-mouthed kisses and Harry could barely get enough of him. His senses were flooded by Draco, the taste of him, the smell, the sound – god, the little noises he made – and he wanted more –
Draco stiffened. “We’ll be sure not to be so ‘all over each other’ in the future, then.”
“Right, Leonel. Let him drink it.”
“What were you two up to, anyway?”
Draco ushered Harry away from the table of sweets to somewhere where no one could overhear them.
Harry frowned.
"I'm gay," Draco said quickly.
Draco staggered back to his bed and nearly cried. He knew he'd overdone it last night. He'd been purging less since his tentative friendship with Potter had started and to go back full force after all this time had clearly taken a toll on his body.
Draco stiffened; he was going to kill Pansy. It was bad enough that she was telling Draco that he was idolizing Harry and that he didn’t know what he was doing; it was another thing entirely for her to threaten Harry when Draco had his back turned.
"I would," Draco said suddenly. His eyes skimmed the group impassively. Harry was surprised (and so were many others), and nearly leaned forward in his seat. Kathy nodded, and he continued. "I had a panic attack a few days ago. It'd been a while since my last so this one left me a bit shaken."
He stared at his reflection’s panicked eyes.
“But it’s not someone I, err, got along with.”
Harry nearly let out a startled laugh but kept his mouth shut, not wanting to scare Draco off. He was dazed, his already hazy mind spinning with this unexpected turn of events. What did this mean? Why wasn’t Draco pushing him away? Had they ever touched like this before? Was the last time they’d touched in the Room of Requirement, surrounded by cursed flames and Draco’s panicked breathing on his neck and his hands gripping Harry so tightly it hurt?
“Right,” he said. And then he realized his problem. Apparently talking about trauma made Harry lose his erection. He said shamefully, “But I, er, kind of lost it.”
Later that night, Draco bravely wrote a cordial letter explaining that he had a nice time and would he please provide Draco with his mobile number so they could communicate that way also?
appointment later on, but Harry, how did you even forget you had it when you made all that fuss about me being free to be here yesterday?”
Draco stared at it, unable to think of anything to say. He didn’t want to have to take it; Potter shouldn’t have to be uncomfortable just because of his forgetfulness. But he did know that he was cold, and Potter was offering, and the scarf would surely smell like him…
Draco and Astoria trailed along after Pansy and Daphne, who seemed to be discussing a seventh year who’d recently
Draco was ripping apart a bread roll when Pansy brought up the game during dinner.
“I’m so sorry, Potter, but I actually
He took Draco’s hand and they walked closer to the water’s edge, where they both sat down, huddled close for warmth. Draco took one last pull from his cigarette before Vanishing it.
“I swear,” Draco gasped as Harry came to rest at his side, a horrible (wonderful) smile on his face.
Kathy led them through the exercise. Harry breathed along with the rest of the group. This time, he didn’t open his eyes until Kathy told them to, wanting to get the full Experience of the relaxation exercise. He still wasn’t sure if it helped, but it couldn’t hurt.
Harry looked at him a bit longer. Then he sat up.
Potter seemed embarrassed; he ducked his head down and stared at his hands.
Harry rolled his eyes. "I dunno about that."
“Yes. Of course.”
Harry checked the clock that hung menacingly on the wall. Two minutes. Two minutes, and Malfoy would be here to escort him to his office and let him Floo to Wolff’s.
“You’re improving quickly, and I must say I’m impressed,” Malfoy said begrudgingly. He checked the time, glancing at a silver watch on his thin wrist. “Your heart rate is still too fast, but that’s to be expected. I’d like to ask you a series of questions to evaluate how you’re doing, alright? I can ask Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger to leave if you’d like.”
Draco jumped violently and banged his shoulder against the side of the stall. He winced and bit his lip to avoid crying out.
“No, I want to too,” Harry finally said, dilated eyes meeting Draco’s own. “I’m - let’s. Please. Just – fuck, Draco, fuck me.”
Ira looked up. “Oh! No, come in. Please. I’ll just take another moment.”
“Here,” Draco said, and cast a warming charm on both of them. He’d had practice over the years.
“They certainly are," agreed Draco.
Harry scoffed. "Thanks, Malfoy."
“Try again, then,” she rolled her eyes. “You were never one to give up easy, Malfoy. But even if he doesn’t, it’s only two days ‘til Monday. He can talk about it then to his Mind Healer.”
Draco stalked around his flat in search of a week-old
Potter ignored these questions and instead said, “Could you put that down?”
“Yes,” Draco answered, his voice weaker than he would have liked. “I’d like that.”
you like it?”
Harry turned to face Draco sharply. “How could you say that? I almost killed you, Draco-“
Harry shook his head, unwilling to tell her that he was afraid to.
Harry shoveled his face with food. “Don’t wanna hear about that.”
Merlin, it was even worse up close. Draco looked down at his notes immediately after reaching Potter’s bright (though apprehensive) eyes. It was like looking at the sun; he was too bright, too powerful, and Draco was just a terrible, depressed pile of nerves. He managed to look up long enough to meet Potter’s gaze, hoping there was no pink tinge to his cheeks.
But it was none of those things. There was surprise, yes, but Draco couldn’t detect anything remotely negative in his expression.
“I never knew,” Malfoy said. His face was nearly expressionless, but there was a hint of remorse in his grey eyes. There were bags under them.
“No, that’s fine.”
The mirror mended itself, Potter’s wand nowhere in sight.
“Like I said,” Astoria murmured, pulling Draco out of his thoughts, “A bit off.”
The frown deepened.
He hadn’t been careful. He could easily have been caught on a number of occasions, but this today was much too close for comfort.
Ginny stared at him with wide eyes for a good five seconds before bursting into laughter.
“They were good,” Draco replied shortly, still cross with her.
Draco caught on; his cheeks colored slightly.
“What do you usually do with her?”
But Draco needed the strings. He needed the connection, the monogamy, the dedication. He knew for a fact that he didn't have feelings for Leo anymore. He had long-ago accepted why they'd broken up in the first place. He shouldn't go back. He couldn't. It wouldn't be good for either of them.
“Er,” Harry said again. Draco could barely look at him. “I am, yeah. Safe, I mean.”
Draco was goaded into attending by Blaise, Pansy, Daphne, and Astoria, who seemed to have snuck into the Common Room at some point and seemed very intent on staying. Draco had almost convinced himself that he’d be fine holed up in his room, away from the noise and commotion, when Blaise had come in unexpectedly and regarded Draco with judgmental eyes.
