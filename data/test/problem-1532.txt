“The aurors read everything, I know,” Draco said. “I was there at the trial. It was nearly three years ago. You don’t have to walk on eggshells around me.” He tried for a reassuring smile.
Ron has gone with him to every single one of the Death Eater trials the months after the Battle. It was nearly three or four times a week for four months, but Ron had understood why Harry had to be there.
Malfoy pulled back and gave an annoyed huff. He ignored Harry’s question. People were doing that a lot today. “For some reason, my mother thinks we’re… a thing,”
“And she, of course, was a witch, and of course she had a camera. One of those new small ones. She snapped a picture and went to talk to me and nearly forced me to give her an interview. Then a few of her friends showed up and I was signing autographs and someone asked me about where I was living, and I said the Bahamas, and she said I looked rather pale for the Caribbean, why don’t I go get a drink with her,” At this, he looked down into the coffee cup, and Draco could have sworn a little more of it evaporated.
Draco nodded. He’d left taking care of his father up to his mother. He didn’t know what ‘the bottle’ was.
Draco sat, breathing heavily in front of the fireplace, wand clutched in one hand. It was shaking slightly. He needed a coffee.
Malfoy had moved to reclining on the clothing rack sometime during all of this. “Surely we’ve exhausted the rainbow? Honestly, Potter, they all look good. Just pick one,” he said, waving his elegant hands like an aristocrat.
“Anyway, That’s really all I have to report. Love you all, goodnight.” Harry shut off the transmitter.
Mr Potter to put in a word or two for us.” He ran a finger along a particularly large photograph of the Savior’s face.
“Finding me?” Potter repeated, and Draco knew he had said something wrong. “Nobody finds me accidentally, Malfoy. I hid myself. There are no connections to me here. No one–”
It was a wonderful Wednesday afternoon to be alive. Draco left the articles strewn about the flat. He would continue preparing the shop for a couple hours, and then he would go see Campbell and Elise about a dinner.
In answer, Malfoy snatched one of the books he’d been referencing out of the air. It had an ancient-looking black leather cover. He opened it. “This is a collection of research done by my ancestors concerning the magical properties of Malfoy Manor. Here,” He said, walking over to where Harry lay and dropping the book beside him. “If you’ll read it, it’ll give you a lot of insight into why the case Hermione and I are working on is so nuanced,”
When Harry’s ankle was suitably oiled, Draco looked back at him. Harry, who had definitely not been looking at Draco’s mouth, brought his gaze up.
“No,” Harry said. “So I won’t even know if you make a mistake. It’ll probably improve chopsticks: Russian edition, at any rate,”
Potter had the dignity to look confused. He cocked his head like a puppy, green eyes wide and sparkling but with the depth of an ocean.
Sorry this took a minute. I would have had it updated wayyyyy sooner, but I had finals a few weeks ago and then I had to turn my school laptop in. Now I've got my grandpa's dinosaur laptop up and running, but no promises on how soon I'll have the next one up.... hopefully before summer's over.
“Did ya get this from the trash? It looks like it was thrown outta a back window somewhere,” The man at the radio store said.
“I was just telling your mother about the time you let a sheep into my house and it pooed all over the floor,” Potter said, smile still on his face, but there was a competitive edge in his eyes. “Made a right mess of the place. You never did tell me exactly how it got in,”
Potter might be trying to get back here. He might have gotten caught up in some sort of neo-Death Eater scheme. Yaxley. Was Yaxley still around? Draco hadn’t been paying much attention around the time of the trials. Wait. Yaxley was dead. Wasn’t he?
The articles caught Potter in increasingly disheveled poses. One, dated a month before his disappearance, showed him at a muggle supermarket in pajama pants smelling peaches. The caption read: Savior of the Wizarding World… Too Good For His Own Kind?
He laughed. Draco let a small smile creep across his own face. It wasn’t his fault. The host just had an infectious sort of laugh, that’s all.
Pansy grimaced. “Your mother received an owl from Gringotts. They want to inspect the manor for repossession,”
She opened her mouth to say what Harry knew had to be concerning, stressful news. So he interrupted her.
Surprise, of course, was why Draco didn’t protest when Potter started carrying him, bridal style, around to the front of his store. He was outraged, he was scandalized. He wasn’t at all enjoying the experience, and any appreciation for Potter’s toned arms and pecs was grudging.
It was a full, yet strangely tinkly laugh. It was the sort of laugh that was too loud in libraries but too quiet in pubs, and the sort of laugh he’d know anywhere, no matter how much time had passed.
“I’d… I’d actually rather Pott–Harry step out for this,” Draco said to the floor. Then he looked up to see Potter’s hurt face and stumbled over himself to explain. “See, as he’s part of the case Hermione’s building for me, she’s told me it’s better if his testimony is given without the knowledge that–without this knowledge. Sorry,” Draco said, reaching out to squeeze Potter’s hand as he stood to leave.
He looked at his hands. They were shaking. He lowered them onto the cool kitchen counter Merlin, Harry Potter. Of all the wizards he could accidentally meet, it had to be the one who owed him the least.
He hadn’t had the strength to look back at Harry as he’d fled the room, too busy thinking about patronuses and too soon and what if and soulmates and everything and nothing.
“I’m not, am I?” Potter asked, but it wasn’t a question. He stood up. “If you don’t have anything else to say, I guess I’ll be going.”
i'm having a grand ol time writing this (still) and reading your comments motivates me so much y'all don't even know.
One-hundred six, one-hundred seven, one-hundred eight, one-hundred nine, one-hundred ten, one-hundred eleven, one-hundred twelve, one-hundred thirteen, one-hundred fourteen, one-hundred fifteen, one-hundred sixteen, one-hundred seventeen, one-hundred eighteen, one-hundred nineteen, one-hundred twenty, one-hundred twenty-one, one-hundred twenty-two, one-hundred twenty-three, one-hundred twenty-four, one-hundred twenty-five, one-hundred twenty-six, one-hundred twenty-seven, one-hundred twenty-eight, one-hundred twenty-nine, one-hundred thirty, one-hundred thirty-one, one-hundred thirty-two, one-hundred thirty-three, one-hundred thirty-four.
Harry pulled on his trainers and walked out the door, Stella bounding happily behind him. He kept his eyes trained on the shadows, that one week of Auror training kicking in. The white-blond shock of hair evaded him, or maybe it wasn’t there at all. Maybe, he hoped, Malfoy had made it a week and decided he wasn’t going to get Harry to talk to him. Maybe this would be the end of it.
After all, if someone came along and asked for Grimmauld Place, he’d sell it to them. Hell, he’d even give it away for free to the right person. The whole place was a little more than a trash heap, especially since Kreacher wasn’t there to care for it.
“Stray. Not plural. I’m pretty sure there’s only one of him,” she answered, glancing questioningly back at Draco.
Harry struggled against the force. If he could just give one little noise out of the ordinary, one stray creak or thump, he was sure Malfoy would come over and investigate. And it’s Malfoy’s house, after all. He could save Harry from whatever this was.
She pulled sharply at the little hairs at the crown of his head. “I said asking, not whoring! But guess who it’s for?”
Draco opened his eyes at what had to be an ungodly hour in the morning, since he could hear Potter’s rustling about. He could picture it, Potter’s good leg rifling through the blankets to find his glasses, the sunlight filtering in the room creating a halo on Potter’s hair, Potter himself still dressed in Draco’s old shirt and a pair of boxers, his nice clothes from yesterday hung from the walls next to him. Draco refused to look, though. He might never stop looking.
He didn’t have his glasses on, but he’d be damned if he’d ask Narcissa to help him with that. Harry wasn’t sure if he should respect her or fear her, and in his indecision had simply settled with a healthy dose of both.
Why was Malfoy here, anyway? It wasn’t to eavesdrop on him for the press, certainly. He already had a place to live, and even after his family had paid reparations there had to have been more than enough money for Malfoy to get a flat anywhere else. The whole mess with the Manor or whatever could probably be solved if Malfoy just lived there. Well, Harry wasn’t very clear on exactly what Malfoy’s case entailed since no one had explained it to him, but if the Ministry wanted to house and Malfoy didn’t, it didn’t make any sense to Harry why he didn’t just let the Ministry take the house. It’s what Harry would have done.
The muggle radio and his gripes with the ministry and the prophet disapparated as Draco begun the process of cleaning up the empty store.
“Mr. Potter,” she said, no hint of impolite interest or curiosity in her voice, “How long have you been courting my son?”
Potter’s brow furrowed. “I took several outfits from your closet at Campbell and Elise’s and brought them to mine. I hope you don’t mind,”
He closed his eyes, thought of Campbell and Elise’s Christmas in July party last year. He’d felt so loved, so accepted.
Draco walked up the steps and poised to knock. His knuckles rapped the green-painted wood of the front door. He heard the dog bark and felt the telltale ripple of wards alerting the owner. Surprisingly, Potter hadn’t warded against Draco. That wasn’t a bad sign.
A cool wash of magic flowed over him. He whipped around. Malfoy was there, but before Harry could demand an explanation he hissed:
At least there was a storefront downstairs and a floo. REFS also offered employment for their ‘cases.’ Draco was going to start a coffee shop. With any luck the Scots would appreciate fine coffee when they saw it.
Draco rolled his eyes carefully, to assure they absolutely didn’t notice the violent red he was sure his ears had turned. “I hate you both. What’s for lunch?”
People kept talking about raccoons in conjunction with him, too, which was frightening, since Harry still didn’t know what exactly Arnie had to do with raccoons. He hoped it was benign, but he strongly suspected it was questionable at best.
“Mind telling me who you belong to? I’m looking for Potter, if you know him, and I need all the allies I can get.” He stopped petting it for a second, and the dog pawed him impatiently. It barked again.
“–any leftovers?” Campbell was saying “I know you planned to join us for lunch, but he was already gone,”
Narcissa nodded grimly. “The only reason they didn’t take the Manor before was because of the trial,”
Potter pulled some sort of a rude face, but before Draco could properly analyze it, his entire body folded in on itself like a telescope and was shoved through a pneumatic tube that sent him straight into Potter’s kitchen. Actually, he wasn’t, but Potter had graciously apparated them both without telling Draco.
Elise nodded and Harry didn’t like the knowing glint in her eye at all. “He’s right in there. Ask him yourself,” she said, stepping back so Harry could see Malfoy, currently sorting through what appeared to be at least a hundred books.
He checked the time. How bloody long would it take for Potter to apparate some creeper to London and back? He was the most powerful wizard in the fucking world. Draco took an annoyed sip, then let it swish around his mouth.
Draco tried to shoot Potter a glare of pure potential murder, but the blasted man was making direct eye contact with Mr Ager. Honestly, some people think performing a spell correctly is more valuable than looking at Draco. How rude.
Two minutes later (precisely two, that is. Pansy was nothing if not precise) two magazines articles arrived at the window.
Harry looked at the man who sat at the piano bench with a lost, unguarded expression. He looked content, but the tension in his shoulders and feet spoke of fear. Harry knew fear. Of what, Harry wasn’t sure, but whatever Malfoy was feeling was outlined and highlighted by it.
“He was already gone,” she said, turning back to her embroidery, voice cold and devoid of emotion. “Must have left as soon as he healed.”
“Shut up, Potter. It’s storytime,” Malfoy said, summoning his chair over so he could sit next to Harry’s bed. He put his feet up on the bed, and rested the chair against the wall. Then he began to read.
(also fun fact I've never watched anime before this shit kinda slap but also why are anime fans so scary)
Harry was too startled to do the sensible thing (hexing Malfoy and running away). Actually, that wouldn’t be the honorable thing, though. Malfoy was evidently staying at the Mum’s as a guest. So wasn’t it Harry’s responsibility to save them from the impending evil and scheming devices of Draco Malfoy?
The dragons on the piano started to move. As Malfoy played, they swirled around. Malfoy would play two notes, then as he echoed them with a higher-pitched repetition the dragons responded. It was like that old animated muggle movie.
But a door loomed at the end of the hall, wooden with hippogriffs chiseled into it. It was the door to Lucius’s study, but this wasn’t the hallway it belonged to.
She was watching him stare dumbly at the bed, not moving but wanting to do a million things at once. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he asked, the words falling from his mouth like the dust in the sunlight before him.
Right, right. Owls can’t digest plant-based products. But the owl didn’t know that, and Draco wasn’t about to tell it.
Harry could make out something on the papers Draco was sorting through. It was something about ownership of ancient wizarding estates.
Someone had given Draco a gift. Someone had had faith in Draco. Draco had been his teacher’s favorite.
She sat the large bowl of pasta in the center of the table for all to admire. Which Harry did, before serving himself a rather large portion.
The TV stand creaked as Draco pulled his legs up onto it to sit cross-legged. “Why the hell would they do that?”
“He’ll think it’s all my fault and then we’ll get into it and I just woke up but I wouldn’t hesitate to- why are you here, anyway? And what’s in the bottle?”
Blaise’s green-cast face disappeared for a minute. Soon, it reappeared, but attached to a body standing in Draco’s poor excuse for a living room. Luckily, short hair was currently
Draco let his head fall back into the sofa. “I’ve already been in. Trust me, if Harry was hiding somewhere in there, I would have noticed.”
The device was obviously the muggle version of a radio. It also showed the time. Or at least he assumed it would once it was fixed. Draco tinkered with the contraption for the two hours until lunch, then skipped lunch and tinkered more. It wasn’t like he could really buy anything anyways. There wasn’t a Gringotts in Merlin’s Armpit, Scotland where he could exchange his galleons for pounds and ounces or whatever.
anyway, I love comments!! please tell me if you're enjoying the read so far, if I should get on my horse and update faster, and especially if you're not enjoying it or are disappointed. I welcome criticism!!
Malfoy placed the folder on the music rack, slight, nimble fingers removing the sheets of music and placing them side by side. He took a deep breath.
Pansy was nodding along. “So, darling, what’s the first plan of attack? Groveling? Money? A good old seduction?”
It’s not like there’s much to do in a small town besides work and eat, and eat to work, and work to eat. And any other possible combination of those two words. They were big words, when you got down to it, Harry thought, rinsing vegetables. They encompassed the universal human experience. Work. Eat. Harry’d done that since birth and would continue to do it until the day he died.
Potter was in China, Potter was kidnapped, Potter was in India. Potter sightings became a sort of craze. Was he in Barbados, after all? Living in Canada, speaking French? This man looked sort of like him, let’s stalk him for a week. Here at
“What?” Malfoy looked up sharply from the pots and pans he was anally arranging so their handles all pointed in the same direction. “Of course I eat! I just haven’t gotten groceries in a few days,”
Harry nodded, stood up, and went to talk with Narcissa Malfoy. And, possibly, the squadron of aurors escorting her.
“But he wasn’t sure if that was fair. So he asked Georgia about it and she said that she didn’t want to date a man with a guilty conscience. And Victor realized that it wasn’t his wife holding him back, it was himself. And now they’re the happiest couple who’d ever complain about you breathing too much air.”
She winced. “It may be over a month. I’ll see what Ron can do to stop the Aurors from the inspection, but we need a larger campaign. Ron mentioned to me…”
He couldn’t remember the last time he had been down here. It had to have been in the past week or so. It had to. But he couldn’t remember which day, or what time.
“You’ve picked up any of his lingo?” Harry asked Lydia as soon as the kitchen door swung shut behind them.
He thought, really thought for a second about how easy it would be to let the call go to voicemail, pretend he had really disappeared, never talk to anyone again except the people in this little Scottish village.
“Of course. Do you have any of that Kona type?” She adjusted her kneazle earrings. They smelled like they were made of real kneazle fur.
Harry tried to wiggle the fingers on his right hand. He stared at them, begging them to move, do something. They remained stiff, taunting him. Little bitches. Ungrateful. But under a hell of an immobilizing charm. He had to give credit to whichever Malfoy’s wandwork it was.
Harry had the self preservation to not follow him, and the door shut swiftly. The sound of the shower startled him a bit. Did Death Eaters shower? Malfoy had seemed clean. Maybe only poncy git Death Eaters took showers. Poncy git
“Study, study, study,” he muttered in a sing-song sort of way. He turned onto a hallway he didn’t recognize and slowed.
Harry walked over to sit on the stoop next to the old man. “It’s alright. I forget things all the time, it’s not a sign of anything. Just the other day I lost my sock while I was–”
He suspected Potter was thinking similar thoughts, as his face carried and expression that didn’t suit him well: thoughtfulness.
Lucius’s eyes flicked up to Draco, then his face twisted together in a mixture of anger and confusion. “You’re with
He went to Campbell and Elise the next day, and he was already spilling out the story before he crossed the threshold into their apartment.
Draco played with the idea of running away, maybe immigrating to the States. He could ask Lydia for some rips. He took a deep breath to steady himself and took Potter’s hand.
“Straight-Laced Savior–Anything But?” the first article was titled. It remarked on Potter’s apparent single status and his lack of motivation to find a new girlfriend, but had very little substance.
Harry instructed, “All you have to do is an even coating of both on the crust.” She gave him a grateful look.
He whirled around, which was quite difficult to do with one foot on one step and the other on another.
“Good question. I’m actually, um, just taking an inventory right now. Finding out what to fix, based on my large repertoire of cooking skills,” He said, turning back to his assortment of cookware.
The sheep seemed to nod to him, and Draco went on his way. He forced himself to remain relaxed. Loosen your shoulders, he told himself, Potter can smell your fear.
Draco closed his eyes, took a deep breath. Don’t let Potter see how you’re shaking the coffee mugs, don’t let him see you’ve spilled some over the side. “Do you want a coffee, Potter?”
“Pity,” Potter said, a bit of a smirk pulling at his lips. “That’d be a fun game. But who would I be making bets with, exactly? The piano?”
“Oh, yes. The real breadwinner of the Potter family: butternut squash,” he said, fiddling with the number four key.
Malfoy made an expression like someone had shoved dung under his nose. “Kindly call back your animal. We have an appointment,”
And he saw the empty bed. He saw it with his mindless little eyes and he tried to process it, but the damn fog in his brain didn’t let him. The daylight streamed through the window, rays of sunshine illuminating little dust specs and falling gently on the makeshift bed, sheets mussed like its user had just stepped out to take a piss in the middle of the night.
“You poked around Abford for several hours, but even after asking the neighbors, you found no sign of Draco Malfoy,” Potter said firmly.
But every night, without fail, Draco listened to the radio man. He wasn’t sure quite why. Maybe it brought him back to before all the reparations stuff, when moving here was more about coffee and a little quarrel than, well, learning how to feed himself and a much larger quarrel.
George didn’t spare him so much as a grateful look, but he took a heavy seat on the stoop of his back porch anyway. “You know, I was going to tell you something. I’ve been waiting until I could run into you for months,”
3. Not much research has been done on ‘matched’ patroni, where two people produce a male/female animal pair (ex. Doe and stag, bull and cow), but in the few cases studied, the couples had been married for over half a century.
Harry had been sitting in the crumbling study staring at his last trainee exam, which he’d failed spectacularly. It was late at night or early in the morning, maybe both. He’d been shut in there for two days, dreading his return to the Auror Academy on Monday. Some bloody Savior he was, defeated by a multiple choice exam on apparition licensing laws, of all things. It should have been easy. Ron hadn’t even studied.
“Great,” Draco said, attempting to stab another noodle but finding there were none left. “Thank you for the dinner, it was delicious,”
“No. I slept on the sofa last night,” For only a few hours. Draco had been having trouble sleeping since, well, since he was about sixteen. He was twenty-one now.
“Hermione,” he said. She started at the sound of her given name, then seemed to remember she asked him to call her that. “I met him earlier today. He said he didn’t want to see me again,”
“Hey, brightest witch of my age, remember? After–after you left, all the DMLE wizards were hounding me for some internship or something,” she said, throwing her hands up, then laying them to rest on the little table.
Lydia didn’t follow them outside. “I’ll just clean up inside, yeah? Can’t stand the midges, there’s been a lot of them around lately,”
He tried to grunt, tried to scream, tried to move, tried to signal somehow that he was here, but he couldn’t. Harry couldn’t move. He felt his blood pressure spike, the ringing in his ears increase to an almost painful level.
Draco didn’t miss the implication that if he had been around, his mother would be watching daytime dramas and the movie channel.
“Yes, I am. And yes, I know. Do you mind if I summon some ingredients? Your excuse for a kitchen have very much to offer in terms of spices. Or anything, really.”
The radio man said, sounding more unsure of himself than Draco’d heard him in the past. He sounded a little raw, more vulnerable, like his throat was threatening to crack on every pitch.
seriously though, thank you all for your support and i'll have the next chapter coming within two weeks (no schedule we die like men)!
That’s the channel George had written for ‘local culture.’ Draco hadn’t known muggles broadcasted radio shows for that, or even that such a show would be broadcasting from Abford, of all places. George had also written on the
Stella zig-zagged through the mostly empty street. She sniffed every rock, peed on every patch of grass. Stella was just such a dog, and Harry loved her for it.
The dog in question tilted her head as if she was listening, then curled up on the mat in front of the oven.
Sure, Potter could look the part with his gorgeous robes and gorgeous hair and gorgeous eyes, but when Narcissa asked him about his intentions with the Wizengamot, would Potter be able to say anything more than ‘I wanted to get the Death Eater kid to stop bothering me’?
He thought about protesting, but what good would that do? Harry didn’t very well have a good reason as to why he wanted to know about Malfoy’s legal matters, just that he did. He nodded to Hermione and went into the kitchen, closing the door behind him.
“So what’s the plan?” She asked, pointing her wand at the wall. An empty list formed, with ‘seduction’ written at number five.
As he talked he let his right hand drift to the seam on the outer side of Potter’s jeans, toying with it.
Draco ran a finger along the detailing on the fallboard, following the lines of the golden dragon illustrations. It had been ages since he’d played.
Malfoy seemed to be having a similar reaction and barked something in French from behind his magazine.
He finished the little waterfalls of notes, then with a slight bowing of his head and pursing of his lips fell into the next section, a combination of the two he had just played. It was dark, deep, but used the melody he recognized from the lighter section.
This and the rest of the speech was highlighted in pink, and the note in the margin said: “times Orsino is a dramatic bitch”
“I see I’ve ruined your sport, Draco. I might not have if you had taken the courtesy of arriving on time,” Mother said, “I should have had you both for tea, but we shall have to wait for lunch-time,”
It was getting dark out. Though there weren’t many muggles around, Harry didn’t generally like to use lighting charms outside like this. What if he put up muggle repelling charms, and one of his neighbors needed to borrow some flour? It would be rude.
But still, better to be going crazy over the weather and his dog than over Malfoy. That could wait until later.
A curious look came over Potter then, starting somewhere deep in those eyes of his and pooling out to the rest of his face, turning it into an impish grin. “You think I’m pretty?”
Hermione ran a hand through her hair. She had started wearing it brushed out into an afro. It was a good look on her. “Malfoy–”
Malfoy sighed. “You’re rather calm about having bodily harm inflicted on you by an unseen force, aren’t you, Potter?”
“I mean, there’s nothing the Savior responds better to than guilt, right? And if I seem kind, earnest, and completely changed, he’ll be falling to his knees to help me,”
“Sure,” Harry said. After all, it wasn’t like there was much else to do. He was a bedridden invalid, and at least Malfoy looked excited about something.
Draco was finding that Potter’s relationships were of immense speculation to front-page news and tabloids alike. Every so often Draco came across a spread of Potter in various locations with various women. Occasionally he looked disheveled, but more often than not it seemed Potter was simply having a nice lunch with a friend.
Harry nodded. “You’re the one who wanted me to read this, anyway. I don’t see why I’m the highness here, your highness.”
“Then what are you planning to do? Heal him the muggle way, with bandages and casts and the like? We can’t just leave him immobilized for weeks until his bones heal.”
Malfoy went back to the door, opened it. He left and the door swung shut behind him. Harry watched the dust settle again and it dawned on him how utterly alone he was.
Potter opened his mouth, but Draco started first. “And I’m not a fucking Death Eater, okay? Don’t you think I wanted to get away, too?”
...I’ve decided he’s just a little bitch and I don’t want to bother with him any more… The radio man declared. Then after a minute and a half of silence he broke. I dunno. Maybe I will bother him. But he seemed really upset when he ran away. I just hope he doesn’t feel like he has to hide from me. I hope he’s just taking time for himself, honestly. Because I know if I wasn’t here talking about my feelings to my dog and an invisible audience for half an hour straight every day I’d be working myself up into hysterics out in the garden. I’d have destroyed half my crops from overweeding. Anyway, weather report…
Harry was thrown against the window by an unseen force. Before he had time to react, it dragged him under the bench. Harry thrashed against the force, or more like attempted to thrash. It was strong, whatever it was. The lid of the window-seat slammed down on top of him and everything went dark.
The street was paved, but the cobblestones were covered with a layer of dirt capable of stealing a shoe. Draco cast a buoyancy charm. Two kilos.
Draco stared back at her. He fiddled with a piece from the muggle radio. “I don’t know, Pansy. I don’t know,”
He took a deep breath, ruffled his hair in the mirror, took a sip of coffee. It was just a conversation. Draco had those all the time.
It was probably the most Gryffindor thing he had done since moving out to Scotland in the first place.
This was the dance. Gossip, suggestion, dissent. All the dancers knew the tune, knew the steps. Joy comes from a flawless performance. Three dancers, lying and lying just for the kicks.
Draco laid his hands on his father’s shoulders. “No, father. We’re safe. He’s dead for good. Harry Potter killed him,”
At last, the woman made her appearance. She was average height, average build, average face. She was remarkably average if you ignored the paint-stained overalls, bright yellow belt, and bright white flyaway hair. Draco’s overall impression was that of a dandelion puff.
Or maybe Harry just didn’t much feel like getting into a duel today. He watched as Malfoy squinted at the time and pulled his wand from under the pillow. With a wave at the window, light began trickling through the blinds.
Harry closed his mouth. Malfoy seemed honest, but his hand was rather hot and sweaty. Harry untangled their fingers and wiped his on his shirt. “Whatever, Malfoy,”
Draco looked through thick, dark eyelashes (had Potter always had such pretty framing for his eyes?) to find the striking front-page Witch Weekly most gorgeous eyes of the month looking right through him, pupils dilated slightly. Draco could feel the inevitable redness of his face and ears but in this moment, he didn’t really care.
Harry had pushed open the door and the elf was behind it, sure enough. He was laying straight up and down, hands clasped over his stomach like a corpse at a funeral. He was clutching Regulus’s amulet in his gnarled fingers.
“And because of Harry Potter,” Draco muttered. “That great prat,” he added silently, inspecting the embroidered dragons again. They were listening intently.
“I hope this isn’t a sad cautionary story where lack of communication leads to the apocalypse,” Draco deadpanned. “I’m well aware of my problems, don’t worry.”
A sharp knock on the front door had Draco scrabbling for his wand. Luckily, it was in his back pocket. In his
“Gelby!” Draco said, giving the old elf a hug as he opened the front door. “So good to see you again,”
All the Weasleys had come when Bellatrix was finally tried. They had her buried in a pauper’s grave, her money donated to the restoration efforts at Hogwarts.
But an unexpected listener was falling asleep at his Mums’ house while the Mums talked in hushed whispers about what should be done about the Boys, what happened to them, and how to go about getting them to meet one another.
written a letter to the Wizengamot on his behalf. Draco had gotten rid of the daisies, though, so maybe Potter had really just been repaying the favor.
This thought hit him like a bludger to the groin and suddenly everything’s far away. He’s so cold and all Harry wanted to do was sleep.
Harry nodded, watching Malfoy’s lips from across the room. “Read me another,” he said. “You’re good at it.”
Gelby was not accustomed to such displays of affection. “The young master should refrain from clinging to Gelby like a stuffed creature,”
“Lucky enough, you have all the pieces right here. It’s just they’re all broken or in the wrong place. Shouldn’t take me more than an hour or two to fix, if you have an hour or two to spare. Lydia!”
He soon alerted Blaise and Pansy via floo, and they were standing before Draco’s wall of articles and photographs in minutes.
Potter started stamping up the stairs towards the flat, and Draco found himself involuntarily backing up in response. The light inside the flat illuminated Potter’s features, and he noticed the dirt or dust smeared across his face and clothes. His glasses were smudged.
Harry tried to smile, show him he’s really getting on quite nicely, then remembered he didn’t have to. “If that’s all, I better be going. Things to do and all. I’ll talk to you soon.”
“Seriously. I might become an addict if you’d consider selling them by the dozen.” He said, feeding Stella a blueberry. “They’re perfect for the whole family.”
“Shit!” Draco said, frowning at the mirror. His reflection frowned back at him. He could never get that self-deprecating tone of Potter’s quite right.
A little bit of truth, enough to make it believable, and enough for Potter to be able to build off of it. Plausible. Draco didn’t like lying to his mother, but it wasn’t really a lie in most ways. No, he wasn’t dating Potter, but with a few well-placed comments and a flick of the wrist he could be.
Draco walked over, and Harry tried not to count it as a success yet. He leaned over Harry so he could smell the citrusy clean scent of his hair. He pointed to the orange jar.
No. Harry left him, too. And it wasn’t Draco’s job to go after him. He murmured apologies to his inner Pansy Parkinson and laid out on his couch to take a nap, if he could. If he couldn’t, well, trying to fall asleep would be a good way to waste several hours.
Somebody tipped off the papers that Potter was vacationing in the Caribbean, and then there was review after review of Jamaican and Bahamian resorts. After the journalists wandered about in the Caribbean for a bit, they started printing absolute rubbish.
Draco put two fingers into the salves and spread them on Harry’s injured body parts. It was not fun. The salve was cold. But Draco’s fingers were shaking and his ears were red again, so Harry managed not to flinch or squirm.
Draco pet the larger of the sheep. It nuzzled into his hand. He heard a crunch and turned to see the other sheep eating out of his packed lunch.
“It was nothing much, really. I messed up there in the middle, and like I told you I haven’t really practiced in the past few years. Or really since I learned that piece. You see, my old instructor had to go away during fifth year and we never really replaced him…” He continued rambling and making excuses for his supposedly less-than-acceptable playing as he put the piano back in order, sliding the fallboard back into place and closing the lid.
“Who?” Harry asked, walking into their small kitchen. It was Wednesday lunch, and he was right on time. The Mums (he called them privately) were usually discussing someone or other they had run into or gotten a call from or offended recently.
“Call me Hermione,” she said, “And if you’re going to apologize, please do it in writing so I can frame it. Owl me at, well, tell the owl to go to my office. I don’t have time for apologies today. You’re trying to stop the re-inspection?”
Each dish sent a thrill through his heavy mind. Toujours Pur. Fuck that, he thought. This teacup? Always broken. And he flung it against the wall, its saucer close behind. His muscles burned after ten or fifteen, but God, it was more alive than Harry had felt in months.
Draco bit his lip and stayed crouched. Maybe if he looked into the ground intensely enough, it would swallow him whole. This wasn’t how the meeting was supposed to happen.
Potter looked back and forth like Draco was crazy for questioning. “Yes, friends. You know, you did something for me, I did something in return. And so on. I’d rather stop keeping track of favors,”
It had probably been trained out of him when he was young. Harry amused himself for several moments imagining Narcissa Malfoy telling a platinum-haired toddler that ‘pure-blooded gentlemen do not use the shitter, they instead banish it from their bowels before it has the chance to breach the surface.’
“Fortunately, yes. I think it would be rather rude to have stolen someone else’s artwork and then hung it up in my home,” She had an urban Irish accent. “What are you planning on doing with the shop?”
He opened the aforementioned door, then wiped his hand on his jeans as some of the peeling paint stuck to his fingers. Really, Potter ought to think to redecorate sometime. The only ‘interior design’ this place boasted was an excessive amount of houseplants.
So he ignored the scientific studies he had read and relied on personal experience: after something stressful happens, you can’t go on and do anything important. Also, Draco didn’t quite know why, but he didn’t want Potter’s only impression of his home being that he tried to help out and got kidnapped by a random witch, then getting his wand stolen and stomping out.
Harry had memorized the way Malfoy looked up after completing an entry, excited yet hesitant, waiting for Harry’s approval. The ever-burning passion in his eyes each time made Harry feel a little warmer, from the top of his head down to his numb toes. Not with lust or any sort of minor, intermittent desire, but with an aching sort of fondness. Harry could feel that kind of light fondness begin to consume him from the bottom up.
He frowned, water pouring down his back. The dog had been nice. Can’t fault her for being attached to Potter. If being overly attached to Potter was a sin, the vast majority of the wizarding world would be rotting in hell.
Draco just about jumped out of his skin. “Ten-ish?! Mother is expecting us at eleven!” He struggled with the ground and the brick wall behind him again. Potter looked at him again, with an amused but not at all pitying look Draco wasn’t familiar with and didn’t like all that much. See, Potter’s eyes squinted in the squinty sort of way his eyes did after laughing at a joke, and the corner of mouth toyed with the rest of his face, threatening to pull it into a smile. And Draco definitely didn’t like the way Potter wrapped his arms around him and hoisted him into the air. It was simply atrocious, the way Potter’s warm body made him act like a cat dozing in a sunbeam.
“I see you’re adopting strays again,” He said, handing Campbell two mouthwatering loaves, each wrapped in a paper bag.
At the same time Pansy let out a forced laugh. “The problem is they can blame us. Ugly, inbred purebloods who’ve been shitting on everybody else for centuries,”
The door opened gently then slammed closed. Someone was suspended in midair for just a moment then forced to the floor. They stood, breathing heavily, and Harry realized it was Malfoy.
He apparated straight into the kitchen of his flat. A pair of large blue eyes greeted him barely centimeters from his own.
And so Harry cleaned his vegetables, watered his plants, made his dinner, talked to his dog. It was nice. It was simple. It was predictable. And he liked it. Harry Potter liked being the resident old man gardener, despite that he was only twenty. He was an old man at heart, goddamnit.
He read aloud more fluently than he spoke normally. Each word led smoothly into the next. Maybe it had something to do with the way Malfoy’s face seemed to light up with excitement at the end of each sentence, or the way his eyes glanced up at Harry every now and then to be sure he was paying attention (which of course he was, because how could he not?).
This chapter was entirely Harry omg i'm spoiling y'all. also obvious: i speed wrote this chapter holy crap you guys. i've been publishing as soon as i write them and wow. i just had to crank this one out for y'all. the next update should be before december if i'm being optimistic. but, feel free to bother me if it takes me more than a month to update
He didn’t know why he’d added the ‘xoxo.’ On second thought, it was definitely the delusional fancy of a starving man.
Campbell brought out three plates of pasta with red sauce and set them on the table. “Draco, I’m going to be very frank with you,”
“This one’s from 1613. Mine husband and I hast been most worried about our son, young Felix. He plays exclusively in what can only be described as the most dangerous corners of the Manor, but after my lord and I discussed this over the morning meal…”
All the mugwumps were gathered now. Mother had taken a seat at a bench only a couple rows behind them, auror squadron back and seated at her left, right, front, and back.
“Merlin-bloody-fuck,” Malfoy mumbled. His hands stumbled to hide his book somewhere deep beneath the sofa cushions. Harry wondered briefly what sort of book it was, if Malfoy had been so ashamed of it. Some sort of cheap, awful romance written for middle aged single witches, probably. Malfoy’s eyes opened and closed like each movement was a favor. “What was that for?”
He wasn’t sure what strange masochistic impulse compelled him to tag ‘princess’ onto the end of that line, but it was doing interesting things to Malfoy’s coloring. First, he had gone a little pale, then an angry flush spread across his nose and neck. Then he dove into some magazine he had conjured from who-knows-where.
The statement was made in a deep caricature of a voice. Harry nearly laughed when he realized it was meant to be him.
“I did,” Malfoy said, and the way he was looking at the piano, eyes half-closed, lips parted, made Harry feel a bit jealous but also like he was intruding on something private.
Harry sat in the overstuffed armchair from the Gryffindor common room, Stella at his feet, and unshrunk the book he had stolen that morning.
Potter swung the door open, took one look at him, then closed the door in his face. Draco sighed and took a seat on the steps. He sipped his coffee. Potter would have to come out and see him sometime.
It was a pompous, cultured room, and yet Draco had nothing but good memories in it. Sure, he had cried when unable to master a solo from Tchaikovsky’s No. 1 in Bb minor, but the thrill of performing it years later for his mother’s friends overshadowed it.
Soup would take what, twenty minutes at most? Harry would be able to sate Malfoy’s strange supper urge and his own hunger in no time.
“In the bookshop,” Harry answered. He stood in the entryway for a few moments, unsure of what to do next. He gave a little wave to Campbell and then descended the stairs, leaving Malfoy to close the door. Hermione was waiting for them at the bottom.
Then back to the sun parlor. Draco collapsed on the sofa, but Narcissa remained standing. If Potter wasn’t in any of the rooms, where could he be? Lucius was in control of the Manor’s magic, sure, but he didn’t possess enough ill intent to banish Potter from the grounds. And there was no chance Potter was in the east wing.
Weasley lifted a ginger eyebrow. Or at least, it was assumed it was ginger. The green of the floo made it hard to tell.
peepee. poopoo. are nosebleeds a symptom of corona? penis. knitting. whose line is it anyway reruns. michaelangelo.
Harry nodded and smiled, listening to her rant about the importance of competing opinions in democracy. Then he turned back to remove the dough and start the pizza.
Draco inched his thigh back to where it could touch Potter’s. And he tried to ignore the spike of energy that ran through his body at the moment of contact.
“Hullo, Harry,” Lydia said, sounding simultaneously surprised and unsurprised (a talent of hers). “Want a cuppa?”
He whisked on the robes and wished Potter had had the providence to provide him with a mirror. Maybe then he could straighten out the mess he was sure his hair was.
The baker was an older gentleman by the name of Victor. His mouth twitched as the couple approached until finally it broke into a blatant smile, white teeth shining against dark skin.
He watched his hands grasp at the doorknob and turn it open. He followed his feet down the hallway, felt the warmth of the morning sun but didn’t acknowledge it, eased the door to the music room open.
this was a super fun chapter to write!! thanks for sticking with this. keep in mind this is a wip, but i'll try not to be so obnoxious about the next installment. junior year is wildin.
“Something like that.” Draco smiled weakly, then was struck with the sudden urge to open up to these women. “There’s a problem with my furniture. They said it should arrive within the week, but I'm rather doubtful that will occur. Yesterday I mostly spent calling whoever I could think in order to get it shipped,”
Elise developed a mischievous glint in her eye. “You hear that, Draco? You’re staying until they get you your bed,”
“I’d actually love to. I’m a freelanced law consultant and defendant, and if you’d be willing to pay me I’ll do what I can to bring the case to Wizengamot. I do have to warn you, they aren’t my biggest fans after the house elf case I brought last year. But I do believe they are planning to use your property to pay for their salaries rather than any improvement to public properties. That’s immoral,”
He decided to air his last remaining grievances by drafting another letter to Mr. Orion N Ager. This one insinuated that Draco had a qualified lawyer on hand at all times. After the letter was on its way, he began packing a change of clothes and the like in a backpack. Even though Campbell and Elise had royally put a damper on Abford, he couldn’t disappoint them by sleeping in his own flat.
“...And then I kissed him but then I ran away and now I feel really bad but I don’t know how to tell him that because he’s probably really angry with me and–”
Harry took the pizza out of the oven. It had been done about twenty minutes ago, but the heating and cooling charms on his oven had made sure it was cooked perfectly (the exact configuration of those charms were a secret he’d only publish if he was very low on cash). He cast a stasis charm.
Harry shoved another muffin into his mouth. “These are really great, Victor.” he said through the crumbs. A few fell onto the book he had taken with him. He wiped them off, careful not to leave any residue on the cover.
“I’ve only just had the chance. If I’d known little bookstores got you this worked up I’d have told Ron too,” This remark fell on deaf ears as Hermione was already engrossed in whatever shelving system (or lack thereof) Elise had set up. “I’ll just go find Malfoy myself, yeah?”
A regular storm of vegetables rained down on the pizza, making Hermione jump back in surprise. Some of the sauce puddle splashed onto her shirt. She removed it magically, frowning.
Harry was beginning to hate French. Not the people, just hearing it spoken. And not just anyone speaking it, specifically a point blond little tit. Here Harry was, trying to listen to something he’s not supposed to know, and Malfoy and his mum are discussing it in bloody French!
“Don’t be ridiculous, grandfather. Everyone’s invited every year. Even Arnie was invited before he died,”
Malfoy grabbed his hand. “Just pretend you like me, Potter, and it’ll be fine. I don’t like this any more than you do.”
The manor was just as he remembered it: the east wing in disrepair and the west wing in perfect condition. The long drive was lined with dark pink carnations and the small flock of peacocks roamed the front lawn.
He shook himself out of his indecisive misery. There was work to be done. He had to remember the world’s gears still turned even when Draco wanted them to stop or go in reverse.
Draco pulled a face, but he felt his ears getting hot. Damn inbreeding, giving him these weaknesses. “Trust me, Blaise, seducing Potter is the last thing on my list. I’d rather seduce Albus Dumbledore,”
The average person walked five kilometres per hour. That meant he should be at Potters house in approximately 24 minutes.
“Come to think of it,” Elise said, handing him a bag of mixed vegetables she had bought for him. “You remind me more and more of the other boy we fixed up,”
Draco gave him a small smile as he took the other side of the folder. Harry looked up, into Draco’s eyes, giving him a shining smile. Draco looked down, the flush from finishing the piece still present. His breathing hitched and Draco’s lips relaxed and parted. Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was leaning in or if he was, but the darkening look in Draco’s eyes told him all he needed to know.
He opened another door. A dusty little library. Lucius didn’t like dust. He liked cleanliness, especially if he hadn’t been the one to do the cleaning.
Draco narrowed his eyes, nodded, frowned. “I trust we all know about the reparations decisions? Yes?”
“No,” she said. Harry heard her get up out of the chair and start wandering around the small kitchen. “Is it hard?”
“I apparated… our friend… to London, alley hear where I told him I would go. But my problem,” He smiled without humor, “Was to give him an actual Wizarding neighborhood. So I pop in the alley, and he makes such a commotion. He says, ‘Oh, thank you, sir, for taking me here! I shall check around and report to you if I find Mr. Malfoy!’ And I tell him NO, that won’t be necessary, I’ll just look for it in the
“Yes, going to round up the Squoggles then buzz away. Don’t think you’re in a position to take guests.” She gave him a wry smile.
He felt something grab at his ankle. Draco shot a slow-motion jinx at whatever it was and ran down the hall to the hippogriff door.
A tallish man about thirty-five or forty with an extravagant ponytail of curly black hair chose that moment to burst into the room, businesslike, and unwittingly silencing a whole can of worms Harry hadn’t particularly wanted to open.
“Anyway, weather report, there’s some sheep that keep watching me from across the garden. It’s a pair of them, the larger one kind of looks like he’d rather be anywhere else and the smaller one is always butting its head into the larger one to make it move. But the larger one always moves. It’s weird. Maybe I should give them names. I’ll sleep on it.”
The second article, though. It had images. Muggle images, but images nonetheless. Potter, arm around a blond muggle man. Potter, hugging the waist of another muggle, taller than him this time, still blond. Potter, dancing in a muggle club. A gay muggle club. Potter, kissing a muggle woman. A man stood nearby, looking jealous.
The man had let himself get distracted by his lover (or ex-lover) again with rudimentary comparisons, but Draco found it strangely endearing. Of course, it reminded him of Potter, and Potter reminded him of kissing Potter, and kissing Potter reminded him of how fucked up kissing Potter was.
“I say it with utmost respect. I love lesbians. They’re very good friends for your children. I never had to worry about my son getting one pregnant,”
“Wizengamot ruled about a month ago that all past Death Eater places of residence need to be re-inspected for lingering Dark influence, whatever that means,”
A rise of emotion grew in Draco. He wanted the man from the radio to seek reparations with his friends, to get back to the life he should be living.
“‘Potter, I thought you’d never acknowledge it! I really did think all that stalking was for naught. But how should I know my schoolboy crush was finally requited? I’m so glad you decided to listen to reason,”
Draco needed to explain why he ran out like that. Of course, the radio man’s problem and his weren’t that similar, the radio man hadn’t even said what he and Posh Spice had done that had messed up their relationship so much. And from what the radio man had said, it sounded like they had always stood on such firm ground with each other, being enemies then allies. That’s not what he’d felt about Harry at all. He’d never been absolutely sure about where he and Harry stood, only that he didn’t want it to go backwards.
2. If two people have the same patronus, it can be due to either coincidence or an all-consuming obsession with the other.
Of Potter’s friends and associates from Hogwarts, only Luna Lovegood had remained untouched. Draco had made a list.
He sat down on the sofa and began to read. Potter would have to wake up eventually, wouldn't he? In the meantime, Draco could do something productive for once.
The walk to Potter’s house was, if nothing else, wet. It had started to rain. At least this way, Draco thought, Potter would have no choice but to invite him in. What kind of cruel, unfeeling individual would throw a person out in the rain?
It was common knowledge that Voldemort used Malfoy Manor as his headquarters. And since Skeeter had published that ‘biography’ on Harry Potter, the wide Wizarding World knew Granger had been tortured there.
Harry nodded distractedly. “Of course, Mrs. Malfoy. I’m doing everything I can. Thank you for your concern.” He went to shake her hand, but she held it out elegantly. Harry compromised by squeezing it lightly.
He could feel Pansy’s incredulous expression at the back of his head. He didn’t give it any credence.
Ask him tomorrow and Harry wouldn’t have the faintest idea what Malfoy had been talking on about for those hours, but he could tell about the way Malfoy’s throat bobbed when he swallowed for dramatic effect, or the precise timbers of the roughness in his voice when he needed a drink of water, or the little movements he made with his eyebrows to express the new writer’s emotion.
Campbell answered. “Go down the road about two kilos and his is the one with all the plants. If you just wanted to have a chat, then he’ll be around next Wednesday for lunch or maybe sooner,”
Harry took one last look at Malfoy, his perfect body so still in the night, then he turned over and closed his eyes. He’d like to spend more nights like that, Harry thought. More nights listening to Draco talk.
Had he grown? Maybe Potter had taken up a penchant for outdoorsy work. Draco looked at his own pale, skinny arms in the mirror. Maybe Potter had a beard. Maybe it would look good on him, be neatly groomed. Or maybe, Draco reminded himself, Potter has the nasty sort of moustache that catches little bits of food in it. Potter is probably absurdly out of shape, can barely move from the couch. Or better yet, disturbingly skinny. Skeletal, matter of fact. He was definitely wearing the same broken wire-framed glasses from first year. Definitely. And Potter has halitosis, foot fungus, and all sorts of infections. Draco would be doing him a favor by showing up to his door.
Aurors, Draco decided, could go piss on Merlin’s wand. All of them. Collectively. Make it a circle piss.
“That wasn’t a dig at your mother, just at you. Percival and Charles have wonderful manners,” Draco let the hint of a smug smile creep onto his face. “And I’m not in the mood for talking politics, so if this isn’t a social call I’ll be very disappointed. How is your fiancee?”
provided by Junior Auror Weasley and his compassionate team of aurors. The Relocation Initiative for Former Supporters (REFS) approached him a month ago with two options: suck its cock or humiliate himself further, and Draco had never enjoyed being humiliated. Turns out, sucking its cock had given him a cushy little flat in Merlin-knows-where Scotland that smelled like piss. Supposedly it would be better than dealing with gossip magazines back at the Manor.
There wasn’t a toothbrush at the sink, Harry noticed. Did Malfoy not brush his teeth? He ran a finger along the countertop, and the finest layer of dust came with it. Did Malfoy not shit?
And didn’t want to watch Narcissa perform cleaning charms. Not just because of the dose of fear he’d receive when she inevitably noticed him and turned, her eyes boring into him, just like Malfoy’s but steelier, less open.
Luna stood, and Draco and Potter followed her. They reached the apparition room in an awkward silence as Draco was contemplating what he’d done.
“No, it’s fine, I think. I mean, I’m not an expert on lesbians or anything, but I’m almost completely sure he’s right about them not having sex with men,”
“The person who wrote the article, in case you didn’t know, is Orion N Ager. He lives in Chelsea and his residence isn’t at all warded against owls from strangers. In case you were wondering,”
Also fun tidbits i've hidden: the pink frilly dress Luna is wearing is based off of Villanelle's from season 2, episode 1 of Killing Eve, and the quote Harry uses is from Tweflth Night (but I'm not telling the original context!). And of course, there are others, but those are my faves.
, we heard if you look in the mirror, spin around, and say “Scarhead, scarhead, scarhead,” he’ll appear!
Harry’s hair was going to be awful when it dried. In the past year or so, he had learned about the magic of conditioner, and now his hair had turned from black mass of frizz to black mass of curls, which was a marked improvement.
“You may try them on, if you are sure. But I don’t think you should be one to wear another man’s castoffs, Mr. Potter.”
While Harry moved the piano, Malfoy rifled through several folders on a shelf for the piece he wanted. He flipped through the one he chose, then moved to the end of the piano to lift the lid. He lifted it only a few inches, probably because the music room wasn’t exactly large. Then he sat at the bench, right in front of Harry. He’d angled the piano so that Malfoy was sitting in profile from Harry’s perspective.
Malfoy slowed his playing, his lithe fingers making elegant pictures above the keyboard. The farther above the keyboard, the more relaxed they became. Then they would plunge down onto the white and black keys, so strong and yet able to create the subtle melody.
Thank Merlin he’d chosen to fake-date someone who could lie nearly as well as he could. His mother was no fool; not anyone would be able to pass her test. Except, Draco thought, this wasn’t much of a test, since Narcissa had more or less ordered him to get Harry Potter’s support.
He snatched mushrooms and asparagus out of the air, then set some knives up to chopping them. Hermione bustled over with the sauce and cheese.  He handed her a spoon. She still looked helpless.
Draco woke with a start, unsure of where he was. A woman, nude from the waist up, stared aloofly from the print on the wall. Music blared from somewhere in the flat. The song was familiar, but he couldn’t place it yet. The clock declared it was 7:30 am. If that was true, then he had slept more in one night than he had the several days.
“Under my right hand, I think,” he said. He couldn’t be sure because the immobilization charm dulled his sense of touch, but there was clearly an irregularity in the texture below him.
“You know, Harry,” George said, setting down his teacup. “I’ve been meaning to have you take a look at my garden. It’s no rival to yours, by any means, but neither Lydia nor I seem to be much for routine maintenance and I’d hate the tomato plants to feel neglected.”
Hermione would visit in the evenings and they’d sort through lists of magical people and putting them into categories based on who would be best suited (and most willing) to be the master of the Manor.
Oops. He was rambling. He looked at the clock. 10:11. He would allow himself exactly one minute of rambling.
They laughed. It was nice, like this. Talking like normal people, about normal things. Pansy had been Draco’s emotional support since, well, forever. Even a year ago their conversations (when they had them) were all angry or sad. Now some sense of normalcy had fallen back into place, an occurrence Draco was continually grateful for.
“Lucius.” Draco repeated. “While Lucius is still…” He left the statement open, not wanting to say ‘dead’ but not wanting to not say it either. “Where is he, anyway?”
The last time Harry had seen Malfoy (before this week, of course) was at the trial. If he was skinny now, Malfoy had been emaciated before. There had been dark circles around his eyes and Harry could still recall the dead, haunted look in them. Sometimes, if Harry was being honest, those eyes woke him up in a cold sweat nearly once a month.
It probably didn’t matter because he probably still hadn’t gotten groceries yet. Harry should go check on him, maybe bring him a few of his old canned vegetables.
“Draco, breathe,” Elise said, hand on his arm and a worried look in her eye. “Our Harry’s not a delicate flower. He’s been through a lot, I’ve gathered,”
“I sold you the place,” He said, looking like he was making a real effort to keep from rolling his eyes.
Someone was shaking Draco. Not vigorously, not aggressively. It was more like… a gentle rocking motion.
“Elise hasn’t sent out the invitations this year, yet. The one from last year is still on the fridge,” Lydia said, nodding to card with a painted rooster on the front. She picked it off and handed it to Harry. “What do you think the theme will be? She always leaves hints in last year’s messages,”
Potter had just made Draco a soup, without poisoning it. Though he supposed it was only payback. Draco had made Potter a coffee. But before that, Potter had both gotten rid of a rather annoying wizard
Draco laughed at the headline, but maybe there was something to it. First, muggle photographs. Potter was likely to ward against wizarding cameras, but if he was truly dating exclusively muggles, warding against muggle cameras would be inconvenient at best. Draco didn’t know a lot about muggles, but he did know they seemed very attached to their cameras. Second, the nature of the article gave its truth away. If there was only one article, the Harry Potter Cleanup Squad (aka Granger and Luna) was able to hush up the news before it reached major papers. If there was news to hush up, the news must be true. Harry Potter was at least a little bent, and he was very into blondes.
Harry then bid Victor good day and left, Stella happily trotting behind him. It was a little difficult, now that he thought of it, to remember an instance where Stella didn’t trot happily, excepting those in which she galloped happily. She wasn’t a mopey sort of dog, for sure.
He stood up from the flimsy card table in his living room. “It’s not like you have anything to do at your home,”
“You have to take it out somewhere, don’t you? Might as well take it out on someone who can take it,”
Elise was talking about her latest painting: a “flashback to the Art Nouveau movement mashed with Symbolistic techniques from the same era.” Harry didn’t know exactly what that meant, but he had practice nodding along to complicated theories. After all, Hermione could be the same way.
Afternoon came, and Harry was tempted to ask Draco to read aloud again, like he had yesterday, but something about the tension in Draco’s shoulders and the intensity of his eyes stopped him.
She nodded, then turned to lead them down the hall, most likely to the sun parlor. Potter followed with little coaxing, thankfully.
“I know, it wasn’t my best broadcast. I just had to get some things out there, you know? Of course you do. You’re very wise.”
It was morning and Harry was gardening. As per usual. His little pear tree was doing quite well, and he was nearly ready to remove most of the stabilising charms around it. It was only a year-old sapling, so there wouldn’t be any fruit for the next few years. But Harry still carefully checked each blossom to make sure there weren’t any parasites or otherwise unwanted organisms.
“So about these Squoggles, I’m going to have to use a couple of charms and then flush them out with a potion…”
“No! Thank you. No, I’ll survive. You’re probably right,” He said, ending the call. Even if Harry Potter was really living out in Abford, which he strongly suspected was the case, it would be disrespectful to out his location to the rest of the wizarding world. Draco already owed him enough, honestly. As for the supposed Caribbean island, Draco had a gut feeling that was a ruse. Potter, despite his many, many, many flaws, had a particular dislike for paparazzi of any sort and would no doubt send them on a wild goose chase as far away as possible. Intentionally misleading his supposed best friend, however, would be a new sort of sin for Potter.
Pansy passed him the bottle with a roll of her eyes and a huff. He took a rather large swig. Draco was beginning to get worried.
But it was just an honest observation, really. If Malfoy didn’t want to be perceived as a ponce, then why would he look so poncey?
“Believe me, I know fact from fiction. Like when you said I’m the most beautiful? Fact,” Potter said, but trailed off as he entered the sun parlor.
He went back into the kitchen and made another cup of coffee. Draco’s hands were shaking. Really, all this just because of a made-up scenario? Potter was probably fine. Lucius had absolutely nothing to do with it. Still, he couldn’t shake this feeling…
Cleaning with magic was simple, but adding the proper appliances was another matter. It would be difficult charm-work to weave in spells that would allow his brewing to harness magical energy, but in such a way that the muggles would never think something was amiss.
Harry took a seat on Campbell and Elise’s sofa, ready to digest their latest gossip. Hardly any of it was more than speculation, but Harry liked the rhythm. Harry liked predictability.
“C’mon, ‘Mione, it’s pizza, not rocket science. Let’s put her in the oven and go find the pointy ponce,”
“You won’t be able to banish the magic until Lucius dies. Which,” she added, seeing Draco’s expression, “will likely not be in the next month or two.”
“They will not find her,” Lucius said, and it sounded like a command. “Go hide yourself, son. I do not care to be ashamed today.”
The kitchen was as decidedly smart as the front room, painted a cheery yellow. Lydia closed the door and set a teapot on the stove.
The ringing in his ears was out in full force. He searched for something, some variation in the cramped darkness surrounding him, but nothing was there. He knows nothing was there, and yet he can’t stop his eyes from frantically scanning the cabinet. He can’t stop his limbs from trying to shake despite the force surrounding them. This isn’t real, this can’t be happening, he thought. How absurd that Harry should be in Malfoy’s house, imprisoned by something Malfoy doesn’t seem in charge of and is controlling Malfoy as well. Harry felt himself spacing out, losing touch with reality.
What had Malfoy said earlier? Something about not being able to get medicine because of the Ministry watching? Harry could get medicine. He knew people with medicine. Luna would definitely help, no questions asked. Or at least, no answers to the questions told.
He could smell the bakery from across the street, and as he walked in, his mouth watered at the overwhelming scent of bread, in solid, liquid, and gaseous forms.
Draco forced a laugh. “No, it was my aunt’s. She sent it through the post and it seems to have gotten a little shaken,”
Malfoy stepped through first, then Hermione. As she passed, he leaned over to her ear. “I wasn’t drooling!” he whispered.
She beckoned in Harry’s direction, and he looked behind him for the other person she was probably actually looking at. But Malfoy nudged him rather hard in the ribs.
The next chapter may take a little while as well, but I'll try to get it done as soon as school and conditioning and stuff allow!
“I’m not getting in bed with you. Also, don’t rummage around like that. You’ll hurt yourself,” He said, looking over. “I’ll just read to you, does that work, your highness?”
Which could be a bit of an issue, since the Manor’s rooms were always appearing and disappearing based on use and need. A book on the house’s magic had been required reading by his pre-first-year summer tutor.
They worked through the afternoon like that as well, Draco silently pouring through papers, Harry silently watching him, and Narcissa silently embroidering and observing.
Then Draco retreated to a corner of the room to sort through more papers in silence. Narcissa watched him with an unreadable expression. Then she turned her gaze to Harry, who refused to cower or blush. That was a lie. He didn’t cower, but he could feel the hot blush rising out of his chest and spreading across his neck and cheeks.
i got told i have big chaotic neutral energy the other day, and i legit cannot stop thinking about it.
Just as he’d predicted, Lucius sat behind the desk looking out at the grounds. He looked so out of place, his expression like a parent forced to clean out a nursery. It was so sad, and so empty.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. He raised his wrists above the keyboard, letting tension gather in his fingers. Then he let them fall, a succession of dark chords playing. As soon as one began to ring, the next one began.
“Of course. Mighty aloof the one time I saw him. Campbell and Elise brought him around.” He paused and stopped playing with the key on his cash register. “He didn’t…?”
To the innocent passerby, Draco must have looked like a serial killer. Or a very intense scrapbooker. Pages from magazines covered the empty wall across from the card table and his drawing of Mr. Ager (the asshole). They ordered chronologically from left to right. Draco was highlighting an article from a year and a half ago, several months before Potter disparaged the public of his presence. He had noticed a trend: the articles became more speculation-based instead of interview-based.
He opened the door and Hermione gasped. “How come you didn’t tell me about this sooner?” she demanded, taking in the ceiling-to-floor shelving and quirky decor.
A red brick house in the north held itself blissfully apart from the rest of town, and Harry’s feet were leading him right to it. The cheerily painted sign at the front read “George’s Electronic Reparations.” Harry stepped up to the door and gave it a few gentle knocks.
Draco waved his hand dismissively. “He’s rather senile, as of late. Most likely, he won’t even come down from his rooms. And if he does, we can just let Mother handle it,”
A dragon near his knee was flitting around rather energetically, much to the dismay of the dragon on the edge of the cushion.
Harry stood up, and brushing some dirt off his jeans, headed into the house. It was nearly lunchtime, wasn’t it? He glanced at the clock. 10:30. Close enough. The basil plant on the kitchen sink was looking fresh today. Malfoy would like a primavera pizza. It sounds posh, but is actually just the thing normal people order at a fancy pizza place.
I hope your time in my program has been most educational. I think you should like this work very much, if you haven’t read it already. I have to say, you’ve been my favorite to teach, and by far the most successful. I wouldn’t be surprised if you end up living in a muggle neighborhood for some time. Don’t laugh, I have faith in you. Consider this a graduation gift.
“In case you haven’t noticed, there’s not a supermarket around here. Luckily, most of us shopkeepers have discounts for the regulars who just want to eat instead of buy novelty goods,” Elise said.
Then a tannish-colored knit shirt. It had none of the pomp of the other dress shirts he had tried on that day, and he appreciated it. Nothing to get caught in.
He thought about lifting the fallboard, what it would be like to press his fingers down on the keys, hear the sharpness of a note chosen at random and played without musicality. There wouldn’t have to be an art to it; only crude mechanics. Raise his arm, slide the sheet of wood into the piano, move his arm back, let it fall on the black or white ivory.
“The point is that I should go after him.” Draco would say, sighing, resigned, and yet he would feel the determination coursing through his veins. He’d be so scared it would turn into adrenaline or something and yeah, it would probably be a shitshow, Draco ending up frozen and mumbling, Harry looking torn between crying and hexing his bollocks off. But he’d have to try.
She was shut up, at this point, by a throw pillow Draco had thrown at her face. “I was not that awful,” he said.
Harry felt a bit foolish. Here he had been, smelling rats and forming conspiracies when all the Mums had been doing was helping their new stray find a book. And knowing his dislike for Malfoy, they hadn’t wanted to upset him. He was about to reel in the extendable ears when something Campbell said piqued his notice:
Seduction it was not. But it was the start of something, Draco was sure. One didn’t often humiliate themselves in the shower without it turning into
Malfoy had decided on a dark blue jumper and was holding it up in front of the mirror. The color matched his skin well and highlighted the shine of his hair. Hair which, Harry noticed with a bit of a smile, was currently sticking up in several different directions. It was a far cry from the stiff, gelled style he had worn it in when they were younger. Malfoy ran a hand through it, scattering the dust particles in the light. He looked good, Harry realized. Malfoy hadn’t done too badly for himself these past three years.
Something was wrong. Harry felt premature tears well in his eyes as he rushed down to Kreacher’s den.
Careful not to breathe too sharply, he inched out of the room before Malfoy could confirm his existence.
“Go on, then,” Harry said. Whatever sort of relationship Malfoy had with that piano was none of his business, honestly. “Play chopsticks or something,”
Draco looked at them quizzically. “And just who is this other boy? You’ve mentioned him several times now,”
It was interesting, Harry noted. As Malfoy walked toward his mother, he picked little bits of dust off his jumper and smoothed out invisible wrinkles. Maybe it was his imagination, but Malfoy even seemed to grow more vibrant as he got closer to his mother. The light blue of his jumper became bluer and bounced off his pale skin even more, which suddenly seemed more like ivory and less like ice. His black jeans (Harry still couldn’t get over the fact that Malfoy wore jeans) grew blacker and his posture straighter, and the click-clack of his fancy little shoes grew crisper.
“Goodbye, Draco,” she said, looking directly into her son’s eyes. “The next time you come here, we will have found what we’ve been searching for. I have faith that the Manor will be ours for good and whatever you’ve stirred up in Mr. Potter will have settled to a companionable level.”
He marched up the stairs, each step making his heart beat a little faster. Malfoy was up there, probably doing something cool and interesting and intellectual and posh like reading a book in French or doing tests on different brewing methods for coffee.
...but we did something we couldn’t take back, and then he ran away from me. This is Posh Spice. Turn of events, I know. My old enemy turning up and becoming one of my favorite people. He’s just captivating, I suppose. You see, he’s got this air about him, like he couldn’t care less about you, but it slips aside so often that you can see the raw passion he has for so many things. He laughed. It’s really attractive. There’s this light in his eyes and this quirk in his lips...
...This whole thing has gotten me rather fucked up, I think. Clearly, we’re both in the wrong and just playing chicken about who’s the wrong-est. Or at least that’s what he thinks. I don’t see a way I could have been in the wrong, I mean, you should have seen the way he was looking at me through that whole day. No, that whole week before it happened. It was like I was a bowl of squash soup and he’d been out all day shoveling autumn leaves all day. It’s the same way Stella looks at green beans, honestly. But then he’d look away…
Draco frowned. “Not much time. Alright, what we need now is a list of every magical person you know who’d be willing to settle for a fixer-upper,”
Draco threw another pillow at his face. It did not connect. Matter of fact, it came rushing right back towards him. He tried to deflect it, but it ended up spiraling off his arm and into the grand piano.
Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil had been spotted circling Potter, and it was rumored twice they were involved in some sort of threesome scheme.
Draco stood just in front of the door, unsure what to do with his hands or how to make his presence known.
Harry ducked into the alley and apparated directly into his house. He summoned an old pair of extendable ears and apparated back. “Miss me, dog?”
For the next couple hours Draco amused himself with drafting the perfect response. Mr Ager had simply used a return owl, so there was no worry about being recognized via post. Merlin knows Draco’s had enough trouble for a lifetime.
“Ah, yes. I’ll stop by tomorrow while Aina’s minding the shop. Busy moving into the flat yesterday?”
He scrambled for paper, penning a note to Hermione. And then it was off, the postal service’s owl flying as fast as its wings could take it (since Draco had fed it a little bit of his dropped toast).
His mother sighed. “And what will you have me do, then? If we call anyone, we’ll get the Manor taken immediately.”
“Shit, I forgot,” Malfoy said. “Where are they? Here, I’ll put them on you,” He started searching around the bed with his hands.
Harry really, really wanted to be an embarrassment. Honest, he did. But Narcissa made eye contact with him, cool grey eyes full of surprise, at first. Then she glanced over at Malfoy, then back to Harry. She softened a bit, gave him a bit of a smile. And Harry was so taken aback by the bit of a smile that was really just a slightly softer neutral expression that he forgot about being an embarrassment.
He finished up the pasta. Its taste wasn’t as comforting as before. Merlin, what had he been thinking, leaving Harry…
“Smelling salt,” she said, not answering the first and more important question. Harry felt a stab of annoyance. She ran the bottle under his nose again, but Malfoy didn’t react. Luna frowned, swiped it under a third time. “Must be in REM,” she muttered. Then, raising her wand, she levitated a few salt crystals out of the bottle and shot them into his nose.
I will not hesitate to rewrite this chapter and details from several others and adjust the plot of my story accordingly. That being said, I did not include immersive graphic descriptions of anything.
He set up a temporary warding charm to let him know when they came back upstairs. He felt a little guilty doing it, but honestly, if he didn’t know who was staying in that room he’d probably have a conniption. At this point, snooping was just self-care.
“I did want to see you and all, but I’m actually helping Draco with the legal mess the Ministry has planted on him. I discovered something important that complicates this whole case so I flooed him, but he wasn’t in. Then I remembered you live around here and I came to ask you where he might be,”
Draco clearly hadn’t been expecting such an honest response, because it seemed to knock him a bit off-kilter.
Draco looked back at her. She caught his eye and had a bemused sort of look on her face. He turned back to Potter and he just nodded, too strucken dumb by this scene to do anything else. His gaze slid to Potter’s lips. He had those full, gorgeous kind of lips that begged to be kissed.
Harry had strained to hear the creaks of the ancient elf moping around the halls, his little mutterings about how Harry was a disgrace to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. And then Harry hadn’t been able to bear it. Damn it all, he wanted someone to tell him off. He knew he’d done wrong, why couldn’t someone up and tell him so?
As Malfoy got further away from his mother’s view, the expression on his face changed from pleasant to nearly murderous. Harry wondered if he should pull out his wand.
Draco listened to her prattle on about North American Prairie flowers for the next half hour. It certainly wasn’t the conversation he’d been expecting, but it wasn’t unwelcome either. Draco would much rather head about the healing properties of sunflowers than have to move again after a well-meaning witch hexes his bollocks off for flouncing his death eater face about.
“And it doesn’t help that he’s stupidly possessive over everything that’s mine. It’s like he’s determined to take everything I made just for me, everyone I love and pollute them with his influence! Even you, Hermione. The only reason you even came to see me was because of him. And-and Luna loves him for God-knows-why! He’s a stupid little idiot and I hate him. I swear I hate him with my whole heart,” Harry was on a roll now. He was breaking dishes again, the catharsis buzzing through his head like a drug. “I wish he could see how rude and strange and hot and cold he is from anybody’s perspective but his own! He’s a… He’s a… I don’t know. He’s a bad fucking word, that’s what he is. I don’t know which one but he’s all of them!”
In all honesty, this was probably impolite curiosity on his Mother’s part and a willingness to play up any charade for Draco’s sake. In other words, the test was more for Draco than it was for Potter: it was a test to see how good a job Draco had done at securing the support of the Savior of the Wizarding World.
“What you need,” Pansy interrupted. “Is a man. Take your mind off things. Give you something to work on,”
i tried to stop working on this until the end of the school year, i really did. But then a snow day happened...
and since it's nine days after the anniversary.... I love getting comments and kudos, each one makes my day for like three days!
Pansy took a sip of firewhisky, straight out the bottle. Draco didn’t know where it came from, but it was best not to speculate. “Do you need me to take that away from you?”
“And without the Manor, Lucius and Mother won’t have anywhere to live and our family history would be good as lost. Not to mention the grounds. Can you help me?” he finally asked.
Harry heard the door slam and Dracco’s footsteps travel down the hall, probably with a dark look on his face and determination in his eyes. Harry knew the look. Narcissa remained in the room, and Harry could imagine her standing in the center, watching the air where her son had just stood, openmouthed. Or maybe she was sitting in a sturdy and expensive chair, stern and imperial, waiting for her son to come back and apologize.
“Potter! Want a cuppa?” He asked, door wide open, ecklectric light from the flat pouring into the store. Draco nearly smiled.
Granger had a total tally of fifteen relationship speculations, despite her rather public relationship with Weasley.
Campbell sat down next to her. “And the moral of the story is that your ghost wife shouldn’t hold you down. So Draco, whoever your ghost wife or husband or wild dog is, let go of them. Do what you know will take you forwards in life.”
Third door had a fresh coat of white paint on it, and Draco swung it open, sure that this one was the bathroom. But the crisp late spring light fell on a naked back, not a toilet seat. The back in question was firmly muscled, large shoulders, sharp shoulder blades, a few stips of scar tissue running through it like imperfections in the finest marble. And the lower back was really quite nice as well, remaining deeply tanned even at the dimples just before the elastic waist of the owner’s pants.
Draco looked at his father. He looked old, much older than his nearly fifty years. Age was in Lucius’s hair, once white-blond now lacking the blond. It was in his tarnished silver eyes and the wrinkles around them. It was in his shoulders, once proud, now drawn together like magnets. His scraggly nails pushed into Draco’s arm insistently, and Draco had no choice but to grant his father soft, pitying, eye contact.
Once outside, he let out a huge breath, but he maintained the disillusionment charm. Sure enough, Malfoy stuck his head into the hall. His gaze drifted toward Harry, but slid right over him. Seemingly satisfied that he was alone, Malfoy continued to the bathroom.
Draco took a seat on the counter opposite from where Potter was preparing some sort of soup. He was holding the ingredients Potter had summoned, and every so often Potter would ask for one and Draco would provide it. It was incredibly domestic, and Draco wasn’t a fan.
Malfoy nodded. “That entry was dated from 1594. It’s the first mention of the house being able to change its rooms at will, so it’s been refining that power for over four hundred years. Do you want to hear the next important one?”
“You’re supposed to be healing,” Draco intoned. “Not making bets over how many pillows you can stuff under my unconscious body.”
Pansy was experimenting with calling everybody ‘darling.’ She felt it gave her that certain air of unattainability she liked so well. Draco felt it gave her that certain air of a matronly Victorian aristocrat. He told her as much, she stuck her tongue out at him.
“Reading?” Victor all-but exploded. “Next you’ll tell me you walked outside to breathe, or came to my bakery to eat a loaf of bread. Saints preserve my soul. Reading,” He would have rolled his eyes here, if the man’s eyes still had the agility.
“Nice flat,” she said, musical voice bouncing off the near-empty cabinetry of the kitchen. “Shame about the Squoggles, though,”
He didn’t answer. He had a reputation to maintain after all. Just because he was asking for help from Gryffindors didn’t mean he couldn’t be a bitch about it.
Draco pulled a face. “My dating pool isn’t exactly large to begin with. As far as I know, there’s only one other wizard in this little town, and it’s Potter. Do you want me to date Potter?”
“Er, well, it is a very nice suit and I do like it very much. I just don’t think I’m quite the right person for it, is all,” He said, searching Alexandre for some hint of disappointment. To his surprise, he found none, and the tailor was back flipping through his clothing rack.
They say in silence for so long, Draco started counting the seconds. He had just made it to four hundred ninety two when Lydia finally boiled over.
“Of course a big-city boy with no taste would say that,” the curmudgeonly old baker replied from behind the counter. But he flashed Harry a smile, which had to count for something.
Harry held his breath until he counted to forty-seven, then let it out with a sigh. He shifted, lifting his head up to look around.
The third letter was a detailed drawing of an arsehole. An arrow pointed to it. The arrow was labeled ‘you.’
Harry made a mental note to ask Campbell and Elise whether they had prepared anything for Malfoy in the past week. Or two, he amended, looking at the crusty onions once more. He moved onto the pantry next to it. There were three slices of bread. He opened the cabinet. It was empty. Next cabinet, also empty. Drawer, three spoons. No forks or knives.
Potter accepted the mug, if somewhat skeptically. He sat down at the card table, in Draco’s chair just like before. He set his wand in plain sight.
“Ha!” George helped himself to tea. “He was the only one who never came. Old pig headed coot. Always on about those raccoons,”
He shook his head. No, now was not the time. Potter was probably just signing autographs or had visited a Tesco to buy some grapefruit or something. Nothing to be worried about. But still, Draco’s heart beat in his ears. He took a sip of his coffee.
Draco thought. Pansy was clearly being sarcastic about ‘favorite,’ since Draco hadn’t been subscribed to any magazines since he was fifteen. And it definitely wasn’t one of the potioneering journals he used to read to feel smarter than his peers. “It couldn’t be Male Quidditch Models Monthly, could it?”
Potter muttered a few choice words and stormed back inside. If he was planning on continuing such behavior, he might wear the floorboards of his house straight out; such stomping couldn’t be sustainable.
Narcissa’s voice faded back into his consciousness. “I do warn you, though, if you break his heart, he will not hesitate to destroy you, Savior and life-debt or not. Do you understand?”
“He would be rolling in his grave or whatever they put him in. Don’t know if he ever had a funeral, poor bugger,”
Draco looked up at her ceiling. It was white, like most ceilings and had none of the unseemly speckling he sometimes saw in newly renovated flats like hers. “You said my favorite magazine?”
“The piano’s much too respectable to be caught gambling with anyone, much less reckless pretty-boy war heroes who disappear off to fuckass, Scotland, and have the daily habits and lifestyle of an eighty-five year-old retired professor,” Draco said, sniffing imperiously.
“Hello, Elise,” he said, walking over to and up the staircase, “What’ve you scrapped together today?”
“You’ll have to take me up to my flat, first,” he ordered. “I don’t intend on wearing jeans to the Manor,”
“And sometimes I try to figure him out, you know? Sometimes I think oh, yeah, let’s put whatever behind us because it does no one any good to hold onto childhood grudges, and he just doesn’t get it. And now I’m going to meet his mother tomorrow, and who knows what that’s going to be like. She still lives in the Manor, I think, but the little prick won’t tell me. He hasn’t told me anything about the whole thing other than that it’s happening. This is the shitty coldness he subject me and everyone else to!”
Harry nodded, then he scrambled to prop himself up on the downy pillows, which was difficult when his left arm was immobilized from the shoulder down and his right hand was similarly out of use. He shifted his hips and, ignoring the pain in his foot, wiggled into a sort-of-comfortable position. At least he could see more of the room, now, though.
He wasn’t coming back. Harry must have made a mistake. But God, if all mistakes were like this he’d make them over and over and over until he beat the odds and got it right.
And then when Harry didn’t expect it, he went back into the cascading pattern of notes but without the darkness and tension of before. But Harry understood, watching that back hand, that the darkness would return soon.
The Potter in the picture stiffened, then glanced at the camera. He flipped it the bird. He had dark rings under his eyes.
If you read this chapter and afterward you say hey, that little bit at the beginning was a bit unnecessary, then I will have done my job.
But her hands were already moving, waving the object Harry could now see was a small glass orange bottle under Malfoy’s nose.
“I really did value his friendship,” he started, then he stopped. “I wanted him, all of him. And I thought we would be able to just keep getting closer and closer, but we did something we couldn’t take back, and then he ran away from me,”
Pansy rolled her eyes. Blaise snorted. “Stop talking like a tosser, Draco. Just ask us for help like the scheming little fourth-year you are inside,”
“My friend Rolf is studying them. I’m just rounding them up for him, you know. He’s a Scamander. Very odd man,”
Draco turned so he was walking backwards, catching Potter off guard. He stumbled, but didn’t fall. Pity. “It’s just some old mirror, Potter. No magic involved,” he said, whirling back around.
Hermione surprised him. Her brow was furrowed, but it was in concentration. “The ministry is targeting your property, as it is the only location they listed as having potential Dark magic,”
Harry opened his eyes to a flat filled with golden morning light and a fluorescent pink cloud fluttering rather close to his head.
But Draco had been the one to lean in the first time, right? His subconscious whispered. You may be dense, but you know how to read basic social cues by now, Harry.
Same thing, Draco thought as his father walked, sure footed, cane hitting the ground with the steady rhythm of a train engine toward his bedchambers.
Harry fiddled with the transmitters on his transmitter. He didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to talk about it without knowing his place in everything. Was he the hero? Was he the scorned lover, or the unwitting mistress, or just a way to forget? He sighed. It was a quarter until ten. Stella moved to stand over his feet.
His feet carried him out the door and into the still unsatisfyingly tepid weather and across town. Campbell’s and Elise’s bookshop came into view, and passed out of it. He hadn’t even stopped. They weren’t the right people. His feet knew.
“Elise,” Draco asked at breakfast the next morning. “Where, exactly, does Harry Potter live? I should… like to meet his acquaintance again,”
“...locked from the inside out! And in our chest of drawers there lay the key. You see, Potter, at only the second time the Manor tried swapping rooms, it had already combined this new power with one it had used dating from the fifteenth century. Isn’t that extraordinary?”
“Potter, wait,” Draco said. “You can… use my bathroom or whatever to clean up if you want. I’ll make supper or something,”
She huffed. “It’s true, Draco. I’m going to be nosy for a living. Blaise is going to be the only person of leisure left among us.”
“Really? That’s even more atrocious. Have you tried vinegar? Dilute it a bit, make sure you don't leave it on too long or the wood will rot,”
He sat up, expecting the soreness and heavy muscles that usually come with sleeping on the floor. It didn’t come. He scowled. Damn Potter again, making everything perfect. Draco snatched a pillow from the ground and chucked it at Potter’s stupid face.
The coffee shop, on the other hand, left something to be desired. Although the putrid scent was evaporating, the floorboards needed refinishing and the walls were indistinguishable from vertical floorboards. They would have to go. Wood paneling is, has been, and always will be tacky
“They’re just as ivory as the white ones, there. And the white ones are just as ivory as your hair, Drasha. The name is just as good as the thing itself, no?” he had said.
“Interesting couple you are, still calling each other my last names,” Alexandre said, handing a red bundle of fabrics to Harry.
As soon as he was in nothing more than underpants, Alexandre handed him a pair of light blue silk pants and a matching shirt, then a navy robe.
“Not anymore, Draco. They… they pulled him back up. We are undone, Draco, we are undone! Hide your mother,” he repeated with more urgency than before.
“I’ll leave you to it, then,” he said, sliding away from Harry and back into his floating piles of research.
“You really think you’re the only wizard in Abford? Please. I was a fourth year when you were sorted. I’m a Hufflepuff, in case you were wondering,”
There wasn’t anything else to do. Maybe in another life, he would have barged up to Harry’s door, knocked on it, and demanded Potter listen to his explanation. But this wasn’t that life, and Draco, despite his reputable talent of being a pain in the ass, didn’t want to put Harry on the offensive. After all, he wanted the idiot to like him.
The room smelled like an old book. It wasn’t an unpleasant smell, just one that indicated the room hadn’t been used all that much recently. Dust particles danced in the sunlight, and Narcissa seemed to be doing some subtle cleaning charms across the room.
