"Nothing,"  Harry would mumble before picking up his book.  Draco would silently curse before turning back to his own book.  It would take him at least ten minutes before he could focus again.
"Thanks."  He drank half of it while Harry stood awkwardly by the bed.  Draco noted he was still wearing his jeans.
"They go down like juice," Harry laughed, taking two of the tequila shots from the bar. "Take your shot and stop complaining about free alcohol." He passed one to Draco and shot him his signature crooked grin. Draco thanked Merlin for the alcohol — it made this whole interaction that much easier.
"Can you change your own trousers?"  He tried to say with a straight face but ended up chucking at Draco drowsy nod.  "Alright, I'll turn around."  Harry listened as Draco clumsily changed into the sweats for collapsing back on the bed.  "You alright now?"  Draco nodded, adjusting himself on the bed.  "Okay,"  Harry whispered and turned to leave.
“Hey!  I don’t go looking for trouble; trouble finds me and I just deal with it.”  He playfully glared at me and I couldn’t help but laugh at his pout.
"Get used to it Malfoy.  Proper is just another word for no fun."  Draco shot Harry a look before taking a bite.
Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about.”  She turned her gaze on one of the Patil twins, whose hand was now high in the air.  “And your name is?”
“Draco,” My father greeted stiffly. My mother smiled, laying a hand on my cheek. “Narcissa? Let’s go.” My father held out his arm. We both took it, making sure I had a good hold on my trunk, and we apparated home to the front hall of our home.
“Draco!”  Someone whispered from a closet.  I turned around and leaned forward.  The door opened, revealing Pansy smiling like an idiot.  She reached out, grabbing my arm and pulled me into the closet.
“Better watch where you’re going.  Don’t want to run into someone again.”  I called after him.  He shrugged and shoved his hands in his pockets.
"But like snakes slitherin' in the dark, I swear I felt something about to start."  Draco was only a couple rows behind the barricade now, mesmerised by Harry's singing.  He felt his gut clench as he processed the song — burn, lessons, war, snakes — he laughed to himself.  Of course, the parselmouth would sing about snakes.  "But we were on different sides, and I didn't think I'd make it out alive."  Draco's heart beat faster.  The more he listened to the lyrics, the more he heard himself in them.  Can't be.  He's singing about the war.  Could be anyone, he tried to convince himself, continuing to push forward.
"Yeah, yeah I'm alright. Tired, you know? Prides draining," Harry laughed as they packed their instruments and personal equipment. Cole clapped him on the shoulder, flashing his all-knowing smile that understood Harry wouldn't, or couldn't, talk about it.
We stayed there for a little while longer, exchanging stories of our childhoods, the good and the ugly.  Harry never let go of my hand.
It continued like this for a few months.  They'd argue almost every day over something small — "Put your books away, Potter", "For Heaven's sake Malfoy, turn down the heat" — but they would always end laughing at the ridiculousness of it all.  Throughout the first few weeks, they developed a routine — Draco almost always woke up first, putting the kettle on before waiting for Harry to make breakfast.  The few times Harry woke up first, he made them pancakes instead of oatmeal for breakfast.  They'd floo to training after Harry yelled at Draco for five minutes, assuring him his hair looked fine, and Draco yelling back that fine wasn't good enough.  They'd travel home after training and decide what was for dinner, Harry sometimes cooking, Draco sometimes getting take-away, or, on the rare occasion, Harry trying to teach Draco how to cook, which almost always ended in something burning or, at the very least, a massive mess.  After dinner, they'd sit in the lounge on separate sofas reading books for their courses, Draco draped elegantly across the couch while Harry folded himself awkwardly.  Draco would enjoy a cup of tea before going to shower while Harry knocked back a beer.  Harry would say goodnight as he'd walk past a freshly showered Draco in just his towel, who'd always blush but duck into his room before the former could notice.
I looked down.  Sure enough, a patch of red vines began not too far from my feet, weaving through the six other trees.
I walked to the Common Room to meet Pansy.  She grinned and jumped out of the armchair she was sitting in.
“You still can’t…”  I looked away.  I could hear the warble in Harry’s voice like a stab in the gut.
"Good evening Edinburgh!" He yelled into the mic.  The crowd cheered, and Harry felt his face break out into a huge grin.  "We are Patronus! Welcome to Edinburgh Pride! Now, who's ready to rock out?"   Harry rode the high into the first song.   "Aye! Now, normally we'd start with an original song, but since it's pride, we thought we'd start with a cover from one of our favourite bands.  Hit it!"  Cole traded in his bass for a synth for the opening song - Girls Girls Boys.   Unbeknownst to Harry, a certain blond man and dark-haired girl stood towards the back of the audience.
Now his hands were all over Draco — on his neck and face, fingers tangling in his hair.  Draco was soft in ways Harry could never have imagined and he loved coddling the slim boy.  Draco, on the other hand, loved every one of Harry Potter’s edges, his broad shoulders and defined muscles his favourite.  He ran his hands over Harry’s arms as Harry gently pushed him down on the couch.  Harry moved his lips down Draco’s neck, tugging the turtleneck down enough to reach the tender skin it hid.  Draco let out a soft whine at the feeling on Harry’s lips and beard moving down his body.
“Malfoy got Hermione!”  Ron whined.  “Look!”  He forced Granger to show Snape her teeth.  He looked coldly at her.
Wonderful.  Exciting news.  Likely some new artefact or powerful acquaintance.  Great.  I shoved the letter into my trunk.  I end up spending much of the afternoon trying to read the book Pansy gave me for my birthday but I’m unable to get past the first chapter as I can’t focus on the book.  I wanted so desperately to meet Harry but figured that he needed space right now and would let me know when he wanted to meet.
“Okay, well,”  She stared at me with her brow furrowed and eyes squinted.  “Get ready.  I’ll wait for you in the Common Room.”  I nodded as she left.  I quickly changed into my school robes and fixed my hair so it was no longer sticking up in the back.  I met Pansy and we walked quietly to the Great Hall.
"Okay."  Draco smiled, his eyes drooping shut, and reached out his arms, making a grabbing motion to Harry.  Harry sighed and laid down next to him.  He felt Draco's thin arms snake around his waist and pull him closer.
“Maybe a bit too close,” Blaise laughed, nudging Goyle with his elbow.  They all let out whooping laughs around me as we approached the rest of the class.  Harry glanced over at me with tired eyes and raised a brow at the snickering around me.  I smirked.
“Good idea.”  We stand up and head back towards the vine curtain.  “Oh, by the way, if you ever want to come here for an escape or whatever, just start at the tallest oak on the outside of the forest, and follow the red vines in.”  He nodded and smiled with pity.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,” Snape went on.  “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye.” His eyes rested on a table in the back.  I glanced over my shoulder to see Harry glaring back.  I rolled my eyes and turned back to Snape.  “But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell, so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students.  Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation.  Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.  The ingredients and method are on the blackboard.  You will find everything you need in the store cupboard.  You have an hour and a half. . . . Start.”
“Yes,” Harry nearly whispered.  Draco lifted his eyes to see Harry’s face dark and heated.  Draco slowly moved his hand up and down Harry’s cock, not breaking eye contact until Harry dropped his head back with a soft sigh.  Draco moved his hand a bit faster, bracing himself against Harry’s hip with his other.  The deep sounds rising out of Harry’s throat turned Draco on more than he could imagine.  Harry’s musky scent intoxicated Draco and it wasn’t long before Harry’s hand was in his hair.
“Harry, just calm down.”  I stepped towards him, holding my hands out but he just stepped back, looking as if I had insulted his entire bloodline.
“— and he hit Goyle — look —”  Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
"And here are your training partner assignments.  Remember, you'll be studying, training and living together for the rest of your training."  The Auror trainer handed everyone a paper with their assignment and Ministry provided address.  Harry mentally groaned when he looked at his —
They breathed out simultaneously before Draco slowly pulled away.  The moment their lips broke apart, a paralysing fear overtook Draco.  He kept his eyes shut tightly and slowly lowered his arms from Harry's face to his sides, regret washing over him as he longed for the touch again.  The silence between them felt deafening.
"What the- shit!  Malfoy!  What are you doing?"  Harry sat up in bed, fumbling to put his glasses on in the dim light.
“Are you ready for tomorrow?”  I asked, for possibly the fourth time that week.  He laughed lightly and shook his head.
I got a sinking feeling but chalked it up to a lack of sleep.  Pansy kept a careful eye on me once she woke up enough to notice.  The boys didn’t notice however, and kept their conversation going with mouthfuls of food.
“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Weasel and Granger,” I sneered.  Hermione rolled her eyes while Weasel seemed to prepare himself for a fight.
"Fuck yeah!  How you feeling on those keys, Cole?"  Jasper called out, driving the crowd wild.  He always was a crowd pleaser with his brilliant smile.  Cole laughed as he grabbed his bass.
"You're still pining after him, aren't you?"  Draco opened his mouth to protest but closed it, unable to deny his attraction to the singing man.  "Oh my god, Draco!"   Pansy cackled.  He glared at her.
“Do you want to go further?” Harry asked, leaning his head against Draco’s and wrapping his arms around his waist.  “We don’t have—”
"Your livers gonna give out one of these days," Mason muttered, earning him a good shove from Jasper.
They met eyes, paused for a moment, and burst out laughing.  Harry took off his glasses, throwing them on the bedside table and running his hand through his hair.  Draco’s hair, usually styled with a bit of product but nothing like it was during school, hung loosely, framing his flushed face.  Harry leaned over Draco, placing his hands either side of his head and knee tucked between his thighs.  He planted a soft kiss on the mark Draco’s collarbone, his head swimming from the sight of Draco splayed out on his sheets and the mixing of his shampoo and cologne.  Draco pulled Harry by his hair into a tender kiss.  Harry shifted his knee against Draco’s cock, eliciting a breathy whine from Draco.  Draco grabbed Harry’s hips, pulling him down roughly and deepening the kiss.  Harry let out a low, guttural groan as Draco’s hands ran up his sides and onto his chest.  A few breathless moments later, Draco pushed Harry up, who quickly broke away, face dropping.
“Can’t say.  We want to keep it under wraps for a bit,”  I explained.  Blaise huffed, catching up to me.
"You alright mate? You've been in a daze since, like, the second song." Harry was thankful for a friend like Cole — he always noticed when Harry was off, when he was zoning out during rehearsals or when they met for drinks, and he'd spend more time staring into his pint than drinking it. Harry felt guilty that he couldn't wholly confide in Cole. He couldn't just divulge into a magical war and the traumas he still carried with him. But he was thankful for the few things he could confide in — losing his parents as a baby, abuse from his childhood, dealing with school relationships and terrible teachers, losing other influential people throughout the years, unrequited love, the confusion of sexuality and trying to define it.
We walked in, hand in hand, to the Great Hall to find it silent and dark.  Black drapes replaced those that would normally have the winning house’s colours and crests.  The staff table was full except for Karkoroff’s seat.  We sat down next to Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise silently.  The Hufflepuff table was silent, many staring either down into their plates or at Diggory’s empty seat.  Before the food appeared on the table, Dumbledore carefully stood up.
"Is that how you figured out you're a 'raging homosexual'?" Harry grabbed the drinks and turned back around. The other boys had drifted away down the bar slightly, but neither Harry nor Draco seemed to mind. Or, more likely, they didn't even notice.
“Draco,” He said softly, pulling away.  I swallowed the words as his face stiffened.  “There’s something else you should know about what happened out there.”  I nodded as Harry carefully untangled himself from my arms.  He stepped back, stood with his back arrow straight and took a deep breath before looking directly into my eyes.
The sorting began, a few eager First Years joining our table, and few looked on the verge of tears.  Finally, the last girl was sorted into Hufflepuff and Dumbledore stood up.
“Now,” Draco murmured.  Harry slowly moved out, keeping his lips on Draco’s neck, refraining from moaning too much to start.
can’t find out. I must side with Voldemort for my own safety. Yet the moment I publicly declare my allegiance to him, I lose any relationship with Harry and Hermione. But if I declare my allegiance to Harry, my family and I will surely lose my life, as well as my families. There seemed to be no right decision now. These questions weighed heavily on my shoulders throughout the summer as much as I tried to dispel them from my mind.
In the middle of a crowd, the wizarding world's golden boy saviour, with his long hair and ripped jeans and pride flag cape, was kissing the Malfoy heir with pastel rainbow hair and tequila breath, and nothing felt more right at that moment. Draco ran his hands through Harry's curls, thanking whatever entity it was that was allowing this dream to come true. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's thin waist, pulling him flush against his body, their bodies fitting together perfectly. Just a few people away, Pansy watched with a smirk before turning back to the girl she was dancing with.
“It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face. . . .”  She passed the bowtruckle to Harry as I stepped towards them.
“No, I want to.  I really want to.”  Draco smiled and quickly kissed Harry.  A bright smile covered Harry’s face as he gently pushed Draco back on the bed.
“Just come, Draco.” She took my hand and led me into the drawing-room where my father had already taken a seat in his large, leather armchair.
"Still waiting to meet that Ginny girl you broke up with," Jasper smirked. They broke up — that actually makes sense. Her and Lovegood seemed very, very close. "She seemed good."
“I can’t help that you’re just so attracted to me,” Harry smirked and placed a soft kiss on Draco’s jawline.
“I was going to apologise because I knew the moment it slipped out it was wrong.”  I sighed.  “I know I can be a bully, and frankly, I hate it.  But if I stopped, my father would notice, and I really don’t know what he would do, but I don’t want to risk it.  But, I promise you, I won’t ever say it again if it’s not completely necessary, and even then I’ll think twice.”  I took a deep breath.  Harry’s face was still hard set as he looked at me until he finally nodded.
“Dumbledore will bend over backwards for that boy! He’s got the whole of the Ministry wrapped around his little finger—” My mother laid a careful hand on his chest and he let out a sharp breath, regaining his composure.
“Go on, then, Potter,”  I said quietly, drawing out my own wand.  I knew at this point I screwed up in calling Granger a Mudblood and deserved whatever it was Harry wanted to throw at me.  I just had to entice him enough.  “Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve got the guts —”  For a split second, we looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.
“Good idea.”  I nodded, tearing my eyes away from the Gryffindor table.  “I can’t believe how much homework we’ve already been assigned.  It’s the first day!”
We stayed in my room until 6:30, when, against Pansy’s judgement, I decided to walk to the lake and sit by the edge.  I stared at the water lapping against itself in small waves trying to steady my breath.  It grew steadily darker as the half-hour passed until it was inevitably 7.  And I was still alone by the lake.
“Earlier today, for example.  You fixed my glasses.  And you weren’t exactly sneaky with your staring this morning, or yesterday, or any of the other days this year or last.”  My face got hot.
Over the next few days, I pushed the pit of anxiety in my stomach away as Harry’s trial approached. I wished to reach out, tell him everything would be okay, hold his hand and kiss his head. I forced myself to not think about how worried he must be, to not think about his wonderful smile, stupid hair, brilliant eyes. If Voldemort were to see how I imagined him, how I thought of him, I would be dead in a matter of minutes. Or Imperioed to draw Harry out. Or Crucioed to spill information. Or my family killed— I found it best to not think of the consequences.
"Hey Malfoy, you're still dressed up but you've got to change before you can sleep,"  Harry explained.  Draco nodded sleepily and held up his arms.  Harry sighed deeply.
Harry stepped out onto the stage.  It was a year after the war, eight months after he joined a then fairly unknown indie-punk band out of Edinburgh.   Despite everyone telling Harry he should become an Auror or join the Ministry, he couldn't stand the camera flashes or constant reporters.  He needed time to just be Harry — not Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, the man who defeated the greatest dark wizard of all time.  No, he needed time to figure himself out, build relationships and explore what else the world had to offer him.  So, he fled to a village outside of the city a month after the war ended, only telling Hermione and Ron his whereabouts.   A couple of months later, he met a few guys looking for a bandmate at a local cafe.  Seeing them perform reminded Harry how much he enjoyed singing before, you know, he spent every year just trying to survive, and so, after their set, he asked them about it.
"If you needed a place to stay," Harry stumbled over his words, eyes wide, hoping he didn't scare Draco. "I mean, of course, you don't have to—"
“Will it be?” He asked softly, pulling away ever so slightly.  I looked into his eyes and saw something I never saw in them before — pure, unadulterated fear.  Unimaginable and deep, sinking far from the surface, nearly obscured in its depth.
“I’m going to clean up.”  He stood up and looked them both over.  “Shower?”  Harry asked, holding out his hand.
“The… important stuff.  You’ll find out soon.  Like at the feast soon.”  She nodded and grabbed my hand.
A few minutes later, I was waiting near the edge of the lake again, however this time, I was more excited than nervous.  Harry came strolling down, looking much more at peace.
"Okay."  Draco walked back to the door and paused.  "I'm just next door if you want or need anything."
“Pansy — think about what you’re saying.  Me, Draco Malfoy, the face and name of the Malfoy family at Hogwarts.  If I admit I’m anything but straight, my father will disown me, if not worse.”  Pansy groaned.  “Oh you know I’m right.  If I tell Potter and he doesn’t like it, then he could just turn around and tell the entire school—”
"Well, we're grabbing drinks before the next band plays. You're more than welcome to join us, as always," Cole laughed. Harry appreciated Cole's friendship, especially. He made him feel normal.
My appearance was also slowly declining. I ate less during meals, the presence of the Dark Lord draining my appetite. I slept less at night, overwhelming fear of dreaming and what was to come in the next school year. I did my best to hide my dark circles and slimming frame from my parents and the Dark Lord, but my mother took notice. She said nothing but would give me meaningful glances during dinner and when we would return to our rooms.
“I have business to attend to,” He snapped. “Now go. I have things to do.” He dismissed me with a wave of his hand.
When Draco heard the heavy steps coming down the stairs, he turned around with a mug in his hands but almost dropped it.  Sure, he had seen Harry shirtless plenty of times, even when they were living together, but he wasn't expecting a shirtless Harry with his sweatpants hanging low on his hips, revealing almost too much, with his hair a mess and glasses haphazardly strewn on his face.  As he lifted his arms to stretch, Harry let out a low groan and Draco nearly squeaked as the sweats dropped a centimetre lower.
"You alright Potter?"  Draco asked quietly.  He could smell the alcohol on Harry's breath as he giggled.
“Wouldn’t think of it!” I called back.  I made my way up to the corridor with the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, taking note of cupboards and alcoves students — or myself — may use for secret rendezvous.  There was no sign of Harry in the hall yet, so I paced through the surrounding ones until I heard someone coming down the hall.  It turned out to be a fourth year Hufflepuff going to meet their girlfriend in a nearby cupboard.  I stuck around for a little while longer until I heard the door of a classroom creak open.  I rounded the corner to see Harry quickly walking in my direction.
“Don’t say his name for heaven’s sake!”  I raised my hand, trying to get him to just stop yelling for just a moment.
"Let's get some breakfast, alright?"  Draco followed Harry downstairs a few minutes later to find him making pancakes. Draco sat at the table and just watched Harry cook. Harry always amazed Draco with the arsenal of classic rock songs he had memorised that he'd sing and bop to when he cooked and this morning was no different.  Harry was swaying his hips and mixing pancake batter.  Mittens weaved in between his feet, purring lightly, and Draco, despite a throbbing headache, overall aching body and slight terror of whatever happened when he blacked out the night before, he felt incredibly at peace and filled with warmth.
“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance,” She continued dully.  “The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction.  The ancient skills unique to the Wizarding community must be passed down through the generations lest we lose them forever.  The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.”  She bowed slightly to her colleagues and I rolled my eyes.
“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor Umbridge in one breath without looking at him.  “As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.”  A deep pit settled in my stomach.
The Great Hall was bustling and reeling with joy for the new year.  Pansy and I joined Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise at the Slytherin table as McGonagall led the First Years in with the Sorting Hat and a stool in her hands.  As she set the stool and Hat down, it began singing it's beginning of year song.  I didn’t pay much attention, as I never really did, until the Hat neared the end.
“So what?  Am I just supposed to sit idly while the Ministry does nothing?”  His face was now twisted and red, anger pouring off of him.
“I know I haven’t seemed the best lately but I swear, it’s just because of the tournament,” He reassured me again as he had been for the past few weeks.  It almost sounded rehearsed at this point, or like he was trying to convince himself of it.  It didn’t relieve me much, but I decided it was good enough for now.  Maybe after the tournament, I’d press more about it, but he could just be stressed about the final task.
Still fairly early in the journey, the train was bustling with students excited to see their friends again.  Students darted in and out of the corridor between compartments, laughing and making a ruckus.  I did my best to restrain from taking too many points before the year even started, but some people need to just learn to sit down and talk like civilised adults.  Throughout the walk, I kept my eyes peeled for Harry, hoping we might get a moment alone before school begins, yet to my luck, I found him in a full compartment at the end of the train.
“Harry Potter, the boy who must always play the hero.”  I pressed a kiss to his forehead as he grumbled.
“That’s… that’s absolutely horrible.”  I muttered.  I tried to wrap my head around it.  Sure, I was a bully, albeit not entirely by choice, but I could never imagine doing that to a child every day.  Family.
"Patronus.  I like that!" Cole sat up from the couch he was laying on.  Harry looked up from fiddling with a drumstick like he used to with his wand.   "I really like that! Jasp? Mason?" Huh.  Nice.
“She’s also a professor and a ministry employ—”  I started calmly, but Harry clenched his jaw and pushed away slightly.
“You really didn’t have to go at Ron like that, you know,” He chastised lightly, pulling away enough to look me in the eye.  I pursed my lips and nodded.
“How was detention?”  Harry looked worse than during dinner.  His hair was a wreck and matted against the back of his neck.  His glasses and tie were both crooked and his robes hung off of him haphazardly.
.  Harry sat next to Weasel near the front with Hermione next to them, looking just as bored as the rest of the class.
“As long as we can.”  My heart fluttered.  “I don’t plan on letting you go any time soon.”  I tightened my hold on him slightly as he hummed quietly on my chest.
“Why are you being nice?”  I glanced down the hall behind him.  People were going to start coming down the corridor soon.
“Draco!” Harry yelled.  I could see the fear and anger rolling off of him.  “I’m not wrong and I’m not lying!”  I took a deep breath.  My whole body was shaking and I could feel Harry watching intently.
“I’m sorry.”  I choked out as I stared out at the water.  The sun was setting, and a slight wind was picking up.
.  I tried to send him an apologetic glance but he looked away before I could.  The three conversed for a moment before Hermione ran out of the Great Hall.  I tried to meet Harry’s eyes again and signal him to meet me, but he was deep in conversation with Weasel.  A few minutes later, Pansy nudged me.
"What? He's hot, alright!"  So hot, Draco couldn't stop staring.  He hadn't seen Harry since his trial, and that was a very different man.  For the trials, Harry wore a smart grey suit, no doubt picked out by Hermione, with his hair still short and unruly but tamed with some SleakEazy.  He spoke professionally and respectfully, focusing on the defendants' actions and what they'd done for Harry rather than using his fame to pull strings.  Draco was grateful for that — the Ministry acknowledged him as an independent person now because of it.  He'd be the first to admit that Harry looked very nice during the trials — grownup, professional, a leader.  But the Harry Draco saw on stage was a completely different man.  He no longer held any sort of composure, jumping and dancing and thrusting to the music.  He was all over the stage, leaning into the audience, his long hair sticking to his face and shoulders.  When did he grow out his hair?  Draco wasn't complaining though — his hair now resembled that of a lion's mane, and all Draco could think about was running his hands through it.  Harry had also grown out of his boyish form into a well-built man.  Draco couldn't turn his focus from the way Harry clenched the microphone or threw his head back on a high note.  He wore beat-up trainers and ripped jeans and if he looked close enough, Draco was sure he saw eyeliner as well, holding none of the professionalism that he held a year ago.  Instead, Draco could see the rage Harry had pent up being poured out in his music.  He let himself go on the stage.
“A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,” called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.  I looked at my own potion — perfect.  Pansy’s… a little less perfect.  More grey than silver, but very close.
“Oh!  Also!”  She reached into her pocket.  “Here.” She handed me a piece of parchment.  “I wrote the note for you. It doesn’t look like your handwriting, so he shouldn’t suspect anything.  Not that he would notice anyway, he’s pretty oblivious.”  I laughed.
“I took it too far, I know.”  I ran my thumb along his cheek.  “But we have to keep up the image that we’re rivals still.”
.”  I pulled him into a tight hug.  His tense muscles relaxed slightly in my arms and I closed my eyes, savouring the sweetness of the moment.
One night after drinking a bit more than he should have and dancing particularly aggressively to a song, causing Draco to throw his head back laughing, Harry flopped onto the couch, almost sitting on Draco in the process, and leaned his head against Draco's shoulder.  Draco felt heat rise to his face as he continued to try to focus on his reading.  Harry reached out a finger to point at the picture on the page.  He tapped the page, giggled quietly and dropped his hand onto Draco's lap.
"Well tonight, it's alcohol first. A round of tequila please!" The boys all groaned but smiled regardless. Harry glanced sideways to Draco, relieved to see him smiling along with his friends. He was initially worried that Draco being, well, Draco, could cause a rift, but he seemed to be behaving well. The boys even seemed to like Draco. He fit in like a missing puzzle piece they didn't know existed.
“The Death Eaters… one of them… I recognised their voice… Voldemort even called him by name…” He struggled.  I saw a flash of pity in his eyes.
"Potter?"  Draco arched a brow as Harry poured.  Harry tried to ignore the use of his last name and the pull it had in his stomach.
Not long after, Harry bought himself a record player and began collecting vinyls.  His first album was a second-hand copy of Bob Seger's Greatest Hits.  Draco watched as Harry took the album out and inspected it for scratches before setting it down on the turntable and starting the music.
"What's going on with you? You never say thank you!" Harry laughed, then took his own shot, also cringing slightly.
“I bet he’s got detention for at least a month!”  I squeezed her hand tightly.  We all began walking towards the hut at the edge of grounds for class.
We went to our first class — History of Magic, which we all nearly slept through — and second — Herbology — without any sight of the Golden Trio or, more importantly, Harry.  Thankfully, he had returned to his seat at lunch.  Relief washed over me when I saw him and dissipated just as quickly when I noticed how sullen he looked.  I glanced up every few minutes to check on him, but his expression didn’t change.  About 20 minutes into the meal, his eyes met mine.  They flicked to the door quickly and his head tilted slightly.  I nodded.  I watched him walk out before excusing myself a minute later.  He was waiting at the end of the right-hand corridor, leaning against the corner.  I followed him as he slipped into the next corridor and then a broom cupboard.  I locked the door behind me.
"Yeah, don't worry about it."  Draco put a hand up, stopping Harry in his tracks.  "You'll be a great Auror with those instincts."  He smiled.
“Well, if it weren’t our new Prefects!”  Blaise stood up and clapped my shoulder.  Crabbe and Goyle both nodded to us before turning back to their conversation.  “They’ve been acting strange since I saw them on the platform.  All whispery and secretive.”  Blaise shook his head.
“Tell me Draco,” The Dark Lord turned sharply to me. “Were you aware he is able to cast a Patronus?”
“That’s good.  You can tell him tonight.”  She spoke quietly as if she was scared she would startle me.
“It does seem like that.”  I smiled at him.  It was nice getting to know this side of him, beyond the fame and numerous near-death experiences.  He seemed much more human now.
“You know,” Pansy grumbled as we walked down another empty, dark corridor a couple of hours into our rounds.  “I was so excited to be a Prefect but now this is just boring.”  Just then, a few voices came floating down the corridor ahead of us.  “Oh finally!  People!  I bet you five sickles they’re Gryffindors.”  I shook my head at Pansy’s excitement.  Ahead of us, Hermione and Weasel rounded the corner.  “Ha!” Pansy whispered.  “You owe me.”
In one swift motion, Draco took Harry's face in his hands and brought their lips together.  His nose bumped Harry's glasses and their teeth nearly clashed together.  Harry froze for a moment, his hand still on Draco's shoulder, eyes wide open, before gripping his shoulder tighter and closing his eyes.  Their lips were still sweet from that morning's breakfast, and Harry could taste the honey from Draco's tea.  Draco breathed in deeply and recognized the scent of apples from the night before — Harry's shampoo.  Harry's stubble was rough in his hands and against his face.  Harry revelled in how soft Draco's lips were, and the delicate scent of his cologne flooded his senses.
As much as I enjoyed sitting by the lake and seeing the sunset, it’s nearly winter.  In Scotland.  We’d either have to bundle up and light a fire every time or find a place inside the castle.  But there aren’t many unused spaces in the castle that would work — either too small, too dirty or inaccessible.  So outside it is.  I slipped quietly out the side door near the lake.
“What Malfoy?”  Potter flailed his arms about, stepping closer to me.  “What could possibly be so important that you drag me to the lake after dinner after possibly one of the worst days I’ve had since Voldemo—”
“Why would I tell you that I like you if I didn’t know you’d respond embarrassingly?”  I tried to reason.  If I can just get him to believe me then maybe...  “And how would I even know that you would react in that way?  Besides, wouldn’t this be more embarrassing for me, especially if this got out?”  He stared at me for a moment, his eyes slitted.
"I'm gonna get you some water,"  Harry muttered, stroking a stray hair from Draco's face.  He nodded slowly and closed his eyes.  When Harry returned with the glass, Draco had slumped onto his side, giggling at nothing in particular.  Harry sat down the glass, shaking his head and smiling to himself as he sat Draco back upright.  "Drink,"  Harry handed him the glass.
"Care to dance?" Harry asked after finishing his drink. Draco choked on his drink and sputtered. "Or maybe some water first?" Harry laughed, patting Draco's back as he recovered.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” I said, still smirking but feeling a pang of guilt in my gut.  “Well, just watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be
“Yeah, I guess you could say so.”  I shake my head.  “Complicated doesn’t even seem to cover it honestly.”  Pansy reached across the table and gently took my hand.
"I'm great,"  Harry sighed.  He closed his eyes and began dozing off on Draco's shoulder.  At that point, Draco set down his book and smiled at the sleeping man.  He sat there until the record finished.  He debated letting Harry sleep on the couch but ultimately decided to carry Harry to his bed.  He thanked Merlin that he was already in wearing sweats and he wouldn't have to strip a drunk, sleepy Potter.
“How is anyone expected to be this precise!”  Pansy buried her head in arms on the table as I snickered.
,”  Harry and I shared a knowing smirk.  “I’ll double that.  Get on.”  I gave him a slight shove towards the portrait of the Fat Lady.  He mumbled the password and slipped inside.
“Oh!  Right!”  He chuckled and nodded again.  “Um, the Weasleys adopted him over the summer.  He just kinda, er, showed up one night.”
“Draco!”  I looked over my shoulder to see Blaise.  He was leisurely strolling down the hall, arms crossed in front of his chest.  “So, what did you guys ‘break up’ about this time?”  He sneered.  I sighed heavily.  Really, just the cherry on top.
“Are you sure it’s okay?”  I asked, looking away from Harry and towards the water.  “Me not saying it?”  He took my hand and squeezed it.
"Something like that." The rest of that weekend melted away in soft kisses and takeaway, the two men blissfully aware of each other, exploring the new relationship budding between them.
“Hey, hey, I know.  We’re all stressed out.  It happens.”  I pressed a kiss to his head as he wrapped his arms around my waist.
The silence surrounding us was deafening.  Potter’s face contorted between confusion, understanding and anger.  I took deep breaths, watching his every move. Even the lake stood still in anticipation for the impending explosion.
“This way.”  I nodded towards the tree line and started walking.  “Follow me carefully.  It’s magic, so of course, it’s easy to mess up.”
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices.  First years ought to know that the forest in the grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students ought to know by now too.”  I snorted to myself.  “Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr Filch’s office door.  We have had two changes in staffing this year.  We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the —”  A stout lady dressed head to toe in an obnoxious pink stood from her seat, not gaining much height, and squeaked out a small
“No, it’s okay, it was just,” Draco took a deep breath before smiling slightly.  “Unexpected.”  Harry nodded, his brow relaxing, before standing up swiftly.  Draco propped himself up and raised a brow.
As we unloaded the train, I saw the Golden Trio a few compartments away. Harry looked up and we locked eyes for a moment. I gave him a small smile and nod that he returned before we both left the train.
“Your son has been named as a Prefect for Slytherin House.” She held it up to my father who smirked proudly.
“Leave, Narcissa, Draco. I wish to speak to Lucius alone,” He hissed. My mother and I quickly stood, bowed, and left. As soon as we were out the door, we both let out a quiet breath.
Despite having an hour after the final exam before dinner, Harry did not return until the start of the feast.  Many more courses than usual were prepared and the Great Hall was filled with excited chatter.  I tried once again to get his attention, but he was completely consumed in his conversations with the Weasley clan.  Pansy kicked me under the table a couple of times when I had been staring for too long.  All too soon, the feast came to an end.
“I promise.”  He dropped my hand and moved his face closer to mine.  “Now come on, let’s just hang out.  I want to get my mind off the tournament for just a little while.”  I smiled and kissed him lightly.
"The one with blue hair is Cole," Harry yelled over his shoulder as they got closer to the bar. "The quiet one is Mason and the loud one who's probably already doing shots is Jasper." Draco's eyes widened as he realised Harry Potter was introducing him to his bandmates, his friends like they were friends.
After getting ready for bed early again, I shut the curtains around my bed and stared up at the ceiling, smiling.
“Just get on then, Malfoy.”  Hermione raised her brows at me.  “Come on Ron.  Doesn’t do any good to get in fights right now,”  She mumbled, pulling Weasel away.  She pursed her lips and gave me a stern look before looking at Pansy, her look softening slightly.  I glanced to Pansy, who was now blushing slightly.  I rolled my eyes and grabbed her arm.
“Thank you,”  I whispered in Pansy’s ear.  She giggled and nuzzled her head on my shoulder.  We sauntered back to the dungeons.  On the way, we saw a frazzled Potter.  His eyes were cast down as he walked fast from the Hall, trying to avoid other students.
“What’s changed?”  Realisation washed over his face.  “You’ve actually got someone, don’t you?”  Heat rushed into my cheeks.  He smiled like a kid who just found the full cookie jar.  “Ha!  You do!  Well, who is it, mate?”  I shook my head and started walking again.
I slipped it over my wrist before a sob broke from my throat. The stone that had been resting on my shoulders the past two days finally crushed me. I knew that Voldemort likely had listening charms throughout the house, so I covered my mouth with a hand and silently sobbed. If he heard me…
“Malfoy?”  I whipped my head around.  Potter actually came, jeans and all.  I quickly stood up, wiping my hands on my pants.  Despite the autumn wind chilling the air, my hands were sweaty.
The new professor began the lesson — bowtruckles — but I tuned most of it out.  A few minutes into the lesson, she instructed us to gather around the table to sketch and label bowtruckles.  I squeezed in as close to Harry as I could manage without being too obvious.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Bagman roared as we found a seat in the back of one of the stands.  “The third and final task of the Triwizard� Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand!  Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr Cedric Diggory and Mr Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!  In second place, with eighty points — Mr Viktor Krum, of Durmstrang Institute!  And in third place — Miss Fleur Delacour, of Beauxbatons Academy!”
"It's alright, I'd rather help you than sleep without knowing it."  Harry said.  Draco thought he sounded genuine, almost too genuine.  He wanted to sneer about how he didn't need his pity, but he knew the new Draco he was trying to create wouldn't do that.
“The Dark Lord is occupying the West Wing,” My father began explaining. “It would be in your best interest to avoid disturbing him. The Dark Lord has… made some changes to how our house operations. Please do your best to adhere to the new routines.” I nodded. “Now go, unpack. Dinner is at seven sharp. Do not be late.”
hey guys! so after this update, i'll be going on a brief hiatus from promises. i'm taking part in 4 fests coming up and some other side projects, as well as my work opening up in about a week. sorry to disappoint anyone but i will be back by august 4th with another update!
“The end of another year.  There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight, but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person, who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuff table, “enjoying our feast with us.  I would like you all, please, to stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.”  Around us, benches scraped the floor as students stood.  The Slytherins around me remained sitting.  I grabbed my goblet regardless, silently saluting Diggory.
Neither man slept that night, thoughts too occupied with the other.  Draco couldn't stop thinking about the way Harry's fingers felt around his wrist and Harry couldn't stop hearing the way Draco practically sang his name.  Regardless, Draco got up first, putting on a kettle and pouring the cat food, cuing Harry to come down the stairs.  They exchanged few words that morning, opting for an awkward silence as they sipped their teas.
“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on.  “I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.  Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort.  He risked his own life to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts.  He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I honour him.”  Dumbledore slowly raised his goblet back up, everyone else following suit, mumbling a quiet toast to Harry.  I gripped my own goblet harder, wishing I could toast him.  “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further and promote magical understanding.  In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort’s return — such ties are more important than ever before.
“Very well.  Lucius,” He quickly turned to my father and cocked his head.  “Were you able to speak with the Minister about the new educational measures?”
“I missed you too,” Harry mumbled against my lips.  His hands rubbed along my sides, settling on my hips.  I took a deep breath, inhaling the soft scent of his shampoo mingled with a new cologne.  I broke the kiss and leaned my forehead against his.  My tongue felt heavy with all the words I wanted to say — Voldemort’s plans, rumours I’ve heard, how right this feels, how much I care — but I couldn’t form any words.  “I’m so happy to see you.  Even if you were a bit of an arse on the train yesterday.”  Harry’s voice was light and his eyes were brightening slightly.
"I'm sure it'll still taste good,"  He comforted as Harry frantically looked for a way to improve the steak.  Draco looked over Harry's shoulder and Harry couldn't help but shiver at the tickle of Draco's breath on his neck.  "Besides,"  Draco muttered, pulling away and seeing the shivers,  "I've burnt plenty of food that you still ate."  Harry shook his head and chuckled.
The stairs at the end of the hall led to the two bedrooms and bathroom upstairs.  The bedrooms were identical - double bed, wardrobe full of Auror gear, a desk and chair and a trunk at the end of the bed.  The only notable difference in the bedrooms were the sheets — one scarlet and one emerald.  Harry snickered to himself when he noticed, taking the room with the green sheets just to be a pain in the arse.
”  I countered.  I tried to use the least harmful hex I could without seeming like I was throwing the duel.  Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and mine hit Granger.  Goyle groaned as a bunch of boils began springing up on his face as Hermione began whimpering as her teeth grew.
“—get away with this!  We need to know how to defend ourselves!  I thought you would understand!”  Harry just glared at me for a moment before stomping away towards the exit.
Crabbe nudged me and I looked up as Hermione spat a mouthful of pumpkin juice onto the Prophet before Weasel grabbed it from her.
"You play the album all the time, it's one of your favourites.  Just picked it up," Harry laughed before continuing singing.  Draco flushed, realising he was the reason Harry knew the song so well.
We walked into the classroom just as Snape began the lesson instructions — copy the notes off the board for the first half, practising potion-making techniques during the second half.  Pansy dragged me over to a table just behind Potter, who was sitting alone.  I glanced around to find Weasel glaring at Potter with Granger next to him.  What the hell is his problem?  I shook my head, pulled out some parchment and began copying the notes.  A pit slowly formed in my stomach.  I never get nervous, yet even the thought of dropping a note next to Potter stressed me out.  Just stay calm and collected Draco.  I kept my head low and copied the notes, hoping the mindless task would distract me.  A few minutes into the second half of class, Pansy nudged me.
“We’ve got Care of Magical Creatures now.  Come on.”  She took my hand and we joined the boys on the walk down.
"Alright, boys, behave!"  Harry laughed as Jasper pulled Cole's plug out of the amp, causing a cursing match between them.  "Alright!  This next song is an original!"  Jasper started playing a riff as Mason set the beat.
“I know.  I know, I want to, but how?”  I laughed and threw my hands in the air.  Pansy shook her head and started pacing, ignoring my ranting.  “Potter doesn’t trust me, hell he probably thinks I’m a terrible person.  Not like I’ve given him any other impression…” I groaned. “Pansy, there’s no way I can tell him.”
“What about my footsteps?” My father now appeared unceremoniously in the doorway. My mother chuckled and took the pin from my hand.
“What do you think of Draco? We won’t have to worry about Mudbloods anymore,” Crabbe laughed. Pansy tightened her grip on my hand.
The house is cold and it seeps deep into my bones as I enter my room. All sense of personalisation has been removed. All that remains in the dark furniture set and grey walls. I locked the door behind me and let out a long breath. I sat on the bed, the world slowly spinning around me. I noticed a new watch on my bedside table.
“Would you two knuckleheads shut up!” I spat.  I glanced quickly to Harry to see him glaring at me before turning back to Dumbledore.
“Then Voldemort challenged me to a duel.  He started taunting me and tried to use the killing curse on me and I tried using
“Why would I lie to you?”  I called out.  He stopped.  “What could I gain from it?”  He turned around and glared at me.
"Potter, I can walk,"  Draco laughed as Harry insisted on holding Draco by the waist and draping his thin arm over his broad shoulders.
If Harry had to wake up Draco, he'd run in as soon as he heard the screams and shake Draco awake.  Often, Draco would have tears streaming down his face and Harry would ask if he could do anything.  At first, Draco would wipe his tears silently and shake his head.  After one particularly bad night, he just wiped his tears but let Harry stay on his bed.  A few nights later, he let Harry hug him, and Draco broke down.  He began sobbing into Harry's shoulder, mumbling about how he wasn't good enough and didn't deserve the new life he was given.  Harry just held him, rubbing his back and telling him that he was a good person.  They stayed there until the sun came out when Draco finally peeled himself off Harry's shoulder and apologized profusely.
, Mr Thomas!  As I was saying — you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and potentially lethal.  You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”
.  Be careful with your correspondences.  And your acquaintances,” My mother whispered.  She gave me a small, knowing smile.  My throat tightened.
One Friday night when they decided to stay in, while taking the rubbish out, Harry found a small black kitten with white paws next to the bin.
"Shit, I'm sorry.  It was just a nightmare.  I built up those instincts when we were horcrux hunting.  Are you alright?"  Harry got out of bed.
I woke up the next morning feeling more rested than I had in months.  I smiled as I let my thoughts wander to Harry, something I hadn’t been able to do in months.  A wave of relief washed over me before I remembered — it’s Monday.  First Monday of the year even.
curse but Draco repeatedly told him to not worry about it.  Draco, in turn, kept apologizing for his actions in the war until Harry convinced him to start Auror training.  Both were grateful for the forgiveness of the other man, but neither would speak of it.
“Shush, these halls don’t stay empty forever, you know.”  I shot him a glare, and he stopped smiling.  “Take this.” I shoved the note into his hand and smiled a bit.  “I’m also going to apologize in advance for these.”  I pressed the pin to show him the second message.  His face got red.  “Hey, I’m only doing it to keep appearances.  I didn’t make them.”
“We just wanted to find you lot before we do our first patrol round,” Pansy muttered, still staring at Crabbe and Goyle.  “Weird ones.  Come on Draco!”  She took my hand and we left the compartment.
I threw myself down on my bed as Pansy closed the door.  Blaise looked up from his desk and glared at us.
And I made it worse.  I tormented him every day and for what?  Because he wouldn’t be my friend first year?  I just added to the hate and mistreatment in his life despite my feelings for him.  I could’ve helped.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.  A uniform gasp rang throughout the room.  I felt my throat close.  The last time I knew of Harry talking about this, he broke down in front of me.
“I— how— you—”  For the first time, I, Draco Malfoy, was truly speechless, until I finally managed to blurt out—  “I do not sound like that!”  Potter threw his head back, laughing.
“Yeah.”  He pulled away and moved to the door.  “Love you.”  I nodded as he left.  I stayed in the cupboard for a moment, my feet rooted where I stood.  I left a few minutes later to find Pansy walking down the corridor.  She rushed over when she saw me.
“Don’t be,”  Harry smirked before moving back, pulling Draco even further into his mouth and spreading his cheeks to better massage Draco’s tight rim.  Draco moaned loudly, making Harry bob and massage faster.  A few moments later, Draco placed his hand on Harry’s head and pulled him off.
I kept turning my gaze to the Gryffindor table every few minutes.  Harry was engaging in a heated discussion with Hermione, Weasel, and Nearly-Headless Nick.  He looked up as I did, meeting my eyes for a split second.  I couldn’t read them like I used to be able to.  I prayed it was just the time.
"We had some shots, danced, met a couple of blokes.  One of them was pretty into you I'd say,"  Harry chuckled.  Draco blushed and drank the rest of the water.
“With this position comes great responsibility,”  The Head Boy continued.  “If the Headmaster feels as though you are not living up to your duties or are abusing them, you can and will lose your position, so be smart and respectful.”  He shot a meaningful glance towards Pansy and I.  Pansy cocked her head to the side and raised one challenging eyebrow.  I kept staring defiantly at the Head Boy as he continued.  “Your first task as newly appointed Prefects is to patrol the train throughout our journey.  Make sure the younger classes, particularly First Years, are aware of what to do when we reach Hogwarts, and hold your peers accountable for any troubling actions.  Any questions?”  The carriage remained silent for a moment.  “No?  Perfect!  On your way then.”  He waved a dismissive hand, his eyes still lingering on Pansy and I a moment too long.  I rolled my eyes as we left the carriage.
“Okay.”  Pansy pressed a kiss to my temple before slipping out of my bed.  I laid back down as I heard the door click closed behind her.  I stayed there for hours just staring at the ceiling before grabbing my book, trying to focus my time on reading.  At 6:30, I gave up, washed my face and walked down to our spot.  When I walked through the vines, I saw Harry already by the water, pacing.
"Fine, Malfoy!"  Harry yelled back.  They stood there, staring at each other breathlessly before Draco started laughing quietly.  Within a few moments, both men were paralyzed with laughter.  Draco leaned against the wall while Harry stood doubled over with his hands on his knees.  How foolish it seemed after everything they had gone through — arguing about the showering schedule.  Once they caught their breath, Draco smiled before turning back to the bathroom.
“Oh cool it, will you Blaise?”  Pansy stared at him as if he were a child pulling at her pigtails.  He shrunk back into himself slightly.
"Yes, Potter,"  Draco enunciated before breaking into a fit of giggles.  Harry shook his head, retrieving a pair of sweats and tossing them on the bed.
“What do you want, Malfoy?”  He asked impatiently.  I swallowed.  “I'm not really in the mood for any of your antics.”
I woke up in the morning to a letter being dropped into the bed.  I groaned as the envelope slapped me in the face before I flung out an arm and accidentally punched Pansy.
“If you ever call Hermione that again, I will sock you in the jaw and you will not get a second chance,”  Harry said sternly.  I nodded.
“It’s not that bad.”  She smiled almost wickedly.  “You got plans tonight?”  I rolled my eyes again.
“Manners, Potter,” I drawled.  “Or I’ll have to give you a detention.  You see,” I took a step into the compartment, eyes fixed on Harry.  “I, unlike you, have been made a Prefect, which means that I, unlike you,” I fixed a perfect smirk on my face, restraining from laughing at the red painting Harry's cheeks.  “Have the power to hand out punishments.”
“And they told us not to talk about it you dumbass!” Pansy defended me.  I squeezed her hand gently as a silent thank you.
Draco was still pushing his way to the front when the band began the second song.  The crowd pulsated to the beat, and Draco kept pushing his way.  He needed to get to the barricade.  He hadn't paid much attention to the first song the band did, already knowing the song enough but also being completely transfixed by Harry Fucking Potter.  Having overcome his shock, he now paid attention to the performance.
"Really, Potter?  Thought you'd want the Gryffindor colours."  Draco leaned casually in the doorway, smiling at Harry as he unpacked his trunk.  Harry looked up, meeting Draco's eyes and smiled.
"Chocolate chip?" Harry glanced over his shoulder with a lazy smile.  Draco nodded and moved to fill Mitten's bowls.  The room that had been so tense for the past week finally felt comfortable again.  They stood next to each other, Harry stirring the batter and Draco filling Mitten's food bowl, and shared a brief glance of unspoken words.  Harry smiled, dazed, and Draco felt his insides melt at the sight of him.
"Yeah."  Harry nodded sadly.  They stayed there for a few minutes, Draco staring at his hands and Harry staring at the wall.  Eventually, Harry looked up at Draco, smiled lightly and bumped his shoulder with his own.
Despite the lack of clouds in the sky, our compartment was dark. I sat next to Pansy, who leaned her head on my shoulder. Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise sat across from us. Crabbe and Goyle engaged in a heated discussion of the Dark Lord’s return, claiming it to be the best thing to have happened since he first rose.
“You look…” Harry mumbled, raking his eyes up Draco, taking in every pale dip and rise in his torso, each of the long pink scars Harry wanted to kiss the length of, the darkening mark on his neck, up to Draco’s pinked cheeks and meeting his eyes.  Draco nearly choked at the look in Harry’s eye.  He propped himself up on his elbows.
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus.  He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either.
“Alright, I was just wondering,” She muttered before turning back to her own breakfast.  I glance up towards the Gryffindor table.  Harry was happily talking with Hermione and Weasel over a mountain of breakfast food, comparing schedules.  He looked happy — bright smile, a mouthful of food, loud laughter.  I hoped that it was real, that it wasn’t just a facade.  That maybe, just maybe, the end of last year didn’t happen.  That Voldemort’s presence in my house was all just a fever dream.  That my father hadn’t inadvertently almost ruined our relationship.  That Harry and I could just be happy again.
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas hotly.  “Mind you, we still learned loads —”
“I missed you,” I muttered into his hair.  He looked up and pressed a hard kiss against my lips.  I moved my hands to his neck and deepened the kiss.  A rush of bliss coursed through my veins.  His lips tasted intoxicatingly sweet as I tried to pull him closer than I thought was physically possible.
“Okay, well, I’ve lived in Malfoy manor my whole life.  I’ve never met either of my aunts or much of my family outside my parents and grandparents on occasion.”  I sighed.  “I grew up an only child, no cousins, no pets, not many friends before school.  My parents enjoyed vacations throughout Europe and teaching me magic from a young age, like flying a broom.  My father wasn’t around very often.  He took a lot of business trips, so I became rather close to my mother.  That’s about it.”  Harry lightly rubbed his thumb on my hand.
‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of hellebore,’” Harry’s voice trailed off as his face dropped.  Snape raised a brow.
“You raised your son well, Lucius. This will no doubt help you. He will be useful.” Voldemort slipped out of the room as fast as he had come in, the snake refusing to leave his side. As soon as he was out of sight, my mother rushed to my side again. I let out a shaky breath.
“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be welcomed back here at any time, should they wish to come.  I say to you all, once again — in the light of Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.  Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great.  We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.  Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.
“Please!  Like you were subtle!”  He shook his head, laughing.  “You know, I’m not as oblivious as everyone thinks.”  My stomach dropped.
“No matter how many times you point that out, she won’t change!  She’ll just keep giving you detentions!  Don’t you think your time is better spent outside detention teaching yourself defence?”
Harry's muggle tendencies began wearing off on Draco.  First, he commented on Harry's love for sweatpants, saying he could never understand the appeal until he had no clean trousers on one laundry day and had to borrow a pair.  The next day, he went out and bought seven pairs for himself, all different colours.  Harry would always giggle to himself when Draco colour-coordinated his loungewear.  However, due to Draco's lithe figure, none of the sweats fit quite right around the waist and tended to slip a little low for Harry's liking.  It was distracting when, on one particular night, he was teaching Draco how to cook a steak and he could see the slight strip of pale midriff when Draco would reach for a plate.  He tried to keep his focus on the pan but cursed under his breath when he burnt one side of the steak.  Draco looked over in hearing the slight curse and frowned.
“Come here, hun.”  I shifted around so that my head was on her chest and her arms around me.  “You need to sleep,” She muttered, running her hands through my hair.
“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house,” Dumbledore continued.  I kept my eyes on Harry as Dumbledore spoke.  He now stared intently at his plate and I wanted to move next to him and comfort him.  Instead, Pansy took my hand under the table and ran her thumb across my knuckles.  “He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play.  His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not.  I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.”  I took a sharp deep breath, hoping to Merlin that Harry was wrong and Dumbledore would say exactly that.  “Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”
“Oh, um, yeah, sorry.”  I tucked it in my back pocket, just out of sight but not out of reach.  “I thought I might have to obliviate you,”  I chuckled and rubbed the back of my neck.
“I wasn’t, I’m just saying.  I’m just trying to look out for you the best I can.”  He smiled as my hand rested on his cheek.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.”  He raised a brow, smirking in challenge.  The others in the carriage laughed.
After testifying at Draco's trial, they agreed to move past their differences from school and they were civil, even friendly when they saw each other.  Harry actually convinced Draco to become an Auror, and now they were going to be partners.
“Yes,” I started.  All three of their head’s shot up with varying levels of concern written across their faces.  Weasel looked ready to punch me, Hermione looked slightly baffled and Harry looked ready to smack me for my comments earlier.  I smirked even more.  “Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place.  So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.”
“You shouldn’t look so depressed after meeting with him, you know,” Pansy commented one Tuesday night in March as she followed me back into my room.  A week before, Rita Skeeter released a ridiculous story about Harry’s heart being broken by Hermione’s toying with both him and Krum, which I would not let Harry live down.  Every time I mentioned his obvious, undying love for Hermione, he’d groan and roll his eyes.
Not the worst I’ve seen, but not the best either.  No free periods, lots of doubles.  They do say fifth year is the worst.  I see why.  I wonder how many with Gryffindors.  I simultaneously hoped for many and few — many to see Harry in but few so I could actually focus.  Lose-lose either way, I guess.  Pansy leaned over my shoulder, comparing our schedules.
The weeks leading up to the third task we were unable to meet as often due to the upcoming exam period.  Most professors wanted to do mock O.W.L.s to prepare us, although most students were more focused on the upcoming task and the results of the tournament.  Snape remained as intolerable as ever, Hermione as frazzled as ever and Harry as stressed as ever.  When we were able to meet, it was brief and tense.  I didn’t tell him about my birthday since he had much bigger things to worry about and I didn’t want him to waste any money or time on it.  Pansy remembered regardless and got me a new book and my parents sent a box of sweets as well.
“Oh fuck,” Draco whimpered as Harry’s hands found and squeezed his arse.  Draco bucked his hips wildly, whining into the tiniest bit of contact he could gain.  Harry bit down on the tenderest part of Draco’s neck while pulling Draco’s hips towards him roughly.  “Merlin!”  Harry moaned at the sound of Draco’s breathy whines before pausing.
"I... right." Harry's glare softened. "I confused you with the other Harry in our class. Sorry." Harry held up his shot glass in a silent "cheers", and him, Jasper and Draco drank simultaneously.
However, it was the first time Draco felt it this deep in his stomach — an odd, tight feeling that made him dizzy and hyper-aware of Harry's eyes boring into the back of his head.  It made him quiver with an energy he had never felt before, something deep and scalding.  It made his brain foggy and brow sweat ever so slightly.  He hated what Harry could do to him by just being there, how he could weaken his knees with just a gaze.  He was used to the light flush that would sometimes paint his cheeks when Harry would sit too close and graze his hand, but he always chalked it up to the growing friendship between the men.  Now, as he felt his neck heat and face flush, the growing pit in his stomach made him think otherwise.
We stayed together much later than most nights.  The sun had long since set by the time we parted.  We walked, hand in hand, to the vine-covered exit.
Gasps filled the hall.  Pansy gripped my hand tightly.  Crabbe, Goyle and Blaise all stiffened and looked away from Dumbledore.  Despite the terror filling the hall, Dumbledore remained calm before continuing.
“Oh is that it then?”  Draco twisted in Harry’s arms to face him, smiling incredulously.  “Had nothing to do with you poking me in the ribs every time you wanted a kiss?”  Harry rolled his eyes.
“Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”  There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.  “I think we’ll try that again.  When I ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Umbridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’  So, has everyone got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”
However, when he opened them again, the sun was streaming in through the window and he was met with the gentle snores from the man next to him.
,”  I muttered, running my hands through his hair.  This was supposed to be just a nice meeting, hugging, kissing, hand-holding, water watching, and five minutes into it Harry’s pissed and I’m left alone.
The rest of the day passed slowly again.  Boring classes, boring free blocks spent with Blaise hopelessly flirting with Pansy while glaring at me.  I had a pit in my stomach from potions; I needed to apologise to Harry.  I understood that calling Hermione a Mudblood was likely crossing many lines.
"Something to do with bumps making a sound.  Not sure really,"  He chuckled.  He hummed along as Draco watched.  Not long after, Draco would ask how to use the record player and started joining Harry on his shopping trips, eventually buying his own records — pretty much anything he could find.  His collection ranged from a handful of classical albums to metal to pop to classic rock to disco.  Harry will never forget the time he walked in on Draco dancing to ABBA.  He thanked Merlin he had his Polaroid nearby to snap a picture before Draco noticed.
“Oh yes, my dear.”  Harry moved in for a sloppy kiss before moving again, angling his hips to hit the same spot again.  Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth and in a few minutes, their moans mingled in their mouths.  Their hips met in perfect rhythm, for a few minutes before Harry’s pleasure began to overwhelm him and his thrusts became sloppy.  Draco’s moans became high and frantic as Harry’s hand reached down for Draco’s cock and tugged fervidly.  Draco shuddered and threw his head back with a loud gasp, exploding across their chests.  Harry groaned from Draco tightening around him, thrusting quickly before grunting, his body stiffening.  His arm faltered and he fell next to Draco, half draped across him.  They laid there for a few minutes, breathing heavily.
.  And I couldn’t say anything without risking everyone I love lives.  I swallowed thickly.  I could save Harry, but at what expense.  I could possibly save us all.  Dumbledore and the Hat’s words echoed in my head — ‘
“And if Potter brings up the note?”  I began pacing again.  I might wear a hole in the floor before I ever get to the lake.
"Yeah, well I feel bad for knocking you into that wall."  Harry eased Draco onto the couch.  "Ice?  Tea?  Pillow?  Anythi-"
Hoping that the rest of the day would go by without any problems, yet, just before Potions, Crabbe shoved me to show two-thirds of the Golden Trio approaching.
Harry also fell asleep on his couch, but when he woke up, the kitten was no longer on his chest.  He groggily sat up, frantically looking for the tiny creature until he saw a sight on the other couch he'd never forget — Draco Malfoy, with his limbs splayed out across the black leather, and a tiny black and white heap of fur peacefully sleeping on his chest.  Harry shuffled off to his room to retrieve a Polaroid camera and take a picture of the ridiculously cute scene.
“Only for the public.”  He mimicked.  “Yeah, I realize.”  He walked to the bathroom and slammed the door.  After a moment, the shower came on.  I closed the curtains and laid down, hoping to sleep well for once.  Except, for the next two hours, as Blaise banged about the room in a fury, I ran through Pansy’s plan in my head until I was certain of two things.
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” We chanted back at her.  I glanced around the classroom.  Most students looked somewhere between the brink of falling asleep and utter contempt.
Draco pushed one last bit, so he was at the front of the crowd, earning him a kick in the shin from a girl who got pushed back, but he couldn't care less. Harry was now right in front of him. Just look here you bumbling idiot! And Harry did.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Dumbledore began his announcement, effectively claiming the attention of the bustling room.  “In five minutes’ time, I will be asking you to make your way down to the Quidditch field for the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Will the champions please follow Mr Bagman down to the stadium now.”  I watched as Harry warily stood, saying goodbye to his friends, and making his way to the other champions.
“I truly hope we won’t hear the same speech in every class,” I muttered.  We made our way to Potions early to snag a good seat and get on Snape’s good side for the start of term.  The warm classroom filled quickly as we talked idly.  A few moments later, the door shut loudly and I glanced over my shoulder to see the Golden Trio take their seats at the back of the room as Snape billowed in.
For a couple of minutes, the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had finished, Umbridge spoke up again.
“Positive.  Absolutely.  He did something with Wormtail’s Dark Mark and then he started just talking about his family and stuff.  Then a bunch of Death Eater’s came and he started a speech about loyalty and then he… he touched me.  My head.  The last time I confronted him, my touch burned him and killed him.  This time it did nothing.  He told the Death Eaters how he found Quirrel and then Wormtail and how it all led up to this point.  He t-tortured me.”  Harry’s voice broke slightly and a tear slipped out.  He rushed to wipe it away before continuing.
"Drinks.  Tonight,"  Harry muttered as soon as they got home.  Draco was taken aback but Harry's sudden brashness but nodded anyway.
"Draco, what is it?"  Pansy asked, looking up from her phone.  It was Friday, they had only gotten there the day before, and she already had six girl's phone numbers.  He didn't even hear her and continued gaping at the stage.  "What?"  She followed his gaze.  "Is that..."
to give Harry the cold-bucket-of-water wake-up.  Harry would thank him as soon as he dried himself using the hot-air-charm.  Draco would ask if there was anything he could do to help and Harry would quickly say no and that he was alright.  Draco would leave but not sleep for the rest of the night.
“Yeah, they didn’t want me to get out of the house.  Last year I ran out after accidentally blowing up my other aunt like a balloon.  The Knight Bus picked me up, and I stayed at the Leaky Cauldron until school started.  This year the Weasley’s took me to the World Cup, which you already know.”
"Hasn't everything?" Harry smiled and nodded. "I mean, you're in a rock band, my hair is dyed, and we're actually getting along right now." Draco laughed again and shook his head.
“You need to do something.  You look miserable anytime Potter’s in your sight.”  She paused and looked away for a moment. “I've seen the way he looks at you sometimes . . .”
“Very good. Are you trained in the Dark Arts?” Voldemort’s serpent voice sent a shiver down my spine that I did my best to repress.
“The girls and I were talking last night.”  She started walking out as I continued laughing behind her.  “Let’s just get food.  I need coffee.”  I wrapped my arm around her shoulders and she yawned.
"Potter!  I want a proper meal!  Not some half-assed Muggle meal in a Styrofoam container!"  Draco yelled, flailing his arms about as he paced the kitchen.  Harry pressed his hand to his temple.
“Prefect? Oh, wonderful Draco! Following in your father’s footsteps!” She pulled me into a hug and kissed my cheek.
So he tried to ignore it.  Every time Harry's gaze or touch would make him flush.  Every time his breath would caress his cheek or hand touch the small of his back as he'd try to move past in the kitchen.  He avoided Harry's gaze whenever he could, never noticing the similar flush on Harry's cheeks.
As Dumbledore dismissed the feast, Pansy and I did our best to round up the First Years and show them to the Dungeons.  Once we were satisfied with how they had sorted out, Pansy and I left for my room.  Blaise was already there, hanging his clothes in his wardrobe.
"You want anything?" Harry leaned close to Draco's ear. It was getting harder to hear as the band on stage started their set. The sound of Harry's voice so close to him sent shivers down Draco's spine. "I'm paying."
“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the ‘whole point’ of any class is.  Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study.  You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —”
“Are you wearing my trousers?” I asked.  She looked up with an innocent smile and mischievous glint in her eye.  She was wearing
“You two really ought to focus more!  Harry could very well die in this and you two aren’t taking it seriously!  I really expected more from you Draco!” He’d say, marching around with his head held high once we got to our spot.  I’d laugh and shake my head, reminding him she did have a good point.
.”  I smirked even more and grabbed his arm, throwing open the door.  “Get out of that closet.”  I swiftly pulled him out.  He stumbled slightly and shot me a dark glare.  “I’m walking you back to Gryffindor tower to make sure you don’t wander off.”
“Okay, but you were just nice to Potter!  Don’t you think he’ll think something’s up?”  Her eyes were wide and she looked a bit like Aunt Bellatrix’s Azkaban poster.
“No,” He murmured against my lip.  “Nope, we aren’t talking about that tonight.  I’ve got detention for the rest of the week.  I want to spend tonight just—”  I pulled away slightly to look him in the eye.
"What, Potter? Trying to get me drunk?" Draco smirked and laughed. Harry glared at him, cheeks flushing slightly, before realising Draco's near-fatal mistake, Harry's eyes widening.
Harry was actually glad they were able to move past their old rivalry.  He felt terrible about what had happened before and during the war.  They talked over drinks at a Muggle bar after Draco's trial, both men apologizing for their mistakes throughout school.  Harry still felt guilty for the
Harry, however, ended up going to the Weasley’s for a week, coming back to train for the tournament however he could think of.  Hermione came back with him, but Weasel stayed with his family for a little while longer since one of his brothers was home.  At least that’s what Harry told me.  Since the castle was fairly empty, we were a bit less cautious about meeting.  I’d join them in the empty library as Hermione poured over a book about the history of the tournament for no less than the fifteenth time as Harry groaned about wanting to do realistic training — duelling, flying, the works.  I’d try to focus, but with Harry nudging my feet under the table and asking to go play Catch the Snitch, it was difficult, and Harry had a very convincing pout.  Hermione would chastise us for being reckless and not using our time wisely, but Harry loved mocking her as soon as we got alone.
"Fine—”  Pansy began squealing and hopping about.  “Pansy, calm down.”  She glared at me for a quick moment before breaking out in giggles again.  “Pansy— listen to me.  How?  How do I ask him?”  She paused and zoned out for a moment before exclaiming —
We arrived at the Platform earlier than normal, my parents eager and thankful to get out of the house.  They stood proudly beside me, my mother straightening my robes and pin.  The chatter and excitement of the beginning year rejuvenated me briefly.
“It was fine,” Pansy said hotly.  We rode the rest of the way in comfortable silence, making idle conversation every so often.  The sky darkened as we moved farther north.  Soon, a heavy stream of rain pattered down over the train.  As we neared the castle, we walked the length of the train again for good measure and prepared for our departure duties.
The Great Hall was silent that morning.  Most people weren’t eating.  Many just stared into the distance or at the empty seats next to them.  Diggory’s seat was like a void, fellow Hufflepuffs staring into the space, looking for answers.  A few minutes after the meal started, Dumbledore slowly stood up/
“You two are a good pair.” I nodded and she stood. “Come, mustn’t be late for dinner.” She led me to the dining room that had also undergone a slight makeover — dark, cold and dreary like the rest of the house. Voldemort sat at the head of the table already. My mother curtsied when we walked in and I quickly bowed. I sat next to her on the left as my father walked in, bowing and sitting across from us. Near our feet, I felt the snake slither under the table. A house-elf appeared with the food and we began eating in silence. At 7:30 sharp, the food disappeared. Voldemort leaned back, closed his eyes and let out a sinister sigh.
“That is correct Narcissa,” A low voice hissed. Chills danced down my spine as the air in the room grew cold and stiff. Voldemort slipped into the room, his massive snake at his feet. “And it is to our advantage as well. We are able to remain in the shadows, our movements unnoticed. It is a pity though, that our dear Mr Potter managed to fend off our Dementors.”
“I know, I wish it wasn’t either, but I love you anyways,” He mumbled.  I hummed and kissed him again.  We broke away and moved to sit in our usual spot by the water.
“You too,” I muttered once I knew he was out of earshot.  I left a few minutes later, practically running back to the Common Room before curfew, dreading having to explain to anyone why I was out this late.  I smiled at Pansy as I passed her in the Common Room and went up to my room.  Blaise glared at me as I collapsed on my bed.  I pulled out a box of sweets before closing my curtains, curling up and eating my heart out before promptly falling asleep.
“Harry, I know that, but you have to choose which battles are worth it.”  Harry was practically shaking.
“No,” said Harry, more loudly.  I bit the inside of my cheek harder.  I shouldn’t laugh at this.  He’s my boyfriend but… he’s just so bad at potions.  It’s the first day for Merlin’s sake.  “I forgot the hellebore…”
I zoned out as Dumbledore began speaking again.  This Umbridge woman’s presence here could only mean one thing — the Ministry was attempting to invade Hogwarts.  Hogwarts was already rubbish at teaching most subjects, as my father so informed me of Durmstrang’s “proper education”.  Now, with the Ministry being as ignorant and greedy as ever, I doubt this year bodes well for our education.  Umbridge resembled more that of a pygmy puff than an adult human, let alone one educated enough to teach.
“I’m glad you have faith in me to follow that,”  He laughed.  We stood near the edge for a moment, both of us smiling.
"Really Potter?  I thought we were sharing this flat."  He looked back up to smirk at Harry but ended up smiling at his preposterous expression.
"Yeah, yeah, just, er, just a nightmare."  He took a deep breath before meeting Harry's eyes.  "I'm alright.  It happens.  I'm sorry I woke you."  Draco looked away, feeling his face heat up.  He hated seeming weak, especially in front of Harry.  Despite their budding friendship, he still viewed Harry as Harry Potter, the boy who defeated Voldemort and changed history.  Draco knew that Harry no longer saw him as a Death Eater, and he worked hard to fix his public image — he was truthful at his trial that he only complied to save himself and his family; he did community service as a junior potions master at St. Mungos; he even publicly addressed and apologized for his and his family's actions during the war.  Draco wanted to be a strong man, redeeming the Malfoy name after his father nearly destroyed it.  That man wasn't supposed to have nightmares that woke up the wizarding world's golden boy.
“The other day when you were out.  I got bored so I raided your wardrobe.”  My jaw dropped.  “By the way, these are incredibly comfy.”  She smirked casually.  I rolled my eyes and wrapped my arm around her shoulders.
“Peter Pettigrew.  He tied me to a grave and brought out this massive cauldron and started this potion.  He put this… bloody being in first, then a bone from the grave I was on, then his own hand before slicing my arm to add my blood.”  Harry clutched his right arm, covered by a long-sleeve shirt much too warm for the current weather.  I shuddered as I watched him.  “The potion reacted and now… now…”  He closed his eyes and swallowed hard.
March crept by, melting into April and Easter break.  I stayed at Hogwarts during the break as my father had “business to deal with”.  The letter I received from him was short and overly formal, even for him.  The first time I read it over, I got an aching feeling in my stomach.  He’s only ever that short and formal when it’s about something he doesn’t want me to know about.  He sent a package of sweets as well alongside a brief note from my mother wishing me well.  I read the letter over a couple more times, trying to decipher what “business” he could possibly be dealing with.  Sure, he had an interest in the dark arts and artefacts but he never let it come in the way of holidays.  My mother would always force him to be home for holidays, and as much as he initially grumbled, I’d catch him stealing smiles at my mother, obviously thankful she had made him stay.  This would be the first Easter that I could remember that we wouldn’t all be together.
“You’ve got a point.  You’re not lying?”  I shook my head vigorously.  “You’re not?”  He dropped his arms, and his eyes widened.
"Alright.  Classes start proper tomorrow.  Your things have been moved to your new addresses.  I suggest you settle in tonight."  The trainer left as the trainees began apparating to their respective locations.
“Right of course!”  My mother pulled me into a hug and kissed my cheek.  “Have a good year Draco.  We love you!”  I took Pansy’s hand as we boarded the train before turning to wave to our families.  Soon enough, the platform was no more than a blur with a barking black mass chasing the train before we lost sight of it entirely.
“Pansy, I don’t think today is a good day to do this.”  I kept watching Potter and his other Gryffindor friends.  Granger stormed out of the Great Hall, huffing as she usually does, and Potter was left with his uncomfortable friends, who also left.
“Pansy, would you just leave it for now?”  I raised my voice, trying to start a ‘fight’.  She pursed her lips and crossed her arms.
I’d go home each night after our meetings cursing myself for my cowardness, Pansy giving me a pitiful gaze as I moped by.
“Woah woah woah!”  He raised his hands.  “Give me three seconds to process this information?”  He took a long deep breath. “You, Draco Malfoy, like… me?”  I nodded.  “As in romantically?”  I nodded slower, looking away.  “Okay. How long?”
“What— where— oi! Slow down!”  I look back to see Harry a few yards back, still trying to find the vines.  I shook my head and walked back to him.
“Thanks, Malfoy.”  He stared at me for a moment and I tried to smile.  I guess I didn’t do it too well because he quickly walked away, his head down again.
“I might be able to steal you away for a few minutes afterwards.”  I gently took his hands from his tie and pulled him a bit closer again, our faces inches apart now.  ”If you don’t mind being caught by a Prefect after hours.”  A small smirk graced Harry’s lips and his signature mischievous glint returned to his eyes.
“No!  It wasn’t him!  It can’t be!”  My hands were shaking furiously and my voice on the verge of breaking.
“Want one, Granger?”  I held out a badge to Hermione.  “I’ve got loads.  But don’t touch my hand, now.  I’ve just washed it, you see; don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up.”  I saw the anger peak in Harry’s eyes.  He reached for his wand, causing pretty much everyone in a ten-foot radius to stop laughing and step back, some even scrambling into classrooms or other halls.
"Stay?"  Draco murmured as Harry reached the door.  His face flushed as he vaguely remembered muttering something along the same lines to Draco a few weeks prior in his own drunken stupor.  He turned back around and sat on the bed.
“I’m with you.  Of course I’m okay,” Draco murmured back.  Harry chuckled and opened the door.  Harry led them over to his bed, gently sitting on the edge.  As their lips met again, Harry’s hands slipped up Draco’s shirt again.  He lightly ran his fingertips over Draco’s lithe frame, over his hips, then each rib.  Draco gasped softly at how delicate Harry’s calloused fingers felt against his warm skin.  Harry took the chance to pull away and tug the hem of Draco’s shirt.
I hoped that he would have the same idea as I did and I could pull him into a broom closet like I did before his first task.  I let out a quiet huff.
“Well regardless, I’m proud of you.  You saved a little girl.”  He smiled again and I pulled him into a soft kiss.  I could feel him smiling against my lips as I pulled his body closer to mine.  We stayed for a moment, letting the gentle breeze wash over us, our bodies flush together.  He smelled fresh and sweet, cucumbers mixed with the chilled scents of the surrounding forest and field.  I pulled away gently and rested my forehead against his.  He places his hand on my jaw and sweeps his thumb against my cheek.  “So what exactly was the quest?”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked quickly.  Draco chuckled and pushed him slightly further back so that Harry was standing next to the bed.
“Watch where you’re going—”  I spat, straightening my robes, then looked down at the boy in front of me.  “Potter?”
The rest of the day went by unceremoniously, Transfiguration following Care of Magical Creatures.  Pansy decided we should eat early before our Prefect rounds that night.  The Great Hall was fairly empty right after class, allowing Pansy and I to talk almost freely.
“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up.  I gave Harry one last smirk and a wink before leaving with Pansy.  Hermione slammed the compartment door behind us.
“You.”  He shoved a finger in my face.  “You know I like Pansy!”  He chuckled slightly, still glaring at me.  “Hell, I might as well be in love with her!”  I rolled my eyes as he turned away.
“We better get back to the Great Hall.  Otherwise, people are going to start thinking!” She winked and wrapped her arms around my right arm, lacing her fingers through mine.  I laughed and we walked back to the Great Hall.  We had an ongoing game, making people think we were an on-off couple, breaking up over nothing and back together again in a day or so.  Everyone knew better than to ask either of us out.  Pansy didn't want a boyfriend, really.  She just wanted to go to school to learn, and I have the Potter Problem.  Being as attractive as we were, we had people lining up to go out with us.  Honestly, we were more like siblings than a couple.  But we kept the act up.  Plus it pleased our parents that we had an interest in each other, setting up a promising future.  We walked back to the Great Hall as people started to disperse from it.
As Pansy and I shuffled the First Years away to Professor Grubbly-Plank, who stood in Hagrid's place this year, I caught Hermione’s eye.  She gave a small, forced smile before turning back to help Weasel round-up First Years.  They ran off early and met up with the others from their compartment.  Pansy and I caught one of the last carriages, arriving at the castle just before the boats of First Years.
“Hi Pansy,” I laughed.  She pulled away and caught a glance of my Prefect pin.  “You’re a Prefect too?  Why didn’t you tell me!  I haven’t heard from you all summer!”  I opened my mouth to reply before my father cut me off.
"Potter!  Potter!"  Draco called out and tried to shake him awake.  Harry woke up the moment Draco's hand touched his shoulder and instinctively threw a punch in his general direction.  "Fuck!"  Draco yelped, stumbling back and holding his jaw.
”  Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from her.  “It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”
“What?” Harry spat before I could even open my mouth.  He was wedged between Weasel and Weaselette, across from Longbottom, Hermione and a fourth-year Ravenclaw reading an odd magazine upside down.
However, our carefree time was cut short by the returning of students and we returned to our natural state — public avoidance and stealing away every chance we could, much to the despair of Hermione.  She thought we should spend more time studying but I could see her smile at the way Harry’s face lit up when he’d leave the library.
"VKs?" Draco leaned into Harry this time. He noticed the other boys talking and laughing next to them but didn't care enough to tune in. He was more focused on the closeness of Harry's body, the heat and energy radiating off of him, the feeling he caused in Draco's stomach, his brilliant smile in the flashing lights. Harry tried to focus on anything other than their proximity. The last time Harry remembered being this close to Draco was when he clung to him on the back of a broom, escaping the burning Room of Requirement. He liked to chalk up his heart rate and butterflies to almost dying, but at that point, nearly dying was just another Tuesday. Draco clinging to him was not, however.
“Draco,”  Pansy stopped playing with my hair and I opened my eyes.  “You can’t go through the whole relationship living in fear.”
“I will be at the Ministry that day. I think I may have to run into him.” I could hear the signature Malfoy smirk on his face.
“What?”  I took a step back.  It all still seemed just a bit too good to be true.  He stopped and looked away for a moment.
“It’s great, Crabbe. My father is ecstatic no doubt. I’m proud to be his son,” I grumbled out. Blaise arched an eyebrow at me but didn’t say anything. Crabbe and Goyle resumed their conversation between themselves. I tuned them out for the rest of the ride, feigning sleep until we returned to King’s Cross.
I just kept circling around a few corridors until I walked straight into someone else with their head down.  He fell backwards and his glass tumbled off his face, smashing next to him.  I stumbled backwards, tripping over my robes.
“You two think you’re all secretive, sneaking around the grounds like you do,” The Fat Lady grumbled as I started away.
“What?”  I scoffed, throwing my sweater into a basket.  “Did a snitch crawl up your ass?”  He turned and pointed at me.
“I bet they were there,” Goyle muttered in return.  “Yours too Draco.”  I felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in my stomach.
“Potter!”  I called out, thankful the hall was empty.  He turned around, pissed then slowly smiling.
As Easter break ended, the halls filled again and we were all quickly swept away with school work again.  Spring washed onto the grounds, flowers springing up in unlikely places, trees blooming green once again, the sun staying out longer and longer until, by the end of April, we’d meet under blue skies and return under the slight cover of dusk.  I could feel myself lowering my guard every day that Harry and I spent together.  Every day I felt like I was closer to saying it to him — it felt truer and truer every day.  My spirits felt lighter as April melted into May, and May into June.  Harry, on the other hand, seemed to get tenser as the weeks went on.  I’d ask him almost every day what was wrong but he’d refuse to talk about whatever it was bothering him.  Instead, we’d talk about the horrible Charms essay we had due the next week, Professor Sprout’s ridiculous lectures, and have short arguments over Snape’s distribution of points which would end in laughing, possible wrestling and definitely kissing.  I tried my best to keep his mind off the tournament and whatever it was that was bothering him but I could see the way him, Hermione and Weasel would whisper in the hallways.  Something was going on between all three of them but I couldn’t place my finger on what.  I hoped it was just the tournament and their worries about Harry, but something told me it was something more.
“Narcissa,” My father cut in, laying a hand on my mother’s shoulder.  “As much as I’m sure they would love to continue talking with us, they do have a train to catch.”  The train let out a high pitched whistle, causing many students to begin rushing forwards.
he mentally grumbled before looking at Draco.  The morning sunlight gave him a golden glow his skin normally lacked.  His freckles stood out more in the sweet light and made his hair practically glow golden against the ruby red pillowcase.  He looked like a perfect white-gold statue.
“And today is the last morning you’ll wake up refreshed if I know you at all.”  Pansy smiled and nodded.
"Just, knock or wake me up,"  He paused, gazing into Draco's eyes.  He never noticed the flecks of blue that danced around the pupil.  "Draco."  He added softly.  Draco smiled and turned to walk away, feeling Harry's fingers slip off his wrist and brush past his own fingers.
"Better with this old baby in my hands!"  He yelled without a mic.  Harry shook his head at his friend's antics.  He loved these boys.  He still loved his friends from Hogwarts of course, but there was something about making a name for himself with a handful of like-minded people, starting as a nobody with nothing in a place no one knows your name.  He kept in touch but didn't let anyone know what he was really up to.  Listening to his friends' banter on stage around him lit a fire in his soul.  He was absolutely beaming on the stage, and Draco nearly lost his breath from that dazzling smile.
At 6:45, I quickly fixed myself in the mirror before quietly making my way downstairs. I found my mother in the drawing-room, staring into the fire with a piece of embroidery in her lap. She looked up when I walked in and smiled.
"That's the fun of chippys,"  Harry took the fork out of the top of the box and dove in.  "You eat it while walking."  Draco watched, scowling still, but slowly followed suit.
"I didn't even know if you were into blokes. I didn't want to ruin our relationship. Then we'd have to go to the Ministry and apply for new partners, and one of us would've had to move out. Merlin, imagine the custody battle over Mittens! It would be horrendous!" Harry exclaimed dramatically. Draco held back his laughter at Harry's theatrics.
“I’m sorry love,” She whispered in the hall, levitating my trunk behind me. “Your father has no choice now. Please, just be smart.” I nodded. We walked up the stairs together in silence. The house was cold and dark, unlike how it used to be. Despite my father’s interest in the Dark Arts and public appearance, he was a warm man to my mother and I. The house, despite the size, was always warm and well lit with candles. My mother always made a point of eating breakfast and dinner together as a family. She was one of the only people who could make my father smile. I was the second. He adored teaching me to fly when I was young and was thrilled when I began showing an interest in the Dark Arts, despite my interest being more in defensive manoeuvres rather than the offensive. Regardless, he was delighted to spend time with my mother and me during breaks.
As the chorus began again, Harry leaned forward over the most crowded spot on the barricade, his eyes catching on those sharp features again, and he knew — Draco Malfoy was standing in the audience. His stomach dropped to the floor as he tore his eyes away. As much as he had fantasised about Draco showing up in the audience one night, he thought it would be only that — a fantasy. Malfoys don't go to Muggle venues to see Muggle bands with a suspiciously magical name. Malfoys certainly don't dye their hair pastel rainbow and show up at pride events and end up seeing said Muggle band with a suspiciously magical name. Focus on the music, Harry. He tried to ground himself as he kept singing. As the chorus finished, Jasper stepped up to play his riff, and Harry stepped back to grab a water. He turned his back to the audience, bobbing along with Mason in an attempt to shake out his nerves.
