“Well… I will give you ONE strong suppressant. One bottle, Potter. For use ONLY in an emergency. You do understand what constitutes an emergency, yes?” Pomfrey lifted one severely arched brow at him, and Harry gulped.
“That’s not good for you Harry!” Hermione chastised him, ignoring the way Ron tugged her hand to get her to sit again. “You could mess up your internal chemistry, or damage your magic, or-”
“Fuck… Don’t do that.” He said, fingers tightening on Harry’s thighs. Harry resisted the urge to press his face to the exposed column of Malfoy’s throat. He was definitely feeling drowsy from the sex.
"If you won't take suppressants, and I have no idea when the next heat might come… this will probably happen again." Harry warned. Malfoy gave him a look of mild annoyance.
"Ginny mentioned that you went by Malfoy's this weekend." She said, a bit TOO casually.
The first potion took effect, sending a wave of relief through him like warm water. The cold water on his face washed away the sleep and sweat, and woke him up the rest of the way.
another way to stop my heats from being out of control.” Harry murmured in an undertone as they sat at their usual table at the back of the library, minus Malfoy who was still conspicuously absent. Ron’s eyes brightened, and Hermione gave a small, hopeful smile. “I could get pregnant.”
“No, I just don’t understand.” Harry denied. “Maybe Dumbledore and Pomfrey didn’t explain it right… Or maybe… I wasn’t… paying attention.”
his room was across the hall. He forced his feet to move, eyes darting to his door, to safety, and privacy, and-
“I like blokes, too.” He said with a shrug, trying for nonchalant. Ron’s eyes widened, and he glanced at Hermione who just smiled, and spoke without missing a beat.
“Well, that just warms the heart.” He did his best to ignore the mocking drawl, but the blond head ducked into his field of view, getting a better look at the infant.
"And… they can all smell me? They'll all know?" He thought of how Malfoy had stopped dead in the hallway, eyes locked on his. He'd likely smelled him from down the hall. Harry pushed that though FAR away.
"Don't wake the baby." Harry breathed, as wide, startled grey eyes found his. Malfoy's expression changed to outraged confusion. "We need to talk." Harry said, and nodded toward the door, taking a moment to stare down at the perfect pink baby swaddled and pillowed in pure white silk, before he joined Malfoy in the hall and let the door close.
“Well, unfortunately, there’s nothing that can be fixed. My diagnosis is that having been dependent on suppressant potions, now that you’re off of them, your natural heat cycle has become unstable. It should sort itself out in a month or two, and get back on track. Until then, I suggest you either take time off of classes, or keep an Alpha on call. Don’t look at me like that Mr. Potter, I know very well how your last two heats ended so abruptly. Don’t act as though I’m suggesting something distasteful when you can’t deny it works. Being an Eighth year, of course, gives you certain privileges. If you need to have someone come to you, I’m sure that can be arranged. If you’d like recommendations-”
"Potter."
“Thank Merlin.” Ron grumbled, waving a hand through the air as if to clear it. Harry swallowed the lump in his throat and told himself he did NOT want to follow after Malfoy.
He ignored Malfoy whenever they had to sit together, refused to look at him, and tried his damndest to hold his own pheromones back, to not accidentally bomb poor Ron just because Malfoy is sitting there, irritating the hell out of him.
By dinnertime, Harry felt nearly dead on his feet, and already ready for bed. He quickly changed into his new school robes, and followed his friends down to the Great Hall. The hall was empty when they arrived, the first group of students still disembarking from the train down in Hogsmeade. They took their seats, and chatted in hushed, almost reverent whispers as they waited.
“Ginny?” He found her easily, and she, followed by what seemed to be the whole room, congratulated him as she suctioned herself to his side, and he started through the crowd. He was slowly headed to the bar. He needed a VERY stiff drink. It seemed like some horrible carousel of people wanting his attention, spewing pleasantries, and clapping him on the shoulder. He did love his friends. He enjoyed spending time with them all. But today was not a good day…
“Oh. I always forget. You don’t know
"You think I SHOULD cheat on Ginny?" Harry asked, appalled.
“I… Really smell like him?” Harry sniffed himself. With Luna’s words in his head, Malfoy’s scent DID remind him of cinnamon. But it was faint, even with his nose pressed to his own shoulder.
. Because Malfoy was back on top of him, pressing Harry’s thighs to his chest, sliding back into him for so long it seemed an eternity, and then he was moving, sending sparkling pleasure and heat racing through Harry’s veins. It was everything he’d wanted. It was more than he’d even
The hall went silent as the first years entered, and Harry finally felt his lips stretching into another genuine smile as the terrified tiny figures marched to the front of the Hall. A few eyes caught on him and widened, but they were swept away with the crowd before they could properly gawk.
. It made the swollen knot of his sex quiver and sent shockwaves of sensation up Harry’s spine.
off as possible.” Harry mumbled. Draco gave him a dirty look.
made him feel more violated than if it had been a complete stranger.
“An Alpha’s rut is like an Omega’s heat only in the loosest of senses, Potter. It’s not the same. An Omega’s heat, untreated, lasts for a week, and happens once a month…. Barring your strange circumstances, I suppose. While it’s… a bit of an impairment, you’re still able to go about your day, take classes, do your best to avoid Alphas…. An Alpha in rut gets rough. It lasts for only a couple days, and it turns us into mindless beasts. The desire to bite you, to
“I’m trying to control them… I’m getting better.” Harry announced, and then, “And I can’t hide in the infirmary everytime I go into heat, I’d likely end up hiding half the year, waiting for one heat after another…. But-”
"Because THEY haven't been avoiding it." Hermione cut in, sounding ready for a lecture. Harry looked at her, unable to smell her the way he could Ron.
He opened the window, cast air freshening charms and showered for far longer than he usually did. When he was dressed, and went down to breakfast, he could barely smell Malfoy’s scent on his skin at all.
“Alright…” Ginny gave him a small smile, and Malfoy a tight-lipped one. She wasn’t positive they wouldn’t fight, but she didn’t want to make a scene. Harry smirked to himself as he finally had his back to the whole room. Sometimes, being so familiar with someone made it easy to say the right thing to diffuse a potential disaster.
“Ron, do you think you could teach me how to get a grip on this pheromone thing?” He asked, and Ron grinned.
“Just the one. One, every day, until the heat passes. Usually it only takes about a week, but… It’s been almost two.” Harry tried to keep the worry from his voice, as Pomfrey’s eyes got wider the longer he spoke.
“I hadn’t taken my calming potions yet that morning.” He huffed, and Draco chuckled.
But still, when he walked through the Ministry corridors, he felt as if his face was made of cardboard. A fake, half-smile rationed out to every coworker, but he couldn’t force the expression onto his face when his work took him to the courtrooms. They always brought up memories. It was, afterall, where it had all started going downhill.
“Don’t stop. Don’t stop!” Harry begged, squeezing his legs around Malfoy’s thighs, urging him on. Malfoy smirked down at him and strong hands grabbed him, lifted him, and then Harry felt a rather short rush of fear as he realized he was being carried. Another door slammed open, and Harry was tossed on his own bed. He had no time at all to feel anger at being tossed, indignation at being carried, or infuriated that Malfoy had
He stared at Malfoy's face, tasting the air, and mulling over what Pomfrey had suggested. Malfoy, despite their differences,
“It’s only been a week! That’s three times in five weeks! It’s supposed to only be once a month!” Harry protested while sitting on a bed being looked over by Madam Pomfrey. She did her usual checks, and then stood back, hands on her hips.
“So? Why does everyone go on about how everyone else smells? Is it… rude to smell too much, or something?” Harry asked, thinking of Ron’s reaction, Malfoy’s. The wall of scent that had hit him when Malfoy had spotted him. He pushed THAT thought back.
He got ready for class and walked down to breakfast with his head held high, pretending to himself that he hadn’t just spent half the night shagging Draco Malfoy, pretending that he couldn’t still smell traces of him on his own skin well after he’d showered, and pretending most firmly that he was not an Omega freshly out of a heat.
He left the house, and apparated to the pub, barely noticing that it had started to drizzle. He came in from the back to an unusually full bar. It seemed to grow louder as he entered, and it took his ears a moment to register the cheer that went up.
“Though, none of them noticed you fucking me, so...” He shrugged, and walked off, his face carefully showing a haughty disinterest in the gathering. Harry felt rage in his belly. How DARE Malfoy say that, out loud, surrounded by Harry’s family, and closest friends? What if someone had heard him? He swallowed his drink in one gulp, set the glass down, and followed after the blond, determined to set some boundaries.
It was too hot in his room. He couldn’t sleep. Masturbating, he couldn’t even finish. He wanted to peel his skin off, just so it would stop sweating. He’d even visited Pomfrey and she had outright refused to let him suppress it. Her suggestion had been to sleep with an Alpha, and get it over with sooner. Harry thought of Malfoy, and also refused immediately. So he was left to burn to death in his bedroom, trying not to go stir crazy from the urge to touch himself, even though he knew it wouldn’t help.
"Binky." Malfoy said, confusing Harry for a moment, and startling him as a house elf stepped forward, huge eyes staring up at Malfoy eagerly. "I have business. Feed Scorpius if he wakes up. Come get me if there are any problems, don't worry about interrupting, and don't bother knocking." Malfoy ordered, waiting just long enough for the elf to nod, and disappear inside the room, before he led the way down the hall. Harry was surprised when they stopped at the study, one door down from the bedroom. He’d been inside once or twice, but never for long. As Malfoy took a seat behind the large, carved desk, he found himself appreciating the gesture of formality. It showed that he was trying to respect Harry's decision to stay faithful to his wife.
“She’s dead. And yes, she knew. I told her about a year ago.” Malfoy said, leaving Harry reeling with shock. Whatever he’d been expecting, it hadn’t been that.
deep, Harry came again, seeing stars as his muscles clenched around Malfoy, his whole body shivering and throbbing with the pulse of Malfoy’s climax.
, Ron.” Hermione’s voice answered from the door, and both boys turned rather guiltily to see her standing with her arms crossed.
"I think I'm in love with you." The words were out of his mouth before he'd even thought about saying them aloud. It was too late to take them back, though, and he watched as Malfoy's anger seemed to grow, his words only acting as fuel on a fire of indignation and resentment.
Malfoy had walked up behind him, and took the chair next to him, giving Hermione a nod of greeting before he began pulling out his Charms book, wand, and a long roll of parchment. Harry couldn’t believe he’d forgotten about their group project and having to sit at a table with Malfoy. He groaned silently to himself, and pulled out his own materials. Ron made a face, screwing it up in something resembling disgust, and Harry was glad for his decision to hide Malfoy's and his arrangement from his friends. He glanced over at the blond, and as usual, Malfoy seemed to be ignoring him. He felt a mix of relief and disappointment. Hermione began leading them through the four-person casting, and Harry did his best to pay attention, and keep his eyes off of Malfoy, whose gentle scent of his pheromones was almost mouthwatering in the subtle waves it came in. He wasn’t some sex-addict. He could focus on school, even with the worst possible distraction sitting next to him, smelling like relaxed confidence and cinnamon.
! Pay attention!” Hermione chastised, for the fourth time in as many minutes. Harry shook his head and forced his eyes back up, doing his best to listen to Hermione’s words through the haze that was making it difficult to think. Malfoy was seated right across from him, and he was definitely angry. Harry could
“Hm.” Harry mused, letting Scorpius wrap his tiny fist around his index finger.
“Well, they give you a mattress and a bucket to piss in, then?” He asked crudely, knowing the language would wind Hermione up, and make Ron laugh. It did both, and Ron led the way into his own room before Hermione could start on a rant. Harry followed gladly, listening to Ron’s eager enthusiastic tour of the small space that was his own. There was a Chudley Cannons poster already hanging on the wall, and a pair of large squashy looking chairs by the fire. Harry looked around the room with curiosity, comparing it to his own, and voicing aloud his thoughts.
“Oh. That. Yeah, it’s got to do with everyone’s compatibility. I only like girls, so, only girl Omegas who are interested in blokes will smell… like that to me.” Ron said.
mark, too. Scent-marking is even more temporary, soaking someone in your pheromones until it’s in their pores, usually during sex. You can have sex without releasing a bunch of pheromones, and you can also just spend a ton of time with someone, steeping in their pheromones without having sex, so someone being scent-marked isn’t
When the door shut, he took a tentative breath and found Malfoy’s pheromones stronger than they’d been the past two weeks, but nowhere near the usual crush they were during his past heats. The cinnamon scent tingled in his nose and made him lick his lips. He wanted to taste Malfoy’s skin, and see if he
Harry mechanically did his Monday paperwork, and went for his noon lunch. He was eager for the afternoon. It all seemed to go faster after lunch. Then he could go home. And… and when he thought about it, he wasn’t sure why he was in such a hurry to get home. Nothing terribly exciting would happen. But it was a goal, and he could achieve it.
“Oh. That.” Malfoy’s voice was flat, and he looked at Harry, eyes full of worry and contemplation. “That’s… normal. Your previous heats have actually been really short. It was probably an effect of your taking the suppressants. You climbing me three times last night was probably an indicator that things are getting back to normal inside you.”
“Well! Not that either of YOU will care, but I’ve just been reading…”
“Sure. Not gonna shower at all. I’ll just go around school with your come dried all over me, and let
him. Speaking to him, and meeting his eyes. Harry found it easy to speak to him like this. Strangely easy. Terrifyingly easy. Malfoy looked at him with incredulity.
“Well… It’s difficult to simply explain. It’s something most Alphas and Omegas just… learn as they develop. But I don’t like the idea of you wandering around with NO idea of what’s in store…” Hermione bit her lip, and her eyes darted to Ron, and away. Then back.
“What the hell are you doing? You should probably rest a little longer. I wasn’t very gentle.” Draco was leaning against the doorframe, arms crossed, and completely naked. Harry felt his cheeks darken at the memories of the previous night. After he’d gotten turned on again, they’d gone for two more rounds, each longer and more rough than the last. Harry’s eyes slid past the bruises and scars, right to his half-erect shaft. He wasn’t fully hard, but it promised to be ready if Harry wanted to keep going.
“My word!” Pomfrey lurched to her feet, startled by the sudden intrusion, and her eyes scanned him as she rounded her desk. “Potter. Whatever is the matter?” She waved her wand, shutting the door behind him as he met her halfway down the empty row of beds.
“No, I don’t think so. It’s not… not like dominance, as you might see it, forcing people to do things, it’s more to do with dominant genetics. ‘Dominant’ does not mean you like to bend others to your will, it just means that your pheromones are… more potent to those around you.”
He eventually found himself sitting near Rose’s small trolly, watching over her while the rest of the Weasleys mingled. He didn’t mind in the least, and he let the baby chew on his knuckle and watched her return his smiles as he spoke to her.
“Yes. Half a month early, due to Astoria’s health. She died shortly after, so at least she got to meet him.” Malfoy shrugged it off, but his face held a remorse that Harry knew would have been matched on his face had the same happened to Ginny.
He’d been in the courtrooms, after the war, testifying on behalf of the Malfoys, explaining how Narcissa had lied to keep him alive, and the Malfoys had all switched sides…. He hadn’t even realized Malfoy was there, until he’d been exiting the courtroom…
“Guys, what’s wrong? You’ve been acting off all day” Harry finally demanded of his friends as they walked up the stairs after dinner. Ron had been tight-lipped and curt all day, Hermione had been quiet, but kept casting him and Ron glances, as if waiting for a fight to break out. It was putting Harry on edge, and the fact that Malfoy had disappeared halfway through the day only made him more nervous. He knew the reason, but couldn’t help feeling something had gone wrong. That something
He heard the cooing before they entered the room, and he walked into the sight of Draco with a baby on his lap, hands holding feet, playing gently with the tiny form. Harry felt his heart squeeze painfully at the sight, and Draco looked up with a warm smile still lingering on his face that made the heartache that much worse for Harry.
“I reckon we could gather a few people who’re interested in a few friendly bouts.” Ron suggested, and Harry grinned. He could almost taste the breeze and feel the sun on his face.
As soon as classes were out, Harry hurried back to his room and tried to shower the scent of Malfoy off of himself. He scrubbed his skin until it was red and raw, washed his hair twice, and stood under scalding water for far longer than normal. When he finally felt as though he couldn't possibly stay in the shower longer, he finally got out and toweled himself dry. A good tooth scrubbing, a fresh uniform, and he felt almost as clean as he had that morning. Definitely less sweaty.
To his surprise, Draco slid over him, onto the bed, dragging Harry with him. A quick flick of his wrist covered them both with a cool sheet, and Harry felt the comforting scent of belonging seep into him, and relax his muscles. He pushed at Malfoy, trying to free himself, but Malfoy only shifted, lying on his back and pulled Harry into his side, arms wrapped around his body, keeping him trapped.
Hermione stepped forward and put a hand on his arm. Harry was almost jealous of the way Ron deflated a bit at the touch, turning to Hermione, taking comfort from her soothing gesture. She wasn’t an Omega, but she seemed to feel the same need to calm him down. Harry gave her an appreciative smile as she encouraged Ron to sit.
“Alright. Off you go, Potter. Come back if… if you need anything.” She offered, but he knew there was nothing she could actually do to help him. He was just going to have to burn alive.
go wrong.
“Well, I think it’s very brave of you, Harry. A very logical decision, when you must be having a terrible time trying to figure everything out.” She commended him. Harry didn’t argue that he felt more desperate and horny than brave or logical. “And is it
When he looked back at his wife, she had tears sparkling in her eyes, and an upset flush on her cheeks. Her jaw was set, and she stood, glaring down at him. He braced himself, ready for shouting, or being hexed.
"Harry, are you feeling alright?" Hermione asked softly. Harry jolted, and shook his head to clear it of the sticky cobwebs.
“Why? Irritating you, am I?”
“Accident!? You’ve been
“Go to bed, Harry. He’ll be fine.” Ron said, sounding suddenly tired, and worried. Harry nodded, feeling strange, light-headed. He disappeared into his own room, and hid in his bed, forcing his eyes to stay closed and his limbs to remain still, even though he didn’t fall asleep for hours.
He took comfort in the fact that while he was missing the train ride and the carriages up the path, at least there would still be a feast waiting for them later.
“No… My… Heat potions.” He said, looking away, at the windows, the ceiling, anywhere but at the aging woman.
at him since the other night. Hadn’t spoken a single word to him yet all term that hadn’t involved bare skin and frenzied actions.
By the end of their second week, Harry was willing to admit that there was something wrong with his potions. They weren’t working like they should. It had been two weeks, and still, his heat hadn’t ended. He still woke up in the middle of the night feeling both too hot, and too cold, too alone, and far too aroused. His appetite was dwindling, and he found himself picking at his food, unable to stomach any of it.
“What’d she say?” Ron asked without preamble as Harry sank heavily onto the bench next to him.
“All of your rooms will be in the southern hall of the seventh floor. The entire hall has been warded against underage students. All students with an Alpha or Omega designation will have extra warding on their rooms, as well. You may see Madam Pomfrey, myself, or Professor Flitwick with any concerns.”
“Funny.” He said, and sighed. “I forget that you’re… new to this. I suppose it was all confusing at first. A bit startling at times...” His fingers traced a circle on one of Harry’s thighs as he spoke, reminiscing silently about his own experiences.
him, made him shift nervously in his seat. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know what she saw.
“I can ask, but… You know I can’t take the suppressants.” He shrugged, and Hermione’s lips tightened. Ron nodded, as if just asking was enough. Harry hoped it would be. He couldn’t bear for this to cause a rift between him and Ron, and just then, if it came down to a choice between the two, Harry wasn’t entirely certain he wouldn’t pick Malfoy.
. He pulled away before he could get turned on by it, and bit his lip.
his anger. It was strange, smelling an emotion, and even stranger was Harry’s urge to soothe it. He wanted to touch Malfoy, to ask him what was wrong, to fix whatever it was. Harry desperately wanted to take the emergency potion in his bag. He knew this was not what Madam Pomfrey would label an ‘emergency’, but he felt the creeping sensation that he’d lose his mind if he was forced to sit still with an irritated Malfoy two feet away for much longer.
“You were asleep when I got in.” Harry murmured, squeezing the baby tighter as he sleepily stretched at the sound of his father’s voice.
“So… Why doesn’t everyone just do that?” Harry asked, imagining that a single person’s pheromones would be FAR easier to cope with than the onslaught he usually had to suffer.
Harry slides off the bed, motioning for Draco to stay put. "While you're here, I have something for you - "
The expression on Draco's face closes like shutters being drawn.
the same." Draco breathes, looking away. "It's not the same thing."
"Well, I dunno, do I!" Ron says defensively, his ears red. "All I know is that he's a slippery tosser, who knows what he's thinking!"
"I would tell you that's true but I'm afraid you're hardly making sense."
As usual, sorry if this felt like a bit of a long wait! I've started a new job, I'm thinking of applying for a Master's so it's all a bit chaotic at the moment but I
"Here - use mine."
Harry looks at his friend; he looks at his watery, red-rimmed eyes, at his chewed up lips and realises he had no clue. He had no idea how deeply Ron's terror ran, how much of this went far beyond simply Draco Malfoy.
"Ploddy is certainly enraptured by you." Draco informs Harry, tone purposely light and casual like he's hoping to try and talk over the past flickering between them. "Tell me, is there anybody you can't charm the robes off of?"
"Just let him get on with it then. If he wants to torture himself, he can." Ron points out, twirling his wand around his fingers. "No offence but it's nothing to do with you, mate. You've had enough on your plate to last a lifetime."
"Look, I don't know what to think anymore." Ron says, sniffing thickly. He pulls Hermione's hand towards his chest, running a circle around her palm with his thumb. "After the war, everything got messed up. People were coming out with their stories, saying they were coerced or Imperiused into doing all that stuff for You-Know-Who - just like last time. What if they're just making their excuses until the next chance at world domination."
"Maybe not but you look like you
Draco's height offers him an advantage in their walk. Harry would be hard-pressed to keep up with this insistent stride if not for the skeletal hand on his forearm and dragging him mercilessly down twilight lit corridors to who knows where. Somewhere, Ron is probably having fits over the Marauder's Map at the sight of Harry and Draco venturing farther and farther from the classroom.
"Chocolate Frog." Harry tries hopefully.
Ron groans, slinging an arm around Hermione's waist. "If you mention revision
"No!" Harry says, aghast. "No, not exactly. More like, she didn't understand why I couldn't...let everything go - it was just as hard for her but I - I just - there's something I couldn't shake off. Like, I knew that we'd never really be happy together for long. God, it felt like we were just trying to keep up appearances for the sake of it even though our hearts weren't really in it anymore. This - this isn't coming out right at all, I sound like a right old git."
"You know, Potter, there's going to come a time very soon when you're going to explain what you just said to me in avid detail." Draco says, unable to tear his gaze away from the silvery mist streaming out behind the stag as it begins to fade. He finds himself thinking this Patronus was destined to wander through a forest of stars.
"Okay." Ron says - and that's it. Harry's word is enough for him. "Now who wants some hot chocolate?"
"For fuck's sake, Potter." Draco swears in exasperation, bone-white hands grasping the straps of his bag as if it's the only thing keeping him hinged to control. "I thought I told you to leave me alone."
They are living history. They are breathing the present. They are forging their own future.
"I show up to class, don't I?! Hermione, all I wanted to do was look over your notes to see if I missed anything out in my own. It's hardly cheating, is it?"
Ron slumps forward, his head spilling into his large hands, body trembling in the damp clothes. "Sorry - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. I dunno what I was - it's just hard to keep upbeat, you know? After - after losing Fred and seeing Malfoy just - Fred had his life taken away from him. He doesn't get to carry on like before."
Ginny delicately lifts a shoulder, utterly unashamed. "The hair thing tipped me off pretty early."
Draco rolls his eyes and jostles a shoulder into Harry's, setting off a whole new round of that uninhibited laughter. Really, there was something fundamentally wrong with him. It was far too late for Draco to save himself.
Harry spins on the spot, hands braced against the walls either side of him, the close confines of the spiral stairway seeming to shrink in further when those green eyes pierce Draco's own, all wide and sickeningly concerned. Draco nearly falls backwards just to give himself some breathing room.
"I reckon I know enough, actually." Harry says coolly. "You can feel alone even with a hundred people standing around you."
"Obviously you know this."
deserve it, Draco. My godfather once told me that the world isn't split up into good people and Death Eaters. It took me a while before I realised that that was true. You're more than what you've done, there's more to you than those acts. You're a person who makes mistakes, just like me. I don't blame you for following Voldemort's orders."
"You did that on purpose!" his gasp is thinly veiled amazement, clouds of hot smoking breath chug from his mouth like a steam train. "I'd no idea you Gryffindors had it in you."
Even as he says the words, the doors burst open and Professor Sprout is leading in a crowd of nervous first years. He can't imagine how they must be feeling; they've probably heard countless stories about the battle, of what happened in this very room. To walk into such a hall bearing banners which commemorate lost students and staff, to be confronted by hundreds of watchful faces, to know that something monumental had taken place on the very ground they are walking over must make Hogwarts appear more formidable than it already is on first sight.
"Hermione gave it to me when we broke up for the holidays. There's a note, it's addressed to both of us. She told me not to open it until the 25th but I won't tell her if you won't." Harry explains, tearing at the edge of the outer wrapping to shake out two smaller parcels within. "Here, this one is for you."
"Yes, we're quite the epitome of the happy family, don't you think?"
do I strike you as?"
Draco becomes defensive, bright spots of red colouring his cheeks. "She knows that! It's hard for her to break free though. Believe it or not, there were times in my parents marriage that had a semblance of love. She struggles to reconcile the man he used to be with the man he is now - though my father has always maintained his views on muggles and a pure bloodline. A lesser evil, perhaps, if you can call it that."
I physically can't bring myself to read through this for the hundredth time so I hope it's okay! Lots of love to you all as always!
Wind whistles around them, whipping hair into their eyes. Draco rounds on Potter.
"Well? I presume we're here for more than idle chatter with one another. What are you waiting for? What's the password?"
Harry smiles in spite of the situation, stepping forward so that the dementor retreats toward the trunk, “Riddikulus!”
Draco is gasping, doubled over, his hair falling about his face."I'll try harder next time, I promise."
Also, it feels wrong to post this chapter without addressing a big issue. Joanne has been making it incredibly hard to enjoy Harry Potter these days but I won't repeat any of her views here to spare readers who are on ao3 for a respite. To anyone reading who may have been hurt by the things she has said, please know that you are
Harry can't stay mad at that. He
Harry is in the process of biting the head off his own frog. "Uh - becuzzissyourname?"
But I will try my best! I totally used to do this all the time. Surely it's still in me to do it, right?
"Do you really believe that?"
Harry's breathing is loud to even his own ears. The vice-like grip on his arm finally disappears and Harry staggers away, rubbing furiously at the place where Draco's hand had slowly started to cut off circulation. He flexes his fingers and catches Draco watching him in the act.
"I dunno, Professor Vector must have left these records here. I thought they'd - " Harry stops. He'd thought they would do what, exactly? Help the mood? Break the tension? Ease them into this unfathomable situation they've somehow landed themselves in? He shuts the music off, the quiet loud in his ears, feeling foolish. "Well, forget about it. Where have you been!?"
"I don't mind. I don't want the two of you thinking you have to sneak around behind my back just so you can hold hands without making me uncomfortable." Harry tells them.
"Come off it!" Harry scoffs, glasses slipping slightly down his nose. Draco resists the urge to push them back up. "Besides, I want to hear exactly how much more than
" at him to tease from behind his cauldron, grinning when Hermione catches sight of it and elbows Ron in the ribs. She's starting her lecture about the requirements of proper and respectful focus during brewing and the stories of countless wizards and witches who have injured themselves from goofing around over potions, and he's grateful to be slipping out of the classroom for a reprieve.
As he walks with Hermione down the length of the aisle to reach the empty space on the bench opposite Ron, Harry notices a familiar blonde head determinedly frowning down at his plate. Malfoy. One of the only faces not fighting for acknowledgement from him. He seems intent on remaining ignored, the significant space around him at the Slytherin table suggesting his isolation is preferred both by himself and his peers.
"Told you he'd forget." Ron mumbles to Hermione. "We wanted to talk the other day? When you went running off after Malfoy again, remember?" Ron asks, lightly rapping his knuckles against Harry's head.
Harry's face catches on fire. "Oh god. I was flirting with Draco."
"Fucking
Draco jolts, lifting his eyes from the still rattling trunk. His hairline is itching from perspiration and he's thoroughly annoyed that Harry always looks at him like he's someone to be pitied. "Oh, fuck off. Spare me of that rubbish, Potter."
Harry waits a beat too long, until there's no one left to hear his stunned laugh. Draco has become a ghost once more.
Draco is trying to appear collected. He moves to the edge with shaky legs, leaning heavily against the railing so that he can peer down into the darkness below. It's hard to imagine the boy he was on that night where everything came together in the worst possible way. Hard to shake off the memory of Albus Dumbledore softly talking to him, words carried along on a breeze, gentle and calm as if a frenzied Draco hadn't been pointing a trembling wand at him.
"We could chuck some of Hagrid's mince pies? It might shed some weight and you'd stop sinking into the snow." Harry suggests instead, opting to wait for Ron to free his buried legs from an unexpected dip in the ground before adding the burden of his news to Ron's weary shoulders.
"Bloody hell, let's hurry up and get back to the castle." Ron is complaining, squinting in the bright light while trying to help Hermione up the snowy bank. He has two maroon scarves wrapped around his face, the slither of his exposed forehead a bright pink. "I can't see a thing out here!"
"First time I saw that Patronus, I thought my dad had cast it."
as vibrant in her as it has always been. The tightness around her eyes softens when Harry appeals to her, his voice quieter than a whisper. "Are you mad at me?"
itself had not been forgotten. It had been used as a bargaining chip for his only son and they had gotten away with it.
“Harry, make sure you stop by the Leaky Cauldron after work. Neville owled that he has something for you.” Ginny called through the kitchen as Harry hurried to button his Auror’s robes. He was running late, as usual, and was already in a poor mood, from his bad dreams.
"I don't think Ginny will ask, but if she does, you can tell her where to find me. Don't bother lying for me, Hermione. I'm sick of the dishonesty in my marriage."
“Oh yes, I imagine so. Your pheromones mixed together like that smell rather nice, actually. Like cinnamon candy apples.” She said, taking a deep breath, smiling as she savored it. Harry felt his face go red.
It would explain the way he was suddenly getting heavy-lidded stares thrown his way, and to his horror, Micahel Corner of all people asking him on a date. He’d declined as politely as he could, and tried not to smell Ginny’s scent on him. She smelled similar to Ron, and to Harry’s horror, it was nearly as appealing as Malfoy’s had been. Michael’s scent, mixed with hers, had set him on edge. He knew they were sleeping together in an instant, and rather wondered if Ginny knew he’d asked Harry out. Michael smelled like citrus and body odor, and Harry wondered why on EARTH he had even approached him. Harry could tell by his scent that he wasn’t interested in men. Zacharias Smith, on the other had, kept giving him strange looks. And Harry dreaded being asked out by
Harry ignored the trail of sweat that dripped down his back, telling himself it was the sun as they walked back in from Herbology. The greenhouses HAD been rather warm, afterall. He ignored how fast his pulse felt, telling himself it was the walk. It WAS uphill, wasn’t it? Harry refused to acknowledge the way every scent around him was more potent, especially that of the Alphas. Ron was walking ahead of him, keeping a brisk pace, and Harry could taste his pheromones trailing behind like a cape. Hermione was at Harry’s side, and Harry could even smell her, now. She smelled like soap, dirt from their lesson, and Ron. He’d never noticed before, since they were always together, but he could
"Alright. Harry… um… I'm not telling you to commit adultery, but… don't feel too guilty if you do." Hermione said, looking at him with an almost sad expression that he inspected for a moment. He nodded, and left her house, feeling a surprising stab of pain at what that look had meant.
"Is everything alright? What did Madam Pomfrey say?" Hermione asked. Harry looked over, and past her, Ron was staring at him with an expression of confused concern, his chest expanding as his nostrils flared, taking in the scents Harry had brought with him. Harry felt his face blanch, and tried to cover his tracks.
"Fine, I'm in love with you! I've BEEN in love with you,  I've just been too stupid to realize, or admit it, or whatever! The point is, you can't leave again. You can't just take Scorpius, and vanish to another country, because I swear to god, Malfoy, I WILL come after you. I'm sick of my fake marriage, and I'm sick of missing you, and I'm sick of this stupid, boring life without you in it. I can't live without you. Please don't ask me to." Harry begged, realizing that he sounded hopelessly desperate. If he was Malfoy, he would be disgusted by the sound, but the grey eyes that met his weren't full of disgust. He seemed to be considering the words, and Harry watched his face twitch through different reactions. Finally, it settled into a wary sneer.
The familiar spicy scent sent a shiver up his spine, and his thoughts glazed a little further. He wasn’t sure if the scent was coming from his own skin, or elsewhere in the castle, but it was getting stronger.
“Not jealous. Possessive. Alphas do not like to share. Hearing you talk about jumping into bed with someone else… it makes me want to mark you.” Malfoy muttered. Harry looked at him with confusion. He recalled some fuzzy memory about that word, but didn’t know why Malfoy said it like it was taboo.
"Well, whatever you were or weren't calling it, I know you were… close… for a while. I can't say I understood it, but… you did seem happy with him. I was honestly surprised when you and Ginny announced your engagement, but you seemed so SURE when I asked you about it, that it was what you wanted… so I didn't press further, but now… after seeing the way you were at the pub… I think maybe I should have…" Harry couldn't stand the way she looked so sad. Her life was perfect, she'd gotten everything she wanted. It wasn't her responsibility to make sure his life was just as perfect. It was an impossible task, anyway, and would only leave her as unhappy as him. Harry tried to push the melancholy thoughts away, and focused on one thing that was puzzling him.
He didn’t hear Malfoy leave, but when he was done scrubbing himself raw and swallowing potion, and peeked into his bedroom, there was no sign of the blond except sheets still scattered across the floor where he’d fallen. Harry took a deep, calming breath, and found the air in his room had been thoroughly tainted by that awful burning scent. He threw his window open wide, and still in his towel, hunted down his wand to cast air-freshening charms. He refused to admit how much better he felt. Sore, as if they’d scrapped rather than had sex, but he was obviously no longer in heat. He marvelled at that a moment, and checked himself over in the mirror with a frown, making sure Malfoy hadn’t left any visible evidence of their surprise coupling behind.
He arrived at Ron and Hermione’s home not even five minutes after the clock had told him to head home, and knocked as he entered.
The hardest part of the move was that naturally, as he rolled, his mind would expect to end on his back, as if he hadn’t apparated. But with the magic that transported them, when he focused, and ignored the vertigo of the short roll, he could arrive with any orientation he liked. So as the brief squeeze of magic ended, he felt as if gravity had reversed, his body expecting to be on its back, instead finding itself upright once more, and kneeling on a soft, plush bed, with a rather dazed looking blond beneath him. Draco shook his head, clearly feeling the same strange sense of altered physics. Harry grinned down at his confounded expression, and tossed his wand easily to the familiar ornate bedside table. It seemed nothing in the Manor had really changed since he’d last been here, which suited him just fine.
"Well, I saw how happy you were, and I didn't want to scare you into giving that up. When you got married to Ginny, I just figured it didn't matter, but… I've seen how you're getting. I was going to suggest you see someone, a marriage counselor,  but… I don't think that’s what you need." She spoke softly, but her words felt like a slap to his face. He couldn't believe what she was saying.
it. Pomfrey had been right. An Alpha worked miracles to end his heat. It was easier if he thought of him as ‘an Alpha’ rather than Malfoy. Somehow it being
"I'm sorry I married Ginny, and I'm sorry I got engaged to her without talking to you at all." Harry said. Malfoy stared at him, eyes narrowed, hands clenched together in a silent show of anger.
“Thanks, Luna.” He gave her a smile, and left her to her confusing research. She sent him off with a wave, and Harry found Ron and Hermione at the back of the library, waiting for him.
"It means a lot to you? Suddenly, the past means something to you?" Malfoy scoffed. Harry winced, and braced himself for the rant he knew was coming.
Lunch brought a much needed reprieve in the form of a note from Hermione, asking him to watch Rose for a few hours after work. She mentioned she'd already spoken with Ginny that morning, so she was planning on staying at practice later. He wrote back promptly, agreeing to babysit, not even bothering to ask why they needed a babysitter. He was eager for the distraction from his own mind.
It was the usual assorted greetings he’d gotten, every day, for the past five years. And this morning, he hated them. They were evidence of how predictable, and mundane his life had gotten. Even chasing down Dark wizards, the occasional magical battle, he felt simply bored. His life, exciting as it may seem to the wizarding public, had grown dull. ‘Colorless’ someone had once said. He’d rather liked that expression. He could clearly see that that lampshade was a hideous shade of green, that Ginny’s hair was as red as ever, that his office was lined with colorful quidditch and wanted posters, but the world just seemed faded.
That was stupid, he decided. Every Alpha and Omega in the room would know exactly what they were up to if they went anywhere alone together. He knew they could all smell his heat and they all knew Malfoy was a dominant Alpha. They knew they weren’t friends. Knew there was no other reason he’d seek Malfoy out while in heat.
When the stars and trembling finally subsided, Harry was left sucking in deep breaths of the comforting spice, and very aware of the knot trapped inside him. He licked the side of Draco’s neck, tasting that overpowering potency of his pulse. The haze was clearing a bit from his mind, and his breathing calmed. He leaned up, staring down at the Alpha secured to him, and felt a wave of satisfaction. This was
“That first time, we ran into each other in the hall, and it was an accident… Neither of us expected it. I don’t think he’s ever met a dominant Omega before, so… We both kind of lost control. And then it happened again, and again, so we just… decided to agree to let it happen. It’s… easier when I know what to expect.” Harry said. Ron seemed to relax at those last words but his face was still drawn with betrayal.
. Harry pushed that thought away, and tried to put his question into words that wouldn't entirely humiliate him.
“This salve heals friction burn and chafing.”
“Ron, sit down, and stop shouting. Let Harry explain, for goodness sake.” She sat next to Ron, keeping her hand on his arm, as if holding him in place. Ron huffed in several angry breaths, and turned a sour expression on Harry.
“Bit hungry, Harry?” Neville’s tone was almost teasing, but a bit worried, and Harry just shrugged.
"I don't think being friends is a possibility." He admitted, rubbing the back of his neck, and stretching a bit. "I didn't cheat on Ginny, but I wouldn't say things went WELL, either."
Having his theory that Malfoy was similarly affected by his hormones made Harry's stomach clench with prideful enjoyment. Being dominant, Malfoy was the most powerful Alpha in the whole school, and it pleased Harry that his heat pheromones rendered him useless. Harry willfully ignored that he was made useless himself by Malfoy's.
“That… doesn’t sound SO bad… minus the pregnant part…” Harry muttered, leaning back over Draco, feeling that the knot had abated to allow him to slide easily. He bit his lip, grinning as he canted his hips back and forth slowly. The warm coil of pleasure began building inside of him once more. Draco growled and grabbed him. He practically threw Harry down as he rolled them, and once he was back on top, Harry could once more do nothing except get lost in the taste and sensation of his Alpha in a wave of blindingly powerful cinnamon.
"If you HAD been there, Ron, you would have been in the same boat as him. Malfoy is dominant, isn't he?” Hermione inserted the cold logic that Harry found amusing. More amusing was Ron’s face. He looks affronted that Hermione wouldn’t cater to his fantasy of being immune to the pheromones of a stronger Alpha, as if being non-dominant was an insult. Hary snickered, but quickly stopped when Hermione glared at him and asked. “You were alright, though? It didn’t… upset you?”
“Since you are all of age, and each of you has suffered your own trials this past year, I have decided to grant you each the option to have your own private rooms.” She waited for the tittering to die down, and continued. “You will not be held to a curfew, so long as you do not disturb the younger students, or resting Professors.”
“If it’s not someone who’d have sex with you, or someone you’d have sex with, then the sexual appeal isn’t part of the scent.” Hermione summarized. “There aren’t MANY Alpha girls in school, but it’s probably why you liked Cho, and Ginny, even though you were on suppressants. Part of you could still tell that they were what you wanted.”
. Last night. It usually stops after we… have sex, but… last night… It stopped, and then started again. You HAD to notice, I mean, I was nearly as rough as you were!”
“I did. I’ve… been taking suppressant potions.” Harry admitted. He was lucky he’d had Pomfrey’s reaction to learn from, as Hermione nearly shrieked, and launched herself upright out of her chair. Ron winced, and looked startled. Harry smiled knowingly at him.
“I was at Malfoy Manor.” Harry ran a hand self-consciously through his hair. He’d done his best to tidy himself up before he’d left, but he knew he must still look a mess. He hadn’t bothered to do up all of his buttons, he knew his lips must be swollen, his usually messy hair was a disaster, and he feared he smelled like the other man. Like sweat, and sex, and expensive cologne. He’d been pulled back in for a last minute tumble by a supine blond when he’d tried to give a simple farewell. He knew their last coupling would be lingering on his skin, the sweat would be making his hair even more chaotic. But even here, in front of his wife, at the memory of the night he’d had, the dark morning hours spent satisfying his languid lover, his cock gave an exhausted twitch.
The next week went on in the same fashion, but each day after classes, Harry found fresh sheets on his bed, and new potions in his cabinet. The elves seemed to still know his routines and habits, and it made him wistful, thinking of Kreacher who worked in the Hogwarts kitchens now, Dobby who had died.
Harry’s heart stopped in his chest.
His hair had grown out, and Harry was nearly reminded of Lucius, except that Draco wore his hair loose. His face wasn’t the same haughty expression that his father wore, either. It was still hateful, but differently so. More personal. Harry felt his heart squeeze painfully with both guilt, and resentment for the man that stood before him. He looked healthy, minus the dark circles under his eyes. He held a folder in one hand, and Harry noted that he must have had business in the Ministry.
“Oh, that’s a shame.” Malfoy said in a tone that was almost disappointed. But the way his eyes flicked to meet Harry’s was an unmistakable silent gloating. He’d get Harry alone, one way or another. Harry looked away. He knew what was likely to happen if he allowed himself to be alone with Malfoy. He always seemed to get under his skin, to make him lose his sense of control, and sanity. He could never help himself when Malfoy started up. And then it always escalated…
if Malfoy was pissed off about Harry unintentionally releasing pheromones. He didn’t care if Malfoy was irritated that he could probably smell Harry from across the room.
“Oh, erm… thanks?” Harry managed to articulate after a moment, and Luna’s eyes widened as she looked back at him from where she’d been staring into space.
!” Ron accused. Harry felt his cheeks burning hotter with each word, opened his mouth, and found he couldn’t deny it. Ron’s pheromones were filling the space, angry, tasting of betrayal, and… weak. Harry hated that thought, but even Ron’s furious uncontrolled rush of scent was nothing compared to Draco’s. Harry knew, if he wanted, he could do what Draco had done to Smith. He could bring Ron to his knees without a word. Could make him stop shouting by choking him with dominant pheromones. Harry shivered at the cruel thought and pushed it away. He’d suffered Ron’s wrath before, it wouldn’t be so bad.
here!”
"If you really can't stand fucking me, Potter, go hide in the infirmary next time you're in heat. Or learn to control your pheromones. It's not as though I enjoy being drawn to you from the other side of the castle." Malfoy huffed.
The sex was harsh, fast, and noisy. Harry heard the slapping sounds, the grunts, moans, and growls. He heard the high-pitched keening he made when Malfoy’s tongue swept over one of his nipples, and Harry jerked, surprised that his chest could be so sensitive. He was certain it never had been before. When pink lips suckled at the rosy nub, Harry arched off the bed, fisted his hands in platinum hair, and begged for more. Malfoy provided without hesitation, using lips, tongue, teeth, hands, and that wonderful, perfect cock to bring Harry off. Again. And again. Harry came, shuddering, moaning, and when the sensation of being stretched became too much, when Malfoy felt
“Nah. Heard he got told off fifth year, which must be true, ‘cause he hasn’t really bothered since.” Ron gave a shrug, and Harry was unable to stop the tide of memories. The overpowering crush of Malfoy’s scent. The
“I’m fine, now… but… I’m probably going to go into heat while you’re… busy. It was worse last night. I was good, after… but then it came again. It’s getting worse!” Harry lamented, and let out a groan of frustration. It had been two weeks, and suddenly, he’d gone into heat twice in one night.
“Yes. And the potion isn’t working.” He explained. Pomfrey nodded, waving her wand at him, taking diagnostics, pressing her hands to his forehead, feeling his pulse at his wrist. Harry let her work without comment, letting her be the first to break the silence.
Harry was saved having to figure out what he’d say to Malfoy by a knock at his door just as he’d started pacing, trying to think of something that wouldn’t make him look stupid. He went to answer the door and found Malfoy standing there, several inches taller than him so he had to look up, grey eyes focused down the hall like he was scouting for witnesses. Harry stepped aside without a word and let him in, holding his breath, his shoulders filled with tension. Seeing Malfoy when he was in heat felt differently when he’d agreed to do so. When it wasn’t a surprise he was trying to learn to breathe through.
“Oh no! I can’t come. I’ve got practice.” Ginny explained, with an almost convincing look of sorrow.
“You’ll want to avoid the Alphas. Though… if I recall correctly, you’re a dominant Omega, so they shouldn’t give you too much trouble, really. There’s only one dominant Alpha presently attending, and I don’t believe you two ever even speak to one another, so that shouldn’t be much of a concern…” She seemed as though she was trying to convince herself, and Harry tried to remember what he’d been told about ‘dominant’ Alphas and Omegas. All Alphas and Omegas released pheromones, and with the regular kind, Alphas and Omegas could influence one another, especially if one was in a heat or rut. Dominants, though, produced
“You slept there? What, were you drunk, or something? You don’t smell like you spent the night drinking…” Ginny observed, leaning in slightly to give him a sniff. Harry met her gaze steadily.
“We should probably get ready for class. I need a shower. Get as much of your
“I… er… tried. With Zacharias Smith… That’s what they were fighting over. Me.” Harry blushed, but forced the words out. “Malfoy literally chased him off, and… I’m sorry Ron, but there’s no one else in school who can…” Harry trailed off, not sure Ron would appreciate hearing any of the words he’d wanted to apply. “It’s hard, Ron, but… Right now, Malfoy’s really the only option, unless I want to spend half the next few months hiding in the hospital wing.”
“Well, Malfoy, your cock is
“No, I… I can feel it. Just stop.” Harry pleaded, his face blazing with mortification at admitting such a detail. Malfoy’s laughter stopped immediately, though. Harry decided to count it as a win.
Harry flinched, and took a moment to gather his thoughts, and courage. He took strength from Hermione's calm acceptance, and Malfoy's obvious emotion.
“It’s part of what we are, Potter. Alphas are possessive, and Omega’s tend to cling. That desire you won’t admit you have, to lie here like this all day? It’s completely natural. You don’t have to be embarrassed by clinging to me in your sleep, of all fucking things.” Malfoy drawled, clearly a bit stung over Harry’s reaction in the mornings. Harry felt his cheeks darken at the thought of Malfoy watching him scramble from the bed in a panic twice now.
“Seven… eight hours ago?” Harry shook his head, unable to recall exactly what time he’d woken up and choked down the thirteenth potion in as many days.
Harry entered, looking at her with suspicion.
“MALFOY!?” Ron shouted suddenly, making Harry jump, and fall back into one of the leather chairs in Hermione’s sitting room.
to pair off like some predetermined will of nature. You’re free to see whomever you choose, Harry. Or, no one at all, if you like!” She seemed terribly pleased with her answer, and Harry smiled, appreciating her effort. The problem was… after the previous night, he was pretty sure he’d never be able to have sex without imagining what it
"What do you mean?" Hermione asked, leaning forward. Her hand had stopped rocking the bassinet, so Harry reached out, and took up the action.
He woke alone, his bed still damp with sweat, the scent of Malfoy lingering around him, but the sheets were cool, Malfoy long gone. Harry almost felt jilted to find himself suddenly alone when he’d fallen asleep warm and safe. He refused to entertain the feeling of being alone and empty, and maintained to himself that he was glad Malfoy was gone. That he didn’t have to decide whether to kick him out of the bed again or awkwardly laugh over this happening again.
“Because I didn’t want to get kicked out again. I don’t WANT to leave while you’re asleep… vulnerable. Especially since you’re covered in my scent. It makes me want to stay, to protect you while you recover. It’s the same for all Alphas." Harry noticed that Malfoy’s pale face was tinged pink, and he laughed softly. He definitely hadn’t imagined the defensive tone in Draco’s voice. He felt his body relaxing into the embrace, comforted by the pheromones, the warmth, the familiarness of Draco’s body. That thought threatened to make him panic again, but it was suppressed by the words Draco had just spoken. It was natural to feel like this. Last night, however… Harry groaned, wiggling his way out of Malfoy’s arms to sit up, holding his head in his hands.
“Here. Sorry.” Harry let Draco take the baby from him, and stepped away, staring at the pair of blonds, he felt another sharp stab in his gut. Sure he and Malfoy had had a bit of fun, but he couldn’t really understand why, after all these years, such an insane whirlwind that they’d been in was still affecting him so deeply….
“I’m not an idiot, Harry! His pheromones are all over you! They’ve
Harry laughed, and tried not to let Malfoy’s scent, or his aloof behavior bother him. He was sure they wouldn’t need to actually work with him. Hermione could get them a good grade on her own.
"I think I understand. I take it the… tension?... Between you two never got properly resolved?" She sipped delicately at her tea. Harry let out a bark of laughter.
He quickly took the soft pink mouth again, savoring a few slow, deep kisses. The kind he’d missed most. As his arousal quickly took charge once more, he let himself go, enjoying Draco in a way he hadn’t enjoyed anything in so long. His hands played brutally across the beloved pale body, and his every abuse was eagerly accepted. He held out longer the second time, switching erratically between his vicious pleasures, and a slow, torturous worship of his love.
Malfoy leaned back, chuckling some more, and Harry shivered. It felt
Harry shook his head, and Ron snorted.
“Are you alright?” Malfoy’s voice was full of concern, and Harry shook the cobwebs from his mind. Having Draco around again was not doing his mind any good. It kept wandering, and as he looked at his ex-lover, holding the angelic baby, his mind wandered again. Stupidly, he let himself imagine it was HIS baby. Stupidly, he imagined grabbing the long blond hair that Malfoy had let grow, and pulling him in for one of those slow, deep kisses. And even more stupidly, he imagined days on end where that was the norm, kissing his fiesty blond, and sometimes getting bitten. Carrying a blond baby around, and teaching him to ride a broom. Telling him that the peacocks his great-grandfather had let infest the property were truly a dumb idea, that the pink roses on that gazebo were full of magic, if he just wished hard enough of one, his wish would come true.
“If you think I’m ‘a bit bitey’ now, when I go into a rut, everything becomes infinitely riskier. More dangerous. Since we’re both dominants, it’s likely it would be far worse than I can anticipate. I would hurt you, I would mark you, and I would impregnate you.” Malfoy warned. Harry felt a chill go up his spine at that. It made something deep inside him stir to life, thrilling at the idea. He shoved it far back down as Draco spoke again.
“So… Marking. It’s just biting, right?” He restated his question.
“Of course I’ll agree to keep fucking you. That is what you meant by ‘help’, isn’t it?” Malfoy’s eyes opened again, and he managed to fix a mocking smirk on his face for a moment before it was wiped away with another inhalation of Harry’s pheromones. Harry had to resist the urge to call him a prat, and refused to give in to Malfoy’s provoking. He was clearly just trying to wind him up, and Harry thought it was probably better not to delve into their old warring habits. He much preferred the new habits they seemed to be forming. Which was strange on it’s own.
“Auror Potter.”
“And the pheromone suppressants between.” He admitted, feeling a bit sheepish now. Her face was going a bit red, and he wondered if she was about to explode. She took in a long, slow breath, and then let it out just as painstakingly slowly. Harry sat silently, hoping she didn’t shout at him for whatever he’d apparently done wrong. Had he been supposed to take them together?
"How can I help you, Potter?" Malfoy asked, lacing his fingers together atop the desk. His face was a carefully crafted mask of polite interest. Harry swallowed, still recalling the absolute fury and betrayal that his face could show.
Harry realized he was cringing by the end of it. He felt as if every word Malfoy shouted was a ball and chain of guilt dragging him to the bottom of a lake of misery. He was sure, if he hadn't cried all over Hermione, he would have started crying, just over the guilt that Malfoy's fury slapped on him. He managed to keep his reaction in check, and as Malfoy's anger outgrew words, and he stood, hands balled into fists, chest heaving from his rant, Harry thought he was still beautiful. Even furious, ready to spit vitriol, and fire, Harry couldn't be upset with his angry accusations.
Ron on her skin, as if she’d bathed in his pheromones. Harry hadn’t known they were sleeping together. He could smell Zacharias Smith as they sat down to lunch, even though he was at the table behind them. He caught the wide-eyed glance of the Hufflepuff as his nostrils flared, clearly catching Harry’s scent in return. Harry grimaced, trying to do as he’d learned and control his pheromones. His clothes felt damp with sweat, and he desperately wished for a shower. He suffered through the rest of their classes without a word from Ron, and Hermione making obviously strained chat.
“We… er… usually sleep through this part, don’t we?” He commented rhetorically, trying for humor in the humiliating situation. He knew, logically, that Malfoy had knotted inside him during their previous couplings. He knew that was what was stretching him to the limit, and keeping Malfoy from running off immediately. Now, however, being able to feel it, to
“Yeah. I’m used to taking potions every day, so it’s not hard to remember.” Harry shrugged, already trying to back out of the hospital ward. Pomfrey frowned at him as he escaped, but didn’t stop him.
Harry’s great plan to completely ignore Malfoy’s existence was ruined by their group project. He sat across from Harry nearly every afternoon, practicing his own bit of the charmwork, and then turning to practice with Hermione, while Ron and Harry practiced on the other side of the table. Harry tried not to feel irritated by the way Malfoy was ignoring him right back. He tried to ignore the scent that filled his nose and his head. He tried
“Clearly.” Malfoy said in a chilly tone, his eyes darting to the lift just behind Harry. He’d had the same thought of avoiding the crowds. Harry didn’t like that. Harry also didn’t like how the look insinuated that he wanted to escape. As if HE was somehow the one mistreated by his showing up here. Harry tried to think of a nonchalant way to turn, and run to the lift, slamming the door closed so Malfoy couldn’t join him. There was no possible way. So he’d have to suffer.
"I'm here!" He called, and Hermione appeared in the kitchen doorway, silently shushing him. He tiptoed towards her, feeling as if something wasn't quite right. She was wearing cleaning clothes, not going out clothes, and in the kitchen?
"I'm sorry, Hermione, I can't babysit. I have something I have to do." Harry abruptly stood, and headed for the door.
. Draco was panting, his eyes more black pupil than grey.
Hands explored, more slowly than they had before. Lips trailed down from his mouth, along his jaw, down his throat. Teeth scraped, and a thrill of dangerous anticipation filled Harry at the thought of Malfoy biting him.
"Master Draco is in Master Scorpius' nursery…" the elf wheezed. Harry smiled.
the desire in the air around them, and seeing the almost anxious look in his eyes.
"Master Potter! Master Draco is not expecting company! I'll let him know you've arrived if you please will wait!" The familiar elf was practically running after him as he strode up the grand staircase. He paused, taking pity on the creature, as it huffed for breath.
?” He was horrified. He’d never had sex before, and suddenly he was going to be some sort of sex-crazed maniac? What the hell even WAS being an Omega?
“Not even a little. Just taking it easy the first time, so you don’t cry.” Harry retorted, as he picked up his wand. Draco’s eyes followed the motion with sharp interest, and Harry grinned down at him. “In fact, I’ve learned a few new things while you were away. Though… None of them from marriage…” Harry mused, shoving his hand under Malfoy’s back, to wrap his arm around the slim frame in a firm hold. He took a single soft breath to steady himself, focused, and rolled himself sideways, pulling Draco with him into the uncomfortable vice of apparation.
“Ahh.” Hermione nodded. “A sort of struggle for power with pheromones?”
Harry woke, groggy, his whole body throbbing as if he’d been running quidditch drills all the previous day. He felt warm, comfortable, and safe, and was disinclined to get up. The horrendous dream he’d just suffered, however, made him want a shower to wash away the very thought that Malfoy would be some perfectly acceptable Alpha to sleep with.
He reaches for his backpack, cast off into the bottom of the empty wardrobe. He'd never gotten around to unpacking his things for their short stay. The hair on the back of his neck tells him that Draco is watching as he rummages through the bag, up to his elbow in scattered magazines and a cascade of socks before his hand finally closes on crinkled paper.
, okay?"
"Tutor Mr. Malfoy?"
They're running out of time, Harry knows that. The Quidditch match could end at any second and they both have to return to their common rooms before too long. Harry reaches out to prolong the moment, not giving himself time to ponder over why he even wants to keep Draco here. They've never spoken like this before, not so calmly, not without one of them testing the limits of the other's patience.
were, or because of this great tragedy that happened to me. Strangers decided who I was going to be without giving me a chance to figure it out for myself."
"It's not like that - "
"I didn't - I never planned to, anyway. It just sort of happened."
"Come off it, Malfoy. Stop being so bloody proud! You're not going to get far on your own!"
less than what the black and white words printed out onto parchment say they are.
"Surely she can see that this isn't practical?"
Harry cannot see much of the boggart from his position and nor does he need to; his focus is directed solely on Draco and his reactions, the noticeable tremor throughout his body as the boggart-Lucius sneers and taunts. Despite Draco's bravado, he can't manage to verbalise the spell. He let's the boggart shout him down at every instance, cowed by its words as if it truly were his father in front of him.
He steps out of his room, leaving his unpacked bag on the bed.
family. Narcissa is seated and straight backed in a rather austere chair, terribly beautiful. Lucius lurks behind her, positively glowering at his son coming to stand beside Harry. And between them? Draco. He's much younger than when Harry first lay eyes on him, maybe six or seven years old. Small, round eyed and chubby cheeked, peering out of the frame as if he already knows where his future lies and that he's powerless to stop it. Lucius's hand is a claw on the young Draco's shoulder, holding him back, reining him in with a swift tug.
a hippogriff going on the run. You'll be chuffed when you hear that bit."
He hates to disappoint the Weasley's, especially because of how generous they've always been towards him. The Burrow has felt more like a home than anywhere else he's lived - aside from Hogwarts, of course - and the Weasley's are some of the people he cares about most. They'd taken him in with open arms when no one else had before, no questions asked.
Ron pauses mid-chew, makes a show of thinking over her question. He let’s it go with a casual shrug. “...Nah. Probably not.”
Draco is halfway across the stone courtyard, tripping over his own feet the moment he hears Harry's call.
Draco doesn't hear Harry's call. He doesn't appear to have the presence of mind to remember what he is even doing. His newly returned wand slips from his loose grip and clatters onto the floor, rolling away beneath the book shelf. The sun is long gone, its light replaced with creeping shadows that snap tenaciously at Draco's heels.
Draco but why should they not become friends in the process?
When Harry looks about and sees that they're some of the last to remain on the platform, he turns and finds Draco consulting his watch for the third time since they arrived at the station.
. It's nice knowing that Draco actively sought him out for company instead of avoiding him.
PENULTIMATE CHAPTER ALERT.
"Not a fan of feeling close to people, huh?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"It sounds like something you'd do, you seem to enjoy vexing me. Being boyhood adversaries lost its charm, has it?"
Harry looks down at his own wand and sets his jaw, swallowing down the petty resistance rising up in his chest.
Harry looks after Draco's retreating figure, then down to the broom still held in his tight grasp. He has to jog to catch up with Draco's long-legged stride, slipping on the frosted grass as they descend a slope.
"You lack any subtlety, Potter." Draco surmises with obvious discomfort, shifting in his seat. His poker face is breathtakingly terrible, so much so that Harry can't believe he'd managed to pull the wool over so many people's eyes for the past few years. Harry can read him as clearly as a book. "Everybody is staring."
Draco puts two and two together quicker than Harry gives him credit for. "A hippogriff on the - you know what? Let's save it for a while. I'll have to endure the anticipation but at least I'll be better prepared for when you tell me the surprise."
"Yeah," Harry sucks in a fortifying deep breath. "Yeah, I think I am."
"Do you know it's possible to love someone and yet not like them? Of course not, you've only ever loved those you liked. My father had a very funny way of showing love, you see. He could be moody, petulant in a way but incredibly manipulative. You know that he slipped up with the Dark Lord's diary in our second year? When that stunt backfired, he twisted the blame around on me. He said he'd indulged my childish resentment against you and your friends that day in Flourish and Blotts, that it was my fault for Dumbledore's suspicion turning towards us. If there was a cause for embarrassment, I was usually named as its culprit."
"You look like shit, Potter." Draco finally declares without inflection.
Maybe - just maybe - it had been there waiting all along.
"Tough?" Ron says, laughing slightly. "It's not like he's innocent in all of this, Hermione. The bloody moron joined You-Know-Who!"
"What did you think Dumbledore's Army was, Hermione? Besides, not everyone
"Oh - uh, right," Harry says, looking between the two of them. "Talk about what?"
Hermione had been less forthcoming besides offering a firm vow of support and a stack of books dedicated to the study of boggarts but that only scared Harry more. For some reason, he didn't want to know what was going on inside her very intuitive head. It isn't like Hermione to keep information to herself.
Harry can't help but pity him, watching as a grim Professor Slughorn meekly approaches Malfoy. Harry and his friends, lagging behind the rest of their house, are close enough to overhear the unsteady quiver of his voice.
what he pictured; cheerless hallways, grey and sombre, not a single bauble to be seen in any of the hundreds of rooms. Draco had warned him about his errands and Harry had accepted the invitation to the Manor knowing those terms - but still, he found the silence here to be deafening when Draco was off making adjustments to the chef's menu or chasing down rogue peacocks in the orchard.
UPDATE (currently 1st March): I am writing the next chapter! I don't know how else I can inform any of you who may read this fic but I
“Are you ready, Draco?”
Hermione jabs an elbow into his ribs, her whisper in his ear. "Harry, what are you looking at?"
Harry sits up onto his knees, hands braced on the soft mattress beneath his hands, shuffling closer. Draco startles at the movement, violently jolting away like a pair of invisible hands are gripping him by the shoulders and yanking him back but he recovers well, expression shifting back into passive.
"I wish," Draco begins slowly, watching Harry chuck his bag unceremoniously onto the bed. "That you wouldn't say that so flippantly."
"I dunno. It just...bothered me to see him like that." Harry admits, visibly irked, one hand crumpling his hair into catastrophe. That's the part that keeps giving him trouble; why does it bother him? His history with Malfoy is calamitous, they've never seen eye to eye yet he can't ignore the nagging worry that they could be two sides of the same coin.
"Luck has nothing to do with it. It's you and your demented laughing! They probably heard you from Hogsmeade!" Draco hisses, pressing a hand over Harry's mouth to stop that laugh bursting out then and there. "You can't just laugh like a normal person, can you? You have to declare it to the world!"
"Yes, you did. You know how I feel about that stuff, you were going for the jugular. It's your defense mechanism."
"You chose the wrong side - "
"I wouldn't dream of it." he says absently. If Harry hadn't been noticing that the silver stripes on his tie are exactly the same shade as his hair in the darkening room, he might have seen the signs he knows all too well; the subtle change in Draco's stance, his fingers flexing by his thigh, the crease between his thin brows.
Harry wonders how he can possibly begin to ignore them. There are hundreds, taking up every space on the wall so that only slithers of dark wood peak through, like cracks in a plate. Multitudes of frames, in all shapes and sizes, all bearing some variation of a disgusted face and the same white blonde hair that Harry has come to eagerly seek out.
Just as he's about to gather up his things and at the very least a decent handful of sandwiches out of the bargain, a glint of copper catching the dying rays of light across the room draws his eye.
"That was great - really great. You've made some excellent progress, Draco."
Draco falters, the thin lines of his mouth turned down in a sneer. "What are you
"I feel guilty that I have the Weasley's.” Harry murmurs, as if afraid to say it out loud. “I always felt that I - I deserved what I got at the Dursley's. Like, I shouldn't be allowed to be happy without my mum and dad. They never got to live."
supposed to mean?"
"You are aware, as is Mr. Malfoy, that the wand in question is to be kept within my office until Mr. Malfoy requires it for his studies, are you not?" McGonagall asks frankly, settling back into her seat.
out there.
department of all places? Harry doubts that he's turned over a new leaf to be exploring the Muggle way of life. At night. By himself. He'd been wandering around on his own like this before when he'd slipped quietly to the Vanishing Cabinet and let in Voldemort's most loyal.
"Potter, you are the reason why the rest of us get to live freely. Do you think I'd be here having this chat with you if you'd not defeated the Dark Lord? If you'd not saved my life?" Draco says sharply. "Things go wrong around you because other people are
Not liking the idea of being confined to one room with only his thoughts to occupy him, Harry decides to retrace his steps, figuring it'd be better to at least get a handle of the Manor's extensive corridors and shadowy rooms than limit himself to relying on Draco to shuttle him around.
The office is much the same as it had been when Dumbledore resided here, the only exception a particularly comfortable looking tartan-clad armchair now situated behind the desk, a mildly surprised Professor McGonagall ensconced within it.
together either." Harry chips in half-heartedly, his attention returning to Draco. The pull of the other boy is like the force of a magnet; no matter how hard Harry tries, Draco is always there under his gaze.
"It's just - it's hard. I'm so tired of being gawped at." Harry confesses, expecting a biting remark from Draco for that. When none is forthcoming, he ploughs on. "But yeah - yeah, I miss it. I
Harry isn't listening; Draco is getting to his feet, inconspicuously removing from the Slytherin table and heading towards the doors. Harry jumps up, scrambling to swing his bag onto his shoulders and climb over the bench at the same time.
He waits for the pounding of his heart against his chest to ease, pressing shaky fingers against the sweat-slicked small of his back before dropping heavily onto the mattress again. It had seemed so real. He can still smell the damp earth and moss, his eyes
"Doesn't your mum feel, I dunno, a bit isolated being here all the time with no one else around?" Harry asks awkwardly, following Draco down a dark corridor. It's chillier in the house than it is outside, no wonder Draco is strapped down in that restrictive coat.
together in the Great Hall. Weasley would grip his knife and fork so hard Draco had half expected them to snap from the pressure while Granger was obviously distributing kicks under the table in Weasley's direction. How fun those early days had been, indeed...
"Ahem - well - I need to go. I'll...see you around, Potter."
Ron harrumphs as he shucks off his sodden robes and dumps them in a dirty pile in front of the fire, sharing a look of dark jealousy with his sister.
Draco would have cursed Harry for that in the past. Instead, he turns on his heel and heads to the door, pausing with a hand clenching the doorknob. He doesn't turn back to look but from Harry's position, he can just make out the obnoxious upturn of Draco's nose, the severe cut of his cheekbone. When Draco next speaks, he lets every ounce of his fatigue pour into the words, the lines of his shoulders drooping as if any energy he had clung onto has suddenly drained from him.
"Well, I'd rather try it than not! Hold on - she likes biscuits." Harry explains, remembering all of the times he's been hauled to her office only to be confronted by that tartan tin of hers. "Ginger Newts!"
Each cast is paired by the forceful motion of Draco jabbing his wand as if the sheer violence of his movement can make it all disappear but instead, he merely manages to roll the Harry-boggart onto its side, knocking its glasses askew.
The journey down to the first floor - Mrs. Norris now safely removed to the dungeons - is uneventful. The peacefulness of the corridors shouldn't concern him the way it does but the last time the school had been this silent, people were attending to the injured and dead in the Great Hall. Harry wonders if Hogwarts will ever look the same to him again; can he ever separate the terrible things that had happened here from the place where he finally found a home after the neglect of Privet Drive?
"Master Draco, I is sorry to be disturbing you but you is needed in the parlour. Mistress is wanting you, sir."
"This is - " Draco is at a loss. He runs a gentle touch down the length of the wand, grey eyes brighter than the sun on the snow. Brighter than anything Harry has seen before. So bright that Harry wants to take Draco's face in his hands. Draco coughs, trying again. "This is unexpected."
Ploddy bows, jingling merrily as he scurries off.
"Okay, it's time to talk." Ron orders, shepherding Harry over to a chair and pushing him forcibly into it.
"Oh...
Draco proceeds slowly, cautiously. "Your parents don't strike me as petty people."
Yes, hello.
"They're about to start the Sorting. Do you want to come in?"
"I'm s-so sorry, father. I'm sorry."
Harry doesn't hesitate, he just
"Has it been working properly for you since you got it back after - well, after?" Harry asks, already knowing what the answer will be.
who I don't even know. He's the guy everyone stops, it's who they're looking for. They want someone that doesn't exist, not in the way that they expect. He's the one they're searching for, some - some hero."
Being here though, where some of the students are young enough to have been spared of the fight, the atmosphere is tangible yet ineffable. Many can walk the halls and see just that - light spilling through archways and unmarked stone, just another empty classroom - but others recall the harrowing memories of unmoving bodies and nearby screams, of prowling Death Eaters in their skeletal masks.
"Of course," Harry says. "Weren't you
"I'm fine, Hermione -
His friends share a sheepish look but split apart, Ron taking one armchair and Hermione settling down in the other which Harry had occupied only mere hours before. Crookshanks springs up from nowhere and pounces onto Hermione's waiting lap, to Ron's clear disapproval. Crookshanks is just one of many subjects that Hermione and Ron will never agree on.
to listen to Percy droan on about broomstick regulations and illegal Portkeys?!"
In terms of press coverage, Malfoy is beaten only by Harry himself. Where Harry had been held up as the paradigm of goodliness and virtue, Malfoy would be cast as his antithesis. They referred to him as
Draco speaks slowly, clearly. "I resent the fact that I have to be the one to tell you this but you're not this great disaster that you think you are."
had been bandied about at his trial by stony faced members of the Wizengamot, as if those words bore no weight to them and they hadn't cost Draco a great deal of his self in their ruthless wake. The Chief Warlock had pardoned him after a laborious and record breaking eight hours of discussion, a string of witnesses acquired from Merlin knows where by his mother and a sincere statement of the deepest remorse from Draco.
"We were
"I wish I had your heart, Harry."
"Alright, if that's what people are calling it these days..."
"Oh, hey - speaking of sneaking around, what were you doing leaving Gryffindor Tower last night?" Ron says cheerfully, tearing Harry's attention away from the knight.
finishing this story!
Harry jumps and thumps his head off the ceiling, swearing violently as he spins to find Draco hitched up against the wall by the doorway. Somewhere in his time attending to duties, he'd shed the coat and gone as far as to undo the top few buttons of his shirt. The sight of him arrests Harry, Draco's long limbs arranged effortlessly so that he gives the outward appearance of being utterly at leisure.
There had been something so recognisable in Draco's expression in that Muggle Studies storeroom; some incensed desire to overcome, something that looked so painfully at a loss as to how to do that.
The next afternoon while the rest of the school are reviving themselves over lunch, Harry and Draco meet outside of the headmistress's office.
"I just - " Harry mumbles, turning instead to point his wand at the gap. "
“Oh, cut him some slack, Hermione. Poor bloke needed that lie in,” Ron speaks up, biting into his third bacon sandwich. “It’s nice to be on this side of one of your lectures though. It’s invigorating.”
"Yeah - I mean, yes. With it being N.E.W.T year and everything, I thought it would be - uh - beneficial for him to get to grips with it."
Draco looks equally amused, a small mercy that they should be with company and not alone because Harry
"I couldn't sleep. I came down here and brought the Map with me but - but then I saw Malfoy - " both Ron and Hermione groan at that. "Look, he wasn't in his own dormitory. He was in the Muggle Studies classroom, so I - "
Draco's gaze drags over Harry from head to toe, slow and purposeful, picking up and pulling apart every last detail of him. Harry grows aware of his appearance; his ratty pyjama bottoms, the shrunken Weasley jumper, the mismatched socks Dobby had gifted to him some Christmases ago that Harry will never have the heart to throw out. Harry lifts his chin defiantly, not prepared to let Malfoy belittle him.
Harry nods, looking out over the ravine from the bridge. The thing is, he'd have said the same about this situation some months ago, the improbability of sharing something threateningly close to pleasant with Draco. The bitter wind sharpens his mind somehow, it's easier to think out here than in the hazy warmth of their common room or amidst the din in the Great Hall. Here, his thoughts are clear.
Harry had bid farewell to Hermione and Ron that morning, seeing them off in their own carriage before he waited in the rain for an unrepentant and late Draco.
looks at him - and sees the same dark circles beneath his own eyes reflected back at him in Malfoy's face. With his father locked up in Azkaban and his mother a recluse, Draco has had to bear the brunt of the public's dissatisfaction all on his own. Those purple bruises are a confirmation that Draco is simply a boy at the end of his tether, getting by on sheer grit and determination just like the rest of them. It startles Harry to realise that, nearly makes him want to reach up and press his fingers to those bruises for one inexplicable second. Instead, he crams his hands into the pockets of his pyjamas.
"I managed to live eleven successful years as a muggle, thank you very much! So did Harry!"
The stories that they had gotten weren't from the people who knew him best. All they had to go on were distant memories about a scrawny twelve year old boy who had kindly passed on a set of weighing scales once in Potions, or outdated hearsay from when he'd emerged from the Triwizard Tournament clutching Cedric's dead body. Things that had once condemned him to the public were now used to praise him. Every detail was inflated. The Prophet had ran a week long story because Harry had been spotted talking to Cho in Diagon Alley, one that dragged his break up with Ginny into the mix and speculated on his so-called newly rekindled romance with Cho.
"No!" Harry says quickly, seriously. "Draco, this is nothing to do with being weak. I do think there's a lot you're keeping from me that we need to talk about though."
Potter, naturally, is stumped by the question. As if it had never occurred to him why he was so eager on befriending an ex-Death Eater - because it probably
Harry sighs and recounts the whole story to them, his voice dropping as other Gryffindors begin to trickle into the common room. He omits the part including his nightmare, hoping that they'll be too distracted by Malfoy's part of the tale to pick up on why he couldn't sleep to begin with.
"This is simply a means to an end. You're accomplishing nothing by giving up Quidditch."
"What are you thinking, Draco?"
Ron rolls his eyes as if he's put-upon by having to explain this to his best friend. "Yes, you were! You were doing that flirting thing you do."
Harry doesn't say a word for now; he watches Draco stare down towards the unseen ground, white faced, blonde hair so bright in the moonlight that it glows. He cuts a severe figure against the inky blue of the sky, tall and lithe and sharp around the edges, his thin lips parted as he whispers his way through the past.
"Hey - HEY, MALFOY! WAIT!"
Draco completes a full circuit of the house, emphatically bypassing the dungeons and the drawing room, a gesture of unforeseen thoughtfulness that faintly surprises Harry.
"I'm sorry, it's not my business."
"You can't do it all, Harry. You can't carry everyone's burden all the time."
as if his name were fit to be uttered in our home, as if you were - "
Ron lets out a low whistle, "Blimey - no messing about with McGonagall, is there?"
Harry grins, oblivious to the turmoil bubbling away in Draco's stomach, and resumes his absurdly enthusiastic climb.
"What do you think you're doing, Potter?!" Draco distant cry comes from somewhere behind Harry but he ignores that, trying to make sense of everything. "Get out of the way, you idiot. This is
"It has to be done. How else are we going to get your wand?"
McGonagall arches an eyebrow, an incredible feat based solely off how tightly knotted the bun on her head is. "Potter, I believe we both know a saying that could be applicable in this specific situation regarding talking out of one's backside. Seeing as I am both your teacher and headmistress, I think the more appropriate phrasing for the matter is that I am not entirely positive you are being truthful with me."
"Of course he's late." Harry mutters into the empty room, consulting his watch for the fifth time since they'd been due to meet. The hands on the watch seem to move with all the speed of an Impediment jinx but slowly they collect up the seconds until whole minutes pass by.
"Potter, I need you to understand that I accept my share of responsibility. I'm certainly no angel."
"Absolutely," Harry agrees wholeheartedly, making to follow Draco back up the stairs but not before giving the room one final glance, turning his back on that particular darkness once and for all.
"I need to return to Malfoy Manor for Christmas." he explains, eyes downcast. "There are errands for me to run, staff to meet. That sort of thing. My mother is - uh - otherwise engaged so it falls to me to get everything back on track but I - I'd rather not go alone..."
They're on their way back from Hagrid's hut; Harry had felt immensely guilty at diverting his last visit and had roped Ron and Hermione into coming this time despite Hermione's mounting hysteria over exam preparation. He's still yet to fully explain to them that he's going to be spending Christmas at Malfoy Manor - he'd mentioned the impromptu Quidditch match with Draco but only that - but he's beginning to think he should say something soon in case Ron is taking Harry's usual presence at the Weasley Christmas table for granted.
He doesn't want any of it; he'd been offered an Order of Merlin, First Class the week after Voldemort had died, when the wizarding community had begun to accept that the threat which had long since lurked over them was at last gone. For them, it was as if the air had cleared of a perilous smoke and they were able to breathe freely again. He turned the Order of Merlin down. He encouraged Ron and Hermione to take theirs. He felt that they deserved the recognition far more than he ever did - than he could ever want - and it was something of a respite to celebrate what they had done, what they had
Harry trembles, hair prickling beneath the sleeves of his hoody. Malfoy Manor had been bearable with Draco by his side but to walk without company lends the grand home a new, unnerving atmosphere. Harry no longer opens every door he passes, the portrait gallery losing all its former interest in the dark house growing darker with every minute the sun sets.
Harry Potter is standing outside of the Great Hall, quietly trying to collect himself.
"What? You
Draco goes as still as a statue, then slowly allows his tensed muscles to relax. A conscious effort, Harry realises.
"Great, cheers for that. I hope you got it out of your system because that's the last time you'll ever get to do that." Harry winces, gingerly probing his skull to check for any bumps. "Can I have my wand back now?"
I hope this was worth the wait. Love to you, as usual!
Draco gapes at him, for a moment looking as if he's going to say something but then all he does is tut, pressing the thin lines of his mouth shut. Harry is agog, watching him turn on his heel and hurry back up to the castle just as the drizzle turns into something more substantial, seeping through Harry's shirt. As Draco goes, Harry hears him mutter to himself, just one word fuelled by the anger that Draco is constantly - fruitlessly - trying to tamp down when it comes to Harry Potter.
Harry sighs, rubbing the back of his aching neck. He'd spent the rest of the night sitting up in bed and watching Draco's dot on the Marauder's Map but it didn't stray from its dormitory again. "Why was he trying to face that boggart without his wand? What was he doing with it?"
"Deal," Harry grins. "Although I think I know what Hermione is going to say..." he adds after noticing the look on her face.
Ron's former jealousy drawn out by the horcrux is a distant memory but it makes Harry want to laugh just the same, that Ron could think Harry and Hermione would have ever made a couple. The world feels right with Ron and Hermione, they've always made sense to Harry.
long time. I lost my motivation for this fic but somehow, I've managed to scrape together a final chapter. I won't lie, this was really tough for me. I know it's not the best thing I've ever written and I had really hoped to get something worthwhile up for you to read to justify such a long wait. I hate the idea of disappointing you and letting you all down but I fear this is all I have in me. It was a struggle getting myself to click the post button but I've put this off long enough.
"Potter, do I look like the sort of person who makes jokes?"
"As you can see," Draco drawls, coming to a halt outside a door. "This place is far too large for my mother to live alone but I can't persuade her to sell and move. So
"How was your time alone with Malfoy, anyway?" Ron pipes up, squelching his way to the settee. "Have yourselves a nice little chat?"
"No, I guess we're not." Harry concedes sheepishly, turning back to Draco who is still studiously watching the ceiling.
"Bloody hell. Stress, you say? I wonder what that's like."
"Oh - yeah, you should definitely, uh - "
It's a gramophone. Tucked neatly into the corner of the room and partially obscured beyond the shelf lined with books covered in symbols Harry can't even begin or want to understand, the gramophone bears a striking resemblance to the one which had occupied Remus's office years before. How or why it came to be in the Arithmancy classroom, Harry can never guess but he drifts towards it, crouching down to run a hand over the ridges in the metal, leaving trail marks and collecting dust across his fingertips for his trouble.
Draco is attuned to Harry's thoughts. "Only the finest rooms for our guests. I suppose we're lucky to have been spared a bed or two otherwise you'd have been sleeping on an extraordinarily uncomfortable chaise longue."
"No, wait." Draco says quickly, looking awfully surprised at his own gall. He swallows hard, flushing a brilliant shade of pink. This, too, is something Harry has noticed of late; Draco is always quick to blush, often at odds with his barbed words. "You...can stay."
"Quidditch? But - but why?!"
"No, Harry." she says gently. "I'm not mad. We stopped working long before you felt anything for Malfoy."
there will be. He wants to brush kisses like blossom petals across Draco's pale skin, trail fingers like green grass against his face, his arms, his hair. He wants to whisper birdsong into his ears and wash away the last traces of fragile cold with sweet rain.
The removal and usage of his wand until absolutely necessary was their main demand but Draco had accepted it with a level of good grace that had stunned Harry at the time; to have his wand unceremoniously taken from him at the gates by a Ministry official in front of other students, to know that it was to be kept securely in McGonagall's office except for lessons. Harry remembers losing his own wand, the ugly sensation of feeling vulnerable in the wizarding world without it. His fingers grip around the wand a little tighter.
for irritating, goody-two shoes, beautiful Potter.
He cups his hands around his mouth and shouts up to Draco, his voice echoing around the deserted pitch. "So what are we playing with?"
The blue light glows faintly against Draco’s skin, lending him an ethereal air as he strips off his school robes and adjusts the cuffs of his shirt sleeves.
"Did no one
When Harry rounds on Malfoy, he is slowly rising to his feet with deliberate control. Draco is far from his usually crisp exterior; he pushes back a fistful of typically bright hair darkened from sweat, tear-track stains running down the length of his grey cheeks. He hasn't even changed out of his uniform yet, only loosened his tie and pulled open the top buttons of his shirt. For all of this, he still addresses Harry as if he has merely interrupted a moment of quiet contemplation.
"There's always going to be bad people, that's true." Harry agrees, leaning over the side of his armchair to grab Ron's free hand. "Voldemort is dead and there's no way we can know whether someone else down the line will take up his mantel. But that doesn't mean we stop trying. It doesn't mean that we can become cynical or that we should, I dunno, shut ourselves off from other people because we're scared. If we did that, we'd be just like them."
"I was there, Draco. Dumbledore had immobilised me, I couldn't move - couldn't speak. All I could do was watch."
"Why do you do that?" he murmurs, tracing around the cardboard edges of the chocolate wrapper with his little finger. "Why do you always call me Draco?"
Harry awkwardly glances at the gargoyle, "Uh."
"Harry." Hermione says sadly, recovered marginally from her embarrassment. She crouches at Harry's feet, gently shifting the Quibbler to pat his knee. "If it were possible to take on someone else's fear, we'd have found a way by now. You're doing all you can. Draco will get there, you're a good teacher."
"You're a blemish on our family name." Lucius berates, his hand always gripping the hilt on his concealed wand like a lingering threat. "I'm sick of cleaning up after your mistakes..."
"He was youthful once, maybe not as jaded or warped by our family's particular prejudices. They'd found a place here together until the marriage became founded on the notion that it was a matter of convenience instead of affection - you can love someone without liking them..." Draco finishes quietly as if to himself, finally pushing open the door to reveal a guest room.
"Obviously I didn't mean like this! I meant asking someone if they're okay when you see them upset or - "
The corners of Harry's mouth turn down."You don't have to do that all the time, you know. Go all...prickly like that. It's okay to let yourself be vulnerable.
"Friends," Draco savours the word like an experimental bite of an unfamiliar delicacy, speaking it softly, handling it as gently as he would an ancient book in the library. Harry's heart gives a painful squeeze at Draco's confusion. "You want to be
"Let me make this perfectly clear, Potter. We're not friends. I'm not here to get pally with you, I'm here to sort through my shit and
"You don't need anything?" Draco speaks softly to his knees, a little awkward and stiff as if the day isn't going at all how he had imagined it and he has no prepared plan for this. "But there
Slughorn's disregard of Ron hits a nerve with Harry. It's the same sort of attitude which had incensed Ron only a few years prior; his fear of being overlooked has always been something Harry has struggled to relate to. Harry, who had spent his former years desperately wishing to be ignored by the Dursley's and later on, the whole wizarding world. Harry, who still remains a constant spot of attention in the public's awareness regardless of what he does. Just because Harry can't relate to Ron's struggle doesn't mean that it isn't valid.
Harry feels the tug of a smile at his lips, "Are you feeling sorry for me, Draco?"
Harry ducks his head, "We'd need his wand to practice, Professor."
Harry stares hard at that dot, chewing the skin around his thumb as he ponders over what to do. There's the old itch that flares up whenever Malfoy is concerned, one that he knows will not be subdued until he's sought out all the answers to his questions, and Hermione and Ron aren't here to talk him out of it.
After that, Harry has no time to even worry about what he's going to do about the Draco situation. Christmas is mere days away so they've put a hold on their boggart lessons to focus on all the work that the teachers are heaping on them. Harry feels so swamped with essays and revision that frankly, trying to make sense of his emotions for his former enemy-turned-reluctant student-turned-sort of acquaintance would be too much to handle.
Hermione fixes him with a withering look, "Ronald, what malicious reason can he have? There's no one left. It's just him and his mother free, and I doubt they're capable of causing another uprising of Voldemort's supporters."
"When you see that boggart take the form of your dad, concentrate on turning it into something ridiculous. It's all about facing your fear and laughing in its face, that way it has no power over you." Harry explains in way of refreshing Draco's memory. "Even the things we're scared of the most have limitations to their hold on us. We can grow beyond a lot of our fears, it's just a matter of being ready to do that."
Draco's eyes flit up to Harry's and back down to the offered wand, crossing the room in three strides.
Yes - Harry’s rather quite fond of those dependable bright blue flames.
"You could only dream, Potter. You know what I meant."
Draco doesn't refuse. He slips one finger beneath the edge of the wrapping paper and peels it away from the spellotape, taking tremendous amount of care so not to rip it. A grey scarf spills out into Draco's hands, rippling with strands of silver that highly suggest the wool is infused with its own magic, all Hermione's practice knitting hats for house-elves paying off with tremendous effect. She's definitely outdone herself.
Oh my, I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to post a new chapter. I really
"Yes." Draco simply says in response to the question, levelling a steady gaze at Harry. He makes no other allusions for Harry's benefit, switching topics without bothering to be subtle. "Let's get out of here. I've had Ploddy arrange an informal dinner in your room for us. It hardly seems worth preparing the dining room for a party of two. I - I presumed you'd be happier that way?"
"I beg your pardon - cupboard?"
"Showing off?" Draco asks casually, feeling a twinge of jealousy that he's never been able to master this particular spell.
"Mr. Malfoy, we don't have all day." she barks, giving the tin a final insistent push closer. Draco grabs one and clutches it in both hands, returning to stare at his feet while McGonagall sits back her chair and scrutinises the two students before her.
"Yeah, I'm coming. Thanks Hermione."
Harry rearranges his hold on the worse-for-wear Cleansweep. "How did you know where I was?"
“Everything is perfectly fine, Potter. I trust you’re still okay for our lesson later?”
"What could you possibly - oh."
“What? Are you okay?” Malfoy’s voice filled with concern, and Harry shook his head.
“If you’re going to sleep with someone, couldn’t you pick someone better? If you had someone else, then it wouldn’t be such a problem with him.” Ron insisted. Harry shook his head.
He knocked on the door, and the familiar house-elf opened it.
“That’s it exactly. Pheromones are meant to attract and repel, so unless it’s someone meant to be attracted, or kept away, the pheromones won’t really bother them. Like Betas. Alphas and Omegas might fall in love with Betas, but, magically, they aren’t what we’re drawn to, so Betas cannot smell the Pheromones at all. It’s a shame, really… I imagine Betas would smell fantastic. Like fresh parchment, or spring.”
“I’ve told you I am before.” Ron finally answered, his face still drawn with suspicion.
“Ginny…” He sighed her name, and closed his eyes, rubbing the bridge of his nose. He didn’t want to hurt her, but she was making it very difficult. “Just… go be happy. However you want to be happy. Just do it without me. You can keep the house if you want, or sell it. You can demand alimony, hell, you can even drag my name through the papers if it’ll make you feel better. But… this is over. I’m in…” He had to swallow, and felt his cheeks heat as the words came to his lips. “I’m in love with Draco, and I’m tired of pretending I’m not.”
“Like following you around with a beater’s bat and whacking any Alpha that gets too close to you.” Malfoy added. Harry snickered, thinking of Ron.
“I’m not so sure, anymore. I don’t fancy other guys, but… I don’t really fancy other women either… Just him.” He explained. “I thought I fancied you, but… it’s a different kind of love. I’m sorry, Ginny… I think I want a divorce.” As the words left his mouth, a weight lifted from his chest. He’d said it. Finally, after years, he’d said the words, and there would be no taking them back.
One of the most surprising things he discovered that week, however, was the warm sweet scent that came from Dennis, and the soft sugary smell of Luna. It was a bit cloying, at first, but as he got more familiar with the scent of other Omegas, he found it to be comforting. He wondered if that was how he smelled to Alphas. Like desert.
Malfoy laughed at that, and Harry felt it vibrate inside him. He liked Malfoy laughing. It was embarrassing to feel him laughing
Harry paused at the door of his house, steeling himself to go inside. He’d almost rather take down a hundred Death Eaters at once than cross that threshold, but finally, he worked up the nerve, and went in.
Harry was surprised when he apparated to Malfoy Manor, and the wards didn’t drop him outside the gate. Instead, he landed on the steps, just as he’d meant to. Malfoy hadn’t locked him out of the apparation wards. He was sure it meant nothing good.
He slid into Harry without fuss, and Harry saw stars. It was perfect. It filled him, stretched him, and warmed him from the inside. He let his eyes drift shut, and his legs wrapped around Malfoy’s waist, pulling him in deeper, holding him closer. Hips snapped against his with a jerky, harsh rhythm, and Harry was lost to it. The scent of Malfoy, for that’s what he realized he’d been smelling, surrounded him. It filled his lungs with each burning breath, the flavor lingered on his tongue, and when Malfoy kissed him, it tasted sharp, and spicy, and a little sweet. Harry tasted him enthusiastically, suckling at his tongue, nipping at his lips, and exploring the feel of his mouth.
“Perfectly normal. You may not be able to smell your own pheromones on me, but after we have sex, you can tell. It makes you want all sorts of weird things.”
“So, if I were to learn how to control it, I could make people do things?” Harry asked, already imagining his revenge.
work on Malfoy. That he’d be completely at his mercy again, if Malfoy retaliated.
“If you need an Alpha, I’m… willing to help you.” His eyes flicked down to Harry’s mouth, and Harry wondered if he was releasing more of that minty scent on purpose, or if it was just a reaction to Harry’s heat. He noticed that Ginny stayed far from him when she noticed, and besides Malfoy, he hadn’t encountered another Alpha he might be compatible with. It was strange, knowing Smith was coming onto him,
He woke, gasping and covered in sweat. Between his legs, his own cock hung hard and heavy, and completely useless. He gripped it anyway, and jerked swiftly.
“I don’t know what’s going on with you, Potter, and it’s probably none of my business, but… You’re distracting me. I’m meant to be focusing on my school work, and you’ve been smothering the class with your blasted pheromones for
“Morning, Potter.”
about stopping Malfoy, about taking a potion, or even trying to push him away. It was almost more terrifying than the thought of being held down and forced.
He was determined to keep Malfoy from seeing just how strongly his pheromones affected him, even if it killed him.
Harry let out a guttural, throaty groan, and grabbed at the alabaster body, demanding more of the skin against him. Draco obliged, his chest pressed to Harry’s, and his teeth scraped at Harry’s neck. He bit gently over the pulse point, and then yanked his head away, his whole body going still.
“Mind your own business, Potter.” Malfoy said, his tone not nearly as cutting as he’d probably meant it. He seemed tired. Harry imagined that holding him up and bringing them both off MUST have been exhausting. He didn’t remember if Malfoy had fallen asleep after their previous encounters. He’d always fallen asleep too quickly to mind what Malfoy was doing.
“Well… How’d it go?” Silver eyes were guarded, and Harry was careful how he chose his words.
, to relaxed and
too warm to be wearing so many clothes. He couldn’t see any problem with Smith’s approach, except that it was rather slow. He thought of how Malfoy had just grabbed him and got on with things. He rather liked that, he thought.
“PREG-” He shouted, before Hermione shushed him, and he lowered his head, returning to a whisper. “Pregnant? That’s ridiculous! You’re barely eighteen!” He said, indignant. Harry smiled dryly at his friend.
Luna nodded, her liquid blue eyes knowing.
, the scent screamed. Harry felt his pulse quicken and his breathing become shallow, labored.
“It means I’m a freak that can get pregnant.” Harry retorted, embarrassed.
“Well… You are taking your contraceptives every morning, aren’t you?”
"It's not that you smell
“I guess.” He shrugged, and looked over at Harry. “Cool with you?”
“No. Not at all, I just…”
With that, she snatched a handful of floo powder, and disappeared in an angry shout and blaze of green flames. Harry sat for a moment, feeling a lump rise in his throat. She just refused to believe that he was through with her, and it was breaking his heart more than the knowledge of both their infidelities.
“Nothing’s wrong, Harry.” Hermione answered immediately, and Harry narrowed his eyes, suspicious of her tone. They were at Hermione’s door, and Ron came to a stop, holding it open.
“You see the difference?”
“Painful. Unstoppable. Exhilarating until you can’t think anymore.” He corrected. Harry felt the idea tingling inside him still, arousing him. He couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to smell Draco in a rut. It was already overwhelming to encounter his pheromones when Harry himself was in heat.
“Alright. Sunday.” Harry shrugged. He didn’t ask what time. He knew it wouldn’t matter.
“Sorry about last night. I was just… surprised.” He apologized, and Harry shrugged. He didn’t particularly want to talk about it in front of half the school.
“Then… Do you want to just… help me?” He said, meeting the steel-colored stare without wavering. Malfoy’s face twisted, and he let his head fall back with another groan.
“It’s fine, Draco, I’m not going to drop him.” He said, and a moment later, froze, realizing how familiar he’d been. For a moment, he’d been so lost in the moment, he’d forgotten Ginny, he’d forgotten the baby’s mother, and he’d forgotten that Draco was no longer the man he craved. They’d both changed. He’d gotten over his violent sexual urges, and seemed to have gotten over all sexual urges at all. He figured it was really for the best, since Ginny didn’t want children, not to risk it.
?” He asked, as if he understood, but didn’t quite believe it.
“Ron… Would you… be willing to help teach Harry about it, with… erm… a demonstration?” Her cheeks went a bit pink again, but Ron looked at her with a lifted brow.
“I heard you had a son! I’m sorry about your wife, though...” Ginny said, suddenly full of curiosity. Harry rolled his eyes, not bothering to voice his opinion on the obvious trap Malfoy had set.
“I’m not taking the suppressant Potter.” Malfoy’s voice was firm, unyielding, and Harry licked his lips.
“If anyone prefers to sleep in a dorm with your classmates, rather than having their own rooms, that is acceptable, but you will be held to the regular curfew, so you do not disturb the other students. You will be allowed off of castle grounds on the weekends, out to Hogsmeade, or to visit home if you wish. These are privileges that I expect will not be abused. Am I clear?”
"About that, I'm still not quite sure I understand what that means. Why am I dominant? Is it because I'm male?" He asked, directing the question to Hermione.
He followed the sudden surge of bodies up the stairs, ignoring the chatter, and nodded mutely when Ron asked if he was okay. He forced a smile, but by Ron’s tight smile in return, he knew he’d done a poor job of it. After trudging up six floors, they all emptied into the hallway, and marched around the corner, to the hall their rooms would be in. He heard Dean and Seamus ahead of them crowing with delight that their rooms were next to each other. He heard Theodore Nott complain that the rooms had name plates on the door, and he wouldn’t get to browse for the best one.
“You’re acting funny.” Ron accused, and Hermione leaned forward, placing a hand on Ron’s arm. The sight of the familiar touch made Harry’s own too-warm skin suddenly burst with heat, and he wanted -
“Sorry, I’ve got to… I’ve got to go.” He smiled apologetically at Hermione and bolted for the door. It slammed shut behind him, and he breathed in the fresh cool air of the hallway. His head cleared of a fog he hadn’t realized had started to enter his thoughts, but his skin was still burning. He headed for his room.
Harry nodded, looking away. He didn’t care for the way being surrounded by the smell of his friend made him feel. It
“You should take time off of your classes until it is over. I assume, since you’ve been using suppressants, you have no Alpha partner?”
“Scent-marked?” Harry asked, and Malfoy’s glaring eyes shifted to him, lightened, and then he laughed.
In Charms, Professor Flitwick had been going over multi-wizard charms, and when he announced they’d be working on these in groups, Hermione had nearly slid off of her chair with excitement. Harry didn’t get the big deal about it, and was horrified when their little group of three was offered an unwanted fourth by Flitwick himself.
know what we’ve been at, hm? Will that make you happy?” Harry mocked as he scooted off of the bed and pulled the sheet with him. He wrapped it around himself for modesty as he walked toward the bathroom.
sleeping together. He could smell it on himself, too. Malfoy’s scent was stronger now that he was in heat again, and even knowing that he’d slept with Malfoy only a few days ago did nothing to quell the warmth pulsing through him, growing with every heartbeat. It wasn’t at its worst quite yet, but he knew it would wake him up later. He wondered if Pomfrey would give him a sleeping potion instead, but was loath to face her again for long enough to ask, He didn’t want to risk more invasive suggestions.
“Er, not really. Like, with me, you could probably stop me doing something, but… I wouldn’t kiss you, no offense.” Ron said, making it a joke. Harry frowned, but realized with a strange lurch of his stomach that Ron’s words rang true. His pheromones had been comforting, they’d been smothering, but they didn't make Harry want to spread his legs the way Malfoy’s had.
Malfoy’s voice grew slightly sharper, warning, and Harry held his breath, suddenly realizing how quickly it had been coming. He forced his eyes open and sat up. It was eerily similar to the first time, when he’d kicked Draco out of the bed. He looked down at the grey eyes that stared up at him from the pillow. He’d been lying on Malfoy, using his shoulder as a pillow, his body nearly draped atop the blond’s. His eyes took in everything: messy platinum hair, lips pink and slightly swollen from kissing, bruises across his body where Harry had bitten him back, the thin silvery scars that were more visible in the morning sunlight than they had been at night, and the sheet draped haphazardly over his hips and legs as if it had been an afterthought.
“You mean… Everytime I go into heat… I’m going to want to go
“Er… a charm?” Harry prompted, hoping to avoid whatever strange tension had been between the two of them all day. He could imagine what it was, and was trying desperately not to think about it.
"So you can't smell me?"
Draco stood, shaking, for a moment and caught his breath. Harry clung to him, arms wrapped around his shoulders, suddenly aware that Malfoy and the wall were all that kept him from dropping straight to the floor. The sweltering sensation of his heat was passing, leaving his skin sweaty and cooling in the empty classroom.
“No!” Harry shouted, causing Pomfrey to startle at the sudden noise. “Er… No thank you.” Harry waved his hands as if he could erase the idea from her brain. “I appreciate the thought, but… I’m fine.”
"About you and Malfoy?" She asked, and waited for his single brief nod before she answered. "Hmm… I think… I first noticed… that time Ron and I were over at yours, and he showed up. You hid it really well, but… there were signs. The way you kept looking at each other, for one. It wasn't exactly NICE, but it was different from how you used to do. Then there were the little comments that seemed like inside jokes that neither of you actually found funny." Hermione answered, thinking back. Harry easily recalled the night she meant. It had been the first of a few similar evenings, where Malfoy had joined him and his friends for a very strange gathering… though it had been entirely unplanned.
After classes, Ron practically dragged Harry into Hermione’s room, and sat him down before the fire, eyes wide and eager for the story that didn’t really exist.
"I don't care what you do. " He asserted, even as he looked the other over, inspecting the changes that his three years away had brought.
“Nothing’s wrong, Gin. I promise I won’t let him goad me into a fistfight.” Harry promised with a forced chuckle. He couldn’t let that happen for multiple reasons. “Just want a quick word about party etiquette.”
“How many potions do you take at once?” She asks, and he shrugged.
“I’d heard he was back in the country, so I invited him. I know that before he left, you two were sort of becoming… well, not ‘friends’, but… I just thought it would be nice to invite him.” Ginny gave him a look full of meaning, and Harry, for the life of him, couldn’t figure out what meaning that was. He looked around for Hermione to interpret, but she was at the far end of the room. He shook his head slowly, and pasted his best smile on. He couldn’t disappoint Ginny after she’d gone to so much trouble for this party.
“You don’t have to worry about Ron. I’m not going to sleep with him.” Harry said laughing.
“Oh. Er. I suppose.” Harry said, imagining for a moment what Hermione might smell like. Parchment WAS about right, he thought. “Luna, can I ask you something?”
“What are YOU doing here?” He asked. Ginny patted his arm reassuringly.
“Pomfrey actually said there was one other dominant in school. An Alpha. Do you know them?” Harry asked, suddenly bursting with curiosity. Wondering if he’d be able to tell if he walked past them.
“Harry! I was worried! Where were you?” Ginny was awake, despite that it was hardly past dawn, and for the first time since his lips had touched Draco’s the previous day, Harry felt a stab of guilt.
“You almost marked me.” Harry murmured in realization, the thought sending a shiver up his spine. The idea was thrilling, and terrifying. “You seem extra bitey today…”
. He took a deep breath, and tried to keep his own pheromones in check as Ron kept yelling.
“How long ago did you take the potion?”
“Harry, are you feeling alright? You’ve barely eaten all day.” Hermione murmured in a low voice, placing a hand on his arm. The warmth of it sent a tense shiver through Harry, and he jerked away.
smell.” Ron teased. “He wasn’t nearly as much of a dick today as he usually is. Strange, ‘cause he was definitely acting pissy.”
Malfoy. The blond let out a warning growl, and Harry lowered his head, looking at Malfoy from under his lashes. The urge to be playful was almost as strong as the urge to squeeze himself closer. Malfoy closed his eyes again and took a deep breath.
“No, I remembered, I just… I’m kind of trying to keep it secret.” Harry admitted, feeling a small twinge of guilt at admitting to lying to his friends. “Do you think Ron will know? He’ll go ballistic if he finds out.”
“I… What? What do you mean?” Harry asked, his heart racing, and dread filling him. Ron couldn’t possibly-
Harry gulped. He couldn’t say no. Not only would he look like a cad, but he just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see the baby. And damn him, Malfoy knew it. He’d been had.
“Ginny… I slept there, with him. I slept with him. I cheated on you. I’m sorry.” Harry said, though he felt no regret. He knew what he’d done was immoral, that he should have waited until after he and Ginny were truly through, but… He didn’t regret it.
But that had been seven years ago. He closed his eyes, and tried to push the inconvenient memory away. He felt as if he was suffocated, trapped in the lift with Malfoy, and when it stopped, he knew it was cowardly, but he rushed from the confined space, toward the apparation point. He apparated straight home, and was through the door, calling out his arrival for his wife before he slowed. The house was silent. He paused, and listened. He could tell Ginny wasn’t home. He had no idea where she might be, but then, he remembered what she’d asked of him. Shit! He’d forgotten to stop by The Leaky Cauldron! He felt a brief stab of relief that she wasn’t home, that he’d be able to go and come back before she realized he’d forgotten. He didn’t want another row with her. Especially when he felt so troubled after running into Malfoy. He was sure he’d say something across the line of bickering, and right to hurtful.
“It woke me up, so I took a potion to stop it. Nothing else helps.” He shrugged. Pomfrey looked confused for a moment more, then her eyes narrowed in suspicion.
“Er… Never.” Harry wondered if perhaps she’d gone barmy. Why would ANYONE suffer through that awful heat without a potion? He sure as hell wouldn’t.
"So is this what it's like, then? Being able to SMELL everyone? All the time?" Harry mumbled, depressed.
“More or less.” Malfoy shrugged. “At least it’s only one day, at most. Consider yourself lucky. When I go into a rut, it won’t matter who I sleep with or how many times I come, it’ll still last for three days, and I’m likely to rape any Omega that gets near me.” He sounded disgusted with himself, and Harry felt a pang of sympathy. Without thinking, he found his hand resting on Draco’s thigh with only the sheet separating their skin, comforting his Alpha.
The scent hit him like a physical force, stopping him in his tracks once again. He looked around, trying to find the source, but there was only Malfoy, hand no longer on the knob, but eyes still locked on Harry. It was dim in the torchlit corridor, but Harry thought his eyes were too dark. It was unsettling. He tried to take another step. His feet moved sluggishly, and his eyes wouldn’t stray from the sight of Malfoy watching him like a tiger about to pounce. Harry could feel his heart stuttering in his chest, could feel the sweat drip down his neck, feel his throat bob as he swallowed, his mouth too dry. The whole hall was filled with that scent. It was sharp, spicy, and almost hurt to breathe. He was at his door, his fingers gripped around the knob when Malfoy finally moved. His head lowered and he stalked across the hall, looking murderous. Harry fumbled to open his door, feeling far too overwhelmed to fight with Malfoy. The knob turned, the door swung inward, and as he stepped through, Malfoy was right there, in front of him, pupils blown wide, jaw clenched tight, and Harry could see the jumping pulse at his neck. He licked his lips, wanting to taste that fluttering beat.
“It’s funny, really. None of them can see you’re not really smiling. Some friends.” Malfoy was next to him, ordering another drink for himself, and his voice was pitched low enough for only Harry to hear. Harry pretended he hadn’t heard, and managed to keep his lips stretched in false happiness. But Malfoy seemed determined to ruin his night further.
- to be touched.
The sharp reminder made the smile fall from Harry’s face. His stomach twisted with discomfort, and he fought the urge to look around, to see who else might be glancing covertly at their classmates. He’d done his damnedest since he’d learned at the age of thirteen that he was not just a normal boy to forget everything Pomfrey and Dumbledore had tried to explain to him. He took a suppressant potion every day, and tried not to think about what people would say if they knew. He’d occasionally heard, throughout the years, of others’ designations, but it never made him feel any less of a freak. Afterall, boys weren’t supposed to be able to get pregnant.
“I have to go.” Harry announced, turning to flee. It was too much. It was all too much. The worst part was that he knew, if he’d never married Ginny, if Malfoy had never moved to France, their hurricaine of an affair would have ended in flames, and Harry would not be here, wanting a child that wasn’t his, and a man that he’d pushed aside. The irony was another slap to the face. He’d married Ginny, hoping she could give him a family, give him kids, knowing Malfoy never could, and now, everything he’d wanted was in Malfoy Manor.
“Er… Yeah. Thanks.” Harry finally managed to express. He shifted uncomfortably on Malfoy’s lap, desperately wanting to flee. To his shock, there was a strange pulling sensation, and Malfoy’s flaccid length slipped free, leaving Harry straddling him for a heartbeat with nothing trapping him in place.
Harry woke from the dream of that memory in a foul mood. He knew going to Malfoy Manor had been a terrible idea. He went through the motions of getting ready for work, and spent the morning nursing a stress-induced headache. He wished, for a split second, that some dark wizard would appear, to take his mind off  the dark, tumbling thoughts that seemed to consume him.
Harry let the words fall like a bomb, watched Hermione’s eyes go wide and sympathetic as she realized what it meant. He watched Ron nearly fall out of his chair, and splutter for a moment trying to find his words.
Harry backed him against the desk, pleased that the blond was kissing him back. He wasn't bothering to struggle as he grabbed back at him, pulling, biting, and desperately trying to get closer to Harry. He lifted the blond easily to sit on the desk, and wedged himself between parted thighs. Between frantic hands, and pressing bodies, Harry managed to move Malfoy’s robes around his hips, and quickly undid his trousers. With a bit of wiggling from the blond, the pants were discarded to the floor, and they both began working on Harry’s Auror robes. Harry ignored the way his hands shook nervously, fumbling to open the fly of his pants, cursing the many buttons of his work uniform.
He moved even closer, and Harry realized they must be standing by the wall, as he suddenly found himself trapped between it and Smith. The dark brown eyes were going darker as his pupils flared, and Harry licked his lips in anticipation. He couldn’t seem to think properly. Smith smelled amazing, he was attractive, and Harry was far,
"Do-you-miss-it." Draco repeats, enunciating each word slowly for Harry's benefit. He raises the thin silver sliver of his eyebrow, waiting for awareness to colour Harry's voice.
"Please, father!" Draco whines, his entire body trembling. Draco's hands are hooked onto the tops of his thighs like claws, fingers digging into his legs hard enough to draw blood. "Please."
This is the most formal proposition that Harry has ever encountered but it's so utterly Draco that he's completely charmed by it. His mouth is dry and he has to swallow hard before he can speak.
The dank dungeon is exactly as Harry recalls it; he can only just stand in the middle of the room at his full height, the low ceiling brushing the tips of his hair, and it's as if he's journeyed back in time some several months.
"What's this for?"
The stag starts to falter, the definition around the edges bleeding away. Ah, Draco thinks, there was a wound that was still sore.
I am soooo sorry that this has taken the longest time to post. So sorry, hope you all enjoy, love you loads.
Incredible, Harry thinks, how untouched the castle and grounds appear. The Battle of Hogwarts had taken a toll on the school, he'd witnessed it first-hand but you'd never know it now; a third of it had been reduced to piles of rubble, crumbling ruins of a home he loved dearly. He'd walked the grounds himself in those early days after the battle and observed the start of the clean up but he couldn't revel in winning. It felt like he'd lost everything else for the necessity of that victory.
"I'd ask you not to spread that around, Potter. People will start making the wrong assumptions about me and then where will I be, I wonder?"
"Nothing too dramatic, Malfoy." Harry warns, wary eyes watching Draco test the unfamiliar weight of the wand. "It doesn't have to be anything fancy, a simple Disarming spell will do it."
“Why not?”
And that's it. No little joke, as Dumbledore may have done. No announcements for the coming year. When McGonagall returns to her place, there is an array of reactions. Some of the older students who fought in the battle are softly weeping for their fallen friends, some clap and cheer as loud as they can, others simply have no idea how to react to the words at all, dazedly staring about the room.
"Has he been giving you trouble?"
Harry is panting and has to brace his hands on his knees, "I - have a - proposition - for you."
Hermione’s eyes dart from Harry to Draco to Ron, utterly startled. Her reply comes as hesitantly as Draco’s address is to her, her tone cautious.
The boggart-Harry is meant to be dead, that much is certain. Those dirt stained clothes tug at the edge of Harry’s memory, as does the bruises on its face, the cut on its cheek. It only clicks into place when he notices that there’s a crack in the lens of the boggart’s glasses - only then does he realise that he’s staring down at a perfect replica of how he appeared to the gathered crowd when Hagrid had carried his motionless body out of the forest at Voldemort’s behest last year.
"But this won't change anything!"
Harry doesn't take his eyes or wand off of Lucius Malfoy, not even as he morphs into a dementor.
“Yes?”
“Honestly, Ronald, sometimes I really despair of -”
now?" Draco splutters and his look of sheer indignation alone is enough to send Harry into a laughing fit.
The next morning, a bleary eyed Harry heads downstairs to the common room to find Hermione and Ron already waiting for him. They spring away from each other the minute they spot him, their hands - clinging together only seconds earlier - finding other tasks to busy themselves with.
something you want. From me, I mean." He looks up at Harry then, pupils blown wide and dark so that only a thin band of grey remains around its perimeter.
Harry's voice comes tenderly, "I think maybe with time, you can. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking when I suggested we come up here. I should have realised."
“Thank you, Potter.”
"What exactly makes you think that
All around them, other students are clambering joyously onto the Hogwarts Express, staking their claim on compartments. The festive mood isn't enough to dispel the shock their peers initially experienced at seeing Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy standing
Harry doesn't. He tosses the apple about between his hands for a minute, getting a feel for its weight and size, ignoring Draco tutting with impatience from above.
"Oh, yeah. Brilliant." Harry tells her distractedly. "I'll be back in a minute, I just need to..."
“Is he making any progress with his boggart?” Hermione asks, as if reading Harry’s mind, gently turning the page of the heavy volume balanced on her knees. Ron, with the vacant look of someone
Hermione thankfully lets it slide, "It must be tough for him being here after everything." she offers diplomatically, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
Draco seemed to understand that, too. It was only when they were travelling back up to Hogwarts in one of the carriages, Harry drowsy and eager for his own bed as the castle had drawn ever nearer, did Draco’s voice snag at Harry’s attention and reel him awake.
And it's so simple, unpolluted by their history. The kiss will never wipe their slate clean but possibility fills Harry with something as close to the sort of hope he hasn't felt in a long time. Draco pulls back and now, there is no trace of uncertainty to cloud his expression but instead a smile of his own, tentative and sweet.
"Thank you, Harry." Hermione smiles in satisfaction. "I think a lot of prejudices against muggles can be addressed directly if we made Muggle Studies a compulsory lesson. Why should flying be mandatory when we're co-existing with muggles our entire lives? I think it would be highly beneficial if students were given the opportunity to learn more about living without magic and seeing things in a new perspective."
"Yes, I know that Professor but I was - "
"I don't," Draco says with a smirk. "But thank you."
Harry runs a hand through his already untidy hair, ruffling it into a state of utter chaos. Draco hates him, from the tips of that preposterous hair down to the feet decked out in trainers that are practically falling apart at the seams. He hates him so much that it circles back around to love again. Hopeless, desperate, unrelenting love.
"You don't have to do that, you kn-kn-know." Harry says, pausing to expel a tremendous yawn. "I know you're together already - or have you forgotten that inappropriately timed kiss during the battle? Or the entire summer I spent with you at the Burrow? What about the journey here on the Hogwarts Express when you were making those faces at each other?"
. Together. Look around to your neighbours. We are not four houses in competition with each other. We are
"Of course I know, you git! I heard you come back in the dormitory around five."
Harry can't help but smile, "You wish."
"Draco, you don't have to do this."
“What? Enemy?” Harry shakes his head again. "I reckon that stopped being true a long time ago, Draco. Maybe longer than either of us thought. I’m not good, I’m not a hero. Right now, in this room, I'm finally just Harry," he says. "And you're just Draco."
"Just - just act like I'm not here or something."
Harry smirks into his shoulder while he flies down to scoop up the apple dropped in the surprise, "It's just a little friendly competition."
"WHAT IF I SAID I COULD GET YOUR WAND BACK?"
"To sweep the floor with." Draco says flatly, smoothing a stray strand of hair back into its rightful place. "Flex your imagination a little, Potter. I'm challenging you to a game of one on one Quidditch, obviously. That's no Firebolt but it's the best I could dredge up."
"But - "
Harry watches the knuckles on Draco's hand grow impossibly white, his fingers squeezing as if to snap Harry's arm in two.
October has brought with it not only the bad weather but also the first Quidditch match of the year - Gryffindor versus Hufflepuff - an event that has had the whole school buzzing with anticipation for the past week. With the majority of their peers cheerfully braving the storm outside, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for another of Draco's lessons, a chance to
It was nicer still seeing Draco shed his armour, as tough as it was to the shell of a Blast Ended Skrewt, until he could laugh freely - at least, laugh
"I should have known you were not up to the task. It was foolish of me to expect anything more."
"See!" Hermione bristles, slapping a palm onto the table. "See, Ron? Harry isn't making excuses."
"Sure thing, sir." Harry says just as Ron mouths "
Draco looks down; long brown fingers, bony like the rest of Potter, cover Draco's hand. He doesn't have to see his own knuckles to know they're bone white; he feels the cool bite of the metal beneath his clenched fingers digging into the skin of his palms. The warmth radiating from Potter's hand seems to be spreading through the entirety of Draco's body, leaving behind a pleasant tingling.
THESE ARE MY CONFESSIONS: by dint of an ongoing battle between me and technology, I lost basically all of my chapter outlines/chunks of stuff I was really freaking happy with for this fic
