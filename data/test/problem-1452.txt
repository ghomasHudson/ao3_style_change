And then they’re on each other again, hungry for more, while Harry’s clumsy fingers start unbuttoning Draco’s shirt and pale fingers sneak under Harry’s t-shirt. Draco is always so warm and Harry whimpers when his hot palm strokes his back, dipping lower, squeezing Harry’s arse.
He decides to go and see Ron, but he takes his Invisibility Cloak as he apparates to Diagon Alley. The shop is jam-packed and it takes him a while to get Ron’s attention without being seen by other customers. They hide in a room at the back, full of boxes and parcels and Harry takes the cloak off.
“It’s okay,” he said and then Potter stood up and groaned, and Draco couldn’t help but notice the evident bulge at the front of his trousers.
“I’ll get bored of you and discard you as soon as I’m done fucking you,” Draco says, a smirk on his lips. “I prefer stronger men anyway, like Marelli. He’s alive and has no trouble getting his cock up. I’ll abandon you like everyone else. You’re not worth keeping.”
“Miffy,” Malfoy calls when the massive clock in the corner of the room chimes midday, making Harry jump. A decrepit house-elf appears, making Harry wonder if she’s actually older than Kreacher. “Could you bring me some lunch? Yesterday’s leftovers will suffice.”
“Yeah,” Harry admits. “I’d love to. Madam Hooch is coming back to work in two weeks, then I am pretty much free.”
“Unless you need time alone with Ron,” Harry says, wondering if she was actually trying to get some time with her boyfriend. Hermione’s cheeks darken and she looks away, staring at her shoes.
“Show-off,” he muttered, shaking his head and earning a smirk from Potter, who emerged from his cloak with ruffled hair (even worse than usual, surprisingly enough) and his bright green eyes. He was still short and skinny, his hair a dark mess on his head, but there were dark circles under his eyes, a tired look on his face. As if the end of the war didn’t quite agree with him.
“Are we going to live together then? In Italy?” Harry asks hopefully, pressing their foreheads together.
“There’s no ink, though,” Harry observes, but Malfoy huffs and then starts writing on his sheet of parchment. Although there’s no ink, the quill still writes. It’s a faded scribble in Malfoy’s elegant cursive. Harry looks at it and frowns.
“Why are you laughing?” Harry asks, his fingertips tracing the shape of Draco’s lips, his thumb sliding over delicate skin.
“I’ll do it,” Harry blurts out, standing up and moving closer to Draco, “I’ll get you pregnant. Or I’ll take the fertility potion and carry your baby.”
Draco eventually sits on the sofa, covering his face with his hands and sighing, his shoulders tense and his fingers trembling slightly. Harry moves slowly and sits down next to him, placing a gentle hand on his back.
They eat, and Malfoy asks a million questions about seasoning and stirring, about ingredients and cooking times. Harry answers, and then Malfoy summons parchment and quill and starts taking notes in his elegant, slanted cursive.
Draco brushes his hands away and Harry hears the rustling sound of fabric, but he’s too busy tasting Draco, sucking on his bottom lip and making him gasp to worry about how long Draco’s taking to get rid of his robes.
“I need to speak to McGonagall,” Malfoy replies, drying his hands on a kitchen towel. “I don’t think I want to be a Potions Master anymore, but I’m not sure what to do either.”
are there with me, Draco. And I’m not settling when it comes to you. You’re all that I want—a dream come true.”
“Cat got your tongue, Potter?” Malfoy smirks. “Were you expecting a couple of old tomes and an easy job?”
“Just leave it with me,” he says, looking competent and so bloody sexy that Harry practically climbs onto his lap to snog him senseless.
“Harry, there’s a bruise on your neck,” Kingsley replies calmly, “and several on his. I wrongly assumed you had been fighting. I just wanted to make sure you two were not hurting each other. I was not expecting to find out that you’re lovers.”
“Yes, especially the adrenaline rush and the chance to beat you,” Malfoy answers, making Harry laugh.
“That’s the easiest part, then,” Harry says with a smile. “Because you have me, for as long as you want. I’m yours to keep. And I wonder every day if I am worthy of you, too.”
“Okay,” Harry says, stepping out of the car and nearly getting run over by a bicycle zooming past him. “What the fuck, oi!”
Chloe takes a wooden box out of her handbag and hands it to the Minister, who opens it, revealing Draco’s hawthorn wand. Kingsley casts a complex spell on it, different from the one Harry heard the Aurors and Marelli cast in the past few months. The wand gleams orange, then pink and purple. Chloe hands the box to Draco, who lets go of Harry’s hand and takes it hesitantly.
He contemplates just telling Hermione everything, but instead he books an appointment with a specialist in male-pregnancy at St Mungo’s and starts taking his fertility potion every morning.
“I’m in love with you,” Harry interrupts him. “I fucking love you so much, and I’ve never loved anyone like this in my whole life. So please don’t ever suggest that again, or I’ll have to hex you and then kiss you better.”
Harry gets rounder and bigger and that particular winter is cold, so he wraps up warm and struggles to stand on his feet during a night watch.
Draco’s silver eyes shine in the light of the fire, the shimmering fabric of the invisibility cloak making him look almost ethereal as he leans closer, closing his eyes.
“You’ve never bottomed before?” Draco asks in disbelief and Harry nods, embarrassed. “Wait, what? Are you sure you want to do this with me?”
Harry comes inside him, fingers digging into the soft flesh of Draco’s waist as he fills him with his release. And Draco follows soon after, Harry’s name on his lips as he paints the bedsheets with his come.
Harry walks back home, thinking about the unexpected encounter, and then he decides to go and pay a visit to Andromeda, his old Auror habits suggesting that he needs to learn more, to investigate.
Draco’s eyes lock with his for a few seconds, warmer than they’ve ever been, and then he moves again. He spreads Harry’s legs carefully, kneeling between them. He conjures more lube and coats his fingers with it, taking a deep steadying breath as he circles Harry’s entrance with his middle finger, stroking him gently. It feels weird at first, but then Draco’s delicious lips kiss the tip of Harry’s cock.
"Because – Harry, because it's Malfoy. Hell, jump back five years and you'd be spitting chips at having to be in the same room as him."
Glancing up at her, Harry met Pansy's gaze for only a brief moment before her own dropped to Draco. Or returned to Draco, as was more likely. She was one of the few that Harry hadn't noticed had significantly eased in relentless tension with the passing of exams; while Blaise seemed to have grown a little more comfortable, even edging slightly away from his self-imposed ostracism, Pansy hadn't. Not yet. Maybe not ever.
"Talk to me later," Dot said, ignoring Harry entirely and pointing her pen at Draco. "I'm not utterly oblivious, but even so."
Lifting his head from Draco's shoulder, Harry smiled. "Sure," he said, squeezing Draco's hand one more time. "Let's leave ASAP, yeah? But, just a thought – do you think we could maybe take the bus back to the museum? I'm not too keen on trying this Apparition thing again."
Jackie snickered, slumping back into her seat with her feet returning to the dashboard. Harry ignored her. As his discomfort for shift of city life settled, he felt the excitement that had been building within him since they'd decided upon the visit at the end of the previous term. The excitement for what they would see, what they would discover, and what it could mean.
"Alcohol really brings out the worst in you, Ron," Ginny said, shaking her head exaggeratedly. "You bastard. To think, my own brother."
A/N: WARNING - this chapter contains queerphobia and the use of queerphobic slurs. Sorry about that.
Jackie and Pansy weren't exclusive – or at least not to one another. To Jackie's not-so-silent satisfaction, Pansy appeared to approve of her bluntness and, more so in Harry's opinion, her bloodthirstiness. Harry had never quite understood Jackie's fascination with all things grim and gritty, but it seemed to have done her well in this instance. Pansy had actually smiled at Jackie that week.
To his credit, Draco wasn't openly smirking at him. There was an amused crinkle to his eyes, but he was otherwise nothing but considerate in pretending that he didn't find the entire situation laughable. He even when so far as to place a hand atop of Harry's, squeezing it gently. "It's apparently worse to do Side-Along Apparition -"
Harry didn't glance up from his book, but he paused in his reading. "That's no reason to treat him like shit."
"Exactly." Von sighed, teeth flashing almost blindingly for the width of his smile. "I've never been so happy in my life. She hasn't even got any talent; it's no secret that she only got a foot in at
Sighing, Harry's shoulders slumped. "It's not like I actually wanted to hide anything from you. It just happened."
"Perish the thought," Harry said with an emphatic shudder. "I definitely need to find my own again, then."
"- would end like this." Malfoy glanced sidelong towards Terpsichore's portrait and tipped his head in an acknowledging nod. "Thanks are in order, I suppose."
From the voice – unfamiliar and youthful – it was likely an intern given the regrettable duty of contacting him. Draco had been made a full and independent employee of the company months ago, a position he was already considering dropping in pursuit of freelancing, but even with only months under his belt, he knew he had a reputation for one-track-mindedness. Dimitri made a running joke of it.
Dragging himself upright, Draco scrubbed his face briefly and rolling from bed. He stopped briefly in the kitchen to inhibit a kettle catastrophe before heading to the shower and proceeding to drown himself in searing water for the next ten minutes. It didn't exactly leave him refreshed, but he was markedly more so than he'd been before.
"Yeah. Aren't aristocrats supposed to be, I don't know, reserved about that sort of thing?" Harry swung their hands idly, a distraction that didn't quite work. "All hard love and never admitting their feelings or something?"
Draco smiled. A genuine smile that, though it wasn't wide, held a hint of warmth. "Wonderful, actually. And grateful."
one of them?" Harry asked, glancing once more towards the phone. "Yeah, that's definitely him. Sorry, Ron."
Her leg stilled from its jiggling, and Harry felt himself freeze along with it. As Gertrude stared at him, her gaze intent and abruptly absent of the bright bubbliness that Harry had beheld from so many interviewers, he felt the hairs rise on the back of his neck.
The hubbub of the entire student body was a buzzing storm of voices rebounding throughout the Entrance Hall. Walking alongside Ron and Hermione, Harry glanced at it only briefly as they descended the stairs. Travel pack slung over his shoulder with little more than the bare necessities packed, he was barely aware of where his feet took him or what either of his friends were saying. Just as it had been for the last week, his mind was decidedly elsewhere. Decidedly fixed upon someone else.
They were about to step through the open door of Quality Quidditch when Teddy nodded discreetly to James, who winked at Albus, who leaned over to Lily and whispered, "Do it!"
"Don't be dense, Harry." Draco rolled his eyes. "There are anti-apparation wards around the Manor. You can't apparate out, much less with four children attached to you."
Draco stepped into the floo, one arm wrapped around the box and the other hand holding Scorpius's. "Tomorrow? But-"
After both women had gone, Draco watched them walk sedately down the hall toward the guest suites speaking in quiet, solemn tones.
Draco stopped straining his neck to make sure the kids left the poor white peacocks alone to stare at Harry open mouthed. "You are fucking with me."
Watching the exchange from his place leaning against a bookcase, Teddy just shook his head. Lily could be right scary sometimes. Especially when it came to her ability to manipulate. No wonder she and Scorpius got along so well. They were both masters at it.
Harry watched him return with a deep purple velvet bag that looked just big enough to fit one or two of the books and not much more. He frowned. "How are we going to take them all out of here in that?"
"Here we are!" he called plastering on a smile to hide the emotions still roiling through him. Three of the four children turned their whole and undivided attention toward him. "These are the stables. Let's go meet the horses, shall we?"
"It's alright, Father," Draco interrupted sharply with a dismissive wave of the hand. "She came from a good family, good blood, and we got on relatively well. You couldn't have known, just like I couldn't have known. We survived, me and Scorpius. Everything worked out fine." He quickened his pace, striding away from his unhappily frowning father and toward the stables finally in view.
Ron wasn't so brave and contented himself with covert chuckles hidden behind his napkin. He was the one that had to sleep with Hermione after all, he didn’t want to have to do it with one eye open watching for retribution.
Harry had to agree with them. It was a really nice tank. He wouldn't have minded living in there himself. The snakes were impressive too.
"Yes, Master, it is working, sir." Shotzy nodded, his ears bouncing. "Shotzy fixed it this morning."
"That's right, my dear," Narcissa agreed softly, drawing Hermione's attention as she tucking a wild lock hair behind the younger woman’s ear. "We're just glad we were able to help you. You just needed someone to talk to. Someone that knew what you were going through."
Dinner went on relatively smoothly after that and soon various people were standing up and helping Molly clear away the plates and empty dishes from the table.
Andromeda paused and took a sip of her tea gathering her thoughts. "I didn't see a reason to mention it, because you were happy with her, but she didn’t have the same kind of strength that you do. You’re a survivor. No matter what life throws at you, you pick yourself up and keep going. Ginevra wasn’t like that,” she explained regretfully.
He'd watch as his grave faced father stepped toward the bed and carefully lifted the silent bundle from her nearly limp arms. "I know, Narcissa," he’d replied quietly, leaning forward to bury his nose in his wife’s sweat damp hair a moment before pulling away. "I know."
They sat in silence for a time before Draco decided he had better dispel the heavy atmosphere again. Moving his hand form Harry's shoulder up to ruffle his thick, surprisingly soft hair, he grinned. "So, Mr. Potter, you are a successful business investor, eh?"
“Hadn’t been friendly” was an understatement if ever he heard one. Tried to bloody kill each other, more like.
The kids all stared at him in amazement then their faces cracked in wide grins. "We're actually family!" Albus cheered.
"Harry!" Ron popped his head into the living room with a smudge of what looked like flour on his cheek and a frilly pink apron tied around his waist. "I thought I heard your brood barreling through here."
They sat in comfortable silence for a time as Dudley contemplated these new prospects. The situation didn't seem quite so dire now. Suddenly a thought occurred to him and he frowned looking around the kitchen confused.
Albus and Lily hurried over to him and began pulling and pushing and jiggling, too. Still it stayed closed. "Why won't it open?" Lily gasped, panting from exertion.
"Well..." The sound of Dudley shifting uncomfortably could be heard in the background. "She's kind of why I called you."
Settling back again, Harry thought over what Dudley had told him. "You know, Dudley, we could just find out now if she is a witch or not."
"Seriously?" Harry blurted out lamely. He hadn't realized that Draco had been waiting nervously on top of him while he spent an inordinate amount of time processing this new revelation.
Harry watched him with some amusement then rolled his eyes. Carefully, he pulled another tattered looking book from its place and opened it to read the first page bearing words. The writing was completely by hand and in a sharp swirling script that was very difficult to read. Eventually, Harry deciphered the lone paragraph on the title page.
"No." Draco shrugged. "It's better to keep reinvesting the money and earning more than to let it sit and acquire dust in a vault miles under the ground. Keeps the economy running."
James yelped landing hard, his heart beating wildly in his chest as he tried to spit grass out of his mouth. "Ger-off me, Teddy!" He struggled to rollover and tossed the other boy off of him.
Harry just grinned wryly at him as they walked next to each other down Diagon Alley. They drew confused suspicious attention all the way down the Alley. "Yep, that's our Luna," he replied cheerily.
"Do you want to look at the journals and books? Or do you want to just pack them up?" he asked as he strode toward the shelves of Black family tomes, nearly twice as many as was in the Potter vault.
Harry was all fire and flame and tongue and teeth and hard thrusts and it was all Draco could do not to burn up with it. He just wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, threaded his fingers through his hair, and rode it out.
"Hugo, sweetie, that is just not going to fit into your mouth." Draco chuckled as the little boy tired to stuff the greater half of a single pancake into his small mouth. He had syrup all over his face and even a little bit in his fiery red hair.
"I've tried getting her to go, but she just gets angry again and locks herself up in her office at home." Ron sighed again, exhaustion and helplessness pinching at his face.
His grandmother had said that Draco and his family were Death Eaters and Harry hadn't denied it. The Malfoys couldn't be bad, though. They were so nice and Harry believed they weren't dangerous at all. Teddy liked them, too. Draco was completely awesome, and Miss Cissy was so kind, and Mr. Malfoy was, well, not
There was a startled gasp from said little boy and Teddy quickly stood from his chair without dislodging either of his snakes or his parrot. "Really? They sent my Hogwarts letter here?" he asked in excitement as he rushed toward Lucius, face bright.
Seeing the wisdom in this, Lucius quickly intercepted his wife and began dragging her back into the house.
Closing his eyes on the memories, Draco came back to the present to find Narcissa watching him as if she had gone on that journey with him and had known exactly what he had seen.
Merlin, I hope I translated everything right! Albus fretted internally as he kept his eyes firmly on his dad's back, dodging people as they leaped out of the way. He really wanted everything to go right, because he couldn't wait to see Scorpius again. He put on a burst of speed, his determination renewed.
"We can owl him," Albus suggested, sudden inspiration making his green eyes flash. "One of us can sneak up stairs to get Artemis then we can send Scorpius a note explaining the plan."
Harry sighed again. "Apparently the only time she'd spent any real length of time emotionally present had been when I was off of assignment. Other than that the kids were at yours, your parents, or fending for themselves. And I-... We stopped really loving each other a while ago, Ron. I'm sorry."
"Holy cra-um-cow!" the man amended quickly when he saw the look on his wife's face. "That was a bit different from going to Harry's."
“My Ted could never find his tie-tacks,” Andromeda reminisced fondly. “Of course, it never occurred to him to just
Immediately, the kids all made loud unintelligible sounds trying to make it seem like someone was losing and someone was winning the game in front of them. They more or less succeeded
Draco almost chuckled. At least this kid was more polite and a hell of a lot cuter than his father. He stood up and pulled the stool out from under the cash register. "Well, Albus, since you've already met my son, I'll introduce myself, shall I?" He grinned. "I'm Draco Malfoy and this is my shop you've stumbled upon. Let's get you seated up here so I can take a look at your hands, alright?"
“Now where in the devil did that woman put them?” he muttered under his breath as he stood and started pulling open drawers in the end tables and rummaging through them. “Damn it!
” she told him as she snuggled against his neck soaking up his body heat. She was pretty big already, longer than his arm span and just a smidgen thicker than his wrist. She was heavy enough that James's shoulders felt the weight.
Did he really want to spill his guts to a man he hadn't spoken to in ten years? An old school rival, a war enemy that up until ten minutes ago he couldn't have held a civil conversation with to save his life? Yes, apparently he did.
"No." Teddy shook his head. "I think we need to find out exactly what they did during the war," he decided.
"Lily Luna Potter! What on earth did you think you were doing?" he demanded sharply and Lily's grin disappeared. She flicked her eyes toward her brothers worriedly. They hadn’t planned on their father getting mad.
Turning away from the older couple and back toward the floo, Draco saw a beautifully smiling Harry watching him with shining green eyes, messy black hair, and four exhausted boys standing around him. Draco felt his heart beat painfully full in his chest and knew he’d have no problems following either of Arthur’s requests.
Carefully, he moved toward the imposing, dark wood desk and tentatively began shuffling through the papers on top of it. Lifting them up and gently putting them back down in exactly the same place when none of them held anything they wanted. He made it all the way through the loose papers on top the desk, then apprehensively started on the drawers.
Draco waved him off and stepped toward the little girl attached to him once again. "It was a pleasure to meet you, Miss Lily." He smiled at her.
"Eddy's getting into trouble at school again," Dudley replied, sounding like he couldn't decide whether to be annoyed or proud. "Apparently, he's got into a fight with another boy twice his size. Kicked the bloody shit out of him, too."
Lily jumped into action. Looking down at her belly where Belle had been curled around her waist underneath her dress all afternoon, she hissed the signal. Belle slid down her body to the ground and slithered off. Lily let out a high pitched squeal that made half the people in the Alley jump in surprise.
Harry spent the whole afternoon on the floo with Aurors, the Burrow, and the Ministry trying to find his son. After spending hours searching up and down Diagon Alley to no avail, he'd finally decided to take James and Lily home and resume the search there.
He leaned back and began tapping his chin in thought. "Have you made any advancements in your defense lines since the end of the war?" he asked.
"Hey, everyone," he chuckled awkwardly trying to dispel the tense atmosphere. "I'd like you to meet Draco and his son, Scorpius."
Harry let out a sound that was somewhere between a groan and whimper letting his forehead fall forward to land against Draco's chest. "I'm not really sure. I didn't think it was going to be quite that bad, but I figured it wasn't going to be all roses and hearts."
Molly observed him closely seeing all the things he wasn't saying and finding herself liking this mystery man more and more. "Have you seen him since then?" she asked.
The Manor? Molly frowned and stopped snapping. She turned all her attention on the knowledge of this nameless single father that lived in a
"God," he groaned after studying the family tree for a moment longer. "All you pure-bloods are related."
"I really didn't want that money and as we were getting off of the train I remembered Fred and George and tossed them the whole bag. Told them they could use it to start their business as long as they bought Ron some new dress robes first."
He could tell the separation was affecting them all. The kids had been grumpy and downtrodden, not to mention his own melancholy mood, but Harry couldn't bring himself to make that first step.
"Not at all, Harry." Luna smiled at him dreamily. "I wouldn't mind that. His letter said something about investing," she inquired.
"Teddy stays here, with me," he stated in no uncertain terms. "I consider him to be, and he is by law, my son. I think it would be better if he wasn’t there while you work through things. He stays with me."
"I need you to clarify the whole bloody thing!" the Minister said, scowling. "Someone in my Ministry is illegally requesting financial and business information from Lucius Malfoy?"
"I'm glad I'm here now, too," he said, almost chuckling at the wondering, happy look Scorpius gave him as he stood back up.
James scowled at him and snorted derisively before grudgingly holding his hand out to be shaken. "Nice to meet you, Mr. Malfoy," he sneered.
Harry stared at the magnificent sword as it glinted in the fire light, diamonds, blue topaz, and jacinth shone brightly embedded in the hilt
A whisper of sadness rose inside her, but it was alleviated by the thought of Harry once again being happy. "That's wonderful, dear. I'm happy for you. Have you known her long?"
Jolting slightly, Draco swallowed his own mouthful of food to give himself a moment to steady himself. "Oh, well. I have my own shop just off of Diagon Alley."
Harry stared at him incredulously for a moment before his face cleared with understanding. Lucius Malfoy was actually trying to be considerate of someone other than his own family and small children. He was trying to let Luna out of having to visit the Manor again after her imprisonment.
"It is ironic," he began after a time, "that they should dislike each other so ardently, fight against each other so viciously when they were children only to grow up, have children of their own and fall in love with one another."
"I was suspicious and short with him," she answered. "He took me by surprise, Harry. I'd never seen the boy in my life, I haven't seen his mother, my own sister, is decades and suddenly I find him in your kitchen baking cookies. Do you mind telling what is going on?" She gave him that penetrating stare Harry figured all mothers knew. It was the one that said they knew everything, they were just waiting for you to say it out loud yourself.
"Teddy could keep his at our house, Dad," James volunteered, getting more and more eager about the prospect of having a scaly pet.
Dudley sighed deeply. "We couldn't fucking find her anywhere in the house! Finally we started searching the neighborhood and we heard her screaming her head off from the roof of the bloody house." He whimpered a bit with the memory. Harry got the impression that Dudley was more frightened for his daughter’s safety than anxious about her possibly having magic.
Muggle-born children were coming into the Wizarding World knowing next to nothing about wizarding customs, history, tradition, or even how to function like a wizard. As a consequence they’re ignorant influence was losing the Wizarding World much of its culture to accommodate them.
"Of course, sweetheart." Narcissa smiled and scooted her chair back so there was room for the little girl to climb into her lap. "Hop up, and I'll call Tizzy to bring you some pumpkin juice."
Narcissa sighed in motherly exasperation, but smiled at the display all the same. Draco was really a natural with children. It amazed her. When he was a child he could be so ill tempered and demanding, but he had grown into a wonderful young man that put the ones he loved ahead of himself first and foremost.
Both children looked utterly entranced by her as she lead them off toward the gardens. Draco watched them with a wry smirk on his face. His mother could charm the stars from the sky if she really wanted them bad enough. Children were a piece of cake for her.
Lucius made a pained sound at that and looked like he was about to throw up. This man took his money way too seriously, Harry thought.
"Yeah." Harry smiled reassuringly. "There are quite a few muggleborns with wizards in their extended family that enroll at the primary schools. It helps with the transition into Hogwarts."
Hugo's brow furrowed in concentration until he finally looked at Draco with a very serious nod. "I want square," he said.
"What is it, dear?" Molly asked her voice pitched high with worry. "Is there a problem with the children?"
Harry's eyes almost bugged out of his head, but Draco just kept going seeming not to notice his stunned silence.
A strange look had crossed Narcissa's face when Draco mentioned the wife. She looked at her son then at the tea service before shaking her head again.
It couldn't continue on like this, he knew. They needed to be independent, fearless children again and it seemed that for that one day, at the Manor with Draco, Scorpius, Narcissa, and yes, even Lucius, they had been just that. They'd simply been children again.
Harry frowned as he answered. "Ginny didn't even want three. Said she didn't want to have so many kids like her parents." He shook the memories away and focused back on Draco. "Did you want more kids?"
Draco looked as though he was thinking for a moment as he threaded his fingers through Harry's hair. Drawing him close to press a soft kiss to Harry’s smiling lips, Draco replied, "I think it was the perfect gift, Harry. Well done."
Somewhat stunned, it took Lucius a moment to register what the Minister was saying. Then the cold fury came. "You were not aware of this to any extent? You did not sign that requisition and someone has been holding copies of my business dealings illegally for the past five years?" he asked with barely controlled power behind his voice. Surprisingly, he could feel his magic boiling inside of him. Lucius hadn't felt this out of control in quite a while.
"You mentioned matris," he remarked. "Does your research also cover them considering that they are actually men?"
“Narcissa, woman!” he shouted again as he came to the door. “Where in God’s name did you put my sapphire cufflinks? The ones with the pearls. I can’t find them-… anywhere,” he trailed off as he stepped into the room and saw who his wife was entertaining.
Pointing to Teddy, he ushered his godson forward and handed him his wand. Leaning forward he whispered in his ear then stepped back receiving an understanding nod from the little boy.
"Did Mum really run away ’cause she wanted ‘tropical drinks, beaches, and boys’?" Lily inquired innocently drawing a few scandalized looks from the two old biddies at the next table.
The older man seemed to take a moment to compose himself before continuing. "Very well. I request that you send her a warning of my correspondence, then kindly set up an alternate place to hold the meeting. We cannot have Miss Lovegood getting distracted with her Crumbling-Fanged Whatsits whilst conducting business."
. There was no spark of magical binding, no shift in the air, just the simple scratching of the quill.
Lucius got to the last letter and paused in surprise. It had a very familiar wax seal stamped on the back. For some reason he hadn't expected the letter to come to the Manor.
Draco just hoped they hadn't inherited Harry's academic ethic. Teddy was probably spared considering Professor Lupin had been an intelligent man and his mother was one of the youngest Aurors ever trained. He'd be fine at Hogwarts, but James and Albus were Potters through and through. He wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to skive off studying just as much as their father had.
Luna nodded sagely. "Yes, your letter said that. I would very much appreciate any investment Harry would like to make," she relied with mildly surprising coherency.
A laugh escaped Harry and he pointed to the stainless steel contraption plugged into the wall socket on the kitchen counter. "That's a toaster. You put breaded items in the slots and it toasts them for you."
Not that Lucius knew that, Narcissa thought wryly. Her poor husband would never be the same if that little tidbit of information got back to him. He was lucky that Narcissa loved him more than she hated his mother.
She scowled at him for it knowing exactly what he was doing, but nodded in defeat anyway. "Fine, you little devil. You can stay."
Lucius wouldn't admit it under pain of death, but he liked the noise in the Manor. The giggling and the pitter-patter of little feet. He'd missed it since Draco had gone to Hogwarts and hadn't realized until Scorpius was born and it had returned.
Harry marveled at how level his voice was. It was old news to Draco, his pain and anger had long since faded. Harry couldn't feel that unconcerned though. The thought that Draco’s wife, Scorpius’s mother, could be like that was enraging.
When he got there he was shocked speechless as the Minister of Magic pulled Harry into a tight hug, his wife kissing Harry on the cheek sweetly.
They all jumped in surprise and jerked their heads up to find Lucius Malfoy tapping his snake head cane against his shin idly, a wry smirk in his lips.
Harry took one look at his son's hopeful face and tried to fight down the panic. "I don't know, Mrs. Malfoy. Didn't you say he was dangerous?"
"Good morning." Draco smiled at him leaning down to place a kiss on his forehead before he did the same to Albus next to him then James and Teddy on the other side of the table. He got to Lily and she just wrapped her arms around his neck and traded kisses on their cheeks.
At their entrance Draco looked up from wiping syrup away from the corner of his mouth with an embroidered linen napkin. "Finally, I thought you had gotten lost." He grinned at them gesturing to the two chairs in the middle at the table. "Grab a seat. The elves made pancakes."
Narcissa hummed thoughtfully. "But how will they get here? The Manor is unplottable and hidden from muggle eyes. They can't even floo in."
Scorpius was good for the kids as well. He was a kind, happy, cheerful, energetic, loving kid. He wasn't spoiled, at least not rottenly so, not in the way Draco had been at Hogwarts.
Matris rarely had children into their thirties. Even with their bodies being made to bear children, a pregnancy on a man was always more difficult. It was advised against conceiving past the age of thirty-five. Which was young by magical standards considering that witches could safely carry children all the way into their fifties.
"Care to explain what the fuss was about, Potter?" Draco asked sounding amused, but with an edge of warning.
Harry flooed the kids to Diagon Alley with a mind to buy them some ice cream and to hopefully start reconnecting with them. He stubbornly ignored the voice in his head saying this was a half-assed attempt at best and kept walking.
"Mm. Apparently retirement is quite the job." Draco sounded highly amused himself and reached for the pitcher sitting between them topping off his drink.
Lily gasped and grabbed Draco’s sleeve. He flashed her a smile and continued. "The snake turned around and headed for the person closest to it ready to do some damage, a boy in our year, a Hufflepuff, if I remember correctly. So the snake was inches from striking then suddenly your dad jumps forward and starts hissing at it. He sounded real strange, all those snake noises coming from his mouth and no one could tell what on earth he was saying, but the snake just stopped moving and curled up in a little ball until Snape came up and vanished it like that." He snapped his fingers.
"She says they're cuddling," Albus whispered excitedly, his hand unconsciously seeking Scorpius's. The other children all shifted excitedly.
"Perfect." He grinned at her. "Now, what I need you to do when you say the spell is to imagine the red sparks shooting from the end of the wand. Ready?" She nodded. "Good. Remember to say it clearly. Go ahead."
Draco nodded understandingly. He'd had some scares with Scorpius too. It was near impossible to find a child in a crowd of oblivious shoppers.
Draco burst out laughing. "No wonder you looked so scandalized. My son can't say 'hello' in Parseltongue, but he can curse a blue streak." Draco wrapped his arms around his middle and dissolved into helpless giggles.
"Yeah." Harry smiled at him almost warmly. "You'd know the most and be the best capable of spotting anything irredeemably Dark. I trust you."
Scorpius frowned in thought before breaking into a smile and leaning forward. "I've got an idea. Here's what we need to do..."
"Ready?" Harry asked again as he moved up Draco's body and pressed himself close, their lips just brushing together.
"Yes," Draco answered warily. "Lupin was killed in the Final Battle, I believe, along with his wife. Harry mentioned that Teddy lives with his grandmother, but visits often as he's Harry's godson."
Dropping his hand from his neck, Harry started began with, "I decided to hire Lucius to be my financial adviser."
Contemplating that for a moment, Draco finally shook his head and wrapped his arm more securely around Harry's middle. "Not really, no. I'm even a little bit proud of how well they pulled it off. That's master scheming, Harry, of the Slytherin level." He smirked teasingly.
Chuckling, Draco shook his head. "Whatever, Potter. I know you read it for its scintillating magical creature column."
"And me," Scorpius gave a near silent whimper. "I'll be checking his desk." The other children all snapped around to look at him in horror, then gave him looks of respect and understanding.
"Oh, my dear," Narcissa murmured sadly wrapping her arms around Hermione's shaking shoulders and tugging her to lean against her chest. "It's alright. Let it out. Just cry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,” she whispered into Hermione's wild hair as the poor heartbroken girl just let go and started bawling.
Slowly, warily, Dudley's head turned to look at Harry's carefully innocent face. "I thought you made the glass disappear on accident."
The only other person in the room that didn't seem to be warming up to him in one respect or another was Fleur. She would flash a superior look at him every now and then before placing a pointed hand on her husband’s arm and turning away.
Harry chuckled with a feeling of relief at his cousin’s seemingly easy acceptance. He was also grateful for Dudley's limited scope of understanding when it came to the Wizarding World. "Yeah, Dud. The kids can handle the snakes. Besides, I told them I'd skin them and make belts out of them if they ever hurt one of my kids."
"Not likely, darling. I was never a good enough wife for your father according to her.” Her lips curled in the barest hint of a sneer. “Cassiopeia wanted him to marry a demure, pure-blood, French witch. Too bad she had to settle for an ‘insolent headstrong’, pure-blood, English witch instead."
"Yeah." Harry fidgeted with his glass. "The kids love it. They have these huge gardens, and Narcissa redecorated the whole place. It doesn't look much like it did before." They both shared a haunted look, then Harry shook his head and continued.
“My son-in-law was a good man as well,” Andromeda added, that odd tone in her voice again. Narcissa raised her head and looked at her sister a little puzzled.
“What did they make you do?” Harry asks, wishing he could take Draco’s hand and hold it. It’s still shaking a little bit.
“Why do I have to work with Hermione?” Parkinson complains. “As if we don’t already spend enough time together!”
“Magnificent,” Zabini claps when Harry finally finds the courage to come out, his cheeks on fire. “Give us a swirl, will you?”
His stomach grumbles now, and he decides to go to the kitchen to have something to eat. He’s halfway through his second slice of toast with strawberry jam when Kreacher appears next to him.
“Fuck, you’re leaking already,” Draco says, his voice a rumble that sets Harry’s blood alight. Draco lowers his pyjama bottoms and takes Harry’s hand, casting a wandless lubricating spell on it. Harry raises an eyebrow, and Draco snorts. “Don’t give me that look. I haven’t been practising with anyone, just on myself. I know you’re the jealous type.”
Harry chokes on saliva and shakes his head, feeling his cheeks catch fire as he covers his neck with his hand.
After the Battle, when the Dark Lord had finally been defeated and everyone was suddenly just standing there, unsure of what to do, people started gathering in the Great Hall, where all the bodies had been taken. There were so many, crying wizards and witches crouching over them, young and old. And that’s when he started worrying, wondering if one of them was his soulmate. What if he was there? What if he was dead?
“Shut up and get your bathrobe on,” Harry replies, relieved that Draco is no longer crying. “I still need to heal your wounds.”
“There are potions for nightmares, you know?” Malfoy retorts, his voice low as they head to the library.
“Maybe it’s Theo’s fault,” Harry says, feeling desperate and trying to come up with a plan to avoid the car crash that Draco seems to be headed towards. Where the fuck is Hermione when he needs a genius idea? “Maybe he’s the one who can’t have babies.”
Swallowing the lump that had formed in his throat, he let Lily slip down until her feet were on the floor. "Alright, ducklings," he called their attention. His voice was a little tight, but the children didn't seem to notice. "I've got cookies in the backroom, fresh from the kitchen. Scorpius will show you the way."
They lapsed into silence again for it only to be broken when Andromeda took a deep fortifying breath and spoke. “Narcissa, when Harry told me about his relationship with your family, about Teddy’s visits to your home, I must confess that I did not react as I should have.”
Draco studied Potter searching for anger or any sign of hostility. He found only curiosity and weariness. "I don't know honestly," he answered. "All I know is that you've got the shit end of the stick and my son has latched onto the teary eyed little boy I found in my shop like a Devil's Snare."
Grumbling, Lucius made his way toward the solarium rubbing tenderly at the lump quickly rising on the back of his head.
Teddy was entranced. "She is so cool!" he exclaimed and hurriedly popped the cage open without a second thought and thrust his arm inside waiting patiently until the parrot had hopped aboard and let him pull her out of the bars.
Harry bent double trying to catch his breath and lamenting the fact that he seemed rather out of shape. Turning his head he made sure that James, Albus, and Teddy had joined them then looked back at his daughter and pinned her with an angry glare.
Harry felt unpleasantly jarred. He hadn't realized that Dudley didn't know. He'd completely forgotten to mention anything about his divorce to his cousin. "Ginny left, Dudley," he answered, voice flat.
"Oh God. Just stop before you make me puke. Fine! Fine. You horribly spoiled brats win. You can get your bloody pet snake," he groaned and let his head fall into his hands. The kids started shouting triumphantly jumping up and down.
"I- What?" Harry's jaw fell open before he turned his wide green eyes on the sword Lucius had just held. "No-fucking-way," he gasped reaching over and curling his hands around the hilt. A small tingle of recognition sparked up his arm, causing to him jump.
Draco grinned. "I had a little chat with Shotzy, our elf in charge of floo maintenance. It would seem that my son bribed him with choco-balls to render the floo useless for a night."
His heart stopped for a moment, visions of his wife’s insane eldest sister flashing before his eyes until he was able to remember that he’d seen Molly Weasley kill her in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Nevertheless, seeing this woman in his home was jarring.
A still green haired Teddy crouched behind a boxwood Pegasus listening to his companions periodically shouting in surprise and dashing off to avoid James. It was nice here at Malfoy Manor, he thought. Draco was cool and Mrs. Malfoy was nice, if a little bit odd.
The children had long since lost patience with sitting at their own table and were now scattered in the back field playing games and chasing each other. Scorpius had pulled his outer robe off and practically threw it at Draco before he sprinted off after Albus with a wide smile plastered on his face.
"Molly-Wobbles!" Arthur gasped in outrage, sharing an alarmed look with Lucius. "Why don't we grab a plate and eat a little something before the other guests arrive, dear?"
When the severing and custody papers were owled, Ron had prepared himself half expecting Ginny to suddenly change her mind and ask to come back home. The papers had appeared on Harry's kitchen table an hour later signed and initialed, the wax seal flecked with granules of beach sand.
Draco smiled sincerely and reached out grasping Harry's hand giving it a squeezed it. "Yeah, I am," he admitted softly, not sure himself which statement he was replying to. "Goodnight, Harry."
Lucius had strolled off on his own, snake-head cane swinging idly, his gray eyes watching the children carefully ready to pull his wand should one of the geese watching the mayhem take exception to their rambunctiousness. Harry had to shake his head at the sight.
His breath caught in his throat and Draco grinned. "That's magnificent," he whispered, making the whole kitchen full of house-elves puff up their chests and preen. "Teddy will love it."
Instead, he just took the fork from him and picked up the boy's neglected knife. "Here, let's cut that smaller. Do you want square pieces or just any old shape?" he asked with the knife poised over the food.
He stepped into the hearth with Lily on his hip and Albus at his side. He threw down a pinch of floo powder and called, "12 Grimmauld Place". A great flash of green flame went up and engulfed them. He shut his eyes out of habit, but the sharp jolt and rushing feeling of floo travel never came.
Turning to his son, Draco stroked a hand over Scorpius’s fine blond hair. "You're not hurt are you, Scorpius?"
Draco’s breath caught in his throat a moment before Harry's lips fell on his and suddenly their arms were around one another and all either of them could feel, other than their lips and hands and tongues, was heat and need.
Narcissa looked at her, a moment of incomprehension on her face before her eyes hardened and her back stiffened in understanding. “Is that so?”
Once they got to the floo room, Narcissa was waiting for them with an ornately painted wooden box in her hands. "Mother," Draco drawled in warning. "What is that?"
Now that they were alone, with no children to buffer them, Draco suddenly wished he hadn't sent them away. The silence stretched. Harry was watching him with suddenly unreadable emerald eyes, and Draco didn’t know what to say to this boyhood rival that had stolen his heart so easily.
Slowly, very slowly, Scorpius backed away from the furiously hissing snake as it reared up to look him in the eyes. The snake had green and brown mottled scales and was thin and long. Not really terrifying by itself, but it didn't take much for the angry snake to petrify Scorpius in fear.
He'd helped his own kids learn easy spells with his wand just to get them used to it so he knew they could handle it, but Dudley's daughter had never touched one in her life. She was just as likely to blow a hole in the side of the garden shed as create sparks.
Draco's eyes widened and he glanced back over at the Indian wizard. "You bought Teddy an exotic bird?" he guessed, incredulously.
"A muggle tea, my dear? From a bag?" She lifted the lid on the tea pot to see that, sure enough, there was a soggy, tea stained teabag floating in the dark red liquid. "How very... plebeian of you."
"No, I like Grandpa-Lucius," dear sweet manipulative Lily chimed in with a bright grin. "’Cause when Daddy and Draco get married and have babies, you'll really be our grandpa."
Draco gave him a bright, happy smile and reached forward to twist one of the little boy's own curls around his finger. "Why, thank you. I like your hair, too. It makes you look very handsome."
The next few visits went famously for everyone involved. Each one started out with conspiratorial grins exchanged among the kids and, when they were at the Manor, knowingly amused looks from Lucius and Narcissa.
Stepping into the vault, Harry couldn't figure out where to look first. There was furniture, jewels, clothing, and books, lots of books. Some of them had frayed spines, pages sticking out unevenly, and some of them looked pristine if a bit dusty. Harry could feel his fingers itching with the need to explore.
Scorpius giggled quietly to himself as he crept through the large patch of his grandmama’s red and yellow bird of paradise trying to keep his head down and blend in.
Looking back on the last decade of his life he could see how it would be overwhelming to a person to go from war to marriage and kids with a husband working a high stress job. Looking back he could see what could have been signs of Ginny’s struggle started to become visible when Lily was a toddler.
"He would make my dad torture people," he whispered sounding tortured himself at the thought of what his father was forced to do. "He wouldn't tell me much more than that, but that's pretty awful anyway."
The Minister sighed beleaguered. "No need to get like that, Harry. I fully intend to hunt this guy down. I'm going to order an internal investigation and make sure that this never happens again. You're right, it is dangerous."
"Well, there is no need for such seriousness, Draco." Cassiopeia looked away from his unwavering gaze then peeked at him from the corner of her eyes, under her eyelashes. "You must forgive an old woman for her bluntness. I cannot help myself these days," she lamented with a cajoling little moue.
Harry smiled and scanned the tapestry for another name. "Ah! Look. Theodore Remus Lupin. It is a complete family tree! No one is blasted off of it," he exclaimed in excitement.
"Albus!" Harry snapped, but it was too late. The angry little boy had already shoved away from the table and dashed off the patio disappearing into the crowd.
Harry just grinned innocently at him. "It would mean a lot to me, Draco. They're my family, have been since I started at Hogwarts, and I want them to meet you both." His grin softened and he reached over to grab Draco's hand on top of the table. "You're both very important to me and I want them to know that."
"That's quite alright." Lucius nodded dismissively. "Perhaps next time he will remember to ask before taking such liberties."
This wouldn't be so bad, Harry thought as they got the kids ready for bed. He just needed to remember he was sharing a bed with his friend, something he’d done plenty of times with Ron, and not think about how Draco was a beautiful, intelligent, charming man. Surely if he did that everything would be alright.
Sitting up in bed in the fifth floor master bedroom, Harry stared up at the vaulted ceiling pondering Draco Malfoy and the strange effect he had on him and his children. He seemed shockingly good for them.
. Harry remembered where he was and he realized he had a warm weight on his chest and across his thighs. Snapping his eyes open, Harry looked down to soft silver blond hair filling his vision.
“Blast!” he cursed, gingerly backing out from under the furniture. He glared at the visibly unrepentant house-elf. They’d been popping up on him unexpectedly ever since that one damn house-elf Potter freed had become known as a war hero. Damn creatures were trying to kill him, he just knew it.
Harry shook his head. "He just said it was an invasion of privacy and changed the subject. I think he's not making a stink because he wants to stay as far away from Azkaban as possible."
"That's horrible! How could they think that Dad's godfather would betray his best friends and then blow up a bunch of muggles?!" burst out Lily, angry tears making her eyes glint sharply.
"Don't make me sound like the old man of the house, Mother." Draco smirked unconcerned that his mother had just divulged something potentially embarrassing about him. "You know very well that Father is the one that really must take his afternoon nap or he'll be horribly cranky by dinner time."
"Ow." Harry rubbed at his smarting ear, but didn't even consider trying to argue with her. Molly Weasley was a force to be reckoned with and if she said she would bend you over her knee she wouldn't hesitate to do it regardless of how old you are.
Scorpius shifted nervously. "Um... At least we didn't use the house-elves this time?" he offered weakly when his grandfather's scowl fell on him.
Stella hurriedly slithered up Teddy's body to rest with her brother around his neck. All the children kept their apprehensive gazes on Mr. Malfoy peering down at them.
"He didn't really have much of a choice," Scorpius told them. "Voldemort threatened to kill them if they didn't follow along. He tortured and taunted them even then." He paused again to gather his thoughts.
Teddy crouched in a patch of elephant ear, hair dark green to blend in, and stifled a breathy giggle as he waited for James to back up just one... more... step.
"I-I'm sorry," he stuttered, face blanched pale. "I didn't realize that it was that-... important. I thought that heirlooms would mean just antiques and quirky old magical artifacts," Harry tried to explain, tried to make this proud, older man not look at him as if he was a great disappointment.
"Yeah." Harry frowned and nodded before folding the letter and handing it back to Teddy. "I'm going to ask her to make an exception for the snakes. I don't think Ruby will be a problem though."
Harry groaned in answer and shifted, pressing closer, one hand splayed against Draco's lower back, the other still gripping Draco’s thigh to keep him from sliding to the floor. "Haven't had any type of sex in..." he counted silently in his head and frowned, "since after Lily was born."
Harry rolled his eyes. Edward, or Eddy, was surprisingly like his father, in some ways. Although, thankfully, he took after his mother in the looks department. "And Chrissy?"
Andromeda chuckled lightly at that, some of the tension draining on the subject. “Yes, he is that. He gets it from his mother.”
“Now, dear,” Mrs. Weasley was saying, “This is my second oldest, Charlie. He’ll introduce you around to all the children. Don’t get too carried away with playing, though,” she cautioned. “We’re starting dinner in a few minutes.”
Harry closed his eyes and prayed for strength as he walked from the kitchen and into the family living room with Lily still wrapped around him. He sat down gingerly on one of the plushy sofa's he'd traded the original dour Black furniture for and began rubbing Lily's back soothingly.
Scorpius gave a little gasp as his eyes grew three sizes. His grandpa was never impressed by anything!
Sometime in the night, Draco had rolled to Harry's side of the bed and sprawled out over him laying his head on Harry's shoulder and flinging a leg over his thighs.
Draco moved away from them and went to the two children standing close by just staring out at the gardens in hesitation. "Don't you want to play in the gardens with the other children?" he asked when he reached them.
The trait would surface in the third or fourth born child with a generation or two of separation but it hadn’t appeared in nearly three hundred years and was assumed to be extinct. That is until it had, quite surprisingly, manifested in Draco at the age of thirteen.
It was an enormously opulent bathroom, proportionate to the bedroom. All marble tile and dragon head faucets and a bathtub that looked like it could comfortably fit the Giant Squid. The shower wasn't shabby either with mosaic tiles and almost as many water spouts as the Prefect’s bathroom at Hogwarts. Harry wanted to pack the whole thing up and steal it for his own master bath.
A soft smile played at his lips as he poured some in his palm and began massaging it into his scalp.
Quite the opposite. Lucius squeezed his cane so hard the wood creaked making several of the other men in the lift edge away from him cautiously.
"Scorpius!" Draco called raising his voice to carry in the monstrous wizard’s space that was the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. "It's time to go, kid."
"Well, then why did it?" Harry demanded as he placed a hand on the wall in front of him to keep from falling to the ground himself. "What the fuck was that?"
Andromeda suppressed a scowl. She might have deserved that tone. There had been no reason for her to be rude, to be suspicious of the boy. He was baking cookies for God's sake. He wasn’t rigging the house to blow, but even so. She hadn't had contact with her family in decades, was resolved to continue to despise them. It had thrown her to see her younger sister's son standing so domestically in Harry's kitchen.
Deciding it really wasn't worth it to ask what owls and newts had to do with school at all, Dudley just nodded. "Is there a way to find out sooner than that?" He failed at hiding his anxiousness.
"Yep. All three of them," Harry said, then seized Draco's mouth in a scorching kiss. That shot off another round of sparks between them and their conversation was put on extended hold.
Narcissa followed the motion with her eyes watching him in the reflection of her mirror. Even after all these years her husband could still turn her head. She smiled and leaned back in her chair not making any secret of her attentions as he began to work his trousers off. It astonished her how he could possibly still be that physically attractive at his age.
"Any language is teachable," Draco added seeing that Harry was lost in some sort of mind maze. "They all have structure and form and rules. Same with Parseltongue. I've never heard of it being done, but our boys are trying." He shrugged, a thinly disguised proud quirk to his lips as he sipped at his tea.
Lucius took a deep breath and closed his eyes before pinching the bridge of his nose. Lowering his hand and opening his eyes again, he tried to maintain a cool, calm, professional air.
Cool gray eyes regarded Harry from the other side of the desk before Lucius found his voice once more after that rather passionate speech.
Soon, Shotzy popped up next to Draco just as he was shoving a stuffed mushroom into his mouth. "Master Draco, Master Harry has arrived with Masters Scorpius, Teddy, James, Albus, Mistress Lily, and two redheads."
He knew, had known for a while, that they’d been falling out of love. Harry had failed to be her husband, but he had failed to be her friend even more. And yet, her complete abandonment of everything they’d loved was still incomprehensible.
"Yeah, but your dad actually told you about the war, though, right?" James persisted. They'd just told Scorpius everything and were slightly disappointed at his answer. "I bet you know more about it than we do."
Narcissa took another deep breath closing her eyes to steady herself. Ooh, she really wished Lucius had agreed to have tea with her this afternoon. She could have used his comforting presence right about then.
Sighing, he dipped his head under the spray and let the warm water wash away his linger aches and the evidence of their love making from the night before. This felt wonderful. He felt sated, warm, and loved. Perfect.
“Narcissa!” Lucius shouted through the house as he stuck his head under the fainting couch in their formal sitting room. He couldn’t find his sapphire cufflinks anywhere and he needed to wear them for his meeting with the Minister in the morning.
Harry glanced at him with a self deprecating smile. “Nope. They didn’t even remember. We were still on the run trying to escape the Hogwarts letters they kept sending me. Hagrid actually gave me my first ever present that year. A rather squashed birthday cake.” Harry chuckled fondly at the memory. “He’d sat on it on the way to the place we were staying, but it was still nice.”
Ron chuckled as Hugo and Albus darted from one side of the yard to the other screaming at the top of their lungs while James chased them. Sipping his fire whisky, he reclined comfortably in his lounger and glanced at Harry next to him.
They laid together catching their breaths, their bodies still joined so intimately. Harry peppered tender kisses over Draco's shoulder and neck, while he stroked shaking hands up and down Harry's damp back.
"I'm sure Malfoy Manor is not all that different from Grimmauld Place," he said. "They are roughly the same age, give or take a century or two. Harry did do a lot of remodeling after he inherited the house, but they have about the same amount of magical essence."
Harry was the only father figured he'd ever had and even if it was bad, Teddy was kind of glad Aunt Ginny was gone. She hadn’t been very welcoming if Harry wasn’t there and when he was she’d seemed to need a lot of his attention. He knew it wasn’t that she didn’t like him it was more that she just couldn’t force herself to make the effort.
Harry's eyes flicked over to her, “We've known each other since we started at Hogwarts, but we didn't exactly get along in school," he said bashfully and started snapping beans again.
Harry lifted his head and ran shaking fingers through his messy hair. "No, sweetie. I do want you. I love you and your brothers with all my heart," he said painfully truthful, but he could tell that she didn't really believe him.
“Mistress is being in the Solarium, Master Lucius,” an elf informed him from seemingly out of nowhere causing Lucius to jump in surprise and bang his head on the bottom of a settee he'd just crawled under in his hunt for the missing jewels.
"I do believe, Scorpius," Lucius turned his cool gaze on his pale grandson, all humor suddenly gone, "that I warned you once before about spying."
Five minutes later, Lucius joined them in the receiving room and cast every spell he knew at the fireplace to no avail.
"Well, there’s no reason to beat around the bush. Regardless that the girl never was good enough for you, her leaving had to be hard on you." She said it with such offhand confidence and superiority that Harry saw a resemblance to Narcissa Malfoy for the first time.
A flash of familiar wavy dark hair made him turn to see his Aunt Andromeda enter the gardens. Smiling, he strode toward her.
Draco licked Harry's bottom lip, and grabbed near desperately at Harry’s shoulders digging his fingers into the muscle, tangling them in the cloth of his shirt.
"It's a complete family tree," Lucius told him stepping closer and drawing his attention to the small silver threads that connected the diamonds together and spelled out Black family names. "It's faerie made velvet with a backing of goblin forged platinum. The diamonds are real diamonds, hence the need for platinum instead of silver. Silver is too soft to securely hold a diamond."
"I'm sure they'll like you no matter what, baby," Draco murmured into his son's hair. He hadn't called Scorpius that since he was a toddler, but it seemed to calm him now as it had then. "They'll stay your friends no matter what."
He hissed as the chill of the contraceptive spell passed through his skin to settle inside him before the cold dissipated. They both held their breath for a moment before Draco met Harry's eyes and he nodded tossing his wand back on the nightstand. The heat and the fire and the hunger was quick to return.
"Yes, you did!" he interrupted accusingly, not caring one jot how much attention he was drawing. "You’re lying! Mum ran away ’cause she doesn’t want us and it's all your fault!"
It wasn’t like there was nothing to do in the Manor, but there was only so much he could play by himself and sometimes he just wanted to be with other kids. Meeting Albus had been like a dream come true. Maybe, he hoped, Harry could move into the Manor so then he could see Albus, James, and Lily -and even Teddy- all the time.
Finally, Harry had them all situated in the fireplace, him, Lily, Albus, James, and Teddy. He looked back at Draco and Scorpius one more time before he dropped the floo powder and called out their destination. He didn’t think he’d ever get used to the feeling of leaving behind two pieces of himself as the flurry of green flames whisked them away.
Lucius didn't really know what to say. He had not expected this at all. That the Minister was taking this breech of his rights seriously was astonishing. The fact that this investigation started so soon after becoming Potter's financial adviser didn't escape him.
"Oh, come on. Please Dromeda?" he pleaded trying to widen his eyes and look innocent. "Please? I'll even ask the kids and see what they think."
"I know who you are," Andromeda cut him off, voice hard and stiff. “You’re Lucius’s boy,” she continued like it left an unpleasant taste in her mouth. She wouldn’t have let that much of a reaction show, but she was still getting over her shock.
After Dudley, Marianne, Eddy, and Chrissy disappeared through the floo, Harry dismantled the illegal connection and started ushering his kids up to their own beds.
Narcissa felt her throat begin to close and her eyes start to burn. She couldn’t ever imagine losing Lucius or Draco. She didn’t think she would be able to survive it.
Harry gave him a grateful, but weak smile before sending Albus off and then stepping into the grate with Lily holding tight to his hand.
Lucius shot her an annoyed look before turning and grumbling all the way into the closet and back out again with his good dress boots in hand. They continued to dress, Lucius quite hurriedly and Narcissa calm and poised as always.
Later that night while he puttered around getting ready for bed, Harry thought about his conversation with Draco.
Not that he really had anything against his cousin anymore, but Dudley could still be an obnoxious little git when he wanted to.
James shivered. "I wonder how he didn't go insane. I heard if you stay around Dementors long enough you go completely crazy."
The boys all traded looks, but the only answer they could come up with was to shrug. They really didn't know how bad you had to be to be a Death Eater.
"I believe, darling, that it was your grand-mère's," Narcissa said as she primmly seated herself at one of the garden tables just outside of the Manor doors. "The woman is somewhat of a sadistic
"Lucius," the woman called from the doorway in a displeased and thoroughly commanding tone. "Aren't you going to greet your own mother? Or are you too busy with your guests?" She flicked her gray eyes over the syrupy children and the three non-familial adults with barely controlled disdain.
"Right, just don't ruin your dinners," he cautioned them, playing along. He shot Harry a pointed look, but the other man just had a vaguely puzzled wrinkle to his brow. Draco realized he was the only one that had picked up on the clues.
An hour later, Harry Potter flooed into the Ministry with Lily sitting reluctantly on one hip, Albus clasping sullenly to his other hand, and James glaring darkly at him from the other side of his brother. Well, they certainly weren't a happy bunch, were they?
Harry smiled at him feeling a great weight lifted from his chest. Standing he carded a soothing hand through James's hair. "Shall we go eat breakfast, then?" he asked lightening the mood, much to his son's relief. "I'm starving."
"It wasn't nice," he continued, flashing Albus a grateful smile. "What you guys read, that was just the major events. And it was a little cleaned up, too."
Given no chance to argue, Draco remained in his seat and soon found himself surrounded by the women of the family.
Lucius didn't say anything. He just held onto her tightly, squeezed his eyes shut against the dim light in the room and the old helplessness he could feel breaking from his control.
Lucius snorted. "Potter I can see not noticing a plot when it’s right under his nose, but Draco astonishes me. It's not as though the children’s machinations were all that complicated."
"Are all pure-blood wizard families connected to Arthurian legends?" he squeaked, looking back at Lucius's amused face.
Hermione looked truly surprised by the question and Ron nearly choked on his strudel. "Um, no, sweetie. You can't have a pet snake."
Draco, arms crossed unhappily over his chest, curiously lifted his gaze from where he'd been staring at floor. "What do you mean?"
Soon Hermione popped through the floo, the soup was finished simmering, the chicken came out of the oven, and Ron tossed up the salad. Harry called the kids in from outside and supervised their washing up while Ron set the table and Hermione changed out of her work clothes.
"I dare say she meant to say exactly that," Lucius disagreed, still reeling. He looked from guilty face to guilty face with dawning comprehension, and no little bit of horror. "What in God's name are you children scheming?"
Dudley and Marianne were silent for a long moment before Dudley met Harry's gaze. "How would I go about enrolling them in magic school?"
"I'm glad you brought your kids this morning." Draco and he stood next to each other a ways up the hill watching the kids playing below.
"Even after years of hating each other and such a short time of being real friends?" Draco asked dazedly, eyes half lidded as their noses and lips still caressed one another.
Draco could feel another Granger-esque confrontation coming, but knew he couldn't avoid it. "Yes. The nature of house-elves is to serve. Previously it was to serve as if in slavery, but recently there has been a movement for elves to be freed and to start working for wages," he explained. "None of the current Malfoy elves are free by their own choice."
"Ugh! I hate having to go in there. It's all dusty and smells like parchment." James sniffed in disgust.
Ron and Hermione had been over several times with Rose and Hugo. The presence of their cousins served as a much needed distraction and the kids always seemed better for it. Harry on the other hand wasn’t much helped by the sympathetic glances as Ron and Hermione tried not to mention Ginny.
"Very well, then. I will tell you,” Lucius acquiesced. “Your grandmother was one of three sisters. The eldest was Bellatrix, then your grandmother, Andromeda, and finally my wife, Narcissa," he told them. "They belonged to the Black family which was once one of the oldest pureblood wizard families in England. They held very tightly to their traditions and only married other purebloods. They, like many of the old families, held contempt for muggles and muggleborns."
Draco had to fight down the lump in his throat before he got to his feet and held his hand out for his son to take. "Come on, let's go down and floo to Harry's."
Harry laughed at that and nodded, knowing exactly what Draco meant. "So, this is a first for you?" He even sounded wistful to his own ears.
"Well, come along, dear," Molly instructed Scorpius with that motherly tone you were just compelled to obey. "Let's get you outside and introduce you to the rest of the children."
“I’m going to file for a severing,” he told her. It was the best for both of them. It would set her free and give him closure.
Draco's expression softened and he placed hand on Harry's arm. "I understand, Harry. And don't worry,” he grinned lightening to the mood, “I promise not to take up all the room if you promise not to hog the covers."
"There is a reason why the wizarding population seems to be shrinking and we're trying to find out why the birth rate is so low," Audrey continued on, with Draco's now completely undivided attention. "We have found that infertility and miscarriages are rather more common with witches than they are with muggles."
Rolling his eyes, Draco took the box from his mother still looking at it dubiously. "What's in it?" he asked, then a thought occurred to him and he looked at her in horror. "God, please tell me you didn't pack them wine or mead. I told you what hap-"
Draco gave a tired chuckle at that and threaded the fingers of one hand into Harry's sweat dampened black hair. "You are amazing, Harry." He sighed, pressing his mouth to Harry’s temple. "I've never felt like that before."
Pulling his wand from its arm holster, Harry held it up to show the children. His kids have seen scads of magic their whole lives and knew that the embellishment was for the sake of the Dursleys.
After his relationship with Draco, this had been the one thing he'd been most reluctant to tell Ron about. Money had always been a touchy subject with Ron even though he had more than enough money to live on comfortably now. Near poverty for most of his formative years had left a mark on him.
He got a raised eyebrow in answer. "Well, I could get them off the walls easily enough, but taking them off the property turned out to be a problem."
Lucius looked like he didn't really know how to respond to that. He sat in his chair with this unreadable expression on his face and an air of reluctant intrigue. Finally, he seemed to come to a decision and his mask of dignified stoicism slipped back in place.
"I'm not here to discuss your finances. Well," he conceded, tilting his head a bit, "not directly really. Draco mentioned the other day that you made most of your current fortune through investments."
Fighting his rising blush, Harry returned the smirk with a small cautious smile. "Hello Draco," he called softly, eyes moving over the other man's body taking in exactly just how beautiful he looked in perfectly fitted dress robes.
"Yeah,” he breathed. “Yeah, you're right." Surprisingly, Harry didn’t seem very shocked by that revelation.
"Finances," Lucius repeated blankly. They stared at one another for a moment before he dropped his hands to the armrests and leaned forward. "Mr. Potter, I assure you that every single bronze knut of the Malfoy fortune, every single acre of Malfoy property as been reviewed with a fine toothed comb by the Ministry and has been found perfectly legal."
James knew absolutely everything, and Lily was so nice! Scorpius sorely hoped that Harry would bring them over all the time. Even though he didn't ever tell his dad, he got lonely being the only kid at the Manor.
"No, no. I mean, we need to find out what the Malfoys did. Why my grandma is so angry at Miss Cissy, and why she thinks that they would still be bad even after the war," he explained.
The table bounced into the air from the cushioning charm on the stones and landed perfectly on its legs with nary a wiggle. Fritz stared at it for a moment in stunned silence then collapsed back onto the ground in pure exhaustion. Poor house-elves were being worked into the ground.
"Now, in answer to your first concern. My son and I were indeed Death Eaters in the service of the Dark Lord during the Second War," he told with no mincing of words. "My son was inducted and given an impossible task as was meant to punish me and my wife for our failures. We were supposed to watch him fail at his task then die for his incompetence." He leaned his elbows on his desk and folded his hand over the top before continuing.
None of them wanted Lily to get upset if they found more unpleasant things in their family's history. Plus, they'd been at it for hours and Lily was still young enough to get cranky when she was tired. Or at least, that's what they told themselves. They didn’t want to admit that all this reading about bad stuff happening to people they knew was getting to them, too.
With that they could start their own business like Draco had done. They could get as much of an education as they could ever want, build their own library, travel around the globe, pay for any unforeseen complications or whims or tragedies that might crop up. It was a very tempting prospect.
That was it, wasn’t it, Harry thought. He couldn’t help Ginny. He didn’t even know how to help Ginny. She had been holding on by her fingernails and finally she’d just let go. He hadn’t seen this. He hadn’t noticed how bad she was, how exhausted physically and mentally she’d become. He hadn’t noticed much in the last year except his job and occasionally his kids.
Narcissa came to a complete stop and did something every ounce of her aristocratic breeding would have normally screamed in hysterics at; she stared.
He knew that his mother had a small lock of blond hair tied with a dark green ribbon hidden away in a plain little silver box at the very back of the last drawer in her jewelry box.
After cleaning up Albus, Draco caught his own son's chin in his hand and scrubbed him down too ignoring his yowls of protest with an amused smirk on his lips.
"Nope! It's bedtime. Say goodnight to Albus and get your butt down here," Draco shouted back like a truly practiced parent. Harry raised an eyebrow. Who would have though that Malfoy would make such an -accomplished- father? Or would ever actually have kids?
Marianne scolded him with a smack on the arm and asked in a much calmer voice, "What did the Headmistress say, Harry?"
Harry let himself be lead until they reached the opposite wall. He looked up and his jaw dropped in amazement. "Oh, wow," he murmured and took a step closer to the tapestry hanging from the ceiling of the vault.
He tilted his head towards the kids at the other end of the yard. "Eddy should be in the same year as James so, if you like, when they get their letters, you can come with us to Diagon Alley to buy his supplies."
Finally, it was time to go home. Harry, Draco, and their kids were some of the last to leave, but eventually they made their way toward the floo. Harry was pushing an exhausted and scruffy looking Albus and Scorpius in front of him, while Draco carried a passed out Lily on his hip, Teddy and James following behind totally worn out.
son, blood or not,” Harry shouted, his patients running out. “If I had realized that it would be this much of an issue I would have spoken to you ahead of time, but I didn't, and it's done with. Teddy has never been in any danger with the Malfoys, nor suffered any emotional damage," he said, slowly rising to his feet.
Harry didn’t buy fresh tea leaves by the pound or have house-elves bake tea cakes every morning, but he had a half empty box of chocolate-chip cookies and fruity flavored tea bags.
Hermione had pulled them from under Harry's stiff fingers and looked over every single sheet. Ginny hadn't missed a single initial. Even the custodial papers making Harry the children's one and only parent by law had been signed to the fullest.
"You must be, Edward." Draco smiled kindly at him as he took out his wand and banished the soot clinging to the boy's cheek. "I'm Draco." He held out a hand for the boy to shake.
"What do you mean? Dad killed Voldemort and Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione helped him, that's it." James frowned, confused.
"Nobody knew that it was really Peter, their other friend, that betrayed them except Sirius, but when he tried to catch him, Peter faked his death and killed all those muggles to frame Sirius," Teddy told her. "Then Sirius broke out of Azkaban to keep Peter from hurting Dad."
Harry and Draco’s lives begin with breakfast. Harry and Luna’s successes begin with lunch. And Harry and Lucius revisit some old,
Teddy didn't argue with that. They'd always been better at researching for stuff than him and James. Aunt Hermione was always gushing about them.
He heard Lucius mutter something that sounded suspicious close to, "I'll bet", but ignored it and took one of the only two empty seats right next to each other. He began filling his plate with food and let the renewed flow of conversation sooth his whirling mind.
Andromeda took a deep breath and nodded in acknowledgement of her condolences. “Thank you,” she replied just as quietly. “I loved them very dearly.”
"Alright, alright. I'm getting to it," James grumbled under his breath as he took the first book off the top.
He threw down a handful of floo powder, yelled, "Malfoy Manor!" and was whisked away in a flare of bright green flames before he could have second thoughts.
James ducked his head his eyes darted to Draco across the table then back to Mrs. Malfoy. "Thank you."
Lowering his wand, he frowned. "The spells and enchantments seem to be working. I wonder what's wrong with it."
Harry shrugged and sipped at his drink. "It's possible. All Parseltongue is are a bunch of hisses and sighs. Anyone can hear it and distinguish the sounds. The key, I guess, is knowing the right combinations."
Draco spoke up before his father could get his mouth working. "They are actually my guests, Grand-mère," he said then gestured to Ron who stood and nodded to her politely. "This is Ronald Bilius Weasley, his wife Hermione, and their children Rose and Hugo." He indicated each one in turn and Cassiopeia's eyes skewered them all before fastening on Harry next.
Draco leaned back against the door, panting for breath. Sweat cooling on their skin, Draco’s arms still wrapped around Harry, Harry still bracing Draco up against the door. There was a faint trembling in his limbs, their clothes felt too tight and sticky, and the whisper of Harry's breath over the damp flesh of Draco’s throat made him shiver.
Draco just sighed and gently knocked his forehead against Harry's in resignation. He should have known dating Harry Potter would be hazardous to his sanity.
He felt distinctly uncomfortable now, but knew he needed to talk to someone about it. He sure as hell wasn't making any sense of it by himself. "Yeah," he nodded his eyes distant. "Yeah, I think there might be."
"So Draco's told me," Harry muttered, then brightened. "I think we're going to have his party at the Manor. It's big enough to have all of the family there and Draco said the house-elves would be happy to do all the cooking."
He hesitated before laying a hand on it, glancing over his shoulder questioningly at Lucius. He nodded in answer and Harry turned his attention back to the tapestry.
The longer he looked at the tapestry the surer Harry was that there had to be some kind spatial magic involved in its making. No matter how far to the right or left he looked, the names never stopped, the velvet never ended and yet, when he took a step back, the tapestry didn’t look never ending.
Draco snorted glancing at his father. "Can't you tell, Father? Albus is Potter's spitting image and where would James and Lily acquire that hair if not from the late Lily Potter? I don’t remember little Ginevra having that particular shade of red back in Hogwarts."
"Yes." Harry slipped his hands into his trouser pockets. "She's very brave. Believed in me through the whole of the war," he said casually.
"That's very nice, my love," Mr. Weasley said as he stepped forward and nodded politely to Draco. "Thank you, Draco."
Harry brings his kids into previously enemy territory. Only to reconnect with his eldest son and get reacquainted with his oldest foe.
Nodding, Lucius felt his panic fade to be replaced by confusion and old anger. "That is correct. After my probation was over I was contacted by owl with a notarized requisition that under order of the Minister I was obligated to file copies of everything with the Ministry."
Harry sighed and leaned over to nuzzle his nose into Draco's soft hair before pulling back again. "I'm off to go get Dudley. Will you be in the floo room to meet them when they come through?" he asked.
"Quite," he agreed. "Tell me, Draco. What possessed you to seek an acquaintance with Potter after all these years? If I'm remembering correctly, neither of you got on during school regardless of political disagreements," Lucius asked with careful neutrality.
Harry watched his kids playing outside from the kitchen window while he cleaned up the dishes from breakfast and pondered this new turn in his life.
"Not particularly," Lucius answered, puzzled and curious about this line of questioning. "She is versed in the basics, but has no real depth of knowledge. Narcissa was never anxious to educate herself in the Dark Arts like her sister."
"Mum, you know that Molly and Arthur are coming early with Harry and the kids to help out, don't you?" he asked then promptly wished he'd kept his mouth shut.
“Yeah.” Harry still didn’t sound as convinced as Draco, but he was grateful for his effort. Turning his head he smiled and nuzzled his nose against Draco’s. “I just hope she figures things out before Teddy’s birthday. It would devastate him if she wasn’t there.”
They sat in silence for a moment before Harry stated he had better get back to the kids. He'd left them alone at Grimmauld because they nearly tore him apart when he suggested leaving them at the Burrow while he was gone. He really needed to work on that with them.
A small huff of amusement escaped him. Then Harry sobered, leaning back in his seat. "What happened, Andromeda?"
"Well, you are much sweeter than these two," she said and patted his cheek with a tad more condescension than was necessary. "Perhaps you got that from your mother." She looked back up and the little bit of softness that had come over her evaporated like mist.
Lily situated herself on Narcissa's lap and Draco couldn't help the pang in his chest. His mother loved him and Scorpius to distraction, but she had always wanted a daughter and, failing that, a granddaughter. If things had been different maybe he could have given her one, but then he had married Astoria and that put him off any romantic relationship, male or female, for a long time,.
He tuned in just in time to hear Scorpius hiss something that roughly translated to, "GshfjGH ASS djfiMYhg bollocks."
"Oh. Well, that makes it much better," he grumbled sarcastically, but he couldn't stay vexed when Harry was massaging his scalp with those talented fingers of his.
Scorpius looked passed his best friend to see Teddy, James, and Lily all standing with them and he knew everything would be okay. He wasn’t alone anymore.
The older boy just grinned, his hair turning dishwater blue and his eyes bright green. "You are the pretty blond boy with the horses and the ducks, aren't you?" he asked mischievously earning himself an elbow in the ribs from his furiously blushing cousin.
He was silent for a moment then murmured, "I don't know, Cissa. I don't even know what the meeting is about or if it's even truly with the Minister."
Feeling a lump in his throat, Draco nodded. “I will,” he agreed shakily. To which part he was agreeing, he hardly knew.
Teddy and his coconspirators were basking in the glow of their voctory. They fairly shined with happiness every time they caught their fathers looking at each other in the way that James dubbed "moony-eyed". Of course, despite his teasing, James really didn't mind all that much either.
Ginny didn’t acknowledge him until he was five feet behind her curled up figure. She was still dressed for England as well even though she’d been missing for three weeks. Her long sleeves, jeans, and trainers were out of place on the beach. They would have been getting looks if the beach wasn’t practically deserted.
"It's gone, Ron!" Hermione gasped loud enough for everyone to hear in the silence. "It's gone. I couldn't-... It-..." She sobbed and her words were lost until Ron tried to step forward and touch her, tried to pull her into his arms.
Ron and Hermione looked utterly stunned. "They're trying to learn Parseltongue?" Ron asked incredulously. "Can you even do that? I thought it was inherited."
"Don't you remember Dad telling us that story about Sirius?" James asked, rubbing his sister’s back hesitantly, trying to keep her from bursting into tears.
The shop clerk gasped and took a sudden step back before checking herself and returning to her former place next to Harry. He watched this out of the corner of his eye warily, but kept most of his attention focused on his daughter as she continued to converse with the snake.
Draco snorted, a smirk playing at his lips. "I don't care if it's 'common' as long as it keeps tasting like this." He drained his tea and refilled his cup.
Hermione nodded slowly turning her head to look at him with dull, but apologetic eyes. "I'm sorry I had to do this now. At your house." Her face twisted in remorse. "At Teddy's birthday party."
Lucius watched what seemed to be a rather serious inner debate until Potter abruptly glanced up at him.
It didn't have a title so he gingerly opened the front cover and flipped through a few pages ’til he found the the actual contents. He scanned a bit then hummed, sounding impressed.
An unreadable look flashed through Andromeda’s eyes, but before Narcissa could decipher it, it was gone.
Suddenly jolted from her thoughts, Narcissa snapped her gaze away from the child turning her light blue eyes on her son. "Do you know what Teddy's mother's name was?"
Harry grinned at that amusing imagery. He couldn't see Lord Lucius Malfoy wrapped around anyone's finger, but he supposed if it was possible it was going to be the old bastard's grandson that did it.
Later that night after Harry had tucked his kids into bed he laid in his bed and thought about Scorpius and Albus.
Luna watched him with unblinking, knowing eyes as she munched on her wheat-grass special. Harry watched Lucius with near crippling trepidation until the man’s mask of complete disdain began melting into mild annoyance. He sighed in relief, picked up his own avocado and sprout wrap and began eating.
"Don't worry about it." Draco waved him off with a small smile. "Father went ahead and warded the Dark plants after Phletcher almost lost a leg with the roses."
And he really could, she realized. All she ever wanted was for him to be happy and if that meant falling in love with Draco Malfoy and, subsequently, his family then that is what she wanted for him.
The Minister just nodded gravely. “We are launching a full investigation. When we find the culprit I will personally see to it that you are informed and that your documents are returned."
That made him nearly spit whisky out of his nose. "You kept all that crap?" He coughed trying to clear his nasal passages.
Belle ceased her angry hissing and studied her small companion and the silver dragon she was curled up against. “
Lucius sighed, apparently they didn't want the children to know that their game was up. "It’s quite remarkable," he finished anticlimactically as he picked up his tea and sipped at it sullenly. They always had to ruin his fun.
"Yeah, he has just the one son,” Harry confirmed.” Anyway, after he closed down the shop he brought Albus home and sort of pushed his way into the house. Made tea and forced me to talk about Ginny and the kids, then he left."
Narcissa kissed him gratefully on the corner of his mouth and pulled out from his arms. She walked much more calmly toward Draco and the patio table he was seated at with a full tea service already waiting.
He found it hard to believe that Ronald Weasley would be so accepting of his relationship with Harry when they had been at each others throats since before Hogwarts. That wasn't the most worrying thought though. Ron was Harry's best friend so it wasn't impossible that he was just happy that his friend had found happiness, but the rest of the family might take exception to Harry moving on into a relationship with a Malfoy so soon after his severing with their sister and daughter.
A mischievous look passed over her son's face. She raised an eyebrow at him and he explained, "Harry mentioned something about an illegal floo connection from their home to Grimmauld. They will be flooing into the Manor from there."
"Your father's going to ward the gardens," she informed him as she sat down and poured herself a cup of tea.
The snake sank the rest of the way down with his belly on the ground. It continued looking up at Albus and replied, “
He scoffed and lifted an arm to rest it against the cabinet next to the window. "I didn't know cause I was never around," he reminded her harshly. "I was always on assignment, or at a Ministry function, or -fuck- just not paying attention."
"Look, Dad!" he yelled toward Harry. "It's a chameleon, just like me!" Teddy jumped up and down excitedly, his hair changing colors along with his cake.
Marianne asked about Teddy's sudden and frequent appearance changes sounding fascinated. "Can all wizards do that?"
Turning to the potions and salves stacked behind the counter he snatched one off the shelf. Unscrewing the little tin he dipped his fingers into it and steadied one of Albus’ little hands before rubbing the opaque cream over the abraded skin.
Shaking his head, Harry turned back to his lover with a consternated frown. "You really need to get those damn things out of there."
Harry laughed, delighted and stepped forward to wrap her in a tight hug. "That was wonderful, Chrissy! You did great." He reached into the grass to pick up his wand.
Narcissa greeting him with a kiss on his cheek before shaking her head. "No, dear. You never know when one of your guests will take it into their head to show up early. It's never too soon to start preparation. If I left this up to you and your father our guests would be levitating tables and cooking in the kitchen themselves." She wrinkled her nose at the very notion.
Teddy's mouth fell open and Scorpius ceased his bouncing. The children all looked at each other with varying degrees of surprised then they all broke out into triumphant grins and cheered.
"Yes," Margaret agreed pleasantly. "It's very beautiful. I've never seen gardens like these before. How ever did you find all of these exotic plants?" Her dark eyes sparkled as she looked at the garden only to light up like the sun without warning.  She rushed away from them to kneel just at the edge of wards around the Rapier Roses.
Harry cringed and fidgeting in his seat. "Well, when you put it like that it sounds bad." He shrugged and gave them a helpless smile. "They begged me. They wanted to practice their Parseltongue, so I figured it'd be alright to let them get pets."
"Show the girl in," Lucius instructed the confused elf before he stood from his seat and smoothed down his business robes with a practiced hand.
Closing his eyes to savor the feeling of Draco’s body pressed to his, Harry smiled. "You're not so bad yourself, Draco." He stroked a tentative hand up Draco's back and down to his waist again. "Not bad at all."
Harry rolled his eyes at that, thinking that it might not be such a good idea to let his daughter spend so much time with Narcissa after all. Draco just smirked in amusement.
"She's yours to name, Teddy," Harry told him proudly. "She's a post bird, like an owl, and will take packages and mail for you."
They were quiet for a time, only the sound of Hermione's forcibly stifled sobs ringing into the near darkness around them. "What happened Hermione?" Draco finally asked softly, his voice low and soothing.
Chrysanthemum Dursley was a very sweet, lovely child. Just a few months younger than Lily the two girls got along rather well. Chrissy was smart like her mother and fierce enough to hold her own against her older more pushy brother. Harry was really rather fond of her.
"’Morning, Andromeda. How are you doing?" He squeezed back feeling the comfort seeping into him from the older woman’s embrace.
"If I had known things had gotten so bad I would have- I don't know, quit or something." He sighed not willing to turn around and face Molly and Arthur.
Shifting uncomfortably, Dudley's eyes wandered out to the backward were Chrissy and Lily were playing in the lone patch of flowers he'd found time to plant.
"Good idea," James agreed as he rolled onto his back to get comfortable. "I hope we can figure out why Aunt Dromeda was so mad. Maybe then we can fix it."
A flash of realization came across her expression and she looked at them again with renewed interest. "Really? How wonderful! I'm Narcissa Malfoy."
Harry was bombarded with questions and didn't have time to notice Mowgli sneaking away from the party to disappear through the floo again. He answered every question he could about Eclectus Parrots. What they ate, their temperament, their care, and how large they got.
In the end, Harry caved and agreed to spend the night at the Manor, much to the children's delight. Draco took it upon himself to lead the way away from the floo and up to the third floor where all the sleeping quarters were located.
Teddy and James quickly joined the fray putting their collective strength behind the effort. And absolutely nothing happened. The handle stayed in one place and the drawer stuck like it was welded closed. It didn't even creak.
"Meow." Draco chuckled delighted by the undercurrent of venom in his mother's words. "I never realized you dislike her quite that much, Mother."
The little boy nodded and turned an apprehensive look on his father. "Do you think they'll like me, Dad?"
Lily gave another great sob that shook her little body and made Harry scared she was going to hyperventilate. "I don't want you to go, either!" she confessed tears still soaking his neck and shoulder. "Please don't leave too."
"Coming inside, Potter. Honestly you are a terribly host, you know that?" Draco interrupted again. He seemed to be good at that. "Why don't you introduce me to the pretty young lady barnacled onto your side?"
"I don't think-" Harry began to protest. His anger and worry for his daughter quickly forgotten in the face of his apprehension of seeing Draco again.
"Oh, well, after that your dad thought it was unsporting to attack a downed opponent, so I had ample time to slip a
Harry was happy to see that James had come out of his uncharacteristic shell and was giggling and laughing along with the others while the ducks waddled quaking indignantly and splashed the kids with sweeps of their wings.
Both she and Harry were almost deafened by the outrageously loud shouts of happiness from the children. She smiled wryly and stood from her seat.
"Scorpius can come play anytime, Albus. As long as your dad's okay with it. You know how to floo, don't you, Potter?" he drawled at Harry with a mischievous glint in his eye. "And I'm sure even you can figure out how to owl," he added just for old time's sake and walked to the front entry holding his son's hand.
Harry finally tells his two best friends about all the changes in his life and is met with a mixed reception. Surprisingly his conversation with Lucius is less nerve wracking.
"Oh dear lord, Lucius," Narcissa breathed and turned fiery blue eyes on her frozen, horrified husband. "Please, tell me that's not who I think it is."
"So, it would seem," Lucius drawled in amusement and obligingly handed the letter to Teddy's eager hands. "Open it and see what it says."
Glancing at Lucius over the top of the document, he asked, "Where did you get a Quick Quotes Quill that actually got everything right?"
"Good lord," Andromeda gasped pressing a hand to her chest. For a moment, when she'd stepped through the floo she’d thought she was seeing Lucius Malfoy standing in Harry's kitchen with flour on his cheek, a spatula and mixing bowl in his hands. Then she noticed the bits that weren't Lucius; the nose and lips and ears. Of course she knew who he was, but what she didn't know was what he was doing in her Harry's kitchen.
Narcissa cleared her throat and set down her napkin next to her empty plate. "Are you going to write the Headmistress, Harry?"
"I'm afraid not," Lucius agreed choosing not to mention that they were most likely the souls of other less fortunate beings who’d been lured in. He turned from the chest and placed a guiding hand on Harry's shoulder. "Come over here, there is something I want you to see."
Harry grinned again and held the folds of his missive closed while the wax dripped to the parchment. He lifted the stamp, glanced at it briefly to make sure he'd summoned the Potter seal, and pressed it to the wax leaving a clear imprint. A quick spell and the waxy green seal was dry.
But this could be his only chance to find out what had happened, Teddy thought. He looked around at his siblings and friend with determination. They all knew that look well. "We'll do it."
A slightly pleased hum left Narcissa, a small fond smile curled at her lips. “That does sound like Harry, doesn’t it?”
They sat in heavy silence for a time before the sight of his boyhood rival drinking tea in his kitchen and listening to his problems finally registered and distracted him from his spiraling dark thoughts.
James thought about that for a moment. "I guess you're right, but how would we find any of that out without asking the adults for help? You know they'd try and tell us the 'kid friendly' version of everything." He sneered, his face scrunching in familiar disgust.
Malfoy poured another cup of tea and pushed it toward him. "He bumped into someone and fell. Nothing a little Scrape Salve couldn't cure. Then I let Scorpius fill him full of sugar and brought him home after I closed up for the day."
Narcissa pressed more firmly against Lucius's side and pressed a kiss to his shoulder. "Are you worried, Lucius? About tomorrow?" she asked quietly.
Releasing a sigh of long suffering, Lucius straightened and slipped the potions journal back into its place to begin looking through the other books on the shelf.
Lily seemed to be on better terms with him at least. Since he had assured her numerous times that he had no intention of packing up and leaving she began warming up to him again.
"Listen to your Mother and take the -Weasleys- a host gift," Lucius scolded from the doorway behind them. The sneer was almost unnoticeable on his calm face.
"He just popped into my shop." Draco shrugged sipping at his sugared tea. "Scorpius discovered him crying by the front door and dragged him behind the counter yelling at me to fix the poor kid's skinned hands."
Lucius and Arthur eyed one another suspiciously before nodding stiffly in greeting. They would perhaps take more time to warm up to each other. Their animosity was quite a bit more solidified than their wives'.
He’d been shown into the Gringotts Head Goblin, Warwick’s office. The Goblin talked him through each of his vaults. He made sure Harry at least had a rudimentary understanding of his fortune, interest and income.
Lily yelped in surprise, skidding a little on the cobblestones as Belle suddenly swerved to the right hissing, “
Harry struggled to hide his own amusement and failed. "Sorry, love. I forgot to warn you. When it’s done toasting it pops the item up so you can pull them out."
Luna just released his hand turned around in a circle still studying the room intently. "Oh, it was no problem," she answered airily. "Harry asked me especially, and you sent a very interesting letter. I'm really quite curious now." She smiled again.
"Ronald is the Deputy Head Auror to the Ministry and a renowned war hero. He also holds the Order of Merlin, First Class. Hermione is the Head of the Department for Magical Creatures at the Ministry and is generally thought to be the most intelligent witch of her age. She was also awarded the Order of Merlin, First class." Draco turned his sharp gray eyes on his grandmother. He had her undivided attention now.
The concept that Draco was attractive wasn’t new. He'd always been attractive, even as a pointy faced, spoiled brat. He'd had a lean muscular body from Quidditch and had always had an impeccable appearance. Now, though, he'd grown into his features and filled out in a way that took him from attractive to beautiful.
"Oh." Molly bit her lip, brow wrinkling a little in sadness. "Well, dear, everyone heals and grows at different paces. If you're ready to move on from Ginny, then you're just ready. There's no right or wrong time about it." She smiled at him reassuringly and gave his hand clinched around a mutilated green bean a gently squeeze.
Dudley didn't say anything to that and Harry was thankful for it. Growing tired of awkward silences, Harry got to his feet and slapped his hands together. "Alright, I think I know another way to see if Chrissy is a witch or not. Do you want to do it now?"
The other man continued to stare at the sword in his hands in awe before he gingerly set it back on the table and tore his eyes away to give Harry an inscrutable look. "You, Potter, are full of surprises."
"Oh! I'd forgotten I'd had it." Draco shook his head and lifted the box up appraisingly. "Mother forced me to bring a host's gift along. I'm sure they wouldn't want anything from us so I'll just-"
A speculative look came over Lily's face and she turned her head to look up, first at Draco who was laughing in delight at something Harry said then at her father who was grinning back pleased with himself.
"Oh, yes!" she chirped happily and shook his hand. "I'm Marianne Dursley, Dudley's wife. It's very exciting to be here." She grinned and rubbed absently at her large belly. "We've only ever been to Grimmauld before, this is the first really magical house we've been to."
A concerned frown creased at Narcissa’s delicate brow. Andromeda stiffened as tension between the couple rose. “Why would the Minister ask for a meeting, Lucius? We’ve done everything they’ve asked of us.”
Harry had developed a horrible twitch in his leg by the time a massive chiming of bells echoed throughout the whole house.
"That’s what I said. But she also pointed out that all three of our children were 'surprises' and that she didn't want any more kids." Harry frowned slightly. “Now, knowing how she was starting to get overwhelmed, it makes more sense.”
Struggling to calm himself, Lucius peered down his nose at the little pot-bellied, bald man with all the arrogant disdain he could muster. "Quite the contrary, Draco's shop is doing very well. It's very popular with young people buying gifts for their lovers." His sneer curled into a malicious smirk and the other passengers all sucked in a breath as he continued as if trading bland pleasantries. "In fact, if I remember correctly, he was telling me that just the other day the French Ambassador was in buying a rather expensive necklace for your wife."
Molly looked at him shrewdly for a moment. "So they are Parselmouths, then," she commented neutrally. "When exactly were you going to tell everyone, Harry?"
Harry just shrugged and rubbed at the back of his neck bashfully. "I didn't think of it as an investment. I didn't want my Tournament winnings." He saw Lucius shift uneasily, almost guiltily at that mention of the Triwizard Tournament and felt a flash of satisfaction before he pushed it down.
Lucius glanced at his son a beleaguered look over his shoulder, as he consoled his crying wife patting her on the back. "Now, now, Narcissa. There's no need for these drastic measures. If the plants won’t be pulled then I'll ward them into harmlessness."
Harry fairly melted in a mixture of warmth and guilt. He'd missed Scorpius almost as much as he'd missed Draco. Crouching down, he pulled the little boy into a tight hug before drawing back and giving him a small smile.
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Well those are definitely important, too. But your eleventh is the first of the important wizarding milestones.”
Dark clouds of depression began forming over his head and he could practically see the ones hanging over his children. The situation was becoming dire and he was at a loss on how to make it all better.
"Ugh." Draco scrunched his nose up and shuddered with memories of his father's mother. The woman was a nightmare. "When is she coming for a visit, again?" he asked wishing she would just stay in France where she was spawned.
"There's one at Grimmauld as well," he added. "Harry, you should have shown them the Black library."
"Yes." Draco nodded absently. "The East and South wings are the residential wings where my family and I live along with all of the guest suites. The West wing is where my father and I have our studies as well as the Malfoy Library and the greenhouses,"
"Okay," Harry agreed though still unhappy. He understood, he really did, but the whole argument brought back so much anger and frustration he hadn't really felt since the war.
And he was by no means an idiot. It would be like slitting his own throat to steal from the Savior of the Wizarding World. Complete financial and political suicide.
"I appreciate your concern, Minister. I'm only glad that you have become aware of the situation and have taken steps to correct it," he said diplomatically.
Another burst of green flame and Harry soon joined them. Draco led the way out of the floo room and into the Manor proper as they made their way toward the gardens.
Albus had spent a painstaking hour translating the directions Scorpius had sent them to his dad's shop into Parseltongue so that the snake would know where to head off to. But Harry wasn't to know that the snake was heading off to a prearranged destination. All he knew was that his daughter had just bolted after her wayward pet into the milling masses of Diagon Alley.
Lily just shrugged unconcerned. She didn't really know what "blackmail" meant, but if it got James to help research then she wasn't going to say anything.
Harry smiled back and shook his head. "Not today. But you will be able to deliver her on time?" he asked a little nervously.
Almost immediately, he felt a near painful flash of power arc up his arm and sear through his body. There was an earth thrumming boom and a wave of magical energy pulsed outward like a ripple over water.
. It hissed in her ear as it curled loosely around her neck and shoulders settling down comfortably.
Narcissa had to grit her teeth. "Quite the contrary," she simpered back. "Harry loves having Draco and Scorpius over at Grimmauld Place."
"Yes, please." Harry smirked and leaned into the chaste close mouthed kiss Draco pressed to his lips. "Good morning, love."
They chuckled together and continued on with various conversations that stemmed from their previous one. Harry and Percy finally drew Ron into a debate about the best Keepers in the World Cup league, but Hermione wouldn't be persuaded. She seemed silently deflated and simply sat in her seat, pushing her food around her plate.
Marianne turned pretty, wide eyes on him. "A couple of centuries?" she repeated, her voice sounding shocked.
. Where had he heard that before? He knew he'd heard that somewhere before. Where...? Where...? Where...?
Harry grinned and turned away. "Ah, well, scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, and a couple of waffles in the toaster for Lily." He pointed to each thing in turn.
"I don't think there's anything more we can look up with these," Albus said, catching James's hint. "We'll have to wait until we go to Manor and talk to Scorpius."
Draco awoke to the sound of giggling and the smells of breakfast wafting up five floors from the kitchen. He had a vague memory of Harry dressed in a ratty t-shirt and a pair of jeans pressing a kiss to his sleepy lips before stepping out of the room. That must have been when he went down to fix breakfast, Draco thought.
