“Listen, Sirius. I just found out that I lost someone, a little while ago,” Harry begins. “Someone that I really cared about. I didn’t try hard enough to save him and now he’s being put to death. But you--I have it on good authority that you might have a chance. Would you allow me to try and help you? I was an orphan and you’re the closest thing I have to family.”
Despite the tension, Harry does appreciate the way she speaks to Draco. All three of them know that any number of final decisions would be Harry’s to make, but she seemed to have learned how their relationship works fairly quickly, and always treats him with respect.
"You'll have to be patient with Draco now that he's off his potions, Mr. Potter," Healer Shafiq is saying, as they're preparing to leave, "preparing for a heat can be difficult, especially without hormonal regulation."
“So it is.”
--It was so easy to get swept away in the world they were dreaming about--”
“Of course I’m coming with you,” Draco insists. “I want to be there for you when you get home.”
“Of course. Thank you.” Draco says.
Lucius’ lips thin. “Getting right to it, I see.”
“Forgive me for saying it, but he can be ever so horrid when he wants to be,” she says.
(“We’re not so different, you and I,” He’d said, once, plucking grass out of her hair. She’d cut a neat little circle into the garden because Scorpius made her angry. Father hadn’t been upset with her for messing with his garden, just worried. Nothing grows in that circle, now, so Code and the other snakes like to curl up there for warmth when the sun gets high.)
“How would you feel about going to London for a bit?”
"So I am." Al agrees, swallowing.
, she writes,
“Breathe,” Harry says, catching an errant tear with his thumb.
“I do,” Draco huffs.
The world is spinning as Harry pulls him up into his arms. Draco tries to kiss him, but he misses his mouth completely, leaving a print of his lips on one of Harry’s lenses. It’s better than nothing.
Scorpius laughs. “Yeah, sometimes. I think it’s more because we’re Potters than anything else.”
Sirius rolls his eyes. Malfoy sneers at him. It’s unfairly attractive.
A hazy dark red mist oozes from the wand. Draco covers his mouth with his free hand and closes his eyes tightly. Harry gently rubs circles on his back.
Harry doesn’t say anything for a few minutes, heart in his throat. Draco peeks up at him with reddened eyes, and whatever he sees on Harry’s face sends him into a panic. He sets his dragon aside and shuffles across the hospital bed to be as close to Harry’s side as possible, shaking hands clasping together. He realizes he hasn’t seen Draco look this scared since their wedding day, and curses himself for being tongue-tied.
It all begins normally. Familiar gray and white shapes are projected before them, along with the comforting thump of a heartbeat. Then, Healer Ouedraogo lets out a little gasp, and Harry’s heart drops.
“What a silly question,” Harry says, affectionately. “Now you’re just fishing.”
“So I hexed him.” Draco continues. Harry laughs darkly, sighing down at their joined hands. “I hexed him and I didn’t answer his question. On Imbolc, he apologized for being too forward, and I thought that was the end of it. Then Father called me to the Manor and said Mr. Thicknesse made the same offer to him and he wanted me to think about it, though I don’t think he knows about, erm...”
An elf pops into their section and begins walking between the rows of their seats, presenting a bucket to each person in attendance.
Harry casted.
“I swear Kreacher’s not going to kill me!” Harry laughs. Then, he tilts his head, thinking about it. “Yeah, I don’t think he would.”
“You don’t mean that,” Harry calls in reply, as Draco leaves the study. He scoffs and waves a hand over his shoulder.
sends a mangled figure sailing overhead. They pour into the school and break apart into the neat groups they planned for. Harry watches as Death Eaters blow doors open and drag sobbing children out by their ankles or with magically conjured whips. Their teachers put up a vicious fight--more than one Death Eater falls to the killing curse or the distinctive traditional magics that have been causing them all so much trouble.
“Did you like that, sweetheart? Be honest if you didn’t,” Harry says.
"I'm already great."
"All I can think about is that chicken in the sweet sauce. And the fried rice. I want so much of the rice." Draco confesses.
“Wanna taste you, sweetheart,” Harry finally says, tugging at the ruined knickers.
“It can’t be easy, having Lucius around. I always remember him being very prickly.” Aunt Andromeda says, at length.
“She’s trying to compose a song. I think it’s for--well, it doesn’t matter. But it’s the first time she’s ever done it,” Draco explains, after Pansy stamps her foot and rushes out of the leisure room in a huff.
“Draco--you--I'll--”
“You look tired,” Draco murmurs.
“Oh, and Mr. Potter?” The Healer asks, grinning wryly.
“Don’t touch,” Draco murmurs, slapping Harry’s hand away from the knives he’s neatly laid out for today’s potion.
“Something smells good,” Fred says, not looking up. “Gonna eat it in front of me? I have to say, your torture methods leave much to be desired.”
“Hello, Father.”
“I’m not here to replace your grandmother,” he tells her, lowering his folded newspaper and frowning severely at her.
Draco blushes to the roots of his hair when they pass the cafe along the Serpentine on their walk, where their first heat together began. Harry waggles his eyebrows over at him, which earns him an unfairly powerful smack on the arm. Their small group pauses to watch a group of young people perform a traditional dance. Draco’s family takes turns kissing him on the cheek in farewell and then disperse to mingle with their peers, leaving Draco to explain the different parts of the dance to Harry.
The house elf is the oldest in their repertoire and thus senior in all matters regarding the rest of the elves. Harry and Weasley watch in astonished silence as the elf pops into the study, long hands clasped together.
,” Harry says, gratified when the wards guarding the door unravel in glitters.
“If Potter agrees, then I shall take you.” He says, at length.
but the sad look on Harry's face steals the words from him. “I'm glad you had that.”
“Is he joking? I can never tell if he is,” Father tells Draco. “What an insufferable creature.”
Even thinking about Harry makes him sad. They’ve only been able to have short floo talks. Each time Harry has to go, he leans through the fire so they can share long, desperate kisses that leave him aching. The urge to pull him through grows stronger and stronger each time.
“Let’s walk home, hmm? I think the fresh air would do you some good,” Harry says, covering them both in a disillusionment charm. He’s so angry that even the slimy sensation of the charm gliding over their heads doesn’t shake him.
“I don’t want this to hurt you if it’s cursed somehow,” Harry begins.
Harry relishes taking care of Draco. He relishes the trust that Draco puts in him. Harry
Draco smiles. “I could be an Auror, with all the work I did putting this together. I did a lot of research… I looked around in local archives. I had Father ask Headmaster Snape for permission to look in the Hogwarts library. I also spoke with some elders around the ton. You know we can hold on to gossip for ages.”
“You always say that,” Draco interjects, affectionately.
“Yes, Daddy, only for you,” Draco says.
“I won’t, baby,” Harry promises, playfully jostling him in his arms. He does it again when Draco scoffs, which makes him smile reluctantly.
“It was Ginny,” Harry says, pointedly not rising to Draco’s stormy look. “She broke up with me soon after that because she felt like I was suffocating her. Do you ever feel like I’m suffocating you?”
Well hello there :) When I posted this, I had no intentions of writing more, but here I am.
“I’ve listened to you talk,” Harry says, watching intently as Viktorovich pulls himself back up. “Are you ready to duel?”
“Harry,” he gasps.
“The pleasure was all mine,” he replies, dipping his head as Draco steps around him.
“Um, right,” Davies says, blinking.
“I know some of you are eager to return home,” Voldemort says, eyes lingering on Harry. A smile curls on the corners of his thin lips. “You may go.”
before a tight pop sounds and a house elf asks him a question that he just cannot process. Heart racing, Draco slams the book shut on his hand.
“Yes, but have any of them been yours like I am?” Draco whispers.
“So you will think on it?”
Draco sighs and presses his face into Harry’s neck. Harry comfortingly kneads the back of his thighs, no doubt aching from being spread so wide. Draco rolls his hips forward, seeking friction on Harry’s muscled stomach. Harry had cleaned his stomach after each orgasm, but now the pre-come oozing from his hard cock quickly eases the way for the tiny, aborted movements.
Al remembers one of his roommates being baffled when he learned that the Potter children got maybe four presents max, each, on Christmas day. “Aren’t you rich?” He’d asked. And sure, they are. But they also have a huge family to give them gifts as well, and they want for very little. They are lucky.
Her quill and writing pad animate in a shudder of magic, the quill itself zipping over to Draco in playful figure eights. He smiles amusedly down at it.
“I can’t see you, you tosser,” Harry laughs.
That seems to calm him, and he smiles as Harry pulls his blanket back and draws delicate feet into his lap, massaging gently.
It’s a familiar intimidation tactic. Harry has participated in many quiet interrogations in this very room, standing menacingly along the walls with other Death Eaters, all of them with their wands on careful display. Harry has never seen it in proper lighting. It’s filled with amorphous shapes and whispering corners. Governmental leaders have surrendered entire nations here.
-Discussions of torture
“You haven’t had a heat with him yet! Might I remind you that I was with you when you got your fertility test? You’re young. If anyone can’t give anyone a child, it might be Potter! Maybe he got hexed in the bullocks in service to the Dark Lord.”
He catches the fresh wave of tears before they fall completely, wiping them gently off Draco’s flushed cheeks. Healer Ouedraogo walks back in right as Harry cups Draco’s face and dots his forehead with smacking, staccato kisses. She chuckles as Draco whines and pushes at Harry’s shoulders, complaining that he’s an overgrown child.
She feels a ruffle of her magic settle wobbly under her skin, trailing along her viola until it lets out a shrill burst of aimless sound, and flushes.
“I’ve been home for a little while,” Harry admits, sitting down on the bed. “I was speaking with Ginny, actually. She told me you were upset when you came home.”
Harry shrugs, rubs a hand on Draco's arm as they walk on. “Well, they can be dead useful. The Dark Lord is a resourceful man. If the Muggles were making something of use to us, and we can figure out a way to do it better and make it work, well… we do it.”
He’s always felt that Draco gave up those wands a little too easily, that day. Draco had hexed him harder for smaller offenses in school, and gleefully at that. And when Narcissa Malfoy brushed Harry’s hair aside and asked if her son was alive, there’d been a burst of something like victorious joy, curling in his chest, when he breathed out a “
“It was always the Omegas teaching us younger kids how to duel, because they
The Wizengamot is full on the first day of the trial. The moment they step into the chamber, Draco reaches out for Harry’s hand. His face is trained into a look of careful calm. They are guided to the box specially reserved for witnesses and their families, and the moment they sit, Daphne and Pansy abandon their parents’ sides to greet them softly. They each give Draco tight hugs, faces drawn with worry. Despite everything, Pureblood manners are ingrained--they curtsey to Harry before they take their seats.
Draco hums. "Mother would be delighted. Harry Potter? What a catch."
His back is to Draco and thus hides most of what he’s laid out on the thin corner table, but he catches sight of rotating magical diviner rods and messily scrawled notes. Draco hears the thunk of a closing book, and raises his brows as Theo undoes the blanket he’s thrown over his shoulders to cover the desk entirely.
“Don’t joke about that,” Harry replies, with a frown. “I almost lost you. I haven’t been that scared in years.”
“Yes, but it is important to form alliances. Friendships should work to mutual benefit.” Is grandfather’s exasperated answer, his neatly manicured fingers drumming a tattoo on his desk.
He follows up with the other, and smiles when Harry runs an adoring hand over stocking-covered thighs. He rises up onto his knees, and sighs as Harry spreads him open with one hand, the other holding his cock in place.
He’s standing on the other side of the boutique, surrounded by three anxious-looking attendants weighed down by fabrics and robes. He gives Harry one of those sweet smiles he doesn’t ever seem to realize he’s smiling, and Harry’s chest tightens with longing.
She’d gotten a bad feeling the moment they stepped into the shop. The keeper frowned at the sight of Nan, who’d held her head high as usual and asked if they needed to take their business elsewhere. Lily, gripping onto her hand tightly, squeaked out a hello and grinned as widely as she dared, and like she was expecting, the shopkeeper's face softened.
He wants to present--his instincts are screaming at him to do it, even without a direct command from his Alpha--but Harry gently stalls him the moment he notices Draco preparing to turn over, murmuring worriedly about blocking airflows. Draco rather thinks that’s a load of tosh, but he wouldn’t dare say so, feels too averse to proving Harry wrong after he’s gone and called Draco a good boy in that damned
Draco reaches over and squeezes his hand. “Well, look at you now.”
“Mmmhmm?” Draco asks, blunt teeth sinking into Harry’s neck.
“Yeah,” Harry replies, from within the en suite.
“And when we’re… together,” Draco begins. He takes one look at Harry’s waggling eyebrows and turns back over with a huff, reaching out for his stuffed dragon and pulling it to his chest.
Draco’s chest tightens. He aims his wand over. “
Predictably, this elicits an adorable flush as Draco murmurs an affirmative.
Whatever Draco was expecting to hear next, it wasn’t this. He swallows. “My lord, Harry is very protective. I truly believe that he wouldn’t have thought to teach me that spell if I hadn’t given him the impression that I’m utterly helpless on my own. Being so young, I know very little about how the world works...”
On the first day of Yuletide, they decorate their log and set it ablaze in the leisure room. They both agreed to close the floo connection even to visitors with special permissions and move most of their communications to the bedroom fireplace. Draco takes his wand out and casts the charm his Lucius taught him, and then smiles up at Harry from his place on the floor. Harry kneels beside him and hesitantly joins in on the morning prayer. Then they break their fast in front of the log, still in their nightclothes.
“Well, I think you should stay,” Draco says, mostly just to be arguing.
Harry releases his cock and slides his hand lower, rolling and tugging Draco’s balls in his hand, chuckling lowly at the loud moan that bursts from his lips. Then they delve even lower, and Draco’s briefly excited at the prospect of those thick fingers inside of him, but Harry just presses the pads of his fingers behind his balls. Draco twitches at the sensation--it feels good in a muted way, but the longer it lasts, the more heated it feels. It’s good, but it’s not quite enough, and it has him rolling his hips in quick, impatient little circles.
"Sure." Harry says, clearly not listening.
“Well, he ran into us, actually. He was in quite a hurry,” Draco says. “Mother was furious.”
When he looks up, Mother has a resigned expression on her face.
“Well, no--”
"Harry," he whimpers, squirming.
“Harry…”
Harry finally gives in to the urge to buck his hips upwards. His knot, steadily swelling below, kisses the stretched rim of Draco’s hole, making his rhythm falter.
“Shut up,” Harry responds, though not unkindly. They’ve spoken about this at length. Draco is dramatic.
“Alright. I’ll tell you all the boring ton news, and whatever stupid thing my ancestor did next while he was terrorizing wizarding Britain.”
“Edmonton. Clara Edmonton. Our Lord was kind enough to give my family another opportunity to…” And then the two of them share a flurry of niceties, though Harry can tell by the flatness in his voice that Draco is largely unimpressed by her. Her accent is just off enough, Harry knows, her clothes loud and compensating.
Sometimes, Ron and Hermione pop by, slowly recovering from this change to their lives. Hermione has taken to finding Draco and unceremoniously popping Rose into his arms. Draco doesn't have the heart to refuse her. Rose is a pretty little thing, and the smell at the crown of her head is ambrosial. Draco murmurs nursery rhymes to her in French and bustles around the house, needing some way to work off the burst of energy he gets from having her near.
“Of course, yeah. Is there anything I should remember?” Harry asks.
Harry sighs. “I just have a bad feeling. So, I was going to say, please only work on this when you can reach me. I want to be here so I can intervene in case anything goes sideways.”
Draco breathes out through his nose. Their hands are joined on their shared armrest, and Draco’s knuckles are ghastly white. He does smile when Lucius and Narcissa (thankfully on the other side of the Citadel when the attacks happened) join them and kisses both of their cheeks in greeting.
“First, I’d like to congratulate you on being with child,” The Dark Lord says.
Mother gives the man, who Draco vaguely recognizes as one of Father’s simpering business partners, a wry smile. “Thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Bulstrode.”
Harry only just manages to catch himself in time when he comes, hand flying from its place on Draco's thigh to curl around his knot and squeeze. He presses his face into Draco’s neck and curses as he spills deep inside. The familiar rush of warmth drives Draco to squirm as close as he can, pleased to have made his Alpha come even if he’ll have to miss the cocktail of pleasant hormones a proper tie brings.
, baby, don’t squeeze me like tha--
Draco breaks into guilty laughter. “She would, at that. Mother says she sent her a letter that just said,
Draco jolts as if the words have stung him. Then he pockets his wand and clasps his hands together. “Have you always known how to do that? Talk to snakes?”
WHEN YOU DON’T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT
Aunt Andromeda smiles at her. “I know, flower. But when you grow up a certain way, it’s hard to let things go. You’d think the war would have made it a bit easier, but I guess… after Narcissa, maybe sticking to what he knows is less scary.”
Harry chuckles at him. “You look like glazed gammon.”
“No. I had no idea.”
“Come inside me, please, Daddy,” Draco whispers into his ear, feeling a bit power hungry over the way it makes his rhythm falter. “I want your knot. I can take it.”
Music is the only thing that helped. Father sat her down in front of a piano he hauled in from the nearby Muggle music shop, soothingly speaking to her in French as he ran her through simple scales and the odd ditty. That’s where it all started, her hunger for finding new ways to make music, because how else can she focus it all?
if you want to release them. Or, if for some reason you want to view the dream again, you can extract from it like you would a person's memory.”
She’s not wrong, is what Scorpius does not say. Grandfather sneers at the mere mention of her, like he was in the family she’d left for love, like she and Nan hadn’t reconciled to the best of their ability before Nan was taken from them.
He eats a light breakfast in the gardens after bundling up to protect against the chill, hoping that the cool air will soothe him. If nothing else, he is glad to see a clear blue sky, and charmed by the simply built picnic table he has largely ignored in favor of eating in the personal kitchen with Harry.
“Inside, inside me, please,” He babbles, stroking Harry as best he can from this angle, thighs falling open invitingly.
Of all of them, Scorpius has to be the one who speaks with their grandfather the most, though he couldn’t tell anyone why. Each conversation is baffling and amusing, with Grandfather asking after one thing or the other in their life, and then barely containing his galvanized looks whenever the answer falls short.
. Why would you go outside in the cold to pray,
After a few irritating minutes of shuffling around and muttering polite apologies, Harry immediately feels on edge when he notices Asim Blishwick holding a hand out to help Draco step over several plush seats being held by shaky house elves. Harry’s long legs are enough to get him over. He smiles apologetically down at the elves as he goes. When he’s behind Draco, he strokes his shoulders and gives Blishwick what he knows is a grimace of a smile.
“Bellatrix Lestrange would sooner flay me and leave me to die of exposure by the Thames.”
“Some of the clothes and the jewelry. Whatever you want to see me wear.”
Faces rotate in and out of these meetings. Sometimes Daphne or Pansy cannot attend. Sometimes Draco is too tired to go. Sometimes those who are only passing through will reportedly not be seen again for months. However, aside from Sonja, there is one constant: Anezka Newman is always there, rain or shine, smiling and watching.
Though Draco started at the very bottom, he shares aimless trivia about the various other names listed on the paper. Some exact numbers have been lost to time, some names are accompanied by frustrated little notes pointing out that
“Did you have a long day?” Draco asks, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Then it’s Azkaban, where the dementors and your cellmates can do what they like with you. When you’re suitably broken, they’ll cart you back out to the Wizengamot, punish you
“I’m actually pants at healing.” Is the first thing Harry says.
“So, Grandfather. Sometimes Nan would take me shopping for clothes.”
“The plan was just--I didn’t know they were going to do that! They said they were going to kidnap us and hold us so that the Dark Lord would hear their petition. They said they were going to try to make a statement! I just had to help them corrupt the wards on Sonja’s house. That's how they were able to, to do--it.” Anezka stammers. "They have a lot of friends in high places. I was one of them."
Harry gives a quick, shallow thrust to breach Draco’s entrance, then stills as his Omega rolls his hips downwards, taking him in. He has to close his eyes tightly--the sight of the pink ‘O’ shape Draco’s made with his lips, coupled with the feeling of his tight hole taking him in, would have been his swift undoing.
“And, uh, Lucius?” Scorpius asks, lips pulled into a frown.
Finally, I know that wonky consent kinda comes with the territory for A/B/O fics, but writing anything with non-con as the main focus is my biggest no.
George wordlessly follows--Harry has never heard him speak so rarely in all his life--and Ginny lingers, giving Harry an apologetic smile.
There lies the Malfoy family diary, situated in the middle of a perfectly drawn circle of perfectly clean carpet. The carpet surrounding it is blackened in places and dusty in others, but the diary looks as unscathed as if someone cast a localized
Shamefaced, they nod.
Harry guides him, murmuring praise and instruction. He quickly loses his words, and muffles his moans into Draco's neck, kissing and licking restlessly over the sweaty skin. At this point, it won't take much. Just being held makes him feel like he could gnash his teeth, and Draco's clear enthusiasm and desire is a heady confidence booster. He comes with a grunt, covering Draco's hand once more. Echoing his earlier desire, Draco brings his hand up to his face and curiously licks over it, and it's Harry's turn to curse as his prick gives a valiant attempt at coming back to life.
Harry and Weasley promptly descend into bitter, mean-spirited bickering. Harry calls Weasley a manchild. Weasley says he’s not sure how Harry’s maintained his muscle mass dining on wine and sweetmeats. Harry says Weasley has never been able to cope with feeling like he’s overshadowed. Weasley says Harry’s fits of temper have endangered his brain cells. Harry asks if Hermione had to tell him what brain cells are. Neither of them notices Draco propping himself up, neatly adjusting his hair, and then drawing his wand.
When Harry glances back down, he’s put one baby in the rocker, which he has begun to push with one foot, and is holding the other to his chest. The blanket is thrown over his shoulder for modesty. He gives Harry a small smile as he reclaims his seat.
Harry assembles a small mountain of pillows beneath him and presses him down, cooing in understanding at the soft hiss of breath that gusts between Draco’s grit teeth when his frenulum glides over the soft fabric. The friction is not enough to satisfy unless he really works at it, but he’s feeling buttery with the weight of Harry’s praise, and lazy with the assurance that Harry’s going to make him all better.
“I’m sorry, baby,” Harry says, though there’s still a smile in his voice.
Pansy announces that her father is calling her home and thanks them profusely for allowing her to stay. Though Harry will genuinely miss the music, he sighs in relief the moment she steps through that floo.
“No matter what happens, we’re more than equipped to care for—”
Every now and then, Draco comes to their duels bouncing in excitement. He takes their practices very seriously and has begun purchasing books to study when Harry’s away. Draco has his own Gringotts vault, one that Harry deposits funds into on a weekly basis, but he insists that Draco buy the books under Harry’s name, if only for his safety. It makes him smile every time he is mailed his monthly reports and finds book after book listed underneath the purchases.
He's desirous and eager to please. Harry quickly learns that he's got a free period after their DADA class. That explains the talks, at least, and they
“But why my child?”
The elf bows low, droopy ears trailing against the ground.
“That’s rough. Think Draco would twist my nipple if I tried to give him a curfew,” Harry admits, amused.
“Hey,” Harry whispers softly, tucking some of Draco’s hair behind his ear. “You’re pregnant!”
“Okay, sweetheart,” he says, and he props his right hand up over where Draco’s hand is clenched into the sheets, slotting their fingers together. The other worms underneath his belly, cupping his drooling cock. and just the touch alone has him twitching and shuddering.
“Makes sense to me,” Harry says, like it’s the simplest thing in the world. “Ask whenever you want. I’ll always look after you, okay? For as long as you’ll have me, Draco.”
“It’s true. I taught Draco a few offensive spells for my own peace of mind. We’re newly bonded and I like to know that he’s safe. I taught him the spells without expecting that he would ever need to use them, but evidently, my instincts were in the right place.” Harry says. “Is this going to be a problem?”
If the wrong person heard that, they could have been in serious trouble. Harry’s not so concerned about what happens to himself, but the thought of Draco being punished is untenable. It is fortunate that the entrance is fairly unoccupied, save the two guards standing stalwart by the large double doors. They’re likely Muggleborn, which is a toss-up of helpful or hurtful. Muggleborns have little reason to revere Voldemort, and every reason to hoard valuable information for a leg up.
“Cassiopeia, yes.” Sirius says.
Harry dips his head down, whispering in Draco’s ear. “You know, I was here when I first got your Father’s letter about you.”
“You’ve been holding back with me.” Draco accuses.
Shows of strength unfitting of his willowy frame are not uncommon for Voldemort, but they still manage to shock Harry each time he witnesses it. The room, once filled with low chatter, falls abruptly silent. Minister Sokolov lets out a wheezing noise of pain when Voldemort throws him onto the floor. Harry can see that his body is wracked with the short, jerky movements that follow an extended period of time under the Cruciatus Curse.
“Shh, it’s okay, gonna take care of you, then we’ll go home, okay?” Harry asks. At Draco’s eager nod, he adds, “Turn around for me, baby.”
“Gospodin,” Sokolov begins.
Lily has been having the same nightmare since Nan died, on and off.
He steps back and swallows, clasping his hands together. “Right. I’ve asked for too much. I’ll go to bed.”
James laughs again, despite himself. “I know I’m amazing, but let’s not go that far.”
“So she did,” Grandfather says, looking at her with what she thinks is way too much suspicion.
“Greedy boy,” Harry says, gently pushing Draco’s hand away. Draco lets out a protesting whine and Harry tuts at him. “You haven’t asked nicely.”
Normally, Draco would be struggling to resist an eye roll. Posturing, the whole thing. The winner of the Beltane duels wins nothing but bragging rights, and perhaps an amused comment from their Lord. Alphas and Betas flock to it each year, hoping for the attention and good favor.
“An Auror!” The Smith boy says, letting out a sigh of relief.
Harry raises a brow, hands drawing small circles on his pelvis, very pointedly avoiding his aching erection. “Don’t normally what?”
“I love you, too. So much.” Harry says.
“What kind of game?” Draco asks, pushing his hips forward, fucking  into Harry’s grip.
“Oh, good. I don’t know how to explain it very well. They were Russian jewelers who would make these for the royal family. This one was given to some empress or another. It’s called the rosebud. I thought it would be more memorable to give you one of these instead of trying to make boiled eggs taste good. I nicked it during one of our recent raids in St. Petersburg.”
"What?" Harry laughs, running covetous hands up and down his sides.
She gives him an odd look, and then the corner of her lips quirk softly upwards. “Erm, a long time ago, yes.”
“You know what I meant, Mother,” Draco says, a hint of a whine growing in his voice.
“There’s not a lot of… finesse. I can’t give you a show. I always had to be quick and quiet outside of my heats. I’ll look silly.”
Harry holds a hand out to help him up. “Is this potion gonna make us go mad? Am I gonna start singing nursery rhymes?”
“Er,” Harry says, “Don’t you think he would be unsettled if I just up and told him that he needed to have more than the two required of us?”
Harry squeezes his shaft, leaning forward and molding his front along Draco’s back. “Okay, sweetheart. It’s okay. Come for me.”
He complies, and as Harry takes his place at the headboard of the bed, he gives him a hungry look. His pupils are blown wide, the thin ring of gray left behind darkened with want. Harry pats his thighs in invitation, and he crawls over. He takes Harry’s cock in hand and gives it a slow pump, clearly delighted. Harry grunts as his cock twitches in that soft grip, precome gradually easing the way of soft strokes.
Harry takes him with deep, punishing thrusts, growling when Draco tries to move. The little push and pull is thrilling in an entirely new way. He knows that Harry would never hurt him--not in any way he didn’t ask for, at least--but the rabbiting jolt of not-quite fear that spikes in his belly each time Harry stills him makes him whimper.
What was meant to be a quick and educational visit deteriorates into play fighting.
The Auror department itself was overwhelmed by spell-resistant howlers. They delivered the same cryptic message in a distorted voice:
“Use a protective charm, Mr. Malfoy.” Harry says, exasperated.
“He’s very kind. He’s just… enthusiastic.” Draco says with a blush.
“Good luck,” Draco says, giving his hands a final squeeze. “Come find me when you’re done so you can get your terrible children to stop attacking me.”
“A seamster sews,” Draco sputters. “It’s not the same as what I’m doing. I’m just--making a blanket nicer.”
“I believe I asked you first!” Harry points out.
Finding this room had been a blessing in many ways. It’s difficult for both of them to enter the Room of Requirement for different reasons, and there’s something just novel enough about the room that they inevitably find their way back to it. Harry stores their things atop the piano and goes through the usual motions. He confounds the chatty portraits, sets locking and caterwauling charms by the door, and a series of muffliatos along the walls. Then he tilts his head and sends a whimsical round of bluebell flames into the air. As Draco smiles up at them, Harry pushes the scattered desks together, beginning the tedious process of transfiguring them into a suitable bed.
Fred turns around in his chair, leans an arm over the back of it. “So. How have you been?”
“Oh, my sweet boy,” Harry sighs, shuffling close to wrap him in a tight embrace.
When Harry gets notice that the rebuilding of St. Savior’s House is complete, he feels about ten pounds lighter. It’s ridiculous how a building as big as the Citadel can feel so cramped. The non-choice of living in close quarters with other rich families or snubbing the Dark Lord reminds Harry of the old world books Ginny and Hermione were so fascinated with, wherein kings hopped about from castle to castle with their entire court in tow whether they wanted to go or not.
“Are you happy, Daddy?” Draco asks, after a short while.
Harry closes his eyes, pained. “I’m so tired of people raking me over the coals for something that was out of my hands.
“I promise to tell you about it,” Draco says. “I want to tell you about it. It’s just that I’m very angry, so I’ll cry if I talk about it right now, which is ridiculous.”
“Come eat something, love,” Father says, absently, pulling him into the kitchen. The familiar smell of dad’s cooking lulls some of the anxiety that had been building in his stomach. With a pop, Kreacher appears at his side, wordlessly offering him a plate of sliced apples, his favorite snack since childhood.
… Have you heard about all the curses I know?
“I’m sorry,” Draco says. “I’m so sorry.”
They walk a circuit around the grounds, with Draco’s friends trailing nosily but respectfully behind them. Draco has seen Harry interacting with others of their station, but watching lesser nobles approach them to schmooze is a new experience entirely. He can see the hate settled in the eyes of the Purebloods, the envy in the Half-Bloods sponsored by them. Foreign visitors turn to Draco to translate, confident in a Pureblood’s talent for languages. They are often quite rude. Draco censors the worst of it, but Harry’s not fooled.
Draco silences him with a round of short, chaste kisses, and then burrows his face into Harry’s neck, the soft swell of his breasts pressing warmly into Harry’s chest as he clings as tightly as he can. Harry laughs again, mostly just because he can, and maybe a little bit because he’s never felt so much love.
"Gorgeous," Harry grinds out, surprising even himself with the weight of his voice.
“Stand still,” she barks, and they all fall silent, pushing close together.
“Takes time,” Anton lifts his free shoulder in a delicate shrug, careful not to disturb his nursing child. “And heat.”
His finger slides down to
“You should know there a lot of things worse than that, Mr. Death Eater,” Fred says, gravely.
to guide his way once he’s inside. Donning his battle robes is nothing new, but it always feels like he’s putting on a second layer of skin, or maybe replacing some vital part of him. Harry never bothers with the mask. That feels like too much. He’d left it behind in a little show of defiance that made Voldemort laugh indulgently, some years ago. If he’d done it on the wrong day he might have been dead or worse, but in the end, he’d just started a trend. Harry follows the tug of Voldemort’s will, allowing it to guide his apparition.
“It would be helpful if we had access to school records. The Pureblood children within should be protected,” Thicknesse says. “If they are young enough, it is possible they can be rehomed to families who will have them if their birth parents have been corrupted.”
“How could I forget?” Harry says.
“Why would you think they wouldn’t be?” Harry asks, pulling him closer.
After Draco’s body seems to have given all it’s going to give, Harry finally manages to get him out of bed and heads for the washroom. Draco, still struggling with a dark, all-consuming need, fights him every step of the way. When nuzzling and groping and even dropping to his knees does not get him what he wants, he descends into a full on tantrum. Some hindbrain urge is enticing him to push back. He kicks and shoves and scratches, and is either ignored or gently redirected. He goes completely limp, refusing to help Harry pick him up, but it only has the entirely unwanted effect of making Harry break into laughter.
"You're incorrigible!" Draco cries. "Absolutely irredeemable!"
“Yes,” Draco gasps.
“We’ve got a lot to talk about, and I feel like you know why we asked you here,” Harry tells her.
“Don’t you bring Harry into this,” Draco hisses back, pointing a finger in her face. “One word from me and he would kill you without hesitation.”
“Ready, Scor?” He asks, raising his brows.
"Just there, please, don't stop," He's muttering, and then he completely destroys Sirius' composure by following it up with a low, "thank you."
“Mother,” Draco sighs. “Please. Not now.”
The spell does not do quite the damage it usually would on account of its rapidly moving target, and slashes through several fighters on its way. The tail end of it hits true and sends a spray of blood against the walls in an arc, just as Viktorovich is about to turn a corner. He lets out a pained cry. Harry knows enough Russian to recognize the foul words leaving his mouth. Bellatrix smirks at Harry.
fills his ears a second later. Being on the other side of that charm is never quite so comforting as being behind it.
“Oh,” Draco whispers, shock audible in his voice.
It’s a half-truth. Draco is not crabby, he’s traumatized. He’s hiding it as well as he can, but it takes one to know one, and Harry is no mind Healer. He’s glad he was able to get Draco out of the Citadel and into the bustle of the city. It feels like a baby step. Maybe getting him to talk to someone other than the usual suspects can be another.
, it’s okay. Draco! Why didn’t you
“You’ll hate me,” Draco gasps out, and then his shoulders begin to shake.
Harry slides two fingers into Draco’s twitching entrance, and just like that, he’s off like a shot, thighs closing around Harry’s head. His cries are muffled by his shaking legs as he shatters apart around Harry’s fingers. Harry works him through it, humming in answer to every low cry of his name. Then he dislodges himself, pausing shortly enough to place a kiss on the swollen folds.
“Why?” Harry asks, frowning. “Don’t tell me you’re afraid to speak with them?”
“I want to make new memories with you,” Draco admits. He swallows against the tightness in his throat at the thought that they may be some of the last.
Harry immediately understands what Hermione meant about the Aurors the next day, when he visits her home to bring them over. Red-robed figures patrol in neatly organized circuits, and even under his famously solid disillusionment charm, he feels a bit like he’s being watched.
“Tell me I’m pretty,” Draco demands, apropos of nothing.
“I didn’t say you could do that,” Harry says.
Al cradles his hips, enjoying the feeling of Draco's arse filling his hands. He squeezes, and then his hands trail up, appreciative of the softness he finds beneath his oversized shirt. He can feel the zig-zag of a stray stretch mark, which he caresses with his thumbs, enjoying the shy squirm it elicits. He still hasn't been able to convince Draco to undress completely when they do this. "You'll find out just how old I am," he likes to say, spinning insecurity into a joke. Al's not good with words, so he's still trying to find a way to say that he likes the story in Draco's body without sounding like the cornball love interests in those Muggle romance films Scorpius pretends he isn't obsessed with. Most days, like today, he settles for keeping his own shirt on in a show of solidarity.
“Hello, Draco. You look gorgeous, darling. Good,” Mother says, observing him with her hands on his shoulders.
He braces himself against the wall and dips his other hand beneath his robes--they really are quite a nuisance, and feel so hot and restrictive it has tears of frustration gathering in the corners of his eyes--to take his sensitive cock in hand. He’s too frustrated to stroke himself with anything approaching finesse, and it barely feels like enough, but the slick slide of the precome drooling from his tip eases the way in a lovely slide. Then the tip of Harry’s tongue is licking firmly over his hole and delving past his rim. A low moan falls from his lips, deeper than any sound that’s ever left him. Harry holds him wide open, fucking his tongue in and in and in, the dirty and slick. He hums into Draco’s skin, sending the vibrations bouncing through his very core. Then he sucks tightly, and the sensation makes Draco cry out. Absently, he hopes that Harry threw up a silencing charm, but he doesn’t care about it enough to try and silence himself. How else will his Alpha know he’s enjoying this?
“Hold it,” Harry says, kissing behind his ear. “I know you can.”
Daphne Greengrass!”
“Were there any in Knightsbridge?” Harry asks.
If nothing else, coming home is worth it so he can step through the door and give Father a tight, obnoxious hug. He can feel Father’s laugh rumble through him as a slender hand scores through his hair.
He presses it into Draco’s mouth, and then reaches down to pinch his nipple, the wet sensation drawing a shudder. After a few heated seconds of teasing, his hand glides lower and rubs over his belly. He takes Draco in hand and tugs quickly. The shock of sensation has him gasping into Harry’s neck, his hands fisting against Harry’s chest.
Draco opens the door, brows furrowed. “Did I do it right?”
Rodolphus gives him a quirk of a smile, one that says he understands Harry has caught on.
“Father makes fun of Daddy all the time for not knowing how to dress without him.” Lily says, not wanting the moment to end.
He releases one of Draco’s thighs to slide a finger inside him up to the first knuckle. Harry raises his head and smile up at him, lips glistening. He watches with open appreciation as Draco adjusts to the feeling, biting his lip and huffing and sighing.
“So let’s start from the beginning. How did you meet the rebels?” Harry asks.
would give birth to. He has never worn it, but he carries it with him wherever he goes, as a reminder to himself.
They draw tentative plans to prepare a small team to test the method out. Theo fields questions bravely, but is clearly uncomfortable. Cantankerous rests a hand on his shoulder squeezing and shaking gently whenever he falters.
No matter how long they tend to work in the Citadel, the white-robed staff never looks any less nervous. Harry knows they must hate when it’s planning time--they have to endure the flight of Death Eaters passing through their halls like some twisted troupe, robes billowing behind them. Their strange procession grows in size, and the familiar chatter starts up from the back, emanating from the usual talkative suspects. Lucius breezes over to inquire after Draco’s health and is gone almost in the same instant, walking stick tap-taping with every step.
“That’s not fair,” Hermione says, her lips pursing into a frown. Then she grimaces, her hand rising up to her rounded belly.
“No,” Draco murmurs.
“I got it when you took me shopping for our anniversary,” Draco says.
“That’s none of your concern,” Draco says, face pulled into a severe frown.
Anything Harry wants to say will have dire consequences, so he says nothing. The silence lingers. Finally, Voldemort crosses his legs and steeples his fingers, sighing deeply, as if there is an enormous weight on his shoulders.
“You’re not,” Draco protests. At Harry’s raised brow, he laughs. “Well, you are, but I like it.”
“Say it,” Harry says.
Draco furrows his brows. “Is something the matter?”
“With me, kid,” Dad says, wry fondness in his voice as he directs Scorpius to a chopping board.
Dad and Father are there to greet him when he comes back. Dad ruffles his hair and pulls him into a hug, and Father brushes his fringe aside to kiss his forehead in greeting, happy as ever to see him. It seems like every time they see him, they have to look up a little further to meet his eyes. (“Still room left to grow, too, dear,” Nan had said, a little before she passed, squaring her shoulders in the same exact show of quiet pride that Father often does with them.)
“Why, thank you, Weasley.” Draco says, not even glancing up from where he’s arranging his textbooks by size.
“No, thank you, my husband and I are trying for a baby,” Draco says.
Hilda hums in agreement, and Draco glances up at him curiously.
He’s able to convince Harry to cuddle him for a bit longer. Harry cheekily stills his hand when Draco reaches for his wand, mumbling about covering their scent. He transfigures one of the pillows into a surprisingly elaborate summer robe, helps Draco into it, and then pinches his cheek before he apparates in a resounding crack of magic. Draco pulls a blanket over his shoulders, cradles a fluffy teddy bear in his arms, and enjoys the aftershocks.
“Draco!” Daphne’s voice calls back. “Oh, no--it’s fine--we’re allowed to be here--
“Nothing to concern yourself about, sweetheart,” Harry replies, simply. He briefly removes his hand from Draco’s head to summon a blanket, throw it over Draco’s side, and then goes right back to reading.
“It's rather simple. We send them to the forest in waves. They'll use their magic to drill as far as possible into the earth, and then pour the poison in. If they’re lost in the process,” He swallows again, “then so be it.”
“You know, you should be careful. That’s awfully pretty,” Harry says, hesitantly. Hermione gasps but doesn’t turn around. “You can’t be sure someone won’t steal it.”
He’s already crying before Harry makes it to his side, and he all but melts into Harry’s careful embrace, face nuzzling into his side. Harry swallows tightly, the rush of relief in his body so intense that it makes his knees weak. He sits next to Draco on the bed and runs a careful hand up and down his back.
He says all of it in a furious whisper, drawing closer and closer to Draco with each word. Desperately, he hopes to catch the smell of alcohol--firewhiskey, wine, anything--so that he can forgive and forget this. The only thing he smells is agitated Alpha. A low, plaintive whine tumbles unbidden from his lips, and this seems to shock Thicknesse out of his strange mood. Eyes wide, he steps back, and his grip slackens.
“What on Earth was that?” Grandfather asks.
His hands are cupping Draco’s arse, kneading the tender flesh. He pulls Draco’s cheeks apart, and Draco feels like he whimpers loud enough to make the walls shake when Harry licks a leisurely trail over his hole through the damp fabric.
“Right,” Ron agrees, nodding his head. “Lost his bloody marbles the moment he got some gold in his Gringotts.”
“Please, Harry,” he says, wiggling impatiently as Harry shuffles up behind him, well-toned thighs warm against him.
It’s such a silly place to kiss someone, but it makes Draco tremble anyway. Harry’s hair, always so much softer than it looks, ghost over his thighs as kiss after kiss is pressed onto the gauzy fabric. His skin tingles with a strange cold when Harry’s warm lips move away. He squeezes Draco’s knees and gently parts them, and his broad shoulders prevent them from closing again. A prickling heat is building in Draco’s cheeks, traveling slowly down his neck. He squirms, mildly embarrassed to feel himself slicking up. One good look in a mirror and he knows he’d be some silly pink color, from his ears to his collarbone. Almost eight months of being together, and he still feels dangerously indecent when he bares himself for Harry’s eyes. It’s also unfairly arousing to ignore that little voice shrieking that he’s doing something wrong.
“I know that you had an unfortunate upbringing, Mr. Potter, but I hope you’ll excuse me for insisting that you refrain from molesting my son in good company.” Father snaps, bursting their bubble.
Content warnings:
Harry is tired, so he doesn’t. The questions continue.
“I didn’t like that. I wanted you to eat it.”
“It’s because you’re so fat,” Draco adds, playfully, as Harry snuggles back into him. Harry growls and nips at his neck, and his shoulders shake with laughter. Then, after he sobers up, he asks, “Do you know when the Dark Lord plans to send you back to Russia?”
He feels a kiss land on his temple from behind. “I’m sure it will. Don't do that again without asking first.”
After suffering a few quiet minutes of white-robed servants leading them, Harry says, “I know the way.”
“More than anything,” Draco says, eyes wide.
“What curse did you use?” Davies asks.
It isn’t until Draco raises a soft hand to Harry’s face that he realizes tears have been streaming from his eyes. Draco wipes them clean, and then gently knocks their foreheads together. Harry strokes the back of his hand, grounded by his warmth and sweet scent amidst the chaos surrounding them. He’s got to watch those memories. He has to. It might be the last thing anyone will ever have of Fred Weasley.
“That’s really cute, actually,” Harry says. Then, softer, he adds, “You don’t like your tea, love? Do you want something else?”
“I’ll be late sometimes, mind,” Harry warns. “I won’t have you staying up on my account. Everyone will be there, so hopefully, you won’t be lonely. The place is in Knightsbridge, not far from the Citadel.”
for showing me to the wine cellar, since I know you won’t be drinking any of it for quite some time, and I plan on being rather a thorn in your side,” Sonja replies, warmly.
Draco smiles at him. “Okay.”
Harry laughs. “Tonks it is, then.”
“What is he angry about?” Draco asks, frowning over at Mother.
“Did she? Well, I’m glad she’s still with you.” Harry says, unabashedly meeting dark eyes.
They arrive at the Blishwick estate to polite fanfare, fashionably late in matching robes of olive green. Harry immediately shifts into the role of quiet, exasperated husband, greeting guests with polite but short answers. Everyone in the Dark Lord’s favor is used to this, but it doesn’t stop people from trying to be The One That Made Harry Potter Crack. It’s a familiar and tedious process, but the one benefit is that it buffers them from Draco’s parents.
“You’re the worst decision I’ve ever made,” Draco complains.
There’s a huge gap in their statuses--Draco outranks her in every conceivable way--but she has a way of stripping everything he’s ever known down to a system that looks desperately petty. He knows that she doesn’t mean to. Her heart is pinned firmly to her sleeve--he’s never met a more earnest person, save Harry. But he is starting to resent her all the same, and he doesn’t trust himself not to snap and shout her down.
“Control yourself, Mr. Potter!” Minister Avery calls out.
“Er, of course not. Thank you.”
“Let’s get you out of this, baby,” Harry murmurs, tugging on the fabric.
“Who is it?” Harry asks, from his place behind the desk, scribbling away.
“I’ll thank you to stop harassing my staff, Pansy!” Draco yells.
Draco balks at her. “All I
“Didn’t I just say?” Harry laughs.
“But don’t you want to?” Draco whines.
“They startle easy, sir, and you’re a new face. Maybe that’s it,” the Auror replies. “Anyway, here he is. Visitor for you, Black… Now, you change back this instant! You know you’ll be punished if you do it again this month!”
Draco shakes his head, and then yawns, which makes Harry smile. In the darkness of their room he can barely make out Draco’s pale face, but he can imagine the squinty-eyed look that always accompanies Draco being awake before he wants to be.
He crawls over Harry, and god, he looks and smells divine. The sway of his breasts attracts Harry’s gaze as he fussily arranges pillow after pillow beneath him and snuggles into Harry’s side. They never get especially large on male Omegas outside of pregnancy and are hidden easily enough with the proper clothing, but they’re a welcome sight in private. Harry likes that he’s the only one who gets to see them.
When at last it is time for the duels to begin, Draco and his parents wait just at the edges of the magically partitioned space reserved for it all.
Harry pulls him down with a hand on the back of his neck and kisses him, deep and slow. He groans into the space between them as Draco squeezes over the head of his cock on an upward stroke.
It’s a normal enough conversation. Before long, Lily’s residual nervousness has faded, and they’re going through the motions. Lily plays her newest song, which she knows will be subject to Aunt Luna’s colorful descriptions, and then Lily asks if Al can take her picture this time with his new camera, and he’s so pleased to be asked that he barely seems to know what to do with himself. He takes her picture, and then Aunt Luna’s, and then he calls them all into Lily’s music room for photos. Grandfather, bemused, follows his instructions, posing this way and that. He even gets a picture of Grandfather and Father, standing a few feet apart, angling similar half-smiles at the camera. They look worlds apart, Father messy and indulgent, Grandfather stalwart and proud. Lily loves it. Al promises to send copies of all of them to Aunt Luna. It’s the most they’ve ever shared a room with each other, and she almost wishes Daddy were here and not at the restaurant, but she has a feeling that Grandfather would never have agreed to this if he weren’t.
,” He growls, roughly releasing her. “Get out.”
This fic's getting kinda long, isn't it? Hope that's not an issue! I've been having a blast.
“Be careful and stay warm, sweet boy. I love you.” Harry presses a lingering kiss of farewell on his lips, uncaring of the fact that they’re likely being watched.
a noble duty, Fenrir,” Voldemort interjects, a warning in the sharpness of his hissing voice. “Are you not committed to it?”
“And the Dark Lord wants me to take the Mark,” Theo says, quieter.
Harry hums and works him through it, pulling his fingers out and replacing them with his tongue once more, savoring the taste, the smell, the feeling of Draco’s loosened walls fluttering around the wet muscle.
His Dark Mark’s writhing wakes him in the wee hours of the night.
“We, er, just had one, actually. I feel like I’d be letting him down if it didn't take,” Harry says, staring back over at the fire with a pang in his chest.
He’s not the only restless soul roaming the halls of the Citadel at night, but by some unspoken agreement, they leave each other be in passing. There’s a haunted kind of air lingering about the rotating faces Draco sees, which he understands wholeheartedly. He often passes the white-robed forms of the Citadel’s iconic staff, unease growing in his belly when they stop to bow on their way past, eerie looking in the low lighting.
“I want to come inside you right now.”
“Gorgeous creature,” Thicknesse agrees, bringing Harry out of his thoughts. “It’s a shame he was given over to that half-breed cretin.”
Draco scrabbles to obey, settling on his knees and elbows. He mewls when Harry’s hands, tacky with Draco’s slick, settle on his hips and hold him in place. His thick cock slides in on one long, easy thrust, and Draco clenches down just to appreciate the stretch, preening at the way Harry curses and bucks into him.
It’s nice to be the one teaching Harry something, for once. They discuss the proceedings, and Draco quizzes him on a dizzying list of minor nobles who are sure to bother them both. Harry seems to find the idea of praying to the wild magic quite ludicrous, but he gratefully learns a few common prayers for appearance's sake.
Harry’s gaze is heavy on him as Draco bobs his head, employing every little trick he’s learned so far, his hand pumping what he can’t reach. Before long, Harry’s cock is twitching in his mouth, and his hand tightens in Draco’s hair. His knot is growing, pressing against Draco’s hand each time he pumps his hand.
Draco preens at the praise.
One possible candidate pops into his head right away, and Harry smiles, something dangerously close to hope taking root in his heart.
Then, he feels a poke in his side. He whips his head around, but there’s nothing there. Something taps his opposite shoulder, and he once again sees nothing but bushes when he looks over. Something tugs on his hair, almost playfully, and his ears fill with a chorus of childlike giggles.
"You," Harry says, lifting him up into his arms, "Need a nap."
“Your mother is a chameleon,” Harry tells Blaise at one point, clearly impressed.
Sonja Avery’s mansion is nested towards the very back of a gated community in Richmond. Two footmen meet them by the front gates to guide them inside. The mansion is a beautiful eggshell blue on the outside, the vast green lawn overtaken by a grand fountain decorated with enchanted statues of mermaids wringing their hair into the clear water. Daphne waves excitedly at one, laughing in delight when it winks at her.
Draco closes his eyes. He should have known that day in the Citadel wouldn’t have been the end of it. He should have known that tense Imbolc blessing was not the olive branch he had been hoping for. That much had been clear in the greed on Thicknesse’s face, and Draco, hopeful and foolish, had ignored it. Father continues speaking.
Father is calling his name, which spurs him back into action. Draco can hear his rapidfire footfalls thundering behind him. When he makes it safely out of the Hall of Ancestors, he slams the door with all his might, and pettishly seals it with a powerful locking charm Harry taught him. It settles over the door in a ripple of chaotic magic, so powerful that the hinges rattle satisfyingly. Father slams on the door only once, and then the low muttering of countercharms sounds out into the tense hallway.
When Harry's all the way in, hips pressed against the seat of his arse, he can feel the roundness of what will be his knot. They've tied together before, but Draco has never been in heat for it, and he wasn't anticipating the throng of want that catches in his throat.
Draco opens the letter eagerly.
“You’re so needy this morning,” Harry teases, drawing close.
“I asked if you wanted to picnic after all this,” Harry says, quickly deciding to abandon his earlier question.
Maybe it’s the hormones, or the warm water, but he doesn’t feel the usual shyness, just a calm pride.
“I understand,” She says, looking down at her hands. Her throat bobs.
Scorpius tries to hide his surprised look by sipping away at his drink, but he thinks Father must catch his furrowed brows, because he lets out a deep laugh and says I know, and isn’t it so weird? James isn’t one to be overly bothered with other people’s opinions. Scorpius agrees. He also once thought there was nothing that could keep James out of those gardens.
Their ridiculously, meanderingly-worded bickering ensues, occasionally interrupted by a quip from a long-suffering Narcissa and a quietly amused Rodolphus. Harry finishes the tent, eventually, to the sound of Bellatrix’s victorious Latin chant.
“Well, I was doing perfectly fine until I saw you,” Draco replies, voice dripping with disdain.
“I’ll stand,” Harry says, taking his place behind and slightly to the left of Draco’s chair. “It comforts him. I won’t be an obstruction.”
“We've been working together since I was given these lands. He’ll teach you, and I will thank him for his hard work and give him a generous pension.” Harry explains. Then his face softens.
Harry’s brows furrow. “Okay?”
Draco whispers an affirmative, and then hugs his Alpha as tightly as he dares, willing away the tears he can feel stinging the back of his eyes.
He reaches down with his other hand and curls his fingers around Draco’s fist, guiding his strokes. The lowered tempo makes him squirm, and Harry’s cock twitches as the head drags along the soft skin of Draco’s lower back.
“Merlin and Morgana,” Harry breathes out, which makes Draco laugh.
Their lunch passes in relative peace. Harry resolutely sets his worries aside.
to cook, though.”
Flangst and smut
Then she marches away, back straight, and somehow loses her footing on absolutely nothing while passing through the aisles. She holds her tray high, evidently hoping to save it from her fall. Harry sets his tray down, rights her with a few wandless flicks of the hand, and then turns his head before she can look back at him.
“But--how? We had the scan in the hospital, and then the last ultrasound, and nobody noticed.” Harry splutters. “We've only heard one heartbeat!”
Harry gathers it up with his fingers, and then pushes it back inside, fingers crooking and scoring over his prostate. Draco lets out a little hiccup, arching away from the pleasure-pain. He’s too spent to come again, but it does leave him dizzy by the time Harry is done. Harry rolls him gently onto his back, a soft little smile on his lips. Draco has never seen this expression before.
Harry takes his own wand out and taps it against Draco’s, whispering “
“You’re so silly,” Harry says, leaning in for a kiss.
He is tempted to stall, but he resists the urge. A frantic little burst of inspiration drives him to wear yellow robes to complement the Dark Lord’s deep blue ones; the Dark Lord quirks his thin lips in amusement at the sight of him when he returns to the living room to announce that he’s ready, and holds his arm out. After a moment’s hesitation, Draco takes it.
Draco laughs with him, and then with an impish little grin he does it
The woman starts, and then she narrows her eyes at Harry. Her hair ripples from a dark brown to a violent shade of red, only for the color to drain into a comical white once she gets a good look at his face. Her lips twisting, she wordlessly moves to the side, shoulders hunched. There’s something about her that’s strangely familiar--something about that posture, those cheekbones. But it doesn’t matter. Harry pushes on the door, and once he realizes it has been locked, he blows the knob off with a frustrated burst of wild magic.
“You alright?” Ginny asks, resting a gentle hand on Hermione’s shoulder from behind her chair.
“You’re a regular celebrity, baby,” Harry says. “Wish I could have you in my pocket every time they come running up to me. When I was younger, I used to apparate away whenever I saw a reporter.”
Anezka laughs. For all that she looks much younger than she is, she is very pretty, with her wavy red hair and light blue eyes. “That’s him, yes. He still does it at parties, I’m afraid to say.”
Theo orders for them all, by now familiar with what they’d like. As their waitress leaves them, Draco absentmindedly thanks her, which makes her grin bashfully as she walks away. He turns back to the table to find all of his friends giving him a range of disturbed looks.
Draco has seen Harry in all kinds of states. Drained, after hours at the Citadel; irritated, after planning strategies with senior Death Eaters eager to humble their Half-Blood superior; all but unhinged and dripping with dark lust and residual magic after a raid. He has never heard Harry sound as small as he does now.
of him.”
It takes an agonizing few minutes for him to sort through the magically automated file-books at his disposal, but when he does, he tells Harry the room that Draco is in, and watches with wide eyes as Harry tears through the hospital’s anti-apparition wards on his way up to the fourth floor. Several green-robed eyes turn to face him with frightened looks, though they calm the smallest bit when they see his dark robes, and part easily for him as he storms down the winding hallways to Draco’s room. Many red-robed Aurors are stationed outside of certain rooms--likely protections for high-profile patients. The Auror standing by Draco’s room is Auror is standing half-asleep if her crossed-arms and nodding head are any indication.
“Oh yeah? Like where?”
Then his bright red gaze slides over to Draco, who lowers his eyes. “Young Draco. Lovely as ever.”
“Harlot.”
Harry gapes up at him. “You planned this.”
They’re going back to school soon.
Draco shudders in response. He shifts forward until his chest is pressing into Harry's desk, absolutely covering his grading with his scent, Harry will have to duplicate those if he knows what's good for them. But then he's bringing his arms back, long fingers brushing over Harry's, before gripping his cheeks and exposing his pink, furled hole. Here, his scent is strongest, slick oozing lazily from the tight muscle.
“We can wait,” Beauregard says, tossing wavy blond hair over her shoulder.
“Milicent Bulstrode was allowed to attend by the grace of our Lord, for her father’s work. Old Alistair redeemed himself by the skin of his teeth, Pansy. You’d do nothing but make this harder on both of them if you continue with this courtship foolishness. We all have an obligation to keep magical blood pure. Do you really want to make the Dark Lord suffer reading your petition?”
“Well yeah, but I never really cared to know what it was all about.”
“I’m okay now. Perfect, with you here,” Harry teases, reaching down to squeeze Draco’s arse. Draco lets out a little squeak, which makes Harry chuckle lowly. “But enough about that. How was your day?”
“What do you mean by ‘be careful?” He asks.
The day Nan got hurt, they’d been making the rare trip to Diagon Alley for robes. Lily hasn’t been gaining any of the height her brothers seem to be getting every time the sun shines, so she hadn’t needed anything new, not really. But she liked to make Nan smile, and she definitely liked having her all to herself, so she’d agreed happily enough.
Harry never thought that planning world domination with a group of people he can scarcely stand would become so routine as to feel tedious, but it has. They create formations, plan for which areas to attack next, and share their developments. Today, Snape and Cantankerous Nott introduce their plan to combine the Muggle technology they’ve appropriated with a new potion. Harry only just stops himself from snorting the irony of it. Aerosolizing death to kill other wizards in a decidedly Muggle way.
He looks darling in robes of periwinkle, all accented frills and intricate stitchings. Then he goes and ruins the illusion of the sweet little debutante by telling Sirius that he’s looking especially dreadful this morning, cousin, has he showered? Sirius realizes, with no small amount of horror, that he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“SILENCE!” Minster Avery booms, projecting his voice with a
“Cantankerous’ son has a rather interesting idea to share with us. I would like you to share your opinions of it with candor.” Voldemort says. Then he gazes over at Theo and nods his head towards the enchanted table.
“You’re distracting me.” Harry laughs, as blunt teeth nip absently at his skin.

“Why in the world would your parents give you that diary?”
Draco sputters. “You’ve never been?”
“I love you,” Draco says.
Harry scratches the back of his head. “I promise to try not to.”
This one's a heat fic, folks. It's the usual.
“Yes!” Draco sobs. “I begged you to do something for days and days on end! But you didn’t, and so I married Harry. Now guess what, Father? I love him. I love him, and there is nothing that you could do to separate us.”
Bellatrix lets out a vindictive laugh. Harry glances over at Rodolphus, whose resentment is clear in narrowed eyes and tense shoulders. Then he rearranges his expression and posture into neutrality, so quick about it that Harry questions that the moment of weakness happened at all.
Draco can’t tell which he wants to do more. Fucking into Harry’s fist is just as satisfying as pressing back and taking his cock as deep as possible, enjoying the fullness.
“You lot can bitch and joke all you want, but I tell you, that is a happy Omega,” Greyback says, shrugging.
Filled with affection and amusement, Draco rests his head on her shoulder. She kisses his forehead.
“And I understand that,” Harry grits out.
It’s an unseasonably nice day for London in November. Harry takes one look at the clear sky above and asks Draco if he’d like to go for a stroll. He responds by dipping into their closet for an old nightgown and transfiguring it into a sunhat with a smile, which is so cute that Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever forget it.
Draco shudders. “The things look like they’ll swallow you up. You’re very brave.”
“That,” Father says, pointing. “
Draco bites his lip. “Do you think the Aurors will see it that way?”
“Oh, love,” Harry says, hands pushing Draco’s thighs apart, so wide he feels like there’s not an inch of his body that’s not on display. “You’re so wet for me. I could smell you, but this…”
He is familiar with these trips. These conferences can last for months at a time. As a child, he and Mother would make a game of counting down the days until Father’s return. Mother hadn’t felt comfortable uprooting Draco from his home every few months. They visited sometimes but never stayed. It’d been quietly sad in its own way, but Mother made sure he knew that Father was doing his job to keep them and their world safe.
“Twins! They’re going to have horrible hair, the both of them. Potter genes are strong. Lily had an absolute time trying to tame your locks, boy.” Black says, an affectionate light in his eyes. “What’s your Omega’s name?”
Then she opens the door to the Auror office and bustles inside. Harry stares after her with his stomach churning, knowing that she’s probably right. He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. How childish of him to hold the entire operation up. He must have set the entire department on edge, wondering if they could survive rushing a Death Eater.
Harry laughs against his skin, and then cups his balls before sucking one into his mouth, soft but insistent, pulling a whine from Draco’s throat. He repeats with the other, and then presses wet kisses along Draco’s hard length, finally flicking his tongue against the slit.
Assembling so many people in Koldovstoretz would have been such a clever idea if they hadn’t been betrayed by so many people. Now it has only worked against them: the iconic Death Eater robes separate them from the cramped population inside. It is obvious that the school’s defenders were put through some kind of training, for they move in formations and always as groups when possible, but it is clear they weren’t expecting such a viciously coordinated attack. Harry’s search takes him beyond one-on-one duels and terrified Muggles cradling guns and motionless bodies dangled tauntingly in the air by levitation charms.
“Okay. I love you, Daddy,” Draco sighs.
Part one of a double update!
. Wait!”
“No,” Harry says. “I don’t. Is there anything else I can do for you?”
Blaise grins. “Isn’t she just diabolical?”
“The same to you, madam,” Draco says, giving her a pained smile.
“But I know most people in my year,” Scorpius points out, confused.
“I’ll join you,” Harry says, grateful for the chance at a distraction.
She’s interrupted by noise so deafening that the walls begin rattling. Pansy lets out a soft cry, and Draco wraps an arm around her waist.
Draco nods again. Harry tuts and pulls him into a hug, and Draco buries his face in the crook of his neck. They rock back and forth for a few moments, and Harry kisses his forehead when he pulls back. They already exchanged the more important words at home.
Draco turns and climbs on the bed, kneeling and watching as Harry approaches. He sets his wand aside, impatiently vanishing his clothes on the way, and then wraps his arms around Draco’s waist. It’s nice to feel Draco skin to skin again. Draco relaxes in his arms, pressing the soft globes of his arse back against Harry’s erection.
“No!” Draco yelps, soft hand pressing down on Harry’s chest. Then, softer, he says, “No. I know you don’t really like doing it. I’m happy you did it with me earlier today. Go back to sleep.”
He shrinks back at the narrow-eyed look this gets him. Dad says, “He’s got a lot of time to think about it.”
Father, by now used to seeing a foolish idea growing in James’ eyes, tactfully intervenes. “Why don’t I show you to your rooms, Lucius?”
Harry’s deep, slow thrusts drag his thick length almost meanly against Draco’s swollen prostate on each press inside, his hips grinding in insistent circles whenever they’re joined as closely as possible.
“How are you, Colin?” Harry whispers to him.
Draco is rumpled from sleep, face ruddy and lined with impressions. When he sees Theo, it brightens into a genuine smile, and then quickly descends into horror. Harry doesn’t understand why until Draco fussily pulls the collar of his nightgown back up over his bare shoulders. It’s not uncommon for him to come in and sit in Harry’s lap for a cuddle as he struggles to wake up fully.
“Did anything seem off, once you made it to Mrs. Avery’s home proper?” Beauregard asks.
“Lucius isn’t a good person,” Dad says, bluntly. “He’s learned a lot of hard lessons and yet always seems to end up the same on the other end of it all. I’ll talk to Father about it. For what it’s worth, though, having you guys is all I ever wanted, really.”
“It’s no trouble. I was,” and here she pauses, giving Harry an abruptly considering look. “I was... glad to be helpful.”
“I hope you’ll excuse me for ducking out, but I was working in my brewery before you arrived. I must get back before my cauldron spoils,” Draco says.
She thinks maybe he’s counting on Daddy saying no, but Daddy is not
AU Where Harry is Draco's DADA professor and Draco is the student that's a terrible flirt. As a warning, Draco is 17 in this, which, while legal in the context of this world, may or may not be underage depending on where you live. Either way, he’s a younger person sleeping with someone who is vaguely but significantly older than him. Please skip this chapter if that makes you uncomfortable!
This makes her lips quirk up into a small smile. “Just be careful, my love.”
“Yeah,” Harry says.
“Mate, I don’t think that. I just think you work for him.” Weasley says, audibly exasperated.
personal if I don’t write something you suggest! So don’t be shy and don’t despair! I'm a full time grad student and I also work full time (why do you think I usually post updates at like three or four in the morning?), so I take my fun where I can get it these days.
“No,” Harry says, sounding entirely too delighted to be doing so.
Harry’s poring over reports in his office when he hears a familiar knock on his door. Knocking shave-and-a-haircut had been common at his orphanage, something a friend might do if they wanted to get your attention. Harry taught it to Draco for much the same reasons.
One leg is thrown over a broad shoulder, the other pressed down to the bed with a powerful hand, and then Harry lines up and thrusts inside in one long slide that has the both of them moaning into the air. Knees planted wide, Harry leans down for a kiss. Draco can taste himself on Harry’s lips, arousal and come, and it just makes him greedier for it. They nip and lick and bite at each other until Draco finally feels prepared. Harry is big, and they hadn’t spent as much time getting ready as they usually did. The stretch is delicious, but there’s no denying the adjustment period.
“I’ll hex you if I don’t feel safe,” Draco promises. “You taught me how, remember?”
“You’re a handful and a half,” Harry says, affectionate.
“No you don’t, you little brat,” Harry says, affectionately.
“My apologies, Minister,” Draco says, flushing.
(See the end of the chapter for
As they walk away, Harry leans down to whisper in his ear. “He gives me a bad feeling.”
“The imperial eggs are limited edition and the Dark Lord owns most of them, so I don’t have any more of those to give you. But I thought this would be a lot better,” Harry says.
Harry waves a hand, desperate not to be on the receiving end of Draco’s legendary disappointment. “No, I do! I just thought… you know, all Purebloods are such sticklers about Omegas keeping it long.”
He gives it gratefully, leaning his head down to breathe in the familiar scent of her favorite mint shampoo. “Hello, Mother.”
-Voldemort is intrusive, creepy, and threatening with Harry and Draco about their relationship
“Oh, erm, yeah. I suppose I am.”
“No, I’m sorry,” Draco sighs, turning to face Harry fully.
Scorpius learns that, were they “living the proper way,” they would have grown up associating with every child their age from an old, named family.
“And am I to have no involvement in my child’s life at all?”
“I know! Trust me, baby, I know.” Harry soothes, amused and heartened despite himself at the frustration setting into Draco’s shoulders. He wouldn’t have dared express his displeasure so openly even a few months ago.
“I smell your Dad’s favorite treacle tarts. I smell his magic, too. The flowers at the Manor. Mother’s perfume. That’s about it.”
They choose a comfortable spot near the outskirts of their vast gardens, seated in the short grass underneath the lazy sunlight amongst rose bushes. They talk companionably as they eat, discussing the future and baby names and stories from their past, gently but obviously skirting around the subject of Anezka’s involvement with the rebels.
“No, I can’t,” Draco gasps out. This close, Harry can see the tears gathering at the corner of his eyes. He kisses them away. “I’ll come.”
“Do you regret it?”
Harry can see the shamefaced looks overtaking Crabbe and Goyle’s faces, and the shock growing in the rest of the assembled inner circle. They are lucky Bellatrix left with Lucius, likely to flit about Voldemort’s coattails. She would have done a lot worse than giving them a tongue lashing. With a satisfied nod, Rodolphus bows to them and sweeps out of the drawing room. Not wanting to hear the fallout, Harry leaves as well, only dropping his charm once he’s sure he’s alone. He huffs through his nose, darkly amused. Motivated by self interest as Rodolphus is, it was still satisfying to see their peers silenced for once.
He sends Harry out of the room to go retrieve the family tree he’d put together as a Yuletide gift. Reusing family names is a minor tradition for wizards, and Harry deserves the chance to continue that with his own family, come what may.
“Let me see it,” Black barks, suddenly.
“Harry, oh, please, Merlin,” Draco is whimpering, his eyes stinging as he presses his forehead against the headboard.
“Kreacher,” Malfoy is saying, in that irritatingly simpering tone of voice that means he’s Up To No Good, “would you mind putting this by Master Sirius’ bedside for me?”
Voldemort has already made his way inside the school proper by the time the Death Eaters storm the vast green lawn of the courtyard. The dark miasma that overtakes his body during short-form apparition is distinctive, and Harry can see it lingering behind windows just before they burst in tinkling waterfalls of glass, screams ringing out into the air before falling abruptly silent.
? It’s bigger than our entire house!”
It’s a thought that he’s been trying not to entertain, but he can’t help but feel like the man she’d been so excited to marry had killed her. Not directly, of course, not on purpose, but throwing herself in with him had painted a target on her back from two different sides, and it had only been a matter of time before someone followed through.
“I’d like you to consider a Mind Healer.” She says.
Omega. One you would do well not to speak ill of in my presence. As Rowle has suggested, it is childish of you to let your envy weaken your devotion to our noble cause. My nephew was fortunate to have made a good match, but beyond that, he is fulfilling his role. You might consider doing the same instead of entertaining petty trifles such as this.”
Black gawps at him. “You married a
“Remember what I said. I’ll be here when you’re ready to talk.” Harry chuckles.
Harry's free hand had been on his hip, rubbing circles into the skin there, but now he uses it to press into his thigh, locking him in place. When Draco peeks between his fingers, he can see Harry's bright eyes staring intently back up at him. He's lost his glasses, somehow. Draco runs his hands through Harry's dark curls, scratching at Harry's scalp as he bobs his head, tongue dragging along his length. He comes embarrassingly fast. Harry swallows it all, and sucks insistently at Draco's tip until he has to push him off. Harry rubs his stomach as he comes down from the high, his eyes heavy. He recognizes the familiar ticklish feeling of Harry's stupidly powerful cleaning charm rolling over him, and then Harry's shuffling around before he coaxes Draco out of his shirt and into a silky robe--he must have transfigured it.
The next few moments are filled with a zig-zagging show of hexes, counterspells, and the occasional frustrated exchange of fists. Some of the Purebloods in their section loudly voice their disdain over Smith’s unpredictable usage of lowly Muggle fighting tactics, but Harry finds it rather clever. He herds Rosier close with conjured figurines and animals (Draco winces at a timely
gone through with what you thought their plan was, nothing would have changed.” Harry says, pressing his palms flat on the table.
Older!Harry/Younger!Draco
“Look at you, bossing him around. You’re a proper nobleman, you are,” Ron scoffs, pushing into the house.
“You can take a seat, too, sir,” Auror Beauregard tells Harry, tilting her head towards the chair on Draco’s other side.
Theo smiles wryly at him. “But you were right earlier. I do want to make sure Draco is safe. I’ll gather some equipment start appraising it as soon as possible.”
“I’m so sorry, Harry,” Draco says, breath hitching.
“I don’t think you should read it anymore.”
it when stories/fics change POVs in the same chapter because it feels super jarring to me, but I wanted to play around with parallels and the passage of time. Please tell me if it reads strangely so I can avoid doing it again, lol.
Before they leave, Draco thanks his parents for raising him with care, for their support in the days leading up to his marriage, and for their guidance after. Harry thanks them for welcoming him into the family, and for the honor of one day providing an heir for the Malfoy line. Narcissa surprises him with a quick but powerful hug and then bundles Draco up into a tight, rocking embrace. Lucius squeezes their shoulders and even shakes Harry’s hand before they step through the floo.
Theo gives him a wry smile. “Fair point.”
“Shh, good boy, good
The journey to the gardens is thankfully a short one, and the wide-open space with its many flowers and fountains. Other visitors are exploring in well-dressed clusters, heads bowed together in conversation. Despite his fears, the fresh air and soft sunlight that is able to break through the cloud cover is calming. He takes a deep breath and feels renewed.
At his side, Mother glances briefly up at the ceiling, a rare show of amusement. She does this so she doesn’t stare overlong at whatever is amusing her, a trick Aunt Bella passed onto her after being scolded for inappropriate laughter one too many times.
He bends over to kiss Draco’s warm forehead. Then he pulls the blankets back up and leaves before he gives in.
“When we’re both home I’ll give you so much fun you won’t be able to think straight,” Harry answers, voice thick with promise.
“Your husband recently suggested to me that I consider loosening the restrictions on the magics that Omegas are permitted to use. Harry is a valued servant of mine for his creativity and power, and I must admit that I have been lenient with his contrarian nature over the years because it amuses me. But such a question… it reminded me just how much he has to learn.” The Dark Lord says, sharply.
“My hair is fine.” He sounds extremely confused.
“And I think we can all agree that
Draco flushes defensively. He brings one foot up and thumps Harry on the back. He freezes minutely, afraid that he’s crossed a line, but Harry only lets out a theatrically pained noise.
“And who did I marry?” Harry prompts.
Content warnings:
Mother’s face tightens. “Oh?”
“Questioning the Dark Lord now, Pius?” Rowle snorts. “Careful, or your ears’ll turn green, too.”
and is never satisfied if the answer is
“Hello, my little flower,” she says, holding her arms out for a hug.
“This ring represents everything that is dear to me. It has been passed down from Malfoy heir to Malfoy heir for almost a thousand years, and I was entrusted with the duty of passing it down to the next heir--the heir I have to carry. I wouldn't dare wear it, but I have carried it with me for years, as a reminder of that duty. I offer it to you in exchange for my wish. Please, make sure I am able to fulfill my responsibilities.”
It takes very little shaking to wake Draco from his nightmare. He bolts upright, grasping dryly. Harry squeezes his arm.
“Draco! Be
He reaches out, draws one finger along the ink. It’s old enough that the skin is not especially sensitive to the touch, but fresh enough that its bright colors are stark against alabaster skin. It’s lovely.
He understands why they are, to be sure--Voldemort is always eager to send a message, and making an example out of a disobedient subject is a quick way to break confidence and cull unfavorable behavior. Each time the rebels are brought up during planning at the Citadel, the Dark Lord becomes almost incandescent with fury. Harry doesn’t think the man will ever get over the indignity of having such a historic victory soured by a show of rebellion. He’s scarcely spoken of the lives lost outside of public channels, though that is par for the course. He doesn’t seem to genuinely care for any living soul that isn’t his wretched snake.
, rip my country apart, feel
“Well, what do you think, James?” Scorpius asks.
His palm tingles. The pressure gently directs his hand back to his chest, and he lets out a relieved sob when he sees that he is completely healed. A final swell of warm air surrounds him, soft as an embrace. The array he drew flickers, and erases itself in a poof of fragrant smoke. Draco immediately presses his hands into the grass, and there is no sign of his blood left behind. He cradles himself and lets out a gasping laugh, rocking back and forth.
No more words are shared between them for an amorphous amount of time. Draco falls in and out of a light doze, Harry’s stroking his hair. Then, after a moment, the question he’s been wanting to ask resurfaces in his mind, and he can’t really bring himself to keep his eyes closed.
“Ah, yes, love does make an artist of you,” the tailor hums, approvingly.
“You bet I am. Ready to be done with these Russian bastards. Ready to go home to my mate. Thinking about yours?” Crabbe asks. He grins lopsidedly when Harry nods. “Fine Omega, that Draco. And so bossy! Always ordering Vincent around when they were small, like some little drill sergeant. All ruddy-cheeked in his pretty little robes.”
“So tell me about the prettiest place you’ve ever been,” Ron Weasley is saying, as Draco blinks awake in his pile of blankets.
Al surprises them all by saying, “I think we should do it.”
Also, I feel like the new summary implies a slow-burn, so here is my first and last warning that this fic is not one. Actually, considering how self-indulgent this work is, I think it’s fair to say it’s a fast-burn in the romance department.
Dad barks out a laugh. “His world was turned upside down a long time ago.”
“No, no, no,” Draco whimpers, when Harry pulls off. He kisses the tip of Draco's cock, then licks at his soiled hand. His fingers slide out of Draco's hole next, an embarrassingly wet sound following. He's aching, empty. “Don’t go, please!”
“We must discuss how we will seize the school proper, if this plan is successful,” Voldemort announces. “I hope it won’t surprise you to know that I am trusting the senior Death Eaters in this room to lead the charge with me.”
He’s clearly uncomfortable when his mother presents him to Harry in Diagon Alley of all places, while they’re obviously in the middle of shopping for the upcoming school year, but many Pureblood families have been struggling to reestablish themselves in society after the fall of the Dark Lord, so it’s not a great surprise. Harry has fielded more outrageous, less subtle offers while walking through the Ministry’s halls.
Draco drifts off into a fitful sleep for about a half hour. Harry watches him the whole time, strangely afraid that he won’t wake up again. His fear is unfounded, though, and he’s heartened when Draco complains about being hungry the moment he wakes up. They hail a house elf for delivery. St. Mungo’s patients have menus specific to them--Draco wrinkles his nose in distaste at the steaming porridge dotted with fruit. Harry eats the same thing in solidarity. It is truly as bland as it looks, but Harry’s used to that. He rewards Draco with soft kisses for each bite. Though Draco’s eyes are drooping by the time they’re finished, he complies with Harry’s gentle command to take a quick shower before starting the day. Harry stands by the door in case he’s needed, as always.
For a time, Aunt Bella is undefeated. And then Harry is the next to arrive. His bespectacled gaze searches the crowd, and when he finds Draco, he smiles, raising his hand in greeting. Behind him, Draco can hear the whispers kicking up. “The little orphan,” someone says, and another says “...a fluke, to be sure.”
Draco gasps. “That’s impossible!”
different,” Draco says.
The servants must be sick of them, by now.
He didn’t mean anything by it--he’s just a merchant making a sale, but Draco still fails to tamp down on the sadness his words invoke. It worsens when Father nods imperiously and sets it aside for purchase. Draco has no doubt he’ll have it appraised and then send it off to the Newcastle estate. Swallowing, Draco does what he does best, and maintains the aimless chatter until Father is content with his haul and bids Borgin goodbye.
Harry sighs. “Me too, sweet boy. But we can’t right now, you know that. The Dark Lord was very clear about the edict.”
“He’s just jealous! Bet you can’t stop thinking about the way little Draco rode Potter like a prize stallion. Never knew he had it in him! And did you hear what Potter had him saying—” Amycus says.
“Like this, sweetheart?” He asks.
To his surprise, he spots Irina Bolotin in the crowd, standing stalwart in a sharp three-piece suit. She’s got her arms crossed behind her back, smiling tightly amongst a knot of curious Death Eaters. She seems to be fielding their conversation with none of the poorly-contained irritation Harry remembers from his time sequestered away at her castle.
“Baby? What’s wrong?”
“We could draw from the stock in global dominions, surely,” says Rodolphus. “It is a promising idea, Mr. Nott.”
“Maybe later, if you’re still in. I have a lot to do right now.” He replies, squeezing the slender fingers in his grasp.
“Mind yourself, Kain!” The one on the right says, in a thick Highland brogue. “That’s Draco Potter!”
It’s like a switch flips, somewhere in his head, and soon he’s riding the thrill of heat racing down his spine and fucking greedily into Harry’s warm mouth. He can feel himself getting close, but it feels too good to stop, and he’s hoping that Harry will take pity on him and let him come.
The Citadel is stark and severe in varying shades of white and black marble, chaotically decorated with paintings and artifacts looted from the people the Dark Lord’s forces have conquered. There’s a calculated disorder in the still paintings and busts and shifting magical items locked behind wards. On the way, they pass the remainder of the glittering Imperial eggs taken from Russia. Voldemort has absently mentioned wanting to complete the set, but they’re scattered around the world--and one of them is lovingly displayed in Draco’s things back at the estate in Newcastle. Taking it had been impulsive (he’d been thinking only of trying to participate in the celebrations his new mate held dear), but staring at the rest of the set is an ugly reminder that some of their suffering is of Harry’s making.
Today Draco falls into his stance with excitement, and Harry grins, doing the same.
The Healer strongly recommends that Draco avoid heavy magic use for another few days. He also hands Harry a list of recipes for prenatal potions, which Draco eagerly snatches up, excitement clear on his face as he paces back and forth, mouthing the ingredients to himself.
Behind Father, the back door swings open, and out steps their Grandfather, which makes both of them tense up. “Draco, your ill-behaved progeny will not distract me from our conversation.”
Harry gives him a leering smile. “Of course.”
“So what is an Omega supposed to do if they’re trying to report domestic abuse?” Harry remembers asking, horrified.
Harry knows all of Draco’s cues, now--recognizes the high pitch of those moans, knows what the shaking thighs and greedy rolls of his hips mean. It’s almost cruel to pull back and slide a finger inside, knowing how close he is to coming, but the keening moan that bursts from Draco’s lips is worth it. The wet heat sucks his finger in, and Draco bucks harshly the moment Harry’s finger tip brushes over his prostate.
“If you’ll just point Nene here to your tent, he can drop it off for you.”
“Mrs. Avery,” Draco says, smiling through his nerves. “Thank you for inviting us.”
“Always,” Dad says, looking bemused at the question, but then he sees Father rolling his eyes and subsides with a little groan.
“Now I know why you were so eager to leave us all behind,” Ron barks. “You’re bloody well living it up!”
They have to get used to a healer stopping by every other day to check in on Lucius. Al, who has gone his entire life seeing only a certain set of faces in his home, is pretty nervous about it. Who knows who’s talking to who? How far can the secret of a fidelus be stretched? There’s another pit of fears that whisper that they might be going to another funeral soon.
“There is nothing to forgive, though I’m worried about the amount of socialization you’re getting if you’ve resorted to trying to find conversation in the help,” Thicknesse replies, voice wry. “Speak plainly, Draco. Why have you locked yourself away from us?”
“Still, it was a failure on my part. If you are in need of a favor, do let me know.”
“Did I wake you? I’m sorry. I have to pray,” Draco is murmuring, around a yawn.
Harry smiles. “Absolutely not.”
Draco nods in understanding. He doesn’t sit back in his chair, choosing instead to cross his legs and hug Harry’s arm to his chest, leaning close for support. Harry feels a rush of feeling a lot deeper than affection. He’s all of a sudden hyper-aware of the peach scent of Draco’s favorite shampoo, his familiar Omega scent beneath, and the way they slot together like they were meant for it. The voices of everyone around them sound as indistinct as if they were underwater, and he’s only drawn out of his odd reverie by the arrival of the first few contestants. As is usual, a group fight is first, which decides who will fight who and when.
“How much time do we have?” Harry asks, numbly.
The other letters left for him are not as immediately frustrating as the howlers, but no less stressful for it. There’s a letter from Auror Davies asking him back to the department to discuss next steps; another from Pansy’s father Harlan, always eager for business support (working with him had been one of many partnerships astutely recommended by Pettigrew as a way to generate wealth); several dozen from a menagerie of wizarding publications desperate to get some word from him on current events, or at the very least some photos of Draco around the home in domestic bliss. Apparently his pregnancy has created quite the buzz in societal pages, Merlin save them.
“Like hell it isn’t,” Ron bursts out.
Draco found out in his Yuletide search just how much Harry looks like his father, but it doesn’t really sink in until he sees a photo of the two of them together. James holds a sleeping Harry up beside his face with a goofy grin.  Draco’s seen this exact same smile aimed his way so many times.
“Shh, you did so well, sweetheart,” Harry is murmuring, dropping kisses onto his face and neck.
“How?”
“What was her name?” Draco asks.
“It was all I knew! Even at Hogwarts, I avoided Half-Bloods. I had no idea Pansy was even interested in Milicent Bulstrode because she hid it from me so well. Harry, things are different with you. You’ve shown me so many things, but it’s overwhelming sometimes. When Umbridge started--making all those intimations about my character, all I saw was the enemy trying to threaten my baby.” He croaks over the last few words, taking in a harsh breath to calm himself.
A swell of nausea sends him leaning listlessly to the left. He overextends himself and falls onto his side, his already tender head bouncing harshly against the cobblestone. He closes his eyes.
“You’re going to look pregnant,” He corrects, kissing Draco’s temple.
The rest of the papers have been covered in blurry photos, putting faces to some names. Harry sees his father (
He tucks some of Draco’s hair behind his ear, chuckling as Draco makes a show of looking away from him. It takes only a few agonizing seconds of the pouty cold shoulder for Harry to sigh and press himself along Draco’s back, kissing his neck. Harry’s cock is straining hard through his trousers, so much that it must be painful. Draco grinds his arse back against him, smiling despite himself at Harry's soft groan.
Harry sighs. “The way you lot speak sometimes.”
Theo squawks and then lets out a soft laugh. “You can be so improper.”
When Harry tells him about their guests, the first thing Draco says is, “Maybe I should make myself scarce when they’re around.”
“He’s so mean! And we never talk.” Lily complains.
He’s a lovely thing, to be sure, Harry thinks. Tall, for an omega--taller, even, than Harry--and straight-backed. His light blond hair is cut charmingly short, and his gray eyes meet Harry’s with an intriguing mix of shyness and confidence. Then he follows his mother’s lead and dips into a practiced curtsey, and Harry thinks, oh no, he’s one of
Harry gives him another finger and doesn’t dignify him with a response, opting instead to lick at where his wet rim is stretched over questing fingers. His rhythm is slow but consistent, fingers so firm over Draco’s prostate that each movement elicits sighing moans that he doesn’t even bother to contain. Pregnancy seems to have erased all of his shyness and replaced it with greed. He lies back, lazily stroking himself and taking Harry’s fingers, clenching tight when they’re seated fully just to enjoy the sensation of being filled.
They bicker playfully, trading ideas of increasingly ridiculous tasks to prove their love. It is a conversation Draco will not forget for the rest of his life.
A short silence stretches between them. Harry’s giving him an attentive look when he glances up, so he breathes in and continues.
“Yes,” Draco answers, smiling in bemusement at Harry’s obvious excitement.
“I was just--worried.” Draco breathes out.
“Take a little more, sweetheart,” Harry says, pressing gently, and Draco breathes in, lowering until his throat spasms in protest.
James, unable to stay away from the gardens too long, happily accepts Scorpius as an assistant gathering materials for another of Father’s potions.
They shuffle about, and Harry spreads his legs as wide as they can go before the foot facing the curtains falls off of the bed completely. Harry circles one finger around his rim, humming at the wetness gathered there, and slides it inside. When Draco whines for more, he spears another finger inside, smiling as Draco reaches down and takes himself in hand. He’s already keyed up, and it’s so embarrassing, but Harry crooks his fingers and scores over his prostate, and Draco’s hand is tight, and he’s already frantic with it, digging his heels into the mattress to fuck up into his fist and meet Harry’s thrusting fingers. The tight coil of heat in his stomach breaks with a snap, and he arches his back and shudders apart, whimpering an approximation of Harry’s name as he paints his fingers with his come.
Draco’s throat tightens. He shoves Harry as hard as he can. Then he does it again, overwhelmed with hurt and relief and an underlying frustration that has him grinding his teeth.
“It’s not that simple.” Draco fusses.
Draco gives him a wide-eyed look. “Of course I am. Did I say something to make you think I wasn’t?”
Scorpius catches Dad in the morning and asks if he can tag along to the restaurant, and Dad’s eyes light up as he says yes. He’d quit the Aurors expressly so he could spend more time with all of them, but there’s a private kind of fun in being the focus of Dad’s zeroed in attention on a work day. Dad’s got a commanding presence when he’s in his work headspace. If you tag along, you’ll be put to work, and there’s something soothing about the teamwork of cutting vegetables and chatting with the employees or working the front counter.
“A little, yes, though I’m more excited than anything,” Draco says.
“You know not to speak unless you are spoken to. I’m sure your mother didn’t raise you to be so uncouth.”
,” Draco says.
“No, that happens sometimes. Do you have a crush you want to tell me about?” Father asks, a hint of teasing in his voice.
Harry lets out a low, deep moan as he finally works his knot in, and then he's emptying himself into Draco's channel, his hand tight where it's holding his thigh up. The stretch is intense, but it's so right, that's how they're meant to be, he's sure of it. Draco climaxes with a whimper. It's a dry, intense flush of feeling, his toes curling and his cock twitching helplessly.
Harry is so baffled that the boy would pull such a destructive spell that he forgets himself for a moment. It is only when the distinctive, coiling flames of Fiendfyre take the shape of a phoenix and rush forth that he reaches over. He cradles Draco’s face in his hands and locks gazes with him.
Harry is surprised by the powerful burst of hurt Draco’s words have caused him. It is easy to forget all that Draco has been raised to believe. In their time together, he has shown tremendous progress on the matter of blood purity, especially for a Pureblood. Still, it speaks volumes that he has resorted to commenting on it in his anger. Harry swallows and ruthlessly tamps down on his distress. As if sensing his upset--and maybe he can, through their bond--Draco turns to him with wide eyes.
I feel the need to point out that I've taken serious creative liberties with the Wheel of the Year and altered some things to fit the world. I think one of the biggest changes is that technically the only deity that wizards who follow the Wheel celebrate is magic itself, which is commonly referred to as the Wild Magic here, with subsets of it given set names (light, dark, necromancy, blood, etc). I encourage you to do your own research to learn more about the Wheel of the Year if you're interested in its real world equivalent--this fic is in no way indicative of how these celebrations actually work!
"Sensitive, baby?" Harry asks, and he's got that gleam in his eyes that means he's found something to fixate on.
“If I could just have more time,” Harry sighs.
“I told him I’d think about it, and I regret it,” Harry admits. “I should have said something earlier. It’s just that I wasn’t actually going to think about it. He didn’t seem to care how you would feel about just having another child.”
He bucks his hips harshly forward, entirely against his better judgment. Draco lets out a loud, hiccuping cry, and Harry grits his teeth and slows to a stop.
“Oh stop, Harry,” Draco says, though his nervous smile widens into a genuine one.
“This was the best way I could think of apologizing. I’ll do whatever you want me to. You can do what you want with what I’ve told you. I’ll understand. I deserve Azkaban or worse,” Anezka sniffles. She wipes her face on her fine silk robes, and the gesture fills Draco with such a ridiculous amount of hate that he has to avert his gaze completely. “I’ve prayed so much since that day. I’m so grateful to the Wild Magic for giving you the strength to keep us all alive, but I can’t stop thinking about what might have happened if it hadn’t.”
Draco lets out a little sob of relief and wraps his arms around Harry’s neck.
He’d been warned to expect it. Everyone from his mother, to his healer, to his giggly friends and tutting family acquaintances, have told him in so many words that Alphas feel the urge to protect during such a vulnerable time. The first time he did it, he’d been exhausted and drained from a difficult home birth, no doubt looking sweaty and disheveled on their bed, as Scorpius snuffled his way to one heavy breast and latched on. Harry had stared until Draco found himself flushing and whining for him to look away, which only worked for about three whole seconds, before those owlish green eyes were back on them.
Ginny hugs him tightly when he steps inside. Just like Fred, his siblings have retained their youthful look, though Ron’s face is drawn with a familiar anger and George’s is scarily blank. Unsure of what to say, Harry holds his hands out for them to hold, and the world twists.
He lets out a breathy laugh at the way Harry pauses, hand tight around his wand. He is not used to his enemies talking to him, and the shock of it has shaken him out of his blood lust. The world seemed to have caught on fairly quickly that attempting to reason with Voldemort’s forces is never fruitful. Most who fight back do so with the intent to kill, not to persuade.
Draco gestures towards his ribs with a frown and lets out a miserable sound when Harry makes a tutting noise of sympathy. Together they get him propped up against a few pillows, and when he settles, Draco holds one of Harry’s hands between his with all of his strength.
“You’re such a good boy,” Harry says, smiling down at him.
He’d greeted them with a shaky nod and a polite enough, “Potters,” looking about as ghoulish as James had ever seen him, and he’d seen clippings from his Azkaban trials. It was a small, private ceremony, but there were enough Weasleys and family and friends about to make Father, Scorpius, and especially Lucius stand out with their distinctive white blond hair. Lucius stood away from everyone else, and did not speak unless spoken to, but he’d listened to guests talk about his wife with an open hunger.
charm. “Mr. Potter, you forget yourself.”
In a flash of brilliant white light, a snake falls writhing to the ground. Once it rights itself, a rolling hiss falls from its mouth, neck flaring out to the sides in a brilliant display. Harry kneels as it slithers over to him, coiling to strike. And then he speaks. “
One by one, the Richmond witnesses are called, each of them accompanied by the closest Alpha or Beta relative. Sonja’s closest relative was the man leading her questioning so she was exempted from the requirement. Some witnesses are joined by spouses, some by their adult children, others by cousins or uncles or aunts. Despite their fear and disgust over what happened, each and every witness offers their firm support of Draco’s actions, especially Daphne, Pansy, and the vaguely familiar Anezka Newman, who trembles like a leaf the entire time. Their story is so uniquely unwavering that it would look coordinated to anyone who didn’t know better. Harry glances at the few reporters settled at the back of the room. He’s sure he’ll be reading a headline with wording along those lines very soon.
Draco is terribly shy about the maneuvering process and blushes to the roots of his hair when he finds himself turned around, facing Harry’s slowly filling cock as Harry kneads his arse cheeks.
Draco nods. “And then she began to use her wand. I don’t even know what spell she was going to use--she didn’t say anything--and I just panicked. I’m pregnant. I--I’ve really wanted a child, and I didn’t want her to hurt my baby.”
