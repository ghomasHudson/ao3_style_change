“I suppose I would have to have a sex life to actually spruce it up.”  Draco admitted, his frown mirroring Harry’s thoughts.
“Looks like nothing.” Ron said, looking like he was enjoying Harry’s mishap a little too much.
Harry was unsure of what to say once he was seated and tried for small talk. “Nice place you have here.” It sounded lame to his own ears and he felt his face flush when Draco let out a snort.
“Don’t smile at me.” Draco ordered, without even looking at Harry. Harry’s smile got bigger.
“You want me to play Quidditch at your event?” Harry asked, slowly, sure he had misheard. “Why would I do that?”
“Here mate, Hermione made a fruit platter.”  Ron handed over a colorful tray stacked with a variety of fruit, that Ron clearly didn’t approve of, lowering his voice he added, “I don’t know who’s going to eat fruit while they’re drinking.”
When they got back from flying, Draco seemed to be in better spirits.  It had even been twenty minutes since he had mentioned anything about the virus or self isolation and Harry thought that a little distraction was all he needed.  That idea quickly died.  As soon as they set foot in the house, Draco made his way straight to the wireless.
“Not only Quidditch, but all sports, racing, and all those seedy little muggle gambling places he likes to go to with the flashing lights and cards.”
Then had the nerve to sneer down at him. Harry huffed to himself and then tried to concentrate on his work. An impossible feat, with everything that had happened this morning.
“You have money.” Draco said, flabbergasted.
Draco was surprised to wake up to an owl, quietly watching him in his sleep. Usually owls were not so patient and made annoying noises until the recipient woke and noticed them.  When the owl noticed Draco was awake it hopped over to him holding out it’s leg.  The paper was spelled to a small size, but as soon as Draco unrolled it, it sprang to a full sized sheet of paper. It was a detailed schedule, outlining practice dates and team meetings. Attached was also a play directory and a note requesting every player to get familiar with it before their first practice in three days.
Harry leaned forward, placing his hands on either side of himself on the edge of the sofa. “I said what I could to save you the trouble of being shipped off to Azkaban, I didn’t say it to impress you.” He felt heat building in his chest, his cheeks going scarlet.
“Now and then.” Malfoy’s voice sounded something just short of sad.
to kill Dumbledore? Are you that stupid?” He wobbled on his feet, and Harry held onto him with more force. Malfoy sneered at him.
Malfoy tasted like nothing. Harry distinctly remembered kissing Ginny and tasting something sweet, and kissing Cho and tasting salty tears, he had never kissed anyone and not been able to identify it. It made Harry irrationally angry that he wouldn’t be able to remember a taste to Malfoy’s mouth. He was so furious that he barely registered Malfoy kissing him back. Malfoy’s lips didn’t fit right, and Harry let out a half-growl in frustration. Harry’s hands fell away from Malfoy’s collar, and he reached up to cup Malfoy’s cheeks in his hands before he’d even realized what he was doing.
“Neville suggested it actually and no one raised an objection.” Longbottom? Well that was certainly a surprise. If anyone would have invited him it would have been Luna. Since their stare down two weeks ago though, Draco supposed he’d been warmer to him.
Draco listened to it all, still playing the outsider. But he smiled at how easy going it all was. Joking about the war caught him off guard though. Luna, who knew about his writing habit, grabbed his hand. It twitched whenever he had the urge. Draco didn’t know if she’d been told by Ginny, or had merely observed. Though he’d guess the latter. She was the only person he knew who could match him in observational skills. They’d begun passing notes subtly to each other with amusing observations. Though sometimes Luna’s had to do with some magical creature around that he barely had heard of.
stay tuned for the next chapter in which harry and draco will interact some more. who's excited?
“What?” he asked incredulously, “What could you possibly need my help with?”
The conversation moved on and on they all chatted. It was a day off and they’d all decided they needed a break so no one had anywhere to go. The time drifted on and Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder at one point and next he knew he was being gently shaken awake.
also currently (and always) stanning the ever loving hell out of daniel radcliffe. trans women are women why is that so difficult for people?
“You can ask anything you want later, for now you are going to talk to Harry and sort this all out. And this time you really don’t have a choice.”
“Really? Do you think she likes me back? We hang out loads and we talk about everything and anything and sometimes I think we might kiss, but we never talk about romantic stuff.”
“Understood?”
“Fine.”
“We asked the Weasley girl if she knew where you disappeared to every night, since she’s apparently your new bestie,” Pansy said.
Draco just stared at his two friends. Standing in front him with hurt and worry battling for dominance over their features. Where was his quill? He wanted to write about the small waves on the banks of the lake or the way the grass beneath his feet was all crushed. Anything but the way his friends looked right now. He hated himself.
final chapter!!! lmk if you want me to post another with just their letters. enjoy!
“I would not be thinking about that when I kiss. I have a very single minded focus on whatever task I am in the midst of.”
He also felt a distinct lack of Potter’s general presence. He didn’t come to the library to do work and he even managed to make himself disappear from the hallways. The only way Draco knew he was even still at Hogwarts was because they had classes together.
“Be nice if she said that to more people.” he said looking up at the sky, “My reputation isn’t well -- you know.” They stopped talking. Draco let his tiredness win and fell asleep right there.
so this is the part where i reveal that i am a slut for writing angst. i love fluff but i cheat on it with angst on the daily. no shame honestly. also i promise we will get an in person Harry eventually, but for now this is what you get. i'll probably post the next chapter later today, but this felt like a natural stopping point.
“I’m glad you came,” she said while everyone started packing up, Draco gave her the smallest closed lip smile and walked away before she could say more.
“I thought that I would write a few letters for Ginny with some observations, you’d ask her out and that would be it. But you wrote back and you kept writing back and it got personal. You started sharing all these private things with me and reassuring me. I should have stopped, but I couldn’t. I meant what I said about needing to hear it.” He was struck again by how easy it was to be vulnerable in front of Potter. Whatever magic the letters contained it transferred to in person interaction. Despite the pounding in his ears and the cold breeze, the world was quiet, “I meant everything I wrote.”
He had very limited options if he didn’t want to turn and literally run away. So he went up to Potter, who was wearing his uncomfortable smile, and did not look him in the eye. Instead Draco looked at the grass and thought about how’d he describe the way it was all crushed under his foot.
“Oh, that’s a little tricky,” he said and explained how without the mugroot, there’d be nothing to stabilize the rest of the mixture, “That’d be about where you’d lose your eyebrows. I’d reckon to say that your glasses wouldn’t appreciate it either.”
“Of course,” she said. Luna flew forward a few steps to link their arms and pull her away. Her version of damage control.
“And yet you can write a portrait of notes about the room and still be able to understand homework.” Harry said.
“Fine, if I must, but I’m comfortable.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Um, Draco. Draco, you have visitors.” As if summoned by his thoughts Luna was coming toward him, along with Ginny and Potter.
“I never do, do I?” The longer he talked to her, the more he put off talking to Potter.
“Oh shut it, I wasn’t going to rant. Now Harry, there are a couple of strands that need fixing.” Draco lied. Certainly not the sake of putting his hands in Harry’s hair again or for the excuse to be close to him.
Wandering around Hogsmeade was a completely different situation than the library. The companionable quiet and help, now replaced with lively conversation and witty banter.
“Thank you. I seemed to have discovered a talent as a ghost writer.”
“Yes, I am,” Harry said and then completely took Draco’s hand. Another thing he’d learned from Draco about Draco - he got more of a word in edgewise if he held Draco’s hand.
Draco didn’t have the words, so he walked forward and hugged her. She buried her face in the crook of his neck and Blaise wrapped his arms around both of them. Draco realized how long it had been since he’d had physical human contact. It felt so good. They all used to have such consistent touching -- walking arm in arm, resting with each other’s heads in their lap, playing with each other’s hair. It had been months without that and he hadn't realize how terrible it'd been without it.
“I’m doing okay. Eighth year classes are no joke though. I’m surprised we all agreed to go out with all the work we have piling up.”
“Now hand me the hair tie, thank you.” Harry passed it to Draco who had his hands tangled up in Harry’s hair. “That should do it, the perfect messy bun.”
handwriting is ghost that will haunt. emotions will be felt. endings will happen. and of course more letters.
“Of course, why do you ask?” Draco had been nothing but honest with Harry since he found out about his and Ginny’s deal. In fact he told Harry almost everything. He turned back to face him.
“Someone else?” If she said any name other than Luna’s Draco was going to punch her.
“You are actually so good at this, you know.” Ginny said to him when she finished reading his most recent letter. They’d been getting both harder and easier to write and it was making Draco feel things. On one hand the words came much easier to him now. The correspondence was something he looked forward to getting to continue. It was wonderful to pen his thoughts and have them be received so openly. To his surprise, Potter had turned into an excellent conversation partner.
“So you’re writing love letters to Potter? This is going to go well.”
“Malfoy, what are you doing here?!” He held up the bottle of Firewhisky he had been planning on downing in response.
“I need you to write some letters for me. I’m no good at it or at sappy romantic stuff, but there is this guy I really like and I want you to write me love letters for him.” Trust a Gryfinddor to come up with such a ridiculous and bold face plan.
“I have follow up questions on the drinking,” Harry whispered to him. The table was always really cramped and Draco felt Harry's breath in his ear.
The only thing that got frustrating was Draco’s constantly elevated heart rate. How could he still allow one person to have so much control over him? He thought about Harry constantly, it got quite infuriating. And every little thought he scrawled out in a letter and Harry responded with observations of his own. Many of them going back to sixth year.
“Just listen, I had this really great idea just now. I need your help with something and in exchange Luna and I will work with you to restore your reputation.”
“At first I thought, maybe Ginny shared them with you, but she would never do that. My next thought was that it had to be a coincidence because no way you noticed all these things about me and were interested in my hair. But then I saw your notes earlier and no one can ignore that much evidence. I’m honestly kinda surprised that neither of you thought about handwriting. There’s got to be a spell or something to mimic handwriting and you’re both so smart and I don’t get how you missed that.
Harry starts replying. Draco has friends. In person Harry still m.i.a but I promise he'll be here. this is incredibly Draco focused
It was over a week before he got the letter.
“Want to go for a walk?” Potter asked and Draco nodded. They walked in awkward silence until they were out of ear shot of their friends. Draco tried to figure how to phrase his apology, which was especially hard because he hated apologizing, plus he was terrible at it. He was going to get the words all wrong - this is why he preferred writing, more time to think.
“We’re worried, Draco,” Blaise said, “We know you sneak out to drink all the time and that you are self isolating. We aren’t blind for Merlin’s sake.”
Draco and Luna stayed at each other’s side. Both of them constantly snuck glances over at Potter and Ginny, but pretended they weren’t. At some point Neville came up to walk with them.
“Don’t ask him that, please Potter. He’ll go off and as glad as I am to have fussy Draco back, I did not miss the rants.” Blaise sat on the next bench over reading a book and giving commentary on Draco the hairdresser.
“What is this?” She asked again.
(See the end of the chapter for
No one really spoke to him, but no one glared at him either. They sat by year, so people could whisper questions to each other. Draco sat next to Lovegood, who smiled at him.
“Nope, sorry.”
“I understand,” Draco said and he felt himself begin to buckle under the weight of the oncoming rubble.
“But see the thing is, I’m not angry. I ought to be, but I’m not, which is confusing. So I figured I’d give you a chance to explain your side of the story. We’ll see how I feel after, I guess.”
“Oh hello, Harry,” Luna said, showing back up again with Ginny at her side, “Do you mind if I get my bags, please?” Draco had already stood up and began heading towards the door.
When he got to his usual spot though, Blaise and Pansy were there waiting for him.
“You should tell her,” he said, thanking anyone that was out there for this moment. Luna was going to be ecstatic.
“Which bit?” Potter pointed to his scroll, but Draco couldn’t see it from where he was seated at the other table. So Potter stood up and took Luna’s seat next to him. She had gone with Ginny to help her look for a book for some essay. Draco had winked at her as they disappeared between the stacks.
“Well that’s annoying, but I understood today’s lesson so let me help. See here,” he reached to pull out his Potions notes and work. He pointed to the part Potter was asking about so he could teach him what they'd covered in the second half of the lesson. It was only when Potter tensed slightly did he realize his error. Potter’s eyes stuck immediately to the words on the page. Draco tried to ignore it, pretend nothing was happening and kept talking. He began walking Potter through what they had learned. Potter just sat there silently staring.
Malfoy took a step to the side, giving Harry room to pass him. “I’ve been stuck up here alone all day, you know.” He sounded as though he was trying to be nonchalant, but he wasn’t hiding the note of desperation in his voice very well.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, but he didn’t look uncomfortable. “Well, it’s called being an
Harry was tying his shoelaces as Malfoy instructed him where to go his flat and what to do.
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly. He was internally trying to push away a million different images that popped into his head. Malfoy lying bloody on the bathroom floor of Hogwarts, Malfoy shielding his face after being hit by hundreds of tiny pieces of glass at Malfoy Manor, the Malfoy Harry had seen through the eyes of Voldemort, and finally, Hermione’s fist against Malfoy’s nose.
Malfoy pulled a face of disgust, “You think I’d look better covered in blood?”
me, you twat!” Malfoy grabbed the coffee table to pull himself back into a standing position. His cheeks were so red that Harry thought he looked sunburnt.
Harry found himself smiling. “Shut it, Malfoy.”
Normally this would cause a mild panic, but instead Harry felt relaxed. Malfoys shuffled around, and Harry heard him chuckle.
“Because you’re…” Malfoy hesitated. “If you’d...if you’d
“Yeah, well.” Malfoy shrugged. “The least I could get is a thank you.”
So when Harry brought himself downstairs and found Malfoy waiting beside the stairs yet again, he felt his face flush with embarrassment, before he’d even said good morning.
“She was thinking we could come to yours, just the two of us.” Ron added.
Harry placed the papers back on his desk and stood up from his chair. He recast the charm on his eyes, bringing the world back into proper focus before him.
When Harry reached the bedroom, he slammed the door behind himself. He leaned his back against it, his breath falling heavy and fast. He felt a million different things at once as he stood there, his chest heaving. Harry was so undeniably
Harry looked up at Malfoy through his eyelashes, and Malfoy stuck a leg on either side of Harry, pinning him in place. Harry studied the blurry freckles on his cheeks with mild interest. The shape of his jaw, the vague curve of his lips, the-
“OK, lunch.” Harry mumbled, and started making his way through the pile on his desk.
“I’m sure it would look good on you!”
them? How did you manage that?”
Harry felt the knot in his stomach tie itself up another two times. “I didn’t know you felt that way.” He said quietly, contorting his face into a frown.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek. "Do you ever regret what you did?"
Harry was barely listening. “Sure.” He said lamely. His brain would not quit. He cast a charm on himself, his eyesight temporarily cleared.
Harry felt his cheeks burning as well, he

to Malfoy, and he most certainly wasn’t gay...was he? No, he couldn’t be, he really
“Hold on,” He said to his phone screen. “Did you find everything okay?” He asked Harry.
“You never said you didn’t.” Harry argued fiercely. He didn’t know why he was so angry all of a sudden, but he knew he wanted Malfoy to feel it too.
“Why would I need saving?” Harry asked, his voice a near whisper.
Harry swore in that moment he felt his heart stop for a millisecond. “Absolutely not.”
Harry kept his mouth shut. He eyeballed the pink jumper he had on in the mirror. It smelled like lavender.
Harry did as he was told, and watched as Malfoy ruffled through his things. He brought out a little pencil and a compact and made his way back toward Harry. Harry pulled his glasses off, placing them on the coffee table.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, unsure of what to say. Malfoy, however, beat him to it.
Malfoy hung his head. “She wouldn’t have wanted me to become this.”
Harry felt an odd mixture of guilt and graciousness fill him. “Thanks, Ron.” He said, twirling his fork between his fingers.
“Don’t make enough noise for the neighbours to hear, alright?” Malfoy huffed, leaning his back against the wall. “It would be hard to explain.”
into Malfoy like that. There was no way, they were hardly even friends.
to support Voldemort!” Harry snarled. He stood up, reaching forward and yanking Malfoy to his feet as well. He didn’t let go of Malfoy, only bringing them face to face.
Malfoy continued attempting to read the chat as it flew up the screen. Harry leaned closer to take a look, and saw that there were over one million people watching them right at that moment, and Harry felt oddly embarrassed.
Harry leapt forward, “Are you okay?” He questioned, reaching forward.
Harry felt smug, “So you’d rather wear one of Ron’s jumpers than your old bloody one?” He teased, Malfoy pulled a face of disgust.
“No, I’m sure it wouldn’t!”
Harry approached the closet wearily, there were so many items to choose from. He was drawn to the darker items in the closet, as in Harry’s mind Malfoy was typically dressed in black. Or green.
Draco nodded slowly. "Only if I had to."
Malfoy scoffed. “Saved me? You really do always need to be the hero, don’t you?”
to do all the horrible things I did. To say all the horrible things I said. To you, to Wealsey, to Granger." He paused. His voice sounded sad. "It was only in the end when I realized that none of this could save me or my family at all.”
“Harry and I better get going. Thank you for watching, I love you guys.” said Malfoy. He smiled and pressed a button on the screen, shutting off the video of them. He turned to Harry.
“Where did you get that?” Harry asked loudly, and Malfoy looked up from his phone screen.
don’t.”
It was to Harry’s dismay that he realized he was growing used to Malfoy’s midnight screaming. This time, however, Harry didn’t go to stop it. It felt like a knife to his stomach to lie there in the dark, listening to Malfoy cry out two floors below. Harry wanted to get up, he did, but the part of him that was humiliated overpowered the part of him that was worried. It felt like torture to lay there doing nothing but listening until Malfoy’s nightmare finally ended.
Harry had leisurely taken to his side to once again to try and wake the sleeping monster, but it was with no luck that Malfoy had stopped and fallen right back to sleep. Harry had a hard time drifting off after that, he found himself worrying what Malfoy was dreaming of, and then when he realized he was actually
As if on cue, Malfoy’s distant voice came. “Kreacher? When’s Potter going to return?”
“I will
Thank you for reading the first chapter, I'm not sure how long this fic will be but I'm really excited to write it! Kudos and comments are greatly appreciated!
thank you so much for reading!! I hope you're all enjoying this fic!
“Er...vans?” Harry hesitated, he wasn’t much of a fashionable person himself.
“That’s it? You
“You pushed me!” Malfoy cried back, scrambling to pull himself off the ground.
On his home screen was a photograph of Malfoy, not that Harry
about Malfoy, he laid there in shame.
Harry shrugged. “I could have tried.”
Harry shrugged at an outdated picture on the wall. It shrugged right back. “Is there something else you would like me to say?”
“‘Course I’m tired.” Harry grunted, looking over his shoulders to the stairs below. The clock on the wall made a face like someone sticking their tongue out at him, Harry stuck his tongue out back.
Malfoy nodded enthusiastically. “Let me do it, if you hate it we will never speak of this again.”
Malfoy had kissed him back...yet he had also
“You would have been brilliant no matter which house you were placed in. You’re Harry bloody Potter, it wouldn’t have mattered in the end.”
Ron was fiddling with the hem of his coat awkwardly. “Are you sure you’re alright mate?” He asked quietly, sounding worried.
Harry laughed. “I’m only doing what a good host would.”
Malfoy sat quietly at the table, his phone in hand. He was wearing what looked like a terribly old maroon jumper, and Harry stared at it for a long time before he realized it was most certainly
“I need you to go to my flat and bring some of my things here.” Malfoy explained. He looked rather sheepish, as if he had asked Harry to share his deepest secrets. Harry was just glad it wasn’t one of the embarrassing things he’d thought of.
Malfoy shot Harry a smile, and Harry found himself feeling more confused than he had ever felt in his life.
“You couldn’t have.” Draco said calmly.
If Harry had turned around, he would see Malfoy scrunch up his face in frustration, resembling that of a little kid not getting what he wants.
Malfoy was holding a proud look upon his face. “I’ve put you on Instagram, just so you know.”
“Harry, we
.” He growled.
His eyes were encased with black, and Harry hardly recognized himself. The green in his eyes stood out proudly amongst the darkness that surrounded them, and his cheeks and nose were a soft peach colour. Harry was so blown away he thought perhaps Malfoy had replaced this mirror with a charmed one in the time Harry had his eyes closed. He turned to look at Malfoy behind him.
“I know.” Harry said simply, continuing toward the second flight of stairs.
Malfoy looked slightly apprehensive. “I don’t have anything to wear.”
“I think you wanted to prove yourself.” Harry snapped, his face red.
Though Harry had been to Ron and Hermione’s countless times, it felt as though he hadn’t left London in years.
Harry had never said anything like that out loud before, but he meant it. The pink that spread across Draco’s cheeks was worth it.
"Potter," he mumbles to himself, "On muggle radio."
"Potter," he repeats, steadier this time, "On muggle radio."
"Don't we all, ABBA," he muttered under his breath, "don't we all."
The Daily Prophet speculated wildly about where he was and what he was doing; some saying Potter was living as a recluse in the Forbidden Forest and eating Acromantuals, some saying he'd joined the circus as a sword-swallower and the Quibbler saying he was quite happily wooing Blibbering Bandersnatches in the North Pacific sea and would be back around the holidays.
Muggles had such fascinating ways of preserving music. Nothing as elegant as the record player but Draco was fond of the radio. He liked listening to the scratchy but upbeat music and the radio hosts cheerful banter.
Needless to say, Draco mused, getting up from his desk, the whereabouts of Potter was still widely regarded as a mystery and an interesting one at that.
"Prat."
Besides, what little of the fortune remained, he donated towards charity and the rebuilding of Hogwarts.
He shoved his hands in his pockets and, deciding he wasn't going to get any more work done, went to help Narcissa in the garden.
He sighed again and looked down at the essays he was grading and fought off an impending headache.
Is that...?
"Anyway, due to popular request, next I'll be playing Jacob Banks 'Unknown'. For those of you not in the know, Jacob Banks is an up-and-coming artist born in Nigeria and raised in Birmingham with a voice so smooth and deep it'll give you chills. Following that, we'll be playing 'Mercy' and my personal favorite, 'Monster.' I'll be right back after a word from our sponsors!"
Granger and Weasley, despite being questioned numerous times, remained steadfastly close-lipped about the whole situation and the Weaslette had shrugged and suggested everyone 'bugger off and leave the poor sod alone.'
"For those of you just tuning in, I'm Harry Potter and I'm dead envious of you. Can't remember the last time I was able to sleep in past 8 o'clock."
He stares absently down at his essay and then out the window and into his gardens. He can just see the top of his mother's hat and knows she must be planting her tulips.
Perhaps he'd be less shell-shocked if the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Die-And-Live-Again hadn't disappeared from public eye shortly after the war. He'd stayed to help rebuild Hogwarts and then he was gone without so much as a 'by your leave.'
"Muggle radio," he said again and couldn't help the snort that escaped him.
The War had seen most of the Malfoy fortune liquidated and relinquished to the Ministry as penance and while Draco did sorely miss not having to work his bloody arse off, he can't say he misses it too much. It's freeing, in a way, to be able to earn his own money.
He sighed and ran a hand through his platinum hair.
A warm laugh that has Draco sitting upright in his chair, vexing essays forgotten.
"No wonder Snape was always a miserable git," he muttered, scribbling question marks over a fifth-year Ravenclaw's poorly constructed essay on the properties of gillyweed.
A heavy sigh. Draco's heart leaps into his throat and he grips his quill so hard it snaps in his hand.
The lighting in the drawing room was rather awful, it was dim and uneven. Harry wasn’t sure
“Do you honestly think I
Harry shook his head. “No, it’s just-“
“Is Harry my boyf-“ Malfoy cut himself off, his cheeks going red. “No, he wishes.”
There was a large sofa to Harry’s right, it was dark brown leather, and in front sat a coffee table that was also made of glass. Harry looked around in wonder. A book sat open on the coffee table and Harry noticed a shelf full of books against the wall behind the sofa. Harry made his way around the flat, which was much larger than he had anticipated. He came across muggle photographs of Malfoy and other people Harry didn’t recognize, as well as one celebrity he did. The kitchen was made up in marble and dark wood. Malfoy’s cooking appliances looked barely used, and he had half a pot of cold coffee still sitting out on the counter beside the sink. When Harry made his way down the hallway of the flat, he found a guest bedroom that looked like it had come straight out of a shopping catalogue. The bathroom in the hallway was also very neat and shiny. Harry could tell Malfoy prefered his place to be spotless.
By lunch Harry had fallen asleep on his desk twice, and thank Merlin for Ron, because it was him who woke Harry.
“Miss what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No need to look so worried, Potter. I only just got up.” Malfoy drawled, leaning his body casually against the railing. The railing gave an awful groan against the weight and Malfoy propped himself up by his crutches at lightning speed, looking alarmed.

They ate in silence, Malfoy scrolled through his phone while Harry sipped on his coffee quietly. It occurred to Harry that he was stuck with Malfoy for more than a few days. The two of them hadn’t been stuck in anything together since their school years, and Harry thoughtfully realized he wasn’t sure he and Malfoy had a single thing in common.
“It wasn’t a walk in the park, you know. I spent a great number of those years locked in a cupboard under the stairs.” Harry said it as a throw away line, but Malfoy started.
“I’ll see you at lunch then, Harry.”
’ Harry nodded along dumbly.
“I know.” Ron replied immediately.
Harry’s face went up in flames. “Your followers are going to
Ron sighed and resumed eating his food. “I don’t see why, it’s not as though everyone hates you.” He mumbled around a mouthful of food.
“What?” He seemed earnest, as though he was genuinely interested. Harry wasn’t quite fooled, Malfoy would only be luring Harry in to take the piss out of him.
“I forgot them.” Harry provided, snaking through the little walls crowding the area. He was making a great effort not to look Ron in the eye, as if Ron could read his mind through a look.
Harry had pondered this a million times. How much would things have changed if he had only taken Malfoy's hand and introduced himself properly.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek.
fashion, M-” Harry caught himself. “Draco.”
“You spent all those summers with muggles, yet you still dress in jeans and sweatshirts. You’re mad.” Malfoy was teasing, Harry knew that, but still, he felt defensive.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “Then why did you leave me up here all day?”
Harry pulled out a black turtleneck, finding himself easily able to picture it on the tall blonde. He grabbed a few pairs of black jeans, as well as a pair of army green joggers. The first coloured item that caught Harrys attention was a pale pink dress shirt, and he placed it on the bed beside the others. Harry continued picking interesting clothing items, and once he was done he found himself squatting down to look at Malfoy’s shoes. He had quite a few pairs, many of which were black. Harry thought back to his
Harry felt his eyes widen, and he loosened his grip on Malfoy’s collar. “Saving me?” He asked, his voice suddenly falling weak.
Ron. I just did.” Harry sighed. They finally reached his desk and he took a seat.
“I’m not avoiding you.” Harry said dumbly.
, Harry Potter.” Malfoy said at the screen. Harry could see what looked like thousands of tiny comments scrolling up the screen. He thought he caught his name, but he wasn’t quite sure because holy
“Like who? The death eaters?”
Potter it’s been ten bloody years.”
“Well you..you
“But you aren’t a muggle, Draco.”
“Did you get any sleep last night, Harry?” Ron asked, concern evident in his voice.
Harry started, taking a step backward on the landing.
The wall to his left was almost entirely made of glass. It looked out over muggle London and Harry could see as far as the River Thames. Sunlight was shining into the room through gloomy clouds, making everything bright and washed out compared to number Twelve Grimmauld Place.
Malfoy scoffed. “They’re all saying ‘Hello, Harry’ ‘Who is Harry’ and ‘We love you, Harry’.”
Malfoy let out a short laugh. “You seem to forget that for years I
, Potter.”
“Sit down on the couch.”
“The jumper.” Harry said plainly. “It looks like one of Ron’s.”
For the first time that day, Malfoy grinned. “I’ve got a brilliant idea.”
Harry magicked himself a plate of the food that Kreacher had prepared, and he ate quietly. Harry pulled his cellphone out of his pocket, turning it on for the first time that day. He was taken by surprise at the amount of notifications displayed on his screen, but he
me for most of them.” He said pointedly.
Harry hummed in acknowledgement, and made his way toward Draco. He took a seat on the opposite end of the couch.
Sunday night felt like an eternity as Harry lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling. He had
Malfoy adopted a serious look, furrowing his eyebrows. “Perhaps you’re right.”
“But what, Potter? I
“You’re not wearing your glasses.” Was how Ron greeted him when he stepped out of the lift. Harry huffed and folded his arms across his chest.
Harry chuckled, piercing a leaf of lettuce with his plastic fork. “That will be nice. I haven’t been there since-”
“So have you and Hermione set a date yet?” Harry asked as he sat down. He pulled the lid off his salad, grabbing the packet of dressing and ripping it open.
to be like my parents, I did what I did because I wanted to save them. I’d do it again if it meant saving them, and you.”
Harry took another bite of salad, shrugging awkwardly. “I’ve felt like I’m not welcome since Ginny and I…”
(See the end of the chapter for
. “No, I wouldn’t.”
Harry cleared his throat, “I almost died. A number of times, actually. I don’t think you were there to
It worked, as Harry had never heard the word come out of Malfoy’s mouth. “Okay, fine. Since you asked so nicely.”
Malfoy was sitting at the dining table, speaking to his phone.
“You get money for your
“I think I left them by the door. Perhaps you’re off the hook.” Malfoy smiled smugly. He reached forward to move one of the turtlenecks away from the pile and beside his army green joggers. “What do you think, the joggers with the boots,” He pointed toward the single pair of black combat boots sitting to his left, “Or the vans.” He pointed to a pair of flat, black and white checkered shoes to his right.
?” He added the please as if it were an afterthought, something that might persuade Harry.
you didn’t see the white converse?” He asked, looking up at Harry, who was seated on the couch opposite him.
"I regret the things I did to you, Harry." Draco mumbled, turning away from Harry's questioning eyes. "I regret the things I said to Granger."
“I know, none of us lived it through your eyes. That doesn’t change the fact that we needed you Harry, and we still do. The war was hard but none of us will ever move on if
“You never had to-”
Malfoy scoffed halfheartedly, “Yeah, that one’s all on you.”
Ron buttoned his coat. “Why not? It’s not your…” Ron trailed off. Harry glanced up at him and blurry Ron motioned toward his own forehead.
to try and kill Dumbledore.
It buzzed in his palm like something itching to be used, and Harry realized with a jolt of uneasiness that it felt familiar since he had disarmed Malfoy in Malfoy Manor all those years ago and been forced to use it. This was the same hawthorn wand Harry had used against Voldemort, the wand that had cause Voldemort’s curse to rebound on himself, the wand that had helped Harry kill Voldemort. Harry wondered vaguely how long it had been since Malfoy had used the wand, it seemed rather weird that it would be placed into a box in the back of his closet. It was as though Malfoy had put any reminder of his magic into those boxes, asides from the Slytherin robes. Harry placed the photographs back into the box and put the lid back on. He put both the boxes back where they belonged in the back of the closet, Malfoy’s wand still in hand, and stood up from the floor. Harry rolled the wand between his hands, feeling the magic buzz like electricity between his fingers. He thought about putting it back inside the cloth in the box, but something persuaded Harry to keep it. Harry shoved the wand into his pocket and continued his hunt for Malfoy’s stuff. When Harry had a solid pile of clothing and shoes sitting on Malfoy’s bed he made his way to the ensuite bathroom.

“Yes, saving
Harry chuckled and Malfoy narrowed his eyes, but Harry took two steps down the stairs to help Malfoy anyway. He spun around and held his hands out, Malfoy placed his in Harry’s open palms. His hands were cold, and Harry felt a sudden urge to squeeze them, but he resisted.
would he have clothes at number Twelve Grimmauld Place?
Malfoy shrugged. “Speaking of modelling, I was wondering if you’d do me a favour.”
“It wasn’t until my sixth year at Hogwarts that I realized what was wrong. I-“ He cleared his throat. “I’d have followed my mother anywhere. Even if that meant into war, whether or not we were on the losing side.”
Thank you again for reading! I’m sorry this chapter took longer than the last few. All the kudos & comments have been so nice thank you so much!
“Laying it on a bit thick, don’t you think?”
“What do you, er, do for work?” Harry asked uncomfortably. He pushed his eggs around on his plate with his fork, arranging them into a half-pile against the small piece of toast left.
“Er...hello.” Harry interrupted, and Malfoy looked over his shoulder.
Harry didn’t say.
you?” Malfoy roared. He kicked a pair of jeans with his cast-foot. “Ow! Fuck!”
Harry shrugged, leaving any trace of an answer inside his own head.
since then. What did the rest of my family do?” Ron’s ears were turning red and Harry found himself shifting uncomfortably in his seat.
“What? Have you got an issue with green?”
As much as Harry tried, the feeling of Malfoy’s stupid lips against his lingered in his head. He was
The reply Harry got was much quieter than he had anticipated.
“Thank you, Draco.” Harry whispered. Malfoy’s eyes faltered, his gaze dropping down to Harry’s lips, and jumping back up as quickly as they had gone.
Malfoy was staring at Harry intently, and Harry was staring dramatically into his cup of black coffee. As an awkward silence began to stretch between Harry and Malfoy once again, Kreacher appeared with plates full of eggs and toast.
Harry felt himself flush. “No particular reason, really.” He leaned over the side of his chair to retrieve a few loose papers that had fallen onto the ground during his nap. He still had a mountain of paperwork, and Harry found himself longing to go out on the field and actually

Harry chuckled. “
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “Really? I’d have killed you if it had meant saving my family. If I'd had had the chance.”
“Why?”

“I just gave you a shoutout, you’ll gain a couple thousand followers now.”
“I sure am.” He joked, his face breaking into a smile. “What is this sweater? Oh I found it here.” Malfoy was still wearing the awful Weasley sweater. “Maroon isn’t my colour.” Malfoy said and Harry grinned. The chat was going so fast that Harry only caught a few single words. His name popped up a number of times, as did a few words that made Harry fight off the urge to blush.

Harry hung his head. “Why not? Why are you so bloody stubborn?”
Harry frowned. “Of course you would, but it’s not as though I

“Hello Master.” A gravelly voice greeted him.
“Bloody, you look weird in Ron’s jumper.” He said simply.
he had kissed Malfoy. He blamed it on past feelings being brought up, feelings of obsession and jealousy. Though Harry spent the majority of his sleepless night acting as though he’d gone mad, he couldn’t push away the intrusive thought that
Malfoy furrowed his eyebrows, his face held real concern, and Harry felt put-off. “I’d rather not talk about my childhood.” He said quietly. “I’m sorry yours was so terrible. I would’ve thought it was okay.”

been shouted out in Malfoy’s live video the day before. He opened instagram to a plethora of comments and likes, even though he’d only ever posted one photo.
Harry couldn’t explain what came over him, but in a second he had pulled Malfoy across the gap between them, and Malfoy didn’t fight it.
” He marvelled at the picture. The picture didn’t marvel back.
“It still bothers you, doesn’t it? That you were nearly placed in Slytherin? Come
? They must be mad.”
Once Harry had finished his food, he washed his dishes and made his way through the quiet hallway. He trudged up the stairs slowly and decided that he would rather go to bed than face another moment of this day. As Harry was making his way up the stairs he hardly paid any mind to his surroundings, resulting in walking directly into the one person he had been avoiding, Malfoy.
” The name felt foreign on his tongue. “He’s just a bit of a twat.” Harry added, Malfoy laughed.
He pulled the lid off one and was met with a box full of familiar items. Harry picked a few up and placed them on the carpet around him, the first being an old time turner that looked as though it would no longer work even if Harry tried. The next item Harry pulled out was a badge that, now permanently, read
Malfoy shrugged. “You need eyeliner.”
Their lips rolled together for longer than Harry could possibly keep track, or maybe it had only been seconds, but Harry found he couldn’t breathe properly. As the thought crossed his mind he felt teeth biting down on his bottom lip and he shoved Malfoy away. Malfoy, having only one good foot, was sent backward into the carpet.
Harry stared into his salad, pushing a crouton around weakly with his fork. “It sometimes feels like they do.”
me!” Harry groaned, touching his lip gingerly. There was blood on his fingers.
“Why are you avoiding me?” Malfoy asked into the silence.
Ron shrugged, “We’ve been discussing June.” As he began to eat his food Harry caught a smile on his lips.
“You didn’t sleep well?” Malfoy pressed, raising his eyebrows a fraction.
“‘Course I did Potter. They made me believe we would be saving the wizard world with
“OK, I’ll see you in a bit, then.” said Harry. He clutched his wand in his hand, and with a spin he felt the familiar feeling of being pressed into a tube, and his vision went black. A moment later he was standing in the living room of a large flat.
? That’s mad.”
“Is it really?” Harry mumbled, he rubbed at his eyes. His surroundings were blurry once again, the charm must have worn off.
“It’s hard.” Harry said finally.
Harry could feel Malfoy’s breath on him, he could feel every micro-movement from him. Malfoy patted Harry’s cheeks with a soft brush. It tickled, and Harry felt a small urge to sneeze. He was so focused on staying still that he almost felt disappointed when Malfoy shifted his weight and left Harry’s lap.
“Harry’s not quite figured the internet out yet. His user is
“You provoked me!” Harry yelped. He ran his tongue over his bottom lip, still tasting blood.
kissed Malfoy. “What the fuck?”
Harry felt his face flush. “I’m sorry, what? I don’t
“Hullo Kreacher.” Harry replied immediately, spinning around to scan the room at large. “Where’s Malfoy?” He asked quietly.
“No, Harry.”
“I would have gotten you out the moment I met you.”
“Anyways,” Malfoy said, turning back to the screen in his hand. “We haven’t been friends for ten years, No.” Malfoy said sheepishly, he was responding to another question. “Harry hated me in school. Still does a bit, I think.” Malfoy explained, smirking.
Malfoy huffed. “I was nearly killed that day at the Manor, when you and Weasley and Granger were caught by snatchers. Because I didn’t identify you.” Malfoy stared at Harry as though he was scared to look away.
Ron nodded and shoved a large forkful into his mouth. “Mum says she’ll kill us if we don’t.”
“Where are we?” Harry read. He chuckled, and Malfoy answered.
Harry snapped his eyes shut, and Malfoy drew on Harry’s eyes for what felt like hours. Harry felt as though he couldn’t breath. If he moved one inch he would be touching Malfoy far more than he had ever wished to touch Malfoy.
. Harry forced a chuckle. “I don’t
Malfoy didn’t let up. “Just because you bloody fancy me doesn’t mean-”
Harry read another comment. “What’s my instagram?” He asked aloud, and Malfoy chuckled.
Harry turned to face him. “Do you really think so?”
“You guys are chatting too fast.” Malfoy teased. “Who is Harry Potter…” He read, mumbling as he did so. “Harry’s a friend from school.” Malfoy answered simply, and Harry thought about how weird it was for Malfoy to call him
Harry didn’t bother trying again. He clenched his hands into fists at his sides.
And then Malfoy did the worst thing he could possibly do to Harry. He
to be the chosen one. I didn’t get a say in the matter. You, on the other hand, had a choice to do what you did.” He spat. Malfoy’s eyes narrowed to slits. Harry had called on the storm, and it had arrived. He had no reason to back off.
“The same reason I’m stuck here

“Do you think I
Harry hummed, looking past Malfoy and the sofa behind him and out the window, into the rapidly darkening sky. “It wasn’t by choice. My aunt and uncle were rather awful. I’m sure you had your fair share of scarring childhood, though. Mine wasn’t very special.”
you.”
The beat of silence that followed felt like minutes to Harry.
Draco shook his head."Would you forgive a bloke who spent years making you feel terrible about yourself?"
Draco Malfoy. Full on, mouth-to-mouth
“So have I, Potter.” Malfoy said pointedly. He looked toward Harry, and Harry felt as if he was being forced to look away from Malfoy’s piercing eyes.
. He stomped across the room, picked up a pillow, and threw it directly at the lamp sitting on the bedside table. It fell against the wall with a clatter, and Harry snarled. He sat down on the bed, his breathing still erratic, and realized how embarrassed he felt. Harry had just
Malfoy read off a question about his black eye, “It’s nothing. It was only a stupid accident.” Harry spotted a few words of sympathy.
“Master Draco is in the drawing room. Kreacher has made dinner.”
As lunch went on Ron told Harry all of Hermione’s plans for the wedding, and Harry regained his appetite. Besides the fact that Harry was missing his glasses, all felt normal.
Harry mulled it over. He nearly
Harry narrowed his eyes, “For what?” He asked, and on the inside he really meant it, Harry had no idea why he should be thankful.
“No, I-” and then Harry kissed him. That soft smile covered his open and shocked mouth and then they were kissing. Draco quickly wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and pressed as much of his body forward as he could. Ginny was wrong, when Harry kissed him every thought in his head emptied out. He couldn’t describe it if he tried.
“Did you not hear what I just said? I’m incredibly comedic. Ask Cho if you don't believe me.” Potter laughed lightly again, this time rolling his eyes. Then he looked back down at his homework and got back to work without getting up to move. Draco realized that if he just moved a little bit their legs would be touching. Then promptly set about getting that idea out of his head. He had Charms homework to finish.
“Oh there you two are. You do know it’s rude to ditch your friends to go make out, right?” Draco teased when Ginny and Luna finally showed up. He and Harry were lounging under a tree, both had their backs pressed up against the trunk.
“And my back is killing like a bitch, I haven’t moved for over an hour, sleepyhead.” Draco reluctantly sat up and stretched and Harry did the same. Then he stood and pulled Draco up after him. He even got a thank you for all his efforts.
drink. Pansy had brought his head down to her lap and did a bunch of tiny little braids, undid them and then did them again. Neither said they were sorry, thank Merlin. Draco couldn't think of a word he hated more than sorry. They did what they always did, sat with him and didn’t push. He told them he loved them before going to bed.
“I thought I did. And think I might have at some point, but no, I don’t. He’s wonderful and an amazing friend, but he’s not for me. All that stuff you guys talked about in the letters was so much deeper than anything he and I had. I also realized that I did have that kind of connection, just with, um, someone else.”
“Ginny’s right, he does smile more,” Luna said to him. “You should tell him that if you haven’t already.” Draco shushed her and looked over at Potter to make sure he hadn’t heard, but he was too busy talking to Ginny. Draco turned away quickly before any emotion could rise to the surface. He did not have time to wonder about the man he wrote to. He had his reward to reap.
But the Weaselette’s eyes scanned the page trying to figure out what it was.
“It’s, uh, well it’s Luna.” She said it so quietly he almost didn’t hear her. She leaned forward and put her forearms on her knees and looked directly at the floor as she said it.
“Draco, it’s time to head back inside. Everyone else’s already gone. C’mon, wake up.”
“I think I should start,” Potter said, “I’ll say what happened and then you tell me if there is anything that needs clarifying. For unimportant reasons, Ginny came to you with a plan to get me to like her, where you wrote love letters to me for her. In exchange, she invited you to hang out with her friends to help restore your reputation.”
“Well I haven’t told them yet, but yeah.”
“What do you know?” He sneered. She frowned and looked down at the stuff she picked up for him.
thank you all for your comments and support and i hope you enjoyed!
“No, you wouldn’t have. Not unless we asked point blank and even then you'd've given that bullshit half answer you just gave. We don’t care that you’re hanging out with her, we just want to know what’s going on.” Pansy kept her arms crossed the entire time she spoke. It looked like she was trying to hug herself.
He did get to ask his follow up questions to Ginny.
His friends all knew what happened. Blaise, who had hidden all of Draco’s alcohol, poured him
“Later, now we’re studying. Put it in a letter.” The letter writing had remained mostly the same over their months of friendship, but letter delivery had changed. It now became a complex game of delivering without the other person noticing. Sneaking it into each other's bag or amongst their papers. Charming it so only the other could open it and finding complicated ways to get their friends involved. And one time, quite spectacularly, Harry managed to slip it into the pockets of Draco’s robes without him realizing.
“I came to nearly every class hungover. It’s ruined me academically.” Ginny rolled her eyes at him. She sat next to Luna who occupied Draco’s right.
“Needed a walk to clear my head. I have a hard time sleeping.”
“Not really. We do our homework in a group so I have a lot of help.”
“Not many, no. I’ve stopped writing most of my observations down, the memories don’t bother me as much.” This made Harry smile. His only smile that was genuine, but didn't make his eyes crinkle, it was just too soft.
“What does it look like I’m doing? Is there a brain under all that hair? Or does the red burn it from within?” She glowered and some small part of Draco wished he hadn’t said it. But most of him just wanted to be left alone.
Draco couldn’t think about not writing the letters anymore. What the loss of them would mean to him. What it would be to lose the little island of safety they’d created together. To not have someone telling him it was okay to forgive himself. Especially because he hadn't completely forgiven himself yet. He’d just started to, just started to smile again and have friends, new and old. He’d barely passed the beginning and didn’t want to face the rest of the journey without Potter.
Draco must have reread the letter ten times now. He’d known that Potter had a rough childhood, but never heard about it first hand. Draco wanted to kick himself for any joke he'd made about Potter’s home life. He wanted to kick himself for a lot of things. Instead he went back down to the lake to get drunk again. He’d write a response tomorrow.
“You’re welcome by the way.” Ginny said as she bent down to help him.
“Like what?”
“I wonder when I’ll find someone who tells me that they sleep through the night.” Merlin, he must be more tispy than he realized, he had not meant to say that out loud. But Ginny’s face softened, so at least the fear of her punching him was gone.
It was before Easter when it happened. The whole lot of them were down by the lake again. They really didn’t fit in the library comfortably. Neville and Cho were learning from Weasley how to skip rocks; Blaise, Pansy and Granger were in a heated argument about some book Draco hadn’t gotten around to reading yet; others were practicing some spells on the banks. The day was much more pleasant than the majority of the evenings Draco had frequented the lake during the winter. No heating charms needed.
“What’s the point of spending ten minutes fussing over it, just to have it be messy?” Harry went to look at his reflection in a conjured mirror. In the last two months, they’d been hanging out more and more and were currently with all their friends in one of the courtyards.
“Okay so now that we have all the facts down, I’m going to tell you the bits you don’t know. I’ve known for a while that Ginny wasn’t the one writing me letters. There was too much of a disconnect between her and the person writing. I even addressed a couple differently once I was certain. I mean Gin is great and so smart, but she did not notice my yawns or write down these ideas about quiet and reclaiming Hogwarts. When she talks about the war, which she doesn’t much with me, it’s not in terms of thought experiments or indecision. It’s about fighting to protect people or about her brother.
“So you don’t have feelings for him?”
He took a deep breath and let himself look at Potter. He stared at Draco, scanning his face. Draco didn’t know what he was looking for. His body just paused in the moment waiting for Potter to say something. Every second that dragged, another little part of Draco threaten to break. All the pieces he’d been carefully putting back together for the last couple of months threatened to collapse. How terrifying that one person held so much power over him again.
“Sure there are,” Blaise whispered in his book.
“I have to go!” Ginny squealed and reached for her things, “Where do you think she is now? Oh Merlin, I have to find her. This is so exciting. I can’t believe she likes me,
“That would be correct,” Draco said. He still couldn’t tell what Potter was feeling.
“Apologize and say thank you. Or I won’t give these back.” It was an essay for Potions, some Charms homework and a few loose pieces of parchment. Draco’s heart stopped.
“Hey, we’re friends too!”
“I don’t think I paid enough attention in class today, I’m not even sure I get this question.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever heard you make a joke not directed at somebody.”
“Well, good night then, I guess.” Potter said and headed back up toward the castle. They’d stopped walking at some point in the conversation, so Draco stood there by himself. “Oh, but one thing, Draco,” Potter said, turning around, “I also meant what I said in the letters, you don’t have to punish yourself for your mistakes.” And then he was gone and Draco didn't crumble.
“Well then I guess I have no choice in the matter. Don’t want to disappoint your ringleader.”
The dumb idiot hadn’t left him anything to respond to. No wonder Ginny had to resort to practically hiring someone to do this for her, Potter did not have the greatest conversational skills.
“You’re a very good writer by the way. I like the way you describe people.” Ginny smiled, Draco frowned.
“Who is it?”
“You up for sharing?” She pointed to the mostly full bottle still clenched tightly in his hand and sat down as if he’d already said yes.
“You can still be a prick, you know that? But at this point you should be saying
“I suppose neither of us are known for their humour.”
“Okay, so um, Harry knows that it’s you who’s been writing him letters and not me. He’s actually known it’s been not me for a while now, but that’s not the point. The point is he wants to talk to you. Also, I realized I don’t really like him.”
“I apologize and thank you. Please may I have my work?” He said fast in an attempt to get it back.
“Oh shut it, it’s sweet. Here read it so you can reply.” She was literally beaming.
did you notice the change????? hehehehehe
“I’ll make sure to keep you informed.” He didn’t even notice that he had dropped his bottle. It lay on the ground forgotten as the three of them walked back to the warmth of the castle with their arms linked.
“Draco?” Potter asked in the library a couple days later, “Do you understand this bit about the mugroot in this potion?”
“Good,” Harry said when they pulled away, “Because I only have such a list for you too.” This time Draco kissed Harry and never intended on stopping.
ringleader. The group has decided you’re one of us.” And wasn’t that the best surprise he’d ever gotten?
She pulled away slowly to look at him, Blaise took a step back. They both looked at him, waiting for him to continue. He explained to them everything that had occurred. It seemed somehow even more ridiculous when he said it out loud.
“So, I suppose with Luna’s help you’re also managing the work, Malfoy?” Potter asked.
“Six older brothers, nice try.” She said moving her hand away quickly. But then she stopped reading. As if speaking had broken the spell of reading other people’s private notes against their will.
Now he just kept pacing back and forth and back and forth trying to figure out what to do next. Potter had to know that it was him who was writing the letters. There was no way that he didn’t, unless he was profoundly stupid, which he wasn’t if his letters were anything to go by. But Draco had no idea how Potter felt about it.
“You should try it sometime.” Ginny teased right back. “Or would you get too lost in thinking of ways to describe it in a letter to Harry later?” The four of them laughed, but Draco looked to Harry who looked at him. Draco did not disclose that he had imagined the many different possibilities of what kissing Harry would be like. Only a few of them ended with rejection. Harry's fingers were very close to his own, resting on the grass, Draco reached out and Harry reached back. They weren’t quite holding hands, but their fingertips entwined.
He hadn’t seemed mad about it, but then again he’d gone into a state of shock so it was all up in the air as to what came next. He’d asked to speak to Ginny and didn’t seem all that mad at her either so maybe that was a good sign. Draco just didn’t know.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is brilliant, Malfoy, thanks.” Ginny said after reading it, then playfully punched him in the arm. Draco did not know how he ended up in this situation. Seriously, it had only been two nights ago when he’d been very content to get very deeply drunk by himself by the lake for yet another night of forgetting and an ounce of self pity, when Ginny had appeared out of nowhere and nearly tripped over him.
“No can do, my friend.”
“I suppose, but they do say the best way to learn is to explain it to others.” They did not let go of each other. Potter glanced down to see their hands, but didn’t comment.
“No, you don’t. Now quit stalling and get over there.” Draco looked over at Potter, who stared at him, his face doing something that Draco didn’t recognize. “Just go.” She said again and pushed him.
“She and I have a mutually beneficial agreement going. One I would have gotten around to telling you about.” Because he hadn't, it’d been over two weeks and he just left to go to the library every day without saying a word. He’d barely been talking to them at all. He’d barely been talking.
i love happy endings! this chapter ended up being way longer than i thought it was going to be but i'm not complaining. follow on me on tumblr where i post more writing stuff if you liked this @leelas-writing
“I didn’t mean for them to get so personal. Ginny recruited me because she found out I write stuff down about people. All the time, not just you,” Potter’s face did another thing that Draco hadn’t witnessed before, “It’s a coping mechanism my mother taught me. Whenever the memories surface and I’m back there, I start writing down everything I see in as much detail as possible. I tend to write what I notice about people, mostly in the moment. The way a girl would wrap her hair around her fingers or how someone would use their quill to flick a piece of dust off their robes.” He almost started listing more to calm down, but realized that Potter probably got the point.
“My friends happen to find me very amusing. Also, I can’t recall the last time you made a joke either.”
“Haven’t we all?”
i hope you have as much fun reading this as i did writing it
The hard part was signing Ginny’s name at the bottom. The hard part was deceiving Potter, having him think all his secrets were going to this girl he trusted, but in reality they were also going to Draco. He tried to ask Ginny what she liked about him so he could make them more personal to her, but she just kept going on about his heroics and there seemed to be some kind of magic in the letters in that they were not about Potter the Saviour. The one reference that had been made was promptly ignored and never brought back up again.
