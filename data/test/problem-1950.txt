Harry smiled softly as Draco fell over him, cock still in his arse. They rested like that for a while before Draco pulled Harry fully on to the bed and cast cleaning charms over them both. Harry fell asleep with Draco’s fingers running softly through his hair.
The ‘I love you’ sits at the tip of his tongue and he bites down to keep it there, choosing instead to look up at Draco as he takes off his pants and crawls into bed. He’s gorgeous, of course he is, he’s
He’s enjoying his time with Malfoy; learning the habits and personality of the man he’s grown up to become. Now that they’re almost friends Harry doesn’t feel strange inviting Malfoy along to fly if he feels like flying, or asking Malfoy to guard the door to the bathroom, or accepting help on his Potions homework.
It was painful, actually, but the bigger problem seems to be that Harry is physically incapable of walking away from the dining hall. The room where Malfoy is sitting. The man whose voice Harry has heard talking softly in his ear.
Draco’s jerks were becoming erratic and Harry was pleased to know he wasn’t the only one feeling close and desperate.
“Thank you,” Harry breathes. He feels something cold in his heart melt at the promise, and he sighs at the sensation. He hadn’t realised how much it worried him until it was spoken and dealt with. Somehow his fear being out in the light makes it smaller.
By the time Harry and Malfoy are the only ones left in the classroom Harry is finding it hard to control his breathing enough to appear calm, but he can’t quite tell if it’s anxiety over the gold band on his wrist or anger that Malfoy has asked him to stay behind.
Harry gets through the hangover after spending all night drinking with Draco. He gets through helping Ginny pack her belongings. He even gets through helping her unpack them in her new home. And when he goes home after dinner he gets through the first night alone in
“I don’t want to be like you,” Harry says, beyond caring if it’s rude. “Life fucking sucks, and I don’t want to go through it alone. I
A ball of nervousness flitters alive in Harry’s stomach and he smiles with it because somehow it just strengthens his arousal. He steps closer to the middle of the stage and lifts his shirt over his head at the same time. He holds it in his hand for a couple of breaths, wondering what to do with it before he decides to toss it into the darkness beyond the stage.
Harry lets himself watch Malfoy for a few delicious seconds before he gets to work on his own, much simpler, robe. Despite Malfoy’s head start, their robes hit the floor at the same time and then Malfoy’s mouth is on Harry’s neck again, licking and biting gently.
It’s easy, coming up with one of their ‘ingenious’ plans when they have a lead and a way in. They’ll get a phone registered to Harry’s Glamour-name, and his real address. The address of course, makes them bicker back and forth for half an hour.
“What’s wrong?” Ginny asks. Pansy sighs and moves closer to the edge of the bed so they’ll all fit properly.
“It’s just — release. A way for me to let go of thinking and just feel. The more sensations the better.” Harry hesitates for a while, but Draco doesn’t speak so he continues to fill the silence. “I like giving up control; letting someone else decide for a while. The pain helps too, and sometimes it feels good. Sometimes the whole thing feels absolutely brilliant, but no matter how good it feels in the moment I feel like crap after. I call them emotional hangovers.”
Draco lifted his head to place small kisses all over Harry’s neck. “I love you Harry. I love you so much.”
Draco reaches out across the table to grab Harry’s hand. “I know. It gets easier as you go though, and you’re doing great.”
The second he sees her and Ron sitting at a table Harry takes off, leaving Malfoy to find his own seating. Harry, being a rational and sane human being is going to ask Hermione for help, and he can’t very well do that with Malfoy trailing behind him.
“Perfect,” Harry says, grinning and sitting down. He laughs when the ancient springs creak loudly at his weight. “We’re going to break this sofa, aren’t we?”
would always be disappointed by Harry. He wanted someone who didn’t want him for his fame, but the people who weren’t interested in fame were utterly disinterested. So, he’d asked Millie to fill his house with people and parties to stave off the loneliness and the heavy realisation that he would never again try to make someone love him. And it had worked, it was working. But of course, Ron and Hermione would never understand that.
“Yeah, sure, whatever,” he says, rubbing at the fabric that covers his wrist. “Can I go back to my brewing now?”
“I was thinking he could go to our cabin,” he said. “He could send in Floo orders for groceries and stuff and just sit and breathe for a while.”
“No, it’s, fuck,” Harry gasped, eyes fluttering closed as Draco used his other hand to run blunt fingernails over Harry’s scalp. “It’s a wonderful combination, but please. Please, I want to touch you. Or taste you. Anything. Everything. Please.”
“It does, doesn’t it?” Pansy laughs kindly. “I wonder why this is so difficult for you. Contrary to popular belief you’re not actually stupid, and you’ve managed perfectly well to make friends with me in the same space of time that you’ve been dating Daniel, so your social skills seem adequate.”
Ron looked suddenly embarrassed. “I kind of thought she had been the one pushing you,” he admitted. “That she was behind all the parties and the insane number of public appearances. But she said she’s been trying to get you to slow down for ages.”
“Just, I don’t want you to take this the wrong way – but if you ever decide you do want sex, or you want to try something out, you could always ask me,” Draco says, blushing and rushing his words. “And that’s not me asking you for sex, or pressuring you to have it. I never want to do that. I’m just – open to it, if you ever decide that’s the right thing for you.”
Harry opens his mouth to protest, but Malfoy’s laugh cuts him off. “I know you were trying to figure out what I was up to, there’s no use denying it. You’re really not as good at stalking someone as you like to think.”
Harry’s good mood fades rapidly at the question. He’s so tired of the whole concept, tired of feeling left out in conversations about ‘hot chicks’ when he’s out with Ron and Dean, and ‘hot blokes’ when he’s with Ginny and Hermione. Tired of trying to find something about a person that’s probably ‘hot’ to point out to others. He doesn’t fucking know if Daniel’s ‘hot’.
“I’d like to take you out sometime, if you want, get to know each other better,” Daniel says. He’s sat on the sofa looking comfortable with being half-naked, but something about Harry’s expression must give away his discomfort because he covers himself with a blanket while he waits for Harry to reply.
“I feel like I should be taking care of you,” Harry admits. “You made me feel absolutely brilliant.”
“Don’t you dare leave,” Hermione said. “I know you’ve been so busy living up to the image of the hero who never needs help or rest or friends that you might have forgotten that it’s not true. You do need help, and rest, and friends. Everyone does.”
Harry grinned at the woman who had apparently been in his house the night before, though he had no idea who she was.
something about the hard-on they cause. As it is, his sleeping spot in the hallway doesn’t feel private enough – especially knowing Malfoy could decide to walk off at any moment and pull Harry along with him.
“You said,” Ginny says, turning to look at Harry, “before we broke up you said that you loved me – but that you felt like you couldn’t love me
Harry looked up at Hermione, who had been strangely quiet about his revelation. She was biting her lip and looked strangely guilty.
They’re several glasses of firewhiskey in, when Harry finally brings up what’s on both of their minds.
“What about safe-words,” Draco asks, and the twitching hand finally reaches out and lands on Harry’s knee. It soothes Harry enough to answer.
Abruptly she turns her gaze to Harry and fixes him with a stern expression that he half suspects she’s practiced in the mirror in preparation to being a teacher. “Promise me,
He’s not sure if he’ll take Draco up on the offer, but it’s nice to have it. Nice to know that if he decides he’d enjoy occational sex he doesn’t have to go out and seek it from a stranger, or from someone who’ll expect things Harry can’t give. He doesn’t feel any weight of expectation in the offer, just another door opening. A possibility, if he ever decides he wants it.
Admitting to himself that he wants to sleep with Malfoy seems to have opened some sort of floodgate in his brain, and now every time he closes his eyes Malfoy is there – pushing Harry up against a wall and breathing hot on his neck, bending Harry over the desk in his classroom, getting to his knees with a look of hunger. The dreams are a constant onslaught that haunts Harry in his waking hours too, whenever his mind drifts off or he looks at Malfoy for too long. Just yesterday Harry walked into a wall because he was too busy staring at Malfoy’s arse to see where he was going. The untethered anger Harry had been so worried about is gone completely, replaced by a desperate sexual frustration that is very much tethered.
“No,” Harry says, “I enjoy sex – at least parts of it. I like how my body feels, and when it’s with someone I care about I like the closeness and the trust. When I’m with a stranger I
“Trust is vital to every part of our relationship Harry, you can’t go off without me like that again.
Harry gets off the bed and opens the door. “I think I need to just relax tonight,” Harry says. “Settle in, you know?”
“That doesn’t make sense,” Harry said. His heart hammered in his chest, and his body felt trapped somewhere in-between rage and hope and hurt.
Harry listens to the door close behind Matt. He listens to his footsteps as he descends the stairs, and the faint noise of his front door closing. He should get up and lock it. He should get up and clean himself off. He should get up.
“I think in this case Potions is the lesser of two evils,” Harry says. “Though it is absolutely still an evil.”
“Can’t relate?” Harry interrupts, “what, since I don’t have a family to lose?” He’s angry, white hot fury burns in his veins, but it pales next to the hurt. The knowledge that this will always have to be kept a secret, if he wants to keep having it.
Harry sticks his head in the Pensive instead, figuring if he can’t fix the situation he can at least escape it for a little while. Except somehow escaping makes everything worse. He stares at the scene in front of him with horror, because he is fucked. Utterly and irrevocably ruined. The man Martin is approaching to buy drugs from is Matt, the bloke Harry had hooked up with two weeks ago.
Harry takes a deep breath and fixes his eyes to a water stain on his table. “I told you my Glamour knows the drug-dealer. That’s true. His name is Matt, and I’ve been hooking up with him on-and-off for the last few months. I was going to go out last night anyways, because I needed —  I hadn’t seen him since we got the case and I needed to. And then we saw Matt in the Pensive, and I figured I could just — do what I always do, and just ask him a couple of questions along the way.”
“Must have fallen out of the file,” Draco says. He steps closer to Harry to see the note, and Harry’s made a terrible mistake because Draco’s standing right above him smelling of his stupid apple-shampoo and his stupid lavender hand-moisturiser and it’s been too long since Harry got his head sorted and he can’t think.
“Oh, good, you’re both here,” Pansy says when she and Ginny return with fresh snow clinging to their coats.
“You are taking care of me,” he says. “Making sure you’re alright, cleaning you off like I just did, it’s what I need after a scene. Letting me care for you
“Uhm, hi,” Harry says - staring wide eyed at the man. He needs to signal to Draco somehow that it’s really Crabbe, just in case Draco’s trapped outside the room. Then he needs to stall long enough for Draco and their team to get anti-Apparition charms in place.
He puts his pants on underneath his duvet and gets out of bed. It’s a mistake. That much is obvious by how Draco gasps and stares down at Harry’s lower half. Harry follows his gaze and sees his bruised knees and the distinct fingerprint bruising all over his thighs.
“No, sorry. I – that’s not what I want to say. I mean, I didn’t mean to hurt you. But I did mean to listen to your thoughts. And I didn’t mean that either at first, the bond was an accident. But then I did mean to, and I shouldn’t have. I should have told you so you could shield your thoughts. But I didn’t want you to feel like you had to pity-fuck me.”
Harry grabs a pillow off the bed and screams into it before putting it underneath his head and staring at the ceiling.
Harry opened his eyes to look at Draco when the man didn’t respond, and what he found in his eyes made pleasure spike in him. Draco looked at Harry’s mouth with heat burning in his eyes. Harry’s gaze fell to his cock and it was just as hard and dripping as Harry’s own.
“I feel lighter,” Harry said, his back still turned to Ron as he placed firewood slower than really necessary. “I’m not quite ready to return to the world yet though.”
“Yeah I think I’m going to just – not have sex. At least for a while. I need to work out how I really feel about it, and if I really do want and enjoy the things I can’t do on my own or if I’m just…,” Harry hesitates, unsure how to word it. “To stick with the food metaphor; I need to figure out if I’m just eating something I don’t really like because I’m hungry. I’m not ruling it out forever or with everyone, but I’m not in a big rush to figure it out.”
Harry looks up to make sure Draco and Ayla are still far enough away that they won’t hear him. “I never fit in, not really. I had a house with the Dursleys, but never a home. And after that, at Hogwarts and with Ginny, I got close but I heard somewhere that home is a person, not a place and I spent so much energy looking for that person. And I’ve been so confused because I couldn’t find them.”
“Fuck it, he didn’t die, he was murdered. After spending a year trapped in his own body, forced to do whatever his father wanted. Taking down Crabbe Senior is the reason I fought so hard to join the Aurors in the first place.”
Harry feels his face warm at the idea that he’s apparently been narrating his wet dreams out loud for his entire life without anyone bothering to tell him. Merlin that means Neville, Dean and Seamus probably know about the dreams, that had been so fucking hot and so fucking shameful, too. The horrible realisation that Ron must have heard Harry moaning
“I think I must have hit my head too hard,” Harry admits, though his head is one of the few things he
Harry sits down and grabs the tea-tray on the side of the table. He picks out one of those teas that’s supposed to be calming that Hermione had bought him. If there was ever a time for it, and all that.
Oh great, so his emotions are visible from space, apparently. Harry blushes and starts walking, hoping Malfoy will follow so he’s not pulled back by his wrist again.
The club looks like it always does, though the corners look somehow darker without the strong buzz of alcohol to soothe everything over. Harry makes his way to the bar and worries for a second that Matt won’t be there tonight. He doesn’t have to worry long before he spots him on the other side of the bar. Harry orders himself a couple of shots and waits for Matt to come to him. That’s the way it goes: Matt decides and Harry listens.
The only good thing about returning to Hogwarts at the ripe age of 24 is that they won’t be mixed in with the other students. The course starts in May and lasts out August, and since it’s arranged by the Ministry instead of Hogwarts, they’ve hired their own teachers. Hopefully, the new teachers and the newly restored part of the castle they’ll be using will make it feel different enough that Harry won’t see ghosts everywhere he looks.
Harry laughs with relief, itching to reach out and kiss Draco. “So nobody at work will know about — well, Henry?”
Harry keeps his face carefully blank. He’s heard about BDSM, of course he has. It’s right there on the sign beneath the word queer of the club he goes to. It’s just that he never bothered to learn about it. He likes it when someone else takes control, likes it when there is too much sensation to think because it’s the only way he can let go.
“It matters,” Draco says, pronouncing each word with care, “when I find my partner bruised and looking like someone’s killed his puppy. It matters when I find out you’ve been practicing BDSM without knowing about sub drops, because that leads me to worry about what else you don’t know.”
“I know some people would maybe categorise this as our first time,” Draco says. “But it doesn’t feel like that – I just, sex is sex, right? We’re doing something new, but it’s not our first time?”
Harry stared at his expression in the mirror and frowned at the sight of himself. His hair was a mess, his eyes looked bloodshot and the bags under them were an impressive dark purple. And, as if in celebration of his birthday, a couple of faint wrinkles had showed up between his brows. He looked almost as bad as he had during the war, and he had no excuse for it. His life was fine. He grabbed the potions to make his hair and face look presentable and when he looked back up into the mirror
“I don’t want to be Harry Potter anymore,” he said. “I mean, the public figure. I don’t want to do it anymore.”
They sat down at the table, and Harry couldn’t keep the thoughts of where Draco really lived out of his head.
Feeling a cold fist of panic close around his guts Harry hurries to cast cleaning and freshening charms over himself. He’s craving a shower, but at least this way he’ll stay clean. He wants to summon a change of clothes from his room like he’s done in the previous days, but he doesn’t think he’ll have time to change into them. Shit, and he’s still hard despite the panicked rush and the uncomfortable tingle of the strongest cleaning charm he knows.
. Time passes though, and when his Tempus tells him the ceremony is over and Draco still hasn’t returned Harry realises Sirius was wrong. It wasn’t hope itself that killed, it was the agonizing pain and humiliation you felt when it turned out there had been nothing to hope for. It was the fact that you’d do anything to avoid letting yourself hope again.
The cabin was, as promised, a mess. Ron and Hermione had bought furniture and sent over several boxes of things, but they hadn’t assembled or unpacked any of it. Harry spent a good ten minutes searching for a light switch before he realised the cabin didn’t have any electricity at all. After casting a strong Lumos to light the cabin, Harry stopped to take stock. It had potential for beauty, he thought. The walls were made of a rough wood that made it look like the cabin had grown straight from the forest floor instead of being built. The ground floor was just one big room that functioned as a kitchen and living room, and there was a huge fireplace in the middle of it. A wooden ladder took him to an open loft that had room for a mattress to sleep on. Through the windows he saw a small river that made a soothing bubbling sound as it ran by the cabin.
“Harry!” Draco shouts, and Harry turns to Matt just in time to see the fist heading for his face. Pain explodes in his jaw as he falls to the floor, only to jerk back because of the firm grip Matt still has on Harry’s wrist. Harry’s wand falls from his grip, and he has to blink hard to try and clear his head. Draco throws a stunner towards Matt, but it deflects off the shield Crabbe had raised.
“This is useless!” Draco hisses, throwing the Crabbe-file at the wall in a burst of frustration. “We’ll never find him at this rate. This stupid file will end up being our first ever desk-filler.”
Harry melts into the kiss, letting it grow from slow and gentle to so desperate and intense he needs to pull back and gasp for air. He wants more, everything, and they’re not exposed in a hallway anymore so he decides he can have it.
. It had been better with Ginny than with the random girl a while after they broke up, still not like they both thought it should be, hence the breakup, but definitely better because he knew her.
“Make love to me like you mean it,” Harry says. “Fuck me like you love me, and then just -,” he closes his eyes to keep the tears in, breathes to steady his voice. “Then hold me until you have to leave.”
“Idiot,” Harry said again, laughing. The hurt he’d been feeling for the past week had vanished, and it left so much room for relief and joy that he felt like he might burst with it. “Yes, that’s a yes. Now come on, we’re overdue for a date.”
Harry sits up in bed and glares at the afternoon sun outside his window. Draco had loved him, and Harry had been an invasive lying shit, but maybe – maybe Draco deserves to know. Maybe the least Harry can do is let Draco see what he thinks, what he feels. It won’t fix what he’s done, but maybe it’ll make Draco feel less exposed.
Malfoy points his wand at himself, and suddenly the kiss-swollen man is replaced by the Malfoy Harry has come to know, put together and professional. And impossibly hot.
Harry grins and then has a sudden shot of fear. “I’m not – er, I know you’re moving in now. Well soon, I mean. But I’m still, you know, me. Aromantic asexual and all that. I don’t want things to change with us.”
Part of Harry wanted to hate him. To feel horrified that the person he’d been speaking to all along was Draco Malfoy, but he couldn’t muster the feeling. Draco was M and he was Malfoy, and Harry couldn’t help his feelings despite it. Because of it.
Dumbledore smiles. “I suspect you, like I, will benefit from seeing your memories from a new perspective.”
The next day he got out of bed without issue, actually looking forward to his day. He spent half an hour in the shower, and when he got out found the delivered groceries by his fireplace. Harry unpacked them into the various cupboards in the kitchen, casting freezing and cooling charms on some of them.
“It sounds kinda nice,” Draco says, breaking Harry’s internal monologue. “When you explain it like that it sounds nice. Sometimes I really wish I could feel that.”
Harry can’t help it, images of Draco bending him over the kitchen table and holding him down while he fucks him rush his brain, and his cock starts to harden in his pants.
They both collapsed onto the floor after they came, trousers and shorts around their knees and still dressed from the waist up. After catching his breath, Harry laughed.
“Ah, but comfortable where?,” Draco says, “you come out as queer, and suddenly we can’t get a straight answer?”
“No, I’m not, I just, er, needed some air?” Harry winces when the excuse comes out sounding like a question.
“I’m so sorry,” Harry says. The apology doesn’t feel right. They never do. The word sorry can never convey the regret he feels, the hope of a second chance, the hollow feeling of loss.
“Yes, Weasly did mention that,” Draco says. “I laid out some toys and whatnot in the room, you can pick out the ones you’re comfortable with me using.”
Harry takes the card and studies the details for a Pensive-memory just in case Matt doesn’t let him keep it.
“Fuck off,” Harry said, but he let the pillow he’d placed over his cock fall off as he twisted to take in the sight of Draco slowly shedding his clothes, taking the time to fold them before placing them on an empty chair.
When he wakes he’s in a room he doesn’t recognise. Ron and Hermione are talking to Draco, who looks so closed off Harry almost doesn’t recognise him. They haven’t noticed he’s awake and Harry gets off the floor as quietly as he can. He doesn’t have his wand, and he has no idea what’s made Ron and Hermione lose their minds, but he’s going to find out. He takes a few quiet steps forward and almost walks into the shimmering barrier. He recognises it immediately from work. It’s a magic box, designed to keep him, and him alone, in. Without his wand he won’t be able to get out.
Harry laughs, refusing to admit just how true that feels these days. At least Malfoy isn’t thinking about Harry’s arse anymore.
As if to prove the truth of his words Draco pushes his hips down, his hardening cock grinding against Harry’s thigh. He leans down and places his mouth on Harry’s neck, licking gently.
He’s fine though, he does want a relationship. He wants to love Daniel the way Ginny loves Pansy and he’ll get there. He’ll keep living this dream until it
Sometimes, like this time, Harry doesn’t wait for his brain to break down beyond the point of rational thoughts. They got an important case today, and Harry’s not going to fight his brain while trying to solve it. So he goes to the club. It’s always the same one, ever since that first night. The first gay club he’d ever found in Muggle London, the same Glamour he’s always worn. The regulars there knew him by sight now and that makes it easier to keep the wrong kind of bloke away and attract the ones he wants. The ones he wants are the angry ones. The ones with that look of danger about them. Who shove their way through the crowd to get to the bar, instead of weaving around people. Harry wants the ones who aren’t afraid to
“Would you mind if I told Charlie?” he asks, looking at Harry. “It’s alright if you’re not comfortable yet – just, I think he’s aromantic too, maybe, but I don’t think he knows it’s a
Harry comes hard, the weeks of erotic dreams with no release combined with Malfoy’s skilled hands and mouth makes his orgasm intense. Pleasure rushes over him like a waterfall, and he feels it everywhere. Distracted, he releases Malfoy’s cock and moans as Malfoy wanks him through his orgasm.
A door opens five feet from Harry’s head and he freezes, mouth half open in a gasp and hand on his throbbing prick. Fuck. Out walks some Auror Harry can’t remember the name of, and Harry realises in a panicked rush of thoughts that it must be morning. He hasn’t woken in the middle of the night after all. Fuck. Harry stays completely still until the interrupting man has left the hallway and casts a panicked Tempus. It’s almost 6.30 am. Malfoy has, without fault, left his room at exactly 6.30 am every single day for the past week, and Harry suspects it won’t be any different just because it’s a Sunday.
The fingers in his hair tightened and Harry moaned, moving his head forward as Draco pulled back to make the tugging rougher. Draco was close enough that the motion brought Harry’s face in contact with his bulging trousers and they both gasped. Harry opened his mouth and experimentally breathed hot air over the bulge before following it with his tongue and wetting the trousers with it. The realisation that Harry was completely naked and Draco was still clothed struck Harry, and he felt his cock swell. He should have realised sooner of course, but Harry was so caught up in Draco, and in the bonds on his wrists and ankles, and the ache in his knees, that he found his brain working slower. Draco seemed to realise at the same time as Harry because he looked down at the trousers Harry was mouthing at and growled in frustration before he spelled them off too.
Yeah, OK so he’s hearing Malfoy’s thoughts. At least some of them. The ones wondering if Harry’s flirting. Which he isn’t, except he somehow made ‘special treatment’ sound a whole lot like ‘sexual favours’. And Merlin’s tits maybe he is flirting?
Draco laughed, throwing his head back and letting his whole body shake with it. “I can’t wait,” he gasped between laughs, “to see their faces when I resign tomorrow.”
Harry ignores the bitter tears that roll down his face as he considers the idea that there will never be enough time. That no matter how much he wishes he wanted what Ginny and Pansy have, he just doesn’t.
“Well, a total one at least,” Harry grins, feeling lighter for the first time in weeks. Maybe months, if he’s honest. The fact that he’s not alone in liking what he likes, that there might be a way to have it without the crushing emotional hangover after, the fact that Draco knows and isn’t running the other way — it all makes Harry overflow with relief.
Draco drops his wand to the floor and stares at Matt with disgust. Matt relaxes a little and points to Crabbe.
“I like that,” he said, remembering his promise to tell Draco what he liked as they went along. “When you tell me I’m good. And when you give me orders.”
“Yeah?” he asks, smiling and bending over just a little bit. Just enough to make the ropes rub against his skin one last time, and to give the audience a final look at the come and lube escaping out of his arse.
Harry picked up the book he’d gone to the bedroom to retrieve from his bedside table and brought it into the living room. The dinner he’d made stood under a Stasis charm on the table. They’d just sat down to eat when Draco’s boss had called him in on some emergency, and Harry had decided to wait to eat until he came back.
“It was used before weddings,” Malfoy explains. “I think you cast it on someone and then they speak their fiancé’s name and they’re bonded together. I think it was a physical and mental thing, supposed to help people bond before an arranged marriage. The original spell would wear out in one moon cycle or end upon consummation, but I’m not sure what the added ‘Always’ does to the spell.”
“I never do a scene without communicating in person first,” Malfoy explains. “We need to go over what we feel comfortable doing.”
“It does, doesn't it? Draco grins. “Especially considering neither of us particularly enjoy living alone and we greatly enjoy each other's company.”
“Draco,” Harry gasped. His hands moved from Draco’s shoulders to his waist to his hair, unable to settle on a single spot. “Fuck.”
“A bit, yeah, enough to understand the spell. That when a time is specified it won’t break until that time or with sex.”
“Have me,” Draco answered. If he hadn’t been so lost in his arousal Harry might have laughed, but as it was the words only fuelled his hunger.
“I also like being in charge of my sub’s orgasms. Like telling them when they can and can’t come. How do you feel about that?”
“Yes the word itself means not romantic,” Draco says, “but aromantic means something different to lots of people. Some experience platonic love, some don’t. Some really hate the idea of a romantic relationship while others like the idea, but don’t feel romantic attraction.”
Only after getting dressed did Harry realise he should probably shower, but he was already running late so he cast a freshening charm instead and used one of the dozen deodorants Millie had put in his bathroom. She was the only one who could get past the wards and into his bedroom and bathroom after someone leaked a photo of Harry sleeping and Witch Weakly wrote an article on how to sleep like a hero. She used her access to make sure Harry always had fashionable clothes and accessories, beauty potions, perfumes, and deodorant.
Fuck, what’s wrong with him that he can’t look at Daniel without his erection flagging? It had been the same with Ginny, and the girl he’d had sex with after that. His desire is selfish, turned in towards himself and what the person he’s with can make him feel – it has nothing to do with Daniel. In fact, Daniel seems to have a detrimental effect on his desire.
Harry pauses, but Draco doesn’t say anything. Not out loud, and not in Harry’s ear. He must be using Occlumency as hard as he can now, trying to keep Harry out.
The chocolate warms him inside and out, and Harry isn’t entirely sure if it’s the chocolate itself or the feeling of being cared for by Draco. The warmth fades when they get to Azkaban though, because Draco is right. The dementors may be gone, but they left something behind. That, or the dark tint to the magic of everyone there has done something to the castle. By the time they get back to the office they’re both drained and exhausted, and Harry feels like they’ve wasted a whole day.
"Right," the woman said and clapped loudly. Harry jumped and blushed with the realisation that he'd heard nothing she just said. "If you could all just pair or group up. Keep your bracelets visible, remember red is dominant, blue is submissive, purple is switch and grey means I'd rather just watch."
“Unless nightmares count as stupid,” Harry says before he can catch himself. “Honestly, I just need some sleep.”
The problem arises after dinner, when Malfoy decides to retire to his room. Harry follows him to their common room and then to the hallway with their rooms without issue, but in a cruel twist of faith Malfoy’s room is at the very end of the hallway while Harry’s own is near the entrance. With Malfoy safely inside his room, Harry’s wrist stops him five feet from the door of the room he was assigned.
“Only about a thousand times better,” Harry admitted, laughing a little. “But also, just. Remind me you love me?”
When Draco walked in Harry was pushing his hips desperately into his closed fist, frustrated at the loose grip he’d forced on himself. He jumped when Draco walked in, eyes locking with the other man, and found himself utterly incapable of stopping his hips from moving.
“Knows what?” Harry demands. His wrist is turning colder, and he turns half panicked to check if Malfoy is moving further away but he’s stopped in front of an empty table and is unpacking his things.
“Let go of the wand,” he tells Draco, just as the protective barrier crumbles under Draco’s onslaught.
. Sure, Harry doesn’t have much time to himself anymore because Daniel wants to have sleepovers all the time. And maybe Harry doesn’t sleep much because he can’t settle with Daniel holding him. But it’s nice, growing with someone. And Harry still has his Fridays where he can sit on his sofa and drink soda and tell Daniel he’s busy working.
Harry stares up at Malfoy for a second before letting his gaze fall to the outstretched hand, then entirely without his permission his eyes land on Malfoy’s crotch and just no. He’s not going there. He has no time to examine the button kneeling in front of Malfoy has pushed, not when he’s accidentally gone and bonded himself to the git. Or not git anymore, apparently.
There's an awkward silence behind the door and Harry knows he's being immature and stupid, but he can't help it.
. Because years of pent-up aggression and denied lust is all culminating in this moment; with hands and mouths and bodies that can’t ever get enough.
“They’re still working on the anti-Apparition wards,” Draco says. “I didn’t have time to call them in when I heard you say almonds. I just, er, acted.” He looks embarrassed, and Harry knows it’s about the breach of protocol. He should have called them before storming in.
“Draco, please.” Harry’s hands tighten around Draco’s arms and he hears his voice shake with longing.
“Alright fuck this,” he said, figuring he should have brought a dog or cat or something to talk to so he could at least pretend he wasn’t talking to himself.
“Well it sounds ridiculous when you say it like that,” Harry laughs. “But yeah, I found myself and it’s what I’ve been looking for this whole time. And what I found is that I want to share my life with someone – just not in the traditional sense. I want to surround myself with love, friendships and nieces and nephews and family. And you.”
“We’ll be in Rome, I hardly think entertaining ourselves is going to be a problem,” Harry says. “Are you sure you want us crashing your honeymoon though?”
“There you are,” Matt says, his arms wrapping around Harry from behind. “Wondered if you’d show up after the text Crucio sent you.”
Harry moves his hands down to Malfoy’s hips and pulls, making Malfoy lie fully on top of him before he lifts his hips to grind his crotch against Malfoy’s. He groans at the contact, throwing his head back and breaking the kiss. Malfoy isn’t deterred though, moving to kiss and lick at Harry’s neck again.
Harry walks down random streets for at least two hours before he finally feels settled enough to apparate home. Guilt and relief still cloud his head, but it’s light enough that he can think despite the feelings.
When Harry’s brain works again he looks up at Malfoy. He’s sat up on his knees at some point, and he’s slowly wanking himself as he looks at Harry.
The words seem to be what Malfoy needs to hear. Not a declaration of love, because they’re not there yet, but an acknowledgement of the tension between them. That Harry feels it too. That whatever
“Pour the champagne!” Draco insists from somewhere behind him, and Harry takes the bottle from Ginny and busies himself with the glasses while he listens to Pansy explain how they’d made a date of shopping for rings for each other.
Luckily, he doesn’t really have to figure it out because he’s effectively distracted by his bladder. Harry has to
Draco pushes in slowly, and Harry’s arse burns as it works to stretch around Draco’s cock. It feels almost too good, too intense and Harry only remembers to keep breathing when Draco places a firm hand on his hip and squeezes. Draco bottoms out and they both moan, bodies shuddering at the same time as they finally join completely. Harry locks his feet behind Draco’s back to pull him impossibly closer, and then Draco moves. Pulling out and thrusting back in so forcefully the air is shoved from Harry’s lungs as pleasure shoots through him like electricity.
Harry grins at the amazement both on Malfoy’s face and in the voice in his ear. He wants it too, to be claimed. To know that Malfoy wants him, not just for today – but for later. He imagines Malfoy fucking him after Harry’s come already, sending shocks of residual pleasure through the pleasant afterglow. Imagines Malfoy coming inside him and revelling in the feeling of come and lube leaking from him after. He’ll have that too, soon. But for now, this will be enough. For now, he wants the voice in his ear more.
Draco rolls his eyes and takes a handful of popcorn. “Fine, you can be Merry, but only if I can be Legolas. Actually no, as long as I can have Legolas, he’s hot as fuck.”
“Your place is the restaurant where you had your first date, and where Gin booked you a table for your one-month anniversary,” Pansy says.
“I do want sex,” he says when he can breathe again, “I just can’t seem to find anyone I want to have sex
“Turn over, Potter,” Draco demanded when he was naked. He walked closer to the bed and waited patiently for Harry to do as he said.
Draco smiled at him with a glint in his eyes that made Harry want to keep looking at him, instead of focusing on his work.
Hermione winces in sympathy. “When Ginny and I came back after the war to take our NEWTs it got better. We have a lot of bad memories there, but we have more good ones. You just have to let them through.”
The movie does have a lot of dogs in it, and it makes Harry wonder why he hasn’t got one. He likes walks, he likes dogs, he has the time. And more importantly he’s always wanted one. And he’s not in limbo waiting for his life to begin anymore. His life is exactly the way he wants it, apart from the spare bedroom that’s empty more often than he’d like.
. A lot could be said about Snape, but Harry’s confident he genuinely cared for Lily. In the true style of the book there isn’t any additional information. The next page has detailed alterations to the potion, but nothing else.
“Where do we go from here?” Harry asks, and he’s not sure if he means the case or them. Maybe he means both.
Harry looked up at his friend and saw the earnest expression on his face. He really meant it then, that it would be alright for Harry to just… stop.
Draco glances towards the door to Harry’s room, but doesn’t give any other inclination that he might be interested.
At least half of Ron and Hermione’s boxes were books, and Harry spent unnecessarily long unpacking them. He decided he should put them in the shelves alphabetically, then alphabetically by author because who sorted their books by title? But then it looked messy so he sorted by colour and size, except Hermione would hate that, so he sorted them back to alphabetically by author again. The garden, in contrast, was a free space in every way. Harry didn’t follow any rules when he worked on it, except keeping what he liked and getting rid of what he didn’t.
“Really?” Harry says. “Who’s your boss?” The hand on his thigh inches upwards and he hates the idea that he might have to show this memory to Draco.
Draco takes a look at the towel in Harry’s hand and casts a quick wordless charm that vanishes all of the spilled frosting.
The Dining Hall is almost empty when they make it down there, since Malfoy insists on getting up unnecessarily early. Still, Harry appreciates the quiet.
“So, uh,” Harry says when Ron finishes the last bite of his dessert and gives him an expectant look. “I’m aromantic.”
“Emotionally too? Fuck I can’t believe how low humans can sink, shitstains on society the both of them! Human-trafficking? I could
Draco turns to Hermione. “The spell on him is called Intus Diserecor, though I suspect he’s used the modified version Snape made, Intusemper Diserecor. It’s an old pureblood bonding spell. His mind isn’t affected.”
. And Draco really was going to make him beg for it. Harry squirmed as his impending orgasm faded into an almost painful throb of desire.
if he could be the boss of them and poison them with drugs." Draco looks disgusted, though Harry isn’t sure if it’s with Crabbe or the stupidity of Aurors.
Draco’s preference quickly became the brewing room they set up for him. He spent hours upon hours in the room, testing potions and new recipes to make potions more effective or to reduce their side-effects. By late March, Harry was pretty sure Draco wouldn’t make it to his self-imposed deadline of staying at his job until summer. His boss refused to accept Draco’s proposed changes to make medicinal potions more effective and was clearly furious that Draco continued to develop and improve potions for people she deemed to have ‘self-imposed’ issues.
Draco comes out of the Pensive looking furious. “I’m going to fuck you over your desk now,” he says, “and I don’t want a word about it!”
“Yes! Sorry, I understand.” Harry spoke hurriedly, desperate to please. Though it might not be the worst thing to displease either, he thought, if it meant Draco might spank him again.
. Thick spurts of hot come land on Harry’s stomach, and makes him feel strangely cared for. Malfoy might not be saying his praise out loud, but this is him showing Harry how much he wants him.
, and that it hurts like fuck to see how disappointed they are to find out who I really am? It’s just easier to be who they want me to be because at least that way
“Oh,” Harry says, wondering if that’s a philosophy he should accept in more parts of his life too. “Alright then.”
“No, shut up!” Harry felt his fingernails dig into his first perfect tomato as he gripped it even harder to keep tears from escaping his eyes. “I fell for you. And that – it didn’t change just because I learned your name. You’re still you, the man I’ve talked to daily for months. And I can’t blame you for the fact that your feelings changed when you saw me. I can’t make you want to be with me. But I can make you stop seeking me out to – what, yell at me for not saying I knew who you were right away?”
The doorbell rings just as Ginny opens her mouth, probably to share some real advice and Harry groans. “Who the fuck is here on a Friday morning? Why aren’t they at work?
“Merlin yes,” Draco said, lips moving against Harry’s skin as he spoke. He was clearly affected too, his hips twitching against Harry even as Harry worked to unbutton his trousers.
“You’d be too, if Ron just said to you what he told me,” Harry says. He presses the back of his hands to his cheeks to try and make some of the redness there subside.
“I do,” Harry says. He hears his own heartbeat in his ears, beating louder and faster than Draco’s. If he can’t have everything he can at least have this. “I definitely want to.”
“Thank you for telling me,” Draco says. He’s standing by the pots and pans, casting spells on them and leaving them shining and clean.
“Naturally,” Draco drawls, for a horrifying second sounding like Snape. “Slytherins look after our own.”
“No,” Draco insists, “something happened. I said you need to take better care of yourself and you winced. If this is going to work between us, both as partners and as partners-with-benefits then you need to talk to me. I can’t always be guessing what’s going on inside your head.”
“You do?” Harry asks. He’s grinning so hard his freshly healed jaw aches, and he doesn’t care. Draco loves him.
“Merlin, that’s good,” Draco said. He picked up a piece of tomato with his fingers and placed it delicately in his mouth, closing his eyes and sighing at the taste before licking his fingers clean.
“Breathe, Harry,” Draco says. “A cup of tea sounds good. I’ll join you. The kitchen is the best room for talking, don’t you think?”
History repeats itself, but in such cunning disguise that we never detect the resemblance until the damage is done.
Harry looks at Hermione for confirmation and she blushes and nods. Harry’s said things in his sleep that makes Hermione blush. Fuck.
Harry sits down on the floor outside Malfoy’s room and rests the pillow between the wall and his head, checking to make sure he’s properly covered by the cloak. He pulls up the sleeve of his robe and stares at the offending golden band around his wrist. Stupid, piece of crap spell. Harry half considers sending a Patronus to Ron and Hermione and telling them everything, but he doesn’t want to deal with the anger and disappointment. He considers telling Malfoy for a fleeting second too, but the thought that Malfoy might sleep with him out of pity kills the idea before it can fully form. Instead, Harry casts a glamour over the gold band and rests against the wall. At least with Malfoy’s room at the end of the hallway nobody will accidentally fall over him as they’re heading to their own rooms, and Harry figures he might as well try to get some sleep.
Harry is suddenly struck by the realisation that he’s on his bed, talking to Draco, sharing thoughts back and forth without any anger. Draco has given him a second chance. Draco is trying to give Harry what he needs, the words and the insight and the trust. He feels dizzy with the relief of it. He wants to reach out again and kiss Draco. Wants to feel smooth skin against his own.
. I thought everyone knew that after the whole Weasley clan walked in on me snogging Charlie. Not exactly how I wanted it to go, but I did think it was effective.” Harry turns to Hermione. “It was effective, wasn’t it? Pretty clear indication that I’m not straight? No further explanation needed?”
Harry couldn’t help it; he pushed back on Draco’s finger and bent his leg, so his arse was raised slightly up from the bed. Draco hummed appreciatively and set an agonizingly slow pace, fucking Harry’s arse with his finger and just missing his prostate on every thrust.
thing. But Harry figures whether or not he’s attracted to Malfoy is really besides the point, he has to figure out why he’s
Harry draws a sharp breath at the words, this time so strong he would have sworn Malfoy said them out loud if he hadn’t been watching him. They sounded just as needy as Harry feels, and the force of his desire makes him take a step back so he’s leaning against the wall.
When the sensations he’s feeling start to change, Harry opens his eyes and almost jumps at how close Daniel is. He wants to laugh at himself, because he hadn’t forgotten Daniel was there – had he? Harry’s eyes drop to Daniel’s mouth and somehow the sight of the man he’s been enjoying very much grinding up against leaning in for a kiss chases the good feelings away in an instant. Still, he accepts the kiss and tries to make his lips and tongue move in a way that’s right. People always seem to really enjoy kissing, Ginny definitely had looked like she liked it earlier but Harry can never quite get over the slightly nauseating feeling of something wet and rough against his own tongue. And he doesn’t know how to do it, how to make it feel good for whoever he’s kissing because he can’t just get lost in it like Ginny says she does. Daniel seems to be enjoying it though, if the hardness pressing up against Harry is any indication.
“Is it alright if I put my arm around you?” Draco asks, holding the hand that had been placed on Harry’s knee up without moving it towards Harry.
Draco grabs Harry’s legs with slick hands and places them around his hips, and Harry knows he’s about to be fucked. That
“But not that you’d survive to see it?” Draco asks, and he sounds even more upset than he’d done when the credits started rolling.
“Well, no wonder you struggle when your book looks like this,” Malfoy says. He looks at the book for a moment longer and it’s obvious when he notices, his eyes widen and his lips part as he lifts the book closer to his face. “This is Snape’s handwriting. Why – how do you have this?”
Harry fights to hold back the wince the words trigger and smiles instead. He's fine when Ginny, Hermione, or any of the Wesleys tell him they love him. He's fine saying it back, but saying it back now would be a lie. He doesn't know Daniel well enough to love him, not like he loves his friends, and even if he did - he doesn't love him the way Daniel does. He doesn't love Daniel the way he wants to be loved, and Harry can't deny the truth that he doesn't think he will
“Circe, don’t look like I just kicked your crup! It was just a question,” Malfoy says. “Sure, I’ll join you for breakfast.”
Ice runs down Harry’s spine. He has a sneaking suspicion that Crabbe isn’t just in the Muggle world to traffic drugs, but people too.
sees it is because he spent a good year of his life following Malfoy around like a stalker. He knows how Malfoy will straighten his back and force his hands open to hide his nerves.
“So, if I kissed you right now, you wouldn’t mind?” Harry asked. He tore his gaze from Draco’s lips to look at his eyes, and they were smouldering with suppressed heat. Draco wanted this just as much as Harry did.
“You know,” Draco says, running a light finger over Harry’s cock. “I don’t normally wear jeans, but they come with these handy hoops for a belt — and I do love having a belt handy.”
“Nobody did anything I didn’t want them to,” Harry says. He doesn’t meet Draco’s eyes. “It’s fine, I’m fine. Well, I’m obviously fucked in the head, but this is what I wanted.”
Harry grimaces. “I really hope I never have to do that again. But thank you, and I’ll come with you too – though I hope you never need a wisdom tooth removed.”
Harry almost falls apart with it, the pain in that one word. Instead, he turns to Ron and Hermione. He’s so angry he can’t contain his magic and it flares around him, making his hair and clothes fly wildly. The box contains it though, trapping Harry inside a storm of his own making.
“Bend your knees,” Draco says, and Harry hurries to comply. He’s happy they’re doing it this way, that he’ll be able to watch Draco as he fucks him. The thought sends shivers through him and he spreads his legs wider.
Harry grins with his secret knowledge and releases Malfoy’s hand. He reaches out with lubed fingers to touch Malfoy’s cock, and groans in satisfaction at the weight of it in his hand. The groan turns to a moan when Malfoy’s wet hand closes tight around his cock and starts to move.
“I’d like to tell Ron and Hermione,” Harry says one night, curled around Draco in the bed they share more often than not.
Draco seems to struggle with the answer, mouth opening and closing several times before he sighs and pulls out his wand. Harry looks at Draco, ready to ask what’s going on when he notices something pressing against his consciousness. Harry was never good at Occlumency, but the gentle nudge against his brain is so soft and questioning even he could turn it away. He doesn’t though, just raises a questioning eyebrow at Draco and lets the magic through.
“I’ve developed this fantasy,” Harry admitted. “I was thinking about how we used to be, you know, when we didn’t like each other. And wondered what would have happened if we’d run into each without knowing each other from the site. I was thinking, what if this intense
“Morning,” Draco says. He has one of those glints in his eyes Harry’s only ever seen while on a particularly interesting case, only now it’s directed at Harry. It makes him feel like he’s the only thing in the world; like everything outside of the two of them doesn’t exist.
Ron walked in then and Harry smiled with relief when he saw the steaming cup of hot cocoa in his hands. Ron handed him the cup and Harry wrapped his hands around it, trying to let the warmth seep into his bones. He took a sip and felt the rich chocolate chase some of his
“My arse,” he spoke before he’d consciously decided to do so. “Please fuck me properly Draco, fuck, I’ve wanted you in me for so long.”
Hermione shot him a glare that could kill, and Harry shrank back into the chair he’d just been standing up from.
“They are?” Harry and Ron ask at the same time, predictably causing Hermione to roll her eyes. “Of course they are. Haven’t you ever thought someone was really really hot and you just really wanted to
“I was afraid I’d scare you off,” Draco admitted. “We’ve always had this intensity between us, right? At school it was bad, but it was intense. And now, Merlin, it’s so good. And it’s so intense. And I’m scared I’ll make you run away screaming if I show you how deep my feelings go. If I let you see how much I want you.”
“No, really? Why not? You’re friends with Bull-uh, Millie. Ginny has been going out with that Zabini bloke. You’ve held countless speeches about second chances and moving on and creating a unified society. Why can’t you be with him if he’ll make you happy?”
“Back so soon?” the bouncer asks. He’d caught on at some point, about what Harry’s there for. Harry thinks maybe he worries, though he’s not sure if it’s about the state of drunkenness Harry always reaches, or if it was about the blokes he leaves with. Maybe it’s the combination of the two. Still, it doesn’t matter. Harry isn’t here to be worried about, rather the opposite actually.
“That sounds like a good plan,” Harry says, assured. Maybe it doesn’t have to matter all that much that he doesn’t know everything, as long as he’s comfortable with the way he’s living.”
“Thanks,” Harry says, feeling a little overwhelmed that he’s one of Draco’s own now. Though, when he considers all the things they’ve done for each other over the years he might have been for a while without ever noticing.
“Reality doesn’t live up to the dream in your head,” Harry says, surprising himself. He hadn’t planned to speak. “But that’s just relationships though, right? They’re never as good as you make them out to be in your head.”
“Well, we know they were further apart than 20 yards. And during the war the Dar– Voldemort had him brew a Potion. A terrible, awful Potion that I don’t like to think about, but it required virgin blood as one of the ingredients. Snape used his own.”
Draco spreads the lube over his hand and reaches down between Harry’s legs. He doesn’t tease this time, and Harry arches his back and curses when Draco’s finger enters him in one determined thrust. He moves it in and out a couple of times before taking it out entirely and pushing it in with more lube. Harry keeps his legs spread as wide as he can, and tugs on the restraints around his arms. His arousal throbs in rhythm with Draco’s thrusts and he’s desperate for Draco to finally fuck him.
“Alright,” Draco agrees. “I have more kinks, and more things I won’t do — but nothing I can’t live without and no limits regarding the things you’ve mentioned. At some point I want us to go over one of the kink forms from my club, really get a sense of what we want to try together and whatnot, but what we have discussed is enough for now.”
Most of the packing was actually about cleaning, tidying, and taking down spellwork he wasn’t sure Ron and Hermione would want to keep. It wasn’t his cabin after all, and most of the things in it weren’t his either. Outside in his garden he saw the green glow of a spell that floated softly over his tomatoes, indicating that they were ripe.
“It’s alright, Harry,” Draco breathed, running a hand up Harry’s back to play with the hair in the nape of his neck. “You can come.”
When Hermione came in her hair was wrapped in a towel, and she had pyjamas on. She smiled when she saw him, but Harry saw the surprise there. He hadn’t seen them since they asked him to stop being
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. He’s not entirely sure what for, but Draco sounds pained and it’s his fault.
Harry’s mind swam with the possibilities. He’d been wishing and hoping that Draco would pull him in by the hair and make him swallow his cock, but the idea that he could have the other man fully, that they could be one… That he could be
“Alas indeed,” Pansy agrees, “Now come on, we need strength in numbers. Ginny and I are trying to teach Harry about anniversaries.”
“Need a hand?” Malfoy asks, stepping up behind Harry and holding out his hand to pull Harry to his feet.
“Not gay, I think. Felt the same as with you and that brunette girl. So I guess I like both? All? Honestly, I feel mostly confused.”
Harry doesn’t have time to reply, doesn’t know what he would say if he could. Draco’s words leave him feeling warm and desired in a way that’s too raw to be spoken. Maybe Draco knows, because he pushes in hard after he’s said them. Harry throws his head back and gasps at the delicious stretch, and Draco buries his groan in Harry’s neck.
“I know Alex hurt you,” Hermione said, “but it’s been two years. Don’t you think it’s time to give dating another try?”
They sit on the sofa in comfortable silence until Harry’s raw nerves are covered in a protective film and he feels more like himself than he’s done in as long as he can remember. Draco’s steady presence helps more than Harry could have imagined, and he remains seated next to him even after he starts to feel better. He doesn’t want to stand up and face the conversation he knows they need to have about him breaking their deal to never work without backup. Eventually though, he knows it’ll have to happen and maybe it’ll be better to get it over with.
He finds Malfoy at the table he usually chooses and drinks deeply from the mug that’s placed in front of him. It’s perfect, and the warmth and caffeine both make him feel instantly more alert and less like he’s spent weeks sleeping on the floor.
He curls his mouth around the last word, and Harry isn’t sure if he’s referring to the thing in the bathroom or the time when Malfoy brought Death Eaters into the school or just all of it. He supposes it doesn’t matter much.
Harry isn’t too sure he’s in a closet, but as the distance to the club closes he feels the strange comfort he always does when coming home to his flat. Like he’s somewhere he belongs. At least, as much as he knows how to belong.
It doesn’t take long for Hermione to get Draco. Harry shouldn’t be surprised. He’d known Draco was close, but he’s surprised anyway because Draco once again looks perfectly put together. Harry would never know how much he was hurting if he didn’t hear it.
The movie has only played for a few minutes when Harry realises Draco intends on keeping a running commentary throughout. He finds he doesn’t mind like he does when Ginny insists on chatting through a movie at the cinema. Mostly because there aren’t other people around to be annoyed, and also because Draco only talks about the movie and the thoughts he has about it.
“I feel like that a lot too,” Draco says, finally walking into the room and sitting down on the edge of Harry’s bed. “Like I love people, and that it can feel a bit different based on who it is and what kind of relationship I want with them. I feel like I’m not aromantic because I don’t love, but because I don’t want a romantic relationship with anyone. And all love is different; for example, I love my mother, but I love her best from afar. I’d never want the kind of relationship with my mother that Ginny has with hers where they see each other every week. And I love Pansy, so much, but I’d never want the kind of relationship with her that she has with Ginny. Personally I enjoy platonic and familial relationships, but not romantic ones.”
Harry laughs, because the idea that he’ll ever stop being curious about Malfoy is ridiculous. “When it comes to you, I don’t think my curiosity will ever be satisfied.”
“Draco,” Harry rasped. His skin was burning with arousal, and he had no idea how long they’d been there. How long Draco had been running his skilled hands through Harry’s hair. Harry tugged at his restraints again and winced at the pain as the ribbons chafed at his raw skin.
He landed in the middle of London and frowned. He didn’t want to be in London. He wanted to be – he wasn’t sure, elsewhere. He Apparated again and again, letting magic and intuition guide him as he appeared and disappeared over and over throughout England. Finally, he tried to Apparate and found he was too exhausted. His magic wouldn’t rise up to let him leave the random city he found himself in. Frustrated Harry held out his hand for a passing taxi and asked to be taken to a hotel. He’d sleep and figure it out in the morning.
“I’m aromantic,” he says, smiling at the confused expressions on Harry and Ginny’s faces. “I don’t fall in love like that. I can’t. I love people a lot, but not romantically.”
Harry isn’t sure Malfoy is listening, he’s leafing through the pages and muttering soundlessly to himself. He pauses on the page about antidotes, the one advising a Bezoar and the small scribble
Harry survives another week of being tethered to Malfoy. A new week of sleeping on the floor and waking up to his body screaming in protest at sleeping on a hard surface. Of cleaning himself with charms, and finding creative ways to use the bathroom. He survives a week of rushing to the seats by the wall in his classes, so he’ll be close enough to Malfoy. He even survives being invisible in the crowded streets of Hogsmeade when Malfoy goes to buy quills. He’s pretty sure he can survive doing this for another few weeks while he figures out a way to break the stupid bond. He’s not sure he’ll survive the dreams.
.’ He groans and turns over in his empty bed. Draco had loved him, and Harry had betrayed his trust. But Draco had loved him. At least he’d thought he did.
Ron shrugged. “You were going through something difficult. Hell, you’ve been going through something difficult your whole life so I was just worried you would never see that it’s not supposed to be that way. Life isn’t supposed to be that hard.”
“Come home with me?” Daniel says, breaking away from the kiss and licking at Harry’s earlobe. His hands are on Harry’s arse, pulling him close to his own body.
“Remember all those conversations we had?” Ginny asks. “All those talks about looking for something, or feeling like something was missing, or wrong? I kissed a girl and all the pieces fell into place. And when I finally figured it out I thought, well, you have those feelings too.”
Daniel pauses, close enough that Harry can feel the heat radiating off his bare skin. He still just looks like a bloke, like some random person on the street or in a magazine or movie. Harry’s body misses the sensations Daniel had made him feel, but now that they’ve stopped, Harry realises doesn’t want to stand here staring at the stranger that’s going to make him feel it.
Harry opens his mouth to ask what the everloving fuck Draco is talking about, but Draco steps closer and pulls him into a kiss before he has the chance. Harry startles, but doesn’t waste any time in putting his hands around Draco and pulling him closer.
He carefully worked Draco’s pants down to rest above his knees with his trousers and stared in wonder at Draco’s cock. The hair around it was blond, but darker than the hair on Draco’s head. It bent a little towards Draco’s belly, the foreskin pulled tight by his arousal. It was bigger than Harry’s, but not significantly and Harry wanted it. Wanted Draco. He wanted it in his mouth, in his hand, in his arse.
Ginny looks strangely nervous as she pulls Harry down the street, and Harry keeps walking with growing anxiety. What kind of hell-hole are they going to this time, if Ginny’s so nervous about showing it to him? They turn a corner, and suddenly the club is impossible to miss. Flags in every colour of the rainbow cover the entrance and from what Harry can see through the window the walls inside are covered too.
“Let him finish,” Draco says. Harry looks at him, and his heart breaks with the pain he sees there. Draco believes Ron and Hermione. Believes Harry isn’t himself, that he’s with Draco because of some spell or potion.
He figured he had earned the sobbing, and if nothing else, it was a healthier way to deal with heartbreak than what he’d done after Alex dumped him. Draco, at least, hadn’t gone to the Prophet. There had been no exclusive interview with transcripts of their conversations. Draco hadn’t really done anything wrong at all, except being utterly uninterested in Harry. The only thing Harry could fault him for was not having the guts to end it in person. Still, he’d find a way to move on and fill the throbbing hole in his days and in his heart with something other than crying.
“M. He’s Draco Malfoy.” Harry let the words fall out of him, and they came easier than he’d thought they would, like he had been holding them back from escaping.
“No,” Harry says. He shoves his hands in his pockets and is glad for the robe that covers his still half-hard cock.
Harry leaves. He chooses to walk out instead of apparating because he needs the air. He walks down a street with lights so bright they block out the stars and that feels like a metaphor for his life somehow. Daniel was right, Harry is a prick. And maybe he’s broken too because he just broke up with his boyfriend, but behind the guilt and self-hatred all he feels is a sense of relief. Like he can finally see the stars behind the streetlights. He takes the bracelet off and lets it slip through his fingers and onto the ground. He inhales and the cold January air fills his lungs to the brink, he exhales it in a half-laugh half-sob because his lungs haven’t worked this well in months.
“I forgot you had this eternal summer thing going on,” Draco said. “Winter clothes were a bit warm.”
Hermione grins, “Honestly Harry, I’m very excited about this, it’s such an interesting subject and when you feel more settled with this I’d really like to pick your brain on how it feels.”
“I should probably help then, so you don’t forget to water the dog too,” Draco says. “The lease on my flat is up so I could move in and help keep the dog alive.”
“We think so. She was just fostered by a really nice couple, but they brought her back because she would get so upset whenever she was left alone for more than three or four hours at a time, and the couple both worked eight hours a day so they couldn’t keep her.”
Harry loses his train of thought, not that he’s entirely sure he ever had one. “Er, so just – don’t apologise. OK?”
“I walked up to the café, and I saw you, through the window. You were reading that book, and you had obviously tried to tame your hair. You looked so fucking handsome and nervous and excited, and I just knew that if I walked in, I’d break your heart.”
And there it is. They’re getting married. But Ginny isn’t Ron and Hermione, it doesn’t have to mean anything for Harry, does it? He coughs to get the lump of fear out of his throat and jumps off the sofa to catch Ginny in a hug.
The theme for this evening's party was Bondage, and every cell in Harry's body ached with wanting to try it. He couldn't take his eyes off the selection of rough ropes and soft silk ribbons lining the table in front of the woman who was leading the party.
Harry groans and reaches down to his jeans. They’ve waited long enough for this, no matter what way you choose to look at it. Waited too long to realise their attraction, waited too long to have a proper conversation. Waited too long to feel the stretch of the other’s cock opening them up.
He had to touch himself. It wasn’t a choice anymore, but a demand his body made by pulsing with arousal and need. Harry let go of Draco’s hip and used the free hand to pull his shorts and pants down over his cock in one move. Kneeling as he was, he could only get them down right below his arse, but it didn’t matter. All that mattered was the rush of relief as his cock was freed from the restrictive clothes, and the desperate moan Draco made when he noticed what Harry was doing.
Draco grins. “That makes two of us then. I think this partner-with-benefits thing is going to work out brilliantly.”
“What do you think, Harry? It’s a mess because we haven’t been there to unpack any of the boxes we sent over, but it’s very quiet and peaceful.”
“It’s only been what, four days? You were hungover on Monday too, can’t you drink on Fridays and Saturdays like a normal person?”
Harry moves his hand down between them, feeling blindly until it closes around Draco’s cock. He helps position it against his opening and meets Draco’s eyes.
“It’s a brilliant rule, especially considering I’ve got three different kinds of popcorn seasoning.”
When Harry makes it to breakfast in the morning he finds Ron waiting for him at one of the tables. The Dining Hall in the newly separated part of the castle looks different to what Harry’s used to from his schooldays. Instead of four large tables covered in food the Hall is filled with smaller tables that’ll seat anywhere from two to six people. A long table spanns the far wall, and it’s filled with various breakfast foods. Cereal, fruits, toast, different types of eggs, bacon, sausages and vegetables. At the very end of the table there are various drinks; coffee, tea, juices and milk. It reminds Harry of the buffet at the Muggle hotel he stayed at once, and he vaguely remembers reading something about measures to reduce food waste and limit extra work for the Hogwarts house-elves in the letter he received a few weeks back.
“That makes perfect sense,” Draco says. His finger circles the rim of his cup, and the steady movement of it is the perfect draw for Harry’s gaze. “What about being spanked with something?”
“Mmh, I love you too,” Harry smiled, sighing contentedly into the sheets. “Might fall asleep like this.”
The sound of Malfoy’s zipper opening is so faint Harry might have missed it completely, if not for the collective hush that falls over the room at the same time. Harry is going to be fucked. And he’s ready, his rim already stretched and lubed up before he entered the stage. His cock has been aching on and off for days in anticipation.
“So, er, what are we doing in class today?” Harry asks, trying to distract Malfoy from looking at his arse. He’s not sure he’ll be able to resist turning around and doing something stupid again if Malfoy’s thoughts don’t shut up.
“At least we’ll fly right through our Transfiguration classes,” Ron grins. He reaches out to take Hermione’s hand and smiles warmly at her. “After all, I’m doing the teacher.”
“Is this place Muggle or Magic?” he asks, the words coming out more slurred than he thought they would.
Draco studies his face for a while, and Harry meets his gaze, trying to let the sincerity of his words shine through.
"Good." Malfoy quickly grabbed hold of Harry's wrists, pulling them behind his back and holding them for a moment. "Hold them still."
And, Harry supposes, what it meant to the world-at-large. Catching the last escaped Death Eater, in a lot of ways, means closing the book on a war that ended over a decade previous. The fact that it was Crabbe Senior, a father who’d cast Imperio on his own son and sent him on a suicide mission intended to kill not only Harry and his friends but Draco and his too, well… It made the case personal to both of them.
Harry laughed, and it was such a strange feeling to still find joy in a situation where his life felt turned on its head. Draco had said the same thing to Harry only a few weeks ago, and it had been partly what had prompted Harry to seek out Ron and Hermione now.
Draco’s hands pulled on Harry then, until their bodies were flush. Harry could feel Draco’s hardness pressing into his hip, and he couldn’t resist pushing his own into Draco’s thigh. The friction was amazing, but it wasn’t enough, and Harry wanted everything. He wanted to see Draco, to taste him, touch him, feel him. He wanted to spend hours doing this, but his body screamed at him to make it fast.
“You can stay as long as you want, Harry. It’s really no trouble,” Hermione assured him. She looked sincere and Harry loved her for it.
Harry follows Malfoy in a quick stride, and immediately regrets it. Now that he’s standing and moving his bladder is
Harry interrupts her then, “Gin, breathe, please. I don’t mind you seeing Parkin-, er, Pansy. Fuck that whole mess feels like a lifetime ago and she was probably terrified out of her mind when she said that. I just care about one thing, really.”
“You made the balcony into a garden?” Harry asks, tearing his eyes away from the newly made garden to look at Draco in surprise.
Harry bit his lip hard to keep from asking for more, and he felt a rush of victory when Draco started using a second finger without being prompted. Draco used his fingers expertly now, bending and twisting them in just the right way to make Harry a twisting moaning mess on the bed. Harry’s hips rose desperately to meet the fingers on every thrust, and pleasure rushed through him every time they brushed past his prostate. Like this, he wouldn’t have to beg to be fucked. He wasn’t going to last long enough to beg. Draco put a possessive hand at the back of Harry’s neck, letting his fingernails dig into Harry’s skin just enough to hurt but not enough to mark. Harry gasped and pushed back into Draco and he was so close, any second now he was going to –
. We could tell each other everything. And then Hermione became my person too. And the three of us were each other's persons and we knew we could survive hell because we had each other.” The memory makes Harry smile a little, because even now he misses them. He misses when it was them against the world, though he doesn’t miss the world being terrible.
Harry put some egg in his mouth to hide his surprise that his friends had bought a cabin. He hadn’t known. If he was honest with himself, he didn’t know much about their lives at all. He hadn’t spoken to them properly since things ended with Alex.
“Kiss me?” Draco asked, and it was all Harry needed to hear to close the small bit of distance between them. He reached up to place his free hand on the back of Draco’s neck and pulled him down at the same time as he stood up on his tiptoes to bring their mouths together.
“Beautiful,” Draco says, running a finger down Harry’s cock to his balls. Harry buckles his hips for more, but Draco continues the soft touches — down his cock, over his rim, fondling his warm arse.
Harry smiles up at Draco from the floor, and has to look down immediately. It’s been too long since he found some release, that’s all. That’s the only reason sitting on the floor by Draco’s feet feels so — he just needs to get his brain working again that’s all. Having fallen helplessly for his partner is one thing, but harbouring inappropriate sexual fantasies while at work is where he draws the line. He just needs to let off some steam so he can go back to not thinking about it.
“Oh wonderful,” Draco says when he opens the door to see Harry. “I found the sequel to that movie we saw last time, Legally Blonde? This one is about dogs and I wanted to see it. Let’s go to your flat.”
“Fuck, Malfoy, get out,” Harry demanded. He grabbed a pillow to cover himself with but kept staring at the hardness in Draco’s jeans with obvious want.
Malfoy laughs. “I just meant I was surprised. It looked good when I stopped by to ask you to stay behind.”
“I mean, I do know him now. The things he cares about and his values and the way he chooses to live. I know he’s not who he was. So, I guess the problem then is that I know who he is, but I’m not supposed to know. And he doesn’t know that I know.”
Harry decided to take full advantage of his permanent summer and have his breakfast in the garden. After a moment’s consideration he grabbed a pen and paper to bring with him as well. He hadn’t seen anyone for a while now. At first it had been because he was too exhausted to deal with anyone, too unsure of how to act and who to be. Lately though, he’d been afraid that if he let anyone see him it would shatter the fragile shape of a ‘self’ he’d managed to build in his solitude.
“How is that different than having a friend you want to have sex with though?” Draco asks, sounding genuinely curious.
Right, Harry thinks. The unfortunate guy that had roomed with Fred, George and Lee. He doesn’t have much more time to think before Daniel has pulled him into a dance that’s more grinding than dancing, and suddenly he doesn’t want to think anymore. It feels good to be pulled close by strong hands, good to rub his hardness against someone else’s. He closes his eyes and lets the sensations take over because he likes those – he’s always liked those as long as his eyes are closed. It doesn’t seem to change when it’s a bloke instead of a bird.
On Halloween Draco comes with Harry to visit Godric's Hollow and his parents' graves. Harry’s brought flowers, like he always does, but something feels different this year. Visiting this graveyard has always brought up this ache in him, ever since the first time he visited with Hermione during the war. He’s come here alone, with Hermione, with Ron and Hermione, and with Ginny and he’s always felt the ache. Part of it is missing his parents, and that’s still there, but the other part was missing a home. Now he stands over their graves and looks over at where Ayla is picking up a stick and giving it to Draco clearly wanting him to throw it and Draco’s anxious expression as he tries to decide if throwing a stick with your dog is allowed in a cemetery, and Harry doesn’t feel that ache for home. He’s found who he is and what he wants, and he has so many people in his life to love and be loved by.
“You knew, didn’t you? You always know things,” Harry said. It wasn’t an accusation. He’d asked Ron and Hermione to not tell him, if they figured out who M was. He’d made a deal, after all. He suddenly understood why M wanted the deal as much as Harry had.
His lack of attention to Malfoy’s words turn out to be a problem because Malfoy suddenly waives his wand to distribute vials to each table and then walks briskly towards the door. Maybe if he had paid attention Harry would have had time to grab his invisibility cloak, but as it is Malfoy is through the door and pulling Harry along with him before Harry has time to blink the glaze from his eyes.
The North side of the castle has been blocked off from the rest. They enter through a new door on the ground floor. It looks to be set up mainly with classrooms. Walking up the stairs they find a dining hall and a common room. On the final floor they find their rooms. Harry had worried, at first, that they would have to share like they had when they were actual students here. Luckily, someone decided being an adult should get you the luxury of a private room.
“Come for me, Harry,” Draco says, stroking firm hands down Harry’s back and reaching up to tug at his hair. Harry ruts against the bed, looking for more friction against his cock and finding he doesn't need any. He’s so close the feeling of Draco gently tugging at his hair is enough to push him over the edge.
Harry took a bite as well, and yeah, the tomatoes were good. Fresh and with more taste than any tomato he’d bought at the store. Still, they weren’t that good. They weren’t good enough to make Harry want to keep eating them when he could use his mouth for things that looked so much more appetising. Like kissing Draco or licking his neck along the collar of his shirt. Or sucking Draco’s fingers into his mouth, or gasping for air while Draco made him see stars.
For the rest of the lesson Harry is too busy trying every variation of a cancelling spell he can think of to keep track of his potion. By the time the bell rings it’s an unattractive brown sludge instead of the bright purple it was supposed to be. He bottles up a sample and vanishes the rest, making sure to go slow enough that the classroom is almost empty by the time he’s done. He has to get away from Malfoy and figure out some sort of way to get this
Harry rushes out of his room and hopes Ginny and Pansy are still awake because he needs to talk about this right away. He finds them on the sofa snogging, and he doesn’t waste time sitting down heavily in the armchair, being sure to make enough noise that they’ll know he’s there.
He wishes he could go to his friends. That he could ask Ron and Hermione to hold him together, or at least keep him company while he falls apart. They don’t know he’s ruined though, that he’s losing the only thing that truly matters, piece by agonizing piece. They don’t know that every time Draco kisses him, Harry wonders if it’ll be the last. They don’t know Draco fucked Harry in the shower a week ago, and that Harry thinks he’ll never do it again - that there won’t be time. Maybe it would have been better if they’d broken it off as soon as the wedding was decided. Harry would have shattered then, he knows, but maybe that would have been better than this slow tearing. In the end, it doesn't matter. Harry knows he’ll stay as long as Draco will have him, and then after... Harry doesn’t like to think about after.
“While that’s a valid point and all, I don’t see how it’s relevant to the predicament of me being in love with Draco Malfoy.”
At least he wasn’t alone. It had been a good thing, when he realised being alone meant having to deal with himself – something he felt very much incapable of doing. The people around him distracted him from himself, he didn’t have to be
Harry found that time passed quickly at the cabin. Before he’d left, every day of his life had seemed to drag on forever, and they were similar enough that they blended together, making time seem frozen in a loop. He’d been exhausted before starting his days, and since sleep hadn’t restored him it hadn’t felt like a natural divider. At the cabin though he filled his days with things he enjoyed. He grew tired at bedtime and woke up feeling ready for a new day.
going to ask Hermione for help. In fact, he’s going to make the promise and then figure this shit out on his own.
“You did so good Potter, so fucking good.” Malfoy looks pleased and sated, and Harry shines with pride because he did that.
Draco fixes Harry with a searching look and then bends over the Pensieve. His body freezes when his nose touches the liquid memories and Harry knows he’s inside them now. Looking at Harry’s thoughts and feelings. Harry sits down on the bed to wait, feeling exposed. Draco could come out and judge Harry to be lacking. Could decide he’s not worth it. Could decide he can’t forgive him.
“Fuck me,” he says, feeling calm and sure in his request, the blushing hesitation from earlier burned away by the heat of his desire.
While he worked, he let his mind wander. It felt strange. He appreciated his solitude at the cabin, yet he’d felt so alone in the months before coming here, even though he’d been surrounded by people. In one of the many books he’d read there had been a definition of the word solitude; being alone by choice. And maybe choice was the biggest factor, because he had no choice in the loneliness he felt before the cabin. It had been there no matter what because the people around him didn’t really
"You always knew this would happen," Draco sighs, and Harry knows he's right. Draco had never made any promises, and the cautionary tale Sirius told had been ringing in Harry’s ears since he first ran into Draco after the war. After spending the past seven years together though, Harry had let himself hope. A desperate delusion that he and Draco would be together forever. That Draco would love him enough to call off the engagement to Astoria that had been made when they were children, and stay with Harry instead.
Draco laughs. “I don’t think any of us ever have it all figured out. At least I don’t. I think it’s perfectly fine to just
“Maybe you just don’t like casual hookups then,” Ginny says. She’s opened her own soda and Harry decides to take revenge by waiting to speak until she’s mid-drink.
Harry pants and moans against the table, and he might have been embarrassed if it wasn’t for the fact that he’s too turned on to care. He feels too safe to care. Draco places a cool hand against his flaming arse and pets it softly, and Harry moans and leans into the touch.
Harry spent ten minutes cursing and tearing at his hair before he Apparated to Ron and Hermione’s house. This time, at least, he had the decency to Apparate outside their front door and knock.
Harry walked into the living room and collapsed into the sofa next to Ron. Once seated he buried his head in his hands and rested his elbows on his knees. He had to resist the urge to scream with frustration. His emotions were all tangled up in each other. He had his feelings for M and though he’d never met M, or at least this version of M, the feelings were very real. But then he also had his feelings for Malfoy, the bloke who’d broken his nose and called his friends horrible things. The boy who had tried to murder Dumbledore and had poisoned Ron and cursed Katie in the process. Those feelings felt like the polar opposite of what he felt for M. Of course, Harry hadn’t really seen Malfoy since the war.
“I need a shower,” Harry said. His t-shirt and neck were still covered in Draco’s come, and his stomach and thighs were covered in his own. “Much as I like being covered in come, it does start to itch terribly when it dries.”
Harry doesn’t have time though, so he just grabs hold of Malfoy’s wrist and starts pulling him past the library towards the closest bathroom. Malfoy follows without comment, at least without commenting out loud.
Harry was prepared for Draco to pull his head close and making Harry suck him off. Fuck, he wasn’t just prepared, he wanted it. He wanted to taste Draco’s heavy cock on his tongue, wanted to know how it felt to have it pushing against the back of his throat. Harry wanted to make Draco gasp and moan in delight as Harry hummed around his swollen prick. He wanted Draco to keep his hands firm in Harry’s hair and use it to guide his head in the rhythm he liked. Draco seemed content to take his time though, alternating between tugging roughly at Harry’s hair and running soothing fingers over his scalp again and again, leaving Harry gasping for breath and his cock wet with precome.
"So what the hell was this?" Daniel demands. He looks hurt and angry, and Harry can't blame him. "If you're not attracted to me and you don't have a crush or any sort of
They make a regular thing out of the movie-nights. Sometimes Ginny and Pansy join them, and on a few occasions, Ron and Hermione join too. Harry and Draco had both been in fits over how frustrated Ron was that the characters onscreen wouldn’t listen to him when he clearly told them what they needed to do in order to not be murdered by the guy with an axe.
Hermione, however, already looks pissed off. A quick glance at Ron, who looks apologetic, tells Harry that he’s sold them both out about something. He only makes it halfway into his seat before Hermione starts talking.
Harry blushes and bites his lip, and can’t quite keep from crossing his legs. Fuck, he has to ask or he’s going to have a fucking accident right here in the hallway.
Harry smiles at Draco, but can’t find any words to share beyond that so he turns back to the credits. “Please can we order food before we have more deep and important conversations about this movie? I’m starved, and I want to watch the next one to see if Pippin and Merry are alright.
“He told me he loved me, and I couldn’t say it back. I didn’t even want him to say it, or feel it. What the hell is wrong with me that I don’t want that?”
Harry takes the book from Malfoy and scans the words himself. Everything from the golden band around his wrist to the way the first bloody name he said after casting it was Malfoy’s fits. The words that make him feel cold all over are the final sentences. ‘
“So, when you said you were excited to meet me, when you said you liked me, you knew I was, well, me?”
Harry leaves Matt in his living room and does just that. He leaves the jeans with his wand in the bathroom and crawls naked into bed. He’s done working, now it’s time to let go.
“Right?” Matt says, fingers painfully tight around Harry’s wrist now. “He’s already a slut, so if we get him on drugs I’m sure he’d do whatever anyone asked.”
“He ran away,” said Ron. He sat down and started eating his breakfast and it reminded Harry of the hundreds of breakfasts they’d shared over the years. He didn’t have to be strong around these people, he could just be himself. Except, he thought maybe he’d forgotten who that was.
Harry hesitates, feeling strangely vulnerable all of a sudden. “It’s, OK, right? That I don’t have it all figured out?”
Harry twisted his arms a little as Draco worked on tying up his ankles, testing the tightness of the knot. He hummed in pleasure when his movements made the soft velvet feel rough against his skin.
She holds out the bottle, and Harry notices the ring on her finger before Draco does. He’s grateful for that, because his best friend is engaged and he’s going to be happy about it when she tells him. He’s going to grin and cry with joy and toast to her happiness with Pansy – he just needs a moment.
Harry figures he’ll have Ginny buy him multiple drinks, actually. Throwing an arm around her he lets her lead him towards the rainbow-coloured doors.
Harry nods. Draco’s face is impassive, not one muscle moving to give away any emotion. His voice is matter-of-fact, questioning Harry without sounding accusing or curious. Harry wonders what Draco thinks. Does he still believe Harry only wanted to be with him to break the bond? Does he believe that Harry didn’t want it broken? Is he hurt that Harry invaded his privacy by listening to his thoughts?
“You love him though, don’t you?” Ginny asks. She’s asked him this before, but it had always sounded rhetorical. It doesn’t this time.
After the first time Harry starts joining Malfoy at breakfast almost daily. He’s surprised to realise that Malfoy doesn’t really talk much, because the way he remembers it Malfoy would talk relentlessly as long as there was anyone around who could conceivably be convinced to listen. Now though, he usually reads the paper and eats his food. He’ll engage in conversation if Harry starts one, but if Harry doesn’t, they’ll just sit in silence. A strangely companionable silence. Maybe it’s the fact that Harry can hear him, even when he doesn’t speak that does it. Because even when they’re both quiet he’ll randomly hear snippets of thoughts about himself.
“What?” the bloke shouts, leaning in close so Harry will hear and blowing hot air into his ear in the process.
“Ah, yes here,” he says, holding up the book and starting to read. “The subject of the spell will be bound to stay within a 20 yard radius of the target, blah blah blah, they will hear the thoughts their betrothed has about them.”
“I was,” Malfoy admits. “But you don’t think I’m up to something now, do you? Because I promise you, I’m not.”
“Breathe Potter, I’m not – I, fuck,” Draco breaks off in an annoyed huff and laughs bitterly at himself. “Merlin, I’m not very good with words anymore, am I? No wonder you wanted to keep the bond.”
Harry leaned forward to lick at the base of Draco’s cock, buying his nose in his pubes and inhaling the scent that was so purely masculine and Draco that his own cock twitched impatiently in his pants. Draco moaned appreciatively and it spurred Harry on further. He ran his tongue down the length of Draco’s cock, and allowed the tip to slip into his mouth. Running his tongue around the head, Harry groaned at the salty bitter taste of Draco’s precome.
Harry shivered a little at the firm tone of Draco’s voice, but it was the implication that really got him. Draco wanted to do this again. A sharp slap to his arse pulled him from his thoughts and Harry whimpered in pain and pleasure both.
Ron and Hermione both went quiet at his statement. Only when he looked up at their surprised faces did he realise he’d dropped the L word. He hadn’t meant to say it, but the word rang true in his head. He’d fallen in love with Draco Malfoy. And it was strange, to be in love with a man he hadn’t seen in a decade. But it wasn’t strange, because they’d talked almost every day for the past three months. Harry knew him, and he knew Harry in a way Harry hadn’t let anyone know him before.
“I mean, just because we divide work and knowledge between us on the job doesn’t mean we’re stupid enough to think we’d both pass the exam if we each learned half the curriculum,” Harry says.
“What she means is she accidentally went into politics when she didn’t get her way at work, and decided she really liked it, actually,” Ron clarified, smiling fondly at his wife. Harry could see the pride radiating off him, and he was struck by a sudden rush of affection for his friends.
Harry stares expectantly at Ron and Hermione, hoping they’ll agree that yes, a romantic relationship does need some time and nurture to do well. He can’t be sure what they do think though, because Malfoy is already walking out of the Hall and in a few seconds Harry will be pulled forcefully after him if he doesn’t get up to follow.
“Potter,” Draco said. His voice was back to the cool hardness he had used earlier, and it did wonders to immerse Harry into their roles.
Harry ate his soup and went to bed, feeling exhausted by not only the day, but the life he’d spent the last few years living. When he woke up again the heaviness was back, laying over him like a second duvet and weighing him down to the point where he couldn’t make himself get up. And he didn’t have to, did he? There was no-one waiting for him or expecting him to be or do anything. Nobody would care or notice if he didn’t get up. So, he didn’t, besides using the bathroom and getting food and water, he stayed in the loft on the strangely comfortable mattress.
Harry feels his heart speed up as Malfoy gets closer, and he can’t make his mouth work well enough to form words to say anything at all. Not when Malfoy is so close, and when Harry is so desperately horny after that night’s dream. A dream in which, incidentally, Malfoy had him pushed up against a wall as they desperately clawed at the other’s clothes and rutted against each other.
Malfoy looks thoughtful for a moment before holding out his wand and wordlessly summoning a worn book from somewhere in the back of the library. He opens it and spends a few moments leafing through it.
“I mean, you need someone to teach you the right way of doing this. Someone you trust, and honestly at this point someone
He got lost in the book, one Draco had lent him about magical pirates, and he jumped a little at the crack when Draco Apparated in.
“And speak of the devil,” Millie said, walking up from behind him and placing a hand on his shoulder. “They’re waiting for you to do your speech.”
Harry distantly feels relieved that he never stood up from the bed. His whole body feels weak with loss. Like every part of him Draco has touched is too busy aching for him to muster the strength to move. The memories haven’t worked. Harry rubs his eyes tiredly, readying himself to look up again and let Draco go, but when he looks up Draco’s face isn’t blank anymore. The glint in his eyes is back, and something like a smile tugs at the corner of his lips.
“Of course we’ll communicate before beginning a scene. I’d never do it any other way. Would you be able to say no to doing a scene at all though?” Draco asks, concern settling in his brows and drawing them down.
He’s already drunk, but not enough for the bouncer to deny him access so he makes it into the club and makes his way to the bar. He orders and downs two shots before letting his eyes wander the club. Another three shots later he’s following Matt out the door and ignoring the bouncers stare. He doesn’t remember if this is the third or fourth time he’ll be doing this with Matt, but figures it doesn’t matter either way. Matt suits his needs, at least his need to stop thinking. Harry isn’t sure he’d call it sex. Sex would be what he’d do with someone he cared for, someone who cared back — even if only in the moment. This thing with Matt was all about release.
By 6 am Harry is pacing the hallway instead of his room. He’s nervous. What if Draco doesn’t want to watch the memories? What if he ignores Harry completely? Fuck, maybe Harry really has ruined this forever? But he can’t think that. He has to try because as much as he’d like to deny it Draco Malfoy has become something Harry never thought he could be. Something so much more than a repressed desire. More than attraction. More than a crush. They’ve only been together for a couple of weeks, and they haven’t even said it. That they’re together, or were together. They just went from not talking, to hanging out a little, to hanging out a lot and then to sleeping together. If Harry hadn’t been able to hear Draco’s thoughts, he might think it had been just sex. But Harry did hear his thoughts, and it hadn’t been just sex.  Harry hasn’t known the grown-up version of Draco for long, so maybe he shouldn’t be feeling it this intensely. Maybe he should still be able to close his eyes and picture his future without Draco in it. Or maybe this is how it feels, when you finally find someone who makes you feel like the world is bright and filled with opportunity. Maybe this intensity isn’t wrong, but just his instincts screaming at him that this is
Grateful, Harry nods and watches as Daniel steps into the flames. He lifts a hand and runs a finger over the ghost of Daniel’s touch on his ear, his lips, his arse. He wants this. He enjoyed the way his body felt when it was pressed up against Daniel, and fuck – he’s been horny for years now. He wants to feel that release, the pleasure as it builds up to orgasm. Daniel could scratch that itch just as well as the girls he’d tried it with, couldn’t he? It’s strange and new and a little terrifying, but he does want it. Several deep breaths later, Harry steps through the Floo.
“No, I’m bisexual actually. Figured it out a couple of weeks ago. And in learning I wasn’t straight I realised you’re not either.”
“You’ve been very good for me,” Draco says, “standing still like this for so long, letting me mark up your pretty arse. I think I want to take you to bed and fuck you properly into the mattress.”
Harry resisted the urge to puff his chest with pride that he'd be Malfoy's for the evening, but let a grin spread over his face.
“She’ll hex you if she hears you calling her that,” Harry said, feeling a rush of warmth for Millie. He should reach out to her.
“Borimir just - and then Frodo tried to leave and Sam just walked into the water even though he can’t swim, and Sam is my favourite now. He’s so pure, I
Martin proves to be clear-headed and cooperative, he assures them he’s a recreational user, and that he’d been perfectly sober when he’d seen Crabbe. Harry lets Draco do the talking, forcing himself to focus on the conversation happening in front of him, instead of yearning for the club. It happens like this sometimes, a slow decline and then suddenly he stops functioning at all. His thoughts tangle and stumble as he watches Draco carefully extract Martin’s memory from the night. He lets Draco drag him out of the flat and side-along him back to the Ministry. He uses the elevator ride from the Atrium to their office trying, and mostly failing, to iron his thoughts back out to something that’s at least a little bit functional.
Stretching and rolling his head to lessen the ache in his neck Harry went inside for a quick refreshing shower and went to work making dinner. He ate at the table, staring out of the window at the slowly setting sun in an effort to keep the glowing feeling of accomplishment the day had given him, instead of letting his thoughts go down the angsty spiral of ‘what the fuck have I done?’ that he’d tried to avoid ever since coming to the cabin. It almost worked.
Harry searched his brain for a new topic of conversation, because he wasn’t sure he could talk anymore about his future without having some time to think on it first.
Ron frowns and looks down on his empty plate with disappointment. “I suppose I should come too. Can’t believe I got homework on my first day.”
Draco huffs. “I used to talk a lot and yet I never said anything that mattered. After the war I realised I had been talking so much I never stopped to listen.  I talked over people who had something to
Harry tells Draco everything. He starts out with the intention of just explaining what he got out of Matt while he was on Veritaserum in the living room. All about Crabbe going by the name Crucio, which makes them both flinch, and about getting a phone number to contact him. But when he’s finished with that part Draco just keeps looking at him, so Harry continues. He tells Draco about the sex, and it’s easier than he’d thought. Maybe because Draco had seen the evidence of it already, maybe because Draco just nods and sips his tea. When Harry talks about something Matt did that he didn’t particularly enjoy Draco frowns at his tea, and not at Harry and it makes it easier somehow. Harry tells Draco about Matt’s parting words too, just in case it becomes relevant to their work later.
“Thank you,” he said when Ron had finished the last bite of his roast. “For you know, letting me use the cabin and helping me get away. And for the patience. I know the last few years haven’t been great – I haven’t been great.”
Ron laughed. “Yeah, but I mean, what led you to think he was up to something? You only noticed that because you were always watching him in the first place.”
“What does it matter?” Harry asks, desperate to get Draco off the subject of Harry’s emotional hangovers before he veers off into what causes them. “I’m sorry I went off without you last night, really, but I’ve got a way to Crabbe. Please can we just let this go?”
“You know I need a plan for the next five, ten, and twenty years if I’m going to sleep at night,” she said, shoving at Harry’s chair with her foot. “I’m trying to accept that this feels right for you, and not cringe over how wrong it would feel for me.”
“Well, someone had to call out that bigoted, ignorant –,” Hermione paused and took a deep breath to calm herself, “man.”
Malfoy takes Harry’s hand and pulls him to the small door at the back of the classroom, walking into an office that looks like it hasn’t been used in years. It’s clean though, and there’s an old sofa against one of the walls.
Harry cooks them breakfast. Pancakes, strawberries and bacon with maple syrup because he’s feeling drained and the sugar will do him good. Draco pours him a glass of orange-juice and makes tea for them both, remembering to add two sugars to Harry’s.
She looks almost scared, and Harry doesn’t understand why. He almost got off with a bloke last night, he obviously doesn’t mind the same gender part.
Harry lets Daniel pull him to the top floor of the bar, through the VIP area Ginny had mentioned, and to a fireplace. The whole floor is strangely quiet and away from the pulsing music Harry suddenly feels unsure. Daniel looks at him considering, before handing him a piece of parchment.
“Yes, dropping, drop, sub drop, whatever you like. That’s what’s happening right now, it’s what’s been happening every other week for as long as we’ve been partners. It’s -” Draco breaks off, staring at Harry’s confused face with horror again. “You have no idea what a drop is, do you?”
“Merlin’s tits, Potter, you’re so hot. You have no idea. The things you say, the way you look kneeling and bending over my bed like this. I could spend hours eating your arse, bringing you to the edge again and again. Or I could fuck you hard and fast.”
“Greg and I didn’t realise how wrong Voldemort was until it was too late to turn back; too late to earn forgiveness. Yet here I am,” Draco gestures to their office. “While Vincent, who realised how fucked up it all was before Voldemort even returned and acted to do the right thing, died believing he’d murdered his friends and the leader of the side he’d chosen.”
“Thank you,” he said. “Really. But I think it’s time to find somewhere permanent for myself. I’ve been going to these Christmas markets in small Muggle towns, and some of them are so lovely. And quiet, but not too quiet, you know? I think in the long run the cabin might be a little too quiet.”
Crabbe’s hand is inches from Harry when he speaks, and the second his words are out the door explodes open. Crabbe and Matt turn to stare at the empty doorway and Crabbe raises a shield between himself and the door just in time to deflect Draco’s stunner. Harry acts fast, pulling his wand from the hidden pocket in his jeans and casting at Crabbe’s back. Not his finest moment, he thinks, but worth it when the giant man crumbles to the floor.
“I’ll have to start bringing Draco around more so I’m not constantly being the third wheel to whatever fucked up bi-cycle you two have going on,” she says, but doesn’t get out of the bed like she had the first couple of times. “And yes, that was indeed a bi-pun.”
Harry wants to laugh, or scream, or break something. He wants to break out of this stupid box and rush after Draco. He wants to curse Ron and Hermione for being so stupid, or himself for being even dumber. The force of his emotions fuels the storm around him for a second before it dies down. The air in the box instead goes unnaturally still and cold.
“Hard limits and things we really like or need, and a safeword,” Draco says, then seeing the confusion on Harry’s face continues. “Hard limits are things we absolutely will not do. As you learn more about kinks and BDSM in general I’m guessing you’ll discover more hard limits than you have right now, because people are into a lot of things I’d never even heard of before I became active in the community. That’s alright. You can always change things you like and don’t like, just remember to tell me.”
But when Harry had asked him out for a pint after the trials were all done Malfoy had turned him down. And he hadn’t tried to rebuild in other ways either. He donated an absolutely obscene amount of money to charity, but all of it anonymously or under aliases. Harry only knows because he used his authority as an Auror to do a little off-the-books investigating. Finally, Harry had settled on the theory that Malfoy had given up England as a lost cause and was investing his time in making a life in France. But here he was, fucking with Harry’s brain, and making all his buttons shake with the knowledge that they’re about to be pushed.
“I used to wonder if everyone who was supposed to be my family was up there,” Harry admits. “My parents and Sirius at first, and then Remus too.”
“Figured if I was going to learn a wandless and wordless spell it should be something that would be useful for both work and play,” Draco laughs. His laugh is infectious and Harry catches it, feeling giddy with the fact that sex can be like this. That the sex
The rest of the walk is spent reminiscing about the various delicious dishes they’ve had at Hogwarts in the past. It’s a good way to start the course, and it serves as a distraction from looking around the grounds for places where their friends fell in battle.
. The hallway at night doesn’t feel safe enough, and he doesn’t dare try it in the bathroom in case Malfoy decides to start walking away. Harry feels like his skin has been electrified most of the time, ready to spark whenever Malfoy brushes against him, which he does more often than strictly necessary. Harry can still feel the brush against his fingers from when Malfoy handed him a quill yesterday, the hand on his shoulder when Malfoy gripped it this morning. The warmth along his arm from where Malfoy had pressed close when they walked to class.
Ron laughs kindly, getting up from his chair to give Harry a pat on the shoulder that’s just on the side of painful. “Mate, as long as you’re happy I really don’t care.”
“Well, no, I wanted to – with you, but that’s alright,” Harry says, dejected. Being rejected by Malfoy shouldn’t
"You never look at me," Daniel says when Harry doesn't answer. "It's like you feel uncomfortable the minute you see me. I look at you and I feel weak in the knees, I want to touch you and kiss you and I don't think I'll ever get tired of doing that - but I just… Am I crazy for being afraid that you don't even enjoy it at all? Looking at me, kissing me, sleeping with me. I can't tell if it's just my anxiety being a total Boggart, or if you just actually don't enjoy being with me."
Three-month anniversary? Is that a thing? Harry keeps his eyes closed, letting panic rush through him. He’s been trying so hard - and this is where he’s going to fuck it up. Daniel keeps kissing him though, and eventually, Harry kisses back and shakes off the final remains of sleep.
Harry's breathing sped up as he let Malfoy wrap a soft fabric around his wrists. It wasn't smooth enough to be silk, but not rough enough to be a rope either. It was velvet, Harry realised, when Malfoy gave a tug to the ribbon and the fabric suddenly felt rough around Harry's wrists.
Harry tries to imagine living like that, weighing every word to decide if it’s worth being spoken – always wondering if you’re stealing space from someone else by opening your mouth. It feels constricting just to think of it.
It was standing in his garden watching as the bluebells grew that Harry remembered the dating site he’d signed up for two months prior. He went inside and searched the luggage he’d panic-packed when he ran away for his Po-cuter, wondering if he’d even thought to pack it. He found it all the way at the bottom and set it up on the table before enlarging it to full size and logging on to the site.
“I want – I want you. Close. In all ways. I want you to let me in, tell me what you’re thinking, tell me I’m –,” Harry breaks off and blushes furiously, gathering his strength. “Tell me I’m good. I want you as close as you can get. I want you in me.”
He doesn't have a  destination in mind, just a desperate need to get away from himself. He hears footsteps behind him and assumes it’s Draco, but he can’t slow down now. If he stops all his thoughts and feelings will catch up to him and he can’t let them. He should just feel happy, but he’s a selfish prick and he can’t manage it.
Harry shakes his head and slams the book on the table a little harder than he intended. It doesn’t escape him how easily his brain decided that yes, he does want to sleep with Malfoy. Wants to see him let go, see the impeccable man in front of him fall apart with pleasure and instinct. His curiosity, apparently, isn’t at all restricted to what Malfoy is
This chapter has and almost-sex scene between Harry and an OMC. If you want to avoid the “on-screen” sexual content, just skip to the first linebreak after Harry enters the Floo.
“Yeah, I was meeting with him when you texted. Told him this is where we usually meet.” Matt’s hands sneak down to Harry’s arse as he speaks, and Harry leans into it. It’s too easy to be Henry, after all the time he’s spent doing it.
At least today Harry has Potions again, it’ll be easier following Malfoy around all day when they’re in the same classroom. His wand woke him early and he summoned a fresh pair of clothes and cast all the cleaning and freshening spells he knows on himself. He’s craving a shower more than ever; the heat and privacy as hot water loosens all the knots in his back. A soapy hand releasing another kind of tension.
“It started almost right after we got here, you were suddenly obsessed with Malfoy. But it was more than before, more intense. You were always lying about it, about where you were going and what you were doing. Then you just stopped hanging around me and Hermione entirely, spending all your time with him. We thought it was odd, so we checked -,”
“You should quit,” Harry said, immediately regretting his words. He’d tried very hard not to tell Draco what to do, and let him make his own decisions. Still, it hurt to watch the man he loved go to work every day knowing he would be miserable.
“We should get started on making our dreams come true then,” Harry says, eyes fixed on Draco’s hand moving slowly up and down his own cock. “I want you to fuck me so I’ll feel it for days. I never want to not feel you.”
Harry forced his eyes open and winced at the strong light in his bedroom. He’d forgotten to turn the lights off again, and the electric lights combined with the sun did a number on his hangover. He put one hand over his eyes to shield them and reached out to his nightstand with the other, feeling blindly for his glasses. Instead, his hand closed around his wand and he held it out to cast a summoning spell. He had to clear his throat three times before he could speak the full spell, but when he finally succeeded his glasses came flying from beneath his covers. He must have fallen asleep wearing them again.
“Please what?” Draco asks, finger running back and forth over Harry’s opening and making him push back for more.
“Well this whole thing is pretty surreal,” Malfoy says, gesturing between them. “Both of us doing sex-work. The two of us, well —”
His orgasm hit more forcefully than he knew it could, making every muscle in his body spasm and shake with pleasure as it washed over him in wave after wave, as if determined to make up for the two he’d missed. Draco fucked him through it, and when Harry’s body finally relaxed and he almost collapsed into bed, Draco kept a firm grip on his hips and kept on fucking him.
Crabbe walks closer, and Harry struggles against Matt’s grip. He should get his wand out too, he should do
“But this is so much better than Potions,” Harry says. He still feels the ghost of Malfoy’s lips on his own, and he isn’t sure he’ll be able to do any thinking at all for at least a few hours. Not when the static electricity on his skin has been set ablaze by Malfoy. He feels on fire with it, hot with desire and need so intense he’s not sure he
Ron grins. “I’d wager Snape put a fireproofing charm on it. Remember how angry he got with Neville when he let his book get too close to the cauldron and it caught fire?”
“Circe Potter, the man was old enough to be my father. No, I did not have a childhood crush on Snape,” Malfoy says. “You, however, never let age stop you from that crush you had on Lupin.”
him like that. He just wants the sensations, the feeling of being sated after. He thinks he’d like the closeness after too if it wasn’t for the guilt he always feels at the obvious difference to how he and Daniel feels. Harry can walk out of the shower and the combination of the water, the steam and exposed skin will get Daniel going immediately, but Harry will look at him in the same situation and feel
“Honestly Draco, giving up was the best thing I ever did. It’s not giving up when it’s not taking you somewhere you want to be.”
“Pretty much, yeah,” Harry admitted. “I Apparated all over England last night, but I couldn’t find anywhere I didn’t feel like shit.”
Draco catches Harry’s mouth in a kiss, hands moving to tug gently at his hair. “Me too. Fuck you feel so good.”
“Yes,” Harry says, surprising himself by sounding almost out of breath with the need to make Malfoy believe him. “I don’t think you’re evil, or up to something bad. I swear. But I never know with you, what you’re thinking or feeling, or why you do the things you do. And I know my curiosity usually lands me in the stupidest situations, but I can’t help it with you.”
The first time Harry had gone to a BDSM party he'd expected it to be terrible. Hermione had dragged him along talking excitedly about spanking and impact play. That had been the theme for the evening, and it had been what convinced Harry he wanted nothing more than to be a sub. The look of absolute pleasure flashing across people's faces when a hand or a paddle landed on their arse had been enough for Harry to want to try, and the pure ecstasy he'd felt when he let a bloke bend him over the sofa so he could give it a go had been enough to make him never want to stop.
Harry sighed and let his body collapse into the sofa-cushions. “Yeah. I have no idea how to deal with that.”
Draco sets a steady rhythm with his thrusts, leaning down over Harry, hands on the bed beside him. “I like to hear you.”
Draco looked nothing like he had at sixteen, Harry thought, yet so shockingly similar at the same time. His hair was still the same almost white, but it hung loosely around his face. His features were still striking with high, defined cheekbones and a straight nose. He had filled out a little and was clearly fit. The biggest difference to the last time Harry had seen him though, was how he held himself. Where he’d radiated arrogance at sixteen, he now seemed more quietly confident. Though his current expression was one of sadness.
Ginny makes a sound of protest but Harry hasn’t taken his eyes off of Draco, and he catches the silencing look he sends her.
“I love you,” Draco said, seeming to surprise himself. It wasn’t a huge step, not when they’d been saying ‘I’m in love with you’ since the day they met in person. But it was, because they hadn’t said that yet.
Draco kept picking up pieces of tomato and putting them in his mouth, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Harry had gripped onto the table to keep from getting up and throwing himself at the other man. It was their first date, technically. The start of their first date at that. Harry was going to let Draco finish his meal. He wasn’t going to throw himself at him right after they’d properly met.
“I do love you Harry,” Draco says. Harry doesn’t bother trying to examine if he’s saying it because he means it or because Harry asked for it. It doesn’t matter. He lets the words ring in his ears, trying to memorise every part of them.
"The date is set for six months from now." Draco places a hand on Harry's knee, and though the gesture should be comforting, it only hurts.
“I know,” Harry says, feeling terribly nervous about the whole thing. It had seemed like a better idea after several drinks.
Ron groaned and looked at the book Harry had left by the firepit from when he’d been reading earlier. “Not you too. Am I the only one who thinks reading is dead boring?”
“Fine,” Draco says, and Harry aches with knowing he’s hurt him. It bleeds through his clipped words and stiff shoulders. Draco thinks Harry doesn’t trust him. Harry knows, because when he turns to get their Pensive Draco rolls down his sleeves to hide his faded Mark.
Harry grabs the stick back from Ayla when she returns it to him. He picks her up and walks over to Draco, feeling strangely happy despite his surroundings.
"You do get off on pain, don't you?" Malfoy asked, and Harry leaned his head back to look at the pleased expression of the man standing behind him.
Harry nods and Draco scoots a little closer, placing his hand on Harry’s back and rubbing his thumb in smooth circles. The tension seeps out of Harry’s shoulders as he lets the sensations soothe him.
“Right, so are we done? Only I’d like to get to lunch.” Harry stuffs his book into his bag without waiting for an answer. He’s ready to find Hermione and get this
“Mione! We need you!” he yelled. He made up two more plates and poured orange juice into glasses, and Harry got the feeling he was trying very hard to keep busy so the talking could be postponed until Hermione arrived. Harry didn’t blame him, he’d acted crazy. Not just in running away, but in creating a life he felt the need to run away from.
“It should be about what you both like, that’s the whole point. You should both enjoy everything that happens, and he should take care of you after. Talk you through it, clean you off, get you water.”
“Yes, alright? I figured out who you were, and I still liked you, because our deal worked for me. You know, the one where we agreed to keep talking long enough to not be influenced by who we thought the other was?”
“That too,” Harry says. “But most important, the plant is officially your responsibility. Neville can give you the sad eyes when he comes over to find it half-dead.”
“Try saying that again?” Harry laughs, suddenly feeling a whole lot better about having to re-make his chocolate frosting.
“I’m sorry I invaded your privacy. I’m sorry I hurt you. I put my memories in a Pensieve. I’d like you to watch them, if you want. That way you can hear my thoughts too.”
"I mean, probably. But if there are I haven't heard of them yet. I'm er, pretty new to this still," Harry admitted, hoping his inexperience wouldn't scare Malfoy away.
An hour later Harry is sitting in the Potions classroom flipping victoriously through his old Potions book. The outside has been discoloured by ash, but the book itself hasn’t been touched by the fire at all. Harry hears the voices chatting quietly around him quiet down, and he looks up in interest. The Potions teacher isn’t listed on his schedule, probably because of the late hire, and Harry’s curious to see who they’ve chosen. Whoever it is, they can’t be worse than Snape.
As they walk out of the dining hall Harry feels his wrist get colder, he takes another few steps and suddenly the band around his wrist tightens and pulls him forcefully back, making Harry fall flat on his arse.
Draco enters his bedroom wearing only his pants, and carrying a wet towel and a glass of orange juice. Harry’s pleased to see the wet patch on Draco’s pants and he doesn’t bother asking about the stuff he’s brought. Draco will explain when he’s ready. Draco places glass and the towel on Harry’s nightstand and looks down at Harry’s clenched fists.
“I did my homework,” Harry admits while putting the kettle on. Maybe the kitchen is the best room for talking because there are so many excuses for avoiding eye-contact.
Ginny and Pansy both look at him with a strange expression on their face as soon as the words leave his mouth.
Harry had considered going into politics himself but had decided against it. He had been content to help raise money and awareness, because he had no idea on how to actually make laws and policies that worked for everyone. Hermione would be great at it though.
“I wanted to make sure you wouldn’t react poorly if I approached you. I’ll look at you, next time.” Malfoy speaks the words like a promise, and it sends a shiver down Harry’s spine. Which is stupid, because he doesn’t
“Are you coming out tonight, Harry?” Ginny asks when Harry pokes his head into her bathroom to find her curling her hair.
off his wrist, but he can’t just run out after agreeing to talk to Malfoy. And fuck, what if the weird whispers aren’t just in Harry’s ear? What if Malfoy hears Harry too?
Harry thinks back to conversations with his other friends, how they all describe sex as something integral to their relationships – to their lives, and it feels strange to know that Draco enjoys it but doesn’t find it necessary.
The firepit was overgrown, but with a little weeding Harry thought he could make it usable again. The chairs though, were a lost cause. Harry vanished them and set to work making the felled tree by the firewood into a bench he could sit on. Then he got to work weeding the area around the fireplace, using his hands and his wand to cut away withered grass, vanish old leaves, and pull up weird plants that stuck his fingers if he grabbed them the wrong way.
He knows Draco thinks about penetrative sex. Harry thinks about it too, all the time. Especially during moments like last night when Draco had two fingers in his arse and his mouth on Harry’s cock. Merlin, Harry had
“It has a whole chapter on romantic and sexual attraction,” Hermione says, “you should read it – it’s really interesting.”
He takes the stairs two at a time and throws her door open, not even blinking when he finds Pansy in bed with her. Pansy’s been here more than at her own place lately. Ginny scoots closer to her girlfriend the second she sees the look on Harry’s face and with a grateful sigh, Harry crawls into bed next to them in the free space Ginny made.
“The second one,” Harry admitted, eyes fixed on Draco’s lips as his tongue darted out to lick away a stray drop of juice.
Harry smiles, wondering what the crowd makes of their conversation. If they’re really as jealous as Malfoy says they are. He’s pulled from his thoughts by the feeling of the blue rope against his arm. Malfoy is just running it up and down, letting Harry get used to the feel of it while the audience audibly holds their breath. Malfoy lets most of the rope fall to the floor, and lays the end he’s holding on to over one of Harry’s shoulders, running it across his chest and tucking it below his arm on the other side. He ties it in the back and repeats the motion the other way around, making an x across Harry’s chest.
"But I don't think I can fit into that space. I thought I could, I thought if I gave it enough time I'd want to, but I just can't. I don't think the feelings you want are something I'm capable of having. I don't think I'll ever look at someone and want sex. And I have so much love in me to give, but I don't think I'll ever be
“Poisons,” Malfoy says. “I figure you Aurors have a better chance of not dying if you’re familiar enough with how the most common potions look and smell.”
Harry had felt broken and alone, and he hadn’t been able to stop the creeping realisation that maybe he wasn’t worth loving. Or that if he was, the people who were interested in
“I need to work on this whole instinct where I instantly think you hate me,” Draco said. He rolled the sleeve back up to his elbow and walked close enough to lean on the kitchen counter next to Harry.
“What?” he asks, looking between Matt and Crabbe with huge eyes. He’s not entirely sure how much of his fear is acting and how much is real. Draco is close, after all. He’ll keep him safe.
Harry thinks back to the night with Matt. “I don’t like, uhm, blunt force? Does that make sense? I like pain, but the sharp kind. Like being slapped or spanked — but I don’t like being punched or thrown.”
“Didn’t you want sex though?” Ginny says with a laugh. “Because you’ve kinda been going on about it a lot lately.”
“Minerva took the memories I placed in there when I was alive and wove them into this portrait version of me,” Dumbledore says. “So you can fill it with your own memories if you like. I always meant for you to have it.”
Draco’s face fell, the remains of laughter vanishing in favour of a serious expression. He looked out of place in Harry’s summer garden with his wool coat and blue scarf. It was a stark contrast to Harry’s t-shirt, and though he was fully dressed, he felt strangely exposed.
The only good thing is the fact his schedule isn’t packed. Apparently, they’re expected to do a lot of self-study, which will inevitably bite him in the arse when exams roll around – but for now it’s nice to only have one class a day to worry about.
Once he’s claimed the word for himself though, he feels a growing cloud of guilt building over his head. He feels truly happy with himself for the first time in a long time, but only Ginny, Pansy and Draco know. He hasn’t told Ron and Hermione, and he knows they worry over him. He doesn’t want his orientation to be some secret that creates a wedge between him and his oldest friends.
"Or it'll make it brilliant," Harry argued. He'd spent several evenings in bed wanking to the idea of being tied down and unable to relieve himself while being brought to the edge of orgasm again and again. He'd never been able to do it himself, always feeling too impatient to hold off when his orgasm started building.
“I’m shit with plants,” Harry laughs. “The only reason that thing is still hanging on is Neville feeding it some potion every time he comes over. I’d throw it out, but I actually think he’d be upset.”
Harry mirrored the pace Draco set for himself on his own cock, using the hand wet with spit from holding Draco’s cock as makeshift lube for himself. He wasn’t going to last. Heat was pooling at the base of his spine, fed constantly by the pull on his hair, the ache of his jaw, and the roughness of the hand he was using to wank himself. The pace Draco had set was too slow, and Harry struggled to keep his hand from moving faster on himself. He wanted to come, wanted the pooling heat to spread out through his whole body and make him boneless with pleasure.
“Why did you think that? You’re the one who’s got a history of avoiding me,” Harry mutters before he can stop himself.
be. After taking a deep breath Harry realised the matches were sorted by ‘potential for love’. He winced at the wording but clicked on the match at the top of the list, determined to send a message. The match was listed on the site as ‘away’, but as long as they weren’t logged out, like Harry had been, their Po-cuter should ping to let them know of a new message. He crossed his fingers they’d hear it and be free to reply.
“Yes, I do. Please,” Harry says. He doesn’t wait for a response, just leaves Malfoy standing outside the door and rushes into the bathroom, groaning with relief as he empties his bladder. Fuck. He’s never getting distracted in the morning again.
Harry celebrates his birthday at Ginny and Pansy’s home. They’ve invited all his friends and the whole Weasley family and it’s a lovely day full of barbecue, laughter, and quidditch. Harry feels like he’s glowing with love.
“I’m glad you had Ron and Hermione with you then,” Draco says. “And I’m sorry I wasn’t - I’m sorry I was so easily seduced by the ring. Or some more fitting metaphor.”
“I know she was a bit of a shit in school, and fuck, I was so mad at her when she said we should turn you over to Voldemort, but she’s really grown up – I promise. And she’s really sorry about saying that! It’s how we met actually, she came up to me to apologize and –.”
“I think from the moment you met him to the moment you stopped talking should suffice,” Draco says. He doesn’t look happy about it either, to Harry’s relief.
“Mate?” Ron said, breaking Harry’s internal monologue. His hand was on Harry’s shoulder and he looked like he’d been trying to get Harry’s attention for a while already.
Hermione opened the door wearing her dressing gown and fixed him with a surprised expression. “Harry, what –,” she said.
Harry grabs Malfoy’s hand and directs it closer so he can scoop some of the lube into his other hand. He keeps his grip on Malfoy’s arm when he’s done, determined to ask again before he’s distracted.
“Me too,” he hurries to say when Draco flinches at the laugh. “Fuck, so much me too. I’m not always good at words either, I know you know that. Sometimes I say too much and sometimes I say too little, and I’m not always good at asking for the things I want or need.”
“Kind like what you’re doing right now?” Harry asks, frowning up at Draco. “Is that what’s happening, you’re giving me aftercare even though you’re furious and disgusted because it’s so obvious I’m a mess?”
Harry moans and forgets to answer for a second, distracted by the heat pooling at the base of his spine. He’s so close now.
“So good for me,” Draco groans, and it’s enough to push Harry over the edge. His hips arch off the bed and his arms thrash in their binds as everything in him overflows and he comes with a shout. Every nerve in his body vibrates with pleasure, and Harry is completely lost to it. Draco fucks him through it, mumbling words of praise and encouragement that makes Harry feel like he can keep coming for hours if Draco just keeps it up. When everything settles down to a pleasurable hum, Harry uses his legs for leverage to meet Draco’s thrusts until he’s coming too, collapsing onto Harry’s stomach and panting hard.
Ginny laughs. “She does. I’m actually going out with Pansy on Friday too. Thank fuck for silencing charms, right?”
“For your head, or whatever that is —,” he gestures to Harry and tosses the chocolate at him. “I swear the dementors left something in the walls of that place.”
Harry shrugs and slumps into the armchair. “It’s like, I like the idea of sex. I like reading about it or thinking about it. Mostly when I imagine it it’s removed from myself, you know, two people together who feel that attraction I don’t. But then when I read or hear about the feelings they’re having, that makes me horny. I could never look at someone and find them sexually attractive, but you could tell me about sleeping with someone and how good it felt and I’d want to feel the same way.”
“Fuck, Potter,” Malfoy says when his hips close the distance to Harry’s arse. “Should have done this sooner.”
Harry shook his head to stop the memories connected to the article from rushing in and Apparated to Millie’s office to get his itinerary for the next couple of days. The first item on his list was a birthday lunch with Ron and Hermione.
“Do you know anything else that you absolutely will not do?” Draco asks. “Or that you need in order to feel happy, sexually?”
“Merlin, your neck is gorgeous,” Draco says. “I love seeing it with my marks, love remembering how you gasped and buckled when I put it there. Love that everyone who sees them knows you’re mine.”
“Alright,” Daniel says. He starts pulling at him and Harry follows. He only opens his eyes when he stumbles over the edge of a carpet and almost falls over.
Harry sits on the sofa too, wishing he had an arm-chair or another sofa so he could give Draco more distance. He’ll want it, when he knows.
“You’re evil, I hope you recognize that.” Her stern expression is without its usual effect because of the smile she’s fighting. She holds it for three impressive seconds before grinning widely.
