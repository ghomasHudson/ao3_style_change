“I should have never said anything. You are a Merlin forsaken nuisance, Harry Potter.” Draco started to get off the bed, angrily doing up the buttons of his trousers. Harry grabbed his wrist, now openly snickering.
"Redecorating, apparently," said Potter from his place near a window, smirking. He was twirling his wand in his fingers, completely unconcerned about Draco's previous intimidation techniques. Weasley laughed and turned to Draco.
They were sitting around a table in the drawing room. Ron Weasley had brought yet another basket, only this time with an appalling amount of breakfast goods that were already divided into individual portions. Or what Mrs. Weasley figured that an individual should have as a portion.
“It’s remarkable magic!” Draco sounded delighted, eyes shining bright and his hair sticking in all directions. That particular night ended with Harry atop his broom, shouting himself hoarse, and Ron laughing so much he got the hiccups. The chandelier was modified to spiting a harmless foamy material, which forever ingratiated Draco to Hermione.
“Well, if you’re going to break into song over Potter’s sainthood, by all means, don’t let me keep you,” he made to get up from his chair. Healer Hall actually rolled his eyes. The sheer
I’m writing this to you from our hotel room, on that little notepad they leave out for guests to use as you snore beside me. God. You’re so beautiful in the mornings when the sunlight hits you just right and makes you look like some sort of aristocratic prince. Of course, that’s only because you’re asleep and can’t open your big mouth to tell me to shut up.
Draco scoffed dismissively, ignoring the twinge of guilt in his gut. He glared at the ceiling until sleep claimed him again.
, had he not? A pinched-looking secretary had stared down her nose at Draco after that, and Draco had stared right back, his disdain all-encompassing. But Harry kept his promise to not go babbling about Draco’s impulsive use of Killing Curses, so the Malfoy heir felt the need to send him a thank-you note:
Harry was back at the Forbidden Forest. The wood’s floor was covered in chilly mist, and his surroundings were so quiet, Harry could hear his own heartbeat. He sighed, shoulders slumping. He was back on one of those dreams.
“Not sure you should be bragging about being insufferable,” said Harry, starting to pick on a napkin close to him. Then, trying very hard to sound casual:
"Draco, darling-" Pansy ducked when a huge chunk of wood flew by alarmingly close to her head. "Please can we just sit down and discuss this for a minute?"
“I wasn’t planning to murder your fucking relatives, you imbecile, but maybe someone should, if there was more than what Ron told me!”
“I’m never giving you another hand job. Ever. And see if I care when you end up screaming in your sleep.” Harry smiled broadly at him.
“I won’t impose you, Potter. Let’s reconsider the Manor option. Maybe talk to an expert.” Draco said, narrowing his eyes as he contemplated his options. “It can be done, I suppose.”
Harry snuck another peek at Draco. The soft light coming from the chandelier above their heads was playing with his hair and eyes, making him seem almost otherworldly. He had grown into his features, Harry realised. His pointy face had transformed into a sharp bone structure that looked rather nice, and he held himself with a casual elegance Harry had no hope of ever emulating. Harry shifted uncomfortably on his sit, frowning at his line of thought.
“I… Oh my God,” he groaned, hiding his face behind his hands. Draco got up, rubbing his backside and nodding.
, no signs of dark magic. Harry scratched the back of his neck, scanning the empty street one last time. Nothing about the whole situation made any sense. Plus, Malfoy was right, the git. He had no evidence, no body, no way to even make sure that somebody had been after them in the first place. He could charge Malfoy with the use of an Unforgivable, but that seemed petty at this point. The man
Harry told him about their plans later that night when they were in the kitchen. Harry was sitting by the table sipping butterbeer while Draco supervised a bunch of knives cutting vegetables. Harry could offer to help, but he was well aware that he would just get in the way. He knew a little about cooking from his years with the Dursleys, but Draco had a very wizarding approach to the whole thing, spells zapping everywhere, and Harry couldn’t be bothered to learn how to do things his way.
“Wizards are never bound by muggle sexualities. We may have preferences. But that doesn’t necessarily mean we aren’t fluid with who we pursue relationships with.” Lucius snorted, “And Harry may not have realised it yet. But he is definitely in love with you too. I can tell by the way he looks at you.”
“I think I might just have to pluck him away.” Sirius groaned, “But there is a high possibility that he will end up screaming bloody murder.”
“Draco. I swear to Merlin, if you’re pulling my leg I will end you.” Sirius warned, “Like if I turn up at Remus’ place and he has no idea why I’m there. I will actually hurt you.”
“Then what’s the point of having it go that high?” Draco frowned, “And I was feeling a little peckish. Buttered toast sounded pretty good.”
“Ugh. Going on the piss? Is that what it's referred to? No wonder people feel awful." Draco complained, “I’ve learnt my lesson. I’m never doing this again.”
“I don’t have any carpets.” Draco continued, “Why is it so loud? Can’t they have created something a little less quiet?”
“You always look like a right plonker.” Draco joked, “With the amount of time you spend here, you might as well live here.”
“Mione, you can’t tell anyone.” Harry sighed, “I’ve been getting to know him and he’s not that bad of a person.”
“Things like this happen all the time.” Draco sighed, “They’re practically unavoidable, it wasn’t entirely your fault. But I think you should go to him. Harry and I will watch Teddy.”
“Hey!” Harry greeted, beaming at the two of them, “Why are you looking at me like I just killed your cat?”
“Are you crazy?” Draco hissed out, forcing his way into Harry’s house, “Scratch that. Of course, you’re bloody crazy. That’s the only thing that can explain how you would go to my parents hours within meeting me to request to court me.”
“I think it was just an excuse for her to check up on you.” Harry explained, “She basically spent the whole time she was at my house asking about you. I think you should probably invite her over here some time. She misses you.”
“I guess I can do that. It’s not like I have anything else to do.” Sirius snorted, “Harry doesn’t even visit these days. He found his own circle of friends.”
“It’s not really my place to say anything, and in all honesty, I just figured out everything out at the dinner.” Draco answered slowly, he wasn’t sure if Sirius would be comfortable with him telling Harry, “What do you want to know?”
“Just do what you have to.” Draco said softly, pressing a kiss to the top of Teddy’s head, “Sweetheart, you’re going to have to go home. I had fun with you, you’re free to come here whenever you want.”
“Meet up?” Draco queried, pondering it for a few minutes before deciding, “I guess I can do that. Is around lunchtime okay? I’m thinking any time after twelve in the afternoon.”
“No there is a reasonable explanation,” Narcissa stated firmly, taking a seat on the arm of Lucius’ chair. It made Draco feel kind of envious that his parents were still so much in love. It wasn’t something he had really ever experienced with his own partners, “It’s part of being a Black. Our dreams spill. You managed to create a connection with Harry, and I have no explanation as to why and how.”
“How do you know that I was the one that helped?” Draco frowned, the nurse must not have known who he was, “It could have been anyone.”
“Yes. I haven’t received a response from her yet.” Draco started, “I was just wondering how the Slytherins were being treated. After the war, I don’t imagine that they’re on equal grounds as the other houses. They’re probably even considered evil.”
“I have you saved as a contact on my phone.” Harry explained, “That means that I can see who’s calling me and it makes it easier for me to call people.”
“We spoiled you too much.” Severus said fondly, “I should have locked the basement. I don’t know why I didn’t think that a fifteen-year-old teenager would be drawn to the basement full of alcohol.”
After a much needed hot shower, the wizard went to the nearest corner store and picked up some sweets and chocolates that he remembers wanting to try when he was younger. It was weird to think that he never really spoilt himself with Muggle treats after living with the Dursley’s. He just had way too much to think about and now he wondered if it was too late to try all the things he wanted to as a child.
“Other than me being madly in love with you. Nothing.” Draco responded. Sirius’ eyes looked like they were going to bulge out of his head and Draco didn’t realise why until he replayed the words he said in his head.
“Oh Harry, you’re so dastardly. You should be glad that I love you.” Draco snorted, “I still don’t understand why my parents chose peacocks out of all animals? I hate those birds.”
“Are you telling me you can do wandless magic?” Sirius questioned, sitting up straight. It was weird to think that his cousin was so interested in this.
“Fuck off.” Ron shot back, there was a fear that Ron would get his food all over Harry and that was something that he didn’t want, “You’re a dick.”
“How rude of me, I didn’t even introduce myself.” Harry apologised, flushing, “I’m Harry. And I really am sorry about being so forward.”
“You didn’t have to.” Draco said, accepting the bag from him, “So I’ve never eaten this kind of food before. Is there anything that I should avoid?”
“She doesn’t know anything about the dreams.” Sirius responded, “Her mother was disowned. She wouldn’t have experienced the dreams because she isn’t considered to be a part of the Black family.”
“I didn’t actually think that far because I didn’t think that this was going to happen.” Harry admitted, “Er. I guess we can just continue doing what we were doing?”
“Pansy. I’m not dating this guy.” Draco said firmly, “But he’s obsessed. He won’t stop messaging or calling me. I have no idea what to do.”
“He’s definitely his father’s son.” Sirius laughed, Draco gave him a pointed glare, “Draco. No. I’m telling you nothing more happened.”
“Oh, Merlin. You could have at least told me you were getting courted.” Sirius groaned, shooting Draco a glare. The blond sighed before placing a bookmark between the pages of his book and setting it down, “I’m just going to head to my room. If you two choose to have sex, please have consideration. The walls here are really thin and it’s not exactly something I want to hear.”
“Draco! I came as soon as I heard.” Narcissa voiced excitedly, pulling her son into her arms before pressing kisses onto his face, “So have the dreams started?”
“Oh. You’ve got most of it right.” Harry smiled, before clicking a switch, Draco withheld the temptation to tell Harry not to touch the switch because he still had no idea what it did. But as the kettle spurred into life, Draco stared at it curiously. Muggles were confusing. And to think that he mocked their lifestyle previously, “So you see the switch? It basically turns the electricity connection on.”
“I guess I’m not having toast,” Draco said softly, looking at the charred bread. Harry looked at the bread and Draco and for some bizarre reason that made him burst out in laughter. The brunet had never seen anyone look so forlorn over a piece of burnt bread.
“I’m sorry to tell you, but you’re about ten years too late with the sex talk.” Draco snorted, “But I was told you would be able to tell me about this weird dream walking thing that is something related to being a Black?”
He never thought that there would be a day that Harry would actually propose to him. Draco’s eyes were glued to Harry’s own and everything finally made sense. Harry was as equally in love with him.
“Now that everyone is here. Why don’t we go to the dining room and start on dinner?” Narcissa smiled, “We have so much to talk about.”
“What do you say?” Harry asked. This was the moment of truth. Hopefully, Draco wouldn’t be ruthless and reject him. If there was one thing that Harry feared, it was being rejected, “Will you allow me to court you?”
“I’ll keep that in mind.” Draco sighed, it was actually a pretty good idea. If Harry was hurt again, Draco would be guaranteed to be able to help him without the worry of causing more problems, “I think I’ll do it.”
“Okay. I guess we should get going now.” Harry smiled, pressing a kiss to Draco’s forehead, “I’ll see you later.”
“Harry Potter. Now can you tell me what the hell is going on?” Draco frowned, “When did this whole thing start?”
“Fine. Just so you know, we expect a housewarming party once you’ve unpacked everything.” Pansy smiled, “You won’t get us out of your life so easily Malfoy.”
“Does it have something to do with Sirius?” Draco asked curiously, it was shocking, to say the least. The couple hadn’t been married that long, only a few years. And they had a child together, “And don’t worry. It’s not my place to tell anyone.”
“I was the one that did things wrong.” Draco frowned, “But that doesn’t matter anymore. So how are we going to move forward with this?”
“Thank you for getting rid of a few unnecessary years.” Harry grinned, picking his cup up in a mock toast, “But I’m sure it’s not too bad if you don’t drink it all the time.”
“Wasn’t I always your wingman?” Draco snorted, “I’m glad that you’re happy. It had to get hit in the face for you to score a date.”
“Of course I did! It’s a dishwasher!” Harry responded. It didn’t make sense for Draco to be reacting that way, unless he was using the dishwasher for a completely different reason. And for some reason, that wouldn’t even phase Harry. The brunet had already witnessed the weirdest things while living with Draco. Nothing shocked him anymore, “What on earth do you think it’s used for? Storing dishes?”
“No. I think it’s about time. A whole year without magic is definitely enough.” Sirius answered, “But you don’t have a wand anymore, do you? It’s not going to be easy without a wand.”
Draco had never thought he would be in a situation like this. He had currently moved all his stuff to Harry’s place, but he wasn’t expecting the mess. The blond wasn’t entirely sure what to expect, but it definitely wasn’t this… So that’s why Harry was shocked by the cleanliness of his place. It looked like Draco had a lot of work ahead of him.
“No. I unboxed mostly everything.” Draco responded, before pointing at the kettle, “I need help on working that contraption.”
“Oh. Sorry.” Draco laughed, “This book is in French. I sometimes forget how to alternate between the languages. So what can I do for you?”
“Fuck. I never did apologise for that.” Harry groaned, “I had no idea that was going to happen. I- I am really sorry. If I knew I-”
“No. No. Draco we cannot keep a cat in the house.” Harry groaned, Draco just gave him a look and it was clear that Harry had already lost the battle. The cat was now a part of the family, “Fine. Jesus. The cat can stay.”
“Because I know who your dream-mate is.” Draco answered, “But now my question is, what are you going to do about it?”
“Dreammate, cute.” Sirius grinned, before giving Draco a serious look, “It’s you. You’re my dream mate.”
“Oh, Salazar.” Lucius snorted, the older wizard looked amused at Sirius’ antics. Draco loved that his family were so accepting of his relationship with Harry. He was glad that he was able to find a family in all of Harry’s friends. These new ties were something that he was going to cherish for the rest of his life, “Harry, welcome to the family. Well, officially.”
“You conniving- What do you want from me? Dreams should remain that. Dreams.” Draco grounded out. The blond was awfully feisty, it was something that Harry quite liked, “I’ve done some research and I think I have figured out a way to stop the dreams.”
“That’s the reason Hermione broke up with you.” Harry snorted, “Don’t speak with your mouth full. It’s disgusting.”
“Harry. We haven’t seen you in a while.” Hermione smiled, hugging her friend, “Ron seems to think that you’re blowing us off for a girl.”
“They’re for Draco.” Harry grinned, the blond didn’t even acknowledge Harry’s appearance. But Harry was going to change that, “Courting gifts.”
“What? No. They’re clean.” Draco said, using his hip to push Harry out of the way. The blond’s eyes widened considerably as he opened the dishwasher, “Harry. Please tell me that you didn’t put dirty dishes in here.”
“Draco wants to be a potions master?” Harry asked, peering at Draco curiously. They hadn’t yet had the chance to talk about this. The blond hadn’t even broached the topic that he was planning on re-entering the Wizarding world, “I think it’s a good idea if that’s what he wants.”
“How important are we talking?” Harry asked, tapping the side of his mug. The tea was probably already cold and Harry despised the idea of re-heating it, but sometimes desperate times called for desperate measures. You could only really heat a cup of tea once or twice, well Harry was sure that he heard that from somewhere. He never really considered researching it, but he hadn’t really had any problems from having re-heated tea, “And why is he visiting?”
“Yes, he did.” Harry laughed, “And of course he did it in the most flamboyant way he could. I’m sure you probably already know what your father did.”
Even Harry knew that there was a high possibility that Draco was going to end up doing it again. Harry felt like a bit of a hypocrite as he also occasionally went on the piss.
“No. It’s Pansy.” Draco answered. He wasn’t sure how to bring up the subject. Maybe it would be best to just hit the nail on the head, “She’s not feeling too well.”
“Of course it was going to be something that would eventually happen.” Draco smiled, “The chemistry between the two of you was crazy, and I’m surprised you didn’t hook up a lot earlier.”
“You’re really not going to let this go, are you?” Draco frowned, he paused before continuing to talk. Almost as if he was unsure if he should make the preposition, “Fine. I will give this thing a try. But I insist that we work on figuring out what caused us to be connected in the first place. And if this doesn’t work out, we will need to figure out how to end this for good.”
“They should treat you better.” Draco whispered to the piano, letting his fingers graze the ivory keys. It made him miss his own piano at the Malfoy Mansion. It made him miss home.
“You’re learning big words from her now.” Draco teased, hanging out with Ron made him realise that the Weasley’s were pretty fun banter. They always made things fun and he knew where the line was, so there wasn’t a chance of it hurting anyone. Ron was fun, “Hanging out with Hermione has done you good.”
“Come on. I’m going to need you to sit up for a little bit.” Harry said, helping up. The smell of food made Draco salivate. It smelt so good. The blond couldn’t help but scarf it down, Harry let out a little laugh at the sight of Draco eating like a monster. He got through half of the foam food container before giving up.
“Okay.” Harry frowned, walking over to the toaster, before finally taking notice of the smoke and smell wafting off the toaster, “Oh bloody hell! It’s burning!”
“So I hear that you’re courting Draco Malfoy.” Severus sighed, lighting the fire before taking a seat, “Do you want to tell me what’s going on?”
“Yes. They’re rather interesting, but confusing at the same time.” Draco admitted, “Hermione. I wanted to apologise. What I said back in Hogwarts was not right.”
“Yes. They did break my heart,” Sirius said solemnly, placing his face in his hands. Heartbreak was one of those things that made Draco grateful that he had never fallen in love. He didn’t want to be hurt in that way, “That’s why I’m not going to talk about it.”
“You can tell me the truth. I know the kid’s a menace.” Sirius laughed, making his way to collect Teddy. The toddler, in turn, glared at Sirius, before clutching onto Draco’s shirt, “Well. That’s different.”
“I wasn’t aware that you could read French.” Harry commented, finally taking a seat on the other side of the sofa. Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s socks, grey striped socks that looked extraordinarily cosy.
“I want a holiday extension,” Harry said bluntly. He wanted as much time off as he could. Harry had enough money to retire, but he was sure he would get bored if he sat around doing nothing. He needed to figure out what to do next before moving away from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, “Two weeks.”
“Tonks already knows.” Sirius answered, completely ignoring Harry’s previous statement, “She was the first person to find out. Remus didn’t feel comfortable with us dating without her knowing. But she saw it as something that was going to happen eventually.”
“No. I don’t know. It’s too early to know if they’re going to be twins.” Pansy admitted, “The father is Ron.”
“Really? How many dates have you been on?” Andy grinned, it was clear that the older man was challenging their claim. Draco never backed away from a challenge. He would make sure that Andy left the place thinking that Harry was his boyfriend and that they were madly in love.
“You know. I probably would have been in Slytherin if you weren’t such a dick.” Harry snorted, earning a glare from Draco, “Oh come on. You know I love you.”
“We’ll keep that in mind.” Hermione said, handing a sheet of paper to Draco, “Our numbers are there if you need to get in contact. Harry has insisted that we all get phones. Anyway. We’ll see you tomorrow.”
“So you’re saying that I’m not attractive enough for Draco Malfoy?” Harry frowned, it was bizarre considering the fact that Draco was definitely dating him. They were fucking dating.
“Why would you want to contact her? Aren’t you dating Hermione?” Draco questioned. Hermione spat out her water in shock, the witch had managed to get it everywhere. Including on Draco, “Well. I wasn’t expecting that.”
That was the weirdest dream he had ever experienced in experiences of dreams. And that was saying something considering the fact that he at one point shared nightmares with Voldemort.
“Hermione did the majority of the planning and most of my ideas got vetoed.” Harry answered, “You’re very smart. Like Hermione, so I guess I thought that you would do the same?”
“Ugh. Going on the piss? Is that what it's referred to? No wonder people feel awful." Draco complained, “I’ve learnt my lesson. I’m never doing this again.”
“I knew I could count on you darling.” Narcissa laughed, shooting a playful wink to Draco. The blonde then turned to Harry and fixed him with a stare. She was going to keep the others busy while they tried to help Sirius, “Now Harry. What do you do? I think it’s time we learnt more about each other as you’re going to be family now.”
It didn’t take long for them to prepare for bed. It was weird for Draco to have Harry in his bed. His let his fingers run down Harry’s hair. The blond was in awe.
Harry let out a snort of laughter at the sight of the blond. He just couldn’t control it. The wizard never thought that there would be a day that he would actually see Draco in this sort of state.
“I don’t know if it’s something he would want me to share.” Draco said reluctantly, “Let’s just say that things are a little complicated for him at the moment.”
“And I’ll take the chicken tikka masala and I’d also like naan with it.” Harry smiled, “Can we both get glasses of mango lassi too?”
“Do you have chamomile?” Luna questioned, taking a seat in his chair. The good thing about his apartment was that he would still be able to maintain a conversation with someone while he was in the kitchen. So making tea wasn’t awkward. Draco smiled as he passed the tea over to Luna, “So I’ve heard that you’ve been in contact with Headmistress McGonagall?”
“Well. I guess the two of you need to make up for lost time.” Draco pointed out, not many people were aware of it. But Draco did spend some time at Azkaban. Definitely not as much as Sirius, but he did know how awful it was. He couldn’t even imagine being there as long as Sirius had. The few months he was there made him lose his mind slightly, “No better time than the present.”
“I wanted to talk to Draco, but as you’re already here I guess I could kill two birds with one stone.” Ginny smiled brightly, “And I’m dating Blaise. I guess I forgot to tell you.”
They hadn’t taken well to the fact that Harry and Draco were in a relationship. Draco had often waking up to some scandalous account that suggests that Harry was cheating on him or they had broken up. Over the course of the last few years, Draco was definite that according to the Daily Prophet they had broken up way too many times to have even been possible. It was stupid because there was that time that they had managed to take a picture of Draco that kind of looked like he was crying, but the blond was suffering from a side effect after fucking up a potion. His eyes were constantly watering and his nose burned like a bitch.
“You expect me to trust a machine to deal with cleaning porcelain and glass?” Draco frowned, “I hand wash all my dishes, that way they’re guaranteed to be clean and won’t get damaged. The dishwasher is a good place to store dishes that are still wet.”
“Erm… I’m remodelling Grimmauld Place?” Potter asked while accepting a plate filled high with eggs and toast.
"I will expect irreproachable behavior from you at Hogwarts, gentleman. None of your previous shenanigans will be tolerated."
"I though the whole point of having to put up with your aggravating self was to fix the Manor, no? Surely blasting the portraits go against the spirit of the mission?"
“Oh relax, Potter,” Draco said with an eye-roll. He flicked his wand at the clock, and the bird froze where it was. Harry sagged to the nearest armchair, running his fingers through his hair.
"I'm trying to help you, you unbelievable prat!" Potter yelled, angrily getting back to bed. "Why do you have to make everything so difficult?! And
The war had seen the Malfoy name in the gutter. Vaults frozen, Father imprisoned (that one was actually the only perk), Mother in tears banished to Toulouse, and Draco… Well. Draco was on house arrest until the start of term at Hogwarts, where he was required to take his NEWTS, as per one of the interminable clauses of his probation. Living until then on a meagre allowance that barely put food on the table.
Their eyes met for a long moment and Draco felt his resolve crumbling. He took a deep breath and scooched to the far end of his bed, pointedly raising his covers. Harry was lying by his side almost instantly.
"Oh,” Draco said quietly. Potter arched an eyebrow when Draco turned to look at him. He seemed to be saying
He abruptly froze midway through his sleepy wiggling around routine. Took alarmed inventory of the arm thrown possessively over him, the warm breath pleasantly tickling the hairs on the back of his neck. And was that a stiffy poking him around the...
In response to your ludicrous suggestion: Well, I suppose you’ll just have to wait and watch, won’t you?
“No. What assassination plan was that?” Draco huffed and tapped his fingers on the side of the armchair.
Green eyes were ablaze with fury all of which was directed at him, he took as much as he could before he averted his eyes. Lips parted to say something, but it appeared Harry had enough for one night, he turned, storming from the tower. Draco looked back to the window, a sigh escaping his parted lips, the words hidden amongst it surprised him.
Charms class passed easily, it was a lecture day, and while they tried to focus, they ended up passing notes across the dual desk they sat at, smothering laughter at what the other said. They both lost five points respectively but made up 20 points each when they perfected a charm on the first try. Muggle studies had Draco at a loss, though Harry was bored during the entire thing, he ended up passing a note to Draco promising to explain everything he did not understand. Harry earned 10 points for knowing several household items needed in a muggle home. Draco earned 5 when Harry snuck him the answer to one of the questions no one else knew. It worked out to be fun, but Harry was not sure why he had kept that class.
They actually ate after that, talking listlessly about their classes between bites. Draco lamenting on the new Dark Arts teacher and Harry explaining how hard training was, how painful it could be sometimes. They walked to charms together, ignoring the looks of horror, awe and confusion that were sent their way, ignoring it in favour of just having someone to talk to who did not bring up the war.
"Who is getting sappy Malfoy?" He bit back. Laughter bubbled from his chest, and Malfoy joined in after a moment. It was short-lived, but something whispered to Harry. He knew something was bothering Malfoy. "Ginny kissed me in here. It started something I was not ready to handle." The look he received, a curled nose and a soft gagging noise. It was childish enough to make him forget the awful, awful things in their past.
"Welcome, Harry.." McGonagall swept over to him, pulling him further into the classroom, raising his gaze, he met the startling purple haze of the ministries dog. "Potter." he nodded and bowed slightly before turning those shocking eyes to the headmistress.
"Cheer up Potter, being registered just ensures that you don't use it nefariously." McGonagall quipped, patting Harry's hair down.
By supper time, he gave in, plopping down across from Harry, much to everyone's surprise. Leaning over the table let his eyes narrow "Fine. Let's see where this goes. Just let me have some peace again." he muttered.
Even knowing that Draco was also able to see the changes in Harry. Gone was the whimsical boy just discovering magic, and the man who had seen war too young had taken his place. Draco wished he had been on the right side of that war if only so he could have protected Harry from what was happening. He hated to think that no one could have, Harry had to experience all of that, or the war might still be happening, and he would still be ruling. There would be so much wrong with the world, and Draco would have been changed already. Harry becoming an Animagus, finally willing himself to jump that last hurdle to get registered, it was the only way that Harry could keep himself sane. He was doing something. The boring life of a student did not do it for the great wizard use to solving mysteries. Draco found himself wondering sometimes if that was why Harry was still with him because he was something new to do, another project to work on, a mystery to solve.
It was a waiting game now, and Harry's mind was drawn to the uncomfortable position he was currently in. As tall as they both were, they had to stay close. Malfoy's earlier attempt at mutually assured sabotage left them at an odd angle. His arms were still wrapped around the Slytherin's waist. He could use this to make things both a bit less comfortable and a bit more comfortable. Taking a deep breath, he raised his hand again, muscles coiling in preparation. Using his grip, he pulled Malfoy flush to his chest, his hand slamming down across the blonde's mouth. It was then Harry realized he stood just a bit taller than Malfoy, and from here, he had an impressive view of those furious grey eyes. His hand slid along the others side a bit, flattening them both to the wall when the teachers moved. The sound kept Malfoy quiet, so Harry dropped his hand.
Harry gathered his cloak and waited for Malfoy to catch up, throwing it over them, they huddled together, no words spoke as they snuck through the still dark halls. First to the entrance to the dungeons, where Malfoy gave a curt nod and scurried out from under the robe behind a statue. Harry watched for a moment as Malfoy hurried down the hall, then down a flight of stairs, disappearing from sight.
Lunch ended quickly, and Harry and Draco parted, Harry out the front doors to visit Hagrid before class began, and Draco to head towards D.A.D.A. It was weird, being alone for the first time that day, he usually spent most of his days alone, trying to avoid everyone else. Most were still milling about in the castle, there was time before class, but Harry still loved to come down and visit Hagrid when he had the chance.
Harry nodded, stepping away, he focused on his body, changing the shape, willing taking on the form of his chosen animal. Purple eyes fixated on the boy turned wolf, jowls pulled back in a teasing growl like the child was laughing, the black creature skulked around, strands and weaves of russet fur making the pelt all the more enticing.
"He's gorgeous, you know." That cool, confident voice brought Harry back to the present and he turned his gaze to the very much closer Draco Malfoy.
He snuck a glance to Draco, who had gone back to being the one leading, keeping Harry from walking into a wall. His mind swirled with the possibilities that he just might be doing the wrong thing. If Draco wanted to.. Die.. before he changed, then who was Harry to make that decision for him? He wanted to be with Draco, did that not mean bending to the will of his partner from time to time, he should just love him, for the time he had left, besides, the year was only beginning, and Draco's spell would keep him in check until the summer. By then, there might be an answer to it all, maybe they could get the spell recast and work on finding a cure for the bite.
Draco was hesitant, but he knew that Harry was telling the truth, being sincere. "We will talk about this... I promise" with those words, he grabbed his bag and left the office. Harry waited until the statue settled down before walking over and taking the same seat Draco had been in. "Whatever this is about, please do not blame him every time I take off."
"And should I begin to shift, should I begin changing into the monster I fear. Will you, Harry Potter, use the killing curse to end my life while I am still a human being?"
"Not yet." The voice brought his attention quickly back to Harry, his lips pressing together in a scowl. He hated being the thing of contention between Harry and the one man who was still a father figure in his life. Hagrid had all but adopted Harry over their time at the school, and Draco, despite not being the biggest fan of the half-giant, had to admit that he was jealous of the loved shared.
"I..." He hesitated for a moment before steeling his resolve. "I have been considering..." He pointed to the book, going back to lazily flipping the pages.
His movements were swift, pushing himself up, he leaned over, pinning the male beneath him, the position precarious, even for him.
Leaning down, he nuzzled Harry's neck, shifting so he could slowly roll up his sleeve. Harry seemed enraptured by the movements, and Draco knew he was waiting to see the dark mark, but instead, fang marks lined his arm, forever sealed there as a scar. Harry's fingers ran over the marks and Draco began to speak in low tones.
"It's foolish" He replied, not wanting to be mocked for this, anything but this reason. A hand wrapped around his wrist, pulling him back down, so he was draped over Malfoy again. His lips by the others ear.
He was almost late, his eyes finding the clock at exactly 10 pm. He rushed from the dungeons, trying to push the pain down, knowing Harry would be waiting for him, and he was. Like a loyal fucking puppy, Harry was there, wagging his goddamn tail and throwing the cloak over them. Sneaking to the right spot was easy enough, the darkness shrouded them even further, though the cloak was the biggest asset to these nights. It was a brief moment, a sudden flood of sickening realization as Harry pulled off the cloak; this was not a good idea.
Despite this, he could barely bring himself to smile back. He made quick strides to the portrait hole and began the long trek to the classroom. His steps echoing around him, his fingers playing with the sleeve. He had warned Draco he would not be able to see him until the following morning, his own little secret was still being kept, a small notion that very few knew of, for there was no guarantee it would work out.
"And will you, to the best of your abilities and until the day I breathe my last breath, aid me in searching for the cure to this infliction?"
He saw the struggle, they had agreed to make this part specific, the method of death, the curse he must use, it ensured that Harry would always be prepared, that he would not fail.
The halls were empty, so finding a spot to hide was easy, though Draco would not call the lawn a place of hiding exactly. Collapsing under a tree, he tugged Harry into his lap, keeping his hands around the Gryffindors waist. He might have been forgiven for his actions in the tower, but they were not forgotten, not even close to being forgotten.
Harry had a hard time wrapping his mind around the kiss. Draco had quite the idea about fun, and he knew the Slytherin had done it for something interesting. From mysteries to war, each year had some new mystery to solve and Draco had been key to many of those, he had played a massive part in Harry's history, and now, the platinum blonde had made sure to solidly insert himself into his last years as much as he had the first 6, if not more so.
The air was thinner at this height, fresher yet harder to breathe, it lulled him, tamed the beast that grew restless beneath his breast. His mind was not so muddled when he came here, and he found he could sift through his thoughts, excogitate each one individually before stashing them away for later use or to be forgotten. His fingers slid into his pale villus and he laid back, one knee bent to brace himself against the tiles of the roof.
Harry squired, his hands releasing Draco and dropping down, was the wizard giving up so easily? Would he take Potter's life here? Would he do something that would end both of their misery? Something pushed against the flesh of his torso, and his instinct kicked in, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. The whispered spell made his eyes widen, but pride coursed through him at Harry's quick thinking and willingness to survive. Draco felt himself in free-fall, pushed across the towers and landing hard against the stone.
His thoughts did little for his attitude, for he had now given himself more to chew on than he wanted. It did provide a great distraction from the last classes of the day, the two he did not have with Harry, and the ones he would normally be struggling to stay awake in. This time, his brain had too much to mull over to even consider allowing him to sleep. Something deep in his gut told him that something big was going to happen tonight, and that made him want to talk Harry into not going outside like they had been doing every night.
"Since when is Malfoy a creature?!" he snapped, anger flaring through him, it was the first time he had gotten this mad at Hagrid. "Just because he was forced into becoming a Death Eater, does not make him less than the rest of us!"
He had refused to make that promise, he denied bending to Draco's wish. He would not kill the man just because he was shifting. Unconsciously, his hand tightened, he missed the look give to him by Draco, the Slytherin had been holding his hand all day, as if he feared to lose Harry should he let go.
"Well, good teh hear, got me worried, being around a creature like that." Hagrid did not seem to realize what he said until Harry's bag dropped to the floor.
"Harry, we have to get to class, when did you become such a rebel?" it was a joke, one that normally Harry might laugh as, but right now, he wanted to remain serious, for he had conditions. "What going on Harry.." Draco's voice seemed tense, he had finally felt the serious atmosphere and given into it.
"Fine, but I don't have that damned invisibility cloak, so we would have gotten caught, had the roles been reversed."
"I don't believe that. Maybe once upon a time, you might have. Not anymore, we've been through enough now to be beyond such childish pursuits."
"You should. Forgive him. You told me what he said, and honestly, he was not far off from the truth."
"Draco, I don't want to hear it. You may change your mind when and if you finally change, I'll prance along with you.." Harry was almost whining.
Mornings in the Slytherin common rooms were bitter as fuck. Draco snuffled and pushed his blankets right off the bed, a groan passed his lips and he collapsed back onto the mattress. He had not slept as well as he wanted to, his dreams invaded by Potter and this stupid book he had snuck out for him. He was annoyed, he wanted to know more about this Animagus process Potter had told him last night. Another muffled squeal of excitement reached his ears, observing the heavy wooden door between him and the sound, Draco wondered if there was a point in going out there or not. A draft of arctic air wafted off the cold stones and sent gooseflesh rising over his legs. A stifled moan of acceptance. The sound of his feet hitting the cold stone. A sudden yelp of surprise as he glared at the frigid, innocent-looking floor. Draco was hating his house more and more every day. They had the worst dorm if he believes the rumours about the others.
"Alright, the interview then?" the man murmured, moving to a seat and plopping down. "Right easy it is. Why'dya wanna become an animagus?" he was already writing and Harry looked down.
"I will feel just as awkward, but this is all your fault after all." Harry shook his head and watched as Draco shot him the darkest glare he could.
"I'm sorry" the words made Harry freeze, and he turned his gaze back to Draco, who was no longer focused on him, but on the owl, his fingers brushing through the feathers as if trying to win the creature over. "I was stupid. I told you there is a lot to talk about, but..." he sighed "..I guess I was trying to get you to give up on me, in a way."
"Harry, I can't be this, this thing. I need you to do it." He raised his blue eyes, knowing his next words would sting, but knowing that they needed to be said. "You swore on their names, Potter! You swore to the unbreakable vow!" he hated using Harry's last name, especially like that. He had no choice, Harry was being stubborn.
Finding an unused classroom, Harry yanked Draco inside, the door closing. Draco tried to speak, but right now, Harry wanted one thing, and one thing only. He pushed Draco against the wall, claiming his lips.
Leaves quivered in the breeze, his achromic hair hovering ever so slightly before sinking chaotically against his skull. Cinereal eyes watched the clouds, pale against the endless blue and orange, the faint twinkling of stars still clung stubbornly to the empyrean, reminding him of his own shimmering cosmic event. The boy who lived, the boy who had barged into his life, into his heart. Slowly, his world darkened as steel orbs fell hidden by long lashes, the palms of his ashen skin scraped against rough stone as he held himself up, merely enjoying the stillness of his hiding place. Here the roof was slanted just enough to send small tendrils of adrenaline shooting through his veins, just not slanted enough to send him skidding down over the edge.
"Come off it Draco-" Harry turned, straddling him and cupping his face "-It's not like I was being serious. What is serious is that I will be an animagus, I can shift, make sure you don't hurt anyone."
“Ah no reason in particular.” Harry smiled stiffly, “Pansy, are you still planning on staying over?”
“That I’m in love with Harry Potter and according to his friends he’s in love with me too.” Draco answered flatly, “Why do you think I would be bothered by the fact you kissed my father? We have all kissed our fair share of people. And aren’t you madly in love with Remus anyway?”
“I didn’t want to upset you?” Draco said cautiously, he had no idea where this conversation was going, “I know we don’t exactly have the best blood between us.”
The day had started off pretty simple, he had bought all the necessary foods and drinks for a party. But he didn’t keep in mind that Pansy and Blaise would probably also bring alcohol. And it didn’t help that Harry bloody Potter had purchased quite an array of Muggle alcoholic drinks for him to try. His apartment had enough alcohol to satiate a small town.
“It was good to have this meeting.” Draco said finally, “Feel free to contact me if you have more questions.”
“I’ll call you later!” Sirius yelled back, the man could still be heard muttering. Ineligible. And Draco couldn’t help but laugh. Anything to get over the fact that he and Harry had both confessed that they were in love with each other.
“Really Ron. Do you seriously want to get into a fight with me? The guy who fucking defeated Voldemort?” Harry queried, “Because I can knock you out.”
“I don’t mind at all.” Draco answered, noticing the camera that the brunet was carrying. The blond grew up with many photographs being taken of him and he was practically indifferent when someone asked to take a picture. He just didn’t understand how people were so insecure about their appearance. One should make the most out of the body they have. And there’s always room for improvement if one chooses it.
“I know that now. I feel like death and I'm sure feeling like death is a lot worse than feeling like shit.” Draco groaned, “You should have told me all of this before. This would have never happened.”
“That’s great.” Hermione smiled a knowing smile, Harry couldn’t help but feel worried at her little gesture. The witch surely knew a lot more than she was letting on, and Harry hoped that one day that she would be willing to share whatever was on her mind.
“Stop.” Lucius said firmly, “You guys are just repeating yourselves. Both your friend groups are aware that you’re dating. So instead of dwelling on that, the two of you should consider discussing your moving plans.”
“Then why did you buy a vacuum cleaner?” Harry groaned, “You seem to have everything under control without one.”
“I have an owl. Her name is Hedwig.” Harry laughed, watching as Draco looked around the house in fascination. It was always interesting to see how people would take the place in.“If you think I’m so lonely maybe you should take me up on my offer.”
Breakfast with Harry actually went surprisingly well. And Draco could not help but feel that under different circumstances, they probably could have been great friends. But that was not something that he wanted to dwell on, he knew that if he concentrated on what could have been, he would not be able to concentrate on the presence.
“Honey. I know that a fresh start is ideal, but you could have moved to another country like every other Voldemort supporter.” Pansy pointed out, “Things aren’t going to be so simple here. You’re going to have to get a job and-”
Draco looked at Harry to see if his partner would be okay with it. But Harry just gave him the go-ahead. Which seemed to make everything a lot easier than expected.
“A little bit late with the warning considering I just married the guy.” Draco snorted, watching as Harry made his way over to them, “Speak of the devil. Here comes my husband.”
“I’ll leave you two lovebirds alone. If you need me just yell.” Sirius said before pausing. He had a very calculated look before he started to speak again, “Actually. Don’t call for me. Goodnight my dears.”
“Oh.” Draco breathed, he was mortified. The blond really had no idea how anything worked. He probably should have researched everything before moving. The wizard had assumed that everything would be easy, “Er. So I’m going to need your help? I’m not entirely sure how these devices work.”
“Is he- magical?” he asked Draco, who let out a desperate, choked laugh and ran a hand through dishevelled hair.
“What the hell are you doing Malfoy, following me like this?” Harry growled while both of them stood up. Draco sent him a look full of indignation.
firmly in place. At last, the sun started to rise, and with the first rays shining into the room, Draco saw the same cloaked figure he had seen with Potter that night, standing right next to the door.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” said Draco in his idlest tone, leaning back against the bathtub and closing his eyes.
"Hm. I… Was I?" That wasn't on the document he signed. Draco chanced a peek at Potter's face and was confronted by blazing green eyes and a hard-set jaw. "P-Potter? You're wearing your war face. Could you stop?" he stammered, taking a step back.
“Right, because McGonagall will simply relish the thought of putting students in danger.” Hermione scoffed. “Besides, Hogwarts’ wards aren’t really all that great since the war.”
“Erm… I usually just get take-out.” Harry admitted, scratching the back of his neck. Draco scoffed at him.
It would seem the Savior was struggling with the concept. Potter's mouth was still hanging slightly open. Draco fought down a petty remark. Waited. Tapped his foot. Lost.
“Weren’t there vows of never sleeping at Malfoy Manor again and leaving me to starvation last night, Potter? Please, don’t break your word on my account.” Potter shuffled around, stuffing his hands in his pockets.
“Fuck,” he mumbled, grinning, and Draco found himself quite unexpectedly with two handfuls of Potter. They stumbled backwards until Draco’s back was pushed rather painfully against the library’s shelves, but he couldn’t bring himself to complain. Harry Potter was snogging him senseless.
"You can't pull shit like that, Malfoy!" Potter exclaimed, apparently running out of patience. "And who the fuck decides to hack down their house anyway?"
“No,” he repeated hotly. Ron tugged the baby from his arms, whispering something about ‘no squeezing my offspring to death.’
stupid cursive scrawl. (You might have at least changed the way you write “Potter”, it’s hardly changed since we were fourteen.)
"You!" Draco pointed a trembling finger at his nemesis. "You are a menace! You are the root of the expression: 'No good deed goes unpunished!'"
file a report about this,” he stated when the silence stretched for too long. Draco shrugged again. He was looking around too. The rain was really just a gentle drizzle by now, surprisingly enough. The freezing quality of the air, however, was still very much present.
Draco, who apparently had a firmer grasp of his senses than Harry did at that moment, tied the towel around his hips. Harry’s eyes followed helplessly back to the spot. Godric help him, he had just seen Draco’s-
! I could be hurt! Do you know how rude it is to…” the lecture lasted a good five minutes, which was just as well because Harry took about as long to get a hold of himself. In the end, he managed to stand up straight again and take in Draco’s appearance. The man was wearing a thoroughly disgruntled look that reminded Harry of Teddy’s face when bedtime arrived. He extended a hand to a weary Draco.
“Merlin save me from sappy Gryffindors.” Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes before going back to cooking.
As Draco searched for words, Weasley shot Potter a meaningful look. It was lost on the other if his confused expression was anything to go by.
“Stop sulking, Ron is just leaving Rosie with his mother and then he is coming too,” said Hermione, sitting next to Harry on the bed and rubbing her arms. “Why is it so cold in here?”
“Ow!” came a loud yelp, and Harry fell to the ground in a heap of twisted limbs. Startled, he let out a shock of red sparks from his wand, and whoever was entangled with him released another cry.
you are,” said Malfoy, giving the dog an exasperated grin. “Stupid mongrel, I should have left you to fend for yourself this morning.” he scratched the dog’s ears and turned towards a thunderstruck Harry “I’m ready.”
Harry took another automatic step back, just in time for dog-Potter – who was running towards his master with surprising speed – to smack into him and use the momentum to jump on top of a newly horror-struck Malfoy.
. They found their rhythm. And then they were both gasping, biting and kissing. Harry was moaning, rutting into Draco’s hand, and Draco himself had just a second to worry over his vision going completely white. It was over in an embarrassingly short time.
“You appear to have a rule of no cooking here, from what I gather, correct? Regardless, how many times do you find food lying around when you’re hungry?”
“Oh!” Hermione exclaimed, brightening up. “You mean Conway’s theory about way lines of dark magic serving as portals all over the world?”
“Ohh, is it making fun of Potter time?” Came a delighted voice from the door. Pansy was walking in with a mocking smile, Blaise following close behind. “Did you cover the glasses?”
The elf’s distress turned out to be about Draco, who was perched on top of the ballroom’s chandelier, swinging back and forth while twisting his wand in complicated patterns.
"Malfoy, come on,” he could hear the mirth in the voice of Prat Who Lived and threw one scathing look in his direction as he walked down a half-blocked hallway. "Where are you going?"
“Oh, so what. He started off by attacking me, what’s to say he didn’t just go back to his original target?”
“You woke up showing signs of blood loss. And you said you were dreaming of bleeding in the Forbidden Forest earlier.”
Which brings us back to that October evening. Draco had fallen into the habit of leaving the backdoor open. The dog would take a stroll around the neighbourhood, do his business somewhere far away from Malfoy’s sensibilities, and come back when it wanted to. Except for that night it didn’t. The world seemed to be trying to rain itself to an end, and it was bloody
“Grimmauld Place.” sighed Hermione, and Harry’s face took the mulish appearance they were all familiar with.
“Nothing,” the other replied, dropping his hands and still looking flustered. “I’m really sorry. I don’t usually… I just…”
It was established, after a mix of spells and research in muggle books, that the dog was a Bernese Mountain. He was large, and when cleaned up, showed a beautiful black coat, with a white chest and specks on brown here and there. It had no magical abilities, other than apparently being invulnerable to thirst, and had a gentle disposition. He appeared content to be sprawling on the floor of Draco’s study while the wizard performed complicated spells over cursed objects.
“Not even a scratch. Seemed like the kind of nonsense you would pull every year.” he continued, distractedly rubbing behind the dog’s ears. Then he smirked. “Of course, yelling: ‘Potter, stop shitting on the neighbour’s garden!’, entertains me to no end.”
the peacocks!" Draco yelled happily, promptly losing his balance and letting the axe drop. It got stuck on one of the beans and he grunted, trying to pull it free. "I'll roast them in my big Manor bonfire."
I need to give credit here to my amazing beta, WtheB (got the reference?), who puts up with my nonsense and encourages me to write faster hahaha
“Really?” He drawled. Smirked. “Well in that case I can’t really hold it against you, Potter. I am quite dashing after all.”
It is really a shame that a time turner cannot be found nowadays for love nor money, for I would truly relish going back to my sixteen-year-old self and telling him:
They sat side by side, not interacting, and after a couple of minutes, Harry noticed that he was rapidly bleeding into the forest’s ground. He checked himself for wounds, distantly curious, but found nothing out of place. Nothing hurt. His blood was just leaving his body out of its own volition.
And even now, as I’m lying next to you (my husband! You’re my husband, Malfoy-Potter, how does that feel?) I can’t help but smile. You’re everything I’ve ever wanted. You’re everything I will ever want, and I can’t wait to start this new journey of our lives toge—
Another time, he hadn’t even managed to take his auror’s robes off before Kreacher grabbed his hands and dragged him off, sobbing: ‘Master needs to save the other Master! He is falling to his death, he is!’
“Those conditions are acceptable,” Draco said slowly, rubbing his hand against his left arm. Harry (and probably Hermione too), pretended not to notice this nervous tell. “We would need to go to my house and get some of my things.”
in here, it’s fine. It’s… home.” Harry finished uncertainly when everyone in the bedroom looked at him like he was dim-witted. “Whatever.” He grumbled, crossing his arms.
"No," Potter rubbed the back of his neck. He was back to frowning at the hearth. "But now the Ministry is the new prejudiced bastard pushing people around. I'm fucking tired of bullies."
“What do you mean, my room is full of dark magic?” asked Harry, a bit indignant. “I hired professionals to clean up Grimmauld place after the war.”
"Just don't ask for my dad's help, eh?" he said, casually stealing a piece of cake from Potter's plate. (They'd taken that tea break after all). "You've seen the Burrow."
“You want me to live with Potter?” Draco looked as sickened by this prospect as Harry. “Surely there’s somewhere else in the whole of Britain that I could go to.”
“This fucking dog!” Draco hollered, madly kicking his feet in order to sit up. And then, shoving the animal, who was licking his face:
“You mean: ‘Thank you so much, Harry, for juggling this bullshit around like a circus monkey.’” Harry said, scowling. Draco gave a startled laugh and Harry caught a glimpse of a real smile on his face for a surprising second. Harry felt the tight ball of unease on his chest slowly unravel.
"Sure,” Potter had the gall to grin at him. He picked up the baskets Ron had set on the floor. "You can throw me in that Manor bonfire. Kitchen?"
“We had a somewhat distressing morning, that’s all,” Draco said in a lofty tone. And when Blaise raised an eyebrow: “Desist, Zabini! There is nothing between me and Potter!”
McGonagall followed, stern robes somehow still pristine even in the heat of midday. She gave them both a severe look. Using the excuse of clearing out the debris in the drawing room, Draco and Potter had been just shoving each other around instead. As was evidently clear to the teacher.
Draco Malfoy was the human equivalent of chaos, Harry concluded within five minutes of their arrival home. Five minutes was all the time it took for Harry’s attempt to show Draco around Grimmauld Place derail into Draco running in and out of various rooms and stopping in front of Harry, frankly distressed, asking things like:
“I dreamed I was bleeding,” said Harry, frowning, sinking further into the pillows as he spoke. He had to acknowledge the fact that he couldn’t really support his own head up, however humiliating that was. He was just so
joined the commotion and Harry helplessly tugged at his hair, wondering how a man was supposed to deal with this when he hadn’t even had his first cup of tea.
“We’re eating here?” he asked, rather dumbly, and received an impatient glance from Draco for his efforts.
“Fuck-” Draco yelped when dog-Potter jumped on the bed, jolting them. The animal was still whining. Before either of them could do anything, Potter licked both of Harry’s forearms.
Potter looked down at his crotch. He opened and closed his mouth in mortified astonishment for a few seconds, taking in his very happy privates.
"I needed the kindling," said Draco airily, wrinkling his nose in distaste when he saw his dusting efforts were only spreading more wall plaster all over himself. Potter gaped at him.
all the evidence!” Draco finished happily, and with a flourish, the image of the muggle house drawn in the air disappeared. Ron had his chin in one hand, grunting as he thought about the plan.
thank you so much for going on this little journey with us! we had a brilliant time, and getting to know the person behind the letters was even more exciting!
Harry half froze when a grim shape materialized not a hundred meters away, blocking one side of the backstreet. He was huge and emanated cold menace even with his face completely hidden under the hood. Harry watched spellbound as a ghostly pale hand slowly reached behind the cloak. The streetlamp next to the alley entrance flickered and went out. Harry snapped out of his trance.
"Excuse me Potter, I'm the victim here. Apparently, the Ministry is trying to sleep deprive Death Eaters to their early grave."
It soon became apparent to Draco that while Potter yelling at people had the power to make the bureaucratic wheel spin that much faster, no amount of yelling at
“I know you’re not. But still.” Hermione relented, squeezing Harry’s hand. She switched baby Rose from one hip to another. Harry had interrupted her morning feed, and the little girl was none too pleased. Ron was now frantically preparing her another bottle over Harry’s desk while Draco observed, nose slightly wrinkled in distaste. “So, let’s go over this again. You were both being followed by an unknown person wearing a long black cape with a hood.”
“Oh.” Harry turned and stuck his head out of his office, suggesting emphatically to the other young Auror that he should go for a coffee break. He closed the door, warded it, and asked in a concerned tone:
“Er… your house. I mean, the both of you.” Harry stammered, growing uncertain the more incredulous Draco looked. “Because you live together. Because you’re getting married… Right?”
“Er…” Harry shuffled next to the door, not sure about what to say. Draco rolled his eyes at him and continued packing.
Weasley, who was distractedly trying to scratch his nose in the handle of one of the baskets, started to snicker.
“You were a pain in the arse, mate.” Draco spluttered, apparently appalled at being referred to as Weasley’s
Harry fire-called his friends. His obstinate, idiotic friends, that were now risking their offspring just to help him.
Draco took petty delight in transfiguring the lumpiest, most uncomfortable armchair he could get his hands on into a bed for Potter. They had agreed, after much back and forth, that it was probably safest to stay in the library, as it was the furthest away from the disaster area.
, if we are standing right there when it happens and already have the magical signature of the criminal.” Harry corrected, still talking in soothing tones completely at odds with the discussion. “That guy was not that close to us, and how would he have our signatures?”
“Master Harry will not be putting the House of Black in scandal when we are having guests.” Kreacher continued determinedly, throwing Harry a dirty look before disappearing. Harry gaped after the elf’s back and then snuck a look at Draco. The man was in the process of hiding a smirk behind his glass.
He trailed off, taking in for the first time Draco’s white sweater hanging wetly from his skinny frame. Looking up, he found angry grey eyes flashing dangerously.
A rushing sound of nails scratching wood floors was heard, and suddenly a huge dog was jumping on Malfoy, yapping cheerfully and slobbering over everything.
Draco made a show of looking around himself. Malfoy Manor was deadly silent. No house elf wanted to step even one foot inside the place after the war. Draco didn't blame them.
"You were supposed to have access to your personal vault," his voice was harsh and at his sides, his hands were closed in tight fists.
They made good on their agreement. For the next two years, Draco and Harry avoided each other with unrelenting commitment, going as far as faking illnesses and hiding in dusty storerooms just to not say hello on the Ministry’s corridors.
"P-Potter?" his sheets tangled around his legs when he made to get out of the bed. The library was in disquieting darkness, and all Draco could see was an unfocused shape twisting next to him. "Shit. Potter! Wake the hell up!"
The cavalry, as it were, consisted of one Hermione Granger. She came in talking a million words per minute, hair messily done up in a bun and for all purposes having acquired mastery in magical construction theory over the last 12 hours.
calming breath. His Mind Healer kept pointing out he had quite the melodramatic streak. He was fairly certain that the self-satisfied imbecile would count arson as an overreaction. It was an absurd and completely unfair accusation, and the more Draco contemplated the issue, the more radically, pyromaniacally prone,
"Why the fuck are you so concerned about the fair treatment of a Death Eater?" Draco finally managed to choke out. "I tortured innocent people, you do know that, right?"
“Yes. Ronald and I…” he made a face at Ron, who was slowly shuffling away from Draco, looking guiltily at his friends. “Fine,
Draco woke to a blood-curdling scream, heart racing. For a moment, he was thrown back into Voldemort times in the Manor, and it took him a few seconds to re-orientate himself.
“- We went outside,” continued Draco, “and he came straight to your door. Then…the house went crazy too. Lights going on and off. The walls were shaking. I came into your room, and Kreacher was here.”
He looked up when he heard a noise outside the door and gripped his wand. But it was just Potter. The man strode in a bit out of breath and looked half asleep, half annoyed. Draco felt himself finally relaxing. Even if Potter was wearing ripped jeans and a ratty t-shirt inside out and generally didn’t look exactly fit to fight off anything.
Draco made a helpless gesture with his shoulders, surveying the room with suspicion. Remnants from his disturbed air from earlier could still be glimpsed behind Draco’s aristocratic features, and Harry felt his heart give a pang. Both Ron and Hermione were regarding Draco with horrified expressions.
“So how come your secretary seemed ready to faint when I wanted to shrink all your stuff? You shrank that clock yesterday.”
“I ought to arrest you anyway.” Draco extended his wrists in Harry’s direction, one blond eyebrow raised in defiance.
Draco opened his eyes to gentle sunlight streaming through the library windows. He sighed in contentment, watching the flecks of dust lazily playing in the light. He was warm and cosy and…
He came back at the end of the day to alarming noises coming from the kitchen. The dog was napping in the hallway, almost completely camouflaged in the dim light. He thumped his tail on the floor in silent greeting and closed his eyes again, not even stirring when a loud crash came from behind the door. With all the weariness he would normally save for entering a vicious ringleader hide-out, Harry poked his head around the door to evaluate the situation.
“But you see, that wouldn’t work, because the neighbors-” Ron unexpectedly gulped and straightened up. Draco looked in the same direction and found Harry and Hermione staring incredulously at the both of them.
“Oh. Right.” Harry said, feeling his amusement fade. He had – very productively – spent his working hours combing through all the Prophet’s mentions of the Malfoys in the last years. Ron had taken one look at him bent over dusty issues in the Ministry’s archive and bailed, muttering to himself something that sounded a lot like
Draco was standing in the middle of the room, sleeves rolled up, charming pans and ingredients into… something. Kreacher was running in circles around him, crying that he could help. Harry must have made some sort of noise because Draco suddenly raised his eyes to him.
“Did you kill somebody, do you mean?” Harry gritted out, still glaring at the same spot on the ground as if it would spill some answers if only Harry conjured up enough indignation.
“Oh Harry,” she sent him a sympathetic look “I just thought it was too much at the time. We were all dealing with the aftermath of the war. Ron, you were in no state to talk at all until July. And Harry, you know how you get when we talk about Draco.”
Harry started walking down the path that would ultimately lead him to the place he’d died. He reached the clearing, the mist slowly dissolving all around him. To his surprise, there was someone waiting for him there. At first, he thought it was Sirius Animagus’ form, and smiled, even with his heart aching, thinking that it would be good to at least see his godfather for a bit.
"To the whole of them, yes. You should have had access to your personal one from the start. Apparently, there has been a… mistake in the paperwork. I fixed it"
A distressed Potter was tossing and turning. Draco rolled his eyes and this time started by putting Potter's wand out of his reach.
“Alright darling, but I expect a very thorough explanation,” Astoria said, picking up a purse Harry just now noticed was hanging in a hook next to the door, and kissing Draco on the cheek. “Very thorough.” She stressed. And with a polite nod to Harry and soft pop, she was gone.
I have to admit, when you’re not being the sarcastic git you are, you’re actually quite funny. You’re going to say something like,
“I won’t say you used an Unforgivable.” Harry continued, grudgingly. He was shivering lightly too, Draco was pleased to notice.
More piteous noises. Oh, this was preposterous. Where the sodding hell was his wand? As if Draco didn't have enough on his hands dealing with his own nightmares.
“I can’t hear you,” Draco shouted obnoxiously while forking a piece of pie. Harry flopped to his own bed and crossed his arms. They fell into silence. Draco figured it was only gracious of him to give Harr-
“I spent three months redecorating this place!” Harry exclaimed, indignant, and received a mocking look for his troubles.
“Nothing!” Harry exclaimed, putting his hands up. “Nothing, honest. Yes, she can send you whatever you like, it’s… fine.” He finished the sentence with a wince. Draco studied him, shoulders very straight and tense. The easy mood they’d been sharing vanished.
PS: For all your claims of hating my “metal monstrosity”, I didn’t quite see you complaining last night when I fucked you on it.
“We didn’t fight in a war just so you stupid boys could die from a candle attack,” she’d said firmly.
They eventually reached Harry’s bed. A lot of fumbling with belts and muffled curses followed their tumbling over the lumpy mattress, but at some point Harry found his bearings and gripped Draco
you could get Draco’s assignments from his department and give them to him. He would never miss work while we sort this out.”
“Riveting,” sniffed Draco dismissively. He stepped closer to the table, eyeing a piece of pie with interest. “Where are your better halves?”
Do you want to meet up, grab a coffee, or some brunch somewhere? We can then discuss the negotiations for the photos. In the sunlight. With no chance of either of us getting distracted. At all.
“Whatever Malfoy, as if you never-” Harry started, feeling very inclined to begin another row, when Draco’s hand closed around his wrist.
“Very well. Potter woke me up,” Draco said, voice low. “He was going crazy, barking, scratching the door-”
"You were rubbing your Saviour plonker between my unaware arse cheeks Potter, that's what I'm on about!"
“Prat.” He grumbled to himself before marching off into the night, leaving Draco to stand alone under the elements. Which he did, because this whole business with Harry seemed so surreal that he needed a moment - or five - to put his thoughts in order.
He eventually came back downstairs, miffed about his urge to hide inside the bedroom for the rest of the evening. He found Draco calmly sipping wine in the dining room. The table was already set, a nice spread of food on top of it, and Harry had to admit that whatever it was Draco had prepared certainly smelled good.
"Out of my house!" Draco yowled, all righteous anger and burning ears. "All of you, that's quite enough! Out!"
The house was quiet when he slipped inside and closed the front door. Harry decided he’d earned the right to a proper bath today, instead of his usual quick showers. Mildly appeased by the prospect of regaining feeling in his toes, he took the stairs two at a time and barged into the bathroom next to his bedroom.
Life went on. Ginny moved out of Grimmauld Place. Harry went on a cleaning and redecoration rampage, getting rid of all the unpleasant memories he had in that house. Christmas that year was a study in awkward silences. Easter actually had Ginny pelting chocolates at Harry, and Harry getting so mad that he had his first case of accidental magic in years. The situation reached calamitous levels; Molly had to intervene. Ron was grounded, Hermione ranted quite a lot and Percy ended up with blue hair for three days. Nevertheless, it would still be another six months until Ginny and Harry could stand to be in the same room without further catastrophe.
Harry huffed, disgruntled, and cast some diagnostic spells. There wasn’t even a trace of dark magic around them. After
He nearly jumped out of his skin when something heavy bumped against his leg. Draco spun around quickly, only to find his daft dog staring back at him. He looked as soggy and miserable as Draco felt, and was covered in mud. Draco sighed.
“Mate, you even have wards against ghosts!” Ron tried to reason when it looked like Harry might explode right then and there. “
"Zabini, I swear to Salazar-" BOOM. Another bean caved. Somewhere down to Pansy's left, Draco could be heard cackling.
“Don’t call our daughter a demon.” Hermione admonished, but one corner of her lips went up. She sat down next to Draco. “Back to the point. You ran and tried a variety of spells.”
. At 8 o’clock, Draco gave up all pretence of his indifference and went in search of the vexing animal.
“I’m sorry! It’s just the whole ‘man in the cape’ part. I keep expecting to hear he showed them his bits!” Hermione still looked disapproving, but Harry and Ron shared an amused glance.
It also chewed Draco’s dragonhide boots whenever it had a chance, and then proceeded to barf the remains of said footwear into one of the irreplaceable vases that adorned the hallway. Malfoys weren’t supposed to shout, his father had always said. Shouting was for commoners. Draco found that he shouted quite a lot that week.
“Is he gone?” Draco gasped, hands on his knees. They were in some other part of London, on a broad street full of warehouses. Harry was frantically looking in all directions.
“Back at the Burrow. Hermione is staying there for now, until she fixes her parent’s memories.” Draco made a noncommittal noise and took a plate to his bed. Harr-
That particular conversation made Harry pleased, for reasons he couldn’t begin to fathom. He went to sleep in a good mood, belly full of delicious food, and feeling optimistic about their Saturday plans.
Pansy picked her way carefully around the semi destroyed rooftop, testing each bean before stepping on it. The loud crack of an axe hitting the wood made her jump. She could hear the few remaining peacocks in the garden screech in outrage.
’” That set him off the deep end, and they grappled for dominance, Harry still laughing, Draco still ranting, until they both ended up sprawled on the floor.
, who, as usual, dragged me down in his mess.” Draco drawled from his seat near a fake window. It was showing cloudy, ominous skies that surmised his mood exactly right.
“Tell Blaise that it’s my choice to make.” Ginny smiled, “And I don’t care about his name or status. If he’s a good guy, I am more than willing to give him a chance.”
“He's not a pure-blood wizard.” Draco pointed out, “And were you not interested in the whole dark lord thing?”
“I don’t know. I just thought that you would try to date a Muggle while living here.” Harry commented, “I’m sorry for assuming.”
“Don’t worry he’ll be okay.” Narcissa promised, “He has a strong pulse, and it appears that you’ve managed to close most of the wounds. But I still think we should take him to St Mungo’s. Just to make sure that he’s okay and gets the treatment he needs.”
“Because this is gold.” Ron grinned, “The two of you love each other and it took the both of you over a year to figure it out.”
“I’ll make sure of it.” Draco said, pointedly looking at Harry, “He should have gone to you to begin with.”
They had been together for a few years now and in all honesty, it still shocked Draco that they had managed to last this long. This was the longest relationship he had ever been in and he kind of worried if it was approaching its bitter end. It scared him because he didn’t see how his life would be without Harry.
“I didn’t know that we were sharing dreams. Not until I saw how you reacted to me.” Draco answered, moving his face away from Harry’s hand. Maybe the feelings were too overwhelming to him? But Harry felt like he could bask in it. It was the most exhilarated he had felt in years, “Maybe if you weren’t so easy to read, we wouldn’t be having this conversation to begin with.”
When he apparated into the apartment everything was clean and Blaise and Pansy were currently resting on an air mattress that took Harry forever to find. He didn't understand why it was so hard to source an air mattress, it was like no one used them anymore. And now that he was definite that Pansy and Blaise were fine and didn’t choke on their own sick, he now needed to make sure that Draco was also okay.
“Sirius. We can all hear you having an existential crisis.” Draco yelled after him, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“Of course.” Draco smiled, he felt like he was going to cry. For the first time in his life, he believed in soulmates, “I’ll spend the rest of my life with you.”
“Do what mate?” Ron frowned, the redhead was a little lost in the conversation, “It’d be nice if someone filled me in on what’s going on.”
“Fuck off! It’s our wedding.” Draco grinned, giving Ron the bird. Harry just continued to laugh, “If we really want to, we can fuck on the damn floor.”
“Thank you.” Draco smiled, “I know I don’t deserve your help. But I really appreciate you doing it anyway. Living as a Muggle isn’t actually as easy as I thought it was.”
“Yes. It does.” Draco agreed, drumming his fingers on the arm of the chair. There seemed to be a lot on the blond’s mind. But Harry wasn’t sure how to bring it forward without making Draco feel like Harry was forcing himself into his life. Harry had already done enough as it was, “Well. I should probably get going.”
“Weren’t you the ones who offered to help?” Draco snorted, “Well, I’m going to unpack everything and settle in. So I guess I’ll see you guys later.”
“Okay.” Harry frowned, walking over to the toaster, before finally taking notice of the smoke and smell wafting off the toaster, “Oh bloody hell! It’s burning!”
The meal was great. Harry didn’t actually think that Draco would be able to handle the spiciness of the food and was actually hoping to see the blond turn red. But as usual, Draco managed to surprise him. He enjoyed his food and was surprisingly nice to everyone in the restaurant. It was weird to think there was a time that Harry thought that Draco didn’t know the concept of being nice. But he was glad to be proved wrong. The brunet couldn’t wait to see how Draco would surprise him next.
“Harry… Do you not talk about sex with your friends?” Draco asked, “Because I know every single detail about Pansy and Blaise’s sex lives. Everything.”
Draco frowned as he opened the door to his apartment. He had looked through the peephole and saw a familiar bushy haired girl, but there was a hope that his mind was just playing tricks on him.
“No. I unboxed mostly everything.” Draco responded, before pointing at the kettle, “I need help on working that contraption.”
“Harry. I don’t care about the house being messy.” Draco insisted, “I’m in love with you. I understand that things can be hard, but that’s why I’m here. We’re going to help each other.”
“I’d like that very much.” Draco smiled, “Hermione, I really do wish I wasn’t so ignorant. I’m sure we could have been great friends.”
“Jesus Christ on a bike. Are you barmy? How on earth are you so offended by the fact that Draco Malfoy probably doesn’t like you.” Ron groaned, “I mean you’re an okay looking guy, but you don’t really have any redeeming qualities that would make you a catch. If Draco were to ever date you, it’d probably be because he wants the fame again. Why else do you think your relationship with Ginny didn’t last?”
“I’m confused.” Harry frowned, as soon as Sirius apparated out of the apartment. And Draco had to agree with Harry, it seemed like everyone seemed to know something that the both of them weren’t aware of. It was kind of annoying.
He sighed, eventually relenting and deciding that he should definitely call Harry Potter. Just to have a rundown of how things actually functioned. He dialled the number on the paper and listened to the dial tune before there was a distinct sound indicating that someone had picked up.
Harry stared at the kitten in his arms and he had to admit that she was kind of cute. She let out a little mewl and curled closer into his chest, “What are we going to name her?”
“I hope they’re suffering.” Draco said, startling another laugh out of Harry. The blond was ruthless.
“Wait. He hasn’t done anything?” Harry wondered, “Like he hasn’t done anything bad? No tantrums? No messes?”
Draco let out an embarrassingly loud sound, he wasn’t sure what it was. But the blond sunk his face down into his hands to hide. He knew he was bright red and he didn’t want his parents to see him like this.
“You know I’ll always be here for you. If you ever feel like you want to talk about it.” Draco smiled sadly, giving the older wizard’s shoulder a reassuring squeeze, “Haven’t you suffered long enough. Silence and solitude are never good. Let’s arrange for a day to have tea.”
“Okay. I’ll leave you to it.” Sirius sighed, “I also have to tell you guys that it will take quite some time to christen all the rooms in this house. Who knows you might end up hating sex in the end.”
“Er. Hi?” Draco offered, trying to get his features to settle. He was sure he had the appearance of a deer caught in headlights.
Candles floated around them, offering up only just enough light to make out each other's faces. The windows had been closed, mother sat behind, her hands twisting around, he could hear her soft sniffles, hear the press of fabric as the mudblo- Hermione offered what she could for comfort. Reaching out, he grasped Harry's forearm, the movement made everyone jump, but Harry simply smiled, grasping his arm in return before his face became stoic, focused.
Checking the time, he set off out of the room. The moment he walked into the primary common room, a hushed silence fell over the students, he could feel the scrutiny as he headed for the portrait. "Draco?" it was a small blonde he had known the year before, her large hazel eyes inspected him, as she tilted her head "There is still half an hour before breakfast is served, want to sit down?" she made it sound so easy. He knew that it wasn't and shook his head "I have to deliver something to the owlery, maybe another time." turning he left without another word.
Instead, he found himself in the library, trying to work on homework for Potions, the newest professor would never amount to what Snape had proved to be, and Harry felt like he was learning nothing this time around. He gave up, deciding to head to McGonagall's office early. The moment he arrived, she seemed to find great relief.
Harry's confusion grew, why was Draco always so foolhardy. A small smile crossed his lips, and he reached out, cupping the other's cheek, his thumb caressing the flesh. Leaning in, he captured the male's lips with his own, Mortimer seemingly mortified by the experience made a fuss on his shoulder.
"Where are you going?" Draco glanced back, Harry smiled and sighed "Headmistresses office." No sooner had he spoken the words, than was he pulled along. Dragged through the halls, and all he could do was smile and laugh, his previous petulance long forgotten and faded, all in favor of a simple realization.
"It's fine, Draco, I know what tonight is, I know it makes you irritable and concerned." Harry grinned and Draco marvelled again at how he seemed to keep it together, even after everything that happened in their lives, he still kept it together. Draco constantly wanted to punch something or someone over the smallest comment. He was a short fuse, and Harry seemed to be the only thing that stopped him from blowing up and ending up expelled.
“Now I can understand why she beat you.” Lucius smiled, earning a shocked look from Draco. His father was actually complimenting Hermione, and that was shocking, “You’re both equally as smart, but now I understand.”
“I thought that you were aware of this.” Draco frowned, “She was the one that gave me the books to read.”
“I- I actually don’t.” Draco frowned, this was ridiculously embarrassing. If Draco could crawl into a hole and disappear, he would. Anything to not have to deal with this embarrassment, “But there is this place just around the corner. I’ll pay.”
It was hell. That was the only way Harry could describe it. He wasn’t entirely sure what they were talking about, he didn’t really care in all honesty. He couldn’t help but watch Draco, every little thing that the blond did was driving him crazy. It wasn’t fair. He was so close to the guy that had plagued his dreams for as long as he could remember and he still wasn’t given the opportunity to touch him. Just a handshake. Anything to show Harry that this was actually happening.
“Okay. But after you’re done taking pictures of me, I expect you to buy me a drink.” Draco stated firmly, getting set up. He wasn’t going to let the photographer get away from him.
I currently have labyrinthitis. It seriously sounds like something out of a movie, so I was surprised when my doctor diagnosed me with it.
“Sirius? Why would it have anything to do with him?” Remus questioned, “I haven’t actually been able to get a hold of him recently.”
“Fine.” Draco agreed reluctantly, “But if there are any changes, I want you to call for me. Straight away.”
“I’d like that.” Draco smiled, “But Ron, I have to say that I really am sorry for everything. I take back everything I said about you and your family. It was really degrading and not forgivable.”
“So when were you planning on telling me what was going on?” Harry asked. Draco was currently rearranging some things in his room so the question caught him off guard, “Did you seriously think I wouldn’t notice that there was something going on with Sirius?”
“There’s only one way to find out.” Harry grinned, before calling Draco’s parents into the room, “I want Draco to move into my house.”
“Who knows what goes through his head.” Draco chuckled awkwardly, Harry gave him a look that suggested that he knew that the laugh was forced, “Anyway. Are you going to tell me why you got Andy fired?”
“You know there’s nothing to be ashamed of, right?” Harry commented, “We can go get some food at the place you mentioned. But you can’t always eat out. So I’ll show you how to cook some simple meals.”
“We would like that very much.” Narcissa smiled, standing up and making her way to Draco. She kissed his cheek, before pulling him into a hug, “And Harry, you need to come to our house for dinner sometime too.”
“If you don’t shut up, I’m going to kick you out of the house.” Draco groaned. He was going to take a leap of faith. If he and Harry were meant to be, Draco would probably end up flying instead of falling, “We’re going to have to tell everyone that the courting has been accepted.”
In all the years that he knew her, Pansy Parkinson was strong. He had never seen her cry once during their years in Hogwarts. But now here she was, standing in front of him with streaks of mascara running down her cheeks. The witch was a mess.
“What kind of food did you bring?” Lucius asked, changing the subject, seemingly unfazed by the fact that Harry was a regular visitor, “I hope you don’t mind if we try some?”
“You can always move in with me.” Harry offered. Draco had a feeling that his face was probably doing something weird because Harry looked like he was about to laugh, “Come on. It’s not that surprising. We’re practically living with each other already. We might as well make it official.”
“They seem to think that we’re partners.” Draco answered flatly, “That you’re taking care of me because you like me.”
“Ah. So does everything electrical work like that?” Draco questioned. He hated himself for having to resort to having to actually call Harry to help him. The blond looked at the clock and realised that it was only eight, “I’m sorry for calling you so early. Do you want some breakfast?”
“Don’t worry. Let me put that on your bedside table. You might get a little peckish later on.” Harry voiced, “I’ve got a house-elf to just make sure that you guys don’t choke on your own puke and end up dying. But I’ll be back in the morning to check up on you.”
“Catherine.” Sirius joked. It wasn’t that creative of a name, but it kind of worked. But if Sirius was going to suggest naming the cat ‘Cat’, Harry wasn’t entirely sure how he would handle it. Sirius and his puns could drive anyone mad, “Then you can just call her Cat.”
“I think you’ve got the wrong message here, mate.” Harry cut in, he had been watching from the side. Just to see what would happen. But this Andy guy was seriously pissing him off, “You should back off.”
“How? You’ve only been together for a month.” Draco pointed out. The blond didn’t want to turn around and see how Harry was taking in the news because the wizard wasn’t even aware of the fact that Blaise and Ginny were dating in the first place. Her being pregnant was going to be a shock, “Isn’t it a little early to start a family together?”
Luckily being Harry Potter meant that he would literally be welcome everywhere. He hated it when he was younger, but as an adult, he realised life was a little better when you were given special treatment.
“No. I’m not going to stop with the teasing.” Draco said flatly, “You were relentless when I first started bringing Harry around so I think it’s only fair that you deal with the same treatment.”
“Then why are you so antsy?” Sirius asked, “Oh. You figured it ALL out. Not just that part, but the other part too?”
“Stay here as long as you need to.” Lucius said, “But I have to insist on having some potions on hand, in case of an emergency. So I’m leaving a few here.”
“Of course I’m being Sirius. Don’t wear out my name baby cousin.” Sirius laughed, “But yes, I was only joking. Maybe I’ll kiss and tell if you tell me who has been plaguing your dreams at night.”
“We get it.” Hermione sighed, “If this job is taking a toll on you, maybe you should consider getting a new one.”
“I’m okay Tipsy, can you please notify my parents that I have arrived?” Draco asked, looking around the manor. It didn’t different to what he remembered. His mother would occasionally change the blinds and decorations to fit the more seasonal times. The tell-tale sign of his father walking to greet him snapped Draco’s attention to the other wizard. He didn’t look much older, but wizards didn’t really age greatly so it wasn’t that much of a surprise, “Father. How do you do?”
“Please kill me,” Draco said to himself, he felt bloody awful and he had no idea where everyone else was. Well. At least he now knew to never mix different alcohols. Draco was usually a wine drinker. But that didn't change the fact that he had never felt this bad in his entire life from consuming wine.
“Harry? Really?” Draco smiled knowingly, he didn’t know that Harry was helping his parents or others integrate back into their previous roles and lives. Draco couldn’t help but feel proud. Proud that they were friends.
“I always had the feeling you had an invisibility cloak.” Draco stated, before removing the fabric from his face, “So Weasley seems to have this idea that I’m too good for you?”
“Are you being serious right now?” Sirius snorted, earning an incredulous look from Draco, "Oh for Merlin's sake. You really are serious."
“I can explain! I’ve been really busy recently and I haven’t had the time to clean up.” Harry groaned. He cut Draco off without knowing what the blond was going to say. If Draco was a better person, he would have probably stopped Harry from saying anything that would make a fool of himself, but Draco loved him. And he wanted to know what the other wizard wanted to say, “I wanted it to be spotless before you came. But with the accident and the paperwork, I hadn’t had the chance to come back here.”
“Oh, dear Merlin.” Sirius guffawed, “You don’t even know what you’re doing. You know what. Just forget it. I’m sure I’ll be able to stay at Remus’ place tonight.”
It had been a couple weeks of fooling around and dating that made Harry realise that he was absolutely smitten with Draco. From stolen kisses under bright headlights in Muggle London and intimate touches when no one was looking seemed to put an ease on their relationship. They could finally act like two normal people without having to worry that people were following their every move. But as usual, there was something or someone out there that took stalking Harry to the next level and there were already numerous amounts of articles written about Harry’s secret lover, whose face wasn’t visible in any of the pictures. All they knew was that they were blonde and were unsure of whether or not Draco was a woman, man, wizard, or witch. It was quite comical. If they ignored the fact that there was a slight chance that someone would eventually figure it out.
“I will.” Harry smiled, watching as Remus apparated out of the house, “Merlin, Draco. I didn’t even have to say anything. I wasn’t expecting it to be that easy.”
“No. Definitely not.” Draco snorted, looking around Harry’s house. It was a family home and most people often asked Harry if ever felt lonely, but he didn’t care that much for people. He preferred to have a space to himself, “Maybe you should consider getting a pet.”
Harry sighed in relief and turned to check on Draco. The blond’s arm was resting his arm on his waist.
“Of course.” Severus agreed, his eyes were on Sirius. And Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Severus knew that there was something going on with Sirius, “We have a lot to discuss.”
“You don’t mind if a take a few shots do you?” A voice queried, Draco’s eyes met absinthe and he knew straight away that Harry Potter had somehow stumbled upon Draco without the blond even attempting to make an effort to gain his attention. Maybe he was going to get more out of this performance than what he originally expected.
“Don’t pull that bullshit on me.” Draco snorted, “Tell me the real reason why you’re not going to even try.”
“Why would they be taking the piss out of you? If anything they should be taking the piss out of me.” Harry wondered, “Is there something that you’re not telling me?”
The tell-tale sign of someone apparating into the house cut the conversation short. It was a very fitting end to the talk. But it didn’t feel right, because Sirius deserved a chance at love too. And Draco wanted him to know that.
“Well, Blaise thought it looked interesting and thought it was something that was used on hair.” Draco responded, “The poor guy almost had a heart attack when his hair started to get sucked up.”
“Why are you looking at my feet?” Draco frowned, tucking his feet under his legs so he was sitting cross-legged instead of lounging on the chair. The wizard had no idea why he felt so self-conscious about his feet. He just wasn’t used to anyone paying attention to them.
“I can feel your magical signature.” The healer laughed, “Mr Potter was lucky that he went to you. But let’s hope that he actually comes straight to us next time.”
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco groaned, he had a feeling he knew exactly what his father did. But it wasn’t something that he wanted to say out loud, “Of course my father would do something like that.”
“I would have talked to him eventually.” Draco sighed. It wasn’t like he was intentionally trying to be difficult. But everything that Harry had done made everything difficult. He had barely been in England for enough time to already be courted, “Harry was brash for jumping into this without talking to me first. It happened way too fast.”
“Good. But you shouldn’t take what Weasley said to heart.” Draco stated firmly, “You have a lot of redeeming qualities. If you didn’t, we wouldn’t even be together.”
“Night.” Draco smiled, he was rather attached to the other wizard. He was probably one of his favourite relatives. But Draco wasn’t really connected to anyone else he was related to. Bellatrix was in Azkaban, and she wasn’t really someone he liked. As soon as Sirius was out of the room, the blond immediately turned to Harry, “So you’re really taking this courting thing seriously. But I swear to Merlin. If there is anything sexual in that bag, I’m going to hex your arse out of this house.”
“Well… I’m not sure if you know this. But I have been working with the ministry in getting death eaters that have renounced Voldemort and everything that he stood for, another change.” Harry started, “I started with your parents. It was easy to help you and your mother as you both stood against Voldemort in the end. But I somehow managed to persuade them that your father wasn’t a bad person and he got his old position back.”
“Should we invite everyone at the same time? Maybe we can have dinner at the Malfoy Manor?” Draco started, “The sooner, the better. That way we won’t have family nagging us in the future.”
“It’s not a problem at all.” Draco insisted, “If you two ever need someone to watch Teddy, or even your own children when you have them. I am here.”
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Pansy said firmly, “Don’t worry you’re pretty little head about it.”
The blond just hoped that the new generation of Slytherins weren’t subjected to similar treatment. But he had a nagging feeling they were. Draco had a feeling that he would have to visit the school in the future just to check.
“Well. Lucky for you, Draco is my Godson and I have an inkling of what he likes.” Severus answered, “Try something simple but tasteful. Chocolate truffles and a bottle of wine.”
“It’s okay. I forgive you.” Severus grinned, it was a melancholy look he only seemed to have whenever he remembered everything stupid that Harry had done while he was living with him, “And I believe Sirius and Remus scolded you enough.”
“Okay.” Draco agreed, signalling for the waiter to come over, “I’ll have the chicken vindaloo and could I have naan with that?”
“Particular about his meat?” Harry questioned, giving Draco a pointed look, “What does that even mean?”
“So when will you invite me to Malfoy Manor?” Harry questioned, starling a laugh out of Lucius. He was doing something right. He had no idea what it was, but Lucius seemed to like it, “We both know how long courting can take and I’d rather jump right into it.”
They had been dating for a little over a month. The couple were absolutely smitten with each other. Harry was currently curled against Draco’s side and they were having a quiet evening. Well. That was until two people decided to apparate into Draco’s apartment. It was kind of annoying that everyone didn’t seem to think it was necessary to tell them that they were visiting.
“Bloody hell. That was a blow on my confidence.” Harry groaned, “Everyone will probably think the same thing when we announce our relationship.”
“If I’m completely honest. I have no idea why it goes that high.” Harry admitted, “Do you want me to make you something? What are you craving other than buttered toast?”
“Okay. That’s it.” Draco started, “The both of you, out now. Everything is fine, tell Harry that if he wasn’t to drop by, he can. And my work hours have been a little hectic lately.”
The idea of everything falling apart scared Harry. The tugging feeling in his heart indicated that it wouldn’t be good for him at all. Voldemort had made him lose far too much.
“Hold on! I’m getting dressed!” Harry yelled, pulling out his invisibility cloak and throwing it over Draco’s head before shoving the blond into his closet. Harry breathed out loudly, straightening his clothes before he opened the wards.
“Yes, I was raised with house-elves. But that doesn’t mean that I wasn’t taught how to take care of myself.” Draco pointed out, and it did kind of make sense, “We’re not uncultured pheasants. Do you kn-”
“Ah. So that’s why it was pressing? Whose dreams are you walking into?” Sirius questioned curiously, “I’m sure you have heard of the concept of soulmates? Well, they don’t bloody exist. But dream-walking is second best. It’s a Black secret. One of the main reasons why we have a non-existent divorce rate.”
“Pansy. I’m not dating Hermione.” Ron said, getting straight to the point, “I was hoping that we could try getting to know each other.”
“Was it about Voldemort?” Draco continued, deciding to sit up and give Harry his full attention, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“What should I get Draco as a courting gift?” Harry smiled, he felt so much better with the little pep talk from Severus. Maybe he wasn’t good enough for Draco, but that didn’t change the fact that he was given the opportunity to pursue it, “I haven’t really had the chance to talk to him properly.”
“I’m going on a date with Remus,” Sirius said offhandedly. It was obvious that the older wizard had news about Remus Lupin because the werewolf seemed to be one of the main reasons that Sirius would end up coming home with a smile. But that didn’t make the timing of Sirius’ announcement any less bad, “Just thought that you should know.”
“My darling boy. Before we continue this whole courting discussion, I would like to say that I did miss you.” Lucius grinned, “You never really made it easy to contact you. And Harry Potter, he is a rather endearing wizard. I didn’t see any reason to reject his intentions on courting you. If you do not fancy him, you can always reject his advances. We as your parents are not bartering you off like a horse.”
“How did you find out?” Harry asked, “I actually came here to tell you about it. I was talking to Hermione about it and we figured that since Andy was sexually harassing you, he probably sexually harassed a bunch of other people too. Turns out the guy was abusing his power to get people to do favours for him. So we got him taken to court because it is seriously illegal.”
“Why would you not want to pursue this witch that you have an interest in?” Draco asked, “Nothing’s stopped you before.”
“Really? She thinks that I used her to cheat on Hermione?” Ron frowned, “No wonder I haven’t seen her around. Where is she now? Maybe I should clear the air.”
“Sirius?” Draco frowned, finally deciding that this was the time to move, “What are you doing here?”
“Yes, we are.” Ginny smiled all knowingly, and Draco had a feeling that there was more to it, “Next week.”
“Can you just kill me?” Draco repeated, letting out a pathetic whine. He was surely going to throw up if the room didn’t stop spinning. Why did he do this to himself? No. That wasn't right. Why did he let his friends do this to him?
Even when they weren’t in a relationship, Harry had been a constant in Draco’s life. The other wizard had helped him when he was sure no one other than his friends would have helped. The whole Wizarding world hated him and his family. It was strange to see how Harry could easily accept that it was something that had happened and move on from it.
“So what’s a mango lassi?” Draco asked curiously, and Harry couldn’t help but find his inquisitiveness quite adorable. This whole Muggle exploration thing was bringing out a side of Draco that Harry had never known about. And he rather liked it.
“I’m not sure if you’ve heard. But I am currently going through a divorce.” Remus frowned, “Not many people are aware, and I’d like to keep it that way.”
“Your animagus is a dog. You transform into a bloody dog. What are you doing carrying kittens around?” Harry frowned, looking between Sirius and Draco. The cat was cute, but he wasn’t going to let anyone know he thought that. It was already hard enough with Harry and Draco living together, adding an animal was going to make it even harder. Draco was already so particular with cleanliness, and Harry couldn’t help but worry about cat hairs. But looking at how smitten the blond was with the cat, Harry had a feeling that they would find a way to make it work, “I can’t believe you just brought a cat back home. It’s so random.”
The sound of someone apparating into his apartment almost gave him a heart attack. The blond wasn’t used to people suddenly appearing whenever they pleased and the sight of Harry Potter in a pair of pyjama pants a comfy looking shirt was unsettling. Unsettling enough to make his mouth drop.
“Devilishly good looking I hope.” Harry beamed, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, “Hello husband. I believe I’ve drunk a tad bit too much.”
“I come bearing gifts,” Harry announced, entering the study. The good thing about Draco living with Harry’s Godfather was that there were no restrictions on Harry, he could travel into the house whenever he wanted to.
“He did. I was surprised, but he wanted us to be a part of Harry’s life.” Sirius answered, “He’s not a bad guy once you get to know him. A little anti-social, but he is a good guy.”
“Are you sure that this is a good idea?” Pansy queried softly, lounging on the sofa. They had managed to place all the furniture and all that Draco needed to do was work on minor decorations and give the apartment a bit of character, “Life without magic isn’t going to be easy.”
“Dray. That’s only if you’re a high class escort, and from what I’ve seen. You’re barely managing to keep up with the costs of a shitty flat.” Blaise snorted, earning a heavy glare from the blond. Draco withheld the temptation to say something as equally shitty back and instead finished his drink.
“Oh. No. Draco it’s when you have sex in every room.” Harry explained, “I never realised how weird it was to say that until you asked me if it was something religious.”
“Teddy. You need to get back to your parents.” Draco said softly, trying to ease the toddler’s fingers away from his shirt. But the kid was not relenting, “Teddy.”
“I’m sorry, I’ll make sure to write everything down next time.” Harry snorted, “But maybe you should keep the vacuum cleaner. Just in case. It might be useful one day.”
“Do you seriously think that I would deliberately go into your dreams?” Draco snorted, his hands making their way onto the lapels of Harry’s suit. Pulling him closer. They were too close. Draco was teasing him, “I’m sure you’ve heard of dream walkers, but I don’t specialise in that sort of magic. I do dabble in dark arts, but I would never reduce myself to dream walking.”
It had been a week since the discovery. Draco just acted like he normally did around Harry. He wasn’t sure if he wanted to pursue a relationship other than friendship with Harry. The blond was scared that he was going to ruin everything.
“Because you’re a celebrity and you will continue to be followed for the rest of your life.” Draco said consciously, “Have you never considered going back to living life as Muggle? Or does this life of being constantly followed make you happy?”
“He’s in love with Remus and he doesn’t know what to do because Remus is married to Tonks.” Harry said offhandedly, Draco’s mouth opened in shock, “What. Everyone sees how they look at each other.”
“Okay.” Harry snorted, letting out a little laugh, “Is there anything else? Would you like me to get you some freshly squeezed orange juice with that?”
“Well, that makes it easier.” Draco smiled, “If my parents like you, there’s no reason to keep our friendship a secret anymore.”
“You want to tell Draco something?” Harry repeated, staring at Draco in a questioning manner. If anything, the attention should have stayed on Ginny because Draco had no idea what the witch wanted to tell him.
“That depends. Do I still get the wine and chocolates if I say no?” Draco asked cautiously, he wasn’t going to say no. But he didn’t want Harry to think that it would be that easy. Even though it technically was going to be that easy, “I’ll let you know once you answer that.”
“What was Hermione right about?” Draco asked curiously. Maybe there was an event that was coming up that they wanted to surprise Draco with? Draco was pretty damn good at figuring things out, “Is there anything that I need to be worried about?”
“It really depends on how good are you with spices?” Harry asked, of course, Draco would want to experiment with food, “If you’re not good with heat, I would suggest going for a korma. But if you like spicy food, you should try the vindaloo.”
“Malfoy. As in related to Lucius Malfoy?” Harry frowned, he didn’t know much about the Malfoy family other than the fact that Lucius Malfoy was on the board of governors for Hogwarts. The guy was intimidating as hell, but Harry didn’t really go out of his way to find out more about the Malfoy family, “I thought Weasley’s didn’t get along with Malfoy’s.”
“H- hello. Who is this?” An elderly woman responded, and Draco was definite that the owner of the voice was not Harry. For one thing, Harry was not an elderly lady.
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco groaned, slapping Sirius’ hand away. He would make Sirius pay for that, “You’re like a child.”
“Then I guess you’re stuck with me.” Ron grinned, the redhead took the news a lot better than Draco expected him to, “We need to tell my family.”
“That sounds about right.” Draco continued, “I’ve been getting noise complaints from my neighbours, so I was thinking that it would probably be best if I move into your house. My parents like you enough, so I’m sure they won’t mind.”
“Are you sure you’re not the one with the crush on Draco?” Harry queried incredulously, it was just far too odd for Ron to be complimenting Draco like this.
“I don’t think it’s something that you need to hear from me.” Hermione commented, “But, I am definite that you’ll figure it out on your own. I mean you are equally as smart as me.”
“I -I’m pregnant.” Pansy said softly, Harry paled considerably and looked directly at Draco. It was funny to think that the first person Harry would look to would be Draco. At least the blond could tell him that he was not involved in what happened between Ron and Pansy.
“So what did you need help with?” Harry asked, looking around his place, “Do you need some help with unboxing? Or is it your phone?”
“You. The boy who lived. The wizard that defeated Voldemort. Admire me?” Draco snorted, “There’s nothing admirable about me.”
“It’s not a problem at all.” Harry sighed, “Seriously you need to stop knocking yourself down so much. You’re not a bad person. And I want to help.”
My posting is going to be sporadic. I apologise if this chapter makes no sense, but my head is a little all over the place because vertigo sucks.
“Good. He should be here any moment.” Sirius smiled, “Good luck cousin. This is going to be scary, but it will be worth it.”
“Well, it’s not like you’re a great catch either.” Harry said angrily, Ron opened his mouth and closed it repeatedly, it was almost as if he was mimicking a fish.
“You’re a bit of a worrier.” Draco pointed out, “Are you like this with everyone? I don’t think I would be able to deal with the stress of worrying about everyone.”
“I’m sorry.” Harry apologised, rather suddenly. Draco stared at him, not understanding what the brunet was apologising for, “I rejected your offer of friendship when we were kids. And I wonder if things would have been different if I didn’t. I’m not saying that you’re a bad person or anything like that. But I think it would have been better for you if you had someone else to talk to. I mean. I could see you were going through something, and I still didn’t offer any help.”
“Well. Before you rudely cut me off.” Lucius said in a pointed tone, “It isn’t actually a surprise that you feel this way. The way you used to talk about Harry when you were younger already suggested that you liked him. Your mother and I thought it was an unrequited feeling. But Harry clearly feels the same for you.”
He was never going to eat cheese before bed ever again. Turned out that people had every right to have the suspicion that eating cheese before sleeping gave you a restless sleep.
“Well. I thought I could help you entertain yourself with some books.” Hermione explained, “Harry told me that you got a job to keep yourself occupied, but you should try reading these books in your spare time. I’ve brought you a whole array of books that I thought you might take interest in.”
He should have taken Draco’s threat more seriously. Because the next time he visited the blond, he deliberately cooked dinner with a ridiculous amount chillis knowing full well that Harry’s stomach could not handle it. Harry had to go through the horror of having burning bowel movements. He wouldn’t admit this to anyone. But Harry did end up crying on the toilet. His arse was on fire.
“I am so sorry. I believe I have the wrong person.” Draco blushed, hanging up the phone. He stared at the phone and looked at the number that he dialled and the number that he was given. It took him a few minutes to realise that he had actually typed in a six instead of a nine. The idea unnerved him. The fact that one mistake meant that you would end up calling a completely different person was daunting. He tried again, this time triple-checking that the number that he had typed was actually identical to the one on the paper. As the dial tone continued, Draco’s heart sank further into his stomach and he was almost tempted to hang up. But then the other person on the other side of the line decided to pick up.
“I’m guessing Sirius probably told you everything without disclosing who his dream-mate was. So I think the best thing to do is talk to Remus, see his perspective on things.” Harry answered, and Draco thought that was a pretty damn good idea. And it would also give him the opportunity to actually introduce himself to Harry’s Godfather, “But that’s just an idea. If you’re not okay with it, we could probably come up with a better plan.”
“And what on earth is that supposed to mean?” Harry frowned, he had a fallout with Ron at least once a month. They were like an old married couple and they were due for an argument, “I was the one that stopped the whole dark lord thing.”
Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say. A fist collided with his cheek, was it bad that he was so used to getting punched that he wasn’t surprised anymore.
Draco just hoped that he wouldn’t end up heartbroken by the end of this. What he had originally thought was a great friendship, somehow evolved into something completely different.
“It’s not all Muggles. It’s mostly Muggle men.” Harry corrected, startling a laugh out of Draco, “So if your boss tries to hit on you. Just tell him you are already dating someone. And if it all goes to hell, you can always say that I’m your boyfriend and I can kick his arse.”
“I guess this calls for dessert,” Severus responded, at that comment, Draco wasn’t sure what to do other than laugh. There wasn’t really any response anyone could have said to make it better. But the fact that Severus was trying to divert the attention with food was hilarious, “And maybe some wine.”
“At least I have something to say for myself. What can you say?” Harry asked. Before deciding to end the argument before it got too heated up. They were currently at a little cafe and they were drawing in too much attention, “You know what. This isn’t the time or the place to have an argument. If you don’t have anything good to say about the fact that I’m courting someone, you might as well not say anything at all.”
“I do like you.” Harry smiled, earning a loud sigh from Draco, “If you really don’t want me to make dinner, then maybe you should make me food for once.”
“I’ve been okay. How about you?” Draco queried, watching as Harry took a sip of the latte. The other wizard looked at the cup in interest, before turning his attention back to Draco.
Draco was currently sitting on the floor in his room, everything was spinning and it was sad to say, but it took this moment for him to figure out why he was withholding throwing a housewarming party. Slytherins were ruthless when it came to partying and drinking. This is what lead to Draco’s current situation. When he was sober enough, he was going to murder Pansy and Blaise. It was their fault he was in this state.
“I agree with you completely.” Draco smiled maliciously, he was going to make sure that Sirius was going to pay.
It was weird to think that it took a few months of hanging out for the two of them to put an actual label on their relationship.
“No. Can you just come over?” Draco questioned, he did not seem too worried, which was a good sign. But he seemed pretty calm when there was a fire last time, so Harry was not too sure what to expect, “I’m not sure what to do.”
Harry turned the dial to the toaster, to the lowest and watched as the bread pitifully jumped out of the machine. It was clearly a little too late as there was no way to salvage it.
“I’ll let him have it.” Harry laughed, “Okay. Let’s go back to the main topic. Are you planning on getting married?”
“It gets worse than that?” Draco asked, “How on earth does it get worse than that? Are you having twins?”
Harry had insisted that they should celebrate, Draco had no idea what they were celebrating. But it was a simple occasion, they ordered some food and watched a movie.
“Sure. I’ll be over in a bit.” Harry said. The fact that Harry was so willing to help made Draco question his credibility. What if the wizard was taking advantage of his misfortunes to tell the daily prophet about how much of a loser he was?
“Magic is magic is it not?” Lucius shot back, he wasn’t challenging Harry. It was more of a discussion and Harry didn’t necessarily think of anything bad in regards to the dark arts, “But why the sudden curiosity in my son? He refuses to come back to England and has relocated to France. I’m surprised that you were even aware that he existed.”
“If you didn’t go to Hogwarts, you probably would have never met Potter.” Blaise pointed out, “And your mother wouldn’t have been able to save him. If anything there is a high possibility that Harry would be dead right now.”
“Yep. It just sucks everything right up.” Harry laughed, “That’s why they call it a vacuum cleaner.”
“I can give you a potion to sober you up if you’d like?” Harry asked, before ultimately deciding to help Draco onto his bed, “Or I could get you a greasy kebab to munch on. It should help you feel a bit better.”
“Okay. I just need to clarify because Blaise may or may not have cried bloody murder when we tried it out for the first time.” Draco grinned, “I’ll let him know that it’s not a device used to torture people the next time I see him.”
“That’s exactly why we’re here.” Pansy grinned, “Hermione tells me that you haven’t been able to finish a book in quite some time. Which is kind of surprising considering the fact that you’re a bookworm? You finish lengthy books in a day.”
“Oh, Draco! I didn’t know you would be here yet.” Remus said, the man seemingly appearing out of nowhere. Now it made perfect sense as to why Harry seemed to do the same thing, “Harry told me that you were going to be moving in and asked me to clean up a little before you got here.”
“Muggles have lived perfectly fine without the use of magic.” Draco pointed out, “And I’d rather be here. The idea of hexes being thrown at me on a regular basis is not how I want to live my life.”
“Goodnight.” Harry smiled, helping Draco to his bed and making sure he was comfortable before apparating back to his own house. He was sure Draco would appreciate the water and paracetamol in the morning.
“Okay. I guess we’ll see you around.” Draco smiled, watching as Pansy detangled herself from Harry and pressed a kiss to his cheek. She then walked over to Draco and pressed her lips against his cheek too.
“Great. I hope to see you soon.” Harry said in a sincere tone, this wizard could potentially be his future father in law if all went well, “Thank you for having this talk.”
“It wasn’t something you were supposed to know at all?” Sirius said calmly, Draco frowned, they surely couldn’t be talking about the same thing, “What happened between your father and I was an accident. I swear down. We both had a little wine and the kiss meant absolutely nothing.”
“Of course there is,” Harry argued, moving his plate to the side. It was surprising that Harry had managed to stomach such a large breakfast, “The odds were against you. Both you and your mother still managed to do what was right in the end. If that isn’t something that isn’t to be admired, then I sure as hell don’t know what is. And I wouldn’t have been able to take Voldemort down without everyone’s help. It was your wand that I used to destroy him.”
“No. If you really must know I was enjoying some time alone with my hand.” Harry stated, it was the only way that the whole subject would be dropped because when it came to masturbation, everyone was too weirded out by it.
“Yeah, that should be fine.” Draco agreed, “But I’m not going to let you make me dinner. Pansy and Blaise are still taking the piss out of me after you made everyone breakfast.”
“Rebecca definitely has bragging rights.” Andy laughed, “If you’re not too busy during the week, I was hoping we could meet up? I’m not going to be in London for long and it would be nice to be able to hang out with a familiar face.”
“Are you sure that this is a good idea?” Draco frowned, they were currently walking over to the café. It was weird that Andy had originally told him that he was just going to be in London for the week. But had somehow managed to prolong his stay in hopes of getting another date out of Draco. He wouldn’t have minded if the man didn’t constantly call and message him. Draco kind of felt like he was getting harassed.
“I miss her too, but I don’t think she’d be happy to see how I’m living.” Draco sighed, “I’m not exactly following pureblood traditions.”
“Please tell me that you’re just saying this to wind me up?” Harry cringed, “I don’t like the idea of Blaise or Pansy knowing that sort of stuff about me.”
“His family has a lot of power in the wizarding world, so I’m hoping he’ll draw in more customers.” Ron answered flatly, “But he wants to meet everyone involved in the business and that includes you. I won’t be able to be there as I have Auror business to attend to.”
“I call it the strawberry shortcake. The sweetness subdues the bitterness.” Draco explained, “It’s probably really bad for your health.”
“Thanks. You’re a lifesaver.” Ron grinned, “Is around twelve okay? I’m not sure what time we’ll come to pick him up. But I’ll send you a note.”
“I found some baby albums and I thought it would be nice to show you.” Narcissa smiled, “But Draco is insistent that we burn the books so that no one can ever see pictures of him from when he was a baby.”
After Harry left, Draco decided that he was better off on his back. It was weird because he felt like he was in the sea, his body moving along with a wave. When he had gotten the place he was sure the floor was flat. It shouldn’t have been moving the way it was. Maybe he wasn't home anymore. Maybe he was on a boat.
“How good are you with spices?” Harry asked, of course, Draco would want to experiment with food, “If you’re not good with heat, I would suggest going for a korma. But if you like spicy food, you should try the vindaloo.”
“Harry! What’s up with the wards? I can’t come in mate.” Ron yelled, banging on the door a few times. Draco turned to stare at Harry in shock and any other time the brunet would have probably found the expression hilarious. But they were currently trying to keep their relationship a secret and that meant no one other than their families were aware of what was going on.
“I’ll take your word for it.” Draco decided, the man came out with the drinks. The drink was a creamy yellow. Something that Draco had never seen before, he was used to brightly coloured juices. The consistency also looked a lot thicker than a regular drink, something that interested him greatly. The blond took a careful sip, just to try how it tasted and if it was something that he would be able to stomach. And to his surprise, it was actually surprisingly good. Something that he was sure that he would be able to regularly drink.
“I sweep the floor first, then I use a mop to clean it.” Draco answered, “And the places I can’t reach, I just use a chair. Everything else gets either brushed down with a dust brush or cleaned with a surface wiper.”
“So you’re planning on leaving?” Harry questioned, “Where are you going to live? Back at the Malfoy mansion?”
“Actually. I got you some elderflower wine and chocolate truffles.” Harry grinned, watching as Draco looked at the bottle in curiosity. Harry knew that he was right. Draco mostly drank red wine, most likely the one that his family manufactured, “Do you accept the courting gift?”
“Well from what I’ve seen, it appears that the whole dream walking thing is a part of the Black family.” Harry stated, “I just wanted to clarify if that’s why Sirius was miserable at the sight of Remus? I’m guessing that Remus is Sirius’ dream mate?”
“Oh really? So I’m really standing in for you.” Harry grinned. It looked like there was one good thing that would come out of this, “I’ll only agree to it if you promise me one thing.”
“Wow. You actually sound articulate for once.” Draco continued, earning a light shove from the redhead, “Really? I was complimenting you.”
“Oh, dear Merlin.” Draco muttered, before talking in a normal tone, “Harry, you can’t make everyone like me.”
“Yes, I was disowned. But I was still a Black for a while and my dreams started pretty early on.” Sirius explained, “If you want to learn more about how this works, there is a book. I’m still trying to figure out where it is exactly, but I was planning on giving it to you as a birthday gift.”
“Okay.” Draco agreed, signalling for the waiter to come over, “I’ll have the chicken vindaloo and could I have naan with that?”
“Of course you have to come. I’m insisting.” Narcissa laughed, making her way to Harry and giving him the same treatment as Draco. A kiss on the cheek, and a motherly hug. Draco looked at the scene in shock, he turned to look at how his father was taking it. But the older wizard just continued to smile. It was scary to think how much his family liked Harry.
“Hey, Drake. There’s a guy that’s been staring at you for a while.” Claire pointed out, “He’s kind of cute, do you know him?”
“I don’t need a wand.” Draco insisted, “I can do all necessary spells without one. I mean it’s just an instrument to channel magic. There are plenty of cultures that don’t use wands.”
“No. Er. Slightly? I mean I didn’t tell my parents about you.” Draco corrected, “I was worried about what they would say. I was hoping to slowly ease them into it.”
“Because you’re the same as me.” Harry stated, “Now why don’t we help each other move on from this?”
“Luna, how can I help?” Draco greeted, letting the witch in. It was weird to think that she would come visit him. He had a feeling it had something to do with Harry.
“Good morning.” Draco greeted, he sounded too awake for an early morning call. It was something that bothered Harry, the blond just never seemed to sleep, “I know it’s early. But I didn’t want to cause another incident.”
“Malfoy Manor. We’ll just invite family and close friends.” Harry answered. It was a simple idea. But Draco liked it a lot. His parents wouldn’t mind at all, “You have bloody peacocks. That’s extravagant enough.”
“Your parents adore me.” Harry added, the longer they talked the angrier Andy was getting. The older man’s face looked more like a prune every minute, “Your dad actually visited me at work the other day and invited me for tea.”
Harry, on the other hand, seemed confused by his friend’s sudden appearance. It was sweet to think that Pansy trusted Harry enough to let the wizard comfort her. His arms were currently wrapped around the witch.
Harry knew from the very beginning that this wasn’t a good idea. But for some reason, it really pissed him to know that Draco was getting constantly harassed by this guy. Harry was going to make sure that when Draco quit, there was going to be any inappropriate comments or touches.
“You look bloody awful.” Pansy said, startling a laugh out of Draco, he appreciated the fact that she was honest with him, “But that doesn’t matter.”
“It’s a drink.” Harry answered, “I’m definite that you’ll like. It’s a staple drink to have with your curry.”
“I believe we have. But that’s something that I’ll have to talk to Harry about later.” Draco answered, with that answer Harry felt like he was on the verge of a panic attack. They were having the same dreams? He had never heard of anyone having linked dreams. This was a first for him, “So shall we jump into business? I have a few ideas of helping the business thrive.”
“Of course I wanted to take the guy down.” Harry growled, “The guy punched you in the face. I wasn’t going to let him get away with harassing and hurting you. That isn’t right. A friend doesn’t let something like that happen to their friend. I mean if Pansy was going through something similar you probably would have done the same thing.”
“Because you put it on the list. You know the one you gave me before I moved here.” Draco pointed out, “You didn’t even tell me what half the stuff on the list did.”
“What time are you planning on picking him up?” Draco questioned, ignoring the Hermione comment, “Teddy’s a toddler. I’m almost definite that he wouldn’t be able to tell me much about his allergies or anything of that sort.”
“Well, I’m in love with someone else.” Remus answered, “And after we got married, Tonks used to tell me about how she was insecure about the marriage because of something related to the Black family. Supposedly her mother had the perfect meeting with her father through a dream. But because her mother was disowned, this meant that she would never be able to have the same experience as she was not a part of the Black family anymore.”
“Fine. I’ll let you have that one.” Draco groaned, for some reason making Harry smile, “Oi. Who are you looking at like that?”
“Well. Of course, I want to start a family with you. I don’t see myself have children with anyone else.” Draco said, “But not now. When we’re ready to start a family.”
“Yeah. I guess it wouldn’t be such a bad idea to have some potions.” Draco agreed, “So how has everything been for you? You said that it’s getting better?”
“Of course not. I did bring enough to feed a whole family.” Harry laughed awkwardly, Draco couldn’t help but wince. He kind of felt sorry for the brunet, but that’s what you got when you always turned up unannounced, “I hope you don’t mind Italian food.”
“You know I would do anything for you.” Harry stated firmly. And that frightened Draco. The blond knew what anything entailed, and he didn't want to have that sort of control over Harry.
“Okay. I get it.” Andy grounded out, “You could have just told me that from the very beginning instead of stringing me along.”
“If I tell you this. You have to promise to not tell another living soul. This means even your boyfriend.” Blaise stated, waiting for Draco’s affirmative nod before continuing, “I am interested in a certain witch. But I don’t want to pursue her.”
“Ron. As in Ron Weasley?” Draco repeated, holy shit. He was going to have a heart attack. Last time he checked, Ron was in a relationship with Hermione. If Pansy was pregnant with Ron’s child, that could only mean one thing, “Shit. Pan. Don’t worry, I’ll clear this up. There’s always options if you don’t want to keep it.”
It was not okay. Draco had no idea where this burst of optimism came from, he was usually a realist. But as soon as Harry was involved, he wanted the best outcomes. Andy didn’t appear to upset that Draco was handing in his resignation letter. If anything the man appeared to be happy. Maybe Harry was actually right. The man has his own warped idea of what was happening.
“They took away my nimbus.” Harry laughed, he remembered it like it was yesterday. He had never really ever seen Sirius or Remus as angry as they were that day, “I’m not going to lie. I was a little bitter about it.”
“No. No. I’m not going to do that.” Draco countered, “He’s already done more than enough for me. I don’t want to drag him into this. He’s dating that Weasley girl, isn’t he?”
“It’s not an amazing job, but it’s near the house. The pay’s not that great either.” Draco sighed, he did not seem to be dejected by the job prospect. Harry could only hope that it would not be too bad of an experience, “The point of the job is to get out of the house and do something sort of productive. And I also clean the place every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.”
Harry groaned as his phone blared out. He had no idea what time it was, but he definitely knew that it was stupid o’clock. Whoever was calling him was calling him at a ridiculously unreasonable time. He could just feel it in his skin. Harry’s hand groped aimlessly in the dark in search of his glasses. As soon as he found his eyewear and popped them on his face, then he peered at his phone.
“Okay. Well. I’ll see you tomorrow then.” Harry responded. He hated early starts, “I should get fitted, don’t want to embarrass everyone.”
The tell-tale sign of someone apparating into Draco’s apartment made the blond roll his eyes. Harry still didn’t seem to understand the concept of using the front door, which was kind of funny considering the fact the man was raised with Muggles.
“Fine. Just so you know, we expect a housewarming party once you’ve unpacked everything.” Pansy smiled, “You won’t get us out of your life so easily Malfoy.”
“Do you want me to come in?” Hermione asked, “I know that you’re not comfortable with me being here. But Harry gave you another chance, so I thought I should too.”
“You just do it.” Ron said, “There’s not a particular way to do something. Sometimes you just have to do it.”
“What?” Ron snorted, “I can’t say that someone is good looking without having a crush on them? Draco may be good looking, but he has a shitty personality.”
“That doesn’t matter to her. She loves you.” Harry smiled, “Narcissa Malfoy would move planets for you.”
“Hello?” Harry grumbled into the phone. Draco didn’t call him regularly as he was a quick learner and had managed to figure out how the majority of things without any help. But there was something that Harry would not admit to anyone. The brunet enjoyed when Draco did call him. It gave him an excuse to spend a bit of time with him. And in all honesty, they were becoming quite good friends.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said softly. He couldn’t even imagine what it felt like to be rejected by the person that you loved. But Draco had a feeling it was a big misunderstanding and once he found out who the guy that Sirius was in love with was, the blond was going to make sure that he helped his cousin out. It was the least he could do, “I’ll give love a chance.”
“Do you ever listen to me?” Ron asked incredulously. In all honesty, Harry tried to listen to Ron, but his misery often made his mind go to other places, “Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. You know how we haven’t really been doing that great business wise? Well. There’s this guy who’s going to try and help us out.”
The food was often enchanted to not get cold, so Draco had a feeling that his father was helping him out in his own little way. It was embarrassing to think that it took him this long to realise his feelings for Harry. Everything was starting to make perfect sense. Like why he didn’t feel a connection to Andy at all. It was obviously because the man wasn’t Harry. But he had no idea how Harry felt for him. So it kind of felt like a losing game.
