“Same here.”
Harry absorbed that. “So, what do we do?”
Draco couldn’t stop staring at the dryness of his aunt’s lips. He kept licking his own in response, as if this could alleviate it, but, of course, it did nothing.
“I see a lot I like,” Draco said honestly. “I don’t even know where to start.”
a bit like fucking, isn’t it?”
“There’s some… reports from the afterschool program…” she began, thumbing through the pages. “A couple of incidents. Nothing major, just the normal accidental magic sort of stuff. One student melted his friend’s hat while they were play fighting over it and another…” She thumbed some more. “Another turned a fellow student into a badger… but the staff put that right very quickly.”
“Ah,” Draco said, nodding. “All right.”
With a final small jump and a
Draco smiled and made for the door, opening it to reveal Hermione again.
The bindings around Harry’s hands released from the headboard, though they remained wrapped around his wrists. He felt Draco pull on him suddenly, and then flip him onto his back. With a wave of his wand he had the ropes entwine, binding Harry’s wrists together above his head.
Reluctantly, Harry pulled away, knowing he would linger there all day if he let himself. With a final soft smile at Draco he Disapparated, popping into existence again onto the stoop of Number 12 Grimmauld Place.
Harry smiled, his heart warming at the sight. Teddy knew that Andromeda would be accompanying them to pick him up from school today, but that had clearly not bridled his enthusiasm one bit.
Harry smiled widely at him. “That would be… well… I won’t get too excited, since we don’t know yet… but that would be brilliant, if you could manage it.”
Ron immediately cottoned on. “Is that so? Well, well, well…” He looked around surreptitiously.
“Yes, like bloodthirsty dinosaur clones,” Harry said drily.
“How does it look?” Draco asked, his tone almost teasing.
If he waited long enough, it would eventually be time for dinner, and he was slated to share it with his dads and sisters that night in the family’s private quarters. It was something his dads insisted they do one Sunday evening a month, to have “family time.” In truth, Scorpius didn’t mind it. Lily was excited enough to have them all together that she entertained everyone for most of it, and after the meal Scorpius and Marissa would stay to work on homework while their dads marked essays. It was a much quieter place to study than the dorms, usually, and his dads were not bad work companions to have whenever he had a question about something.
“Yeah, he mentioned that, after the party,” Harry said, calming down.
“You’ll see.”
“Well, I can see how much work it is, but you’re doing a really good job with him. He seems really happy.”
. This Potter was one he could tolerate, even enjoy.
The Auror Corps conference room had to be temporarily magically expanded to accommodate everyone inside, Vesper noticed idly as she and McInerney entered and looked around for seats. There had to be at least four different whole departments squeezing into one room. She looked around, seeing a couple of Aurors she recognized from the Murder Squad and another from Organized Crime. Her stomach flipped when she spotted Declan and his partner, a stocky, no-nonsense looking witch with piercing dark eyes. So, the Unlicensed Magic department was involved as well. Vesper swallowed, glad her ex hadn’t spotted her yet.
“You’d get freedom in my office, too, you know. Get the issues you care about front and center.”
“No.” Harry stared at the Slytherin, incredulous. “You’re not going to do my homework for me, Malfoy.”
“Harry?”
“Special treatment, hm?” came a deep voice from behind them. Vesper and Harry both turned slowly to see Kemp standing in the doorway, arms crossed, watching them with a dangerously stoic expression. “I can think of a special treatment or two for you, dear niece. Like giving the bathrooms, changing rooms,
“I think you could too. And you know, our departments do sometimes overlap, so we may end up on the occasional case together.”
And now he was here, and it was surreal. Mostly because he realized he actually didn’t know Hermione or Ron really at all. Essentially all of his assumptions about them appeared to be false. Hermione was warm and inclusive, intellectual but not overbearingly so; Ron was sharp and sure of himself, with a dry wit that helped Draco understand why he appealed to both Harry and Hermione.
“You’ll have to help me, you know. I still need… guidance.”
Draco gave Hermione a disbelieving look and a roll of his eyes, clearly still put out. Hermione smiled at him in sympathy, but had to suppress it when Pansy turned back to her.
Harry grinned. “Not since you started at St. Mungo’s, I don’t think.” They did used to go out quite a bit more, sometimes into wizarding London, but more often to Muggle places where they wouldn’t be recognized, where they could drink and dance and snog in anonymity. Draco always loved this, the chance to show Harry off, and to show off just how mad they were for each other. Harry had learned to enjoy it too, especially once he became a more confident dancer and felt like he could hold his own next to Draco.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.” Ron said. “
to do anything specific, really. But there is…” He chewed on his lip. “There is usually a natural progression of things. Where we cozy up on the couch and snog and let ourselves get worked up, and tease each other… even if we have to go our separate ways and relieve the tension, even if we’re not ready to take that step, and at least…” He sighed. “I’m not saying we have to have sex. I’m not even saying you have to give me a timeline for when you might be ready. But it would be nice to know you even

“No, he takes off and gives me my privacy, if I have a guest. But he doesn’t want to watch that anyway.”
“You’re one to talk,” Francesca said finally, after she’d gotten herself under control.
Her head snapped up again. “Antidotes?”
“Let’s worry about it later,” Harry said placatingly.
“The kids say it when the teachers aren’t

Grinning widely, Draco flipped Kyle over onto his back so he was laying longways across the sofa. He fondled the brunet through his jeans again, starting to tease, before leaving that behind to unbutton his shirt from top to bottom.
“Probably,” Malfoy agreed. He adjusted his neck against the back of the armchair, stretching his long legs out in front of him. Harry was momentarily distracted by the sight. “What are you doing up, then?” Malfoy’s tone had taken on the acerbic quality he liked to use when he was going to give Harry a good ribbing. “Wallowing in self pity over the fact that you’re handsome, talented, and universally adored? It must be such a hard life you lead.”
common interests, at least.”
“No,” Draco said, his voice going cold. “I don’t.”
There was no pressure to perform
to look forward to. Yes indeed.
“You were protecting them. You were saving their lives.”
“Yeah…” Scorpius had to admit that, when put in those terms, it was. “Yeah, I guess so.”

he reminded himself.
Vesper’s cheeks turned pink. “I know. Anthony’s already invited me.”
people? Is that really what they want?”
It was the most logical course of action, but it did leave Draco at a disadvantage. He knew very little about Muggle culture, and even less about gay Muggle culture, so he had no idea how he was expected to act, talk, or dress.
“Ba de ya, say do you remember, ba de ya, dancing in September…”*
to feel shitty about it, ok?”
“Coffee,” he said. “Dark roast, with a dash of milk.”
her,” Ron hissed through his teeth. “He put his hands on her. And now I’m going to put my fists on him.”
Harry had learned that one early on, and he never forgot it.
“Things got a bit strange with Pansy and me, when she had her son, especially after… you know… Astoria…”
Audrey nodded.
But now was not the time. They were still in the classroom portion of the day, much to Vesper’s chagrin. It wasn’t that she’d done poorly in school, but she’d always been more athlete than bookworm. She liked
Kyle sighed. He and Angelina had already had this conversation multiple times, and Kyle had wearied quickly of trying to explain that Draco had clearly changed and was no longer the same “stuck up little shite” that Angelina had known at Hogwarts. Angelina never believed him when he said this, so he didn’t see the point of continuing the argument.
“You’re mad,” said Seamus.
“I suppose I didn’t know what else I could possibly do. It seemed like I was made for one thing, and that one thing defined me. It was all I thought I was good at.”
he thought.
“And O’Brien, that Ravenclaw,” said Francesca.
love him, maybe.”
“Chemistry,” he heard Potter reply, tossing a surreptitious wink Draco’s way.
“Here comes Teddy,” Harry said. “Just in time.”
Zabini sighed and looked past Harry to his blond friend sitting up in the bed, his hand still submerged in the bowl of potion. “Your boyfriend is going to have a stroke if this keeps up. Talk some sense into him.”
“Draco bet me that you’d find some way to bring Neville into the conversation within the first half hour of our being here.”
Lindsey could see the change in him as surely as he could feel it in himself, and she told him so, the very day she was leaving for Toronto.
“I’m not yelling,” Lindsey said, huffing.
The pull of Harry’s lips and tongue right
But she didn’t know, not really.
“I thought losing didn’t bother you.”
“Attacked? Do you really believe he has to worry about that? And even if he does, that all of the other dueling skills aren’t going to prove more useful? It’s a pointless jinx to learn, end of discussion.”
“Ok… well… good.”
“Maybe someday, things will be different,” she said, “and we can think about getting back together.”
creative with his fingers), but this was still too slow for Draco’s liking.
“Yeah.”
“I leapt onto the roof of my school while my cousin and his gang were chasing me. Or… I don’t know if I leapt, exactly. I don’t really remember how I got up there. I suppose it’s possible I Apparated.”
? Draco mused.
“I’m sorry.”
– lips had been so tempting that he couldn’t bring himself to stop kissing them. It had taken quite a bit of willpower, plus a glance at the clock to see just how close he was cutting it, to finally break away.
Harry turned his head to see that the other boy – Liam, he assumed – had approached and was mirroring Teddy’s pleading expression.
“Yes,” she agreed, giving him a small smile. “Those things do affect you, in the end, even when you try not to let them. So I suppose a part of me has always thought how nice and convenient it would be to bring home a pureblood, someone really wonderful that my parents would embrace easily. I’m not proud of it; I know it’s wrong. I like to believe that if the person I found was a Muggleborn or something that I would fight tooth and nail for him anyway. If he was the one for me, then it would be worth it.”
Hermione looked at him. “Precisely.”
Sensing some distress, Draco lifted Harry’s hand to his lips and kissed his palm. “Good thing I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “So you don’t have to think about it anymore.”
The game progressed beautifully from there, and when the score reached one hundred to twenty in Gryffindor’s favor, Harry began looking for the Snitch in earnest. It was about twenty minutes later, when they had a one hundred and ten point margin, that he spotted it again, and this time, he went straight for it, capturing the pesky little ball before the Hufflepuff Seeker had even begun the chase.
As expected, the next day brought its fair share of Howlers, cursed letters, and simple hate mail to Harry and Draco both. Most of the letters Harry received weren’t dangerous; they were along the lines of “How could you?! He’s a Death Eater!” on top of a few slurs on his sexuality from the most narrow-minded of the bunch. It was irritating, but not anything he hadn’t been prepared for.
, you wanted people to like you. You tried to fit in with your brothers, you tried to be worthy of a friendship with one of the most famous wizards in history, even though, to Harry, you were
was quite an unpleasant prospect.
Draco resisted the urge to scoff. “Don’t be absurd, ‘Dromeda. She will want to stay and support you.”
about such an event). Then, a few years later, he could picture discussing the idea of having children, whether through adoption, or surrogacy, or whatever Draco wanted, really. And then they would be a family, a proper one, and they would split their Christmas holidays between the Burrow and Malfoy Manor, and they would work, and travel on holidays, perhaps, and their children would grow up and go to Hogwarts, and though they would be sad to see them off, they would always have each other. It was a nice picture. He could see it all so clearly.
Harry frowned pensively. “No. Why would it?”
“Yes, he may. I hope he does. He’s one of my most promising beginners.”
It made Scorpius feel uneasy, every time he saw that expression, and once his grandparents were gone again he would remove the ring, stowing it away safely in its box and out of sight, until the feeling had worn off.
“You know what I mean.” Draco didn’t answer. Harry sighed. “It’s just something Muggles say sometimes.”
“I…” Pansy was at a complete loss for words, but Draco found he couldn’t properly enjoy it, not until he was sure she would accept him. “Well… what does a person say at a time like this? Congratulations?”

Draco breathed through the annoyance and imagined this dig being followed by an obvious

Harry thought that over. “Do you think he’s telling the truth about that part, that
She was unaffected by his glare, however, ignoring Draco completely as she watched Harry, waiting for a response.
It was lucky Harry hadn’t actually taken a sip of whiskey yet, or it would have been in danger of coming out his nose as he choked on a surprised laugh. “Me and Francesca?” What was Malfoy on about?
“You are so full of shit, Harry Potter. I can’t wait for the day my uncle lets me kick your skinny ass all over the training floor.” She shoved him playfully, and he shoved her back.
“No, they’re not,” she said, giving him what she hoped was a friendly but not flirty smile. “They’re for me and my friend.” She indicated the table where Declan sat, waiting for her.
“I don’t, not all the time,” he said truthfully. “All I know is I’m finally being honest for the first time in a long time. Maybe even ever, when it comes to
Draco swallowed, not saying anything. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that. It seemed unfair to Harry. And yet it was what Harry believed. Perhaps it was how Harry coped with knowing Draco was with other people. And who was he to deny Harry that?
That night, Kyle asked Draco to finally fuck him for the first time. Draco told him he wasn’t ready and ate the brunet out instead, and it felt strangely like an apology.
“So, then, why not have Christmas at Hogwarts, just for this one year?”
“You know that’s not what I meant,” she said, her mouth breaking into a real grin of amusement. “I found you quite intimidating at the start of my fourth year, in fact. But now you
“I think that’s a very classy way to go about it.”
Some part of him, even now, wanted to tense and resist. But he’d placated that part of him, drugged it with breath, and pleasure, and
And there it was again. His name. But Harry hardly had attention enough to spare for the implications, because Malfoy was still going, and it was mesmerizing.
“Yeah, but do you really think
“It doesn’t have to be a bad thing,” Draco went on, his tone more reasonable now. “We haven’t even been together a year. And it’s not like we won’t see each other. I can come and stay at Grimmauld every weekend. And you can come by the manor anytime you want. We can make it work.” He sounded like he was trying to talk himself into it as much as Harry.
Harry nodded. “That’s how I learned. And isn’t that what dueling is all about? You have your students practice until it’s instinct, too.”
“Yes.”
Malfoy’s gaze sharpened noticeably. “It’s her doing, not mine,” he answered. “She’s already naturally advanced. I just thought I’d help her take advantage of it.”
. There is a competition coming up this summer that I want Jaime to be ready for. Why would he waste his time on something he isn’t even going to use?”
Draco’s eyes flitted to Harry’s shy smile. “Hi.”
He dropped, letting out a sharp squeal before leveling out again and coming to a stop.
There were sounds of heavy footsteps in the hall, and Draco put down his book and stood. Dursley appeared then, making for the front door, but he stopped when he saw Draco. They stood there a moment.
Harry broke the gaze and turned to Ron, raising his half-full glass of beer. “I’m all set, mate, thanks.”
“What the bloody hell just happened?” Harry asked finally.
“I could teach you a few things,” Clint said, eyes twinkling. “If you were interested.”
“You need to be alone?”
“I don’t need Ogden’s for that,” Draco countered. “I could pull down my trousers right here and show the whole bar what a man I am.”
Harry gave him a small smile and then kissed his fingers. “Yes, I know. She and I are in quite different situations. It just makes me feel bad for her, is all. And a part of me wants to help, just like Teddy did for Liam because Liam was getting picked on at school. But on the other hand, I have so many things in my own life to worry about, so much to do and people to take care of…” He trailed off, looking guilty.
But Kemp was eventually satisfied with the progress in Harry’s stance, because he moved on, having Harry show him the spells he knew. He conjured an opponent for Harry, who appeared as a ghost-like image, clear and defined, but a little transparent. Harry went through his arsenal, occasionally stopped by Kemp in order to receive feedback. Some spells, like the Disarming charm, were near perfect (“Are we surprised?” Kemp had said with a smile. “That’s what you used to defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, is it not?”) while others were, according to Kemp, “sloppy.”
. Kyle swallowed back the bit of bile that had risen in his throat and looked them over. Draco and Potter walking down the streets of Diagon Alley, shoulder to shoulder; Draco and Potter sharing idle touches while they browsed for books in Flourish & Blotts; Draco leaning over to say something in Potter’s ear, and Potter smiling like he had a secret. And the finale, the Big One, the coup de grâce: Draco and Potter sharing ice cream at a table at Fortescue’s, staring at each other with more desire than was really decent to publish in a paper
“Lean guy, dark skin, about my height, or maybe a bit shorter.” Vesper took in Harry’s description with narrowed eyes, as if searching through a mental Rolodex. “Dry voice,” Harry went on. “Doesn’t smile a lot.”
Draco looked down at him, now completely naked, his cock red and waiting. There was an expression on his face that Harry thought might be awe. “Look at you,” Draco said. “You are so fucking beautiful. I can’t believe you belong to me.”
was the good joke. “She told me you were tall, cute, and completely brilliant. So far so good, I’d say.”
“Really?” Hermione beamed. That was quite good news. “Tell me.”
Mila smiled and thanked her, which, for her, was quite a compliment. Draco reminded himself to request Kim Haversham as the Mediwitch to assist with all of Mila’s exams. The more comfortable his patient felt, the better. He turned his attention back to the young woman in front of him.
“You think I’d do that? Really?” Hermione asked, fighting a smile.
Harry did, enjoying the sight of Draco writhing on the bed as he inserted three fingers this time. He’d never gotten to see his fingers actually move in and out of Draco like this, and it was incredibly erotic, especially knowing what came next.
“I thought I made that clear. I mean, I was
They came to their destination, a cozy little restaurant called
Neville smiled, seemingly in spite of himself. “You know, Harry, for someone who hates the spotlight so much, you make an awful lot of controversial choices that seem to keep you there.”
“He’s renovating his own house,” said David in disbelief. “You see, this is exactly what I’m talking about. I just learned more about Harry’s life in five minutes than I’ve ever learned in the three years of knowing him. He just…
“It might, or it might not,” Harry said. “I’m not sure yet.” He shifted, trying to get her to meet his eyes. “Why are you upset about this?”
More tears spilled, and Harry cleared them away. “Gods, and you were worried I was one-upping you,” he said, half joking, half earnest. “When all I gave you was a pair of cufflinks and you gave me your heart in a box.”
“It will be a late night for me Saturday,” Longbottom said, “But it’s worth it, for the breadth of the education the students will get, of course.” He turned to Harry. “Still, since I can’t do Saturday, maybe we could have drinks tonight instead? It’s been forever since I’ve been to the Three Broomsticks.”
“Merlin’s sweaty bollocks,” said Ron, and Hermione smacked him in the arm in admonishment.
“Likewise.” He returned the steady grip but didn’t crush her hand, as some more muscular men always seemed prone to do.
“There it is,” Harry said quietly, almost to himself. He moved his finger some more, and the feeling struck again, stronger and longer this time.
interact, I suppose. It refers to the mysteries of human attraction, what it is about another person that gets the blood pumping in our veins, you know?”
He said goodbye to Teddy with a wave, shaking his head to himself as he made his way out of the entrance hall. The boy was still as much of a rascal as ever, though somehow still all the more loveable for it. It was probably for the best, he realized, that Teddy could be so nonchalant about the fact that he basically had two of his parents teaching at his school. For a more self-conscious child, it could get difficult to navigate, but Teddy had taken it all in stride since his arrival at Hogwarts almost two years ago.
“First thing in the morning?”
After removing their jackets to get more comfortable, they cozied up on the loveseat, chatting idly as they systematically tried a bit of everything and compared their favorites. When a plate of bruschetta arrived not long after, Harry shook his head in disbelief.
“Why?”
He stood abruptly. He needed air. He couldn’t do this. He couldn’t stay. He turned his back on his friends, practically running for the doors. He barely registered Hermione’s cry of “Harry, wait!” followed by Ron saying, “Let him go, Hermione.” And then he was in the entrance hall, pushing at one of the large doors and bursting out into the gray morning.
Harry kissed him. “I could never assume that. But I’ll talk you through it. First, we need onions and garlic.”
Andromeda nodded. “We’ll see,” she said simply.
“And what are we thinking?” Draco asked with the arch of a brow.
“Yeah, maybe.” From Max’s tone, Kyle suspected that probably wasn’t going to happen.
dated girls. It wasn’t like I didn’t think women were beautiful. So…”
“And, above all, I’m proud of the fact that when I finally had good choices, when I finally had the chance to make my own future, that I chose you. You, Draco, are the best choice I ever made, and I can’t believe how lucky I am that you chose me back. I can’t believe how lucky I am that we fit together so well, that our history didn’t get in the way of us, but actually made us stronger. It helped us understand each other, the painful things and the joyful things. We built trust, honesty, and love out of all that history, and I really think that’s the most amazing, the most beautiful thing I’ve ever been a part of.
As he considered this Harry realized that he had been subconsciously looking again in Malfoy’s direction. He was joined by more Slytherins at the table now, namely Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott, the only other snakes who had elected to return to Hogwarts for their 8
“And if he doesn’t want to? If he never does?”
Harry was running a hand soothingly across Draco’s chest as he spoke again. “And this is your aunt. She’s your family. I just can’t imagine… you must be sad, and angry, and scared, and you’ve had to hold all that in. It’s not fair. You shouldn’t have had to deal with all of that alone.”
against the color scheme, it’s not even funny.”
“I couldn’t. Especially after hearing you refer to Kyle as your…
“We’ll have to tell our friends, though,” Harry pointed out. “I don’t know how the Slytherins will react, but I can tell you that the Gryffindors will have mixed feelings.”
“You think so?”
Harry nodded. “Friday. I wish it was sooner, but…” He cupped Draco’s jaw with one hand. “I’ll take what I can get.”
“Right, yeah. I mean, that’s essentially it. Aria and I are friendly and all, but we don’t have all that history. And I feel like that’s a good thing, maybe. But at the same time, I know that my feelings for Emilia are
Harry glanced up from the chess board to give Draco a skeptical glare. “Why do experienced chess players always say things like that, about how many moves are left in the game?”
“Well, what are you going to do, then?” he asked.
“I beg to differ.”
“Emptying into me? Filling me to the brim with your cum?”
much of anything. He can work some, he’s still inhibited by the arm.”
He danced some more as one song flowed easily into the next, as bodies flowed into each other, but he didn’t find himself drawn to anyone in particular. He decided to take a break, and when the dance floor finally spat him back out again he was back at the bar, where Potter still was, drinking and socializing.
His breaths were shaky, he knew. His hands were trembling as they ran along Harry’s shoulders. But he didn’t shy away; he didn’t close his eyes or turn his head. For this, he just let himself exist, open, exposed, and full.
Draco hesitated. “I’d hinder you more than help, probably. I know nothing about the culinary arts.”
Blaise looked at him archly. “Who says this was my doing?”
“I would say we have it in the bag anyway,” Draco replied, then grinned into his whiskey while the three Gryffindors around him scoffed in protest.
Draco shrugged, feeling strange and awkward, like he was suddenly on display. “I don’t know. I guess because I’ve been wondering how you felt about it. About children, I mean. And we hadn’t talked…”
Draco poured both of them two fingers of Ogden’s finest, handing Harry his glass. Then Draco joined him on the loveseat where Harry already sat, sitting much closer to him than he had during tea, close enough that their arms brushed occasionally.
Draco took a sip and nodded. “It’s exactly right. Thank you, Pipsy.”
“You did as good a job as anyone could have done under those circumstances,” Ron said. “The Healers told you that when you brought your parents back from Australia, remember? They said side effects were common and-“
“Very well,” he said, thinking. “Did I ever tell you about the time that Jamie Fletcher did some accidental magic and got his best mate’s hand stuck inside a football?”
“I remember a bit,” he said. “But only in flashes.”
They were both in nothing but their pants. Harry had insisted on it, saying it was all a part of the “lazy Sunday” experience.
Clint had dropped his wallet on the table in order to bring Kyle closer, and Kyle now had full access to him, even twisted towards each other in the booth as they were. He put a hand on Clint’s chest, feeling a thrill go through him at the solid muscle he found there. Clint’s mouth explored him, a tentative tongue coming out to swipe at his. Kyle opened his mouth to let him in the further, and thought he kiss deepened it was still slow and sweet, like they were discovering, taking their time.
“Don’t forget we have Teddy for dinner tonight,” Draco reminded him.
“Always so modest.”
“Oh, all right,” said Hannah. “The issue at hand, at the moment anyway, is that he’s not going to be around for the holidays. Usually we have Christmas with my father and then spend some time with his parents at the hospital. But apparently he’s not going to be able to make it to any of it. He says it’s because it’s his first year teaching at Hogwarts and there’s sort of an unspoken rule amongst the staff that the newer members stay behind to supervise the students who remained for the winter holidays. Neville says he feels… obligated to volunteer.”
“Oh,” said Teddy, as though this hadn’t occurred to him. “But you have lots of friends already.”
“It was my father’s expectation,” he said breezily. “My mother has always been more concerned with my happiness, thankfully. She knows about my sexuality, and she doesn’t care. And what with my father being locked up for the next twenty years, there’s hardly anything he can do. I am free to do as I wish. I suppose I have you to thank for that.”
“You do the renovations yourself?” No wonder progress had been slow.
“You don’t even know if that’s how he was feeling,” Kyle said. “You don’t even know him.”
“Because he
She was tired of waiting, and was just considering taking out her notebook and looking over her interview with Guensler when there was another knock on the door. She could tell, just by the slow, powerful rhythm, that it was Robards.
Kyle shrugged again. “I don’t know. I figure I have a while to think about it.”
Pansy wasn’t really a snob herself – Kyle did genuinely like her, in fact – but she had accumulated a lot of snobby acquaintances, and Kyle always found he didn’t have that much to say to them. It was hard to carry a conversation that lasted more than ten minutes. His usual MO at these events, then, was to stick close to Lindsey most of the time. That or talk to Pansy or her husband Theo, who was down to earth and not all that into small talk either, if he could help it.
to begin with.”
Harry and Draco met her positivity with encouragement and made a point of not mentioning Blaise again. Still, the information Draco had shared hung over the conversation, so much so that Harry was relieved that it was over, simply so he didn’t have to keep nodding emphatically and smiling just to keep up with Vesper’s determination to be chipper. It was painful, not because he didn’t want to encourage her, of course, but because he knew she was in pain, and he was powerless to help her.
“Where’s Hermione? I’m sure she’ll want to say ‘hello’ to him, too.”
He was just so sick of this, of feeling this way. Of feeling hurt and angry, feeling rejected, feeling like he didn’t fit, like he was always fucking up. He was sick of being the person that shitty things happened to, that had such a hard time finding the good in all of it. He was sick of being in the middle of this ridiculous life crisis and feeling like it was all he thought about and all anyone seemed to know about him.
“I wouldn’t have lost my job if I refused. I knew that.”
“Harry and Draco said that you’re taking me to Aunt Cissy’s house today,” Teddy said to Andromeda.
Potter took a step back, creating some distance between them, as if to be able to look at Draco fully. He sat against the edge of his desk, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Oh.” Harry didn’t know what to say. He supposed this was some kind of early birthday present that was also meant to serve as a peace offering, after how they’d left things at wine shop. Harry accepted the gift, savoring the small contact with Draco’s skin that he received when he took it. He supposed peace, and perhaps a future friendship, would be the best that he could hope for. “Thank you. But my birthday’s not for another three days.”
“Are you really going to nag me about eating on my birthday?” she asked with a little pout.
“Yeah, well,” Harry said, shuffling his feet a little in embarrassment. “I guess it’s a bit of a sore spot even so, since I nearly lost us the match and all.”
Harry was all for it, especially now that he knew what it felt like. His blood was humming; he felt jittery and excitable and unable to contain himself. A quiet moment with Draco was exactly what was called for.
is under the impression that you two are an item,” she said, before immediately biting her tongue. She had not meant to admit that she had been reading up on him. In fact, she hadn’t meant to even
Thank you for the incredible comments and all the encouragement. There's still some strong feelings about the Hermione situation, I see, but that's ok! I still really appreciate you sharing your thoughts.
“Is that what you wanted to do, research and experiment with potions?”
Turning back around, Scorpius held the piece of chicken out to Harry instead.
Harry chuckled, finding that sentiment easy to relate to. “Ron will look out for you, too, though. He won’t tolerate that sort of thing for long.”
Hermione laughed, although she had to admit, at least to herself, that the thought of shrimp cocktail and cheese puffs was quite appealing to her as well. Luckily, many in their party seemed to agree, and they made their way towards the food.
Eamon lit his wand, much to Vesper’s satisfaction. She could see the room much more clearly now, and make out the lines of worry etched into Eamon Parrish’s face.
Pansy gave him a surprised look, but their waiter had arrived to take their order and she didn’t have the opportunity to reply. They ordered food and a bottle of wine (“I’m off duty,” Draco insisted, when Pansy asked with merely the suggestive tilting of her head), and the waiter bowed and said “Very good” before flitting away and leaving them to themselves.
They were.
“How’s research with the ferret going, then?” Ron asked over breakfast. “I didn’t even see you come back to the common room last night.”
“Yes, really. Granger just probably wanted to see what it was like, to be sure she was making the right choice.”
She was the only woman in the class, for one thing. This surprised her immensely, since she’d heard countless stories from Harry and Ron both about female Aurors they’d known over the years, particularly Nymphadora Tonks, little Teddy Lupin’s birth mother, who had been exceptional, by all accounts. Vesper had readily assumed that the Auror Corps would be an equal opportunity employer, since magical skill and pure nerve were much more important than physical strength when it came to success in this line of work.
“You picked out a dress finally?” Pansy said, looking genuinely enthused. “Tell me all about it.”
Draco stared some more, unwilling to say aloud what he was thinking.
Draco kept the pressure hard, putting his whole body into it, but he waited until Potter put his arms around his waist, showing how much he wanted this, before he opened his mouth and deepened the kiss. Potter moaned and Draco took advantage, delving his tongue inside as Potter pressed their bodies together, his hands coming up to grip Draco’s shoulder blades.
Draco shook his head. “What happens now?”
“Ok, no, listen. Have you
“I feel like I kept saying the wrong thing, like it was a test that I was failing.”
. I think we should send Teddy to stay with someone for the weekend and just stay in at Grimmauld. We’ll have the house elf by then who can cook and clean for us and we can just talk and relax and shag and only go out if we feel like it.”
“Things aren’t always what they appear to be,” said Draco. “She may very well have feelings she isn’t acting on because she doesn’t think
“You looked like you were going to be sick, mate,” Ron chimed in.
“Thanks,” Kyle said. “I’ll keep that in mind. Mostly I’d just rather not talk about him anymore.”
“Good,” said Potter. His face softened again, a hand reaching up to brush his fingers along Draco’s thoroughly ravished lips. They sparked under the touch. “Don’t ever forget it.”
Draco considered that. “I can’t remember.”
Ron opened his mouth and closed it again, his wide eyes making him look like a beached fish.
He decided seeking out Malfoy in his classroom was the best way. Classes would be out and they could chat alone. Harry had no interest in offering this invitation with others listening in, and he suspected Malfoy would resent him for giving him the pressure of an audience as well.
“Why not?”
“Right, Buckbeak.”
He found his boyfriend mostly awake, and he smiled to himself, knowing that Harry had been waiting for him before he got out of bed. Draco sat on the edge, within arm’s reach of the other man, a warm glow of affection alight in his stomach as he looked down at the brunet. Harry looked back up at him with half-lidded green eyes and a sleepy smile, unaware, as always, of how effortlessly handsome he was, all roguish and tousled.
“But only because the idea that you would need
Harry took him happily, kissing him on the head and humming in agreement as Teddy babbled some nonsense at him and then grabbed his bottom lip. Harry laughed and blew a raspberry into the tiny palm, which quickly had Teddy in giggles, and the boy’s mousy brown hair turned a shade of black the same as Harry’s. Harry couldn’t help but grin at Teddy’s burgeoning Metamorphmagus abilities. “Come on and sit down,” Harry said to Andromeda. “Have you had lunch yet?”
Harry, feeling dizzy, or maybe just giddy from both relief and an overwhelming joy, followed Draco’s slightly tugging hand, walking beside him down the aisle.
scar his skin was smooth and pristine. So he simply drank in that gaze as he removed his shoes and socks and undid his trousers, letting them fall to the floor. He was determined to stand before Harry as unabashed as the Gryffindor, even as his pants were removed and his hard, bobbing cock came free and stood at attention.
“I would, but I’m expected in my quarters for lunch. A weekend tradition, you know, when neither of us is on duty.”
“We played our part, yes.” Draco was unwilling to say more than that. Some day, when Teddy could understand the nuance of such things, he would explain.
Kyle’s hand reached up automatically, at first running down the center of Clint’s broad chest before gripping into his shirt. It was enough to bring Clint forward those last inches, and their mouths met.
-fall off a cliff, and he was already teetering close to the edge as it was.
Harry thought as he remained prostrate on the sofa, his needy, bereft erection screaming in protest.
“Mm,” said Draco noncommittally.
“Yeah, he’s good about that.” She searched Declan’s face, finding it hard to read. “Why, does your partner not have yours?”
Clint grinned, turning his head just so, their faces barely inches apart. “Exactly.”
“Exactly,” Draco replied. “We’re here now.”
“Not by much,” Draco grumbled.
He was grateful to the Weasleys for accepting him as a part of their family, but he had to admit that by the afternoon, most of his mind was on getting himself to Malfoy Manor and seeing Draco again. He was glad when all the present opening was done and he could sneak upstairs to pack and freshen up, so that he was presentable for Christmas dinner with Narcissa.
“The color is starting to change. It’s bluer than before. More blue than gray, now.”
“Asking me for a second date before the first one is even finished… that’s not exactly playing it cool, you know,” she teased.
“Good morning,” he replied, noticing that Potter had glanced up from his conversation with Vector to look at him. Draco’s stomach flipped as their eyes met, as Potter licked his lips unconsciously, as if remembering the kiss, before he bit his bottom lip and turned back to hear what Vector was saying. Draco sat down, reminding himself to breathe.
Inside was a pair of cufflinks, oval in shape with flat faces, featuring inlaid designs made with intertwining shapes of silver and gold. Or, when he looked more closely at the small description, white gold and yellow gold. The design on each was different, and Draco traced the one on the left with a soft finger. It was a dragon. The other was a stag.
“What does it say?” Draco asked, leaning to read over Harry’s shoulder.
“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry whispered against that sweet mouth. He pulled away, cast a quick cleaning charm on himself, redid his zipper, and grabbed his robes from off the floor.
“You’re exaggerating.”
“That’s not true!” said Harry, indignant.
“It’s all right. You said enough that I understood. I ended things with Kyle not long after that, you know.”
If he was bothered by her lack of greeting or preamble, he didn’t show it. He merely set down his quill and looked up from his paperwork, fixing her with his usual sharp stare.
She laughed delicately. “I don’t think so.”
“Indeed. I’d love to see you with a vibrator in your arse sometime.”
“Knowledge, information, is neither good nor evil by itself, Miss McNeal,” he said. She stared at him, unblinking. “It’s only when we bring intention into it, when we start to use that knowledge for our own purposes, that we enter into questions of ethics. You should not be afraid of what you learn. You have the courage of your convictions. You will not hurt someone else by simply knowing what you know, not if you have no intention to.”
She watched his face silently.
him to indulge, to say aloud all the dirty things he liked.
‘Yes, Draco.’
It’s the last thing you expect, but he’s the one to come looking for you the next time. And the next. It becomes a thing.
Just a random curiosity: The therapist is named Mirna (which was the first name that popped in my mind), but I later found out that Mirna is a serbian/croatian name that means peaceful. :) Nice, isn't it?
‘Crap. Scratch that. I mean. It’s the fucking truth, but that’s not it,’ Potter laughs. He looks a bit deranged. ‘Well, not
‘What?’
Green is the color of hope.
‘This was a fucking mistake,’ he says as he turns to leave.
Sweet oblivion.
I begin to fall backwards, my wand dropping down to the floor. He grabs the front of my robes and pulls me up. I taste his breath on my lips. I only know one wandless spell, but it’s a vicious one. I forced myself to learn it during the War, in case I ended up cornered, wandless and needing to escape.
Draco stared in silence at Josh.
He’s so close I can see the shape of his mouth forming the blunt words. He’s taken to calling me Draco, instead of Malfoy. He does it in & out of bed. It’s annoying & incredibly appealing & it fucking unhinges me.
His eyes make a slow trip of you. You blush like it’s your first time under the hands of a man, even if it’s not.
‘There was this hot bloke,’ I say. My words come out slurred, slow, but I can’t stop them from coming. ‘He tried to pull me. He actually did… pull me, I mean,’ I smile and look up at Harry and he’s looking back at me. There’s something hopeless about him. It’s as if he’s been expecting this for a long time. ‘He had really nice hair. Neat. Tidy hair.’
It’s so blunt, it shouldn’t be so hot. Your eyes drop to the line of his crotch.
‘It has come to my attention recently, that it might be a very logical reason for his… behaviour.’
, he wanted to say, but his throat closed down on him. They stayed like that, silent, Harry’s forehead resting against his, their hands skating over each other.
His only answer is a dry, ironic laugh. I take a drag of my cigarette. He folds his arms, his jaw tense.
Because I was on self-imposed house arrest for anything other than work. He just stares at me. I release the chair and go around the table, staggering slightly. I feel colder by the minute and all the more purposeful.
She laughs, loud and clear, and
There was no way to keep the sound inside. It was out: a deep needy moan. Malfoy’s hands wrapped around his hip bones. Because they could. Because Harry was his. He leaned back, the touch of Malfoy’s clothes against the sensitive skin of his arse making him float.
‘He - he got violent-’ I say in a whisper. ‘Threw me against the wall and he forced himself on-’ it all flashes before my eyes again. I make myself look at Harry’s clear green eyes.
He hadn’t brought any of his instruments and he didn’t need them. Not with Harry anyway. But the idea of Harry completely naked but for a collar around his throat was too damn arousing.
The song changes. Upbeat and indecent. Like the way he moves. He doesn’t care one bit what anyone thinks. His white shirt clings to his chest, collar open carelessly, sleeves rolled up to his elbows. My eyes search and find what they’re looking for: his tattoos, flowers along his inner left forearm, part of a dragon curling on his right. The intricate drawings stand out, black on his skin, stalks and scaly tail alike curling over the bones on his sleek wrists. Both disappear under his sleeves and again I want to know what else’s under there. More flowers; the rest of the dragon, I think. Probably climbing up his arm, its wing unfurling on his back? I keep imagining it differently every time. Maybe his whole back is covered by the wing, thin membranes going down his spine. I see it arching back, moving, under my hands. The thought doesn’t even scare me anymore. Now it just is.
His brain was struggling to catch up. Malfoy had noticed him? Or was this just provocation, something he would say to drive Harry to the edge? Why did it matter?
I feel loose, lost to the music, green eyes on every fucking inch of my body. I catch him looking at my tattoos and lift my arms to brush my hair back. He follows the movement. My heart beats to the rhythm, an invisible line drawn between me and him, the world beating loud around us.
Instants later, another boy exits the castle. He runs after the first boy.
‘On Josh. I have to know what I’m buying.’
‘I'm off. Firecall me tomorrow? See you, Potter.’
‘I know what a fucking back door implies,
He looks completely different from the playboy or the hero. Like I’m meeting him for the first time, even though we’ve known each other our whole lives. He seems about to say something, but stops himself. Weirdly, I feel I’m about to cry. He leans in closer, brushes his mouth against my lips again.
“Ok, Order of Merlin First Class,” Blaise drawled.  “Just don’t do anything on my bed.”
Justin grinned.  “Advada, Fuck, Marry.  Draco, Blaise,” the others began to laugh, “Pansy.”
Harry shoved Draco off of him, “Fuck off, Malfoy.”
Malfoy didn’t look back at him which was irritating as it made it impossible to know what the hell he was thinking.  “To Draco Malfoy the Biggest Prick.”
The 8th years had all been housed together in a suite of rooms towards the bottom of the astronomy tower.  It had become a habit of his to climb to the top when he was overwhelmed.  Harry wasn’t sure what he would do when he reached the top, but he didn’t want to spend the rest of the night resisting touching Malfoy and wanting to kiss him.  It wasn’t a new thought.  Ever since Ginny broke up with him in October, he had been questioning his sexuality.  Malfoy had always been in his thoughts, and Malfoy was good looking, so it only made sense to fantasize about him.  But that’s all they were: fantasies.
“Dare,” Harry said.
Harry laughed and followed him.  “Yes?”
“Bugger off, Malfoy,” Harry said without moving, but his entire body reacted like he had been shot with adrenaline.  “I’m tired.”
“Hardly news,” Blaise muttered.
“Mmm, very astute,” Draco said as he snuck his hands under Harrys shirt.
If the floor weren’t cold, hard stone, Harry would have collapsed onto the ground.  Draco grabbed his pants and trousers and pulled them back up.  Harry pulled him into a kiss, startled by the salty taste of his own cum, he pulled back.  “I don’t want to be your friend, Draco.”
“I know,” Harry said.  He brought his hand to Draco’s face and ran his thumb across his soft pink lips.  “I don’t care.” Draco tried to look away, but Harry wouldn’t let him.  “We all did stupid things because the adults around us failed us.  I got Sirius killed, my own godfather.”
“Who did you lose your virginity to?” Padma picked up her cup and drank. Parkinson smiled.  “Typical.”  A few of the guys snorted, and Parvati looked slightly annoyed on her sister’s behalf.
“Truth.”  Harry groaned in frustration, or did he?  Was that out loud? Fuck.  Malfoy was smirking, his arms once more crossed over his chest.  The glass of fire whiskey was hitting hard, and all Harry could think about was the triangle of skin at Malfoy’s neck.  It should be illegal for him to have his shirt unbuttoned like that.
Harry led Draco over to where the alcohol was, realizing in that moment that they had left a half drunk bottle of Fire Whiskey at the top of the Astronomy Tower which he would have to fetch in the morning.  Without letting go of Draco’s hand, he poured a glass of Gavant’s Hard Butterbeer.
“If you two are done with your little moment,” Parkinson said annoyed, “then the rest of us would like to return to our game.”
“Shut up, Pansy,” Malfoy said in a drawl.  “Let Potter finish.  The game sounds terribly fascinating.  Unless you somehow still have work after four days of being locked in this place that you would rather go do.”
“No,” Harry said before he had time to think.  “I don’t want to be friends.”  Malfoy stepped back, his eyes wide.  Before he could go any further, Harry reached out and grabbed his arms.  He pulled the other boy towards him and brought their lips together.  He moved one of his hands into Draco’s hair and smiled to discover that it was even softer than he had imagined it.
“Ah yes,” Malfoy sauntered further into the room.  “The agony of living is incredibly exhausting.”
“Oh,” Harry said.  Malfoy stepped closer.  “Anything, er, in particular?”
“What about Truth or Dare?” Harry found himself saying.  Hermione and Ron laughed next to him remembering when they had taught the game to the Wealseys one summer evening.  A few other students grinned, but most of them looked confused.
“Oh good,” Draco said, and he pulled Harry down in a hard kiss.
Harry broke his eye contact with Malfoy to look at Hermione.  “Living is agony if you forget why you’re living.” He looked back a Malfoy, who refused to look anything but sure of himself.  “That’s what it was like to die.” Harry paused, then said.  “Truth or dare, Malfoy?”
“And tomorrow we can talk about how I meant everything I’ve said to you tonight.”  Draco pulled his sweater up and Harry let it com off over his head.  “But right now, I’m going to ravish you.”
The moon and stars were out lighting up the castle and grounds.  Harry leaned against the ice-cold glass of the doors and sighed.  He had defeated Voldemort, the Ministry under Kingsley was rounding up remaining Death Eaters, and the 8th years were practically having an orgy in the new age of House cooperation.  What did it mean to be the Boy Who Lived now that they had won?  Harry threw back a sip of the drink he was still carrying.
Malfoy released Harry’s sweater.  “I dare you to be friends with me.”
The eighth year dorms were small since it didn’t even need to house a full year of students, yet confined as they were, everyone seemed to be in each other’s way.  At last Ernie Macmillan had rallied a large group to the common room where they were currently engaged in a debate on what game they should play.  Justin Finch-Fletchley suggested a Wizard’s Chess tournament, and Padma Patil mentioned Exploding snap which was shot down by Parvati and Lavender.  Seamus didn’t say much of anything, but sat next to Dean with his arms crossed across his chest.
“Ok fine, but only because it will piss everyone off.”  Draco still wasn’t meeting Harry’s eyes.
“Ask Thomas out or stop asking so jealous anytime the rest of us poofs take advantage of what you aren’t.”  Seamus sputtered angrily, but Dean grinned, kissed him and said, “Yes, please.”
They were an odd group.  Despite having spent the last two months living together, it was still awkward to try and forget old rivalries and prejudices.  Harry, however, didn’t have the energy to care about house politics anymore.  Usually they were busy enough with their studies that awkward situations could easily be avoided.  However, it was now the fourth day that classes had been cancelled due to the constant rain, sleet, and snow storms plaguing most of the castle where the charms meant to fix the damaged walls and rooves had broken down.  House elves had been bringing meals to the common rooms to which students were restricted while the teachers and a dispatch from the Ministry worked on solving the problem.
Malfoy shrugged and tossed back another swallow.  He walked away and ran his fingers along the large metal hoops of the statue at the center of the tower.  “To Harry Potter the Boy Who seemed to enjoy me kissing him.”
“Truth,” Padma said.
Was this meant to be serious or seduction?  Harry was desperately trying to not be incredibly turned on but he could smell the scent of Malfoy’s, no doubt very expensive, cologne.  “Er, do you, um, regret anything, Draco?”
The sensation of Malfoy’s soft lips on his and the way his tongue had flicked in and out of his mouth filled his mind.  Harry picked up the pace as he climbed the stairs trying to forget the feel of Malfoy’s hands on his body.  When Harry finally summited the staircase, he was met by the gloriously cold, fresh Scottish air.  The drafty nature of the room had made Astrology lessons in his early years dreadful during the winter months, but it suited well for a good sobering up.
Draco hesitated before deciding.  “Dare.”
Harry smirked.  “What was it like to be saved by me, twice?”
Draco released him and began to race down the stairs.  Harry grinned and followed, pinning him against the wall for another kiss when he caught him.  They all but fell down the stairs together between kisses, until at last they reached the landing with the door to the 8th year dormitory.  Harry traced the iron shape which was mounted on the door and the lock clicked open.
Harry climbed on top of Malfoy and felt his body shudder beneath him.  “Draco Malfoy, I’m drunk and you’re drunk.”
Harry stood up and went over to where the alcohol collection had grown and poured fire whiskey into a cup.  With the fresh cup he turned to go back to his seat, but Malfoy had leaned backwards on his arms filling in his spot.  The blonde turned and stared at him.  Harry took a swig and looked away.  Justin was attempting to transfigure his cup into a butt plug.  A dare curtesy of Ernie.
‘I can see that.’
His question makes you feel like he’s allowing you to take the lead, even though it’s probably just the proper wizarding etiquette.
‘I guess he also doesn’t know me as well as he thinks.’ I mutter.
‘Do I need to tell you that this conversation never happened?’
‘What conversation?’
‘No,’ I say. My breath quickens. ‘But you want me.’
Drop.
He gets up, turns his back on me and walks away. I wait. I start the count to a hundred. I tell myself I need to wait. But I’m only on fifty when I get up and follow him.
‘The only exception is when their mouth is so busy they can’t.’
He saw the vicious look on Malfoy’s face, satisfaction and arousal seared into his eyes.
‘Draco. I’m sorry. Malfoy. Fuck. Please,’ he was babbling, out of his mind.
‘Yes.’
I hold his hand and wait for him to go on. But he just shakes his head and smiles faintly.
Harry’s Dom, Josh, was waiting for some sort of answer on his part, and he sure wasn’t leaving before he was satisfied. The fact that Josh had followed him, when he was about to leave, opened an array of possibilities large enough for Draco to drown in; possibilities he had spent the last week - plus two very long, excruciating hours at the club,- dismissing one by one, convincing himself that they were unrealistic, downright
Harry trembled at the sound of his name and that voice. He couldn’t move, the only thing he could feel was the gentle caress of Draco’s hands on his left leg, up and down, soothing, so gentle after all the pain, almost caring…
‘Good.’
He lifted his hand, his fingers tangling on the dark hair. Harry did not make a sound when Draco tilted his head up. And he did not make a sound when Draco’s lips brushed over his. And he did not make a sound when, for a moment, their lips stayed like that, paused in featherlike agony.
But you still have his taste on your mouth.
To put it simply: his type is me.
‘But you like fighting me-’
‘No.’ You say.
‘Don’t be a jerk. They were just a game, Draco. I didn’t even want to- all those men, they were just this thing, to get to you. You’re insufferable and arrogant and-’
Harry held his breath, looking at Draco.
The look he gives me is half perfect satisfaction, half perfect challenge.
His eyes are turned upwards to the sky. His face is dripping wet.
I hope you had a wonderful time reading this story. Thank you for all the comments and support of my writing :) Take care*
You feel like laughing, really.
. The bastard had the nerve to use the damned word.
‘Fuck.’ Dark green eyes flashed at him. ‘You know I do. It’s all I think about.’
He comes over to me, up close & personal.
‘Please.’
Draco almost laughed at the comparison. Harry had always been a great flyer. More than. It was all about confidence. The sureness in his every movement. Like now. Draco watched him move closer to Josh, knees scraping on the carpeted floor. Josh spread his thighs, allowing Harry to shuffle closer between them, as he started to unbutton his jeans, then moved to unzip the rest.
‘What can I say…’ He smiles. I quickly look away. ‘Old habits die hard.’
There’s a hint of a smile there, when he looks at me. I’m still coming to terms with the fact that this is the longest we’ve talked to each other out of bed. Or in it, for that matter. So I say nothing.
‘Nothing else?’
Harry looked thoroughly disheveled and delicious, hair messy and perfect to be tugged at. Draco wanted to make Harry look at him. But the minute he’d touch Harry he’d be hard pressed to stop. And there was something to be said of the pleasure Draco felt in denying them both a bit longer.
‘I love the way you beg,’ he drowned in Malfoy’s voice, so low it sounded more like a grunt. ‘You’re being so good to me. You’re my pain whore, aren’t you?’
‘I'm off. Firecall me tomorrow? See you, Potter.’
He waits. His hand waits under mine. My heart blows up on my chest.
‘We don’t have to talk about it,’ he says, matter-of-factly.
‘Oh please, please… Malfoy… please, I’ll be good, so good for you.’
‘Don’t you want me?’ I ask, and I know exactly how I look like now, needy and desperate.
‘Come to mine?’
The door opens and I’m left there, with my hand still up in the air, rain falling on my hair, cold seeping through me. I can only see half of his face, one green eye, half a mouth, half disheveled hair. He looks half good.
‘Yes,’ he breathed over Draco’s cock.
The world turns pitch dark.
I’m not sentimental, but this might be the happiest day of my life.
altering.
Then he looks up, his eyes bright. That fire I thought was all but gone is there again.
I pretend to consider it, when in fact there’s nothing to consider. Potter doesn’t want to go home with that Muggle, no matter how hot he is, no matter how much he’d look good sucking Potter’s cock, no matter how much he looks like me. No matter how much they
With my eyes closed and his body against mine, I finally let go.
Harry Potter… he’s going to ruin me.
‘I don’t want their cocks.’
We always make a big deal out of first times.
‘I thought we had been through this,’ Malfoy said. The confident smirk was there in an instant, robbing all coherent thought from Harry’s mind. ‘When I ask you a question I want an honest answer.’
‘Yes. Like they all do,’ he says in a rough voice.
He tastes sweet, but there’s an edge to him, to the way he kisses. I want that edge like I want everything about him. I feel so lightheaded I have to pull back slightly.
‘So do you,’ I say, not thinking.
‘I could keep doing this the whole night...’ his words vibrated against his hole. He could feel that damned smirk on Malfoy’s face. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for that smile.
‘You’re holding back,’ Malfoy said, voice demanding, cracking at the edges of the words.
‘Again.’ You say.
You never drop.
Then Josh gagged Harry. A thin stripe of black leather, with a red circle in the center. Harry’s mouth opened obediently to accommodate it.
Edit: the actual hair colour is more turquoise than blue. But I believe Harry wouldn't, for the life of him, know how to distinguish between blue and turquoise, and since this is his POV... but I added Draco saying turquoise anyway, he knows his colours :)
I’ll also deny letting him dress me in those horrible pyjamas. They’re actually the most comfortable thing I ever wore.
My voice echoes shrill and loud in the house. I feel him right behind me.
It was hard to not let it get to his head - but he’d lost that battle almost immediately. It had gotten to his head and to his cock, and way too fast. He didn’t want to say it had gotten to his heart. That would be pitiful. He prized himself on not letting that organ - or better, its most commonplace
At the edge of his vision, Ron saw Harry's head drop to the countertop.
"So, you know about last night," Draco said, his smile perfunctory.
"Yes, you did.  Now… shall we?" Severus purred as he held out his hand, and Harry nodded dumbly as his insides dissolved into goo.
"…you for giving your speech.   I know we haven’t always been on best terms, but hopefully we can move past that."  Minister Scrimgeour dropped his hand and went to address the gathering people.  Harry stood there dumb, watching after the retreating man.
"And of which whom are we speaking?"  Severus knew exactly where this conversation was leading to, and in a way it pleased him.   He'd been watching Draco for so long; it was amazing to see the young man finally admit he might have been wrong.  That perhaps things weren't black and white and designed along the lines of his father's thinking.
"Yes, Voldemort was an evil, bad man.  But you killed him.  He's gone.  He has no more power, no hold on anyone.  And thank you for that, by the way.  I never did that; thank you."  He watched as Tufts paced back and forth along the length of his office, bob tail flicking to and fro.
As he took his place behind the speaker's stand and lifted up his mostly empty glass, he scanned the mass of people.  Wizards and witches from all over, from all generations, looked up at him, most with awe, some with a less enthusiastic response, only a few with disdain, or at least only a few who would openly show their disdain.  All had eyes on him.
Draco's expression morphed to scepticism.  "Harry, I don't think so.  See…" He flipped up the hood.  "There are no mechanics in the front.  Terrible shrinking job if that's the case.  I think," he took on the tone of someone explaining the non-existence of Santa Claus, "it is actually a toy."  His voice was filled with such tenderness, like he hated breaking the bad news to Harry, that Harry barely kept his face straight.  He blinked, nodding in understanding.
“I did.”
Draco's eyebrows bunched together.  "Well, you're not hissing."
The repeated "deeply sleep" faded as they put more and more walls between them and their exit.  It was like a desperate sign warning that they were descending deeply into the demon's den.  Draco swallowed against a lump in his throat.
, but… I… I want something and I feel like a part of me is missing.  Why is a part of me missing?"  Draco rolled over.  He had a scrunched up face and red eyes.  The Draco he knew, long ago, the unbroken version of this man, would never have let anyone see him cry.
"Nothing.  Well, he was here, but he ran.  We couldn't catch him.  Though you better contact the local Aurors because his place is full of Dark magic and corpses."  Tufts growled over his shoulder.
Maybe they could lay a trap for him with snake treats.  She hadn’t thought of that.
When Snape returned it was to two boys yelling "Surprise!" quick hugs from each of them and a lopsided lemon concoction.  He scowled delightedly, and ate the cake.
"You don't sound fine.  Come on, just tell me."
"Mum, is that man going to hurt us?"
Harry had a headache of the severity only a case of home brewed moonshine could have induced.
After his disastrous meeting with Draco Malfoy, Harry had gone back to Kingsley and convinced his friend to help him.  Harry knew he had to speak with Draco, that his childhood nemesis knew
wards, and this sent chills up his spine.  He drew his wand, casting a few wordless shielding and detection spells and finally sent his consciousness
Two whole days.
He looked to Harry, then to Remus. "Come on, we're leaving." Both men turned their heads to face him, looking completely lost and unsure. Fine. Let them fall into a crevice of despair, let
"No need to rush things?" Harry exploded.  "You show up at Hermione's hospital room pushing this Debt in my face, offering me a deciphered scroll then walking out.  You show up here, asking about that damned Debt again.
He snorted, frustrated.  "Fine."
"I already did," Harry admitted, wiping away at the moisture, creating a clean patch on the back of his wrist.  "I'd already given up, then you had to go and be nice to me.  How fucking pitiful.  Voldemort should have won."  Harry rolled onto his stomach.
"The fight, the contest, the argument.  We've been rivals for so long… and then he started following me around like a damned puppy.  Like a lackey.  What a put off.  I missed the fight. I didn't want a fan club… well, not in a lover.  I wanted someone… " Draco's words faded into the quiet night.
"This is going to take a while. I'll make some tea." Draco stood, turning to the cupboard that held the tea. Another day with Potter. Perhaps it would be a good day. Perhaps there were new possibilities he hadn't even considered.
Harry immediately jumped away from Aiden as he looked over to those piercing, gray eyes.  The usual cool façade burned away by an inner fire that sent an unexpected spark down Harry's spine.
He hated his life.
Like a ragdoll, her bones go soft within her frame; her head rolls over and she spots Pansy, a wicked gleam to her eye.  'It is really too bad,' Luna thinks in her last moment.  She'd always thought Pansy beautiful, proud.  One of her teeth has been replaced with a diamond and it shimmers like a miniature star when her head is turned just right and the sun washes her in brilliance.  She'd have done far better as one of Harry's crew--
"Milk or sugar?" came from the kitchen.
Right there, before Draco's eyes, is the end.  The end of the violence, the end of death.  Kill one insane man, no, half of a man, to save many.  Could he condone such a thing?
"Lost when you destroyed Voldemort's headquarters.  Proving, by the way, that subtlety has never been your strong point.  Most of us escaped the inferno, but much was lost.  I suppose in the long run that proved a good thing.  The Dark Lord's experiments were lost too."  Harry watched him to see if he would notice the slip of the old name.  Apparently, he didn't.
Harry snorted. "I want this, too.”
The plume in her hat bobs in a playful breeze, but Luna's eyes hold no sway for any ridicule.  Draco dips his head in acknowledgment.  She continues their stroll, her voice reverting to the airhead tone he's used to.
"Did you want to eat something?" the older man asked.
The fairy glared.  "First, you must entertain the Queen."
And right there, Pansy is free.
Scorpius would never have performed such a public display.  Perhaps it was a girl thing, he wasn't quite sure, but he was certain a well behaved child like his own would not put on such a performance.
When he returned, wrapped up in a single, thin towel—they didn't even have robes for the guests!—Tufts sat up and looked at him.
He didn't know how to say that something had gone rotten inside.  He was afraid that it'd almost seemed easier back in their cage.  He didn't have to make these choices; he didn't have to feel passed over.
Draco's hand reached the head, his wrist jerked with a quick twist, and Harry's head fell back again, groaning, gasping for air.  The suction on his neck was maddening.  The fast, smooth slide created delirious ecstasy, and he never wanted it to end.
He had too many memories locked away there, stuffed in those far reaches of his mind. He didn’t want to dredge them up. He didn't want to roll the past around in his mind, study it or analyze it in any way. That was old hat. The past was past, a faded moment that would never happen again. His lessons were earned with the pain of living, and he didn't want to examine that bill again.
Draco shrugged.  "Discovered it two years ago in a Go Back case.  I read up on the law before we came here."  As bad as Hermione.  Really, he should have been the top student of their year, if it weren't for other regrettable circumstances.  But he'd long given up dwelling on that.
"Draco!"
"Yeah!" she squealed.  "I'm so happy for you, Harry!"  She looked over at Draco and continued to smile, happy as an oblivious clam.
"Draco," he said in a soothing voice.  The very voice he used to calm rampant griffins and dangerous dragons.
"I want to do a stakeout in Darren's field and see if we can find out how his sheep are going missing."  The way he rushed out the words, Draco bet he'd been reciting it over and over in his head over the last five minutes.
Greg shook his head. "I never saw it. Just that it was a crystal ball, but smaller than the normal kind. Carrow's friend told him it was palm sized. What's goin' on?"
"Draco," Harry whimpered at the apparition.
Snape nodded.  "Yes, and I think Potter should be the first to try it."  Snape's grin exposed enough teeth in a fashion that unnerved even Draco, and CatBoy took a step behind him, his tail whipping against the back of Draco's leg.
The whistling was terribly off tune, but it followed a familiar beat.  Then it turned into a high-pitched humming, sounding like a child mimicking a melody he'd heard while half asleep.
"Fine," Arthur finally agreed. Gesturing to Mad-Eye, he said, "You and I will climb up on the left and Remus and Tonks can escape on the right through the forest. Each group will wait at the rock pile by the birch trees for a maximum of fifteen minutes before they continue on to the main camp. If the others don't show, move on." Remus nodded. He, more than anyone else here, knew how important it was that he reach the ritual site. He wouldn't wait. He had created the Suppression Net ritual with Hermione, and it had to be thirteen. One person less and he wasn't certain it would hold Voldemort. Luckily they did have substitutes trained, but Remus did not want to miss it. He needed to ensure that everything was in place, that the spell was correctly cast.
But over time, he did gain standing and independence.  He became the prince of the Death Eaters, a title he bore with ease.  Cold and calculating, the young Slytherin worked his way into the cliques and under the gaze of the salient members.  But his past transgressions would never truly be forgotten, not where it really counted.  The Dark Lord never trusted him again, and Draco knew this with every ounce of acumen he possessed.  At night it gave him a deep sense of relief.
Harry didn't want to think about that battle.  He didn't want to think about any of the battles.  He had to confess though, that the attack on the Death Eater command centre could have been planned better.  "We didn't warn you?" he asked, concerned.  He knew that Snape had survived and figured they had informed him of the surprise air strike.
"Any idea who lies behind all of it?"
"Holy Hell, Remus.  This is enough stock to make even Snape giggle in glee.  A maniacal giggle, I'm sure, but a giggle nonetheless."  Harry began helping Remus unpack the crate.
He looked at Harry, whose face was only inches from his, with wide eyes.
He brushed his bangs out of his eyes and casually waved his hand through the air.  It was all trivial, anyway.  He pulled out his wand and pointed it at the sand.  "
"Sirius," he whispered into the dark side of midnight.
Snape spun around, his unseeing eyes staring blankly out into space.  "Draco, are you talking to your doll again?"
"Oh, Harry.  Malfoy.  How are you two doing?"  Her voice was high and friendly.  Maybe it was because he was with Draco, and she was trying to be nice for his case.  Ah, he loved Hermione.
"Tell me what you know, and I'll pay you what it's worth." Remus jangled his pocket, sounding the Galleons resting there, all from Sirius' old vault, now in Harry's name.
Harry looks serene, at peace with himself and the world.
"But he's a Death Eater!" Ron called out as Harry asked, "But how'd he find you?"
undercover; it wouldn't do to stay at the fanciest hotel. He was sure properly greased palms would allow even Tufts in, but he was on a job, he couldn't flounce around like he normally would have.
"When people die," Harry tried another angle, "worms eat out their eyes.  And their nose goes pretty quick, too."
Harry grins and plunges two fingers into the mash, picks up a glob, licks off the potatoes, squishes it around in an attempt at chewing, and then swallows it down.  Draco watches him, nose crinkled, but all judgment locked away.  "Hmm, tasty," Harry murmurs as he sucks his fingers clean, very slowly and very thoroughly.
During one battle towards the tail end of the war, Harry found out the real reason for Draco’s attitude.  Draco didn’t necessarily feel better than everyone, but separate.  Harry realized that this alienation the young Malfoy had felt caused him to appear condescending and snide towards the world.  A defense mechanism.  In a way, it was something like uncertainty that caused Draco to act the way he had.
Harry thought of Draco.  Draco and, Harry paused at the realization, Severus were all the home he ever needed.
The beat was strong, and the music demanded bodies to writhe and contour around each other, hugging tightly like a fine set of leather trousers.  Harry and Aiden danced close, groin to thigh as hips undulated to the pounding base of the techno song.  Aiden's hand was on Harry's back in a way that was possessive, but not controlling and Harry absently wondered if he was a top or a bottom before he felt a hard tap on his shoulder.
Remus left for the rock pile, dodging small troupes of Death Eaters, and when he arrived he was not surprised to see that nobody was there. Burnt into one large boulder were the initials NT. Relief washed over him, knowing she had made it and moved on to the ritual site.
This man, who clung to Harry as fervently as Harry clung to him, was an unexpected gift.  The clock must have tumbled to Christmas.  Though Harry'd never expected anything good his life again, he now held exactly what he needed.  A companion.  A living, breathing sanctuary who knew his past and still stood by his side.  Draco knew all his sins, and still wanted him.
"Harry, you can't do that to me." Remus wasn't about to let Harry's worries gnaw at his friend's conscience.
Potter lifted up a pint glass and took a sip of amber beer.  With a soft
Harry sneezed.
Damn… If only he or Ron had been cursed instead of Hermione, she would have solved this all long ago. Did he know anyone else who could help him? Nobody of Hermione's calibre came to mind. She had developed an unbreakable crypto system for God's sake.
They stared at each other and Draco swore he saw the vine grow out of the corner of his eye.  "So you say, Harry."  Harry grinned and sucked on his straw some more.
There were no sparks, no flashy lights, just a stream of magic billowing from his wand, from his hand and from his very soul. It swallowed and engulfed the Dark Lord, embracing him like a tender lover.
"So, someone had a crystal ball and was 'zapping' people with it? Did anyone tell you how they felt after they got zapped?"
Did this change things?  Did he want to maintain this weird relationship of masks and lies?  Was Harry Potter worth it?
"Does it hurt?"
"How you been, Draco," he greeted.  Any more familiarity and Draco was certain he would crack, without any preamble or warning, just like his wall had earlier that day.  He placed the pen down on the desk and smiled thinly at his old ally, without sincerity or any hint of camaraderie.
"Potter, why did you run off?"
He loved the musky scent of a man aroused, and he wondered: if he hadn't been captured and trapped with Draco would this be something he knew about himself?
With a wistful brush of her hair from her shoulders, she says, "Well, there are plans being laid out.  And Harry seems happy to have you here, even though you're avoiding him."  Draco flinches.  "Are you mad at him?  Has he done something?"  She cocks her head at him.
"Hermione!  You didn't."
"Hello?"
Malfoy refused to meet Harry's eyes.  Harry didn't try to meet his.
"Hermione! Oh Merlin! You…"
"Well, we can speak, kind of. He sends me information," Remus said as his cheeks pinked.
Then suddenly Harry shot straight up, disturbing the sleeping man next to him.  Time was almost up.
"Well, might as well make the best of it."  She'd been very 'good' with Harry after their initial meeting, but a tension still remained between them.  She told him she had met with her mum and they apparently had a healthy, long talk.  Some of the issues she had bottled up seemed to have bubbled to the surface and she faced the raging pain when before she had only run.  But Harry knew losing a family member wasn't something you faced and recovered from in only a few days.
"The Staves!  Shoot the Hex Stones," comes one desperate cry followed by the calm command from Luna.  "Dive! Dive!"
Then he remembered what was in the room.  He remembered the stench, the greasy feel crawling across his skin.  The back of his head hurt where he'd hit it against the wall when he'd backed away, frantic to be anywhere else.
"Oh, well… I don't think it was…." Hermione tried to explain, but her left hand spoke over her and said, "We made complete bollocks of an experiment that pushed the boundaries of magic and sanity; truly spectacular from an avant-garde perspective.  Never seen, never heard of, never done before.  All for my advanced placement in a potions position I was interested in.  Too bad
Duncan nodded, and Remus let him go. "Sure Lupin, but don't count on it." The other man darted through the debris in the alley and out of sight.
“To remind myself of the distinction I just mentioned. Not all dark magic is evil. It’s important that we remember that. It’s important that we pay attention to the things that can really do damage, really hurt someone. Tracing back its long history, this ring has killed at least twelve people, probably more. No one wakes up from a Curse of Endless Sleep, not even if the ring is removed from the hand of the victim. The family we raided, they had a history of attacking their enemies and controlling their supposed allies through dark objects. By taking their weapons away, we saved lives. Instead of casting a wide net and saying all dark magic is bad and we should treat it all the same, we successfully focused on what was truly harmful, and it made all the difference. I’m proud of that raid. So I kept the ring. It reminds me of the good work we can do.”
her…” He trailed off, looking over the lake. “When I heard her speak. There was… she was just so… unaffected. She had no airs at all. No pretension. Just… pure.” Harry watched his boyfriend’s best mate as he contemplated Vesper’s good qualities, and he could understand, for the first time, what Draco and Hermione both found so compelling about the Slytherin. He considered things deeply. And he did not shy away from sharing his thoughts aloud, unconcerned about what others thought. “It was more than even that, though,” Blaise went on. “Because in her pureness she was… sunshine. I’ve never felt anything like that before. When she looks at you, there’s this warmth that comes with it. You feel it in every part of you.”
“Are you even going to be cheering me on?” Harry asked Draco over breakfast that morning. “You’re not wearing any red or gold, I see. Or carrying that flag Dean gave you with the lion on it.”
“I just feel awful, thinking of even asking it of her,” Draco said, and he did look genuinely miserable. “I’m sick about it. But I can’t let go of this idea. I don’t think I’ll be able to really relax until I know Teddy is mine. Perhaps that makes me awful and selfish, but there it is. Were we ever surprised?”
“Mr. Rowle’s daughter attends your after school program.”
Malfoy wasn’t sneering now. If anything, he looked rather surprised himself, and it lent a wide-eyed, innocent quality to his face that made Harry’s stomach clench pleasantly.
would have, in his position.” He looked at Vesper, who he could see was listening to him carefully. “There is one thing you have in common,” Harry said. “I wasn’t sure if there was much, at first, but now that I think about it…”
“This is new to me,” he reminded Draco. “I want to do it right. You’ll have to guide me.”
“Yeah, but Hermione’s always hated my temper. She’s always telling not to get worked up so easily. So now she gets the comparison between me, who freaks out at the first sign of trouble, and Zabini, who’s so calm about it all that he may as well be a bloody monk. Which do you think is going to appeal to her more?”
“Oh, all right,” said Parkinson, pulling a piece of parchment out of the book she was carrying. She walked towards Harry and held it out to him. “It’s free of curses, of course. We checked.”
Kemp laughed. “Well, you defeated the most powerful dark wizard of all time, so you can’t be terrible.”
Pansy arched a brow. “You want to have the children conversation
She smiled at him gratefully, glad he was agreeing without much fuss. He wasn’t a difficult patient, all around, but he had a tendency to be brave about his injury, an inherent Gryffindor quality, to be sure. Admirable at times, but also frustrating, especially when he was feeling discomfort and wasn’t willing to say. Hermione had learned that she had to push treatment sometimes, just a bit, for him to accept it. He knew from experience, though, that this salve did make him feel better, and it was always more effectively applied with Hermione doing it, which was an added bonus.
“You wouldn’t dare,” said Harry. “Not to your very best mate in the whole world.”
“Why do you ask?”
“So, how does it begin?” Draco asked.
“Just in time, too,” Jaime said with a grin. “I thought I was a goner when it sent that
By the time they’d finally taken their hands off each other and found an alternate route to the dorms, the party was in full swing. There was food (undoubtedly swiped from the kitchens) and plenty of alcohol that someone had managed to smuggle in. Most impressive, though, was the fact that someone had brought in a stereo and put a protection charm around it, keeping it from being affected by all the magic in the atmosphere of the school. It was currently blasting some hip hop song Harry didn’t know, though Draco was clearly familiar, given the fact that he immediately started singing along.
“How can we really know what sort of weapon they want if we don’t understand their motives?” asked Shelby.
“Fine,” Malfoy sneered. “Finnigan, truth or dare?”
“I’ll move into the Manor with Mother, maybe get a studio somewhere.  Some potions work perhaps.  I don’t need money, and no one is going to want to hire me.”  Though he said it with a cavalier intonation, Harry could tell, from all those years studying Malfoy, that he wasn’t as unconcerned as he wanted everyone to believe.
Harry couldn’t help but smile.  “I never was good with girls.”
“Well now we know Draco is an exhibitionist,” Dean said.  A few chuckles broke out easing the tension in the room.  Harry had only eyes for Malfoy though.
Padma proceeded to dare Ernie to perform his own rendition of Celestina Warbeck’s A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love. Ernie then asked Lavender if she and Parvati had ever experimented with each other.  She said it was more than experimentation, and Parvati glared at her and took a drink.  Lavender dared Blaise to kiss Dean, who rather seemed to like it Harry noticed.  Then Blaise dared Parvati to kiss Padma, but she drank while Seamus, Ernie, and Neville pelted Blaise with Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans for even suggesting it.  A group vote was called and Blaise was made to take a shot.
Malfoy’s grip on the bottle tightened and his face hardened.  “Right.  Yea, because that would make me popular with the people.  I’m sure everyone would love to hear about me shagging the Golden Boy.  Definitely would help decrease the number of death threats that get sent my way.”
“Hermione,” Justin said.  “Truth or dare.”
“Nothing, sorry,” Harry said lamely.  Parkinson was rolling her hips and shimmying around.
“My arse isn’t little,” Draco muttered.
“Don’t be such a wimp,” Parkinson said as Malfoy brought the drink to his lips.  Malfoy chugged his entire drink then stood up walked over to Harry, whose heart was pounding.  He could hear catcalls from the others, but the world seemed to fade away as Draco Malfoy.  Beautiful, blonde, irritating, sarcastic Draco Malfoy straddled his lap.  Harry didn’t move from his reclined position leaning back against arms.  His whole body was frozen with anticipation.
“Oi, get a room already!” Parkinson yelled.  Pansy, Harry supposed he would have to get used to calling her.  Everyone turned to look at them and Harry felt Draco pulling away, so he scooped up the blonde before he could think twice.  “Well, if you insist!”
“What do you plan to do after the school year?”  Malfoy raised his eyebrows.  Harry shrugged to hide his embarrassment.  “I never imagined a life beyond killing Voldemort.”
“Draco,” Harry said, finding confidence in Malfoy’s lack of any.  Their eyes met and Harry wondered how he had lived in the same dormitory as Malfoy for eight months and not ravished him until now.  “I think I’ve liked you for a long time.”
“What exactly is that?” Pansy Parkinson asked.  Harry ignored her tone.  Pansy always sounded annoyed.
“Dare,” Seamus said, Dean still in his lap.
Malfoy laughed.  “You already saved the world, don’t go trying to save me.”
Malfoy spun around and leaned against the railing his arms spread open like he was putting himself on display.  “To Harry Potter who wants to see my very big prick.”
Draco Malfoy was nervous.  Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him into the dormitory.  Malfoy slackened his grip, but Harry held tight.  Laughter and the raging fire greeted them as they entered.  No one looked up from where they were all draped over furniture, the floor, and each other.
“Truth or dare, Potter,” Malfoy said with a glint in his eye.
After taking a swig he passed the cup to Draco who was watching him with slightly suspicious eyes but drank.  Harry used his finger to wipe away a bit of foam that stuck to the corner of Draco’s mouth.
Malfoy held up the bottle.  “Thought you might want a refill, Potter.”
“You know they already saw us make out?”
“Harry,” Hermione said softly.
“You had Lucius.  I had Dumbledore, but they’re both gone now.  I don’t know what that means.  I knew I was meant to kill Voldemort since first year.  I was raised to kill.  Now I have, and there’s the rest of my life ahead of me and, well, this is the first thing that has felt good in so long.  Why else did you come up here?”
Draco shrugged and glanced away.  “That was a game.”
Pansy pursed her lips and glared at Malfoy, but he rolled his eyes at her.
Malfoy grabbed his face and Harry closed his eyes, preparing himself for Draco to pull them hard together in rough kiss. But then Malfoy’s lips gently brushed against his.  He gasped in surprise.  Malfoy slid his tongue inside Harry’s mouth and Harry lost himself in the gentle licks and swirls of the Slytherin boy’s tongue.  One of Malfoy’s hands gently removed his glasses while the other tugged through his hair, increasing Harry’s arousal.  Harry considered that he should probably shove Malfoy off him now, but that seemed like a stupid thing to do.
“It’s a muggle game where…”
Hermione met Justin’s eyes and said without hesitation.  “Advada Malfoy, Fuck Pansy, Marry Zambini.”
Harry snorted in disbelief but held out his glass.  Malfoy crossed the rest of the distance between them.  His free hand slid around the glass to stabilize it while he poured.  His fingers were warm and soft against Harry’s.  Malfoy held up the bottle.  “To Harry Potter the Boy Who,” Harry tensed, “got everyone plastered.”
“Right.”  Harry rolled his eyes.  “Malfoy, would you want to be my boyfriend even though its absurd and probably doomed and no one will like it?”
“I wanted to be your friend,” Malfoy said.  “When we first came to Hogwarts.  I wish that had happened.  I think it could have changed things.”  Malfoy grabbed the bottom of Harry’s latest Weasley sweater.  “The green looks good with your eyes, Harry.”  Draco emphasized his name, and Harry swallowed.  “That’s a Slytherin color.”
“Padma, truth or dare?” Parkinson asked.
“Pansy,” Hermione said.  “Truth or dare.”
“Why are you here?”  Harry took another swig of his fire whiskey.  Looking at Malfoy across the Astronomy Tower reminded him of the last time they had been up here together.  He shuddered and drank again.
“Truth or dare.”
Harry backed away from the group happy to notice that Hermione and Ron were so consumed by the game that they weren’t taking notice of him.  Neville sent him a look though which Harry dismissed with a smile and tugging on his shirt collar to indicate that he was hot.  Before anyone else took notice, he slipped out into the corridor.
“Truth,” Harry whispered back.
Some of the mirth left Malfoy’s features and Harry wished he could put it back.  But what were they doing?  The past months they had danced around each other with pleasantries and the occasional quip.  One year of school and then they wouldn’t have to see each other again.  One year of demonstrating to the underclassmen and the British wizarding world that there could be healing and forgiveness following the war.  Why was Malfoy pushing limits?  Why was he complicating things?
“I need a drink,” Pansy said snatching a freshly poured glass of fire whiskey from Ernie, but there was a grin on her face.  The grin could also be found on the faces of the other Slytherins.  Harry felt a sense of impending doom wash over him.  At the same time, he wondered what they could really throw at him that was worse than they already had.  It wasn’t like they had some Death Eaters hiding in the cupboard.
Harry laughed and let the door slam shut behind him.  Harry brought Draco over to his bed and threw him down on the Gryffindor sheets.  Draco rolled his eyes.  “Well isn’t this the perfect picture of house unity.”
“It’s a bloody castle.  It’s never warm,” Draco complained.
Her answer was met with some catcalls.  Parkinson said, “Sorry Draco love, even you can’t compete with my looks and Blaise’s bank account.”
Draco melted into Harry’s kisses and Harry spun them around and pushed Draco against the cold glass door.  His hands grasped the fabric of Draco’s shirt and pinned him there while he showered the blonde boy with kisses that drew out the most adorable moans.  Draco’s hands had slid beneath his shirt, exploring the skin of his back and torso.  Then he began to tug at Harry’s trousers.
Malfoy made a face.  “Truth or dare, Potter.”
“Like what?” Harry asked breathing in the cold night air in the hopes that it would decrease the rate of his fast-beating heart.
“You get asked truth or dare by someone,” Hermione said, and Harry realized he had let his mind wander.  It happened often these days.  Like Malfoy and Parkinson’s dichotomy, no one seemed to notice when Hermione finished what Harry was saying before he drifted away from the present.  “If you pick truth, you have to honestly answer whatever question you’re asked or you take a drink.  If you pick dare, you have to do what they tell you or you take a drink.  I don’t suppose someone has any alcohol around?”
“What?” Ron asked.
Harry glanced back at Malfoy.  Everyone else was starting to get sweaty from the heat of the fire and copious amount of alcohol.  But Malfoy looked impossibly unaffected.  The white collar of his probably 50 galleon designer shirt was crisp.  The top two buttons were undone giving a glimpse of his chest underneath.  His blonde hair caught the firelight in a way that… highly disturbed him. This was Malfoy and even if Malfoy was hot and even if no one cared about sexual identity in the Hogwarts 8th year that didn’t mean that harboring feelings for Draco Malfoy could end him anywhere except for in a lot of drama.
“A muggle game?” Parkinson snorted.  Zambini also had a look of disdain on his face.
“Good,” Harry said, sitting back down.  “I’d hate for you to think I was letting you off easy by saving your ungrateful, evil, little arse.”
“Malfoy, Draco,” Harry said.  Draco brought their lips together, effectively shutting him up, even as his hands nimbly undid the buttons and zipper.  In moments his trousers and pants were in a pile around his feet.  The cold air against his skin provided a sobering moment for Harry which did not last long.  Draco fell to his knees and took Harry into his mouth and it was better than Felix Felicis a million times over.  Clearly this was not Draco’s first blowjob, even if it was Harry’s.  Draco’s hands grasped his butt, pulling them close together, his head bobbing as he sucked Harry’s cock.  Harry had mistakenly thought that sex would be a bit better than wanking himself off.  When Draco looked up at him, Harry felt himself cumming and tried to pull away, but Draco held him there and sucked the cum from him.  He swallowed and then licked Harry’s cock like it was an ice cream cone.
But Draco is worth a thousand falls. And more.
And Draco was as unholy as they come.
‘Yes,’ the word hits my face, shakes the real world full force. There’s pain in my chest, as my heart expands to contain it.
Potter smiles back.
Harry ravaged him with his eyes.
‘See? That wasn’t so hard, was it?’ Josh teased again. He was giving Harry all the gentle pushes towards Draco, clearing the path for the inevitable. ‘Can’t say the same thing about your cock, though.’
This time over, Josh hadn’t blindfolded his submissive. Draco had been faced with those unguarded green eyes: wide, pleading, bright. No glasses. Those eyes were dangerous. They’d always been Draco’s weakness. They were the thing about Potter he could not, for the life of him, help but notice or forget, the thing that broke his resolve every fucking time, that made him wonder, hope, feel - a deadly combination. And because Draco knew this, he’d always kept a safe distance - from the eyes, but especially the
‘There’s also a weird rumor…’ I keep going because I’m not about to let him off the hook. ‘Apparently, someone broke Flannagan’s wand in half. He didn’t say who. But everyone’s going on about how freaking scared he was… he even talked of leaving the country. You don’t happen to have anything to do with that, do you?’
Harry sucked in a breath.
‘It’s because I try so hard,’ I say mockingly. But my chest is hurting.
I wish she wasn’t wasting her time, she looks like a nice enough person.
We’re moving to the beat. I take in his scent, the way he feels, warm, real, swaying against me, the cold night air, the laughs and voices, the song, my heartbeat, his breathing. He takes my arms and puts them around him. My hands drop to the front of his jeans. He’s hard. His hands press mine over the swell of his cock, my fingers cupping him. It’s like I’m meant to do this all my life.
‘You just asked me out. I can’t believe Draco Malfoy has just asked me out.’
Draco tugged sharply at the leash and Harry choked for an instant, spit dripping down his jaw, but his throat kept working around Josh’s cock.
He feels comfortable in solitude. Or maybe, he’s just grown used to it.
look like me. I’m the real deal. Potter knows it, I know it. He’d even admit it out loud if I’d ask him. The thing about Potter is... he never tells lies. He simply knows how to work the truth to his favour.
‘Let go of me.’
‘You sure about that, hon?’ Pansy pins me down with her hard gaze. ‘Because he’s either fucking everything that moves and making headlines pertaining the size of his cock, or trying his best to get killed. I’m guessing you’re the reason behind both.’
‘You’re the sweetest thing I’ve had in a very long time. I’m far from done with you.’
‘Spread your legs, while you’re at it. Give me a nice view.’
You think of going to his apartment, knock on his door and confront him. To say what, you don’t quite know, but that never stopped you before. You have half a mind to do it, when you spot him leaving the usual pub night with a good-looking man you never saw before. It hits you just then that this thing between you was never exclusive. You get mad at yourself for forgetting it and from then on you dive into work.
could never work.
And you kiss him.
I push his hand away from my crotch.
Harry swallowed, a trace of saliva on his lips stretched around the gag. He would make such a sight on his knees sucking Draco’s cock. Draco wanted that mouth on him and at the same time he wanted it under his own mouth, he wanted to lick it, bite on those lips and drink down the moans. And then he would fuck it. Have Harry swallow him whole. Make him gag on his prick.
- get in the way of his interests. But there was a voice he kept shutting up inside him, that said quite clearly what he knew all along: that all his rules could never be applied to Potter.
‘Have yet to find any,’ Josh replied.
Harry closed his eyes, nudging closer, the leather cutting into his neck. Draco eased the pressure on the leash and Harry let out a content sigh, then mouthed at Josh’s still covered cock. He let his lips trail down the shaft, and Josh grabbed his head and kept him there, rubbing his length against Harry’s stubbled cheek.
‘It’s got nothing to do with me.’
Draco twisted his hand over his own cock. Two pulls, just how he liked them and he would be ready to pop.
‘Yes… so tired,’ Harry felt compelled to tell Malfoy everything, every fucking truth.
‘How long before you can go again?’
He goes down the corridor, reaches the door, turns the key. I’m right behind him. We’re inside, he closes the door. I don’t look around. We don’t turn on the lights. There’s a trace of light coming from the window. It’s enough. He’s against the door, silent. The show of confidence is over.
I crave him with something akin to desperation.
He shook his head frantically, unable to speak.
I can’t look at him right now, but I know he’s looking at me. There’s so much shame as I say this, but I have to keep going because I need him to know, to understand. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Tainted, unworthy of everyone, but especially of him.
He heard Malfoy’s sharp intake of breath. Or he imagined it, because he was so aroused he couldn’t think.
It’s the first thing that comes to your mind. His mouth clicks shut, but he’s waiting for you to say something, anything. You try to order your thoughts.
And the truth is all in there. He makes me feel safe, no matter how insane that sounds. I’m not in danger anymore because Harry made sure of it. It’s a new, impossible feeling. I swallow hard. I look in his eyes, gather the words around me. I will myself to say it.
‘You hate the pressure of it,’ he said, voice slow and determined, as his hand was. ‘You hate to be bossing everyone around. You hate that they all want something from you,’ that voice was driving him crazy, reaching inside him, taking him apart.
We don’t do rough. Or fast. Draco always takes his time with me. He’s slow, and tender and his words wrap around me, filling me as his cock does.
I’m speechless. I had no idea. I don’t need him to say he’s sorry, but I can tell that they needed it. And that it changed things between them too. There seems to be a lot I’ve been missing out.
‘What’re you waiting for?’ Draco asked.
That’s what you mean to tell him the next night.
Draco leans closer. He doesn’t dare to think.
There was no hesitation. Harry crawled over to the bed, climbed up, his knees red, his cock jutting hard before him. Without even asking he positioned himself in exactly the way Draco wanted him. On all fours, facing Draco, head bent low, arse up.
No one ever calls on you this late. Hermione and Ron always Floo you first.
It reveals everything I want and can’t have.
Draco laughed.
Harry pursed his lips, defiance in his eyes. There was something of the Gryffindor there, of the Potter he knew from school and it made Draco eager to have it. He wanted it, that scorching fire, he wanted to draw it all out. Josh seemed to notice it too.
‘Nothing is impossible for you.’
There’s something else I need to know.
You blink and it’s all it takes for the spell to break. He’s already looking away, over the balcony. A strand of his hair falls over the right side of his face.
‘I don’t wanna talk about it,’ but he still doesn’t pull away.
me- It almost makes me giddy. I wait until my heart and pulse slow down to a normal rhythm.
‘Do you know what this means?’ he asked bluntly.
I stare at the table. There’s a dark smudge in the wood, next to the sugar bowl. I remember Harry’s splayed hands there, scrambling for purchase as I fucked him good. I remember how he begged. How I lost myself that night.
It’s not that I don’t want to. It is but simple force of habit. Believe me, I had my share of doubts about them getting married. But after a year of seeing them together, I’m prepared to admit I was wrong. Granger is the best thing to ever happen to Pansy. People have this idea that Pansy is a horrible person, but I wouldn’t be here without her. I’ll never have what she has, but I’m glad one of us is happy.
I tuck a hair lock behind my ear, and trace my fingers over the table.
I don’t expect the admission to hurt as much as it does. But that’s just the whole thing, isn’t it? I never expected him to come close enough to matter. Much less to hurt me.
It makes me question everything, like how much I trust him.
One shouts.
‘Is that what you want?’
‘Suck,’ Draco whispered. And then his fingers were inside Harry’s mouth, wet and warm and right. He swayed forward. Harry sucked his fingers down, his eyes drifting closed. Draco felt spaced-out, floating on a high.
Harry’s whole body went liquid and then tensed up in his arms. He cried out and his cock spurted between them, warm, jolting next to Draco’s hard length. Draco held him through it, Harry’s body shaking, their kisses growing desperate, the wetness over his cock almost unbearable.
She’s already standing up, but that makes her pause.
I don’t even think it first, I say it:
‘Yeah. Well.’ He bites his lip.
Harry
He’s right, I wasn’t. I don’t know who I am anymore.
‘It was just a couple of potions and drinks-’ My words come out slurred. I seem to have lost the ability to speak.
I should have known it, then. He’s always been there for me, lingering on the side of impossible things. Kneeling on the dimly lit bathroom, he makes quite the picture. Hair rumpled from my hands, white shirt clinging to his chest, a thin sheen of sweat over his brow, the faint traces of the famous lightning scar still visible. I resist the shameful urge to touch it with my fingers.
‘I don’t remember getting an invitation,’ Draco said stiffly, more to appear in control than because he actually cared.
‘But you are…’ Harry placed a soft kiss on his lips, on his jaw, down the curve of his chin, on a spot behind his ear. Draco wondered why his every touch felt new and familiar at the same time. ‘This is exactly what I need.’
Dear readers,
He’d set his glass on the table with a definite clink and had started to walk out.
He is completely motionless for so long, you start to doubt he’s even heard you. But then, he simply nods. It’s so subtle you think you imagined it, but he’s already walking towards the doors, turning back to look at you and something in his eyes is different. Expectant.
It was a small mercy that Potter wore glasses - at least, outside of this damned club. Namely at work, where Draco got to cross paths with him more times than was healthy for him. Draco was especially grateful for the lenses working as a sort of filter. One could pretend those eyes weren’t so deeply green, one could downplay the sheer intensity of them, especially when they were so intent on you,
‘Hermione thinks I’m right.’
It’s definitely a smile, now. It forms a tiny dimple on his non-scarred cheek.
he thought. Flogging was always the center of attention at these clubs. Draco gripped his glass as Josh arched his arm back. The flogger drove swiftly through the air, aim perfect and vicious. The first of Harry’s moans reached Draco’s ears.
She gives a small laugh, turning her bright gaze to me.
The room was adequate, even if he’d be more comfortable in his own. He had a sudden vision of Harry spread over his bed, wearing only the collar - the silver one - his arms fastened to the bedposts. It didn’t seem impossible at all.
He glances at you. There’s a trace of anticipation somewhere in his eyes. He takes a deep breath.
‘Yes,’ he says.
I reach the back door. Outside, I light a cigarette & slowly reach the Apparition spot behind the bar, our usual rendezvous. As predicted, I barely have to wait. A minute later, I hear his steps on the sidewalk.
He doesn’t know this, but he set me free in more ways than one. After he saved me from Azkaban, I went and shaved half of my hair. Tattooed my arms the following week. I loved every second of the pain inflicted by those needles. Muggle style. Then the pink sort of happened, which in itself is saying something. Mother hates it, of course. Everything in my life used to be planned. Controlled. Now my only purpose is dancing. I do it for me, but also for him.
‘So,’ I repeat.
I hear him take a deep breath. He moves quietly around the table and I don’t step back to maintain the distance.
‘Then do it,’ Draco said, and purposely spread his legs more as he watched the intense change on Harry’s face, lips parting in a gasp. He looked doubtful.
I have no idea why I sound like I’m defending him, when I know she’s right. Potter’s a playboy. Not that there’s anything wrong with being promiscuous per se. I just wish he didn’t fuck with my head. Pansy gives me her classical dry laugh.
Harry bent his head down, the collar tight on his throat, the leash stretched in a long line of tension between his neck and Draco’s holding hand. His lips parted.
You think it’s all in the way he holds the cigarette, negligently, with his long pale fingers. His lips separate briefly, then close. It’s decadent and so very alive.
‘You’re really pretty when you’re desperate for it,’ he said slowly, the truth of it hitting him full force.
One grey eye, half a smile. He’s never followed me before.
You both make the wandless cleaning spells at the same time, your magic fusing up, entangling. He gets up. All of a sudden you feel quite awkward. The last time you came in your pants you were a teenager who knew nothing of sex.
‘Yes.’
Take for instance now: he’s at a Muggle club, dancing. I’m staring at him, across the room, leaning against the counter, another drink in my hand, the alcohol burning down my throat. Lights flash over us. Green, white, blue, yellow, purple, pink. Pink. Like his hair.
There’s something so warm about it. So endearing. He doesn’t decide it, but follows the light anyway. It travels ahead of him down the corridor, casting eerie shadows on the walls, then turns left to the hall with the elevators. He does the same. They both get into the elevator. The light feels warm next to him. Almost familiar. It makes him aware of how cold his hands are. The light guides him to a fireplace. He hesitates. Then makes up his mind.
You mean tonight, but you also mean more and you think he might know it. He breathes out.
You scream inside his mouth, a low, guttural groan.
We both lost the bet. Are you happy?
- until
You realise you stopped moving. Lost inside your own thoughts. He’s looking at you.
Malfoy walked over, like a vision from Harry’s darkest fantasies, and without further ado, placed the tip of the cane against his nipple. There was a heartbeat in which Harry breathed in sharply, eyes wide, mouth falling open. Then Draco twisted his wrist just so and the cane twisted his nipple cruelly. There was such sweet pain that Harry cried out. And begged for more.
Everything keeps spinning. This voice- it’s not the same, it’s not- it sounds-
‘Draco, here you are…’
‘Malfoy, please…’ Harry whined. There was something about the change in name. It reminded Draco that they knew each other outside of this room, this club. It reminded him that they were Potter and Malfoy, something that had seemed impossible.
‘So. Where is he?’
All the more so because he’d watch it happen, leaning against that damned wall, smoking those damned cigarettes. He wouldn’t save me this time around, we’d finally be even. As if I can ever be even with a martyr. A selfless hero.
I watch as a dark-haired bloke tries his luck. Malfoy ruts against him, lets the man run his hands down his chest, over his stomach, then he lets that hand cup him through his tight black jeans. I can’t yank my eyes away, as he rolls his hips up, slowly. I can’t tell if he’s hard, but I like to think he is, his cock filling up under that hand. My chest constricts. Malfoy lifts his eyes and looks me up and down. He runs his tongue over his piercing. A metal ring in the right corner of his lower lip. That’s new. He didn’t have it yesterday. I never kissed anyone with a piercing.
‘Cute,’ he drawled, and noticed Harry’s blush at his tone and praise. ‘But that’s not all.’
‘It’s been years. Hermione, of course, was the first to notice it. Even Ron knows it. All my friends. So I can’t exactly deny it anymore, can I?’
‘I’m going to show you just how pleased I am.’
Harry was about to whimper, or cry, or go crazy, maybe all at the same time.
‘Fuck it. What I mean is everytime I’m not here I wonder what this is, what this means, because it’s starting to mean something and if it doesn’t feel like that to you, we should just end it, whatever this-’
Harry broke the kiss and watched him closely, hands on each side of his face. He looked solemn, happy, unsure. He let his head drop to Draco’s chest and they lay like that for some time, none of them wanting to break whatever was happening between them. Harry was still wearing the collar and it helped that he was because that meant they were inside the scene and Draco needed that a bit longer. His fingers traced idly over the collar, touching Harry’s soft and damp skin. His eyes fell on a purple bruise on Harry’s neck, shaped like a crescent moon.
I try to steady my voice, but it’s hard to do that when my face is up against a wall, my cheek scratched by the cold stone. I never realised how strong he is. I struggle to push him back, but he seems unmovable. I try to reach for my wand but it dawns on me that I left it lying on a desk when we walked into this classroom. Out of my reach.
‘Neat is nice,’ he says after a while. ‘I like neat hair.’
I don’t feel alone anymore.
Malfoy’s fingers skimmed up and down his back, light, then up again, his nails digging into Harry’s skin, fast, burning. Cool hands stilled over his shoulder blades. Malfoy gripped harder at his skin, his nails sinking there. Harry’s body arched back into the touch and he swallowed a scream. Malfoy had the most vicious hands. They were soft, but his nails were sharp and they covered Harry’s back in trails of red pain. Malfoy’s nails drove into his skin from the top of his shoulder blades down to his lower back. He felt them going down, over the curve of his arse. All Doms used to say he had the best arse. They went on and on about how tight it was. How fuckable. How they couldn’t wait to stick their cocks in there and pound him to the nearest wall.
you.’
With his left hand he had Harry Potter on a leash, with his right he controlled Harry’s painfully hard cock, and his words did the rest. The rush he felt was similar to those seconds immediately before orgasm.
‘Josh is going to take you home, okay Harry? He’s going to take care of you.’
Harry swallowed Josh in one go. He breathed harshly through his nose, his throat working under the constricting collar.
It seemed like a long time before he could even think or remember his own name… he only did because someone was breathing it gently on his ear… Josh? Josh’s hands were on his back, applying salve and easing his pain, but tears were welling up on Harry’s eyes.
‘Weren’t you dying for me to touch you?’ Draco said, the words sounding very far away. Harry trembled, every bit aware that the hold on his cock had turned to touch. Every movement of Draco's hand over his cock was mimed on Harry's.
Harry looked back at him. There was a smile in his eyes, but also resolution.
‘How many times do I have to tell you he’s changed?’ Hermione turns to Ron, her voice rising above the incessant babble in the room. ‘We work together now, can’t you make an effort—?’
‘Fuck off.’ Is what I tell him.
Harry made a low sound with his throat, a pretty broken thing.
You never thought you’d find this in the dark.
You know you’re not his first, nor will you be his last, but you can’t believe he looks like this to them too.
You hear him by the drinks cabinet. He doesn’t ask you what you want, but fills two glasses with whisky. It’s a Muggle brand, probably a very good one. He leaves your glass on the table next to him and takes a sip of his drink, leaning against the wall. All his quietness and presumption should make you uncomfortable. It shouldn’t be making you walk over to him, pick up the glass and empty it in one go.
He barely had time to bite back a moan. Malfoy’s hands were on him. Long fingers wrapped around his hips, tugging them in place. Malfoy’s nails brushed his skin and dug into it. Hard. The searing pain expanded through Harry, but he did not make a sound. He could take it. He could take it all. Malfoy was going to mark him. His nails were deep enough to do so. Harry was a sucker for pain. And Malfoy was going to give it to him. Bad.
Draco felt an insanely happy laugh bubbling on his chest.
He gives me a slow smile. The scar on his face must hurt right then for he immediately flinches. Without thinking, I reach out and my fingers touch the skin of his face, not on the scar, but on the other cheek. He looks fully surprised. Then he closes his eyes, leans into the touch.
Harry groaned, the sound half-frustration, half-arousal shooting through Draco, driving him to capture Josh’s mouth with his.
Draco felt sure he could come from Harry talking like this.
So... blue hair Draco anyone? :D How are you feeling about this one? I'm a complete sap, I know. I'm a Hufflepuf, in case that's not already apparent *hya!* The last chapter is coming up and you won't want to miss it, believe me.
His purpose burns up and down my arm, reaches my hand, throbs on my fingers.
I keep nodding, like this is the only thing I know how to do. He waves something in front of my face.
‘You went home with him.’
‘Wanna come over to mine?’
‘I want you to look at me while I suck you off. You can’t close your eyes or look away. You ready?’
Thing is I decided to walk all the way over here under heavy rain, after drinking myself to a reckless sense of purpose. Even this drunk, I’m quite aware that I shouldn’t be here, not tonight, not ever. This time, it really feels like we’re over, and I was the one to break it, break us.
He fought to speak clearly, for his Dom -
I’m speechless for a moment, watching him casually opening up a cabinet, picking up two teacups and a teapot. He fills it with water, then points his wand at it. The water starts to boil.
myself.
Potter has the decency to stop smiling. He looks startled.
Malfoy laughs softly at her tone, his hand on my thigh not moving one bit. Parkinson smiles at us in a way that tells me that one, she knows we were about to kiss; two, she’s not in the least surprised.
‘I’m here to have a drink.’ I say stiffly.
But with him… it’s not random at all. It’s always been a slow dance between you. And an unpredictable one at that.
‘You mean my cock?’ Draco asked, letting each word drop like liquid.
‘I’m going to suck your cock.’
Harry let out a pitiful moan. Something hard was pressing against Harry’s arse.
You also know you’re going to do whatever he wants.
My fingers wrap around the bowl. I once dreamt of a life with kitchens and sugar bowls like this one. That dream had something to do with Christmas dinners, late morning breakfasts, a big family, the smell of delicious food and me sucking Harry’s fingers covered in sugar. I don’t like that being drunk makes me philosophical. Or think impossible things. I don’t like that it makes me speak the truth.
I know I shouldn’t, but I’m laughing before I know it and then I can’t stop. He startles. And I fucking can’t stop laughing. He glares at me, and I try to stop, I really do, but I can’t. I’m laughing so hard, my eyes tear up. His eyebrows draw up. His mouth is a straight thin line of contempt. My laugh rings in my ears. It rings off the walls.
When he saved me from the Fiendfyre.
was no stranger.
Draco leaned in closer, his breath hitching on Harry’s neck and Harry tilted his head, offering his neck.
liked. His hole clenched and unclenched experimentally, expectant. He wanted to be filled, he wanted Draco to reach deep into him and make him forget that there was a world beyond this. Draco pushed through.
The first sound out of your mouth is a moan. The first thing he says is: can I?
There’s something about the abyss. A beauty in dark things. You always felt drawn to it.
— reminds you of him —
Not that he wants to date me. He just wants to fuck me, that much is evident. But I hate to know that I would say yes to everything... anything.
The nerve of him. That’s the one thing that’s always gotten under Draco’s skin. The sheer nerve of him. Draco’s trembling.
She puts on her best mock-shy look.
He wanted to meet me. Not at night, not in a club, but for a
The grey eyes glinted, Harry gulped.
At detention we just sit in a classroom in an angry silence. We’re supposed to be doing homework, but I haven’t got a clue what that might be. I’ve been missing most classes since the year started. I can’t imagine what the study program for each of those is. He has his parchment and books out, but he’s crossly glaring at the desk he’s sitting at, like he could easily burst a hole on the surface with the mere power of his stare.
‘Harry…’ Malfoy was smiling. Harry was sure of this for he felt it in his tone, low, ghosting over his neck. He was smirking, in that poshy way of his. Once that had made hate stir inside Harry. Now, something else entirely was stirring there.
‘This is all just fun and games to you, isn’t it, Potter?’ He snaps at me. ‘You don’t give an actual fuck about finishing Hogwarts. Why would you, really. It’s not like you need it. Someone’s probably already keeping your seat at the fucking Ministry warm for you, no matter how much you screw this up.’
I expect him to jump back, to ask me what the hell I’m doing. But he’s quiet, staring at my hand as I trace circles with my fingers over his jeans.
They fell over the bed, Harry rising over him and they kissed, tangled in each other. He didn’t know if the play was still on, didn’t care for it really.
Draco never does anything without a purpose.
‘Oh,’ you say. But what you’re thinking is: This is it. The impossibility of predicting him. This is what you’ve been missing.
. ‘Go enjoy your night.’
go to those classes.
‘I told them I had other plans this year. I went there earlier to leave the presents, that’s why I left in a hurry. Didn’t fancy being murdered by Rose and Hugo if I didn't leave them their presents tonight,’ he chuckles.
Draco felt his own orgasm like a sure thing, only kept at bay by that twisted side of him that needed submissives to lose it before he did.
‘The War changed everything,’ I realise I said the wrong thing as soon as the words leave my mouth. He tenses.
‘Maybe. He might not want me for a fucking relationship, but I know what he likes all right.’
He knew he was attractive for most men. He also knew he was too damned distant and arrogant. That he felt like no one could reach him. Until Harry happened. Out of the blue. Like nothing and everything at the same time.
Yeah, maybe Harry should ask him, right? Right? :D
I made a list of all the things I didn’t want my therapist to know. I’m going to read it in our next session. Maybe, it will be fine. For the first time, there's a future for me to think about. I don't know what it will be. All I know is, whatever it is, I want him to be in it.
His magic tingles over my skin. My clothes dry instantly and I remember what warmth feels like. I still feel dizzy from the all the wine I drank tonight, but now he’s so close I forget I’m supposed to be mad at him, for some reason I don’t even understand.
Malfoy’s cool grey eyes. On every fucking inch of his skin. On every part of his body. And all of it -
You turn left to your room. You leave the door open. He closes it behind him.
The shout, the sudden contrast of that voice against the quiet, is what yanks him back to the living. There’s a motion in is his body, forward, more purposeful than the walk to the lake. All of it ends on open lips, for there’s no purpose when you finally get home.
‘Only when I tell him no.’
Hand sliding up my thigh.
He stops dead, breathing hard, his eyes wide. It’s like he’s used up all his words.
There’s something so final about the way he says it. Like he’s saying a totally different thing:
‘Do you want me to leave you two alone?’ Josh was already up, grabbing the bag with his instruments.
‘Do you want your arse filled with spunk?’ Draco asked, bending down, so that his lips were inches away from Harry’s.
You’re so speechless that you let him in without a word. He walks down the corridor, you follow him. You barely had time to look at his face. He’s standing in the middle of your living room, looking round at everything like he’s only now seeing it for the first time.
These formal dinners are an exercise in masochism. I never miss a single one of them. I know, beforehand, he’s going to be there. I also know that he’s going to sit right next to me, even if there are dozens of other empty chairs. When he’s already there, I’m the one to go to him. We don’t speak after the usual uttered Potter, Malfoy. We always start on this pretend distance.
Potter laughs even harder. Draco can’t breathe. The lights flicker and sway before him. Nothing feels real, and yet that laugh feels more real than life itself.
‘Come to mine, Draco.’
to meet Potter again.
You grab his arm.
I should have some sort of comeback, but my brain is currently damaged. I simply gawk at him. He grins.
I look at the moon, up there in the dark vast sky and pretend I’m not hanging on his every word.
It all feels like an official proceeding of sorts. But it also feels intentional. None of you rushing to do it, no drunkenness to blame later. He walks over to you.
‘She loves books,’ Pansy goes on. I hate her. ‘She invited me over to check her library.’
The green eyes finally turned on him. They started on his face, lowered to his neck, to his chest, and kept going down, burning everything in their wake. Draco felt like they were taking in every fucking detail. He knew he looked good. That most men felt lucky for a night with him. But under that stare he felt all powerful and powerless at the same time.
‘Mine?’ He asks, so quiet.
‘Is this your idea of a joke? Bring me here just to humiliate me? It’s fucking Christmas Eve.’
‘Does it please you?’ Harry asked.
‘I like fighting you.’ I say.
‘Harry.’
‘You don’t have to-’
Harry’s next sob got caught on his throat as he registered the words.
‘Are you perfectly sure?’ Malfoy said, words huffing over Harry’s ear. ‘They’re all waiting to see if they still have a chance. Josh can get you anyone else for tonight,’ Malfoy sounded serious, business-like, but his voice had a certain electricity to it and it made Harry’s hairs on his neck stand on end. ‘Are you sure you want me?’
All the unsaid questions burn in my chest. I throw them all at his retreating back: why did you save me from the fire, why did you speak for me at the trials, why don’t you show up at Hogwarts, why do you keep coming here, what do you want from me, why don’t you do something about this, about us, because c’mmon there’s an us in here somewhere, in the way you watch me, why don’t you fucking make a move on me, can’t you see that I don’t want them, where’s that Gryffindor recklessness, that thing that made you so alive, what do you wank about when you finally go home, is it me, do you get hard when you watch me, do you get any sleep at all, because I only do if I dance and you never do, why do you look so fucking sad, why does that hurt me?
For a split second Draco had the crazy idea that Harry was looking for him. He crushed the thought immediately.
Malfoy sucked on his rim. Harry trashed under him, his movements cut short because of the restraints and that seemed to drive Malfoy even further. He heard a distant groan, but clearly felt it against his hole. Malfoy’s tongue breached him, slow, unrelenting, breaking his self-control, teasing him open, and Harry felt so incredible safe, so gone out of his mind, infinite in Malfoy’s hands, under his tongue.
Harry’s eyes were fixed on the spot where he knew Draco was, his body stretched taut, as if defying its own limits, welcoming the pain Josh was giving him. His back was arching up as much as it could with the restraints on his wrists and ankles, clearly searching contact with the flogger. The leather cut harshly into his skin, the sound of it mingling with those little gasps coming out his mouth. All that power, so beautifully laid at another’s man’s feet. So willingly forsaken.
‘I wonder how you survived a War.’ I say when the laughing fit subsides. ‘You’re a terrible liar, Harry.’
He has the strange feeling it’s waiting for him.
It’s like he won’t fight me, or my words, or this stupid bloke that had his hands inside my pants an hour ago. Like he’s given up on whatever this is between us.
‘No,’ Draco said, eyes watching intently.
Anyone walking past could see you now. On your knees, stuffed full with him. The thought makes you harder than it should. You’re dizzy and thirsty and there’s an ache in your chest that hurts you deeper when his hand brushes your cheek and stays there. His eyes are downcast, impossible to read.
His own yell rang on his ears, a desperate scream. Malfoy instantly popped his mouth out and Harry’s hips snapped forward, fucking into the air, helpless to stop. His throat was hurting and that only meant he was still screaming.
I can see his profile under the dim light of my wand. He’s sitting on the ground, back to the castle’s walls, arms around his knees. A mess of black hair, ratted trainers and jeans. He looks tired, but he also looks...
‘Come for me, Harry,’ Draco’s voice was barely a whisper, but it reached inside Harry and liberated the last restraint on his will.
‘Fuck the Headmistress.’
I can’t close mine. I’m fully intent on every bit of him, like this is it, the point of no return. He’s wielding something to me, I don’t know what, but he is. I could hit him. I could kiss him. I could tighten my fingers harder around his neck, make him choke.
‘I should be taking care of you,’ he said.
Since I feel like shit, I might as well look the part too. For the first time in my life I’m not able to put up a façade. It is strangely liberating.
‘Let me show you why.’ Harry’s eyes were dark-green, eager. He looked at Josh, pleading. ‘Tell him, tell him I’m good.’
‘Want to be on my knees for you. Anywhere you want me-’ His words were cut off by moans, as Draco’s hand kept working their cocks. ‘Want your hands on my hair, forcing me to suck you deep. Make me gag. Oh god, fuck. Your hand…’ he trailed off, bucking over the bed, Josh’s hands curling around his hips to keep him from rutting against the sheets.
‘You couldn’t possibly give me any pleasure.’ She says accordingly. Her mouth is all disdain when she adds, ‘I'm not here to make chit-chat.’
You come here to face it every night. To look the darkness dead in its eye. You stay in the silence, you stay in the dark. It’s cold, it’s windy, it’s lonely, you take it all. It has become your ritual.
Malfoy’s lips brushed over the tip of Harry’s cock, warm. Gentle. His hips snapped forward instantly. Draco opened his mouth around his cock, swirling his tongue around the head, then going down, eyes not leaving Harry’s. For the first time they looked unguarded, wanting. Harry drowned in them as his cock was swallowed by Draco. His body was slick with sweat and need, pliant under Draco, his cock disappearing inside that mouth, his mind empty of all coherent thought.
I spent the night with him. And it wasn’t in a moody silence outside, in our secret spot, it was in his room, in his bed.
His eyes snap open. Behind his glasses, they look very green, very wide. I watch as my spit runs slowly down his chin. He breathes hard. I lean over and lick the spit right off his face. My tongue traces the corner of his lips. I feel his hot breath on me, the minty rush from his cigarettes. He makes a helpless little sound with the back of his throat, like a stifled moan. It makes me nearly crazed. I release his throat. My fingers leave faint marks on his neck. His jaw shines in the exact place where my tongue has been.
‘You were saying my name… begging me. I want to hear it again.’
I was joking
‘I bought a bottle of dye to retouch it. It comes off as I wash it. Mother will have a fit, of course.’ He laughs. He’s so close to me, that his laugh reverberates on my skin. ‘She’ll just have to get used to it.’
You’d probably like to know what they said to each other.
Someone decided I should have a private room. Most nights, she ends up in my bed. We fuck. She sleeps. Maybe that’s the real reason she comes here. To be able to sleep. I lean over to kiss her forehead. A crease of hurt is painted in the corner of her mouth. The irony of it all is that I can conquer death, but not this.
‘Has it occurred to you that he- oh no, don’t interrupt me, Draco. I have been keeping up with your pining for years, so you’re going to listen to me now.’
‘Tell me why you had Josh refuse them.’
‘It’s the middle of the afternoon, Draco.’
‘I violently dislike you.’ He says flatly.
For a moment, they weren’t Dom’s eyes, they were just Draco’s.
‘I’m seeing a Healer,’ He says, solemn, nervous. ‘A Mind Healer.’ He swallows. ‘She’s helping me deal with-’ he gestures in the general direction of the trees, the castle, the darkness. ‘Well- Everything.’
He tries again.
The words unleashed something in Draco. His hand shot to Harry’s throat. Harry let out a broken whimper that zinged straight to Draco’s cock. His hand tightened around Harry’s neck, constricting. Harry gasped, then stopped fighting it, his body going pliant under Draco’s hands. His eyes were wide and dark, his lips wet, parted, and still he kept his posture as best as he could.
‘It’s Malfoy to you,’ I say, trying to sound as bored as I can. The heel of his hand presses inefficiently against my cock. ‘And… you’re not that good.’
‘You want another medal for that great accomplishment?’ I ask, when my words finally catch up with my brain and probably my heart. ‘The Golden Playboy manages to keep it in his pants-’ My tone is now high pitched, and I’m beyond thankful for the silencing charm.
‘Beautiful. But you can do better than that, Harry. I’ve had to deal with you strutting around in your fucking Auror robes for too long, teasing me with just one of your looks.’
And then it stops. Draco does too, just in time.
‘Sometimes we need a bit of light in darkness to see what’s right in front of us.’
‘Eager, are we?’ Malfoy’s voice was low. It made Harry want to fall down on his knees and suck Malfoy’s cock. He was ashamed at the thought. He hadn’t even satisfied his Doms - Josh, sitting comfortably on a sofa nearby, watching them and probably pulling at his hard cock and Malfoy standing right behind him, sadistic smile and crop in hand - he didn’t deserve the gift of cock.
is on my tongue as I step outside. No out of bounds places for me now. I can go anywhere I want. I can even leave Hogwarts. I doubt anyone would stop me. But all I think about is going
I immediately realise this is the wrong thing to say to someone like him.
Draco realises, belatedly, he is nodding at Potter, but he doesn’t know what he’s agreeing to. Potter cracks a smile.
It’s such a simple question, but it takes your breath away. You shake your head.
‘I’ve gone crazy with wanting you.’
He makes a noise with his throat, a sort of strangled thing, his eyes averted from yours.
He touches me like I’m his fucking property, mouth dropping words into my ear, slow decadence. He tells me:
‘Very,’ I say coldly.
‘You’re gonna love this one, Harry… he’s really your type’
Draco takes a step back.
He tries to grab my hips, but I stop him, force his arms down on the mattress. I am in charge, for the first time since this started. He has fucked me in every position, but never like this. He looks up at me like I’m the god on his altar. He doesn’t know it’s the other way around. This is why we can never work. It is never a good idea to want someone on an altar.
How could a man like Harry let himself go like that? It wasn’t the submission that impressed him, no. Draco had had many submissives along the years. He’d brought several men to the pits of subspace and back again to the living world. He did it easily, for fun, for the kicks, to get himself off
I finally dare to take a deep breath. My heart feels like it’s about to climb up my throat.
I leave the warmth of his bed and collect my torn robes from a chair. Even touching them is too much. I can never wear them again. I need to burn them.
‘Please, fuck me,’ Harry blurted out, cheeks flaming up. ‘Fuck me, Draco. I want you.’
After that, you don’t see him for three weeks. You might have thought it’s because you didn’t cross paths, but you’re pretty sure he’s been avoiding you.
I move over him, finding my own rhythm, chasing my pleasure. His fingers curl on the sheets. His eyes are wide & wet. I have never wanted him this much. I bring my hand to his chest & ride him, slow, slow, slower. He trembles underneath me, his neck corded. He bites on his lip, delaying the moment as much as he can. He looks drunk on me.
‘Do you want me to leave you alone?’ I ask.
‘Will you hex me if I kiss you right now?’
‘She just- She told me to put the fucking pieces together. And I- I did.’
out of mutual admiration or infatuation. I have no idea what we’re doing this out for. Lust. Masochism. Self-deprecation. Three gods on the altar of my self-destruction.
From the shadows he watched as Josh fastened Harry’s hands and ankles to the spanking bench, so that Harry was bent over the leather, his back, arse and legs completely exposed to everyone on that side of the room. A welcoming sight for sure. On the other side, Draco had been faced with those eyes, no glasses, nothing to save him from facing them. And they were looking everywhere, wildly searching the room for something.
Draco willed his face to look expressionless. He did not want Josh to see how much this information affected him. Deeply. It might be kind of
‘Let me go, Matthew.’ I say, a bit louder this time. I sound pathetic, hoping that saying his name will make him hesitate, maybe stop.
He raises his hand and brushes his hair back, but the blond strand falls into place again. The ring on his finger catches the rainbow lights from above. His fingernails are painted black. It suits him. He slants me another look. Night after night, this is what we do.
‘Needy thing,’ said the cold posh voice.
His thoughts were jumbled, his fists clenched to the point of pain. He’d never come without permission, he was starting to panic, he couldn’t, he couldn’t, Malfoy hadn’t said yes… he couldn’t be a bad slut, he wouldn’t, he wanted to be so good for Malfoy…
I want to kiss him. It’s the first thing in fucking ages that I want like this.
They stared at each other for some time. Draco felt he was spinning downwards, losing ground, looking through a kaleidoscopic vision of his own life up until now. It all looked so grey - up until Harry came into view.
That night, and all the others that followed, Draco took Harry home.
‘You can touch me,’ he whispered to Harry.
None of us speaks for a moment.
‘My mother is going to Paris, to be with our relatives there.’ He says.
‘I… I want… Kiss me, please,’ he blurted out.
It’s not what I meant to say & it’s not what he was expecting either. He exhales a little breath. It’s his time to pretend:
I feel a sudden urge to laugh. I do. It’s not what people are supposed to do when they kiss, but I laugh. He laughs too. He kisses the side of my mouth. He kisses my neck. His hands move down my back, hesitant. I don’t want them to be hesitant, I want them to know how much I want. I want them to go everywhere.
Draco felt his own lips curl upwards. He was used to the effect that smile had on his submissives. How they broke under it. But Harry was taking it, drinking it in, his head tilted back and upwards, his lips open, his chest heaving. He craved it.
‘Harry… You both look so hot. I’m going to enjoy this so much,’ he felt the swell of Josh’s cock against his arse. His lips brushed over Harry’s cheek in a soft kiss. ‘Also… I let him take charge of your orgasm. You’ll come at his command,’ Josh added as an afterthought.
He moves over you. Dark above, dark under.
to fall, daring gravity to do its thing.
‘Don’t make me regret this.’ I say. I feel raw, turned inside out. ‘Just don’t.’
Draco lifted his head up, surveyed him, silent. It was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He nodded, curtly, and at once Harry’s legs wrapped around his waist, arching closer to him. Now his hole was gaping open, waiting for Draco to fill it. Draco brushed the tip of his cock against it and Harry held his breath. He’d had several men fucking him, why was he feeling like this was a first time of sorts?
‘Well, at least you stopped hexing each other’s bollocks,’ Ron says and huffs a laugh. ‘You got us worried there, mate.’ There’s no hint of judgement in the way he says it.
‘That was a simple yes or no question,’ Draco said, letting each word drop as a warning, heat coursing through his body. ‘You’re in luck that I like you talking back to me...’
‘Yes, Draco. Yes.’
most people. The most powerful wizard he knew, the Auror that he saw issuing orders about, voice firm and commanding, assured steps, had this other side to him. A darker, vulnerable, softer side... And he’d let Draco, of all people, see it.  Potter’s vulnerability felt too raw and real. Like Draco could stretch out his hand and touch it. Hold it, tease it, break it, pull it apart, make it burn, then put it gently back together again. And that was what Potter had given him. The Hero everyone knew was the same man that had gone
Harry looked back at Draco, a question in his eyes.
‘That won’t work. We’re too complicated.’
‘So you’ll do what?’ He asks, in a very soft tone. He looks straight at me. I’ve never seen such sad eyes.
‘You said I could move…’ Harry whispered and moved his hips just so, watching Draco bite in a gasp. He loved this Draco that was losing control inside him, loved to be the reason for it. He usually wasn’t like this, he was obedient, but teasing Draco, provoking him, had always been their thing… he couldn’t avoid it.
‘Well, hello Potter.’
‘I’m… I’m not that. I’m just Harry. In here I’m not even that.’
‘You were born to suck cock, Harry,’ Josh said in a rush.
I reach the foot of the stairs and grab hold of the railing. I take one step and I scream, willing my voice to be heard loud and clear:
‘And maybe spend Christmas Eve. With me, I mean,’ Potter adds, like it’s nothing.
After a while, Josh had moved to untie Harry. The clamps were off, Harry’s nipples red and hard. They would be so sensitive just then. Perfect to bite on.
Harry felt Malfoy’s body tensing up, merely inches from his own. The burning sensation built up around him and there was sweat trickling down his back.
Malfoy held him, his hands massaging his wrists and it felt so caring, so strange. Harry was shaking, Malfoy turning him around, holding his weight against the cross. His arse hurt, but the change in position helped to relax his limbs, and so did Malfoy’s hands holding him, one on his hip, one on his back. Malfoy pressed his forehead to Harry’s.
The ritual is the dark. You breathe it in, breathe it out.
‘Fuck me.’
I swear I want to slap him. An intense laugh rips out of me. My eyes water.
And with that he takes all my breath away.
‘Draco!’
After that, we play this game.
Draco pulled on the leash. Harry gasped, struggled to keep his position, kneeling before Draco, arms tucked behind him, head held high.
Because yes, I’m the only one of his hookups he feels the need to hide from the press. The usual flock of reporters & photographers waiting for him outside by the front door of the club. I’m the only one he doesn’t want to be seen with; the only one of his pickups whose shady picture won’t be plastered to the frontpage of every wizarding newspaper the next day. Because he’s ashamed of being seen with me. Ashamed of me. Disgusted, even.
, certain as all the other certain things in the world. Like the sun rising tomorrow; like time passing; like the fact that we’re all going to die in the end. Even those of us who have died before & came back to save the world, yes, even him, one day, he is going to die and, if I don’t die first, I will be in love with him up until then.
He releases me the second we stop on the dark familiar street. He walks ahead of me again. I watch his back, his shoulders. My heart aches with a hunger that I know will never be sated. It’s never good to fall this hard, down the abyss of someone.
I almost laugh at the sort of terrified look on his face.
I watch him leaving, the black sweater hugging his slumping shoulders, hands disappearing into the pockets of his well-worn jeans. I lose interest in whatever the bloke is doing and yank his hands away.
Another Healer comes over. A different one. She says she heals minds. I laugh.
There’s a fundraiser in downtown London, nothing fancy, but you’ve never been this bored in your life. The muscles on your face hurt from all the smiling, but you thank Merlin for the flow of drinks, empty glasses being easily exchanged for full ones.
He surveys you, his eyes still unreadable, though his cheeks look warmer.
‘I want to leave for a while. Go abroad, travel, doesn’t really matter where. What matters is... I want you to come with me. To spend the Summer with me.’
This Christmas Eve is unlike any other day of his life.
‘So that’s what you do when you go to London? Like today?’
He’s right. And telling him so is out of the question so I just stare at him. He takes a deep breath, his cheeks turning slightly red.
‘I know what he likes alright…’ Josh said in a rush. ‘This is exactly what he likes…
What? He was confused. He’d thought he’d had his luck. One kiss.
‘Where’s Draco? Draco…’
‘Green,’ he said, catching his breath to reply.
I run from him, towards the lake. I think of drowning, of silence and stillness.
‘We're not going to fuck. We’re having tea. And a hangover potion for you,’ he steps back, pulls back a chair for me to sit, and surprising even myself, I sit down without a retort. I watch him walk over to the counter, pick up the sugar bowl.
it, but if I could see it somehow it would be better-
Thank you so much for sticking with this little story. It was a joy for me to write it and also therapeutical, drarry always helps me through depressive stuff. Anyhow, I'm not on tumblr or anywhere interesting, but I do have a ton of other drarry fics that you can read right here if you liked this one! :) thank you to all the readers, the ones that gave kudos, the ones that commented and the ones that read it anyway!
Now, my last boyfriend, Andrew… he was the perfect cup of tea. He wasn’t exactly warm & steady Earl Grey. He was more like a mild & tasteless camomile. Good for my nerves, but, oh, was he bland.
I drop down beside him, too close. I might as well be sitting on his lap since I’m being so obvious, but he doesn’t seem to notice. He looks at my Dark Mark, the white scarring visible under the tattoos. I feel like he’s the only one who has the right to look at it so intently, so I let him. I imagine his fingers trailing over my inner arm, gentle, then his hands gripping my wrists, pressing them against the mattress. The picture is so strong I have to force myself to speak to make it go away.
‘She loves books,’ Parkinson says amusedly. I’m about to combust. ‘She invited me over to check her library.’
Josh chuckled. He pulled Harry up, parting his legs, putting him on display for Draco.
He closed his eyes again, unable to keep them open. Josh was kissing his temple.
‘Flannagan… I- We were sort of… shagging.’
‘I made you beg for a kiss too, didn’t I?’ Draco captured Harry’s lower lip with his teeth and bit down on it slowly. Harry moaned.
‘You fancy yourself too much,’ Draco says. He turns to look at the tree. The lights dance in seemingly random patterns. Like life, he thinks.
Ignoring him is easy at first. Not because you try, but because you don’t care.
‘How’s Granger?’ I ask, wishing nothing more than to change the subject.
‘Moan for me, Harry,’ Malfoy whispered, lips over his throat.
‘I bought Rose a new broom,’ he says.
He came back to it with Draco kissing along his hipbone, his every touch a torture Harry wanted never to end. He watched as Draco licked his own lips, and then as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He stood up, his hands climbing up Harry’s chest.
‘Know it was him? You wouldn’t look him in the eye- you always look people in the eye, whatever their opinions of you.’
I spent most of this year looking at him, searching for something, but this is it. I feel like a dam is breaking, all of the things I’ve been trying to keep together, contained, escaping me.
To my knowledge, this is the only class he still shows up to. This random realisation hits me at the same time his hex throws me down to the floor.
‘Hey,’ he said.
Draco took his sweet time opening his trousers. He unbuckled the belt, then let the buttons on his fly slip open. He pushed his black pants down, his right hand cupping his bollocks. He felt heady with how slowly he was moving, but Harry made it so worth it. He looked beyond desperate. Draco took his own cock in hand. Harry let out a broken cry.
I laugh in his face.
‘Here?’
‘I want to worship it… Can I?’
The confident-shy way he said it. The way he let his Draco’s cock rub against his lips.
‘Is that what you really want, Draco?’
The grey eyes were dark, like a gathering storm. He did it again. Just to be sure he wasn’t imagining it.
He’s still there. Sleeping beside you. His hair a mess. His back showing the faint marks of your fingernails. His body a thing of evidence. Solid, real.
His words from last night — I can’t forget them. Most days it’s as if he’s become the legend he is supposed to be. Half-unreal. Half-attached to life. Half-gone. Right now he looks more real to me than the castle walls, even if
Green eyes come sharply into focus.
I wish I could tell you I decided to live when he saved me for the second, third time?… I lose count. But the truth is I didn’t. I didn’t decide on it. I only had my wand and his hand on mine, pulling me away again.
You kiss me, your mouth with all the things you kept from me until now. You are tender where your words were shards. I cup your face, clutching reality, to stop the spinning.
‘Harry,’ I say. I have no idea how to go on.
I watch as her eyes make a slow tour of the room I’ve been living in. Discarded Kleenexes, several bottles of Firewhisky, half empty flasks of potions, dirty glasses everywhere. It’s like watching a stranger’s life through another’s eyes. I watch her eyebrows go up. Her eyeliner is on point, as per usual. Her nose wrinkles slightly.
Harry’s answer was a whimper, and his body stretching and moving to take Josh.
My mouth is open for him to take over. He fucking does. His hands so soft, his tongue inside my mouth, daring and slow, and fucking sweet Merlin, if this kiss is anything to go by he’s going to
‘I want to be so good for you, Draco… fill me up,’ he hitched his hips up again, and Draco grunted against him. Harry couldn’t believe what he was doing or saying. He wanted to be filled with Draco, stuffed with him everywhere.
‘I love your arse,’ Draco grunted, voice breaking in a low moan. He’d stopped being slow and careful, and Harry could not look away from his face, contorted in pleasure, his teeth biting on his lower lip. He looked blissed-out, and he looked like that because he was inside Harry.
‘We tried casual. It didn’t work. We just ended up hurting each other.’
For a hard second, I’m totally lost. But then I get it. Mirna — his Healer.
‘Fuck, Potter, I knew your arse would be like this…’
but yeah… This isn’t going as I planned.’
He’d counted on his self-preservation to keep away, so he couldn’t quite logically justify why he was back at the club, one week later,
I know I’ll be broken, in the same way I know the startling fact of his tongue parting my lips, sliding into my mouth. His hands go around my neck, he pulls me gently down to him. My heart clenches in a painful way, everything sways, dissolves around me, nothing beyond the hard fact of him — as he kisses me for the first time, fire & whisky on his tongue.
‘Is that why you made me beg for it? ‘Cause it’s overrated?’ Harry traced the inner side of his shirt’s collar with his fingers. It was distracting.
Harry cast a cleaning wandless spell over the both of them. Draco was half-thankful, half-amused, and thoroughly turned-on by the display of power in any case.
, during the afternoon. In broad daylight. For a cup of tea, of all things.
‘They’re saying Matthew Flannagan dropped out.’
She narrows her eyes.
Draco grabbed at Harry’s hair and yanked his head back, mesmerized by the contrast of his pale fingers tugging at the dark strands.
‘I left him there because I can’t stop thinking about you,’ I say. My voice is almost light, easy. I want to break his fucking sugar bowl again. Or his heart. I grip it harder, the bowl shakes in my hands. ‘And I’ve already had you. Several times. Maybe he’s a fantastic fuck, maybe he would make me forget you, maybe I could stop missing you, but yet here I am.’
He’s sweaty, out of breath. You want to tell him how beautiful he looks, how you can’t look away from him, but you’re sure he’s heard that before, so you keep your mouth shut and you fuck him. He tightens hard around you. You’re standing on the edge, he drops. His teeth sink into your shoulder as he comes, his come splattering your skin, his whole body coiling around you.
‘Feel it,’ he whispers. I close my eyes, let myself fall back into him, into silence, into me. I’m aware of the faint beat of the music, of people laughing, coming and going, of my trainers on the pavement, of his hands barely moving on my sides.
Please see the end notes for content warning.
Now that you’re in bed, he’s finally talking to you. You do as you’re told, working him open, first with just one finger, pushing slowly in and out, his body allowing you in. Two, he says, not long after. You scissor them, curl them up. He likes it. It feels like a dream.
He walks over to his coat, searching for his cigarette case. You surprise yourself by stopping him on his tracks, your hand on his arm.
Malfoy stopped, Harry tried to breathe, deep and slow, but a sob came up his throat instead. He felt like crying from too many things at once. Like Malfoy’s hand caressing his arse, soft, accessing the bruises probably. Why did they feel so good? The cane brushed teasingly over his arse cheeks, then between them.
’ he said.
, he can be quite…
‘Draco. Just… please fuck me.’
seems impossible.
His lips parted for Draco to slip his tongue inside. They kissed again, hands going everywhere. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips, fingers tightening there as they kissed, his cock rubbing against Harry’s stomach, and they were moving, Harry slightly kneeling over him on the couch, the muscles on his thighs flexing under Draco’s hands. Harry pressed his hips forward, trapping Draco’s cock between them.
They stood like that for some time, their breaths syncing up, Draco’s hands smoothing over Harry’s back. He helped Harry to sit on the bed, accioed his wand and shakily managed to do a warming spell. Harry looked up at him, thankful, at a complete loss for words. Draco was grateful because he couldn’t have said anything back.
One night, he tells me the name of every one of his ghosts. I learn them by heart. He asks about mine. My throat closes down. He says it’s okay.
Aaaaaand cliffhanger! Don't kill me! What do you think Draco is going to do next?
‘Don’t like me dirty?’ he asked, and Harry laughed, a brilliant thing.
‘So,’ he says and in it I realise he’s consenting.
I get away from him as fast as I can, and stagger through his corridor, like he’s invited me in. I hear the door closing behind me. If there’s another man in here, I’ll find him. With luck, I might even throw up on him. The thought makes me smile.
He laughs. Then he turns his back on me and opens another cabinet, taking a small flask and setting it on the table. The fucking hangover potion. He’s not making me drink that, I’ll fucking throw it at his face.
He didn’t know how long that kiss lasted. Long enough for him to be sure. Not nearly enough for what he wanted. Draco was half-carrying him, away from the cross, his arms holding Harry safely.
That night, like all the others before, Josh took Harry home.
I whirl around, distressed by his all-reasonable tone. Does he think I’m crazy? ‘Cause I’m not.
When it happens, it’s like falling.
‘I’m going to make us some tea,’ he says simply. ‘And you need a hangover potion.’
so deeply, hungrily, willingly
‘Yes, what?’
For the first time, I see caution in his eyes. He gives a tiny, unbelieving laugh.
It’s just my name in a whisper, but his voice has this way of reaching deep and untangle things for me. I can’t bear to say goodbye. Leaving Hogwarts and leaving him — it’s too much. I look up and let him see it. And then he says something completely unexpected.
‘That’s not possible-’
He’s laughing against my throat.
‘The first one is too sad and way too simple. Doesn’t fit,’ his right hand flexes, he lifts it up and I follow the movement with my eyes. He lets it fall on a knee. The way he does it is so natural I take some time to notice it’s my knee.
‘Here I am throwing myself at you and your fucking answer is
The problem wasn’t that he knew how Harry Potter looked when he was tied up, helpless, teased to the point of desperation. Nor was it that he knew how he begged for more when he had a cock up his arse, how beautiful he was when he took it all in. Even if he looked like Draco’s every fantasy come true, only even better.
Is it the KISS? :D Let me know what you thought of this ending!
Several men were watching Josh and Harry’s play, sitting on couches, standing in pairs and groups. It wouldn’t be long before one of them made an offer for Harry. The thought made Draco feel uneasy. He took a long sip of his wine, washing the feeling down.
He keeps hitting the frontpage of every wizarding publication, a different man on his arm every night. Meanwhile, I party all night, play the unavailable-distant type to everyone who approaches me, sometimes getting a blow job out of it, just for the sake of watching the hard look on his face when I leave with someone else. I drink my way to an early coffin & watch as he hits on every good-looking blonde he finds, his body pinning them like flies on the wall. Not that they’re not willing, oh so willing. He only leaves the club with them when I tell him no. Sometimes, I deny him for the pure, unadulterated pleasure of seeing his reaction, the rigid set of his jaw, the tense shrug of his shoulders, the curl of his lips in a smile I’ve come to cherish, as he leans in closer & whispers in my ear:
He stops suddenly, grabs my hair with such force that my scalp burns, pulls me up and bashes me against the wall. It’s all so quick that I hit the stone blindly. I feel something warm and liquid running down my nose. The pain starts there and irradiates everywhere. He’s on me, forcing me against the wall again, his hand around my neck. I’m choking, there are dark spots in my vision, my skull rattles. A silent scream inside my head.
Malfoy’s hands pressed harder into his hips and his fingers roamed freely over Harry’s body, anywhere they wanted to go. They skimmed over the hairs on Harry’s thighs and then came too close to his cock. Harry’s eyes shot open only to be faced with the  darkness inside the blindfold.
He finishes on the last button and steps back. His face is tinged in red, his eyes shine with purpose, and I almost feel like he’s getting off on denying me now.
There’s a hint of a smile on his lips.
The rest of what Ron is saying sinks into the background noise. You nod out of habit. These days, it’s all background noise anyway.
The ground is a harsh black. My hands are so white, but they’re dirty, scratched everywhere. One of my nails is broken. I don’t remember when that happened. A drop of blood falls on my hand, red on white. My face hurts. Everything is ruined. Everything is dirty.
Green eyes, messy hair, Gryffindor scarf. The light shines a bright gold so intense it blinds Draco suddenly and then, just like that, the little light is out.
She seems to understand this intuitively, like she always does. She sits back, smiles sadly at me & I bring my head to her lap, closing my eyes. She pets my hair gently. I’m about to sob all over her perfect dress & she doesn’t even care. That’s true friendship, right there.
Harry let his head fall back on Malfoy’s shoulder. How long had they been at it? He had a high pain threshold. Doms liked that in him. It wasn’t easy to break him, so most of them looked at it like a challenge. He wondered if Malfoy thought him challenging. If he was enjoying this. If he was pleased. Nothing seemed more important than that now.
Another boy runs after him. This one has dark hair, a green jumper. They meet halfway, two silhouettes, standing apart, coming together. The blond, taller boy kisses the other. His hands are on the jumper, white against green.
‘Come, Harry. Come for us. Come from my mouth on you…’ Draco whispered.
‘Yeah, I’d like that one last time,’ Josh said in a rough voice.
‘Oh fuck, his mouth.’ Josh threw his head back and cursed again.
‘I already told you-’

You can’t keep down a nervous laugh. He’s easily the most beautiful man you’ve ever been with. But that’s not what’s making you feel this way.
He steps on my wand. I hear the distinct sound of wood rasping against stone. My heart misses a beat, I’m paralised in terror.
‘To be honest,’ he says, sounding casual. ‘I always thought of you fucking me.’ He pauses, then adds. ‘Hard.’
‘That’s the thing,’ I say and I trace the smudge on the table with my fingernails. I know he remembers it too. It’s all in the way he’s silent, unmoving. Like he’s afraid I’ll go up in smoke if only he moves too fast. I’m not sure I won’t.
Of course he does. He never makes this easier. No matter how much I need it to be casual, it never is. I look into his eyes. The pull of his gravity, it wins over everything. Even self-preservation. I can lie all I want with my words, but my body speaks the truth & if there’s something Potter can read is my body, every shift, every sigh, every fucking weakness. His hand drags over my hips. His fingers curl on the hoops of my trousers. I know what’s coming. We’re pressed chest to chest, we’re both slowly getting hard. His mouth is right there, lips parted. They move softly over my cheek, then closer & closer to where I want them. He places a kiss, open mouthed, right at the corner of my lips. It’s absurd, the effect it has over me. My mouth chases his, my hands are shaking, he laughs, evading my tentative kiss. He loves to drive me mad with it. Toying with my desire for him, making me burn in a slow deep fire. He drags his mouth over my jaw, biting lightly. I’ve seen him kiss man after man at the damned club. But not me, no. After that first time, he only kisses me when I’m so crazy with it that I’m crying out his name, begging him. Begging for anything.
I know it, because I never had it so good before. It’s the first time, and I’m in awe of it. Of him.
like that. They called him many things. But his name on Malfoy’s lips was like a drug. It felt all kinds of wrong and right.
‘Yeah.’ I breathe.
Edit: omg I just realised this fic is 18888 words long and has 18/18 chapters wth? Is there any kind of sign in there? I swear I didn't plan this!
One speaks.
Pansy laughs. It’s a bright, soft laugh, the kind of laugh only possible after the War.
I reach the door and turn back to look at him.
Bet you she’s arguing with it
The first thrust of his hips still caught Harry by surprise. His body convulsed around Draco, his arms tensed on the restraints as he tried to push back into the feeling. He wasn’t ready for this, for the intense response of his body. His thighs tensed around Draco, pulling him close, as Draco thrust into him, slow but steady, like he knew exactly what Harry needed. Harry heard himself scream when another thrust hit his prostate and he jerked, forced down by Draco’s hands, one on his leg, keeping it up, the other on his chest, pressing down.
Harry kissed him again. They were becoming ever better at it. At slowing down when their breaths were uneven, at teasing each other with bites and little kisses that turned to filthy ones, at panting for each other, at letting their bodies find the ways they fitted best, which really wasn’t all that difficult. Harry fitted with him in a way he couldn’t quite believe. Draco’s cock had started to wilt, but he was getting hard again with the sounds Harry kept making in his ear.
I run. I run as fast as I can, pulling my pants up, my ripped robes around me, ignoring the searing pain in my forehead, on my nose, on my hands, I run and run and run mindlessly. I look back but he's not following me. The castle feels empty, quiet, my frantic breathing echoing off the walls, like the only living thing, a desperate sound.
