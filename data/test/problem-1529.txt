“Let go of my Spectrespecs!” Luna shouted possessively as his arms had accidentally knocked them askew.
Hogwarts to London,
“So long, baby.” Harry replied with droopy ears and whiskers.
Scorpius took the first verse and sang very well, doing his best to follow the recommendations of the song and not sound nasally. His voice was rather good for a kitten. James took the second verse, still playing the piano as he did so. Draco sat happily in his chair, eyes closed, nodding his head to the beat as they sang. Scorpius attempted to pick the song back up once more but James had gone off of the script and started to play a random song on the piano, to show off. Speaking of showing off…soon James had climbed on the piano and was using all four paws to play it! And dancing on top of the keys!
Lucius takes the cats away from the mansion and into the countryside, little did he expect to run into two vicious dogs though! Lots of Sirius and Remus shenanigans, and funny parts of them trying to get Lucius of their farm. Then Draco and his kittens meet Harry!
“Maybe just a short, sweet goodbye would be easiest.” Harry offered.
Harry James Potter,
“Both of you, go ahead.”
Lucius lost his balance atop the motorcycle and his leg moved to the sidecar. The sidecar jerked to the side again and Lucius fell forward, terrified of hitting his face on the ground. His hands started to walk on the ground beneath him in order to keep his head up while his legs were in a painful splits. Remus had moved away from the foot at first, not wanting to get hurt again, but once he realized that Lucius had no way to move his foot, Remus decided to get revenge. Smiling, he rolled up the man’s pant leg, and then went to town biting on the man’s thigh and calf.
“Woah! Woah! Ohh!” They all yelled as the haystack crashed into a wheelbarrow. Lucius managed to split off his section of the hay, sitting on the side car instead. Remus and Sirius continued fighting as they took off in the haystack, not realizing that Lucius was no longer inside the hay.
“Fine, okay. I am cock sick and I need you to come help me. Now get that sexy ass home now!” Draco’s desire was almost palpable through the phone.
Harry, guessing the cause of the sound, reassured Draco by squeezing his hand. He pulled Draco into his arms and held him tightly. “We don’t have to get in with them if you don’t want to. If you want to and are nervous we could try the disillusionment charmed water gear. What do you say, my love?” Harry asked, kissing the blond’s forehead.
The kittens jumped down first, excited at the idea of a surprise and their dads followed them curiously. Ron had recovered from the flash by this point and ran after James, grabbing hold of the kitten’s tail so that he could keep up. Luna started to pack up the revised will, getting ready to head out for the night when music reached her ears.
“Well yes my love, but you must be very quiet.” Draco permitted.
All of the kittens perked up at that information, especially James and Albus, who were still walking.
“We’re twin brothers.” Fred added helpfully.
Meanwhile, Remus had landed in the sidecar and Sirius had jumped over to ride the motorcycle. Sirius had the handlebars in his paws and was driving excitedly, tongue flying in the breeze. Remus laughed as the bike kept going faster, enjoying the ride immensely.
“I’ve heard some corny birds who tried to sing…” Harry sang as the kittens fell through the top of their hat. Pansy walked over to them to sing her line.
Solemnly up to mischief,
Draco turned his most dashing smile on Harry at that, hoping to adopt more kittens when their current babies had grown up. Harry’s face betrayed his shock for just a tiny bit before he relaxed and smiled back at his gorgeous partner. Harry sat up straight and tried not to mess with his collar. It was a very new sensation to have something around his neck, especially such a stiff collar. But now, he matched the family with his little bow in the middle and it made him happy though he would never admit it aloud.
“Oh, he got me.” Ron whimpered dramatically.
Draco and his kittens rounded the bend and managed to find the shore that Harry was being brought to. Albus called out excitedly, “Look Pa! There he is.”
Ron had managed to slip out of the door unnoticed and was running down the sidewalk, hoping this Potter cat was still nearby. He got to the main sidewalk, looked around, and saw a black cat turning a corner not too far from him. Ron started running once more, going as fast as his little legs would carry him. Hoping to get the cat’s attention, Ron started to yell as he ran, “Mr. Potter!” But he tripped and had to pick himself up so that he could keep chasing the black cat he needed. Ron managed to get ahead of the cat and yelled up at him, “hey stop!”
Ron snuck up to Lucius’s shoes and tied the shoelaces together quickly. Hoping that the man would trip and not be able to make it to the door. However, the cork was pointed at Lucius’s feet so when it came loose, it shot straight at poor Ron and hit him in the gut. He flew against the piano from the impact and landed with an oof.
“James come back here. Haven’t you forgotten something, darling?” Draco reminded him gently.
They went back to holding hands as they walked farther along the trail, both men now enthusiastically searching for the source of the noise. A giant boulder was in front of them, and it wasn’t until they walked around it that the waterfall came into view. Harry and Draco gasped in unison at the breathtaking view before them, the waterfall seemed to have carved a path for itself into the moss covered rocks all around it. The rocks glinted in the sunlight where the moss seemed to have been washed away at some point. The water was a brilliant turquoise where it fell, before it hit the bottom and turned into white water, churning with momentum. The pool of the waterfall was also a sparkling turquoise, the whole area was serenely beautiful and Harry and Draco felt certain they had found paradise. They walked towards the curtain of water, watching their step as they went so that they wouldn’t fall in. As their eyes continued to scan the landmark, Harry realized there was a small, natural water slide to the right of the big waterfall. He pointed it out eagerly and he and Draco rushed over to investigate.
Albus walked over to check it out and agreed with his brother’s observation.
“Why, Mr. Potter, you are amazing.” Draco gushed.
“Another flight into the fantasy, Monsieur Potter?” Draco asked with a chuckle.
“Oh Sirius, we done bit six tires today,” Remus said, stretching as he exited his pile. “Chased four motorcars,  a bicycle and a scooter,” Remus complained, cranky at the lack of sleep. Nevertheless, he trotted his short legs behind Sirius, wondering what his role was going to be this time. If he had it his way, he would still be asleep right now, but Sirius was loud when he wanted to do something. So it was better to just appease the other dog.
“Oh, ha. Lucius, old chap, get used to the finer things in life. Someday they’re all going to be yours, you sly old fox.” Lucius complimented himself as he pulled out a bottle of champagne and started to work the cork out.
“No, no, no baby. You just hide over there, and you leave the rest to J. Harry Potter.” The black cat said with a bow before turning to climb up the tree nearest him.
Scorpius ran out of the basket and sat next to Harry, gazing up at the black cat excitedly. “Oh, that would be wonderful,” the white kitten said excitedly.
Lucius grabbed his jacket and ran to open the door for their guest, having heard the car pull up. He managed to open the door before Luna could knock, which had been his goal.
“Papa, do I have sparkling diamond eyes that dazzle too?” Scorpius interrupted.
Everyone stopped what they were doing, which had Ron been looking, probably would have made him laugh. Lucius was standing with one leg partially in the air, trying to shake off a chubby Blaise, his other leg clung onto by Neville. Lucius had poor Seamus by the tail and Dean by the neck, one cat per arm. Pansy was atop the man’s head about to go in for a nice scratching attack. Harry had been about to join the fray so he stayed put, watching Ron work intently. Now that he could hear, Ron picked the lock rather easily, smiling as he heard the click of the lock opening. That click was everyone else’s cue to go back to fighting and soon the sounds of cats fighting and Lucius grumbling filled his ears again. Harry ran to help open the trunk, jumping inside to check on Draco and the kittens.
"What? I didn't mean anything by it. Clearly I meant your Mum. I mean I assume she needs you to carry on your family name and everything."
Draco and Harry swapped places, so that Harry was laying atop his desk. Draco smiled down at his husband, a sexy smirk on his face as he panted in excitement. Harry smiled up at the blond man before reaching up to bring Draco’s face to his. Draco returned Harry’s kiss as he slowly entered Harry, and both men moaned loudly at the sensation. Draco didn’t stay slow for long though and he gave Harry a minute to adjust before losing his control.
“Mr. George Weasley.”
“A muggle with a horn, makes you wish you weren’t born, every time he plays.” The duet continued as they followed the frame back the other way.
“Hey, Pans Cat, blow some of that sweet stuff my way,” Harry said announcing his presence.
“Oh, yes, Monsieur Potter. These are my children,” Draco answered as he looked at his kittens fondly.
“Oh, no. No. We mean far more to her than that. Oh, I’m so sorry my dear. We just have to go home tomorrow,” Draco lamented snuggling closer to Harry and nuzzling his neck.
“I’ll bet it’s more than a thousand,” whined James.
“Thank you, Mr. Potter, for saving my life.” Scorpius added.
Annoyed and tired of being yelled at, Remus whined his response, “Aw, I get blamed for everything.”
“Well, he didn’t hurt me. He hit me on the head,” Remus giggled.
“Good evening Monsieur Ron.” Draco responded formally, smiling at the mouse.
Harry Potter the alley cat.”
“I wouldn’t take up much room,” Scorpius argued.
“Why, thank you,” Harry replied with a flattered smile. “And what might your name be?”
“I’ve got curiosity,
The kittens trotted along happily chugga chugging as they stepped in sync with each other. Next Albus imitated a whistle while he led his siblings, with Draco and Harry walked along behind the kittens, keeping an eye on them. Albus shifted to a new noise, clickety clack, clickety clack, before imitating a whistle once more. Only this time, Albus’s sound effect was followed by a real train whistle! A train was coming straight towards them from the other side of the bridge!
Knowing that the cats were still fast asleep, Lucius waited without a care in the world as his engine popped to life. He was just another motorbike on the street, nothing new or interesting about him at all. Plus if the cats were still fast asleep, there would be no witnesses at all to his evil scheme. Grinning at his genius, Lucius made a U-turn on the road and headed off down the road, his hat popping up off his head every time his bike backfired. Lucius didn’t care, though. Why would he, when he was about to be rich? He started to turn down a street before realizing it would take him by the police station, so he swerved to make another U-turn and kept going on the road he was on for a bit longer. His nerves were definitely still on edge, impairing his judgment and making it hard for him to focus.
Narcissa was in the middle of a weird dream when suddenly a rumble of thunder woke her up. “Draco? Kittens? Oh my gracious. I had the most horrible dream about them,” Narcissa said, rubbing her temple before shaking her head to clear out the bad dream. “Thank goodness it was only a dream. Oh dear, what a terrible night,” Narcissa added, hugging herself as she left the warmth of her covers and put her house slippers on. She grabbed her wrap to put on as she walked over to the bed her cats slept in, speaking words of comfort.
"You don't own this room either, Malfoy and somehow I doubt they can tell the time of day without you. And I know of some other people who need you around."
“Oh, cricket bugs don’t wear shoes,” Remus countered.
“Scorpius! Scorpius!” Draco yelled in a panic, unsure of what to do. He couldn’t leave his other two sons behind and he didn’t want them jumping out of the truck and possibly getting hurt, but he couldn’t leave Scorpius either.
“Modulate and wait for me.
“But why can’t you?” Harry asked, confused.
“Well what I had in mind was kind of a sports model, baby. You know one of those…”
“Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris. So if you would be just so kind and show me the way…” Draco asked hopefully.
“Uh, I guess I had a nightmare and fell out of bed.”
“Yes, Monsieur Potter?” Draco responded calmly, not wanting to get his hopes up. For all he knew, they were simply heading the wrong way and the alley cat wanted to correct them. But Draco desperately hoped that Harry would join them. He was very intrigued by this black cat, and for some reason Harry made him feel safe.
By this point Harry had reached Draco and started to circle the other cat he was serenading. Draco was doing his best to remain composed and act as if this happened to him all the time. He had switched to grooming his other front paw in between watching Harry.
Not paying attention to his friend’s predicament, Sirius said, “Listen. Wheels approaching.”
Ron continued running for a while, until his surroundings and fear started to sink in. He looked around the alley he was in and felt fear take hold of him. “No trouble, he said. Well, that’s easy for…for what’s his name to say. He’s got nine lives. I’ve only got one.”
“Could we take the elevator this time, Madame?” Lucius asked warily.
Harry had been next to Hagrid as he spoke, and when the large goose leaned into him, Harry leaned away quickly, wrinkling his nose. The goose smelled like a pub. “Basted? He’s been marinated in it.”
“Oh indeed, I do.”
“Where’s my beddy-bye basket?” Remus cried.
In between chuckles, Fred and George managed to pick up their uncle and drape his wings across their backs to support him. “Come along, Uncle Hagrid.” George whispered.
“I’ll bet they’re on that magic carpet right now.” Harry grinned.
“Oww! Ooh! Ow! Criminently!” Remus whined, holding his head in pain. He glared at Sirius angrily before walking back to another pile of hay to go back to sleep. Sirius curled up next to his partner, grumbling to himself about the thief getting away. Both dogs fell asleep quickly though, tired from the night’s festivities.
“Yes, we British like to keep things proper.” George agreed. He and his twin started to chuckle once more.
“And somebody stole my bumbershoot.”
“Look, I’m gonna need help.” Harry instructed nudging Ron along.
“And you said we’re gonna ride on your magic carpet,” James added accusingly.
While the dogs were arguing, Lucius slipped off his squeaky shoes and put them behind the haystack the dogs were sleeping in front of. He still held his fishing pole, and as he set the shoes on the ground, Lucius walked closer to the pile of hay hoping to get his items back with his rod.
All three of the kittens shook their heads eagerly to show they were ready, hanging on to Harry’s every word. They all had big eyes, wide with excitement and curiosity. Harry smiled down at them before he led them in the “spell”.
“You can be replaced, you know,” Sirius replied grumpily, knowing full well he would never be able to replace Remus.
“Well, shoot fire. Don’t get sore at me. I ain’t done nothing.” Remus defended himself grumpily as he turned in the basket so that his head was under the opening now, and his paws stuck over the edge.
“All right. I’m not.” Harry said while he licked his front paw nonchalantly before turning to look at the twins.
Once at the front door, he pushed his head through the cat door and looked around. No one appeared to be outside during this time of  night. Lucius let out a sigh of relief and opened the door as quietly as possible. He looked around as he stepped outside, holding the bassinet in his hands, hoping that no one would see him. He was so busy looking around at the lack of people outside that he tripped over a trash can near the door. The trash can fell over with a crash, and Lucius’s face landed right up against the blanket the cats were sleeping behind. He didn’t drop them, or actually fall himself, but it had been close. Once his balance was restored, Lucius shook his ponytail out of his face and looked back at the door.
“My pleasure entirely. Aloha. Auf weidersehen. Bonsoir. Sayonara. And all those goodbye things, baby.” Harry waved sadly, while the truck started to drive away.
“Papa!” Scorpius shouted from the water below.
“How romantic.” Scorpius sighed from behind a nearby rock.
“Indeed, not.” George agreed.
Harry spurred to action immediately, running towards the little white kitten and grabbing him by the scruff. Harry ran with Scorpius in his mouth and jumped onto the edge of the truck. Scorpius flopped onto the truck bed and gathered his paws under him. Once righted, Scorpius ran over to his father, hiding under his legs, scared to be near the edge.Harry hung on for dear life by his front paws, hoping for a nice bump to boost him into the truck.
“Scorpius darling, Scorpius, you must stop that. This, this is really not gentlemanly. Same goes for you James, such behavior is most unbecoming to such a lovely kitten.” Draco chided his children when he found them wrestling.
Because a cat’s the only cat,
“We are not chickens. We’re geese.” George informed the black cat seriously.
“And don’t worry about form. It will come later.” Fred encouraged Harry.
“Hermione, here comes Lucius.”
“Oh, boy, fellas, let’s rock the joint!” Seamus said excitedly as he started to drum his heart out on his pots and pans.
“Yeah, they’re old buddies, and they’re…they’re real swingers.”
“That always makes me laugh Madame.” Lucius responded dryly, rolling his eyes when Luna wasn’t looking. He truly couldn’t stand this woman; she drove him crazy. But he wanted to be as kind as possible to her, hoping that it would be enough to keep him in Narcissa’s will. He wanted to keep his lifestyle and he honestly wasn’t sure he could find a decent job even if his life depended on it. He wasn’t a very good butler currently even though he knew this house like the back of his hand. He still had at least one mishap a day, making his chances of getting hired by someone who didn’t know him rather slim. Luna tripped again, breaking Lucius out of his inner downward spiral monologue as he tried to steady her once more.
“Oh no, no Luna. To my cats.” Narcissa corrects her attorney before she can finish her list.
Harry flailed more in the water, and fell back under the surface once more. The geese still swam behind him watching him curiously.
They were so busy looking ahead of them, that neither dog looked down to see Lucius’s abandoned shoes directly in their path. Sirius’s long legs stepped over the shoes but Remus didn’t lift his paws high enough, and his back feet got stuck inside the squeaky shoes. He kept walking as if nothing had happened, though, and as the squeaky sound reached his ears again he whispered to his partner, “Hey, Sirius, it’s them shoes again.”
It was at that moment that a knock came and Narcissa said in her sing-song voice, “Come in.”
“Wait for me, wait for me!” James yells as he chases Albus back to the mansion, Scorpius trailing behind him slightly.
“Get him, get him, get him!!!” Sirius yelled.
Draco cuddled up close to Harry and nestled his head under the black cat’s neck.
Hermione whinnied indignantly at the slap, rearing her front legs in annoyance. Poor Ron was sent flying into a sack of feed but thankfully didn’t land on the hard stone floor. Lucius was laughing so hard that he didn’t see Ron go flying. Lucius’s laughter had made it impossible for him to stand so he ended up leaning on a post in the barn to stop himself from face planting. When he managed to catch his breath he stood up and continued his bragging.
“Can you keep a secret?” Lucius asked Hermione, holding her chin in his hand. “Of course you can.” He answered his own question with a chuckle. “I have some news straight from the horse’s mouth, if you’ll pardon the expression, of course.” Hermione’s appalled face said she wouldn’t pardon the expression but Lucius didn’t seem to care. “Look Hermione, I’ve made the headlines. Mysterious Catnapper Abducts Family of Cats.” Lucius showed off the morning paper happily, and chuckled harder at his feat. “Aren’t you proud of me?” Lucius asked boastfully.
“Oh! Right-o, boys. Birds of a feather must…” Hagrid’s words were drowned out by a massive hiccup before he finished his saying. “Together.”
“Remus. Remus. Listen.” Sirius whispered to the long eared dog. Remus woke up and held out one of his ears, holding it up with a paw.
Not needing to be told twice, Harry jumped down from the window and slid across the piano, which spun poor Seamus around in a circle for a bit on his stool, in his hurry to greet his friend.
“Swimming some of the way.”
“Three?” Harry asked, confused. James came to join his brother and Harry said, “Four?” Albus joined his siblings as well and Harry incredulously asked, “Five?” His eyes had gotten rather big at this point. He hadn’t expected kids.
“Harry! Harry over here!” Draco called anxiously. Harry saw where Draco was and lifted little Scorpius up higher to get ready to toss the kitten up to him. Draco caught Scorpius.  He pulled Scorpius up quickly, onto the branch with him. But Scorpius was dripping wet and slipped for a second. Draco caught him easily and snuggled the kitten close to his body. Draco scruffed Scorpius and carried him to dry land, where Albus and James were just now arriving on their shorter legs. Draco sat Scorpius safely up against a boulder and ran to check on Harry, worried that the cat who had saved her kitten might well drown for his efforts.
“What’s going on Remus, what in tarnation you trying to do?” Sirius practically yelled at his partner.
Speaking of the bridge, Draco and his kittens were still there, but at some point a few of them had managed to tumble out of the bassinet. Draco was laying in the grass nearby when a loud clap of thunder woke him up. He lifted his head in a daze, still partially asleep, before crying out as his eyes adjusted. He was clearly not at home anymore, that much he knew for a fact.
Who knows where it’s at…”
“Keep talking mousey.” Dean replied leaning in closer.
Scorpius was watching Harry with dewy eyes, clearly crushing on the older cat. Albus was excited about Harry staying with them and learning the ways of the alley cats from a real alley cat. James was ready for that magic carpet ride, because a magic carpet ride sounded amazing. They all followed Potter over to where he had drawn the “X” excited to get their ride.
“Yes everybody wants to be a cat. Because a cat’s the only cat, who knows where it’s at. When playin’ jazz you always has a welcome mat, cuz everybody digs a swingin’ cat,” Harry and Scorpius sang together, dancing around the piano. Albus decided to take the words of the song to heart and swung on the cord of the lamp as they sang. He turned on the light as he did so and suddenly the room was full of all sorts of colors!
“I love you Draco,” Harry whispered into the blond’s ear as he readied himself to penetrate his lover.
“No, no, he sneaked up behind me and tailgated me,” Sirius grumbled.
Lucius glared at the intrusion but replied kindly, “Coming Madame, coming.” Lucius ran into the kitchen, and tossed the sack into the oven whispering, “I’ll take care of you later.” He pouted and kicked the oven door closed before running to meet Narcissa.
“No trouble at all, little prince. And when we get to Paris, I’ll show you the time of your life.” Harry replied before he jumped into the truck with them. The kittens all stared at him excitedly, wondering what they were going to do in Paris.
“I do love it when you blush. Shall we go home now?” Draco asked as he pulled away from Harry, only far enough to look into those emerald eyes.
“Bravo,” Draco applauded Harry’s performance as he spoke. “Very good, You are a great talent.”
“Yes Papa.” Albus replied before hissing and shaking his way over to the easel, still in alley cat mode.
"Damn it Draco! Will you stop with the pity party? I get it you have regrets but your life isn't over and I need you to keep going. Okay? I said it. I am the person here at Hogwarts who needs you."
“Would you be up to reading aloud to me, my love?” Harry asked, giving Draco his sweetest smile.
“Now, now my darlings. Don’t be frightened. The storm will soon pass,” Narcissa soothed as she reached to lift up their canopy and check on them. But the bed was empty! Narcissa gasped in shock as a new round of thunder shook her window panes. “Oh, no! They’re gone.” Narcissa ran out of her room in a panic shouting for her babies.
“Quick, Dad, get in here.? Albus shooed, pushing his father into the bushes.
“Me first, me first! Scorpius yells as they get close to the cat door. All three of the kittens jump through the door at the same time and get stuck side by side with an oof.
“Oh and I’m so very glad we did.” Draco answered, smiling down at the black cat and fluttering his eyelashes.
“Tut, tut Lucius. Don’t fuss over me.” Narcissa replied, keeping her parcel to herself.
The pitch is my backyard,”
“Mousey, you just struck out.” Pansy replied, flicking out one claw menacingly and moving closer to the mouse. “Any last words?”
“Well, if you’re applying for the job, well…” Harry replied excitedly.
“Draco! Kittens! Draco! Where are you? They’re gone! They’re gone!” Narcissa ran screaming through the top floor of the mansion.
"What did you mean when you said you know some people other than my friends who need me around?"
“Or a steak and kidney pie to fill my tum.
Neville and Dean attacked him, trying to dodge the club, while Blaise had a different idea. Blaise loosened a rope holding a bale of hay, and sent it careening down on top of Lucius’s head. Lucius had been trying to lift the trunk since the cats had stopped fighting him, and he was nearly knocked unconscious by the unseen impact. His eyes swam with dizziness as he tried to come to his senses. He climbed back on the trunk hoping to be safe there. Seamus and Blaise threw a saddle around him, effectively trapping Lucius’s arms to his side. Pansy ran over with a bucket of water and tossed it on the man’s head as he teetered around unbalanced. No longer able to see, Lucius turned in a circle which gave Neville the perfect spot to attach the hook from the hay bale. When it was snug under the saddle, Neville motioned at Hermione and she pulled up on the rope hard. As Lucius’s weight lifted, Harry pushed against the trunk and out Draco and the kittens jumped, followed closely by the hero himself.
“Look, baby, it’s late and the kids are bushed,” Harry said reasonably.
“I think that’s a splendid idea.” Draco said happily.
“Come now Luna. I don’t wish you to sue anyone. Though that may change based on whether or not Lucius signs his portion of the divorce papers I guess. But for now, I need your help to make my will.”
That was when Lucius opened the door and entered carrying a tray. “Oh. Good evening my little ones.” Lucius greeted them kindly. Humming his creepy rock-a-bye kitty remix to himself, Lucius stepped around the excited kittens to lay down a tray full of saucers. The kittens meowed and jumped up and down around his feet as they waited.
“Boys, it’s outrageous! Why, you won’t believe what they tried to do to your poor Uncle Hagrid.” He wailed loudly. “Look. Look at this!” Hagrid sobbed tapping the menu outside Le Petit Cafe. “Prime country goose a la Provencale. Stuffed with chestnuts? And basted in…white wine.” Hagrid finished reading the menu with a hiccup.
Solemnly up to mischief,
Scorpius whined as he walked under his father’s legs, where James had been hiding earlier. “Papa. I’m afraid. I wanna go home.”
“Oh dear. What happened to your lovely tail feathers?” George interrupted his twin when he saw pink skin where his uncle’s tail usually was.
“So he’s the catnapper.” Ron whispered, amazed.
Not wanting to miss out on the fun, George started to help fill in spots. “Draco, you’ll do nicely here.” He pointed out her spot.
“Snip, snip. Here we go.” Fred called out.
Lucius had finally managed to rid himself of the cat herd, just in time to capture the black cat inside the trunk as well. The cats had almost escaped when he shut the lid of the trunk once more. Looking around to see if anyone had been alerted by the commotion, Lucius whispered evilly.  “You are going to Timbuktu, if it’s the last thing I do!” He shouted, now standing atop the trunk as he waved a club around.
Harry managed to get another page or two of paperwork done before his phone buzzed loudly again. He hadn’t tried to put it away this time, merely tossing it to the corner of his desk. He finished the page he was on before sighing as he opened Draco’s message.
And blow a little magic into the tune.”
Sirius looked around in confusion, not sure what was going on and not completely awake yet either. He kept watching as Remus was lifted all the way to the top of the hay, looking up in time to see the sleepy dog get poured into his bed. Sirius looked at the hound, bewildered, while Remus snuggled up close to him.
Draco moaned louder at the speed and cried out Harry’s name, burying his hands in the sand as he craved something to scratch at. Harry slowed down for a minute, giving them time to readjust so that Draco was facing him again. Draco’s whimper turned into a moan as their lips pressed against each other in a passionate kiss. Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and swallowed the moan greedily and deepened the kiss as he started to pound faster into Draco once more. Draco scratched at Harry’s chest and swallowed Harry’s grunted response. Draco nipped at Harry’s bottom lip as their kiss broke and Harry whispered into the blond’s ear.
“Well yes that is a given but I am assuming you want to do something besides me on this vacation? There is a cool waterfall on the island, a nice shark cavern we could swim in… of course at any given time those activities can be stopped in order to enjoy each other. So I will ask again my love, what do you want to do today? Besides me, that’s guaranteed.” Harry winked as he finished speaking.
“You mean, you want me?” Ron asked, scared.
“No, no. Back off, boys. I’m doing fine.” Harry protested trying desperately to hold onto the vine in his mouth.
The now empty sidecar followed the motorbike in running over Sirius as poor Remus slowly spun up higher on the windmill, trying desperately to get down. As the blade turned sideways, Remus managed to get unhooked and watched as the man jumped off his own blade, umbrella back to normal, and tried to float down to get away. Remus refused to let go of their quarry so easily. He ran the length of his blade and jumped as far as his little legs could carry him. He managed to make it to the man and wrapped his front legs around the man’s knees, holding on as tightly as he could. Remus and Lucius spun as they fell and Remus slowly slid to where he was barely hanging on to the man’s feet. They fell faster due to the extra weight. Sirius saw them falling and grabbed hold of the sidecar, using it to circle underneath, hoping to catch them.
“Stop staring at me like that and shake your cute sparkly patootie all the way into the ocean,” Draco said as he tried to give Harry a stern face… which he failed miserably at mainly because well Harry looked deliciously adorable in his new swimwear. Harry nearly collapsed into a fit of giggles at Draco’s words, rather uncharacteristic of him on their own, followed by his facial expressions.
“Oh, how sweet.”
Ron finally returned home from his searching exhausted. He’d looked everywhere near their house and found no trace of Draco or his kittens. He knew Hermione would want an update, so he went to the stable first, head hung low in his hopelessness, closing the distance between himself and Hermione.
His phone buzzed once more, interrupting his internal rant about work. Harry groaned again but finished the file just a few minutes later. Currently he was still on track to be home within his ten minute time frame, so hopefully that would placate his blond. Adjusting his robes so that his erection wouldn’t show, Harry stood up and went to turn in his file, pocketing his phone and grabbing his bag.
Eventually, Draco started to fidget as his skin started to itch from the sand so he sat up, wanting to rinse off the sand. Draco sashayed back to the cavern, winked at Harry, and wiggled his bum. Harry giggled at Draco’s dancing, refusing to move until Draco stopped shaking his ass though, because the view was delicious. When Draco jumped in, that was Harry’s cue to get up and join the blond. Draco swam without a charm for a while, trying to rid his hair of sand. Once his goal was accomplished, Draco re-bubbled himself so that he could swim without fear of swallowing saltwater. Harry dunked his dark curls into the water and tried to shake the sand out of his hair for a while before he recast his bubble head charm. Draco swam laps around the cavern for a bit longer, chuckling as Harry shook his hair back and forth hoping to rid himself of the sand.
Don’t spare the tone,
“Hey! Now the squeaking has stopped,” Sirius commented, confused.
“Remus! Remus!” Sirius shouted the name this time.
A very disheveled and out of breath Lucius opened up the door and spoke between breaths. “Announcing Madame Luna Lovegood.”
“Hurry, Ron, hop aboard the motorcycle. And for goodness’ sake, do be careful.” Hermione worried as the mouse used her body as a bridge to get down from the window.
“Me, too. And my feet hurt.” James slumped as he voiced his complaints as well, lifting up one paw for emphasis.
Luna pretends not to hear Narcissa, still humming aloud as she dances alone, too lost in the moment to let it go so soon. Hearing Narcissa laugh makes her heart happy and with the way the other woman’s marriage is ending, Luna feels Narcissa could use all the laughter she could get.
Their last night in the wizard BnB was full of cuddling in bed, naked but enjoying intimacy without sex this time. Harry and Draco took turns drawing shapes on each other’s bodies, sometimes just drawing lines all the way down their sides. Both men enjoyed their last night of peace and quiet, knowing they had to go home the next day and start to get back to their normal, somewhat busy routines. They talked about their vacation and the fact that both men wanted to come back here every vacation from now on, or almost every vacation. Harry thought about them possibly packing in such a way that they could sleep near the waterfall or the cavern next time, and Draco agreed it sounded like a cool idea so long as he got to pack some comforts. Harry chuckled at that but agreed so long as it got Draco to sleep in the cavern with him.
“You’re quite welcome, young man.” Hermione answered with a chuckle.
"If you were here first, you have been here for longer than me so why don't you leave instead. I am sure your cronies are missing you."
Realizing that their target was now able to move quite fast, Remus turned to his partner and said, “Step on the gas, Sirius!”
"Ugh. Whatever scarface, take your side of the room but be quiet about it. I find your voice grating."
“Yes. Yes, let’s hurry. We’re almost home.” Draco nodded before starting to run down the sidewalk.
“Haven’t we met before?” Harry asked with a charming smile as he looked up at Draco.
“As you can see the sharks don’t seem interested in me. Will you join me, my love?” Harry asked as his emerald eyes shined with excitement.
“Certainly no one can do this better than Lucius…” Narcissa’s voice continued to echo around the room.
Their last full day of vacation greeted them with sunny skies and the smell of the ocean on the breeze.  Harry and Draco got ready quickly, wanting to spend as much time as possible at the beautiful waterfall. Draco packed some food and water for them once he got dressed and Harry had made some quick breakfast burritos for them to eat on their walk. Soon they were on their way to the waterfall, walking hand in hand as they did so. Draco skipped a little as he finished his burrito, swinging their hands lovingly. Harry chuckled at his adorable boyfriend, grateful to have the blond in his life. Harry swung his hand in time with Draco’s trying to keep up as he finished his own breakfast. Draco chuckled as Harry nearly tripped with the speed increase, and pulled the dark-haired man into his arms to keep Harry from falling. Both men relaxed into the hug while they looked around, the waterfall had to be nearby, they could hear it, and yet neither man could see it.
Harry’s phone went off yet again. He sighed and opened up the message from his husband,  assuming he  was in trouble for not being home already.
“Um, can I wait here one more minute? Maybe while you swim around more?” Draco responded, still a little nervous.
“Wigwams?” Draco parroted, confused.
“Why! Why, it’s Uncle Hagrid.”
As he sang this verse of his song, Harry gracefully got down from the tree and strutted closer to Draco. Draco was trying not to stare, so he started to groom one of his front paws slowly. Harry kept getting closer, eventually propping himself up on a boulder while watching Draco intently. Draco met the other cat’s eyes a few times but did his best to focus on his grooming.
Lucius leaned forward and grabbed his hat with his teeth, snatching it right off the relaxed dog’s head. Sirius oooh’ed once more before lying back in the side car, fast asleep, but hatless. Lucius moved back inside the hay until his head came out over the top. He smiled gleefully at the hat he now held in his hands. He kissed the hat in his joy before putting it back on his head, though there was a small pile of hay between his hair and his hat. Lucius settled back into the pile as he sent his fishing line after the next prize; the bassinet he had taken the cats away in. The hook attached on the first try and Lucius excitedly reeled in the line. Remus was sleeping so soundly that he didn’t realize his bed was moving. Sirius however, was still struggling to stay asleep, too many things had happened tonight. His eyes opened briefly, just in time to see Remus and his basket floating next to him!
“Onward and upward Lucius! Wheeeee!” Luna cried happily as she let go of his suspenders suddenly as she started to run back up the stairs once more. The suspenders snapped against Lucius’s skin with a satisfying thwack as she careened up the stairs at record speed, running into Lucius and almost running him over in the process. Lucius fell forward as his heels were stepped on and Luna had to bite back a giggle. She continued up the stairs at a more reasonable pace, giving Lucius time to recover enough to announce her to Narcissa.
“How much farther is it, Mr. Potter?” The hope in Albus’s voice made it obvious that he wanted it to be close.
“Oh thank you. Don’t mind if I do.” Ron agreed, rolling out his cracker. “Just a few dunks.” Ron said as he used the bowl James was drinking out of. He dunked his cracker a few times before eating it quickly. When he got halfway through it he stopped to express his joy. “Mm. Oooh. Very good. My compliments to the chef.” Ron mumbled between bites.
“Papa, may we watch Albus paint before we start our music lesson? Please?” Scorpius asked in his cutest voice.
Blaise picked up the bottle and looked down at the mouse hungrily as Ron kept talking. “But honest! He told me just to mention his name.”
Must explore the scene,
Lucius fell on his face when the trunk collided with Hermione’s legs, a horse standing tall and strong, was no match for a scrawny man regardless of how badly he wanted to move. Deciding to leave the trunk for the moment, Lucius set his evil sights on Potter, the black cat who had started this plan-spoiling drama. The man picked up a scythe and started waving it around crazily, trying to attack the cat, but Potter had jumped back onto the loft. As Lucius chased after him, climbing the ladder one-handed, Potter started to push against the ladder, hoping to make it fall. Harry nearly took a scythe to the face for his trouble, but as the ladder started to fall backwards, Lucius dropped it, saving poor Harry’s handsome face as they both fell with the ladder. Lucius cackled madly as they fell, not really sure what else to do. They managed to land on a pile of hay, so neither were grievously injured in the fall.
“What color are they?” Remus sassed.
“Haven’t got an extra set of eyes, have you, Lucius?” Luna chuckled at her own joke.
“Well, okay.” Harry led Draco over to the window where the kittens were watching the band perform. Draco joined them, curious about this new type of music.
When Draco’s back was turned, Harry hid a secret find under his pack, not wanting Draco to see it quite yet. Harry then told Draco to catch him and off they went on another fun game of underwater tag. They chased each other around the cavernous pool and every time they caught each other they would lose themselves inside passionate kisses and sweet embraces. They played the game of tag for quite a while before they found a naturally lit cavern, due to some algae that inhabited it. Still bubbled, they swam around the cavern, exploring all of the nooks and crannies of it, exclaiming at the fish and coral they found around them. An eel darted out at them causing Draco to squeal, and Harry laughed in response. Draco glared at his boyfriend before once again giving chase after the man he loved, keeping close to Harry the whole way back to the grotto. In unison, both men exited the pool and extinguished their bubble head charms. Still catching their breath from all the swimming and laughter, they sat shoulder to shoulder for a while.
“Come on, Draco. Come on, let’s get out of here.” Harry whispered, wanting to leave the geese behind. “Well guys, see you around.” He called out to them, “we’re on our way to Paris.”
Harry had leaned into the hug happily, starting to relax a little. His relaxation was cut short as Draco kissed his neck because it caused him to gasp and stand up straight. He knew where this would lead and he really didn’t want to start a fire in a house they were renting. It was bad enough that something had caught fire in their kitchen!
“Le Petit Cafe? Oh, that’s that famous restaurant. It’s magnificent.” Draco responded excitedly.
Draco covered his mouth with his paw to try and hide his laughing smile. He loved all of the things about Harry they had just named off, and he was trying not to let that show. But also Harry’s look of annoyance was making him chuckle.
Harry nodded in response, “Good thing you packed our waterproof wand holsters then, huh?”
“Shh. Listen,” Sirius chided, lifting one of his ears up to listen closer. “Sounds like a one-wheel…”
“All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose. And tickle your chin. Now you close your eyes. And cross your heart. Then presto! Breakfast a la carte.” Harry said with a flourish to move the tarpaulin and expose the cream canister. All three of Draco’s kittens had done every step of the spell eagerly, though Albus had briefly peeked when Harry had told them to close their eyes. All in all, a very impressive bunch of kittens, they were. The kittens opened their eyes and were happily amazed to see a giant canister of cream before their eyes. It really was like magic!
“Yeah made a mess of it huh?” Remus asked, laughing at his own joke.
“James. Now don’t be rude.” Draco chastised him gently.
The croak came again, a little bit louder, and James still called for Draco. An even louder croak answered James and he yelled in terror as he turned around and ran. “Papa!”
“Thank you.” Narcissa smiled at her cats as she dismissed them from their picture duty. “Now run along downstairs. There’s a surprise for you.”
The trumpet made a very loud noise and little Albus felt that he might faint due to lack of oxygen.
"I knew you couldn't just be quiet! I thought you were going to be quiet now. I just want to take a damn nap okay? Now shut it."
“Whoops!” Luna cried out as she missed her footing, she had lost her bearings when she turned to scoff at Lucius. And with her Spectrespecs on, everything always looked a little wobbly, making it impossible to recover her footing quickly. She started to fall backwards, and Lucius rushed to her aid.
Meowing and hissing met his ears as Ron looked up, realizing that he had been a few seconds late. Regardless, the word sack still left his lips even though his friends were already captured.
“Yes Luna,” Narcissa replied confidently. “I simply wish to have the cats inherit first. Then, at the end of their lifespan, my entire estate will revert to Lucius.” Narcissa explained.
“We can’t leave him, can we?” Fred agreed, laughing with his twin.
Remus fell off first because the man’s shoes had slipped off and those had been the only thing keeping him attached. As he fell into the sidecar, Sirius put on his fiercest glare, only to find his partner grinning from inside. Remus pointed behind them and Sirius turned around to see Lucius sinking ever closer to the ground, trying to keep his feet up as high as he could. The umbrella had a different idea though as once again the poles darted upward, thwarting Lucius’s floating efforts. As the umbrella fell back into its normal spot, as if trying to put itself away, it trapped Lucius’s face inside it and somehow the man managed to catch himself atop the rogue motorbike.
The twins stuck their heads into the water and searched frantically for the possibly drowning feline. They couldn’t see him however and both brothers returned upright to compare notes. In unison they shouted “Deeper!” before diving back all the way under the water to find this poor cat. After another minute of searching, Fred and George had found the exhausted cat.  Together they brought him to the surface. The geese swam the exhausted beginner swimmer back to shore, propping him up between them
Instead of answering, Harry leapt out of the tree. His timing was perfect and he landed on the hood of the truck. The instant his paws hit the vehicle, Harry arched his back and let out his most menacing hiss, feeling his pupils dilate and contract to add to his scare factor.
“Now then, who are the beneficiaries?” Luna asked curiously.
“Oh, of course Hermione. I almost forgot.” Narcissa held out her hand to Hermione, who gratefully ate the sugar cube present. Narcissa smiled fondly at the horse, she did love all animals, before turning to head inside.
Harry smiled at Draco, laughing along with his lover before he replied; “You know you love me.”
As he finished the final command, Lucius screamed out in pain once again as Sirius jumped and bit his bottom for the second time. Remus, not wanting to miss out on the fun, grabbed hold of the man’s belt, hoping to get closer to the tender part. However, as Lucius continued to spin around wildly, poor Remus lost his grip on the piece of fabric and flew backwards. He hit a flexible tree with a thud and the crazy speed at which he flew somehow propelled him back the way he had come. Remus barreled straight into the man’s rear end as it was up in the air, so that Lucius could bend down and try to get Sirius out of the sidecar with an umbrella. Lucius flew off the handlebars with a yell, scared that he might hurt himself when he landed. However, his umbrella opened as he flailed high in the air and managed to halt his hurtling descent slightly.
Soaked to the skin, but happy to have exited the water and successfully lost the cats, Lucius started to drive away. He looked around to see if anyone was watching, again wanting no witnesses, and smiled happily when he saw no one. He breathed a sigh of relief that was short lived, as he realised when he turned to check his sidecar. A very grumpy Sirius was inside the water flooded car with Lucius’s fancy hat on his head. Remus was sitting next to him, looking up at the other dog for further instructions. Curious, Lucius lifted up his hat so that he could see the face of the dog sitting next to him and he found a pair of glaring eyes waiting for him. Remus had sat up more and stuck out his tongue, clearly enjoying the ride.
Draco then nipped Harry’s tongue in retaliation and swallowed the sound enthusiastically as their kiss grew more passionate. The two men rolled around as they kissed, constantly in motion, desperate for as much skin-to-skin contact as they could manage. Neither of them realized that at some point they had rolled off the blanket and were making out directly on the sand. Harry’s hands started to move towards the hem of Draco’s speedo, wanting all of Draco and no longer caring about being naked on a beach with his lover. Besides, they had booked the whole island for the week anyway, might as well take full advantage of their privacy. Draco moaned loudly as Harry’s hand found his erection and he ground his hips against his lover’s instinctively. Harry slowly worked off Draco’s trunks until they reached his ankles, at which point Draco kicked them off unceremoniously, too involved in Harry to worry about where they would land. Draco’s hands then tugged on Harry’s speedo, making quick work of it, fueled by his hunger and his intense desire for the dark-haired man.
Fred was tapping his wings together in excitement, looking down at the kittens of the group. He had a fun idea about how to travel with the little ones, and couldn’t wait to line them up.
Draco stared up at the handsome cat in the tree, literally showering him with attention. He looked down at the ground nervously before looking back up and noticing that this Harry fellow had stopped shaking the tree. Now the black cat was hanging upside down on the branch, staring at Draco.
Draco hugged Harry back and purred slightly as Harry kissed him. He listened to Harry’s words and nodded thinking to himself. He had always wanted to swim with sharks but now that they were right in front of him, he was struggling with his anxiety. He definitely didn’t want to be eaten by a shark… he weighed the choices in his head, using the gear would make sure the sharks didn’t notice them, but it would make it harder for him to see Harry.
But I sip my cup of life,
“Harry, this is Fred and George Weasley.”
Or at least it should have been a sad day for everyone in the mansion. A noise caused Hermione and Ron to turn, and they noticed that one person didn't seem to share their sentiment. They watched while an immensely delighted Lucius danced with a pail in his hand and hummed merrily to himself, as he walked towards the barn. Hermione and Ron shared a look of disbelief and confusion before he entered the stable, confused at how anyone can be so happy in light of recent events.
Lucius was mid sip when the sound of kittens meowing reached his ears. He sputtered and champagne flew out of his mouth in shock at the sound.
This caused Narcissa to giggle happily, while Draco held a paw to his mouth in his embarrassment, though he laughed a little as well.
Her vision now worse than ever due to lopsided spectacles, Luna flailed about on the stairs, going in a bit of a circle as she attempted to regain her balance. Terrified of this crazy woman dying on his watch, Lucius reached his arms around her trying to steady her before she fell all the way down the stairs.
Harry chuckled and shook his head at Draco. He grabbed Draco’s suitcase and carried it the rest of the way down the stairs.
“I’m king of the castle,
Draco watched Harry swim, heart in his throat as the love of his life swam with the sharks. Draco made a face as those words played in his head, he hadn’t expected to feel that way about anyone ever, but as he watched Harry swim and show him it was safe, Draco realized the words were true. He watched nervously as Harry swam, glad he could still see the dark-haired man due to the lights. The sharks seemed a little curious about Harry but none of them opened their mouths, no teeth came out, and most of them just watched the man as he swam with them. Feeling brave, Harry reached out and touched one of the grey sharks nearest to him. The shark didn’t react at all, and Harry smiled happily. Harry swam back to the cavern’s edge, still smiling and hopeful that he had shown that the sharks were safe enough for Draco to join him.
From the basket Scorpius whispered, “How romantic.”
“Harry, your friends are really delightful. I just love them.”
Draco’s eyes widened in surprise and excitement at Harry’s words and he grabbed his husband’s hand, running after him through the Ministry. Harry technically had an office…he only used it while he was in the middle of a massive undercover operation. Otherwise he preferred to stay in the same area as his coworkers. But it meant that Harry’s office was always available for time alone…and it was guaranteed to be empty as only Harry had the key. Draco realized where they were heading and picked up his pace, somehow more excited than ever.
“Oh dear. Let’s get into the basket, all of us,” Draco said, following his kittens inside.
Back at the manor, Lucius was on the phone, holding the bag of cats as he talked. Harry had gotten to the house quickly and watched as the evil human finished his call, grinning maliciously as he hung up the phone. Harry ran from his spot on the windowsill to follow the man. He had to save his family! Lucius ran out of the door to the stable, holding the bag close to him as he did so. He slammed the door behind him before Harry could follow, so the black cat jumped into the window to await the right moment.
“George, we were born with flat feet.” Fred reminded his twin before they both dissolved into a fight of laughter.
Seamus was playing so hard his cymbal came off his drum set and he playfully smashed it onto his head. Pans and Dean danced around as they played their instruments happily in the middle of the floor. Neville shook his body as he danced before Draco, smiling at the handsome cat kindly before taking off his hat and waggling his eyebrows at Draco. Draco smiled at Neville before going back to swaying to the music, allowing his floofy tail to tap in time with the beat.
“This sure beats running, Sirius,” Remus said as he settled back into the sidecar and put his hind legs up, getting comfortable.
“How about we start dipping our toes in the water without any magical help and see how the sharks react? If they don’t do anything too drastic we can just bubble our heads and dive in?” Draco decided nervously.
Unfortunately for Harry, being caught off guard like that made him hard almost immediately. He was in the middle of finishing up some last minute paperwork on a case that had literally finished around the time he was supposed to head home. Thankfully Harry was sitting at his desk and didn’t have to stand up…yet. Harry fought back a groan as he tried to maneuver his robes away from his erection. Unable to focus now though, Harry pulled his phone back out, and sent a slightly angry text to his husband.
“Why, Mr. Potter, you could have lost your life.”
“Yes, yes, I’m on my way.” Ron shouted as he flew off the oven door, propelled by Draco’s loud voice.
Lucius quickly grabbed his hat back as it had tried to run away again and no sooner had the hat touched his head, than Remus and Sirius fell into the man’s lap. They had been kicked out of the car and were just now landing from their own momentum. Lucius saw them land and scooted backward quickly into the hay, not wanting to be caught by these vicious dogs again. Both dogs fell to the ground confused and annoyed, circling the area trying to understand what was messing with them.
Narcissa danced with Draco in one arm and her feather boa in the other, but soon her boa leaves her hand as Luna gets closer to her. Luna presses up against Narcissa’s body, taking her empty hand in hers and wrapping her other arm behind Narcissa’s waist. Draco is happily sandwiched between the two women, enjoying the sound of Madame’s laughter.
Unable to resist the fun music, Albus plopped himself, paws still covered in paint, atop the keyboard as James returned to the bench. James made a face but kept playing even though Albus was getting paint on him and the piano keys. As they played their scales song again, Draco and Scorpius sang the words together. The final few lines were sung by the whole family and the piano part ended with both Albus and James using all four paws to play. They jumped back and forth and only stopped when they bumped into each other headfirst, landing on their bottoms on the keys.
Draco shook his head and sighed at that. “I most definitely do, plus life would be so boring without you my love.” Laughter overtook Draco at Harry’s feigned anguish at his words.
Madam Rosmerta had her hair tied back behind her face to keep it out of her way while she drove. She hated these back country roads, but she was getting paid well for this delivery, so she figured it was worth it. Her truck hit every bump along the way however, making it harder for her to see when her hair was loose. She hummed to herself as she drove, trying to stay focused on the income this job would give her. She needed help keeping her tavern afloat in the current climate, and this would give her enough to replenish her alcohol supply. Her day was about to get far worse though, since it was her truck that contained Potter’s magic carpet. The one Harry had promised the kittens earlier, and he was about to make good on his promise.
“Yes, yes. It was the night of your grand premiere that we met again. Remember?” Luna recalled fondly.
“Scorpius’s the caboose! All aboard!” Albus called out not seeing the glare Scorpius shot him at being the caboose.
Pans eventually settled back onto the bed, comfortable lying on the pillows and playing, but she stopped when she heard someone else on the piano. Little James was playing with all four paws, fast and expertly, while looking around at the band, proud of himself. Seamus joined him at the piano, wands in paws, and used them to hit the keys on the piano. While he did he muttered his favorite spell, though it never seemed to work.
“Draco. Beautiful. Love it. And those eyes. Ooooh. Why, your eyes are like diamonds sparkling so bright. They make the morning radiant and light,” Harry responded, turning on his charm.
"Contrary to your belief, you don't actually own this room, Malfoy."
“Mm. Mmmm. Oooo. Ooo!” Sirius groaned happily before giving out instructions. “A little lower and faster there.”
“Well…Uh, you see, I’m not exactly his husband.”
“Here I am, Papa,” came a sad response from Scorpius.
Lucius sped out of the city, unaware that a mouse had just fallen from his motorcycle. He only had one thing on his mind, retrieving his belongings so that he could be the perfect criminal. Lucius parked a little bit away from the farm this time, hoping against hope that his walking would be quiet enough to not wake the vicious mutts who lived here. Fishing pole in hand, he took off his hat to leave it with his bike, and started to tiptoe around the farm, looking for his possessions.
“This is outrageous. It’s crazy.” Pans Cat cried out laughing. The band joined in the laughter as Ron ran into a bottle, hoping to be safe there.
Harry purred at the need in his lover’s voice, enjoying the effect he was having on the blond man. Harry broke their kiss, and started to pepper Draco’s neck and chest with kisses, adding in gentle nips sporadically. Draco moaned louder and thrust his hips into Harry’s body as the messy haired man continued kissing and nipping his way down Draco’s needy body. Draco’s hands fisted into Harry’s dark hair and tugged at the ends, wanting to give Harry some attention in return. Harry moaned at the sensation of Draco tugging on his hair, enjoying it immensely. Harry kept moving down Draco’s body, taking his time and enjoying every inch of skin he came into contact with. When he reached the hem of Draco’s swimsuit, Harry moved his hands to grasp Draco’s hips, working his thumbs into the joints there, massaging them expertly.
James stuck his tongue out at Scorpius wordlessly, but Draco still saw.
“Oh, no, we’ve got to hurry. The baggage truck will be here any moment now.” Lucius mused as he started to push the trunk to the exit.
“You know, Luna, if Lucius had only known about the will, I’m sure he never would have left.” Narcissa mused as she focused the lens of the camera. Once the lens was set, Narcissa pulled away to do some last minute preening, Draco had already been trying to straighten out Scorpius’s bow collar, and Narcissa had her eyes on Harry.
“Now, uh, you stand here, dear.” He instructed Scorpius, pointing at the spot right in front of him. “And, uh, let’s see. You take this position.” Fred said, picking up James and moving him in front of Scorpius. Both kittens were watching him excitedly.
“So good to see you, Luna.”
“Of course, Madame, right away,” Lucius said as he smiled knowingly. The cats were indeed tuckered out, as she put it, but not because of Luna’s visit. Lucius grabbed a travel bassinet and put the kittens inside in order to carry them all up the stairs at the same time. He put them in their bed next to their father, and discreetly tucked the small bassinet in behind their large bed. He bid them a sickeningly sweet good night, and bowed to Narcissa on his way out the door. Lucius busied himself with cleaning the mansion for a few hours before he felt enough time had gone by. Stopping his charade abruptly, Lucius ran to his room, put on his travel hat and cloak and set his least favorite shoes by the front door. He thought better of wearing them upstairs since they squeaked loudly with every step. Quietly, Lucius climbed the grand staircase and waited, barely breathing, to see if Madame was indeed asleep. He stood outside her door for over ten minutes, waiting to hear a sound, but none came.
Ron glared up at the cat and grabbed his hat from the giant paw above him. “Don’t worry about me. Potter needs help. Draco and the kittens are in trouble!” Ron cried.
Remus was giggling in his sleep for some reason, but neither dog woke up. Sirius stretched out and briefly moved his legs from his hat, before settling back in as Lucius tried to take it. Refusing to give up, Lucius went back to rubbing Sirius’s belly.
“Now, now Scorpius.”
“Perhaps a magic carpet built for two?” Draco guessed.
“Hello Ron!” Replied Scorpius and Albus said, “Hello Ron!”
“Everybody out of here, fast!” Harry ordered, grabbing little Scorpius by the scruff before leaping out of the trunk.
“Your husband is very charming, and very handsome.” George told Draco.
Wherever I go it’s a road I know,
Albus’s eyes got really big as he remembered. “I was having a funny dream. Lucius was in it.” Albus wiped his face after his dad stopped grooming him before continuing. “And we were all riding and bouncing along…” The frog-erumpent croaked again, causing Albus to stop talking and listen. “Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn’t a dream. Lucius did this to us.”
“You’re doing splendidly. George complimented the flailing cat.
“Well, it’s your turn love, come and join me. The slide is epic and the water feels great!” Harry smiled up at the blond.
"Sod off, Potter. Stop talking about my friends like that. Unless you want me to start in on yours. I know how much you love hearing my opinion of them."
“Oh, no.” Harry sighed to himself.
“Oh thank goodness. Oh, are you all right?” Draco asked his third son as he returned to their basket. He started to groom the ginger kitten as he awaited a response.
“Sirius, I’m plumb goose-pimply scared.” Remus whimpered as he walked in a circle, turning his back towards Sirius hoping to keep himself safe from a random attack.
Ron ran over to the trunk as Harry started to push out against the pitchfork. Ron hung down from his tail and inspected the lock for a minute before trying to pick it. As Ron started to turn the dial, Harry managed to kick the pitchfork off of him and it made a loud boing sound before shooting through the air. Ron was struggling to hear the tumblers over the cacophony of yeowling, hissing and growling that filled the stable. Annoyed and grumpy, Ron shouted over the din, “QUIET!”
“Yes, yes of course, but you know what to do.” Narcissa said as she turned back towards the camera.
A goose was screaming loudly and a man shouted “Sacre bleu!”  The exclamation was followed by the sounds of pans being thrown.  The commotion escalated into,  “Oh, he bit my finger! Get out! Go! Go, get out. Scram!”, yelled by the frustrated cook who then tossed a very disheveled looking goose outside the back door.
“Oh no!” Draco cried out in horror.
“And are we really gonna ride on it?” a dreamy Scorpius added.
“Siblings never fight fair.” Albus's voice from above. Then the candle he was on wobbled and fell out of it’s holder, Albus managed to stay on the table but the candle wasn’t so lucky. It fell off and managed to land right on top of Scorpius’s head.
“Wait a minute. I’m the leader. I’ll say when it’s the end.” Sirius reminded Remus as he puffed out his chest and stood tall. Out of nowhere, words appeared in the air like magic and smacked him on the side of his thick head. Sirius grunted and conceded, “It’s the end.”
“Draco my love, why couldn’t you wait for me at home?”
The gang of alley cats stared wide-eyed and horrified at the news before taking off down the alley.
"Oh shut up, you git! I didn't ask you for your opinion of me so just get to your side of the room quietly or get out."
“But…But Madame’s…Well, she’s just another human. You’re just her house pets,” Harry argued.
They dried off in silence after that, and changed into their boxers for bed. Harry and Draco spent some time unpacking their suitcases now that they weren’t as desperate to screw each other senseless. Though the idea was always in the back of both mens’ minds, something about the other just always drew them in. Harry had brought some board games he was looking forward to finally playing, and Draco had packed some books hoping to have some time to read. Granted if they spent the entire week lost in each other that wouldn’t be so bad either. Draco got into bed with a book in his hand and Harry gave him a gentle peck on the lips before heading into the kitchen. This was part of their routine, Draco read before bed and Harry made them both some chamomile tea to help them sleep. Draco sometimes read books to Harry when he came back to bed, but sometimes Harry would read his own book. Other times he just laid on the bed, lost in daydreams of things he wanted to do with Draco still.
I changed up O'Malley's (Harry's) name song to make it more Harry Potter-y so I hope you enjoy! Also a big shout out to moondraconis for being kind enough to beta this chapter fur me!
“Very well. Scratch one husbutler.” Luna did so with a flourish of her quill.
“Aristocats do not practice biting and clawing and things like that. That’s just horrible.” Draco answered stunned.
“Now, I am Fred Weasley and this is my brother…”
“Yeah, yeah, I hear ‘em.” Sirius stopped walking to lift up his ear and focus.
“The police said it was a professional, masterful job.” Lucius continued gloating about his crime, puffing himself up with pride. He hadn’t realized that Hermione was looking at him the way she would look at a soiled stall.  He was too full of himself to pay attention. “The work of a genius. Not bad, eh, Hermione old girl?” Lucius declared happily and he brought the now rolled up newspaper down onto Hermione’s rump.
I have my very own map,
“Trouble?” Harry asked curiously. “Helping handsome lords in distress is my specialty,” Harry laid down on his side as he spoke. “Now what’s the hang-up, your lordship?”
They ate a delicious dinner in comfortable silence, not chatting much at all, just enjoying each other’s company. Once dinner was over, they cleaned up the kitchen before going to their bedroom to snuggle and watch a ridiculously fluffy romantic comedy until they were ready to go to bed. They fell asleep not long after the movie had ended, snuggling up close to each other as they drifted off to sleep.
Sirius, a long and lanky brown dog with a black nose and ears, was sleeping under a wheelbarrow outside on the farm. One of his floppy ears lifted up at a sound in the distance. He was a guard dog after all, so all new, unfamiliar noises needed to be investigated and approved by him. As the sound got closer, he wearily opened one eye, then both, lifting  his head as the engine popped loudly again. Sirius attempted to stretch and sit up, but forgot where he was sleeping and hit his head and back on the bottom of the wheelbarrow. He glared up at the wood, annoyed, and shook his head with a grunt. He padded over to a pile of hay to wake up his partner in crime and investigation, knowing that the other dog preferred to sleep in warm places.
With the basket now in his possession, Lucius turned his attention to his umbrella. As he was able to reach it from where he hid, Lucius just started to pull on the top of his umbrella, but suddenly he heard a honking sound. It turned out that his umbrella had been hung up on the horn of the sidecar. Sirius leaned over to investigate what was happening with his new toy, sticking his head inside the open umbrella. Lucius kept pulling on the umbrella and the horn honked loudly as the umbrella finally broke free.
“Lay some skin on me, Pans Cat.” Harry said, stretching out a paw. Pansy gave him a high-paw with a chuckle as the rest of the gang joined in the conversation. A mixture of silly inside jokes and “Welcome home, Potter” greets Harry as he looks around the room.
“Oh, no. Not at all,” Draco reassured the black cat, thinking that his heart might explode from such sweet words. “Any man would like it. I…I mean. Even little Scorpius,” Draco said, trying to remain calm.
Hermione glared at the blond man’s retreating figure.  She wished she’d given him a swift kick in the behind for all the trouble and sadness he had caused. She hoped that Draco and his kittens would be okay…and she sincerely hoped that awful man would get caught. From his place in the feed sack Ron popped his head back out and spat out some seeds.
“Yes, right off your cuff,” Draco reminded him.
“That was amazing.” Harry said, trying to stand, and waving his wand to clean up both themselves and the room.
“Oh, they won’t find a clue to implicate me. Not one single clue.” Lucius told Hermione as he wagged his finger to and fro while picking up the feed sack. “Why, I’ll eat my hat if they…My hat! My umbrella! Oh, oh gracious.” Lucius said, waving his hands wildly enough that he dropped the sack he had been holding during his panic. “I’ve got to get those things back tonight!” Lucius exclaimed, running out of the stable frantically.
