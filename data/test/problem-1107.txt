Draco didn’t know who looked the most shocked as Harry’s eyes widen in surprise, while he himself was unable to process what he had just said, out loud, to Harry.
“Have you gone nuts!? Why would you come to his shop if you know he works here?” Weasley accused, looking between Potter and Draco like he was certain someone would interrupt and call it all out as a big joke on his behalf and they could all (expect Draco) laugh about it and drink away any memories of it ever happening. “He’s bloody Malfoy for Merlin’s sake! Shouldn’t you be a bit more cautious around the git?”
Pansy rolled her eyes, clearly not amused by Draco’s unimpressed tone. “Everyone who shops there, of course!” She said, matter-of-factly. “If they see me outside of the store wearing something atrocious, then they’d never trust my sense of fashion, dear.”
After a bit more bickering, the potion was finally ready having turned into a orange paste.
“Hmm…” Draco hummed back, unsure of why the two of them would be having a discussion about Granger of all people.
“I don’t know… I guess…”
“As if! I barely tolerate him now!” Draco defended; a bit caught off guard by Luna’s sudden comment. How much had she been picking up on while he had no idea?
“Then… You’re staying here?” Harry asked.
It wasn’t a good retort, but in Draco’s defense, he hadn’t expected to be mocked by Pansy while in Potter’s presence.
“Look, you obviously like the guy. Hell, I haven’t ever seen you this worked up about anyone before. I mean, I was a bit surprised at the fact that you were gay and all, but it makes sense considering you’ve never had much interest in girls before” Pansy said, not being the type to hold back what she thought.
After a moment of silence Granger looked between Draco and Potter with a stern look. “Now, just until I can make some sense of this, please do try to be civil with one another. We’re still not certain as to what this spell does to you, and it might affect you in the long run if you fight it too much.”
“Although I suppose any place in the wizarding world would be difficult to navigate through when everyone knows who you are. That one I can kinda understand better than most, I suppose. Though we aren’t exactly known for similar reasons.” If Draco hadn’t been so caught up on the potion, he would’ve spoken with more care, instead of blatantly putting forth bad memories of a past that would never be forgotten.
“I-“ Draco could hardly breathe properly at this point.
“…Yes” Harry felt a bit surprised at how determined his answer sounded as he spoke.
“I can’t believe it! You actually-“ Ginny roared out in laughter, while Luna tried to calm her down and shush her from saying too much that would give away Draco’s real feelings towards the quidditch team. Hermione just gave Draco a weird, but appreciative look, and Harry smiled fondly at him, which ultimately made it all worth it.
“You don’t have to strain yourself.” Now Harry’s voice just held amusement as he spoke. “You know,” he said as he leaned in and bit Draco’s ear, licking at it, and earning himself a strained moan. “I would love to watch you come all over yourself.”
Each minute felt like hours as Draco was sitting in his office making phone calls and doing live meetings.
Thank you all for reading this story, hope you liked it.
“Did you have a good time though?”
Draco could hear the amusement mixing with a tiny bit of worry in Harry’s voice. For all he knew, it might actually look like he was in pain as Harry barely put his thumb inside of him.
a girlfriend! Where’s yours, Malfoy?”
He slid his hands down Draco’s legs and slowly spread them apart, making Draco shiver. He felt too exposed, but at the same time it felt safe. Like knowing that Harry would be careful, that he wouldn’t rush.
“Yeah, I know. I just… I like the work there. It’s usually much more fun, today was just shitty as hell.” Pansy sighed. “Maybe you can convince Potter to come work part time too?” She looked at him with a cheeky smile.
“You know… I’ve been in relationships before, but I’ve never felt like this. Not even going all the way, and I still feel more content by this than anything else. I had no idea you could be this sexy” Harry said, keeping the serious tone throughout it all.
What had happened? Draco thought to himself. Why had he been so bothered by seeing Harry half naked? They were both guys so it really shouldn’t have mattered, right?
Draco noticed the look in his eyes and felt heat slowly rise to his cheeks at the feeling of having become so important to the man in front of him that he would look this down from not being able to properly meet for a week or so.
“Just be charming enough, and that might actually work.” Blaise chuckled, avoiding the glare Draco sent his way.
Pansy only laughed wickedly at that, patting him on the shoulder. “You won’t get rid of me that easily. Who will mock you about your crush on the chosen one if I’m not around anymore? We can’t have that.”
“So… What did you guys think?” Harry asked with hopeful eyes.
It was strange. People were smiling and saying good morning to him left and right. All the younger students looked awe-struck whenever they passed by him. It was a feeling he had completely forgotten existed.
“I see that being the Head Auror still hasn’t helped ease that stupidity of yours.” Draco felt himself snicker with more confidence that he should have. “As far as I can remember I used to be part of that little fan group.”
“I’m afraid I won’t recover from it, if you can’t get it up because of me” Draco said, knowing the new wave of heat to his face wouldn’t make much of a difference on how he was already looking.
“What’s wrong with you lately, mate? It feels like your personality is all wrong.” Weasley sighed loudly, and Draco realised he had to say something in order to dim the suspicion that had started to brew in Weasley’s mind.
It was a nice feeling, no doubt, but it also somehow made Draco nervous. He was afraid Harry was pushing himself too much. He hated the thought of making Harry uncomfortable because of having to consider his feelings.
Harry held tightly on to Draco’s hips as he started sliding his cock between his thighs.
“Oh this?” Potter pointed to his head, and just as he did the hair changed into a dark purple.
He was a coward… He had always been one. Unable to ever express what he truly felt and fearing rejection more than anything. Yet he had chosen to do something so drastic and stupid. He had probably deserved the surprised look on Harry’s face, and the stuttering of words that left his mouth after.
“Exactly! Count your blessings that you’ve actually found someone you can honestly say you like”
Draco turned around, with some difficulties in the way too small bathtub (in Draco’s opinion). Sure, Harry had told him they could change it, but Draco had refused it. He had become rather fond of their times sitting so closely together in the small bathtub.
“I’ll make sure to be more careful next time.” Granger said.
“Mhm…” Draco said back, curious.
It was the second time within minutes that Draco had been stunned into silence by Potter’s lack of understanding when it came to personal space. Draco regarded Potter for a minute as thoughts went through his head. This wasn’t the first time Harry had shown complete disregard towards keeping a distance and he had on multiple occasions touched Draco’s arms or legs like when he sat down on the couch besides Draco and without hesitation lifted his legs up so he could sit down before placing them in his lap instead of asking Draco to move.
“Not only that, but in order to create a better unity between you all, each dorm room will be shared between two people from different houses.” As McGonagall said this, hushed groans could be heard. “You will not be given a curfew as I expect you are all grown up enough to be held accountable for your own actions. There will be a head of house though, which will help if any issues arise.” Everyone went silent again as McGonagall’s strict voice quieted the disagreement uttered by some of the students.
Draco laughed, he really thought himself to be lucky to have managed to befriend both the siblings of this bakery. They were both so similar, yet so different in personality.
“Oh, come on. Why not? If anything, the two of you know more about each other than anyone else. Rumours during school was all about how obsessed you two were with each other, you know. I remember actually getting jealous over you back then.” Ginny said, leaning back and absentmindedly placing her arm around Luna’s chair. Much had changed since their time at Hogwarts.
“Can I talk to you in private?” Draco was adamant about not having the Weasel know about what was going on. He would probably poison Potter’s mind into humiliating him in any way possible now that he had complete control of his body. Frankly, Draco had more to lose as most of the wizarding world would turn a blind eye to it had he tried to disgrace Potter’s reputation.
“You can move.” Draco gasped, after a minute of adjusting himself to being completely filled up.
“I guess. I suppose this is one of the few shops I can enter without having to deal with nosy people. I’m glad it’s here.” Draco could feel a moment of hesitation before the next sentence was said. “Don’t get me wrong, Malfoy. It’s not a negative trait or anything, but I never considered you to be…” Potter seemed to consider his words a bit before uttering. “as chatty as you are.”
“It’s… I feel fine now.” Draco said unable to hide his confusion himself. “I only feel a small hint of something uncomfortable in my chest, but nothing compared to what just happened.”
one who didn’t know about this?”
“You’re quite the saviour, huh?” Draco said as he handed Harry one of the glasses.
“They are absolute shite!” Draco exclaimed loudly.
“I’m not a sore loser!” Weasley tried arguing but ended up sighing. “Next time I’ll win for sure.”
“Yes… I remembered you telling me about it, so I thought it would be a good addition… I kinda panicked and just threw in a lot of things…” Draco said a bit embarrassed.
“So, a pretentious fool it is then.” Draco huffed.
Draco didn’t look up from the book he was reading as he heard Potter rummage through the kitchen cabinets. A few minutes passed by before Draco sighed and put the book down. The aching was still present despite the less harrowing affect it had on them. Draco found it difficult to concentrate much when he was constantly reminded of it, so he decided to join Potter in the kitchen instead.
“Well, I may have put a tracer on you, which alerted me if you were in serious danger. Glad I did it though, to be honest.”
“What was the original purpose of it?” She had stopped twirling it around and was now focused on Draco.
“Don’t worry, I’m sure he’ll be thrilled with whatever you give him. Just find something you think he’ll like, and I’m sure he’ll love it”.
“What? There’s no romance! Stop it!” Draco said as Pansy raised an eyebrow in disagreement. “You had a bet with him too?!”
“That’s… good.” Draco was fumbling a bit more than he wanted to admit, but it felt strange to seriously talk to one another without the snarky comments or jokes. “But it’s me we’re talking about. You’re not worried I’d sell you out the minute I got the chance?” He tried pulling it off as a bad joke, but Draco knew that saying something like this only aided in adding more suspicion to his name, which didn’t bode well with his former Death Eater status. However, he couldn’t help but want to know what Potter was thinking.
“You’ve been acting weird lately. All sneaky and tense.” Potter said, shifting his position at the bed so that he was facing Draco. “I started paying more attention after I saw you steal ingredients from potion class.” Draco tried to keep his emotions under control and not let Potter see just how shaken he was from the fact that Potter knew about it. This could mean serious trouble.
I also wanted to include a bit more interaction with the other two in the golden trio as well.
“It’s nothing, really. I should leave.”
As Harry continued stroking his hole, smearing the lube he had summoned evenly across it and then slightly dipping into it, Draco was biting his lower lip, his face scrunched up as he tried controlling his breathing.
The time passed as the spoke about their time at Hogwarts and about all the different creatures that Draco couldn’t tell whether were real or not. But Luna seemed convinced about it, so Draco just tried to follow along with it.
“So, Potter. I’m sure you didn’t come all the way here only to admire my…elegance. How can we help you today?”
Draco opened his eyes to find Harry looking at him. Somehow they had just silently agreed on continuing to share the bed in Harry’s room. It was a big bed, alright? And frankly, Draco knew he barely slept when he was by himself. Having been able to sleep for whole nights when in Harry’s bed, gave him motivation to be selfish enough to blatantly ignore a talk about bed sharing and just tuck himself in without a word.
“Hey! What exactly did I do this time?” If it wasn’t for the fact that Draco was pissed off, he would’ve almost found it amusing that Potter was so accustomed to getting into trouble that he added ‘this time’ to the end of it. However, the fact that it was indeed Potter’s fault, made him furious.
They got ready for bed, and once they got in, Harry turned off the light.
Harry started gaining a steady pace as he leaned down and kissed Draco’s neck. Draco moaned louder as he tangled his hands into the messy black hair. Harry’s movements got faster and harder.
(See the end of the chapter for
The potion book had said to only inhale it right before going to bed. Draco gathered his stuff and went to the bathroom to get himself ready for sleep.
“Well, it’s only natural for these people to loathe me. They have all the right to do so. I can handle a few comments here and there, it’s fine.” Draco made sure to keep himself composed as he spoke.
Draco just looked at him. He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. His mother hadn’t once mentioned anything about Harry and her exchanging letters.
If Potter had been famous before the war, it was nothing compared to his popularity now. All eyes would probably be on him throughout the year and mistakes would be easily spotted. Draco supposed it reminded him slightly of his own situation growing up at the manor. However, the risk of punishment seemed non-existent when it came to Potter. The guy had always been exceptionally good at getting into trouble and never seemed too bothered about it.
2.	He’s got quite some defined muscles which did make me a bit flustered, but that’s just jealousy.
“This is it. All or nothing.” Hermione said with a nervous grin as she poured the potion into a vial. Draco nodded as he felt a surge of anticipation run through him.
Harry only chuckled as Draco was squeezing his arm to the point where he wasn’t sure whether he had any feeling left in it.
“Yes…” Draco muttered in confirmation, pulling him in tighter.
“What?” The sudden turn took Draco by surprise.
Amelia was sure that if Harry had been in a relationship at this time, the girl would’ve been filled with jealousy over the way Draco was treated.
“That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve help, Malfoy. Although you did some bad things because you were forced and in order to save your family, you still did things that helped us win as well.”
A sudden hint of panic hit Draco as he came to the realisation that the two of them would have a head on collision if Potter continued what he was doing. Draco knew he had reacted too late and wouldn’t manage to get out of Potter’s way in time. He clutched his broom firmly, as he waited for the impact.
“That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be allowed to redeem yourself. You did choose right in the end, after all, Malfoy, even if it meant endangering your own family.”
“No…” Draco whispered feeling his chest clench tight. He did not want to share a room with Potter. No way. He’d take the danger of Macmillan over Potter any day.
and your team.” The point seemed to come across as Harry smiled reassuringly.
“Okay.” Pansy lifted an eyebrow urging him to continue.
“It does indeed.” Draco muttered, needing a moment to gather some strength. By Salazar he would need it, considering he was now dealing with his school nemesis that he hadn’t seen for the last 7 years. However, he was fairly certain Potter wasn’t in the possession of a wand at the exact moment, considering Draco had interrupted his bath time or so it seemed, so the chances of having any curses or hexes thrown his way was rather small. Draco had just managed to get a glimpse of his own wand laying on the bathroom floor. He must’ve accidentally losts it during the confusion when he fell into the bathtub.
“I can’t help but feel a vague Deja-vu of sorts.” Said Harry, chuckling lowly. “Only last time this happened we were bickering about getting away from one another.” Draco huffed back, kissing Harry’s neck softly as he spoke.
“You ready?” Potter said, lifting his wand slightly.
Draco was having a hard time keeping up with him. He hadn’t ever been touched like this before, and he was afraid he was feeling it too much. He didn’t know what was normal or how he should behave.
“Y-yeah, okay…”
And that was how Draco had been put in this highly uncomfortable situation where he had to tend to the front desk and try to look as warm and welcoming as possible. It had been easier said than done, as the customers who had entered the store had either awkwardly paid for supplies without any eye contact or they had just as awkwardly tried to exit the shop inconspicuously. The only saving grace had been the last witch who had seemed slightly uncomfortable for a while, before most likely taking pity on him and giving him a smile back and actually talking to him more than a simple “thank you.”
“Wow!” Weasley looked amazed as he took in the sight of his arm, fully healed with no red mark or anything left from the burn.
“I’m quite surprised we got to play against each other once more this quickly.” Harry said as he was leisurely sitting on his broom, seemingly more interested in the conversation than the snitch.
Draco gave a small smile as he shook her hand. “Friends.” He said, which made Luna’s smile widen as she at once found it appropriate to dive into how wrackspurts were floating around his head and what he could do in order to get rid of them.
“Yeah, same here.” Potter lightly stroked his chest as he spoke.
“It’s… well I guess it’s pretty nice” Draco said, thinking he preferred Harry’s warm and cosy flat over this place. There were too many memories of him feeling lonely and sad for him to properly enjoy the richness of it.
“I’ll manage…” Draco scoffed, feeling a little disheartened.
There were a few that he knew would take deep offense at sharing a room with him, and a couple that he knew would probably make life a living hell for him. Finnigan might not be the worst as he wouldn’t intentionally try to kill him, Draco thought. However, his ability to blow things up could definitely end with him inflicting something horrible upon Draco. Macmillan was also someone Draco couldn’t help but fear share a room with. He had not cared to try and hide his resentment towards Draco from the moment they stepped off the train and he knew Finch-Fletchley felt the same. Weasley would also be a nightmare to room with.
“I totally forgot you two were coming over today, or else I would’ve…” Potter started, but was interrupted by the Weasley girl. “Or you would’ve what?” She looked at him in disbelief. “Tell us not to come, because you’re having a breakfast date? With MALFOY??” Her voice was filled with accusation and perhaps quite a bit of denial.
It was strange how different it had felt this time around. He wasn’t shocked like he had been the first time, and he got to properly feel the kiss.
A bit more coercing, and Draco agreed to go if Pansy came along with him.
This truly felt like a Christmas celebration.
“H-Huh…?” Draco couldn’t help it. Granger was firing shots after shots, and he could barely keep up with her at this point.
“Sure enough, but you haven’t done anything as far as anyone else knows, and it’s not like I’m interested in having you sent to Azkaban when I spent so much time and energy on keeping you out of that place.”
“No, a bit more-“ Once again, Draco could barely breathe out the words as Harry hit the spot. “Yes!” He gasped.
“It’s been quite a while since I’ve seen you. How are you?” Pansy walked up to Potter with no hesitation, a welcoming smile gracing her lips.
“You’re already dying from the first transfiguration paper; I’m not really seeing how you’re going to be of much help.” Draco sighed, but put down his transfiguration paper in order to help Pansy anyway. He was already done with his potion paper and he knew Pansy wouldn’t stop whining until she got hers done.
“Can I start moving?” Draco shivered at the roughness in Harry’s voice, and just nodded in response, not feeling like his voice would hold if he tried to speak.
“Why were you at the bakery today? I thought it wouldn’t be open on New Year”
“Firstly, rude. Secondly, when I asked her why she thought that, she told me you had confirmed it.”
“Er… Perhaps we should wait it out a couple of days together? Just to be sure that it’s properly working?” Potter said, looking unsure as to whether Draco would agree to it or not.
“Surely, you must be joking Potter.” Draco frowned in disbelief as he tried to discern the look on Potter’s face. Was he just mocking Draco for his feelings or was he actually being genuine? Draco didn’t trust himself to know which it was.
The time it took to brew the potion felt unusually long, as Draco tried his best to avoid any conversation with Potter, and Potter in return, seemed to busy himself with looking through all the various nooks and crannies that were available in the brewing room.
“Are you serious? I… Oh… “ Draco didn’t know what to say. He had completely forgotten about presents, and frankly, he hadn’t expected that he would get any.
He wasn’t able to focus on work at all, and it was probably the first time he had been making this many mistakes.
“I’m so grateful.” Potter grinned at that, and Draco was glad he was currently sitting on the stool in front of the cauldron at that moment. It almost irritated him how much the guy was able to affect him just by doing daily, ordinary things like smile.
“Because you’re the only one who haven’t been around him long enough to see anything other than…” Potter hesitated for a moment, thinking before adding. “this particular side of him.”
“You ready?” Pansy was biting her lip as she looked at him with worried eyes. They were standing outside room 435 and Draco felt himself clench the vial in his pocket as he nodded slightly before tapping the door and opening it carefully.
The next day Draco was still considering heading home straight after work, but before he could make good on that promise to himself, his phone beeped.
The next couple of days were a hassle for Draco. He first had to deal with Weasley’s excessive gloating that, although he had predicted it, he hadn’t fully comprehended just how long Weasley could keep it going.
“Why not? If we’re both gonna live here, then you should have a say in things as well.” Then Harry turned a bit sheepish as he continued. “I’m also aware of the fact that you have good taste when it comes to… well… everything I guess.”
“You’re wild, Malfoy.” Draco was, if not even more so, intently focusing on Harry’s lips as they were now slightly swollen and cherry red from the intense kissing session.
It felt like eternity, where Draco was focusing on his breath while Harry slowly pushed his finger in and out of him.
He had a basic potion for feeling nauseous and combined it with another potion that would enhance the effect as well as add in some pain relief and general well-being. It was something Draco had concocted before for another customer who was having the same issue as Granger where nothing had helped during her pregnancy.
“Why, thank you! Finally, someone with a bit of sense.” She huffed. “Although don’t be fooled. While Draco normally wears work clothes in the shop that looks quite regular, he looks absolutely stunning when he put his mind to it.”
“Really?” Draco lifted an eyebrow slightly.
‘Well, Harry has always considered you good-looking’, Draco shook his head slightly as the thought continued to force its way to the front of his mind. Why the hell would Potter think that? When did Potter tell Granger that? Did Granger just lie to him so that he would go and embarrass himself?
“I… I didn’t want to force you…” Draco said trying to keep back his tears.
Draco wondered if he had just imagined it all. The lady was out the door before he could gather himself, and he let out a breath he wasn’t aware he had been holding.
“Oh, most definitely. Ron is more upset about Harry not telling him about it at once than the actual situation itself. I’m sure he’ll come around once the shock of it all starts to ebb off.” Hermione seemed more or less used to the weird antics of the two boys and just patiently waited it out.
‘Great!’ Draco thought as Potter walked towards him.
Potter chuckled at that before grabbing onto Draco’s hand and looking him dead in the eyes with a reassuring look. “Give me some time to think, alright?”
Harry gripped his hand tightly and leaned in to kiss him, while they both came hard. Draco felt his back arch up as he came, while feeling the hot mess inside of him.
Draco felt too exposed as he walked down the corridor to the great hall. Breakfast was almost over, which meant students were starting to slowly pour out of the hall, heading towards their classes or dorm rooms.
“Merlin… I’m amazed they managed to pass the writing tests for the Auror department.” Draco said jokingly.
“You think I’m a horrible cook?!”
“I think Hannah and I have managed to make a potion that’ll work!”
He came to a halt, not really sure why he didn’t just continue walking. He probably should’ve, but it was too late now.
“It’s fine. It’s a weird situation after all, so I guess I would’ve wanted to know it all as well, had it been me.” Draco shrugged. He wasn’t about to start a fight over it, and he had also felt a tinge of relief at the fact that Weasley had jumped into action the moment Potter was heckled. He knew Weasley was doing it mostly for Potter, but it felt nice to watch himself be defended by someone other than Pansy and Blaise.
“Yep! He might be one of the best duellers out there, but even he needs saving occasionally, ya know.” Weasley looked more than proud of having saved the saviour for once.
“Same here.”
“I just want Harry to be happy is all. Even if that means Gryffindor losing one match, I don’t mind.” Hermione shrugged, with a small smile forming on her lips.
Harry started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt and disposed of it on the floor before leaning down and planting a few light kisses on Draco’s neck. Subconsciously Draco felt himself baring his neck more, allowing Harry more space to plant kisses. He did so all the way up to his ear, before he took the earlobe into his mouth and bit down lightly on it.
This time around they were joined by Pansy, and Draco was glad that Potter decided to chat rather than work on the Patronus while she was there. He could barely handle being alone with Potter during the lessons. There was no way he would be able to handle having Pansy intently watching them, leering at him and concocting some evil master plan. She would probably come up with some unbelievable scheme where she insisted that a kiss from Potter would be the best way to get the spell working, and how she had read all about it in some extremely credited book with a strange, obnoxiously long Latin name. Draco actually wouldn’t put it beneath her to try something insane like that.
The guy seemed decent enough and quite young, which meant he probably had less connection to the war and therefore seemed unbothered by being expedited by a Malfoy.
“What the bloody hell is going on?!”
“Yeah… All I can say is that it gets easier. People will start to tire sooner or later, and you’ll just start to notice it less too.”
When Harry took the vial and lifted it, Draco followed. Both only sharing a quick glance before downing the potion.
“I did try at first, but you were completely out. I figured I should just let you sleep then. Merlin knows you probably needed it.”
“Sorry for not being here at that time. I was sadly ill at home.” Pansy actually looked truly disheartened, which probably stemmed from the lack of seeing Draco’s flustered side and the image of him hiding behind the counter like an idiot.
“Ginny?! What the hell?! Why am I the
As they closed the door to the room, Draco sat down, out of habit, in his own bed. Pansy walked over to him briskly, and Draco was almost certain she was about to attack him before she stopped and leaned in. Inches from his face she scrutinized him for a moment.
“Then stop being so distracted for Merlin’s sake! One more mess up and I’ll be personally escorting you there.”
“You said you worked as a CEO, huh? Must be a lot of work” Harry said as they were sitting in Harry’s living room. Draco had been working extra hours, and when texting Harry that he wouldn’t make it in time before the bakery closed, Harry had told him to come once he was done and he would make him some dinner.
“You weren’t kidding about the taste.”
“Yes…” Draco agreed before he let his eyes close, and his mind drift off.
“Me too!” Harry gasped, before both of them came simultaneously.
“Yeah… I don’t think we have” Draco laughed a bit at the absurdity of it all.
Pansy had arranged the tea and was chatting away happily with Potter, both situated at the vintage couch, sipping their tea. It allowed Draco to work fairly peacefully without having Potter’s stare boring into his back every time he made a movement.
“What?” Weasley seemed to snap out of it and furrowed his brows in confusion.
“Cough” Draco quickly opened his eyes as he heard Harry coughing.
“Why not?!”
Harry sat back down besides Draco and started chatting away about what had happened during the two weeks they hadn’t met. It mostly revolved around work and the many people that was ordering from the bakery from various different towns.
“You’re insufferable.” Draco sighed at his own demise who was currently chuckling.
“You tell anyone, I’ll hex you into oblivion, Potter.” Draco huffed out, hiding his face under his arm.
“Hold on. Is Parkinson your girlfriend? Oh of
“Expecto Patronum!” He felt a small surge go from his arm and out into his wand, before it disappeared again.
Potter had stopped by a late evening once, looking a bit worried as the lights were still on in the shop. Draco must’ve looked tired there he sat, scribbling down notes on the scattered papers in front of him.
He let go of Draco’s shirt and sighed as he walked over to Granger. “What did you find?” Potter asked, seemingly unaware of Granger’s mild panic. “Oh! Well, it can wait if you guys were in the middle of something.” Granger started backing out of the room as she spoke.
Draco sighed in relief.
As he looked down, he groaned loudly. Potter’s closeness had had some unfortunate effect on another part of Draco as well. “Bastard.” Draco mumbled into his hands as he rubbed his face tiredly, hoping Potter hadn’t noticed his embarrassment.
At first, Draco was allowing Harry full control. Harry roamed his mouth trying to reach every nook and cranny he could get to.
Harry had made several obvious gestures as to wanting Draco to sleep in his room, and Draco was just happy he didn’t have to try and come up with reasons as to why it would be better for him to stay with Harry at night as well.
“But I’m not gay…” Draco mumbled mindlessly to himself.
Potter was standing there, in a warm green sweater and black pants, a small smile on his face. However, despite him being dazzling as usual, the thing that convinced Draco he was looking at an angel was the white hair that seemed to glimmer in the sunlight seeping in through the windows.
Harry just laughed and pulled him in for a kiss instead of giving another reply.
“I’m not ill.”
Harry slowly pulled out and rolled over next to Draco.
The feeling was incredible. Draco could hear himself moan loudly as he felt the pleasure wash over him. He had never experienced anything like this before.
“Here” The guy walked over with a plate of pie in each hand. He put it down on the small table in front of the couch.
“Why, thank you.” Potter laughed, touching his hair mindlessly.
Draco took a bite of the cake, and he really couldn’t believe something could even taste this good. Beside the quiet atmosphere, the pastries at this place was insane Draco thought to himself. He had tasted a big variety of pastries before and most of them being from high class restaurants or bakeries, yet, somehow, they couldn’t compete with the few pastries he had tried out at this bakery.
“No, I mean that normally I would hate to be in a situation like this with anyone, even those close to me.” Draco yelped as Potter slightly lifted him to better position himself on the couch, with Draco on top of him. “But somehow I don’t really mind when it comes to you.”
“Well, I guess until the storm clears a bit…” Draco said, unable to resist the good offer in front of him.
‘Things can actually change, huh?’ Draco thought to himself as he sipped on his fire whisky. He had never imagined in a million years that he would actually be able to consider both Hermione and Ron as friends. However, the most farfetched of them all was him ending up with Harry Potter of all people.
“She could’ve told me about the fact that the manor was safe, it would’ve avoided this whole ordeal from happening.” Draco said in a frustrated voice.
Draco felt more content than he had in years. Finally, it felt like he had found someone who he could easily hold both light and deep conversations with. He wasn’t feeling that gloomy anymore as he made his way back home to his villa. Being able to look forward to the days where he could go and hang out at the bakery made it so much easier to deal with his usually stressful work hours.
The next couple of weeks they had spent all their free time together, being together with their friends or just hanging out at Harry’s flat.
“I’m nothing like you though. It’s just regular clothes.”
It took a moment as they both lingered in the feelings that had just shot through the both of them. They were panting heavily as Harry slid out of him and lied down next to him.
“Oh God, Draco…You’re so good.” Harry breathed as he pushed inside with more force. Draco felt the sensation of Harry hitting a spot inside of him which made him arch his back and moan loudly.
“About what?”
“Luckily for my own pride, I know how unbelievable oblivious you can be at times, so I figured I’d ask to check whether or not you’re even aware of it, which I see was a good thing to do, all things considered.”
“What?! Seriously? That’s awesome!” Pansy shrieked, grinning from ear to ear, seemingly having forgotten about her own shitty day for the moment. “Can you show me?”
“I would never!” Draco said, flushing.
Draco leaned back, closing his eyes. His book had been abandoned along the way and now he just felt drained and in need of some sleep. Yet, he could not force away the thoughts that had started occupying his mind from the previous conversation.
Draco thought bitterly, annoyed at himself for not having realised the teasing in Potter’s voice soon enough.
Both of them were panting heavily, and when Harry looked down at Draco’s lips, he could see that they had turned a deep red and was a bit swollen.
Harry eventually took his fingers out, earning himself a small whimper from the loss of contact.
“You gave us time… it was enough to allow us to escape.” Potter’s voice was soft and quiet, soothing.
“And you seem like you’re taking a vacation, Potter.”
“but now, you gotta admit” Ginny moved her hand vaguely in Potter’s direction. “he’s become fine as hell.”
“Sure, sure… Whatever helps you sleep at night. I mean, I wouldn’t judge you though.” Draco frowned at Pansy’s nonchalant voice. “You’re describing how he was during school, but now he’s nothing like what he was back then. If you weren’t aiming for him, who knows, I might’ve been inclined to have a go at him myself.”
Draco looked around the room for a second before heading towards the office desk situated at the far end of the room. Although Potter had visited his office on multiple occasions, Draco had never been in Potter’s office before, mostly because there had never been a reason to. This morning he had received a note asking if he could bring him the device when he had time to do so, as Potter was busy working hard on a case.
“I’ve told you I want to pay for them” Draco said back, having had this argument before.
“I’m sorry, I wasn’t aware of what I was doing. I know it’s a shitty thing to do when I’m still trying to figure everything out.”
“Come in.” The familiar greeting was heard as Draco knocked on the doors. He took a breath before opening the doors.
“Harry doesn’t like you! I’m sure he has a bloody good reason to come here instead of another potion store.” Weasley said, then turned to Potter who still hadn’t made any comments on the current direction the conversation was headed in. “You don’t like him, right? Tell him!”
“He was, but Hermione told me they gave him some medication to make him rest.”
“Yeah, I wouldn’t have done it either if I didn’t have to” Draco said back, suddenly wondering if he might’ve sounded rude by saying it like that, so he quickly made a follow-up “but since I have work, it’s nice to have something to look forward to before heading home”. Oh great… Now it just seemed like he was a sad, lonely guy taking refuge in the warmth of the tiny bakery.
“Even then.” Harry chuckled, smiling warmly at Draco. It was too wonderful of a smile, Draco thought.
“Wait,” Draco perched his head up slightly, trying to look at Potter, but gave up when the closeness of their faces was too much to handle. “You just used non-verbal magic, without your wand, didn’t you?”
“That means the both of you.”
“Her name… What was it?” Blaise squinted his eyes as he tried to remember the new teachers’ introductions the day before. “Professor Evergreen!” Pansy finally said after a minute of thinking.
“Once you’re back at Hogwarts you’ll be sorted into rooms before the opening ceremony. Try not to be late as house points will still be given or taken depending on your behaviour, you all will as a united house, have the opportunity to win the end of year reward as well.”
“After dinner that is!” Hermione said as she came walking down the stairs looking much more put together. Ron had also waltzed in once he heard dinner with a newly diaper changed Hugo on his arm.
Draco could thank his specialised skills for landing him a job in the department that focused on fixing Auror gear and equipment’s as well as creating and testing new versions that could help better secure the Auror’s when they went on dangerous missions. It wasn’t always easy to concentrate on the new development part though, since Auror’s would come in daily with sheepish looks on their faces as they brought forth one damaged equipment after another.
Harry had been more than surprised when Draco had told him he would prefer Harry’s flat rather than his villa.
“Arms up” Harry said as he placed the apron around Draco’s waist. He leaned forward and entwined the strings around his back and then to the front tying it neatly.
“This is on you!” Draco felt livid, as he had for the first time in his life been described as clumsy by none other than that damn Potter. How dare he? A Malfoy could be many things, but clumsy?! Not a freaking chance!
The sky lit up instantly. It was difficult to say whether the cheers of the people or the sounds of the fireworks was the loudest, but the colours painting the night sky was the only thing that Draco could focus on.
“That was…”
Before he could think, a small and almost inaudible laugh escaped Draco’s mouth and Weasley was looking flabbergasted as he tried to make sense of what exactly what happening.
“You’re just being mean.”
“Yes, although if you haven’t made it before, I’d recommend having someone who has already brewed it supervising to make sure it’s made correctly.” Draco gave a strained polite smile to the customer in front of him, hoping he would come across as somewhat decent.
“Heh! Didn’t see that coming, did you?” Draco snickered, glad to have Potter at least half-heartedly backing him up even to his best friend.
“I-… Of course you make sense, but I just don’t think I-.“  “You don’t think you deserve it?” Draco felt himself stop midsentence as he realised how vulnerable he was currently being. What Potter just said was something he had never intended to tell anyone.
Thank you all for having followed this story to the end! :)
“Draco” Draco said back as he shook his hand.
“Yeah, I’m with you on that one” Hermione said yawning.
“The hell are you talking about?”
“You look beautiful.” Draco wanted to laugh at Harry’s words, but his voice was caught when he saw the look in Harry’s eyes.
“What? You’re not into him? Or are you just saying it’s impossible because you’re not gay?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The room was dimly lit and only housing one large bed. A door leading to the bathroom was the only other door there besides the one leading out into the halls.
“Wow! I’m the best wing-woman there is!” She congratulated herself in awe.
“That…” Draco sat down slowly. Sure, Draco knew what he was there for, but it seemed more difficult to find the right words than he had originally thought. “Potter stopped by my lab.”
“No…” Ginny sighed. “He’s not someone we can trust fully, and therefore we won’t know for sure if he’ll alert them. That could prompt them to go into deeper hiding and we’ll have to wait forever to catch them. We’ll also loose the advantage of them not knowing we’re out to get them.”
“About us making a plan to catch the Death Eaters and you staying here until we’re sure they’re in Azkaban.” Harry clarified.
“Oh, yes! Many just want him for the fame though. I can’t imagine how hard it must be to deal with that every single day. Makes it difficult to know who’s genuinely in love with him.”
“Absolutely not!” Draco groaned, not moving his hands away from his face, despite Harry trying to pry them away.
“Prat.” Potter scoffed, but Draco noticed a faint smile on his lips. “But you know that’s not what I meant.” The sudden switch from banter to seriousness in Potter’s voice made Draco tense a bit. He realised Potter now had to experience his everyday life. It wasn’t a very pleasant one, Draco would know.
“You gotta be kidding me, mate!”
When Draco only gave a short nod in return, Granger seemed to gather herself a bit more as she continued. “Please sit.” She gestured to one of the chairs in front of her desk. “Can I help you?”
“Fine… But if you still feel nothing after a couple of months, you need to let me know. I don’t want you to force yourself into something you don’t want”
He was just about to reach into the small basket that separated several vials that was stored in a range of colours.
Even if it was only a tiny chance of Harry liking him back, he couldn’t let it slip by him without even trying.
Draco was just about to make a comment about how his priorities were slightly off, when Potter turned towards him. “Just gotta get one of these.”
“You sneaked up on me and made me hurriedly snatch the ingredient. I must’ve taken the wrong one!” Draco fumed.
“You’re scared? For what? You’re a brilliant dueller, they won’t stand a chance against you and your team.” Draco said, feeling a bit more worried after knowing the great Harry Potter was feeling scared as well.
“You don’t have to fight my battles for me, you know.” Draco said, not wanting to use Harry’s name to gain any favours.
“Okay, that’s a relief. I definitely thought you hated me.” Potter slightly relaxed, and Draco just looked at him with an incredulously look on his face.
“I’m fine…It felt good” Draco mumbled, feeling tiredness creep up on him.
Amelia looked at him as he was arranging some of the pastries. He’s not even aware of what he’s actually saying, is he? She thought.
“That’s good.” Relief went through Draco as he could see Potter visibly relax more as the pain was easing away.
“That’s… I-It’s enough.” Draco breathed out, surprised at how quickly got so damn hard again.
“That’s great!” The happiness in Harry’s voice surprised Draco. Sure, they were finally together, and he knew how Harry felt about him. However, he hadn’t thought Harry would be that excited about them committing freely to living together so soon.
“Remember to stir it twice clock-wise and four times counter clock-wise.” Professor Shrew said loudly as he strolled around the classroom examining the potions.
“So… What are you going to give him for Christmas?”
“Thank you as always!” Amelia smiled “I can’t believe you have such a refined taste for things like this. If only I was the same” She sighed.
He gazed at Potter who were noticeably not looking at the shelf. Instead he was scanning Draco’s face for God knows what, and Draco felt his stomach turn at the thought of being caught red handed. The vial he had snatched wasn’t part of any of the ingredients, and frankly Draco couldn’t know for sure whether or not Potter had paid enough attention to notice that.
However, there was one thing that stood out.  There were random photos… professional photos… of Draco Malfoy on some of the walls.
Let us hear your thoughts!
"I mean yeah, if you can prove that’s what’s happened, then they can prosecute wrongful termination and wages but you have to be able to prove it and most of the time they’re very careful not to leave evidence.  There’s no way to force people to be decent to each other, unfortunately.”  Draco sighed and went to the small well stocked sidebar and poured two fingers of Firewhisky into two tumblers.  A third he fixed as a vodka cranberry and levitated the whiskeys to Harry and Ron while Hermione gratefully accepted the vodka cranberry.  Draco got himself a bottle of water and sat at his desk after taking a single shot of whisky.
"Nothing on me is short, Malfoy," Harry called back over his shoulder as he walked out the door.
“Dragon Heart? That’s that new club downtown. Have you ever been there?” Ron asked as he spied the logo for the popular club on the top of the paper in Harry's hands.
Harry felt his cheeks heat.  He looked down, hoping his hair would hide his embarrassment.
“Boys!  Breakfast!”  Narcissa’s shrill voice rang out just then.  Draco groaned in frustration.
Kreacher nodded again, bowed to Harry, then led Snape up the stairs.
"Hmm, you naughty Slytherin," Harry murmured, turning them so Draco was on his back with Harry leaning over him. "I might. But then again, I might just on principle." He leaned down to kiss Draco again, shifting so that he fit between the blonde's legs.
She cleared her throat. "That's why I wanted to see you two. I'm moving you from Draco's place to Grimmauld. It is already hidden. Kreacher is there and has been informed of my decision. He's preparing rooms for you, and for Severus if you allow him access to those books."
If people understood muggles better, then it’d be much harder to look down on them.  After all, the muggles had to work much harder to achieve some of the same things that were easy for the wizarding world.  Which meant, they were twice as industrious as most wizards.  Hardly something to look down on.  And so.  The plan was launched, enacted and had netted great success.  Much more so than the three of them had ever planned for but Blaise was excellent at thinking on his feet and had really stepped up to lead them to where they now stood.  Draco had no idea how the man kept everything straight but he did.  Draco kept the books, and inventory, Blaise handled everything else.  Pansy handled her fashion business and dressed Blaise and him whenever they were going to be in front of the press.
“Just auror training.” The redhead shrugged. “Kingsley was wondering if you were gonna come back? He doesn’t care if you're bent. You certainly aren't’ the first in the auror corp.”
"Everything alright in there, Draco?" He called. "Need some help?"
The Gentlemen's club had been changed to the Alphabet Mafia after Pansy had suggested they team up and take in all of the various letters of the lgbtq.  Draco and Blaise had initially shot it down, wanting to play it safe but after running the numbers, it was a brilliant investment.
"Yes, you should," Harry said quickly, trying to ignore how fucking fantastic Draco's mouth felt on him.
“Learn what exactly?  I know quite a lot of things Potter.  To which are you referring?”  Draco intoned hiding his smile behind a smirk.
"For fuck sake, Potter," the blond said, nuzzling into Harry's neck. "She's got a thing for Lovegood and wants your advice."
“Yes sir.  I expect we’d better get on to the secure location then.”  Draco said looking at Harry for approval since it was technically his house.
Closing his eyes briefly, Harry prayed he wouldn't come too quickly. He then lined himself up and carefully pushed into his lover until he was buried to the hilt. He had to take a few breaths so he didn't lose his shit right then.
"Yes, it's hard, but I'm coping," Harry said with a soft smile. "It's been a strange couple of days, way out of my normal routine, but I do my best to adapt and deal with it the best I can. Today has been one of the best days I've had in a long time and I've come to realize a few things about myself I never knew before." He paused, letting go of Draco's hands, and took a deep breath.
“Harry!”  He cried as he came, which sent the brunette right over with Draco.  He cried out and locked his arms around Draco's back, letting all inhibitions go as He rode out his release.
"Thanks," Harry said and moved to the cushy couch near the corner of the room.
“Come on, we better head to the lunchroom or the lines will be murder.”  Draco stated smirking at the other man.  “I’ll be sure to walk ahead so you can appreciate the view.”  He tossed casually over his shoulder.  He headed for the door as the two old women snickered in the corner.
The wait wasn’t too long, thankfully, and the three showed their invitations.  The bouncer handed them back and motioned for them to go in.  They took in their surroundings, commenting on how lavish and well done everything was.
“Blimey.” Ron chuckled as they took their place in line.  “I’ve never seen the Broomsticks with this many people waiting to get in.  Whoever owns it is gonna make a fortune.”
“That sounds great.  I don't usually drink, it tends to bloat me.  So as long as I don’t have any shoots the next couple days, I can definitely imbibe a little firewhisky.  I love the way it burns.”  Draco murmured as he tucked himself away and smoothed his shirt and vest back into his trousers.
"You're gorgeous," Harry breathed.
"Oh. Yeah," Harry said, then looked at Snape. "Of course you can come to Grimmauld to read those books."
“Nah, mum said 20 minutes.”  Draco shrugged, shuffling from one foot to another.  Now that he was standing here, he had no idea what he wanted to say or do.
Thank you for reading!
We don't own these characters. They belong to JKR.
"Come in," Harry answered and Draco entered the room.
“Are you seeing this?”  Harry asked his friends.
Pansy had really outdone herself.  This suit, though mostly of muggle styling really showed off his long lean arms, and long sleek frame.  He worked out, but not enough to bulk up to any degree.  Only enough to stay trim, and maintain the hint of a six pack.  He fixed the long metallic silver tie and smoothed the front of the jacket and buttoned the silver buttons that each bore the Black family crest.  He’d rejected his father’s name immediately upon the end of the war.  With the defeat of the dark lord, his father had lost a lot of esteem in his eyes.  Before that in fact.  He’d turned his back on all of his fathers teachings.  Instead he had enlisted Blaise and Pansy to help him see for himself how wrong their parents were about their ideals.
“Well Potter I am the epitome of discretion when I want to be.  First of all, there was my asshole father and his bullshit expectations to deal with, second there was Voldermort to deal with.  No I'm not afraid to say it anymore.  I’m not afraid anymore.  Back then, he’d have turned me into a plaything for fenrir grayback so fast there’d have been nothing left.  Pansy and I pretended to have a relationship with each other, only to stay safe.  My father carried out marital contract negotiations with Astoria Greengrass’s parents in order to keep us all out of the darklords sights for his twisted entertainment in the evenings.”  Draco sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face and then shook his head much like Harry had, clearing away the ghosts of the past.
No sense in hiding. He'd already been caught so Harry decided to keep the game going. He licked his lips then gently bit his bottom lip with just the edges of his teeth.
He leaned over Draco's back, never faltering in his rhythm, and pressed open mouthed kisses along the blonde man's spine. He was close.
“Thank you Mr. Potter.  I am in your debt.”  Snape said in his dry familiar tone.  He turned to his former protege.  “Mr. Malfoy, you look well.  I hear you are working with Patty Piston here at the ministry.  I’m glad to see that you found your way into the dignified and invaluable world of potions.”  Snape nodded.  “Though I doubt that old bat can teach you anything.  She wasn’t bad in her hey-day as it were.”  He shrugged and turned towards the fire.  “I'm most happy to advise you in such matters should the need arise.”  He said not looking at anyone but clasping his hands behind his back and falling silent.
“I am as shocked as you are by that fact Mr. Potter.  I can assure you I simply woke up as though from a deep sleep in my bed at my home.  I seem to have changed into some sort of fairy creature though I do not understand how that is possible.  Nevertheless It remains true.”  Snape stated as he allowed them to see him without the glamour spell he’d been using to appear normal.   He stood revealed before them, with long silky black hair, lavender skin and his eyes were now lavender as well.  He now appeared to have a set of wings, dark purple like everything else.  He still looked like himself, only much more himself.  He was handsome.  Draco thought as he stood in utter shock.  His father had once mentioned something to him when he was a small child about fairies and elves and other such creatures.  Draco couldn’t remember what it was though.  Severous let them stare at him for a few moments before he put the glamor back in place to get them to refocus.
Both men were still sleeping when, with a loud bang, the door opened. Ginny walked right in and plopped down on the edge of the bed next to Harry. She shook his arm.
“Severus!  I thought that was you!”  Narcissa cried staring open mouthed at him.  “I’m relieved to see you returned to us, in some fashion.”  She added reaching towards him but letting her hand drop without actually touching him.  “I can’t tell you how grateful I am that you always did your best to keep Draco from harm.”  She added with her eyes downcast.  Snape simply nodded.  He had only done what any decent person would and felt the praise unnecessary.
"We already exchanged greetings mum.  Why don't you sit and talk with Harry?  Let me treat you both."  He added disappearing back into the kitchen.  Narcissa nodded and sat at the table across from Harry.
“What kind of problem dear?  Whatever straggler this is after Harry, and it’s a short list to be honest, I’m confident that you and Harry together can best any of the possibilities.”  She stated in a comforting manner.
Kreacher had definitely done what Hermione asked him to. The place was spotless.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know I do," he breathed. "Tell me."  Draco smiled to himself knowing he’d won.
“I’m sorry to say so but that is definitely the real deal and not just a fake.   We need to figure out who it was and how they found you.  Harry, do you have wards against the death eaters in your house?  We should probably alert your flatmate as well.  She may want to go home to the burrow for a bit.  That place is like a fortress rumor has it.”  Draco mussed staying on the floor and looking into Harry’s eyes.  He told himself it was to keep his friend calm and didn’t think beyond that.  His brain was trying to figure out who the death eater was.
“If I have my way, we will.”  Harry smirked as he cleaned himself up and righted his clothes.  “You know, I think we have waited way too long to go out.  Won’t you come on a date with me?  I could cook for you and make a fire and we’d have some firewhisky or maybe some wine…”
We don't own these characters. JK Rowling does :)
“Yes that’s correct.  The other potions assistant doesn’t have the necessary skill unfortunately.  However, there is a substantial increase not just in salary but in the amount of paperwork and budgeting that is required.  You’re expected to try and attract new potions accounts, track down ingredients supplies and maintain the current potions accounts.  The ministry relies heavily on those potions.  If this goes well, we may be able to assign another student assistant to help.”  Hermione explained the details clearly and concisely as Draco had come to expect.  He nodded and sipped the tea that Hermione had given him before Harry had burst in.
Draco was on his back, hair mussed all over the place, breathing deeply in sleep. The blankets were pulled back to his knees which showed a pale but toned chest and stomach that ended at the waistband of light blue, very tented boxers.
“Not leaving so soon are you?”  Draco asked, his eyes sparkling with laughter.  “You know you’ve thought about it at least once or twice.”  He teased further.  “All the girls at Hogwarts did.”  He laughed.
Harry's eyes widened then he glanced at the blond. Remembering how he was in private, Harry wasn't so surprised. He really was a good man.
“Harry…”  Draco breathed softly as his eyes fluttered open.  He ran a hand down along the brunette’s cheek and smiled, his eye’s sparkling.  He felt a strong sensation in the pit of his stomach.  Almost as though there was a line connecting him and Harry.  He blinked.  “Harry, do you see that?”  He asked softly.
“Like hell!” Ron shouted right back.  However before he could do anything, two more members of the team grabbed him from behind and held him so he couldn’t get away.  Ron was a decent sized bloke, but he was no match for the brutes holding him.
“I think you’re the one who has a wish for something Potter.  Here it is hours later and you're still thinking about my cock?”  Draco murmured softly and seductively into his ear.  Do you want to know what I was dreaming about?”  He whispered in a husky tone.
Harry, feeling Draco's warm breath against his throat, tried to stifle a shiver.
Some of the other patrons realized there was a fight going on and they gathered around to watch. The words ‘Potter’ and ‘Weasley’ and ‘Harpies’ could be picked out of the excited chatter going on.
“Fuck, Draco...yes…” Harry moaned, his voice breathy and low.
Thank you to Drarry Black and bookworm92 for their prereading and beta skills!
“Damn, Draco.” He mumbled. “You’re so sexy!  I’m impressed.  This is gonna be fucking fun.”
Harry studied his reflection in the mirror. His hair, messy as always, needed a trim. It was a shaggy mess that hung to his chin but he really wasn’t concerned with that. He’d just run his hand through it like he always did. He bit his full  lips to get some color in them. Turning from side to side, he looked at his naked torso.
“I don’t have much of an appetite at this time. If you don’t mind, I would like to get straight to researching my situation.”  Snape said dropping the glamor and rolling his shoulders as though he wasn’t used to the peculiar sensation of the wings.
"Good morning Harry dear.  I do hope you slept well after your ordeal."  She said as she offered Harry a cup of coffee or tea.  Draco came into the room then and kissed his mother on the cheek.
“Bloody hell Malfoy!  Kick his arse!  Ruddy Homophobes.”  Ron yelled out as he spat some blood onto the floor.  Draco dropped the fourth bloke onto the floor with his comrades and the other two held up their hands in surrender, ceasing their struggling with the bouncers restraining them.  Draco smiled.  No magic necessary.
Blaise and Pansy had regrets of their own.  Draco knew that Pansy had felt especially bad about trying to hand Harry  over to the dark lord and had sent him a whole new wardrobe with a note apologizing for her panic and subsequent actions.  He hadn’t heard how it had been received but he guessed well as the striking brunette had been seen wearing the outfits on numerous occasions.
“Oh we have guests today, eh? Are things that boring upstairs?”  The old woman barked as she headed for her coffee pot.

“Bloody Hell Potter, why didn’t we do this before now?”  The blonde sighed happily fulfilled for the moment.  “If I’d know that it was going to be this good, I’d have propositioned you instead of Diggory.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"You know I love you like a sister," Harry said, "but why the hell did you feel the need to barge in here?"
“Nah. You?” Harry shrugged, still rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
Draco gave off the air of being wealthy in public, but his home proved different. Were things that bad for him after the war? Harry could only wonder.
“Seeing what?”  Ron asked, frowning.
“You don’t... what do you mean you don’t intend to do anything about it?” She spluttered nearly choking on her tea. She set the cup down and stood, hands on her hips.
"Severus and I had some business to attend to but now that it's finished, he wanted to ask Harry a question," Hermione answered.
"Er… who are you going on about?" He asked, confused. She was making no sense.
Thank y'all for reading! See ya next time!
“Fine. Better than actually.” Draco shrugged wary of the change in subjects.
“Seriously?  You really don’t care?  I tell you that I really, really like Harry and you don’t see the problem here?” Draco cried in surprise and continued to ramble.  “What about everyone else?  I”m sure other people care.  What if it’s not just a crush?  Because I already love having him around so much that I never want him to leave.  I want to do things.  Mum, this is definitely a problem.”  Draco finished butchering the poor potatoes as his mother fought the urge to laugh at her son’s discomfort.
Heat exploded in Harry’s gut as Draco opened his mouth to receive his questing tongue.  Yes!  This was what he’d been needing and wanting for so long.  He tried to be gentle, to savor the moment, but he just couldn’t.  He held the blond’s face in his hands and kissed and explored every inch of that hot, sweet mouth.
“Don’t worry dear, these old houses are all laid out the same.  Your aunt Bella’s house was similar to this one.  Actually they lived over in the next block with the large estates.”  Narcissa shrugged and moved about the kitchen.  It seemed to Draco that she wasn’t wrong as she seemed to find everything she needed.
“Mum, how can you not see that this is a big deal?  People already don’t trust me because of this stupid dark mark and my behavior in the past.  Not to mention my father would shit a literal brick if he knew.  People think it’s improper.  I don’t want to damage our reputation any further.  We won’t survive falling any further from grace.”  Draco started running his hands over his face.
We don't own these characters. JK Rowling does.
(See the end of the chapter for
The four men continued to take turns hitting and kicking Harry, all the while spitting insults and slurs at him.  Ron continued to struggle against the two holding him but to no avail, so he did the next best thing: he started calling for help.
Harry sucked and licked, letting Draco take what he needed. He brought a finger up to his mouth, getting it nice and wet, then reached down to stroke Draco's hole.
"You wish," he stated in a low voice then entered the lift.
“Of course.  The child should not have had to suffer undeservedly.  He’s quite intelectual your son.”  The somber man stated and turned towards the stairs.  “Mr. Potter, might you have Kreacher bring the books to my room?”  He asked looking up the stairs towards the second floor landing.
A rich laugh bubbled out of Draco as he entered the lift and pressed the button for the 3rd floor.  He then turned and pressed Harry into the corner of the lift and put his face within centimeters of Harry’s.
“You did darling but we both know that I never listen.  For your own good, you’ll thank me later.”  Pansy shrugged and Draco rolled his eyes.
"Wake up," she grumbled. "How can you be sleeping at a time like this?"
“Merlin Harry, could you be more perfect?  I’ve always dreamed of you like this, gagging for it.  Look at you.  Look how ready for my huge cock you are.”  Draco murmured as he toyed with the plug, he pulled it out and then pushed it back in a few times, fucking Harry with it and watching the reactions.  He loved how expressive the brunette was being to his every touch.  Draco pulled the plug out and after pulling a tube of lube out of the same desk drawer where he kept his wand, he lubed up and slid home.
It had been an instant hit.  Draco went off and focused on the modeling.  Taking stock of the types of clothes each wanted shown off and animating his face and body to portray whatever emotion and mood would sell it for them.  This was old hand for him.
“You mean you liked me even back then?”  Harry asked. He slipped himself out of Draco’s behind and whispered a cleaning  spell.   The brunette lay down and pulled his partner into his arms.
“If you’ll excuse me, I need the loo,” Hermione said, then walked off.
"Harry! How did last night go?" She asked cheerfully.
“Bloody Hell.”  He said with feeling.  Pansy chewed her lip nervously.  “Excuse me.”  Draco said as he gestured to two of the bouncers already moving towards the fight.  The two bouncers grabbed the two beaters  and another came to grapple with the two holding Ron.  Draco focused and took off his jacket handing it to Pansy.  Then he leapt into the fray putting himself between the two blokes and Harry.  The leader focused on Draco swinging at him.
We don't own these characters. JKR does.
“Sweet! I’ll tell Hermione, she’s been dying to check that place out! She’s the one who granted their permits. It’s all on the up and up she says. Wouldn’t tell me who owns the place though.” Ron shrugged.
Pansy turned to grin at Ron, Hermione, and Blaise. “See, what did I tell you? Those two are the next big power couple in the wizarding world.”
“Bet Christmas at their house this year is going to be fun.” Draco laughed to himself. He strode over to the fireplace with a cup of earl gray ready for Pansy in his hand.
Harry chuckled sleepily at Draco's choice of words while Ginny looked dumbfounded by Draco's reply.
He looked to Hermione for her thoughts on the situation.
“Of course.”  Harry whispered, tilting his head for easier access.  “Although, I didn’t know I was gonna hit the fucking jackpot. Now be still.”  Draco smirked and kept silent as one of his fantasy’s ’s came true.
"Merlin! Yes!" Draco cried, keeping pace with Harry, who couldn't control his groans and cries of intense pleasure.
“Oh I see, just because I’m pretty, I’m automatically the bottom?”  Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed. “Do you have any idea how much of a stereotype that is?  Please." Draco scoffed.
Harry, who had jumped awake when the door banged open, blearily regarded the red head while groping for his glasses on the nightstand. "What the hell, Gin? Don't you knock?"
“I am a ponce who makes his living based on his good looks.  Of course I know how to defend myself.  I’m a black belt.  Now this kind of attitude is exactly what caused your chaser to get herself benched.  You should think long and hard about that.  How far did this sort of bigotry get Voldemort?   Not bloody far did it?  You’re no better than him spewing that shit.  Now get out of here and if I ever see your faces in here again I won’t just knock your friends out if you provoke me.”  Draco sneered as the aurors under the guise of cops escorted the troublemakers out.  Blaise was there in a flash picking Ron up from the floor.
Hermione took a breath then regarded Draco."I talked to your mother today and she's moving with you. At this point, I fear for her safety as well."
“One other thing you should know, mother, I brought Harry here.”  Draco added, embarrassed for some reason.  “It’s the last place on earth they’ll think to look for him.”  He rushed on by way of explanation.
Pulling down the front of Draco’s pants, he freed the blond’s erection then licked his lips. The skin was just as pale as the rest of Draco’s body, all except for the tip, which was flushed a pretty pink.
Pansy attended a fashion design school.
Chuckling to himself, Harry moved to do as asked. He was relieved to have something to do other than sit and watch all day. Besides, he enjoyed measuring out ingredients. It was mildly cathartic.
The Slytherin trio had thrown themselves into it, even after his father had disinherited him, Draco hadn’t cared.  The three loved the muggle nightlife.  They decided that was what the wizarding world was missing.  Draco took a dual major in accounting and business, while Blaise focused on Business and Advertising.
"It was fine," he answered. "All quiet. No incidents or anything."
"Er… yeah," Harry said. "First of all, I just want to remind you that I will not tolerate any sort of rudeness from you towards me or any of my guests. If you can't be civil and keep your mutterings to yourself, I won't hesitate to give you clothes and send you away. Understood?"
"Er...yes… I mean NO! Bollocks!" Ginny stammered. "I mean… I'm off to Luna's...er...bye!" She left the room as fast as she could, slamming the door behind her. Draco burst into laughter.
Thank you for reading! Until next time...
Massive thank you to Drarry Black and bookworm92 for the awesome and speedy beta work they do for me and CagedNTorn. They are rockstars!
“Come up here, this way.  Let me have a look at you.  The lighting is better in the vip lounge upstairs.”  Blaise said as Hermione came running over.
"Alright. Rest on the sofa and have a cup of tea while I finish my conversation with Draco about his new position. I've talked to Ginny and she's heading to the Burrow now."
“There isn’t much known about such things however your godfather Mr. Black was in possession of a very rare set of three books that detailed everything that is known about the fae realm.  I do hope given the present circumstances that you will allow me to come to Grimmauld place and read through them.”  He stated in his bored tone.
The two men panted heavily, then Harry chuckled, his lips against Draco's temple.
"No," Harry countered. "Why don't I walk ahead so you can appreciate the view.".He stood and started walking toward the door.
“Hmm.” Harry hummed. “Michael Corner. Nice choice.  He never let on that he was in any kind of relationship, except for Ginny.  I’m glad you had a decent first romance.  Your father and Voldemort really gave you a bad shake of things.  For the record, I never held it against you either. About the mark, I mean.”
“So that’s why you’ve gotten out your father’s old journals.  You’d best tell me everything.  Maybe I can help.”  Narcissa stated.  Draco told her everything and they figured out that this was likely an ally of Voldemort's that had been in another dimension pursuing alternative magics that the dark lord might have been able to use to return with.  They frowned at each other.  Draco took a letter and wrote out everything that he and his mother had found  and he charmed it to go straight to Hermione.
“You’re fucking sexy.”  The blonde groaned thrusting his hips into Harry’s mouth a tiny bit.  He did that twice before he pulled the brunette to his feet and picked him up.  Harry’s legs automatically wrapped around his hips as Draco slammed him down onto the desk on his back.  Staring into the bottomless pools of harlequin green that were Harry’s eyes.  He reached one hand between them and groaned as he felt the plug Harry was wearing.
“Nah mate. You know I haven’t had time. What with Ginny not taking it very well and all, I’ve been laying pretty low.” Harry supplied. “Why would they be contacting me for anything?” He wondered aloud.
In one swift move, Harry switched their positions and sucked in Draco's cock as far as he could then pulled back off. " We can talk about this later, " he said. "Right now, in this moment," he licked the reddened head of Draco's prick, " I want hard and muscle and to have you come so much in my mouth that I can't hold it all." He went back to work, sucking fast and hard, his hand finding the soft bollocks below.
"Yes!" Draco cried. "I want you to come so hard it will be running down my thighs for hours."
“Harry?  Harry, is everything alright?  The alarms didn’t go off…”  Draco mussed sitting up and grabbing his wand.  He then glanced at himself and he grabbed a pillow to hide his rather large situation.  He’d been having a marvelous dream.  He sighed and blushed slightly glancing back up at Harry.  “I, ugh, generally mother and I take the floo to work.  So I don’t get up quite as early as those who don’t have the luxury.  Plus old Piston has a coffee pot and I generally don’t eat much til lunch.  Um, oh the loo is down the hall.  There’s towels in there and I think I  have some clothes that should fit you.  I can bring them into your room.”  Draco offered still blushing.  "I have my own private bath if you’d rather use mine?  It’s a bit bigger than the one down the hall.”  Draco offered glancing anywhere but at Harry.  “Mother might have some breakfast though if you’re hungry.  She hasn’t had anyone to entertain in quite some time.”  Draco added offhandedly.
Both Muggle and Wizarding press were invited.  Draco wasn’t too sure how that would go down.  As the wizarding press would go gaga for people that the muggle press had no clue about and vise versa.  The blonde sat down on a leather couch that ran along the wall opposite the large desk.  It looked exactly the same as Draco’s office.  They’d gotten a discount on buying in bulk.  So there were leather couches strewn all around the various levels of the club.  It was an old warehouse that had been carved up into commercial real estate space.
“Well, or if not my place, any of your friends or just, any place that you don’t normally go.”  Draco added hastily getting to his feet and moving back towards the desk.
Harry chuckled at Draco's shuffling. "Merlin. What's wrong? You look like you need the loo. You know it's not healthy to hold it like that."
Draco wasn’t.  He didn’t give a rat’s arse about having a good name or good social standing.  He proved it to himself by not socialising or associating with the old pureblood families.  He trusted Blaise to guide him in which ones were vital to have around, and whom it was safe to blow off.  Even the ones they did associate with, they did so sparingly and only in professional settings.
Draco made the comment about Harry liking sausage. Was that the reason why his marriage to Ginny didn't work?
Harry, flustered as hell, nearly tripped following Draco out of the lift. Damn, that man played to win! And he won all right. Harry's ear tingled where Draco had nipped it and, truth be told, he wanted more.
“Darling! Have you seen the papers?” She called as she stepped out of the fireplace in a shower of sparkles. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Is this portal stable?"  Severus asked not budging.
"Grimmauld Place?" Harry asked, shifting his gaze to Hermione."
“I told you not to meddle.”  He stated, laying the jacket aside.  Pansy grinned.
Harry nodded at Draco then went to fire call Hermione. She answered quicker than expected.
“Here Harry, this is our spare room.”  Draco stated as he assisted the brunette to sit. “We don’t have any servants so no one will disturb you.  My room is just across the hallway if you need anything.  Mother and I have this place warded against everything under the sun.  You get some sleep.  I’m going to look through my father’s old records and see if there’s anything helpful in them.  Shaklebolt has already been through them and copied everything he thought was useful.  I just want to have another look for my own peace of mind.  No one will get you here.  You can count on that.”  Draco started with a certainty that he wished he felt.
"I'll help you with breakfast mum."  Draco mumbled ducking into the kitchen.
"Only cocks allowed in here. Go away, Ginevra." He mumbled then covered his head with the pillow.
That was all it took. Harry stiffened for a split second then made a loud keening noise in the back of his throat as his release crashed over him in a blinding wave. It felt like he spilled forever, and when he was finally finished, he collapsed onto Draco's back, panting and trembling from the intensity of his orgasm.
“Here Potter, lean on me.  We’ll get you fixed right up.  I have a first aid kit in my office.”  Draco said softly, not thinking too much about the fact that he was touching Harry Potter.  He was afraid his brain might melt if he allowed it to register.  So instead he led Potter with a very upset Hermione fussing over the both of them upstairs to his office.  With the door wide open, there was plenty of room for Blaise, Ron and Hermione, Harry and Draco all inside.  His office was enormous.  So was Blaise’s but it didn’t matter at the moment.
Draco leaned against the doorframe and crossed his arms over his chest to keep himself from fidgeting.  “Nah, bollocks!  I don’t know why I’m so nervous.  I wasn’t nervous in the lift.  Course it was a game then.”  He trailed off looking at the ceiling.  “I mean, I wanted to ask if you were ok, being back here after everything.  It’s got to be hard.  I’m not too proud to admit picturing Fred and George terrorizing Snape when we were here with the order was difficult.  It’s heartbreaking to see George by himself now.  I never know what to say.”  He forced himself to shut up. Waiting for Harry to tell him to get lost.
“Yes Master Piston, Harry has a bit of a situation and he’ll be stuck with me for the foreseeable future.”  Draco explained.
Harry's breath caught in his throat and he felt a rush of heat in his stomach. What the hell? He was ogling Draco nearly naked? What was that about?
He and Blaise together had gotten all the necessary permits and licensing required to own and operate a nightclub in both muggle and wizarding laws.  They were covered and up to regulation on both accounts.  There were a couple wizards only areas, the entrance to one was in what would appear to muggles as a simple cloak room.  Another entry from what looked to a muggle like a bathroom.
As one, Ron, Hermione, and Blaise nodded their agreement.
“I mean just that. I do not intend to do anything about it. It’s none of my business if Potter wants to get his arse stuffed. I’ve moved on from that. You should too. Besides. I’m quite certain that I’m the last person he’d want to see right now.”
Gathering himself, he cleared his throat and knocked on the edge of the door frame. "Er...Draco? It's morning."  Draco sat up blinking groggily.
He was a little thin, but then again he always had been. There was some muscle definition, but not too much. It was his tattoos he was most proud of.
Oh, so Draco could play that game too. Harry smiled. He didn't know exactly why teasing Draco was so much fun, but he planned to do more of it. He rather liked seeing the blush that colored the pale man's cheeks.
“Fuck off pretty boy!”  The larger of the two spat at him while the other sneered venomously in his direction.
Hey y'all! Massive thanks to Drarry Black, our prereading and beta whiz!
Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, Harry pulled on his all black outfit: slacks, no shirt, a fitted vest, and his suit coat.  The last thing to add was black eyeliner and a touch of mascara.  When he regarded his image in the mirror and saw that the vest had put his ink on display, he was satisfied and ready to meet his friends.
‘Damnit Blaise, where the hell are you?’  He thought to himself.  There were supposed to be people to keep this sort of thing from happening.   He smiled and signed his picture in magazines and copies of the ones they sold at the bar to his fanclub and other patrons who wanted one.  Realising that this must be the fan club, Draco played with them a bit and then bid them goodbye.  He posed with them for a final group picture and then turned and headed back towards the bar.  He was waylaid once again by Pansy.
“I fail to see the problem.”  Narcissa shrugged with a smile absolutely unphased by her son’s news.  Draco just stared at her as it registered that she didn’t care.
"Good," Harry continued. "Now, if you would, please show Professor Snape to his room and bring him any and all books he asks for. Then you can be dismissed for the night. Narcissa and Draco will be cooking tonight."
“Why would Hermione want to go to a gay club?” Harry asked not getting it. “You guys are ok aren’t you?”
"Kreacher," Harry said, forcing a smile, "you've done excellent on the house. You can retire for the night."
“Look,” Harry said, “I don’t want any trouble.”
Harry's eyes widened, his face hot. Ginny, finally realizing what was going on mere inches from her, jumped up like she'd been bitten and looked everywhere but at the two men in front of her.
Draco’s lips thinned and he looked pointedly at Hermione with a raised eyebrow.  He didn’t want to freak out Harry but what he’d seen was a true death eater and not just a fake.  He was afraid that if he said so out loud that Harry would all out panic and that wouldn’t help the situation at all.
There were several restaurants, Pansy’s clothing boutique, and a few other shops residing in the old warehouse.  Their club was far and away the largest and the most popular.  From the time they opened around noon, until the time they closed, they picked up traffic of all kinds.
Draco slipped his arm gently around Potters waist, higher up near his pits taking his weight.
Wasting no more time, Harry opened his mouth wide and took in just the tip of Draco’s cock.  It filled almost his whole mouth, and he loved it.  He sucked experimentally a couple of times then pushed his mouth down as far as it would go, which wasn’t very far.  To make up the difference, Harry wrapped his fingers around what wouldn’t fit.
“What are you going to do with Six passes?” Draco teased her. “We both know that I’m your only friend.” He added offhand.
After the war, Harry decided to get a tattoo of his mother’s eyes across the top of his back. It was his way of paying tribute to the woman whose love for him saved his life more than once.
"You can't stop thinking about Luna?" Harry asked, trying to make sure he was keeping up.
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re on about.” The blonde smirked into his tea. Pansy fixed him with the glare deserving of that statement.
“Old?  How dare you, you hag.  We’re the same age.”  The blonde screeched indignantly.
Harry then turned to Draco and Narcissa. "I'm going to unpack while you two cook," he said. "Let me know when it's ready, yeah?"
“I dunno Ron. I was just sitting there one day, bleeding from my nose, thinking how is this really all I’m good for? Is this really the sole purpose of my life? To go after and catch bad guy’s and eventually get killed by one? I just couldn’t stay with it. I got a lot of shit to sort through in my head you know? There was never time before. There is now so.”
“I wager you’ll get a lot further that way.”  He added kissing Harry’s neck lightly.
Just as Draco felt like Harry would truly win, his fingers inches in front of his own, Harry slowed down just enough so that Draco snatched the golden ball.
“It’s okay, you’re doing good.” He heard Harry’s soft voice. “Are you alright?”
They entered a bedroom that had a large bed and a fireplace with a couch and table surrounding it. Potter sauntered over to a big closet and pulled out something that probably should resemble a pyjama pants of some sort. As he was just about to change into it, Draco cleared his throat.
Draco hadn’t paid much attention before he had to grip onto his broom as to not fall when he heard a voice beside him.
“We were paying attention to you from the start and the way you froze…” Pansy cut herself off, looking off into the flames of the fire burning dimly in front of them.
Draco could only sigh in relief that no customers were currently present when Pansy waltzed in the door exclaiming loudly, her tinted sunglasses pushed up on top of her head.
“I’m fairly certain that you don’t have a fever. But you should probably take it a bit easy just in case.”
“I guess this is my second job now, huh?” Draco chuckled.
“I’ll start.” Granger said, as she lifted her wand.
“I liked the strawberries too though. And I’m feeling much better now.”
Draco put on his now dry clothes that Harry had folded and placed on one of the dining table chairs. He went down the stairs and outside.
“Just as I imagined.” Draco finished the sentence without properly considering his use of words.
“What?” Draco couldn’t for the life of him keep his sanity in check as he tried to calm down and stop staring at Potter’s way too perfect lips so close to his. Something in the back of his head tried to push through and tell him that Potter seemed to be more than aware of how much he was affecting him, but it didn’t matter. Draco was close to going mental the way things were progressing.
“S-sure.” Draco closed his eyes for a moment, trying to clear his thoughts and find a moment of happiness to focus on. He was proficient at occlumency and legilimens, so clearing his mind wasn’t difficult for him. He remembered the times when he was young when life had been peaceful and filled with joy, unaware of the dark future he would be facing. He switched through his memories easily navigating his mind. A memory of him playing in the garden with his mother surfaced, and he focused on it.
Draco felt himself freeze up for a second. Not in his wildest dreams had he ever expected to see a Weasley step foot into his shop. It didn’t help that the current Weasley wasn’t exactly a big fan of his.
Draco glanced over at Harry who was seated opposite of him. His stare was caught by green eyes as Harry gave him a grin. The candlelight on the table reflected in his glasses and outlined his striking features.
“That’s fine. I’m sure he’ll thank you once he’s feeling better. Perhaps we can even have tea together one day!” Lovegood looked excited as she spoke. “Harry joins me once in a while, so next time I’ll ask that he bring you along.”
“Yes, that must be quite a lot of work to deal with in itself.” Draco agreed, knowing he could’ve never managed such a task himself.
“Come in.” Draco opened the door and was pleased to see a much more structured office compared to that of a certain Head Auror.
As Potter moved down and his mouth latched onto one of Draco’s nipples, he also slipped a hand under his pants grasping Draco’s cock. It made Draco squirm and moan loudly from the sudden feel of Potter’s hand on his bare cock.
Harry just chuckled before leaving the bedroom, allowing Draco to sit in silence and enjoy his breakfast which made the day already so much better.
“What? Are you mad that you haven’t had the chance to see him in his pretty little uniform, or are you blushing because you can’t stop picturing how he’d look?”
“It is indeed.” Draco couldn’t deny the fact that this made everything a whole lot easier.
He stood up hurriedly, unaware that the person on the other side of the counter had been leaning over it and was still doing so.
“Am I dreaming?” Potter asked confused, obviously trying to take in the sight in front of him.
With a frown he looked up and when his eyes met Potter’s he realised he didn’t seem to be in any pain himself either.
“We’re not together anymore, you git!” Weasley bit back but was stopped by a hand on her shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was staring down at Draco, and Draco could feel himself becoming embarrassed.
Thank you for your kind words and support! <3
“I’m sorry mate. I can’t help you if you insist on cheering for the losing team every time.” Harry chuckled, and Draco couldn’t help but laugh as he saw the betrayed expression on Ron’s face.
Some of the customers had even started sending flowers to the shop together with a thank you card for how well the potions had helped them or their loved ones. This had been a truly remarkable change, and Draco took note of having to thank Granger once he saw her again.
The opening ceremony had not changed much since the time Draco was a first year filled with pride and self-assurance as he was sorted into the house of Slytherin. The only thing that seemed different after the war was the hesitance the older students showed when the first student to be called for the sorting was deemed a Slytherin. As the teachers realised, a fierce clapping sound was heard from the head table, making for a quick recovery.
Draco felt a lump in his throat at the uncomfortable realisation that his last thought before apparating had been about wanting to be saved. To go somewhere, for once in his life, where he could feel utterly and completely safe.
He barely knew the guy in front of him, and now here he was drenched at his doorstep and about to take a shower at this guy’s place. They weren’t even friends, wasn’t this a bit too weird? Draco thought.
“Hi!” Potter said, as he looked more dishevelled than usual as well, Draco noticed. His black hair sticking out at odd angles and his eyes still filled with a hint of adrenaline and mirth. It was intoxicating to look at, and it gave Draco some mental images that he had to shove to the back of his mind in order to function in front of the guy.
They sat for a moment in silence, before Draco, in his drunken state, let his feelings pour out.
Going to work wasn’t stressing him out as much as it used to, mainly because he knew he could end the day by sitting in front of a fireplace and watching a movie, or talking to the person he loved.
Potter hadn’t said much about the earlier situation regarding the love declaration, and Draco was not feeling brave enough to even consider breaching the topic. Perhaps Potter had just realised how silly it was to even contemplate such a thing and was now hoping Draco could just forget about it if he pretended to have forgotten as well.
“Hey! I’m plenty good already! Didn’t you see the last house match?!” Draco felt satisfaction at how easy it was to taunt Weasley. He still had the same attitude from before the war, and although it was infuriating to even talk to him, at least it felt somewhat normal.
“I don’t have to be.” Potter chuckled lightly. “Why not lower that wand and we can talk?”
It was then that he also realised another thing. He didn’t know the guy’s name either. They were literally strangers, but somehow, they were talking as if they were old childhood friends.
“I’m a professional, Pans! I would never do such a thing.”
“That would be lovely.”
“Please don’t be mad at her! She only worries, and since you haven’t been returning her letters lately, she asked me how things were going. She doesn’t want to tell you, but I think she is a bit lonely at the manor by herself.” Pansy said in a much lower voice now.
“Oh! I didn’t realise it was this late already” Draco said, feeling a bit embarrassed for not having realised what was happening around him. He hated being seen as a bother to others.
Both Draco and Harry looked at her with interest and a bit of hesitation after the last try.
“Was it good for you too…?” Draco said looking up through strands of hair that had become ruffled by the previous actions.
“What’s the shape of it? I would be owing Blaise 5 galleons if it turns out to be a ferret, so please tell me it’s something else!”
“Tell me, what do you think about Harry?”
“So…you
It had kinda made Draco feel like Harry was finding his reactions funny… or maybe hilarious. He couldn’t know whether it was just fun to tease him because Harry knew about his feelings, or if Harry was actually properly trying to test out a relationship.
“Harry’s been in a good mood lately. I always wondered why the sudden change came about. Perhaps it’s because of this shop?” Granger looked thoughtful as she spoke.
“I can’t take wearing wet clothes, it’s the worst.” Harry said, grumbling as he tried squeezing some of the water out of the sweater.
“Also,” Harry said, looking at Draco. “I’ll have a talk with professor Shrew. I’m sure it will make it more difficult for him to disregard your skills once I vouch for you.”
“I’m… close…” Harry breathed out, making Draco shiver. He felt himself nearing the edge as well with every hard thrust.
The next couple of weeks Potter stopped by the potion shop like usual. Sometimes he even stopped by just for a small chat with Draco and Pansy, when the shop wasn’t bustling with people.
Breathlessly he managed to say a faint yes.
“What?” Draco looked down at the board and saw his pieces mulling in defeat. He had been too worried and barely paid any attention to the game. However, it was a lost cause to try and blame it on that, as Weasley simply wouldn’t allow it.
Draco took a moment to properly analyse how he was feeling.
Draco felt uncomfortable as he was walking back home with a soaked sweater.
The Gryffindor’s must’ve had training today, Draco noted as he watched the last player walk over to one of the lockers in only a towel hanging dangerously low on his hips. His arms toned with strong muscles visible from afar.
“Huh? Um…” Draco got a bit taken aback by the fact that he hadn’t ordered it. “Oh! Don’t worry it’s on the house. It’s a new recipe I’ve been working on, so I just like to get the customers opinions” The guy smiled at him.
“I always assumed you were against breaking the rules. Brewing our own potion like that would be illegal.” Draco gave her an incredulous look.
“It’s fine.” Draco said curtly, still trying to process the dreadful thought of sharing a room with none other than Potter.
“Yeah… I should’ve told you once it happened. Sorry.”
“What are you reading?” Draco asked as he sat down, trying to read the title on the book. “Oh, it’s just a muggle book, ‘The Blue Bakery by The Ocean Side’ it’s called.” Potter shrugged, before putting it down on the table.
Draco sighed. He had no idea where to even start. Yes, he had become really fond of Harry during the months they had known each other, but would it really be okay to just give him something he himself think he’ll like?
Although Draco had seen him before, he hadn’t seen him fully erect like this. His cock curved up proudly as he lay down allowing Draco to get on top. Draco swallowed as he took in the view. He slowly reached forward and took Harry’s cock into his hand.
As Draco got to know Sebastian a bit, he found him to be a calm guy with a lot of charm. He was definitely in the other spectre when it came to energy compared to Amelia who always seemed full of energy and mischief. They both seemed to bring out the best in each other though, Draco noted.
“Ah, this is a great example on what not to do.” Professor Shrew was inspecting the mess and seemed overly gleeful at the fact that Malfoy had finally messed up. “Sadly, not everyone has an aptitude for potion making.”
“Don’t worry. I trust you.” Draco said reaching his hand up to brush a strand of loose hair from Harry’s eyes which were still filled with uncertainty. “I’ll tell you if I want to stop.” Draco said, knowing he had to reassure him before he would continue.
“Well, after I told you I wanted to try this, I did do some light research. The moment I realised I did love you, I started doing some in-depth research” Harry winked at Draco.
“Yup…” Potter said in a resigned voice. “That makes no sense!” Granger cried.
Certainly, something must be wrong with that head of his, Draco thought. Perhaps the war had been a greater burden on him than anyone really understood, and now the idiot had gone mad because of it.
Harry could feel Draco shiver under his touch. It made him want even more. He continued passionately kissing him for a while longer, until he finally managed to break the kiss.
Draco thought for moment, trying to systematically go through the previous days. He had been so deprived of sleep that some of the days felt more like blurs than anything else.
Draco felt the heat return to his cheeks as he looked away from Harry’s gaze, entwining his hand in Harry’s.
“It’s… I don’t know…I just don’t know if it’ll help.” Draco said, not wanting to completely dismiss the proposal since Harry was the one bringing it up.
Weasley turned back to his sandwich with a frown, having taken a hit by Draco’s words that had seemingly been spoken by his best friend. Draco felt a tinge of satisfaction for having managed to get to Weasley so easily this way. Perhaps the switch wasn’t as bad as he thought.
“Umm… I think she likes sweet stuff the most. She also likes anything with berries in them” Draco said trying not to meet Harry’s eyes for more than necessary. It was making him a bit restless when he was being watched so intently.
“Not at all! I’m just happy that Harry feels so comfortable with you that he wanted to invite you. He seems pretty happy about it”. Amelia sat down on the empty chair beside him, brushing off Draco’s worries about the bakery with a “I’m on a break”.
“So I’m actually in love… with a guy…” Draco mumbled thoughtfully.
Two days had passed since Draco had gone to the bakery. Was he starting to get addicted to it? He thought.
“Not at all! I know you’re a strong wizard, so I’m confident you’ll make it happen. Getting it on the first try is almost impossible, you know.”
“I’m glad. Hopefully he didn’t ruin the elegance of this place by being a twat to you.” Pansy felt the glare at her back from Draco, but didn’t bother to acknowledge it. Her tone had been playful enough in her opinion for Draco to forgive her sometime in the near future.
“Hey!” They were, or rather Potter was, met with a big hug that submerged him in a flurry of red. It only took a second for Draco to realise the familiarity of the red hair and he couldn’t help the imparted reaction that made him let out a disgruntled noise.
“Cus it’s not healthy. And seeing him takes the edge of, doesn’t it? You don’t have to constantly worry about running into him now that you’ve finally met after all this time.” Pansy looked pleased with herself, despite Draco thinking she had absolutely no reason to.
The bell jingled, signalling someone entering the shop. Draco groaned inwardly, as he lifted his head and looked towards the door.
His shield could hold for a while, but not long enough. Draco yelped as he felt a hex hit him straight on. It sent him flying backwards and his wand tumbled onto the grassy ground a few meters away from him.
“We can’t stay like this though. It’s still a big issue.” Potter sighed.
“You’re panicking way more than necessary” He said as he saw the wide-eyed look on Draco’s face.
“Are you sure you weren’t sorted into the wrong house at Hogwarts?” Draco lifted one eyebrow, clearly indicating that the Weasley girl, of all people, actually seemed to have some Slytherin qualities to her as well.
The room got quiet, as all that could be heard was a low “Oooooo….” From Ginny. Somehow it seemed like the youngest Weasley had one favourite consumption, which was other’s drama.
“I swear you’re incapable of the simplest things, Potter.” Draco huffed in annoyance.
“Do I?” Draco tried to keep his gaze steady, but Potter’s intensity was too much. He felt himself look away.
“Hey there! You wanna try out the new special? I’ve made a pumpkin spice latte for the holiday season” Amelia said. She was Harry’s little sister, and she shared quite a lot of similarities to her brother in appearance and her personality was also the nice type although a bit more upfront when it came to voicing her opinions. Draco quite liked her strong and confident attitude.
“I’ve seen Parkinson and Zabini there before, and I’m sure Harry will be there if you do decide to go.” Granger said, trying to make the offer sound more inviting than it really was.
“You’re being far kinder than I deserve, Lovegood.” At that Luna just smiled gently before reaching her hand out in front of her.
“Not a good one.” Draco muttered back but felt slightly better as the smell of herbal tea surrounded him.
After having spent several days contemplating, Draco had made a slip of the tongue and accidentally revealed his daydreaming of wanting to own a potion shop. Pansy hadn’t even let him realise his own mistake before she had jumped on the idea.
“Yeah, that’s probably reasonable.” Draco swallowed hard as he spoke. At least he now had a few more days to prepare for living on his own again if Potter chose not to want to pursue anything with him after all. He still probably had to find a place to stay even if Potter wanted something between them. They had been living together for a while now, but it hadn’t been a consensual wish from either of them at the start. And wouldn’t it just be weird to ask to move in with someone before even having been a proper couple first? But where exactly could Draco go? At least he had some time to think about it now.
“Er… It’s just… for dreams or well nightmares per se.” Draco mumbled the last words, busying himself with his wand and trying to keep a nonchalant look on his face.
The crowd that was still left looked at them with a mix of emotions. Half of them seemed amazed over the kiss although not surprised about the two of them being together. They just pushed the ones who stood still in shock from not having any clue about any previous rumours along while muttering about it being old news.
Damn it. Draco thought, knowing he had to return it soon. It had been laying there for quite some time now, as Draco had continuously tried to put off delivering it.
He made his way over to their table, stopping in front of them. He almost had to remind himself not to sneer at them, as it had become a habit over the years.
Harry slumped down next to Draco, both covered in sweat as they breathed heavily.
It felt like time completely stopped for a second as the last pulses of Harry’s hand around his cock and the messy thrusting made them go over the edge. Draco cried out as he felt himself spill his load heavily. He felt Harry shudder as he came inside of him, the combined feeling was insane.
Draco went back to his office and continued working and adding in some extra hours.
“Where is the fluxweed at?” Startled Draco hastily snatched one of the vials and showed it into his pocket before eyeing the person next to him.
“Malfoy” Draco felt a shiver surge through him at the mention of his name. This year was going to be hell, he thought. “Room 2.” McGonagall said and a few murmurs were heard around the room.
“No need to sound so depressed about it.” Draco felt a little less obligated to fight after hearing Potter’s statement.
“And what exactly do
“I-It’s fine” Draco stammered a bit. He was more surprised by seeing Harry in only in a towel. Sure, you could kind of see through his clothes that Harry had to be somewhat well built, but seeing him almost completely naked, he was definitely full of muscles.
Draco looked at Amelia a bit confused “What?”
“Will I ever see the day where your first words in the morning aren’t some sort of insult towards me?”
“Careful now. Don’t make me angrier at you than I already am.”
“Blaise!” Pansy smacked Blaise on the arm.
“Alright fine. I guess it’s only in Potter’s nature to go charging forward without a plan whatsoever, so why shouldn’t it apply to his love life?” Draco sighed before continuing. “However, he’s definitely not in love with me.”
“Tell me about it! The bakery was packed almost every day. Seems like everyone decided to stop by before New Year” Amelia sighed, looking a bit worn out.
“That wasn’t what I meant.” Potter frowned slightly but looked apologetic at the same time. “Well, not exactly at least. Sure, it would’ve been good if we had found them that way, but it would also mean that you wouldn’t have to worry anymore and could start rebuilding without the constant fear for your life.”
“Fine, I think.” He said at last.
“Don’t act so surprised, Potter. With your recent behaviour anyone would’ve started imagining things.” Draco said, trying to hide his embarrassment at his slip of the tongue.
“Mhm.” Potter said absentmindedly as he struggled with his pants.
“I’ve drank too much.” Draco said honestly, giggling at the lightness in his head. He was more than a little tipsy and it felt good. Almost as good as Harry’s hands holding him tightly.
“Sorry, it was in your hair” Harry said, looking at the leaf.
The words were a clear indicator of ‘Do try to stay as close together as you can, and no fighting.’
“This is amazing! It even tastes like Christmas” Draco said in awe, it once again showed just how good of a baker Harry was.
It felt nice to be able to relax like this after a stressful day at work, Draco thought.
Draco groaned as he was getting nowhere with this. It couldn’t be that he liked Harry, right? He didn’t! He just… Draco stopped for a moment, what did he feel for Harry? Was it possible that he wasn’t even aware of his feelings?
“You can make some cool potions using this. I can help you if you want.” Draco said, and Rosie grabbed his hand before he had finished his sentence and guided him into the living room.
As Draco held the snitch up, he couldn’t help but look over at the Gryffindor team. They were flying slowly and headed down to the ground. The best sight of all was Weasley who had just landed on the ground and was stomping towards the locker rooms.
Why would he even care? Draco thought, and that was exactly what he tried to convey next. “Why would you…?” The words trailed off.
“Yeah, quite different from last time I was here” Draco said back, trying to sound interested, although he wasn’t a fan of small talk, but the guy had a soothing voice, so maybe it wasn’t too bad. He also should try to get some friends in the area, as his circle of friends at work was fairly limited, and actually having some friends outside of the workplace could be a good change of pace.
“I see… Well, I should probably get a bit more familiar with how everything works around here” Draco said back, knowing he had taken very little interest in the small town since he moved here.
Harry stirred slightly before his eyes slowly opened, revealing brilliant green eyes that met Draco’s grey ones.
“She’s getting help though. Seems like Luna will be taking over the head position at the prophecy soon. That will definitely make the paper much more reliable.” Potter spoke with a fondness in his voice, showing how much he cared for and believed in his friends.
“Bastard.”
After dinner Draco kept his promise to Rosie who had, to Harry's dismay, completely changed the list of her favourite people.
“Come on! I’ll get you anything you want if you manage to keep up a civilized act around them.” Harry pleaded, making circling motions on Draco’s stomach.
“Then tell me, why won’t you even look at me anymore Draco?” Draco felt himself shiver slightly at hearing his name come out of Potter’s mouth so easily. He wondered when Potter had decided it was time to change over to first names the same way he had done with Pansy and Blaise. Or perhaps the situation at hand was just too tense that Potter had said it without being aware of it himself.
“Of course, I want to be an Auror, Harry! You already knew that.” Weasley looked dumbfounded at the question. “You’ll apply for an Auror position as well, won’t you?”
“What do you mean? What happened to him?”
“Do you feel comfortable trying it?” Potter asked, and Draco had to pull himself together in order to answer anything sensible.
Draco felt dread sweep over him at the thought of having to go back out into the storm at this late hour.
“I’ve been dealing with a big quantity of Weasley’s for a whole weekend, of course I’m tired.”
“That was a bit close for comfort, I gotta admit.” Harry huffed out in relief, still fired up on adrenaline.
“Here.” Harry guided Draco’s arms around his shoulders. “Hold onto me, okay.”
“Is Pansy not around?” Potter looked around the shop for a moment, searching.
“What? No way!” Draco opposed, sitting up in his bed.
It did not seem like Potter had noticed anything amiss as he dug through his cupboard and fished out what Draco assumed to be a charms homework paper.
He could feel the heat building up “I’m-“ Draco couldn’t finish his sentence before it was too late.
A strange notion came over Draco as he realised just how easy it was to work with Hermione. She had the same level of understanding as him and they seemed to easily catch up on each other’s reasonings and decisions.
“I can image” Harry chuckled. “How are you spending Christmas by the way? You’re going to spend it with your family?”.
“Everyone! Go grab the necessary ingredients and start brewing.” Professor Shrew said.
Opening the door to the shared room revealed that it was empty. “Good.” Draco muttered to himself as he figured he might be able to get into bed before Potter got back.
“What in the world could possibly make you mad at me? I have done nothing! I’m an angel!”
Yes, he did have a sweet tooth and it was something he would never tell anyone at work.
“So green…” Draco said leaning forward coming nose to nose with Potter and continuing to stare at him.
“What the hell are you doing?!” Draco shouted, clutching Potter’s shoulders, his legs awkwardly wrapping around his naked waist on instinct as not to fall, despite the hex keeping them together.
“Couldn’t you wait for one damn second to let me-“ Draco was stopped short by the fact that Potter was not looking at him, but rather behind him. He furrowed his brows as he turned his head slightly.
“Bloody brilliant.” Draco mumbled.
Draco had started wondering what was going on when he suddenly had multiple pregnant women come by and asking for a potion to help with their nauseousness. Soon it had become clear to him that Granger might be behind it as Potter told him she had been going on and on about how much it had helped her. Since so many were starting to request the potion, Draco spent long days working on it to make it better, last longer and most importantly taste decent.
“I have several points, if you’d like to see a few?”  He teased the redhead.  He stretched out showing himself off and enjoying how Harry blushed with embarrassment.  To say nothing of how hard he’d grown in his hand where Draco deftly stroked him under the covers.  “Perhaps she wants to play with us?”  He asked Harry.  “We could put your ex in the middle, what do you say?”  Draco added mischievously, his eyes sparkling with mirth.
“Yes.  I was referring to my relatives.  They starved me and kept me in the cupboard under the stairs.  They used me as their slave, practically.  Until I went to Hogwarts. When they found out I knew magic, they were still strict but not quite as bad.  They were terrified of Hagrid and Dumbledore. Anyway, I don’t think I need to elaborate.” He shook his head, as if trying to shake off the bad memories.
“I’m not stupid, Potter. You were about to apprehend me earlier, weren’t you?”
“And then I saw the spell go towards Harry, but he was already trying to fend off five of them at the time, so I just decided to jump in there and took the hit.”
“The war is over, dimwit!” Weasley scowled as he checked on Potter. It did make the situation quite surreal as a display of friendship was supposedly shown between a Malfoy and a Weasley. “You alright, mate?” Weasley asked as he gave Potter a worried look.
“It’s alright. You did your best at the time. I’m grateful for that.” Luna let her hand slowly sink down to her side again. “I’m okay, and I don’t blame you for anything.”
Draco couldn’t help but enjoy the pleasure. He had no idea that he would be this sensitive. Considering the fact that he had never been in a relationship before, he was on unknown territory.
“Why the hell do we have to have this conversation, anyway?! I know full well that we would never be anything more than old school rivals! And you know what? I don’t care! I can go back to that! Hell, I’ve buried these feelings for years already, why shouldn’t I be able to continue doing that?”
Harry positioned himself in-between Draco’s legs, and slowly nudged his cock into his hole.
“Will you ever stop with that relentless kindness of yours? With you constantly being nice, it’s making me into the biggest asshole, you prat.” Draco hissed back in a low whisper; his voice did not hold much animosity he realised after he spoke.
“Y-yes… more…” Draco gasped between breaths, hung up on the new sensation running through him with every push of Harry’s cock.
Potter frowned at him and had a serious tone as he continued talking. “Well, we don’t have the best of relations, so I didn’t want to risk being at the receiving end of whatever you were concocting.”
“Ah… That’s true…” Potter looked down slightly, his gaze lingering on Draco’s lips before looking away, his grip loosening. “Well, if you don’t, then I won’t.” His hands let go of Draco’s cheeks, and he stepped back slightly.
“H-Harry!” Draco managed to get out between the constant moans escaping him.
“No… I mean, I enjoyed his company. He was a great friend, really! I just…”
. How in the world could anyone look that good?
How odd wasn’t it to be sitting here with Potter, a Weasley and Lovegood and not be feeling completely out of sorts. Somehow Ginny was far less presumptuous than Draco had previously thought of her and was wholeheartedly taking his side when he mentioned the earlier debate him and Potter had about Quidditch teams.
Draco jumped as he retracted his hand with lightning speed. He turned only to find that the airy voice belonged to Luna Lovegood.
“Fine… I’ll give it a try. Don’t tell anyone about this conversation though… Not yet…” Hermione nodded and made a show of sealing her lips.
“Err… Yeah…” Draco mumbled, standing up and awkwardly taking a few steps back.
“Oh I would think! I work with Hermione Granger, she told me all about it when I complained about the nauseousness and headache I was having. She told me a friend of hers had this amazing shop that could be of help. I was a bit hesitant to try it, but Merlin I’m glad I did!” She paused for a second, thoughtfully before continuing. “I had no idea who this ‘friend’ was, but I must say I was a bit surprised to find out it was you. I know we haven’t exactly met before, but being muggle born I know about your name.”
“The saying, I could eat a horse, isn’t that far off it would seem” Draco got a quick jab at his side for his comment before Harry chuckled.
“Really? For what?”
Draco wandered off quietly into the brewing room, not able to stand the friendliness between his best friend and his damned crush. He hated himself for not being able to act as confidently as Pansy, but he couldn’t help it. After the war and after everything that followed, Draco had a much harder time suppressing whatever it was he felt for Potter. He also couldn’t hide behind their old animosity anymore, which was making everything much more difficult to handle. Now he felt like he became this weird, unnatural version of himself whenever Potter was around. It was like he became timid and overly aware of every move he made, and he wasn’t able to stop it. The double-meaning of Pansy’s words had also taken its toll on him.
“Er…Hermione?” Draco felt weird as he spoke her name for the first time in his life. It had always been Granger, or mudblood. Although after the war, the word mudblood was no longer something that could be uttered, nor did he desire to do so. It was part of his father’s control over him, teaching him from such an early age to discriminate against those who were not favoured by you-know-who. Granger had been one of the reasons as to why Voldemort had lost, and the world saved. For that, he was grateful.
Draco was sat for a moment not knowing what to do, as Harry had still not released his hand even as he continued eating the strawberry glazed waffle.
“She’s smart Malfoy, if anyone would be able to figure this out it would be her.” Draco scowled at him, unable to deny the fact that he had a point.
Pansy regarded him for a moment longer, obviously not convinced but letting it slide regardless. Draco continued tending to his potions, while Pansy started to go through their inventory, jotting down what needed to be refilled.
“Wouldn’t it be better to tell McGonagall though? She might be able to help.” Potter said.
“What?”
“Hello, how may I help you?” Draco said, straightening out his shirt.
“That’s… Thank you.” Draco said, letting go of Potter quickly and turning his head slightly downwards, not wanting to show the red that was already showing on his pale skin.
“I gotta ask you… How did you manage to apparate?” Said Potter, his voice breaking the calm silence. “You were completely out of energy by the time you landed in my bathtub, it couldn’t have been easy to muster up any sort of magic, much less in order to apparate.”
“Can I get you some tea while you wait?”
“Well, I think it’s time for us to head home now.” Ginny looked at her watch before standing up.
“Always the favourite, aren’t you Granger.” Draco sighed, knowing Professor Shrew would never give him the same treatment. “Hey, it’s saving us a lot of trouble right now.” Granger argued back with a cheeky grin.
“What?” Pansy only half-listened, as she counted the Jobberknoll Feathers diligently.
“I’ll protect you, I promise.” The sudden confidence in Harry’s voice was comforting the turmoil in Draco’s stomach.
Draco jumped in his seat, almost spilling popcorn all over the sofa.
Again, Draco found himself frowning at the man in front of him, who was now holding a spoon up to his face.
“Here, you’ve got to try this” Harry said, as he pointed his fork towards Draco.
He couldn’t remember exactly when his trousers had been discarded, but he was now lying there completely naked as he felt himself beg. “Please…”
Weasley looked at him both in awe and utter betrayal. “How much have you practiced, mate? You’ve never made a potion this well before.”
Draco could do nothing more than wait patiently, despite the awkwardness of being around Potter at all times of the day.
“I was so charmed by your words. No insults, just pleasantries.”
“It must’ve slipped my mind. I was terribly sick, love. You should show some pity towards your hardworking friend, you know.”
After a little while Draco headed for the door as well. He got sight of Granger who was standing beside Ron, worry in her eyes as they were focusing on Potter who started mingling with Pansy and Blaise. Draco could only hope that they didn’t notice the imposter pretending to be him.
“Merlin, no!” Draco scoffed, but couldn’t help himself from laughing.
Why was that witch so bloody clever at piecing things together and knowing how to catch him off guard enough to get her answers?
“So… You like holding hands, huh?”
Pansy peered over him as he sat casually brewing a headache potion. He had found it difficult to concentrate, so instead he had spent two hours working on making a headache potion that would mimic the taste of treacle tart. For no reason whatsoever. It was just for fun he reassured himself.
Potter had a sheepish grin on his face there he stood between a disgruntled Granger and an amused Weasley. Draco scoffed silently. He was well aware that the potion was a complete failure and would need several changes for it to even remotely resemble the potion in question. Shrew seemed too infatuated with the glorious saviour to see the many faults in front of him.
Harry, on the other hand, seemed so effortlessly good at baking. Everything he had tasted this far had been better than anything he had previously tasted.
“You talked way too much, you ate properly and you very overly kind to everyone around you. That’s the opposite of the person you’re embodying.” Pansy let out a sigh.
“I’d rather get it all out if I’m being honest.”
“It’s the spell, it gotta be. Whatever put you two together doesn’t seem to like it very much when you are too far away from one another.” Granger looked more than pleased at her own deduction, and it took all of Draco’s willpower not to sneer at the Minister of Magic right in front of the Head Auror.
Once again Draco saw Harry rise to the same height as him and scout over the pitch for a minute. After a while Harry flew over, coming side to side with Draco.
As Harry opened the fly on his trousers, Draco raised his hips to allow him to pull both his trouser and underwear off in one swift motion. Draco gasped loudly as he felt the chilly air hit his semi-hard cock. He looked up only to find Harry staring down at him without any reservations, his eyes darting over his body hungrily.
“Oh, then thank you” Draco said back. “You want a refill?” The guy pointed at the coffee, and Draco nodded and said his thanks as the guy placed a hot cup of coffee on the table, before going over to serve one of the other customers.
Harry slowly started kissing Draco’s thighs and as he moved closer and closer to his cock, Draco was whimpering more and more.
“I’m telling you; the Chudley Cannons are obviously the best.” Potter said in an amused tone as Draco scoffed.
“Where are we going?”
“Oh… Yeah.” Potter looked sheepish for a moment. “I didn’t think about it really. I got too shocked about the sudden downpour and just made a run for your shop instead.” He seemed to laugh a bit at his own silliness, but Draco couldn’t help but enjoy the fact that Potter had automatically gone towards his shop instead of taking shelter wherever.
Although Draco enjoyed feeling like his former self in the way he was being treated as Harry Potter, he also found himself understanding Potter’s life a bit more. He had always thought him to be a selfish prick that didn’t have to worry about anything since everyone adored him.
Everyone else seemed pleased with the situation, unaware of the current predicament Draco was facing.
Draco was brought out of his own thoughts instantly as he realised, he had been going on for far too long, and was now basically just petting Potter’s head repeatedly.
“Oh…” Granger seemed horrified as she took in the new information.
“Again, no need for hurtful comments, Malfoy.” Potter’s lips twitched as he flew off to the other side of the field.
“Tch!” Draco felt his words fail him as he came to realise that he had no idea what to do at this point. There was no way he would be able to use the wand still held tightly in his hand against Potter. First off, too much had happened between the two and Draco could feel himself unable to do much more than point the wand at the guy. Even that was straining as he knew how much he owed to Potter. Secondly, he knew Potter had fast reflexes and considering he had already spent a few years as an Auror, there was no telling how good he had become at wandless magic. At this point it was difficult to know if Potter was unable to perform crafty magic without his wand, or if he just simply regarded the situation not dire enough.
It took Draco a few more seconds to process everything before he could open his eyes in a daze.
Draco lay down, dragging Harry with him. He felt a bit feverish as he took in the sight of Harry easily towering over him. “You’ll tell me at once if you want to stop, right?” Harry’s confidence seemed to have faltered a bit as he realised where they were headed.
It was interesting for Draco to watch how Harry interacted with people. He seemed to know most of the people in town, and especially the ones who were also dabbling in the same business as him.
Draco walked over and took a seat. The pie smelled amazing and it looked incredible as well.
“Well, I never really found it to be interesting. Cooking on the other hand, I find much more enjoyable.”
He wouldn’t make it in time, he knew that. Still, he threw himself forward trying to grab onto his wand just as a crucio was directed at him.
“Fine…” Draco moaned.
Draco felt a twitch in his hand, as he thought back to the nightmares that had involved you-know-who far too many times. “I did.” He said curtly.
“Also, the reason why they don’t do it, is because the process takes longer, and it can’t really be stored for a longer period. So, instead they deem it more appropriate to just ignore the patient’s discomfort, considering the number of patients who get the side effect is fairly small.”
‘It couldn’t go on like this’ Draco thought to himself. He wouldn’t be able to pass any of the classes, much less his N.E.W.T.s. if he never got more than a few hours of sleep. The lack of sleep had resulted in his appetite being as poor as it was, making it even harder to function as a normal human being.
“Just relax. Do you mind if I go down on you?”
“You’re not fooling anyone, Pansy. Fair enough that you got sick and couldn’t do it, but you could’ve postponed it, or at the very least given me a heads up.”
“Yeah, so hurry up and tell me if it’s a ferret or not!” Pansy laughed, and Draco felt both annoyed at his two friends for making bets about it, but also slightly relieved that his Patronus hadn’t actually turned out to be a bloody ferret. Potter would’ve had the time of his life had that been the case.
Draco felt himself turn around as he cocked his head to the side slightly. “Oh? I suppose that’s true for someone who only relies on his broom to do the work.”
They watched the movie. It was a romantic comedy and it was fairly well made, Draco thought to himself.
“You alright, Harry?” Granger studied him closely with worried eyes. She was quick at sensing things, so Draco couldn’t afford to blurt out anything else.
It felt strange so see this side of Harry. To see him vulnerable and peaceful at the same time. He seemed younger when one couldn’t see the burden of carrying the weight of the world in his eyes. Draco lightly touched Harry’s lightning scar. It was a reminder of everything that had happened, just like Draco’s own Death Eater mark. Yet, Harry’s was a symbol of greatness and promise rather than darkness and evil.
“Brilliant detective work there, Weasley. Shame you have no idea what you’re talking about.” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes.
“Another Weasley, how lovely.” Draco muttered.
“I brought you some headache potion. I tried making it taste like treacle tart but ended up with strawberry instead.” Draco felt himself chuckle lightly at that. “Sorry ’bout that.”
“But I do have this potion I got from Hannah. It will help ease the pain to an extent, making it possible for you two to have a bit more distance between you. Although, I must warn you. It’ll most likely let you get into different rooms on the same floor of the house without both of you crouching over in pain. However, the magic keeping you two together is strong, so it’ll still feel fairly painful.”
“Oh, come off it. You know, of course you do.”
Their teamwork had managed to knock out a few of the people attacking them, but not nearly enough as it only seemed like the number of dark cloaked figures were multiplying by the second.
“Sleeping draught.” Potter sauntered into the back of the store, looking around like he, for once in his life, found the idea of brewing potions interesting.
“Well… Er… It’s valentine’s day, so I just… Maybe if you don’t feel too exhausted, we could make some… together”.
“I barely did anything. You made this happen. It’s not often someone manage it so quickly. That’s amazing.” Potter said, not looking bothered by the sudden awkwardness Draco was feeling.
“Funny for everyone else.” Potter chuckled.
It was suddenly quiet all around them as the others had apparated back to the ministry and only Draco and Harry were left in the dark forest. They started walking.
“Hi! I was afraid you wouldn’t come” Harry grinned as he walked over to Draco.
Harry continued slowly making his way down his neck and collarbone, opening Draco’s shirt and tracing kisses down his stomach.
At one point it felt like he was going to be dragged off to the sea by the strong wind, howling around him.
“It’s sturdy enough, I’m sure the satisfaction will outweigh the damage.” Draco shrugged. Again, Draco was only given a light chuckle, as Potter turned to head out the door.
“I don’t want to get closer to him!”
“It’s not too bad though.” Draco noted. Pansy gave him a side glance as she spoke. “Same with Potter. You two might not have the best relationship, but at least he doesn’t seem hell bent on some form of revenge or anything.”
“I nearly ruined everything! At the manor I almost got you killed!” Draco yelled feeling a lump in his throat making it difficult to keep his voice steady.
The devil might work hard, but Pansy works harder, Draco thought and sighed.
Draco nodded in agreement. It did look really good, and he noticed that he hadn’t seen it before in the bakery when he used to visit. It must be a new addition, he thought to himself.
Potter did neither. “Can I come in?”
“I suppose this is something I can get used to.” Harry gently stroked Draco’s cheek as he took in his features.
“That’s all the components I’ll be needing for the antidote then?” The witch said as she, with a hint of uncertainty, looked over the various ingredients, clearly unfamiliar with the potion.
“Then we’ll have to make sure all six of them show up.” Potter added.
“Then what’s all this?” She pointed at the notes strewn across the table, and the cauldron that was smelling oddly like strawberries instead of treacle tart.
After dinner they gathered around the fireplace and the Christmas tree that was protecting the little bunch of presents underneath it.
“To see if it’s good or if it needs more spices.”
“Alright… I’ll let it go for now. But please tell me if you need to talk to anyone.” Pansy said with a small smile that tried to relate some kind of understanding to his situation. Draco returned the smile, knowing full well that his problems would stay with him alone.
As things had finally started to calm down since the war and students were returning to Hogwarts, people were in desperate need of something to ease the tension felt between certain students or houses.
“Got an Auror uniform on, yet still acting like a child now are we, Weasley?” Draco scoffed, irked by the use of the damn ferret nickname that the weasel never seemed to have moved past. “I’d like to commend Granger for having the patience to put up with you.”
“Nope!” He yelped, trying to count in his head.
“I just can’t calm my mind” Draco said, sighing.
Draco couldn’t help it as he felt himself doze off. He was exhausted. There had been far too much happening in one day, and he had exerted all his energy. Harry seemed just as tired as he slid an arm across Draco’s chest and snuggled into him.
The time flew by, and after a while Draco found it was time to head back.
He looked at his watch, it was not too long before he had to get to work. He groaned as he didn’t want to get out from the warm bed. He was certainly not a morning person.
“I guess that doesn’t sound so bad” Draco said back. He knew he would regret it if he didn’t accept the offer given to him. Although he was experienced in spending Christmas alone, it wasn’t really something he himself wished for.
“Er…Well…” Harry was still unsure what to do or say at this point. Only Amelia knew of what had happened at the party and with the busy life of everyone, it had been rather easy to play it off as ‘he’s been working’ or ‘he had some other matter to attend to’, which had been fine so far.
“Hah, is that why Harry comes here? Are you acting all friendly with him now or what? Sucking up to the hero, eh?”
Life was starting to look brighter for Draco and, of course, when things are going well, something is always going to happen.
“I could move.” Draco breathed, his mind beginning to turn into a puddle of nothing.
“But there’s no way I would’ve taken the wrong-“ Draco stopped as he remembered the event that had happened when he tried to obtain the last ingredient. “Damn it.”
Pansy sighed, already showing signs of defeat before starting. As they walked over, Draco saw Abbott join in from the side giving Pansy a supportive smile and handing her one of the ingredients she was gathering. Pansy had apparently managed to form a bit of friendship with the Hufflepuff already.
“Just making sure you ain’t poisoning me.” Weasley huffed, sticking his nose up.
He sat down on the stool next to a table housing five cauldrons. The aroma and soft bubbling of potions brewing were soothing and able to slightly calm his anxious mind.
“I’ve never done this before.” Harry’s voice was soft as he spoke. Draco leaned up, pressing their lips together. “Me neither.”
“No! Don’t worry! Everything is fine, I just got a bit stressed out about the work I had forgotten all about, so I rushed a bit too much I guess” Draco said as an excuse to the whole mess that had happened two days ago.
The rest of the week went by slowly, being overloaded with homework and having to cram for their N.E.W.T.s. everyone seemed miserable.
“I’ve been minding my business lately, but it seems like there are still…people… out there who doesn’t take kindly to those who no longer follows a certain dark lord.” Draco started, and a quick glance at both of the staring pair of eyes made it clear that they knew exactly what he was talking about. “Let’s just say, your job or eradicating all the Death Eaters still on the loose is not going… swimmingly.”
“Er…” Potter suddenly got a look of embarrassment as realisation seemed to hit him.
“Indeed! I couldn’t have asked for a better one.” She grinned back.
But before anything more could happen, Hermione proceeded to slap Ron across the back of his head.
“I might have to start working out myself.” Draco felt himself wanting to hide his own body.
The train was already crowded with people trying to find compartments that were empty. Draco felt luck being on his side as he had boarded the train right beside an unoccupied compartment. He made his way inside, putting his luggage away before settling down with a book. He hoped he wouldn’t have to meet any of his former classmates before arrival.
His hands ran through it over and over, feeling the softness. Oh, how marvellous it would’ve been to be able to tug at it lovingly, knowing it was your right to do so.
“I had no idea…” Draco mumbled, unsure what to make of the situation.
(See the end of the chapter for
How ironic that he would end up right in Potter’s lap. Was this his punishment for choosing the wrong side during the war? Did his magic really just undermine his own wishes in order to seek protection once more from the one person Draco would rather spend the rest of his life avoiding? Sure, things had changed. They were no longer kids and Potter had testified at his and his mother’s trials, making sure they didn’t go to Azkaban. It was almost impossible, even for Draco, to consider Potter a bad person. And perhaps that’s what made it all so much worse. Draco could no longer blindly follow his father’s hatred and was instead forced to see Potter for who he was. A much better person than himself. It was agitating and only helped in making Draco feel even worse about himself and his previous choices. Perhaps that was why it was so immensely difficult to be nice to Potter as well, because in a way, Draco didn’t feel like he deserved to receive any kindness in return.
“That’s awesome! Dad can’t do potions at all! Only mum knows how, but she’s busy with Hugo aaaaall the tiiime. I tried asking Harry, but he’s the worst at it!” She sighed dramatically, obviously having been through a lot of difficulties dealing with the golden trio herself.
Potter made a surprised “Oh!” as he followed Draco’s pointing and found the ingredient placed neatly in front of him.
Draco walked briskly down the alley leading to a large forest. He was glaringly aware of being followed. The moment he reached the forest he sped up his pace further. He knew he had to reach the clearing before getting into contact with the ones following him.
It was hard for Harry not to notice Draco’s trembling, and he raised an eyebrow at him. “If you’re trembling because you’re scared then please do tell me.”
“Huh? Oh…Oh!” Draco felt himself become slightly uncomfortable as he had kinda hoped Potter would forget all about it.
“I’m sorry. We probably should’ve had a better backup plan.”
“What?” Draco felt Potter trying once more to lift him, even just an inch away from his own body without any result. “It’s like there’s a sticking charm on us!” Potter huffed as he too relented his attempts at separating them.
“That’s just using his name for extra perks!”
“Don’t start…”
“Yeah, it’s a nice combination of having my workplace easily accessible whenever I want to work on big projects. A bit easier to just walk upstairs instead of having to travel back and forth when I do all-nighters” The guy said and opened the door to a warm and cosy flat.
“You were mumbling. What are you thinking about?” Pansy sat down beside him, studying his face as she spoke.
Then Draco froze. He felt an icy shiver run through his body as he for a split second believed the sight in front of him to be Potter as an angel. Meaning things had gone far worse than he had previously thought.
“Potter…”
“Well, there must’ve been some reason to it, as I don’t suppose you normally go around attacking people in their own homes.” Draco wanted to protest and throw a remark at him, but Potter continued. “As far as I’m able to discern from both the state of your clothes and exhaustion of magic, it looks like you’ve been in a pretty heavy fight.”
“That’s very nice of you.”
“Well, I was teamed up with him during defense class today, and he wasn’t his usual self at all!” Weasley was furrowing his brows, his eyes locked on the blonde figure sitting at the Slytherin table.
He sat for a while longer before he decided it was time to leave. It would be bad if some of Potter’s other friends were to visit him and found Draco Malfoy sat beside him. They most likely would think he was the cause of Potter’s injuries.
“I imagine quite a few there wouldn’t take kindly to an ex-Death Eater showing up and asking for help.” Said Draco. “Also, there would be too much chaos if anyone spotted the great Harry Potter and a Malfoy together.”
“What?!” Draco was outraged and didn’t care to stop and think about how he was probably playing right into the redhead’s hand. “I didn’t care at all about that! I’m glad he didn’t shake it back. Who would’ve even wanted to be friends with an idiot like him?”
They both looked at each other before downing the vial in one go.
“And if it all fails you can just move to Italy with me. There’s lots of handsome guys over there” She said as she found a particularly tasty looking Berliner pastry.
“And about those Death Eaters. I’m not about to shush you out the door and turn a blind eye if that’s what you think. Catching them is part of my job, and even if it wasn’t I would still do everything in my power to make sure they’re sent to Azkaban and that you’re safe.” His furrowed gaze relaxed a bit and gave way to concerned eyes. “I’ll look into it and talk with the others about it as well. We’ll figure it out and we’ll get them. I promise you that.”
“It will be an issue! What exactly is going on here? Why’s the ferret here? And why are you two acting so bloody civil to one another?”
“Oh, shush! It’s already been five years since the war. You have to start living again, or you’ll never get through the rest of your life.” Pansy pleaded, gripping Draco’s hand in hers.
Draco sighed as he once again stood outside the big wooden doors of Granger’s office. By now, he was definitely spending far too much time trying to convince one of his former rival’s best friend that he was, in fact, not together with said rival.
The weather was only getting worse, but the reminder of the calm and warm atmosphere at the bakery made Draco take a bold decision.
After having excused himself to use the bathroom, Draco made a note of regaining the usual distance they had before when sitting together.
“Granger won’t let me tell them all to fuck off either, which isn’t helping.”
The sting in his chest was still apparent as he weighted the pain against the alluring warmth of a good, long shower. Biting his teeth’s together, he spent a couple more minutes than necessary just standing there, soaking in the water.
Draco gave her and Blaise a small smile as he muttered “Thank you.” The rest of the trip was fairly quiet between them, although the tension seemed less dense. Everyone seemed to be in need of some peace and quiet before facing Hogwarts once more.
Draco might’ve lost his head for a moment, but he wasn’t stupid, so he said nothing as Potter walked them over to the big fireplace. Grabbing a handful of Floo powder, Potter threw it into the flames and asked for Hermione Granger.
Potter seemed to notice Draco’s hesitation, but before he could utter another sentence, the sound of someone entering through the fireplace could be heard, and then what seemed like two people chatting and laughing loudly upon entry.
“I’ve spent all my years during school trying to pick fights with him and finding out what he was up to, I know better than anyone that he’s a human like the rest. An awkward, oblivious idiot. Also, I’m not in awe!”
“Oh?” Amelia looked a bit surprised at the fact that Draco had also prepared a present. Her eyes lit up the moment she opened it.
“Good, you’re awake.”
“Of course they would. They’re able to get high quality potions there, so it’s no wonder they start to frequent it. I just gave a little push is all. Nothing big, but people seemed to spread the word like fire.” Hermione chuckled.
It felt nice getting into a warm place, as he had been freezing on his way over to the bakery. He hung up his soaked jacket and umbrella and took of his shoes. He realised even his shoes had become drenched from the rain. Great… Draco thought.
He allowed himself to pull his legs together trying to hide his erection as he felt too exposed, too vulnerable. Harry’s hands were warm as they slid up his thighs and firmly squeezed them. The look in Harry’s eyes was warm and gave Draco a sense of trust as he waited for Draco to decide on what to do next.
“Your mother sent me a letter; you know” Draco didn’t know. “She asked me to keep an eye out for you if I could. She was worried with you going back to England again. It was what prompted me to change the wards in the first place.”
As Draco continued eating his own waffle, Harry resumed to talking as if the event hadn’t bothered him much.
“Yeah, sorry to ruin your little deductions, but Draco and I certainly aren’t a couple. Although God knows I tried nagging him into being my boyfriend when I was young and dumb.” Pansy made a grand gesture of ignoring Draco’s glare as she walked over to one of the tables and put the lunch down, her tone way friendlier than Draco’s. “Also, for your information, we weren’t scheming, we were gossiping. I must say, the golden trio were quite a popular topic back then. Or well… one of you were.”
“Potter.” Draco’s voice was hoarse as he spoke.
Once more Draco heard a mumble from Harry and then felt a cleaning charm sweep across his body.
It was nice to feel the steady rise and fall of another person’s breathing, and the warmth from Harry’s body on his. Draco noted how when he was this close to Harry, he had this protective atmosphere about him. It made it easy to fall into a dreamless sleep.
“It- it hurts! In my chest!” Potter was leaning forward slightly, and Draco took a few more steps away trying to reach the dining table to sit down. Somehow, that only worsen the already dreadful situation and Draco felt his legs give in underneath him.
“I have to thank you by the way.” Draco began.
“Oh please. A knight would look handsomely put together. Not sporting a bird’s nest on their head, that’s for sure.” It felt exhilarating to be joking with Harry after having been so close to danger just minutes ago. It helped Draco calm his nerves and focus on something else entirely. He needed some outlet for the rush of adrenaline that was still pumping through his body.
Draco took a deep breath and relaxed. It made it easier for Harry to carefully and slowly nudge his finger inside of Draco.
He opened the door and saw that Potter was seated on the couch with papers strewn in front of him. It was odd to see him actually do any sort of paperwork, considering that it had never been an occurrence at school unless Granger was breathing down his neck. However, now he seemed so professional, and the short glimpse of his concentrating face was a new side Draco had never seen of Potter before. The fireplace was lit, and it gave the room a warm, orange light that was mirrored in Potter’s glasses as he looked up once he realised he was being watched.
“The bakery is going to be pretty busy until New Year, so I won’t have that much free time” Harry said in an apologetic tone to Draco as they were all busy layering themselves in dozen of clothing’s that would make it a tiny bit more bearable going out in the cold weather.
Draco noticed that Harry was being silent for some reason, as he looked up, he was met with those emerald green eyes staring directly at him.
“Stop looking so intently.” Draco said, reaching out to cover himself with his hands, feeling self-conscious. Sure, he wasn’t bad looking, but it didn’t keep him from getting embarrassed when Harry looked at him so openly.
“I do.”
“Say… You seem rather worried yourself. Is it because of Harry?” Weasley didn’t look up as he spoke. His eyes focusing solely on the chess pieces in front of him.
“Don’t worry. I’ll help you get started and once you get the hang of it, it’s actually pretty straight forward.”
“You’re sorry for a lot, aren’t you?” Draco scoffed back.
Harry smiled warmly and kissed Draco once more “I love you” he said as he pushed forward making Draco fall back onto the couch with Harry hovering over him.
“Also, your potions are far better than the other’s I’ve tried. So that’s also a bonus for me to be honest.” Potter smiled, pulling out the right amount and allowing no further discussion on the topic.
“Oh, such a cumbersome task. How lucky I am that it’s not my burden to bear.”
There wasn’t a lot of stores here, as most of the stores were located a bit further into the town centre. Draco did, however, pause at the small bakery that was welcoming him with a colourful ‘Blue Ocean Bakery' sign. The bakery was beautifully painted and looked almost like a post card in Draco’s opinion.
“I can’t believe this is happening.”
“Yeah? You had more practice though, so it’s not fair.” Harry chuckled and leaned in, kissing Draco gently. It felt like fire when their lips met, and it ended way too soon.
