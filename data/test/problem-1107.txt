“I just reckon, if we have to be colleagues, I’ll try to be patient, yeah? I don’t want it to be completely painful.”
Harry scoffs but doesn’t stop him when he reaches out again, tentatively, touching the arms Harry’s braced to either side of him. He closes his hands around his wrists. They’re warm and clammy and he can feel Harry’s pulse in them, fast and constant. He releases them, wrapping his fingers gently around his neck in the thrill of success, thumbs pressing to his cheeks, brushing across them softly at the lines of his cheekbones and taking a moment to appreciate his features from so close.
“I don’t remember ever using that word,” Draco deadpans. He means to allude jokingly to the fact that he’s technically never said those words out loud, though he’s thought them often. Harry’s face flickers and falls as if he hasn’t caught the sarcasm.
At Blaise’s, soon after their pub night he’d unfolded himself from under Pansy on the couch and stood in front of them both. “I’m inviting this critique one time and only one time—after this we shall forget it ever happened,” he’d said.
His appetite has waned. And past the more heated bits of the spat, his heart rate is settling and his frown is growing. He was so determined not to let Malfoy’s words bother him that he’d kept it from Ron and Hermione all weekend. When he rejoined them in the pub, he’d said he asked Malfoy about his progress on the case, and if he was extra quiet the rest of the evening, they didn’t mention it.
So as much as he wants ‘I don’t want to handle one of your little fits’ to provoke a ferocity in him, he instead feels his fist unclench. No one has called his moments of frenzied emotion
He grins. “I love it. Thank you.” Harry’s gallery wall had made the move to Grimmauld Place and he can already imagine this joining the ranks. His first contribution.
He captures Harry’s lips before he can respond, flicking his tongue in and smirking when Harry makes a sound of surprised acceptance.
He leans over the message board to read an article torn from the Prophet about the Ministry’s best Aurors and their guilty pleasures, discovering that despite a constant refusal to participate when ambushed coming to or from work there’s a small line at the bottom reading ‘
Oh, thank Merlin. “Ah, yes. I am, actually,” he says, letting out a slow breath. “It’s been an intriguing opportunity to apply my research.”
He follows breathlessly up to the top floor with Draco, his overnight bag in his hand, and he picks at the threads on the handle in the silence of the lift. He avoids Draco’s eyes, which flick to him, look him over and stare a bit long in quiet concern.
Ron’s excited to travel with the team. Because it’s the national team, he’ll end up all over the world, and the look on his face is reminiscent of the enthusiasm he’d shown after his family travelled to Egypt a lifetime ago. It had taken him ages to finally stop talking about the trip, and again, when he and Hermione had honeymooned in Australia, Harry had sat through roughly 200 printed photos.
“For the ink and pens, yes, perfect. And it’s so portable—what… Harry…” He holds up a key. “What’s this?”
And, as he treks alongside Ron, Neville, and Luna singing old Hogwarts songs down the path towards the little village, Harry can’t remember the last time he rode his broom.
His friends are all aware of his favourite pastime. Ron had looked morbidly entranced when he explained mixed martial arts as an aggressive combination of boxing’s full contact and all the grappling and ground fighting of wrestling. Hermione shook her head wondrously, too, but seemed to like that Harry had an outlet. She was right, of course—they watched his demeanour changed the more he frequented Jab and so offered quiet, confused support.
Instead, he shuffles to his bed and undresses lethargically before nudging Dante off his pillow and crawling in, thinking, as his eyes fight to close, how silly it was to keep a nemesis.
Harry stirs slightly, just enough to move his hand to the necklace, but keeps his eyes shut. A steady beat. His own heart slows significantly at the reassurance.
skull,” he orders, then ducks down immediately as it’s ripped from Harry’s hand and shoots towards where his head had been. It hits the wall behind him and rolls to a stop on the floor.
Harry has the briefest moment to recognise the surrealism of Draco Malfoy calling the start of a round in his Muggle gym before Lars begins testing the waters. He switches stance swiftly as Harry does, stuck in the early dance of a fight where both parties are yet to swing.
“Alright, Auror boy, I trust your analysis,” Draco says weakly. The way Harry strategises Diagon Alley makes him look like a proper extrovert.
God, he looks utterly remorseful. He’s rubbing an eyebrow incessantly, bouncing a little on his feet. Draco’s not often this untethered. If he wasn’t so anxious himself, he’d find it captivating.
“Teddy…” Harry starts, his tone fatherly, and if Draco wasn’t currently so stricken, he’d be better able to appreciate this window into such a different part of his life.
, and knowing privately that he’d be right. The difference is, he’s not going to let it make them uncomfortable.
“Rather well,” she says. “Thank you for this. It was challenging to watch students return from the war so changed by the experience, as I’m sure you well know.” His hand is still in hers, but she pats it vaguely with her other in an uncharacteristically maternal gesture before dropping it. “It’s good to see you, you look well.”
not Harry and instead he sticks his entire head out the window like a nutter. He closes his eyes into the sun, head tilted to the side and hair falling into his eyes with the pull of gravity, and wishes he didn’t know English, couldn’t read a lick.
When Draco wakes, the first thing he registers is the terrible knot in his lower back, right where it’d sunk into the arm of his reading chair overnight. He sits up groggily and yawns, contorting to massage a thumb on the sore muscles while the events of the previous evening come back to him: Quietly eating dinner, working on his counter-curse, failing at his counter-curse, crawling into bed, then a knock at the door and an endearingly plastered Harry grinning at him, and thinking
“We certainly can’t tell him, it’ll just make things worse—Rosie, Uncle Harry is sleeping, we need quiet voices! Shhhh—he’s in a state as it is, and he’s going to want to take you to the Ministry today, which means it’s in both of your best interests to keep him on his game.”
He announces his address into the fireplace, not before taking one last mental picture of Harry standing there a bit dishevelled and more than a bit stunned into silence. He’s convinced that this will be the longest thirty-six hours of his life.
“Hi, slob,” Harry says. He closes the book and tosses it back on the bedside table, sliding back down in the bed. “Slept well?”
Ron stands so they do too, and they exchange a weird series of hugs goodbye as if they don’t see each other outside of work.
When Draco had first sucked Harry deeper into his matchmaking, it was over a quiet breakfast at the dining table in his flat. It had only been a few days since the case had closed, Lucrezia and Hadrian Bode locked away, Aurors finally done badgering him for testimony. Suddenly boringly jobless, he’d been tasked by Draco—who’d spent just as many days hearing how little direction he now felt his life had—with making a list of his interests. He'd thrown the balled-up parchment crossly towards the study about three minutes ago.
He falls into the seat opposite him, against the wall, with a tight nod and a file clutched closely to his chest. Malfoy’s cup is half empty, and the tail end of a croissant remains on his plate.
He pulls back slightly in response, for Draco’s sake, but leans his body forward, rocking the boat. His mouth opens, filling the air with a guttural, hissing language. It’s captivating—he hasn’t heard it in a long time, not this plainly since he called for a snake in second year, duelling the very man chatting with one across from him now. The water snake flicks its tongue, and Harry turns to Draco, proud to offer reassurance.
Harry cocks his head. The event is over, certainly. He’ll feel terrible if he keeps his overworked friends from a night off. Circe knows he has nothing better to go home to.
“Yes, yes, all fine. Erm, well, er, Ginny… she’s been on the lookout for me. For a job, actually. I never thought it would happen, but… something opened up as head of security for the national team. I interviewed two weeks ago and I—I’ve accepted.”
“I told the office I was handling consultancy business—I couldn’t wait another half-day to give you this.”
He knows full well that he won’t be finding Harry a gift right now—not with the intimidating precedent the man had set with his errands—and so he sets off on a personal trip to Slug & Jiggers. The bell chimes when he enters, and the shopkeeper, a cheerful waifish man named Hugh, offers him a familiar nod. He’s fairly used to Draco arriving with a list and going about his business. Far removed from his inventory, Draco tries to remember what he’s running low on and begins idly picking staples up off the shelves by the front.
Jack lunges first, instantly, thrusting his right leg out in an attempt at sweeping Draco’s, or at least to kick at his calf trying. Draco evades it easily with a chuckle that Harry matches from the bench. He’s sure they’re thinking the same thing—Jack’s fighting rashly, like Draco’s not going to be worth strategy.
He leaves Teddy with a tight hug and a promise to make plans in a week, feeling brighter, lighter, patient. Filled up. When he gets to Boggarts, Hermione will gasp at his hair and Luna will gush about his glow. None of it will implicate the level of loneliness seeping through his bones, poisoning him slowly.
, then we can get a drink and I’ll let you vent all you want.” He smiles kindly and Harry feels a rush of gratitude.
They come out upon a wide expanse of grey-blue river—the backwaters where the Vellar and Coleroon river systems collide—and in the distant tree line he can see the brink of Pichavaram, the mangrove forest. He dons his own life jacket and steps towards the water’s edge, a coast lined with moored boats and piers jutting out every few steps, and picks an attended one to trade his receipt for an oar. Harry watches him step unsteadily into the rowboat, then extend a hand up to him.
He sits up, dropping Draco’s hand and forcing him to adjust his position from where he’s laid slightly on top of him. “I don’t want your sympathy, I’m working the case, anyway. I’m worried for you and your mum, and I need to find out what Murray’s up to. I want your help, and you can give it tomorrow.”
He does, closing his eyes obediently and studying it a moment between their hands, then meets his gaze again.
Harry nods and sighs, gathering his strength. “Lastly, the Ministry curse case; it’s not been confirmed by my specialist yet, but it seems likely that the banquet and bookshop curses have the same original spellcaster, or at least are working for the same cause.”
Draco is amazed that a short fifteen minutes later there’s a teenage boy at their door with two medium pizzas, and with Harry’s direction on payment he answers the knock himself, opens the boxes on the dining table and leaves for the kitchen.
Ron rolls his eyes with a scoff. Hermione taps his hand and shakes her head before he can open his mouth, and Harry watches him visually unsour, popping the umbrella open and sticking it in Hermione’s curls.
“Selfish!” He swings up and crashes the legs into the floor. They splinter off in all directions, and Dante, who had been lurking, no doubt feeling his anger, skitters away.
Perhaps he’d been prodded there by the ridiculousness he’d discovered lay in holding a decade-old grudge, or perhaps his heart was just aching for the catharsis of a punching bag. Either way, at the door he pulled his earbuds out, gasping in exhausted breaths that made his chest rise and fall dramatically, and stared into the half-empty gym with something akin to homesickness.
“I was surprised to hear that you two were cordial,” she says as she walks them to the door. “But it’s a wonderful surprise.” One of her hands settles on each of their shoulders. “The two sides of my family, finally coming together!”
The sky is growing a frosty grey when they stop on the street to face a row of houses, and Harry looks up and pulls his coat tighter. He moves his feet as a sweeping gust of fallen leaves flies past his shoes on the pavement.
Ron doesn’t wait for an answer. With a final pat on the back, he gives him a friendly push towards the stage.
Harry shrugs. He needs a distraction, without discussing Draco at all. And he misses Ron. Seeing his friend solves both.
Jack glances around overdramatically, then leans in closer. His breath tickles Harry’s ear and he’s hyperaware of his own breathing.
He apparates directly outside Draco’s door, lets the crack of his arrival and his friend’s attentive hearing do the work and doesn’t knock. Instead, he stands with his hands in his pockets, hair still damp, and waits for the door to open.
Harry sits on the closed toilet. It’s almost laughable, how hard he’s working to purposefully keep his eyes trained on Draco’s. “I just wanted to say… I wanted you to know that I wish I’d acted faster yesterday, and I feel like I owe you an apology. It wasn’t very… Aurorly.”
Potter’s watching him nervously, as if anticipating whatever he chooses to say next, and so he decides to change the subject rather than dive deeper into whatever painful gay awkwardness they’d just walked into.
The facts, few as they are: the cursed objects aren’t from the same store or even manufactured in the same century, so their choice is controlled, precise. The silverware was, well, silver, and the book was gilt-edged. Maybe there’s something cursed at the material level, maybe something about precious metals?
Draco takes a deep breath. His voice is more robotic than he’d intended as he recites, “Yes. I’m so sorry. I don’t know what came over me. I was drunk. I wasn’t thinking.”
Draco looks up, eyes weary, but not negatively so. A look of cheerful exhaustion. He’s glad to see it.
“Amazing,” she sighs, closing her eyes and dropping her head back against the plush chair. It seems, to Harry, that her work never slows. He stopped questioning it a while ago. She gets defensive. He imagines it must be hard to draw the line and decline any cases when it’s all for the greater good.
He doesn’t know when it’d begun, truthfully. He just knew that the more he rejoined society, especially at his publisher’s or Hogwarts, it had benefited him to be a little self-deprecating around anyone who might already be judging him. Like, if they knew that he knew he was an arsehole, they’d accept him faster. After all, he had the same opinion as them; Draco Malfoy was a prick.
Just then, though, Jack somehow presses even closer, pinning Harry between the warmth of his body and the coldness of the metal lockers against his back. He remembers, with sudden lucidness, that the only thing between them is a couple layers of running shorts, and the next time Jack shifts forward as he presses into a kiss it’s no secret that he’s aroused. Harry, too, is only human.
To understand what synapses fire in Draco’s brain to turn what Harry obviously expects to be incendiary into the fondness he feels instead probably requires a Mind Healer, but when he thinks back and attempts to parse through it himself, he sees it like this:
“Mm, there’s a lot of great stuff up there,” she says, tilting her head thoughtfully, eyes scanning the frames.
Harry kicks off his socks and shoes then leans down, smiling softly to himself, to look at Draco. He startles when they make eye contact.
!” comes a call from the dining room. It catches Harry off guard in its casualness. He’s never much experienced Draco around his other friends. Not without being the one on the other end of their wands, that is.
She giggles when he pokes her playfully, while Hermione shares a meaningful look of weariness with Harry—he’s well-aware of the new ‘training Rose to stay in her toddler bed’ phase.
Draco chuckles good-naturedly, but he’s torn his gaze away, intensely focusing on his messy arithmancy as he fingers the corner of the parchment. He hopes his cheeks aren’t revealingly pink.
“I think you missed your calling as a private eye, Zabini,” he finally says in admission. “Or at least a fucking Secret Keeper at that.”
They stay low, on the outskirts of the pitch, slowly practising the careful art of lowering yourself into a fractional dive while spinning upside down. It’s hard, like rubbing your stomach and patting your head.
Malfoy hums lightly, a hand tipped to his mouth in thought. He pages through the file again, pausing on the medical report included by St. Mungo’s.
eyes, through Nagini’s eyes, and felt his anger—my subconscious loves to revisit that at night, by the way—but I’ve worked to distance myself from him and the fucking… the twin
“Shit,” he says, stopping suddenly in his tracks on the stoop. Quickly, he conjures his Patronus and sends it to Malfoy with an update, hoping he’s properly conveyed the urgency.
battling for his life… he should have been speaking to a Mind Healer, or at least Ginny. He’d shut himself off, instead, and only reemerged after a particularly tough conversation with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, ambushed during dinner, where they all spoke more candidly about their post-war issues than ever.
“Close your mouth, darling,” she says through tight lips. But it’s accompanied by warm, sparkling eyes that ease the cold. She sweeps past him into the hallway, eyes examining everything she can see from the threshold.
Harry pushes down the shadow of inferiority and embarrassment he feels to stand and watch rather than act himself. His job is to solve the case’s problems, and he solved this one by bringing someone much more adept to save a life, he reminds himself.
Draco watches him like he’s lost the plot. “You can’t still be hungry,” he questions, voice laced with incredulousness as he walks back from a booth with the Kachori.
For the second time in two days, he unexpectedly spots a familiar head. There, at the end of the bar, unaccompanied.
Harry sighs down at the table, then blinks in surprise when a glass of something appears in his line of sight. He hadn’t even seen Ron go to the bar, but he’d returned now with mead for the group.
“Ah,” Harry immediately lowers his gaze and drops the necklace onto the table, but doesn’t meet his eyes again. Draco stiffens accordingly, painfully fluent in Harry’s body language. “I… had a meeting with Murray today.”
Pansy wipes her eyes and Draco grips the base of his seat firmly to keep his cool, face frozen in a scary smile. He feels a bit like he had when he walked away from Potter on the lift—a moment from cursing the next person to breathe too loud—but this time he can’t run to his friends to calm him down.
“I’m really sorry, Harry, honestly. It’s hard to fall for unavailable men. I was head over heels for my own reserve Chaser for months, even after I met his boyfriend.”
Harry remembers, in his early years, a photo album with moving pictures of his parents being one of the few things to get him through his summers. “Of course,” he says. “I always appreciated having—“
Ginny plasters a big smile on her face without intimating that she’s heard a word from him, looking right past to the other end of the table. “Well! That’s enough on the Boy Who Lived, eh? Didn’t Wood do better today, Luna?”
Harry takes all three to the till, and while they’re being bagged up he spots the pale hair of their author near the back of the store. His stomach flutters at the surprise spotting, and he smiles his thanks to the cashier before walking deeper down the aisles with his books in tow. Draco doesn’t even look up when he enters the aisle, his nose deep into a textbook, and he startles when Harry speaks.
Harry’s hold on Draco’s shoulders is tightening, his eyes prickling. Finally, she picks up her wand and begins a spell with the book propped open in her left hand. When she lowers her wand, they all lean closer.
“Don’t worry about the papers, I’ll fix the papers. We need to get to St. Mungo’s.” Harry says the last bit to Ron, who’s moved closer and is levitating the lilies away from the rest.
He and Ron apparate into Hogsmeade, then begin the trek directly to the Quidditch pitch, and though they start alone, groups of students trickle in from either side of the path, until they’re just another pair in the giggling and chatting crowd all dressed in colours, prepared for the first game of the year.
One of his eyes is purple, stark against his pale skin, and there’s a thick cut across his temple. When he looks up and meets Harry’s eye, there’s only a tired resignation in them. “They’re not ‘supposed’ to arrest you with false evidence either,” he says dully. “But clearly anything goes once it’s on paper, so perhaps the arrest rules were too specific to hexes and not fists and boots.”
He tuts, standing and stretching his arms above his head, then nods towards the door. Harry pads after him towards the kitchen without a word. When he points to the dining table, the other man sits, and his lips quirk up in amusement at how expertly his wordless orders are followed.
“Good, feel it rise and fall. In. Out…” They sit for a few minutes more, Draco watching unblinkingly as the man’s jaw unclenches, his tight grip on Draco’s hand lightens, and his breathing becomes less deliberate. He lays with his eyes open, staring at the ceiling for another minute, then finally speaks.
“Harry and the other Aurors handled any interviews and questioning. I have access to the transcripts, but the only one remotely helpful so far was the first. Agnes Parker. Mostly because there were so many witnesses.”
The ride back up in the lift is possibly the most awkward two minutes of Harry’s life. He stands in the opposite corner from Malfoy in the tiny contraption like he has wrackspurts, risking an occasional glance.
Draco sighs, “How did you survive the war?” still holding his arm. It’s centimetres from the skull, close enough to send a memorable shiver down his spine. He wants to put distance between himself and the cursed object—is starting to think he needs distance between himself and Draco’s entire study for his own safety. Another part of him wants to challenge Draco’s touch aversion more. It’s nice to know it doesn’t extend past saving him from undue harm.
When they walk back through the house Draco is swept into another hug from Andromeda. There’s been an overwhelming increase in those since he became friends with Harry.
He purses his lips. “Most of the Aurors are very talented, the rest on my floo are schoolmates and family—definitely not up for consideration. I mean… motive? I don’t know, goose, I’ll keep reflecting but I think my best course of action is feeling for a trace at the Ministry.”
“Yes, he is!” Harry coos. He sets his box down on the floor, making ridiculous little clicking noises with his tongue on his top teeth as he kneels in front of Dante.
He doesn’t, though. He looks at the charm with a soft, thoughtful smile, a quirk of his head that turns into a nod, then kisses the top of Harry’s head. “I think I’ll leave this discovery out of the manuscript. Some things should just be for you.” He kicks off his trousers and pants and steps into the shower. “Are you joining?”
He’d woken in Draco’s bed, drooling on a pillow that wasn’t his with all the blankets kicked off him, too warm in the night. And beside him, a sleeping dragon; Draco, yes, looking lovely in his sleep, but that seemed to go without saying to Harry.
He knocks before he can overthink a greeting, so when Draco opens the door in piped navy and green pinstriped pyjamas with an open dressing gown, Harry says, “D’you
When Ron leaves again he falls back on the couch in a slump, letting himself react to the aches and pains that he’d sat rigidly through for the past half hour. His head is killing him, as is the introspection that he’d felt the need to look healthy and invulnerable to a man who’d been first on the scene to his underdressed personal emergency just yesterday.
He knows, beneath the adrenaline, that a dozen Ministry officials are already at Agnes’ side, but he can also see them hesitating to do anything. Hermione would likely refer to his current urge to join them as more of his ‘impulsive heroism.’
Sometimes, while Draco did work or showered after a training session, he’d pick it up and get through a dozen pages. He found himself even picking it up alone, in one hand while he kept a watchful eye on dinner, or curled up in bed.
“Maybe, but she’s scary about protocol. She’d take it seriously but get pissed off that you lied in your report.”
—sorry—Slytherin seems to have scored? Yes! They’ve gotten a Bludger, or no, a Quaffle… obviously… past Gryffindor Keeper Christina Ackerly. Bad luck, Christina.”
Harry smiles, full-toothed and lovely, and leans down slowly, capturing Draco’s lips in a relaxed, deep kiss that speaks volumes. He’s brought his hands forward to cup Draco’s cheeks, the torn page still in his right hand, and the edge of it tickles his ear.
“The rest will be in between all that,” he says, swinging his feet over the side of the bed and standing slowly. He hears Harry crawl after him, a step behind as he walks towards the dressing robe hanging from the back of the door.
to be something else, right? Because we couldn’t be nothing.” He holds Draco’s eyes intensely. “Right? We can’t be nothing.”
Harry had said once with his hands on Draco in their makeshift boxing studio. Now Draco holds him there. Pulls him closer. Kisses deeper.
“Feeling for one cursed book was an emergency, but I can’t sit around all day doing the Ministry’s job. They have the tonics.”
“Oh yes. So Georgia firecalls her sister and says ‘I can’t come, there’s hell to pay and turns up at the studio just after
Magnus Murray has been Head Auror for as long as Harry and Ron have been in the department, and he’s been gunning for Head of all Magical Law Enforcement just as long. As it was, this left him often cantankerous, distracted, trigger-happy.
Hermione looks nervous but Draco just raises his hands in surrender. “No, Merlin, me too. But I hated him
Hermione returns alone. She walks right up to her husband, stopping to card her hands fussily through his hair before tracing them down his robes and adjusting the lapel, leaving them placed on his chest.
“Maybe you’re perfectly calm inside,” Harry continues, “but my mind has been running wild for an entire week now. Like, what are we? What happens next? Who do we tell?” His face is pinched with seriousness, though they’re both swinging their arms back and forth and rolling their necks with comparative triviality.
When his year of probation ended, taking with it his best excuse for solitude, not much changed. The press was relentless. They couldn’t physically get to him at the Manor and they didn’t dare try in London—the Malfoy name was still infamous for the time being—but it didn’t stop them from printing editorials and exposés on anyone with a toe in Dark magic.
“Brill!” She squealed and shook her boyfriend’s arm in celebration. He gave Harry a quick nod. “Thanks so much!”
had been too busy disparaging the Potters for blood treachery to mention that his ancestor had been responsible for the predecessors to Skele-Gro and Pepperup potions.
It was relieving but brief, and they lapse again. Harry watches condensation race down his glass of water.
“Dinner. ‘Mione and I can’t, and she was just going to get food into her hotel room, and I said ‘Hey, you know who probably has no plans—‘“
Here he is, frustrated in front of others by the very thing that frustrates him in private: the fact that he’s thus far been unable to put into clear words what it feels like to be around Draco, without the aid of old science fiction stories or rambling sentences that go nowhere.
He cried for a few more minutes, indulging himself in the luxury he hadn’t had as a child, or as the Golden Boy: The freedom to just
against the wall roughly. His eyes widened, a small thrill of nervousness running down his spine. He trusted Harry, yes, but this was… New. And more than a bit unsettling.
He fingered the small vial of potion he held as he walked out of his private lab and back to his rooms. ‘I could just pretend that I couldn’t make it work. No one really needs to know.’ He dismissed the thought almost immediately.
home! There's Moonrun Manor, in France, as well as two smaller chateaus, either of which could have suited our needs, for
Blaise’s face softened at the harshness of Draco’s voice, and he wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders. “It’s alright, don’t talk until we see Pomfrey, okay? And I’ll stay with you until Mum gets back.”
Harry chuckled, adding a third finger and stretching Draco carefully. “I’ll be gentle, but keep relaxed, okay?” He asked.
‘If it works, Draco is going to hate me.’ Severus sighed as he began cleaning, thinking of the grave disservice he was doing his Godson in continuing his research.
Draco smiled. “It’s called terrazzo. The parlours and most other rooms are carpeted, of course, but here, it's all stone. It’s the same in the dining room and the ballroom. Be careful not to fall here.”
The walls were shimmering with wards and protective spells, and the chairs and couches were spelled to resist stains, as well as to conform to the comfort level of each person sitting on them. The fire was burning already, and a small set of French doors were covered by curtains.
Harry chuckled, pulling out and pushing back in, slowly, savoring the sensation of finally being inside his mate. He groaned as Draco’s hands grabbed his ass, pulling him close and letting him move only enough to pull out halfway before he was forced back into Draco’s body. “Mm, you feel so good wrapped around me. So tight.” He whispered, then nibbled on Draco’s earlobe, drawing it into his mouth to suck on it as he continued his slow thrusts, feeling Draco’s hips moving to meet each one.
They headed down the hallway a little more and came out into a huge room with an in-ground pool—impressively, it was Olympic-sized—and a large hot tub.
silk, and it was like sinking into a cloud. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. “Oh, I like this room.” He said happily.
!" He screeched as the thick dildo penetrated him. He screwed his eyes shut and hissed though his teeth, the sound becoming a moan of pleasure as the dildo stretched him.
Severus’ lips tightened. “I am totally sure. This potion is tailored specifically to both sets of DNA in your body, designed to meld them back into one, rather than just change your physical body back to its original state.”
The epilogue will be up in just seconds, it is short and sweet, but I felt it was the perfect note to end on, and it has been unchanged for the last 6 years, waiting to be posted.
Harry gulped as Severus held out the vial to him. “So, if I take it, no more children?” He asked softly.
Draco grabbed his bag and Harry’s. “I’m carrying your things, you look dead on your feet. Come on, let’s get to class.”
Harry shivered, moaning softly as Draco’s hands smoothed over his shoulders, pressing lightly, easing the minute tensions he had gained back after the relaxing bath last night.
Draco reached around and closed his hand around Harry’s cock, stroking him slowly. “So hot, so tight.” He breathed, then nipped Harry's earlobe before sucking it into his mouth for a moment. “So
Harry giggled at the ticklish sensation, and then panted, still smiling happily when Draco pulled away.
Draco huffed and shoved the sponge and his body wash into Harry’s hands, turning around. “Shut up and wash me.” He said, failing to mask the amusement in his voice. “Once we get this done, we get to wander the halls of Hogwarts naked.” He said in an excited tone. “How often does one get
Draco just brushed off most of the remarks with a simple: "Well, at least I'm getting a beautiful partner in my bed every night. Even more, she's Bonded to me now." He finished softly, raising Harry's hand to his lips and kissing it.
Hermione flushed at his question and Harry laughed. “That’s a bit of a sensitive topic. Can I answer that later? In private, perhaps?”
Draco sobbed as Harry pulled his tongue out of Draco's arse just when the blond thought he was going to come, Harry's hand around his cock notwithstanding.
Harry chuckled. “All right, no need to get bitchy.” He said, positioning himself and gently pushing in.
“They say I can’t bring you along, since boys at baby showers are bad luck!” Harry pouted. “What do they think having
Harry helped Draco out of his tuxedo, dropping it piece by piece on the floor. His hands were clumsy and trembling, but Draco found that, paired with his blush and the way he was biting his lip, endearing. Harry was nervous, but he was sure in why he was doing this.
Draco nodded, wrapping his arms around her waist and pressing against her back. “It will. I will do most of it, but if you want to help, either once you’ve had Carina or before, I will have no problems with that. Just as long as you make sure not to overexert yourself.” He added firmly.
Draco paled. Shit. “Harry, I think I know what this is. The bond can allow the incubus to Apparate to their mate’s side no matter what is in the way if they are separated for too long. We can’t sleep alone anymore.”
Harry closed his eyes and hung his head. “I don’t need it.” He said carefully. “Not yet.” He denied.
Draco flushed and headed for the library, only to find Blaise already there, an open book on Vanteera in front of him. “You’re allergic to salt.” He said, barely glancing up as Draco entered.
Hermione shared a grin with Celeste and both got up. “Well, if you’re not going to be here, I don’t exactly need to stick around anymore. I’ll find Ron.” She said, leaving Celeste and Draco at the door.
Harry shrugged. “When we move on to the combat aspect of using elemental magic, he needs someone strong to be casting curses at him so he can work on repelling them.” He explained.
Draco smirked. "I added rose hips just before the lacewing flies. It stabilized it and allowed me to add the other ingredients in quicker succession." He cocked his head. "I believe it will also help the unpleasant flavour."
Harry drew back the covers. “Come on. I’ll be careful. It’s time.” He said gently, all playfulness gone.
Harry snorted, leaning back in his chair. “Never helped me. I just find out what I have to do, then do whatever needs done to make it happen. Works out for the best, because what works for one might not work for another. You have to learn your own way.”
“Wrong answer.” Draco snapped, turning back to the desk and picking up the quill again. “No sex tonight.”
Draco chuckled. “I don’t blame you. Now, I’ll show you the wing we will be staying in. The elves should have at least the Master bedroom cleaned by now.” He said, leading her out of the room and back to the entryway of the house, where the stairs were located. They went up the stairs and took a left, heading down a hall interspersed with doors. The Master bedroom was the third to last door in the hall, and Celeste felt the tingle of the powerful Wards as they passed through them.
him in the next battle, not against him. He’s not useless, really. And you have to admit, he’s good-looking.”
.” Harry said softly. He looked up at Draco, his lower lip trembling slightly. “But, Draco, I always wanted to be able to go home after the year and see my parents, and get to know their friends. All the other students got to go home with families that loved them, and mine-“ His voice broke, and he began sobbing.
Harry sighed and wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling the blond onto his lap to kiss him gently, running a hand through his hair.
Draco watched in interest as the contents got smoother and creamier, and when it was thick and creamy, Harry took a large sip, moaning and leaving a pink smear on his upper lip that he licked off.
Severus snarled. He had just wasted seven galleons' worth of rose hips, and still the altered Polyjuice base, when tested, proved to contain fatal amounts of toxins. He'd need to add even more to speed the process enough.
Draco looked shell-shocked, but after the mighty strop Harry had gone into two days ago, he knew better than to argue. “Alright, be right back.” He said, then left for the kitchens.
.” Draco remarked, his eyes taking in the smooth chest and flat abs, well-muscled legs and arms, golden-hued skin and all without a single hair to be seen. “Have you lost
Breakfast was horrible. He tried to eat the waffles that were sitting in his place, but he could taste every ingredient clearly, and the final result was… Unpleasant, to say the least.
“That works.” Draco said. “Now, Skittle, you will shadow Tissy as she cleans the Master suite, nursery, and Heir’s bedroom. Then you will take over that wing, and clean the rest of it. That area will be your main duty, but near mealtimes, you will join the others in the kitchen and help them cook. Minsy, there is to be a baby.”
He takes his hands off his eyes, but won’t look Draco’s way. There’s nothing to busy his hands with, so he pulls at a loose thread on his jumper.
Harry smiles softly. It’s enthralling as ever, these two Dracos. Increasingly, he feels like he’s not imagining that the second Draco, his favourite Draco, has been more flustered lately. He wants to speak to it but senses, as they both have before, that it’s a moment for silent companionship, so he pulls his book out and open, flattening the dog ear.
“Here’s the thing, Harry—you told us when you were becoming friends. We watched it happen, and we saw it getting more serious, and I don’t know exactly when…
Draco twists on the ball of his left foot, and before he’s prepared to swing his hips with it, they’ve already snapped quickly into position and his foot hits the bag harder than ever. It happens incomprehensibly fast.
Harry catches the Snitch the first time, again the second (much slower, purposefully), but Teddy calls him out on it and demands he play his best. The third time it’s genuinely close—still Harry’s, but close—and they land again happy and tired.
Ron looks up at his wife. “I’m going to try to put him into one of those slowing spells the Quidditch healers use,” then to Harry, “Do you have a first aid kit?”
She chews the inside of her lip but looks between the two of them, and like a switch has gone off, Harry’s in her graces again. “Then I’m officially glad he has someone like you, too.”
They finish the movie like that, Harry barely keeping his eyes open through the rhythmic rise and fall as Draco breathes. When Humphrey Bogart convinces Ingrid Bergman to get on a plane and leave him behind and the credits roll, Draco speaks again and jostles Harry from the twilight between sleep and wakefulness. His chest vibrates under Harry’s head as he talks.
“Sir, I’d like to make a request. While we’re all here, I wanted to ask after everyone’s availability, perhaps for backup, maybe undercover reconnaissance. I’d like to set a few Aurors up at Knockturn Alley, see if anyone’s talking about the curses.”
He pops up and kisses Draco’s cheek before moving back to the dresser, where he must’ve been deciding what to wear before he distracted himself with an empty drawer. Draco could tell him right now, he’d choose jeans and a polo, probably that blue and green striped one he loves. He leans back on his arms and watches, head tilted.
He sucks in a breath and reaches out above his heart. Draco’s skin is cold, more than usual, and when there’s no adverse reaction, he hooks his armpits and pulls his head and shoulders up into his lap. With a hitched breath, he brushes his hair back and adjusts his boxers on his hips as though these are important things, helpful things.
It’s nice to be home, or in Harry’s home, even if he has no clue what they do now, as a ‘them’. He’s spent a week hoping he didn’t ruin things.
He can’t speak for Harry—they separate to their tables—but Pansy and Blaise are carrying on inside as if they haven’t wondered over his preoccupation for even a moment. In fact, they’d ordered a basket of chips and are halfway through it before he’s returned. He rejoins the conversation easily, receiving at most a studied look from Blaise, and doesn’t stop thinking of Harry. If there’s a change in his demeanour, his friends don’t mention it.
. I don’t have to tell you, though.” Harry’s looking just past Draco, expression grim and jaw tight. He’s suddenly older and sadder. It’s that war look. Draco knows it well.
,” he says then, all the thanks tangible in his tone. He cups Draco’s cheek upside down. “Can you hear me? We’re going to St. Mungo’s.” Draco nods, ever-so-slightly.
Harry laughs, and it feels good. A real one, light and entertained, momentarily unburdened, though he knows what he has to do and he can feel those nerves waiting to settle back in. She’s always been able to find a laugh in him.
He holds his arms up, as if the spatula Harry’s pointed at him is a real threat. “Sorry, wasn’t trying to interrupt the concert. Didn’t take you for an Agathe Selene man.”
“Quick writing lesson for you,” Harry says breathlessly at the foot of the bed, his hands fussing with Draco’s belt. “
“I didn’t know it was required to run through the five W’s and an H every time you’ve asked a question.”
Harry beats him to it, surprisingly. “Thank you,” he says, finally walking closer. “Thank you for understanding. I knew you would.”
. “She wasn’t the only one calling for a conviction like that, I don’t find it personal. But it seemed like a coincidence. Until I mentioned Leonard Erickson.”
His quill hovers over the parchment, trying to decide how to tactfully respond. Orsix nips impatiently at his sleeve, and he absently reaches into a jar by his pens and offers a snack.
Draco adjusts a little under him, then settles a hand back on his shoulder. “Honestly, I imagined you already talk to Andromeda Tonks about that. About Sirius.”
“Draco showed me how to dodge Bludgers. I’ve been practising but I still can’t figure out how to do it while moving.”
He’s terribly unproductive, though—he stares at the new curse files for hours with no clue how to proceed, and eventually surrenders to the clerical work piling up in his inbox instead. On top of it all, Ron, despite mentioning nothing out of sort when he popped by Harry’s office that morning, is mysteriously absent by midmorning.
“I’m no academic, but I’d figured that much out when you pushed me into your bedroom like-like a dog your landlord doesn’t know about.”
And then, after that thought fills him with embarrassment and shame and the desire to remain invulnerable, to never share anything again, not even through implication, he circles back around to his hands on Harry’s chest, whispering words of encouragement in his ear, imagining the fate that awaits him if he kills Harry Potter, imagining what it would be like to be Harry Potter—to need this coaching more than Draco does, to enter the horrors of war without the desensitisation and cold upbringing he’d had. Like being ripped out of a warm hug.
Ron regards Harry carefully while Hermione slowly gets Rose out the door, and when it’s just the two of them again, Harry collapses backwards onto the sofa, throws his forearm across his eyes, and speaks to his best friend with urgent authenticity.
Considering he hadn’t known he’d choose to walk home until he’d hugged Hermione goodbye, the concept that someone else had correctly predicted this too and sat on his stoop waiting was shocking. He stops right before his first step, head tilted with a curious smile at the seated figure.
He’s grinning like a cat. Draco’s reaching for any instance where he’s seen him quite like this. None come to mind. A new side of Harry is an intoxicating possibility.
It leads him to scrutinise her appearance, too. She’s dressed nicely considering he’s only invited her to his house, in a knee-length navy blue dress with her hair pulled back, just the front tendrils loose. He’s not one to talk, though—he tried on four shirts before this one.
She pries the book from his hands and sets it down between them, leaning against the back of the couch to face him more. “That friendship is going well?”
Harry transfigures a box to hold the cursed book and begins fitting a lid for safe transport, when Malfoy sneers, “It’s a date,” voice dripping with sarcasm. “Alert the press.”
Outside Marinella’s office he has to hold in a gasp, surprised by her sudden appearance. He’d had his back to it, tracing a cluster of vacant Junior Auror desks, and when he turned she was brushing right past him, dressed in Muggle clothes and heading back out of the office with a file under her arm. It takes a moment for his heart rate to settle again, and when she’s gone he finally finishes crossing the office to Yolanda’s desk. He reaches a hand out.
, and he’s never seen him this in tune with his physicality. The fast-twitch reflex, like the thoughtful striking of a rattlesnake, was a complete dialectic to his usual languid elegance.
Being subjected to Malfoy’s death stare wasn’t for nothing, then, if he’d had a few moments of serene speech forgetfulness. He glances back towards where the man had been standing but finds the corner empty once again. He lifts his chin, peering over the throngs of people, trying to catch a glimpse of where he’d gone.
“You’re just too picky,” Blaise says. “Always have been,” but then his eyes spark up in enlightenment. “I’ve got it. The next person to walk by is
His heart’s been dropping more by the minute, but now, hand tugging on his left sleeve, he’s dazed by his lack of foresight; they hadn’t bought a single long-sleeve shirt, the greatest solace training at Harry’s had to offer.
He returns with a small bottle, which he offers up. Harry takes it, investigating the small, blue-glassed concoction. “Is this for you?”
He’s absolutely fuming. If there’s steam coming from his ears, he wouldn’t be able to hear it over the hammering of his heart, still bursting with adrenaline. He’s so
He’d left the moment his legs seemed to work again, a bit astonished and bowled over, but Draco was long gone, no doubt disapparated. And his brain had been completely empty the entire walk home, like the water receding before a tsunami, until he fell into bed and the reflections crashed down. The first four thoughts were simple enough:
Ginny moves closer, speaking low in the mixed company of the pub. “Is it classified that you’re working with an ex-Death Eater on curses?”
“But done now,” Harry sighs, sitting up. He takes the notes from Draco’s grip as he stands. “Did I leave these out?”
Soon after, they’re leaving their empty plates and mugs in the basin placed to the right of the counter, Harry briefly flashing a smile at the barista when she waves goodbye, and for a moment he gets a wild hair and wonders what would happen if he simply left a croissant and a coffee on Draco’s doorstep.
Pansy stands in front of the India photos for a while in a contemplative stance like she’s in a museum, then announces that she loves them. Multiple times while sitting on his couch, she glances back there again.
The final punch hits Harry straight in the jaw, gloved knuckles carving into his chin. It whips his head back and sends a bolt of pain up his cheekbone that he’s sure will turn to a headache. His jaw and ear already throb, the left side of his ribcage still aching mercilessly from an earlier hit, and salty sweat stings as it meets his eye.
“I can almost pull the top of this into a sprout on your head,” he remembers Draco saying during their lazy morning just two days ago. He’d wrapped his fingers around the crown of Harry’s head and gathered the curls up, managing to keep most of them held together.
news is, I don’t think the curser expected me to figure that out and open the book.” He flips it open, fans the pages for him across the shield. “Some of these pages were bookmarked once, you can still see the folds on the corners, and the bridge is broken. It’s first edition. Whoever is doing this… knows my work.”
“Oh my god, never mind.” Harry regards him with affectionate exasperation. “We’ll start communicating better tomorrow.”
“Murray does do a lot of favours,” he suggests when he stops at Ron’s desk with some budget reports a while later. “People know what it does to kiss his arse now and then.”
Without warning, Teddy flies high and dives, further and faster than Draco’s told him to. He shouts after him to pull up, tucking quickly into his own dive and watches him begin to slow, but it won’t be in time.
you are,” he argues. “What can you possibly think to accomplish in a crowded department in the late afternoon?”
His first instinct is that Harry is very inarticulately ending things with him. But he’s standing awfully close and Draco’s leaned against the stone of the building and they both must know he has nowhere to go but further against the brick.
All day, he’s been unnecessarily busying his hands to keep his mind occupied, which is probably the only reason he’s stooped to applying dittany to his left forearm despite its futility, as if a minor dressing Madam Pomfrey would treat a second year’s stinging hex with might have any effect on the puffy red skull and snake that appears there. He would never admit out loud that occasionally he hopes for a miracle.
Harry finally says what they’ve both been thinking all day into Draco’s skin. “It was for me,” he whispers. “It was for me. It should’ve been me.”
Harry clenches his jaw, directing his attention to Lucrezia but focusing internally. He needs a plan. Mari can’t be his entire plan.
Standing, as it often does, betrayed just how tipsy he was. They said their goodbyes briefly, and soon enough he’s weaving towards the front of the pub and out into the cooling summer night. The noise of the bar is almost completely muted, like he’s thrown a pillow over his ears, and he can finally hear himself think again.
Harry doesn’t mention that he’d hardly call Murray a busy man—he’s too tired but also still too grateful for her quick thinking. ‘
She crosses to the built-in shelves surrounding the hearth, her back to Harry. “So you’ve been reading more, Draco’s recommendations?”
Draco touches his Auror robes with his free hand. “I know.” Then he’s turning and walking towards the till. Harry follows quickly.
“I’m terribly sorry, Mother, but I must be going,” he says, returning to the table. It’s impressive how quickly his tone can steady out, pitch lower, to hide the quiver in his throat, just as he used to. Like riding a broom.
told me was that Sirius Black—a man who helped Voldemort in the first war—escaped Azkaban and the sentence he’d received for killing Muggles, and was looking to make you next. At thirteen, taunting you to go after him, well…”
Their first time’s behind them and with it Draco’s introductory insecurities, his wonders of how Harry will act and sound and feel. In its place lays a raw desire and their unstoppable impatience, the euphoria of reconnection.
Harry and Teddy both turn to him, so he hesitantly steps further into the room. The nine-year-old walks confidently up to him.
“It was a skin-stretching curse, sir, wasn’t it?” Harry’s head tilts innocently. “Those can’t be cast. They’re brewed and applied to an object. Over days.”
“It’d be so much easier to show you, but there’s—sometimes—I’ve noticed that you don’t like when we touch… on occasion. So with the whole gay thing… I just want to make sure it’s not—you wouldn’t be uncomfortable if I—just to coach you.”
His decision, inexpertly, was to avoid Blaise until the feeling faded, which had resulted in awkward study sessions and working much harder than usual to eat outside his normal mealtimes. He sped to Pansy’s side when partners were needed in potions, inadvertently inciting rumours about
Ginny looks very excited to see him, and not a moment of the interaction insinuates that they’re an ex and current partner to the same man. He meets George’s wife, or rather re-meets, because somehow Harry had never mentioned it was Angelina Johnson. They’re equally surprised to see each other, and the greetings are short but nice enough. It seems, as Draco moves through the house, his invite in itself is enough a sign of approval to be warmly welcomed.
He checks the salmon on the centre rack and adjusts a little egg timer before reaching into a cabinet for two glasses and a corkscrew. He sets them on the dining room table as he works to pull the cork out.
To his surprise, Harry breathes a laugh. “Yeah, I suppose. Is this who we are now? Talking about handsome men?”
Harry shakes his head, shirt buttoned up and regressing too quickly into his London persona. Still, there’s a determined curve upward of his lips as he says, “No need for last words when you’ll be back.”
“He’s not here. Murray. I requested him, but he’s out and likely won’t bother, so… you won’t see him.”
Ron is in agreement, clearly. Arms free from Rose, he throws his hands to his heart dramatically as if he’s been shot with an arrow, hanging his head. Rose is giggling, but his wife rolls her eyes and noncommittally says something about him being ‘too much.’
It doesn’t help that his own research beckons enticingly when he sits down to work. Initially, he avoided it rather well, despite the momentum he’d had working through a new counter-curse before the banquet. But when the case files inevitably leave him too frustrated to focus, he turns his attention back to his cursed objects—just for a few hours, to remember what productivity feels like.
“Do me and yourself a favour and keep your mouth shut when we pass Murray,” Harry instructs when they stop at the door, praying he’ll get no backchat.
Harry sighs, twisting away. The agreeable, flexible Malfoy is always the fluke, and here, snapping at him in compensation for a brief period of friendly conversation, is the Malfoy he knows and lo—
“It’s just you and me here. Let your…” He searches for a connection, for words. Draco loves words. “You know, put… your soft animal in charge, or whatever.”
“Not unless you’ve begun a new habit of calling yourself by your media-bestowed titles. Or clicking your tongue like a mother hen.”
The crowd cheers exuberantly, and Ginny must shout to be heard. “Shit, got to go!” she yells. “Neville saved you seats! Drinks after?” She leaves without an answer, bolting quickly towards the middle of the field.
“Alright, Harry?” Ron mutters the next time conversation turns without him. “Looking a little grim.”
Harry’s not offended. For one, it’s part of their pact moving forward to spend more time apart, in an effort to pad the transition from friends to more-than. But, on top of this, he’d had an idea, perhaps his most brilliant in recent history, that would require significant planning away from Draco’s prying eyes.
“You could’ve gone around the outside, darling,” she sighs, but she crouches amiably to lift one of them when the metalwork catches on the threshold.
Seamus Finnigan, teeth flashing, saunters over with a half-drunk tumbler in his grip and claps Harry solidly on the shoulder. He winces, but looks up and laughs bitterly.
The rest of dinner went easily enough. There wasn’t much Harry could say that didn’t receive a pejorative hum from Narcissa—(“Actually, Mrs Malfoy, I left the Auror Department at the beginning of November, I reckoned you’d seen it in the papers.” “I did see the papers, I suppose I
She leans back towards him, too. Conspiratorially. “You’re just about the millionth person to say so.”
“Hold on,” Blaise interjects loudly. “I’m very sorry that this turned out this way. Obviously, you really care for him, up-bup-bup—” He holds up a finger when Draco opens his mouth. “But you need to calm down, mate, or you’ll do something daft again. Just wait. Give him time. Follow his lead. Be cool.”
“I think it was inevitable. We were breathing down each other’s necks and… I should’ve trusted you more. I’m so sorry.”
“There’s only one poison-based curse that brews for two months. Ironically or poetically, it was henbane—that’s the specific strain—which was used by Muggles to replicate what they thought wizardry and flying would feel like in the Colonies. Hallucinations, delirium, a lack of coordination, and in
“Looking right professional in those robes,” Ron grins. “Not gonna spike your hair up like Hooch, are ya?”
“I like the way you say it,” Draco remarks when Harry doesn’t say anything, staring out onto the street. “Draco. But you say it
“Finish your row when I’ve left, or speak louder if my name’s in your mouth,” Pansy purrs, standing with her arms crossed by the door.
Harry lowers himself leisurely like a push-up and kisses him slow. “That you have a heartbeat or that I love you?”
They enjoy their separate evenings until he’s washing his hands in the gents a while later. The door swings open and Draco keeps his eyes down politely until he realises the newcomer is standing just behind him to his right. He looks into the mirror and meets Harry’s eyes.
The upstairs looks different with the lights on. It’s the Bode home, judging by the photos hung about, as it was last occupied years ago. Lucrezia and Hadrian have both been revived and bound, and Mari directs Harry and Draco into a separate room, away from their sight, for privacy.
By Tuesday he’s managed to work himself into a frenzy over whether he should still slip out after his afternoon department meeting to work in the study. It seems like overkill to send an owl considering Draco hadn’t even said he was mad, and Harry doesn’t want to look obsessive. Because he isn’t. But is worrying that something would seem overkill proof that it was? He shouldn’t send an owl, he decides.
So despite a mounting contempt for the job when he’s at his desk, he’s been trying to put his Auror training to work on it. The irony doesn’t escape him. On Monday, he lets his memos pile up while he sits scrawling out a list of occurrences, hoping to see a pattern:
Harry seems to forget to blink, staring back with wide, emerald eyes, stuck somewhere between surprise and awe. “Ye-yes,” he says, voice hardly above a whisper, “It’s not important—who we love,” and with his words the tension leaves Draco’s body. Harry’s own stiff hold on the counter behind him releases as his shoulders drop. The look he gives Draco is one of more relief than he’s ever seen on him.
“I’ll take the case, Harry,” Hermione offers in response, a familiar determination in her tone. She holds his gaze fiercely and with love. “It’s not my expertise. Maybe Blaise and I can work together—I’d be happy to collaborate—but they need more proof that Draco’s involved than a lack of alibi. We can start by appealing for release until a trial, okay? The judge’s office will be open tomorrow.”
“Nothing gets past you, does it?” he says, pointing his soup spoon in Draco’s face. “The Dursley’s sort of ignored that. They hated my dad, so they hated everything about me that reminded them of him; my hair, my skin, my… everything. If they could’ve kept my eyeballs and sent the rest packing, they would’ve.” He notes Draco’s suddenly appalled expression and recites automatically, “I have my mother’s eyes.”
Still, he doesn’t expect to be thrust into the winter season as disconcertingly fast as he is when he emerges from his bedroom dressed to find Harry curled up on the reading chair. He looks up from a book, something crossing his face, and says, “Would you like to go Christmas shopping with me?”
Draco sits up straighter. He wants to reach out and place a hand over those fingers, stop their nervous tapping, and with it settle his own guilt. He’s been pushing Blaise away, and in the orbit (as Harry would call it) of his new obsession, he hadn’t seen how it affected the other man. He deserves more than Draco’s been offering.
He’d spent a lot of energy in school detesting Harry Potter. It had been like a full-time job, and now, watching the man buy him a drink and laugh, feeling more like a stranger than an old enemy, makes him think that he’d had to expend so much brainpower on hating him because it comes so naturally not to. It was something he had to fight.
Though he lets them in and walks straight to the dining table with the takeaway, Harry stills outside the study.
She quiets at the interruption and looks down at his hands hesitantly. In a moment, she’s charmed them clean.
Harry continues as if he hasn’t heard him. “I went home and changed and found this book from Ron, which reminded me just how drunk I’d been last night, and I thought ‘oh god, I showed up at Draco’s, three sheets to the wind, slept in his
“Two things I know how to do,” he reminds. Clearly, their priorities are in different places, or Harry doesn’t realise just how okay he feels.
“C’mon, Ron, your head’s not that big. Nothing wrong with shedding the Auror exterior for a little lunch break.”
“Draco got too busy for us,” Blaise teases, shutting the door. He pokes his head into the study, sees Dante in the chair and crouches in front of him.
There was an image of yin and yang Harry knew of—sunlight playing over a mountain and valley, the light and the dark faces transmuting over time, trading places, revealing what had been concealed, and concealing what had been previously apparent.
“I—I need a minute. I need to be alone,” he mumbles, trying to give Ron an apologetic glance. He’s too emotionless for it to succeed, though.
Harry glares around their side of the table at him. “No, this is a key to Draco’s own place—well, not-not the flat, I—it’s a cabin. Outside Rydal. The Lakes. I reckoned for writing retreats, getting away when you need a change of pace… do you… like it?”
The feeling the parcel left in his chest hits again at Harry’s prompting, sickening in recollection, sending his gut lurching. He remembers the hint of bitterness. The way he could almost taste metallic traces of blood in his mouth, alongside something
“I hear you, I hear you,” he sighs. “I wasn’t doing nothing. I was so helpful.” For a brief moment, he meets Draco’s gaze, but then he scans the bathroom with a frown. “They really needed
“I could get used to this,” says Harry after a bit, kicking Draco a little as he stretches far to set his plate and mug down. “Your bed is nice.”
Harry laughs. “She’s the one who told me to knock on your door. She—actually, I should tell you this, she knows more than Ron and Hermione. She knows a week or so ago I was absolutely lost thanks to you at the pub, and that I was coming to confront you when I said goodnight to her.”
“Where are they?” Draco’s face is lit with excitement, more awake than he’s looked since Harry arrived. “And how soon can I have them?”
“You’re hard to argue with.” Draco smiles. “And you’re right, the juxtaposition with the later chapters will be good. It matters greatly to me that this isn’t seen as some… condemnation of Dark magic. Nor an appraisal. Light magic is just as powerful.”
He breaths in and out deeply through his nose, lifting his left arm to let Harry shift out from under him. The loss of warm skin is painfully present as he turns his head the other way and watches Harry walk to the bathroom. He lingers for a minute longer, listening to the water run, before stretching and pulling on his pants.
“It was sitting here, so I thought I’d have a look. Someday soon I’m going to read the same line a hundredth time and notice something. You haven’t found the curse—“
And yet, there’s a surprising bright spot in his wretched work week: Each afternoon, from the day he compiled his files, he would gather his lists and ball himself up in Draco’s reading chair, originally under the pretence that he ‘might have questions’, but eventually in the honest enjoyment of quiet companionship, though neither would announce such a thing aloud.
Harry scoffs as though personally offended, an endearingly empathetic response that sends Draco’s heart fluttering.
Draco crosses by the fountain, then crouches and sits beside him, smirking at his confused expression. “I’ve never seen someone stare at flowers with such concentration,” Draco clarifies. “Thought you might need an explanation.”
And no, you can’t easily waltz to 'The Way You Look Tonight' by Frank Sinatra… Draco probably pulled him into a foxtrot. Do I think Harry’s fluent enough in ballroom dance to know that? Unlikely.
Unfortunately, the information available ends there. He doesn’t know whether Agnes was targeted or had bad luck; the tables were assigned, but not the seats. Her background check was clean. She’d gone to Hogwarts a decade before Harry, then worked her way up through the judicial department. She was lovely, unproblematic, and liked by all.
’, so he can only imagine how strong that feeling comes for Ron and Hermione. How was he supposed to bother them with romantic drama when they’re raising a human being? He tells Ron this, as best he can, and he’s shaking his head before he’s even finished.
He’s bouncing his leg, staring at the centre of the pitch, which would have been a perfect place to look if the Gryffindor Seeker wasn’t diving for the Snitch by the Slytherin goal hoops. Even Davy has wised up to the action and has a flash of immaculate reporting.
He smiles coldly in spite of himself, shaking his head at her blatant ‘end of conversation’ tone. “it’s fine, Mum.”
He snaps to Harry’s gaze, then, and there’s a tangible buzz between them. One Harry’s only felt a few times, when he’s been provokingly audacious. As fast as the courage to speak so rashly bubbles up it fizzles away, thinking of every time Draco has shied from his touch, incapable of imagining that same man in the extended contact necessary for mixed martial arts. It’s a shame, really. Three five-minute rounds might just get out seven years of animosity.
“Thank Circe you side-alonged me,” he replies reflectively, smiling. “I couldn’t even remember what St. Mungo’s looked like.”
Harry works hard to keep most of the shock of this news off his face. It appears, he hopes, like a slow and careful nod of understanding. Draco Malfoy, a married man. “Wow.”
“Of course. Mayakar thrived after the secrecy, and the Potters’ shop was a great reason. Did you know—Ashok Potter used to open early every Saturday to give free healing supplies to those in need? And his wife did minor healing without asking for anything. If you needed help, the Potters would give it.”
It would be smart, he thinks groggily, to spend the day apart, like normal couples who have hardly been dating a week. And while calling them a ‘normal couple’ would be inaccurate, in Draco’s continued striving to be the best version of a partner he’s ever wished to be, ‘normal couple’ is his best point of reference.
Harry tries to flatten it down, without knowing just what he’s fixing. He hasn’t so much as looked in a mirror. “Well good, because it’s unavoidable.”
“No one ever tells you what to do when your curse-breaker’s been cursed,” Harry mumbles into his shoulder.
“Well, then what the hell are we talking about here? This is the longest story leading up to something that’s so obviously going to come to a head that I’ve ever heard. Every bloody anecdote is as platonic as the last, but you fancy him and the chair—“
He can’t think of anything to do but close the space and wrap his arms around Draco’s shoulders in exuberant thanks and so he does, a few seconds longer than he dared last time, and his hopeless heart imagines that Draco leans into it, but he can’t let himself think that way. He lets go too quickly to find out.
By the lockers, though, Harry sees a familiar figure walk by. It’s not even seven in the morning so he’s almost convinced that it’s not him. He’s seeing ghosts everywhere, he decides, thanks to this weird phase of his personal life and the lack of sleep it’s included, so he just stows his things and walks towards the weights.
It was as if Harry knew he’d spent his waking moments working overtime to push certain thoughts away and took it upon himself to challenge all his progress. He stood quietly, patiently, as Draco worked through his panic outside the Ministry without being told that’s what Draco needed. And when he reemerged from the building vibrating with anger, interpreting the minutes he’d just spent holding his tongue as weakness, Harry had balanced his vulnerability with his own to put them back on even footing.
bed, which feels delightfully plush, deserving of every compliment Harry had once drunkenly bestowed upon it. Instantly, he feels the paws of a kneazle pounce onto his back.
Harry leans in and kisses him, much more confidently than Draco had at the pub, firm and assertive, and he succumbs to it with an indefinable relief. His hands, seeking their role, creep to the sides of Harry’s face, too, his thumbs framing his cheeks.
He steps in cautiously, and when it remains silent he takes a second slow, quiet move. A third. His ears prick then, at the shuffle of the sole of a shoe. Towards his left, maybe. His fingers twitch around his wand and he takes stock of the furniture, the doorways, the exits when he takes the next experimental step.
He scrunches his nose experimentally, feeling its normal movement, and presses the cloth to the back of his head, standing carefully. He can feel Draco’s hand gently hovering behind his back, as if he’s not been knocked around himself, and the caring gesture makes him smile.
Harry kisses him before he can protest that he must brush his teeth and gargle mouthwash four times first, and this makes the crushing feeling grow.
At this last accusation, Ron makes it five minutes into haranguing them on the moral issue of referee foul oversight before Hermione cuts him off to turn the conversation sharply around to Harry.
“Don’t let anyone touch her place setting,” Draco calls instead to Blaise, knowing he’ll trust and listen. “I think it’s cursed.”
Draco stops writing, fumbling with the remote control to pause the movie but failing and electing to turn the entire device off instead. He sets his hands in his lap and cocks his head.
“I… have feelings for him,” he says aloud for the first time, hearing the small shake in his voice. He rubs his fingers on his eyes under his glasses, then lowers them to his cheeks and braves a glance at Ginny. She’s smiling perceptively, and it makes him feel even more ridiculous.
Harry tilts a small pan to help slide a fried egg onto his spatula. He stacks it on some toast and turns off the hob.
“And that was it,” he finishes. “He disapparated, definitely too drunk, and I haven’t heard from him since. For all I know, he ended up splinched somewhere.”
Right now, for example, Draco is waiting for him by the door in black loafers, black trousers, and a white turtleneck that slopes snugly under his chin. He’s framed the white jumper with an open black button-up and Harry watches much too discernibly when he elegantly sweeps his camel-coloured trench coat behind his arms to stick his hands in his trouser pockets.
He feels less heavy, all of the sudden, and when he opens his eyes, Harry is watching him intently. Too intently.
It’s late when Harry walks back towards Islington. He ambles slowly, enjoying the cold air on his cheeks, his hands in his pockets, not even a need for his iPod. It’s a fair walk from Ron and Hermione’s, but to feel his legs moving after a day of trace practising and no associated sparring (a strange absence, after he’d taken notice of Draco’s proclivity to immediately counter one with the other like a transaction) was pleasant.
Comparatively, the rest of Harry’s day is uneventful. Somehow, one cold shower later, he manages to arrive at the Ministry and greet the receptionist with his usual charm as though nothing had happened.
He’s waffling between responses and decides on “Er… different beasts…” just as Lucrezia stands at the other end of the room calling for attention. Ron has been sheepishly dragged up beside her.
All of this, he is certain, is old animosity rearing its ugly head, and he grips his glass firmly to ground himself and stop the cowardly urge to break eye contact and walk out before he can find Flitwick. He wills Potter to look away so he doesn’t have to, but he holds him there longer than anticipated, even as Weasley continues to attempt conversation with him.
By the time the game ends, Draco feels like he properly understands, though compared to the triple digits that Quidditch tends to end in, a final score of two to one looks measly.
Sod it, be like geese. Just… head towards home, which is this.” He grimaces, scrunching half his face up humbly. “Was that poetic analysis? How’d I do?”
The weariness has brought on a headache, and with it an irritability that he can’t tamper, but he’s still confused why his little retort has paled Seamus so severely until he feels the presence behind him.
He shakes his head and tunes out their Draco-centric conversation before it leaves him too anxious to continue. The closer they get to the restaurant, the more he begins to regret his flash of courage.
, he explains, and he fills the silence by telling Draco everything he’s missed and everything he apparently should know about the 1950’s south in the States.
He shrugs and smiles. “Just befriending change.” Draco’s other hand is still around his wrist and he covers it with his other hand. “Single for two days and I didn’t even take advantage.”
Her face tightens for a moment, so fleeting that he’s sure Ron doesn’t notice, only he, who had spent the better part of several years memorising its every inflexion, does. Then she’s sighing into a half-smile, squeezing his arm. “Thanks, love.”
Ron is heaving a heavy bag when they walk out of Obscurus Books. It had quickly become clear upon reaching the register and requesting Hermione’s order that more than just one parenting book had been put on hold—the shopkeeper hauled at least seven books onto the counter, including something called
Harry scoffs instead of bothering with words. But he does take the potion—it even tastes better than commercial Dreamless Sleep, like chamomile and lavender, which leaves him wondering why Draco’d left the Tracing potions he’d reluctantly swallowed for months so nauseating.
“What… is…” His voice drops off. He has no reason to know it—Potter’s not in the shop name, there weren’t any images in his books—but he knows. “Our healing store,” he murmurs.
is the new curse specialist?” he asks instead, not moving an inch. “I wasn’t informed, and I’ve been researching specialists all week.”
The water begins to chill about fifteen minutes later, and he climbs from the tub with a pleasant surprise at the minimalised ache to his body, only to be outdone by the mental calmness he feels in his short walk from the bathroom to the bedroom. Harry is under the covers, reading his case notes by lamplight, but he sets them aside and holds open the duvet. Draco finds pants and joins quickly, laying close in the pocket of heat that Harry’s already created.
“The Potters were Healers. Or well, at least had a Healing shop in Delhi—after they moved. They were a big part of the wizarding sector once the community retreated into secrecy. Once the family moved to England, they stayed mostly to the Godric’s Hollow area. I can’t find anything on why they went from such a large operation to something so small. Or why they moved at all. They didn’t approve of the Twenty-Eight’s blood purity rules, maybe that was part of it. Draco’s books spoke mostly about the Potters in response to the Twenty-Eight, not so much their personal motives.”
Even after taking his seat at the weekly department meeting, Ron still hasn’t arrived. Harry frowns, trying not to look towards the door too much, working to ignore the worry blooming in his chest.
Draco glares at her adamantly, feeling cross, and it’s a face she doesn’t receive often so it slows her laugh. She takes one look at his pinched expression and, half a lifetime of reading him under her belt, reaches a hand out to his arm.
“A tad literally,” Harry says, covering his mouth as he chews. “But really, I’m thrilled, that was the goal.”
Draco takes personal affront to this idea as if it’s his couch on the line, but Harry works to explain the value of movies with pizza on a couch and not at a table. The win is too easy—he’s clearly noticed that Harry had a hard day.
Harry’s lips quirk up, confused but touched. He glances down to where she’s placed her hand palm up between them across the table and reaches out to take it. She rubs her thumb lightly over a scar.
“What’s the harm?” he asks, affecting extreme indifference, finally daring to move his hand again. He feels like himself the more he leans into the self-assuredness. Harry’s eyelids flutter shut. “No, really, tell me one bad thing that could come of this.”
He mentions noticing Malfoy sitting with Parkinson and Zabini on his way back from the toilets at Boggarts. How he kept enough of an eye on him to see him stand suddenly, cheeks crimson, and barrel out the front.
“I thought I had longer before the cravings set in. She always said she was stronger than that pregnancy rubbish but I was at the off-licence getting pickles and peanut M&M’s at one in the morning last night.”
He’s thankful for the cold air that hits him like a slap to the face when he exits, and he stops just two doors down outside a closed hair salon to rest on the curb. He sits his elbows on his knees and his hands in his hair, staring at the storm drain across the street. To say he was surprised when a second body sat next to him would be a lie.
Neither Ron nor Hermione had mentioned the Erumpent in the room. He knows how it looked. Yes, Draco had been cursed and bleeding on the bathroom floor. He’d also been dressed only in his pants, as had Harry, and it had been just past seven in the morning. They’d had the decency to make it a conversation for later, but it’s eating Harry up.
He and Potter correspond a bit—more often than before. Draco doesn’t waste time fretting over whether an owl with a quick question is bothersome, and Potter must feel the same, because he’d almost immediately returned the first owl Draco sent with an answer and a long, neatly numbered list of seemingly pent-up questions.
“It’s foolish to assume that everyone learns to accept others at the same speed—look at how long it took me with the Pureblood rubbish—but we’ve been working closely for a month and I just don’t think… this won’t work much longer like this. This will only work if we accept each other for who we are, so I think it’s about time we do that. Definitively, once and for all. Do you agree, Harry?” he asks softly.
