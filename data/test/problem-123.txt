The next person began speaking, and Draco’s comments were soon forgotten. Well, forgotten by everyone except Potter. Draco dared not look at him, even though he could practically feel Potter’s eyes burning into him.
James was grinning, clearly still high on adrenaline. He crouched a little closer to his younger siblings as his face lit up. “So I was halfway to Hogsmeade, right? And they came floating out of the trees, with their nasty black hoods, all fwooo fwooo!” he made a series of whooshing noises as his hands zoomed through the air. “And they got really close, right, and I was all, ‘oh noooo, you’re sucking the life out of me, oh noooo,’ and then they were like ‘yeah, we’re evil and we’re gonna kill you,’ and then I was like ‘Expecto Patronnnummmmmmm!’ and it was super epic, you know, flicking my wand
. He turned off the water and got to his feet, his lower back crackling and body numb from the tile. He stooped to pick up his wand and cast a series of drying charms on his clothes and himself. His leather gauntlet really
Draco arrived a little early for the meeting on Friday and found the usual cliques of chatting colleagues standing outside of the door. Granger and Weasley were already seated inside, talking quietly.
...Sometimes Draco even thought about the way Potter used to peel his sweat-soaked uniform over his head in the changing room after a Quidditch match. ...The way his muscles would roll so beautifully along his shoulder blades and... Draco shook the thought from his head. Back to focusing on the hatred. The hatred of Potter.
I completely forgot to include the epilogue in my original chapter count. There is one final, fluffy chapter left!
Draco proceeded to tell Harry about everything he had seen, while Harry gently soaped Draco's neck and chest.
“Heh. The first thing I did after the war was destroy it. Er. After repairing my own wand, of course.”
"Hold on, Malfoy," Longbottom said. "My partner's hit, and we may be outnumbered. We need to wait for backup."
“I seem to be having a little potions problem.” Potter blinked dumbly at him. Merlin, his face was close. Why was his face so close? Why was his chest pressed so tightly against his? Potter lifted his chin and arced his neck, trying to push against Draco’s mattress with his elbows as he blinked even more dumbly at the ceiling. “A potions problem involving doors,” Draco clarified. Potter, growing tired of awkwardly straining to see the roof of Draco’s bedcurtains, allowed his face to fall against the mattress in the space between Draco’s neck and shoulder. Draco tried very hard to ignore Potter’s hot, heavy breaths against his neck, but they were threatening to give him a terrible case of gooseflesh. The feeling of Potter’s hideous pyjamas against his bare shoulders. Potter’s warm chest and shoulders, pressed so tightly against his own.
, and their fingers met on the handle. A new tingling heat, one that had nothing to do with the magic of his wand, surged up Draco’s arm. Potter didn’t pull away. And neither did he. It was practically a handshake.
to stupefy these Death Eaters like he had stupefied the others, but they had already seen him in the doorway. He lacked the element of surprise.
“Good. One last thing. I apologize for earlier this week--I was told that Harry would be arriving later than he did. I did not intentionally deceive you. Are you...have things been going alright?”
to keep talking. Draco clenched his fists at his sides and felt himself begin to sweat. He felt like a bottle of champagne under growing pressure, but he was fighting it--Merlin, it was taking every ounce of energy he had to fight it, but it was bordering on physical pain and he didn’t think he could resist it much longer. He could feel himself growing pale as a droplet of sweat eased down the side of his face. His whole body began trembling.
Draco heard himself take a breath as he felt his chest tighten. He stumbled back, turned away from Potter, and faced the wall. There was only one person who could have possibly done such a thing, because there was only one person with whom he'd shared a night since he left the country. There was only one person he knew (besides Rita Skeeter, of course) who was notorious for writing gossipy freelance articles for the
Draco swallowed, his throat suddenly unbearably tight. “So you’ve been carrying my wand around all this time while I, on the other hand, haven’t picked up a single British newspaper for the sole purpose of avoiding your face.” He chuckled. It was laughable, really. And it was also...something that sent a pool of nervous heat sizzling through him. He took a deep, stabilizing breath of the cold night air, letting the rain chill him to his bones. A nice, good, cold rain.
him--or trying to, anyway--that he nearly stepped on Draco's feet before they had even taken a dance step. Maybe this was why it had been so easy to avoid Potter for all these weeks; Potter seemed quite determined to avoid him as well. It was
Draco followed Granger, Weasley, and Potter upstairs, waiting for Granger to have a free moment to give him the key to his room. But Granger and Weasley appeared to be going to
“Come on, Professor Malfoy, let’s go eat some breakfast,” Lily pulled on Draco’s hand, practically dragging him out of the healing ward.

Unenlightened fools, the lot of them. It took a certain level of willful ignorance, a blindness to the real meaning of justice, and a lack of empathy for anyone to believe that supporting Voldemort and his supremacist ideals was a worthy cause. Draco knew, because
Potter disappeared into the bathroom and Draco heard running water shortly thereafter. Draco stood in the room, feeling a little strange. He was leaving for Cairo in the morning. He used to love Cairo. There were some unknowns surrounding Egypt’s Revolution, yes, but that wasn't enough to stop him from going. Why wasn’t he looking forward to it as much as he had been expecting?
Whispers erupted from the crowd all around them, but Draco couldn’t look away from Harry’s face long enough to care. He nodded encouragingly at Harry, hoping that some of his own ease might help calm Harry's nerves. Draco lifted his hand to rest on Harry’s shoulder while Harry pressed a hand to Draco’s shoulderblade. Draco was able to overhear a few pieces of conversation as they waited for the music to begin.
why the girl from the train looked familiar. Draco watched her walk toward the Sorting Hat. The Weasley hair, the Potter bone structure. It suddenly made sense. She was Potter-Weasel heathen spawn.
, and I don’t want him to embarrass himself--or me--in front of the whole country. The whole world, really.”
When Draco had finished all the work he could possibly do, he took long walks alone across the grounds, trying not to think about Potter. Trying not to think about that delightful golden light of his touch. Trying not to think about Potter’s face after he had punched him to the floor.
and now he was completely losing his nerve. "That I might try staying around for a while, if that's alright with you. Rebuild the Malfoy name the old-fashioned way. You know...lots of fancy dress parties, political intrigue, that sort of thing. Or maybe I’ll stay at Hogwarts for another year.” He smiled, and then frowned. “No, that’s not what I was going to say. I mean, I was going to say it, but there's...” Draco sighed defeatedly. There was no avoiding it now. “I was going to say that I--” Draco took a deep breath. “I love you." Draco nearly swallowed his tongue. He could say this. "I
Malfoy kicked the blankets further down his bed, suddenly feeling overwarm. It was a good thing, he supposed, that he had no plans to stay at Hogwarts for any longer than was necessary, and he certainly had no plans to interact with Harry Potter. He couldn’t sleep, so he might as well get dressed and try to get some work done.
“Of course!” Draco grinned. “I think I feel better than I’ve ever felt in my entire life. Isn’t that something?” Draco grinned even wider and opened his mouth to continue, and then suddenly a voice in his head was screaming at him. It was a tiny voice, but it was screaming so loudly and frantically that Draco thought maybe he should listen. The voice was saying:
Then there was a heat back in Potter’s eyes that suggested he might also be thinking about the incident in Draco’s bed, and Draco watched his eyes go a little glossy. Merlin, he was so bloody gorgeous that Draco couldn’t look away. Oh, the things he wanted to do to Potter, the delicious things he wanted to--
Granger asked each person to state their name, department, and what first drew them to their chosen field. Draco’s first instinct was to say something along the lines of
“Yes, and once the potion reacted with the down in his pillow--goose feathers, Malfoy, like all Hogwarts pillows, you know this--the entire pillow incinerated, the bed caught fire,” (this was the part where Draco was trying very, very hard to not burst out laughing) “and the entire room became an inferno in the middle of the night before a group of sixth and seventh years were able to extinguish the fire with some water spells. One of James’ roommates had to go to the Hospital Wing.”
Draco slept through the night without any problems and spent Saturday in bed, drinking water like a fish. He spent most of Sunday with Granger in his classroom, running more tests on the potions he had consumed Friday night. Weasley would occasionally pop his head into the room and make light conversation when Draco and Granger weren't too deep in focus.
“Can you tell me what happened when you opened the door the first time? Were you casting a spell, anything like that?”
“Good," Harry grinned, but it quickly turned into a thoughtful frown. "What about the Ministry? The Manor?”
Draco took a breath. He needed to slow down, or he was going to come untouched, for fuck’s sake. It had been a long time since
." Draco rolled his hips, ineffectively trying to get desperately-needed friction against his aching cock. "Brilliant. Don't stop. Keep fucking me with," Draco hissed as Harry wrapped his fist around Draco's cock and began to stroke, "that golden cock. Brilliant. Brilliant," he repeated nonsensically, letting the word roll from his tongue until he could only moan as Harry fucked him into his pillows.
The two Death Eaters entered another small room and Draco clutched his wand behind them, trying to determine how best to proceed. He could stupefy them, but as they were standing side by side one would very likely notice before Draco had the chance to fire a second spell. Then again, Draco would undoubtedly be catching them off their guard. He decided to take the risk.
"I'll help, mate," Weasley twirled his wand over his fingers. "Been a while since I've seen a good fight."
“He’d freak out, okay?” James said. “He’s always freaking out. Afraid I’m going to fall and kill myself or something.”
About halfway through the task, a scuffle was developing in the back corner of the room. Draco wandered toward the noise to investigate.
Potter stood in his doorway, looking like he wanted to run away. James was standing directly beside him, clutching his robes so that he couldn’t run, even if he tried.
Draco's eyes lingered too long before he forced himself into the bathroom. Draco cleaned his teeth and changed into a pair of silk pyjama bottoms before catching his reflection in the mirror and taking a deep breath.
. They never involved Death Eaters trying to regain power; they were never direct and personal threats to the lives of people Draco cared about.
Deep, stabilizing breaths of that cold night air. Bloody hell. He was smiling. His face was smiling of its own accord. Potter had merely waved a few nice, mildly suggestive words around and Draco’s face was flattered enough to start smiling without his permission. Draco sighed and kicked at a drowning stone by his foot. “You have nothing to thank me for.”
Draco strode across the ballroom floor toward the Death Eaters. “Expelliarmus! Stupefy! Incarcerous!”
He feared that the Potter compartment of his brain was completely, irreparably destroyed, threatening to never pack itself away again.
“Yes, now.” The coldness was back in his voice, and Potter pulled his glasses sharply from the bedside table, forced them onto his face and sat back, blinking at him.
“It’s perfect,” Potter said, turning his head to watch it so that his cheek was pressed against into Draco’s shoulder.
A door opened from another wall. Draco opened his mouth, but Granger beat him to it. “You!” she called. “What were you just thinking about?”
wand. “You.” Draco whispered, tightening his grasp around Harry’s hand, altering their fingers until all of his were directly on the wand while still touching Harry. “I think about
a hero." James crossed his arms over his chest. "Sometimes I wish I knew my dad when he was younger,” he sighed. “Just to see what he was like.”
"Quite," Draco said, raising his eyebrows as he angled his glass into one hand. He lifted his pint and took a sip.
“Thank you,” Harry murmured as he turned the key in their room lock and opened the door. “For tonight. Sometimes I forget that you’re so good at that. That it was your life.”
Lily simply hopped onto a stool across the table from him, pressed her elbows on the table and placed her chin in her hands. “What are you making?”
Granger looked thoughtful. “Well all of us were thinking about something with very direct purpose. Something to accomplish. What opportunities would be available to--”
Draco looked around the wet, dark stone, trying to re-acquaint himself. As a Slytherin he was no stranger to Hogwarts dungeons, but these were another beast entirely. He had some memory of these deep dungeons from his searches in sixth year, but he was still impressed with how large this first room was. And how damp. Attached to the main room were at least six doors and three corridors. Draco strained to remember the layout of the dungeons. He knew that if he traveled south he would end up in mazes, or dead ends, or drippy caverns beneath the lake. If he traveled west he would surely encounter the old catacombs. That left north and east as his most likely options. He began with north, walking down seemingly endless corridors and poking his head into room after room, sometimes only to discover that they weren’t rooms at all but hallways that led elsewhere. Draco felt like he had barely made any progress after four hours of exploration, and decided that, as he progressed with this project, he needed to bring in more tricks from the archaeological trade. He needed exploration spells--things that would map out the dungeons as he went, jot down notes about each room as he said them aloud. That way, he could at least explore the dungeons more systematically; he would waste less of his time covering old ground.
Draco pulled up a chair at James’ side. “Interesting theory, Mr. Potter. Most Death Eaters I knew couldn’t cast one.”
“A tie, I think.” Draco said, staring down at the snitch trapped between his and Potter’s clasped hands.
“Absolutely,” Draco nodded. It had been so easy. Far easier than he had expected it to be, given that this was Granger. Given what he was asking for. Given that he wouldn’t have to sneak around as he had originally expected. All things considered, her terms were quite reasonable.
Weasley held onto Draco's shoulder, waiting for Draco's equilibrium to settle so that he could stand on his own. “He ran into some dementors on his way to Hogsmeade last night, but he cast a successful Patronus, made it to Hermione and me, and he’s fine. A little shaken up, I think. When he showed up, he was terrified that he was going to have to deal with losing a parent all over again.” Weasley sighed shakily. “But then your Patronus showed up, letting us know that Harry was alright, and we brought James back to the healing ward for safekeeping. I keep trying to remind Harry that we did that and
“Yes, yes, you win,” Weasley sighed, rolling his eyes. Draco looked up to see Potter returning from the loo, looking a little flustered.
“Right. Well,” Weasley emptied one of the shot glasses and looked back and forth between Draco and Potter. Then Weasley downed the remains of his pint, and slammed it on the bar. “Ten points for Slytherin.”
Harry hummed with pleasure, mindlessly lifting a hand to Draco’s left wrist. His thumb dragged against Draco’s black leather gauntlet. “This must be terribly uncomfortable,” he murmured. Harry tapped it, and water splashed beneath his fingers. “You’ll ruin it.”
“You have got to be joking,” Draco drawled, referring as much to Weasley's idea of flirting as he was the implication that
There was a knock on his door, and when Draco opened it an entirely different feeling poured into him. He hated being lonely. He didn’t want to be lonely at all. He wanted Harry in his arms again. He wanted to feel that joyous golden light.
“After seeing how bad things got the last time, I think I’d feel more comfortable if you were sitting down. How much do you usually take?”
took it off in front of anyone--always slipped into a cubicle or waited until everyone was gone. Don’t think I didn’t notice.”
able to craft an antidote, which he was almost certain she could, it would take at least another twenty minutes to brew even the most basic potion, and he was beginning to think he might be dead by then.
bad news mates,” Weasley said almost conspiratorially, holding up a single key. “We found you a room, Malfoy, but you’ll have to share.” Weasley threw the key to Potter, who was looking dumbfoundedly at Ron, but still caught the key as instinctively as he would catch a golden snitch. Potter blinked down at the key, while Draco stared at it in horror. This was going to royally cock up his mental Potter box, he just knew it.
. It was so unlike what he was used to, where every new job meant a new place with new faces--strangers he could detach from before any pesky attachments could develop. He reached for the doorframe and took an unsteady breath, feeling a little overwhelmed.
Draco sat at the edge of the door frame, letting his feet dangle in the air for a moment before placing his feet on the familiar floor of the Slytherin toilets, and slowly, slowly slid through. It felt bloody strange, having gravity shift directions around him like that. “Close it,” Draco said, once on his hands and knees on the tile floor. Albus closed the door. Draco pushed himself to his feet and brushed off his hands and knees. “Mr. Potter! I am hoping you can help me with a little project.” Draco immediately walked over to the sink to wash his hands. “What door did you just try to open?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered. Potter’s eyebrow furrowed a little, but he didn’t move. He didn’t speak. He just kept staring at Draco’s eyes--no, Draco’s
This was going to be a long, long weekend. He sat down in his chair and made a highly technical research note, feeling the vermouth begin to take effect.
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispered, pulling at Draco’s lower lip with his teeth and then smoothing the sting with his tongue. “I’ve
Potter pressed a foot into his palms and, trying to sustain balance and Potter’s weight, Draco grunted as he pushed himself to his feet. Potter went soaring upward until his fingers dug into the wall only two feet below the edge, but then they lost balance and both were toppling backward into the dirt.
“To...waltz?” Draco looked at Potter who, once again, was staring down at his shoes. A strand of dark hair fell over his eyes and Draco was tempted to push it away.
to Draco’s left. Potter’s wand had washed into the pit. Draco leaned toward his left to pick it up, and felt a familiar, almost-forgotten sensation spreading through his hand. He was hit with a wave of nostalgia. The fact of the matter was: it wasn’t Potter’s wand at all. He ran his fingers along the familiar curves of smooth hawthorn. “Is this
With one last glance up at Potter, Draco pulled his waistcoat back over his shoulders, not bothering to button it up as he pulled his robe over his arm and began walking hastily back to school grounds.

case," Weasley clarified, settling back on his stool and joining the conversation. "I think we'll all sleep better when the bastards are brought to justice."
“Because we’re shagging, obviously.” Draco couldn’t resist an opportunity to poke Weasley with a stick, and was rewarded when Weasley looked up at him with a murderous glare. Draco glanced at Potter to make sure he hadn’t crossed a line, but Potter was trying too hard not to laugh to notice.
After dinner, far more content with food in his belly, Draco wandered back to his room. He reviewed his potions journal, jotting down a few additional notes where he decided he hadn’t been clear enough, and stretched. He would plan to talk to Granger as soon as he could. If he didn’t find another willing volunteer, he would just have to continue alone. Agreement or no agreement, he
at the photographs and they darted into his hand before he tossed them safely to the floor. “Plus, if you're going to be doing more research, I think I’d better assist with the experiments,” Harry purred, pulling Draco back down onto the bed. “You know, for science.”
Potter--in the Great Hall. They never seemed to actually run into each other--Draco purposely avoided him at all costs, and Potter had taken to grimacing at him for whatever reason, which suited Draco just fine. He'd hardly known what to do with the Potter he met by the dungeons, and this was much easier. They never spoke. If they did happen to pass each other in the halls they shared a silent, wary glance. That was all. It was all very reminiscent of their school days, really.
“Correct.” Draco tried to return their focus to the waltz by stepping forward, but Harry was rooted like a tree; Draco did nothing but press their legs together. He quickly stepped back again. "I'm fine, thanks to Granger."
After his shower and some cosy drying charms, Draco emerged from the bathroom wearing a pale green shirt, a silver waistcoat and trousers, and a dark green tie and suitcoat. He wore his pale hair partially up in a slim ponytail, letting the rest fall long and loose over his shoulders.
, and he was being ridiculous. He took a deep breath, straightened his shoulders, and sat down, fanning out his cloth serviette with a forceful flick of his wrists and smoothing it over his lap. He sat upright in his chair, the perfect image of pureblood etiquette, and didn’t look at Potter for the rest of the meal.
"Potter," Draco groaned as he shook his head grimly. He could strangle the man. In fact, he fully intended to, once Harry was
When Draco heard Harry’s breath deepen and even out about fifteen minutes later, he knew Harry had finally drifted to sleep. As exhausted as Draco was, he couldn't sleep. Between the lingering bourbon, the sight of Harry in his boxers, and the golden heat of Harry’s touch in the dark, Draco was as hard as a fucking boulder. He slowly, quietly moved just a little farther from Potter and allowed his hand to drift beneath the sheet and into his silk pyjama bottoms. Draco sighed with pleasure when he wrapped his hand around his cock. He allowed his mind to drift, and it very quickly drifted to the man sleeping next to him. To the feeling of Potter’s thumbs along his knuckles. The feeling of Potter’s hot breath on his face. The sight of him in the shower. The feeling of his amazing mouth on his cock. He began to stroke himself slowly and silently beneath the sheet. He grew closer and closer to climax, until--
The entrance hall was immaculately clean. There were no blood stains on the stones or cobwebs in the corners. There were no traces of snake skins or bones. There were no tortured screams, no angry voices, no scent of decay. There were no signs of every evil, terrible thing that Draco
Through the dark Draco could see Harry extending both hands toward him. Draco hesitated. A small part of him wanted to refuse. He knew that he should refuse. Logic told him to refuse. But another part of him, an admittedly larger part, was eager. Illogical, and ecstatic, and made of butterflies, and eager. This part desperately wanted to share a bed with Potter. To sleep beneath the same blanket as Potter. To wake up contentedly beside him like he
Draco sat at the head table in a daze. How strange it all was, seeing the world from the opposite side of this table. He looked out at all of the excited young faces, suddenly nostalgic for his own childhood. For that
“Back off, Weasley, before you hurt someone,” Draco said, hauling Weasley away from Potter and pushing him back down the bar. “Merlin, you honestly call that
Draco lifted a finger to pull the dark hair out of Harry’s eyes before he remembered that it wouldn't do any good. He wished he could console this younger version of Harry. He wished he could tell Harry that, despite everything that was ahead and all of the people he would lose, he would be okay. It would never be easy, but it would be okay. He wanted to tell this Harry that Draco wouldn’t always be young and stupid and cruel. Someday, Draco would be there to hold him, and they would… they would what? Be together? They weren’t together. Draco had left, even though Harry had asked him to stay.
“No, I don’t think so.” Potter’s thumb was doing that thing again. Just barely grazing along the edge of Draco’s gloved thumb. Draco pulled back immediately, and the snitch went darting upward and away.
? Why can’t we have an alcohol fountain in our room?” Weasley was staring at the Fountain of Vermouth, which was still going strong.
“What?” Potter blinked, and then snatched the wand out of Draco’s hands. “Oh. Right. I mean I guess it is, in a way.”
“I’m so sorry,” Harry whispered against his mouth. “I didn’t know...” Harry traced his tongue along Draco’s lower lip and then pulled away.
fucking pleased with himself in that Harry Potter way of his, and Draco knew it was probably the sleep deprivation and the lingering vermouth and the morning erection, but now that look was driving him crazy in a completely different way. Now he wanted to replace that smug look with something else. He wanted...
“Argh!” Potter shouted with a sob, kicking at the air. “Stop it, stop it, what is wrong with you?” he yelled, apparently to himself now, since the rest of the room was empty and the owl was gone. Harry even punched
in him for some inexplicable reason. He was interested in Draco, even when Draco had been at his worst. This whole bloody time, through the war and all of it, Harry had
Draco’s eyes darted to a wrapped bar of soap on the sink, and he pointed to it. Potter squinted. Harry wasn’t wearing his glasses, and probably just saw blurs of white. As Potter leaned out of the shower toward the sink, the curtain shifted further away from his hip, revealing a sharp edge of dark curls. Draco charged into the bathroom in an instant, snatched the soap off of the sink, and handed it to Potter so that he wouldn’t move another millimetre away from that shower curtain. Draco made sure to
Harry pulled Draco from the crowd until they were walking onto the dance floor together, hand in hand. There were several gasps from the crowd, which only made Draco grin wider as Harry led him to the center of the dance floor.
"Malfoy..." Potter softly pressed his fingers to Draco’s spine, and Draco jolted toward the door as if he had just been burned by an Incendio spell. Something about all of this felt far too vulnerable. Being touched--especially being touched by Harry Potter--he didn’t trust it. He didn’t trust it at all. He threw open the closet door, squinted against the light, and stormed down the hall.
“Just a little bit?” Potter nudged Draco with his elbow, seemingly impervious to all of Draco’s old defense tactics. The old Potter would have given up on him by now, calling him a heartless son of a dementor or something equally lacking in imagination. This new adult-child and his light banter? This was a version of Potter he didn’t know at all.
scrawled onto the labels. He opened his dragon leather satchel and began sticking the vials carefully into his vial holder, which had the capacity to fit twelve potions. Two slots were already holding Calming Draughts. Wanting to limit his trips to this room as much as possible but still intrigued by all of the potions at his disposal, he grabbed the Flame-resistant potion (just in case he needed to transport any more failed potions onto students' pillows) and two other potions with completely blank labels before returning to the brighter, warmer floors of Hogwarts.
. Or so Draco imagined. No one had said any of those things to him in his life, so he wouldn’t really know. Still, Draco could feel himself unraveling. He could feel himself coming completely undone beneath Potter’s gaze.
They sat in comfortable silence and Draco stared toward the open door of the shower cubicle as heat danced across his knuckles beneath Harry’s mouth. “This room,” he murmured finally, “was once the bane of my existence.”
the children's room, he slipped into the hallway. Granger and Weasley were outside the door, quietly finishing a conversation with two Aurors.
Draco also had the horrific realization that if there had been the slightest labeling error, the potion might be filed under a different letter entirely. There was also the possibility that the label had been written in a language other than English, in which case Draco had a
Harry made a soft noise, a little high-pitched and in the back of his throat. “Draco,” he whimpered again.
?" Draco looked at Harry, scandalized. "When there’s perfectly good overthinking to do? Where would my career be if I
. Thank Merlin. But he was still freezing. Draco needed to get Potter out of the ice that was still pelting from the sky, but Hogwarts was too far. Draco pulled Harry into his arms with the assistance of a spell and half-carried, half-levitated him, walking rapidly toward the dark, abandoned Quidditch pitch. He walked beneath the stands, down the stairs, and kicked the doors to the changing rooms open. They didn’t budge. He cast an angry spell at them and they shot open long enough for him to get Harry inside, and then they slammed closed behind them.
“Tomorrow night around seven o’clock, Ron, Hermione, and I are going for a drink at the Hog’s Head--less likely to run into students there, you know--I’d really like it if you joined us. Just so I can see that you’re alright after tonight. You can tell us about the potion.” Draco nodded again and gripped the pillow to his face. “And Malfoy.” Draco glared up at him, half of his face obscured by silk and fluff. “Next weekend I’ll volunteer. I’ll help you finish your potions experiments, if you’ll have me.”
, that, giving her a warded cane. No Death Eater spells could get through the thing. It saved both her
what you said the first time," Harry murmured, pressing kisses against the inside of Draco's thighs. "Say it again."
Back in his rooms that evening, Draco kept trying to remember details about the night at the Hog's Head, wondering if he'd done something to scare Potter off. He'd had way more to drink than he was used to, and the whole night still felt blurry no matter how many times he tried to remember it. ...Except the very dreamy memory of Potter’s ear in his mouth. And gold. There was still something about gold. Anyway, maybe he had misinterpreted Potter’s body language and crossed a line. Certainly when Potter had suggested that they be
By the time the waltz finished, Harry and Draco were both breathing heavily, their chests rising and falling together.
“You’re getting far too good at that,” Draco murmured, turning to drape an arm and a leg over Harry.
“I think I can make my dad’s Sleeping Draught a little stronger if I only use the dried lavender flowers instead of the whole sprig.”
Suddenly a small object clattered near his feet and Draco felt his limbs being pulled tightly together.
“I will post a volunteer request in the Faculty Room on Monday morning, and I will mention it in our meeting later this week. If no one volunteers to assure your safety, and the safety of others, then I cannot allow these experiments to continue. Is that clear?” Granger even
“I know!" Harry said, his voice tight and tense. He let out a breath and when he spoke again, his voice had returned to a gentle whisper. "I know. I thought you were...that you had...I’m sorry.” Harry lifted his hand and pressed it gently against Draco’s face, touching Draco's jaw and lip, where the hurts that Harry's fist had once left had long since healed. Draco stepped away before he could be seduced by the golden warmth he so desperately missed. By the
.” With the hand not holding the broom, Draco slowly reached down and began unfastening his waistcoat, one silver button at a time. He slid it off of his shoulders and sent it floating over to his robes. Potter’s eyes were glued to the silver shirt fitted tightly against Draco’s lean chest. Then Draco unfastened the cufflinks of his shirt sleeves, taking his time. He rolled his left sleeve up first, revealing the black leather gauntlet he kept around his Dark Mark. And then rolled up his right, slowly baring the pale skin of his forearm. When Draco had finished, Potter’s eyes darted back to Draco’s face as though he was trying not to get caught looking. “You name the teams,” Draco said, wriggling his fingers into a pair of thin black gloves.
“Opportunity,” Granger was clarifying. “The people who likely end up in this room are thinking with some kind of purpose in mind. Pursuing some kind of opportunity. And the magic is somehow linked not to you, Malfoy, but to where the potion was consumed. Like that,” Granger pointed at the Fountain of Vermouth. “I would bet that came directly from a potion, didn’t it?”
Granger bit her lip, picked up a folder on the table and began flipping through parchment. “Yes,” she smiled, tucking her quill over her ear. “Yes, I believe we do. You’re welcome to travel with us, and we can promise you a safe place to stay.”
. Draco began shaking again, but this time it wasn’t because he was resisting the potion. It was because Potter was looking at him in
He found his younger self studying in the Slytherin common room. He tried touching his younger self. He tried standing in the same space as his younger self. That didn’t work either. Nothing worked. He tried test after test, and nothing changed.
Draco tried to loosen his fingers on Harry’s head, but they wouldn’t move. He hadn’t the willpower. “Close,” he managed to say, not recognizing his own voice. Harry pulled his hand from Draco’s arse and began massaging the sensitive sacks of flesh at the base of Draco’s cock, as if encouraging Draco to continue. Draco whined with pleasure as he continued to thrust. “Harry, I'm--
As he neared the pitch, he could see that the dementor was undoubtedly confronting Potter. If Potter hadn't noticed the dementor before, he was surely noticing it now.
Weasley gave Draco a brief tutorial, and then they counted to three and revealed their choices. “Ha!” Draco said. “I win! Wand beats rock! Take that, Weasley. I’ll be hiding in the corner, shielding my eyes from your ghastly display.”
“Merlin, I can’t stop thinking about it,” Draco blurted. Then he bit down on his lip so hard he thought he might begin bleeding. Potter was giving him that smug smile again, and the potion part of Draco wanted to keep talking. But he could
When he had a surplus of ingredients, he began browsing the library for newspapers, trying to see if there was any news about Death Eaters on the rise and what they might want with Hogwarts. He didn’t find anything. He didn’t even flinch when he saw Harry’s face on a page with the heading:
to find the Fountain of Youth. This would change his career. This would change the entire Wizarding World. And maybe people would finally be able to look at him and think
“Did you try to nullify it with a-- Why can’t I move my arms or legs? Did you cast Incarcerous on me, you tosser?” So that’s why Potter was still on top of him, breathing heavily into his neck. He couldn’t very well lift himself off.
On New Year’s Eve, he didn’t even bother to join the miserable students in the Great Hall. He was perfectly capable of being miserable all by himself, thankyouverymuch, with his piles of morbid newspapers and his ever-flowing fountain of vermouth.
The Hogwarts Express hissed and came to a gradual stop. He stood and braced himself against the opposite wall. Anxiety swelled in his gut. He hadn’t finished his plan. He hadn’t finished his
Harry pressed two fingers inside of Draco and curled them until he was massaging Draco's prostate. Draco hissed sharply between his teeth, bucking against Harry's hand. "How about now?" Harry asked. "Brilliant?"
He eventually passed the younger version of himself leaving the Slytherin common room, walking between Greg and Vincent. Draco lingered, watching Vincent with a mournful heart. He watched the way the young Draco openly mocked Vincent's stupidity. How little he knew then. How little they all knew.
It was almost a shame that his son would never see the young Harry Potter, though. “You want to?” Draco asked, wondering why he hadn’t thought of it before.
It was a crisp September morning at Hogwarts, and Draco was sitting upright beneath his silk sheets, still naked. The Fountain of Vermouth was trickling by his transfigured desk and sunlight was pouring through his window. Draco absently pulled his lower lip between his fingers as he ran his eyes over the photographs sprawled over the emerald sheets around him. The photographs depicted walls and hieroglyphs from the Tomb of Hannu. He
Draco and Harry were completely alone. The silence was palpable as Draco fully surveyed the room with dread.
“Well, I-- sort of had assistance. From a house elf.” Draco pulled a strand of long blonde hair over his ear and smiled a little sheepishly at Potter, who smiled back. Potter was sitting in his
before he pulled his leather satchel over his head and set it in a chair, resisting a childish urge to jump up and down on his new silk bed.
“For fuck’s sake, Potter, don’t. It’s--” Draco inhaled as Harry pressed his mouth against the scar at Draco’s shoulder, running his tongue along the long line of it, across Draco’s chest. Draco moaned and let his head fall back against the wall. Potter scooted down and began the second scar with his tongue, then pressed tickling kisses across his stomach to his ribs. Harry pulled Draco's shirt out of his trousers and threw it against the wall with a wet smack. He dug his fingers into the waistline of Draco’s trousers and pulled them down just enough to lick the scar from Draco’s naval to the top of his pelvis. Draco dug his knuckles into the tile floor, worried he might faint from how good it felt.
her watching them. He had a sneaking suspicion that he and Potter were both being held hostage. Well. He may as well get it over with.
“It’s about time you useless fucks got here!” he spat, summoning every ounce of haughtiness into his bones.
“Fine,” he assured her, “but that’s not actually why I’m here. I’ve… made some advancements with the project we discussed.”
“I don’t mind.” Draco crossed the room and stepped into the kitchen area, admiring the way his pale green shirt brought out Harry’s eyes. They were beautifully, deeply green, even behind his spectacles. Draco didn’t know when he’d see those eyes again.
, naive and misplaced though it may have been. It had been a long, long time since he had felt anything close to it.
Back in London, the crowds were so thick that Draco was relieved that he had thought to apparate onto a rooftop. Once on the ground, he pressed his way through the streets toward one of the magical palace entrances.
"Hush." Draco cast a healing spell that he had always found particularly effective after a Crucio. Draco held Harry's face between his hands and pressed his lips to Harry's forehead until they were both thrumming with healing, golden warmth.
“Should be over by tonight. I hope,” Draco said. A door opened in the floor beneath his desk chair, which clattered toward the wall. “Out!” he shouted. The door slammed closed, and his chair fell sideways onto the floor.
“Of course you don’t! You don’t think anything!" Draco snapped. This wasn't Amortentia, and that was the problem. Draco didn't know
The small orchestra began to play their waltz. Harry began simply: a small dance held in one place, with no grand gestures or circles. Draco followed Harry's lead.
Draco retreated from the bathroom and closed the door. Loudly. He had intended to wait until he was at least in the privacy of the shower before he began wanking, but the second sight of Potter had pushed him too far. He leaned against the bathroom door and could practically hear Potter soaping himself. He dug his hand into his trousers and pulled himself off right there in their hotel room. When he finished, he cast a shameful cleaning charm and stared hopelessly at the ceiling.
Nearly everyone left on Christmas holiday, stranding Draco with the house elves, a handful of miserable students, and unexpected waves of boredom.
Once most of his students had come around to either fearing him or respecting his authority, his classes went fairly smoothly. The Potter-Weasels somehow managed to bring him the most fun. He greatly enjoyed finding excuses to trim points from Gryffindor on James’ behalf, or add points to Slytherin on account of Albus’ astounding potions knowledge. Lily was a more neutral party; he didn’t give her points, but he didn’t take them away either.
“Yes it was! I fear I've insulted her terribly. She is probably never coming back, which means that I’ve lost my only viable assistant, and seeing as everyone despises me for very credible reasons, I will no longer be able to continue my experiments. My career is absolutely ruined!” Draco said with a smile. A nice, big, warm smile. He felt bloody fantastic. Wasn’t it so pleasant to say all of these things out loud?
“Mmm,” Harry hummed. “You know what I used to imagine? What you might look like beneath your uniform. You
“I always knew you would turn on us,” James said with a scowl, his wand out and trembling slightly. “That you were with
Eventually James returned to the battlements, walking very slowly. He leaned against the low stone wall, gripping it tight and shaking his head. He took a breath. “Thank you. For showing me.”
Draco pressed his mouth to Harry’s neck. His chest. His navel. He followed that trail of dark hair until he flicked his tongue across the tip of Harry’s prick before sucking Harry into his mouth, delighting in how fucking good and heady he tasted. Harry hissed, arching off the mattress and Draco pulled his mouth off of his cock, biting back a smile as he pushed Harry’s hips back down.
field, and Harry knew nothing about Wizarding Egypt or the associated hieroglyphs. Draco pointed to the second photograph. “This is the one with the potion. See it there, below their hands, emitting the--?” Draco squinted and picked up the photograph in an urgent rush of excitement. Then he picked up the first photograph Harry had pointed at, looking back and forth between them. “Merlin,” he whispered. “Harry, you’re brilliant,” Draco turned and skated his lips over Harry's.
Malfoy groaned. Was Potter imagining what it would be like to have Draco cradling his sacks right now? To have Draco stroking his cock?
To his surprise, James Potter was standing on the other side of the door, looking panicked. “You’re a Death Eater. You know Death Eater stuff?”
it. And the 20th century headmasters had not been known for their supreme record-keeping skills; he would be doing them a favour, really. But everyone at Hogwarts knew him too well. In fact, he was fairly convinced that the headmistress
after that, much less attempt to head the entire Auror organization? No wonder James despised Death Eaters as violently as he did. Draco looked at the date. The newspaper was five years old.
As Draco observed Albus throughout class, however, he noted that this Potter-Weasel was different from the others. He didn’t have Lily’s smiling social ease, nor James’  defiance. He was sitting in the front of the class, but he kept his eyes to his desk and often shifted uncomfortably in his chair, looking terribly shy and awkward. As Draco scanned down his parchment with students’ names and houses, he noted that Albus was in Slytherin House. A Potter-Weasel in
Draco was already half asleep when he felt Harry reach across the bed and trace a gentle fingertip down the side of Draco's face. Draco hummed into his pillow as the tingling heat caressed his skin. “Stay,” Harry whispered so quietly that Draco was convinced he was already dreaming. “I wish you’d stay.”
, until the ballroom doors banged open and Longbottom marched in with a small army behind him: Weasley, half a dozen Aurors, and one very sneaky reporter.
, and this was what he got. This was why Draco fled from emotions; when he opened up to them he could feel unbelievable joy, yes, but he could also feel unbelievable pain.
“Attention!” He shouted to the room. It went silent immediately. He began a basic lecture on the importance of Potions-Making and its many uses in the Wizarding World. He gave an overview of what they would be learning that year, as well as what they could expect for the remaining years at Hogwarts. He noticed Lily Luna sitting toward the center of the room, watching him with an interested smile on her face. It was almost unnerving, and he found himself looking away.
As Draco followed Harry back to their room, he felt the wires of himself tightening, as though at any moment he would snap. He would return to their room. He would sleep. He would leave in the morning. He repeated this over and over in his mind until he could feel his steely exterior slowly returning, and he felt more comfortable beneath it.

Draco was grinding his teeth. Suddenly he realized that this wasn’t winning at all. Winning was what would have happened if he had accepted the fact that he had lost in the first place. Now Weasley was touching Potter. Slapping him on the back like they had just finished a bracing game of Quidditch or something equally ridiculous.
“Ha! I win!” Draco exclaimed, staring down at his fist and Weasley’s two fingers, which were...well they were pointing upward in a vulgar salute, weren’t they? No matter. “I win, right?”
Granger was standing on her tiptoes at the end of Draco’s bed, trying to get a better look at the door. “And it’s doing
“I will too, Granger,” he said, surprised that he wholeheartedly meant the words. “It’s been an unexpected pleasure.”
The back of Potter’s neck turned the shade of a beet. “I uh… well I er...” he giggled in a short, overly-innocent, high-pitched sort of way.

Potter did see that. Thank Merlin. Potter slowly lifted his hand from Malfoy’s chest, pulled his wrist out of Malfoy’s grip, and got to his feet. “Can I at least send a house elf to keep an eye on you?”
“I’m relieved to hear that,” Granger sipped her tea. “Things have been so difficult for Harry with Ginny gone, you know? He’s been doing so much better recently, and I just...”
“Yes,” Longbottom was saying, jotting something down onto a small piece of parchment. “Was that before or after you--”
.” Draco nodded toward their hands. That golden light was there, pulsing between them; except now, for the first time, it was visibly circling their hands and spiraling around the wand.

been something he did every day, once upon a time. “Draco Malfoy,” he said, smiling up at her as he kissed the back of her hand. “A pleasure, Ms. Randhawa.”
It was the phrasing. Draco knew perfectly well what Harry meant, but his mind drifted to places he knew it shouldn’t. Back in the ballroom at Hogwarts, Harry had already confessed to never being with a man before, hadn't he?
he was gay this whole time. Potter had known when he gave Draco that devouring look in the Great Hall. Potter had known when he found Draco by the dungeon entrance that first night.
...But there was nothing Draco could say that this Snape would hear. Draco left the room before his regret could overwhelm him.
At first, nothing happened. Then he started to feel very strange, like he was floating. And then the strange shifted into terrible, like he was floating and then falling while being pulled in a million different directions. He dizzily reached toward his desk table to support himself, and Potion 3 wobbled off the corner of his desk and shattered on the floor.
Draco felt like someone had just stabbed him in the chest. He looked over to Potter’s silhouette, zooming around the Quidditch pitch. Ginny Weasley was
. Focus potion, that must be a relative of Wit-Sharpening potion. As he approached FOU, his heart sank. Something had happened to them. Basilisk spit dripping from a pipe in the ceiling, possibly. Or age. Most of the potion labels between Foolproof and Fuel were damaged or completely illegible, with a few exceptions. Fountain of Blood and Fountain of Mead, for example, were disturbingly pristine.
April went by quickly, and already Draco and Harry found themselves at their very last waltzing lesson.
“Only for a...?” Draco’s stomach recoiled. A world without Potter, even for a few minutes, that was...that was unthinkable. “Merlin, Potter, and here you’re whinging over a couple of Crucios. That evil fucking bastard.”
“No, actually.” Draco sighed, pulling loose strands of hair over his ears--loose strands that had messily strayed from his ponytail beneath Potter’s hands. He felt rather miserable, really, for what he was about to do. “I think you’d better leave.”
“There weren’t, actually. Your reputation precedes you, Professor Malfoy. The work you’ve been doing is exquisite. I am particularly eager to discuss your work in Siberia, whenever you feel more settled.”
“So far I have surmised that doors--at random--will lead to this room. And the doors currently closed in this room never lead to where they’re supposed to. The other doors leading here, though, I really don’t understand. It doesn’t make much sense. I asked A...a student last night what they were thinking about when they opened the door that led here, and they said they were going to try to get a student to stop snoring. No active spells. Nothing.”
Draco ran back to the potions classroom. Maybe if he stood in the exact same spot where he had entered this vision and wished himself back…?
Of course, Draco never actually found the vial in the tomb, because he later discovered that the tomb had already been ransacked sometime in the 1910s by Havartus E. Carter, wizard archaeologist famous for chauvinistic unprofessionalism and reckless archaeological practices.

that his mouth had opened, but it was enough. The drops slid into his mouth and onto his tongue. Draco tried to swallow, but his tongue wouldn’t work.
“Yes, I think that might be it. How fascinating. And, frankly, terrifying. This type of magic with this level of power in a potion is... we should do more research on both of these potions.”
“Potter?” Draco asked nervously, scooting forward until his legs were dangling over the edge of the bed. “What potion--?” Potter took a few staggering steps toward him. “

at one corner--into the tiniest little arrogant smirk. And Draco felt his breath hitch. Why was that so fucking sexy? Usually he hated that smirk. It was abhorrent. It drove him crazy.
Draco only had a class of third years that morning, and then he had intended to work on lesson planning for the rest of the day. A faculty meeting? In the Faculty Room? That meant a large round table, where everyone had to look at each other and participate in some sort of stupid icebreaker exercise. He would actually be required to
“Well, someone had to rescue you from your embarrassing performance in front of Wilson.” Draco teased, then sat on the sofa and visibly winced as he leaned down to kick off his shoes.
“No, really though!" Ron leaned forward to look down the bar at Malfoy, but nearly fell off his stool. "Malfoy, you wouldn’t believe it. I remember the days when so many strangers would try to flirt with Harry that we would have to cast sobering charms so as to not die of alcohol poisoning by the end of the night.”
When he had finished, James instantly gasped and scrambled to his feet, his eyes wide. "Holy shit," James breathed, blinking at Draco. "You're in love with him."
Potter fell to his knees. Draco cried out and urged his legs to move faster as he readied his wand. “Expecto patronum,” he mumbled, sprinting so hard that he was barely capable of breathing. Nothing. Fuck. He had never really managed this before. Not a full patronus. But he couldn’t fail this time. For Harry’s sake, he couldn’t fail.
“N-no,” one squeaked. Draco practically felt like he was back in front of a classroom. Merlin, was he really this easily persuaded at that age?
, wasn’t it? He groaned and gripped his hands to the sides of his head. He didn’t know how much time had passed, but finally the room stopped spinning. Finally he began to feel normal. He groaned and slowly pushed himself up to sit on the floor. “What the--”

in a wide variety of ways. The night Potter had said his surname at the trapdoor to the dungeon had been playful. This, most definitely, was not. Perhaps Draco
Draco stood by the gargoyle, tapping his foot while he waited for dinner to be announced. There was no sign of Granger, and none of the other professors had spoken a word to him. None of them even acknowledged his existence. He may as well have been the gargoyle.
“Milk, please.” Draco’s frustration about the closet incident melted as he saw a full, proper wizard tea spread out before him. There were fancy teacups and a silver milk pitcher and everything. It reminded him of his mother’s afternoon tea.
, one went and burned to death before his very eyes, and most of the others ended up in Azkaban. He couldn't deal with any more of that now; he was focusing on his career.
Potter’s eyes widened and he blinked rapidly, as if regaining focus and seeing Draco for the first time. Potter lifted the tips of his fingers to his own lips. Draco could imagine what Potter felt, because Draco could feel it too: the lingering heat tingling at the corner of his mouth, as if he had just picked up the perfect wand in Ollivander's shop. The kiss, brief as it had been, was resonating with him in a way that only a perfect wand could, sending a magical warmth through his body and shooting invisible sparks throughout the room. Maybe that golden feeling last night
Nonetheless, Draco still found himself standing on the battlements in the snow in the evenings, watching Potter patrol the grounds. Draco wasn’t about to let another dementor incident happen again. It didn’t matter that Potter wasn’t speaking to him; he still dreaded the thought of Harry being unable to defend himself. For as long as he was still at Hogwarts, he may as well make himself useful.
Draco shrugged. “I suppose I’ll come back to Hogwarts and continue my research there, if it’s alright with Granger. You’re stuck with me.”
James was running toward the door and Draco was tempted to Obliviate him; he had never intended for this to happen. He never should have dabbled in the first place. He should have known that his stupid emotions would somehow get in the way; it was why he tried to avoid them in the first place.
to himself like a goddamned lunatic. Draco walked past his quarters and veered down the next hallway. He didn’t stop until he was standing directly in front of Potter’s door. Seeing as his hands were full, he kicked against the wood a couple of times with his shoe.
serious. He was a professional, after all. He needed this job to continue his research. He felt his mouth twitching against a grin. Potter was

Rather than deprive you of daily updates, I may need to split some of them in half (like this one) depending on what I can accomplish each day.

. Who the hell would want to sit with him while he ran potions experiments? “I don’t suppose you would be interested, Granger?”
“What?” Draco asked as externally calmly as if these were strangers who were there to move his furniture. On the inside, however, Draco was terrified. Had James said something? Tattled on him? His eyes darted questioningly to James, but James wasn’t paying any attention.
“I have to ask,” Potter said softly, allowing the door to swing nearly-closed behind him but not letting it latch. “Does the thought of me half-naked in your bedroom make you ill too?”
Then he took the dropper and allowed three drops to fall onto his tongue. Draco relaxed onto his mountain of pillows as Potter took his journal and the potion back to his desk. So far the potion gave him a dizzyingly elated sort of feeling, but with Potter nearby that might not have been the potion at all.
Draco cursed under his breath as Potter fully collapsed onto the ground. There was only one real way to cast a Patronus, and it meant forcing himself to feel, really
Weasley crossed the room and met Potter in the wide space between the loo and the bar. “Nice shirt, mate,” Weasley said, extending his arm straight as a board and slapping Harry twice on the top of the shoulder.
"You know perfectly well how I feel about your father, James. I'll protect him with my life. You have my word."
friends. That was why he should be perfectly content to stare at his watch as though it was the most fascinating thing in the world. That was why he stood a little straighter beside the gargoyle, trying to appear purposeful rather than rejected.
“Shut up, Malfoy.” But the words lacked edge. Potter spoke them in the same tone that someone might say:
Draco returned to the congested waiting room and found a crooked empty bench against a wall. He sat and closed his eyes. He tried not to let his mind drift, but it did anyway. It drifted to Potter’s hand on his at dinner, the comforting sight of Potter wearing his clothes that morning, and Potter’s soft kiss goodbye. The plan was to leave. Yes, the plan was to leave. Yet somehow, between Mr. Wilson’s invitation to the Ministry and Harry sleepily asking him to stay, leaving felt less important than it once had. In fact, the thought of leaving filled him with a painful, sorrowful emptiness. He kept trying to push the feelings to the back of his mind and pack them away like he usually did, but they refused to budge. Draco decided to review his research journal to distract himself from his thoughts. As he leaned forward to open his dragon leather satchel, however, it tipped onto its side. A small glass vial rolled out of the front pocket and onto the floor. Draco snatched it up and stared.
, and now you’re going to be fine.” She burst into giddy laughter, and then leaned in and hugged him. She actually
Then he clenched his hands into fists, folded them onto the desk in front of him, and allowed his forehead to collapse against the wood.
Rather than digging for his watch, he cast a quick Tempus charm. He was on time; the portkey should be active. He lifted his eyes to the magical floating numbers and letters that displayed all portkey departures and arrivals. Every portkey had been delayed by several hours. Every. Single. One.
“I’m telling you, you really need to lose this thing for blondes, mate. Next thing you know, you’ll be going home with
of love to him. Draco felt something warm and aching tightening in his chest. Merlin, this was what it felt like. This is what it had always felt like. This was love. Love for his father. Love for his mother. It was so very different from the cold emptiness he felt toward his Aunt Bella. Because, as the dementors had proved to him, that’s what hate really was. It was cold, and it was empty.
“Found it!” she said, trying to open his mouth. But his mouth wouldn’t open. It had gone numb. He felt as though he were turning to stone. He felt as though he were actually
never expected Harry to be so aware of his emotions at that age—so conflicted about Draco, even then, that he could be a mess of anger one moment and wanking to the thought of him the next.
It wasn’t exactly a feeling anyone was expected to feel toward one's enemies, or even ex-enemies. It felt more like...well...no. Draco still refused to believe he
Harry arced up and bit Draco's lower lip, pulling Draco down on top of him and running his tongue along Draco’s lips before pushing between them. Draco groaned as the heat of Harry’s center met his--the tickling of hair against his bare flesh, the way their hardened cocks pressed together. Draco thought he would lose himself in it--in mouths and skin and the way they were grinding together in a way that made Draco’s head spin. Just as Draco feared he would lose himself right then and there, Harry rolled them over until Draco was beneath him, then bent down and took one of Draco’s nipples in his mouth, running it beneath his tongue. The sensation of golden heat was overwhelming.

There was nothing left for him to do. He had failed. He hadn’t found it. He could go back to the museum, or maybe Carter’s estate, or maybe review the ancient texts again, or keep hunting through Egyptian tombs near Hannu's.

entirely been the alcohol after all. Well, Draco was doomed. There would be no going back from this. With one stupid, half-arsed kiss, Potter had ruined him for the rest of his life. Ruined him for anyone else. Brainless twit.
The dementors were pulled into the blinding light as quickly as they had appeared. The chorus of their whispered shrieks echoed around the empty ballroom and Draco cringed against the miserable sound. Then the dark portal in the ceiling was spinning. Shrinking. Shrinking down to the size of an orb. Until it
that all Draco wanted to do was pull Harry into his arms, kiss his forehead, and hold him tight. In this stage of Potter’s life, Draco had been nothing but cruel and insensitive, delighting in every opportunity to get under Harry's skin by bullying him and his friends. Yet despite everything, Harry was still
The only person Potter had ever tried to bring home from a pub was a male Death Eater? Maybe Potter wasn’t even remotely as straight-ish as he thought. He was a beautiful, queer blur, and Draco had now completely lost the power of his defensive chant. Married? Not anymore. With Children? Yes, but they weren’t so bad; he was even growing fond of them. Straight as an arrow? Most definitely not.
Potter finally scooted back until he was sitting at the edge of the bed, allowing one foot to dangle toward the floor. They were both still wearing their shoes. “What’s wrong? Is it too fast? It’s too fast, isn’t it?" Draco almost laughed. He'd wanted some version of this for twenty years. It was
Draco reached for the second photograph. "In Wizarding hieroglyphs, the symbol for healing and the symbol for light are often interchangeable. But if you interpret this symbol as Muggle instead of Wizard, it means heart.
Draco crept back into the hallway to make sure it was clear before leading James toward the nearest palace exit. Draco reached for the narrow wooden door and pushed it open slightly, assessing the situation outside. The door opened into a narrow alley that appeared to connect to the gardens. There were still people wandering the gardens as though nothing was wrong; maybe they didn't even
they were dealing with, because this potion was entirely unique. Now Draco was wondering if Potion Four had somehow leaked onto his clothes or fingers that night at the pub and made its way into his system; it was far more rational than believing that he and Potter had some sort of golden magical connection, yet
“What? Oh. I...” Potter's face reddened. “I don’t know, I was still half asleep. I guess I was thinking of...er...a dream I had. And what I would like to be doing about it.”
“You are dismissed.” And with a wave of his wand, Draco transported the entire mess onto young Mr. Potter’s pillow.
!” Potter insisted, looking at Draco with a small smile. “James, you and I will try one round against Professor Malfoy and Lily. Whichever team catches the snitch first wins. Ready?”
When Draco appeared at the front gates, he hadn’t expected much. He had expected a crumbling mansion, filled with traces of dark magic and evil energy. As he walked through the gates and toward the main doors, however, he found that it looked pristine in the evening light. Draco had expected a ruin, but the Manor was as beautiful as the day he was born.
Harry was on the ground in the center of the ballroom. His body was sprawled in an almost unnatural position, and he was squirming and gasping for breath on the floor, barely capable of gurgling his cries of pain. His glasses had been knocked from his face, and his red robes were stretched behind him on the tiled floor.
“Go jump in the lake,” Malfoy mumbled, stepping out of the dungeon alcove and into the hallway. So much for  professionalism. There was something notably miraculous about Potter’s ability to transform him into a teen-aged boy. Maybe the Fountain of Youth was right under his nose. Maybe the Fountain of Youth was really Harry Potter, and all he had to do was jab a dozen needles into his neck to extract it. Gladly. Maybe then Potter wouldn’t look so bloody pleased with himself. Or maybe he would.
As if reading his mind, Albus reached into his pocket and pulled out a wrinkled, folded newspaper clipping. Draco took it. In large, sprawling letters across the top  were the words: GINEVRA POTTER MURDERED BY DEATH EATER.
Potter’s words were all softness and honesty, and Draco felt himself shiver as Potter said his first name.
was the one that you gave me," Draco felt his frustration creeping into his voice. "Apparently you thought that the potions tucked away by the books on the back of my desk took priority over the ones prominently near the front of my desk. Potion Four was tucked away, because in my tests it was exhibiting love-potion-like tendencies.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter,” Draco said, with equal teasing in his voice, “because I want to kill you myself.”
Despite the apology, he and Harry still avoided each other as the weeks progressed. For his part, Draco avoided Harry because he suspected that they would inevitably fall into old habits and Harry would hate him again. Avoidance was a far more reliable tactic than opening himself to be hurt, was it not? It was certainly safer. Besides, when Draco had boarded the Hogwarts Express, he had no idea that Harry would be waiting for him at the other end of it. He was only here for his research, and then he would gone. He'd already made his decision. He'd made it before he had even arrived. He would finish his potions research, and then he would leave. There was no point in brooding over a man that had never really been his in the first place.
“Fuck, you’re tight,” Draco breathed finally, not trusting himself to move or he might come before he had even started.
, mate.” Weasley said. When the bartender returned, Weasley slid another shot toward Draco and set one in front of Potter. “Cheers,” he said, lifting one of the shot glasses.
Apparently Cornelius had abandoned his research altogether to pursue his gossipy editorials full-time. Cornelius’ eyes flashed to Draco, and Draco couldn’t speak. His heart was racing. He wasn’t sure what to feel. He was suddenly back to that morning at the caravan in Norway--abandoned and alone, all because of one life-altering mistake.
The entire newspaper was filled with discussions about the day: schedules, speeches, honoured guests, food offered, items sold, war funds, hopes, concerns. There were photos of Granger, Longbottom, Weasley, and even Weasley’s mother. There were photos of the Minister of Magic and her cabinet. There was a photo of Ms. Randhawa and Mr. Wilson. There was, of course, a large photo of Harry Potter on the front page, featured as the grand guest of honour. There was another article anticipating Potter’s return to society. There was gossip and conjecture. There was a small article addressing concerns about safety; apparently there had been a number of Death Eater threats leading up to the event, but the place would be crawling with Aurors and everything would be securely warded.
It was time to take his father’s place. It was time to reintroduce the Malfoy name into high society.
Finally, he went back to Potter’s room and sighed, allowing himself to sink to the floor by Harry’s bed. Harry was sleeping now, and even this younger version of Harry looked like
him anything. But James may have...” Potter sighed. “He may have discovered a few things about you on his own. He’s very protective of me, and he--”
“I’m not very good at it,” he shrugged. “I like having two feet on the ground. Besides, Rose is meeting me out here in a minute.” Draco stepped a little closer and saw that Albus was reading a Potions book, but it wasn’t anything Draco had assigned. “May I join you for a moment? I could use a rest.”
wearing his work trousers, and usually he would protest to anything ruining perfectly good dress trousers, but this was a special case.
of the train wheels, Draco knew he only had a few minutes left before his arrival. He had to finalize his plan.
“Oh, thank Salazar,” Granger said, collapsing onto the bed next to him. “You nearly gave me a heart attack. I thought you were going to die. I thought you were going to actually
"I didn't realize that spell worked on people.” Draco slid his thumb along the fabric at Harry’s wrist and then dipped beneath it just long enough to
“Here, try.” Draco got on one knee and tapped it. Potter stepped on his thigh, the rubber bottoms of his trainers cold through Draco's trousers. Draco was
“Malfoy!” Potter chased after him. Draco was certainly popular today. “I need to talk to you.” Draco noted the sternness of his voice. Potter had always utilized the word
The crowd was loving it, too. After the initial shock had worn away, they were gasping and clapping in delight.
Harry's eyes were wide open, staring down at Draco's stroking hand. When Harry's eyes flicked to Draco's face, there was no longer any denying what they were doing. Merlin, they were staring right at each other. This had gone way too far, but there was hardly any stopping it now. It felt almost surreal. They were both horny and half-asleep and fucking
Draco could feel Harry stiffen beside him, could see his fingers tightening around his knees. Draco pressed his hand gently to Harry’s thigh. “Of course it’s difficult, Mr. Wilson, you understand. Although speaking of managing, how is the economy in the Herbology sector these days? I’ve heard it can be as volatile as a Hungarian Horntail. A difficult Herbology market can make life difficult for a Potions Master, you understand.”
Another door flew open from his wall. “Oh! Mr. Malfoy, sir, I brought help!” the house elf cried eagerly.
Harry smiled nervously up at him. “I don’t know how you do it. I’m no good at this. You’re sure you can’t stay? Guide me through it?”
Draco turned around to see that Potter had gotten distracted by a poster on the wall, and was now walking back toward the bar, seemingly oblivious to what had just transpired, the charming, brainless twit. It was probably just the alcohol imitating the feeling of anticipation and desire in his gut. And his mind was only pretending that Potter was the most gorgeous creature he had ever seen in his fucking life, in preparation for what he was about to do. His stomach clenched as he watched Harry approach, pushing a wild lock of dark hair out of his eyes.
Draco threw the covers over their heads as they pressed their mouths together, giggling like schoolboys.
Before them was a large, elegant room with a small kitchen, a large mirror, a desk, a sofa, and a coffee table. Nearly everything in the room was gilded and glittering. It was clean and lovely, but that’s not what had captured Draco’s attention. What had captured Draco’s attention was the fact that the room had only one bed. One very large, beautiful bed.
