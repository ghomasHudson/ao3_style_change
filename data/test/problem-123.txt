“My waist,” he clarified. “Being held there. I uh, it just reminds me of some things I’d rather not think about.”
Harry Potter, the man he’d spent the last year forgetting about, was right there. Draco’s chest was tight, the cinnamon shaker in his hand tipping, letting out a puff of cinnamon that made him want to sneeze but he didn’t dare move, not when the personification of both his desires and his self-hatred was standing in front of him and— hold up— ordering a
They were in a broom closet at Warthogs. This last fight had been particularly homoerotic, and all the tension built up over years of being at each other’s throats had led them here. It seems that tension would soon be released.
“Maybe,” shrugged Kumara, “it’s not too late.”
Malfoy looked up as the door swung open. The nurse said something that no one bothered to listen to, and the door closed, leaving silence hovering between them.
James took an odd job or two running errands. By the time he knew cocaine hid in those envelopes and weapons lie cradled in those packages, he didn’t want out. “Crime” is a harsh word for survival, and “mafia” is just a pseudonym for family. When he told her, she didn’t beg him to leave — she demanded to be let in.
“I’d argue that it’s a lot better,” said Harry lowly. He stepped toward him. “People die no matter what, but when it’s the killing curse? It’s intentional. You have to mean it.”
Squinting, he saw that he was taller, and had a slender face and dark eyes. He had a softness about him that was nothing like the war-torn ferocity of the Chosen One.
Plopped into a new school in a new town, his past curled into twisted memories. He was sick of the secrecy that had raised him and ripped him apart and still shimmered in his parents’ eyes no matter how much they loved him.
Ron had been trying to set up the both of them for months now. Since Ginny broke up with Harry and Hermione expressed the need to focus on herself and her career, the redhead had declared them bachelors and done everything in his power to fill the void these two strong young women in their lives had left. So far, no success. Their shared apartment continued to get quieter and messier.
“It’s a nergelnut. It grants a person one wish. You only have to think about it.”
And then warmth covered his fingers and a flutter brought him back into his own body.
Malfoy frowned. Harry brushed strands of blond hair out of his face and muttered “This’ll only take a minute. Then both of us can get to sleep and pretend it never happened.” But Malfoy didn’t seem to register his words. His gaze stayed trained on Harry, who was gently sweeping a cool cloth across his damp forehead.
He lurched back, choking. “What have you done to my chocolate?”
“Would you listen to someone else for once?! Harry look at me!”
“Nothing.” Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was getting at, he just knew there was a lot of hurt in the way Malfoy had talked about his father. “Pass the pepper?”
A few unique-looking potted plants sat scattered among the bindings, presumably gifts from Neville. Swirling slowly across the ceiling was this relaxing blue and purple mist.
Getting this guy into bed is a rollercoatser...
“Well, yes—“
• • •
Kumara’s fingers brushed Draco’s. Then they brushed Draco’s hip.
To most of the Wizarding world, he was a two-dimensional hero who knew where to go from here. But Draco saw him, uncertainty and all, and he cared. Harry didn’t know how to convey how much it he loved that.
“Yeah. I suppose I really am.”
“When I thought you were out of my life for good they kept plastering your face all over the news, milking every last drop of Harry-the Savior-Potter. But this last year or so... my life was finally starting to go somewhere.” Malfoy’s voice broke.
Gun metal seared his skin.
“Do you fly? Anymore, I mean,” Draco asked.
Draco itched his nose, trying to conceal his flush. “You’re not half bad yourself. You―”
“Alright, alright, but he sure didn’t bring any peace to my dreams. Lemme tell ya, first it was Neville and I on that one staircase in Hogwarts, you know with the really weird portrait of the baby, except the stairs were made of-“
RITA: It's good of you to want to be involved. Do you think they could use a little help running the school?
Emina swore loudly and Harry tore his eyes away from Malfoy. He used a spell to clean up her dress, not realizing his mistake until a spray of soap shot from his wand for the second time in 24 hours. She shrieked and announced her departure. Harry tried to offer help, but to his relief she stormed out and slammed the door behind her.
They concluded by giving each other a quick peck on the lips.
Harry didn’t understand why Malfoy was so worked up. “You confessed your undying love for me,” he said sarcastically, and while thanks to the stupid charm, part of him almost wished that were true, he intended it as a clever remark.
The redhead squinted his eyes. “Alright. Well you just let me know if I need to beat that bloody idiot up for you. Self-righteous walnut thinks he can go around stirring up trouble and making other people clean up after him.”
Harry had seen Malfoy angry. He’d seen him scared, and ashamed, but this was the first time he’d seen him look remorseful.
“We started having these arguments. About silly things, I don’t even know what. But she kept saying... it kept coming back to her feeling like I didn’t love her like that. Not enough, anyway.
Harry’s eyes widened for a millisecond, but then he shrugged. “Well, you have it now.”
Just another fucking Harry Potter look-alike.
“Oh.” Draco had never known much about Harry Potter’s home life; he assumed they, too, had treated him like a savior. Maybe not.
“What, can’t take a joke?” Harry adjusted his jumper, not looking at Draco. “Let’s go back.” He grabbed his wrist and the world twisted, Draco’s insides wringing out like a wet towel.
The words hurt like hell, and flooded him with relief. They hadn’t talked about it—not really—and now Potter was speaking daggers into him, vocalizing Draco’s own self-loathing, and he deserved it.
Malfoy yawned, and the moment Harry pulled away, he slumped over onto the bed. Harry had to yank the blanket out from under him to get it on top of him.
RITA: Do your own traumatic memories keep you up at night?
There conversations moved to lighter topics as the sky got darker. Among pleasant chatter, they finished their milkshakes, touched hands multiple times as they refilled their glasses with rum, looked at the stars, and looked at each other. Before long, Harry found himself wanting to tell Malfoy the truth about his job.
“Hermione, what Draco said this morning? Please tell me I’m being daft. You know I’m not good with these things, tell me I suck at interpreting romantic stuff and I’ve got it all wrong.”
“You know what happened to his parents?”
“How on earth do you know what that nasty thing’s called?” Harry was pretty sure he hadn’t said its name, because he couldn’t keep it straight.
“Put the spoon down. I work tomorrow, I can’t have you keeping me up for... for... for this.”
“Harry Potter,” he said reluctantly, partaking in the handshake and eyeing the way Kumara’s other hand rested on Malfoy’s back.
Harry waited for a response and received only a frown.
RITA: You want to become friends with Draco Malfoy?
“I don’t need saving-“
The crowd was gathered around the wizard on this end of the fight, and the whole lot seemed to be jeering at Malfoy. He must have done something to really piss them off. The bastard probably deserved what was coming to him, but Harry let his Auror instincts kick in as Malfoy’s rival raised his wand menacingly.
She flung her arms around him and squeezed. “Oh Harry, I’ve missed you!” He hugged her back, not wanting to let go.
If only they stumbled upon one another in crisis more often.
Draco kissed the other like he had never kissed before, and Harry melted as if he were the vanilla ice cream they’d shared on that first night. As they wound their arms around each other, their friends and vague enemies forming a loose circle around them and beginning to clap, a moth fluttered by and glared at the scene.
“Flopping around on the pitch like some sad worm.”
“—so I’m sorry for that. And… And when she was… When you were at the manor, and my aunt… my aunt was
Harry, baffled by how far the two of them had come just in the past hour, racked his brain for some sort of smart remark. Before he could respond, though, Malfoy took his hand.
“Oh, it’s working alright.”
“Finally, you’re home!” exclaimed Ron. “Red shirt, or blue?” He emerged from his room holding two nearly-identical long sleeved t-shirts.
,” Kumara said, stepping closer, “I think things could have gone down a much more interesting path.” He smiled playfully.
RITA: [ she smiles sympathetically and pats his knee ] Thank you so much for being willing to chat with me, love, I know it must be difficult to talk about these things.
Harry laughed, the sound bright with disbelief, and bit his tongue before he said anything stupid to his boss.
“No. No no no no no no no. There is no way we’re letting Draco bloody Malfoy into our flat!”
Smoke alarm screams filled the flat.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, his hand resting awkwardly on the sheet. “I just wanted to... Never mind, it—“ He inhaled sharply as a cool, slender hand curled around his.
“I think the fucked up part is telling me you pretended I was someone else. Definitely should’ve kept that to yourself.”
Then another.
She asked to see it, so he fished the dumb thing from the bottom of his bag and placed it in her hand.
“Hold up,” said Malfoy, stepping toward Harry and waving his hand in front of his face as if to break him from a trance. “I’m entirely lost, am I the only one who’s entirely lost?”
The stupid squashed bug was useless. His date was awful, and he couldn’t think of anyone else he knew that could possibly be interested in him. And on top of all that, he just got stood up. Not in a romantic way, though, not — It was just unfortunate that in addition to having no love life, even Malfoy didn’t have any interest in interacting with him. Anyway. Luna’s charm clearly wasn’t working.
But then Malfoy seemed to be leaning forward, and when they were only a hair away from touching, the glimmer of doubt slipped back in and Harry sat up.
“Say no more,” hissed Harry.
HARRY: [ just
Harry couldn’t tell whether or not he was being sarcastic, but he was clearly getting drowsier by the second and getting him to clean himself wasn’t worth the effort. “You look downright awful.” He lowered onto his knees so he could reach Malfoy's annoyingly angular face.
“But, isn’t that a muggle thing? You grew up with muggles, right?”
Draco nearly made a quip about how he could just set it down on the bleachers or his lap, but he took the cloth from Harry.
He knew his cheeks were hollow. He knew his bones jutted sharply, blue veins crawling up his skinny arms. He dabbed concealer under his eyes and cut his hair along the sides, but he was no better than any of these boy-loving freaks.
HARRY: [ he's very pleasant at first, the smile maybe not
“As far as curses go, it could be worse.”
“Yeah, whatever. Apparate us home?”
Draco’s gut plummeted. “What?”
“Is there a problem?” Draco asked icily, daring him to mention the tears.
HARRY: [ oh ffs that
Who would ever want to hurt such a pitiful gay bottom (power bottom on a good day) like him? What, poor people? Because they were jealous? Clearly they didn’t understand that it’s hard being rich. A rich, white, sexy bottom with a sexy bottom. Those were his only personality traits, honestly ― those, and being attracted to Harry Potter.
“I feel like I gave them lots of chances.”
He glanced at Kumara one last time, tall and slim and soft, and they locked eyes. Expressions flitted across the stranger’s face and his mouth moved to form words.
The stranger’s eyes were sharp, but they softened, and he laughed awkwardly. “That was… an intense reaction, I didn’t mean to… sorry. Boundaries, I guess. I’ve got some weird ones. Had a few too many unpleasant experiences, you know what I mean?”
Stay alive, he thought.
They apparated from the hallway. Harry felt the familiar hum through his body as they teleported, but there was something stronger about it this time. Something that buzzed through his very fingertips.
“But dude, homie, pal. For real. If it means you’ll stop moping around all the time, I’m in full support.”
“How old. Is your spinach?”
“It’s okay,” reassured Harry, “you got this, just PUUUSSSHHH!”
Their hands brushed for the fifth time in two days, if you count apparating. Harry began re-assembling the gun.
He’d been swallowing his stress, but now he let it rise in his throat like bile.
Their mouths collided. Skin on skin, heat flaring between them, hands everywhere and urgent. The man bit Draco’s lip gently. Draco whimpered, cursing himself for it, but the man ground more fiercely against him and did it again.
“Seems so.”
Lust was both sickening and blissful. Fucking was both traumatic and necessary for survival.
Real laughter bubbled from Draco and caught him by surprise. “Potter,” he said condescendingly, though the effect was marred by giggles, “I went through that much effort to make your life miserable and that’s what you reduce me to?”
Harry’s kiss was hungry. Draco wished he would devour him and leave nothing behind.
At that, Draco snapped his eyes all the way open.
Hermione was staying at Grimmauld Place while she saved up for a flat, and he got glimpses into the world of magical law through notes scribbled on coffee-stained napkins, parchment scattered across the long oak table, and late night ramblings by the fire, so sure, he’d had a heads up. But the last person he imagined he’d be ordered to spy on was his school rival, war criminal, and overall scumbag Draco Malfoy.
“Don’t patronize me, Potter,” Draco said, scowling.
“I’m sorry for insulting Ron Weasley. And all of them, for that matter. They’re, each of them, they’re better people than my family combined, and I think I was…” Malfoy looked like he was in physical pain, “jealous, in a way.”
It was comfortable. New, and most certainly temporary, but nice. So he tried to muster all the reassurance he could, keeping his gaze steady.
Nausea seized Draco at the mere thought of food. He preferred to avoid it. But when he crept into the dark kitchen to decline, Kumara already had a spatula pointed at him and a question on his lips.
“One of them,” said Draco.
Mother always said rain washed away your sins. It was likely a desperate attempt to cope with her own plethora of misdeeds, but it stuck with Draco nonetheless, and though he knew he’d racked up enough sins to go to Hell twice, there was still something refreshing about the misty blue morning. He shut the door behind him, breathed out the stale air of his flat, and breathed in the moisture.
“This, I think.”
Fun fact: Daniel RADcliffe’s favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate. Tom-the-rapper-Felton’s is too, but mint chocolate chip is the most Malfoy thing I’ve ever heard of. Plus, it’s my favorite.
“Uh, hey.” Harry cursed himself for talking to an inanimate object. He then carried on talking to it. “Luna’s a bit odd. She believes in the things she talks about, and I admire that, I just don’t think they amount to much in reality. That being said, the strange things she goes on about nearly always end up having something to them.
“What? Oh, yeah, yes.” He looked down at the menu, and it was proving more difficult to decipher than ancient runes.
A single tear rolled down Draco’s porcelain cheek. Here he was, on trial, as if he’d ever done anything wrong in his entire life. Sure, he passed out slurs like candy on the fourth of July, terrorized anyone with less social status than him, let murderers into Hogwarts, and stood by as people were tortured and killed, but who doesn’t love a bad boi? A little terrorism is sexy.
“Bet you thought you’d seen the last of me,” he said in a sultry voice that sent shivers down Draco’s back. Also his legs. Also his neck, and like, his fingertips; basically, he was a shivering boy. Think polar bear but sexier. Like, a naked polar bear.
He had forgotten what it felt like to be held.
Apparently food didn’t come easy when the Ministry stripped you of your fortune and no one in the Wizarding World would hire you. Not that he blamed them. He deserved every icy glare, every pang of hunger, every nightmare.
“No, yeah, I was... kidding too. Fooled your gullible arse. Just thought it’d be funny to see the look on your face. If I played along, you know?”
Button undone, zipper slid down.
• • •
“Yes?”
“Incredible. Forgot what that was like.”
He didn’t. He owed this man nothing. He was miserably embarrassed, and this man had no business exploiting that.
“Dray!”
“Sorry ma’am, I-“
Memories of the Manor flitted like ghosts at the edge of his vision; ice in Aunt Bella’s eyes, bars through which he and Luna exchanged whispers, the cold weight of guilt.
Harry’s carefree happiness had him on a high that made him forget every reason this was a bad idea.
RITA: Of course. You have every right to stand by that story; I won't press the issue. I must ask, though, dear, how does the Weasley girl feel about your sexual escapades?
“My dad has one too,” Draco said, wincing. “The family secret.”
Draco laughed dryly. “Unimaginable things.”
“Harry, that’s completely beside the point. Which one looks better with my hair?”
The subway seemed more dreary than normal, and that was saying something. It squealed to a stop again and an old man shuffled off.
“Great. Figured. Anyway, Granger. I was a massive prick toward her even though she’s twice as intelligent—“
Shakily, Draco breathed.
“It’s time,” said Harry lowly. “Which hole?”
RITA: Lovely [ and boring, she thinks ]. Are you concerned about your lack of intelligence due to leaving school early?
A shithead, yes. There was no denying that. But a boy with a lot of hurt? He was that, too. And as rotten as he’d been, it hadn’t stopped Harry from living a hell of a life.
“In…?” Kumara asked.
The words were out before Draco could convince himself he shouldn’t say them. “And you want to relive that?”
He snorted. “Shut up. 19 isn’t even that old.”
“Wait a second, are those my shirts?”
Draco grabbed his fork and gestured at Harry. “You, okay, even you have to admit that was pretty hilarious.”
“No. But I wanted to.” He blurted the words before he could change his mind.
His stomach plummeted.
“Awwwwh,” said Mindy. “Have a milkshake.” She handed a strawberry milkshake to the woman who’d stormed out on Harry in the middle of a miserable date, who took it with a scowl.
But the stranger rolled away. “You okay?” he repeated.
“Not what I― “ started Harry, but Malfoy interrupted him. “Make me.”
“EXPELLIARMUS!” With a simple yell of his go-to spell, the man was disarmed. Before his audience took over the attack, Harry sent a series of mild stunning spells. They flew in beams of light through the air one after another, stalling the group long enough to turn to his petty school nemesis.
Hermione’s office was filled with books. She had four bookshelves; three of them were large and made of dark wood while the other was small and carved with intricate designs. Everything from old, dusty volumes to the latest research journals lined the shelves, and as if that wasn’t enough, she had stacks all the way to the ceiling and a pile on her desk.
“Great. Seeya, Dray.” He winked, Malfoy glared, and then it was just the two of them standing in the kitchen.
Kumara turned the blender on. The sound clanged in Harry’s head. “What was that?” Kumara asked.
Back to back, like true warriors, Harry set to work putting out the fire while Ron created more chaos.
Draco said.
night? Stop being so ignorant, Potter, it’s not a sexy look on you.”
He placed each gentle, wet kiss like an apology, leaving a trail of repentance.
“Oi, keep quiet out there!” called Ron from his room.
The rap came again. “Morning, Potter. Breakfast in 10.” Footsteps disappeared down the hall.
“Seen much of your old friends lately?” he asked. If they were planning some terrorist attack, they’d have to unify again first.
Malfoy’s moral compass was finally decently aligned, and he stood up for what he believed was right. To see that kind of bravery in a Slytherin was impressive. He supposed it wasn’t all that different from when he’d protected Harry from being turned over to Voldemort even though he was told by his own family to identify him, but Malfoy was proving again and again what a fundamental part of him that sort of behavior had become.
The two of them managed to get things cleaned up pretty quickly. After complaining loudly about Harry’s recent absence around the flat, Ron gave him an affectionate pat on the back and wished him a good day at work.
Harry‘s eyes trailed the slashes than ran across his cheek, his neck, his chest... “I’m sorry.”
“Ron, I’m serious, we can’t just leave him here!”
Harry Potter. The bane of his existence and the light of his life. His Chosen One, He Who Must Be Named, the Boy Who Lived to Torture his Soul with those Cruel Glares and Sarcastic Remarks. Harry Potter wouldn’t come today; Harry Potter wouldn’t ever come for him.
“Malfoy, I didn’t invite you in here to criticize my-“
“-when Draco bloody Malfoy walks over to us and gives you a big ol’ hug! Totally gross, am I right?”
“Of trying to figure out why I was so goddamn intrigued by you! Covering up my jealousy of every other person that got to be close to you with snide remarks! Trying to shut down my feelings by convincing myself and everybody else that you were a stuck up, spoiled, attention-seeking nobody!”
“Did you ever get with that other girl?”
“Not that I never have, I’m sure I must have, I just- Never mind.”
“Hey gorgeous, how’s London?”
“We’re here. Whether we like it or not, we’re here.“ Did Harry get it? He couldn’t go. He shouldn’t.
“Would you let me finish? You refused to tell me where you lived so I took you here. If I hadn’t interfered you very well may have died then and there. You’re welcome.”
“Lovely, I’ll just suffocate then,” said the shirt in front of him.
“You don’t think so? Bloody hell, Harry, lower your standards already.”
reaching his eyes, but it's good enough he figures ] I am, thank you Rita. And thank you for reaching out.
RITA: Of course. Now, what is the main thing you hope to accomplish by returning to Hogwarts?
“No!” the blond retorted childishly. “My ice cream. You don’t always get what you want, Potter, and it’s time you learned that.”
“Can you go any faster? I know you aren’t used to decent clothing, but honestly.”
In a tangle of fabric, the cotton tee came off. Draco’s gaze grazed bare skin. Harry’s bare skin.
“...What?”
“You bought him ice cream, but it had cashews in it, and he’s allergic to cashews so his face puffed up like a pufferfish with too much rouge and you made fun of him.”
Malfoy glared at him. “It’s only been 10 fucking years, did I forget to mention that part last night? 10 years of hiding it, and I did it bloody well, damn alcohol.”
“Why do you care?” he asked in a muddled voice, eyes drifting.
Malfoy smirked as he lifted his glass of mint chocolate chip and set to work. “So,” he said as casually as he could. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen that woman so friendly.”
A wrapper of some sort blew across the street in front of them, reflecting the many colors of the sky as pink and lavender clouds tumbled toward dusk. Music echoed fuzzily from a shop down the road. Harry’s right side was very warm and cozy.
“Well, yeah, I mean it sure seemed like it to me, but what do I know, right?”
“Don’t go,” thought Draco. He didn’t say it.
Harry almost reached over and put an arm around Ron. Almost. They fell back into silence.
“Well cozy him up in a dumpster then, he’ll fit right in.”
“Don’t give yourself that much credit.”
The stranger blinked and looked at him. “Ah shit. What’d I do, are you okay?”
His eyes dragged lazily across the crowd, laced with alcohol and grinding and laughter. It was pitiful, their starvation for attention.
Draco smirked.
“Uh... blue. Have you seen a tall, boring stack of yellow files anywhere? I can’t remember where I put them.”
He’d figured it was all part of the package.
“What?” Harry couldn’t figure out why on earth Malfoy was glaring at him.
“Yeah, sorry, he’s just, yeah.” Relationship? Harry barely had time to address that thought before he was in the hallway and Malfoy was saying something.
A baby was never the plan. But the young lovers vowed to grow old if only for the little life they’d created. They got hitched, got an apartment, and fell in love again every day because that was far more fun than falling out of it.
A screech sounded from outside.
“Yeah.” Harry sipped his milkshake and pondered how much to say to Malfoy, but words were coming out of his mouth before he knew it. “Sixth year, first. The war put things on hold, I guess. But afterward we picked it back up and we were fine, good, for a year or so.”
This wasn’t the broken boy in sixth year, bleeding and crying and desperate. It wasn’t the boy with dark circles and shaking hands caught on the wrong side of war, or the boy whose head hung with shame during the trial. This young man had proud shoulders and smiled at customers, and Harry hated him for it. He was a sad, despicable thing, and for him to pretend otherwise rubbed Harry the wrong way.
“I’m almost done,” said Harry, whose hot dog was still spraying like a garden hose. Finally, it slowed to a trickle, and he yanked the bratwurst, which was suddenly very limp and soft, out of one of Draco’s holes. It shriveled up like a raisin.
“Well!” said Kumara, pouring the mixture into glasses. “Hate to dip, but I have to walk my neighbor’s cat.”
A waiter approached the table, and Emina ordered a salad with no dressing and extra olives. Harry panicked and ordered the first thing he read on the menu, which was spaghetti.
He didn’t bother to ask.
“It was his hero complex, really. He was so perfect and I… I knew I could never be his hero so I tried for arch-nemesis instead. Anything to get that scrappy kid to look my way. And bloody hell, when he did, I…” Draco stopped himself, afraid of what he might say.
The door flung open and Harry’s parents stumbled in.
Something snapped inside him when he heard himself voice it.
Malfoy nodded. “Astoria... This woman Astoria and I were together for awhile. She broke it off for a similar reason.” He shrugged, but it was a tense movement. “I couldn’t let go of someone else.”
Suddenly, “Hello again!” came brightly from the door. Malfoy yanked his hand away and cold air took its place. Exhaling an awkward laugh, Harry reached his arm behind his head and rubbed his neck, and a glance at Malfoy revealed that his face was a bit flushed.
“How old is your spinach?” Emina fired back.
. ･ ✧ . ･ﾟ☆ . ･ﾟ✧ ･ﾟ
Sweeping his hair back, Ron squinted through the mingling crowd at a lady across the room. “I think I’ve found her. You know what this means; time to turn on the tact.”
Draco winced. This was not as he’d planned.
Suddenly, a crash echoed from around the corner. A shrill voice screamed “YOU DON’T KNOW A DAMN THING ABOUT MY FATHER!”
Harry ran his thumb across the back of Malfoy’s hand, which twitched slightly, but then Malfoy moved his index finger and did the same.
Harry sat down in the chair by the hospital bed. “You’re tying to tell me you got beat up because you defended someone else? That’s not the image I remember.”
Harry’s gut twisted with hatred.
“It’s not all that bad, though. The mold patches on the ceiling come in some fun shapes. See,” he flipped his phone camera, “that one’s a lopsided snitch.”
“Want another milkshake?” Mindy and her bright red lipstick were back at the counter.
Unbelievable. His father would most certainly― But then, just as his single tear plopped onto the cold, unforgiving ground, Golden Boy himself came swooping in. The Man, the Myth, the sexy motherfricker showed up at
“I missed you too, Hermione.” And as he uttered those words, he realized just how much he meant them.
“What was all that ruckus about, anyway?” Harry asked.
HARRY: Yeah, you're right. I considered staying away, but [ there's a much more genuine, fond smile ] Hogwarts is my home. Always has been. There will be difficulties in returning, but overall, it's for a positive experience.
of his ] Utterly orgasmic.
“Yum!” he exclaimed. “Pumpkin! Did you have some of that pumpkin bread for breakfast?” He swilled it around in his hands like a fine wine and smelt it. “Mmmmm, condensed milk.”
“No,” Malfoy said sharply. He continued in a rush. “What do you want?”
“I don’t know what that is,” smiled Draco beamingly, “but will you accept a kiss as payment instead?”
But something about the wind up in the bleachers made him feel reckless. Something about Potter’s wild hair and fierce eyes and strong arms made him feel like he could do anything.
Honestly, what did these people expect? For him to
“You're welcome.”
Harry darted his eyes back. “I’m here.”
Deep blue sky rolled in gently with the silence. Malfoy shot down his urge to make a comment about the Weasleys and instead let Harry process.
Because to love was one thing. Loving could be desperate and lost and unrequited. It could be snogging a stranger. It could be a pastel dream, slipped between pages of nightmares.
“Yeah, I’m a real comedian,” Harry replied, “but I’m not kidding right now, Draco. I’m into you.”
“It’s a weapon,” Draco said coolly, trying to swallow his panic. When the glass shattered, he was reminded of the permanence of death, and he couldn’t pretend anymore that this was merely a piece of metal.
Leaning down, Harry snogged him so hard that Harry’s own glasses careened off his face, flying across the room and hitting a random judge in the face.
This time, when he leaned down, it was to ask forgiveness. His lips landed on this stranger’s jaw and he imagined it was Harry’s.
His body felt so alive and his heart was soaring. He kissed the man harder, deeper, as if by snogging this stranger in the dark he could show Harry how much he wanted him. How much he cared.
How could he not?
. ] Right. You have to ask. Because of course, I had favourites, right? There had to be someone I cared about more than others? Well I'm afraid the list is long. Every death, every loss in that terrible war cut me deep. I carry them all with me every day, they're in my every action. No one death is worse than another. Of course, there were some more personal ones. But that doesn't mean one life was worth more than another.
• • •
“Well that’s convenient, because you still owe me a milkshake.”
Malfoy leaned forward onto the table, pointing a finger at Harry. “Now hold up. I’m clearly the bad guy here, but don’t play innocent.”
Harry leaned close, breath hot on Draco’s neck. “Bet you wish you could, huh, Malfoy?”
• • •
Harry pulled out his you-know-what and waggled his eyebrows at Draco. “Whaddaya think, D-man? You down for a little swish and flick?”
“You got it, mate.” Ron slid both the salt and pepper across the counter. He reached into the cupboard and grabbed a plate to pile the bacon on. They set the table and their conversation topics clicked back into the ordinary.
“Good, I need to use them before they go bad.” The bed creaked as he slid off.
Harry froze on the spot.
The subway must have continued moving because it arrived at Harry’s stop, but his brain was at a standstill. He made the automatic trip out of the station, into the Ministry, and up to his office. Harry Potter and his staticky brain sat cooped up in there in hazy panic until lunch rolled around.
“You know, Won Won, you could always track down Lavender Brown,” Harry offered only partially sarcastically.
RITA: Do you think Draco plans to move on?
So Draco stepped toward him. He didn’t know what Harry was asking for, or how this was supposed to play out.
“It’s— well, it sounds cheesy as shit,” began Kumara, “but it really is just time. Getting over someone takes time. You’ll be okay.”
Today, however, a calm settled between them. Perhaps their walk through the grounds, their conversation through dinner and dusk and into dark, had been cathartic.
Her chair was empty, so Harry assumed she’d stepped out. He sat on the edge of the desk while he waited and stared at the deeply colored penseive-like charm above him.
“Let’s have dinner together,” Kumara said, as if that was the next logical step in the conversation. Malfoy shot him a dirty look and Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
“I see the way you look at me.” He whispered it like it was a secret for just the two of them. “And I can’t say I haven’t thought about it too. I could give you what you want. If you ask for it,” Harry said, a low growl grating the edges of his voice and making Draco shiver.
As dusk begins to fall around us, Harry lets me in on the most heartbreaking aspect of the whole ordeal. All of this is a desperate attempt to make up for the loss of life that came about because of him. He freely admits that it’s his fault. “It was on me to stop it,” he says, voice low. “I didn't do it quick enough. It's on me.”
Draco let the smoke swallow them.
But somehow, lying here in a stranger’s bed, thinking about Harry Potter, Draco got a glimpse of what it might be to be
Leaning down, Draco dragged his tongue across his collarbone and pressed a leg between his legs. There was a groan, a grinding of hips. Draco’s pulse was thudding in more places than one.
“And I feel like you would’ve loved it if that rogue bludger  were after me,” Malfoy snapped.
He opened his mouth to say something but Harry beat him to the punch, stuttering “I swear I didn’t mean it, I didn’t know what I was doing, I didn’t think-“
“Yeah,” breathed the stranger, eyes crinkling with a smile. He leaned down and pressed his lips to Draco’s neck.
“Time.” He could practically see the gears turning in her head. “All the times you and Malfoy wound up together. Far too often to be coincidence. Harry, that first night when you rescued Malfoy from the bar fight, did you think to yourself at any point that evening or the next morning that you wanted to run into him more often?”
HARRY: [ his arms come up, crossing over his chest a little protectively. ] Oh you know, the kind where you almost get killed by Death Eaters. The fun stuff that gains you more life experience than any child could possibly need. [ raises a hand and gives a bitter smile ] Next question?
His thumb froze over the button. “Yeah?”
The nurse blinked at him. “Right. Well! I’m relieved to tell you that Draco is okay. The cuts were shallow, nothing serious, and he only needs an hours’ rest.” Harry let go of the breath he’d been holding onto. “By the time we’re done with him, he should be feeling even better than before this accident!”
Harry plopped down on the couch, fraying at the edges but otherwise in good condition. “Well? Are you gonna sit?”
Just then, the unsteady boy lurched against Harry and vomited all over his shoulder. Harry could feel the warm, chunky substance dripping down his back as he chocked out the the last word of his sentence. “...mess.”
One by one, members of the audience stood and began slowly clapping. The clapping erupted into cheers, and Draco tried to bring his own hands together in celebration of the green-eyed wonder, but they were bound by handcuffs, and not in the kinky way. Well, maybe in the kinky way, seeing as anything’s kinky if you squint hard enough. Ha,
Harry breathed out a laugh. “Scared, Malfoy?”
“From you!” Draco’s laugh caught in his throat as he realized what he’d said.
I run the mafia, dipshit, I can’t just ‘get a new job.’ It’s not like you make enough money with your peaceful intervention bullshit. What, you want fish sticks
Harry snorted. “Your hair...”
Harry blinked again. Shook his head. “10 years of... what?”
They were silent for a moment.
“Food?”
Ron’s face contorted in disgust as he plucked his wand from the sopping heap. “Hermione would have had this solved a while ago,” he murmured defeatedly.
Kumara was holding the door of the shop open wide and grinning. Draco shook his head. “Let all the rain in, would you?”
?” His forehead was dotted with beads of sweat, hair swept softly back, eyes icy. “I have a life,” he breathed, filling the air between them with the scent of coffee beans, “and I don’t need you interfering.”
“You did nothing wrong, mate, it’s just a weird thing of mine.”
“Don’t you dare feed him my bacon!” called Ron through the door. “I splurged on the thick cut stuff.”
And this sickly place, with its disorienting music and sticky surfaces. He fit right in.
“And I’m suppose to feel bad about that?”
“I put you through hell. For seven solid years I did everything I could to get you to pay attention to me all the while making your life miserable, just because — It doesn’t matter why, the point is I was cruel and selfish so don’t you dare try to repent to me, Potter.”
“Yeah, no, not forgiving you for that.”
The noise shook his whole body. Green light flashed in his mind, ribs rattling. A warm hand pressed against his back and he jerked away.
“Pasta prince.”
Draco zipped his jeans, eyes darting around the room for anything he might have brought, and made for the door.
He cleared his throat. “So you’re the one that left that sticky note.”
Harry swooshed his unruly raven locks, and he looked like Justin Bieber with a rat’s nest. So dreamy. Placing one foot in front of the other, as one does when one is walking, he walked toward Draco.
It took Harry a moment to realize what he’d said. Perhaps Draco hadn’t caught it, and they could breeze past the awkward slip up. But Draco looked a bit panicked.
“Oblivious beyond belief.”
“That’s it. I give up. The world is against me. I can’t even get along with a bloody scarf.”
And so they sat, allowing themselves to look at each other with kind eyes for a moment. This time, it wasn’t fueled by alcohol or tired delirium; it just was, and it did something nice to Harry’s chest that he couldn’t quite describe.
Harry thought about it for a moment. “I don’t think so.”
Harry didn’t know there had been tension built up inside of him, and yet it was as if a knot inside his chest unwound itself as Malfoy spoke. He felt validated.
RITA: [ she returns his laugh with a tight smile and batted eyelids ] What sort of fun experiences?
“We’re all fucked,” Potter concluded. “Don’t make such a big deal of it.” Just like that, his mask was back up. His shrug was casual, controlled.
“My apologies.”
Many drinks later they were stumbling down the road. As they passed a large, intricate clock on the side of a building with Roman Numerals that indicated it was nearing 11, Malfoy interrupted their laughter.
. ･ ✧ . ･ﾟ☆ . ･ﾟ✧ ･ﾟ
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Right now?”
“Look,” he said. “You’re not going to forgive me, and you shouldn’t. But while you’re in my home for some godforsaken reason, let’s get some things out in the open.”
The sky was just beginning to dim and a pleasant purple glow grazed the streets of Diagon Alley. They sat leaning against an old vacant building, very slightly pressing into one another.
“Just, just to tell you you’re free to go, sir.”
HARRY: [ he pauses and sighs. grits his teeth before nodding ] It was on me to stop it. I didn't do it quick enough. It's on me.
For the tenth time, Harry read the paragraph in front of him. The words still didn’t process.
“Let it go,” groaned Harry, swinging open the freezer. “What are we thinkin’, fish sticks?”
HARRY: [ she's hitting a nerve again here and it shows in the way he tenses up. brows furrowing and he shifts in his seat. there's a burst of laughter and his head tilts ] My relationship with Draco Malfoy? You mean the one where we were at one another's throats on and off the pitch? [ he shakes his head and looks away ] Like I've said, I'm here to move on from the people we were.
“Yeah, with the blue hair.”
Please tell me this is a bad dream. Not like the one with the water buffalos, that was killer, especially when Ginerva waved a red flag like she was some bullfighter, which, honestly, wouldn't be surprising with how buff she's getting thanks to quidditch, and—“
“Coming in here was one thing, merely an unfortunate coincidence, but
Harry grinned. He said nothing for fear of what sound might escape his mouth.
“Did you or did you not kiss Draco Malfoy?”
“This one kid, class clown type,” rambled Kumara, “he was always saying rude shit. Prejudice gets laughs, you know? I finally told him if he had a bone to pick with me he could meet me behind the school. The next morning, he was there, and he apologized. We became friends, don’t ask me how. He was the first boy I ever kissed.”
Harry is trying to sort things out; both facts and feelings. He does, and he doesn’t do it alone, for once. We get some more character variety in this chapter!
Nothing jumped out at Harry on the first page. Malfoy skirted Azkaban (thanks to Harry’s testimony), lost his fortune (which brought Harry far more joy than it ought to), rented a flat in Muggle London (presumably because he was too cowardly to show his face in wix society), and couldn’t get a job (who wants to hire a prissy little bitch, anyway?).
He knew this should be strange. He knew it wouldn't play out like this if it wasn’t so late, if Malfoy hadn’t had so much to drink, if Harry’s goddamn hero complex didn’t make half his decisions for him. But he pushed those thoughts from his mind and let himself enjoy this moment.
“It’s precious that you think you have any right to talk to me like that,” Harry said, voice tight. “No, really, it is.” Heat came in waves off Malfoy and it took an awful lot of self control not to feed off that violent energy. “Endearing, even,” he added, keeping his gaze steady. The rain outside seemed to pick up. The girls were outright staring now, nervous excitement gleaming in their eyes, and at the edge of his vision, Harry saw Malfoy’s fingers twitch. He opened his mouth to speak, Malfoy took a step forward, the air between them was dangerously charged, and then — the man was there.
“Only a few hours.”
Draco deadpanned, wispy white waves falling in his eyes.
“You have that effect on me,” he replied in a mock-flirtatious voice. His eyes widened as he realized what he’d said.
“Well shit. I just figured you were from around here. Kids mispronounced my name all through school, still happens, so I get it, it sucks. Didn’t mean to be an arse.”
And that body. Damn...
But something vulnerable twinged in Harry’s eyes, and when he said it again, it came out breathy. “Do it again.”
Mafoy doesn’t show up to their date. **friendly hang out. #no homo
“And that’s why you love me.”
“I’ve really got to head into work,” admitted Harry eventually.
“On the Quidditch field?” Harry laughed, still pressed against him.
“Did I…” started Draco. “Forgive me if you gave it, but what is your name?”
Draco yanked back. “I...” He felt as though his bones were crumbling one by one.
Draco had been itching to ask since Harry had shown him the gun, but it had seemed too rocky after yesterday’s trip to the clearing.
RITA: [ reluctantly moves to the next question, but she's taking notes ] How do you feel about former Death Eaters being welcomed to Hogwarts?
“Oh you were a wanker, don’t get me wrong, but you were also desperate for attention.”
“Says you.” Malfoy eyed Harry with curiosity. “You want to explain why you freaked out on me earlier?”
He looked absolutely mortified.
If you wanna creatively collaborate in any way, leave a comment and we can get connected! Lemme know what you thought of this. And, because the world is a scary place right now, stay safe and know that I'm sending love and support your way.
Harry nodded. “You’re alright then.”
Harry laughed, which actually got half a smile out of Malfoy. “Taking one for the team.”
the 'i need to be a lil shit' energy in it, he's dripping sarcasm and turns a little more ] Do you want to hear about the delayed emo phase, Rita? Or the drag queen persona? Oh, or maybe the one where I just couldn't eat until I had an orgy? Wild times. [ harry you've gone
Harry’s fingers grazed his chest, and then his collarbone. It was harder to navigate as he tried to untangle the smooth fabric from Malfoy’s neck, head, and arms; he’d really gotten himself in a knot. In just a few seconds, though, he found clear blue eyes staring into his. They were close. Very, very close.
“No, I am,” said Draco. It felt good to say it. “I’m fucked up.”
times” he plans to have at Hogwarts. “Personally, I want to just do all I can as a student to make Hogwarts a better, safe place for all sides to feel welcome. I want us to be better than we were before and start a legacy to be proud of.” His legacy certainly isn’t in line with the status quo, but Harry’s always had a reputation for being revolutionary.
They sat in awkward silence for a bit, glasses clinking and people chattering around them.
Wound full of weightless energy, Harry dressed and brushed his teeth, slamming the door behind him with vigor and a barely-contained smiled.
Draco lowered the pistol, relaxing his grip just an inkling. “How’d you find this clearing, anyway?”
“It’s like some sort of curse,” said Malfoy.
Mindy, the owner of the old fashioned ice cream shop on Diagon Alley, called to him from her counter. “You okay, Harry?”
Since he’d woken up that morning, he couldn’t seem to get Malfoy out of his head for the first time since school — proof of his loneliness. And yet it was that reoccurring face that forced Harry to see that the answer to his solitude was right in front of him; he just had to work up the courage to go after it. It was time he gave in to Ron and found himself a girlfriend.
“Well? Are you gonna fix this?” asked Malfoy, voice muffled by fabric.
“It’s not even midnight.”
It took everything in him not to snap. Not to whip out his wand or better yet, to throw a punch right then and there. Every impulsive bone in his body was shuddering with rage, unchecked aggression roiling inside him, angry adrenaline that he’d had to swallow because he was an adult now and the war was over. It would be all too easy to let it loose.
Harry received a scoff in response. “You want me to get naked for you, Potter?”
RITA: [ she smiles sweetly and nods her head ] Did you feel the need to experiment after having your adolescent years stolen from you? [ i'm sorry she's terrible ]
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” That bumbling man would have been Draco’s last guess.
“We talked about our jobs. About the latest drama with Celestina Warbeck. We talked about plenty of meaningless shit but you never... that didn’t happen.”
ur gonna burn yourself but he can't help it ] I think we're getting off track though, really.
The man placed a kiss on the corner of his mouth. He sucked Draco’s bottom lip. He kissed him fully.
They looked at each other for awhile, warm under covers, blanketed by static. Harry felt his eyes drooping but he didn’t want to hang up. Not quite yet.
Wind burns flushed Draco’s pale skin. His hair was a mess, he could feel it, but Harry’s was worse. He wanted to run his fingers through it.
“It felt like… forgiveness.”
“Yeah, well, not you. You may be an arse, but your real.”
Draco’s analogies were so dramatically obscure.
Draco’s pride faltered at the genuine apology.
“That’s all anybody does these days.”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
Scarlet seeped through crisp white fabric. Bathroom tiles and rusted faucets clouded Harry’s vision.
But the girls had lowered their scripts and were muttering to each other, eyes averted as if they weren’t listening in to every word. The man in the corner looked ready to intervene. And Malfoy was damn near throwing a fit, giving Harry the upper hand. If he shut down his instincts and continued to stand there cool and unaffected, Malfoy would look like a fool.
Heat coursed through his body every time their eyes met. He practically shoved his nose in a bag of coffee beans to snap out of it, and when that didn’t work, he shoved his whole arm into the ice tray while making iced tea. He’d dreamed this moment a thousand times, but this wasn’t romantic, it was awkward and miserable.
RITA: [ she smiles and moves on ] You've appeared with a number of people online in pictures that could be interpreted as... suggestive of something. How does your ex-lover Hermione Granger feel about this?
“How do you feel?” Draco asked.
“―she helps write policy, doesn’t she? They’ve decided that once a year, starting right about
“Are you okay?”
“This is just great. You made a mess of my designer shirt and now I have to dress like a depressed dad?”
“Isn’t that a little—“
The stranger looked at him hesitantly. “I can uh, call a cab for you? If you want?”
“Well alright then, that one?”
crackled Draco’s voice through the speaker. His face appeared, tired and irritated. Harry grinned.
“I’m Kumara,” said the stranger, holding out a hand and offering half a smile.
Malfoy shook his head. “He could have died, damnit! They can’t punish you for taking care of that situation. Don’t they have anything in that bloody department that recognizes anxiety or panic attacks or fucking PTSD? And I know how hard it can be to find work. I’m a former Death Eater for god’s sake.”
The only problem was figuring out where on earth to start. Just then, he remembered the ugly rock he’d transferred from his pajamas to his trousers that morning. Muttering “I can’t believe I’m actually doing this,” he pulled it from his pocket and set it on the desk.
“Correct.”
“I just don’t think she’s your type.”
He tried his best to open the door without letting it creak. His eyes lingered on the figure in his bed for a moment, and he closed the door behind him.
When Harry’s eyes wandered back to what was in front of him, he noticed Luna staring at him oddly. Or rather, particularly oddly.
“Oh, I’m so thankful I have the savior’s approval,” Malfoy trilled mockingly. “I just couldn’t go on without it!” He rolled his eyes in a grand gesture.
So why did Harry linger in the shop? Why did he keep glancing at Draco over his cup and, more importantly, why did Draco care?
His hands were cradling Draco’s head, thumbs brushing the short hair behind his ears, fingers curling in the long ghostly waves on top. Draco sighed into his mouth.
“Alright, pass it on over.”
He looked squarely at Draco and said “Do it again.”
Malfoy was hovering at the edge of his own kitchen, fingers drumming nervously on the counter, giving Kumara a look that Harry couldn’t quite read and Kumara didn’t seem bothered by.
on tumblr!
“Fine, thank you,” replied Draco haughtily, though his throat felt thick.
“Wait!” screamed Draco, “me too! I can feel it!”
But as they stumbled into the bedroom, dark except the haze of moonlight, his mind wandered again to the war. And as the dark-haired stranger leaned against the pillows and took Draco’s hand, pulling him onto the bed, he thought again of Harry Potter.
The waves of emotion were heavy and harsh, and in the midst of them, he felt strangely at peace. His grip strengthened and he channeled everything toward the firewhiskey label.
He wasn’t in the mood for fucking tonight.
It wasn’t Harry Potter. Draco felt his chest cave in.
Harry shook his leg violently. When that didn’t work, he kicked the stool beneath him repeatedly.
“But now that you’ve admitted that you weren’t really snogging me, how was snogging that other guy? I’ve always thought it’d be cool to be an actor. How’d I do, playing him?”
“I don’t.”
You can (still) find the author of Harry at
“Ginny.” Malfoy seemed to grimace slightly. “You and her were together.”
“What, is he married?”
He tried to memorize the slopes of his back. The coiled energy in his movements. The taste of his mouth, in case he never got any of this again.
Draco’s eyes shot up from Harry’s mouth. “You’re smiling,” he said dumbly.
“Listen, babe. Get a new job, and we won’t have professional conflict.”
Harry leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms.
“Yeah,” assured Harry, realizing he must look ridiculous. “Foot’s asleep.” She giggled and slipped into the back room.
“I don’t-“
“Fuck off,” said the stranger harshly, yanking back. Draco winced, hit by shock and cold air. His hands hovered where they had been holding the man’s waist.
Why wouldn’t Harry leave? Didn’t he have a girlfriend to get back to? A career, a life?
They sat on the bleachers facing an empty Quidditch field and a cloudy sky. Harry was cleaning his gun.
“I don’t want your information so you can bugger off of me right immediately.”
A few minutes later, Buck swooped back through the doorway clutching a neatly rolled piece of parchment. Harry took it and hurriedly unrolled it.
“That Weasel girl...” Malfoy tried to drop the words lightly into their comfortable silence, but they landed hard. Harry shifted. “You mean Ginny.”
He turned toward her blankly. “What?”
She stood up. He recognized, with a twinge of nostalgia, that her face meant business.
Harry studied him with the scrutiny of sixth year, searching for any sign that he was lying. “You’ve just been embracing the muggle lifestyle, then? I can’t imagine Bath is a major wizard hub.”
“Get to the point, I wanna know why the bloody hell The Punk Who Lived isn’t out in the field!”
Harry shifted on his feet, trying to improvise an answer. The kitchen was spotless, as he’d imagine Malfoy’s place would be, but what he hadn’t expected were the vines that crawled up the walls and around the cupboards, leaves fanning across white surfaces. “I’ve never been to Bath, and I wanted to see the, er, baths—“
“Nuh uh,” Kumara laughed. “Nobody actually names their kid Draco.”
“I have to go,” he mumbled. Kumara didn’t hear him, waving a towel at a smoke detector frantically.
“Fuck it,” mumbled Harry under his breath. “Alright, you prick. Have it your way. I won’t make you go home. I’m taking you to my flat and I don’t wanna here a word of complaint.” He grabbed the man‘s wrist and pulled him away from the scene of the duel. As Malfoy’s eyes drooped and he began to go limp, he muttered “My father will hear about this...” Harry had to let go of the wrist and instead loop his arm around Malfoy’s waist to support his weight.
Harry moved his hips like he was doin’ a lil’ dance.
Their child grew up alongside Draco, the mob boss’ kid, in a world where sly hands and slick guns were the normal. But the older he got, the less his parents slept at night. What was once a little spilt blood and some worthwhile cash became claws and teeth that could shred their baby, and even if he never scratched a soul, he’d have ties to the web that choked the city. The solution? Bleed it dry from the inside. They dealt in whispers, dropping information like bread crumbs. Their boy watched with wide eyes as his world crumbled.
He smiled at his friend’s familiar scrawl and sighed in relief, pushing back his chair.
Harry pushed Malfoy off of him, sighing in frustration. “Happen to recall any cleaning spells in your drunken state?” The spells that seemed the most mundane were always the ones he found himself wishing he knew. He racked his brain and tried something, and soap sprayed from his wand and splattered his already soaked shirt. “Well that’s just great,” he mumbled.
“I’m surprised you didn’t use it for love,” she said in her whimsical voice, smiling. “You’ve been quite lonely.”
Draco leaned closer, just to see how it worked. Harry angled toward him, just to give him a better view. Their knees bumped. Neither of them moved away.
It was too much.
After a moment, Harry replied. “I don’t know.”
Ron peeled off the sweater he had been wearing. “Files? We’re about to have the night of our lives and you wanna talk about files? Loosen up and help me get this show on the road!”
“What? Oh, yeah.”
Draco scoffed.
“Thanks. I can’t afford much but I still have my dignity.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth twitched upward. “Oh, toughen up, Potter. It’s better this way.” He held the drink toward Harry. “Here, have another go.”
“Pansy Parkinson?”
It felt fantastic, just snogging. His body was a bundle of nerves and nothing more.
Ron’s face looked like the portrait of depression itself. “That’s it. There’s no hope left for me. I’m entirely done for.”
Harry felt his way toward the switch and turned it off. He chuckled again. Living with his best friend was an adventure of its own.
“No! I can do it by myself!”
Not until he was sitting there alone in the early morning air did he realize that Malfoy was still wearing his shirt.
“Excuse me?!”
“Ignoring your feelings never made ‘em go away faster.” He pivoted toward the stove, silhouette soft in the dark blue of early morning. “Tell me about him.”
“But your feelings, that was because of the Nerglenut, of course.”
Draco couldn’t comprehend that level of self-respect.
Draco glanced down, breaking eye contact, and noticed the gun was facing Harry. Barrel lodged beneath his ribs, pointing up at his chest, finger hovering above the trigger.
They continued to pass the carton back and forth. Eventually, he spoke up.
Well guess what, Malfoy?” He placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “You don’t deserve saving. But I’ll kiss you if you ask nicely.”
“Piss off, Potter.” This was mockery. It must be.
Their lips met for one fleeting moment before Harry pulled back.
“What are you doing?” shot Harry.
“What do you mean?” He was pretty sure he had in fact used it for that very thing.
“I didn’t get it, I just sorta thought we’d figure it out and stay together because that made sense. Until she finally told me she wanted to break up.”
Harry stepped past Malfoy who was sputtering some sort of response he didn’t care to listen to, grabbed a clean pair of pajamas from his room, and shut himself in the bathroom.
“Would you just pick a shirt and―"
“Okay fine but only for a little bit.” He collapsed across the couch lengthwise, squishing Harry in the process. “Ah can’d bweath!” he yelled into the the couch cushions.
“I’m so sorry ma’am, complete accident,” Harry’s head snapped up to see Malfoy standing there with an empty glass. “I just feel so secure with the capable staff this place has that sometimes I get careless.”
She met James when he was a young man at the local theatre, breathing dust and wood polish and dreaming of making it big. She was in the crowd, dimly lit by the ghost of the spotlight, sitting there starry-eyed show after show. Late one night as the actors shed their waistcoats and fake eyelashes and the crowd trickled out, she lingered. They locked eyes, they flirted. And then her hands were in his hairspray-stiff hair and his arms wound around her waist.
HARRY: I'll be staying in the dorms. I think it's best to show involvement in any way possible. Besides, with other students having to be on campus, I think it's only fair.
“We do this every Friday.”
“The Dark Lord himself was onto me, I couldn’t be all that bothered by a self-centered prat with sub-par bullying skills.”
“Yes,” Draco said hoarsely, vision blurring.
“Merlin’s beard, Malfoy, I said you need to go home! I’m an Auror for God’s sake, you can listen to me or to common sense but either way you need to get your intoxicated and emotionally charged idiot self out of public before you put yourself in serious danger.”
Harry let his eyes trail up and down Malfoy judgmentally, lingering on his lean torso and the veins that crawled up his arm with ferocity. It must take a lot of nerve for him to act as if he deserved any semblance of normalcy, let alone happiness.
“Excuse me?”
It took Draco a moment to respond, frozen by shock, but he kissed back like the world was ending and he wrapped his arms around Harry.
He looked down at Malfoy, though, and all awareness of what had just happened slipped Harry’s mind because he looked sad and he wanted to fix it. So he leaned down, put his arms around him, and laid his head on his chest.
Harry slapped a wad of Muggle money on the counter and Draco took it, counting out the change by feel without breaking eye contact. He mirrored Harry’s steel gaze if only to avoid revealing anything else. They’d pretend they didn’t know each other. It was a freak coincidence and since neither of them wanted to interact, they’d keep it brief and businesslike. No need to dwell on their mutual hatred, or lie to themselves by feigning forgiveness, and certainly no need for Draco to get his hopes up only to have them squandered.
Draco knelt down before Harry and leaned in. Delicately, he rubbed his nose against Harry’s khram. It was softish, like a large worm.
“I want you,” Draco said weakly.
Malfoy let out a noise of disbelief. “No, I’LL find me a shirt.” He pushed Harry aside and threw open the doors to his closet.
Soggy amber leaves squelched beneath his black loafers. It felt good to be wearing real shoes again; he’d ditched the dirty lace ups that got him through the first few months after the war, that miserable chase for employment, for purpose, for someone to love him because he couldn’t love himself. Now that he was back on his feet, just thinking about it made him cringe. He was sick of the pitiful angst that had clung to him since sixth year, sick of feeling sorry for himself. Bit by bit, Draco was rebuilding his pride, and this time it wasn’t at the expense of his peers but rather fueled by the cleanliness of his flat, the sharpness of his style, and the smiles of customers satisfied with a job well done.
“Yeah, yeah I’m working on it...” He couldn’t imagine paying 200 Galleons for buttons that were this hard to undo, and it didn’t make it any easier that Malfoy was teetering back and forth.
“Because I’ve had good food before, and this doesn’t even come close to decent.”
“Bring my shirt,” added Harry, remembering the nice grey tee he’d owned for so many years.
Harry shook his head slightly, cocking an eyebrow at Draco.
“Monday’s coming and I have to work! Better go home.”
“What?”
“No! A sexy look would be you getting off my back! Let me have
Harry crushed the cup in his hand, tossed it in the recycle, and stood. The café was empty save for some scruffy black haired man in the corner and a couple of girls running lines for what must be a school play. The hum of machines behind the counter blended with the soft tapping of rain outside, and leaves blew past the windows.
“Heartbreak is shit,” he said. “I’ve been through it a couple times. The worst part is trying to convince yourself you’re over it, even when every little thing reminds you of them. It could be a purple sock, and you’re all ‘So-and-so liked the color blue, and that’s close to purple.’ I don’t know. It sucks.”
Mortified, Draco leaned in to catch his mouth in a kiss. They could keep going, breeze past this.
“They’re in every book on Herbology,” she said as if normal people actually read those. “The point is you used your wish for love, and it tried to land you with Malfoy of all people.”
“Neither can my legs!” said Harry, trying to turn Malfoy over but forgetting how exactly to use his arms.
“Well nothing much happened, I mean—“
Harry blinked twice.
“Codependency,” they said in unison.
The blond head tilted up. Malfoy looked at Harry for a moment, and then he laughed. Of all the different ways to react, he actually laughed. It was light, and brief, but it made Harry smile.
“Arthur Weasley lent it to me.”
HARRY: [ goddamnit rita he's just very quiet in thought for a bit. back to some tapping and playing with his rings ] I want to bury the hatchet.
They left the broom closet a sweet, sweet mess, the walls dripping with their love.
“I’m not letting this go,” hissed Draco. He turned to Lily and James. “How was the play?”
“No.”
“No one else knows the full story. Not Ron, not Hermione, not even Ginny and this is when I was with her.”
“‘Defended’ seems like a rather dramatic word. I was on my way to a discounted milkshake, they were in my way. Nothing more to it.”
“Hate to disappoint but I really must be off, so you’re going to have to move.”
“Merlin. Well, what’d you do?”
Malfoy’s hand was resting on the hospital bed in front of him. Without properly thinking, Harry reached forward to hold it, but Malfoy flinched away, asking tensely “What was that for?”
His own cowardice held him back. The same cowardice that kept him sniveling on the wrong side of the war. There were so many times he could have been brave enough. But he wasn’t. His schoolmates died and it was his fault. Potter would never see him as anything more than wicked and weak, and he was right.
He slid it to the side, grabbing a neglected stack of papers and feeling like a complete fool. He flipped through them for a couple seconds before his eyes landed on a sticky note with handwriting much nicer than his.
Malfoy shook his head in disbelief, collapsing back into his chair. “You know, honestly,” he said after a moment, “it would have been the least I could do.”
Harry laughed awkwardly.
“MY place. You stirred up trouble at the bar and I saved your sorry arse-“
“I’ll make you breakfast.”
She exhaled thoughtfully. Reached across the wooden desk and put a hand on his. There was sympathy in her eyes. “Harry, for once, I think you’ve got it all right.”
“Nice talking to you.” Harry spun around in annoyance only to see a witch aggressively searching the ground for her wand. He spun back.
“You’re doing wonderfully, Harry,” Lily said before looking up at her husband lovingly.
“Harder,” groaned Draco like he was taking a fat poo, which he sort of was. You really have to push.
He glanced around for his wand and grabbed it from the grimy ground. He performed a quick spell to stop the bleeding, and put his arms beneath Malfoy’s knees and shoulders. “We need to get you to the hospital.”
Harry was grinning wildly as he slid off his broomstick. He looked taller than before.
“I’m Emina. I’d hope you spend enough time actually partaking in Ministry work to know at least that, but I’m sure the office has been rather demanding since you switched from a real job to second floor secretary. I guess you can’t expect too much from a guy whose glory days are long since over.” She smiled teasingly.
He watched as Malfoy took orders and swept counters and added extra whip cream, entirely oblivious to Harry’s shadowed form in the back of the line. The customers counted down until finally, he stood at the register.
“What’s the magic word?” mumbled Malfoy.
Ron scraped the last of the eggs onto his plate. “You say that every time. It makes you miserable, too! I still don’t see why you accepted this desk job position.”
“You’re lonely. Is it still Ginny?”
“Thanks.” She smiled softly. “It’s for the upcoming edition of the Quibbler.”
Harry let the stubborn idiot twist himself up before finally giving in.
The moment he heard ‘Potter’ being spit like that, the previous night’s events rushed through his head. “Shit.” Harry forced his eyelids to lift just a little bit. A wand was pointed directly at his face, and sure enough, he could just make out a blond-headed figure behind it.
“Your heart will know.”
“Shit,” yelled Harry— Kumara— darting toward the stove. “The eggs!”
Guilt and uncertainty twisted in Draco’s gut. He was caught between wanting to shag this man like nothing had happened and disapparate on the spot.
He tried to return the kiss but the hands in his hair were distracting. It was tender; unfamiliar.
“Pansy? No, Merlin no. Not anyone I’ve ever had anything with. Never will, for that matter. I wouldn’t have dreamed of cheating on Astoria, anyway, but she told me my heart wasn’t in the right place. That if I cared about her, I needed to stop living in denial. So. That’s that, I guess.”
“No.”
“Harry?” Ron looked up from tenderly caring for his bacon. “You good?”
“Yeah, we’re fucked up. And— And I have no right to be telling you how to— shit, I don’t even have the right to talk you.”
He kept talking as Draco gaped.
“I shouldn’t have said―“ started Harry.
“Another Saturday? You’ve gotta be kidding me.”
There he was. All soft blond hair and pressed black shirt, fingers flitting across switches, buttons, plastic straws.
This bloke was a weirdo. “Worse.”
Draco echoed.
“Grey, grey, orrrrr grey. Such a difficult decision.”
He looked at Draco with a mischievous smile. “Maybe we should go at it again, and I’ll pretend you’re him.”
He brushed Harry’s wrist, which got his attention. Their eyes locked.
His past lovers are supportive. Hermione, the dark-haired wix who had a torrid affair with Viktor Krum, has stuck by his side, and the youngest Weasley approves of his promiscuous life choices. “Ginny has been there for me through a lot. She's not the type to judge someone for how they choose to live their life in that respect.”
HARRY: [ oh he'd be so satisfied about that the smug bastard. this one gets more of an obvious reaction. a full bodied snort laugh and a brow raise at her. he pauses for a long moment, just giving her the stare ] Seriously? [ he does eye roll now and laughs ] No, I'm not worried at all. I received good grades in my O.W.L's and when I took my N.E.W.T's. I'm more than prepared and I have plenty of fun experiences to fall back onto.
Harry raised an eyebrow at his shirtless roommate. “It’s Friday.”
“Good. Yep. Great!”
Harry was trying desperately to keep up.
He shifted on the rickety barstool, trying to ignore his guts as they shredded themselves apart.
“You wish.” Draco shot him a glance and immediately regretted it. Harry looked wild, hair even more tousled by the wind and light green eyes flashing in contrast with his dark skin. He filed the image away for later.
“I’ll refrain from touching you there,” said Draco. “That is, if you do want to keep…”
“We were both Aurors. It was after the war and we were tracking down the remaining Death Eaters and one was throwing around the Crucio curse. Neville had visited his parents earlier that day, and he just froze up. Each of us was dueling one of them and Neville had two, but he just stopped moving. He was shaking and he wouldn’t respond to anything. Nearly got the curse himself.”
He opened his eyes, realizing too late that they were wet. A tear fell and wet the stranger’s cheek.
A familiar twisting sensation carried them back to the musty smell of home, and Ron held on to Harry for an extra second, giving him a squeeze before dipping into his room.
But the memory of Malfoy’s harsh voice just hours earlier snapped Harry back into reality. His own feelings were a sappy mess, but maybe they’d be met with coldness and he could stop worrying about all this.
Draco watched as it swelled up and rose straight into the air as if it were a deformed sunflower reaching for the sun. He then licked the tip like it was one of those lollipops from the bank. A bank lollipop. To fully please his lover, he would need more than just his tongue, so he lifted his finger and poked at it.
He looked away. “Something like that.”
It had been years since the two had laid eyes upon each other. Something stirred inside Harry’s stomach at the sight of him ― a resentful sort of nostalgia ― but he looked worse than ever. Pale blond hair plastered across paler skin, bags under bloodshot eyes, skinny frame shaking; he was a wreck. A drunken wreck, as evident by his drooping, shivering stance and the way his sloppy attempts at spells hit everything except his opponent.
Then there was the matter of the warm, nervous buzzing in Draco’s chest whenever he was near Harry, but he was ignoring that.
“Spaghetti boy.”
“This again?” sighed Harry.
RITA: [ she shakes his hand BOOM done interview complete ]
“What did I say?!”
Draco nodded dumbly.
“Alright, if you don’t wanna talk then I’ll just catcha later,” Harry drawled, moving his finger toward the red circle.
Malfoy looked him up and down skeptically, searching for any sort of hidden motive. After a moment, he agreed, and they planned to meet at lunch.
“Let me help,” said Harry, and he swatted at it lightly with his hand. When that didn’t work, he started slapping it.
(See the end of the chapter for
Why, you may ask? Spoiler alert: He’s busy getting beat up in an alleyway.
He then poked at Draco’s butt with his giant, two-inch-or-greater cockadoodledoo and wiggled it around a little bit. “Say ahhh!” he said to Draco’s butt. His grub slid in. “Got ‘em!” exclaimed Harry.
“I can handle my own life, thanks,” Malfoy said cooly.
“How are you enjoying your meal?” he asked.
“And you know that’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”
This time, he knew what to expect. The bang sent a jolt through his body but he paid it no mind, squinting instead at where the bottle had been. It was still there.
Draco scoffed lightly.
“Yes!” he agreed. “And then you could have been the one with a frickin’ noodle arm. God, that was the worst.”
Harry walked into the kitchen to see Ron wrestling with a scarf that appeared to be down the sink drain. With the disposal on. He took a moment to take in the bizarre scene before darting over to the disposal switch and trying to flip it off, but it seemed to be jammed. Lovely.
He tried again. “You can talk to me about it. About anything.” He cringed at his own desperate words.
And yet they’d come back for eighth year, a handful of them. Maybe they wanted closure. Maybe they would never get it.
The searing hot water cleared his muddled head. Harry let himself relax completely for a moment. Only a moment, because his adrenaline kept him moving and before he knew it he was aggressively drying his hair with a towel. Dried and dressed, he slipped the lumpy prune into the pocket of his pajamas. He didn’t want to face Luna’s disappointment if she found out he rejected her nargle nugget. His left hand flicked off the light while his right hand flung open the bathroom door.
“We finally broke up over a Gameboy. I wonder what he’s up to now. I kinda miss him.”
He stood up, dropping his spoon in the sink. It landed with a harsh ring. “Well! Like I said, I have work in the morning. You can, uh, take my room, we’ll just need to get that rag off of you.” Harry gestured to the vomit-splattered shirt.
“Hey, I’d take this place over the Dursley’s any day.”
Ron sighed and put his arm securely around Harry. “You got it, Chosen One.”
The blender whirred again. “Didn’t catch that. Can you repeat yourself?”
His stomach twisted in on itself, mind reeling back to that moment in the bathroom. He had long since shut it out, but finding himself with his wand pointed at a blood-drenched Malfoy, his insides curled with guilt and anger and fear of his own power and a dozen words unspoken.
They walked the grounds together, Draco’s heart stuttering with embarrassment and perhaps a twinge of hope.
Squeezing his eyes shut, he let out a harsh breath. “Well, to hell with it, it was bound to happen eventually.”
“Harry?” He broke from his trance. Are you alright?”
Luna placed a hand on his and looked into his eyes intently. “I have something for you. I was going to deliver it to Mrs. Squashknobbler, but I have a couple more in my garden and I think you need it more.”
A soft smile graced Harry’s lips. “It’s okay. I love you anyway.”
Malfoy slurred.
Harry raised his eyebrows at Ron as Malfoy muttered something incoherent about garbage.
Most of the talking took place on one end of the table. Every time Harry did say something, she mocked him, but he supposed she was trying to be funny so he didn’t let it bother him. He simply worked at his spaghetti, and although he hadn’t remembered until it was in front of him that he didn’t care for tomato sauce, he tried to make the best of it now.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “At least someone’s reliably consistent with their emotions. Though it can’t be too difficult when you have the emotional maturity of a 4-year-old.”
“Er, Luna? What is this?”
“Good job!” said Harry.
The nurse turned to Harry. “Are you sure you’re okay in this relationship?”
“See you next time, sugar. And don’t wait too long - I like having you around.” He gave her a brief smile and left.
“Fine then I’m walking you there, appa- apprarate-“ Harry giggled in a low voice, “apprirating with you there and walking.”
He let his hands glide across the leather jacket before he helped the stranger pull it off. His fingers hit soft cotton, and he dragged them down his chest before raking them back up his torso. The stranger shuddered.
THE END
“So, Harry,” Kumara said, tossing mango slices into the blender, “what brings you around these parts?”
“Good morning Harry,” said Luna lightly. Her hair was a tangled mop on top of her head with carrots stuck all throughout it.
Malfoy blinked slowly. “I was winning,” he whined.
“Don’t worry about it.” She smiled. “I just don’t want to see this sad excuse for food on the bill.” He nodded and walked away, flustered.
“I bought that stuff! You’re at my place eating my food and you have absolutely no right to tell me what’s what.”
“If you’re not― If you aren’t okay―“
he wants to bury it.
Leather jacket. Scruffy dark hair and warm brown skin, nearly amber under the red lights. Achingly familiar.
“I mean, don’t get on your hands and knees, but a little human decency wouldn’t kill you, Potter.”
He settled on “Thanks.”
Limbs tangled for a few moments. They managed to arrange themselves with Harry sitting mostly upright and Malfoy laying across him, back against the armrest.
HARRY: [ his eyes practically light up but you can
“That moth is looking at me,” growled Malfoy, with his weight still on Harry.
“Then don’t block my path.”
“That’s an understatement.”
Harry walked right into a mob. Shattered glass and beams of light whizzed overhead as he pushed his way through the mass of bodies. A pair of dueling wizards came into view, and as Harry stumbled to the front of the small crowd, he could see that the one on the far end was indeed Malfoy.
Throat constricting, a shiver ran down his arm and he dropped his wand. Malfoy looked up.
“Well you’ll have to put them on hold because unfortunately, I have a discount at Mindy’s.”
“A new job?
comments and kudos mean the world! thanks for stopping by.
Harry rolled his eyes. “No.”
Draco quirked an eyebrow. “I thought I was supposed to be getting over this.”
“Where is he?”
He reached up to graze the stranger’s ear.
. That stirred something in Draco. Beneath the sick tangle of darkness he’d built up hid a lovestruck boy. He grasped for that feeling.
Harry felt someone pat his arm, and he turned to see Luna, this time with turnips in her hair. She smiled up at him. “Congratulations, Harry.”
“Ask,” he purred.
“Frickin’ bet,” said Harry.
The sound of sizzling butter served as a backdrop to a whisk clanging loudly against glass. Two flatmates began their morning routine, complete with a defeating yawn from Ron.
came a sleepy voice from Harry’s pillow. Harry grasped for his phone and squinted at the bright screen.
“That’s Harry James Potter ‘Has A Nice Arse’ to you,” Harry said seriously.
RITA: [ he's too good at this. she moves onto the next question, hoping for better luck with this one. ] Do you plan to rekindle your relationship with Draco Malfoy?
The world spun to a halt.
“That’s what he was saying, until I told him I wasn’t being serious and he hadn’t said anything of the sort. Then he told me he was just fooling around. That none of it was true.”
• • •
“It’s nice, isn’t it?” she asked, smiling softly at him.
“Lockhart was such a mess.”
The next stop brought him to the Ministry of Magic, and he trudged toward another day of paperwork.
“What, Harry, you wanted to what?”
“Making fun of you for having parents, that was unforgivable—“
Harry after Quidditch. Harry with stubble. Harry under him, moaning.
Draco pulled down his trousers, turned around, and crouched down a little bit. Harry’s thing stuck up in the air again with the flip of a lightswitch. “We’ll need some lubricant,” he said, so he retched into his hands until he had a puddle of spit and smeared that on Draco’s ass cheeks.
“I don’t understand, that’s not what my wish was about.”
Harry laughed dryly and turned his attention to the table, laying enough money down for the dinner and another couple of handfuls for the tip. When he’d finished, Malfoy was still standing there.
They were a breath away.
“You have to hold it away from yourself, right about here,” Harry was explaining. “And cock it, pull back the… yeah, you’ve got it.”
from harry and heavily eye rolling when he sighs and settles again ] You do realise you were the one to pull that piece of crap theory out of the air, right? We were never dating. Hermione is one of my best friends, nothing more, nothing less. There's nothing for her to have feelings about.
HARRY: It's the purpose of all of this, isn't it? [ he scoffs a bit. yeah he has no belief in the words he's spewing here ] I dare to have hope.
“People think he’s pure evil. And yeah, he’s done a lot of―  but... he’s still... my dad. And how am I ever suppose to be anything decent if I’m already labeled as just an echo of that. Fuck, I dunno. But I couldn’t just stand there and take it.”
“Cappuccino,” he said shortly. “Tall.”
with Draco Malfoy?” admitting to the toxicity between them: “You mean the one where we were at one another's throats on and off the pitch?” He shakes his head and looks away, the burden of forbidden lust clearly taking a toll on him. “I want to bury the hatchet,” he assures me, but he doesn’t specify
The crowd once more began to clap slowly. “Let’s get married,” said Draco. Then they had a baby.
“Stay,” he said, accidentally. It came out as a mumble against Harry’s mouth.
• • •
Harry’s mind drifted to the strange events of last night. Draco Malfoy, of all people, talking openly about his own insecurities. Draco Malfoy with a very nearly friendly attitude. Draco Malfoy with his shirt off. The intensity of their eye contact. The closeness of their faces...
A heavy arm draped across his back, and Harry felt like he’d solved the problem. He was too tired to get up just yet, though. He’d move in a little bit, but for now, he was so comfortable like this. And Malfoy’s breathing was slowing. It was all very relaxing...
“No, Potter! I’m not going to ‘let it go!’ You interrupted a
Harry's finger moved closer, and closer, brushing the metal of the trigger.
Just then, the figure beneath him started to move. Heavy eyelids lifted just barely, and then shot open. “Potter? What the hell are you doing in my house?!”
Draco stepped closer, eyes back on Harry’s lovely mouth, now parted with shock.
“Talked to Millie half a year ago. Millicent. Pans and Blaise, though? I don’t know. I think we’re all trying to forget about it. Distance ourselves.”
So he sought truth. He played by the rules and idolized heroes and believed in justice. He heard about SAFE, an unarmed group of people that aimed to de-escalate violence his old city, and the day he graduated high school, he drove his car from the ceremony to their training center.
ludicrous heist! And yeah, fish sticks sound good. Easy. I’ll preheat the oven.”
Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed an apron off the hook.
A hand cupped his jeans, palming him, and he pressed into it. The pressure was both over-stimulating and not near enough. He fumbled with the buckle on his belt.
“That you miss me.”
Rain. Of course there was rain. Not even the exciting, thunder-ridden, torrential kind, but the kind that made Harry blink behind lightly misted glasses. Just enough to be a nuisance. The coffee shop was a lovely little thing from the outside, no signs reading ‘mudbloods beware’ or ‘warning: this building contains an irritating prick.’ Harry wiped his glasses on his jeans, put them back on, realized they were only blurrier, and stepped inside.
Draco winced at the condescension. He was sick of sex, of the emptiness.
Harry brushed his thumb across the back of his hand tentatively, experimentally, and his eyes flickered to Draco’s mouth.
Ron opened his mouth as if to say something. He closed it again. Opened it.
“Huh?”
“Sunday night.”
“Yeah, er, mate. Acquaintance. Friend, we’re friends.”
“Yeah…” Draco replied, still not entirely following.
Traces of stubble scratched his lips. He raked teeth down the man’s neck, heard him groan. He sucked the skin there and tasted sweat.
“Rum. What did you just say?”
“It’s the sperm!” said Draco. “They like you!”
Warmth spread through Harry’s chest. Draco treated him like a person.
Of course it wasn’t. It never was. It was just his pitiful, desperate longing for a shot at redemption. Unresolved feelings from the past decade. Every wet dream projected onto the world around him.
It felt safe, and warm. His eyes stung beneath his lids. To think of Harry holding him like this was too much.
“I’m exhausted!” he said through another mouthful of bacon. “Thanks to that egotistical toothpick, I couldn’t get a wink of sleep last night. Pass the butter.”
None of them could walk into the Great Hall without remembering the bodies.
Okay. The word rolled tentatively across Draco’s skin. He wished it would soak in.
“No.” Malfoy seemed to answer before Harry had even finished asking.
“What? Oh. Yeah. Ugh. Gross.” Harry realized he’d stopped whisking and quickly started moving his hand again.
“Ohh,” the male nurse said slowly from the doorway. “I’ll come back in a bit then, I wouldn’t want to interrupt anything.” He gave them a knowing nod and encouraging smile as he pulled the doorknob toward himself.
A thousand expressions flashed across Harry’s face. It settled on nervous. The Chosen One looked nervous.
“This is weird,” said Harry.
“Huh?”
Harry‘s mouth was gone. There was a soft thud. He was on his knees, hands on Draco’s thighs, and he asked “Do you want me here?”
“They’re my mother’s,” he murmured.
“More like a dozen times.”
The nurse’ eyes widened. “Dude, you’re good—“
“Good. Bug off.”
“No.”
“Not yet,” said Draco.
“Nah mate, this is THE Friday,” he insisted with far too much confidence, pulling up his sleeves. The left one immediately slipped back down, but he was too busy picking a shirt for Harry from a pile of dirty clothes to notice.
And long silence followed. “Oh. That.”
“Don’t give yourself that much credit,” he said eventually.
Was he going to condemn Draco and everything he’d ever stood for? Was he going to heroically save him from the dementor’s kiss? Was he going to shock everyone and give Rita Skeeter a field day by smooching him square on the mouth right then and there? Draco hardly cared. Just seeing the Savior was enough ammunition for at least seven wet dreams down the line. “YOU CAME!” Draco whispered softly.
“Harry?” Malfoy was looking at him with a soft expression. “Have I told you that I like your eyes?”
“Because it sounds to me like you were anything but subtle. And what, he just thought ‘Oh yes, Draco stares into my eyes and uses any excuse to be close to me and that is hetero behavior if I’ve ever seen it!”
Besides, all he wanted now was to put that life behind him and run a flower shop. He could write poetry about daisies on his breaks and cry aesthetically into the roses. Or maybe he should be a barista, swooshing his soft silvery hair off his face and smiling shyly at customers as he squirted whipped cream seductively onto their frappuccinos.
Here was Draco, though, fuzzily lit and unsure and blushing.
They simmered down into silence, scooping rice onto their plates and eating. Most of the quiet moments Harry experienced these days were brief breaths of the lonely air in his flat between shifts. This, though, this was comfortable. By some ludicrous jumble of circumstances, this felt like camaraderie.
"'Mione..."
“I feel at least a decade older than that.”
Harry’s stomach fluttered. Draco made it sound as though he planned to stay around. He couldn’t help but imagine holidays with Draco, traditions and warmth and banter, seeing his face every day.
"Thanks, mum," said Harry, kicking Draco's ankle behind the counter.
Harry feels strongly that former Death Eaters should join in on the fun. “After all, this is all about reform and doing better than we did before, right? I just mean physically,” he says.
Draco nodded. He cleared his throat.
Harry felt a hand on his arm pull him downward until their faces were only an inch or two apart.
The screech of brakes echoed through the tunnel as the subway came to a stop. Harry would forever be reminded of the Hogwarts Express. He curled his fingers around the cold handle of his briefcase and stepped through the doors, greeted by a familiar face.
“I’m fine,” Harry said.
“Wanted to know how it works. I said I had no clue, but I’d figure it out.”
“Would you let me finish?”
“Did you?” he eventually asked, looking at Harry.
A wave of pleasant chatter washed over him as he swung open the door at 5:04 PM. Harry told himself again that it was probably a work meeting or even a trap, all the while craning his neck to look for someone who might’ve asked him out.
her, and I didn’t do anything.”
"Give me a second, I’ll find you a shirt.”
“I’m just kidding,” she said as she flashed him a smile. Just then, the waiter came back.
“I’m telling you, this is your OCD acting up,” Harry laughed, flipping the camera back.
There was a rap on the door.
Draco rolled his eyes.
. ･ ✧ . ･ﾟ☆ . ･ﾟ✧ ･ﾟ
“All wishes can be sorted into one of three categories: love, time, and material. These markings here show that you used yours to alter time.”
“You know what?! Fine! If saving the slimeball will make you stop moping around the apartment over Ginny and your job, to hell with my complaints. But that sodding thing is going in your bed. No way I’m letting Mr. greasy string bean on my couch.”
Harry shrugged, relaxing further into his chair. “Apparently nothing can. It’s been tried and tested.”
“Not bad.” Harry raised an eyebrow and nearly smiled, but Draco shoved the gun at him forcefully.
“Excuse me?”
“Fine!” exclaimed Ron. “That one.”
A jet of thick, pale liquid with little sperm tadpoles in it like tapioca pudding shot straight from Draco’s groin pinky and Harry caught it midair in his hands. He lifted it to his lips and sipped at it daintily.
He felt shaky. He wanted to yell at Potter, but he couldn’t make him close off, not after that.
“I was drunk?”
“He started it, okay! I was just standing there and that stupid dusty mothball decided to go and-“
RITA: [ she has to keep from smiling. god, she's the worst ] Do you feel responsible for the loss of life?
“Denial,” Hermione said with authority, but her assured expression faltered. “Then again, he’s a Slytherin, and he’s Malfoy. How can you be sure what to trust?”
Harry snorted. “I grew up with soulless idiots, and not all muggles go around shooting things anyway.”
“Right.” Harry turned, but where bacon should have been there was only a flaming stretch of scarf. “Er, Ron?”
The subway’s scream served as a backdrop to Luna’s airy voice, giving the whole scene a vibe that Professor Trelawny would approve of.
Wind whipped through Harry’s unruly raven locks. A storm was brewing, and not just in his heart. “Draco!” he called, hoping the blond would hear. He’d walked straight from the Ministry into a natural disaster, trees flailing and buildings shuddering, and he could only hope his potato bug present would grant him one last favor. It was dissolving in his pocket, fading to dust, for Luna had forgotten to mention that the wish’s effects were temporary.
Draco shifted awkwardly in the frame.
Just then, the men’s bathroom door swung open and a bloke with warm brown skin a bit darker than Harry’s made his way toward her. He put his arm around the woman and she melted into him, smiling contently. Harry didn’t blame her for looking so happy. He had calm eyes and muscular arms. His jawline was strong, cheekbones high set, and smile just a tiny bit dorky. Overall, he was incredibly attractive. For a dude. Harry quickly broke his gaze from the fairly average couple and looked over at his friend.
“You really are that fond of him, aren’t you.” There was no trace of judgement in her voice, and when he searched her eyes trying to figure out what she was thinking, all he could find was love and acceptance.
“Yoooo, what?” yelled Ron, dissolving quickly into giggles.
“Malfoy.”
Feeling a bit nauseous and unsure if this was really happening, he walked toward her. He didn’t know much about this lady, though he was fairly certain Ron had mentioned her once or twice. She had sleek black hair pulled into a low ponytail and skin the same dark caramel color as Harry’s. As he sat down across from her, she winked, her sharp eyeliner briefly crinkling.
“You wanna…” said the man, panting. “My room, end of the hall.” He gestured and they fumbled in that direction.
“I had that under control. She was being rude, and I was about to call her out on it.”
The man looked solemnly off into space. Then, seeming to come to a decision, he said “Nahh, I don’t think it gets worse than that.”
“He was sassy as hell.”
The thing sprouted from the drain and came shooting at Ron and Harry.
“Very impressive,” he said sincerely.
The mockery had faded from his voice.
“Yeah, well,” Harry shot, “some of us were busy defeating Voldemort.”
“Look, Ronald,” she said. “During the war, everything was just… it was so intense. I needed to breathe, to figure myself out, but… We should catch up. Over coffee.”
“Bromance is real,” whispered Hermione.
𝙃𝘼𝙍𝙍𝙔 𝙋𝙊𝙏𝙏𝙀𝙍 𝘾𝙐𝙈𝙎 𝘾𝙇𝙀𝘼𝙉 𝘼𝘽𝙊𝙐𝙏 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝘾𝙃𝙊𝙎𝙀𝙉 𝙊𝙍𝙂𝙔
“Actually, yeah. Yeah I think you should go introduce yourself or something.”
Harry crossed his arms. “A simple ‘thank you’ would suffice.”
Harry breathed a laugh through his nose. “I just missed the orgy, it was last night.”
“I don’t know,” Harry replied.
“Are you coming or not?” called Ron.
“What the actual Hell are you doing here?” fumed Malfoy.
Malfoy, however, did not seem to take it as one.
“That moth is minding its own business. You should try it sometime, maybe you’d end up in less of a―“
Loving could live safely outside of reality.
“No, it’s not. Yeah. I only use magic to turn the lights off these days. To lazy to get out of bed. I even clean by hand. Cathartic, almost?”
“For Merlin’s sake Malfoy, if you’re not going to rinse off then I will. Don’t. Touch. Anything. I’ll be back to deal with you in a minute.”
Luna was there, as usual, and she wanted to know about her nut.
“Oh I’m so glad you asked, I felt way too awkward to ask for yours. Kumara.”
“Literally everything at that school was trying to kill you, I could have taken some of that off your back.”
“I still can’t believe you frequent Mindy’s and you’ve never spiked a milkshake,” Malfoy scoffed, stirring the alcohol into Harry’s drink.
“Well then,” said Harry, awkwardly clapping Malfoy on the back. He didn’t quite realize until their skin made contact that Malfoy was shirtless. “I’m gonna go grab a cloth.” He couldn’t tell what was worse: having to stare at Malfoy’s face or his chest. “To wash your, erm, to get you cleaned up. Right then.“ He dipped out of the room.
Ron chuckled and Harry was relieved to see a little bit of life back in his face. He heard another crash. “I’m, er, gonna go check on things.”
“Mhm. Forgiveness not granted.”
“You haven’t answered my question. What is this mess of a place?”
“Where the hell am I?”
Harry looked down. He shrugged. Looked up. “That time I found you in the bathroom. Crying. It reminded me of that.”
“Shut up and follow me, you arse.”
When I ask him about Draco Malfoy, he says “My
Draco whimpered. “I need you inside me.”
“What, and you are?” Harry spun to face him. “You’re fine with the fact that you fought for the wrong side? You let Hermione get tortured? You watched as the kids you grew up with, your schoolmates, fought and died and you did shit. And that’s fine?”
“I suppose you’re Draco Malfoy’s family?” the man asked.
James laughed and kissed the top of her head. “And you boys? Trouble at work today, Harry? How's the flower shop, Dray?”
As they stepped out of the grimy hallway and into the room, Harry marveled at the decor. It was simple and shiny and incredibly nice looking for the run down building it was in. “Hey, hey Malfoy. This place is simple and shiny and really nice for being in such a run down building.”
“That’s nice,” said Harry, smoothing Malfoy’s silvery eyebrows.
Hope once again lights his eyes as he looks forward to the “
Harry nodded slowly, a bit distracted by the angular features of Malfoy’s face and how smooth they looked in the dim light, but he was appreciative of the advice. “If you say so.”
“Was it about your father?”
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hand to pull him up. He flinched at the touch, but let himself be led down the hallway.
“I have to go sleep.”
“Oi, now you’re mocking me, too?!”
“Me too,” breathed Draco, winded from flying and from Harry’s sudden proximity.
RITA: How was the orgy, when you finally did have it?
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Nice seeing you too.”
“You’re welcome,” came the dismissive response.
Malfoy looked down out himself. “Who the bloody hell did this to me?! I paid 200 Galleons for this shirt! Was this you?!”
“You’re not.”
This was far more physical than any dreamed-up fantasy; This was hot and wet and hard. Draco tried to drink it in through every pore so he would never forget the closest he ever got.
“Would you hold this for me?” Harry held up the cleaning cloth.
• • •
He wasn’t in Harry’s room or the laundry room. During a quick search of the living room, Harry contemplated whether or not he would feel guilty if he saw Malfoy’s face slapped on the Daily Prophet the next morning. He turned around to face the kitchen and saw a thin young man sitting criss cross applesauce on the tile floor holding a carton of ice cream.
Harry had forgotten how toned this bloke was. His mind flitted back to just a couple nights ago; undoing the buttons of his shirt, taking it off... The shirt he was wearing now had buttons. Harry wondered if they were as hard to undo as those other ones.
“You most definitely were not. Now go home before you get yourself into more trouble.”
“I love you,” they said in unison. The whole crowd gasped.
Draco prickled.
You can’t be serious.”
He remembered the hospital, and Mindy’s, and then they sat outside and... alcohol. That’s just great. He clearly recalled Malfoy’s apartment. And the couch, this couch. They sat on the couch and oh god. Merlin’s beard. Looking at Malfoy’s face now he could feel a lingering urge to kiss him.
“So.”
The door must have opened, because suddenly Hermione was in front of him.
“So by the time you got around to asking for love, you’d already used your wish subconsciously. It’s a common problem people run into. Idealists argue that it’s because the specimen knows what we need better than we do, but I think it’s a flaw in the design, really—“
Getting any work done after the strange events of early this morning would be difficult, but Harry wished Ron the same and was off to the subway.
Malfoy was yelling. Harry was trying to make sense of what he was saying.
With that, Luna and her nest of carrots swiftly departed the car. Harry eyed the nuggetnut thing for a moment before slipping it into his pocket.
Good lord. It’s been 2.5 years and looking back on this is... it’s somethin’. I want a sense of resolution, ya feel? But be warned, for this fic is a conglomeration of cliches and I shan’t break that pattern now. This final chapter is gonna verge into parody territory.
He certainly hoped he wouldn’t have to stick around that long. “Maybe,” he said, smiling tightly.
“You’re right. Sorry. That was an understatement. You were so far gone you dueled a moth, ate ice cream with your worst enemy, and acted like a spoiled, whiny toddler. Oh, once again, my mistake - that last bit’s nothing new.”
Malfoy grabbed thin glass plates from the cupboard and passed one to Harry. “Feel free to serve yourself.”
. ･ ✧ . ･ﾟ☆ . ･ﾟ✧ ･ﾟ
The spinning blades in the sink drain sucked up the scarf, and yet it only seemed to be getting longer on their end.
He grabbed a handful of dark hair.
Harry slipped his hand into his pocket, curled his fingers around his wand, shot Malfoy a glare, and said “Accio ice cream.”
“That’s exactly the problem, she might say yes. And that’s a problem because she’s weird. She’d be obsessive and clingy and really, the more I think about it, that’s a terrible path to go down.”
Harry woke up to a raging headache. And smooth blue fabric. On a person. Why was there a person? He pushed himself up just enough to see Malfoy.
Harry shot Draco a glare before shrugging at his parents. “I’m just glad Draco cut ties with the mafia. And you two. It’s enough trouble that I’m old friends with half the people I’m trying to shut down.”
. He’d pictured himself holding Harry a thousand times, but never had he imagined Harry holding him.
The light stubble spattered across Malfoy’s cheeks was rougher, and the cloth caught a couple times. His lips were dry. They were parted slightly, so they moved as Harry gently wet them with the cloth.
Malfoy let out a long sigh. “Fine. You can have some.”
The chilly air swept through the field and swirled around them, but they were a bundle of warmth, two bodies with aching chests and beating hearts, holding one another.
“That feels so good,” said Harry, so Draco munched harder. It tasted like sour sausage. “Oh! Oh! Now you, let me do you.” Harry pulled his little smokey out of Draco’s mouth. It fell with a wet plap against his legs, and he placed his hands on Draco’s arms, lifting him until pale blue eyes met green.
Harry stepped toward him and raised his hands, unsure of how to use them. “Er...”
There was Ron. And there was Luna every morning and... and that was it. That was the extent of his social life at this point. That, and the wasted man last night.
Harry shook his head in disbelief, saying “It’s seeming more and more like you’ve grown to be a half decent person.”
“Tomorrow then.”
“Why’d you show me how to…?” he tried to sound conversational. The question hovered between them. Harry said nothing.
Draco’s face softened. He said nothing, just stared through the screen at Harry, who was trying to memorize the shapes of warm lamplight on Draco’s skin. Vulnerability twinged in his light eyes, blond lashes barely visible.
Draco lifted the gun, aimed at the firewhisky bottle, and pulled the trigger.
He knew it was a ridiculous question. The last time he’d been on a broom was in the Fiendfire, and Harry’s answer probably meant it was the same for him. Thinking of that fire — who he’d lost, how it was his fault — scorched his insides.
“Not gonna lie, that would have been pretty snazzy.”
“Would you like to?”
“Early,” Draco corrected.
The look-alike’s flat was clean and smelt like tea. Draco had half a mind to find the bedroom, but this man writhed impatiently under his touch, pressed up against the hallway wall, and Draco felt on top of the world.
When Draco grabbed a handful of fabric at the collar and yanked him closer, the stranger gasped into his mouth and deepened the kiss. Cold fingers lifted the hem of Draco’s shirt, slipping under, roaming.
Harry pulled back. Suddenly, vulnerability shone in his shimmering green orbs. “I have something to confess.”
Draco whimpered.
“What on earth happened in here, Ron?”
HARRY: How can I not? I feel responsible for all of them and always will.
“No, your apology is not accepted.”
Our two favs talk for hours with alcohol & milkshakes, our other two favs. Then end up in bed together, more or less. But if you think that’s steamy, wait for the secret that gets spilled when morning comes...
He peeled off his t-shirt and threw it in the corner. When he yanked his trousers off, something fell out of his pocket: Luna’s wish-granting lump. He’d forgotten all about it. He set it on the bathroom counter, and realized just how covered in dried up toothpaste the counter was. Thank Merlin Malfoy was much too out of it to notice the mess their flat had become. Harry tossed his trousers and knickers into the corner with his mop of a shirt, and slipped into the shower.
Harry nodded. It was strange hearing this selfish, guarded boy so... open. He felt like he had crossed into a dimension he was never meant to enter, and he wasn’t sure if he was welcome.
“What do you want, Potter?” he breathed. It was meant to sound like a challenge, but he was nearly shaking.
“There,” mumbled Harry. He put out his hand for the cloth. Draco handed it to him, lingering for just a moment. Warm, calloused, dry.
HARRY: [ oh rita we love you he's brow raising and he really, really resists an eye roll ] I don't think anyone has the intention to make things negative. After all, this is all about reform and doing better than we did before, right? I just mean physically, being back somewhat that holds a lot of traumatic memories for people could be an obstacle. [ very calm he's doing so well look at him being all fake professional ]
Harry snorted, actually snorted, at the image of barista Malfoy. ‘Hi, what can I get you? We have cappuccinos, biscuits, and a free side of murder and mayhem brought to you by our sponsor, the Dark Lord himself! Lovely weather, isn’t it?’ He shoved the parchment into his brown bag and huffed at the window. It fogged, blurring the image of passing trees.
“Dinner,” Harry agreed. The horror on Malfoy’s face was worth it.
Draco’s breath caught, like his lungs were a fish and the air was a line. He looked at Harry’s lips, stepped closer, moved a hand toward Harry’s…
“You good?” Harry asked.
The carton flew into his hands. “Rude,” came the response. Harry jabbed his spoon into the freezer burnt stuff. The moment it began to melt in his mouth, he felt a little bit better. They passed it back and forth for a bit, cold hands brushing.
“Get back here, you soggy mess! Stupid, yarny bastard, I WILL DESTROY YOU! If you would just... bloody hell, MOVE!”
“‘Scuse you?”
Just then, sharp cheekbones and a slender nose entered his peripheral, and he whirled to face his old rival. “I...” he began, searching Draco’s uncertain features, “There was this nut thing, and I thought it was screwing with my mind but really it was just— we kept running into each other. That was out of our control. But my emotions are— What I’m trying to—”
How the interview actually went down.
“What a way to greet a guest. You invited me here. Both of us were pretty wasted—“
“Would you shut up!” But then Ron was laughing too, and Harry was glad that even if nothing else added up, he always had this.
“Sure, yeah, of course. Let’s, uh… Let’s take it slow, though, whatever it is, ‘cause yaknow…”
Smoke tickled Draco’s throat and he choked on it. Sunlight trickled through the window, landing on his half-undressed crotch, and his stomach churned with disgust.
The dazed man’s gaze snapped back up to meet Malfoy’s. Harry. He’d called him Harry.
, each Auror will be assigned a former Death Eater. You’ll follow them around for a week, make sure they aren’t up to any funny business―”
“You have a point. The time isn’t right for just any old milkshake. I think I’m going to need a shot in mine.”
“Let me buy you another drink.” Harry didn’t realize what he’d said until the words were out of his mouth.
Draco ended the call.
“No,” interrupted Draco, “you should have.”
There was this raw honesty in the way their hands communicated with each other — a vulnerability that was so much harder to let into spoken conversation.
“If you insist.”
Since they'd broken up ― well, okay, since she'd dumped him ― they'd had lunch together a few times, and the tone was terribly friendly. The worst part was that this friendly banter felt like every single interaction he'd ever had with Ginny. He loved her. He did. And he so desperately wanted to mean that in a romantic way.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”
Draco’s mind wandered over the last week. A woman at the grocery store with round glasses, a white cat that reminded him of Potter’s white owl… Pitiful.
Draco Malfoy had been a pain nearly their whole time at Hogwarts, but he had a redeeming moment or two. It was these past few days, though, that he’d gotten to see more of Draco than he’d ever thought he’d want to. And the more he learned, the more he wanted to know.
Ron’s words seemed to echo off the walls: Hermione would have solved this by now. He scribbled a note and sent it off with his owl, praying Hermione was still in the same office. They worked two floors away, and yet he hadn’t talked to her in months.
The cobblestones beneath Harry’s feet got darker and more jagged, and a chill down his back caused him to look up. Knockturn Alley. He must have taken a wrong turn.
Blue eyes seemed to flicker with vulnerability for an instant before they quickly recovered. “Of course, the good old days.”
“No, I’m serious, Hermione was telling me all about it, and—”
Draco smiled tightly. “Lovely, as per usual.”
“I think it’s over,” said Ron from somewhere in the ugly pile.
HARRY: [ i’m so glad damnit coz petty potter is now in full swing goddamnit harry ur gonna get urself into messes ] You know what Rita you are absolutely right. I needed something dramatic to do. I needed some phases and reckless choices. After all, don't I deserve it? [ harry ,, harry pls the sarcasm s t o p ] And I'm enjoying every last minute of it.
“Oh my god!” she yelled. “You absolute slag, what the hell was that for?”
“Scarhead saved everybody else,” Harry was saying, “why not me? Why not little old Malfoy? Who’s gonna save
Sure, there were parts of sex that made Draco want to vomit. Things that reminded him of the man he’d shagged after his trial, rough and demanding, or Fenrir Greyback in those dark months at the Manor.
“I won’t.”
RITA: So sorry, love, I see this is difficult for you to talk about.
Malfoy was sitting comfortably on the edge of his bed in his t-shirt, and looked up at the sound of Harry entering. “Potter! It’s been years. Do I look good?”
HARRY: [ a boi got whiplash damnit he ain't laughing anymore. his face drops and boy is she getting a
Perhaps they were healing, just a little.
“Tell me about him.”
“Did you hear his voice?” she started as soon as the waiter left. “He sounded like, really depressed. I guess some people just choose to see the negative aspects of life. Kinda pathetic, honestly.” Harry wasn’t sure how to respond, but the conversation topic breezed on toward music.
“Look, you don’t have to explain yourself.”
“You and I are on good terms, then?”
“...Yes, I do.”
Harry seemed to be lost in thought, and Malfoy waited quietly beside him until he started talking again.
“Oh, hi Harry!” said Ron between grunts. “Bacon’s on the stove if you want some.”
Which was rubbish, complete bloody rubbish. Just because he happened to be into everything about Malfoy didn’t mean he was into Malfoy.
But he swung his hand so it grazed Harry’s again, and Harry caught his fingers.
Harry whipped around to face Malfoy. “What’s your problem?”
And so Harry told Hermione everything, albeit awkwardly. Her face scrunched at the first few mentions of Malfoy, but she took in every word he said. When he got to the bit about Malfoy’s flat, he had trouble formulating sentences.
Robards, head of the Auror department and master of the combover, shrugged. “Protocol, Potter. Your friend with the bushy hair―”
Hermione kept talking, but Harry stopped processing her words. He trusted Hermione as the highest source of information, and if she was insisting on this, too, that meant it really must be true. It was his fault he’d fallen in love with Draco.
Harry scoffed.
When the waiter came back, however, she continued to talk badly about him, except this time while he was standing right there. Harry quickly thanked him as he walked away.
He sighed and pushed away from his desk, sinking into his chair.
Simultaneously, regret sliced through him and relief washed over him.
“Yeah, I guess I did. I mean it was kinda nice, he—“
Still laughing, Harry let out a “Huh?”
Harry smiled. He rolled onto his side and nestled into the pillows, glasses askew. “Try to be less of an asshole, okay? They sent me here right after Auror training and I couldn’t decline my first mission. Trust me, I wish I was there.
Harry’s fingers brushed his when he reached for the hot cup and Merlin, the shudder it sent through Draco was downright embarrassing. No one seemed to notice he was barely holding it together. No one except Kumara, who raised his eyebrows from the corner of the room so obviously that Draco had to mouth ‘quit it.’ He’d smooth over this accidental interaction and move past it, just as he’d moved past his adolescent feelings for the man.
“Ah, this’ll do. This particular scrap of elephant skin is marginally more tolerable than the rest.” Malfoy shook out a cool gray tee lined in black as Harry shook his head in disbelief. This intoxicated man couldn’t form a single reasonable thought, until fashion of all things brought back his vocabulary.
and Draco nearly got a boner on the spot.
His thighs hit a table and Harry lifted him onto it. Draco spread his legs and pulled Harry close.
“I know you do.”
“This whole night has been full of weird shit, making you eggs won’t even make the top five. You can eat eggs?”
“Well,
Choking back a laugh, Harry managed “Always the queen of drama.”
“Yes, I want this,” Draco somehow said even though he was in the middle of kissing.
Kumara didn’t seem to realize the irony of the situation, focused as he was on his mango lassis, but it felt reminiscent of the time Harry visited Hermione’s parents at work and watched them ask their patients questions only to stick metal things in their mouths. “I haven’t taken a vacation in—“ he began, only for the blender to start up again.
Draco scowled.
“Shut up, Draco, I’m not patronizing you, I’m trying to tell you that I’m into you.”
Draco set his shoulders back and lifted his chin. “Yes.” He raised the handgun again.
RITA: Do you believe you were responsible?
Malfoy’s head snapped up. “Yes, of course.”
“You, me, Dray,” he continued with nonchalance. “You two clearly know each other, and I’d love to get better acquainted with you.”
Harry, who had forgiven him. Draco still hadn’t wrapped his mind around that.
Harry looked at him cautiously. “I showed you because it’s something I do, and— it’s nice, being around you. You don’t pretend.”
“Fucked up? Absolutely. We’ve established that. But you seem sad, and I’ve decided I don’t mind being a stand-in if it means kissing a pretty boy. What do you say?”
“I left the names in, didn’t I?”
Harry watched as a long-haired witch drunkenly kicked off her shoe and poured her glass of firewhisky into it.
“Well I’ll sit with you. Anytime.” She flashed him a smile. Since Harry had stuck around and helped her clean up one night about a year ago, she’d given him everything half off. She was quite friendly.
“10 years.” Hermione did the math in her mind. “So he fancied you all through school,” she said incredulously.
The squashed, crusty thing sat there lifelessly.
without having to run away from you and your band of merry men.”
But in the dark, this man’s features were a mere suggestion, shadows and scruffy black hair. Their bodies were close and Draco’s was cold.
Embarrassment flared in Draco’s gut.
“Shut it, Ron...” Harry shifted in his bed. He didn’t remember it being so small. Or cold. Or uncomfortable.
Malfoy chocked on the sip he was taking and laughed. “It was never gonna happen.”
He hit the FaceTime button, willing his boyfriend to pick up.
Draco was having serious trouble following this story.
“Ew!” he exclaimed, holding up a brownish sweater. “What is this? Half the things in your wardrobe shouldn’t be allowed to exist!”
They were quiet for awhile.
“Teamwork makes the dream work!” chirped Draco.
he thought to himself.
Harry glanced down at his hand where Draco’s had touched it. He looked back up at Draco, eyes skittering across his face, his hair, his lips.
“Excuse me?”
RITA: [ she's waiting on a bench at the park. when she sees him, she stands and welcomes him, leaning forward to do a lil' air kiss by his cheek and motioning for him to sit down. ] Harry, darling, it's so good to see you, I do hope you're well.
Ron slumped to the floor. A tattered knit pattern surrounded him like a giant, tangled nest, and he sat in the middle, as slimy and wet and miserable as a freshly-hatched baby bird.
The midday rush had come and gone. Harry had watched couples, friends, and families pick their flavors. He‘d finally bought himself a milkshake in the hopes of looking less alone, and he’d watched condensation from the glass drip onto the table, glistening in the sunlight that bounced off the pale orange walls.
Harry tossed the bag onto the counter and slammed the freezer shut. “You want a sexy look, huh?” he asked, walking slowly toward Draco.
So this was how they were going to play it. Fine.
And yet here he was, rifling through said scumbag’s file in a train compartment that smelt like metal and dead mice.
“‘Mione and I hid out here for a bit. During the war.” The humor was gone from his voice.
Shame curled around his wrists, snaked down his legs. Buzzing energy coursed through him as he thought of Harry’s voice lowering with sarcasm, Harry’s eyebrows knitting with concentration, Harry thinking he hid his sadness well. He remembered his father’s warning about lusting after boys, and emptiness raked his stomach.
“Rice is on the table, meat’s on the stove, it’s almost done,” he said, shoving Malfoy lightly on the arm. “Enjoy dinner. Will I see you tomorrow, Harry?”
Harry had no clue who this Squashcobbler was, but Luna’s kindness warmed his heart. He looked down to see what looked like some sort of cross between moldy fruit and a dried up potato bug.
Hermione looked at him, calculating. “You said he sounded sincere?”
“Ron,” said Hermione, who was also there. Her voice had a soft quality to it. She looked him up and down, with his red shirt layered on top of blue, and smiled. "It's been awhile."
Slime shot up into Draco’s body. Draco felt the sweet substance enter his bloodstream, and it filled him with ecstasy.
RITA: What sort of phases have you been going through, dear?
“I don’t think the glass bottle minded,” grinned Harry.
ＴＨＥ ＤＡＩＬＹ ＰＲＯＰＨＥＴ
“It’s like the focus and feeling alive of shooting the pistol, but without all the other stuff.”
He was constantly searching for clues that Draco liked him. He tried to tell himself that he had no reason to be anxious. He was the ‘Chosen One,’ for what it was worth, and they were boyfriends, yet he found himself worrying that maybe Draco wasn’t all that invested.
“Jee, I dunno, I guess it’d be about-“
“Snap out of it! You didn’t do anything and I’d appreciate it if you’d stop trying to do anything now. Just leave me alone, I’ll be fine.”
If they were at each other’s throats now, how was dinner a decent plan? What, they would chit chat about what they’d been up to since the mass-murder of muggles that Malfoy was complacent to sit by and watch? But Harry had a job to do, and walking away now would hardly be sufficient. If this annoyingly cheerful stranger wanted to make his work easier, by all means, he could go right ahead.
