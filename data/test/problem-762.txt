The door on the next wall banged open to expose Pansy Parkinsion, wearing even higher heels and an even tighter dress. Harry watched Michaela swallow.
Harry apparatus them home. Thier home. And sat him down with a cup of tea, trying to keep calm and not scream. Draco was sitting motionless on the sofa, hands delicately placed on his lap, feet on the ground, and the only indication that agony and fear and such painful sadness was raging inside him were the tears that rolled slowly down his cheeks. From the doorway, Harry listened to Draco say, more to himself than anyone else:
“We are going to Lestrange house now. We will aparate in a mo.”
Draco nodded firmly once.
“We can get Ginny…a… a…”
Eyyyyy! It's the end. The curtain has fallen, the sun has set, the destination has been reached! Goodnight for now. May we let the darkness close in.
He knocked on the door and stood back. They both stared at the door and listened to the sounds of the garden. A bird in the woods towards the east was chirping loudly, almost in warning. The wind ruffled the grass and the bushes. That was the only noise for miles and miles of rolling hills and green countryside.
“Harry, look. It could, but it is too… precise. We never found anything that they didn’t want us to find. And it was all there. And we still don’t understand it. This isn’t a normal case Harry. It’s all too…”  He waved his hands in frustration, almost knocking Harrys glasses off. Harry opened his mouth, but as usual, was cut off.
Harry woke up around three in the morning with an aching back and sore eyes. He had dreamt that he and Draco had had a child. It was always Draco’s wish, and whenever it was vocalised, Harry had always rubbed him on the back and looked into his eyes and said ‘You’d be a great dad.’
“Come on Harry” Draco murmured eventually, shooting a look of incredability at his father. “Lets go home. Thank you.” He turned towards the door and swept Harry with him with the sheer forcefulness of his strides. Only once they reached the hallway did they hear Lucius call out Draco’s name carelessly. Draco squeezed his eyes shut and turned towards his father. Harry opted to stay in the dark hallway for this one.
I hope you enjoyed it, we're getting there, almost half way I think but also maths. So yeah about half way. And all of this is irrelevant. I'll update it soon, so hopefully see you then. :))
It didn’t work very well.
“Indeed. Can we have the one with vegetables please?”
“Right.” Harry replied into the space.
“No, open this one first and then that one.”
“We can’t do that.”
“Yes - with Harry’s help, of course.” Draco said.
“Ok, preposition.” Draco said, looking at the faces around the table and balancing some Lasagne on his fork. “You can all go get presents and whatever you need from your house and then come back here to stay the night and we can spend Christmas together.” He looked at all the faces in turn, surprise and relief on most faces.
He sighed, being as lost as he was before and wrote all of this up and went to find Weasley.
“Sympathetic as always.”
“Draco Malfoy, did you knit me a jumper?” Harry asked, holding up a deep red jumper with very wonky stitches.
“Potter, you’re hopeless. We can get her a tasteful blue stone bracelet.” Harry must have looked doubtful so Draco added, “It will go nicely with her hair.”
“The murders. My father. Harry come on.” Draco snapped, not unkindly, but still with a tone of urgency. Harry blinked and Draco could see the cogs whirring.
“Harry.” Draco hissed urgently.
“Good grief, shall do. Can I have the rest of your toast?”
There was a lot of shushing.
“Theo… As in Theo, Theo?”
“I didn’t mean to wake you up.”
“You think that I would hurt him? You think that I would hurt the man I love more than anyone or anything in this world? Because if you truly think that, then I suggest that you revaluate your thinking because, Ernie Macmillan, I would die for him. And that is what love is. They make you feel like whatever shit is happening, it is worth it because they are there. Love isn’t some one sided infatuation. It is dying over and over and over to give them space to breathe. It is grounding them and them grounding you so you don’t fly away in the stream of life. And you. You do not love him. This,” He spat, singling the burn marks on the walls and the injured Aurors, “Is not love.”
“Ok.”
She pursed her lips and tapped her spindly wand to the wood. All the ceramics stilled. She reached out a shaky hand, opened the doors and found the figure in question, reaching for it and kissed it’s head and handed it to Draco. He took it, paid her and thanked her.
He was.
He stayed there, hoping he would just die soon. He could feel himself loosing control of his senses and he could see the sheets getting slowly redder. All his thoughts stripped away like paint, leaving a shining tree of grief as a skeleton behind. No more. He thought as he lost consciousness.
“What is it, Draco?” he said, sounding exasperated and looking past Harry.
“What?” Was the hesitant reply the followed.
Harry reached over and silenced the alarm clock with a flick of his wand. Forms of light started to peer through the window, illuminating Draco’s skin. He was curled on his side, left arm hanging off the bed, the mark visible.
I hope you liked it. :)
“We need the potion soon, ok?”
A soon as they entered the flat, Draco buried his face in Harry’s hair and breathed in deep.
“We are buying Arthur a Christmas present.” Harry explained as he grabbed a box of cotton buds and a sponge. Draco followed him to a make up isle, looking at the rows of coloured bottles. Harry grabbed a facemask and some lip balm and went to the till.
“I mean you said you would,” Draco continued, grinning. “But I didn’t think that you actually would.”
“We were looking at potions that were black.” Harry clarified hurriedly. “But then we got distracted…”
He reached for his wand, his hand trembling. He put it to his wrist. He thought abut it and took a deep breath.
Hello! Again. I hope you're doing ok and that you like the chapter. It's a bit of a short one... As usual, comment if you feel particularly inclined to do so.
The Aurours piled into the room, all performing spells and taking samples. Ron, Ernie and Michaela were knelt by the body,  talking fixedly, signalling the corpse.
“Merlin save me.”
Draco leaned in, still clasping Harry’s hand and whispered something that sounded a lot like ‘Tea time’. They both tried to conceal their snickering and look professional.  Ron’s partner, Aurour Macmillan, came to his side with a scowl and a nod in Harry’s direction, which Harry decided to take as an acknowledgement of his exsistance. Harry let go of Draco’s comforting hand and they made their way forward, Ron giving orders to some of his team. Susan followed behind, occasionally repeating some of the orders to her team.
“‘Mionie, I have lasagna pasta but not anything else.”
The fire burned down to embers, the light reducing, nurturing the shadows to grow. Their eyelids grew heavy, and they both decided that it was time to relocate. They tracked softly over the wooden floorboards to their bedroom, fingers loosely interwoven.
Harry made a noise of agreement.
Everyone will know.
“That was so fucked.”
“Oh god.” Harry murmured.
“And Durmstrang.”
A young Aurour that Harry vaguely recognized raised his hand. Ron nodded.
“I think would call mine, Scorpious… Or something.”
Snow was starting to cap the streets in a layer of undisturbed white, flurries traveling in the wind.
The woman looked at him over her spectacles.
“That’ll be something to look forward to.” Was the reply Harry gave him absentmindedly. On the other side of the room, Draco rolled his eyes.
“Actually, I was wondering if you could get Draco on the poison case here. I mean we need a potions expert anyway.”
“The victim is Rasbatan Lestrange, he was murdered at his home in France, the weapons are thought to be poison and a knife.” He threw a picture of a mauled body onto the desk. Some people flinched. The chest was cut in deep streaks and the face waxy and pale. Everything was covered in blood. Not pleasant. People buzzed around, Blaze was barking orders at his members, Pansy directing her team to information passes for the archives.
“Flattering as always.”  He replied as Draco pulled him down into a kiss. Every time he forgot how nice it was to just kiss him.
“Your cousin is getting married. I’m sure they’d be happy to hel-”
The scarf was green with the occasional oddly placed stripe in a deep grey.
There was some audible shuffling and then some clacking of heels.
“Ok, Sir, good luck.” She added with a chuckle. They both headed out in the same direction. At the door of the kitchen, Michaela paused.
Silence.
“Regardless of having soup on your chin.” Draco confirmed as Harry felt an ankle touch his shin.
“Scorpious? Fucking Scorpious? What the fuck Draco!”
I hope you liked it. Comment if you wish and I hope your week was ok.
“Are you finished?” Harry asked.
He left to tidy the lab and lay out his utensils in preparation for the possible creation of an exceedingly dangerous poison used in a murder.
The carvings on the marked forearm were there again and it seemed like a very big part of the plot. But apparently no one spoke Latin anymore.  The good thing was that the press hadn’t got wind of any of it yet, so they have time. Not much, but some. He made Ron some swift promises to go to their flat at some point and went to get Draco.
“Harry, what is it?”
“In the right drawer in the fridge.” Harry hollered from the sofa. He heard the clunk of the drawer and the thwack of the fridge door as it closed.
“Well shit.” Pansy announced. “I thought the world was over all the ‘Chosen one’ bullshit. No offence Harry.”
They both broke into a sprint and opened the door to see what looked like half of the Aurors in the lab. Some of the shelves had been tipped over, books and bottled ingredients pooling onto the floor like spilled innards. There were burn marks on the walls like scars from an earlier fight, some of the darker ones still smoking a little.
“It’s ten past fucking nine, Harry. Get up… Or at least wake up. It’s Important.” Draco whispered bluntly in Harry’s ear.
There was momentary peace. Harry listened to Draco’s footsteps in the kitchen as he opened and closed cupboards unitl-
“Very sorry to bring you in…” He added, looking at Draco guiltily.
“No. No, Harry, I think that you will find that smooth peanut butter is far better-”
Ron cleared his throat again. “They didn’t use magic.” The buzz picked up again. No magic? Holy Shit. This is bad, no trace Harry thought. And they got away.
“What a week.” He murmured, resting his chin on Harry’s head. Harry turned the page and found the picture Pansy and taken the night before. Its was a little blurry, but it was Draco sleepily kissing the tip of Harry’s nose.
Draco smirked and took his hand.
By seven, the biscuits were gone.
“He’s right.” Ernie said sharply.
“My children.” She said waving a hand towards the glass doors.
“I can’t believe you got me an eye test for Christmas.”
“Case meeting!” Ron bellowed, as Draco knew that he was right about the owner instaintly. He heard a clatter and thumping for which he expected to be Blaise and Pansy.
He walked hastily with his IAmOnUrgentAurorBusinessDefinatlyNotLookingForSomeoneToTellThemThatThierFuckedUpDadIsVeryVeryVeryDeadAndBegForForgiveness.
Harry put his hands over his ears. He couldn’t. His thighs burned from crouching so long, but he didn’t care. ‘I can’t he thought.’ He swallowed.
He cleared his throat. “Aurour Weasley wanted me to ask about the Latin. He said that Pansy said that you were looking into it.”
More silence.
“What time is it?”
“Fine.” Draco replied curtly. “Why are you here?” He asked, but on realising that that probably sounded accusing, he added, “It’s nice to see you.”
“What, me in this shirt?”
“Ok.” Draco said softly. “Get dressed then. We need to go to the ministry.”
The teams scattered whilst Harry and Draco trudged glumly to the lab, both of them thinking the exact same thing, but neither saying it out loud. Until…
“Ok, we need tinned tomatoes and some yogurt.”
“Yep.” Ron said, looking put out.
“I love you too.” Draco whispered, kissing the top of his head.
“Hello.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake, Draco.” Harry said impatiently as he took off his glasses  and handed them to the Slytherin. Draco took them and put them on, immersing himself in the book but not quite hiding his smirk. Harry sighed and looked around the now blurry lab.
Ron walked over to Harry, who stood at his desk, shaken by the sudden offer of information.
“Darling.” She said as crouched she kissed the air next to his face. “How are you?” She asked.
Draco snorted and twisted round, taking Harry’s face in his hands and kissed him deeply.
“As opposed to a nasty one?” Draco replied steadily.
He slipped in and out of consciousness for hours until he heard the front door open and heard Hermione’s muffles shouts as she announced herself. He also heard her sharp intake of breath and scurrying footsteps up the stairs.
“It was replaced with ‘Electus est’.” He peered at Harry, who looked back at him, frowning.
“It won’t hurt you to look at the positives.”
“Maybe he is having an affair with the US minister.” Contemplated Draco. “I mean he is rather…” He waved his hand around, his brow furrowing. “…Pleasing.” He said delicately.
“You’re a bastard.”
He pushed open the door and coughed, scrambling for his wand. It smelled burnt and the air was tinted with dark vapor. Like toast ‘a bit over done’ to a new level.
They got to no conclusion.
Hello! As usual, I hope you liked it. This one was very fun to write. And the next one is funky. As usual, comment if you feel particularly inclined to do so. And as usual, I hope you're ok and goodbye.
He felt Draco nod.
He got to the door, most of the team already there. He found his report of yesterday and sealed it in an envelope, ready to send to Kingsley. He shifted some more of his piles, attempting in vain to make space on his desk.
She looked at him wide eyed.
They hadn’t moved at all and had no intention of doing so until absolutely necessary. Nether had said anything for a while until Draco nudged Harry, waking him from a light doze.
“My father used to tell me that magic was everything.” Draco rasped from is pillow.
Harry sighed and Ron rolled his eyes and went to make more tea. Hermione giggled.
“Right.” Draco confirmed.
Harry’s eyes shot open to far too much light and a fully dressed Draco perching on the edge of the bed with a newspaper in his hands.
“It feels like so long ago.” Harry whispered croakily. Draco nodded and pulled Harry in for a hug.
“Oh.” Harry exhaled. “That makes it a lot more difficult.” Draco bit his lip and nodded in agreement.  They both thought about this as the light in the city lowered, darkness clouding the skies and the lights of the surrounding buildings turning on.
“You’re covered in cat fur.” Remarked Draco, muffled.
Harry turned his attention back to the man on the floor; he was about to push for more details but he didn’t need to because Ernie looked up at him and started to talk.
Ron ignored him
“She’s apparating here soon.” He relied from Blaise’s side. Harry nodded and looked over at Draco, who was trying not to laugh at something Pansy said that had made both her and Blaise crack up. Hermione appeared at the top of the steps, arms full, hair bushy. Both very expected. She trudged down the steps and kissed Ron on the cheek.
“I didn’t do anything!” They were both smiling.
“Aww Blase! Purple! I love purple!”
“Take a look at the picture.” Ron shrugged.
“We need to go to the supermarket.” He said, putting the pot in the table in front of Draco. He served them both and sat down.
“Actually, yes, Aurour Weasley, what did you conclude from the body?” Pansy mocked, otherwise curious.
“So.” He said amused, “either you look like a disco secretary or you look like me but an intellectual.”
“Draco.”
Every wand in the room followed his movement and Blase aggressively pushed Macmillan back away from Harry with his very pointy heel that rivalled even Pansy’s so he was sprawled on the floor tears still rolling down his pale dusty face. Stumbling back from the impact, Harry noticed that Ernie was pleading, apologising over and over in hushed sobs.
“How do we know it’s the same person, sir? He asked quietly.
“Can you do an internal analysis and send me the results?”
“It is in a different language.” Harry said swallowing dryly. He let go of the arm and it flopped onto the floor. Harry looked down and swallowed.
Maybe he should just check. Y’know - to clear his mind.
He apparated to the doorway of the flat as soon as he reached the hallway. He put his key in the door and opened it to find the it pooled in warm flickering light from the fire. He breathed in the smell as he heard clangs from the kitchen, accompanied by Draco’s gentle singing.  He walked in to see Draco wearing a shirt and his wonderfully tight trousers stirring something on the stove.
“Harry, you lazy incompetent sod, wake up.” Draco said loudly.
“ ‘Electus est.’ It means ‘For the chosen one.’. It appears you have an admirer, Mr Potter.” He said peering over his glasses directly at Harry. Draco turned swiftly and looked at him with an unreadable look on his face. Harry felt like the huge room was slowly suffocating him. They all stayed looking at each other for what seemed like hours.
“Durmstrang.”
There was an owl, ministry owned by look of the tag on its leg. It was flapping and hooting in the increasingly windy outdoors. Harry opened the window and the owl came right in, shaking its leg at Draco. Confused, he took the note, opened it and read it quickly. He looked up at Harry and then went slightly pale.
“I think it looks nice.”“I bet you do. Toast?”
Harry shook the wand away from his chest and handed it to a raw hand behind him. He felt his own wand in his pocket, feeling reassured by its presence so he looked up at Draco and nodded. The blond reluctantly took the wand away from the man’s temple, his brow furrowed in concern.
“Draco?”
“Mmmmm, but now that you mention Apparate, that is a very reasonable option.”
An unfamiliar house elf opened the door and looked them both up and down.
“I am drawn to a banana.”
Draco looked at him. “No.” He replied. “He wants us to stay here and check the public records of apparations and floos to the schools.”
“Right…”
“We have to buy presents for your family.” Draco said over breakfast, quill in hand resting on top of a list. Harry murmured in agreement.
Harry peeled his eyes away from Draco’s arse and looked at the body. He had finished the charms and wanted to look over the body for any additional information. He went according to the procedure and swiftly checked the body for anything. He got to the arm and swallowed.
Ron approached them, looking very tired yet very relived.
Hope you like it! Comment if you want and have a nice week!
“What the fuck Harry?”
The room stared at them in silence.
Silence.
Ron nodded awkwardly and shuffled away.
“What about this one?”
Reluctantly he looked through the flat until he found Draco. He was lying on the bed - fully clothed and wearing a very Weasley jumper– tangled in Harry’s arms, sound asleep. Blaise grinned to himself and walked towards them. He silently lifted the Poleroid and swiftly took a photo, putting it in his boot to develop.
Tucked into a corner, they found a desk and behind the desk, they found a shriveled old woman. She was at least 80. A glass eye accompanied a frizz of white hair and whiskers. She looked up, squinting.
“Granger has been teaching me to knit.” He murmered, looking at the floor.
“Home?”
Harry enveloped him in his arms and there they stood, people bustling past them.
Harry nodded.
Draco looked over the lenses at Harry. “Draco, you fucking prat, give me my glasses!”  Draco took the glasses off and folded the arms in neatly, holding them gracefully, looking at Harry, almost daring him to take them. He thought about it, the smirk on Draco’s face growing, and lunged. Obviously, Harry missed and lost balance. Grasping the only thing in reach, he pulled Draco down onto the floor with him. Both laughing, Harry plucked the glasses out of the bastard’s hands and placed them on his face, the lab coming back into focus. He looked over at Draco and found that he was already looking at him, a small smile in place, grey eyes shining. Without thinking, Harry kissed him.
Inside the ministry, the constant flurry of people had ceased, leaving him and only a couple of other people navigating the hallways. The dark offices had always made him feel slightly out of place, like he was the only one left.
“Igor’s name has been scratched off the wall in Durmstrang and has been replaced with- Let me finish.” Draco said as Harry opened his mouth. He closed his mouth and scraped his hair out of his forehead.
“I wonder why what?” Asked Harry.
They found themselves cowering at the doorstep of a giant gray house in the middle of nowhere. A plaque at the door read ‘Lestrange House’.  Fitting, Harry thought. It was cold -being November- but this cold reached beyond the weather. There was a strange sense of unwelcoming here.
“Your hair…” He said, smirking.
“Right…” Ron said. Harry squeezed his hand. They wanted an explanation. Fucking bastards. He preyed his eyes open and regretted it instantly. It did wonders for the ache behind his eyes, nursing it and uncaging it, bringing it to a near unbearable level.
Because of me, his brain supplied. Whoever is murdering people, they are murdering them because of me. He looked up and saw Draco. His mouth involuntarily dropped open as realization struck.
This is the penultimate one! Almost there, I promise. Hope you like it... Comment if you feel inclined to do so.
One evening, whilst flicking through a copy of Potent potions, Draco said,
Ron. ‘
Harry heard Draco take a deep breath.
“I want to go with aunty Pansy.”
“Draco.” Harry murmured concerned, shifting is weight to. Draco cleared his throat.
“I really hope that my theory’s not true.” He said, pailing more and handing the note to Harry before walking briskly past him and Harry could see him pulling on trousers in the next room. He looked down at the note on his hands.
“We need peanut butter.” Draco commented as squinted at a list and placed two tins of tomatoes in a gap amongst the food. Harry took some peanut butter off the shelf.
“Cover me.” He said. They both nodded and raised their wands and walked towards Ernie with him, stopping to give them both a little distance. Harry slowly knelt down next to the broken human and touched his shoulder gently. He flinched massively. Before he knew it, Harry had a wand at his chest and Ernie had a wand at his forehead. Harry looked up, his heart thumping in his chest and saw Draco leaning over him, his wand pointed into Ernie’s grubby forehead.
“Pansy?” He checked, just in case she needed a nudge.
“I did, didn’t I? I say odd things under your submission.” He said looking at Harry with a smirk and a raised eyebrow.
“Draco, wake up, please.” He whispered, shaking Draco hard.
“You ok?” Draco asked Harry once everyone had gone and they were getting changed for bed. Harry exhaled messily.
“So we are looking for any non fatal potion.”
At the ministry, he sat at his desk briefing the team on an old building in Hogsmeade in dire need of being stripped in fear of embedded curses in the walls. It should be straightforward but a rather stubborn old man lived there and was adamant to stay.
“I suppose we ask the woman at the counter.” Draco replied, heading through the clutter and seeking a till.
“Ok Harry listen and promise not to loose yout shit.”
“What exactly are we looking for?” Harry asked, realising that he had absolutely no idea.
Blaise came in through the fireplace once his meeting with Head Aurour finished. It was dark thanks to the short winter days and he found the flat light and welcoming. And silent.
He was about to tell Draco when he remembered where he was. He looked down and saw him sleeping peacefully. He looked at his face for a while, thinking about how young he looked. He looked somehow relived of a burden. Like he had armfuls of unwanted objects taken from him. He looked still. Very still.
“It accepts any Aurour. And you.” Ron said to Draco at Harry’s side.
“Do the pasta and the rice go in the same place?” He wined helplessly.
There was a small pause as they held each other up.
“Of course.” Ron murmured distractedly.
Ron waited for silence.
“What’s happened?” He whispered far more quietly than he mean to, wondering why it had taken him this long to ask the question.
“Thank you, Aurour Weasley.”
Harry rolled over and groaned.
“And minus the scar.” Hermione said nodding.
“Harry.” Draco said as they walked through the shampoo isle.
“You think I don’t know that?” Draco exploded, waving his arm. “Do you truly think that I don’t know that being with you means that I could just get killed any other day? I knew all of that. I knew that being with you would mean that I have to take all of the shit the world thows at you and I do. Merlin knows that I do, Harry, but it’s not your job to shield me from everything, and if you panic every time something like this comes up, you will spent the rest of your life in a state of stupor that it wouldn’t matter if I was here or not.”
“Hey Draco…” Harry swallowed. Draco looked at him expectantly. “I’m really sorry - about all the things I said. I’m really sorry.”
“Harry, is something wrong?”
“Well, now you can choose your own glasses.” He murmured, flicking through the book Pansy and Hermione cobbled together. It was all very sentimental until Draco burst out laughing. In the centre of the page was a photo of Harry looking incredibly confused about life. He was in the office and his neck was visibly covered in purple blotches.
“Crazy old man with far too many cats.” Harry explained, arms still around Draco, face nestled in his neck.
“Suppose.” She accepted thoughtfully.
“Right, yeah, ok. I’ll owl him now.”  He added, running his hand up his neck. “It’s very visible, isn’t it?”
“You have no idea how beautiful you are.”
“Yep.”
The house just got weirder as they progressed. French paintings depicting brutal deaths of what Harry could only assume were part muggle wizards. Pleasant.
“You’ve got a little something.” Ron grinned, pointing to his neck. Harry touched a hand to the left side of his neck.
“What can I say?”
“My walls are perfectly fine.” The man replied as a cat curled around his legs. “Tea?”  The old man offered.
“I love you.” He whispered.
Draco raised his brows and sighed. “I suppose, if I must.”
“Mmmmph?”
Draco huffed but complied with a small smirk on his face. Harry was pushing the trolley, slowly loosing the will to live.
He fumbled momentarily and cast himself inot an appartion. He stumbled momentarily, his stomach flipping and his feet not where he expected them. He strained his ears and listened. The flat was as they had left it. Silent.
“Yes.” She said, rolling her eyes, still giggling a bit.
He cleared the fumes and looked down to find Draco curled on the floor, his shirt wet with what Harry could only assume was sweat. He dropped to his knees and crawled frantically towards Draco. He pushed him onto his back, his body limp, hair floppy and disorganized. Harry muttered to himself and tried to shake him awake. Seeing he was thoroughly unconscious, he fumbled for his wand and cast a ‘revelio’ .
Harry raised his eyebrows at the blond, who went back to his soup with a small smile.
“Of course you don’t. Of course you bloody don’t.” Harry. Muttered quietly mostly to himself.
By the end of the visit, Harry had drunk about five cups of tea and really wanted to Apparate home and fall asleep in Draco’s arms. Unfortunately, he apparated to the ministry just after he had stumbled out of the old man’s house at dusk, the cold hitting him sharp and bare.
“I’m getting the crunchy peanut butter.” He whispered into Draco’s mouth.
All the noise from the hallway was gone as the raven-haired man looked into those sad grey eyes he knew so well.
Harry considered. It looked like he was going to be here a while.
Harry pulled Draco in for an awkward side hug, knees bumping each other.
Without looking up at him, Ron replied, “Aurour Macmillan broke down in Auror Parkinsons office and when anyone came near, he cursed them. So everyone tried to get in, but we didn’t know who we were fighting so there were hexes being fired in all directions and some Aurours were hit.” He paused signalling some of Blase's team, who were covered in blood, sweat and dust. “We only lost one…But then he made a run for it and we were all chasing the same person so things became more clear. So we got him in here, but we need to know what’s going on to take further action, but he refused to speak until you were here.” He said, nodding at Harry.
“Ok, can I apparate us home now?”
“But Lestrange was stabbed too.”
“Yeah.” Harry said weakly.
“Honey, I think the lasagne is ready…” Whilst waving a hand at the oven, a small smirk on his face. Hermione bent over and yelped, pulled the oven open and let steam roll out of the oven, whilst simultaneously filling the room with a sizzling sound. She reached in with oven gloves and brought out a huge and slightly overcooked vegetable lasagne.  They all ‘oohed’ as she put the steaming tray onto the table.
“It’s two doors away from the Three Broomsticks. You know?”
They headed out of the fireplace, hands intertwined.
“My children?” The woman said, unaware she had said anything otherwise.
There was light. Far too much of it. Someone was holding his hand very softly. He groaned and reached his other hand up to his forehead.
“Merlin fucking sakes, Draco.” He muttered to himself. “It was Draco. I…” He said to Pansy. She snorted. He cleared his throat.
“Coffee?” Harry passed him a cup of coffee.
“I mean, how hard can it be? You would just have to mix bad stuff into a cauldron to kill someone.”
“Ah, Michaela, How is Mr Rumbol holding out?” He enquired after the old man.
“How are you doing?” Harry asked tentatively. Draco hesitated and frowned.
Harry went back to writing whilst thinking about Draco and home. And how both words often found a place together in his mind.
“Mmm?”
“You are going to need it, darling.” He whispered to him with a grin.
“I love you.”
They joined everyone from the kitchen doorway, Pansy smirking at them from a counter top, Hemionie and Blase cooking together and Ron, as usual, making tea and humming to himself. Leaning his head on Draco’s chest, Harry sleepily rubbed his eyes.
“I wish.” He said, “I have an early start tomorrow, five thirty.”
Several long slashes appeared through his shirt, There was blood everywhere, but he got to his feet and stumbled up the stairs, leaving a trail of deep red in the carpet, He collapsed onto Draco’s side of the bed and breathed his smell in.
Harry looked at Draco and nodded at him.
“So…?” Ron asked once they had just about sat down. Frankly, Harry was surprised that he had managed to wait so long.
“Yes.” Harry agreed, looking over at Ron, heart beating fast.
They stayed like this, silent, tears running slowly off faces until day morphed into night. Neither knew what to say, because they had talked about this moment many times, but they had never really believed that it would get to this. Because magic fixes everything, right?
Harry giggled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Indeed.” Replied Draco, rubbing his forehead.
Harry decided to send an owl to Ron, telling him that the couldn’t come in today and that they’d work at home instead. Draco insisted that he was ok, but Harry would hear him sniffing quietly once he had left the room. So he though he’d go on the side of caution just in case.
Hello! Hope you liked it. The next chapter is the best one in my eyes.
“Didn’t hear what you bastard?” Draco smirked.
“Mmm.”
It was darkening outside and the wind was wirring around the buildings, slipping around the skyward structures like it was running away from something. There was no one in the office at all, just a mess of papers as usual and a couple of scorch marks on the wall. The paper was peeling away from the burns as if it was a weeping wound on the skin and the distinct lack of noise was disconcerting to say the least. It all seemed very ‘not right’. They both looked around, Draco reaching for Harry’s hand with the intention of calming both of them. It didn’t work, Harry thought, but it was always nice to hold Draco’s hand.
Narcissa was in her lounge drinking tea and staring calmly out of the French windows. When they were anounced to her by the elf, her face lit up and she greeted them with shy kisses to the cheek. They sat and had tea with her, going over the case and eating her delicious home baked buiscuits. She had iced tiny flowers onto each one.
“You’re a twat.” Draco said softly. Harry snorted.
“What are we doing today?” He asked his team. Michaela opened her mouth to reply but the fire place flickered and burst into flames as Ron strode out, flustered and robes wonky. Everyone looked up, including Ernie Macmillan, who usually thought it was above him to care.
Ron spotted them and he looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He beckoned them over, each of the wands still trained on whoever was sobbing on the floor. As they walked, Harry saw Pansy, still in very tall boots, with a cut across her face and part of her blouse burned.
“Well… What does it mean?” Draco said impatiently. He got a glare much like his own for that.
“Hmmm.” Murmured Draco as he shifted to put his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry absent-mindedly put his arm across the Sytherin’s neck, playing with the hair on the back of his neck. Hermione smiled.
“Good evening to you too.”
“Should I open this one?”
“We should probably start Christmas shopping soon.” Harry murmured in agreement. They went back to silence, pages flicking.
“Oh”  Ron exhailed. On the inside of the arm, two words were carved into the skin, just above the Dark mark. Blood trickled slowly over Harry’s hand, trailing from the end of the second word.
Ron looked round the room and dropped his head on the desk.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sir, we are all here.” Michaela pointed out.
“Oh, yeah. Molly was teaching me how to knit.”
He pushed open the door to his lab and took in the clean smell, the white walls and the marble floor. He looked over at the counter tops, the drawers full of ingredients, the familiar stove, the bookshelf that Draco had categorized alphabetically.
Harry roles his eyes in response. “And what do you suppose we do if a couple of muggles do end up watching us disapear into nothing?”
“I appar-“ Harry attempted, trying to suppress a grin.
“Draco…”
Harry took off his robes and slung them on the desk. He collapsed into the squishiest looking chair, closed his eyes and thought about he day he had just had. It was a weird one, he’ll admit that. Corpses don’t tend to come up. Usually. He listened to Draco clatter about on the counters, his purposeful footsteps on the marble floor. It was soothing and familiar.
Blase agreed with a “That would be nice. Thank you - is that ok with you Harry?” He checked, shooting a concerned look in his direction.
“Six forty three.”
The Aurours absorbed the information and breathed. All the head Aurours exchanged helpless glances.
“None taken.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll get you an eye test for Christmas.” Harry repealed dryly. Draco simply muttered grumpily in response.
He’d forgotten about this, years of sharing a dorm and it appeared that Draco still had no respect or consideration for the awake.
“If you’re sure.”
“You would do that to an innocent child? Name it after an insect. I mean I know you are named after a reptile, but really?”
They awoke early, both preparing for the murder case. At 7, an owl flew through an open window in the sitting room. Harry took the note and read it out loud.
Draco took his hand again and Ernie’s sobs became louder and more desperate. Confused but determined, Harry looked at Ron, who nodded and then at Draco, who squeezed his hand and then let go.
“Draco, I’m so sorry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He got into the office at the precise moment Ron happened to yell  “Can no one here speak bloody Latin?” As Pansy and Blaise dissolved into a mound of giggles. Noticing Draco in the doorway, Harry waved him over, greeting him a smile. Pulling up a chair and sitting, Draco pushed his papers towards Ron, explaining the potions to all of them.
“Aurour Weasley?”
A pause.
Ron rolled his eyes in response.
“What if it doesn’t exist?”
Ron nodded.
A hint of a smile played on Harrys face.
“Sir?”
He raised a hand to the blonde’s face and traced his cheekbone forwards delicately.
“Care to elaborate?” harry asked as he reached for the kettle.
“Indeed.” Harry said, hoping that she was right. “Where to?” He asked.
“Yes, I am aware of the Three Broomsticks, thank you Michaela.”  Harry said as he got up.
They got to the centre and stared. He looked awful, deep rings under his eyes and a hollowness to his cheeks that Harry hadn’t noticed beforehand. He was on his knees and liked so utterly helpless that Harry felt a pang in his chest.
“On the corpse, there was an inscription.” Hermione flinched and subconsciously touched her forearm. “But it’s in another language.” Ron said, taking Hermione’s hand and kissing her knuckles. Draco nodded. Ron reached into the pocket of his robes, pulling out a scrap. “I copied it down.” He said, passing the piece of paper over. Draco took it and unfolded it.
Hope like. Comment? There'll be a new one soon.
“They wanted me to analyze the veritasierum for the trials. The usual.” Harry rolled his eyes. “The soup is ready.”
They were own the sofa after having made tea and grabbing biscuits. Draco was trying to read but couldn’t because the arsehole needed glasses but refused to even get an eye test because they would, as he always said would ‘ruin his complexion’, which was often followed by a meaningful look at Harry.
“Superior breeding.” Draco muttered, still not moving.
Harry went and kneeled on the other side of the body, facing Ron, Michaela and Ernie, who were still talking and started to cast some spells.
“Pansy.” He croaked as he exposed his head to look at the woman. She was wearing black heel boots, jeans, a very cozy looking patterned jumper and a strange look of purposeful determination on her face.
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes red and tired but inevitably still beautiful. Harry kissed his forehead.
“I’d count the rows of I was you.” Harry added quietly. Confused, Draco counted and thought about it.
Pansy and Blaise sat fascinated, clutching each other, Ron sat with a frown, Ernie received the news with his usual indifference and a hint of a sneer. Harry was looking at him with an expression that Draco knew he wore from time to time that made it increasingly difficult not to shut up about potions and just kiss him instead.
“So you did this out of jealousy.” Draco’s icy voice cut through the previously calm conversation. Harry scrambled off the floor and looked at Ron who gave him a warning look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco…”
But at this, the man pulled himself away and his walls seemed to come in on him.
“Did he let you?”
“Body?” Hermione squeaked, looking at Ron for an explanation. Ron cleared his throat and dictated to them all that he knew about the case. They sat in silence for a small amount of time.
“It’s ok, It’s just a dream. A bad dream.” He whispered quickly, putting his hands either side of Draco’s face, the Slytherin gripping his wrists, still breathing heavily. He looked at Harry in his eyes and started to cry.
Some of the Aurous went to the labs and others went to the owlery. Others came back to the office to write things up.
Ron started to clatter around the kitchen a little while later when Draco was more or less awake. He had brought in a pot of tea and some cream that he must have picked up before hand and everyone was clustered around the fire that Hermione had expertly lit. They were discussing all the embarrassing things they had done as children, mostly for Draco’s benefit so he could bully Harry. They were talking about an incident with the school squid. Draco was laughing very loudly, one hand on Harry’s thigh and both Harry and Ron were looking very embarrassed.
“Draco!”
“You noticed Ron three tables away?”  Harry smirked. “Do you want to talk about something?”
“That’s ok.” Harry replied, the relief that Draco was still alive still buzzing in his veins. They both got up to inspect the pasta. It had indeed been overcooked and was now grey mush.  They silently moved on to look at the tomato, which looked more edible. He took a fork and ate a mouthful with thinking.
Everyone left around noon to tell their families that they weren’t dead. Harry and Draco sat in their bomb site of a living room and admired their presents.
“Do you need your sad jumper?”  Harry said jokingly.
“You have soup on your chin.” Draco pointed out with a smirk, breaking the silence. Harry wiped it off with the back of his hand. “But I like you anyway.”
Harry tore his eyes away from the paper.
He stumbled down flights of stairs and pushed the doors open and looked. The night had properly enveloped the city and the lights from buildings slowly built up the skyline. Harry walked down several steps and looked more. He sat on a cold step and waited for seven minutes and just as he contemplated returning to find the others, he heard Draco’s voice behind him.
Harry apparated to the Three Broomsticks and found the house. It was visibly rickety and old. He could already smell the mothballs. He took a breath and knocked on the door. He heard muttering behind the other side, a bit of a clatter and the door was yanked open. A small man stood there, nice clean clothes, combed hair. Essentially, not the nutcase he was expecting.
They smiled at each other and Harry snuggled a little closer.
The next days passed without incident, layers of investigating and samples and evenings flicking through books with Draco in the lab trying to find anything vaguely along the lines of anything to do with the poison. And high neck tops. A lot of them.
“Meet you outside the ministry?”
“It’s had been a really bloody weird day.” Ron said suddenly. They all laughed anxiously in agreement.
“What the fuck is that?”
There was a unanimous murmur in agreement.
“Hold up, everyone. They’re not using Harry’s name. They are doing it for him.” Blaise said determined.
Lucius sniffed. Harry tried to sink into the shadows.
“Yep?” Ron responded, looking up from the deep stab wounds.
“Pans. This… Thank you.” Draco stuttered.
Making the decision to divide and conquer, Harry went into the processing room for public floo departures and Draco went to trace all the public appartaions.
Draco agreed and they decided that they would meet a couple of hours later at their apartment after showering.
“Hey guys?”
“It’s Lucius. They’ve got him.” He chocked. “He’s gone.”
They fell silent, Draco still grinning.
“Harry Potter.” Draco sighed when they broke apart. Harry chuckled. “You are far too good at distracting me.”
So there are going to be two chapters a week up until Christmas. No promises it'll be regular and I am very aware this is a digital equivalent of me talking to myself but I will continue regardless.
“At four thirty. ”
Everyone waited, the room silent. Harry could almost feel waves of impatience coming from Draco.
Pansy looked at Blaise, and everyone stayed exactly where they were, the tension for the unknown stretching across them like a bed sheet on an oversized mattress. Ron opened his mouth but Pansy held up a pointy finger and silenced him, whilst still looking at Blaise.
“Holy shi- I mean… Wow. That’s a long time.”
“Lets go.” Draco said as he got up, took the jumper off and folded it neatly and placed it on the chest of drawers and brushed his clothes down.
“Can you pass me another biscuit please?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron left, closing the door behind him. Draco and Harry looked at each other like children that had just been told off.
It was knitted thick wool and was a beautiful shade of green with an ‘H’ in the middle in a tasteful mustard yellow. Harry had often asked Draco why he likes it so much and his reply was always a defensive ‘It’s nice.’ But really he liked it because it smelled like Harry and it was his. The last time it was brought out was when Draco accidentally hit a bird with his wing mirror when Harry was teaching him to drive. The bird was fine but Draco sat there on the sofa in his large green jumper, cradling this perfectly healthy, slightly shaken bird whilst sobbing for an hour and twenty three minutes.
“I do put you through many hardships.” Harry said as he placed a pot on the stove and lit the gas.
The final was called ‘Mente Plumentum’. This one looked the most promising but made the least sense in the mind of a killer. It numbed the nerve endings, causing disorientation and loss of feeling. Why would anyone murdering care about pain?
Draco clenched his fists. “Look, father, I’ve tried to tell-”
The wind picked up and rattled the windows, the clouds collecting, obscuring the moon. Snow was forecast for the next day, giving the feeling of being fully submerged in winter. The guests left around eleven, having drunk many cups of tea and eaten leftovers from the fridge.
Draco took it. It was an unwrapped book, and on opening it, they saw all the photos Pansy and Hermione had taken over the year the final one being the one that she had just taken of them.
“Draco…”
“Merry Christmas Draco.” Harry murmured into the blonds chest. “I love you.” He added.
The sheets were white and fluffy, curving around their bodies closely. Draco sleepily reached over and clasped Harry’s hand gently as they both fell into a deep sleep.
“Fucking hell! How many times have I tried to tell you!” Draco shouted. “I am not going to marry a woman. Ever. Not for you and your reputation and most certainly not for me.”
Pansy was there, looking through the file, the occasional Aurour passing through with documents.
“Ok then, what would you call your child?” Draco asked calmly, head tilting to the side in a challenge
She sighed. Harry took that as a yes.  He pulled himself together and walked to the potions department to find Draco.
Where could he be? Harry paused for a moment and tried to stay clam aulthough brutal images flashed through his mind and it becasme almost impossible. Flat. Their flat.
And they did.
“Good morning Mr Rumbol, I am here to talk about these walls of yours.” The old man looked reluctant but opened the door. Harry swallowed and smiled, waiting for the man to lead the way.
“Well, make sure they do.” Ron said eventually. Draco nodded swiftly.
“Fuck! What the fuck was that?” Draco exploded.
“I am ‘fraid that he is rather unmovable. I tried to explain the technicalities of the aftermath of dark magic, but he didn’t seem to listen. Or care.” She added with a shrug.
“Fuck! What the fuck are you doing here.” Draco panicked, not entirely conscious and banging his head on the front board of the bed as he tried to sit up. Blaise resisted the temptation to drop to his knees with exhasperation and laughter. Harry shot up into sitting position and felt around the sheets for his glasses.
“Ready.” Draco said as he took his hand, searching his face with his eyes.
He pulled himself out of his thoughts and trying to focus on the conversation.
“Oh, so I’m the problem now? It’s me?”
“No problem.”
“Oh please you know as well as I do that no one is coming up the stairs. Footsteps echo.” He said in hushed tones, jumping up and down to demonstrate. He flung up a hand as the echo rolled round. They both looked up at the many flights that they had left to camber up. Draco raised an eyebrow which was less of a ‘Am I right or what?’ and more of a ‘When are you going to give in?’.
“That’s bullshit, but yes, I’ll cook.” Harry replied. Draco smirked and pulled himself onto a counter top.
The note was slightly singed.
“They have extensive knowledge about death eaters and is weirdly obsessed with me.” Harry said slowly. Draco nodded. “But that can just be a crazy fan who has a bunch of books on death eaters.”
“Why the minister splinched himself.” Looking up as if expecting an answer. “I mean, he needed to be distracted.” She said, threading her fingers together and resting her chin on them in deep thought. The room was silent.
Draco smirked and said “Not much.”
“What the fuck?”
Harry growled.
“It was grim.”
He found the blonde leaning on the wall outside  the office door, looking both far too sardonic and attractive to be acceptable. Feeling a smile grow on his face without permission, he fell into step next to Draco and wiped the day from his mind.
Draco heated, froze, extracted and cast spells at the potion in attempt to find out something - anything about the blasted thing that wasn’t ‘it’s black’.
“Draco.” He felt all the feelings that he had ignored flood into his chest.
He saw streams of steam coiling out of the cauldron, dark and sinister. He needed to turn the heat down. He took a panicked step but he was on the floor before he knew it. He tried to call out but he groaned and ended up coughing. He looked up at the clock, the disk floating shiny on the wall.
“Soup ok?”
Draco gritted his teeth. “It’s important. I wouldn’t have come if it wasn’t.”
Harry grumbled but got up and followed Draco, grabbing his robes on the way out.
He opened the door, her plump face looking up at him, a smile breaking at the thought of company.
By midday, they had assembled a rough list of possible ingredients that the potion could entail. It was progress at least. Ron came in at twoish with another vial, three sandwiches and a grimace. They told him about their progress and he seemed optimistic in a very Ron way. He left them a sandwich each and the vial of potion from the second killing.
Draco snorted and wrote it down.
“Harry.”
“I had to!”
“I’m going to make the potion tomorrow.” Draco said, mostly to himself.
“Draco, what is it?”
“I had a boyfriend for about two weeks in primary school but then he called me fat so I punched him.” She was in deep thought.  “Anyway, I find other amusements now.” She said breaking her thoughts with a devilish grin. “Have a good day Sir.”
“I supposed it is a bit tighter than usual.”
Ho ho ho it do be gettin' funky doe! And by that I mean, yes, I did actually write more that 500 words. Thank me later. Or not.
“We are leaving now.” He told his father. They started walking away.
“What about him?” Harry asked from the kitchen.
Fresh darkness poured through the windows as they huddled under the blanket. Drcao was in his sad jumper and there came a quiet balance to the silent morning.
“No, you prick, the coffee!”
“You mutalated them. You carved ‘Electus Est’ into their skin.” Harry interrupted, rage bubbling in his chest at the unnecessary deaths of these people. Ernie hung his head and nodded.
The doors opened and the house elf scurried away, leaving them feeling very much alone as they walked into the room.
Overall, it was a very pleasant stay, but there came a point when Draco remenbered what he had come for and saw fit to bid his mother goodbye. She left them as she had greeted them, with a smile and sadness in her eyes.
“Harry.”
“Blaise, you have to tell them.” Pansy whispered. Everyone heard.
“Well, I would but I am not authenticated to do so.’” Draco said, rasing a sardonic eyebrow.
“Can I stop wearing high neck jumpers then?” Harry said, leaning back onto the pillow and closing his eyes.
It's a bit of a short one again. Very dramatic. I hope you like it...
“Especially the tasty ones.”
“It’s just about the security, Draco. And…” He paused. “It wouldn’t harm ones reputation.” He said reluctantly. Draco was visibly fuming now but Lucius didn’t notice. “And.” He continued. “There is the subject of heirs…”
“Yep we have what we need. Someone find the pasta.”
“Hello.”
Pain shot through his wrist but he didn’t feel it. He changed hands and did the same to the other. Blood pooled from his wrists and stained the floor a deep red. He tilted his head back and cried out silently, tears pouring from his eyes, blood bubbling from his veins.
“Just… Get some bananas please.”
“No.” Was the reply he got.
“Yes, I think so. You?”
“Ok. Promise you won’t go off and be dramatic and ‘avenge’.” Draco replied in air quotes.
“Come here.” He murmured softly. Draco obliged and walked towards him with a small smile. Harry took his hand and laced their fingers together. He looked at Draco, who looked straight back at him.
Harry nodded in agreement and buried his face into Draco’s shoulder with a short burst of laughter.
“Oh, Harry.” She’d said through tears. She tried. She cast charms and gave him potions that just dribbled down his chin. But it didn’t work. He was too far gone.
“With this.” Draco said, sweeping a hand over his neck. “It’s very distracting…” He added, burying his face in the raven hair.
Harry went over to her and cast a cleaning charm on his hands. She looked up at him and then started laughing.
“And” He continued. “They have defaced Snape’s portrait and scratched-.”
Harry nodded. Draco cupped his cheek and turned his face up to his. “You ok?” He asked, squinting at Harry.
Harry helped Ron, Ernie, Pansy and Blaise with the investigative side of things whilst Draco locked himself in his lab and did endlessly complex things to the potion.
"I gotta go, sweets. I'll see you at dinner, yeah?" Harry kissed him once more before dashing out the door. Amused at Harry's rush, Draco slowly got out of bed, letting his sore backside get used to standing before starting to put his clothes on. Abruptly the door re-opened before Harry poked his head back in.
"Really?" Harry groaned when Draco nodded in response. "I promised Ron we would practice Quidditch after breakfast! He's going to kill me." After giving Draco a quick morning kiss, Harry quickly jumped out of bed, still naked and so sexy that Draco was tempted to pull him back into bed and keep him there the rest of the day. Instead, he just admired his leanly muscled physique as he hurriedly pulled on his clothes from the day before.
"But, what about father?" Draco asked while nervously chewing his lip after their hug ended.
******************************
"What is it?"
After Harry squirted his last drop of cum, Draco promptly rose and turned Harry around. He then bent him over, telling him to brace his hands on the wall in front of him. Harry did so obediently. He knew what was coming next and despite already cumming, he wanted it. He wanted Draco to fill him up. Immediately Draco pushed two lubed fingers into his tight asshole, making Harry moan in renewed lust. He worked Harry hard, adding a third finger moments later and stretching him as quickly as he could without hurting him. The time apart seemed to have made him tighter than usual and Draco couldn't wait to pound into him. It wasn't long before Harry was begging for Draco to replace his fingers with his cock.
"Harry, mate. Why?" Dean asked.
"Oh Harry, you feel so good inside me. Pease, baby, I need you to fuck me hard." At those words, Harry's control completely snapped and he reared his hips back only to slam them back into the tight and previously virgin hole of his sexy boyfriend. He slammed into him over and over until they were both drenched in sweat and Draco was almost sobbing with the need to cum. Still, Harry ploughed him until he himself was close to cumming. Then he grabbed Draco's weeping dick and pumped him in time to his hard thrusts. A few seconds later, Draco cried out as he came hard, painting both himself and Harry in thick ropes of sticky white jizz.
"Hands and knees, Potter. I'm taking that other sweet hole of yours too." Harry's face lit up and he hurriedly moved to comply. Soon he was positioned in the middle of the bed, ass up and previously stretched hole gaping invitingly at Draco.
Harry looked around once more before quietly slipping into the room only tp close and lock the door before Draco could get a good look inside. However, Draco's determination didn't waver one bit. His father had taught him a useful spell for times like these.
"Tilly, right?" Harry asked as she got near. She looked up at him in shock, not used to someone asking her something that didn't have to do with work. She hesitatingly nodded in response. Harry smiled brightly at her. "Thank you for taking up my things." Harry said. Tilly looked down bashfully before raising her head again and curtsying.
Draco was loving the taste of his boyfriend's cock. He loved the way he moaned and begged Draco for more and he loved the way his hips bucked into him when he found the most pleasurable spots with his tongue. He just loved him, period.  Draco pulled Harry's cock out of his mouth just long enough to wandlessly lubricate his fingers before swallowing him again. Harry soon felt a slick digit gently rubbing the outer ring of his back entrance. It was driving him crazy as it only circled around his needy hole without giving him the penetration he desperately wanted. Draco continued to tease him like that for a few more minutes before giving into Harry's pleas and finally pushing his whole finger all the way inside him.
"Yes what?" Harry asked for clarification.
"You might be right, but probably not." Draco looked unconcerned as he brushed some imaginary lint off of his shirt. "You see, Harry has been mine from the moment we met, in one way or another. His mind has always been filled with me, whether it has been in hatred or attraction, it has always been me. So maybe if we never gave into our attraction you would have been together, and maybe you would have been happy. But I guarantee you that Harry would have been miserable with you." Draco delivered this speech in the coldest tone of voice that Harry had ever heard him use, and Harry had made it a goal to piss Draco off every chance he got.
The next few days Draco watched Harry for the telltale signs of him slipping away. Draco was even too busy watching Harry to start his usual fights with him. It wasn't until the fourth day of Draco's vigilance that Harry had grown tired enough to call him out on it. This had lead to a big blowout fight that left them both red-faced and panting with rage. Afterwards Harry had stomped off and Draco had pretended to go the opposite direction, only to circle around and make his way to what he had named 'Harry's Wank Room". Draco had an inkling that Harry would go there after their fight as he had spied a slight tent in his trousers after their row. It was surprising to him that Harry seemed to get turned on by their fights, but it also made a weird kind of sense. Harry had gone there last time after they fought after all.
Draco didn't know what he expected to find, but it certainly wasn't what he did. The room was almost as shabby as the door that led to it. There was furniture set all over the place, seemingly at random. Some of it looked broken and some of it seemed okay, if a bit dusty from being stored too long. Harry had seated himself on a bed that was situated directly across from the door after discarding his bookbag on the floor next to it. Draco found himself wondering why Perfect Potter would ever have a need for a room so far away from his adoring fans. He soon found out.
As for Draco, he was great. He finally had the man who had made him realize he like men in his bed and on his arm. For the first time in his young life he was truly happy. For every meal they met in front of the Great Hall so they could chat and hold hands before they had to separate to their respective tables, and they spent every weekend together. Draco had met Ron and Hermione 'officially' during this time as well. He apologized for his past behavior and while they weren't best friends immediately, they were well on their way to being acquaintances at least.
"Invisibilia mihi." Draco whispered while pointing his wand at the door. The door went completely see-through, but only for Draco. Harry would still only see a solid door and no one else that happened to walk by would be able to see inside the room either. The spell was a good tool for spying.
"He's a hot git." was his only reply before Hermione saved him by reminding everyone of the potions test later that day. Everyone groaned and started to lament their lack of studying over the last few days and Harry ate the rest of his food in peace. He shot her a grateful smile before catching Ginny getting up to leave out of the corner of his eye. Excusing himself, Harry quickly followed her out of the great hall.
A few hours of their weekends were always dedicated to hanging out with/getting to know the people important to each other. Harry had also 'officially' met Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy, and Blaise. They were distrustful of his sudden affection for Draco at first, but when Harry told them how long it had actually been since he realized his feelings for the pale man they had backed off a little. Harry could tell he still wasn't completely trusted but he was slowly growing on them as he spent time with them. They weren't so bad themselves either.
From the sitting room sofa, Harry listened to the pound of the shower, sighing. Draco had been in there for almost forty five minutes. And he was singing off key.
Anyway, good luck, I hope you like it and as usual, feel free to comment. Apologies, it took a little longer to post than usual...
“I mean Ernie macmillan! Who would have known?” Blase said softly. T
“It’s ok, It’s ok, nothing happened.” Harry said, rubbing Draco’s side, still holding him up. “It was just a dream.”
“Because I told him that we shouldn’t be together if it means he’ll get killed.”
“Then you loose me either way!” Draco screamed. “You. Will. Loose. Me. Either. Way. I’d rather die.” He spat.
There was a thin line of bloody spittle down Lestrange’s chin. Poison.
“What is going on?” He asked Harry. Harry explained the case. He looked at Draco’s face seeking a reaction and found a very badly concealed smirk.
“I inhaled the vapor, didn’t I?” He asked after a moment. Harry’s face told him the answer.  “Fuck.” He said as the nausea reached a point of unavoidance. Everyone was silent, apparently in their own thoughts. He felt his body lurch.
“What?” He asked, sweeping a hand through his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Unless thy didn’t mean for the potion to kill.” Draco said slowly.
“Mmmm.”
They looked at each other, then at the book, then back at each other again.
“Shaklebolt sent an owl at six this morning asking if I could come back a day early. Because of this case.” He clarified.
“Ok.” Ron bellowed, “Mine and Aurour Bones’s team connect to a leader and apparate.” The ten or so Aurours grabbed each other’s arms and waited patiently.
“We have to get them.”
They heard a well pronounced, “Very well, let them in.”
At the end of the twisting hallway to the left, Harry saw the sheen of wards and protective magic. He looked at Ron, who nodded.
“Head Auror meeting. Now!” He bellowed.
People talked to him, he nodded and hummed in time but he didn’t take anything in. Ron asked if he was ok five times in the space of the day. He didn’t ask where Draco was.
The kettle clicked.
Harry took a deep breath.
“Mmm?”
“Yes Michaela.”
“It’s peanut butter?” Harry replied.
“I’m going to lie down.” Draco announced softly.
Harry looked at him. He stood there, eyebrows raised, examining his nails. He had no idea how he got through school without realizing just how beautiful Draco was. And those tight trousers didn’t lessen the impact.
Harry put the note down, ran his hands through his hair and then grabbed his wand, and joined by Draco at his side, they apparated to the ministry.
“And the-”
“We should probably find him then.” Blaise muttered, mostly to himself, fiddling with the hem on his dress.
Hello! Last one! Have a nice Christmas (if you don't celebrate Christmas then happy holidays). I hope you like this one...
More silence. Pansy and Blaise started muttering to to eachother and Ernie stared at his feet.
Harry still looked clueless.
They both worked furiously for about an hour, the sun sinking low beyond the horizon. Harry scribbled the last words, read it over and put it on top of one of the precariously stacked piles and switched off his desk light and headed for the door.
“I knew nothing good would happen if I fell in love with you.”
“Draco.” Harry hissed, taking the blonde’s hand in both of his as he sat up. “Draco, wake up.” He said kissing his knuckle. “Draco. Draco, come on.” He said, starting to panic.
Harry made eye contact with Ron across the rug and they both shared a look of hopelessness so unenthusiastic one would assume they were in a funeral parlour.
“Pansy. We are waiting for Pansy.” Ron said, to no one in particular.
Draco strode over to the desk and only then Harry realised how far away they were standing. He placed a piece of parchment on a clear spot of the table. It was littered with books and papers and ink pots of all shapes and colours. He picked it up and peered at it over his delicate spectacles and for a moment, Harry was disastrously reminded of Draco.
The body of Rasbatan Lestrange was mulled and grey. The layer of protective magic did nothing for his waxy complexion, making him look very dead.  Harry mentally slapped himself. Of course he looked dead.
Ron was apparently rendered to silence. “Are they paying you overtime?” He managed eventually.
“Yes.”
“Someone has died. Suspected murder, no traces of killer.” The room was silent, eyes wide.
Draco examined his finger nails, smirking.
“It’s a big one. Really no suspects?”
“Well fuck me.” Draco murmured, apparently revelling in his correctness.
“I made it.” He managed. The faces looked at him. “The potion. In the murder. It’s this one. I’m almost certain.”  He squeezed his eyes shut and ignored the burning nausea in this stomach. He could feel them all looking at him.
“No, Draco, I’m not done.” Harry snapped, anger flaring for the whole situation. “You can’t be hurt – not because of me and - ”
The moment he got into the hallway, he started sobbing, big heaving sobs that shook his whole body. He sank to the floor and stayed there. ‘I can’t do this’ he thought ‘I can’t.’ He tried to take some calming breaths, but he ended up with more haptic sobs. He thought about Draco.
So they stayed at home and occasionally traded owls with Ron on any updates on the case, they were mostly, Harry supposed, to reassure Ron that progress was being made even though it really wasn’t.
“Yes. Ron and the team are there.”
“Draco. Please. We have been here before… Most nights, you know what, yeah, every time we don’t Apparate, we have this conversation.” Harry muttered as they trudged up another flight of steps.
“Merlin fucking Christ alive.” Harry muttered as he stood up and strode to the door. Draco stood there, holding a packet of rice in one hand and a packet of spaghetti in the other.
By eight, he had drunk four cups of coffee (which he found with a flood of feeling in the fridge) and had left the flat and was stomping angrily to the Ministry. The streets were empty and totally silent, the raw cold of December being his only bitter company. About half way, he realised that this was the first time in six years that he hadn’t left Draco a note after an argument.
“Yes, Draco, the pasta and the rice go in the same place.”
“I am quite sure you would like to hear about it, Draco.” Harry whispered trying to coax him out of the deep sleep he was in. He touched his bony shoulder gently to shake him. He shook him carefully. Nothing. He shook him again. Still nothing. He shook him a little harder and started to panic. A Medi-Witch came rushing in, looked at the scene that lay ahed and called something into the half lit corridor behind her. Harry was frantically trying to wake Draco from his sleep, shaking his shoulder. One of Draco's hands fell out from under the sheets then hitting the metal bed post with a clang that ran through the room. Everything stilled. Harry looked down at Draco and without thinking he sunk to the floor and threaded his fingers through Draco’s, still willing his eyes to flutter open, knowing it was all in vain. Time became stretched like a piece of gum, because when he lifted his head, his face was wet with tears, the daylight was streaming in and a witch in blue robes was looking cautiously into his eyes and telling him to go home, get some rest. Do you have a family member or friend to check on you? Yes. Do you need us to bring you some coffee for now. No. Ok, we will contact you for further arrangements. Yes. I am sorry, Mr Potter. So am I.
He rushed down to the lab and the Aurour HQ without thinking. He wasn’t there.
Death eaters. Why? Harry asked himself.
“Um, excuse me do I not get a say in this?” She asked accusingly.
Harry stood there at ten past four, expecting Draco. It wasn’t like him to be late in the slightest. Let alone ten whole minutes late. Harry checked his watch again, bit his lip nervously and decided wait five more and then go to the lab, just to check. Just in case.
“Where do I put the lettuce?” Draco shouted across the flat.
He shook the feeling away and stumbled towards the potion and mixed it. It was a really dark blue. Or maybe purple. Draco squinted into the cauldron and tried to determine the colour. Maybe it was a dark green.
Draco had already made comments about the length of Harry’s choice of carrot, lord knows what he’ll come up with next.
“Why hello, Aurour Weasley.”
“That’s not what I’m saying Draco, and you know it.” Harry shouted at him.
“If something ever happened to you. Ever. I… I don’t know what I’d do.” He said to Draco, looking at him. Draco smiled softly at him - a smile that is reserved for special occasions.
The sad jumper – It is to be noted - was formally Harry’s, but it had fallen into  Draco’s hands and was now very firmly his.
He started off with a brisk march but gave in to a run about half way. He could feel that something was wrong. Ignoring all the strange looks he was getting, he jogged through the labyrinth of corridors. He got to the white door, panting and knocked, trying not to let the panic be audible in the thumps. He waited and listened.
Once they apparated to Diagon Alley, armed with scarves, hats and gloves, they started the laborious quest to buy presents. Making their way through the snow and weaving through the people, they managed to find most things on their list with the exception of the things that needed to be bought in muggle London and Lucius’s figurines.
“Yes Auror Weasly.”  They both replied weakly.
“If you’re sure.” Harry said as he shrugged his coat off. “What do you feel like?” He asked.
“Fuck.” He whispered.
Everyone started shuffling and gathering their things.
Harry thought about it. Ron likes food. And Quiddich. And disgusting things. Right.
“Draco.” Blaise whispered. Nothing.
“Harry?”
“But… This gives you nothing Draco.” Harry said,
“…everyone will know by the end. Merlin fuck.” Pansy muttered. Ron hummed in agreement.
So they left the room filled with tired people and walked into the dark night, the cold air hitting their faces as a shock and then a relief.
“Draco?” They heard Lucius’s voice come from the study. Draco stayed where he was. Lucius appeared in the doorway.
He smiled to himself and went to get dressed as quietly as he could. He put his robes over the top of his shirt and trousers and walked towards the bedroom door. He stopped, realizing that he left his keys were on his bedside table and went to get them. He put them in his pocket and scribbled a mildly insulting note for Draco to wake up to.
Once Harry got home, Draco was washed and dressed.
Harry became desparate when Draco started whimpering; sweat collecting at his forehead, hand clammy.
Coming to the conclusion of the ingredients of the potion, he traced the availability of each, ruling out five of the eight potions he and Harry had previously decided on.  One was a potion called ‘Inarquescentibus’ that amplified all feelings, emotional or otherwise. The next was “Nonpellis’ and it alters the quality of skin, making it less functional. It was soften used for surgery but, Draco thought, if one were to stab someone brutally, it would make the whole ordeal a lot easier.
“Yes?” Harry yawned in reply. There was a pause.
“Shit. Well, I suppose I’ll get ready to analyze a corpse then.” He said, picking at the things on his desk.
But had they been able to see into the heavens, they would’ve heard Draco Malfoy scream Harry Potter’s name and they would have seen two happy young men run into an embrace that warmed people’s skin like the sun and touched people’s hearts like music. They’d see an honest embrace that lasted what seemed like years. They’d see relief, sadness, happiness, grief.
“Harry, I need you to read a little.”
“So he’s not with you?”
“Do you want tea, Sir?” She asked as she leaned on the door frame. Harry considered it.
“There’s a woman at a counter?” Harry asked quietly whist following draco.
He set off at a brisk walk, leaving the office in a little more disrepair than he came to it in and shuffled as quickly as he could to the apparation department trying not to look worried. He clamly pushed each door open and asked the occupant if they had seen Draco at all. Someone told him that Draco had left over half an hour ago. This was when he let a little bit of the panic of imagination run though his veins.
“Can I have my glasses?”
“I said, hurry up!” He shouted.
Pansy pressed her mouth into a thin line and nodded grimly. Draco swallowed, his elbow starting to wobble from resting on it. They lost themselves in the thought. Pansy cleared her throat.
“Did you knit me a scarf?” Draco whispered.
They were all sitting on the floor infront of the fire, the chimes from the church ringing through the open window.
Draco grabed his hand and they set off towards the flat. “You’re implying that I didn’t look like an intellectual before so you must be mistaken.”
There was rummaging in the kitchen.
“Thanks ‘Mionie, this is just want I needed.”
“See you soon Michaela.” And he left, slightly baffled.
“Ok, we can make this work.”
“Aurour Macmillan… Ernie, can you tell me what is going on?” He asked quietly and patiently, figuring that this man was going through something. It takes a lot to kill someone, even if it is an accident.
They walked in silence for a while until Draco took Harry’s hand, smiled and said,
Harry managed to wrestle the glasses off the slick bastard and push them victoriously on his face.
Oh, and here was a corpse on the floor.
“Huh, I can see that.” She said. “It must have taken a while.” She said, staring intently at Harry’s neck. Harry wrinkled his nose.
“Are you coming too?”
Harry crawled under the covers, Draco climbing in too, enveloping him in a hug. Harry sighed and they both fell into a deep uninterrupted sleep.
Tear drops of light started emitting themselves from the cauldron. He watched them floating through the air. Feeling a strange inclination to touch them, he let go of the spoon and it fell with a clatter on the floor. He walked forward but his feet didn’t move and he stumbled, hitting the cauldron out of place. He turned messily, his vision undeniably wrong, his mouth too wet and sticky, his limbs unresponsive.
Macmillan's head shot up at Dracos voice and he looked desparate for a split second before he started howling and throwing himself at Harry’s feet.
Draco jumped up and down like an exited puppy. “Ha! Ha HA! I told you! He was fucking him the whole time!” He shouted at the top of his lungs. An old lady gasped and Harry offered her an apologetic glance.
“Nope, not yet.” Was the loud reply.
Looking down at him now, Harry say the circles under his shining eyes, his pale, his hollow cheeks. He saw the man he loved almost as far away from life as one could be. Harry took his hand, exposing a skeletal wrist from under the cold covers.
“Well it sounded an awful lot like that.” He hissed. Harry growled again.
“You alright?” Harry murmured softly onto the blonde’s neck as he pulled him closer. Draco muttered something into Harry’s head. He pulled the dark mop closer.
“Why is it, that you can do really intricate meals, but not boil pasta?” He asked throughout the mouthful.
Deciding silently to move on, they unlocked their fingers and walked towards the potion rooms briskly, wands in hand. Half way down the corridor, they heard a shout and a large movement of footsteps and a huge crash.
He collapsed onto Harry’s knees and shivered, not entirely sure of what he was feeling. He was vaguely aware of Harry casting a patronus and footsteps entering the room behind them. However close or far apart these events were from each other was hazy. The room was less fuzzy and the rage inside his head lessened to a soft hum. He screwed his eyes shut and ground his teeth and tried to focus on not throwing up. He thought about Harry’s hand in his and the warmth that came with it. He thought of Harry’s smile and the way he felt when he finally saw him through a crowd of people. Slowly, he slipped back into his own mind and lost control again.
“We can go tomorrow.” Draco answered through a forkful of food.
“Fuck.”
“So fucking weird.” Pansy added form the other side of the room. They all nodded sleepily.
“Is that it? You’re not going to defend my honor or anything?”
Harry walked in, suddenly realizing that he had spent the morning shivering from cold once the warmth and familiarity of the office hit him.
“Ernie.” Draco exaled, the shocked expression on his face unusual yet so fititng.
They all sipped the warm drink in silence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And the grey is each month?”
“Fuck.” Draco said as he flopped back onto the bed. “I’d forgotten about that.” Harry absentmindedly bit his lip and put a hand in Draco’s hair.
Hope you like. Thank for read.
“I think I’ve found something.” Ron looked up and gazed over at the arm.
He got to the Aurour HQ after what seemed like hours of listening to the soles of his shoes clicking against the floor.
No one said anything for a while, the knowledge that they had almost let Christmas slip away in the forefront of their mind. Blase silently tapped Hermione on the shoulder, making her jump and said,
“We aren’t here for your plates.” Draco said softly, squeezing Harry’s hand. “We would like to buy one of your figurines.”
“Ok.” Draco said, pushing the chair back and ruffled Harry’s hair as he walked passed. Ernie scrunched up his nose and tried to disguise his discomfort in organizing papers.
“Did you listen to a word I said?”
“He accepted.” She cheered “But-“ Harry interrupted. “- Under the condition that he’s only relocated for two weeks maximum-” She scoffed. “And that his furniture stays precisely where it is.” She scoffed again. “And, finally, that he can take his cats wherever he is temporarily relocated to.”
“Remind Blaise.”
“Fucking optimism.” Draco muttered into his coffee.
“Wait, what day is it?” Draco asked, putting an arm around Harry. He was met with silence as they all looked at each other to confirm that no one knew. Hermione took out her phone and gasped.
“I don’t fucking know.”
“Oh, and I got the results of the internal analysis from Ron.” Draco said to Harry as he got up and walked swiftly over to a set of very organized drawers. He got the paper and passed it to Harry.
“Ok. How do we get it?”
“’Electus est.’ into it,”
Harry swallowed. “Ready.” He whispered, looking straight into those familiar grey eyes.
Draco.
“How do you know what I am going to say?”
Draco grumbled in reply but carried on flicking through the book.
“Unless what?” Harry asked
“Harry - ”
“Fuck no.” He muttered as he pulled Harry into an apparition.
“I’m going to visit the body. Heads, Ernie and Michaela, come with me. Rest of Aurours, carry on with prior investigations.” A chorus of ‘Yes Sir’ came from the crowd. Ron turned to Harry and Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes Auror Weasley.” Harry said.
“I love it.” Draco said, putting it on with out hesitating and pulling Harry in for a deep kiss. The noise around them stopped and Pansy took and other photo, took it from the camera as it was fed out of the slit, placed it face down on her thigh and grinned at them.
Harry looked at him helplessly for a split second and passed him the packet.
Harry grinned back. “He left to be in a relationship with the US minister.”
“Mmm.”
“Draco.” Harry murmured warningly, knowing that fending him off the thought was very much an attempt in vain.
They went back to flicking, Harry struggling with the books, Draco obviously happier than ever.
“Well, I was wondering if it’s true that you are dating Aurour Malfoy?” She asked, eyebrows raised and a slight smile playing on her face. At Draco’s name, Harry smiled.
“Michaela, go home soon, ok.” He said, pausing in the doorway. She nodded at him from her chair.
Ron paused and then nodded, knowing full well that was a lie.
“Harry just listen to me for onc - ” Draco snapped back at him.
They kept the stare in mind and apparated to the ministry at 7:29, getting there very much on time. They walked through the halls, acknowledging glances thrown their way by familiar faces.
“Mmm.” Harry murmured, sliding his arms around the blonde’s waist and pulling him closer. “Will you take the case?”
“No, I don’t think I want to hear this.” Draco murmered to him, still frowning.
They was a chorus of agreement from the living room, where everyone was placing mounds of presents into a pile near the window. Hermione was sticking up lights on the mantlepeace, fixing them with an occasional charm and Rose was in Pansy’s arms, who was swaying softly in time to some music playing on a record player in the corner that someone had brought. Blase and Ron were fixing bedding together - they were laying sheets and blankets everywhere.
“I see…” Ron said. “We can resume tomorrow.” He said after a pause, telling them with a stare that they were going to be on time and that they will work. Efficiently.
He pushed it away and whipped his hand across his mouth and flopped onto the pillow and shut his eyes. Fucking criminals.
“It looks like Latin.” Draco said, frowning. Ron nodded eagerly.
Harry sighed. And before than he could even finish saying “Fine.”, Draco pulled him onto an apparition and left him panting and dizzy on the doorstep as he let himself in.
“We still need yogurt.” Harry pointed out as he put a jar of crunchy peanut butter next to Draco’s.
“Hmm. Anyway, I need to go to bed.”
“ I don’t often work overtime if I can avoid it. I have other things to do.” He said, looking poniently at Harry who pulled a face of hopelessness. Pansy scoffed into her hand.
Can you help Draco today? We need to work on the case but Shacklebolt put the Auror team on Mr Rumbol’s house. We will probably be done around four.
“Hmm. Anything.” Draco said as he flopped onto the sofa and gracefully picked his book up.
“Where did that come from?”
“Shit, I forgot about that.” He paused “It wasn’t me.” He added, wincing. Ron snorted.
“Yeah, that’s fine with me.” He said with a grin.
“One of my fingerings?” She asked. Harry snorted and tried to cover it up with a cough. Draco dug his nails into Harry’s palm but he could see that the blond was suppressing a smile
“Shh.” Harry hushed, relief flooding his veins. “I’ve got you.”
“Well that was unexpected.” He said. They both nodded in agreement.
“Let me think about it.”
Draco snorted from where he was flopped on the bed.
Ron and Hermione looked at each other, Rose asleep on Ron’s lap, her round face covered in tomato sauce and a bit of pasta in her hair. “I think we could stay and not go to the burrow.” Hermione said softly. “I’m sure your mother won’t mind.”
Draco stayed there, pressed into Harry, crying softly in the darkness.
“Pans? No! They have both had a stressful day - let them sleep and we can cook.”
“Umm, how about tomato and green pepper pasta?”
“Ugly ceramics?”
They would see love.
“That’s my shirt.”
“Well, that’s productive.” Draco commented dryly.
“Ooh I know a recipe for some pasta that we can make.”
“What about Ronald?”
Their chatter could be heard from the kitchen. Draco and Harry clattered about, placing mugs, throwing tea bags. As they waited for the kettle to boil, Harry slipped his hands around Draco’s waist, pulling him to press his chest into his back. Draco’s put his head back on Harry’s shoulder and smiled at him.
Draco barely had time to protest before he was taken into another apparition.
“I have no recollection of such a thing ever happening.”
Harry was silent for a moment, clearly thinking.
‘ Harry,
“My babies are precious.” She said slowly.
Draco snorted.
He did no such thing.
“Is everyone here?” There was some muttering and them a unanimous nod. “Right, wonderful, ok.” Ron said awkwardly.  He cleared his throat. “We have a new case from Shacklebolt. Fresh this morning.” There was a buzz of chatter. Ron waited for the chatter to die down. He locked eyes with Harry, giving him a confused look and a grin.
“Mmm.”
“Ok.” He said, his mouth going dry. “I’ll go once Harry gets back.”
“Yes.” Draco agreed as he dragged Harry behind the woman who was shuffling through the clutter. They trailed through the shop at least twice before she stopped, muttering to herself and took a sharp left.  They followed her and found themselves facing the cabinet of dancing figures.
“Mmm.”
“Draco? Draco are you in there?” He said, hearing the anxious edge creeping through.
Who raised his eyebrows.
Reaching up, Harry trailed his fingertips over the scars on Draco’s chest, feeling a shiver run over the pale skin. He rested his hands on Draco’s thighs, the grey eyes still looking down at him.
At that precise moment, Ron strode in having just got back from the house with the intention of asking about their progress. His intention changed when he saw Harry and Draco rolling around on the floor, giggling and snogging.
Lucius looked displeased. “Did my payment for a tutor not have an impact, Draco?” He muttered negligently.
The case was forgotten and the conversation topic was replaced with the Minister’s sexuality.
“Draco, what do you want me to do?” Harry exhaled, exasperation tinting the edges. Draco muttered whilst fiddling with a tea bag.
“Thanks Ron.” Harry said, trying to ignore Draco’s smirk.
Once they got out and started to descend the steps, they found Ron chattering with Pansy and Blaise waiting. When she saw them, Pansy grinned in a way that made Harry feel that he was unsafe.
“Draco. Draco? I had a dream.” He said softly, a smile on his lips at the though of Draco and him with a child. Something to care for and look over and love. Something to live for.
“I like it in here.”
Draco quickly shook his head. “Harry,” He said urgently, placing his hands onto if the rough hands on his knees. “The potion. I know. Just hear me out.” He said patiently, silencing Harry. “The ingredients. They could be found at an extremely secure potions supplies shop at a push, but most of that stuff would be found in places like the ministry. There is some hard core shit in this potion Harry. And that can’t really be found anywhere else. Even illegally.” He added with a slight pause.
All there was to do now was wait for half an hour and then add some dragon sweat and a pinch of ground bat fangs, then the potion would be done. Harry was in a meeting with Pansy and Blaise - lord save him- so he just had to wait.
“Oh, you didn’t hear?” Harry grinned.
Everyone was silent for a moment.
“Fuck! We are never going to be able to do this!” They were running out of theories, each getting more and more wild and based on flimsy evidence. Draco was slowly loosing hope and it was showing. A lot.
“Um, upstairs I think.” Harry replied. “I am not sure, but he should be here soon. He is a bit late.”
Harry sat through the meeting on the two murders. It was very far from boring but it was frustrating in the way that you have a murderer running around on the loose and being a great distance from solving any part of it.
Draco detached himself and started pouring  the water over the tea bags.  They made the tea, carrying the mugs carefully and putting them in cold hands. Hermione had got the fire roaring softly, emitting the much-needed warmth. Draco and Harry collapsed onto the sofa, Draco pushing Pansy’s legs onto the floor, for which he gained many Slytherin level insults. There was fond silence as they all sipped tea. Draco broke it.
“I didn’t think that you needed to wear them in the first place.” Draco murmured.
“We have been through this already father. I won’t and don’t ever intend to marry a woman.”
Harry could slowly feel all the dots connecting as he thought.
“Right.”
“… Yes.”
She waved a hand in his direction, trying to hide her satisfaction with their happiness.
Harry paused. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Pansy.” Draco called. She turned. “We are going to get them.”
“Ok, go and get dressed and then we can leave.”
“Daddy?”
“You mean, you did this in two days.” Ron said, frowning deeply.
There was another pause.
He lifted his wand and pointed it at his chest,
Harry took the book from Draco’s lap, ignored his protestations, found the marked page and started to read.
“What time is it?” He mumbled softly.
Sometimes, Harry thought, magic isn’t everything.
“Don’t you think that maybe be a little dramatic-“
He slept on the sofa that night.
“A bit.”
“I’m going away for a few days.” Ernie interrupted, looking like it was an accident that he had said anything at all.
Draco groaned and raised a hand to the crick in his neck. He listened to the voices in the kitchen with a sigh and hearing muffled sounds from his lap, he looked down to see Harry sleepily rubbing his eyes. He smiled and kissed he tip of the sleepy Gryffindor’s nose. Suddenly a flash went off, they both jump and looked up to see Pansy there with an old muggle camera. She looked at them, grined, shrugged and went back into the kitchen to join the chatter. They both leaned back onto the sofa and started to laugh sleepily until they were just looking at each other. Harry gently put a hand onto the back of Draco’s neck and pulled him down for a kiss. Draco could feel the smile on the Gryfindoor’s mouth as they kissed slowly. The taste was so familiar and comforting but there was another sudden flash as they both jumped and heard Pansy cackling as she stomped back into the kitchen, camara in hand.
“Even so,” Draco cut him off, “Imagine being called Severus, walking into the castle and seeing the portrait of the greasy bastard and realising that your parents did this to you. Merlin I’d hate that.” Draco said finally with a nose wrinkle.
“Wha-…” Harry started, more of a noise of confusion than any formulated word. Hermione looked at Draco, who looked straight back at her.
“Harry… What are we going to do?” Draco asked weakly, rubbing his temples. Harry opened his mouth to reply but was cut off. “I mean, we have spent hours on this and got no where.” Harry opened his mouth again but found himself cut off again. “ We have a whole Auror team relying on us.” Draco whined.
Olo! Hope you enjoyed! It was a funky one...
“So,” He said. “You are telling me that you, Harry James Potter.” He said, waving a hand in his direction. “Would name your son after abusive bastards? Did you lean nothing over your time with those ghastly muggles, or your years of having one glorious wizard say one thing in one ear and another howl into the other.”
He handed the scarf to Harry, the look in his eye showing that he knew very well the feeling of Pansy’s torment. He nodded.
“What the fuck, Draco!” The left side of his neck was covered in red and purple blotches up to his jawline. He could hear Draco cackling from the bedroom. Harry touched them gently, knowing his collar can’t hide them. Fuck.
Ron walked in, closely followed by Aurour Bones and Aurour Macmillan. Ernie looked at Harry as he passed and flinched. Harry raised his fingers subconsciously to his neck and offered an apologetic smile as he walked thorough the wards. Draco tried to cover a snort with a cough.
There was a pause.
Ron came in with four more cups of tea and set them on the table.
“Deeply classified.” Ron added, nodded. Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Well, you can’t say it wasn’t eventful.” Ron said cheerfully.
“Doesn’t he sound super hot!” Draco exclaimed far too loudly. This was met with sounds of protest from Ron, sounds of confusion from Harry and a big ‘YES!’ From Hermione.
There was a small pause.
Ok this was a nice one to write. I hope you like, sorry it's a bit late.
“Fuck off.” Was the reply Harry got from the blonde. The conversation was dropped and they drank tea leaning against the counters, both sleepy.
“I hate you.” Draco said through gritted teeth, doubled over, hair flopping forward.
“Thank you. When do you finish?”
“So?”
“Do you think we should wake them?”
“Draco.” Harry said, far louder than he meant. They all looked at him. Blaise got it first – his eyes widened and his mouth dropped open. “Where is he?” Blaise asked clamly, a clear contrast between his voice and his face.
Harry breathed in sharply.
“Sectumsempra.” He whispered.
Harry stirred the dhal and added some coriander.
Not in it’s most dignified or simple form, but it was love. Nothing more, nothing less. And what a sight it was.
They performed more checks, deciding to wrap it up as dusk started to fall.
Not registering Harry’s exasperation, Draco nodded with a frown, thought about it for a moment and opened the bread bin and dropped the packets into its depths. Harry mentally buried his face in his hands and walked back to the sofa, collapsed onto it and carried on with his book.
Draco looked at him exasperated.
“My mother mentioned in her last letter that he has started collecting them.” Draco said, managing to have a look of both dissatisfaction and amusement.
“Can you cook?” Draco asked Harry “My hands are too cold.” He added.
Draco took the book from Harry’s hands and squinted at it. He brought it closer to his face, paused and then held it at a distance. He then brought it close to his face again, the paper almost touching his nose.
“Mmmm.”
He was only in hospital for that evening. He was discharged for bed rest under the watchful eye of a mediwich and Harry. They got to their flat, drank the anti-toxin potion they had given him and he tucked himself under the covers and stayed there for several days. That is, until he finds himself listening to a clip-clop of heels that could only belong to one person.
“Mmm.”
“I suppose.” He replied, still smiling quietly. He turned to leave and got about half way down the hall when Michaela interrupted his thoughts on Draco.
“I am going to apparate.”
“I love you too.” Harry choked through tears.
They walked through it, the streets people less and silent. Once they had got into that flat, noses and cheeks red and nipped from the cold, Draco brushed the snow out of Harry’s raven hair and kissed his nose. They put their coats onto the hooks and ventured to the kitchen.
“You have that face that you pull when Molly puts a plate of food in front of you that you really don’t want to eat.” Draco commented, unmoving.
They all apparated back to the ministry, wards renewed and stronger for the night.
“Ok. I think that the best thing to do now is find out what is in that potion. We can go from there.”
“His face.” Draco said striding into the kitchen.
They had said that they’d meet at four on the dot.
“You ok?” He said grinning.
“Do you like it?”
“Think about it.” He said softly. “Think about it.”
“I don’t know. I don’t fucking know!”
Draco looked at him unmoving. Around a minute later, he turned and walked down the hallway, his hand trembling in Harry’s.
“Yeah, ok.” And they set off, Draco grabbing Harry’s hand, smiling at him. They walked through the darkening streets, the lampposts illuminating the night fog. They all chattered fluidly until they reached the door of the flat, having climbed all the many steps. They spilled into the flat, all of them making themselves comfortable as Harry and Draco went to make tea. Pansy sprawled over the sofa, Ron and Hermione took their usual large armchair and Blaise threw himself down onto the recliner removing his viciously heeled boots with a content sigh.
“Me neither.” Ron agreed quietly.
“Well now I can’t read!” Draco wailed loudly, dropping his book to his lap with a small thump.
Harry exhaled loudly to show that he was listening, just with his eyes closed. Draco rolled his eyes and continued.
“I have to command a whole team or Aurors like this.” He said.
“Shall we go?” She asked Harry. “It’s quite chilly” , she added.
“Well, ok, that’s sorted. Someone has to go to Pansy’s with her because she can’t floo or apparate this drunk.”
“I love you.” Draco whispered.
He leaned back against the counter, feeling sweat roll down his forehead. The room was too full, the heat making it feel like pressure. He wiped it away with a sleeve and took a deep breath. Blink. Blink again.
Hello again! I hope you liked it. I'm about to start posting more the one chapter a week. Just flagging that up if anyone is interested!
“No, I mean, the whole Auror team. Pansy, Susan and Blaise’s team.”
“Hmm I though you might.” Harry laughed. Draco looked around in awe. It was white and clean and there were mirrors everywhere. He breathed in; it smelled sweet.
“I am aware.” Harry replied, pushing open the door and placing many bags on the table and taking his coat off.
“He got into a bit of trouble, him being in charge of the minister’s safety and all that but they are trying to find out why the minister was splinched in the first place.”
“Harry?” He heard weakly.
Harry was half way through a paper on Spell Use when Blaise pushed the office door open with a bang, making every one jump. Harry looked up and saw the usually reserved and calm man shaking from head to toe in his purple heeled boots and a very tight dress. His eyes were darting everywhere, ever fixing on nothing. Everyone stayed at their desks.
“Well Head Aurours have a meeting in a moment to revise everything, so either tell me now or come with me.” Blaise shrugged.
“When are you going to get yourself a nice wife?” He asked from his desk.
Harry scrambled up off the floor and found his feet in front of the blonde that stood before him.
“Fuck off.” Draco said from the doorway of the kitchen, bathed in light, smirking. “He was always next to you.” He added quietly after a small pause.
“I am almost done you impatient twat! Come in if you must.” Was what he got. Harry laughed gruffly in reply.
The room was lit by natural light, the sofas immaculate. Harry cleared his throat.
“So?”
“What are you waiting for?” Pansy’s voice cut through the silence. “Get on with it.” Chairs scraped against the floor as people shook into action.
Harry cleared is throat and tried to pretend that he want cuddling Draco Malfoy at work.
“Charmed Draco.”
“Harry.” He said through gritted teeth. Harry snapped his eyes open and looked at him. “I’m going to throw up.” He said, trying to sit up and gaging. Harry scrambled around and put a metal basin under Draco’s chin and he threw up neatly into the bowl.
“Mmm. Did you hear that the Michaela is running for Minster?”
The only response he got was a huff.
“Absolutely not! You left me no space and shouted at me when I reached for the soap the last time.”
“Actually Malfoy, I hoped that you could help us. More.” Ron said, looking at Draco.
“I love you too.” Harry whispered back smiling. Draco pulled away and ruffled his hand through Harry’s unruly mop of hair.
“Okay? Do you want to tell me what it is?” Harry asked, feeling as though he’s missing something.
Draco’s eyes flickered and Harry grabbed his face, trying to keep him conscious.
No more.
“I think I’m ok. Just angry.”
He trailed his fingers over the bruises on his neck.
No more.
His phone buzzed in his pocket. It was Ron’s number. He put it to his ear.
“Ok, all of you. Shut up.” Ron said, silencing Blaise and Pansy. “One of the most famous Deatheaters of our life time has just been murdered. People will want to know why and although he wasn’t loved, people still enjoy pushing things onto the Ministry.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ok.” Ron agreed. “Be back soon?”
“Wait. Why are the Aurours there?”
When Ron and Hermione came through the fire place, Draco was asleep with his head on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry was absentmindedly stroking his blond hair whilst reading very softly. Ron ignored it and stomped straight to the kitchen but Hermione fumbled at her side, raised a polaroid camera, took a photo and grinned. As she followed Ron into the kitchen, she pulled the revealed the photo from the camera and put it to develop in her back pocket without a backwards glance.
“Well, fuck.” Draco said. Harry nodded, biting his lip and frowning. They were silent for a while, thinking about all of the many things that there were to think about.
“And Arthur can have anything from muggle London.” He continued.
“I don’t doubt it.” Harry muttered as he set about making food. He examined the contense of the cupboards and the fridge in turn.
He looked over at him again. His hair flopped into his face as he slept. Harry kneeled on the bed and kissed his back and left.
“Yeah.” He said softly. “We’ve been together for about six years.”
The walls were studded with paintings and a window ran high and long up the side letting in streaks of light from the winter day outside.
“So my theory makes sense. It works!” Draco exclaimed. “If the potion meant to harm, it would harm. No. This potion has another purpose. I just need to figure our what it is.” He added after a pause.
A hiss filed the room, all the trained fighters itching to move, but Harry held up a hand and the whole room stilled. In his peripheral vision, he saw Draco edge closer.
“Are you talking about the minister? Good lord, that was all I heard about in the lab.” Chimed in Draco pinching the bridge of his nose delicately.  “I think people forgot it was only an elbow downwards missing.”
“We have to get them.” Draco murmured. He broke apart form Harry and looked him dead in the eye with determination that Harry had never seen before.
“All the cases are Death Eaters. So we are assuming that Death Eaters are going to be attacked next.” She said slowly, almost hesitantly.
Lucius cleared his throat.
“I suppose I’ll take a look then.”
“Ron’s team on public records. Go and control the Press. Pansy’s team go find apparations. Aurour Zabini’s team – go and inspect the body with Aurour Bones’ team.” They all looked at her. Then at the head Aurours.
“How in any world is smooth peanut butter better?” Harry interrupted, waving the jar.
“I’m dying.” He repeated “And you are going to get over it.”  Tears started to collect in Harry’s eyes, but he blinked them away and nodded, neither of them believing it for a single second. Draco pulled him close and kissed his forehead, looking him in the eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, Harry, you actual prick.” Pansy whispered.
Pansy ignored his hysterics.
“Yes. Defiantly. More than anything.”
Draco laughed pitifully. “You’re a coward.” He whispered harshly. “And have you ever considered that I am capable of choosing myself? Have you ever even thought of that?” There was silence. “No.” Draco hissed bitterly. ”Of course you didn’t. I’ll fucking leave when I want to.”
“One of your glass figures.” Draco clarified, a smile tugging at the side of his mouth.
“Escaped, did you?” She said, amused.
Harry took Draco’s hand and and smiled weakly at him. They escorted Ernie away, and he made no resistance and the Aurours started to patch each other up and the sound of tired yet friendly conversation filled the room. Draco pulled Harry into a hug and as he rested his chin on his mop of hair, he said “I don’t know what I’d do without you. I really don’t.”
“We need help translating some Latin.”
“Twice in one day Weasley?”
“Granger, I need you to agree with me on something.” He said frantically, sliding his hand down to Harry’s knee.
“Harry?” he heard Draco’s voice reply from the kitchen. He felt his chest flood with relief as he stumbled blindly towords the kitchen.
“You will bless me with your company, though?”
“I didn’t get the opportunity to tell you how much I like those trousers on you.” Harry whispered.
“Ok, well we are going to visit Rasbatan now.”
This one is very short but the next one is very long and very dramatic so yeah... Sorry for the late posting. let's just say my weekend was more eventful than most. *firm nod*.
For what seemed like far too long, they stood there looking at each other. Harry took a cautious step closer and Draco crumpled.
“You mean to say that the murderer brewed their own poison?” Harry contemplated it for a minute.
“We are looking for a poison that doesn’t kill.”
The door was open and Ron pushed it to reveal high ceilinged dark hallways. It looked like a creepy house. Nothing more, nothing less.
“Poor guy.” Ron said to Harry. Draco looked doubtful. “He’s working too much. Have you seen the bags under his eyes?” Harry mumbled an agreement. Draco waited impatiently.
“Draco, grab some bananas.”
“Blaise?” Harry asked sleepily.
“Draco!” Harry yelled. “Hurry up.”
Harry shook his head, and laughed little more when he tried to take a deep breath to calm himself.
“So, Ernie Macmillan.” Draco said as they walked over the threshold.
“Sorry, no, I don’t know either.” They all paused.
“They’ve killed Lucius, Draco.”
Hermione took a deep breath. “I wonder why?”
Ron snorted.
“Magic isn’t everything, is it? He paused. “I mean, look at me, Harry.” He did. “I’m dying.” He shrugged.
“So early in the day?” Pansy said. Blaise ignored her, looking apologetic.
Harry murmured something unintelligible, eyes still closed. Draco sighed.
“It’s ok.” There was a sleepy silence.
“Mmm.” Draco sipped his coffee.
Instead, he walked restlessly around the flat as silently as he could, passing the bedroom door, for which he did no more than notice was unusually closed.
He put the jar of smooth into the trolley and kissed him on the mouth. Harry kissed back, pulling him in by his shirt.
They talked about nonsense until night fell. They managed to cover Quiddich, more of the Aurour goings on at the ministry, Hermione’s voluminous encounters with particularly sour goblins at Gringotts and the new line of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans which has a new variety of thoroughly disgusting flavors.
Ok so this one was suuuuper fun to write. I hope you like it. I don't know if anyone is following this with each chapter, but if anyone is, I'm curious as to what your theories are... from an outsiders perspective and all that. If you'd like to share, feel free to comment or find me on Tumblr at PrinceAlim.
Harry potter’s funeral was a silent affair. People cried, people talked about the wonderful things he’d done, what a kind person he was.  Everyone pitied him. After all, what a waste – dead now, nothing more.
“What are we doing here?”
Draco who he would never have again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“None. We basically have nothing”
Harry pulled him into an apparation swiftly, finding themselves in a doorway, just out of reach of the flurry of people.
“It’s the latin. They need the latin. Ron wants it.” She looked at him expectantly.
A soon as they were on the doorstep, Draco squeezed Harry’s hand without looking at him and marched towards the door. Anyone else would have seen a perfectly confident young man striding towards the door, but Harry knew better. He could see the tremble in his hands and his wide, wide eyes.
“Where’s Draco?” She asked, like she didn’t want to know the answer but also like she knew it already.
“No you didn’t!” Draco roared at him, his voice cracking. “No you didn’t.” He said, desperation creeping into his quivering voice.
They all started up the conversation about the ministers sexuality, each of them trading specific insider knowledge to back up their points until Pansy declared that she was going to sleep.
“He does look a bit like Harry, Draco.” They looked at Harry who raised his eyebrows at both of them.
“Heaven.”
They broke apart.
“All of the above. Ok, we need to go to muggle London.”
There was a polite scramble fueled by curiosity towards the folder that had been placed on the desk. Extracted, the photo was stared at intently. Harry, Pansy and Draco craned over the many heads and necks to look at the picture in question. The overall impression was yes, the exact same nutter that murdered Rasbatan, murdered this unfortunate soul. The slashes through the chest could bee seen from a distance and the gruesome truth that this murder was painfully similar to the last was visible.
“I numbed them with the potion. I made it so the death would be painless and easier. You have to understand that I didn’t want to kill anyone. It was the only way. It was the only way! And the potion made it ok Harry. It made it ok.” He said, his eyes growing wider as he looked at all the faces in the room. “They had to die. For you Harry. Only for you. And then I killed them. But they didn’t mind because of the potion. It killed them too but I wanted to make sure because if anyone found out that I’d done I’d be in trouble.” Harry didn’t have to look at him to know the Draco would be raising his eyebrows. “But I wanted you to know it was for you so I-”
“Keep the robes on. We need all the luck in out favor.”
“Yes?” Harry replied, throwing a grin over his shoulder.
Harry went undisturbed for around five hours until around four, finding nothing. He had looked through drawers and drawers of filings and spell networks and got absolutely nothing out of either. There was a dull buzz in his head that came from looking at the same type face without anything interesting. He had also been staring at the same for walls for what seemed like centuries and the silence that came from the isolation the room seemed like the loudest sound there could possibly be. And Draco was late, to make things even better.
Silence.
“Oh, the joys.”
His hair was sticking to his forehead and the back of his shirt was damp. He ignored it and referred back to the page titled ‘Mente Plumenium’ , adding two drops of an unnaturally purple liquid into the cauldron, turning the potion a swirling deep shade of blue and the smell filling the room. Draco puffed out his cheeks and tuned the heat down with a flick on his wand and leaned against the counter. Fuck it was warm.
"We only really use that area of the house for entertaining. Business dinners and the like." Draco explained as they walked. "The area ahead is where we actually live." Draco watched Harry's expression closely as they entered his family's dining room. The room was much smaller than Harry had seen from the manor so far, and much more intimate. It was still beautifully decorated but only had a six person table instead of the twenty person monstrosity he had spied through a door on the way there. Draco's mother had the house elves prepare a light lunch as it was near time for it, which was already on the table waiting for them as they entered.
He turned towards his table only to meet the very wide eyes of Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom. Hermione and Ron weren't surprised as he had told them the PG version of what happened last night and though Seamus hadn't known about Draco, he also didn't look all that surprised for other reasons. Harry just looked at their wide eyes and gaping mouths before shrugging and beginning to eat his breakfast.
"Don't deny it, Potter. I heard you call my name as you wanked just now." He looked sternly down at Harry as the dark haired guy tried to deny it. "Don't worry, Potter. I know you want me and I don't mind." Harry looked up at him with a surprised but cautious expression on his face.
Draco's threw his head back in pleasure and moaned loudly as Harry expertly worked his length. He seemed to know exactly when to wiggle his tongue just so and when to use his teeth. With so much stimulation, it wasn't long before Draco was on the verge of coming into Harry's wet and talented mouth.
"I know you're tired baby, but how about a shower before bed?" Draco all but purred as he came up for air. All thoughts of sleep were forgotten as Harry hardened almost painfully. His eyes darkened with lust as he stared longingly at Draco.
"Ginny!" He called out to her. She stopped in her tracks before looking back at him. There were tears falling down her red face. Harry swore to himself before fully catching up to her.
Draco's letters were the only saving grace that Harry had. He got one every single day. The first one shocked him as Draco told him about his mother not only knowing about them being together, but also slowly convincing his father that Draco being gay was good for the family. He laughed (and shuddered a little) when he read how she was basically waging psychological warfare by frequently mentioning gay couples in a positive light and giving his father the silent treatment when he disagreed with her. She even left articles in his work pile on his desk about acceptance and how healthy it was to give up on old grudges.
